TRAINED VOLUNTEERS AND THE REGISTER.
(To certain responsible people.)
WHEN from a ten months' sleep you wake
To find that we've a war on hand,
And feel the time has come to take
A Register of all the land;
To ask about our names and ages
And who the persons are who pay our wages;
Whether in single bliss we live
Or bear the weight of wedlock's chains;
What leisure hours we have to give,
What skill of eye or brawn or brains
To put at England's service, please,
If she should ask us on her bended knees;
You'll hear with nicely ſeigned surprise
That you have had, this six months long,
Unnoticed by official eyes,
An army half-a-million strong
Begging for leave to do its bit
And getting for its pains the frozen mit.
Spurning delights of ease and sport
They plead to serve some humble use,
To guard a line, to man a fort,
Letting our younger warriors loose,
And earn the right to have a pitch
Allotted to them in the final ditch.
And when at last you come and say:
“What can you do? We ask for light
On any service you can pay,”
The answer is : “You know all right,
And all this weary while you knew it;
The trouble was you wouldn't let us do "o S
SQUAD DRILL WITH RESPIRATORS.
WE have much pleasure in favouring our readers with
the new instructions, which are shortly to be embodied in
the Manual of Anti-Zepptic Training. For drill purposes
the important word will be shortened to “Prators.”
GENERAL RULEs.
1. Recruits, before they commence the respirator ex-
ercises, are to be taught the names of the different parts
of the appliance and the care of pads and sponge-bags.
2. Drill with respirators should be practised occasionally
in extended order, i.e., up and down stairs and round
unlikely corners, to accustom recruits to hold their noses
steadily and breathe correctly when separated from their
comrades.
3. The recruit, having been thoroughly instructed in the
respirator exercises by numbers, as shown in the following
sections, will be taught to perform them in quick time,
with a pause of one beat between each motion.
FALLING IN witH RESPIRATORS AT THE ORDER.
The recruits will fall in in the front hall, should there be
one in the house, dressing by and numbering from the
right, the mistress or governess (if any) being right marker,
and the butler or cook (also if any) marking on the left.
Nurses with babies in arms will act as supernumeraries in
the rear and will not form fours or carry their infants at
the trail.
Each recruit will hold his respirator between the right
first finger and thumb, with the two middle fingers extended
and the little finger at an angle of forty-five degrees from
the rest, the back of the hand being upwards and the arm
slightly bent, with the elbow against the side. The left
hand will hang perpendicularly, thumb against the thigh,
fingers together and slanting towards the ground. When
each man (woman or child) has got his dressing he will
stand at ease.
THE SLOPE FROM THE ORDER.
Slope Prators—One.
Give the respirator a cant upwards with the right hand,
catching the muzzle with the left hand, back of the hand
to the left, elbow to the rear.
TWO.
Cut away the right hand to the side.
To Fix RESPIRAToits FROM THE SLOPE.
Fix Prators— One.
Seize the right-hand string of the respirator with the
right hand, knuckles to the front; at the same time push
the muzzle of the respirator sharply forward and turn the
head and eyes to the right, the right-hand man looking to
the left.
Two.
Taking the time from the right-hand man, raise the
muzzle of the respirator to the level of the face, pressing it
home on the nose, open the mouth five-eighths of an inch,
lips pointing outwards, and take a deep breath. Body and
head to be erect.
Three. -
Tie the strings behind the back of the head on a level
with the eyes, turning the head and eyes to the front.
Four.
Cut away both hands to the sides.
Note.—On the word Fir, the right-hand man of the unit
will take three paces forward, resuming his place in line
when the fourth motion is completed.
To UNFIx RESPIRA tors.
Unfix Prators– One. -
Keeping the heels closed, place the head between the
knees, muzzle downwards, and grasp the strings of the
respirator with the thumb and fore-finger of each hand,
keeping the little finger erect.
TWO.
Taking the time from the left-hand man, untie the
strings of the respirator, and with the right hand disengage
the muzzle from the nose.
Three.
Extricate the head from between the knees, cut away the
left hand to the side, and return to the order. ZIGzAG.
Impending Apologies.
I. To Sir Edward Grey.
“Published in Lausanne by Payot and Company, the book . . . has
already appeared in French. An English translation has, we under-
stand, been prepared for the use of our Foreign Office.”
Daily Chronicle.
II. To the Cape Mounted Police. -
“As one observer put it, it was generally a case of ‘one fool follow-
ing another.' Whenever a body of mounted police was seen marching
along a crowd of nondescripts immediately pursued.”—Cape Times.
“When O'Leary stepped from the train he was received by the
Lord Mayor, who shook him warmly by the hand, and in a few words
cordially welcomed his back to Cork.”—Glasgow News.
Cork might well be proud of seeing something that Sergeant
O' LEARY V.C. had never shown to the Germans.

AT THE FRONT.
WE have come to the conclusion that
the people who arrange the battles have
decided that their attitude to us is to
be one of attempted frightfulness.
Whereas other regiments enjoy all the
amenities of peaceful trench life, with,
say, a battle on every third Thursday,
we are continually threatened with
some fresh and frightful prospect which
never materialises. In fact, we are
constantly disappointed.
Sometimes they turn us out at dead
of night and ship us to some forlorn
bit of line, pleasant only in the forget-
ting, and assure us that we shall all be
dead in two hours, and that the old

mess president still pillaging Belgium
for something to fry eggs in. The next
evening sees us re-entraining for
France, billets and security,
with nothing more glorious to
carry back than a sleepy sur-
mise that the old country must
have reconsidered her decision
just in time.
Sometimes again they think
out for us a highly unfortified
attack on a highly fortified
position. Then the General, or
the General's General, sends for
company commanders—at least
it gets to them eventually, pos-
sibly by indirect fire—and ex-
horts them with cheerful words,
such as, “On the afternoon of
to-morrow, Friday, the 17th
“THERE's No DoIN' Nothink with
shAREs IN THAT THERE WAR Ioan "
U206 sunk this morning, A.A.A. Your
attack postponed indefinitely. Ends.”
And then everything continues very
quiet, and we are left wondering
whether there is a strategical connec-
tion between U296 and our attack,
or whether Mr. BALFour just wirell
the news out of pure goodness of heart.
After they had played the attack
game often enough to impel the two
senior Captains to tell some of our lead-
ing Generals not to be silly, they
moved us off here as a punishment
for not taking our attacks, seriously.
“Here" is the seat of the original
Flanders frightfulness. The Bosch has
done all his best turns; he gassed us
the second night in, and he shells our
support line with enormous missiles for
one half of every day. But as we got
warning of the gas half-an-hour before
it arrived, and as the support line he

We spend the night working up a
deuce of a hate, and cutting great chunks
out of our barbed wire. Some of the
officers even have their rifles cleaned,
and when dawn arrives the Bosch is
frightened out of his life by the strange
music of our men grinding their
bayonets on their teeth—an old and
little known army custom always ob-
served on the morning before an attack.
Then at last, as we are finishing a
frugal ration of lunch tongue and
apricots and cream, touching up our
wills, and writing home assurances that
everything continues very quiet, a foam-
ing signaller dashes up to the mess hut
and falls in a dead faint in the act of
delivering the message, “Submarine

Headquarters of the German Army has pub-
lished a statement declaring that Russian
prisoners found in possession of dum-dum
mullets or other projectiles of a like nature
will not be considered as prisoners of war, but
will be shot on the spot.”—Evening News.
But the Germans themselves do not
come into court with clean hands in
this fishy matter. Witness the follow-
ing, from a description of the attack of
one of their submarines on a French
grain ship under tow :-
“The tug was attacked with a hail of mullets,
but it and the grain ship both escaped."
Manchester Evening News.
It does not actually say that they were
dum-dum mullets, but this fish is
notoriously soft-nosed.

“CoME by the 9.30 to-morrow morn-
ing,” said the voice of Macvicar, at the
country end of fifteen miles of tele-
phone. “Small Lochleven flies will do.”
“Delighted,” I answered. “I’ll bring
plenty of sandwiches and a flask.”
“The flask by all means,” Macvicar
murmured ; “but don't bother about
food. We'll stroll home to lunch,
and tea, too, if you like. I had a
24-pounder this morning, a grand
fish.”
Over an aged fly-book I speculated
about the New Angling, which enables
one to land 24-pounders and “come
home to lunch.” The private loch of
the Strathrowan Angling Club was to
show me many surprising ways in which

but also a neat uniform of dark green,
with leather leggings to match. His
silver buttons bore the Club motto. It
was over the doorway, on the weighing
machine, on the covers of the records

“‘Semper Grandiores,’” I muttered
to Augustus as he stowed my mackin-
tosh in the stern of the boat.
“Yes, Sir," he answered ; adding
helpfully, “I understand it is the Latin
for ‘Bigger fish yet.'"
“Did you invent it, Augustus?” I
asked, getting in with due respect for
the polished satin-wood thwarts.
“No, Sir. It was selected by the
President, I believe.”
Macvicar seated himself in the bows,
in an elegant and lofty cane-chair,
pivoted like a piano-stool for con-
venience in casting. Augustus fiddled
with an electric switch and a little
wheel amidships. We backed out from
the pier and turned towards the head
of the loch, visible six hundred yards
away and marked by a row of poplars.
“Don't see many poplars about
here,” I remarked.

“No,” said Macvicar. “The Club
imported these from Bedfordshire. They
bring the Mayfly on the water a week
or two sooner.” -
We purred along an islet, about
fifteen yards by ten, gay with daffodils.
“Charming,” I said. “Very nice
indeed.” • .
“That's Eilean Shona,” Macvicar
explained. “The Vice-President put
those in. They are his favourite flower.
He does a bit of gardening on the
island on Sundays. He did think of
a little hot-house, too, but people might
have rotted us about it.”
“It would have had to be a very
little one,” I said, “ or it might have
sunk the island. Everything here is on a
small scale, except the Club-house—--"
“And the fish,” Macvicar corrected.
“Look out, you're into something.”
Three yards of line ran out with a
pleasant whirr. About thirty seconds
later a plump Lochleven trout sailed
reluctantly into the landing net.
Augustus released it tenderly from the

“I'm afraid it's just under, Sir,” he
said. '.
“Why, it looks
I protested. * * -
Augustus laid the fish delicately
along an ivory foot-rule let into the
edge of a thwart. “Nine inches, Sir,”
he said with the solemnity of a judge
prescribing penal servitude.
“Pity,” said Macvicar, casting
greedily towards the islet and speak-
ing over his shoulder. “Ten inches is
the limit. Not hurt, is it, Augustus?
If it had been badly hooked we could
have kept it.”
Augustus slipped the fish overside
and wiped his hands on a towel bearing
the Club monogram and motto.
“All right,” I said; “I’ll strike the
next in the angle of the jaw and be
rather harsh with it.”
On our first drift down-wind, which
ended only when I hooked one of the
hanging baskets of Darwin tulips on
the Club verandah, we had five trout,
all under ten inclies. Those of seven
or more were immediately released on
their own recognisances to come up
again when called upon. The others

plained ; “and then Augustus interns

* :
“Won't they find it rather dull
behind that wire netting? It's not
even barbed wire.”
“They grow, anyhow,” Macvicar
said. “Minced liver and wheat tailings,
boiled soft, make a wonderful difference
in three months' time.”
Between lunch and tea we had a
dozen fish, and kept three, including
one well over two pounds, which Mac-
vicar caught, according to his explana-
tion, not in any spirit of bombast, but
as evidence of good faith.
“We'll fish the Narrows,” he said,
after our Crown Derby tea, “from the
European side. That's where the
rainbows lie.” -
We slid to the top of the loch
and looked into a little creek, about
eighty yards by twenty across.
“Doesn't look promising,” I said;
“there's not a breath of wind in
there.”
“We'll soon put that right,” said
|Macvicar confidently. “We'll try the
transuff, Augustus.”
Augustus sculled the boat to the
bank, stepped out, opened a padlocked
box above high-water mark and turned
a handle. There was a sudden hiss of
air released under heavy pressure. Little
catspaws of wind appeared at intervals
along the creek. By the time Augustus
was back in the boat these puffs of
air had grown to a light but steady
breeze.
“My aunt' " I said in respectful
tones.
“Service's Patent
Macvicar explained. “Costs a bit of
money, of course. That's why it's
only fitted for this little creek. Next
season we mean to put a pipe down

twenty minutes. We drifted down to

From the fir wood a voice interrupted
me. “Cuck-oo, cuck-oo.”
“To say nothing of the wandering
voice,” said Macvicar. “There he is.”
The bird ſlapped slowly across the loch.
“Bless my soul,” I said, “so it was
a real bird after all 2 ”

ARMY CONTRACTS.
Alfred had a severe attack of Army
Contract fever the moment the War
started. He had every known symptom
of the malady and a few over, in spite
of his forty-eight years and a good
business as a Surveyor. When he was
first attacked the disease took the form
of mittens. But when the War Office
people wrote and told him that the kind
he sent them would not mit, he swept ||
his samples into the waste-paper basket
and went all out on khaki cloth.
The reason his malady took this form ||
was that he had what he called “an
enquiry” for it. I have since learnt
what an enquiry means in this connec-
tion, and I think this is both the time
and the place to explain the term and
what it connotes.
It means apparently the dropping of
a hint by A to B that A has seen C who
can place so many hundred acres of
cloth, so many thousand quarts of brass
buttons, or so many million hands of
horse, or whatever the commodity may
be which is the subject of enquiry.
B then sets out to find D, who when
discovered is found to be a person having
the acquaintance (business, and slight
at that) of E, who knows F (and some-
times wishes he didn't). F is in close
touch (a fine old hallowed expression in
the City) with G, who lives in Bradford,
or the button-growing district, or Mexico,
as the case may be; and G says he has
the cloth or buttons or horses. He is
probably lying, but this is not generally
established till the end of the game.
A, B, C, D, E and F all want com-
missions if the deal comes off, and G,
the alleged seller of the goods, wants a
profit, so it's a sort of round game
rather like “Snap.” -
Alfred by superhuman efforts heard
of some khaki cloth that had nothing
particular to do at the moment, so he
engaged it for the deal. But when the
samples were submitted to the authori- |
ties it was discovered that the maker had
bungled over the recipe and had put in
the ki before the kha, or else the dye
was all loose and wobbling about. Any-
how the deal was off. -
Following the proper rotation of
crops, Alfred tried rations, lint, chloro-
form and boot polish, and came at last
to horses.
It was at this stage of the game that
I first took a forced interest in his
doings. His office is not tidy at any
time, and when I called on him it was
difficult to find a seat, every available
piece of furniture being filled up with
samples. His desk was littered with
bottles of all sorts, tins of boracic
powder, liquid soap, and packages of
various shapes, sizes and aromas.

in time that our tried family physician
had warned my father once that undue
horticultural indulgence might have
fatal results in my case. I had been
treating myself, I well remember, for
measles with a small green apple. As
I told Cecilia, it is ridiculous to slight
the advice of a family doctor. Not an
ordinary physician, I said, but a family
doctor.
Perhaps I should have told her less
emotionally, as she went and bought
me a quilted red double chest-protector.
I managed to ; it off my chest on to
a stall at a bazaar as a Kurdistan
native lady's bridal head-dress.
the success of the sale.
The fall of Cecilia began with bulbs.
She was anxious to out-bulb the Vicar's
wife, an old hand, full of wise saws and
other modern implements. She pored
over that pedantic brochure, Hints to
Amateurs. On Bulbs. By One. The
result was the breaking of Fogarty's
back.
As he said, “The back's broke on
me, planting thim bulbs ' " Cecilia did
the digging, and, as far as I could see,
It was
Bridgeen, our between-maid, did every-
thing else. Fogarty was locum tenens
for the professional gardener, who had
gone fishing. He didn't say so when
he returned. He put his handkerchief
to his eyes and said, “She had been
always very kind to me, and I had to
see the last of her ' "
The three of them planted bulbs
everywhere. No place was sacred. I
kept indoors, as I have a bald spot.
Bridgeen stood between Cecilia and
Fogarty, and he broke his back passing
the bulbs to Bridgeen, who handed
them to Cecilia, who planted them
solemnly according to the ritual of
Hints to Amateurs, which lay open
beside her on the grass.
This to me now seems years and
years ago, as the bulbs have all come
up since. It was Bridgeen who con-
veyed the information to Cecilia.
We were at breakfast when the blow
fell. I remember I was at peace with
all mankind, looking meditatively across
the beautiful country, when a fly came
straight through the window into my
left eye. I don't know why flies always
select my left eye to die in. I have
known them come miles to do it.
Cecilia was in the middle of her third
cast with the table napkin, and I was
just remarking that I'd rather keep the
eye with the fly, if she didn't mind, than
the fly without the eye, when Bridgeen
tore in and cried, “If you please,
Ma'am, will you come out and look at
your bulbs 2. They are all up. And
every blessed one is a Spanish onion',
And wasn't I saying to meself at the
time that them bulbs had the smell of
stew about them.” "
When the Vicar's wife came in
triumph to lorgnette our poor bulbs,
I found Cecilia exhibiting them with
pride. She explained with modest self-
depreciation that in war-time every
patriot grows vegetables in place of
flowers.
“Bryan's second statement, scnfwy and
amfwy andardlainanana published this morn-
ing, is a piece of stupefying impudence."

Of its impudence we cannot pretend to
judge, but it is certainly “stupefying.”

scanty time particulars of important
measure. Not new to WALTER LONG.

what they described as the unprincipled
straining of a provision expressly de-
vised for sole purpose of hastening
on their course measures absolutely
non-controversial.

Appears there is a group of persons,
calling themselves a Peace Committee,
engaged in distributing pamphlets of a
character harmful to national interests
in relation to the War. What the
Member for St. Augustine's wanted to
know was “Whether the HoME SECRE-
TARY proposes to take any measures to
provide against the danger of their
being lynched 2"
Never since the utterance of famous
entreaty, “Don't nail his ears to the
pump,” was the fine feeling of philan-
thropy more pointedly expressed.
HoME SECRETARY gravely comforted
Hon. Member with assurance that
“such violence would call for severest
repression, whilst a great responsi-
bility would attach to anyone who
might be supposed to suggest that it
was excusable.”
Business done.-CHANCELLOR of Ex-
CHEQUER introduced Bill enabling

OFFICIAL TERMINOLOGY.
THE C.O. wiped away from his fore-
head a few small pools of perspiration,
in which adventurous blue-bottles were
dabbling their tentacles. “Listen to
this,” he said. “The G.O.C. will not
permit the continued use of slang terms
in reports and correspondence, such
as ' dug-out' for bomb-proof shelter,
‘sniper' for sharpshooter, ‘pip-squeak"
for light high-velocity gun. What is the
Army coming to?”
As none of the mess dared hazard a
forecast, the C.O. continued : “Well,
it's an order, and orders have to be
obeyed, and this battalion is to be in
the vanguard of obedience, and if I
find any junior subaltern"—here he
glared at the “O.C. signals"—" dis-
obeying orders, then . . .
At this point the Machine Gun
Officer walked in. “The Bosches,”
he said, “ have been potting at my
dug-out the whole blessed afternoon.”
The C.O. straightened himself out.
“You mean to say ‘The Germans have
been directing their artillery fire upon
and towards the bomb-proof shelter
which you are accustomed to occupy.’”

We are a loyal battalion, and since
the order was read out we have all
endeavoured to obey it, though it took

his famous “Now then, do yer bit" to

A few nights ago our Adjutant was
almost rendered hors-de-combat by a
report of a small attack by Germans
on a slag-heap in our lines. He insists
that the term “German " is slang and
so refers to them as “militant bodies of
composite Teutonic origin.” As I was

THE HUMAN SIDE.
[“Owing to his shortness in stature, many people think that Mr.
Lloyd George is a small man and lacking in physical power.
This, however, is quite a mistake. The truth is that Mr. Lloyd
George, who weighs thirteen-and-a-half stone, is a very sturdy
person.”—“Cabinet Ministers: Their Human Side,” “Strand
Magazine.”]
I LovE to read about the good and great,
Limned in some enterprising magazine,
Not in the trappings and the pomp of State,
But as they figure in some homely scene—
As “standing by his kitchen-garden gate,”
Or “playing with his little daughter Jean"—
Exhibiting, in short, that “human side.”
Whereby to plainer folk they are allied.
I like to know, for instance, that Lord CREwB
Delights in playing on the pianola;
Or that he has a favourite cockatoo
Which answers to the gracious name of Lola;
That CARson rarely touches Irish stew,
And feeds his Persian cat on Gorgonzola,
And, though his literary views are sane,
Considers Tolstor greater than HALL CAINE.
It helps me, too, to learn that WALTER LONG
Prefers jam sandwiches to bread-and-butter;
That Dr. MACNAMARA plays ping-pong;
That SIMON likes an aluminium putter;
That Mr. BALFour, when his game goes wrong,
No sort of oath is ever heard to utter,
But always keeps undauntedly serene
Save when his caddie hiccups on the green.
I thrill to read how CoNAN Doyle in hats
Requires a size one larger than MARcon1;
That Dr. CLIFFoRD sometimes wears black spats
And likes milk puddings made with macaroni;
That PADEREwski is afraid of bats;
That Mrs. BARcLAY drives a Shetland pony;
That HERBERT SAMUEL has shrimps for supper,
But never reads the works of MARTIN TUPPER.
It comforts me to know that China tea,
And not Ceylon, Assam, or even Senna,
Is regularly quaffed by BEERBoHM TREE
As well as Mr. REGINALD McKENNA;
That Mr. BIRRELL smokes a B.B.D.
Whene'er he rusticates at Rosapenna,
But when at Overstrand prefers cheroots,
And always wears on Sunday button boots.
Details like these, which writers in The Strand
Provide ad lib., I welcome with effusion;
But I resent, upon the other hand,
Assertions tending to our disillusion,
Or showing that the leaders of our land
May end in lame and impotent conclusion,
As when the startling statement goes the rounds
That GEORGE weighs thirteen stone plus seven
pounds.
Can we believe it—that our Cambrian sprite,
Quintessence of ethereal velocity,
Should have expanded in a single night
To such a miracle of adiposity ?
Such allegations cast a horrid blight
On all romance and turn it to jocosity.
It cannot be; yet if it should prove true
The Censor never should have let it through.
And O ye curious scribes, who in your zeal -
To feed the printing press with fact and fable,
Invade the statesman at his frugal meal -
And catalogue the dishes at his table;
Whatever other secrets you reveal, -
Henceforth let no one feel himself unable
To render faithful service to the State
Without your publishing his fighting weight.

“Terrible fellows, these sergeant-majors.”
“Yes, but that's the sort of thing you want—makes you

“It's always done at the trail in Rifle regiments.”
“I didn't know yours was a Rifle regiment. What's the

“Well, you see, we do it at the trail, and the others do it

“Ah.”
“You’ve got to get into close column of platoons first.”

“Yes, but how do you get back to close column 2."
“Easy enough. ‘On No. 1 form close column of platoons.

“That would do it, but it's not in the drill-book.”
“Have you managed to get your rifles yet? ->
“Yes; Sniders, most of them, about a hundred yards long

OUR LAST LINE BUT ONE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-When you think
of our soldiers, you generally have in
mind the men who are in the trenches
in Flanders, or are going out to give
| the final push to the German Empire
in the Summer. But there are others
whom you never hear people talk
about. Take ourselves, for example,
Here we have been since August, guardº
ing the defended port of Mudhaven.
I refrain from further details for fear
of giving information to the enemy;
and, anyhow, you can buy picture post-
cards of all the forts at any stationer's
shop in the town for 1d. each (or 2d.
coloured). But I may safely say that
it is the last place the Germans would
be likely to attack.
But you mustn't imagine that we
have no excitement. Captain Driver's
i engagement with a tin can off Pier
Head Fort thrilled us for weeks. He
engaged it with his heavy guns and
subsidiary armament, and when it
drifted so close in that they couldn't
train their guns on it they threw
stones at it. The enthusiasm of the
men was splendid. You couldn't stop
them, and when the can was picked up
next morning it was found to be riddled
with holes, besides having a big dent
in it. This last was beyond doubt due
to a well-directed shot from Capt. Driver
himself, who was cover-point in an
| Oxford XI. famous for its fielding, and
serves to show the close connection
between the playing fields of peace and
success in war. The other forts were
naturally jealous, and two nights later,
just to show what it could do, Mud
Fort opened fire on a school of porpoises,
* who were forced to retire with, it is
believed, heavy losses. So we feel that
the pirate submarine will have to dis-
guise itself pretty well to get by us.
All the regulars have long since left
for the Front. Our O.C. is a gallant
veteran with a string of medals stretch-
ing far back into Victorian times.
Indeed, among the men, who are mainly
| drawn from the rural districts of Mud-
shire, where the chronological aspect
of history is evidently ill understood,
he is widely supposed to have been
present at the Battle of Waterloo, an
impression due partly to his appear-
ance and partly to his habit of referring
to that battle when he addresses re-
cruits. The other officers are mainly
dug-outs who left the Service on account
of age or some other infirmity, such as
impaired digestions, defective visions,
diseased livers, or merely a general
disinclination to work.
The rest of us, lawyers, engineers,
schoolmasters and the like, are trying
to follow the intricacies of military

etiquette. We have learned that you
must never argue with a senior officer,
even if, as may happen, his opinion is in
apparent conflict with the Drill Book.
But the habits of our civil occupations
are difficult to break through. The
Colonel is in the nature of things inured
to flattery and subservience of every
kind, but even he, seasoned old warrior
as he is, was electrified when Jameson,
who is a police-court solicitor, addressed
him in the orderly-room as “Your
worship.”
Sometimes we hope that we may yet
get a chance to play some more exalted
part in this epoch-making time, but
mostly we expect to stay where we are
till the end of the War. Then—for
news comes slowly to these parts—I
imagine someone at the War Office will
remember to write and tell us it is all
over, or perhaps they will stop sending
us our pay. Otherwise we shall be
found at some future date tottering up
to our crumbling emplacements, lean-
ing against our antiquated ordnance,
searching the sea with spectacled eyes,
waiting, still waiting, for the attack
that never comes.

“NOW THEN, GENTLEMEN, WHAT ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME ABOUT
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It seems a pet formula with Mr. WILLIAM J. Locke to
take a number of pleasant, conventionally well-bred persons,
and dump into the midst of them a primitive and preferably
feminine savage. You may recall a previous instance of
his success with this. In Jaffery (LANE) he varies the
ingredients, but repeats the success. Jaffery was a big
man with a beard, a war-correspondent, upon whose hands
a deceased colleague had left a young widow just plucked
from the mountain fastnesses of her native Albania. So
Jaffery, guided by Mr. Locke, brought Liosha—such was
her terrific name—home to the happy Berkshire abode of
Hilary, who tells the tale. Of course there was the dickens
to pay. There were others also ; especially when Liosha,
in that natural irritation that we all feel at the non-arrival
of letters, charged the country postman with purloining
them, and wound up by flinging him into the ditch and his
letters after him. That is the kind of widow Liosha was.
But Mr. LockF does not rely wholly upon her for his
intrigue. Hilary and Jaffery had a third friend, a pleasant
ineffective person named Adrian, who, to the astonishment of
the world and his immediate circle, suddenly blossoms forth
as the author of the Book of the Year. For my part, I sus-
pected Adrian from the first. He had a trick of turning pale
and snapping his wine-glass when people congratulated him
upon his masterpiece; conduct which I, who have met
how, I spotted Adrian's secret in once.
had done, and how Jaffery tried to mend matters, is for you
to find out. I am pretty sure you will agree with me at
the end that Mr. LockB has written no more genial and
entertaining story than this.
In Rank and Riches (STANLEY PAUL), Mr. ARCHIBALD
MARSHALL provides his readers (I hope they are as largely
numerous as his skill deserves) with another of his
delightful and placid surveys of English country life. He
has the authentic feeling for the countryside, its lanes and
trees and gardens, its squires, its parsons, its houses—in
a word, for its atmosphere, and he describes it and its
inhabitants with a loving and a careful hand. The story
opens with the downfall of the Marquis of Meadshire and
the sale of his great house and its contents to the new rich
man from the regions of high finance, Mr. Armitage Brown.
Thence flow many complications and not a few collisions
between varying temperaments and traditions. The new
man does not fit very comfortably into his new life, though
his son and his daughter do their best to make things more
easy for him. Yet Mr. Brown is in more senses than one
a man of metal, and entirely refuses to succumb to the
impertinences of the bibulous Marquis. In the interview
between the two and in other scenes Mr. MARSHALL gives
proof of his excellent turn for dialogue. He does not smash
up the weaker character at one blow, but gives him plenty
of strong arguments which have to be met and fairly
defeated. Thus the issue is left in doubt up to the last,
and when the right man wins the reader is all the more
pleased. It is a great joy to meet once again some of the
many novelists, felt to be unusual. Moreover, I started characters of the Clinton novels. They are older, but are

be left in suspense. I can only say that if the Marquis of
Meadshire eventually applies for Katie Brown I shall for-
bid the banns, for Katie is charming, and the Marquis
cannot safely be left within half-a-furlong of a bottle of
whisky.
For quite a long time I hoped that Miss Is ABEL C. CLARKE
was enjoying, doubtless at my expense, a laugh which
eventually in her mercy she would invite me to share.
Then, particularly if I could have secured a vicarious
revenge by working the jest off on you, I should have felt
she was within her rights and all would have ended well.
But unfortunately in Whose Name is Legion (HUTCHINsoN)
the laugh never turns up, for as the plot develops there
becomes ever more relentlessly apparent a serious purpose
of a quite unusually alarming character. Even if one
cannot altogether acquit the authoress of applying her
study in demonology to an end of sensation (though after
all she had to do something to keep things moving) the fact
remains that she has set --
out to light a flaring
beacon, a warning away
from Spiritualism and a
call towards Rome, there -
being, it would seem, no =

has ever heard. Whatever
the merits of her opinions, |

The Tollhouse, as of all War-tales published to-day, is that,
as the main plot is concerned with the punishment of

undistinguished, little book, which may be of some value
as a record of our contemporary life, in the happier days
when it shall have ceased to be contemporary.

of sensation novel. But the promise of that story has
never been maintained, and The Gillingham Rubies is
rather poor stuff. I have an idea that Mr. JEpson is taking
too little trouble over these part humorous, part sensational
novels of his. It is true that they are not particularly
exalted literature, but that is no reason why he should not
pay a reasonable amount of attention to style and character-
drawing. It looks as if Mr. JEPsoN did not hold a high
enough opinion of this book to read twice what he had
written, and I am bound to say that, if that is the case, I
can sympathise with him. I should not care to have to
read The Gillingham Rubies twice myself. But it is nice
to think of Messrs. Hutchinson AND Co. chuckling over it.
From an article on “The Way to End the War":
“There would be no need to wait until we had reached an aerial
strength of, say, ten or twenty thousand machines. With two or
three thousand, which could be turned out in as many months, our
new aerial army could get busy.”—Daily Dispatch.
Even so, it seems that we must wait for a century or two
before the War in the Air can start in earnest. -

You little folk—just voices, nothing more—
Who love to figure on the Chamber floor,
Wallow in sentiments of Teuton tint
And see your prattle reproduced in print;
Here in these islands, on your native sward,
We know you (not in person, thank the Lord),
And on the advertising space you fill
Can put its proper value, which is nil.
But yonder, in your friend the enemy's land,
Where nobody begins to understand—
Where Truth’s imbibed from very ancient founts
And still they think a politician counts—
Where those who judge us have no measuring-span
Whereby to tell a midget from a man—
Out there the Press reports your childish chatter
As though it fell from mouths that really matter,
And Berlin says: “They grope without a guide
Now that the expert, A, has come our side; ”
Or “Britain's Empire crumbles at a touch—
Her leading statesman, B, has said as much.”
And Huns who never heard your names till now
Suck it all in and wear a radiant brow,
Crying, “Turn on the gas Our Gott begins
His tardy punishment of England's sins !”
Records of shining courage, such as spur
Limp hearts to action, frequently incur

Lest they afford a wrinkle to the foe;

Content to blather while your country bleeds—

Of carping at a patriot Coalition,
Of hounding with the old sectarian hate
The men whose only party is the State—

The copious spout of your putrescent cackle;

And, viewing, picture England torn in two.

RUNNING THE WAR.
[After the bland method of Mr. A RNoLD BENNETT every
week in “The Daily News.")
IAPPEAR to have been sharply brought to book in sundry
high places for an observation which I made in this
column last Friday, namely, that I anticipated that the
War would be over in about three weeks. Exception was
taken in the same quarter to my contention that it wasn't
so much a war as an international job. I can only say
that, as my readers are surely well aware by this time, I
know all about it, and more than that I mean to go on
writing about it. A man can't always be writing novels—
that is the truth about an author. If I must once again
produce my credentials I may add that I approach the
problem with that expert and well-grounded knowledge
of European warfare which is the fruit of a life-long
study of the social conditions of the Five Towns. We
have had too much of the fatuous din of experts. This is
Our war.
Some of my many friends call me an Optimist, but I can
only ask them to look at the matter squarely, or rather to
eldest (living) of a family of five.
allow me to put it before them in its true light. There are,
as we now know—some of us —three important and
imminent developments which are calculated to end the
international job suddenly at any moment. The first is
known to every one; the second is still the secret of the
higher command (and myself); the third is known only to
me. But there they are. A Tory lady of my acquaintance,
—yes, a Tory lady—recently used these words to me: “If
we don't win this War we shall lose it, and that means
that we shall be defeated, and Germany will be victorious.”
I assured her that I would rather be sneered at as an
Optimist than hold such reactionary views as these.
The Government have more than once had from me (as
my readers know) words of warm encouragement and
approbation. I repeat that they are an incomparable
body of Ministers who have consistently shown the greatest
genius in handling this War—that is, this international
job. At the same time they are continually perpetrating
criminal blunders, and that is where I come in. It is
imperative that I should keep setting them right. I have
(as I have repeatedly remarked) a very large correspondence
nowadays about social matters. And I am always at it.
You wouldn't believe. Only last Tuesday I visited a girls'
school in Sevenoaks, where a proposal had been mooted to
teach the elder pupils to make respirators; and not long
ago a special friend of mine, who is a leading Trade
Unionist, personally conducted me over an engineering
shop in Bolton. So I have the whole thing at my
fingers' ends. And I emphatically warn the Government
that some things need altering.
The country is united and will stand as one man behind
the Cabinet in any step which they decide to take. And
yet my own private opinion is that there are certain steps
(of which I strongly disapprove) which, if taken, would
split the country from top to bottom. I say advisedly
that there are forces at work.
Instances can be given in my own neighbourhood. I
find it better to give these personal instances which come
under one's own eye simply because they are of such
extraordinary general interest. Last week an elderly lady
connected with the Soldiers' and Sailors' Help Society called
and interviewed my cook, whose husband is in the A.S.C.
(Let me say at once that the S. & S. H. Society is doing
magnificent work of a far-reaching nature. I have ascer-
tained that fact for myself. I made a special point of
dropping in not long ago to have a talk with the local
secretary. I impressed him very favourably). My cook
was subjected to the closest cross-examination as to
whether in the absence of her husband she was well fed
and cared for in my house. Now that wants altering.
. Take again the case of Bob Higgs. He is a great friend
of mine. I know him well. He is an agricultural labourer.
He tells me he was twenty-three on the 18th of May last.
I should say that he is unmarried and has red hair and
always fills his pipe with his left hand; 5ft. 8%ins., the
He had a dispute with
his employer about wages and made up his mind to enlist.
(I need hardly say that the employer was quite in the
wrong; employers always are, though I hasten to add
that they have one and all shown magnificent patriotism
in the present crisis). Four times Higgs tried to pass
the doctor, and every time he failed. So he is forced to
stay at home. That wants altering, though candidly I
don't quite see how it is to be altered, as Bob Higgs has
only one eye.
Meanwhile there is an international job to finish and we
must get on with it. The German-line in the West is
still unbroken, and they are pushing forward in the East.
That wants altering.

WAR-TIME ECONOMIES.
“Eat two ounces less meat a day.”—Daily Press.
Conscientious Youth. “FATHER, You've GIVEN ME AN EIGHTH of AN ounce Too MUCH.”
BREAKDOWNS AND REPAIRS.
THE rain was being swept across
the dyke-lined flats by a stiff easterly
breeze. Everything was cold, wet and
glutinous with mud. The loose planks
at the bottom of the trench squished
and sucked to the movement of im-
patient feet.
Peter Simmonds surveyed the scene
gloomily. One of a new draſt, he was
unaccustomed to the local conditions
and felt completely out of touch with
his new profession; also he desired
speech.
“Bit off, I call it.” He turned to his
companion, a lugubrious old timer who
chewed tobacco steadily and vouchsafed
no reply.
He tried again. “Cawn't stand this
blinkin' rain. Wot the 'ell are we waitin'
'ere for 2 ''
The other man eyed him scornfully.
“Royal Artilleree, o'course,” he replied;
“d'yer think we're waitin' for the
champagne ter come erlong 2"
As if to vindicate this statement,
shrapnel began to explode over the
German trenches some 400 yards in
advance. At first occasionally, and
then, when the range was secured, in
growing volume until the sound was
something beyond all knowledge—
certainly beyond the knowledge of
Peter Simmonds. His small body
seemed to grow smaller and his eyes
! started out of his head like those of
a captured rabbit. Presently, with a
rush of air that almost threw him
down, a large projectile passed just
over him.
“Gawd! wot's that ?” he shouted,
| clawing at the man stationed on his
ileft.
“Common shell,” was the reply.
“Clearin' away wire hintanglements
preparatory to the advance.”
Peter wilted still further at the word
“advance.”
“When the hintanglements is cleared
away, as requisite, the Captain blows
'is little whistle and the Company
advances hat the double—at least, them
as ain't 'it does.”
This man's loquacity was almost as
bad as the phlegmatic attitude of the
other.
The shell fire slackened a little.
“Look 'ere,” cried Peter to no one
in particular, “I ain't well, I ain't. I
ought ter be in 'orspital, that's where
I ought ter be.”
“Garn,” said his left-hand neighbour,
“you ought ter be in a pramberlater,
you ought. Wot avocation might you
'ave been pursuing before you come
out 'ere?”
“Shuvver,” replied Peter, scenting
sympathy. “I drove a ‘General'
Barnes and Liverpool Street, that was
my lay.”
“An' what brought you to this yer
state of military hinefficiency?”
“Well, yer see,” Peter hesitated and
sought for the truth, “I 'ad a bit of a
skid at 'Yqe Park Corner and knocks
over a privit kerridge, knocks an old
gent aht of it too—Earl o' Something,
'e was. The old blighter said I was
racing one of them Blue 'Ammersmiths,
and that puts the kybosh on my job of
motorin' . . . Wasn't 'arf a skid, I
tell yer.” -
Peter's reflections were interrupted
by a renewal of the shell fire. A subal-
tern came down the trench and spoke
to the men. He spoke to Peter, but
Peter didn't hear; his mind was already
occupied.
After what seemed an interminable
period there was a shrill blast of a
whistle, followed a second later by
another from the opposite point of the

self up. Then his terrified brain
slackened from its objective, his
fingers loosened themselves, and
his inert, half-conscious body
slid back into the trench.
For some time he lay in the
muddy water mentally dazed.
Some where he could hear
sounds; the crack of rifles, the
incessant tap-tap-tap of machine
guns, and the occasional smack
of a bullet into the soft earth
above his head.
At last he realised that the
water that was soaking him
was extremely cold. He sat
up, and, staggering to his feet,
began to move along the trench.
Around him was an indescrib-
able nerve-racking clamour, but
he had the trench to himself,
anyhow. One thing fixed itself
in his mind; whatever happened
he was not going to leave the
trench. He was quite resolved
on that point. Eventually he
came to a cross section which
abutted on to, and commanded,
a road. This was the limit of
his perambulation. Here he
decided to wait. His patience
was inexhaustible; besides, he
was ill, very ill. He had barely
settled down when the drone
of a motor struck upon his ear.
Gradually it became more dis-
tinct; evidently it was approach-
ing him by the road. Peter
peered out cautiously. Yes,
there it was—a 'bus undoubted-
ly—a motor-'bus, moving with
obvious reluctance through a sea of
mud.
Peter, fascinated, watched its pro-
gress; watched it struggle to within
twenty yards of him and then break
down.
The driver jumped off and tore
open the bonnet. Two A.S.C. men
joined him, and together they juggled
feverishly with the mechanism. Noth-
ing happened.
Peter looked on with growing con-
tempt. “Bloomin' gardeners,” he
muttered and became less cautious.
Five uneventful minutes passed.
Peter could stand it no longer.

what steps to take.” -

“Go ahead,” said Sinclair.
“The question is,” I began, “after

“Well, give up golf altogether.”
Nevertheless I went on calmly. “By
what means,” I asked, “can we best

“I should countermand the new

class,” said Sinclair.
“There are two ways in which we
| can help. By buying the War Loan
and by reduction of imports.”
That made Sinclair sit up at last.
“Ah,” he said. “Imports?”
“Yes,” said I sternly. “It's like
this. If you buy a penny box of English
matches your penny goes to the chap
who made the matches, It stays in
the country and helps to fight Germany.
But if you buy a piece of india-rubber
with your penny it goes to some out-
sider in the tropics (who grew the
rubber) and is lost.” - -
“That, of course, is perfectly simple,”
the Reverend Henry broke in. “The
real difficulty is with regard to the

Henry. “The point is, the loan ought
to be bought out of cash savings.”
“Well, I'm not in this,” said Sinclair.
“I haven't got any cash savings—far
from it.” -
“That's just our difficulty,” said I.
“Henry, for instance, has no cash

they are, but they are reputed to be

even sell my Nitrates.” -
“But don't you see the flaw, Sin-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 14, 1915.
THE WATCH DOGS.
XXIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, No sooner had
I posted that letter to you about leave
being cancelled than news was received
that leave was restored. Half-an-hour
later I was to be seen galloping for the
nearest rail-head in the mess - cart,
moving with all possible speed from
the area in which minds are changed
so suddenly; in a few hours I was on
the boat, catching my first delighted
glimpse of that trim white island of
ours, and agreeing with a weather-
beaten Major, who had no doubt done
his bit of grousing also in his time,
that “it was worth going to a little
trouble and expense to keep that intact.”
On our return to the War, we found
that developments unfavourable to our-
selves had taken place in our absence.
When men refer to the curse of drink,
they usually exempt cider, but our un-
doing was due to nothing else. Let us
begin at the beginning.
You will recollect that, arriving in
France at the end of February and
having rushed from place to place,
trying to poke our nose into this battle,
we eventually took over our private
stretch of trench at the end of March.
One's conception of “the trenches"
was then merely a dotted line; when
we got to them we found this was just
about correct. We knew we were in
them, because we were so informed on
| the best authority, but there was little
to show for it except here and there a
large hole with an adequate water
ration at the bottom of it, now and
then a sandbag affording cover for the
feet and ankles, and an occasional piece
of fascine, protecting one from the gaze
of the curious if not from the bullet of
the spitefully inclined. It only re-
mained for us, we were humorously
told, to “improve.” This we set about
to do, applying such principles of build-
ing without materials as we could re-
member from Robinson Crusoe and
BARRIE’s Admirable Crichton; utilis-
ing the services of our men, who, given
picks and shovels, could turn the Earth
inside out in a week, and having for
inspiration the missiles of our interfer-
ing friends the Germans. If you ever
want to make bricks without straw (or
with straw, for that matter), tell your
labourers what you want and then set
someone on to shoot at them from a
distance of about ninety yards; you'll
socn have all the bricks you want.
Eventually there appeared a breast-
work lane which, allowing for the
absence of lifts and the shortage of
electric light, I may at least describe
as eligible. Some great man of the
--
engineering department inspected us
and praised us. To the officers, who are
brain-workers merely and gullible, this
was a pleasure and an incentive, but
with the men, who shift the soil and are
unused to praise, it aroused suspicion.
Had they been allowed to have their
way, they would have done no more
and left it at that; but our enthusiasm,
being superior in that respect to their
energy, was infinite.
assured, comfort was attempted ; rows
of model dwellings for the men, semi-
detached villas for the officers and bold:
designs in variegated sandbags to catch
the public eye, appeared on all sides.
An enterprising Sergeant-Major's bat-
man mobilized a large tub and took in
washing, while I for my part got out
the plans for a County Court, for the
adjudication of disputes between out-,
going and incoming tenants consequent
upon the system of battalion reliefs.
It became the habit of all kind old
gentlemen in red hats in or about the
neighbourhood to come along our line,
in its less disturbed moments, and
make extravagant remarks, whereat
the men smiled cynically. I feel at
times that if all officers were sent home
and the whole affair was left to the men
the War would be finished in twenty-
four unbusinesslike but determined
hours. At other times I incline to except
the Platoon-Commanders. This is un-
doubtedly a Platoon-Commander's war.
I am a Platoon-Commander myself.
It was when our servants, having
already the energy of the men, added
to this our enthusiasm, that our ruin
befell. The early régime of the single
one-course meal a day, consisting of
the mere ration, soon gave way to an
elaborate menu; our servants even
went to the length of discovering a
potato-bury in the support trenches
and supplying us with pommes-de-terre
nouvelles long before the p.t.m. season
should properly begin. We took to
sitting on real chairs, eating off real
tables; our captain, on special occasions,
drank from a real tumbler. Once that
desperate but loyal villain, Green,
narrowly missed running into the arms
of a military policeman as he escaped
from those of an infuriated lady of
seventy, whose cottage garden he had
despoiled of its fairest roses. Don't,
however, underrate this cook of ours;
he may have the looks and some of the
gifts of a professional burglar, but he
has also gentler arts. He has since
fed, by invitation, off the generosity of
that brave lady, and so, I am told,
have we. -
We lacked only a cellar. The wine
of the country is as disappointing as
its coffee; our fellows bethought them
of cider, purchased a barrel, and, re-
Safety being
gardless of the pain and shame involved,
trundled “same" in a perambulator to
the trenches. The first cool draught
was being drawn when the nicest and
oldest nice old gentleman of all, in quite
the reddest hat, blew in . . .
No, there were no cross words or
frowns even. In fact the tumbler was
produced and Distinction drank our
health. Later we were addressed,
publicly, as follows:– “The improve-
ments you have made are excellent.”
(There was no specific reference to the
wine-list). “We are sorry to part with
you, even for a period while you carry
on your good work elsewhere. The
return to hard, or deficient, conditions
will merely give you new scope; the
dangers will inspire you to even greater
success. If you find your new place a
hot one, you will, we are sure, leave it
as comfortable. We look forward to
seeing you, all of you” (this with a brave
smile), “back again shortly.” That,
Charles, is what comes to you for
discovering perambulators in the least
likely spots and adapting them to
Bacchic purposes. Old Adam himself
had no harsher words for apples in
general than we had when we arrived
at our new area and found that it
consisted of a bare field, for the moment
occupied by a thunderstorm.
Have you ever coped with the problem
of spending a night in a flooded meadow,
endeavouring to find consolation in the
fact that it is, at any rate, not so bad as
it will be in a couple of hours' time?
There is nothing to do about it; you
must just lie down and go to sleep.
If you stay outside your valise you will
catch a death of cold; if you get inside
your valise a lot of companionable rain
will get in with you. There is no
solution; you sit on your kit trying to
make up your mind what to do; later
you try to make up your mind as to
what you are making up your mind
about. The men, as usual, met the
situation with irrelevant songs, and
the next morning or the next one after
that you wake up to find there are no
such things as rain or colds. I like
this view of the situation now, because
the sun happens to be shining; at the
time, however, I seem to remember
that an air of disapproval prevailed.
I have just been up to look at our new
trench. My Company is in luck; of
the two trenches it is to occupy to-
morrow, one has ceased to exist to-day.
This appears to be a habit, for when I
suggest to the present occupier that it
should be rebuilt, he begs to inform me
that the trench has been rebuilt . . .
twice daily for the last month or so.
It looks as if I shall have something
to tell you next time I write. -
Yours ever, HENRY.

OUR VOLUNTEER CORPS.
By A WILLAGER.
OUR fine old warrior, Major Chrustie,
of Tiffin Lodge, raised it, and is its
commandant. He is patriotic in heart,
soul and cellar, and to hear him de-
nounce the Huns saves fuel in cold
weather. He found an able secretary
and recruiter in Green, our auctioneer,
who, being an expert in pinching and
appraising cattle, is just, the man for
gauging human physique. He soon
roped in the early spring and late
autumn of Larkfield manhood, a big
platoon strong. He even got me,
though my game leg won't go far side-
ways, and I can never hope to form
fours properly (on which I understand
victory in the field so much depends).
We have had a hard training, includ-
ing a special sermon from our Vicar,
and are already widely known as the
Larkfield Dare-Devils.
Now our contemptible neighbour,
Sloshley, has a Volunteer Corps too,
but it is nothing to ours. We have
tunics — they haven't ; we march
smartly—they flop about anyhow; we
have been promoted to aim at the
running perambulator drawn by a long
rope—they are still in the haystack
stage. I intrude this trivial subject of
Sloshley only because we went out to
fight them last Saturday afternoon.
The Major of course led us, and a brave
show we made when we “debauched ”
(I believe that is the correct military
term) on to the road to Wild Heath,
where the battle was to take place
under the eye of a real Colonel of Terri-
torials. His fife and bugle band kindly
played us part of the way; after that,
those of us who could whistle whistled,
and to this stirring accompaniment we
completed the four-mile journey to the
Heath like so many Alpine Chasseurs,
all of us having, by advice, soaped our
socks and boraxed our toes for three
days beforehand.
At the Heath we were met by the
Colonel.
“This your infantry?” he inquired
of our Major.
“Yes, Sir.”
“Where are your machine guns?”
“On this piece of paper, Sir.”
“Very good; post them in what you
think is the most strategic position,
and your troops too.”
So the Major fastened the guns to
a strategic gatepost with a safety-pin.
Then he spread us out along an adja-
cent hedge and ditch, and ordered us
to lie: down and try to look as if we
weren't there. - -
There we lay for what seemed a
week, rifles firmly grasped, straining at
the leash. No word was uttered, except
when the nettles became intolerable,
and then only one. All this time
Sloshley never came near, the pol-
troons! At the long last, however, the
Colonel galloped back and shook our
Major heartily by the hand.
“I congratulate you on your victory,”
he said.
“What victory Sir?” exclaimed the
puzzled Major; “we have never stirred
or seen a soul.”
“Oh, that's all right," was the reply,
“the battle was won by the superior
disposition of your machine-guns. Your
opponents had placed theirs where they
could only fire on themselves!”
So, exulting, we turned our faces and
marched back towards Larkfield, home
and beauty. Only one man fell out
(into a passing cart), having used the
wrong soap for his socks.

THE MAN IN EARNEST.
AFTER lunch we gather in the
smoke-room for a peaceful half-
hour. It is a cheerful time. If
we talk about the War, it is only
to circulate the most pleasant
rumours. Great moves by the X
Army in the region of Y; huge
numbers of captured submarines in
the harbour of Z. (Even the Censor
cannot object to that). And then
cheered by this friendly meeting we go
back to our labour of producing khaki
or war export articles, of pushing the
War Loan, or of converting our plough-
share stamping machines so that they
may produce shell caps.
We should be quite happy were it
not for Bromley. Bromley belongs to
that peculiarly aggressive type of man
born early in 1874. The first six
months of 1874 were prolific in warriors.
It is most unfortunate for the country
that they are all now just over military
age, otherwise the Germans would never
stand a chance. Well, we are all quite
cheerful till Bromley enters.
A TIP FROM MR. WASON.
[Mr. CATHCART WAsoN asked the CHANCELLOR of
THE Exchequer whether he would reconsider his
decision with reference to vouchers of smaller amount
than five shillings for such purposes as “administering
gratuities."]
Saturday I was up at the golf links.
It seemed to be a case of pleasure as
usual. The club house was quite full,
though I will say that many of them
had the grace to go out when I talked
about the necessity for national earnest-
ness. Then on Sunday the Portsmouth
Road was literally crammed with motor-
cars. When I think of the grim
determination of Germany I can see
nothing but ruin before us. Our
Government" — and then Bromley
would let himself go about the Govern-
ment. Strange as it may seem we
don't like abuse of the Government,
though a year since we were saying
things which must have made LLOYD
GEORGE's and CARson's ears burn.
- Every day, the earnest wet-banket
would come, till at last the smoke-room
went on strike. We arranged a plan
and waited expectantly for Bromley.
He came in grim as usual, seated him-
self, scowled on the frivolous, said
“Nothing in war-time, William,” to the
waiter (though he never took anything
in peace-time) and was about to dwell
on the extraordinary slackness of the
British public when Dobbins tackled
him. . . .
“Look here, Bromley,” he said, “we
all think it would be better if you took
the War a little more in earnest"
(Bromley turned almost apoplectic).
“According to your own account you
are golfing, motoring and doing the
halls as usual—all of course because
you want to see if the nation is slacking.
It's not gocq enough. The nation
doesn't need your supervising eye.
Come down with me and join
the Specials. Or go with Harrop
there and be a Red Cross orderly.
You could scrub floors if they
wouldn't trust you with anything
more important. Or let Craven
book you as taking ten thousand
of the War Loan. He "d stand
cigars round if you'd do that.”
“It's this frivolous spirit that
will ruin England,” began Brom-
ley. . “Nobody is in earnest * *
“What you've got to bother
about,” interrupted Craven, “is
getting more earnestness into
yourself, Bromley. You're only
earnest about other people being
in earnest. Be earnest enough
to knock six months off your age
and tell a good straightforward lie
for your country. Why, under
present circumstances G E or GE
WASHINGTON would have lied and
his father would have patted him
on the head for it.”
Bromley rose to his feet and
strode out of the smoke-room.
Then Craven said a bitter thing:
“I believe that man on the sly is
a leader-writer.”
Another Impending Apology.
“London, Friday.—The Central News is
authorised to announce the engagement of the
Hon. Ivy Gordón Lennox and the Marquis of
Titchfield, son and heir of the Duke of Port-
land. * --
Lots of women give more thought to the

Jimmy says the butcher's boy wants
to buy his bloodhound, Faithful; he
! wants to have him stuffed. It was
because Faithful had been studying
spiders and how they did it.
You see Jimmy's bloodhound had
| been sleeping on the lawn, with all the
windows open because it was so hot,
and when he went back to his kennel
Jimmy says he found a spider had
bunged up the entrance with a web.
Jimmy says Faithful sat and looked
at the web, and then pushing his head
into the middle waggled it about and
tried to look like a bluebottle.
Jimmy says that when the spider saw
its success it could hardly believe any
of its eyes at first, and then it made a
flying leap and landed with all its feet
| in the middle of Faithful's back. Jimmy
| says the spider ran along as hard as it
| could, and was just letting itself down
| hand over fist from the end of Faithful's
| tail when Faithful caught sight of it.
Jimmy says Faithful tried to wag
the spider off, but it only made it swing
backwards and forwards, and it was all
Faithful could do to keep time with his
head so as not to take his eye off it.
Jimmy says Faithful tried to twirl the
spider, but it gave him a crick in the
neck watching it, so he decided to

say. and it's because they keep one eye

: Jimmy says Faithful stalked the
|spider round and round, slowly at first,
gradually working up to top speed
until he was doing well over thirty;
then he jambed on the brakes suddenly
and swung round on his own base so as
to meet the spider coming the other
way.
The butcher's boy stopped to watch
Faithful. Jimmy says everyone knows
the butcher's boy because he has got
red hair and wears a blue apron, and
when he washes his face he looks like
the French flag, and then you have only
got to whistle the Marseillaise to get
him to fight you.
When the butcher's boy saw Faithful
pursuing himself, he said he had seen
sheep like that, and it was because they
had a worm in their heads.
Faithful never caught the spider, and
it made him think more of spiders and
their ways than ever; he couldn't
manage to spin a web, no matter how
he wagged his tail.
Jimmy says the butcher's boy got
very friendly with Faithful. He al-
ways greeted Jimmy's bloodhound
every morning. He would say, “Good
gracious, there it is again,” or simply
“Help!!" One day Faithful was
sitting on the wall looking into the
road and wondering how he could make
a web to catch German spies, when the
butcher's boy stopped to admire him.
He told Jimmy he had often seen people
look like Faithful; it was when they
wanted to sneeze and couldn't. He
then made a noise like a dog that has
been bitten by a wasp, and Faithful fell
off the wall into the road. -
Jimmy says the butcher's boy had a
basket fixed on to the front of a bicycle
and he told Jimmy he was taking Mrs.
Jones's ribs, Mr. Brown's liver and
chops, and Mr. Smith's kidneys to them
because they wanted them.
Jimmy says when the butcher's boy
started to ride off Faithful kept jump-
ing up to kiss him good-bye. Faithful
wouldn't leaveoff, Jimmy says, although
the butcher's boy kept bending down to
try to blow him away.
It made the butcher's boy laugh, and
then he tried to ride as fast as he could
so as to leave Faithful behind. Jimmy
says he might have done it if he hadn't
run into a boy wheeling a barrow.
Jimmy says º was surprised
except Faithful, and he just selected

he was discontented with the butcher

ribs at him. He then gave the basket
a good kick and began to whistle the
Marseillaise.
Jimmy says several people stopped
to watch the fight, because it was dis-
graceful, they said. There were two old
gentlemen who had come out of their
gardens to say how disgraceful it was.
One of them showed the other a mark
on his knuckle where a boy had once
lost a tooth, and the other said he had
once fought twenty rounds and his nose
never would be quite straight again.
Jimmy says the butcher's boy was a
good fighter, he fought with his head,
and when he did it Jumbo used his
weight to sit down.
Jimmy says Jumbo had been trying
put his hair out and threw Mrs. Jones's
One of the old gentlemen showed
Jumbo how to side-step very quickly,
until the man standing behind told him
not to.
The man standing behind the old
gentleman was telling him how you go
home and put ice on your head, when a
motor-bicycle came round the corner
and told everyone to move right away
ever so far quickly.
Jimmy says the motor managed to
dodge the barrow and would have
| cleared the bicycle if it hadn't skidded
on Mr. Brown's liver. Jimmy says you
have to practise a lot before you can
turn on people's livers, and the man
made an awful mess of it.
Jimmy says that the motor-bicycle
buzzed about like anything, and old
|Faithful came rushing out to have a
| look at his luck.
Jimmy says they had to carry the
motor-man into a house to put water
on him to bring him round, and as they
were carrying him he suddenly opened
his eyes and said, “Was giebt es #"
One of the old gentlemen got very
excited at this, Jimmy says; he shouted
out, “He’s sprekkening Dutch,” and he
said to the motor-man, “Sprekke Sie
| Dutch,” and the motor-man said, “Neim,”
and went off again.
Jimmy says everyone was very pleased
with everyone else, but no one praised
Faithful; in fact no one said a word to
Faithful except the butcher's boy, and
he only inquired how much it would
cost to have him stuffed. Jimmy says
it was enough to make a bloodhound
give up the spy-trail.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Mr. B. PAUL NEUMAN is one of the exiguous group of
persons who have reason for gratitude towards WILLIAM
THE FRIGHTFUL. Because if it had not been for the War
I fail to see how any suitable end could ever have been
reached in Oliver (SMITH, ELDER), while, as things are, the
end, if perhaps a little mechanical and arbitrary, is at least
appropriate. Oliver might be called a study in paternity.
Perhaps you recall how Mr. NEUMAN has already done
well with the same theme; it is one that seems a deserved
favourite of his. Oliver is the story of a weak man, first in
his relations with his father, then with his own son. The
thing is remarkably well done, a close and unsparing treat-
ment of a subject by no means easy. The hard undemon-
strative father, and the nervous boy who never quite
understands him, have, of course, appeared before in fiction;
where the present story breaks new ground is in showing
the morbid weakling, himself a parent, haunted still by his
old fears, and, to his bewildered and almost worshipping
delight, finding in his own son the strong dependable
personality that he himself could never attain. The scenes
between grown-up Oliver and Roland seem to me both
sincere and profoundly moving. It may possibly be
objected by the severe that there is some excess of senti-
H ment, especially in the end. But life is always sentimental
to persons like Oliver. Whether you will believe in him,
suddenly transformed into a motor-transport officer, is
another matter. "You will at least appreciate a great piece of |
writing in the account of his dash through an enemy patrol
on his way to what he thought would be his boy's death-
bed; young Roland, also serving, having been reported
dangerously wounded. And after all it was Oliver who
died in his son's arms. True or not, this makes a fine end
to an original and successful story.
Mr. SIDNEY Low, a man of parts in matters of high
politics, provides us in The Spirit of the Allied Nations
(BLACK) with a convenient little tabloid of comment and
instruction on the salient forces at work in France, in
Russia, in Belgium, in Serbia, in Japan and in the British
Empire.
(This was before Italy came in). Each nation
is allotted its own expert, and the thing seems to be quite
well done up to the convenient standard of the extension
lecturer. One can't attempt to summarise a summary of
such vast issues, but I think that the normal reader will get
most joy from the account of little Serbia, who so tactfully
obliged the Austrians, when setting out on their punitive
expedition, by themselves doing the punishing, smashing
methodically first the Austrian's right, then the centre, and |
finally the left, with losses to the enemy of 38,000 dead,
92,000 wounded, and 62,000 prisoners. It is not a story
that anybody in later ages will find easy to believe. .
And that speech of the old King to his soldiers goes far to
blot out a terrible memory. It is also good to learn of the

splendid comradeship in their army, officers summoning
their men to fight, not as men but as brothers. Yes, cer-
tainly, altogether a fine little ally to have.
If you do not take the precaution to read Mr. MARMADUKE
PickTHALL's preface to Tales from Five Chimneys (MILLs
AND Boon) the title may not unnaturally bewilder you.
The simple explanation is that Mr. PICKTHALL, having
written a number of stories entirely unconnected with each
other, was at a loss for a generic name, and so called them
after the house whence they were indited. Personally, I
think he might have done better, especially as the tales
themselves are as good of their kind as I remember to have
met in a great while. There is in all a vigorous and uncon-
ventional air of honesty about people and events that is
excellently refreshing. For an instance I might refer you
to one called “The Prude and the Wanton,” an exquisitely
life it reflects is already as extinct as the dodo. But
for this very reason I shall the more look forward to
her next.
I found The Record of Nicholas Freydon: an Auto-
biography (CoNSTABLE) a very pleasant literary puzzle.
The editor's prefatory note, modestly assuring me that any
defects were his own, any virtues his friend's, of course
made me assume a fake in the consecrated manner of these
things; and that impression was not removed by “Freydon's"
own introduction. But when he charmingly set down the
memories of his childhood, of his father and of their voyage
out from England to Australia, I said to myself, “But this
reads true.” And yet again I couldn't quite see in their
life in the derelict barque Livorno on a deserted shore any-
thing but a fancy; the convent orphanage did not convince
me (the avarice of the sisters I could believe but not their
human study of a simple-minded
old governess summoned to give
evidence, in the divorce case of a
pupil whom she loved and trusted.
It is possible that these stories
have appeared before in magazine'
form, but I think it unlikely; º
they certainly bear no evidence
of the manipulation that secures
a happy ending and the subscrip-
tions of a serial public. Of a
book of this kind, where there is
no one theme to describe, I can
only tell you that I found the
whole of unusual quality, and .

When a novel is called by
some such title as Plain Jill
One can at least say of The Jealous Goddess (LANE) that
it begins unconventionally. A hero who in an inefficient
attempt to rescue a young woman from some roughs gets
so battered by them that he has to be rescued himself by
the fair one, and, on being assisted to her studio, promptly
faints on the mat, certainly breaks new ground. Of course,
though, for all this transposition of the ordinary gambit, I
couldn't be greatly surprised when Nora and Tommy fell
each into the other's arms. But Miss MADGE MEARs had
several more unconventionalities up her sleeve. For one
thing, the relations between Tommy and his shiftless but
amiable father are new. So is the treatment by Tommy
and Nora of their offspring, with whom they were so
frankly bored that they very gladly accepted the offer of
adoption made by a childless actress, who is not only the
kindest but much the best drawn character in the book.
Most startling novelty perhaps of all is that Tommy,
though a dramatist, is left at the end without an income of
five figures. He must, I think, be almost the sole example
of this in fiction. Anyhow, Miss MEARs—whose name is
new to me—seems a writer with a pleasant knack of
leaving the trodden paths, and this may carry her far.
Her book was quite obviously written before last July; the
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), it is the new War Loan to a
gooseberry that the heroine, if not strictly beautiful, is to
be mightily attractive. But Jill, bless her, in possessing
remarkable and distinctly attractive eyes, a lovable smile,
extremely fine teeth and a healthy complexion, got rather
more compensations for her bluntish nose and nondescript
chin than I expected. Indeed her “plainness” did not
prevent her from perforating the hearts of an Earl and an
American millionaire. Possibly Jill will be a little too
successful and perfect for everyone's taste, but all the same
she is a delightful creation, and if you can bear a simple
love-story, with only a faint dash of psychical interest
thrown in, I recommend Mrs. PENDERED's book to your
notice. And I will add that, in contrast to the fictional
duchesses I have lately been compelled to meet, the Duchess
of Maccleugh is quite reasonably like a human being.

MORE SORROWS OF THE SULTAN.
SoMETIMEs, when most I realise the blunder
That fixed the Faithful in their present plight,
I put myself the question, why in thunder
I joined this rotten fight.
Why for a WILLIAM's beaur yeur did I sally
Forth to a quest that wasn't Turkey's show 2
What am I doing in this noisome galley 2–
That's what I want to know.
I saw which side my bread was moist with butter;
Noticed the obverse (which I chose) was dry;
Why then did I take on this silly flutter?
I can't imagine why.
I knew our priceless gift for double-dealing;
I knew the wisdom which was once Stamboul's;
Yet—and the sore place doesn't look like healing—
I fell between two stools.
For, if we lose—I bid good-bye to Europe,
Or win—to Liberty farewell I say;
In any case I entertain a poor hope
Of making this thing pay.
Meanwhile, when Christian Bosch meets Christian
Briton,
Then is the tug of war for my poor Turks,
Who fight the latter, but would love to sit on
- WILLIAM and all his works.
Slaves of that Lord, by alien drivers mastered—
Forward or backward still one fate they find,
For either by the foe in front they're plastered
Or y the Hun behind
This comes of following ENVER (who's a heretic);
But why I did it, when I knew quite well
The moment for inaction—to the very tick—
Allah alone can tell! O. S.
MY CONSOL.
HE came to me many years ago in my capacity as a
residuary legatee, since when we have been very happy
together, Clarence (my Consol) and I. I have watched
over his early training and education, and have done my
best to influence him for good and to guide his tastes in
the right direction, as every conscientious guardian should.
The days of his youth were passed in a cash-box, which
reposed in my Jacobean roll-top desk, and every Saturday
night I would take him out—out of his box, I mean—and
talk to him like a-like a residuary legatee. But the time
came when I judged it best to send him away. He was
growing up, and there was his future to consider. For
long I hesitated; but I finally made up my mind that he
was best fitted to occupy a position in a bank, and in due
course, after he had successfully passed the preliminary
examination, I entered Clarence at Cox and Co.'s. Never
shall I forget the day upon which I handed him over to
their care. “Good-bye, Clarence,” I said, with a lump in
my throat; “good-bye! I've done the best I can for you.
I hope you'll be industrious and grow up to be a great and
good Consol, and a credit to our National Debt. I hope—”
Here I burst into tears, and they led me gently out.
Clarence settled down comfortably and happily. Cox's
wrote to me from time to time to say that he was still there
and giving no trouble, and even to this day I regularly
hear from Clarence himself four times a year—on January
5th (to wish me a prosperous New Year), on April 5th
(opening of the Quarter Sessions), on July 5th (anniversary
of the French occupation of Algiers, 1830), and October 5th
(high water at London Bridge 10.42 A.M.).
But now I hear that there is an opportunity for him to
be taken over by the Government, and I am torn between
affection and duty. For, though he is no longer under my
roof, he is still under my residuary legateeship, and my
consent is necessary before this proposed change in his
condition can be effected. Clarence himself has no parti-
cular views of his own on the matter. He leaves it
entirely to me, and I confess that I scarcely feel equal to
the responsibility of making this momentous decision for
him. I should hate to lose Clarence. We have been in
touch so long, have faced so many ups and downs together,
that I feel that we should not be parted at this time of
crisis in the nation's destiny.
I remember how at one period Clarence went through a
dreadful time. So bad was he that The Times published
daily bulletins about him. “Consols [and by Consols you
must understand Clarence] developed a sudden weak-
ness . . . Consols improved slightly . . . Consols dropped
away throughout the day . . . Consols rallied and fell
back again, closing very weak.” One day Clarence even
sagged. It was dreadful. I passed a sleepless afternoon.
I pictured the Commissioners of the National Debt sitting
round poor Clarence, watching with grave faces for him to
sag his last. I thought of wiring to them, imploring them
to administer oxygen at my expense. And then—joy! I
read on an Evening News placard, “Sharp Recovery of
Consols,” and 1 knew then that Clarence was spared to me.
And now I am faced with the problem—shall Clarence
remain the bright, happy, unsophisticated Consol he
always was, or be taken over by the Government and
turned into a War Loan 2 Personally, I feel that he will
do best in the shape in which Nature designed him. As a
Consol, he has an ancestry, and I, as his guardian,
naturally take a fair measure of pride in the fact, for he
forms part and parcel of our world-famous British Consti-
tution. How often have I thought in the past of that
glorious moment when I may some day meet the CHAN-
CELLoR of THE Exchequer at a Guildhall banquet, and
we can fall into an intimate discussion on Clarence and
his family With what pride I shall deftly introduce
Clarence into the conversation “Talking about National
finance . . . May I trouble you to pass the chutney? . .
Thanks very much . . . Talking about National finance, Mr.
McKENNA, I am sure you will be glad to hear that I take
an active personal interest in the welfare of a bright and
promising young Consol. Tell me, as man to man, what
are the prospects for next quarter's dividend ? I suppose
it will be declared as usual, or do you think of allocating it
to the reserve?” On the other hand Cox's say that as a
War Loan Clarence ought to make his mark in the world;
that in ten years or, at the most, thirty, he will be able to
retire at his par value paid in solid gold. But, be that as
it may, I feel that I can never take the same proprietary
interest in Clarence in this new guise. There will be no
pleasure when I meet Mr. McKENNA in telling him that I
have at heart the welfare of a promising and democratic
young Democratic / That's it! Why, everybody
holds War Loan. The cook, the housemaid, the scullery-
maid—all are investors. I've even bought a voucher for the
cat. No, no, Clarence, my first and only residuary legacy,
you shall ever remain a fine old Conservative Consol.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As an inventor
who has been shamefully neglected by
this short-sighted Government (for in
any time of crisis I am always full of
fruitful suggestion; that is my tempera-
ment), I trust you will allow me space to
offer a few notions. I have been turning
my attention to the Post Office Depart-
ment of the War Loan. It is just the
requires shaking up by people of
imagination.
One of my ideas is the institution of
Penny-in-the-Slot Machines for the sale
of vouchers at every street corner, where
any passer-by (with sixty pennies in his
pocket) would find them readily ac-
cessible. The idea might be developed
by introducing Voucher-in-the-Slot
Machines, from which, by the insertion
of a sufficient number of vouchers, a
Bond could be obtained.
Then we must have Adhesive
Vouchers, for use on picture-postcards.
These should be endorsed “A Present
from Pitlochry” (or whatever was the
place of issue), and might even be set
off by small photographic views. By
going a short step further we should
sort of case where the Government
|surely be able to enlist the philatelist
and make him do his bit. It is only
necessary to keep on producing a rapid
succession of new voucher forms, differ-
ing in colour, texture and shape, or
containing ingenious printers' errors,
making at the same time all old issues
obsolete, and it is certain that some-
one will begin to collect them. With
intelligent encouragement from the
Treasury—in the form of special albums
—it might grow into a big thing in
time. If only we could get them
loved for their own sake it would be
a great point.
And we want to stir up rivalry. If it
once became the thing, for instance, to
paper the drawing-room with vouchers
(as a memento of the Great War), or
even to use them for newspaper
wrappers, we should have made a
great advance. We need more of the
fine spirit of the Australian millionaires
of whom one used to read, who would
burn fivers against each other by way
of competition.
Then we must have a Day. Every
one is agreed that we do not have
nearly enough Days. Even now as
much as a week elapses sometimes with-
with flags and collecting boxes. So let
us have a Voucher Day, when no self-
respecting citizen will be able to walk
the streets in peace without a voucher
in his button-hole and two in his hat.
It is simply a question of getting to
work on the right lines.
I am, Yours faithfully,
THE INVENToR AT LARGE.

THE OPTIMIST.
“WHAT I stand on,” said Mr. Brad-
shaw with a smile that was too radiant
to be convincing, “is the power—”
But Mrs. Bradshaw had walked into
the kitchen and closed the door.
In a minute or two her head emerged,
and Mr. Bradshaw snatched at it (so to
speak) as his only chance of getting his
remarks finished.
“You’ve only got to look at it the
right way and it will be all right.
That is the idea. Any dead fish can
float with the current, but it takes a
live fish to swim up-stream.”
Mrs. Bradshaw's eyes flashed
contempt. “Thank you,” she
said curtly. “But I'll have you
to understand that I'm not a
dead fish.” She was trembling
with an emotion on the verge of
tears. “I know the bacon was
overdone—it doesn't take that
smile of yours to teach me how
to cook bacon. The child cried
all night, and I have to be on
my feet all day. It's not what
you stand on, it's what I stand
on.” -
“Ah !” said Mr. Brºw.
“It seems tiring, that's all. Stand
as I do,” he hesitated, “as I try
to do, on Joshua and CALEB.
Ten of them, you know, Maria,
came back with hard-luck stories,
but Joshua and CALEB brought
grapes. That's you and I in a
nutshell.”
“Joshua and CALEB, nor you
neither, George, hadn't been up
all night with a teething baby—
that would teach you what you
stood on.” f :
“I do beg of you, Maria, to be
an optimist,” said Mr. Bradshaw
earnestly, ignoring the personall-
question. “It would alter your views
of life.”
“It wouldn't alter my views of a
screaming baby,” said Mrs. Bradshaw
obstinately. . . . .
“It is so simple,” said her husband
hurriedly, as he saw the kitchen door
opening to swallow her up. “You
only have to keep smiling in the face
of trouble, and pass the smile along—
and how can I pass it along when
there's no one to get it?”
“No one wants it,” said Mrs. Brad-
shaw with temper. “Keep it to your-
self, and much good may it do you.' I
never saw a smile that was worth the
rocker on a cradle yet; and I haven't
time to argue. Go and be an optimist
by yourself!”
The kitchen door closed finally and
Mr. Bradshaw was left outside.
Automatically, the smile faded and
something older, but infinitely more
human, took its place. It almost
seemed as if the weight of that porten-
tous smile was unbearable. To smile
and pass it on had seemed such an easy
way of eluding trouble; but what
happened when you couldn't pass it
on 2 The club offered no advice on
that subject.
And under Mr. Bradshaw's thatch
of stiff fair hair a thought had been
slowly growing and maturing, which
could not be disregarded any longer.
It was there before him at the office-
Recruiting Sergeant. “WELL, MY MAN, would YoU
LIKE To SERVE THE KING”

THINK HE'd wanT A DAY 2 I suppose AS MUCH

Maria was a trump, and, as she said,
what was there to smile at 2 No more
false gaiety, no more pretence. With
a lighter heart and an unsmiling face
he ran up the steps of his house and
flung the door wide open, and just
inside, her hair a mass of twists and
curls, with a smile only stopped by her
ears, stood Maria with the baby in her
arms. Before he had time to speak,
her words flew out at him.
“You were quite right, George. I'm
going to be an optimist too. It's the
only way. Smile at trouble, and pass
the smile on, even if it is a crying
baby. Let it cry!”
| And the baby responded eagerly,
whilst George stood in the middle
of the passage in a horror-struck
silence.
“Any dead fish,” the words
rang brightly above the uproar,
“can float with the current, but
it takes a live one to-"
But George spoke breathlessly.
“I can't bear it, Maria; do any-
thing you like, cry or be cross,
but for God's sake don't smile.”
| “There's no pleasing you,”
she said faintly. Then with a
fading smile and anxicus blue
eyes, she came near and put her
arms close round his neck.
“I know,” she said. “You
needn't tell me, George; I see it
in your face. You've enlisted.”
He did not try to swim up-
stream, he only held her a little
| tighter, and said over and over
again, “You see, Maria, it's my
duty. It's got me, and I had to.
All those pictures upset me, and
the chaps out there, and me here.
It's a bit of a wrench, Maria,
but I'm an Englishman and I'd
got to do it.”
And Maria, still with her arms
round his neck, and his cheek

He had meant to speak to Maria
about it, but the right moment did not"

in a broken voice, “Well, there's some
use in smiling now. It seemed so silly

worry over, and just the usual things to
do, but now there's some sense in it,

ECONOMY.
I HAD just received a polite but dis-
trustful letter from my bank, and a
circular printed in red from the rate
collector, and I was in a mood therefore
to read in my paper a few bright hints
on “How to Economise.”
The references to lentils and potatoes
did not interest me so much as the
really practical advice that told me to
ask, “Do I really need it?” before buy-
ing anything. It seemed to me only
right that I should give this precept a
fair trial, and I began at once.
In Long Acre alone this simple
question deterred me from buyin
thousands of pounds worth of highly
polished motor cars. In the Hay-
market there was a picture—but could
I honestly say that I needed it? As I
passed His Majesty's Theatre a whimsi-
cal notion entered my head; but in the
absence of real need, I said sternly, one
must not in these times lightly indulge
one's passing fancies.

away. I could not altogether shake off
the conviction that circumstances de-
manded that the meal should be taken
in an inexpensive tea-shop. It was
but the work of a moment to find a
shop of this character, and I stood to
scan the menu in the window. Did I
really need tea, per pot 3d., or per
cup, 2d. 2 No, I did not; and when I
came to rissoles, stewed prunes, hot
milk and biscuits (various) there was
no doubt whatever in my mind that
the negative was the honest reply. I

[JULY 21, 1915.
PERMANGANATE OF POTASH.
AFTER my cousin Charles had re-
covered from Spy rash he acquired a
commission in the army. When the
authorities thought that he was ripe
they sent him into the trenches in
France. Charles's wife says that he
got into the trenches on his merits, and
that she did not use her influence to
get him there. He didn't take into
the trenches all the things which his
wife gave him. He mislaid a crate of
oranges, six bath towels, a deck chair,
a portable Turkish bath and a picnic
basket before he left our shores. She
insisted on his taking a box of perman-
ganate of potash; she alleged that it was
a disinfectant and that you can safely
drink quite impure water mixed with
permanganate of potash. Charles
didn't fancy drinking impure water or
permanganate of potash in any form,
but he knew from experience that the
latter is useful for staining floors. He
didn't suppose that anyone worried
much about staining the floors of the
trenches, but he promised to take the
box as a kind of mascot.
Charles was led into the trenches at
night. He found one trench before he
expected it, but he got out all right.
The man he fell on was quite polite
when he found out that Charles was
an officer; he said that his rifle was
scarcely damaged at all. Although the
accommodation wasn't what Charles
was accustomed to, he didn't complain,
as he could see that they had done
their best to make him comfortable.
It isn't a nice idea having your meals
in your bedroom, but even an officer
cannot expect a suite of dug-outs.
When Charles had been introduced
to the officers in residence, he went to
look for his servant who was bringing
up his blankets and kit. While he
was looking for his servant some
Germans had nightmare and let off
their rifles. The bullets went very close
to Charles, and he suddenly remembered
that he had important business with
a brother officer in an adjacent dug-
out. He just had time to instruct a
sergeant to carry on the search. The
sergeant reported that there was a
party looking for a rifle in the moat
at the rear of the trenches. He thought
that the rifle might belong to Charles's
servant as he had noticed some things
that looked like part of an officer's kit
floating about in the moat. He promised
to fish for the kit and the servant after
they had found the rifle. Everything
was recovered, including the servant,
who was quite sober but very wet, like
Charles's kit.
The next morning, after Charles had
shaved, he noticed that he was very
sunburnt. This surprised him, as he
hadn't seen any sun. On investigation
he discovered that nearly all his things,
including his hair, hair-brushes and
shaving-brush, were sunburnt. His
hair and face weren't sunburnt all over
but in patches, and he began to suspect
the permanganate of potash. He had
noticed that his brushes were damp,
and if the light had been better when
he got up he might have saved his hair ||
and face. He thought of painting in ||
the places which the permanganate had
missed, but he didn't care about the
colour sufficiently; there is no scope
for artistic effect in one box of perman-
ganate of potash. He was afraid that
if he was taken prisoner the Germans
might mistake him for an Oriental and
expect him to talk Hindustani. Charles
says that if he had known that he was
going to become piebald he would have
taken some more pigments with him,
and adopted a mixture of colours that
would have made him invisible like a
fort.
The most interesting pastime in the
trenches is sniping. You have a steel
plate to protect your head and a ser-
geant to mark for you. Charles was a
very keen sniper until a bullet hit his
protection-plate close to his ear. He
got bored with sniping after that, and
let the sergeant do it with a corporal
as marker. When alien bullets begin
to hit your protection-plate it always
means that you have done enough snip-
ing for that day at least.
The only other recognised amuse-
ment is digging up bullets which nearly
hit you. Charles got a nice collection;
he thinks that the Germans liked him
and wanted him to take home more
bullets than anyone else. His wife
says that if he hadn't had the perman-
ganate he would have been certain to
be hit. Charles isn't sure about this,
though he admits that it helped him to
get home.
He wasn't altogether sorry when his
Company was relieved; although he
liked the trenches fairly well he didn't
want to stay there indefinitely. The
place was so noisy that he got a head-
ache. When he got out of the trenches
he went to see the battalion Medical
Officer to talk about his headache.
The Medical Officer was busy with
some urgent cases, and recommended
him to the field hospital. The field
hospital had a good deal on hand
and passed him on to a hospital
train. Whilst he was looking for a
doctor on the train someone started
the thing, and it reached Boulogne
before he found one disengaged. The
journey did Charles's head good, and
he forgot what he had wanted to talk
to the doctor about. The doctor was
so interested in Charles's piebald ap-
pearance that he took him on to Folke-
stone, and having taken him out of his
way from idle curiosity he couldn't do
less than recommend him for a fort-
night's sick leave. That is how I came
to hear about the permanganate of
potash without the Censor poking his
nose into the matter.
THE NEW INFERNO.
[A contemporary reminds us that DANTE
is “closely linked with several places now
prominent in the War news,” including the
Trentino, etc., from which he drew many of
his descriptions in the Inferno.] .

Who with fine prophetic power
Sang of sin's appropriate wages
Till it made the tyrant cower—
DANTE, thou in very surety “shouldst

Here the wild Trentino's magic
Might once more commove your
pen
To depict for us the tragic
Destinies of damnéd men;
But you'd cram your hell with Teutons
if you toiled on earth again.
One by one you'd place their chosen |
Leaders 'mid your circles nine
(Whether gaseous, hot or frozen
Would be your affair, not mine),
And the host of common sinners
to their fitting doom assign.
For each Hun, save him I'll mention,
Your old Underworld would do ;
But you'd once more need invention
When you tackled WILHELM Two;
You'd be forced to delve far deeper
for fresh gulfs and circles new.
FROM A BELGIAN GARDEN.
I.

the battery I am requested to write to
you concerning this abode—once yours,
now ours. Yet not entirely ours, for
another battery at present occupies
part of your garden and a portion of

left of it for you to resume, but you
may be pleased to know that it will
probably go down with a name in
history. By the way, what is its name?
The British Army hereabouts calls the
region between the road and the railway
Hell Fire Corner; but you could not
have conceived of it as that. A sergeant
of ours found a board with “Sifflez’’
neatly painted on it, and he thought it
might have come off your front gate
till he discovered it had been blown
from the railway line by a shell, and
was merely a Government direction to
engine-drivers. But it does not matter
much just now.
For the first few nights we were here
everything was quiet and peaceful. The
Germans had evidently overlooked your
house on the map and our exceedingly
business-like occupation of it. Then
one morning the men of subsection B
went bathing in the water hole—ah,
ou won't know; it is a 17-inch shell
hole filled by rain in the field just west
of the house—when a German aero-
plane suddenly appeared and signalled
its discovery of them by dropping a
truly beautiful white star over their
heads. Nothing happened till evening,
and subsection B were beginning to
think the reprimand they had received
was undeserved. But we got it that
evening — shrapnel, high - explosive,
8-inch stink-shell—everything you can
think of.
Your house miraculously escaped
being hit this first evening, but your
garden was ripped up mercilessly. You
remember the fine row of chestnut and
elm trees on the western side, between
the house and the field 2 Several shells
hurtled into them and mutilated them
horribly. One of your pigs was killed
—the cook finished him off with a
revolver. The little hedge on the
Germany side of your house—just
sprouting into a fine young green too—
was rent with gaps, and a noble beech
on the north-eastern corner was clean
felled. The rose-walk, we are all glad
to say, was quite untouched. I must
tell you of that, and why we are so glad
about it.
Our guns are there! still there, and
still whole! More than for the hospi-
tality of your roof, or what was once a
roof, we are grateful to you for that
rose-walk. The man who planned it
was an artist of the first order. It
runs, you remember, under the other
line of elms on the southern side of the
house. We have the guns hidden in that
glorious green arch; and at the foot of
those trees when youreturn you will find
our handsome dug-outs. The screaming
shells which have scorched and scarred
all else in your demesne have never yet
seriously hit this special spot. Perhaps
some accident in the contours between
this and the German guns, 4,000 and
5,000 yards away, serves to protect it.
Perhaps the little china figure, Notre
Dame de Bon Secours, stuck up on a
ledge in the stoutest of these elms,
endures to shield us poor servants of
the Holy Cause hiding in her blessed
vicinity. Whatever it be, your gar-
dener builded better than he knew when
he laid out this southern aspect. When
he is put to repose (long hence, we
hope) in his last garden, may masses
be sung for ever for his soul!
When you return and restore this
charming spot to civilised order, we
would wish you to keep N. D. de Bon
Secours still in her little niche in the
big elm-tree. Do not disturb her.
Most other treasures you will find in
ruins, but she, we know, will be still
serenely unmoved. She and your
gardener are our battery saints, Mon-
sieur !

LADY X. IS INTERVIEWED AS TO HER opinions ON THRIFT IN WAR-TIME.
THE TRAITOR.
It was when I was just recovering
from my spring attack of influenza
that my wife broke the news to me.
“I think you are strong enough
now,” she said, “to be told something
very serious. Mr. Appleby is a pro-
German.”
“Rubbish,” I said.
Appleby all my life.”
My wife shrugged her shoulders.
“Even before you were ill I heard
distressing rumours, and now there is
no doubt about it. He goes about
saying dreadful things.”
“Tell him to come and see me,” I
commanded.
“You can't really mean that.”
“I am not yet strong enough to
stand being contradicted,” I said with
a break in my voice, and she flew to
the telephone.
Punctual to the moment Appleby
arrived. When I saw him last he
looked as though he were sickening for
jaundice. The new Appleby was a rosy-
faced philanthropist, bubbling over with
good spirits to a degree I found posi-
tively exhausting. He greeted me
warmly, and had just settled himself in
the doctor's chair for a heart-to-heart
talk, when the strains of “Rule, Bri-
tannia!" rose falteringly to our ears.
My eldest daughter, instigated, as I
“I’ve known
shrewdly surmised, by her mother, was
the culprit, and poor as was the per-
formance the tune was quite recognis-
able. I glanced nervously at Appleby.
To my surprise he was beating time
gently, his head tilted on one side and
rapture shining in his eyes.
“It's a grand song that,” he ex-
claimed enthusiastically. “Talk of
Die Wacht am Rhein ' "
“But ,” I stammered.
Appleby laughed. “I know what
you are thinking of,” he said happily.
“Listen, and I'll tell you a story. A
short time ago I became a nervous
wreck. Life held no joys for me, and
I could neither sleep nor look forward
to my meals ->
“I tried every specialist in London,”
I put in wearily, completing the
formula, but he disregarded the inter-
ruption and continued in the same
measured tone.
“What I spent on newspapers would
have kept a Pekinese in comfort. But
it was no use. There were never want-
stand it no longer. I thought out a
plan. I read CARLYLE on the glorious
destiny of the Hohenzollerns, and hunted
up back numbers of the dailies in which
we were urged to go to Germany and
learn how to run Old Age Pensions
and National Insurance. And I quoted
these everywhere. The effect was im-
mediate and gratifying. At first my
friends fell away, but I could stand
that ; it was rest I needed. But now,
now they seek me out to tell me that
an enemy submarine has been sunk off
the Scillies or that the CRowN PRINCE
is in the Tower. They cross the street,
and risk losing their trains to give me
pleasurable scraps of information. My
day is one triumphal progress; I hear
nothing but good news now; and look
at me !
“It does them good, too,” he went
on after a pause. “The mere sight of
me promotes cheerfulness; and the
memory of the sorrow they have caused
my traitorous heart brightens the rest
of the day for them.” He beamed upon
ing well-informed persons to point out
to me that what I took for successes
were really grave errors in strategy.
And they kept telling me awful stories
of bombs smuggled in biscuit tins on
board our Dreadnoughts, and of German
agents among our army cooks.” He
shuddered even at the recollection.
“But the time came when I could
me and held out his hand.
“The hand of a traitor,” he said.
“Will you shake?”
I shook.
“The Grouse Bill, which had been taken
over by the Government, was also passed.”
So now, let us hope, the grousers will
be satisfied.

TO ANTHONY TROLLOPE.
(On re-reading his Barsetshire Novels.)
Good chronicler of Barset, weaver of genial yarns,
Homely and unaffected as the verse of the Dorset BARNES,
When the outlook is depressing, when journals bleat and
Scare, - -
I turn to your kindly pages and find oblivion there.
You lead us back from the turmoil of these unhappy days
To the land in which our fathers went their untroubled
ways; - - - -
When gigs were still in fashion and no one was able to
SCOur -
The countryside in motors at seventy miles an hour.
Down Time's gulf backward roaming, with you as our
friendly guide,
To the age of flounces and whiskers and crinolines we glide,
When life flowed on like a brooklet with many a bicker and
brawl - -- ~~ -
And many a swirl and ripple, but never a roaring fall.
You weren't concerned with problems that harass and
wound and vex, - - .
Or with the elemental eternal duel of sex;
The Feminist virago had not swum into your ken,
And you had no fads or hobbies to further with your pen.
But a wholesome love of England shone bright through all
your tales— * * -
Love of her mellow landscape and green sequestered vales,
Love of her ancient homesteads and gray ancestral towers,
Lawns and meadows and gardens bright with old-fashioned
flowers. º
And, though with the fires of passion your stories seldom
glowed,
That virtue need not be insipid they very clearly showed;
For life in those placid regions was not all cakes and ale,
And love brought sore disquiet to your charming Lily Dale.
Yet, while discreetly checkered with sorrow and even crime,
Your stories mostly ended to the tune of the marriage chime,
For you held with good CHARLEs DARWIN that a novelist
worth his salt
Eschewed an unhappy ending as a quite incurable fault.
As a satirist of the clergy you served a laudable end,
For we recognise that faithful are the wounds that are
dealt by a friend; * -
You scarified the pompous and yet delighted to paint
In the meek unselfish Warden a thoroughbred modern saint.
With you the religion of weekdays, and not the Sunday best,
Alike for cleric and layman was much the truest test;
You had no special 'doxy, but many a lance you broke
On behalf of plain God-fearing unfashionable folk.
And your dramatis persona had brains of every size,
For you loved the simple and stupid as well as the witty
and wise;
And some of your rarest figures were moulded of common
clay, - -
And º of your high-born ladies had the meanest parts
in the play. -
Then, O ye precious penmen, who furiously rage
Against the “moral serfdom" of the mid-Victorian age,
Lauding your modern idols who make their genius plain
In an infinite capacity for giving their readers pain—
Go wallow at will in your garbage, mean, sinister or smart,
And prate till your jaws are weary of Art for the sake of
Art,
You cannot abate my freedom to wander far and wide
In the pleasant land of Barset by Father ANTHoNY's side.
IN KENSINGTON SOUARE.
I Don't wish to sail under false colours, so I may as well
say at once that this is going to be an appeal—an appeal
both for sympathy and for money. Before, however, I
proceed to make it I will enter into an agreement with the
millions who read Mr. Punch. If I succeed at all in my
attempt to convince them that I have a good object at
heart, why then they must send along their money. If, on
the other hand, I fail, they can keep their cheques in the
drawer and their War Loan vouchers in the safe with a
clear conscience. I am sure I shall win, not because I
am confident in my skill, but because my object is so
undeniably excellent. Is it a bargain? Very well, then.
It was on a bright afternoon a short time ago that I
found myself in an old house of the Queen Anne period
in Kensington Square. Somebody or something must, I
suppose, have urged me to go. At any rate there I was,
looking into a narrow little room, in which was sitting the
queerest little old lady, dressed in a beautiful dress of stiff
brocade, with very high heels to her buckled shoes, and
wearing her hair thickly powdered. At my sudden appear-
ance she rose, regarding me with no very amiable air.
“How now, Sir 2" she said. “What means this conduct 2
Is a lady not to be safe from intrusion in her own room,
the only one now left to her of the many she once
inhabited 2 'Tis but a powder-closet, I know, but even in
so narrow a cell I still have liberty to choose my visitors.”
It was plain she was angry, but in her anger, as in her
whole aspect, there was something at once courtly and
unsubstantial. It seemed as though a rough breath might
blow her away. I stammered out such excuses as came into
my head on the spur of the moment, and was about to
withdraw when she stopped me.
“Hold, Sir,” she said. “You erred in ignorance, and I
pardon you, as you on your side will, I doubt not, pardon
the rough words of an old woman made testy by time.
The truth is that this house is by my leave consecrated to
a great and beneficent work. Not a room in it but is filled
with its party of busy women daily giving their time and
the labour of their hands to the achievement of their tasks.
Even here—she pointed to the floor of the powder-closet,
which was heavily littered with heaps of tow—“even here
there is an overflow from their work, but 'tis not for me to
reproach them with it. Rather I rejoice.”
“But what,” I said, “is the use of tow 2"
“'Tis to help the poor soldiers broke in the War. 'Tis
not enough to make a splint for a broken limb; the splint
must be padded with tow, and there are willing hands here
both to make the splints and to pad them when made.
Would there had been such help in the days I remember,
when his Grace of MARLBOROUGH, that great captain, led
the forces of the QUEEN. At Malplaquet we won a great
victory, but we lost twenty thousand men, and I fear but
little was done to help the wounded. We must make
reparation for the past, and here we do it as best we may.”
“But you,” I said, “can you still help in this?” -
“I lend the house. I confer my approval on the workers.
Not much, you will say, but 'tis all I can do. A lady who
danced at the Court of QUEEN ANNE could not well do less
—or more. But we stand prating here too long. Go, Sir,
and see for yourself what is a-doing here. Commended by
me, you may pass everywhere and see everything, so that

afterwards you may report our cause and its needs aright
to those who might aid us. Nay, I cannot go with you,
for my chair waits me below and my time is come to take
the air.” And, as she said this, she seemed to shrivel before
my eyes, and in a moment she had vanished from the
powder-closet.
However, I took her advice and saw everything for my-
self; and I now beg leave to report the result of my tour
through the Queen Anne house in Kensington Square.
First, let me say that I found myself to be present at the
headquarters of the Kensington War Hospital Supply
Depôt, a hive of industry the like of which, both in respect
of its output of work and its admirable organisation, I have
not seen. More than one thousand ladies of Kensington
have enrolled themselves as voluntary workers, and here in
their turns they come together, each in her own department,
to produce munitions for the various British and Allied Hos-
pitals at home and at the Front. In one room a party rolls
bandages with exquisite precision; in another they are mak-
ing all sizes of swabs. In a third, as I have already said, they
concentrate on the padding of splints, which are served up
to them hot and hot, as it were, by a vigorous company of
male amateur carpenters installed in the basement. There
are about one hundred of these gentlemen in all, and, if I
may judge by those I saw, they are a most enthusiastic and
skilful lot. In addition to splints of all sorts they make in-
valid tables, crutches which one of them upholsters—in fact
every kind of carpentry that a hospital can require. Then
there is a needlework room for the making of dressing-
gowns, bed-jackets, flannel shirts, and so forth ; while in
yet another room scores and scores of pairs of slippers are
made of so tempting a pattern and so comfortable a design
that one might almost wish for a wound in order to have
the privilege of wearing at least one pair of them. Room
after room I visited, and in every one of them I was struck
by the air of fresh and cheerful determination which shines
from the faces of those who, without ostentation and for
no material reward, have pledged themselves to hard toil
for the sake of their suffering fellow-mortals.
From Kensington Square the gifts of this Association
are sent out like blessings. Daily they speed on their
merciful errand to Malta, to Serbia, to East Africa, to
Flanders, to France, to Alexandria, to the Dardanelles.
And not only is the work entirely voluntary, but the
workers themselves help to swell the funds. In one week
they contributed no less a sum than forty pounds. The
only trouble is this: the appreciation of their work has
grown so fast and the appeals from hospitals have become
so numerous and so urgent that, if all the demands are to
be satisfied, the great and generous public must be asked
to help. Those who subscribe may rely on it that every
penny of their money will go straight to the purchase of

MUSKETRY INSTRUCTION.
I Took a dislike to Smithers from
the moment he entered our Volunteer
Training Corps, and when I was pro-
moted to the command of his section
I began to dislike him still more.
There is that about Smithers which
seems to make it impossible to give a
correct order when he is present. In
addition to which he is one of those
men who seek to establish a reputa-
tion for diligence by asking difficult
questions.
One day, when my section had got
itself hopelessly mixed for the third time
in succession, I began to be annoyed.
“Good heavens !” I said, glaring at
Smithers, who I felt certain was re-
would jump out of a grip like that.

“One ring out at two o'clock 1"
called the marker.
“Not so bad,” I said, “though,
judging by the way you held the rifle,
I should say it was more luck than any-
thing. Give me the rifle, Smithers.”
“What I've tried to impress upon
you all,” I went on, “is the importance
of sighting. You cannot pay too much
attention to your sights. There is only
one thing worse than too fine a sight,
and that is too full a sight. Smithers
took too full a sight. Also refrain
from “pulling.' Smithers pulled. Most
beginners do. You see the result. Ob-

should be held. Then there is the

a few more shots.
“Can't see any hits,” said the marker
with his eye to the glass.
“Then they must all be in the black,”
I replied. “Better than I expected.
You see, men, what can be done by
paying attention to your sights and
holding your rifle properly. Smithers,
perhaps you will fetch me the target.”
He brought it to me while the section
gathered round in awed silence. There
was not a single perforation.
“What does this mean?” I exclaimed.
Said Smithers in his slow, fatuous
way: “I should say that it means you
missed the target every time.”
“Unless the bullets bounced off,”
suggested Hatherway.

“That will do,” Isnapped.
“Not so much talking in

think this is, Smithers—

up into my best sarcastic

commander came along and
requested me to take my

“Or came back and filled

“That will do,” I said
sharply. “Not somuch talk-
ing. There is something
wrong with the sights.”
“You tested and set them
yourself, Sir,” said the
marker, rather more coldly.
“Besides which the other
gent hit the target all right.”
The section chuckled joy-
ously. I felt myself coming
unstuck.
“I think I can explain,”
said Smithers, who was
examining the rifle.
“Of course you can,” I
said sarcastically. “You al-
ways can, Smithers. Gentle-
men, Mr. Smithers can ex-

Smithers would have no power to un-
nerve me once I got fairly started on
my pet theme. The section listened
respectfully, almost reverently, while
I explained the difference between
the foresight and the trigger-guard.
Smithers seemed particularly attentive.
I was determined, however, to take
this opportunity of impressing him
with a full sense of his inferiority.
“Before I show you how to shoot,”
I said, “I will give you an example of
“how not to do it.' Smithers, be so
kind as to take up a firing position on
the mat.” Smithers obeyed.
“You will observe,” I continued,
“that his position is altogether wrong.
His legs are too wide apart; his head
is forced too far forward; his eye is
too near the backsight; the butt of
the rifle is too high on his shoulder;
his grip is hopeless; a child's pop-gun
“letting off.” Most raw recruits—
Smithers, for example—pull the trigger
as though they were trying to pull a
cart-horse back upon its haunches,
whereas a gentle even pressure is what
you want.” I fired.
“You’re not on the target,” said the
marker. “Unless,” he added hastily,
“it’s in the black.”
“We'll presume it's a bull,” I said
stiffly. “There is no reason why it
should not be a bull. If these sights
are correct x -

the marker coldly.
4. it must be a bull.” I addressed
the section. “Now I'll show you how
to get a good grouping. An occasional
bull is all very well, but it's the good
group that counts. Now if you take a
correct sight, as I did, and hold your
rifle properly, and not as Smithers held
it, there is nothing to prevent your
yard range, consequently every one of
your shots, presuming that you were
aiming correctly, must have cleared
the top of the target by about two
inches.”
When the fools had finished laughing
I said, looking at Smithers—
“Smithers, these sights were correct
when the rifle was in your hands.”
Smithers' face wore the guileless
oh-to-be-an-angel expression of the
cathedral choir-boy. I was proceeding
when the platoon-sergeant entered with
orders for us to reassemble for dismissal.
“It just shows,” I heard Smithers
say as the section fell in, “that a fellow
can't pay too much attention to his
sights.”
I can see myself having trouble with
Smithers.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. H. G. WELLs never perhaps fools quite lightly; he
can't help weighting his most extravagant jests with just a
little sociology and social criticism, and Bealby (METHUEN),
which he calls “a holiday,” in the sense of “a lark,” has
little touches of this, and also lies under the handicap of
the gifted author's rather ponderous phrase-making, or
phrase-making that seems ponderous in this kind of jollity.
I am not sure, either, that he quite escapes being occasion-
ally facetious . . . But of course it's absurd to be solemn
about Bealby—a mere extempore diversion thrown off in
an artless way: a kind of harlequinade, or perhaps like
nothing so much as a scenario for one of those breathless
kinema comedies of the people's palaces. But not fatuous,
as they—rather, indeed, at times quite Pickwickian in its
resourcefulness and gay movement. When I tell you that
Bealby, the new steward's-room boy, escaping from the
persecutions of Thomas, the second footman, butted an
Hegelian Lord Chancellor of ample habit of body (no, not
that one, as Mr. WELLs carefully explains in the preface),
and that thereafter the Chancellor bit the butler and on
yet another occasion blacked his eye and yet again shook
him violently at his host's sideboard at Shonts during that
fatal week-end, you won't wonder that Sir Peter Larton
thought his guest needed to be restricted in the matter of
alcohol. And you may wonder reasonably what it was all
about and what it all led to. Well, get Bealby and find
out. You'll not be bored, and you'll laugh often. And
what better things in a small way can well befall you?
What a crowd of readers will rejoice to hear that the
happy coalition known as E. CE. SoMERVILLE and MARTIN
Ross have published another of their delicious pronounce-
ments on the Irish problem. In Mr. Knor's Country
(LoNGMANs) brings back again all those jolly people whom
one has several times enjoyed meeting before—Flurry Knor;
the fearful but fascinating old grandmother, Philippa, and
the rest of them. No collaboration has ever been a greater
puzzle to me than this of these two clever women. The
matter of their stories is so slight (nothing at all, when you
look back upon them, ever seems to have happened) and
the laughter they raise in you is so inevitable a thing, born
spontaneously from the clash of characters, that I am
driven to the belief that each of the authors must manage
their pet persons in the cast independently of the other,
and take it in turns to set down the result. In this case I
think my most grateful homage is at the feet of whoever is
responsible for old Mrs. Knor. That aged but unquench-
able lady is a joy for ever. Whether you see her heroically
stifling her rheumatics, bending a rebellious family to her
iron will, minding her own and everyone else's business,
or relaxing in the gentler pleasures of the chase, she
remains a quite unforgettable figure. As in the previous
books, these stories are illustrated with drawings by Miss
SoMERVILLE, but, spirited as they are, I could have wished
that the artist had left Mrs. Knor to my unfettered imagi-
nation. No hand, even that of her creator, could improve
on my mental image of this wonderful and superhuman
being.

a most worrying book. It is so involved and haphazard,
and so much concerned with things that used to matter a
good deal, but at present are altogether outside, that I
ended by mislaying my patience. I should say it was
very probably a first effort in fiction; and, for all its
obvious defects, there are here and there snatches of clever-
ness about the writing that mitigated my exasperation.
So perhaps HERBERT TREMAINE (whom I suspect, despite
this name, of being a woman) will do better next time.
For one thing, the present book suffers from having been
written with an object. One might indeed say with half-a-
dozen objects. And the inevitable result is that as a
work of art it suffers. We began with a promising thrill:
a young doctor has just shot himself, leaving behind a
semi-idiot child (who, we gather, used to be all right before
the doctor began experimenting) and a frightened partner.
Moreover, the partner, who rejoiced, or might under
happier circumstances have rejoiced, in the name of
Ludovic Spim, was a Prussian. So, of course, I saw at
once that he had been up to some of his native devilments;
and started with a pleasant anticipation of a mystery,
remember that the portrait is a possible one, for it takes
just a little of the bitterness out of an ineffably bad business.
Perhaps Mr. CHAMBERs, like many writers in this field, is a
little too obsessed with those fateful documents which are
stolen, pursued, captured, left on the washing-stand and
forgotten, though the fugitive's life and a country's fate
hang on them. Of course it was flattering of Mr. CHAMBERS
to make his hero knit his brow so determinedly and so long
over that cipher drawing, the general sense of which
dawned upon clever me when I first clapped eyes upon it,
as it will dawn on you, gentle reader . . . Taking it all in
all, this is a sound book and not blighted with too many
horrors.
As far as I can gather from contemporary fiction, the
chief flaw in the German system of espionage is that there
seems to be no means by which one German spy can
recognise another. This makes it hard for the poor fellows.
They are going along very nicely, when up comes a perfect
stranger, who says, “Hist! I also am from the Wilhelm-
strasse; I also am a spy, only a rather more important one
ending with the just hu-
miliation of the Herr Doctor
Spim. But here, unfortun-
ately, the Purposes began

guilty all right; but we
never got much further than
that. Instead, attention
was taken up with a crew
of Anti-Vivisectionists and
Vegetarians and Woman's
Righters, who were all so
boring that I feel sure they
must be faithfully drawn.
Indeed it is partly on the
treatment of them that I
base my hope that Mr. or

the example of the Two Who Declined and give the present

Mr. R. W. CHAMBERs contrives a plausible atmosphere
of War in Who Goes There? (APPLETON). His gallant
young American hero, Kervyn Guild, in reality a scion of
the old Belgian nobility and reserve officer in the crack
regiment of KING ALBERT's army, The Guides, is first
introduced as a unit in a party ranged against a wall
facing a row of helmeted men in field-grey of a well-known
shade ; and from that awkward moment till he takes his
German-Danish bride to safety through the enemy lines,
has a very tough time of it and acquits himself as one has
learnt to expect a Belgian officer to do. Karen, his heroine,
is an eminently good sportsman, and makes and takes love
very prettily indeed. Mr. CHAMBERs weaves his double
strand of Love and Death with a skilled hand. And, being
a neutral with an immense bias on the right side, he yet
sees (or at least saw at the time of correcting his proof-
sheets, which was before the Gulflight, the Falaba, the
Lusitania and other gentle hunnishments) the great quarrel
with enough of detachment to allow himself to draw a
portrait of a chivalrous Prussian officer, the rival claimant
to Karen's hand. Even in our anger it is no bad thing to
Secret Service as regards results. To take but one instance,
it enabled Alec Deane, in Mr. ARTHUR W. MARCHMONT's
latest story, The Lady Passenger (Hodder AND STOUGHTON),
to do more deceiving and frustrating than I remember to
have come across between the pages of any other six-shilling
novel. The scene of The Lady Passenger is laid in Con-
stantinople, shortly before the entry of Turkey into the
War, and deals with the efforts of sundry German spies to
hand over an English girl to the Turkish Haska Pasha as
the price of his assistance in bringing his country into the
conflict. Deane poses as a superior spy, orders the lesser
spies about, snubs them, bullies the Pasha, and saves the
girl. It is an entertaining story, but I am bound to say
that the opinion I once held, that the two most dangerous
things in the world were German spies and mince pies, has
been sadly shaken. -

WEARY WILLIE, JUNIOR.
I HEAR that we are going strong
Out there upon the Polish front,
But somehow something's always Wrong
About my own peculiar stunt;
Each single time I take a blob ;
For just a solid year I've scored 'em ;
And now this tedious Argonne job
Has turned me stiff with boredom.
Once more I'm told to hack my way
To Verdun by the nearest route,
This time allowing no delay
For women, wine or other loot;
Well, I have hacked and hacked and hacked
Day after day in dull succession,
And only made in point of fact
A very small impression.
I fear that Father takes it ill;
He taught me as a bud to sprout;
From him I learned the way to spill
My cannon-fodder's blood about ;
He nursed my Hohenzollern brains
And showed my scabbard how to rattle,
And yet, for all his pious pains, -
I cannot win a battle.
So now he cuts me. All this while
He's polishing up his orb and crown,
Rehearsing how to make in style
His entry into Warsaw town;
And there (with Mother, too, in tow)
He'll leave me outside in the chilly,
And never pause to care a blow
About his Little Willie. O. S.
HOW TO END THE WAR IN NO TIME.
(By Our Aerial Erpert, Mr. Bindles Dibs.)
I RETURN this week (as I did last week and the week
before and expect to do next week) to the need for an
Aerial Offensive on a grand scale. It is a most extra-
ordinary thing that the Government can't be made to see
it after all the trouble I have had in working out the
details. I have consistently advocated, in this publication
and elsewhere, on the platform and in the Press, the
recognition of our air forces in the capacity not of an arm
but of a service; also the vital difference between an Attack
and an Assault, the hopeless ineffectiveness of Raids as
compared with Thrusts, and the important distinction
between an Offensive Act and a mere Impertinence.
To-day we come back to our old ground and proceed to
discuss (1) How our aerial fleet is to be obtained, and (2)
How it is to be employed.
We must have an adequate force, and this force must
not have any earthly connection with the forces we have
already. It must not be confounded with them at all; it
must be a new, special and unique departure, set aside,
ear-marked, allocated, fore-ordained. You see it is meant
to be a fresh element of surprise, and it is clear that the more
I go on º it the more profoundly unprepared
the enemy will be for its appearance. But one point about
it must be borne in mind—that it will do the trick.
How is this force to be obtained 2 We must not for a
moment interfere with the work that is going on in the pro-
duction of aeroplanes to operate as an arm with our forces
in the field. (I have nothing to do with that: I believe
them to be doing well). The thing must be done on a
territorial basis and spread over every part of the British
Isles. I have taken a good deal of trouble to work this out
and have arrived, by a process of elimination, at the only
possible method. I do not ask for an unreasonable number
of aeroplanes, but we must have ten thousand to start with,
and the number must increase by leaps and bounds. As I
calculate, it can be done, with our existing resources, in a
matter of about five weeks. But the work must be minutely
sub-divided.
Let every parish form a committee and undertake the
local production of one machine and the training of one
aviator. Local conditions must of course be considered.
In some cases the man most suited to be trained for this
purpose would be one of the churchwardens; in others not.
But the right man could easily be found. Where a parish
committee could not be formed without friction the thing
might be put in the hands of the local Cricket Club, or the
Horticultural Society, where such exists. Plans would be
provided by a central office in London. I cannot see any
difficulty that can arise. By the way, will all inventors,
constructors, mechanics, local tradesmen willing to try to
make parts of aeroplanes and other aerial accessories im-
mcdiately communicate with me by registered post?
Let us suppose, allowing for all delays, that our new fleet
is ready for mobilization by the second week in October.
How then is it to be employed so as to wind up the War
before the third week in November, and so obviate another
winter campaign 2. It must operate at selected points in a
continuous stream, night and day. The flight must be
made at a certain altitude and in a certain formation, and,
more than that, in a certain given direction. The best
formation, to allow for windage, is a diamond lozenge shape
with an oblique spear head. This ensures that if every
man drops bombs for all he is worth some of them will
reach their billet. For let me again impress upon my
readers the fact, not yet sufficiently grasped, that an
aeroplane is not simply a weapon with a range of some
hundreds of miles, it is also a club which can strike at a
distance; it may also almost be said to be a fist, enhanced
by a trajectory.
There are many useful objectives. There are—did I
ever mention it before?—the bridges over the Rhine. If
they were destroyed they could not be freely used till they
were repaired. Again, the German army in the West
would be rendered helpless by the unceasing bombardment
of the General Staff. Again—this is my newest idea:
I always like to put in something new to encourage my
readers—the crops in the Hungarian Plain (such of them
as are still ungarnered in October) could be made unfit for
human use by being subjected to a curtain of bombs on
an extensive scale.
I have only to add that if it is decided to go forward
with the scheme, exactly as here described, I shall be
happy to give my services in any useful capacity.
Correspondence: Mr. H. G. WELLs writes:– “My dear
Dibs,--It 's no good. If people of rich imagination and
brilliant prophetic powers—like you and me—who foresaw
every incident and development of the present War about
the end of last century, cannot get a hearing and a
following now, there may be, after all, some truth in the
torrent of bosh about national inefficiency that issues from
the Press every day. So I think you may as well give
it up.”

FROM A BELGIAN GARDEN.
II.
DEAR Monsieur X, −Since I last
wrote to you, we in your garden have
been through some tough times. Your
house has had at least a dozen shells
clean through it. Doors and windows
no longer exist and several walls are
swept away as by a wizard's wand.
In one room which remains whole we
boldly eat our meals in the less turbu-
lent days. But our sometime bedroom
—and it looks as if it had once been
yours—had two stink-shells in it within
five minutes one evening; the gas smell,
which makes you cry from eyes, nose,
and throat all at once, lingered about
the débris for a week. The kitchen is
blown in and your priceless kitchen-
range wrecked. The beams of the
upstairs rooms wave about and groan
in the wind. The little carriage house
is a heap of bricks.
But the cellar is still good, and some
of the men sleep there. For others we
have dug two fine strong-bolstered pits,
one outside your front door and one
under the western bay-window. We
had to take these liberties and we ask
your pardon.
We are convinced it was the fault of
other batteries, Monsieur, who have
from time to time come to your garden
and requested leave to take up a posi- have to travel for over a mile in the
tion in the hedge on the Germany side shell zone before they leave the twist-
of it. The first of these neighbours
stayed two days and one night. They
had not the art of hiding from the
aeroplane. Your hedge there was torn
up, the noble north-east beech was
smashed at its base, and four eight-
inch shells roared down into the farm
stables near by and set them on fire. The
high-explosives whistled and hummed
within inches of our cowering heads
for a dreadful period not measurable by
ordinary time. Another eight-inch shell
landed within a dozen feet of our tele-
phone dug-out, right in the face of the
little china. Notre Dame in the tree, and
it failed to explodel The place shook
horribly, but two of us crawled out and
put the shell in a deep damp hole. Not
one of our battery was hit. But the
other people! What was left of them
pulled their guns out as soon as dusk
came in the evening of that second
day. In all, three batteries have come
to that north-eastern side of your house
and tried to stay there. We are alone
here now with your house and garden
in ruins.
And yet some people will deny that
miracles can happen! Ask the Q.M.S.
about miracles. He rides up with the
transport party—rations and ammuni-
tion—every evening, and his teams
ing road to trot across the final three-
quarters of a mile of fields up to the
house here. I have just told you what
those fields look like. The Germans
try and time their Evening Hate to
coincide with the Q.M.S.'s arrival,
but he has always got his transport
through without disaster. Probably
he could not explain how. The ride
across your western fields under
shell fire, Monsieur, is something to
remember.
The German shells have not entirely
killed the Spring which we have spent
here. The chestnuts in your wind-
breaks have flamed out ; the gorgeous
lilacs have burst forth strong and sweet
and luxuriant, challenging all furies
whatsoever; the great rhododendron by
the shattered north-east beech is in all
its old riot of colour. Not a single shell
has hit any of these splendid things.
Perhaps Mademoiselle your daughter
—who has taken you by the arm,
surely, to look at this passion of
Nature in former springtimes—perhaps
Mademoiselle may be glad to hear this
news of them. Be so good as to say,
with my salutations, how heartily I
agree with her taste.
Yours in gratitude,
Forward OBSERVING OFF:CER.

I.
DEAR PETER,-Thank you for your
magnanimous offer to lend me one-and-
sevenpence till next screw-day, but you
have entirely misinterpreted my letter.
You forgot to read between the lines.
What I intended to convey to you was
that Joan and I are much too hard up
this year to afford a holiday on our
usual scale of princely munificence.
What we are accustomed to TT
is an “excellent cuisine under
the immediate supervision of a
professional, choice wines from
our own wood, separate knives
and forks for each course, sep-
arate serviettes,” the type of
accommodation with which the
Railway Guides have doubtless
made you familiar.
But I see no prospect of our
being able to afford these extra-
vagances unless we make some
more money. This we could
possibly do by Joan's accepting
a little plain charing and by my
taking pupils for fretwork and
the mandoline—courses which,
I need scarcely say, we are very
loath to adopt, as the families of
both of us date back to QUEEN
VICTORIA, a fact of which we
are naturally proud, though
jealous young Edwardians might
possibly call it swank.
Things being so, you may
imagine how anxious I am to
solve the problem of our annual
holiday satisfactorily. A few
days ago I thought I had done
so. I came across an advertise-
ment in one of the papers
which suggested to me a method
whereby we could secure, with
a little adroitness and savoir
faire, a holiday of the kind to
which we have been brought
up, at only half the usual price.
The advertisement concluded—
“Terms from 7s.6d. a day . . .
I laid the idea before Joan, but she
says there must be a flaw in my argu-
ment somewhere, or else why hasn't
the idea been worked before ? My
answer to that was that other people
haven't got my brains. Nevertheless,
Joan refuses to attempt the scheme
unless I first consult Perkins about it.
But that, I consider, would be sheer
waste of money, because I shall have
to pay Perkins 6s. 8d. for his opinion

the earlier closing of public-houses owing to War regulations
has led to a larger jug trade.]

immediately after reading your generous
letter. Now, Peter, you own a country
cottage, “The Yews” (or is it “The
Ewes”?), at Windleton, Sussex, which
you never use except as an address
from which to write letters to The
Daily Mail, possibly with the notion
that the opinions of Peter Travers, of
Windleton, in the County of Sussex,
Gentleman, will have greater weight
with the Editor than those of Peter
in any case, and then, if his opinion | Travers, of Thornton Heath, in the
County of is it in a county 2–

! say to letting it to me for three
weeks come next Tuesday? I
should be willing to pay you any
sum in reason, say threepence a
week, for the use of it. I would
take great care of it, and always
bring it in at night . . . No,
no, my dear Peter, we simply
couldn't. We may be poor, but
(as I have already told you) we
are proud. I insist on putting the
matter on a regular business foot-
ing. Many thanks all the same,
in which my wife joins me. . . .
We should, of course, expect
nothing in return for airing the
beds, ventilating the premises
or feeding the ewes (or is it
“yews”?). But I should like
to know—
(a) What rent will you allow
me to pay ?
(b) Is the cottage on the
electrophone?
(c) Is there a bath-room?
Failing that, a ducking-
stool at the village pond 2
(d) A skating-rink?
e) A presbytery?
% Do we have to take our
own linen, glass, cutlery
and chaplain 2
Let me have a reply at
once, there's a good Peter, for
which I enclose—at least, I
think I enclose ; yes, I do en-
close—a penny stamp.
What about references? My
bankers will, I am sure, be

need not leave until we had had “coffee

following day. This accommodation
would undoubtedly be cheap at 15s. for
the two of us. We should then leave
the Hotel at 11.55 and return at a few
minutes after midnight, and ask for
rooms again. And so cm, day after
day, until we had spent all our money,

frontier by a posse of Boy Scouts.

PAST-MASTER of th' inquisitorial art,
Behold Sir ARTHUR MARKHAM, blame-
less Bart.,
Who in his hate of prophesyings smooth
Out-Herods HERod and out-Handels
Booth.
Not his the methods of his namesake
mild,
Instructress of the mid-Victorian child,
But a relentless longing, fierce and fell,
To drag poor Truth at all hours from
her well,
Linked with a childish jealousy of those
Who vie with him incomforting our foes.
For though, as Master of the Scapegoat
Hunt,
Sir ARTHUR long has kept his place in
front,
In sheer grotesque irrelevance GINNELL
Must be pronounced to bear away the
bell.
Two of a trade; the ancient saw proves
true
Of the two leaders of the curious crew.
In the long run the pupil always wins,
And then the ancient comedy begins—
Satan rebukes his own peculiar sins.
Nor must veracity refrain or flinch
From doing justice to the wondrous
LYNCH, -
Who in his quest of needless knowledge
seeks
To prove himself the very Prince of
Freaks.
Yet, if his talk be tall, for this abuse
He can admittedly plead good excuse:
Nature, his countrymen are wont to tell,
Gave him an inch, and so he took an L.
And there are others who foment dis-
trust
By stirring up recriminative dust—
Most worthy men, no doubt, but how I
wish
They'd fry some other and less stink-
ing fish—
MAsoN from Coventry to London sent,
Although the converse was by Nature
meant,
And DALZIEL, who assiduously tries
To scare the timid by his tales of spies.
In fine, though not habitually prone
To harbour homicidal thoughts, I own
To feeling them within my bosom rise
Against these Parliamentary Paul Prys.
Thank Heav'n, for some few blessèd
weeks to come
The rising of the House will keep them
dumb, ,
And, in enforced abstention from de-
bates, -
Less free to tempt the Nemesis tha
waits -
On those who labour with unholy zeal
Lest England's wounds should be
allowed to heal.
THE HONEY MOON.
DEAR CHLoE,-When, a year ago,
We planned our honeymoon together,
We asked but little here below—
A week or two of decent weather,
Hotels attuned to English ways
(The Continent weboth laid stresson),
The guiding hand of Cook or GAZE
To teach the amateur his lesson.
My word, there's been a change since
then, -
A change exceeding swift and
thorough !
And now I guard, from six till ten,
The gas-works of my native borough;
While you, by tender zeal possessed,
Each week foregather with your
neighbours,
And do your dear unskilful best
To share in Sister Susie's labours.
But, when the Hun has met his fate,
And we, evading rice and slippers,
Depart the parish church in state,
The latest thing in bridal-trippers;
When War and “frightfulness" are not,
And KRUPP is impotent to scare us,
To some remote and restful spot
A surplus Zeppelin shall bear us.

ºf xxiv. ~
MY DEAR CHARLEs, — The week's
battalion communiã ué runs :-" Thurs-
day evening. Our Henry was vigor-
ously attacked at 6.30 by a hostile
shell of a highly explosive nature; but
after a somewhat violent engagement
he won. While the casualties on our
side were limited to damages to a cap
and waterproof coat, the enemy shell
was completely annihilated.” My first
thought was “Poor old Charles He
will have to listen to a lot of talk about
this.” Even then it occurred to me
that you might think I was attaching
too much importance to what is, after all,
one among many millions of “crumps;”
at the same time I felt that sufficient
importance never could be attached
to that blinding, deafening monstrosity
which landed at my front door at 6.30
pipp emma (as the signallers would say),
and then and there had the one great
expansive moment of its career. To
think that, even if it had been a yard
to the left and so eliminated me, the
official communiqué would still have
run : “Thursday. Nothing of import-
ance occurred on the Western front l”
A dozen shells had already burst in
our area, and we had not complained.
It is the little attention which the
enemy is used to paying us of an
evening, and upon which we have come
to look as our special perquisite, claim-
that trench No. has the most
adequate shell-service in the neighbour-
hood. As usual, I had withdrawn into
my dug-out and was, for the tenth time,
rearranging its interior, making a place
for everything, putting everything in
its place. When your floor, walls and
ceiling are naked earth, there need be
no limit to the tidiness of your home;
if, for instance, there is no place to put
your stud, you take your jack-knife and
carve a little niche in the wall; there
you have your recess for officer's stud
complete.
At the passage of the twelfth shell I
had housed everything, and I should
have gone out, assuming the danger to
be past, had it not occurred to me that I
had omitted to provide accommodation
for myself. I was moulding the floor
to fit that peculiar thing, the human
body, when black darkness, accom-
panied by a lot of red light, smoke,
earth, stones, hot metal and pieces of
waterproof, arrived ; the noisiest arrival
I ever recollect. In the débris only
one thing was visible, a sheet of a
current journal showing the heavy-
leaded legend, What is High Erplosive 2
I was extremely annoyed and anxious
immediately to inform the responsible
- person how surprised I was at the
attitude he had seen fit to adopt. In
calmer contemplation, I convinced
myself that what had happened
was probably something after this
Inanner –
A long way behind the German firing
line, in comfortable ease and security,
there would be three people, Major
von Thingummy, O.C. the howitzer
battery; Lieut. Fritz, and Sub-Officer
No. 9999, one of the strong silent sort
with an undue sense of his own import-
ance. The Major, fat and spectacled,
would be sitting at his dug-out door,
reading his evening paper and cursing
himself for ever having invested his
money in the Hamburg-Amerika line;
the Sub-Officer would be polishing his
buttons preparatory to firing his sal-
voes; Fritz would be fussing round the
guns generally, preventing the men
from doing their work. At 5.55 P.M.
precisely, Fritz and the Sub-Officer
would fall in, dress by the left, march
some few paces to the Major's dug-out,
salute, dress by the right, and stand to
attention, waiting orders. The Major,
having finished the last page of his
paper, would turn over the leaves and
start again at the beginning, a way
which soldiers at the Front have with
their newspapers.
After an interval, “How many rounds
shall we fire to-night, Sir?” Fritz
would ask deferentially. The Major
would go on reading; Fritz would clear
his throat; the Sub-Officer would stand
to more attention than ever. “How
many rounds shall we fire to-night,
Sir?” Fritz would repeat in a slightly
louder voice.
“No, thanks . . . yes, please,” the
Major would say inconsequently, not
taking his eyes off his paper. There
would be a tense pause; eventually the
Major would put his paper across his
knees and, closing his eyes, would settle
himself down to his preprandial nap.
Fritz and the Sub-Officer would stand
it as long as they could, but when the
Major began to snore their patience
would give out, and, saluting very
ironically, they would depart to do their
firing on their own. Looking very
solemn and fierce about it, they would
loose off their dozen rounds, doing no
more harm, if they did but know it,
than to inflict a nasty gash on a not
very important sand-bag.
The noise would wake the Major,
who would summon Fritz and the Sub-
Officer to him. “By the way,” he
would say, “isn't it about time for our
evening splash 2 You'd better loose
off the guns . . . not that I believe we
ever hit anything, but war is war and
we must be Frightful.”
“The guns have been fired, Sir,”
Fritz would say.
“Then fire them again, my lad.”
“But we have fired twelve rounds,
Sir, and scored several direct hits.”
“Then make it a baker's dozen and
give 'em another for luck,” the Major
would say, smiling outwardly, but being
inwardly a little tired of Fritz and the
Sub-Officer and their direct hits.
“What at, Sir 2 " Fritz would ask.
“Any old thing,” the Major would
say, starting once more on the evening
news, and because (and only because)
orders are orders, the pair of them
would go away, stuff a shell hastily
into one of the guns, let it off without
taking any aim at all to speak of . . .
And that would be the shell about
which I am making all this fuss' . .
I should have said that my cap and
waterproof coat were hanging just out-
side my dug-out. The cap was pierced
in several places, the coat torn to
ribbons. The cap I now loan (at a
price) to officers going home on leave
who desire to create a sensation. “My
dear boy,” their relatives ask, “what-
ever made those holes in that cap 2"
The officer assumes an air of indif-
ference. “A shell,” says he truly, and
adds hastily, “but let us talk of some-
thing else.” The coat I have returned
to the makers, Messrs. Burding, with
the following note:– “Sirs, This coat
having come, as you see, to a sudden
end, but myself being happily still with
you, I ask the sordid question, who is
going to bear the expense of replacing
it? Four names suggest themselves—
(1) Henry—a non-starter.
(2) The British Government might,
but would take a twelvemonth making
up their minds, during which time it
might start raining again.
(3) The German Government ought
to, but probably haven't the money.
Anyhow I can't ask, because we are not
on speaking terms.
(4) Messrs. Burding oughtn't to, but
if they liked to try I’m sure neither
(3), (2) nor (1) would stand in their
way . . . .
With my men, whom by the way I
met coming to look for me with an
entrenching tool, you will be glad to
hear that all is well. They have, how-
ever, relapsed into their old vice of
digging, night and day, in out-of-battle
hours. Sometimes it is ten men with
ten spades, sometimes a hundred men
with fifty picks and fifty shovels, some-
times even more. This has inspired
my platoon poet to a further effort:—
“If all the troops with all the tools
Should dig for half-a-year,
Do you suppose,” our Captain asked,
“That then we should be clear?”
“I doubt it,” said the Adjutant, .
Knowing his Brigadier.
Yours ever, HENRY.

IX.
Jimmy says the War has come quite
close to his house; it's the Volunteer
Training Corps, and they drill in a field
at the bottom of Jimmy's garden. The
milkman is mixed up in it, Jimmy
says, and it was through watching the
way he did it that Jimmy's bloodhound,
Faithful, caught another German spy.
The milkman told Jimmy that some
of them found it very complicated, but
to him it was a mere fleabite in the
ocean, as you might say. Lots of
things are like that to Faithful, Jimmy
says, things which would make other
bloodhounds worry themselves a lot.
Jimmy says the milkman has twenty-
seven inches of his own to move in, and
an extra six or seven they give him on
either side, because of his activity.
The milkman takes off his jacket
and waistcoat to do it because it is so
hot and it helps his pores. Jimmy
says that the first time the sergeant
told the milkman to dress he went to
put his clothes on again, and what the
sergeant said made the milkman mark
time like anything. .
Jimmy says the milkman is very
good at marking time, and it's because
of his high action. The sergeant
doesn't admire it much, though, and
he told the milkman that when he
wanted him to do a clog dance he
would give the order.
Jimmy says the milkman likes “as-
you-were " best ; he is a good as-you-
werer, because when the sergeant gives
the command he hasn't got to do any-
thing except smile a welcome at the
others as they return to him—you see
the milkman was all the time, that's
why. The milkman is very quick like
that, Jimmy says.
You have to anticipate the word of
command by listening to the caution,
Jimmy says, and after the command the
milkman always laughs and shakes his
head and says, “I’m wrong, sargint,”
just like that ; “I’m wrong, sargint,”
he says. He is a happy little soul, the
Sergeant says.
Jimmy says the sergeant hasn't
known the milkman long, but he took
to him the very first night after they
had numbered off. The milkman had
said he was “No. 114, next to the post
office,” and now the serjeant talks to
him quite freely as if he had known
him all his life. He uses the milk-
man to demonstrate with ; he asked
him to show the others which was his
right hand and which his left. You see
he didn't know the milkman was left-
handed; the milkman told the sergeant
he was born like that, and it all
depended on which arm you were
nursed on—he had a cousin like it, he
said. Jimmy says it is very nice to sit
on a fence and listen to the sergeant
giving the words of command; the
sergeant shouts out, “Hip ! Hop !!”
and ever so many of them form fours,
but the milkman marks time, because
he is so very good at that, and he
believes in sticking to what you know.
Jimmy says the sergeant swears by
the milkman; you can hear him doing
it. KITCHENER said that recruits want
six months at least, and Jimmy heard
the sergeant tell the milkman that he
deserved more and would get it if he
had his way.
Jimmy says that Faithful likes to sue
the milkman on active service, and he
helped him to stalk a sheep. You see,
they had mislaid the milkman on the
right and told him to take an object to

Fond Mother. “Is N'T THE WAR DREADFUL? AND so Awkward when Poon DEAR Sylvia is just coming out.”
march on. Jimmy says the milkman
fixed his eye on a sheep which was
standing there biting grass at him, and
Faithful helped him to track it down.
Jimmy says that sometimes the
sergeant gives the command, “Hip !
Hop ! by your right !” and off they go.
Then he says, “No 3, rear rank, is out
of step,” and the milkman kicks the
man in front of him hard on the back
of the calf and gets into step in no
time, and then the sergeant says, “No
talking in the ranks.” . The milkman
says war is a terrible thing.
Jimmy says they had a lovely time
one evening. It was when they had
formed fours and were doubling.
Jimmy says the milkman was in the
middle of the column; you could tell
him by his high action, which made his
head bob up and down. They were
going hard at it, Jimmy says, when
the milkman suddenly bent down to
tie up his bootlace. The milkman is
very quick like that, Jimmy says; he
doesn't like to lose any time. Every-
body who could fell over the milkman,
Jimmy says, and you should have heard
the sergeant Hip ! Hop !
Jimmy says he could see that Faith-
ful liked this part of the manoeuvres,
and he waited for the milkman to do
wards put out his hand to talk to the
sergeant, and when he told the sergeant,
“I've burst me braces, sargint,” the
sergeant let him go.
Jimmy says he doesn't think they
are going to loose the milkman at the
Germans yet, as he is not quite ready.
You see they haven't given him a rifle
and bayonet yet, and the man next to
the milkman says when they do he is
going home. -
Jimmy says you could hear old Faith-
ful giving the words of command to
himself all that night, and when he
took him out on the spy trail, nearly
the first thing he did was to double
round a lawn and all over a kitchen
garden, taking his time from a cat,
which kept just a few feet ahead of him.
It doesn't take Faithful long to select
an object to march on, Jimmy says.
Jimmy says there was a man running
to the station in a hurry to catch a
train; he had a bag in his hand and
didn't know there was a bloodhound
going through military manoeuvres,
and that he was just engaged in active
retreat before a heavy shower of flower-
pots.
Jimmy says Faithful came skidding
out and stopped right in front of the:
man, not to tie up his bootlace, but to
scratch himself. -
Jimmy says the man went an awful
whack, and banged the bag hard on the
ground as if he meant it. Jimmy says
Faithful immediately manoeuvred over
a wall, and then everything began to
happen. The bag burst into flames and
the man danced about. The man tried
to explain to the people that it was a
box of fusees. They were very strong
fusees, Jimmy says, because they had a
flame two feet long.
“Bit windy where you come from,
guv'nor,” a man said. Then someone
else said, “Looks like a bomb. Give
her a kick, Bill, and see if she'll go off.”
Jimmy says the man seemed in a
hurry to catch his train, because he
upset a little girl who was pushing to
get to the front to see the bomb go off.
Jimmy says it was one of these
things you put in a factory or a ware-
house, and then you see nice photo-
graphs in the papers showing you a
policeman guarding the ruins.
The milkman was very pleased when
Jimmy told him how Faithful had
copied some of his manoeuvres. He
said he found that it came to him quite
natural like. All you had to remember

(Extracted FROM THE DIARy of Torv, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July
19th.-In days when whist was played
there was in currency a decree “When
in doubt lead trumps.” Adapted to-
day by succession of Governments,
Liberal and Coalition. “When in diffi-
culty play LLoyd GEORGE " is the
variant. It came into use early in his
career, which commenced at Board of
Trade. Since then it has governed
Ministerial action with increasing regu-
larity.
Difficulty of the hour is the strike
in South Wales, affecting 200,000
men and dangerously limiting supply
of fuel vital to the Fleet. RUNCIMAN,
in official position at Board of Trade,
has wrestled manfully with the diffi-
culty. His mediation baulked by a
a few men who, cleverly evading sub-
mission of case to the ballot, com-
manded the situation.
This watched from Germany with
grateful glee. Worth the loss of a colony

pensates for clearance from the seas

makes no attempt to hide exultation at
discovery of this unexpected ally in

Deadlock reached this morning.
Prolonged, painstaking negotiations
between Board of Trade and South

municated by RUNCIMAN in an aside
interpolated in speech on moving

LLoyd GEORGE is going down to
Cardiff to talk to the men, not to-
morrow but this very evening.
General cheer welcomed news. PRE-
sIDENT of BoARD of TRADE, having
made his speech, excused himself from

Odd in view of almost passionate
injunction to economy addressed to
general public by Ministerial authori-
ties. Explanation offered simple if not
fully satisfactory. The thing, Member
for Kirkcaldy was told, happens every
day with regularity of rising or ebbing
tide. War Office insists upon sending
more bread than can possibly be used.
So it is chucked overboard.
That by the way.
When, moving one of the earlier
Votes of Credit, PREMIER named a daily
expenditure of three millions the House
gasped. Wonderful how, in imitation
of the eel in disciplinary circumstance,
we grow accustomed to the inevitable.
This estimate, like all others (including
the cost of bread), has been exceeded.
PREMIER now admitted that daily ex-
penditure “may be substantially more
than three millions.” A Vote of 100
millions might reasonably be expected
to carry us on till end of September.
As a matter of precaution 150 millions
asked for. 4 * . -

Cardiff this evening, bringing his
sheaves with him in form of settle-
ment of South Wales strike. A great
achievement adding fresh renown to
brilliant career. MINISTER of MUNI-
TIONs is the last man to overlook, or
minimise, value of spade work done by
RUNCIMAN during last three weeks.
Telegrams from Cardiff received at
House make it clear that Welsh miners
not disposed in that direction. At
meeting of delegates where settlement
was signed and sealed, PRESIDENT of
BoARD of TRADE met with ovation

greeted MINISTER of MUNITIONs.

The loyal currant cake;

“It's a pretty word, isn't it?” said Francesca, as she
emerged from her morning paper.
“What's a pretty word 2 " I said.
“Oh, can't you guess?” she said. “Everybody's talk-
ing about it. It's in one syllable, you know, and it goes
with a regular snap.” -
“Yes,” I said, “ some words are like that. You just
pronounce them fiercely and you get an idea that you've
actually done them—I mean that you've done the thing
the word means; you understand me, don't you?—and
later on you wake up and remember that you’ve only
pronounced it, and perhaps, after all, you haven't even pro-
nounced it right, and—you take my meaning, don't you?”
“I’m struggling,” she said. “Many women would have
given it up, but I'm not one of that sort. I'm a born
wrestler. No, don't tell me. I'm getting it." The light's
beginning to dawn. What a thing it is to have a husband
who can't explain himself. It keeps one's mind from rusting.”
“Oh, stop it,” I said. “What's this pretty word of
yours, anyhow 2" -- - -
“Guess,” she said. “It’ll be good for you.”
“Munitions,” I said quickly; “Economy; Both A;
Explosives; ASQUITH ; Subscriptions.” I paused for breath.
“All wrong. I told you it was in one syllable.”
“So you did. Shells; Coals; Trench; FRENch ; Vosges;
Rheims; guns; bombs. What, no nearer? I give it up.”
“You’re not much of a trier,”
vocabulary is painfully limited.” -
“Let me know the worst; I insist on it.” .
“Well, then,” she said, “it’s ‘thrift.’”
“Thrift” 2 " I said. “Is that your wonderful word 2 ”
“I never said it was wonderful.”
“No, but you led me to suppose it was wonderful.”
“That's because you're one of those strong brave men

“Yes,” she said, “it has been rather flashy. But there's
Muriel, you know. She'll be sixteen before you can turn
round.”
“I don't want to turn round. I want to stay as I am.
It's these turnings round that do all the mischief.”
“Hear, hear!” she said. “But you can't prevent Muriel
from being sixteen.” - -
“No,” I said, “worse luck. And after that she'll be
seventeen, and then eighteen, and she'll have her hair up
and she 'll want to have new frocks; and then Nina will
come along, and after her there'll be Alice, and after Alice
there’ll be Frederick, and they'll all be getting older all
the time and wanting to spend more money, and not know-
ing anything about the income-tax and the rates, and the
price of butcher's meat and all the other delightful things
that I've got to think of from morning to night.”
“Don’t be a pessimist,” she said. “They'll turn out all
right. Who knows but they may help you to save money.
Sometimes children are like that.” - l
“Yes,” I said, “in books, and ours are not bookish
children.”
“At any rate,” she said, “we can teach them the mean-
ing of thrift.” * -
“I don't think I like thrifty children,” I said. “They
seem to be against nature. And, as for Frederick, he has
already confided to me that when he grows up he means to
spend all his income on silkworms. At present he has
only two, and their names are Herbert and Robert.

she said, “and your
Herbert has already spun himself in, but Robert shows a
strange apathy, and no amount of mulberry leaves and ||
scoldings will tempt him to the great adventure. Frederick ||
is becoming very gloomy about it.”
“Bless him " " said Francesca.
“All my sympathies,” I said, “are with Robert. If I
were a sleek silkworm, with free rations and the range of
a cardboard box, nothing would induce me to turn into a
helpless chrysalis.” -
“But you’d want to be a moth, wouldn't you?”
“I’m not so sure about that,” I said.
“You’d have to be, you know, you wouldn't be asked.”
“There you go again,” I said. “You always shatter my
brightest visions. Why can't you let me dream I'm a
perpetual silkworm 2''
“Adorable dreamer,” she said, “let us talk about thrift.”
“Oh, bother thrift,” I said. '
“Well, it's a nice patriotic word, anyhow.”
“Patriotic 2 " I said. “How do you make that out 2."
“No German could pronounce it, not if he tried ever so
hard.” - -
“No, by Jove,” I said, “nor he could.”
“He would call it “drift,’” she said.
“Or trift.’”
“Or Srift.’”
“And that shows,” I said, “that the German is not so
dreadful after all. A man who wants to say ‘thrift' and
can't get any nearer to it than “drift'—”
“Or Srift.’” -

Lulled to rest by droning clover-haunting bees.

You ask me, Araminta, why my pen,
Whose airy efforts helped me once to win you,
Has, since you made me happiest of men,
Apparently resolved to discontinue
Its periodic flights
And steadily avoids the Muses' heights.
I too have wondered. Are connubial cares
Antipathetic to divine afflatus?
Yeº many a bard has piped his liveliest airs
After surrendering his single status;
Or can it be the War
That's been and dried me up in every pore?
Darkling I groped for light, but found no ray;
Chill with despair, I almost ceased to seek a
Way through the fog, when suddenly to-day
Like ARchimEDEs I exclaimed, “Eureka!”
I found indeed the path
This morning as I lay inside my bath.
For yesterday to rural scenes you fled
And left me, duty's slave, to desolation;
To-day I sought my tub with measured tread
And spent an hour immersed in contemplation,
Just as I used to do
Ere yet in beauty side by side we grew.
No urgent call to breakfast broke my rest;
Serene and snug I heard the quarters chiming,
And, as the brimming waters lapped my breast,
Almost unconsciously I started rhyming;
- - - Then through my mind it shot
That thus were all my master-works begot.
Straight from the slopes of Helicon the stream
Poured through the tap its music-making shower;
Bach floating bubble held a precious gleam -
Which grew to glory as a lyric flower;
Idly Ilaved my curls,
And from the sponge there dropped a rain of pearls.
Therefore, when back you hasten to my side,
Place this, my love, among your resolutions—
Though eggs grow chill and bacon petrified,
Never to hustle me in my ablutions;
And, to redeem your fault,
Order me several tins of Attic Salt.

AT THE PLAY.
“ALL Scotch.”
I HAVE long held the heterodox view
that no people on this earth have so
strong a sense of humour as the Scotch.
For the humourist must be judged not
only by his rapidity in seeing a joke,
but by the intensity of his receptive
powers when (if ever) he does see it.
And it is in this latter gift that the
Scotch excel. Unhappily Mr. GRATTAN,
at the Apollo, would have us believe in
their possession of the former faculty, of
which their worst enemies would never
accuse them. In a rather diverting
scene between an Edinburgh man and
a Glasgow man, where each in turn
points out the more contemptible fea-
tures of the other's city, the author
must have let off as many as six
crushing repartees per minute. This
matter. And, speaking always as an
Englishman, I think it might have
been made more palatable by mixture
with a little “allaying Thames.”

LITERARY FORECASTS.
[It is commonly predicted that the War
will effect a permanent change in our litera-
ture, but the following specimen, whose pub-
lication we are permitted to anticipate, shows
that we still have a literary genius who does
not propose to alter his methods for this or
any other war.]
I.—THE WoRLD WAR.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. H. G.
WELLs.)
It was all very curious and disgust-
ing, you know. Incredibly, even now,
wºmen I try to set down my impressions
of that day, my first in the firing-line,
it's all the little, incidental, unmeaning
frank defiance of statistical
records made all the other
improbabilities of the play
seem relatively credible.
In a private despatch (in-
tended for publication) Mr.
GRATTAN had forewarned me
that his work would contain
no “high - explosive topical
allusions,” and I will grate-
fully admit, to his credit, that
it bore no resemblance to a
revue. It Just consisted of a
few detached episodes illus-
trative of Scottish habits as
they are, or as they might
be if popular traditions corre-
sponded with the facts. . . .
These episodes were º:

nel overhead, and an occasional sheli
bursting near the ramparts and splat-
tering round muck—at intervals some-
one quite close to you crumpled up
pathetically—and, drowning it all, the
perpetual booming of our artillery pre-
paring for the attack . . . And then
there was Perkins—Perkins with his
red, oily face and little waxed hair-
dressery moustache, ostentatiously con-
cealing a greasy letter, and muttering
to himself in pure Cockney when he
thought anybody was listening, ludi-
crously sentimental and quite genuinely
affected by his own sentimentality.
One of his puttees had slipped down.
I caught that her name was Bertha.
I suppose I was horribly frightened.
One doesn't like admitting it in any
particular instance, though no reason-
able man would hesitate to own that
he probably would be in like circum-
T stances, so long as they re-
mained hypothetical; just as
the class of people we call
respectable revel in going to
church and assuring the Al-
mighty, with or without musi-
cal accompaniment, according
to sect, that they are the most
despicable of reptiles defacing
the earth, but are apt to get
stuffy if on the way home you
accuse them of snoring during
the sermon. But I was too
busy watching myself in a
! queerly detached way, for it
to matter much—watching to
see how frightened. I was
going to be, and wondering
whether I was any worse than
the others. And over it all,
donia; indeed there were moments
when I was well satisfied to be an
Englishman. Yet if you ask me,
“Stands Scotland , where it did 2"
I will at once reply that I have
allowed nothing in this play to
shift her by one inch from the place
she holds in my profound esteem.
Nay, I will confess that from time to
time I felt how my heart would have
swelled with pride if I had had the
right to wear one of those seductive
clan-tartans; or tread the purple heather
of the admirable scenery with native
foot; or claim, by kinship of race,
the privilege of communion with the
honeyed brogue of Miss JEAN AYLwiN
or of a glance from the glad eye of Miss
MARIE BLANCHE (how her very name
rings of the Highlands!).
In the despatch to which I have
alluded I was further forewarned that
All Scotch was “designed to cheer but
not inebriate.” And in truth it was
not a very heady blend, yet to one who
has never yet faced “a nicht wi' Burns”
an evening of All Scotch is no light
details that stick in my mind, jumbled
up with the jolly things that matter
enormously, in a queer, tangled sort of
way, it's true, but quite disconcertingly
and preposterously vivid for all that.
I want to give you the idea of those
main, basic things, but if I tried to
unravel it all I don't think I should get
it right; so I shall just jot everything
down inconsequently in the confused
order in which it comes, and trust that
it will clear itself up in the process,
that the image I want to produce will
emerge more distinctly out of the
haze . . . .
Outstandingly, in the first place,
there was mud–mud and smells and
empty tins, and a queer, pungent,
wholly unsuitable and astonishingly
natural atmosphere of rough jesting—
topping, honest, garlicky stuff that
people like archdeacons affect to con-
sider coarse; but very, very good for us.
Incidentally there was the noise—
sporadic, aimless little splutters of rifle
fire from the opposite trenches, the
melancholy whine of bullets and shrap-
you know, there was a curious un-
reality, a sort of glamour . . . One
realised that behind the muddling
and shuffling of the people who hide
their incompetence under officialdom
and call it diplomacy, in spite of the
stupidity and grooviness of the author-
ities, and the quite intolerable waste of
the whole business, there was some-
thing extraordinarily fine in it all . . .
‘. And then, quite suddenly, the inter-
vening space was dotted with funny
little khaki splotches, running wildly
and falling and jumping up and shoot-
ing and jabbing—I mechanically with
the rest; at least I suppose I was. I
certainly no longer had time to be
frightened. I think I just lost my
head; at home I should have broken
crockery; there I did my best to break
heads. Ridiculously, I chiefly remem-
ber trying not to squash some bluebells
—there was a little glade shimmering
with them in our path—and wondering
at Perkins. Perkins was having the
time of his life; he won the W.C. And
we gained 123 yards . .

groups of characters: Miss Crawley, who was forty and
could remember crinolines in Scotland (this statement
drew a passionate protest from me till I was overcome by
evidence); her married sister, Mrs. Darling, and their two
admirers, Tom Beamish and Professor Macpherson. These
are the elders. The young friends are Mrs. Darling's
daughters, Mr. Beamish's niece, and their respective swains.
There is also a younger generation still, represented by
Master Tony Darling, who is seven and passes a pre-
occupied existence in the sampling of patent foods and
systems of diet. And, as I say, there they all sit, prosper-
ous, happy, and very agreeable society—if you like South
Kensington. The greatest event in the book is supplied by
Miss Crawley's renting of a desirable country house (with
beams and a jolly garden and glazed chintz furnishings),
whither the entire coterie remove themselves and are
politely bored till a really alarming indisposition of poor
Tony stirs the placid lovers to an emotional crisis in which
they engage themselves each to each. As was to be
done. A pleasant book, but, I am bound to add, somewhat
soporific in its placidity.
No doubt you remember Maria, that so successful
creation of Mrs. John LANE. If so, you will be glad
to learn that in Maria Again (LANE) she bobs up as serene,
self-satisfied and suburbanly sophisticated as ever. Age
cannot wither her, though, to be quite honest, I did fancy
that custom had somewhat staled the effect of some of her
charm. Only some; for the most part she is all and more
than all her old self. As before, it needs copious quotation to
do justice to her conversation, her comments and her general
attitude towards life. “I know it's Wagner if the orchestra
makes an awful noise and the lights are put out, though
sometimes I wish they weren't, for there are bits in
Wagner when it's a real rest to read the advertisements
in the programme.” This comes in what I personally
thought the best chapter, a wholly delightful account of
a performance at Covent Garden, which I defy anyone
to read unmoved. Of course in real life one would
detest Maria for the very qualities that here make her
such entertaining company. Perhaps this is why Mrs.
LANE thought fit to pen a graceful little apology for her
revival under present conditions, in which she quotes a
true saying about the “duty of cheerfulness.” Maria, as
recorded here—and especially as depicted in a delicious
drawing by Mr. LEwis BAUMER—certainly makes that
duty considerably easier. And one can always console

oneself with the half-hearted belief that there are no Miss SHARP here as ever uses her art frankly as a weapon,
Marias left now ; and the sanguine hope that, if there are and it is quite possible that if (for example) you delight in
any such, there may always be a satirist as shrewd and
witty as Mrs. LANE to deal faithfully with them.
“Punch is the main thing in life, without which I will
not even try to exist. If I were very poor, I would go
short of three pennyworth of food weekly rather than miss
Punch.” Thus, and more, Miss BEATRICE CHASE, in her
new book, Through a Dartmoor Window (LoNG MANs), and
after it what can Mr. Punch, that most gallant of gentle-
men, do but bow, hand on heart, and return the compliment?

with this writer's former book, The Heart of the Moor, will
need any introduction to another moorland volume from
the same pen.
true devotee. Every real lover is worth hearing about the
beloved (though I am aware that there exists a prejudice
to the contrary), and it is the same with Miss CHASE when
she writes about Dart-
moor. She has an in-
timate and sympathetic
knowledge of her subject
which enables her to
transfer its charm to paper
with unusual success,
though her attitude of
mind may demand some
slight allowances on the
reader's part. Miss
CHASE's Dartmoor geese
are swans to the last bird;
and when, for example,
she depicts herself and her
mother (whom I somehow
wish she would not call
The Rainbow Maker) as

aggeration. It is so full of the clean, heather-scented air
of the moor, of wind and sunshine and wide spaces, that
to lose oneself in it is a holiday for the heart. Personally,
reading it over tea, I wondered discontentedly at the
absence of Devonshire cream. That shows you what
atmosphere can do.
Miss EvelyN SHARP, whose work I have admired ever
since the days of the old Yellow Book, has collected sundry
of her later sketches into a volume, and called it. The War
of All the Ages (SIDGwick AND JAckson). There is, I fancy,
something more in that title than meets the eye. I should
be astonished to hear that it refers chiefly to the battlefields
of Europe, though there are soldiers in plenty throughout
the book. As for the sketches themselves, you perhaps
know already the skill and the caustic, almost brutal, frank-
ness that may be expected in the telling of them. Perhaps,
though, as a friendly warning, I might call your attention
to the acknowledgment of leave to reprint, from which you
will learn that the contents of the volume have previously
| appeared in such diverse publications as The Manchester
Guardian, Pall Mall Gazette, Herald, Votes for Women and
| Morning Leader. This warning is the more needed since
her Pall Mall mood, the atmosphere of the Herald may
find you indignant, not to say outraged, and the other way
about. Personally, I own that I enjoyed the author best
when she is least controversial. “The Wounded Tommy,”
which is simply a record of soldier character as seen in a
French hospital, haunts one by its direct and unmanipu-
lated truth. It is, I may add, among the few studies in
which the Vote and the Female Problem are successfully
avoided. -
Perhaps you know Mr. HoRAcE HUTCHINson's pleasant
formula. A very slender plot, a sense of fresh air and
comradeship with bird and beast, characterisation not too

is shirked by the author.

the book more than counterbalance a little amiable ex-
itself by constant repetition.
If your appetite for War-matter is unsated by facts and
you feel inclined to take it in the supplementary form of
fiction, I can vouch that Mr. Douglas SLADEN in His
German Wife (Hutchinson) has catered for you up to, and
possibly beyond, your powers of absorption. Granted the
mood to enjoy a novel based upon the War, this ought to be
your book; but if you are in no such mood—as I am not—
I advise you to pass it by on the other side. Mr. SLADEN
has indeed worked the War for all it is worth, but how-
ever violently some people, with or without reason, have
suffered from the spy mania, I protest that the treatment
here accorded to Captain Isherwood's German bride is too
paltry for belief. In a note “To the Reader” Mr. SLADEN
states that, “though its action is chiefly after the outbreak
of the war, and though it has its tragedies, His German
Wife is in the main a love story, enlivened with ironies.”
My trouble was that the ironies entered into my soul, and
left me far from lively.

THE WAYSIDE CALVARY.
AUGUST 4TH, 1915.
Now with the full year Memory holds her tryst,
Heavy with such a tale of bitter loss
As never Earth has suffered since the Christ
Hung for us on the Cross.
If God, O KAISER, makes the vision plain;
Gives you on some lone Calvary to see
The Man of Sorrows Who endured the pain
And died to set us free—
How will you face beneath its crown of thorn
That figure stark against the smoking skies,
The arms outstretched, the sacred head forlorn,
And those reproachful eyes?
How dare confront the false quest with the true?
Or think what gulfs between the ideals lie
Of Him Who died that men might live—and you
Who live that men may die? -
Ah, turn your eyes away; He reads your heart;
Pass on and, having done your work abhorred,
Join hands with JUDAs in his place apart,
You who betrayed your Lord. O. S.
UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXV.
(From KING PETER of SERBIA).
SIR,-Between you and me there cannot, I suppose, be
any comparison. You have great possessions; I am but a
poor man. You are vigorous and age has not yet set its
mark upon you; I am broken by sickness and am bowed
down by years. You command the allegiance and the
resources of a great and mighty Empire; I am the chief of
a race of peasant folk living a life of toil and hardship in a
corner of Europe. In every point of wealth, power and
comfort you seem to have the advantage so manifestly on
your side that your superiority over me cannot be brought
into controversy or doubt. Yet, when I reflect, I feel
bound to tell you that, old and poor and broken as I am, I
| would not for all your riches and all your power and all
| the adulation of the parasites who surround you and
acclaim your Olympian magnificence, change years and
stations with you and be even as you are now.
You will not understand this. Whether you sit at home
in state or parade abroad amid the pomp and glitter of
arms, wherever, in fact, you are and in whatever character
you choose to appear, you seem to yourself so gloriously
and so indisputably the centre of the universe that you
cannot imagine how those who behold you or hear of your
deeds can refrain from praise and envy. “Here," you say
to yourself, “is a being selected by the Almighty for the
happiness of mankind. Let mankind realise his splendour
and his virtues and submit themselves humbly to him, lest
they be shattered against the iron wall of his might. Un-
questioning obedience is the highest merit when there is a
man fitted to receive it. Can any man be fitter than he
who reigns under Divine authority as German Emperor?”
Thus you address and persuade yourself, now posing as the
stern father of your country, now as the ruthless and
immitigable autocrat prepared to trample down his own
and other people and to hack his way through justice and
civilisation to the enforcement of his will on those who
have rashly presumed to withstand him. -
When Austria sent her legions against us and overran our
country, leaving a track of fire and devastation behind her
to mark the stages of her progress, we were steeled to resist
her by the knowledge that we were also fighting against
you; and when, by a marvellous achievement of Serbian
discipline and valour, we had hurled her forces back and
scoured Serbia clean of them, we rejoiced all the more be-
cause our efforts had struck a deadly blow at your arrogance
as well. Had it not been for you Austria would have paused
on the brink of war and might have recoiled from it alto-
gether, but your policy would thus, you thought, have
suffered a rebuff, and therefore you cast your vote for blood-
shed and plunged the nations into the horrors in which they
are still struggling. Some day history will record her verdict
—not certainly by the pens of German professors—and you
among the rest will receive the allotment of responsibility
that belongs to you. Nothing you now do can affect this,
for when the verdict is uttered your unquiet spirit will long
have ceased to trouble the world, and those who gave you
the incense of their flattery will also have submitted to
silence. How will your memory stand then? Is it not
possible, nay, is it not certain that in that great day of
revelation and judgment you will be recognised as the one
man who might have saved the world from blood and tears,
and refused so to save it because his vanity had suffered a
hurt?
So far Serbia has been able to defend herself with success.
She is determined to do her utmost in the future, because,
poor as she is and small as are her resources, she has a
burning love for freedom and a bitter hatred of oppression.
Germany and Austria may do their worst. They will find
our people ready both to fight and to endure. Great
material forces are against us, but we shall oppose them in
proud reliance on the justice of our cause and on those
great spiritual forces which have more than once turned
weakness to strength and have beaten tyranny down into
the dust. Receive, Sir, this my salutation,
PETER of SERBIA.

member of his staff, Mr. Punch is enabled to forestall the

tration, certain prominent public men are about to return

in addition to their present occupations?—
MR. WINstoN CHURCHILL.-Would willingly undertake
the work of any State Department, Admiralty preferred.
In that case would prefer to go to the Peers with the
title of Lord Dardanelson.
LoRD X.—Ready to attack all Ministers in the Coalition
Government in rotation.
MR. RAMSAY MACDoNALD.—Would undel take to serve
as shikari for tiger-shooting parties at the Zoo.
LoRD DUNRAvPN.—Would act as literary agent for the
supply of additional verses to the “National Anthem.”

to listen to him.

THE ZEPPELIN BAG.
AT the coming of the Zeppelins,
mother announced that it was our duty
to “take steps,” and her cautionary
zeal burns with ever-increasing flame.
Every time that she takes her walks
abroad she meets different friends, and
comes home to recount fresh “steps”
which it is our duty to imitate.
Mrs. A. has taken down a tea-basket
to the cellar.
Mrs. B. has placed buckets of water
all along the hall. -, -º -
Mrs. C. goes to bed in her—
“Rings' " concluded Emily hastily,
twirling the diamond cluster on her
third finger. “So do I, and I've sewn
new pink ribbons on my dressing-gown
and bought the duckiest cap to match.
No one can say I am unprepared ' "
the receptacle for our nearest and
dearest, we must shield it from danger
by day as well as by night.”
“I had fixed on the corner between
the oak chest and the Normandy cup-
| board,” Mother said. “Papa's croco-
dile bag will Just fit in, and it is in the
direct route for the front door. No one
could fail to see it.”
“Suppose I wanted to go away for
a week?” objected Father, who is
attached to his crocodile bag.
“Suppose,” said Frederick darkly,
“the bomb fell at the front door?”
But Mother had taken up the captive
pencil and was busily engaged in
jotting notes on the back of an old
envelope. . . .

bath sponge—the Japanese plant—my

found vent in a dark and stealthy plot.
With the connivance of the garden boy
she planned a false alarm, which should
test the agility of the household, in
preparation for the worst.
It was all meant for the best, but
when a rain of brick-bats comes clatter-
ing in through a bedroom window at
1 A.M. the startled sleeper is not
answerable for the consequences.
Emily fled, white-robed, into the night,
accompanied by such a tornado of
shrieks as brought the whole family
hurrying in her wake, to say nothing
of our neighbours at Highmead and
Mon Répos, and a tramp who had
happened to be sleeping under the
hedge. We propped Emily against
the pergola and scanned the heavens
for the flying monster, and the tramp

it were, the inmost sanctity of family
life.
“What about a few bottles of the
old port?” said Father.
“When one comes to the elemental
moments of life, one's sense of values
is altered,” said Frederick, with a
sententiousness bred of the Oxford
Union and not yet dissipated by a life
in camp. “When I ask myself which
of my belongings I should most grieve
to leave behind, my thoughts instinc-
tively fly to my bath sponge! He's
such a fine big fellow ; I've just
succeeded in knocking the grit out of
him and licking him into shape. . . .

sponge."
“And the Japanese plant," added
Florence with a gush. “The poor
lamb has only lived a hundred years.
Give him a chance to see the new

“Before I enter into the subject of
my best blouse,” said Emily seriously,
“let me clearly understand where the

Query—Emily's best blouse? . . . There

At this moment the postman delivered
a missive from Septimus enclosing a
half-yearly report of a depressing na-
ture, and concluding with a scribbled
postscript. “By the by,” he wrote,
“if a Zep comes along, you might
just rescue my trouser-press.”
The Zeppelin bag was placed in the
hall, with the trouser-press strapped
on its back, and enjoyed a peaceful
backwater sort of existence for several
weeks. Mother fed it regularly at
nights with knuckles of cold ham and
sandwiches of Gentleman's Relish (left
over from tea), which were destined to
restore our energies on the first halt of
our flight. Father contributed a box
of cigars, and on particularly Zeppeliny
nights Emily stole along the hall in
her dressing-gown and found a niche
for her best blouse. It seemed an
ominous coincidence that Frederick's
regiment should be transferred to
Aldershot on the very day that a
Zeppelin passed within two counties of
may blow up.”
“Did you feel a strange, irritating

Emily sobbed and sniffed sweet briar,
and said she didn't know. She was
greatly upset.
Mrs. Legh suggested that we should
adjourn to Mon Répos and partake of
a service of coffee and cake. “A little
Zeppelin party!” she called it, with an
attempt at lightness; but Mother said
firmly, “Not this evening; some other
evening,” and shooed us towards the
front door.
What precisely were her own feelings
in respect to the necessity of confession
we shall never know, for on the thres-
hold retribution overtook her.
As compensation for problematical
services the tramp had helped himself
to his reward.

A Member of the L.C.C.—“There are

it is undesirable to divulge, why we
should continue to employ what you
term “a battalion of able-bodied men'

An Official of the L.C.C. Tramways

A Park Superintendent.—“It is im-

proposes that, after term of attendance
at Westminster extending with brief
intervals over two years, House, having
put itself in order, shall adjourn till

That will never do. What is to be-

from native obscurity and looming
large in Parliamentary Reports?
With artful aid from epoch-making
newspapers, storm got up in Parlia:

view with alarm is prospect of a Coali-

country into irremediable disaster. Fact

may be summoned within a week—to
be precise in three days—immaterial.
At Question Time they went straight

propose to ask House to reassemble 2
Answer awaited with intense interest.
If PRIME MINISTER yielded to organized
clamour inside and outside House, it
would save time to hand straight over
to RAG, TAG and BobTAIL direction of
public affairs.
PREMIER's answer did not stray
beyond two brief sentences.
“The date on which I propose to ask
the House to reassemble,” he said,
“is the one I indicated last week.”
When burst of general cheering
subsided, he added, “I see no reason
whatsoever for altering it.” Whereat
House cheered again.

CARRYING ON.
“I SAY, IF You THINK You ought To ENLIST, or MAKE shBLLs or SoMETHING, MY SISTER AND I ARE QUITE READY To TAKE over
YOUR NET FOR THE NExT SIX WEEKS.
OF courts'E we would GIVE You THE sHRIMPs, YoU KNow.”
OUT OF THE PAST.
Both as a churchman and as a
human being the Vicar is very popular
with us all. Out of his cassock he is a
sportsman; in it he preaches the most
restful sermons of any cleric I know.
His attitude on questions of ritual and
the like may perhaps be in advance
of a portion of his flock, but to my
mind, though a little high, it is not
unpleasantly so; indeed, 1 have always
considered it to be in perfect keeping
with our fourteenth-century Gothic
chancel windows. Besides, we have
two very steadying churchwardens.
From Monday to Saturday, however,
there is one period of the day during
which, since the War started, I have
never voluntarily encountered the Vicar,
much as I like him ; and that is between
9.30 A.M. and 1 o'clock. This is what
may be called his Collecting period.
We have in the parish seven separate
funds connected with the War, admin-
istered by seven separate committees.
I myself am president of one committee,
my wife of another. The Vicar has a
hand in them all, and insists on every-
body contributing not only to the fund
in which he (or, she) is particularly
interested, but also to each of the other
six. This simple plan, he claims, in
addition to furthering the general cause,
has the advantage of minimising rivalry
between the various bodies and so of
preserving alive among us the spirit
of brotherly and sisterly love that
should characterise every Christian
community.
When, sitting by my open window
the other morning at about 11 o'clock,
I saw the Vicar open the gate and come
up the drive, I confess 1 winced. He
walked slowly, and his face wore the
thoughtful, half-guinea expression that
I knew so well. I wondered which of
the Committees he was representing
to-day. Probably Mrs. Jones's, which
had been recently formed to provide
our Indian troops with embroidered
pocket-handkerchiefs. Neither my wife
nor I had ever had any sympathy with
the Joneses. Yielding to the Vicar's
entreaties, we had called upon them on
their arrival in the neighbourhood, but
our subsequent intercourse with them
had been purely formal and conducted
on the strictest fortnightly terms, first
Tuesdays on their part and third Fridays
on his palm and lit it.
on ours; and even so we often gave
them a miss. With a sigh I got up,
took a sovereign and three half-crowns
out of my trouser pockets and locked
them away in my desk by the fireplace.
It was, I realised, a futile precaution to
take, but there are times when a man
will clutch at any straw. A moment
or two later the Vicar entered the
I'OOln.
“I'm so glad to have caught you,”
he said warmly.
“Don’t mention it,” I murmured.
“I hope the waterproof sheets are
going well.” The Waterproof Sheets
Fund is mine.
“Oh, yes, there is no trouble about
their going; our chief difficulty seems
to lie in the other direction.”
“Dear me!” he said thoughtfully.

enough she * >

it to me with a slight frown. The
Vicar is a man who likes to get to the
end of a sentence.
“Do you care for these ? " I asked.
“They are excellent,” he replied. “I
never really enjoy a cigarette except in
the morning. But to return to our
subject. Mrs. Jones, when I met her
half-an-hour ago, was saying - -
“One moment,” I interrupted.
“Don't you think we should be more
comfortable under the trees on the
lawn 2. It's frightfully hot indoors
this weather.” -
“I'm afraid I must be going
directly,” he answered. “I have five
other people to see this morning, and
I promised faithfully to be home again
by one o'clock.”
I rose from my chair. “So sorry you
can't stay longer. But of course we all
know that your time is never your
own.”
He looked at me a little sadly, yet
with an eye that seemed to read my
very soul. “Before I go,” he said, “I
must tell you why I have come.”
I sat down again. “Do,” I said
weakly. -
“It is to ask you for a contribution,”
he continued. - -
“I knew it,” I muttered. ' * - -
“To the Organ Fund,” he concluded.
“The what?" I exclaimed, hardly
able to believe my ears. -
“The Organ Fund. It has been
necessarily pushed into the background
of late, but I feel that we must not let
it go. The organ is badly in need of
repair.”
I sat in silence for nearly a minute,
while memories of the old days before
the War flooded across my brain, days
when the world was at peace and house-
hold coal at twenty-seven shillings
a ton, days when the issues of life
seemed simpler and the Organ Fund a
subject for really serious consideration.
Then I walked to my desk, unlocked it
and presented to the Vicar—no, not the
three half-crowns, not the sovereign,
but a five-pound note.
He left almost directly afterwards,
and I walked down the drive with him.
As we shook hands at the gate I fancy
the eyes of both of us were a little dim.

- II.
DEAR PETER,--Taking it all round
we like your country cottage immensely.
The Crystal Palace is, perhaps, a trifle
roomier, airier and better lighted, but
then of course we could not have got
| the Crystal Palace for a pound—or
| did you say a shilling?—a week; and,
besides, the Crystal Palace has no wild
roses climbing up the porch and no
pump in the scullery. True, your ceil-
ings are a bit low; but then one always
stoops when one is shaving, and one
| usually sits down at meal-times, and
one has to lie down' in bed, and one
never wants to dawdle about on a stair-
case, anyhow. At the same time I
wonder if you would have any objection
to my sawing a small piece out of the
Jacobean rafter in the sitting-room—
just sufficient to admit of my rising
from the breakfast-table without incur-
ring daily concussion of the brain 2 I
got up from the table this morning
| quite forgetting about the Jacobean
: rafter, with the result that the knob
: which I now wear on the top of my
head makes the sitting-room fit me
| worse than ever.
| Then there's the pump in the scul-
: lery.
and imagine that I am wilfully finding
fault. Pumps, spinning-wheels, sun-
dials, Jacobean rafters, inaccessibility
of doctor and post-office, bats, oldest
| inhabitant (if any), children biting the
hems of their pinafores—all these, my
dear Peter, combine to bring the scent
of the hay over the footlights, as it
were. I love them all. But I do
expect a pump to have a sense of duty
and convey water. What actually
happened the first day we arrived, with
our tongues lolling out for a cup of tea,
was this. After Joan and I had in
turn worked the pump-handle some
five thousand times each, we merely
º in pumping out a spider,
followed a quarter of an hour later by
about an egg-cupful of a dark and
sinister-looking fluid strongly impreg-
nated with rust. This would have been
acceptable if we had brought the canary
with us. It has recently moulted
rather severely, and has used up our
entire stock of rusty nails. But as a
basis for tea it was impossible, and
Joan went away to find a quiet corner
in which to die. I wasn't surprised.
A day at your pump, Peter, would
make even the health of emperors
ridiculous. -
However, your handy man,Wrighton,
of whom you told me, opportunely
looked in to see if he were wanted.
He was. I explained our trouble to
him, and he at once examined the pump
Now don't misunderstand me g
| with the eye of an expert—I suppose
there are pump experts? He said the
leather of the plunger had perished, and
he would fit another piece. Meanwhile
he would fetch us some water from his
private well. - -
Now, Peter, why don't you get a
well? It would be quite in keeping
with the rest of life in a country cottage,
and oughtn't to cost very much. After
all, a well is only a hole, and goodness
knows holes are cheap enough. Get
an estimate from a well-sinker, anyway.
While Wrighton had gone for the
water I went to look for Joan. I found
her lying down on the sofa in the
sitting-room in a state of utter collapse.
The poor girl had had to break into the
emergency-ration of chocolate-cream
which she had fortunately brought with
her, and was endeavouring to restore
her shattered faculties by reading a
copy of Country Life for December,
1911. (Your library is sadly out of date).
I said, “The leather of the plunger has
perished.” -
marked: “But the silk stockings of
the liftman's little neighbour (feminine)
have been saved. To-morrow we will
conjugate savoir and connaitre.” This
pump has reduced us. But we are
etting showly better. The oxygen
cylinder has gone back to town and we
no longer need to take nourishment
during the night.
You will be flattered to learn that
we followed your advice and took a
cold chicken down with us in the side-
car. It was thoughtful of you to men-
tion that Tuesday was early closing
day in Windleton, and that we should
have difficulty in getting in provisions.
As a matter of fact we did. The cold
chicken left us without giving notice
somewhere between Horley and Hor-
sham. If you should happen to know
anyone who lives between these two
places you might ask him to keep an
eye open (or, if he's not very busy,
both eyes open) for a cold— No,
never mind. It's no good counting
on spilt chickens. Besides, it's proba-
bly curdled by now. -
When I can spare the time I'm
going to devote a little attention to
taming your wild roses. One scratched -
me this morning as I was going into
the garden; not spitefully, mind you,
but (I believe) playfully. Or perhaps
you wilfully keep them in this fierce
condition to scare away tramps, just as
other people keep a watch-dog? If so,
watch-roses are indeed a novelty, and
I feel it incumbent upon me to stick up
a notice—“Beware of the wild roses.”
Talking of wild things, Joan wants to
start a goat. Wrighton, it appears, has
a spare one which he can't use. It is

THE SUPER-SALESWOMAN.
WHEN Irene understood that I had
put my services at the disposal of the
nearest Belgian refugee organisation
between the hours of eight and eleven
each evening she was not wholly
pleased. In fact she “murmured.”
“And what do you suppose that I
am to do with myself every night from
eight to eleven 2" she demanded.
I explained that there were many
little things to which the deſt fingers
of a really clever woman could turn.
Or, especially in these troublous times,
the inestimable boon of a period set
undisturbed
thinking. . . . -
“Oh, all right,” interrupted Irene.
Shortly after this she volunteered
to take duty each evening for an
insignificant and quite unofficial rival
effort calling itself Ons Huis.
You will at once understand the
If I get
through at the Maison Belge (our esta-
blishment) in an hour or two, I return
to a depressingly deserted flat. There is,
I discover, no more unadaptable hour
than that which lies between 9.30 and
10.30.
Things creak suddenly, too . . .
The other afternoon I got back from
| the office a little later than usual and
found Irene on the point of setting out.
“In another five minutes we should
have missed,” she remarked, with the
cheerful “take it or leve it "air of the
confirmed follower of duty.” “What
kept you?” - - - -
I explained that I had looked in at
| an emporium for a collar stud.
“Oh, come,” expostulated Irene," that
ought not to have taken half-an-hour.”
“It did not. - It only took half a
The remainder was spent in
finding someone to receive the money."
“But you need not have stayed,”
she suggested. . . .
“I need not,” I conceded, “but I did.
If I had not, the whole fabric of com-
mercial enterprise, as conducted on the
most modern principles, would have
fallen to the ground.”
Irene for once in a way was really
listening.
“Peter,”
“I shouldn't wonder *
Irene is an adept at what may be
called the suppressed climax.
“Wonder what 2 " I asked.
“Oh, nothing; just an idea. I must
bolt now. I am taking charge of our
sale of Belgian work to-night.”
“Good girl,” I said; “we must all put
our shoulder to the plough these times.”
I had heard something of their little

“I'm afraid not,” she confessed.
“The secretary marked the things at
bazaar prices. Gladys Limpstone had
charge last night, and, although she can
be most persuasive, everyone got off
by buying a picture-postcard.”
Life flowed placidly at the Maison
Belge that evening. By 9.30 I was on
my way back when a beautiful idea
occurred to me. Why should I not go
down to Ons Huis, slip'in, and from a
quiet corner view the proceedings un-
perceived 2 Then at the psychological
moment I would appear before her as a
customer. A modest trifle would be
well spent in providing that encourage-
ment. I pictured her gratitude quite
touchingly.
There is nothing formal about Ons
Huis. I pushed open a few doors,
murmured “Het spijt mijl” when I
ſound a family at home, and finally
discovered the right room. I had not
expected it to be exactly crowded, but
the sight of one aldermanly person and
one embarrassed youth almost put me
to flight. Fortunately Irene was ab-
sorbed in a copy of L'Echo. I reached a
strategic screen without being observed.
In a very few minutes I had grasped
the fact that Irene was not enter-
prising. Both the customers tried
in her direction in the vain hope of
provoking an advance on her part that
would enable them to cover a dignified
retirement under the purchase of a
postcard gröup. Finally the portly one
approached her.
“I’ve just been looking round,” he
remarked. - - -
Irene inclined her head in gracious
acknowledgment of the honour.
“Interesting stuff, but everything is
pretty dear, you know,” he continued.
“Very dear, if you don't mind my
saying so.” - - - - - -
“I don't,” agreed Irene. “I’very-
thing is ridiculously dear.”
“Bless my soul!" he ejaculated,
“you don't say so?” .
The strange young woman shrugged
indifference.
“If I don't I express myself rather
badly,” she added. -
“But " — he continued to stand
there in a fascinated helpless way—
“but this is most unbusinesslike.”
“That is because attendants cannot
always afford to be strictly truthful.
You see, I don't do this as a business.”
“So I judge.” There was nothing
subtle about the man. “Well, my
wife had a look round yesterday, and
the young lady who was then in your
place tried to . make out that there
never were such bargains.”

“Miss Limpstone?” she remarked.

“I suppose it isn't," agreed Irene

handkerchief of many colours and
began to cross the room. -
“I’ll have a look at it,” he muttered.
“Do,” replied Irene. “But it is
nothing but wood—just wood sawn
and polished and fastened together.”
“It's very good wood, though,” he
retorted quite sharply, “and the work-
manship is excellent. Yes, I'll—”
“Twenty-seven shillings and six-
pence,” breathed Irene. “It seems
terrible—to me.” *

Irene stood in need of encouragement)

Irene sought to dissuade this innocent
young creature from buying an elaborate
piece of Brussels lace (three guineas).
While she was booking the order I fled.
To tell the truth, I was afraid to be
left alone with Irene and her stock.
I have since learned that Irene took
£27 15s. 9d. that night. But perhaps
the saddest part of the whole business
was the treatment of Gladys Limpstone,
for the Committee deputed the most
tactful of their number to wait upon
..her and ask her if she could not be a
little more pushing and -seductive in
her methods the next time she took

THE ANTI-TORPEDO BATHING OUTFIT.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SINCE a title like Subjects of the Day (ALLEN AND UNWIN)
points one inevitably to a certain unrestful theme, it was
with a shock almost of happiness that I was reminded that
such matters as Home Rule and Woman Suffrage, for
instance, are still extant. True, gratitude on no better
foundation might not have kept me good-tempered long;
but fortunately throughout the speeches and occasional
memorial notices of Lord CURZON, here collected, there is
in the lofty sincerity which is their note an abundant
ground for more permanent thanksgiving. From the first
speech of the series, the one in which, as ex-Viceroy, he is
proposing the toast of the British Dominions Beyond the
Seas, a single persuasion seems to dominate his thought.
From a purely literary point of view the volume may
suffer a little—I dare say it does suffer—from the lack
of continuity unavoidable in a reproduction of spoken
addresses; but beyond question the book is welded into a
whole by the patriotic spirit that inspires it. To be sure,
in many of these utterances of the last ten stormy years—
the period here covered—the partisan attitude obtrudes
itself. But the broad truth about these speeches, no less
apparent in Lord CROMER's introduction, is that they are
an expression of that unfearing and responsible imperialism,
justified beyond all words to-day, which even the most
determined Little Englander—if such a creature still
exist—at the bottom of his heart loves and understands.
It is the negation of jingoism, the antithesis of Prussian
militarism. And in the reading of this book the staunchest
advocate of Radicalism may well consent to forgive Lord
CURzoN's occasional distrust of Democracy, and be glad
that in this time of crisis he has been called to a place in
the councils of the nation.
1 am a little baffled as to what to say about The
Driving Force (LoNG). There are good ideas in it, and
praised for qualities of sincere and acute observation; yet
it is precisely in these that his latest book seems to miss
the mark. Perhaps you read One of the Multitude, that
exceedingly human document, in which the early struggle
of a slum-child towards self-respecting manhood was de-
scribed with simple and therefore very moving sincerity
by a writer who had himself experienced the conditions
about which he wrote. In The Driving Force you get
again the same sense—unmistakable and not to be counter-
feited—of the life of the mean streets seen from within ;
but, though I am pretty sure that the characters them-
selves are true, it seems to me that Mr. Acorn has yielded
to the temptation to manipulate them into “situations.”
The result is a disappointing impression of artificiality.
The chief theme of the story, the counteracting effects of
heredity and environment, is lost sight of in a maze of
rather irrelevant happenings; while the long-lost-child
motive is handled in a way that imposes an unfair strain
upon the reader's credulity. It is in little pictures and
incidents by the way that the best of the book is found.
The first chapter, for example, with its account of the slum
children starting for their country fortnight, is excellently
done, with truth in every touch of it. This makes me
confident that, if Mr. Acorn will avoid elaborate plots and
confine himself to the simple record of things seen and
remembered, he has an equipment that will yet place him
in the front rank of our realists.
My enthusiasm for those fine soldiers of the resilient
Russian line, that bends and breaks not, gives me no clue
to the higher qualities of the strange tales in The Old House
(SECKER), by FEQDoR SoLogub. I just don't know quite
what to make of them, and I hope such ineffectual candour
amounts to a criticism not a prejudice. They seem—some-
times at least—to go beyond the point of extravagant
fantasy towards incoherence and morbidity. Mr. John
CourNos, the translator, urges me in a sympathetic preface
always to look for the underlying “intense symbol of
Mr. GEORGE Acorn is a writer who has been deservedly; reality,” and instances particularly, the powerful story,

| The invoker of the Beast," a nightmare of treachery and
terror. I can only say that what Mr. CourNos finds is
hidden from me, but that he is the more likely to have the
right kind of eye and seems an honest soul. I did indeed
find a kind of epitome of national strategy in the long story
of “The Old House” (which deals with the tragedy of a son
hanged for conspiracy), a marching forward towards the
attack and a skilful retirement renewed again and again,
and certainly, also a brooding atmosphere cleverly created
| of poignant tragedy, and some exquisitely outlined portraits.
Am I wrong in thinking that the magic of the long-drawn-
out preparation and comment resided in the felicitous and
delicate choice of the precise word, and that a little of it
which he very capably turned to good advantage. Whether -
the failure of the examination system and the worthless
or not the story contains autobiographical passages I will:
not pretend to guess, but the author has certainly, -
beguiled into inserting various events and conversations of
little intrinsic interest and with no particular bearing on
the plot; also into dwelling at disproportionate length on

Dick, and the comedy of his experiences (especially as a
schoolmaster) is well worth reading. As for the letters.

OUR SCHOOL.
By Poppett MINIMUS.
OUR school is top-hole this year. It
has always been the best school, but
this year everybody admits that it is
absolutely top-hole. So now you know
which school it is. Verbo sapo sat ;
this is Latin, and I've put it in for
swank.
We've just had our Speech Day,
which wasn't like any ordinary rub-
bishy Speech Day. Nearly everybody
was in khaki, even some of the
Governors, and some fellows' sisters
and relations were in nurses' uniforms.
My people weren't half bad this year
and I introduced them to Dawes. He
was cock of the school last half,
of France I learnt a lot of irregular
verbs to show my sympathy. The
Upper Fifth said it was a point of
honour to learn all the French we
could. There was terrific competition
for the French prizes. Mossoo made a
fine speech in French, and we cheered
every sentence. I understood honneur,
capur, entente, patrie, and cheered like
mad when they came in. I didn't

Parker, who is going in for the

he is sure the German master, before he
left, scattered germs everywhere, and
that I got the lot of them (I was simply
covered) and saved the whole school.
I expect he is right. He put on his
most professional air, and said anyhow
they were part of the unscrupulous
decrees of Providence. I must have
had about ten thousand.

A real top-hole bishop gave away
the prizes this year. Not an
ordinary bishop, like we had last

Parker, who is going in for the

than other bishops. But this
bishop was top-hole anyway, and
some of the things he said about
patriotism were simply spiffing. I

THE MAKING OF A SOUL.
THE Witches were making a soul.
Once in every hundred years it is permitted to them, for
services they have rendered, to make a soul and to choose
a human being whose body that soul shall inhabit.
Of course there were three Witches; it is well known
that, they always work in threes, finding this number
convenient for their business.
Now it is a mistake to suppose that Witches are always
ill-disposed and wicked. They are often as good as other
people; but they have their moods, and sometimes they are
both capricious and mischievous. -
Thus they acquire a bad reputation among staid folk and
have often been punished for faults which they have not
committed and for vices which, at the moment, they do not
possess. At other times, however, they have committed
faults which have escaped without notice, and have been
full of wickedness which has been attributed to others.
On the whole, therefore, no great injustice has been
done, although the rules of evidence have been strained
against them in Old England and New England and
elsewhere.
Now on this particular occasion they were, as I have
said, busy with the making of a soul; and I am sorry to
say that two of them were in their most mischievous
and disgraceful mood. They had been chasing wild cats up
and down craggy precipices and had had only poor sport.
The third was in a better humour, but she had been
riding a thousand miles on a new but well-broken broom,
and she was now tired and was hardly capable of opposing
her two disreputably-minded sisters.
All this, I ought to mention, took place more than fifty
years ago.
The third Witch, the benevolent one, was the first to
speak aſter they had come together.
“Do not,” she said, “let us spend a long time over this
soul-making. I have by me quite a nice soul which I made
in my summer holidays last year. Why shouldn't we use
that and get the business over ?”
“Nonsense,” said the first Witch.
“Quite a nice soul, indeed!” said the second. “Do you
mean that you put good things into it?”
“Well,” said the third Witch rather shamefacedly, “per-
haps I did. I put in loyalty • ?
“Pooh ” said the first Witch.
“And generosity,” said the third.
“Pish !” said the second.
“And modesty,” added the third.
“Good gracious!” said the other two together, “our
sister is wandering in her mind.”
“Oh, have it your own way then,” said the third ; and she
threw away the soul she had made and went to sleep on a
rock. - -
“Here's a handful of cruelty,” said the first Witch.
“And here's a peck of faithlessness,” said the second.
“Let's put them in before she wakes up.”
So they put them in.
“Here's a whole heap of vanity,” said the first Witch.
“In it goes,” said the second; “and here's a wagon-load
of braggadocio.”
“Splendid ' " said the first Witch; “but we mustn't
forget envy and malice * x
“Excellent ' And all uncharitableness,” said the second.
“That'll about do,” said the first. “Now who's to
have it 2."
“We can't do better than send it to Berlin,” said the
second. “There will be a new princeling there in two
shakes of a cat's whisker.”
“Right,” said the first; and together they blew the soul
away on its voyage through the air.
“We shall have some fun some day,” they said.
But the third Witch continued to sleep. She isn't really
responsible for the things that have happened.
THE BUSY B’S.
BUCHAN and BELLoc are wonderful men,
Equally nimble with brain and with pen,
Swiftly eclipsing their college compeers,
Destined for fame from their earliest years.
BUCHAN at Oxford—I quote from Who's Who—
Mopped up the STANHoPE and NEwdigaTE too;
Published three books, shone at Union debates,
Romped through his schools, with a First Class in
Greats. -
Owing allegiance awhile to the law,
Wider horizons in action he saw,
Joining Lord MILNER away at the Cape,
Helping South Africa out of her scrape.
Hardly less wondrous achievements were those
Wrought by brave BELLoc in life, verse, and prose,
Writer of anti-Semitic lampoons,
Pilgrim-apostle of all picaroons.

Member of Parliament, champion of beer;
Viewed by his party with feelings of fear;
Gunner of old in the army of France,
Publicist, orator, mystic, free-lance.
So, when the War-cloud exploded in flame,
Even more bellocose BELLoc became;
While to his feat in appeasing the Dutch
BUCHAN has added the new “Nelson" touch.
Each wrote war chronicles, vast and unique—
One came out monthly, and one once a week—
Each took to lecturing night after night,
Filling their hearers with awe and delight.
BELLoc excelled in the diagram dodge;
BUçHAN in breezy avoidance of stodge;
Multitudes hung on the lips of HILAIRE;
BUCHAN led off with E. GREY in the chair!
BUCHAN, whose brain works abnormally fast,
Gives us an output stupendously vast,
Vying in manner with NAPIER and PoE,

BELLOC finds time to complete or rewrite

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WINDING UP OUR WATCH.
(A Little Lecture on the War after the
style of “The Spectator.”)
IT is our national habit to wind up
our watches before we go to bed. So
deeply is this custom rooted in the
British character that it is safe to
assert that on any given evening, in the
majority of the better-class bedrooms
in the Metropolis, this rite is being
performed at the close of the day. A
man will take his watch from his
pocket and the key from the dressing- || out the key after the sinking of the
table drawer, unless his watch --
is “key less,” and with an
absent-minded air will—well,
wind it up. Even in quite
unfamiliar surroundings — in
the state-room of a steamer
or the sleeping-car of a Con-
tinental express—an English-
man seldom forgets to wind
his watch. The thing is so
well established that it is held
in certain cases to be a test of
sobriety; it is only when a
man has lost control over him-
self that the rite is omitted.
It is quite a distinctive
national habit. A Frenchman
or a Swede will often usefully
employ his spare moments *
with his watch-key. Who has
not seen passengers waiting,
for instance, at the Gare de
Lyons for their train, taking
out their watches and wind-
ing them up 2 If, and when,
the foreigner finds himself in
a theatre queue or is kept wait-
ing on a door-step or has to
fill in an interval between
courses at table d'hôte, he
winds his watch. But John
Bull waits till the last moment
of the day. It is one of our
most striking manifestations
of insularity, like catching a
train at a run, like spare
bedrooms, like the hat-rack -
in the hall. (We hope some day
soon to do one of our Little Lectures
on the Hat-rack in the Hall.)
In the supreme moments of his fate
a man will not act with any fresh
extraneous impulse or display an un-
wonted trend of behaviour. His actions
are rather on the lines of intensified
habit (as we observed three years ago
in dealing with the coal strike. Our
readers are certain to remember the
phrase and we cannot do better than
repeat it). It is the same with a nation.
scale. What we are doing now, as a
nation, is to wind up our watch at the
last moment.
It is painfully true that it is the last
moment, the very latest, ultimate, final,
terminal minute of the eleventh hour.
But all the same we may rest assured
that we are winding it up. We might
— and of course we should — have
wound it up after the fall of Antwerp.
We might assuredly have begun to
wind it up after the bombardment of
Dunkirk. We might at least have got
“Porter, SIR2"
Lusitania. But that is not John Bull's
way. There is no need to repine. We
must get things done as best we can,
however much better it would have
been to do them otherwise. Let us
rather record the fact with humble
satisfaction that the watch is being
wound at last.
It is a terribly close shave. It is
now an open secret that we are at this
moment escaping by the skin of our
teeth from a series of hideous calami-
|ties. We cannot specify them here.
In our present predicament we cannot Above all it is our duty to be nebulous
hope to show the stolid fatalism of the and vague. But all the world knows
Japanese or the sunny insouciance of that if we had not bestirred ourselves
the Spaniard. We can only reproduce exactly as we have bestirred ourselves
our peace-time qualities on a grander in the very nick of time our prospects
now would be black indeed. As far as
we can estimate (and you may rely as
usual upon our estimates), if a certain
threatened new offensive against our
lines had begun as early as 10 A.M. on
the morning of last Tuesday week we
should have been in desperate straits.
It is not yet ready to begin. After a
very careful survey of the progress of
the Eastern campaign and a considered
appreciation of the German offensive
there, we are able to state with some
confidence that this Western offensive
will not be launched sooner than the
afternoon or evening of Mon-
day, August 16th, and if all
goes on as we expect we shall
be in a safe position to meet it
= | by midday (Greenwich time)
on the 13th. It is very fortun-
ate. We do not, of course,
deserve to do any good, but
British luck and British re-
liance upon domestic habit in
the individual is just going to
pull us through yet again.
We hate to prophesy — al-
though we are always at it—
but we are inclined to hazard
the forecast that any dispas-
sionate and well-informed ob-
server who surveys the exact
position on, let us say, the last
Tuesday in August, or better
still perhaps the following
day, will recognise that we
have rightly diagnosed a
rather obscure development
and that (with very little to
spare) the nation has rounded
the corner. . . . .
We shall have wound up
our watch; and when it is
wound up (unless it is allowed
to fall on the floor or is thrown
out of the window or meets
with any other incidental
calamity) we may be certain
that the watch will go, and
will not cease to go till we
- have reached a victorious
issue. But one last word of warning.
Our metaphor—for the first time, as
far as we can remember—is not
quite perfect. For when the watch
is finally wound up it would indeed be
fatal if the nation got into bed and
went to sleep.
From a War-lecture programme:–
“Colonel Frederic Natusch Maude, C.B.,
the eminent military critic, was born in 1874,
and educated at Wellington College and the
Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on the
staff of which he afterwards served. He
entered the Royal Engineers in 1873.”
Some of the other experts consider that
the gallant Colonel took an unfair ad-
vantage of them in starting his military
education before he was born. ..

cHATTo AND THE PEssimist.
[Pessimist : “One who has something wrong
with his feet.”—Unknown School Genius.]
His mouth was like twenty-five past
seven on a long-faced clock. He was
at his usual game spreading dumps
1 over the widest area he could reach.
The rain was falling pitilessly; the
hotel verandah was full; spirits were
low; the Pessimist alone seemed cheer-
He had the company held by his
glittering eye. - -
“Just the weather for the Germans,”
he croaked; “it helps them with their
poison gas.” - - -
This bright thought appeared to
cheer him, but the little yellow opti-
mist in the cage above his head
stopped abruptly his tune of hope and
brighter skies to come. His wooden
brother in the Swiss clock seemed to
be making frantic efforts to burst forth
| and say something, but subsided with
a rusty brrrr of disgust. The stream
of poison gas went flowing on—
Warsaw having now fallen, the turn
of Petrograd would come. General
von Schtuffenheim, the grandest strate-
gist in the world, was planning a
swift raid upon Odessa. The British
working-man was in German pay,
as were Bulgaria and Roumania.
All three would soon throw off their
mask, and so would President WILson.

ship in their Navy with a gun which
could drop shells from Antwerp into

“Hallo, Gargoyle,” cried he, “at it

How's the gout 2."
The Pessimist replied with a sigh
that it had partly left his toe, but that
he was feeling twinges in the knee.
“A very bad sign,” said Chatto in
his most sepulchral voice. “It is
striking upward to the brain. That's
the way my poor Uncle George went,
or at least would have gone, had he not
taken it in time and stayed in bed.
That's where you ought to be this

The Pessimist was frightened. “I
have never seen such a fellow as you,
Chatto,” he grumbled. “In you come
and scare the lot of us out of our lives
with your confounded pessimism. I
shan't go to bed.”
But Chatto knew his man and stuck
to him. He was soon able to lead a
cowed Pessimist gently inside, en-
couraging him with murmurs of, “A
week in bed will pass like a dream.
Plenty of hot mustard!”
Before parting, Chatto winked upon
the assembled company and said,
“You mustn't mind anything he's been
saying to you. He's a dear old chap—
I've known him for years. He's all
right, but "-and here he tapped his
forehead significantly—“he thinks he's

Here the sun came from behind a

kerchief and smiled again; the canary
resumed grand opera, and the cuckoo
burst forth from his châlet and crowed
defiantly thirteen times.

You SILLY Idiot, Why on earth
didn't you tell me you kept wasps
down here?, I had no idea you went
in for such a hobby. But why is your
vespiary at the bole of the apple-tree,
immediately outside the sitting-room
window? Have you any specific objec-
tion to my drugging it and removing it
to a nice empty hole at the back of the
wood-shed 2 I will then revive it with
sal-volatile, and inform the neighbours
that the change of premises does not
mean any suspension of the regular
business, and that they may be stung
from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. as heretofore.
I am emboldened to suggest this
alteration because yesterday morning
at breakfast, the window being open to
admit a balmy Sussex draught, one of
your wasps wanted the honey at the
same moment that I did. Joan, who
is no vespiphile, flicked her table-
napkin and said, “Shoo!” The wasp
must have misunderstood her, for it
immediately settled on the back of my
hand and sat down on its pointed end.
The result was that I said “Help!”
though Joan makes out that I muted
the final letter.
Unfortunately we had brought no
ammonia with us. The nearest ap-
proach to that useful alkali that we
possessed was a bottle of ammoniated
quinine, some of which I applied faute
de mieur. I can't tell whether it did
any good or not, because I don't know
what would have happened if I had
not applied it. Joan thinks the wound
would have “gathered,” but I imagine
she is confusing a needlework term.
Now you know why I want to move
your wasps, Peter. The alternative is
to eat our honey elsewhere. But bread
and honey is so essentially a parlour
dish (has it not as such long since
received the cachet of royal example?)
that to eat it in the scullery, say, or
in one of the bedrooms, seems to me
seriously malapropos.
You may be interested to know that
our honey was a local industry. None
of your New Zealand frozen honey for
us, my boy! We bought it in the village,
at a most unpretentious little shop.
Its one window contained a cucumber,
the butt-end of which was immersed in
a jam-pot of water, and four round
glass jars containing respectively bulls'-
eyes, Pontefract cakes (which badly
needed repolishing), nothing, and
“Windleton Mixture.” There was also
a card displayed bearing the legend—
HONEY FROM OUR OWN BEES
RUN OR COMB.
I remarked to Joan one day as we were
passing the shop. “But what does
“run or comb' mean? Is there a dis-
tinction in honey, as there is in butter
—fresh or smoked 2" Joan explained.
“Anyhow, we'll have it in the comb,”
she said ; “then if we find we don't
like it in that form we can run it.
Whereas if we buy run honey, and we
find that, after all, we want it in the
comb * >
Now, Peter, an idea has occurred to
me. Do wasps make anything? I
can't recall any mention of it in Lord,
Avebury, but I have a sort of notion
that they make frumenty. (Joan says
that frumenty is a disinfectant.) At
any rate there is the idea in my mind,
and what possible object should I have
in imagining that wasps make frumenty
if they don't 2 What I wish to do,
then, is to have a card printed to hang
in the sitting-room window —
FRUMENTY FROM our own WASPs
THICK OR CLEAR.
Meanwhile, let me know if I can send

I much regret to say we were un-
successful in our attempt to procure
you the asparagus-servers and the
scent-bottles offered in the Lawn
Tennis Tournament. Joan attributes
our failure to the fact that whenever it
was my service I played the Ruy Lopez
gambit (six balls in the net and two in
the Vicar's orchard); while I put it
down chiefly to Joan's persistently
playing the “nullo” game. Even so,
this is hardly sufficient to account for
our being defeated six-love in two con-
secutive sets by a brace of sheer
rabbits. The truth is that our op-
ponents' strong point was their appall-
ing feebleness, and I tell you without
shame, Peter, that to be served soft
under-hand lobs without a soupçon of
‘googly' about them by a left-handed
auctioneer clad in a pink shirt, grey
flannel trousers, plimsolls, and a straw
hat with a hat-guard, absolutely de-
moralised us, who have spoken to
GoRE and RITCHIE (“Oh, good return,
Sir!” from the covered stand). The
auctioneer's partner was of that
neophytic type that “also serve,” but
chiefly “stand and wait”; but I am
told that she does a great amount of
good amongst the poor in the village.
And now I regret (yet also rejoice)
to say something else: I am obliged to
bring my tenancy of “The Yews” to a
premature close to-morrow, Friday. I
quite forgot to tell you, when I entered
into treaty with you for the occupation
of these premises, that I had previously

- GABRIELLE.
THEY are over now, those evenings
when I sat by my open window and
Gabrielle sang to me in the gloaming.
But sometimes still, when the sun has
sunk below the western edge and
the daylight slips into dusk, I lie
back in my chair and close my eyes
and conjure up the memory of her
Wolce.
It was always the same song that
Gabrielle sang—a song without words,
sweeter, subtler far than anything that
MENDELssohn ever wrote. Hers was
a voice to hear once and dream of for
ever, a voice of little volume, at its
strongest just a fragile ecstasy of
melody, yet ringing clear and pure,
like the echo of a rim of fairy glass
smitten with a thread of silver. But it
was in its softer notes that it was most
wonderful. Even now I can hear their
sustained sweetness as they fell faintly
and more faintly still on the ear, till at
length they soared and died on the last
frail gossamer stair between sound and
silence. So sang Gabrielle, invisible
always. Yes, I never saw her, though
I could well picture her as I knew she
must be, slender and petite in form, her
eyes and face aglow with the rapture
of the music that was her life.
And then very simply, very sadly,
the end came. There seemed no sound
in all the world that night, that rose-
fragrant night in June, save the voice
of Gabrielle singing to me in the
shadows. For awhile I sat and listened
motionless, fearing to break the spell;
but at last in a moment of forgetfulness
I raised my hand to the cushion behind
my head. Heaven knows I never
meant it as a gesture of invitation, yet
as such must my singer have inter-
preted it. She came. Swift as a wave
to the shore, straight as a swallow to
its nest, Gabrielle came to me. It was
a brief meeting. Stung with a stab of
pain, I dashed my hand wildly down,
and all that was left of her was a small
brown smudge upon the window-sill.
She had gone, my Gabrielle—gone, I
trust, where all the good gnats go.

It seems about time to issue the more

HUMOURS OF A REMOUNT DEPot.
THE WATCH DOGS.
XXV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, We have moved
along again and have struck a new joy
in life. It was one of those quiet and
ostentatiously peaceful afternoons in
the trenches, upon which anything may
happen anywhere, at any time, and it is
just as well to stay in your dug-out
lest it happen on or about you. I was
lying “at home,” but, no callers arriving
and the harmonious drone of a thousand
local blue-bottles producing its inevit-
able effect, I was just about to enjoy
an hour or two of the best when I was
aroused by a knocking on the floor. I
am not used to being approached in
this indirect manner, so rather than
invite the knocker to come in, I myself
went out. Being unable to obtain
redress from our own people, I sought
out an R.E. officer, whom I knew to
reside in our alley for no honest pur-
pose.

and body from underneath. The R.E.
officer, a genial villain, told me all about
it, but was not, as far as I could see,
ashamed of himself.
It appears there is a class of English-
men to whom even the present methods
of trench warfare are not satisfying.

in question.
It is always possible, of course, for
men have conceived such a dislike for one of our galleries to join up accident-

would convey nothing to you, but the
sound of the stuff itself (when ignited)
would explain everything. I was about
to rebuke him sharply for daring to
smoke in the presence of so vulnerable
an explosive when he went on to tell me
that the two little buttons at his side
had only to be depressed to bring to a
climax arrangements which had been
made to elevate the very trenches I
occupy myself, when and if occasion
should demand. With me it was the
work of an instant to decide that I
would do or deny myself anything to
keep in his best books.
The knocking I had heard was ap-
parently some way off and had already
been noted. The R.E. were reserving
the knocker's fate and leaving to him
at least the pleasure of doing the bulk
of the burrowing. As events turned
out, the noises ceased altogether while
To do this needs but a slight adaptation
of old words, and so, when the rumour
goes round that sounds have been heard
and we may ascend skywards at any
moment, the company clusters round
its Sergeant-Major and sings, with
pathetic insistence, “Don’t go up in
the mine to-night, Daddy!”
Having indented for every conceiv-
able thing a soldier can possibly want
or wear, all forms of uniform and
equipment, arms and tools, we had the
bright idea of indenting in an entirely
new line. We indented for men, and
in due course these arrived from our
base companies, their faces reminding
us of those good old days in England
when our military operations were con-
fined to dealing with an enemy who
either did not retaliate at all or, at the
worst, did so with blank ammunition.
Upon their arrival they were inspected
they were waiting, from
which they concluded that
the work was complete and
the charge laid. This they
proved by some burrowing
of their own, conducted,
no doubt, very gingerly.
Having discovered the ac-
tual charge and for all their
professional knowledge of
the touchiness and temper
of the creature, they pro-

THE SKIPPER.
(A Sketch from the Front.)
THERE never was such a one as our
Skipper (the name by which we always
call the Captain of our Company—
“B” Company, if you please). A
more unmilitary figure probably never
was seen, and many have been the
wagers that his circumferential ex-
ceeded his longitudinal measure, whilst
he himself has been heard to deplore
his contours. An old campaigner, he
trod the veldty wastes of the Transvaal
during the South African campaign,
but, like a true soldier, he never dwells
on the subject. His age might be any-
thing from thirty-five to forty-two. He
swears like a Colonial—on occasions—
but represses any disposition to emulate
his example on the part of his
subalterns, maintaining that it º
is the prerogative of the O/C.
Company. His own extenuation
is forthcoming in the cryptic
utterance that it is necessary
for him to “Speak a language
understanded of the people.”
He came to us in the fall
of 1914 from another regiment,
after waiting—as he has re-
peatedly told us—a matter of
fourteen weeks for a “call,”
although packed with qualifica-
tions, having letters before his
name in the Army List and *

startled by the sounds of exploding
bombs and hurried firing of rifles; at
which happening our senior Subaltern
(whose love for the Skipper exceeds
the love of women) would proceed to a
sap head to await tidings, and later
welcome him and breathe a heavy
sigh of relief as the rotund and mud-
died figure of the Captain loomed
into sight.
It would require a book to detail all
the adventures of the Skipper in Tom
Tiddler's Ground—as we called it. His
lonely scrap with a big German patrol
he dismisséd quite briefly. The bomb-

THE TYRANNY OF EALING.
(By an Inner Circler.)
WHEN, as Evensong is pealing,
Campden Hill-wards bound,
I desire to reach my shieling
By the Underground;
As I humbly stand, appealing
To the indicator, “Ealing”
Only can be found.
Endless trains stream past me, dealing
' Disappointment dire,
Bringing neither balm nor healing
To assuage my ire;
For they're packed from floor to ceiling,
And the eternal cry of “Ealing”
Sets my brain on fire.
So I stand, my senses reeling,
Anguish in my soul,
As the trains with jolt and squealing
Ever onward roll,
Most conclusively revealing
That the whole world finds in Ealing
Its appointed goal.
To the isle of Cocos-Keeling

I’UNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOMMEVERE-EN-FRANCE.
ONLY Guillaumism, I felt, could have
got me to reside for more than one night
in the little town of Sommevere-en-
France; but I am glad of the experience,
for the Sommeverians are a pleasant
placid folk with a pretty taste in open
fruit tarts, and for the cool of the even-
ing they can offer the stranger both a
river and a canal. Not an ordinary
canal, but a canal which runs right
away into the Detestable Land and, a
mile from Sommevere, is so adventurous
as to leap across the river by a gleam-
ing white bridge. Upon the canal are
many barges, whose main function as
carriers being for the time suspended
now lie moored to the trees by the
bank, and shelter huge families of
refugees together with dogs of a
thousand-and-one strains. "
Sommevere-en-France itself must be
one of the neatest provincial towns in
the world. Built by a monarch of
orderly mind though somewhat irregu-
lar habits (as one Diane de Poictiers
could relate) it fulfils a rectangular
plan. In the middle of it is a square;
within that is a smaller square of lime
trees, whose branches have been se-
verely cut into cubes; and in the middle
of that is a fountain. From this foun-
tain radiate the four principal streets.
The fountain itself, rather daringly
in such close proximity to the real
article, represents the great and beauti-
ful and very green and now poignantly
historic river on which Sommevere-en-
France is situated as a bronze lady: a
feat of imagery which, since the stream
can be seen only a few yards away,
has the effect of turning the youth of
the town into either poets or, by way of
protest, realists, and suggests that some
limit of distance should perhaps be set
upon symbolic sculpture.
There, however, she stands, this
bronze lady, not much more motionless
than—especially on Sundays and in
the evening—stand the multitude of
anglers on her river's actual banks. For
Sommevere-en-France fishes with a un-
animity and application such as I never
saw before. Every one fishes: old wo-
men fish; young women; mothers with
their children; girls; boys; elderly men;
the barber with the strabismus who is
so anxious to learn English ; the tall
man with one leg who manages his
bicycle so cleverly: all fish. After
five o'clock they are as sure to be by
the river as the bronze lady is sure to
be in the centre of the square. But,
most of all, the soldiers fish. Somme-
vere-en-France is packed with soldiers,
and every one has a rod. When work
is done they hold their rods over the
river with a pacific content that for the
moment reduces Guillaumism to a
dream, a myth. But for that dread
menace they would not be there in such
numbers, it is true, yet how can one
fear the worst so long as they angle,
these warriors, with such calm and
intensity ? It is not a sight to hearten
the WAR Lord and send him to the
telegraph-office with a new message of
confidence to his sister of Greece and
a new postscript of affecticn for TINo.
No one, so far as I know, ever catches
anything; but what of that 2 It is
notorious that fishing and catching
fish can be totally opposed pursuits.
Nothing ever discourages or depresses
the Sommevere enthusiasts. They fish
on ; smoke on ; exchange jests and
hopes. The barber, with his white
jacket and his ragged beard, who for
the most part has one eye on his float
and the other on the street whence
would come running the boy who
lathers the customers, may now and
then examine his hook with a gesture
of surprise, but he is not really con- |
cerned to find no fish squirming there.
Similarly, at intel vals, every soldier
withdraws his line to replenish his bait.
or move his float; but they too are not
downhearted. I say float, for it is all
that kind of fishing. No flies, no reels
even; nothing but a rod, a piece of string,
a float, two split shots, a hook, and some
quite superfluous lure. A few more
imaginative minds add a landing-net.
I have sometimes wondered what would
happen if a fish with a sense of fun did
once permit itself to be drawn from the
river. Would they run as from a sea
serpent 2 I imagine them, en masse,
soldiers and civilians, old and young,
stampeding to their cellars in terror.
“A fish ' A fish ' "
Sommevere has two hotels and
several cafés, one of which, by the
canal towpath, where the weary horses
plod, bravely calls itself the “Café de
Navigation.” As for the others, they
are of the regular pattern—“ de Com-
merce,” “de Paris,” and so forth. It
also has many shops, for it is a centre
of an agricultural district, and farmers
and farmers' wives—chiefly farmers'
wives nowadays, for the farmers and
their men are away fighting GUILLAUME
—rely upon it for the necessities of life.
And mention of the shops reminds me
of one of my experiences in Sommevere
which I shall ever cherish, for I too,
finding myself one day also in want
of a necessity of life, entered the chief
ironmonger's and laid my need before
the assistant: a corkscrew. He dis-
played first one and then another, re-
marking that the second was “plus
sérieur.” It was, of course, the more
serious corkscrew that I bought.
“Great sensible land of France,” I said
to myself as I bore away this precious
purchase, “where the words “serious '
and “corkscrew can be so naturally
allied, and soldiers can catch nothing
hour after hour in perfect content-
ment ' " For the rest of my life cork-
screws will fall into the two divisions—
serious and the reverse. :
THE ADVENTURER.
IN Childhood's land of make-believe
I wandered long ago,
Content and keen to plan and weave
A constant shadow-show.
We prowled about like angry bears
Within the fire-guard den,
And stole doll-children unawares
And rescued them again.
We'd blaze each chair-leg forest-tree
To balk an Indian plot,
Or sail into an oil-cloth sea
Upon the sofa-yacht ,
We made our captives walk the plank
Across the nursery tray, -
And wrecked the bath-ship on the bank
Of bricks in Carpet Bay;
But now, where City fetters cramp
My wayward feet, I slave;
Electric is Aladdin's lamp,
The office is the cave. -
Yet here, as in dear nursery days,
I roam adventuring,
And travel through uncharted ways
On Fancy's restless wing.
The marvels of the mystic East
I view in countless bales,
While cunning merchants hourly feast
My ears on fairy tales.
The ledgers tell a wild romance
Of galleons strangely lost,
Of traders that have met mischance
When coral-reefs were crossed.
The wisdom of a thousand climes,
The witchcraft of a few,
The glamour of the “good old times,”
The vigour of the new—
All these combine to weave for me,
Out of the rush and din,
Fair dreams of gallant days to be
And wonderlands to win.

_
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Of the many books that have been already written about
the War and its causes, and of that greater number, at
which the imagination boggles, that will be written in the
future, I doubt whether any will have a greater significance
for the student than J’Accuse (Hodder AND Stoughton).
The peculiar value of it, rightly emphasised by the
publishers, is that this doubly damnatory indictment of
the central Empires is written by one of their own citizens—
one, in short, who, despite what must be increasing tempta-
tions to belong to other nations, remains a German. Further
identification is not given, doubtless for reasons of common
prudence. One can well imagine that there are certain
quarters where no price would be thought excessive to
silence the too candid tongue of this critic. His accusa-
tion, based indisputably upon facts and documents beyond
question, proves the blood-guiltiness of the German and
Austrian criminals with a logic that no impartial mind can
dispute. He shows, from their own actions as given even
in their official reports, that it was the Governments of
Berlin and Vienna which, after long secret preparation,
deliberately unchained the present horror upon the world
at what they regarded as their most propitious moment.
In particular no one can fail to be impressed by the
measures they took to avert what at several moments must
have appeared to them the danger of a pacific solution to
the difficulties they had so sedulously fostered. J’Accuse
is not only an absorbingly interesting volume, but one of
great permanent value; and its anonymous author deserves
the gratitude of all right-thinking men for the high moral
courage that has inspired his work.
One of the small grains of comfort which it is possible to
extract from the War is the fact that it must have acted as
a high explosive, blowing a great deal of nonsense out of
the heads of a particularly irritating class of the community
—the class which, before August, 1914, was wont to gather
together in little coteries and talk Art and admire itself and
behave generally as if it were the centre of an otherwise
uninteresting world. As one of the characters in Mr.
Doug LAs GoLDRING's It's an Ill Wind (GEORGE ALLEN
AND UNwiN) puts it: “There will be a European war in a
fortnight. The importance of the small emotions of neurotic
young men and women will then be dwarfed.” Adrian
Corbet was one of this class till the realities awoke him and
caused him to become a soldier instead of editing The
Monocle, a monthly magazine devoted to Literature and the
Arts, price 2s. 6d. net. War enabled him not only to find
himself spiritually, but to escape from the clutches of
Rose Harford, who was going to marry him, but, as soon
as hostilities began and the price of food started to go up,
elected to play for safety and become the mistress of a rich
man instead of the wife of a poor one. This is, I think,
Mr. GoLDRING's first novel, and it is so well written that I
hope he will stick to fiction as his medium of expression.
None with his gift for characterization should limit himself
to verse and the essay. Even the smallest characters in'
It's an Ill Wind are alive, and there are very few writers

there will be very few persons inclined to find fault with

poetry-loving Bill, the boxing champion. Although a
patrician of patricians, she allowed the boy to sweep her
off her feet and marry her regardless; and it is all so
satisfactory that, some ---
temporary disparities
notwithstanding, one
closes the book with
no fears for the final
welfare of these two
nice people. Really
Conquest (CASSELL) is a
most compelling story,
despite the fact that
the War has inevitably
dwarfed one's interest
(supposing it ever
existed) in such things
as boxing contests and

Her style of writing, too, apart from some occasional
unevenness, is of the pleasantest, and possesses the further
and rare merit that it improves with the occasion. In
short, this is a book my friends shall be told to read.
When you begin a book with the expectation of being
bored to the snoring point and find yourself thoroughly
interested and wideawake, it is well, I think, to admit the
fact. That was the effect that Mr. HAMIL GRANT's Spies
and Secret Service (GRANT RICHARDs) had upon me, and the
reason was that he does not devote himself excessively to
affairs of the moment, but gives up a considerable portion
of his book to what I may call the history of his subject.
The psychology of the spy is a complex business, and I
should imagine that many of us have wondered how men
can be found to take part in what Mr. GRANT says is
“among the most disreputable of all trades.” That recruits
can easily be found for this hazardous service is due, he
states, to a kind of megalomania which induces people at
whatever cost “to be engaged, in no matter how lowly a
capacity, with men who direct important affairs, to associate
in more or less familiar fashion with celebrities.” The spy
is then—in simple terms—a snob. Somehow or other I
had never thought he was so bad as that. Mr. GRANT gives

was not exactly cordial,

And the authoress does
not stop even there, but
proceeds with consider-
able animation to join
Miss Vivia in a series
of rat hunts, otter hunts
and private interviews
with the estate agent,
so that Pauline, who

expect, was much too conscientious not to make the

right in the end. How it does it of course you must
read to discover, but your guesses will be getting very
shrewd some little time before the finish, which indeed
comes desirably soon. The book is not without its dramatic
moments, but is too slight and unreal to count for much
in these days. Frankly, Mrs. MANN spills a good deal too

THE LOWER THIRD.
THE Lower Third is twenty small
boys whose average, as I have just in-
formed forty anxious parents, is 132,
and whose Latin is generally “Fair,
but needs care,” but sometimes simply
“Bad.” Minor characters in the story
are the Headmaster—whom Crockford
describes as P. 1890, if that conveys
anything to you—and I. I am one of
those people whom austere elderly
ladies in trains and 'buses now stare
so coldly at, although I travelled ex-
tensively and not without damage—as
they say of “Our Mr. So-and-So"—in
France and Belgium in the Autumn of
1914; since when the Lower Third has
considered me competent to answer
such palpitating questions as, “You
don't think the War 'll be over before
I'm eighteen, do you, Sir?" and
simply scrums for the honour of doing
odd jobs for me—so I don't mind the
old ladies.
At odd times, when Junior House
matches call greater men away, the
Lower Third plays “The Dregs”: such,
that is, of higher forms as are not
wanted by Houses. These are great
—days, not without their ritual either.
Directly after first school, Bendall mi,
who leads our host, comes up to my
desk.
“Please, Sir," he says—the formu'a
never varies—“we’re playing ‘The
Dregs' this afternoon.”
“Yes, Bendall.”
“Please, Sir, I spose you wouldn't
care to play for us, would you, Sir?”
“I should like to very much, if you
can get somebody to run for me.”
“Oh, please, Sir," this not only from
Bendall but also from ten other young
scamps who have edged up during the
conversation—“oh, please, Sir, I'll run
for you.”
So by second school a large sheet of
paper has been pinned on the form
board, inscribed:—
“NOTICE.
“On the 6th inst.”—“That's to-day,”
as Bendall loftily explains to the less
literate members of the form—“Shen-
stone School, Lower Third Form, will
play ‘The Dregs' on the Shenstone
School Ground. Commencing"—al-
tered when Bendall thinks of it to
“Beginning,” in deference to an absurd
prejudice of mine—“at 2.30 P.M. sharp.
“Shenstone School Lower Third
Form.”
Then a column of ten names, and
always at the end:—
“B. J. BENDALL (Capt.)”
Then after a respectful interval:—
“T. K. F. Merton, Esq., late Lieut.
the W Regiment"—I shall never
live this down if the Lower Third can
help it –“ has kindly consented to
assist the form.”
And then this subtle compliment:-
“‘The Dregs' will be allowed two
extra men.”
But they rarely get them, for, when
we are struggling with the account of
another war in which the Belgae took
a part, there generally comes a little
note: “The Headmaster wishes to
know if the Lower Third minds his
playing for ‘The Dregs' this afternoon.”
The form solemnly answers in the
negative. So we do these things in
style at Shenstone, you see.
The Head, I ought to explain, was a
rowing man and is sometimes to be
seen even now wearing, unbuttoned,
a faded Leander blazer; moreover, he
will come near to ranking as one of the
great Headmasters, but he is no bat.
Yet even such critics as the Lower
Third admire the way he stops hot
ones at cover and takes, without
flinching, fast full-pitches on his
thighs—a not uncommon ball with us.
On this particular 6th ult.—as Ben-
dall would have it — his wife and
daughter came to watch us, a very
special favour for such a humble game
as ours, but rather a “fearful joy,” for,
to tell the honest truth, I am not a
little frightened of the Headmaster's
lady, who is a very grande dame.
Of all dull things, about the dullest
is a detailed account of small cricket:
how Harrison made them go with his
arm, and Smith snicked three fours
in succession, and Reynolds missed a
sitter at point. The bare fact is that
we made 66, Bendall and I hitting up
a merry 25 for the last wicket before I
dragged a laggard foot over the crease,
and was stumped in the excitement of
the moment by Haddon of “The Dregs.”
Poor kid, he nearly wept when he
realised what he'd done, and he
couldn't say anything either, because,
you see, it's a very great secret that
I'm not to be stumped now, and we
never so much as hint at it.
Now I hope you haven't been
bracing yourselves for a dramatic end-
ing—to see, for instance, Thomson,
who has been reported twice and will
be swished next time, bowl the Head
amidst the cheers of his class-mates,
or the small pale-faced new boy save
the game by hitting the bully for six.
As a matter of fact it was rather an anti-
climax, though it had all the makings
of a good finish, too. The Head joined
the last Dreg when their score was
63. Bendall bowled. One day Ben-
dall will be good, and even now he can
be trusted to get the Headmaster's
wicket twice an over; but luckily for
authority his first ball was a bad one,
short, a nice height and just outside
the off-stump—such stuff as dreams
are made of. It is the ball the Head
can play; he cuffed it sharply past cover
into the few yards of longish grass
that fringe the boundary wall and
started to run; it was an easy two.
And here Knox comes into the story.
Knox is blessed with a sense of
humour, and is, I believe, a boy with a
future. He certainly has a past, the
essential point of which just then
concerned a broken window, as yet
unreported. At that moment he was
umpiring at square leg. As the ball
with a final hop settled down just
inside the fringe, he waved his hand to
the scorer, walked gravely to his
wicket, pocketed the bails, and turned
again towards the pavilion. We always
stop when a side has won. The Lower
Third opened its mouth. “I say,” it
began. But such presence of mind as
this should not go unrewarded; besides,
Knox is rather a pal of mine, and I
knew that for once in a way the window
wasn't really his fault. “Oh, good
shot, Head,” I said; “that gives you
the odd, I think.” The Head, who
learned long ago to keep his eyes in
the boat, beamed with genuine and
unsuspecting pleasure.
“Not often I get a four off you,
Bendall,” he said.
A few minutes later, as he was tuck-
ing his pads into his bag, Knox,
chancing to pass by, made casual
mention of a window. It was a neat
piece of work; but he wasn't through
yet. One of the spectators was piqued
at having to watch mere Dregs at play;
besides, § shrewdly suspect that Miss-
in-her-teens had wanted to see a Senior
House Match that day.
“You know, father,” she said inno-
cently, “that last ball wasn't touching
the wall.” She shot a glance at Knox,
so did the Head. “They do bounce
back a bit sometimes, Sir,” said that
warrior blandly.
The very ghost of a smile flickered
on the Head's lips.
“My dear,” he said, “the umpire's
decision is final. Er, you might come
and see me after tea about that window,
Knox.”
But I don't think it was so very bad.
“The directors now recommend that a divi-
dend of 10.2754 per cent., free of tax, be
declared, leaving £1,452 to be carried for-
ward.”—Morning Paper.
It is a nice dividend, but the income-tax
will take some calculating.
“‘To go anywhere and do nothing ' is the
spirit that to-day inspires our British forces.”

been reading the other Times.

THE CIVILIAN.
THE THIRD NIGHT.
THE Territorial soldier shook his
bandaged head sadly as he threw the
evening special away in disgust. I
stopped my promenade in the Park
and sat down beside him on the seat.
“No news this evening,” I said, by
way of starting the conversation.
“Nothing official,” he replied, “and
it's only official news that I care for
now. My head? Oh, that's nearly all
right now, thanks; but it was a bad
scalp wound when I first got it, and I
had a most remarkable escape. It was
not the actual wound but the mental
shock that made the first three days so
dangerous. The first night I had the
most terribly realistic dream. I dreamt
I was the Commander-in-Chief. The
whole night long I was kept frantically
busy, consulting my staff, making out
new plans for the advance next day,
receiving innumerable telegrams and
telephone messages, moving brigades
up on one flank, withdrawing divisions
from the other. Never in my life
before did I realise the immense strain
and responsibility of being a field-
marshal on active service. Next morn-
ing when I awoke, mentally exhausted
from the labours of the night, my tem-
perature had risen to 102 degrees, and
the doctor looked very grave. “You
must get a good night's rest to-night,'
he said. That night I went to sleep,
and again I had a dream of horrible
intensity. I dreamt I was the Admiral
in command of the Grand Fleet. All
night long I was poring over charts
with my staff, receiving wireless reports
from my cruiser squadrons, arranging
the coaling and supply of my many
ships, sending out patrol flotillas and
issuing orders to my submarine squad-
rons. That night I realised the meaning
of the word admiral in war-time.
“Next morning I could barely speak
from exhaustion; my temperature had
risen to 104, and my condition caused
the doctor to look very grave. I ex-
plained the situation to him. “If you
must dream,' he said, “dream more
modestly. Dream that you are some-
one who has neither responsibility nor
danger to face. I warn you that unless
you get a good night's rest to-night
ou will have brain fever and your case
will be hopeless.'
“That night I was given a heavy
sleeping draught, bags of ice were
packed round my head, and I was left
to face what I realised was the crisis
of my life. I tried to imagine a person
who had neither responsibility nor
danger to face in these stirring times.
Believe me, it is a most difficult pro-
blem. I thought of every profession
from a bishop to a burglar, but I found
that the War had complicated the lives
of every one, and to dream of any of
them would be fatal to my repose. At
last in despair I fell asleep.
“Next morning I awoke feeling
greatly refreshed; my temperature was
normal; in fact I was saved --
“What did you dream you were that
night?" I interrupted anxiously.
“A Special Correspondent at the
Front,” said the soldier.
“The Socialist Deputy, Compere Morel,
points out that the party truce was brought
about by force of circumstances, and no
FrFeFnB'chman could refuse to join the union
of national forces in resisting the criminal
aggressor.”—Lincolnshire Echo.

his heart's all right.

MY FRIEND’S CRUTCHES.
No sooner did the train pull up at
the station at noon than I hurried
down to the sea front, feeling certain
of finding the Captain either sitting or
strolling there before lunch. For other-
wise why select this famous health-
resort to recover in 2 But I sought
him and his crutches in vain. Giving
him up, I made for the secluded house
which the energetic little Mrs. Captain
(who could not but look on his mis-
fortune as a blessing since it kept him
longer in England) had discovered for
him; and there, sure enough, he was, in
the tiny back garden, slowly plodding
round and round an infinitesimal lawn.
“And that's all he'll do,” said little
never mind about my grotesque leg.
Let's forget the leg and talk about
cricket. To think that TRUMPER's
dead. I saw it in a paper in Bel-
gium—"Death of Victor TRUMPER –
and it put the sun clean out for a
while. That beautiful style ! Do you
remember him making all the bowling
look like tosh at the Oval that day?”
“Do I remember ? Shall I ever
forget it?”
“And what a name,” he went on
—“Victor TRUMPER Yes, yes, old
thing,” he broke off under a fusillade of
rebukes from my hostess, “I’ll come
back to the point. Well, as soon as I
could get about we came down here,
and on the first day I took my crutches
and hobbled down to the parade.
ing the hand of one who had so suffered
for his country; and then a blazing
old lunatic took his hat off right at me
and said it was an honour to salute
one of England's heroes.”
“So you are,” said little Mrs. Captain
stoutly.
“Oh, do stop talking balderdash!”
said her husband. “I put it to you,”
he added to me, “what could any
ordinary decent man do but get back
here, away from the genuine lot of
wounded as soon as possible, and lie
low 2 ''
“Isn't he absurd — isn't he too
ridiculous?” little Mrs. Captain ex-
claimed. “Fancy carrying a conscience
like that about in a world like this l’’
“I need hardly say,” the Captain
Mrs. Captain in some in-
dignation. “Here we are

than that he may get the % ſº

“I know you're a ridi-

retorted, “and you ought

“Well,” she began.
“No,” said the Captain,

Volunteer. “I say, You Boys, I can't FIND THE BATTLE I'M sup-
| posed to BE IN. Do You THINK I MIGHT join yours?”
continued, “that I came
in for some pointed do-
mestic criticism, and under
its influence — and it's
fairly potent, you know,”
he remarked in paren-
thesis, throwing his wife
a kiss—“under its influ-
ence I consented to go out
again, but only on con-
dition that I might put
myself right with the
public.”
“Do listen to this,” said
Mrs. Captain—“the dear
old snob l’’
“Not at all,” said her
husband. “It isn't snob-
bish to wish not to deceive.
Anyway, snobbish or not
—and we shall never agree
about this—I had to be
straight with myself, so
I prepared a placard to
the effect that my broken
She'll put me !
in a false light, this hateful woman.”
After a brief skirmish little Mrs.
Captain gave way.
“To begin with,” said her husband,
“you will admit that my position is
about as foolish as any man's can be.
To be in the trenches for four months
without a scratch, and then, the day
after reaching home on leave, to break
one's leg fooling about with a pack
of children—you'll agree that absurdity
couldn't go much farther than that.
Undignified, too. It's like being run
over by a donkey-cart—as A. J. WEBBE
said when SHERWIN took off the wicket-
keeping gloves and bowled him with a
lob. My hat!” he sighed in paren-
thesis, “to think that once upon a
time cricket used to be played 1"
“The back garden is still waiting
for the explanation,” the practical little
Mrs. Captain broke in. “Never mind
about cricket.”
“Hear her,” groaned the warrior.
“‘Never mind about cricket'ſ Rather,
That's what we’d come for, and I
never had a second thought about it.
But this place, as perhaps you have
noticed, is full of wounded men—really
wounded men, decently injured by
bullets and shrapnel and the other
honourable apparatus of war—and
before I realised the situation, there I
was all among them—I, the only fraud
there.”
“Fraud!” I interjected. “What
rubbish you talk! After four months
in the trenches, too.”
“That's nothing,” he said. “The
trenches are not the point. The point
is that I was on crutches from a leg
broken in the silliest possible way at
home, and these fellows were on crutches
with legs properly crocked up at the
Front. I tell you the realisation gave
me a shock. Talk about wolves in
sheep's clothing: I was the very limit.
I was quickly made to feel it, for before
I could get out of it up comes an old
lady to insist on the privilege of shak-
leg had nothing to do with the War,
and hung it on one of my crutches
where everyone could read; and would
you believe it?” he went on bitterly,
“within a few minutes I was bom-
barded by a new set of old gentlemen
and old ladies who wished to shake the
hand of so candid a man. “Such a
brave teller of the truth,’ they said. So
there you are. And now you under-
stand why I prefer our back garden to
all the waves of the English Channel.
Here, at any rate, I am not a fraud,
nor am I offered compliments on being
merely commonly honest."

sense?” little Mrs. Captain inquired,
as she slipped her arm into his. “Bless

THE TOO COMPLEAT ANGLER.
“WE will take Bruce,” said Wilhel-
mina yesterday afternoon. Bruce is
our retriever. At least he began by
being a retriever and tried to change
into a spaniel afterwards, but it was
too late. He loves mud, water and
sofa-cushions in the order named.
“Faithful and willing” the advertise-
ment said when we bought him, so of
course, as Wilhelmina insisted, he had
to come, though George kept on saying
it was very risky.
I love dogs myself; there is some-
thing so spontaneous about them: but
we know now that it is better not to
take them out fishing on the lake.
When we were all in the boat,
Wilhelmina announced that she was
going to fish with a small submarine
barbed all over with horrible hooks;
she said the trout in the lake always
mistook it for a minnow at first.
“And afterwards?” I asked.
“There never is any afterwards for
them, poor things; you can always
land them — even the biggest. It's
such a tempting bait. Just look at it
now, twirling in the air . . .”
Bruce snapped vigorously.
The sky suddenly fell upwards and
I found myself on my back staring up
at the heavens. Bruce planted his
feet on my chest and scrabbled with
his hind legs. Wilhelmina asked with
a calm detachment if anybody had got
a pair of scissors. George said he
had a presentiment all along.
At that moment Adolphus put his
head out of the water to see what the
trouble was about. Adolphus is our
tame pike; he lived in the time of
OLIVER CROMwFLL to begin with, and
he simply hates anything indecorous.
When he saw us he frowned severely.
Bruce tried to bark, but failed in the
upward swing of the jaw, and closed
his mouth very hurriedly.
“You had better row home,” I said,
“I can see the clouds very well from
here, and it looks like rain; and don't
let Bruce bleed over my waistcoat like
that. Do get him off my chest.”
“How horrid you are to mind a
little blood,” said Wilhelmina; “haven’t
you any sympathy for a poor dumb
animal?” -
“Poor what animal?”
“Poor dumb animal was what I said.
You'd grumble if you had two fish-
hooks in your nose, and got your
tongue caught in a third in trying to
lick them off.”
“Well, of course I shouldn't try to
lick them off. What an idea And,
anyhow, it's entirely the dog's own
fault; he should have looked down his
nose before licking.”
By this time George had found a
knife and cut the minnow off after
a severe struggle; the hooks, however,
still remained, and Bruce was not so
grateful as he might have been. When
we got ashore the suffering creature
was led into the garage and anaesthetics
were administered; but this is not a
medical treatise.
Bruce wagged his tail when I went
fishing this morning, but it was no
good and I went out alone. After
lunch I am going out with a revolver
to stalk Adolphus. Would you believe
it, that reprobate old pike spent all
last night warning the trout about our
submarine, and I never got a bite the
whole morning?

MEALS AND THE MAN.
(A correspondent of a contemporary de-
clares that our moods of depression
and optimism in regard to the War
vary according to the quality of our
meals.)
WHEN you would save the casual sov.,
Though hard the task should prove
and harder, -
Believe me, ’twere not wise, my love,
To squeeze it from the local larder;
Not that I make you this appeal
Through a desire to put more flesh
On ;
No, but I find a tasty meal
Restrains a leaning towards depres-
sion.
You must yourself be well aware
That when you dish me up a diet
Composed of all the coarsest fare,
I suffer from a sore disquiet;
Whereas when you lay out a spread
Which might appease the nicest
“party,” -
I mount on wings of hope instead,
An optimist pronounced and hearty.
Since, then, 'tis up to each and all,
Even when things look none too rosy,
Bravely to face whate'er befall
And see a future safe and cosy;
When your expectant spouse you feed
Entirely to his satisfaction,
'Tis patent you perform indeed
A highly patriotic action.
But when the clash of war is hushed
And WILHELM mourns his bloody
malice; -
When he and all his Huns are crushed
And Peace re-occupies her palace;
At ease for ever and a day,
Dear mistress of my home, why then
"Oll
With my most willing sanction may
Resume my ordinary menu.
“M. OR N.”
THE trouble began at breakfast yes-
terday.
“I've almost decided on Myfanwy,”
Millicent remarked, without preface.
“Heavens,” I said, “what is it 2
junction on the Cambrian Railway ?”
“No, it isn't,” said Millicent. “It's
the name I've practically chosen for
baby—and a very pretty one, too.”
“All change for Criccieth,” I said.
“Pass the marmalade, please.”
“Don’t you like ‘Myfanwy’?” Milli-
cent asked. “I think it's so uncom-
mon.”
“So,” I said, “is Iphigenia or
Sophonisba or Beetroota. Can't you
think of something better?”
A
“Well, I thought,” said Millicent,
“of Ælfreda first, but someone suggested,
Myfanwy and I was awfully taken with
it. Still I'm not sure, after all, that I
don't prefer Ælfreda. Yes,” she added,
after a few moments' reflection, “it
shall be AElfreda.”
“Oh, any old thing you like,” I said,
“I don't see that it makes much differ-
ence to me. I shall probably call her
‘Billy' anyway.” -
The fact is I am fond of homely
names for general use. Our elder
daughter, whose Christian names are
Diana Vansittart—the latter a family
name—is invariably called 'Jim,' while
Ralph Hugo Wansittart, our only son,
has been known as ‘Thomas' from
birth.
“‘Wilhelmina,’” said Millicent,
“would be the most appropriate name
for her if you insist on calling her
: Billy.’” -
“Much too Prussian,” I said. “And
now I think of it, Ælfreda's Saxon,
which is nearly as bad.”
“Then it's simply got to be Myſan-
wy.”
“ Che sara, sara,” I said.
“No, thank you,” said Millicent.
“No Bible names. You must make up
your mind to Myfanwy unless you can
think of some other name even more
beautiful. I've given myself several
headaches over this job already.”
“Well,” said Millicent as we met at
tea, “has anything struck you?”
“Not even a ‘Black Maria." By
the way,” I said, “there's a name for
you. Short—and appropriate to the
martial times we live in.”
“Very horrid,” said Millicent.
“I felt you'd say that. But it's all
right. I've decided on—what do you
think 2''
“How on earth should I know?”
said Millicent.
“Myfanwy,” I said.
pretty and all that.”
“Why, that 's the very name I sug-
gested at breakfast,” she said indig-
nantly. - -
“By Jove! so it is,” I said, “Well,
all the better. You see, the fact is we
had a good many callers at the office
to-day, and among them a very pretty
girl, who came to consult us about a
will. When she sent her card in I
said ‘Fureka.’”
“I thought you said “Myfanwy,’”
said Millicent. - -
“I said that too. I read it off the
card, ‘Myſanwy Blake'ſ She's coming
again for a further consultation on
Wednesday.”
Millicent sniffed. “You're making
it up,” she said sternly.
“I’m not,” I said. “Here's her
card. I brought it so that you could
see how nice Myfanwy really looks
“Uncommon,
when you see it in black and white.
And now of course the name will
always have a charming association
for me.”

The lion in strength and the lizard in speed,
The watchful in waiting, the present in need,
The great Super-Dreadnoughts gigantic and grim,
The thirty-knot cruisers both subtle and slim,
The weight and the range of each wonderful gun—

In wild nights of Winter, when warmly you sleep,
She is plugging her way through the dark and the deep,
With death in the billows which endless do roll,
And the wind blowing cold with the kiss of the Pole,
While seas slopping over both frequent and green
Call forth on occasion expressions of spleen.
Of all the old kettles award we the bun
To the out-of-date cruiser, the obsolete cruiser,
The creaky old cruiser whose work's never done,
Built some time before Nineteen-hundred-and-one.
And when the Day breaks for whose smoke-trail afar
We scan the grey waters by sunlight and star,
The day of great glory—the splendour, the gloom,
The lightning, the thunder, the judgment, the doom,
The breaking of navies, the shaking of kings,
When the Angel of Battle makes night with his wings . . .
Oh, somewhere, be sure, in the thick o' the fun
You will find an old cruiser, a gallant old cruiser,
A creaky old cruiser whose day is not done,
Built some time before Nineteen-hundred-and-one.

If ever I'm asked to mention the bravest possible act,
Or the most sublime example of cautiousness and tact;
I haven't the least compunction, the slightest mental
qualm
In answering the question or distributing the palm.
The man of the most discretion that ever I chanced to meet
Was neither a sleek attaché nor a magnate of Lombard
Street;
He was merely a country brewer, who went for a tour to
Rome,
With a party who gained an audience from the Pope in his
stately home.
The Holy FATHER was gracious, and greeted him with a
smile; -
“He asked me several questions in French, but my French
is vile,
So I never attempted to answer, for I honestly declare
I couldn't be sure if his title was Saint or Sacré Pére.”
And the man who, in my opinion, as the bravest stands
revealed
Has never been decorated for valour in the field;
He was simply a clerk in the City, whose humble weekly
Screw
Amounted, and still amounts, to the total of two pounds
two.
Yet, unarmed and single-handed, with a nerve no shock
could scare,
He called on the only QUARItch, in his formidable lair,
And asked the chief assistant, a terrible man to attack,
Had he got a second-hand copy of Whitaker's Almanack.

[A kind of a Fable with a sort of a

I HAD only one German to look after.
No, it is not true that I disliked him.
He was the most musical of the lot.
A great eater, of course, perhaps the
most voracious of them all; I don't
know how many meals a day he wanted.
But still the beggar could sing, and he
paid for everything in notes, in a
manner of speaking.
Gave himself airs ? Well, no, not at
first, in that sense of the word. Yet
when he puffed out his chest and looked
at you pityingly with those small eyes
of his, you could see that a spiked
helmet was all he needed.
Possibly, but NoFTHCLIFFE fit mon

I had no trouble with him till that
paper was put at the bottom of his
cage. He didn't seem the same bird
after that. He would puff out his chest
and look at me with those beady eyes,
and his chirp seemed to say, “Pig of a
Britisher, not even North CLIFFE can
save you from me!”

If we abolish Saturday and Sunday

steal two days' march on the Germans

vital—unless, of course, they attempt
reprisals by cutting out, say, Tuesday

is an old soldier. He must have bought
it to put at the bottom of the birds'

THE SUPREME SACRIFICE.
THE General commanding the British
Expeditionary Force crossed one brown
leg over the other and leaned back
against the wiry grass in luxurious
abandon. It had n a thoroughly
satisfactory morning. Nine times had
the German lines of entrenchment been
carried at the point of the bayonet and
the inevitable counter attack repulsed
with prodigious slaughter. Finally,
vanquished in Homeric single combat,
the opposing General had surrendered
unconditionally, disdaining with a chiv-
alry worthy of a better cause to plead
the handicap he had suffered through
acting as stretcher-bearer and field
hospital to his victor when the latter,
in the heat of conflict, had incautiously
placed a bare foot on the First Black
Watch, a battalion which the uniniti-
ated might excusably have mistaken
for the disused shell of a particularly
corpulent limpet.
Outwardly, it must be confessed, the
General failed to conform to the popular
standard of the illustrated press. In
the matter of sex she could only quote
the somewhat rusty precedent of JoAN
of ARC, and her height, some three-
feet-six, would scarcely have satisfied
the least exigent of military require-
ments. The webbed bathing drawers,
too, which encased her nether limbs
and what she was pleased to term her
petties, gave her at the moment some-
thing of the appearance of a recumbent
peg-top. .
For a time she let her thoughts
wander in lazy contentment over the
prospects of the midday meal, watching
with half-closed eyes the August sun
blazing upon the ripples of the bay and
on the opposing headland where the
gorse ran in golden riot to the water's
edge. Presently the sight of the sand-
castle, which had served in turn for
every important fortress from Liége to
Berlin, fast crumbling before the incom-
ing tide recalled her to the all-engross-
ing topic.
“Will it be long before the Germans
are really truly beaten, Daddy?”
Her late foe stirred stiffly.
“I'm afraid so, dear.”
“Is that because you can't go and
fight them again 2"
It was scarcely a question; the thing
was self-evident. Her world of men
was divided with satisfying simplicity:
the lean brown six feet of humanity
against which she propped her bare
feet; and the rest. Of course there
were sub-divisions. For instance, she
had a penchant for the senior service
and an entire absence of maidenly
reserve in declaring it. -
But her words had started in the
Darkie (to lady after a wordy war). “Is

man's mind a train of thought that
was far from happy. Almost bitterly
he reviewed the events of the past year.
A promising career abandoned; months
of strenuous training, months spent
apart from the child whom he had
never left before for a single day; and
then, before he had even caught the
longed-for sight of the enemy, an un-
lucky shell and a shattered knee;
weary months in hospital, and lastly
the parting words of the kindly grey-
haired surgeon:—
“I'm afraid you'll have to take it
very easy. . . . Golf, I daresay. Ten-
nis? Well, some day perhaps.”
It all seemed so useless.
Presently instinct warned her that
all was not well. Cautiously she
moved so as to get a better view of his
face. No, she was right; something
was the matter. The cause was beyond
her, but clearly it was a case for
womanly comfort. Suddenly he felt
her arms about his neck.
“Daddy,” she whispered, “to-
morrow I'll be Germans, an' the next
day, an’”—breathlessly, lest her
resolution should fail—“an' every day.
You shall never be beaten again.”

THE WATCH DOGS.
xxWI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, We do not
spend all our days in the trenches. I
cannot tell you exactly where we do
spend them, but some days find us
artfully concealed not far away ready to
dash forward and add to the confusion
in any emergency. Near this spot is a
little pool amongst the trees surrounded
by rushes. The other night, about the
hour of last post, a disturbance was
created in the trenches and we had the
alarm. In less time than it takes to
tell all were alert and standing to ;
dispositions were made, extra ammuni-
tion and emergency rations were issued,
cigarette-cases had been filled and com-
panies were ready to move off. And
so we waited, prepared for anything
and everything, all agog, until the
sounds died down and it became clear
that the matter in hand was some
private affair of the people on duty in
the trenches. In dismissing my little
lot I thought fit to have the roll called;
our old friend, the sanitary man, was
missing. Excitement at once became
intense again; the sanitary man, with
or without his apparatus, is usually so
particularly present. Had he gone
forth alone to tackle the enemy single-
handed, as he tackles the flies, with his
cresol and his chloride of lime? We
called him, we whistled him, we
searched for him high and low, but all
in vain. We were just giving up hope
and beginning to speak kindly of him
as of a thing of the past when I
thought fit to search the pool. And
there, among the rushes, he was—
fishing.
I have been informed of two import-
ant events, outside our unit but in the
area. The first concerns three das-
tardly privates who were caught red-
handed at the prohibited gambling.
The whole lot, cards and all, were
apprehended and placed in the custody
of the guard-room, pending their ap-
pearance at orderly-room next morning.
It transpired, but not during the pro-
ceedings, that in the interval between
arrest and trial they compensated
themselves and, so to speak, consoli-
dated their position by teaching the
guard their method of play and mulct-
ing every member of it of every penny
he possessed. The other incident con-
cerns the artillery. Nobody who has
been in the trenches will contradict me
when I say that our field batteries,
whatever other faults they may have,
do love being really busy. Give them
a job and they will concentrate their
whole selves on it, thinking of nothing
else by night or day. I shall not be
giving anything away if I say that
this is a spot at which many of the
smaller batteries, each having its pri-
vate beat, converge. Opposite, behind
the enemy lines, a tall chimney-stack
had too long remained intact. “It is
an observation post,” said the Field
Batteries assembled in secret conclave;
“it is a menace. To-morrow morning
shortly after dawn we shall remove it.”
The hour was fixed, the very second
was agreed upon. At the scheduled
moment every gun in every battery
was to be laid upon it and, at the send-
ing up of a signal, battery fire was to
be opened, continuing till the chimney
discontinued. You may imagine what
sleepless nights were spent, with what
a concentrated fever of expectation and
anticipation all concerned fixed their
glasses on the target at dawn and
waited . . . .
Meanwhile one of those large and
imperturbable monsters known as
“Mother" had arrived by night, un-
beknownst, some miles in the rear. As
soon as it was light she looked about
her for some convenient object on which
to try her strength, any old target suit-
able for a preliminary canter with a
singleton shell. And on the horizon
she saw a chimney stack which, she
thought, would do as well as anything
else.
I hope, Charles, that you have mixed
with field gunners, so that you may
realize the true inwardness of the final
tableau. I don't suppose there was a
single man, from the Chaplain to the
Officers' mess cook, who was not
standing there waiting for that sig-
nal and the to-do which should follow
it. The affair was so beautifully timed
that the signal actually did go up, just
about three-fifths of a second after the
chimney had come down. . . . I con-
fess that, on hearing the story, I
instinctively gave all my sympathies
to the German infantry in the trenches
thereabouts.
In our own trenches we have a
listening post so close to the enemy
that all conversation in it is conducted
in a whisper. The Brigadier, with his
retinue, inspected it the other day.
“I've 'eard summut,” whispered the
listener with a grave air. A smile of
pride in the efficiency of his men spread
over the Company Commander's face;
the C.O. prepared himself to accept,
with becoming modesty, any praise
that was going; the Brigade Major
produced his Field Service Pocket
Book; the Adjutant sharpened his
pencil and the Brigadier officially de-
manded the details. “Indeed, Sir,”
whispered the listener, “I 'eard sum-
mut as it might be bacon frizzlin' over
a brazier.”
I have not told you much of that
element, too prominent, alas! in our
daily life, the stretcher; but one very
vivid case I think I may mention. A
soldier, I take it, is none the less a
hero simply because he has a touch of
the actor about him, and Private X is
no less a man because he has always,
apparently, looked forward to the
moment when the stage should be his
and himself in the centre of it. As we
were proceeding from the trenches to
the rear, in a small party for a tem-
porary purpose, his opportunity came
in the shape of a spent bullet. The hit
was anything but serious, yet was such
as to compel him to assume any posi-
tion but the sitting one; but, even
lying on his face at the bottom of the
trench, he did justice to the scene and
wouldn't have it spoilt by the well-
meant efforts of a comrade who saw
herein the chance of practising ban-
dage work. “’Ere, kid,” said Casualty,
abandoning his semi-unconsciousness
for the purpose, “stand clear and leave
it to the stretcher-bearers.” The latter,
arriving, played up well and the affair
concluded with an effective curtain.
As the stretcher party moved off,
“Good-bye, chaps,” said Casualty, “and
cheer-ohl” and from his pocket he
produced, with an obvious effort, a
jaded cigarette and lit it. I'll warrant
that very cigarette had stood by in that
very pocket from the beginning of
things and for this very purpose.
It is the sequel, told me by the S.B.
Corporal, which makes me take this
view. The bearers had endeavoured to
humour Casualty with the promise of
a quick recovery, but Casualty had
made it quite plain to them that he
didn't want humouring and wasn't
going to recover, and the party were
proceeding in a pathetic silence when
those confounded German gunners
must needs intervene and spoil every-
thing. Stretcher-bearers are used to
being harassed in their work by oc-
casional shrapnel falling round and
about, but to Casualty it was a new
and unwelcome thing to lie inert in
the open in such circumstances. A
chance shell bursting nearer than the
others, he gave all his theatrical am-
bitions the go-by, leapt in a flash from
the stretcher and legged it, just about
as fast as humanity can move, back to
the trenches, where, after some small
local treatment, he continues at duty
to this day.
I write to you from the trenches,
Charles, where life rolls on as usual
and consists almost entirely of large
shells and little flies. We get into the
habit of not asking for much, but it
would be something if only some of
the big shells would kill some of the
little flies. Yours ever, HENRY.

how drill-people perform. Imagine
my pain and surprise when I had been
listening for some moments to discover
that the persons in charge did not show

THE EXCEPTION.
HE was no doubt the happiest
member of the household, although his
immunity from the common burthen of
care and anxiety threatened, perhaps,
to cause a little estrangement. Hitherto
he had seemed so essentially one of
ourselves that it jarred to see him
living his life precisely as he had done
since he arrived in a basket (a little
woolly black toy of a dog in those
days) three years ago.
He stood apart from the rest, inas-
much as his creature comforts had
known no curtailment. Not only is
he still allowed the same quantity of
biscuits and bones as in the piping
times of peace, but, more enviable than
all, his appetite remains as excellent
as ever. Nor is he one of those who
cannot sleep o' nights, and when he
takes his walks abroad he is never
accosted by patriotic ladies with an
absorbing desire to know why he is
not wearing a coat of another colour;
he is not required to dwell deprecat-
ingly on his age, his infirmities or the
nature of his daily occupation.
The arrival of the less frequent post-
man, or even of the telegraph boy with
his more aggressive rat-tat-tat, causes
no more than the customary, quite
pleasurable, if noisy, excitement, though
it may be that he marvels sometimes
to see us stand round while the letter
with the French postmark is opened
with a shaky hand and read aloud in
an equally shaky voice. He is blissfully
ignorant of the existence of such things
as trenches, firing-lines, shrapnel, high

It is true that disappointment still
lies in wait for him at one hour of
the twenty-four. Even after all these
bare months have passed, as 7 o'clock
draws near, he will make his way
hopefully to the hall and lie down
with his muzzle as close as possible to
the mat, his ears pricked as he listens
for the well-remembered footsteps which
tread the earth Somewhere in France.
Presently he will rise with a yawn,
shake himself and trot slowly away
with his tail between his legs, clamber-
ing on to a chair by the open window,
looking out eagerly to the right, in
which direction lies the railway station.
And his mistress will lean forward with
a sigh to stroke his head before she
bends a little lower over the sock she
is knitting.
But with this exception he certainly
seemed to be less in sympathy than
usual with us all. One evening, how-
ever, he was barking so furiously that
the wildest hopes were awakened.
Could it be possible that the dreamed-
of visit had materialised at last 2 But
there was no peaked cap or khaki cape
on the hatstand, no boyish voice, no
odour of cigarettes, but within the
room a little golden-haired girl was
kneeling on the hearthrug holding up
a portrait of the KAISER, and a foot
away lay the dog, barking at it as he
had never barked before.
It was obvious that he had become
one of us again. The community of
the household was restored.

OUR ALLY.
(Being notes from the diary of a com-
batant in the Fly Campaign.)
6.30 A.M.–Hostilities have begun. My
nose has just been invaded—not
by a battalion, but by a single spy.
Having been caught napping, was
unfortunately unarmed; but suc-
ceeded in driving off enemy with
my bare hands. He has retired
to window-pane.
7 A.M.–Enemy showing signs of great
activity. He has left window and
is air-skirmishing. Though invi-
sible, I can distinctly hear the
hum of his motor.
7.15 A.M.–Enemy has presumably en-
trenched himself. No sign of the
offensive being renewed at the
moment.
7.30 A.M.–Left ear violently attacked
from rear, but enemy again retired
in great disorder on my commenc-
ing a turning movement.
7.45 A.M.–Observe much activity in
enemy's camp. Taking up strong
position upon shaving - mirror.
Consider time is ripe to make my
advance. Shall mobilise.
7.50 A.M.–Enemy still occupying shav-
ing-mirror. Think he has dug
himself in. Shall attack him on
the flank, and enfilade him with a
high-velocity towel.
7.51 A.M.–Regret to have to report
attack failed. Enemy escaped
through loop in fringe of towel.
Casualties, one shaving-mirror.
7.55 A.M.–Shortage of food apparent in
enemy's lines. Is eating curtain.
Shall seize opportunity to have
bath.
8.5 A.M.–Enemy still occupying cur-
tain. Have decided to bombard
him with heavy artillery, for which
purpose am bringing up 22-inch
pillow.
8.6 A.M. – Unaccountably misjudged
trajectory, but caused enemy to
evacuate position and retire to
window-pane again. Casualties,
one electric-lamp shade (slightly
chipped). Am following up attack
with vigour and a handkerchief.
Hope with co-operation of latter
to bring off enveloping movement.
8.10 A.M.–Enveloping movement only
partially successful. Succeeded in
approaching within easy range,
but unfortunately sneezed at cru-
cial moment. Suspect enemy of
employing snuff against me.
8.15 A.M.–Territory free of enemy.
Searching scrutiny of every avail-
able ambush failed to reveal any
trace of him. Shall complete
equipment and proceed at once
to the new Front — if I can
find it.
8.30 A.M.–Enemy once more located
occupying heights on wall of break-
fast room. Position practically
unassailable without pea-shooter,
but am wondering whether could
manage to strike effective blow
with Daily Express.
8.32 A.M.–No, I can't. Losses heavy;
one Tanagra figure (mortally
wounded), one vase cut flowers
(not expected to live), one eight-
day clock (totally disabled).
8.40 A.M. – Temporary cessation of
hostilities. Enemy's whereabouts
unknown. Don't care. Am hungry.
8.41 A.M.–Found him in milk - jug.
Had decided to build pontoon and
attack him in mid-stream, when
he managed to scramble out, and
again disappeared.
8.42 A.M.–Enemy located in marmalade
entanglement. Hope to announce
decisive victory when have found
sugar-tongs.
8.45 A.M.–Enemy succeeded in eluding
capture by feigning submission.
Had him in the hollow of my hand
(literally) and was about to intern
him in slop-basin when he flew
away in the most cowardly and
unsportsmanlike manner possible.
Is at present on window-pane
buzzing an epinikion and cleaning
his arms and legs. Shall renew
attack by strategy when have
finished examining contents of
two shells (dead, and both hard-
boiled as usual).
8.55 A.M.–-Have just sent despatch-
rider for glazier, but am happy to
be able to record engagement ended
in my favour. Enemy escaped
through hole in pane, but reckoned
without a valuable ally that made
his presence known in the nick of
time, and secured the fugitive while
in full flight. Shall certainly
submit his name to headquarters
for suitable recognition.
9.3 A.M.–Thinking the matter over,
have decided for the future to
abandon ordinary methods of
campaign, and enlist further
allies. What I want to know
is, do the Stores keep a reserve of
spiders ?

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Diary of a French Army Chaplain, by ABBE FELIX
KLEIN, translated by M. HARRIET M. CAPEs (MELRose), is
in its simplicity, its vividness and its directness one of the
most remarkable books that the War has so far produced.
The writer is evidently a man of strong character and
admirable human sympathy, and his account of what he
saw and did as Chaplain of the American Hospital at
Neuilly-sur-Seine is of the most poignant interest. I can
vouch for one reader, at any rate, who, having taken it up,
could not lay it down until he had read the last word
on the last page. To Neuilly came day by day the torn
and shattered bodies of those who had once been brave and
vigorous fighters. It was the Abbé's duty to speak to
them words of hope and consolation, to strengthen their
souls and to enable them—alas! in how many cases—to face
in resignation the great change that was to sweep them
from the ranks of the living. Frenchmen, Englishmen,
Arabs, Moroccans, nearly all the nationalities, in fact, that
make up the armies of the Allies, were brought to this
hospital, and to all of them the good Abbé ministered
with a single-hearted devotion which is as much beyond
praise as it was far removed from obtrusion. His presence
and his words must have been like sunshine to these poor
wrecks of humanity. He is a keen patriot, but his charity
knows no limits of race or creed, and he is careful to set

down any facts showing kindness on the part of the
Germans. “In this letting loose of horror and hatred,”
he says, “we must dwell on the few features capable of
softening hearts.” He finds the gaiety of the English
remarkable. He speaks of “three Englishmen singing
merrily to the applause of a Tunisian and four Frenchmen,”
and adds that “knitting is not taken to enough yet ; up to
now there are not more than twenty who go in for it,
almost all English. Quite contrary to the idea the French
had of them before seeing them close, the English are
remarkable for their animation. Perhaps because of the
ills we endure nearer at hand we can hardly, as is natural,
go further than resignation and deliberate courage; but
they go as far as gaiety"—and the Abbé gives instance
upon instance to prove his statement. . Altogether this is

well-educated man of business, after some years of blame-
less boredom with a wife and family at Wimbledon, is
suddenly thrown, by the accident of a lonely cure at Aix,
into the society of a woman, a dancer, at once considerably
more fascinating and less respectable than the ladies of his
previous experience. . The result is a “guilty passion,” and
an intrigue which circumstances later conspire to renew.
This is when Gerard's wife and children have been estab-
lished for the summer at a distant villa, and he himself
is thus enabled to alternate between their society and that
of Illona. That is the whole matter. As I say, on the
face of it the thing should be repellent. That it is not is
due, I suppose, to the humanity with which Mr. GRANT
RICHARDs has managed to invest the only two characters
that matter. This gives the book a fascination that, in my
own case, made it impossible to put down till the last page

readers. I ought to add that
the translation is skilfully done

original.
In the eleven stories that |
make up Pastorals of Dorset

It is not easy to describe the
qualities that combine to make
these tales peculiarly attractive,
but I can say without reserva-
tion that Mrs. BLUNDELL is
supreme among novelists of the
present day in her sympathetic
understanding of the lives of
humble country-folk. Humour
is another of her gifts, but she
does not use it to make her
characters ridiculous; one laughs
very often with them but hardly
ever at them. Here, for instance,

[AUGUST 25, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN AFFAIR OF OUTPOSTS.
[As the following military incident is based
upon recent facts, the author has thought well
to anticipate the intervention of the Press
Bureau and censor it himself.]
THE summer dusk was deepening into
night. It had been a day of deluge, and
from the lower ground by Wood
rose a white and sinister vapour. An
awful silence held the lines, broken only
by the furtive rustling of paper-bags that
had held the sandwiches and bananas
which were to hearten us for the coming
battle.
Our main army, according to the best
reports, lay a mile or so in our rear, and
we were its outposts. For the last hour
of daylight I had been arranging the
dispositions of the company under my
temporary command, conformably with
those of B company on my right. The
three platoons that furnished our pickets
had thrown forward their sentry-groups
with doubled sentries into the hedge
which the enemy had given an under-
taking to attack. Precisely at
o'clock, the hour fixed for the com-
mencement of operations, I took up a
recumbent position with the supports
in a disused bunker of the links,
and gave a final adjustment to my
brassard.
During the strained pause that fol-
lowed, some of the lighter spirits among
us took advantage of our position in
the rear, out of earshot of the enemy,
to indulge from time to time in the
reckless badinage proper to a licentious
soldiery; but, for myself, being in civil
life a professional humourist, I spent
the interval in reviewing the errors of
my past and regretting that I had
never made a will.
Suddenly my attention was called to
an approaching apparition. Our sentry
growled a low challenge and out of the
gloom emerged a single enemy under
escort. At first, for his eyes were
bandaged with a white handkerchief, I
took him for a flag of truce come to
say that, owing to the saturated condi-
tion of the terrain, the enemy had
decided to postpone the battle. But as
he wore no other sign of white (save
the pallor of his face) I began to sus-
pect a ruse, though the fact that he
was in the full uniform of the enemy
militated against the theory of es-
pionage. Rising, I advanced in his
direction with the idea of inviting him
to show reason why he should not be
shot out of hand. (I could not have
postponed the execution till dawn as
the necessary firing party would then
be working off their night's labour in
bed.) As I came closer I suffered a
painful shock on recognising in him an
old friend of my comparative youth—
a Regius Professor of University.
“What do you here, Septimus, and
in this guise?” I demanded sternly.
He quailed perceptibly, but recovered
himself and replied with an affectation
of bravado.
“I’ve only come as a spectator,” he
said.
I saw at once that the situation was
unusual. I could recall no precedent
for it in the King's Regulations or other
standard works on military etiquette.
I was almost certain that permission
for attachés and war-correspondents to
attend operations in the field is in-
variably required beforehand, and that
there existed a strong prejudice against
extending this privilege to representa-
tives of the enemy.
“Your position, Septimus,” I said,
“is extremely irregular. Remove your
bandage that I may look into your
eyes.” And I drew closer.
He gave a rather sickly smile and
withdrew the handkerchief, but kept
his lids lowered.
“I only came,” he repeated, “as a
spectator. I am taking no part in
these operations.”
I was not satisfied, but, after all, I
said to myself, he is my friend and a
Regius Professor of University.
“If,” I told him, “you will give me
your parole not to attempt to escape
and give information to the enemy
about our dispositions, you may lie on
half my mackintosh in this bunker.”
He accepted with an indifferent grace
and settled down for the night. I
offered him my last unripe apple, but he
thought he would see better without it.
There, then, we lay—such strange
bedfellows as adversity is apt to bring
together. And indeed we both seemed
to wear the badge of a common grief,
for the darkness had turned the pillar-
box scarlet of our brassards into
mourning sable. . . . All of a sudden
a dreadful thought occurred to me. Till
now it had escaped me that my pris-
oner, besides being a Regius Professor,
was a notorious writer of light verse.
I had mixed a good deal in my time
with writers of light verse and was well
acquainted with the crafty cunning of
their methods. Now, it would be my
duty presently to visit my pickets and
sentry-groups. Would it be wise, I
asked myself, to go off and leave a
writer of light verse under the guard
of innocent men—barristers, solicitors,
and so forth—who were probably un-
familiar with the habits of this elusive
type? On the other hand, if I took
him with me on my rounds, I could
not guarantee his safety, for the
Reserve Corps, when on outpost duty,
is known to be very prompt, and, even
if he escaped the worst, his Muse
might be permanently disfigured.
“Septimus,” I said, “on second
thoughts I will relieve myself of further
responsibility in respect to your person.
I will hand you over to the Com-
mander of the outpost company. He
stands yonder with the telephone sec-
tion in the hedge to our right rear.
I will do you the courtesy to conduct
you thither myself. Be good enough
to rise. About—turn | Left in-cline !
Quick—march 1” -
On the way I treated his conversa-
tional advances (made in light prose)
with some reserve, merely expressing
my regret that I was unable to dine
with him at College on the
following day. Arrived at the Com-
mandant's post, “I have the honour,
Sir,” I said, “to deliver to you the ac-
companying prisoner, who has been
captured by my sentries. I am dis-
satisfied with the account of himself
which he has given me.”
My Commandant, who has too large
a heart to believe ill of any man and
has never in his life written a line of
verse, light or heavy, received the suspect
with great geniality. I ought perhaps
to have notified to him the ground of my
suspicions; but, rightly or wrongly, I
decided that the matter was no longer
my affair, and I returned to my post.
::: ::: ::: :k :::
The “Cease-fire” had rung out on
our left flank. For a long time it was
ignored on the right of B Company,
where the battle proceeded with great
fury. At last, the “Assembly" being
sounded, the Reserve Corps ex-
tricated itself from the –– Volunteers
(whose dead had continued to fight
with the extreme of valour), and the
two forces, including all casualties, re-
formed at a safe distance from one
another.
After the pow-wow was over I got a
word with my Commandant.
“What did you do with my prisoner,
Sir 2 " I asked.
“Let him go, of course. I had to take
his word that he was just a spectator.
You see, he's a gentleman and Com-
mandant of their regiment.”
“He may be all that, Sir,” I replied,
“but he writes light verse. A man
who does that sort of thing is capable
de tout.” O. S.

JOAN.
(A Study of the Rising Generation.)
THough I'm older than her father
There are times, I own,
When I find it really rather
Hard to fathom Joan :
Not that she pursues malicious
Aims by methods surreptitious,
But resembles the capricious
Cat that Walked Alone.
Joan appreciates hilarious
Comrades, girls or men,
But her mood is non-gregarious
Ev'ry now and then;
And it's just when most endearing,
Most inspiriting and cheering,
That she's giv'n to disappearing
In her private den.
Joan, though studying modern
fashions,
Modern books and plays,
Can exist on simple rations,
Live laborious days;
Rising with the lark and turning
All her energies to churning
And contemptuously spurning
Soft luxurious ways.
Joan delights in dogs and horses,
Owns a mighty Dane,
Whom, once launched on devious
courses,
Nothing can restrain;
“Esau" very fine and large is,
But when down the road he barges
Nursemaids and their trembling
charges -
Wish he had a chain.
Once to sate her thirst for dancing
Joan would travel far,
In the two-step gaily prancing,
Quite the tango star;
Now of motoring craft a master,
Always driving faster, faster,
Day by day she courts disaster
In her racing car.
Fogies find her too new-fangled;
Sentimentalists
Liken her to sweet bells jangled,
Moonlight in the mists;
Those who read herheart most clearly,
Though she treats them cavalierly,
Like her all the more sincerely
For her kinks and twists.
They admit that she is “spiky,”
But at length divine
Stirrings of a nobler psyche
Neath the porcupine:
For the War has made her serious,
Cured her of her moods imperious,
Self-absorbed, detached, mysterious,
Brought her into line.

THE HEAD OF THE FIRM.
Mr. Swansdown's confidence in his
knowledge of charladies was very
much shaken when Mrs. Bloggins
tendered one week's notice of her in-
tention to leave him for ever, and he
wisely deputed the choice of her
successor to his typist, Miss Myrtle.
Miss Myrtle was a nice girl with soft
hair and the kind of eyes which make
a man decide to be better in future.
In the perusal of this distressing story
her niceness should be borne in mind.
Thus it came about that one May
morning Miss Myrtle held her court at
ten-thirty by the clock. Thither came,
in reply to an advertisement, six sad
but virtuous females willing to fill the
shoes of Mrs. Bloggins. They were
not a prepossessing lot, but then the
innate goodness of their kind is of the
heart. With one accord they sat very
upright, stiffened by their respect-
ability.
The office-boy, a cheerful and lovable
youth with a devastating squint, under-
took to usher the applicants one after
the other into the presence of Miss
Myrtle. He opened the door, thrust his
head in, and squinting at the assembled
ladies asked for the first comer.
“Which of yer got 'ere first 2" was
what he actually said. He spoke
affably as was his wont.
A lady near the door with a red bon-
net perched jauntily on a portion of
her head answered this invitation and,

preceded by the office boy, passed with
silent dignity into the inner room where
Miss Myrtle sat in state. The typist's
nose was a little red that morning, and
as the applicant entered she saw her
put her powder puff away, and thereby
summed her up.
“Be seated!” said Miss Myrtle in
the tone she had heard her previous
employer (an editor) use to authors.
The charlady coughed in protest
before she did so, and then sat, obedient
to the custom of her caste, with back
as straight as a ramrod, knees close
together and hands tightly clasped on
her lap.
“What is your name?” asked Miss
Myrtle, taking up her pen in a firm and
businesslike way.
“Missus Jones,” the applicant said
dignation, they decided that the place
did not suit them. Why a typist must
not engage a charlady is beyond me,
but it is so. If you doubt it ask your
charlady. -
At last there was but one left, a thin
vinegary lady in black, whose face sug-
gested that she had spent her life in
a desert place apart. Gradually Miss
Myrtle's new-found dignity was evapo-
rating and the hilarity of the remainder
of Mr. Swansdown's staff (the office-boy,
to be exact) increased. The typist de-
termined to alter her methods with the
one remaining applicant, for she was
frightened lest she should fail to obtain
a charlady at all. Her dignity went
altogether and she was just a jolly
little typist again.
gave me this the other day;” and
she held out the bangle on her wrist.
The charlady looked at it with critical
interest, because, in spite of all evidence
to the contrary, charladies are not only
human but feminine. Miss Myrtle
thought her new method was much
more successful.
“I should like to do most of the
cleaning at night after he had gone
home,” suggested the applicant. “What
time does he go?”
“Nearly always about five,” Miss
Myrtle replied. “You could commence
cleaning by half-past every evening if
you wished.”
“But sometimes he's later surely.
It might be very awkward if I came to
clean up and found him still here.”
“Oh no l He's always away by five.

word which denoted
her married state. She
clearly resented some-

“And where were you
last employed, Mrs.
Jones?” asked Miss
Myrtle, unconscious of
the existence of this re-
sentment.
“Hi was employed
in a sliziter's horfice,”
said Mrs. Jones shortly.
“May I arst in return
if I am dealing with a
principal?”
“Oh, no,” said Miss
Myrtle; “I am Mr.

tial secretary.”
“Ho!” said Mrs. Jones

There was a silence

Miss Myrtle.

the charlady replied
quietly, but with a slight
smile which temporarily
thawed her face.

“Naturally; I’m his

unpleasant ring in her ears and her
back perceptibly stiffened.
At this juncture the office-boy tit-
tered.
“Leave us,” said the mystified Miss
Myrtle, and with a dreadful grin he
withdrew.
“I don't think this place will suit
me,” said Mrs. Jones. “Being a re-
spectable married woman,” she added.
Without another word she left the
room and the amazed Miss Myrtle was
alone. As the dignified charlady shook
the dust of Swansdown and Co. from
off her elastic-sided boots she met
another lady entering, who took her
place among the remaining applicants.
One after another the charladies
were ushered into the presence of Miss
Myrtle by the joyous office-boy, and
one after another they discovered, pos-
sibly by instinct, that she was the
typist; whereupon, bristling with in-
“I’m glad the others did not suit. Mr.
Swansdown asked me to choose the
most genteel of those who applied, and
I hope you will take the job on.”
There was silence for a moment.
“That depends on the job, you
know,” said the candidate in an accent
vaguely reminiscent of the suburbs.
“Oh, there are just the ordinary
duties, you know—keeping the office
clean and so on.” -
“And the wages?” asked the dere-
lict. -
“Ten shillings.”
“That is satisfactory—quite satis-

the way in which she added “quite
satisfactory” that she was a superior
person.
“But what about the boss?” asked
the prospective charlady.

clinch the matter, “he's an old dear;

began.
“Pardon me. You assumed I was

not disillusionise you. You might tell
Mr. Swansdown that I am here,
please.”
And slowly and thoughtfully Miss
Myrtle did so.
It is not quite certain what happened
at the ensuing interview between
husband and wife, because there is
only one keyhole to the office-door and
the office-boy was using that. His
reports are very vague. One thing is
certain; it was Mrs. Swansdown who
chose the new typist.

AT THE FRONT.
THERE is a deservedly popular mili-
tary song which states, with perhaps
unnecessary iteration, that the singers
are there because they're there, because
they're there, because they're there.
That is exactly how we find ourselves
placed at the moment. Here is a dusty
lane with eligible greensward adjacent.
We have been here since 9 A.M. and it
is now 6 P.M. We have long since given
up discussing why we should be here,
where we are going when we leave here,
and, indeed, whether we are ever going
to leave here.
Last night all was peace, except that
I was told to sleep in my boots. I
can only assume that they must inad-
vertently have slipped off; for when
the morning broke I appeared to be
devoid of foot-fittings of any kind.
While I was thinking over this mystery
the Company fell in. Fortunately they
were very sleepy and by the time my
platoon-sergeant had persuaded them
to form something other than threes
and fives, I was on the spot explaining
small but important technicalities, such
as the advisability of taking ammuni-
tion when you're going to a battle,
and the difficulty of getting a really
satisfactory drink out of an empty
water-bottle.
Eventually we set out and walked
along some roads till we came to this
one, where no doubt the following
conversation took place:–
C.O. Have you the least idea where
we are going to, or why?
Adj. No, Sir.
C.O. Do you see any possible point
in our going any further?
Adj. No, Sir.
C.O. Then don’t let's.
Adj. Wery good, Sir. . I will make
it my business to see that the process
is discontinued.
So we all sat down by the roadside
and took off our equipment and almost
everything else and went to sleep in
the sun. . . .
It is now considerably later—two
days later, in fact. We still inhabit the
dusty lane and eligible greensward. A
fear has gone abroad that it has been
assigned to us as a billet. This is all
very fine in its way, but when you
have received a message reading (more
or less): “Attack on in ten minutes'
time; bring a sandbag and a bayonet,”
and you then find you have to live an
indefinite time with a sandbag for fur-
niture and bedding, and a bayonet to
shave and brush your teeth with, you
come to realise that the greenwood
tree business isn't half what it's
cracked up to be. Besides, when you
have found your place on the map—if

you have one—and inspected your rifles
and sandbags and bayonets, there really
isn't much to do here unless you have
a geometrical turn of mind and care for
plotting the angles between the butter-
cups. If you are a keen soldier you
can of course go on inspecting your
platoon's rifles and sandbags and bay-
onets, because, by the time you have
criticized the last bayonet, going round
conscientiously, there's no knowing
what may have happened to the first
rifle or sandbag. This will keep the
men interested too, and save them from
getting into mischief, surrounded as
they are by all manner of temptations.
Before we ceased speculating on our
prospects, our strategists advanced all
possible views. The best supported
theory was that we were being held in
reserve to create a diversion through
Switzerland which was to come in on
the spur of the moment. The most
obvious and horrible prospect—that of
remaining here till the end of the War
—no one has dared to put forward.
Yet ours cannot be a totally inglori-
ous oblivion. Before we settled here
we won fame. A very large if slightly
bleary photograph, representing two
of our sections on the march, had
been published in a certain notorious
daily journal which is fully prepared
to finish the War in a month if it
only gets the chance. It is true that
the legend subjoined was “Belgian

pect glory and accuracy for a half-
penny, can you?

[AUGUST 25, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FAMOUS VICTORY.
WHEN is an historic ship not an
historic ship? That is the question.
The answer is but I will explain.
Having been to Portsmouth I know
not how many times, but always in the
wrong company for investigation, I
found myself there once again last
week, with a keen though youthful—
perhaps keen because youthful, for the
old take so much for granted—student
of England's past and England's heroes,
whose very obvious desire to fall in
with the blandishments of an ancient
mariner and visit the Victory in his
venerable boat was not to be thwarted;
and so for the first time, after judicious
bargaining, I was rowed to that notable
vessel.
I will not dwell upon the incidents of
the voyage in a craſt which was called
for some odd reason the Why Not ; how
we were bobbed up and down by the wash
of this steamer and that, but managed
to retain our lunch; how the Gosport
Floating-bridge's efforts to run the
Why Not down were frustrated by
her chains; how the ancient mariner,
although he had us at his mercy,
refrained from marooning us until his
original exorbitant figure was conceded.
Let me merely record the fact that in
due course we reached the great little
Admiral's Trafalgar flagship, and by
ascending the steps that were not there
in his time, and obeying a notice to
take care of one's head that also had
come in since his day, obtained our
first insight into the accretions which
have accumulated like barnacles on this
most illustrious of ships.
An elderly man having been sum-
moned to take us in hand, we began the
tour of enlightenment—and disillusion.
Mounting to the main deck he drew our
attention to a brass plate raised an
inch or so above it, close to the head of
the companion. “This,” he said, “is
where NELsoN fell. But of course,” he
added—and the “ of course " sent a
chill down my back—“it was not on
this deck. This deck is new.” New
Who had braved the rollers and combers
of Portsmouth Harbour to see new
decks 2
He then drew our attention to the
wheel; but it was not, he said, the
wheel used in NELsoN's day. Oh, no.
A shot destroyed that; but a new wheel
had been set up in the same place, and
in the centre was the famous signal.
Similarly, he said, the masts having
been shot away, the present masts not
only were not the original ones, but
were made of iron, whereas NELsoN's
masts were of wood; and again we
sought comfort and consolation in each
other's eyes.
Right aft, he said, was Captain
HARDY's cabin; but it was not a cabin
any more; just the receptacle of two
boats, one of which bore NELSON's body
from Greenwich to London. It is a
beautiful boat, but it is repainted every
year. Descending, we were shown the
exterior of NELsoN's cabin, but, “as it is |
now used for court-martials and we
never know when a court-martial is to
be held, it is kept locked.” Here was
a rebuff indeed. It was the one spot I
longed to be in, and to look through the
windows at its stern, and see how the
ocean appeared to the greatest fighting
sailor of all time, and the least able of
all the heroes of the sea to control mal
de mer. But no. Nor are the windows
as they were in NELSON's day, for then
they were of transparent horn, and now
they are of glass. All this was very
disappointing, and my spirits fell still
lower when I read the date 1846 or
1847 on one of the guns; but at last
we found one, the firing of which NEL-
soN might have controlled, and were in
the midst of our first authentic flush
when the guide led us to the cockpit
where the dying NELSoN surely enough
was carried, but which has since had
its compartments removed to facilitate
its show purposes. But was that
really the true table cn which all the
surgical operations had to be performed,
and was that really the lantern by
whose dim light the surgeon had to
work? The aged man would not swear
to either.
But any superiority that I may have
felt over the old fellow disappeared
when, before one of the engravings of
the Battle of the Baltic, in the little
museum, he related the glorious inci-
dent of the spy-glass and the blind eye.
“Now I dare say,” he began with
charming naïveté, “that you won't
believe what I'm going to tell you, and
I'm sure it will make you split your
sides with laughing when you hearit. At
the Battle of the Baltic, you must know,
NELsoN was only second in command.
Well, at a certain critical moment in
the fight he had his attention drawn to
a signal ordering him to retire. And
what did NELsoN do? You know he
was blind by one eye? Well, he put
the telescope to his blind eye and said
he couldn't see it, and then went on
and won the battle.”
Some of the saddest moments of life
are those in which a simple humorist is
deprived of his reward of laughter. I
did what I could to supply the desired
mirth, but made so poor a show that
the guide, who clearly is accustomed to
less sophisticated audiences, looking at
me narrowly and in pain, accused me
of having read history and therefore of
having heard it before. -
“If NELSON hadn't won,” he added,
with a return of good spirits, “he'd
have been disgraced for ever and
drummed out of the Service. That's
an odd thought, isn't it?”
“Nothing succeeds like success,” I
remarked pleasantly.
But I had better have held my tongue,
or been less observant, for humiliation
was instant. “Funny you should have
said that,” he replied. “Nine out of
every ten ladies and gentlemen that
comes aboard this ship says that, but
somehow I thought you wouldn't.”
..What could I do after that ? There
was nothing to do but pay up and go.
A PERMISSIBLE EXTRAVACANGE.
DEAR Goddess at whose shrine I fall,
And worship that sweet will
Which holds my heart in gentlest
thrall
With all a woman's skill,
Heed not, I pray, the cry to-day
That luxury's a vice,
For you, I swear, shall never share
The nation's sacrifice. -
But you shall walk in silk attire
And dreamy satin hues;
Your feet that fairies might desire
Shall wear the costliest shoes;
And you shall eat the choicest meat
Upon a dainty dish—
Shall dress and feed as well, indeed,
As any girl could wish.
Sooner, in fine, my soul I'd pinch
Than see you poorly gowned,
Or stunt your stature half-an-inch
Or weight by half-a-pound;
Yes, though for thrift I'll prove my gift
It shall not come nigh you,
But you shall be our luxury,
My tiny maid of two.

PHASES OF A YEAR OF WAR.
(From a Patriot's Note-Book.)
AUGUST, 1914.—War declared. Rather
startling. Imagine that it will be a
tremendous business, involving great
changes even in my obscure life. Am,
however, at once agreeably surprised
by the reassuring battle-cry, “Business
as Usual.” The War is to be won,
apparently, by our taking no notice of
it, thus causing an immense feeling of
depression among the enemy. Suppose
that in the circumstances we may as
well spend our annual fortnight at
Ostend as usual? Ask Chapwing, my
neighbour, if he cares to join us.
Chapwing declines. Seems to be a
poltroon.
October.—Second battle-cry: “Do
. bit.” Enemy not having been
rought to his knees by sublime spec-
tacle of national composure, it has
become necessary to try something
different. Eager to accommodate, but
how 2 Much too old for active service,
and then there is the matter of my left
eye. Happily, it is pointed out that those
who cannot enlist can at least enable
others to do so by giving up all ex-
penditure that encourages superfluous
labour. At once dismiss occasional
gardener and countermand orders for
winter overcoat and bagatelle set. Stop
library subscription. Also reduce wife's
housekeeping allowance and dock child-
ren's pocket-money, amidst great de-
monstration of domestic patriotism.

ible for military service. Now appears
that in order to provide every kind of
work during unavoidable dislocation,
and thereby materially help to win
War, it is my plain duty to spend not
only all I can but even more. Order
two of everything and double house-
keeping allowance and children's
pocket-money. Indescribable scene of
domestic patriotism. Chapwing, at-
tracted by the outburst, wants to know
if we have all gone mad. Hun

fulness in spite of my disadvantages

ton Fencibles. Somewhat short of loose
cash just now, but spend £20 or so on
entrance fee and subscription, uniform,
rifle, marching boots and so forth, and
support of concerts and bazaars in aid
of the corps. Have to work rather
closely at professional duties in order
to retrench my position, but manage to
put in eighteen hours a week of drill
and marches, manual and other exer-
cises. Confident of doing the right
thing this time, but admittedly taken
aback by the continuous spectacle of
stalwart young men in civilian attire,

MARE THE Most of IT, I SAY. WHO KNows? WE MAY BE
over, or have I dreamt the War? It
appears that a hitherto obscure gentle-
man living in Shepherd's Bush claims
to have raised coincidence to its highest
power. Nation holds its breath. War
still going on apparently, however, for
I discover from a column reserved for
matter of secondary interest that 1,150
British casualties recently occurred
during the taking of a single trench in
Flanders. Deeds of heroism and other
details crowded out.
MAY.—“Join the Industrial Reserve.”
It is officially explained at last that
there are plenty of men available, but
nothing like enough material with
which to win the War. Letters in the
Press suggest that the Volunteers would
find better employment for the super-
fluous time with which they seem to
be burdened if they devoted themselves
to work in the factories rather than to
playing at soldiers in the parks. Some-
what of a facer, but better to know the
truth in time. Get taken on by the
Willoughby Spare Parts Company, at
6d. an hour. As they only want full-
timers felt it incumbent on me to give
up my profession and income during
the War.
This having involved a
removal into a tenement dwelling, see
nothing of Chapwing nowadays.
JUNE.—Great War Loan floated.
Chapwing unexpectedly drops in to
ask me what I am going to do about
it. Declares emphatically that, as the
War is to be won by money, it is the
part cf every loyal man to throw in
his uttermost farthing—especially as
it is a full 4} per cent. and gilt-edged
security. He himself is applying for
£300, made up of £200 which he
happens to have lying idle at the bank
on deposit at 2 per cent., and £100
which Mrs. Chapwing and the children
have hitherto been lending to the Gov-
ernment at 2% per cent. through the
medium of the Post Office Savings
Bank. Very distant when he hears
that I propose doing nothing. As a
matter of fact, although I did not care
to mention it, I happen unfortunately
to be rather heavily in debt just now.
AUGUST.—At last ! The Loyal and
Patriotic Order of Semi-skilled Workers
having declared that they alone are
competent to do unskilled work, Wil-
loughbys reluctantly discharge me to
avert threatened strike. Decide that
I have now done about enough for
my country and had better look after

MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-‘A fortnight
in the Himalayas for three pounds”
sounds like a more than ordinarily
catchy advertisement of a touring com-
pany. Nevertheless, thanks to cheap
railway “concession" tickets, it has
been the experience of some of the
Territorials in India during the last
few months. You will rejoice to learn
that, by the exercise of a desperate and
prolonged economy, I contrived to join
a party of eight from our battalion
who made the excursion. The painful
memories of that period of self-denial
(consider, if you can, the plight of a
hungry and thirsty soldier saying “No”
to the cake wallah and the pop wallah
day after day to the point of exhaus-
tion) have been more than effaced by
blissful recollections of the ensuing
fortnight's furlough in a well-known
hill station.
There were unforeseen results of this
sudden transference of eight rather
washed-out and emaciated Terriers
from the dull routine of existence in a
stifling fort on the blistering and dust-
swept plains to the delights of a health-
resort seven thousand feet in the air.
The drop in temperature, for example,

gave us all violent colds in the head.
The revolution in diet produced the
most lamentable internal disturbances.
And, most striking of all, the unaccus-
tomed proximity of numbers of white
girls promoted an unparalleled outburst
of amorous emotion among several of
our party.
The worst case was that of Private
Milo. I will not weary you with a
catalogue of his philanderings, but if
you will believe me he returned to the
Plains (none too soon) engaged to no
fewer than seventeen attractive and
It seemed an
impossible position. We could see no
conceivable way out for him.
But nature has her own method of
solving these problems. The strain of
writing seventeen affectionate letters a
day in this climate proved too much
for him, and he is now in hospital.
Before entering he left instructions
that all letters from the betrayed ones
should be returned unopened, marked
in the top left-hand corner in red ink,
“Deceased,” which, after all, he ex-
plained, is only another way of spelling
“diseased,” which in turn is only
another way of saying “ill.”
Well, much may be forgiven a man
suddenly translated into such society
after an ascetic existence of eight
months on the high seas and in military
cantonments.
The return to the Plains and the
unending miseries of prickly heat was
a sad business. The mere change from
a maximum shade temperature of 70
degrees to one of 119 induced a pro-
found depression of spirit. And we
have grave doubts with regard to that
official maximum of 119. According
to our own calculations there must be
an error of at least 100 degrees. I put
it to you that when an entrenching tool
exposed to the rays of the sun for three
minutes becomes hot enough to fry
eggs on with ease, it is absurd to talk
of a shade maximum of 119 degrees.
Every man you meet here has heard of
another man who has done this egg
trick.
We have now more or less settled
down again to the dreary monotony of
Fort life, for ever making ready for
something which never happens. Of
course it is necessary to be prepared
for emergencies, but this constant train-
ing for hypothetical situations is very
wearisome. Sometimes, it is true, it
leads to strange results. One of the
strangest was related to me by an
N.C.O. of the Regulars a few days ago.
A movable column had been organ-
ised in his battalion and frequent

parades were held. A very fine state
of efficiency was attained, and at the
given order the column would be ready
in an almost inconceivably short time
to move off, equipped to the last detail.
Only it never moved.
Included in the supplies carried by
the movable column was a fresh meat
ration consisting of two live sheep.
They were intelligent sheep, and after
a few practices they learned to leave
their grazing on their own initiative,
and spontaneously take up their proper
positions in the column. Soon this
procedure came to be taken as a matter
of course, and the fresh meat ration
was trusted implicitly to do its duty.

recently requested to leave a Theatre on the
ground that he was wearing an “unauthorised

WE are favoured with an advance
copy of the following notice to the
Piptown Battalion of the Humpshire
National Defence Force :—
PRIVATE AND CoNFIDENTIAL.
It is rumoured that the Military
Authorities are organising a raid, which
may take the form of a house-to-
house search for incriminating evidence
against persons suspected of connec-
tion with Home Defence Organisations.
Uniforms and accoutrements should be

was missing. Great was the
consternation, for this was
the first lapse in the splendid
efficiency of the column.
Search was made, and the
errant animal was discovered
peacefully feeding in its
accustomed haunts. Then
occurred a remarkable inci-
dent, which I should hesitate
to believe if it had not been
related to me by an old
soldier.
Anticipating censure, the
delinquent, who, it seems,
had been observant enough
to acquire a knowledge of
army language as well as of
army routine, turned to its
pursuers and said wearily,

happens. It's a farce,
that's what I call it !”
As I have said, our life here is a
deadly dull affair, and the smallest
humorous incident comes as a welcome
break in the monotony. We are sin-
cerely grateful to our Detachment
Quartermaster-Sergeant for an adven-
ture which befell him a few days ago.
He was taking a solitary ramble outside
the Fort in the early morning and
wished to cross a certain bridge, at the
head of which was mounted a native
guard. The sentry, however, refused
to allow him to pass; but, knowing no
English, could not explain his action
in words, till, after a dubious search,
he pointed earnestly to one of a large
number of prohibitory notices affixed
to the wall. It read: “Elephants and
traction engines are not allowed to cross
this bridge.”
There is no doubt that the hearts of
very few of the Territorials now garri-
soning India are in their work, though
penny custard at the Soldiers' Home.”
In future there will doubtless be sub-
stituted some princely offer, such as
“Come and have a mutton pie and a

A DEAD SECRET.
LAST Thursday morning I met the
latest subaltern looking more like a
Major-General than usual.
“Hallo!” I exclaimed, “what are
you up to?”
“Just had my hair cut,” he replied;
“come and have some lunch. Aunt
Sims and Joan are staying with us
and Jimmy Battersby is turning up.”
On the way conversation was inter-
mittent; Archibald had something on
his mind.
“It's the barber,” I said to myself;
“too much off the matting.”
Suddenly, on his very doorstep,
Archibald unburdened himself.
“I say,” he jerked out, “we’re
going out—next week, I think.”
I shook his hand and gave him my
blessing.
“Of course,” he added with sig-
nificant inflection, “this is a deadly
secret, so don't breathe a word to
anybody.”
I placed a hand upon the centre of
my knitted waistcoat and promised
upon my honour as a ratepayer.
But it wasn't so easy as all that.
I sat next to Joan at lunch. After
the preliminaries were over I remarked
casually, “I wonder what Archibald
will ' and stopped suddenly and
began to find something in my soup.
“Aha!” I exclaimed in an undertone,
“there he is—a peppercorn.”
“Yes,” said Joan expectantly, “what
were you going to say about Archie?”
“Oh yes!” I smiled bravely; “how
stupid of me! It's his hair. He's
had it cut, you know.”
Joan gave me a diffident glance and
continued her soup, and I pulled myself
together and chased a piece of carrot.
I turned to Archie's mother. Anyhow
she would know all about it, so there
would be absolutely no temptation to
say anything.
We talked very nicely about (1) cook-
ing, (2) steam-laundries, (3) the price
of coal, until I remarked reflectively
and d propos of nothing, “Yes, it's hard
luck on you—very.”
“How do you mean?” she asked.
And there I was again.
“Well,” I explained, “I don't mean
the cooking and it isn't exactly the
price of coal. It must be the steam-
laundries. Yes, of course, that's it.
It's the steam-laundries.”
“Oh I "exclaimed Archie's mother—
just “Oh 1” So I escaped again; but
not for long. Jimmy Battersby had
me in difficulties with the pineapple
jelly, and I just saved myself from
Aunt Sims by dropping the salted
almonds on the floor—a last effort of
a rapidly degenerating intelligence.

For just about this time I began to
realise that I was beaten. I simply
couldn't stand it any longer. I would
fill my glass, rise gracefully, and,
bowing to Archibald, say, “Permit me
to take wine with you and wish you
well as I understand you are going to
the Front next week.”
Ipictured the sensation and wondered
vaguely whether the subsequent court-
martial would shoot me like a gen-
tleman or hang me as a journalist.
Then Archie's mother rose and lunch
came to an end.
In the ensuing movement I side-
slipped into the bow-window to look
at the view, and whispered very
quietly to an acacia, “Archie is going
to the Front next week.”
I said it twice. It did me a lot of
good.
On the way to the library I hung
behind and had a little conversation
with the dumb waiter—perfectly safe.
Then there was Venus of the Medici
(in marble) discreetly concealed in a
corner of the hall. I confided in her.
The worst was over. I entered the
library full of confidence in my powers
of secrecy.
Everybody was collected round the
latest subaltern. There was a perfect
buzz of conversation, and above it I
heard the voice of Archibald:—
“Next week, I think; but don't
breathe a word to anyone. It's a
deadly secret.”

[AUGUST 25, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TONSORIAL FINANCE.
YESTERDAY morning I overslept my-
self, a thing I very rarely do uninten-
tionally. I was much annoyed, as I
had an important appointment in the
City at mid-day; and a glance at my
watch showed me that I had barely
twenty minutes in which to make my
toilet and reach the station. Breakfast
was entirely out of the question, and
most likely out of the breakfast room,
too.
I calculated that—even forgoing my
bath—I had not sufficient time to
shave, wash and dress, but that I had
just time enough to wash and dress, or
shave and dress, or wash and shave.
The last combination, though undoubt-
edly the most hygienic of the three,
would not have been thoroughly under-
stood in my neighbourhood, and conse-
quently I had to reject it in favour of
one of the others. The middle one
seemed to offer alluring possibilities so
far as the shave implied a partial
washing of my face, but unfortunately
it required concentration. The first,
therefore, appeared to be the most
reasonable course to pursue; indeed,
when I again looked at my watch I
found that I had been so long deciding
that there was no practicable alterna-
tive available.
I eventually caught the guard's van
just as it was disappearing through the
exit. A close scrutiny of the guard's
features revealed the fact that he too
was unshaven. In fact he could not
have used a razor for at least fifteen
years, for his beard practically ended
where his whistle began. He was
otherwise an intelligent fellow, and re-
peated the names of the stations quite
prettily.
On arrival at the terminus I found
that I had a quarter-of-an-hour to
spare, so I determined to sample a
hitherto unexplored luxury. I would
have a professional shave. Close to
the station I saw the sign of a barber,
who professed to perform the operation
for threepence; so I entered, and a
brigand of doubtful nationality at once
took my hat away from me. Another
invited me into a chair and recited the
bill of fare from memory.
“Shave,” I said briefly, and the
commenced.
“Ever shave yourself, Sir?” asked
the man as he paused to put more
desiccated soap on the brush.
Now, I thought to myself, this is
where he is trying to have me. If I
say “Yes” he'll want me to buy a
patent non-skid razor or a safety
shaving-brush. If I say “No” he'll
try to sell me a ticket for the estab-
lishment's Toilet Club. So then and
revels
there I engaged a purely hypothetical
valet.

He controlled his emotion so well
that I increased the bonus to twopence.

ment entirely,” I interposed. “I never
interfere with my servants—not now.
I remember how annoyed my cook once
was when I brought home an automatic
rolling-pin.”
Then the barber began to relather
me, and while my mouth was still
incapable of self-defence he did his
utmost to sell me, successively, a bottle
of hair-wash, a face-lotion, a sanitary
hair-brush and a shampoo-powder.
“Look here,” I said at length, “I
have an important appointment in
exactly five minutes. Will it facilitate
matters if I buy something?”
The man assured me that it would
do all that and make him happy for
the whole day besides.
“Then,” said I, “you may sell me
a half-crown bottle of moustache-
pomade.”
“Certainly, Sir," he said, mollified;
i but I thought you shaved the upper
ip?”
“It's not for myself,” I explained,
“it 's for a friend who has never ex-
perienced the boon of a shave by an
expert. To be exact he 's a railway-
guard endowed by nature with luxuriant
vegetation. Shall we get on ?”
We got on.
“Brush your hair, Sir 2"
I surveyed it.
“Since you've rumpled it,” I replied,
“I think it is the least you can do.”
He proceeded to do the least he
could do. -
“Pay at the desk, please. Next gen-
tleman Take three shillings, Miss.”
“Er—two-and-nine, surely 2” I de-
murred, lifting my eyebrows a notch
higher.
“Hair-brush, threepence,” was his
answer.
The lady, an adept at high finance,
successfully negotiated the two half-
crowns I gave her. Then I turned
and handed my man a penny and a
bright smile. He said nothing to either.
There flashed across my mind the
thought that, like a waiter, he only
expected ten per cent. of the threepence.
(The hair-brushing he had himself in-
curred, and of course he received com-
mission on the sale of the pomade;
therefore he was only entitled to expect
a tip for actual work done on my
behalf.) I concluded that he was in
doubt as to whether I expected seven
centimes change.
“That's for you—to keep,” I said.
|
This was unexpected. -
“I never told you to iron my hat,” I
burst out. “You never asked me if
you might. I consider it a great im-
pertinence for anyone—I don't care
who it is—to play fast and loose with
my hat without permission. I will
overlook it this time, but * *
As he was no longer listening I con-
sidered it futile to go on. I gave the
lady at the desk the additional four-
pence and was making my way to the
door when a third assistant rushed at
me with a brush and swept me all over.
When he had finished he was panting
with satisfaction.
“Well ?” I said.
“Yessir.”
“Don’t you call out ‘Take fourpence,
please, Miss, like that other man 2".
“Oh, no, Sir. I do the brushing
quite on my own.”
“Tell me,” I continued, “what you
expect for the unnecessary and unsoli-
cited brushing of an entirely new suit
of clothes?” - -
Under pressure he admitted that
most gents gave him twopence. So
I gave him what he suggested and
mentally calculated that he earned, on
the average, a penny a minute, or, in
an eight hours' day, a matter of two
pounds. In other words, some £600
a year.
Then, as nobody else seemed to want
anything, I walked out.
I was late for my appointment, and
my friend, I was informed, had waited
a quarter-of-an-hour and then gone off.
The consequence was that I had to
play dominoes with an almost entire
stranger.
When I arrived home in the after-
noon I made out the following account:

“WELL,” said Francesca, “we’re at the seaside again.”
“Francesca,” I said, “your remark is not merely pro-
foundly original, but it's absolutely true. We left our
happy home, we took tickets, we entered a railway carriage,
we lunched out of a basket on sandwiches and hard-boiled
eggs 1 -
“Did you want them soft-boiled 2" she asked.
“How you put me off,” I said. “You can't deny my
statements, so you try to confuse me with flippant inter-
ruptions. But I will not be confused. I insist on saying
that we lunched on sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs.”
“It's always done," she said, “by those who go to the

“You forget,” I said, “the bottle of milk. I'm not

“Then I'll tell you one,” I said. “I’m not a bit afraid

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MRs. HENRY DUDENEY is one of the few women writers
to-day who possess what could be called the large manner.
Her new book, The Secret Son (METHUEN), is a good
example of this—a homely tale of rustic happenings
touched with a real sense of tragedy. A Sussex down-
land farm is the scene of it, and something of this country
of wide spaces seems to have got into the treatment, so
that while the story is for the most part unhappy it is
never morbid. It must be confessed that some antiseptic
influence of the kind is needed. Of the four women who
make any considerable appearance in the action, one is
half-witted, and the other three have all, as the melodramas
say, taken the wrong turning. Which seems “above the
average that statistics have laid down for our guidance”;
at least, one would prefer to think so. The virtue of the
book lies partly in the character of Nancy and in the
handling of her love for Morris, who was the son, not of
her proper husband, but of the consumptive squire,
Chinnery. Then, when in his turn Morris falls in love,
the woman whom he is about to marry has to make to him
a confession of the same flaw; and Nancy, who has never
dared tell the truth of his own origin to the son whom she
adores, must look on and see him suffer. Nor is this all;
in yet a third generation the same misery comes, till, as
Morris says to his mother, it all threatens to “happen over
again like a giddy go round.” Mrs. DUDENEY's picture of
country life is not exactly a pretty one; but she deserves
the more credit for having brought out the beauty and
humanity of it, as well as the horror. There is plenty of
the last in the scene where Chinnery's half-lunatic wife
and the peasant-woman whom he really loved meet over
his death-bed. . In short, a moving and in many ways a
beautiful story, but one to be prescribed with caution.
Why have so many of our novelists taken to producing
enormous volumes marked by a pre-Raphaelite fidelity to
detail? The latest convert is Mr. W. S. MAUGHAM, whose
usual manner I seem to recall as rather impressionistic.
But in his new novel, Of Human Bondage (HEINEMANN), he
is, so to speak, as Jean Christophy as the best of them.
This is the kind of book that tells you in six hundred and
fifty pages all you want to know about a group of characters,
and a great deal more. It is a method that resembles the
historic little girl: when it is good it is very, very good, and
when it is not it is horridly boring. Mr. MAUGHAM's case is
is not quite so bad as that ; but though his book manages
to be quite wonderfully good in parts, it yet leaves a
general impression of boredom. The trouble is that the
central character, whose career as school-boy, art-student,
doctor, shop-walker, and the rest of it, we are com-
pelled to follow so closely, never inspires enough personal
interest to make the labour one of love. Indeed, it seems
hardly in order to speak of the two protagonists as hero
and heroine; Philip remains to the last nebulous and un-
interesting, while Mildred is real enough certainly, but so
entirely detestable that we are impatient to be rid of her
society. Fortunately there are other characters in a crowded
canvas that make up for these. Miss Price, for example,
the bitter-souled little student, starving in Paris on a faith
in her own utterly imaginary genius, is one of the most
haunting and tragic figures that I have met with in recent

fiction. To balance her we have another and very different
portrait in Philip's aunt, small, tremulous Mrs. Carey, with
her pathetic love for a boorish husband and an unresponsive
nephew. For these two women alone the book was worth
writing. If only there was not quite so much of it !
The eponymous hero of Edwards, by Mr. BARRY PAIN
(WERNER LAURIE), is a gentleman who, having drawn the
suburbs blank, settles in London as a jobbing gardener and
proceeds to defraud humanity—or rather such portions of
humanity as are ill-advised enough to employ his time, of
which he cheats them, and his energies, which he reserves
for the beer-bottle and the tap-room. Edwards in his
jobbing way is as great a rogue as Barry Lyndon, and
what THACKERAY did for Lyndon Mr. BARRY PAIN here
does for Edwards. He allows him to describe himself
and his rogueries with the most perfect frankness and in
the regretful spirit of one who, in spite of occasional
blers of “idiotic drivel,” a reviewer is fairly warned before-
hand. Perhaps one's chief feeling is that our author was
so substantially right in his pleadings and prophecies (he
knew his history and he knew his Hun) that he might deal
a little less vehemently with his opponents; might perhaps
have remembered that to be right on main issues is not
equivalent to a patent of infallibility on all detail. In the
controversy of the submarine crews, for instance, in which
he was the chief advocate of the reprisals-for-piracy theory,
he certainly forgot that it was little use attempting to deal
with such matters till we were in a position to deal effec-
tively. And anyway how were these feats of the submarine,
even the crowning infamy of the Lusitania, a whit worse
than several of the more devilish outrages in Belgium and
France? Meanwhile Mr. HARRISON's eloquence helps us
to remember—no useless function, for the mind has so
surfeited on the recital of horrors that the spirit has become
a little insensitive to their significance. If we must recruit
successes, has on the wholeſ
come off second best in his
struggles against the harsh-
ness and cruelty of a censori-
ous world. Edwards is a
shrewd commentator on his
own foibles, which he admires,
and the foibles of cthers, which
he despises even while he pro-
fits by them. He describes
the stages of the gardening
fever to which ladies are liable.
“There was one garden I used
to look after up Hampstead
way. At first it was all peace
and quietness there. Nobody
ever came into the garden
except me and the cats . . . If
you managed to mow a lawn
which were about six yards
square in an eight hours' day
that was all that was expected,
and the lady would ask you if
you weren't tired when you
left, and not mean it in à
nasty way either.” Then came
the fever, and the lady wanted

The hero of Betty Wayside
(HopDER AND Stoughton) was
a composer of genius; the hero-
ine played the piano like an
angel; the major villain was a
baritone; and another man,
who had the makings of a
scamp, played the flute. So it
was music, music all the way.

to get a packet of the seed and sow it at once. Finally,
“she give me a shilling and I got a nice sixpenny pot of
daffodils with it for the trade price of fourpence.” Then
the lady bartered her husband's new suit of clothes for
fuchsias, and so on till she ordered Edwards to take up the
lawn, put in proper drainage and relay it. Of course he
couldn't stand this, so he left, and his employer lost a
treasure of drink and incompetence. Everybody will be
glad to learn that the marriage of Edwards did not make
him happy. Too much seemed to be expected of him.

he tell me why a gardener, though he always goes about
his duties without a coat, invariably retains his waistcoat,

In The German Peril (UNwiN), Mr. FREDERIC HARRISON
reprints, with comments to date, his chief utterances on
the German menace from 1863 onwards, and they make an
instructive if somewhat too obviously self-regarding docu-
ment. As Mr. HARRIsoN has a short sharp way of dealing
with those who venture to differ from him, labelling them
“sanctimonious purists,” “snivelling journalists,” or bab-
lie on a bed of roses. When,
however, I remember that Walter Chippendale walked some-
times as if he was “possessed of devils,” I am bound to
admit that he was not anything like so uncomfortable a
lover as he sounds. Indeed, I found his courtship of Betty
far more tolerable than the intrigues of a bevy of youths
and maidens whose many affairs of the heart strained my
patience to breaking point. The scenes of this book are
laid in Sydney, and when the author—whose name, Louis
Stone, is unknown to me—has lear ed not to overcrowd
her stage all should be easy sailing for her. She has a
real love of music, and more than a little knowledge of
those wonderful (but slightly disturbing) people to whom
music is an absorbing passion.

A DEAR OLD FETISH.
[The author of these lines has no great quarrel with those writers
(if any) who honestly believe that the adoption of National Service
would bring in only a negligible addition to the country's military
strength, though even so it would finally prove to our Allies that we
are in earnest. But a very brief study of the facts would show that
among those who follow callings which contribute nothing to the
making of munitions or to our export trade or to any other national
need there must still be between two or three million men of fighting
age, a number probably not less than the total of those who have
enlisted for active service since the War began.]
SoME for their fathers' ancient faith will fight,
For land and liberty their lives will give,
But we of England, if I read aright,
Have something dearer yet for which to live;
“Take from us any joys you like,” we cry;
“We'd bear the loss, however much we missed 'em ;
Let truth and justice, fame and honour die,
But spare, O spare, our Voluntary System ||
“'Tis true that other service owed the State
Lays on the general head its common due;
One sticks it willy-nilly—tax or rate—
Nor leaves the man next door to pay for two;
But, should the Nation call for soldier's work,
Saying, “I want more men; I must enlist 'em ; "
Two million odd shall claim the right to shirk
By virtue of the Voluntary System.”
Splendid For, if our strength is overtasked
For lack of larger service, man and gun,
And by compulsion (no one's leave being asked)
We are reduced to helots of the Hun;
How fine, from our address “Somewhere in Hell,”
When we have bowed to WILLIAM's boots and
kissed 'em,
To boast—“Though England's fallen, yet she fell
True to her hallowed Voluntary System.” O. S
our REGIMENTAL SPORTs.
WE held them in camp, and they passed off with less
than usual of the friction commonly associated with such
events. It is true that the regulars who shared our
neighbourhood elected, in a spirit of friendly emulation, to
hold their sports on the same day, but we came to an
amicable agreement as to the division of the available
wounded soldiers and other spectators. We didn't invite the
Provost-Marshal, partly because we thought that a number
of volunteers in uniform, complete with brassard, whilst
not engaged in strict military duties, might bring on an
attack of dyspepsia, and partly because we knew that he
| was busy using his free pass to the music-halls.
In the tug-of-war, the Motor Squadron ought to have
been handicapped, as the practice which they had had
in hauling their cars out of ditches gave them an unfair
advantage. An attempt by A Company to make up for
their want of skill by trickery proved abortive. They
concealed entrenching tools about their persons and
promptly fell down and started digging themselves in.
There is a slight difference of opinion as to whether their
Company Commander was justified in blowing the “Cease
fire" on his whistle in order to encourage them at the
moment when they were on the verge of defeat.
The obstacle race was a great disappointment to the
Ambulance section, as there were scarcely any casualties
worth mentioning. The two men who were nearly suffo-
cated under the tarpaulin both “came to ” while the
stretchers were being fetched, and the way in which
Holroyd's collar-bone refused to break was declared by the
Ambulance to be contrary to all the rules of anatomy and
could only have been brought about by a malicious desire
to deprive them of a well-merited case. Holroyd says that
he always “takes off" from his collar-bone when going over
an obstacle and that he would have won the race but
for the officious interference of the Ambulance. In the end
the Ambulance section had to content themselves with one
sprained ankle, two barked shins, and Bailey's contused
eye. Bailey's eye got like that through the success of my
scheme in substituting a painted over-ripe egg for the apple
in his basin of water. The apple has to be got out of the
basin of water by the competitor with his mouth, without
the use of his hands. I explained to Bailey before the
race that the correct procedure was to get the apple
against the side of the basin and then give it a sharp bite.
If Bailey's apple hadn't been an egg he would have been
very successful, but he was so surprised when he found half
an unpalatable egg in his mouth that he dropped his glasses
in the basin. The Judge, who hadn't thoroughly grasped
the situation, refused to allow Bailey to fish for his glasses
and insisted on his proceeding with the race. Bailey, who
doesn't see very well with glasses and is practically blind
without them, set off in the wrong direction, trod on the
man next to him, and contused his eye on the basin next
but one. The man on whom Bailey trod was very cross
because, after two abortive attempts to eat his own beard,
he had just secured the apple and, owing to Bailey's
clumsiness, he had to start all over again,
If we had told the people who loaned us the forms that
we were going to use them for a land boat race I expect
that they would have supplied us with a more durable make
or else not loaned any at all. Higgs lost the race for our
Company by falling off in front of our boat. By the time
that we had discovered that he was lying on the missing
leg of our form the Motor Squadron, whose mechanical
experience had enabled them to adjust the dislocated parts
of their form quicker than anyone else, had won the race.
In the Staff race the hired Cook's Mate, who doesn't
understand military discipline, tactlessly beat our Com-
mandant by about two ribs of beef. Our Commandant
was, as usual, closely followed by the Adjutant, with the
rest of the Staff at a respectful distance. The Camp
Quartermaster got a bad start owing to an ill-timed enquiry
by the cook as to whether any provision had been made
for the next morning's breakfast. -
In spite of the misapplied energy of Bailey, Higgs and
Holroyd our Company scored the greatest number of points
and won the Company Challenge Cup. The only trouble
about that cup is that we don't know what to do with it
now that we have got it. Our Company Commander seems
condemned to carry it about with him for the rest of his life.
Whenever he puts it down someone picks it up and gives
it back to him. The last time that I saw him he was starting
on a seven-mile march from the camp to the nearest railway
station carrying the cup, which had just been handed to
him for the fifteenth time.

CHARLIE.
For weeks there has been no escap-
ing him. Nations might be at each
other's throats; Zeppelins might be
dropping bombs upon sleeping families;
hopes and fears might make hearts
beat faster, while a sense of calamity
filled the air; yet all the time his claims
as a gravity-remover in earcelsis have
met one's eyes at every turn. Some-
times they were fortified by effigies of
himself, both life-size and gigantic, a
representation of one of which recently
found its way into a drawing in Mr.
Punch's own pages. More than one
weekly paper has been printing his
autobiography serially.
The time clearly having come to
investigate this personality, I entered

In the course of five minutes he receives
and distributes a myriad black eyes,
a myriad falls. He kicks abundantly
and is abundantly kicked. He runs
and is pursued. There is no physical
indignity that he does not suffer—and
inflict. Such impartiality is rare in
drama, where usually men are either
on top or underneath. In the ordinary
way our pet comedians must be on
top—as, for example, Mr. GEORGE
GRAVEs with his serenely conquering
tongue. Even the clown, though he
receives punishment en route, eventually
triumphs. But CHARLIE CHAPLIN sel-
dom wins. Circumstances are too much
for him, and he goes out in a very riot
of grotesque misfortune. With him,
however, are always our sympathies.

is resiliency under difficulties, an un-
abashed and undefeatable front.
By gestures rather than facial play
does he gain his ends—gestures allied to
acrobatic gifts of no mean order. He
has a host of comic steps, a thousand
odd movements of his hands and head,
which, when brought into play under
domestic or social conditions, are ab-
surdly funny. With his hat, his stick
and his cigarette, he has also a vast
repertory of quaint actions; and it was
a wise instinct that caused him always
to appear in the same costume. But
his especial fascination is that life finds
him always ready for it—not because
he is armed by sagacity, but because he
is even better armed by folly. He is
first cousin to the village idiot, a natural
child of nonsense, and, like ANTAEUs,
play with the famous man
at his best. And then I
entered others, for Chap-
linism had caught me.
Whether or not CHARLIE
CHAPLIN is, as is claimed
for him by certain not
disinterested people, the
“funniest man on earth,”
I leave to others to de-
cide. Two persons rarely
agree on such nice points,
and I retire at once from
the arbitrament because I
don't know all the others.
But that he is funny is
beyond question. I will
swear to that. His hu-
mour is of such elemental
variety that he would
make a Tierra del Fuegan
or a Bushman of Central
Australia laugh not much
“WHAT YE DoING THERE, JARGE2"

every time he rises from a
knockdown blow he is the
stronger.
The promise of CHAPLIN
is sacred; the promise of
John BRADBURY is not
, more so. Seeing him, one
%. , is assured that he is about
to make hay of all the
other dramatis personae.
One may sit back safely
and prepare for fun. He
joins the film in his un-
obtrusive methodist way
as quietly as a smut
settling on a nose, and
behold he is the very spirit
of discord, the drollest of
all the lords of misrule.
Wherever he goes CHARLIE
CHAPLIN is crossing the
equator
less than our sophistical selves. One
needs no civilised culture to appreciate
the fun of the harlequinade, and to
that has CHARLIE, with true instinct,
returned. But it is the harlequinade
accelerated, intensified, toned up for
the exacting taste of the great and
growing “picture" public. It is also
farce at its busiest, most furious.
CHARLIE has brought back that admir-
able form of humour which does not
disdain the co-operation of fisticuffs,
and in which, by way of variety, one
man is aimed at and another, too
intrusive, is hit. However long the
world may last, it is safe to say that
the spectacle of one man receiving a
blow meant for another will ever be
popular. Indeed the delivery of blows
at all will ever be popular. Thus—
lory be l—are we built.
What strikes one quickly is the realisa-
tion of how much harder CHARLIE works
than any other of the more illustrious
filmers. He is rarely out of the picture,
the paragraphs tell the truth) are his
only reward; for of course our laughter
he cannot hear. Yet I suppose no one
man has, in the same space of time,
ever made so many people laugh as he.
Whether his fellow cinema actors laugh
I cannot say. But everyone else does.
It is a curious thought that CHARLIE
does not hear it.
In the pictures CHARLIE has no
immediate rival, although on the actual
variety stage I have seen several drolls
very much in his tradition, which is
associated with the name of KARNo.
One detects the KARNo brand at once,
but in CHARLIE CHAPLIN, on the syn-
thesizing film, it has an extra drop of
nervous fluid. He has none of the
bland masterfulness of the urbane and
adventurous MAX LINDER ; he has none
of the massive repose of the late John
BUNNY; he is without the resource of
the Italian Polidor. He remains

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE FRONT.
THE ideal of every good soldier is, I
am sure, to go through a battle that
isn't really dangerous and emerge from
it with a wound that doesn't really
hurt. At the moment I have attained
this disreputable consummation and am
in the rare and refreshing fruit stage.
We are all proud of ourselves, and
quite a number of the best people have
wired to let us know they are proud of
us, so perhaps I ought to let you know
about Our Battle. I can, I am afraid,
only give it you from my point of view.
At three something, A.M., during the
most horrible noise since the cubist
orchestra disbanded, I attacked with
magnificent élan. I ran a dozen yards
and fell into a shell-hole, then I got up
and ran some more yards, and then,
dear reader, I did the only possible
thing—I walked. You who cover
your five hundred yards at a run on
Hampstead Heath have no idea what
| you feel like starting off up-hill, on a
hot night, after five days' close con-
finement, equipped with everything
considered essential to destroying, sav-
ing, and supporting life for a period of
twenty-four hours. Fortunately a
similar feeling seemed to have got hold
of the men, and we went on looking º
like a sample of how not to perform
extended order drill until we fell into a
transverse depression which we even-
tually decided to be a trench. I con-
ferred with myself for a moment, and
realized that it wasn't the line we
wanted, so we dashed on again relent-
lessly, at a pace that would have left a
hedgehog standing, to our goal, where
we remained, after necessary altera-
tions, until they sent some unsuspect-
ing regiment to relieve us next morning.
The first remark, as distinct from a
shout, that I heard after leaving our
parapet came from Private Henry, my
most notorious malefactor. As the
first attempt at a wire entanglement
in our new position went heavenward
ten seconds after its emplacement, and
a big tree just to our right collapsed
suddenly like a dying pig, he turned
round with a grin, observing, “Well,
Sir, we do see a bit of life, if we don't
make money.” I never saw a man all
day who hadn't a grin ready when you
passed, and a bit of a riposte if you
passed the time of day with him. And
so we went away at last with our tails
up, having done all things needful.
It was then that my troubles began.
Some evilly disposed person imagined
he had seen a bullet come into me and
sneaked about it to the doctor, who
came to enquire after it. I argued that
even if it had come in it had gone
straight on practically without stop-

ping and that I had no idea where it
was, and, anyhow, there must be plenty
without bothering about that one, if it
was munitions they wanted. I touched
lightly on our eight-mile march back,
and offered to illustrate a new one-step
I had thought out.
The fact was, I explained, it was

So here I am, doing the month, and
the only complaint I have to make
now I'm really settled in here—they
haven't moved me for two days—is
about the fortnight's holiday.
The regiment says, “Of course you'll
get sick leave;” whereas the doctor
here is so optimistic as to suggest that
I'll probably be able to get regimental
leave, but sick leave is outside his pro-

when I have hopes of getting both ;

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
STRENUous TIMEs.
Hostel for Munition Workers
(Ci-devant Broadacres).
DEAREST DAPHNE,-You see from
above heading that we've turned our
place in Kent to useful purposes. I've
a houseful of people here, and we're all
working at full pressure. We motor
over every morning, several carfuls of
us, to the big factory at — Hush 1–
and there we make—no, not even to
you, dearest!—all day. We were shown
how to do it by an official person who's
distinctly inclined to be a darling. He
specially overlooks our work, and the
other day when he came round he asked
me what it was I had made. “Why,
it's so-and-so, of course,” I said. Beryl
and Babs were looking on, and it was
quite a little triumph for me. He said
it was absolutely wonderful that I'd
been able to make anything so different
from the pattern, and he took it away
(to test it, I believe); and, entre mous,
chérie, I fancy that by some lucky
unconscious stroke of genius I’ve
made something particularly deadly
and fearful; but not a word ' To-day
I've been put on something different.
At our work we wear Olga's latest,
the very last word in Munition Pinnies,
a dream and a scream in one, pour qui
sait le porter. We come home in the
afternoon to a thé 6conomique, milk
instead of cream, only one lump of
sugar in each cup, and horrid plain
biscuits and bread-and-butter. Still,
we feel it's discipline and that we're
obeying orders. Nobody dresses for
dinner, and it's quite a plain meal,
badly served (we've not found a decent
cook since Gaston left us to join his
own army), but we don't care. I feel
it's not right to eat anything but pink
mutton, burnt beef, tough poultry and
odious puddings, in the present state of
things. We've only maidservants, with
the exception of an old butler of nearly
seventy, and what with drilling and
route-marching all day with the Village
Veterans he's so tired by dinner-time
that he regularly falls asleep as he
serves the barley-water. The other
night, while he was standing behind
Josiah's chair, he went off as usual and
dreamed, as he told us afterwards, that
the Village Veterans were at the Front
and that he was just taking a certain
German Prince prisoner. Under the
influence of the dream he fell upon
Josiah and seized him round the throat,
and there was quite a horrid scene
before we could wake him.
You see from this that Josiah's back
from his enormous wanderings and
adventures. When he first got home
he was immensely sunburned and had
quite an expression, and on my re-
marking upon it he said, “I should
think I have an expression | It's enough
to give anyone an expression to be
shipwrecked and cast away among
those old cannibals, the Boldereens,
and for months together not to know
each morning whether you'll be their
king or their dinner before night !” His
expression's wearing off now, I'm
glad to see. As I said to him, that
sort of thing isn't good form; in civi-
lised life it's correct to have very little
expression in one's face. Since he came
back he's enrolled himself as quite a
lot of things that I can't remember
just now. -
You'd hardly recognise this place of
ours. My own, own flower-garden is
all cabbages and potatoes; the tennis
courts and croquet lawns are given up
to turnips and carrots; Ladye Betty's
Walk is sown with onions; the park is
being ploughed up for corn or wheat or
whatever it is people eat most of ; our
own dear little golf-links are full of
creatures grazing; the little wilderness
you were so fond of is crowded with
pigs; there's poultry pretty well every-
where; and the big conservatory is
used for bread-fruit, of which Josiah
brought back heaps of roots—isn't that
a lovely idea for war-time, dearest?—for
the bread-fruit, when grown and ripe,
I suppose, is just a nice sort of loaf
that only wants cutting into slices !
Altogether we may claim to be ready
for anything. If everyone would do as
much as we're doing, England would
be entirely self-supporting and we
shouldn't have to import any food-
stuffs—forgive the technical term,
dearest; I'm afraid I am getting tech-
nical, and sometimes, Daphne, I'm
almost frightened at the organising
talents I'm developing.
Juno farrington, the Southlands'
girl, commandeered all their motor cars
and offered them and herself (she's an
expert driver) for transport service
abroad, was accepted, and went off at
once, leaving a brief note for her par-
ents: “Sorry, dears, but our country
needs the cars, and you'll both be the
better for more walking.” The duchess
came round to me (it was before we
left town) in floods of tears, lamenting
the dangers and hardships her “Only
One" was gone to face, and exclaiming
between her weeps, at frequent inter-
vals, “What would her grandmamma
have said ' " I tried to console her,
said how proud she ought to be of
Juno, and that one couldn't expect a
high-spirited girl, especially in war-
time, to trouble much about what her
grandmamma would have said; but it
was no use. The fact is the little
duchess is a muslin woman, and her
daughter's a cloth woman, and to the
end of time you'll never get a muslin
woman and a cloth woman to see
things from the same point of view.
I'd a letter from Juno yesterday, in
which she says, “Doing fine and mak-
ing myself very useful. I've both my
motor-cycles here, and I won't rest till
the powers that be make me a despatch-
rider. Think, Blanche, how glorious if
I were laid low by shrapnel just as I
was tearing along with despatches |
Why, the boy I ought to have been
couldn't do much better than that l
Comfort the dear little mother, there's
a good fellow, and do, do try to persuade
her not to send me a sob by every post.”
Beryl and Babs and I were discuss-
ing the famine in coloured materials
one day lately, and the prospect of
having to array ourselves in the dis-
mallest and dreariest of neutral tints,
and we jointly committed these little

MILITARY COMPLIMENTS.
IF Brinton was not a good soldier it
was scarcely for want of trying. But
there are things in “Infantry Training”
not dreamed of in a shipping clerk's
philosophy. And after a heated passage
or two with the Company Sergeant-
Major (in which, as Brinton explained
afterwards, the victory was really his,
because, while the S.-M. was merely
making an exhibition of himself before
the company, Brinton was being
brilliant and scathing within his own
heart to an intelligent audience of one),
he decided to leave his general military
development to the processes of time,
and to specialise. Wherefore he pur-
chased a neat volume on “Ceremonial,”
and stuck to it.
Here and there a soul finds its secular
bible in strange places, and Brinton
found it in the book on Ceremonial. It
was meat and drink to him. It filled
his whole existence. And the part of
it he loved the best of all was the part
where they tell you How and When to
Salute. In a fortnight Brinton had
saluted the Colonel in fifteen different
situations, each of them requiring
correctitude of movement combined
with that initiative on which is founded
the superiority of the British army.
On the last five of these the Adjutant
was present. He had heard of Brinton,
and came to scoff, but remained to
admire.
After a time Brinton became known
in the battalion. Young subalterns,
still nervous in their new dignity, were
apt to invite his salute whenever they
felt the responsibilities of their position
weighing too heavily upon them. It
would have given confidence to the
veriest wash-out. It was not so much
the respect and deference it conveyed
as the assurance that the Army had
laid its trust most tenderly in the
temporary Second Lieutenant. It said:
“We know all about you. We have
seen you take the Company. We have
heard your lectures on Flies and March
Discipline. But we will follow you
none the less—or at least we will take
you with us.”
Once or twice a daring spirit would
get about in the officers' mess. They
would give Brinton parcels to fetch
from the poste-restante and wait for
him in the High Street, extended to
three paces. But Brinton was never
beaten. His hands might be full, but
his “eyes right” was impeccable.
There was more professional pride in it
than in the evolutions of a dozen right
hands sweeping to a dozen forelocks.
They say Brinton was beaten in the
end. I have heard the tale of how
Captain Briggs brought him to alleged

confusion. But to my mind the victory
on that occasion was Brinton's yet
again, though all the devices of mis-
placed ingenuity were employed against
him. Time, place, and circumstances
were all chosen carefully with a view to
his confounding. The same Sergeant-
Major who had earlier crossed his path
was given the job on a rainy summer
morning of sending him back from break-
fast parade to fetch Captain Briggs's
bicycle from his billet to the officers'
mess tent. The approach to that high
place is steep and rocky, along a wooded
defile, and Captain Briggs stepped out
of the ambush where he had been lying
with three. other conspirators who
ought to have known better, and was
upon Brinton seconds before the
famous “eyes right" could get into
motion.
It is true, I daresay, that the intrepid
Private gave a start of surprise, the
very faintest shadow of a start. Cap-
tain Briggs smiled sardonically and
waited. Behind the bracken three
pairs of eyes bulged expectantly from
their sockets.
Brinton stopped. He met the Cap-
tain's tremendous gaze with a look
in which surprise, resentment, pity
and devotion to discipline were about

TWITTING THE TURK.
THE Turk, he is an honest man
And fights us fair and true,
But we annoy him all we can
As we are paid to do;
It's very hard to keep him riled;
We find him strangely reconciled
And things that once just made him wild
He takes a liking to.
The bully tin no more insults,
The Libby gives no grief,
That used to soar from catapults
And biff the shocked Redif:
At first it gave him quite a turn,
The flight of that innocuous urn,
And then he spoiled the whole concern
By gobbling up the beef.
Yet when the cruder kind of wheeze
No longer irritates,
There's one that never fails to tease
His friends across the Straits,
Where many a Moslem scans our slopes
(With now and then some cramp, one
hopes,
From looking long through telescopes)
And simply hates and hates.
We go and bathe, in shameless scores,
Beneath his baleful een,
Disrobe, unscathed, on sacred shores
And wallow in between ;
Nor does a soldier there assume
His university costume,
And though it makes the Faithful fume
It makes the Faithless clean.
Ay, all our arts have some reward,
But this I think's the peach,
For man can bear the invaders' horde
That riots in his reach,
That raids his roost in arméd swarms
Or swamps his citadels with storms,
But not their nude insulting forms
A-bathing off his beach.

Lieut. John Smith, a Territorial officer,
when crossing the Strand at about

II. How IT IS CLOTHED.
(a) By The Daily Mail.
We offer no excuse or apology for
calling special attention to the very
disquieting incident reported on page 5.
As our readers are by this time aware,
the policy of The Daily Mail (backed,
it is only fair to add, by the generous
ſ
/
support of The Times and The Evening
News) has throughout been opposed
to the soothing-syrup methods of the
official censorship. From the fact that
the accident by which a gallant officer
very narrowly escaped destruction has
been allowed to be made public, it
would appear that at least in part the
TRUTH, for which we have so earnestly |
pleaded, is at last to be told to the
people of this country. But it will be
noticed that we emphasise the words |
We do this deliberately |
“in part.”
and with a grave regard to our
enormous responsibility in this hour
of crisis. Here then is a direct
challenge. Let the War Office or the
Government publish at once a full list ||
of the numbers of officers and men in
His Majesty's service who have, since |
July, 1914, been injured, or nearly in-l
jured, in street accidents. We venture
to assert that the result would be such
an outcry from all classes for somebody |
to do something that no obstructionist,
no matter how highly placed, could
dare stand against it.
(b) By The Westminster Gazette.
That section of the Conscriptionist
Press which remains still obstinately
blind to the magnificent results of the
Voluntary System will, we suppose,
prudently ignore the illuminating case
of Lieut. John Smith. There are, how-
ever, two aspects of it to which we feel |
justified in directing the notice of our
readers. First, the accident itself, with
what might easily have been the loss or ||
serious injury of a valuable officer, is
directly attributable to the absurd and |
panicky over-darkening of our streets.
Again and again we have pointed out ||
that the Germans have no really |
dangerous Zeppelins capable of inflict-
ing serious damage, and indeed that |
so many more have already been des-
troyed than could ever have been built |
that the number now available must

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE AMATEUR SHEPHERD.
It is a long climb from Dawlish to
Haldon. I appreciated this on two
separate occasions, once horse-driven
and again with the aid of petrol. In
both instances I was pointedly assured
by my family that it would be far better
for my health and figure if I walked
the distance. As far as I remember,
I made no audible answer, but I may
have lifted my chin to stretch the skin
under it and sub-consciously squared
my shoulders.
However, the day came when, desti-
tute of other ideas, I whimsically
resolved to try the ancient pastime of
pedestrianism, and a certain tightening
of the waistcoat in the first few strides
I said that I knew no Shaw as I was
just up from London. I had once
known a Shaw but he was not a farmer.
He wasn't even an Englishman, thank
goodness.
Then the shepherd said that the man
Shaw's farm might be up a certain
slope, and he swept his hand over a
fence by the wayside. I nodded, and
he said, “Do ee mind sheep while us go
an' see.” I said I'd keep an eye on
them, and he was off in a twinkling for
all his lame leg. -
I sat on a fence and watched the
sheep. It was a beautiful summer
afternoon, The flies were making the
best of the brief spell of fair weather.
The sheep browsed on the banks of the
lane, and I lit a cigar. - -
he saw me. At the moment I was
lighting a fresh cigar. -
He abused me. He called me every- |
thing that I would have liked him to call
the real shepherd. And as a final blow
he said I ought to be in khaki. I felt
for him, but it was so difficult to explain.
I even offered him a quotation from
“The Pickwick Papers” about shep-
herds.
gammon.” He went away very scarlet,
and the flies simply surged after him.
By now I had had enough. Fifty.
minutes was a fair afternoon's work
for one's first try at shepherding.
Another day, perhaps, a little longer.
I decided to go back home.
The sheep near me moved. They
moved on down the lane. I stopped
had the effect of turning
my steps in the direction
of the Dawlish-Haldon
slope.
Things went splendidly
for fully twenty minutes,
There came that novel .
and astounding satisfac- º
tion which steeps the soul
when one realises that one
is actually propelling one-
self for no other purpose
than the mere pleasure
of propulsion. Vaguely
enough, it is true, I felt
athletic. I flipped away
the flies with my hand-
kerchief as if I’d been
doing that sort of thing
all my life. Then I met
the shepherd.
He drove a score of red
sheep, and he had red eyes
behind black-rimmed spec-
tacles. He was young and
“’E DIDN'T oughT TO BE 'Low ED To SKETCH THE old cAstLE 1 ''
“WHY NOT 2 'E AIN'T GOT IT NOTHIN’ LIKE '''
and scratched my head.
Then the sheep behind
me ran up and passed
me, so that I had all the
sheep now in front of
me.
I moved quietly on so
that they might not hear
my footsteps. Unfortun-
ately I trod on an acorn
which crackled, and the
sheep heard. So the sheep
still went on in front of
II le.
I stopped, hoping they
wouldn't notice I was not
following. They went on,
and I thought I was free
till suddenly one old fool
at the head of the division
turned his head and de-
tected me. Then they all
stopped and looked back
at me, with faces much
more like sheep than any
old and sprightly and lame.
He carried his coat over his left arm,
and when the sheep hopped up the
banks of the lane he swore fruitfully.
He looked at me as if he had a griev-
ance.
Was there a farm way back that I
had passed ? I said “No.” Then I
| said “Perhaps yes.” He looked at me
very oddly.
But was I to blame? I am from the
city. How does one know a farm 2
Let the townsman reflect on this
matter carefully before blaming me. I
had passed houses, and lightly enough
I regarded them as mere dwelling
places. It is just possible, I reflected
after my first negative to the shepherd,
that some of those houses have in
hiding behind them that which would
entitle them to the appellation of farm.
I told all this to the shepherd.
He then said that he had to drive the
sheep to a farm whose owner's name
was Shaw, or so it sounded to my ears.
Half an hour passed. The sheep
had straggled a bit, but I could see
them all. Of course I might lose one,
but then I could easily get another from
one of the fields round about. Devon-
shire is simply drenched in sheep.
Hence, thought I, the dearness of
mutton. So many sheep have to be
kept alive to keep Devonshire properly
smeared with them.
After three-quarters of an hour I
looked over my shoulder for the shep-
herd. He was not in sight, nor could
I see signs of any building. I began
to have the feeling that comes when
you wake up after a sleep in the train
and are uncertain as to which side of
your destination the train has reached.
The sheep were certainly very scattered.
Now came a motor car. The driver
was very skilful. He threaded his way
in and out of the sheep just as if he
were playing a game of a game where
you have to thread in and out. Then
sheep I've ever seen.
I was helpless. I could not go the
other way as it was steep and precisely
the wrong direction. At last I thought
I would run past the flock.
I sauntered rather rapidly down on
them, and eventually got nearly along-
side. Then I took to my heels and
ran as I had never run before. The
sheep thundered along by my side. Do
all I could I never got ahead. The
stamina of the beasts was simply
appalling.
I must have run for quite three
minutes, which seemed like three hours,
before realising that I was beaten. I
was a shepherd. Fate had willed it.
A shepherd I must be and affect to be
contented with my lot.
On we went. I cooled down, and
the stroll became pleasant enough,
though passers-by regarded me sus-
piciously as if I were a sheep-stealer.
(Odd reflection There are such things
as sheep-stealers')
I said that i was “a wictim o' |

At last we came, as I knew all along
we should, to a point where the road
forked. I didn't care which way the
sheep went. I would take the road
they left. Both routes would take me
home.
The sheep bore to the left. I shoo-ed
them on. I got them well on the way.
In the distance before them I saw a
motor-car coming. I turned stealthily,
nipped round the corner on to the
other road, and ran like a hare (middle-
aged).
When safely away I turned and
looked back. At the end of the road
where I had left my flock was a

Two clever little studies by
Miss LouiF TINSLEY as a theatre

amount and quality of the liquid
refreshment she is called on to

fatuous inebriate personated by
Mr. EMNEY, deserve mention.

the cast were friendly neutrals
and that most of the rest of the
work was done by actors well
over the military age.
Quite a good joke was pro-

insisted on having a few turns

As to the Revue itself need I say
that all hypocritical pretence of co-

impressions and personalities.
To begin with, there was Miss UNITY

FISHING IN FLANDERS.
ON our last spell from the trenches
we amused ourselves by fishing a stream
that ran close to our rest billets. The
doctor, whose skill as a fisherman is
apparently as widely known on the
Tweed as it is with us after dinner in
mess, did catch one stickleback. But
| apart from this success neither the
glamour of the Entente Cordiale nor
the last word in trout rods and flybooks
had any effect on those unsportsman-
like fish. Night after night we used to
watch the village fathers returning in
triumph with their simple rods over
their shoulders, and many a fat half-
pounder stuck in their pockets winked
at us mockingly.
“Waittill Sergeant McCallum comes,”
said the Colonel, and in his advice we
found consolation. Now Sergeant
McCallum is a Scottish gillie in private
the devoted recipient of at least ten
rods and as many varieties of fly. As
we walked down to the stream that
evening I impressed upon him the
necessity of establishing our reputation
in the eyes of the village.
“I doot ma hand wilna cast a fly sae
licht after twa weeks o' throwing hand-
grenades, Sir,” he said, “and this wee
trickle isna the Tay,” pointing to the
stream ; but he was soon whipping the
water in masterly fashion.
After two hours we went home with
despair in our hearts to eat fish that
had been caught by the schoolmaster's
boy. Sergeant McCallum had failed.
“It’s a meeserable war. The very
troot are skulkin' in dug-oots,” was all
he said.
Next day we were having guests to
dinner, and the Colonel himself implored
the Sergeant to do his best. Off he
went again, but this time positively re-
life and a holy terror to the Huns in fused to allow any of us to accompany
his present capacity. British to the him. “Na, na, Sir, it's publeecity that
backbone, he views anything of foreign inteemidates the wee fish,” he said;
nature with dour suspicion. It is and when later he returned with six
characteristic of him that to the “Bon plump little trout we appreciated his
soir, M'sieur” of his hostess at bedtime preference for solitude. Oh the delight
he invariably replies with a grave
“Guid nicht, M'am.” But so far as
fishing went he was the regimental
hope, and soon after his arrival he was
of being able to reply to our guests that
night, “Yes, our own catch. We get
quite good fun in the local stream.”
For the next three nights Sergeant
McCallum came back with a good
haul, while the rest of us never got
even a bite, with the exception of the
doctor, who caught another stickleback.
On the fourth evening I determined to
find out what was the secret of the
master-hand's success. After half-an-
hour's search up-stream I heard a sad
voice coming from the direction of a
bush:-" Ay, it's a meeserable war,
and that's ma last pin.”
Cautiously I approached, and sud-
denly stopped dead. “Sergeant McCal-
lum,” I gasped, “has it come to

He started up with a guilty look. In
one hand he held a small pill evidently

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
a
ELEVEN TO ONE.
IN this house there is only one bath.
There is a state of war in this house.
Between these two statements there does not, at first
sight, appear to "be any close connection, but if you will
oblige me by reading on you will find that they are inti-
mately related to one another.
Let me explain. The house of which I speak is a seaside
lodging-house, an admirably comfortable one run by Mrs.
Rivers, the landlady, with the help of one servant. How it
is done I don't know (I suppose, by the way, there is a
concealed gnome somewhere who attends to the boots and
shoes, but I have never met him in the flesh); at any rate
the house is so run, and the whole place is kept as tidy as
a banker's office, and the meals are as punctual as the rates
and taxes and much more satisfying. -
At present the house is filled to its utmost capacity by
two parties of lodgers—ourselves (the usual sort of party
composed of two parents and four children), and the other
party, who preceded us, composed of five grown-ups. That
makes eleven in all, and every man-Jack and woman-Jill of
them, down to the youngest child, is devoted to that noble
British institution, the morning bath. The fact that later
on we all bathe in the sea makes no difference. Sea-bathing
must not be looked upon as a substitute for anything.
Properly considered it is an addition to one's ordinary life.
Here, then, is the situation. Given eleven people, who
are all waked at 7.30 A.M., who all want to breakfast at 8.30,
and who all desire passionately to have a bath before break.
fast, how on earth are they to do it when, as I say, there is
only one bath in the house, and when I add that it is a
fixed bath in a bath-room and that its taps run with an
almost maddening slowness? Now do you begin to under-
stand what I meant when I said that there is a state of
war in this house? Of course you do.
The first morning saw us completely defeated. I must
own that we had paid no attention to the matter. We had
not realised the necessity for guile and stratagem. We just
rushed upon our fate blindly, and each of us in turn
recoiled from a locked door behind which water was
gurgling and someone, not ourselves, was abluting. On
that terrible morning only Muriel and Frederick of our
party got baths, and they were both twenty minutes late
for breakfast. The rest of us did what we could with our
basins and sponges in our various bedrooms. As an alter-
native to a full-length bath this basin-system cannot be
recommended. It combines every sort of inconvenience.
Paradoxically enough the water is always insufficient and
never fails to overflow on to the floor. Indeed it is a
hateful system.
On the second morning we planned things out with some
care. Alice was told off to be firmly established in the
bathroom at 7 o'clock, and thenceforward we had relays,
strung out along the passages. On that day we got in four
baths, but after that we were hopelessly beaten off by a
violent counter-attack of the enemy who had been awaiting
a favourable moment in dressing-gówns and slippers. Nina
and Frederick were foiled and all their pluck was un-
availing. Frederick, indeed, who is eight years old,
declared that these skirmishes added an unaccustomed zest
to washing. He showed great courage and swiftness in
the imminent deadly breach.
Since then we have had our good days, when we actually
got in five baths, and our bad days, when we were reduced
to two, but we have never for a moment abandoned the
fight. I myself have a special opponent who lives in the
bedroom next to mine. He is an extraordinarily quick
mover, but so, I flatter myself, am I. Several times, when
I thought I had him at my mercy, he has beaten me into
the bathroom by the mere point of his chin. Later in the
day we all meet quite unconcernedly. We say to one
another, “What beautiful weather,” or “The news seems
better this morning,” and to all outward appearance we are
on perfectly good terms with one another; but in truth
we are bitter and determined enemies. How can it be
otherwise when there are eleven people for only one bath 2
THE PASSING OF THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.
(An evening paper assures us that the mother-in-law joke is
most certainly dead.)
Is she to pass and wake no lamentation,
Dirgeless depart to where the old jokes go,
Unwept, unhonoured by an ingrate nation?
Nay, it shall not be so.
I, even I, will take the lyre and twang it,
Sounding a note suggestive of distress,
Twining the cypress round my forehead. Hang it !
A song-wright can't do less.
A time there was one sought in vain to dodge her;
She was the red-nosed star's unfailing wheeze,
Better than jeux d'esprit about the lodger
Or tales of mobile cheese.
So now in every Empire should be sorrow,
The sobs of comics mourning for the best
Friend that they had, and musing on a morrow
• Reft of its cosmic jest.
Our bardlets too should mourn, bright wits who
hymned her,
Seeing the humour of their frequent strain
Dimmed as a street lamp, ay, and even dimmeder,
Clean cut off at the main.
Where shall they find her like? What thing, what
person
Shall serve them as a universal draw,
A theme one needs but write a doggerel verse on
To gain the loud guffaw 2

PUNCH'S WAR CARTOONS.
A selection of the most notable of Punch's War-Cartoons
is being published by the Photochrom Co. in association
with the Proprietors of Punch. The first twelve of this
series have been already issued. They are reproduced from
the original plates on tinted Indian paper and mounted on
rough-edged white Whatman boards, with the legends and
dates inscribed below. These prints, apart from the excel-
lence of their artistry, will form a unique historical record
of the memorable features and episodes of the Great War.
They are published at 2s. 6d. each and can be obtained at
any picture shop, or post-free in the United Kingdom from
the Publisher, Punch Offices, 10, Bouverie Street, E.C.
“Among the daft of the 4th Welsh Regiment, most of the Cardigan
Company are included.”—Cardigan Advertiser.
The fact that these gallant Welshmen were “mad to go to
the Front " might, we think, have been more tactfully
indicated.

MR. GALsworthy's The Freelands (HEINEMANN) is in the
manner, the best of the manner, of The Country House,
The Island Pharisee, The Patricians. The Freelands were
of a solid persistent stock. Four brothers represent the
present generation : Felic, the writer, capable, under-
standing, critically detached, even a little §.o.º.
with heart emphatically in the right place; widower John,
something important, permanent and unimaginative in the
Home Office; Stanley, the plough-maker, husband of the
aspiring Clara with a coronet in her eye, and her week-end
parties of pretentious bigwigs, interested in a more or less
futile and insincere way in “the land"; and that thorn in
all their essentially solid sides, Tod, the primitive, with his
thatched cottage honeysuckle-twined, his formidable wife
Kirsteen of the blue linen gown, the banded hair and the
vegetarian diet, and their wild offspring, Derek and Sheila,
hand in glove with Labour and all that. A practised art
“presents” all these in a comedy (that droops to tragedy)
of indictment against some bad foibles of entrenched
property and tradition; and in particular that plausibly
defensible attitude of those who so clearly know what is
good for their people that they don't hold their hand from
coercion of a very effective kind. The tragedy comes by
that desperately harassed labourer, Tryst, who fires Sir
Gerald Mallory's ricks and finds a grim release, after three
months' waiting for assizes, from his inevitable sentence.
Here Mr. GALsworthy forces us to recognise his impassioned
sense of the bitterness of imprisonment and of the disabili-
ties of unvocal unimportant folk. Also that desperate hope-
lessness of his outlook which makes him turn his labourers
against their champions Derek and Sheila as against
hereditary enemies. Besides and above all this work of the
satirist and social pathologist, the artist GALsworthy has
made many admirable portraits; in particular of Felic's
entirely adorable daughter Nedda and dear old Grand-
mamma Freeland, a beautiful study which even a regrettable
touch of caricature cannot spoil. Irony of the subtlest,
sensitive observation and a fine craft of construction and
development will captivate any reader who knows what's
what.
The publisher's paragraph on the cover of Mr. PETT
RIDGE's latest book, The Kennedy People (METHUEN), says
that it “opens with a wedding-day at Highbury New Park,
and finishes with a boat train at Waterloo Station."
Which indeed embodies the best description and criticism
of it that could be given. London scenes and types and
incidents, strung together by the history of three generations
of Kennedys, make up the total. Perhaps in the last phrase
I have without intention expressed a suspicion that did
occur to me, that the author has at times padded out the
volume with material that might have been meant for short
story use. But I do not suppose anyone will mind that
very much. The Kennedy history is what you might call a
circular one; old Mr. K. having built up a prosperous
fortune, which Robert, his son, sent to ruin, while in the end
George, the grandson, is shown in a fair way to restore the
family position. In short, a reverse of the old adage,
“Clogs to clogs in three generations;” naturally also an
aspect of the case decidedly more cheerful to read about.
I fancy however that it would be spendthrift Robert whom
Mr. PETT RIDGE himself most enjoyed. There are incidents

in Robert's career (the fraudulent deputation, for example, sensational novels I had read for a very long time.
which resulted in a subsequent and genuine one being
expelled with ignominy) that I could feel sure have been
in the author's note-book awaiting exposure for a con-
siderable time. And the history of his adventures as a
dramatist was obviously as great a pleasure to write as to
read. And there, with the exception of a little mystery,
no very baffling matter, you have the whole. What it lacks
in continuity of interest it makes up in detail; those little
touches of character and talk in which the author stands
alone. What, I wonder, would Mr. PETT RIDGE do in a
world where there were no commenting domestics?
Mrs. ARNOLD has chosen for her latest book, The En-
chanting Distance (LONG), a title so pleasant that one can
only wonder why it should not have been appropriated
before. And the book itself is thoroughly pleasant too, should not take a place high up in the front rank of
though rather formless and
overcrowded; both of which ºf
defects however could be º
excused on the ground of ~ –T -
likeness to life. You nº -
saw a novel with so many
heroes. There was first of
all the Colonial Bishop,
with whom Patricia (the
heroine) wanted to go away
and reform cannibals. Then
there was John Raggett,
the Bishop's strong and
silent brother, who sent
Patricia home, and inci-
dentally boxed her deserving
ears. After that there was
Adrian Dadge, an Amateur's
Help, who was introduced
to Patricia at a theatrical
house-party, and promptly
eloped with her. When
John turned up in time to
frustrate this I began to
know where my money
would be safest. But I am
bound to say that up to
the last chapter Patricia's

But
when I tackled the second half I saw what MILLs meant.
Thirty thousand words is a conservative estimate of what
could be deleted to the great benefit of the story. While
Mr. BRIDGES is getting his Lyndon out of Princetown
Prison and disguising him and taking him to London he
whizzes along at a magnificent speed. But when Lyndon
meets his old friends he displays a natural but—for the
reader—exasperating disposition to put his feet up on
the mantelpiece and talk about old times, and things
become temporarily slow. They speed up again later, but
never with quite the same careless rapture as in the very
early chapters; and the last thirty pages of the story are
| almost dull.
But in the main BooN was perfectly right;
and there is no reason why Mr. BRIDGEs, if he watches
himself carefully and purges his work of unnecessary talk,
sensational novelists. He

that he has named the vil-
. . -
lain of his present story
George, thereby flying in
the face of one of the most
rigid rules of modern fiction
which enacts that a George
can do no wrong, and that
his métier in fiction is to
be mildly comic. If Mr.
BRIDGES goes on in this
radical way we shall find
him before long having his
murders done by Freddies
and his acts of noble self-
sacrifice performed by Jas-
pers.
I suppose Miss F. E.
MILLs YouNG means her
title, The Great Unrest
(LANE), to cover both the
labour troubles in the South
Africa she knows so well
and the wayward passions
of her hero. I think, on
YoU AND ToMMY JUST COWER
the whole, I prefer the
uncertainty. Blagrove was a dramatist who wanted
Patricia to create the chief part in a play that he proposed
to write. So, as he had no money and Patricia loved
him, John came along once more and very sportingly
volunteered to put up the needful for a West End produc-
tion. As what follows upon this is not only the best part
of the tale, but a quite unconventional and unexpected
piece of probability, I will leave you to enjoy it at first
hand. It ends a story that is throughout brightly written
and makes excellent entertainment.
This is what I imagine happened. Mr. MILLs looked at
Mr. Boon. They had just finished reading the manuscript
of Mr. VICTOR BRIDGEs' novel, Mr. Lyndon at Liberty.
“What do you think of it?” said MILLs. “It’s jolly
good,” said BooN. “But too long,” said MILLs. “I could
cut thirty thousand words out of it and it would be an
improvement.” But they decided to publish it as it stood,
because they remembered that the public likes its novels
long.
Mr. Lyndon at Liberty is good—in fact, up to half-way We fail to find in this
young Dam (whose father had perversely christened him
Draycott Arthur Manners, foreseeing the nickname that
would result) splashing in his bath and making discoveries,
and the stout youngster taking his lickings from his nice
obstinate father, Sir Arthur—I prefer these pictures to
those of the adolescent Dam flirting with fishergirls, and
the grown-up Socialist journalist in the toils of a shallow
fair in queer Johannesburg. But Patricia was a dear all
through, from a bad start of snail-killing for pleasure (soon
corrected) to a brief union with her boy and an early widow-
hood. For there was nothing the matter with the real
Dam, who chose to give all that he had, including Patricia,
in the great cause. God rest such souls and comfort their

IN THE SUNDAY MANNER.
UP TO US.
BY MR. AUSTINSON BELLowMEY.
Mr. Bellowmey is facile princeps
among our more cultured and clarion-
voiced publicists. Having taken all
foreknowledge for his province, he
ranges like a young bull to the elec-
trification of England. In him litera-
ture and acuteness are reconciled.
Rarely have such trumpet-calls blared
forth as since Mr. Bellowmey sensed
profit in strepitation. In particular
is he wise upon women and strategy.
The War has produced no such
miracle as his rise to authority. Next
week we shall publish another terrific
lay-sermon from his banjo, and, in
fact, every Sunday until we think he
is played out.
Now then, Mr. KAISER, cast your
lamps over this.
When I say “up to us.” what do I
mean 2 I mean that it is for God's own
country, Great Britain, bless its heart |
—England the fair and free, bonnie
Scotland, Erin brave and impulsive,
gallant little Wales and the noble
Colonies—to carry this thing through.
EveRY MAN of BRITISH HERITAGE
HAS THE BURDEN OF DEFEATING THE
HUNs cast UPoN HIM , and when I say
the Huns I mean equally the 'uns, for
who is so base and petty to-day as to
trouble about the aspirate? To-day we
are all brothers, whether we drop our
h's or pronounce them, and all bound
together in a sacred compact to rid the
world of the tyrant. It is up to us to
do it.
Woman’s Part.
And when I say us I mean not only
men but women. What should we do

THOUGHT what woMEN MEAN ? Onl
yesterday one of the most brilliant of
living women said to me, “The women
are in trousers to-day; the men are
candidates for petticoats.” How pro-
found, how witty! When we have sent
millions of men to the War and many
are dead, how clever that was ' But
women must be taken seriously. With-
out women there can be no soldiers, for
every soldier (amazing thought !) has to
have a mother. Let us then be kind to
women, for women are the mothers
of our brave boys in khaki.
The Fourth Estate.
As for our Press, what is one to say?
Oh, my brethren, do not be misled by
our Press. Half of it is right and half
wrong, and I implore you to cleave to
the right half. Here, in this Sunday
paper, I can but sketch my real pro-
gramme as a social saviour and the
rejuvenator and renovator of England;
but in my own organ I go farther and
indulge in greater detail. On the
burning question, for example, of com-
pulsory smoking for men I say nothing
here.
Why I am silent.
I would not hamper the Government.
I have not always shown that reluc-
tance, but just now—and here—it is ex-
pedient. Moreover, I am not, any more
than any other of my fellow-citizens,
seized of the facts. Hence my some-
what quaint silence. Those who say it
is a tobacco war have some justification;
those who say that the KAISER will,
before he has done, see two weeds glow
where only one glowed before, have
reason on their side; but none the less
I hold my peace. And every man I
beseech to do likewise. WE MUST NOT
EMBARRAss THE GoverNMENT.
The Future.
As to when the War will be over, I
prefer to say nothing. I may know
and I may not. But take it from me
that no good is to be gained by letting
out the secret yet. IT IS UP To Us To
ACT, NOT TO CONSULT SOOTHSAYERs.
A MAGNIFICENT MENIAL.
THANKs to the courtesy of the pub-
lishers, Messrs. Pryor and Pepys, we
have been favoured with an early copy
of the remarkable Reminiscences of an
Imperial Footman, briefly alluded to in
our last issue. Though the book hardly
fulfils our most sanguinary expectations,
it is full of intimate touches and is
written throughout with the sobriety
and modesty that one might expect of
a highly trained and discreet domestic.
Moreover, many notables, royal, famous
and notorious, pass through its pages,
for our footman saw the very highest
in Germany, Austria, and Italy. The
style, too, is remarkably distinguished.
In fact, the author might not be un-
fairly described as a Servants' Hall
Caine. -
A flood of light is thrown on the
origin of the KAISER's implacable
hostility towards England by the fol-
lowing thrilling anecdote. It appears
that when the KAISER was staying at
Sandringham the “Song to Aegir,”
which he composed, was performed
by the KING's band in honour of the
Imperial guest. At its conclusion
the KAISER asked his uncle what he
thought of it, and KING EDwARD
genially replied “Well, it may be a
very fine piece of music, but personally
I prefer Edward ELGAR's “Land of
Hope and Glory.” The KAISER turned
pale with indignation, and from that
hour he resolved to bring about the
doom of England.
We learn also that the KAISER, at one
time thinking of marrying his only
daughter, now the Duchess of BRUNs-
WICK, to the EMPEROR MENELIK, with a
view to consolidating his interests in
Central Africa, dispatched his brother
PRINCE HENRY to conduct the ne-
cessary matrimonial negotiations. The
KAISER, it appears, had assumed that
the EMPEROR MENELIK, who was
already married, would divorce his wife
in view of the enhanced prestige to be
gained from an alliance with the House
of Hohenzollern. In this however he
was rudely disappointed, for as soon as
the EMPEROR MENELIK realised what
was expected of him he broke out into a
torrent of Abyssinian invective lasting
several hours, and then took to his bed,
remaining there until the discomfited
emissary had left his dominions.
We have heard much since the War
began of Warsaw, and this fact lends
poignant interest to a vivid little
vignette of the colour of the landscape
in Poland:—
“Where not touched with the glorious
tinting of Autumn or wilting 'neath
the blaze of the Summer sun, the
vegetation is green, though not per-
haps so verdant as that of the Emerald
Isle.”
Perhaps one of the best stories in
lighter vein is the following diverting
anecdote of a Bavarian Count who
came to Potsdam on a secret mission:-
“The Count, who was a homely
person, was invited to dine with the
EMPEROR, and during the course of the
banquet managed to upset a golden
salt-cellar. With the utmost prompti-
tude he seized a decanter of claret and
emptied it over the spilt condiment.
I have never seen the KAISER laugh so
heartily as he did at this incident.”
Quite an enthralling book, it may be
readily understood, are these Reminis-
cences of an Imperial Footman, and it
is impossible to doubt their veracity.
Extracted from a soldier's letter,
written from “Somewhere in France":—
“The Germans have got a bit of brag on
here. The lines are 600 yds. apart, and right
in the “no man's land' they have planted a
German Merchant Service Flag, to flaunt in
our faces; and everybody naturally wants to
go out to get it.”
Naturally, indeed; for the flag in
question is a rara avis in terris, and
quite extinct in maribus.
“Mr. Gerard received an invitation to call
on Herr von Jagow, and left his luncheon to
respond. They conferred for half an hour but
had nothing to say.”—German Wireless.
But as they were talking Arabic the
reporter may not have understood.

A SIDELIGHT ON HISTORY.
DURING recent excavations on the
site of the old Admiralty Office at
Cadiz, writes a correspondent in Spain,
a remarkable document has been un-
earthed, which throws interesting light
on a great historical event, and proves
conclusively that the present war is
not the first which has been won by
both sides. The parchment has been
examined by a committee of experts,
who have pronounced it to be unques-
tionably the Spanish Official account
of the Armada's expedition against
England. The following is a literal
translation:—
“On the 29th July, 1588, the Invinc-
ible Armada arrived off the Lizard,
and, proceeding along the littoral in
the direction of Plymouth, commenced
hostilities against the enemy fleet. The
English caitiffs, as usual, declined a
full battle, and contented themselves
with skirmishes in our rear. Numerous
successes were scored by our mariners
in this region, including the sinking of
two empty fishing-smacks and a forti-
fied bell-buoy. Our fleet then continued
its victorious progress up the Channel.
The damage done by the enemy's fire
was of no military significance, though
twelve of our galleons were, for strategic
reasons, allowed to sink. On arriving
off Calais, the Armada cast anchor,
when the treacherous English, contrary
to all the established rules of naval
warfare, attacked us with fire-ships,

ANOTHER WAR LOAN.”
and obtained a trifling minor success;
but off Gravelines we gained a great
victory in which twenty-two more of
our galleons were, in accordance with
our strategy, abandoned. The English
now declined battle once more, and the
statement of Admiral DRAKE that this
was done for want of food and powder,
is a barefaced falsehood. The Duke of
MEDINA SIDONIA now relinquished his
plan of picking up PARMA's army group
from the Low Countries and conceived
the brilliant idea of a naval raid on the
Orkney Islands, admittedly England's
weakest spot, but owing to the incle-
mency of the weather this daring pro-
ject was not so successful as it otherwise
must have been. Our conquering ad-
mirals then proceeded down the West
coast of Scotland and headed for Spain
to carry home the tidings of their great
achievements. The elements continued
to hamper our operations, though
brilliant assaults were conducted by
our landing parties against the kernes
of Ireland. Of the 130 vessels which
set sail from Cadiz, only fifty, it is true,
arrived safely back in that port, but
it is generally felt that the expedition
has, on the whole, been a magnificent
success, and all the 10,000 of our
mariners who returned from the hum-
bling of England have been decorated
by His Most Christian MAJESTY with
tin crosses of the ancient order of the
Santissima Trinidad.”

THE GREAT GAME.
THE back pew was a high square
one just by the stove that warmed the
church. The Uncle always sat in the
front seat because it had arms to hold
him up. The Aunt always had a head-
ache on Sunday morning unless there
were visitors. The family was always
very nice about Aunt's Sunday morning
headaches, though she never allowed
Uncle to have one, which, Margaret
said, showed a selfish disposition.
We liked the pew when the prayers
were over and Inspector Barton had
sung his part in the anthem and slipped
out to see there was no drinking in the
“Rising Sun.” Then the Uncle looked
round, shook his fist at T T –
us and settled himself
for the sermon. It is
queer that the Uncle
could hear in his sleep,
because always after
the sermon he turned
to us and said that if
we didn't behave better
he would have to take
steps. And he always
shook the Rector by the
hand and said, “Ex-
cellent—excellent,” so
he must have heard
the sermon. Yet Ralph
said that he couldn't
hear very well because
when Philipputachest-
nut on the stove and it
went “pop” very loud,
the Uncle jumped in
his seat and said, “Ah-
men.”

gan Margaret put her
hassock on the seat and |-
sat up to choose her

would score “cousins on a visit,” there

Uncle almost woke. It was a very
equal game. Philip's families weren't
more than four marks ahead, and if
only influenza got into them we others
stood a good chance.
Then one Sunday morning Ralph's
families turned up to the very last baby.
The next Sunday it was the same.
Ralph got twenty-two marks ahead,
and would scheme in church how he
would spend our money; which was
breaking the Sabbath.

on with your education,” he said.
“All of you write down these words:
‘family,’ “regular,' ‘attendance,’
‘death.’” Then he picked up the
papers and said, “You all spell out-
rageously, but Ralph is the only one
who spells ‘regular' 'regelar.' What

THE PROFESSIONAL.
WE are all death on flies in our
family. We grudge no effort, and none
of us (except father) grudges a little
casual damage to the furniture; but
when it comes to results there is no
competing with Richard. He is a
born swatter. His attitude is that of
a professional towards clumsy ama-
teurs. We others swat, in our blun-
dering fashion, with napkins, knives,
handkerchiefs, forks, table-cloths and
so forth, but Richard swats with his
head. I do not mean that he kills
flies by butting at them like a goat;
I merely mean that he uses his brains.
He lays his plans and watches us with
a tolerant boredom while we flick and
thump and prod, and in due time very
coolly and dispassionately he swats
his fly.
I fancy that Richard's success is
chiefly due to his masterly air of de-
tachment. The fly, accustomed to the
clamour of our furious onslaughts, soon
comes to associate danger with noise
and fuss. It thinks that when quiet is
restored the enemy has accepted defeat,
and it does a triumphant buzz round
the ceiling. And then Richard gets it.
He never moves from his corner, but
his immobility makes him all the more
deadly. His method is to spin a web
and sit in the middle of it. It sounds
ridiculously simple, but then everything
is simple when you know how to do it.
And Richard, as I have already men-
tioned, is a professional.
“The Melbourne Steamship Co.'s steamer
Melbourne is due here to-day, with 7000 cases

“The meeting of the citizens of Vernon
records its inflexible determination to continue

them, no doubt.

A LONELY SUBALTERN.
I ADJUSTED my puttee carefully, slid back into my chair,
and forced a smile. Then I caught sight of myself in a
mirror and ceased smiling.
“I don't understand it,” I said. “Before the War,
Daphne, just before, you almost led me to believe I had a
chance. Twice I was on the verge of proposing.”
Daphne looked interested. “When was that 2 " she
asked.
“At the Somers' dance. The first time my nerve gave
way. The second time something stuck in my throat.”
“Oh, was it at supper ?”
“Not at all,” I replied shortly.
stuck in my throat.”
Daphne played with a cushion. “I’m awfully sorry,
Dick.” -
“That may be,” I replied coldly. “That may be, but it
in no way eases the situation. Daphne, what is it?” I
looked myself up and down. “Of course I'm a little
bulky,” I sighed.
“It isn't that.” -
“It can't be money,” I said. “If my bank pass book is
to be believed, I saved £49s. 3d. last month.”
Daphne shook her head. “It isn't money.”
I became cynical. “Perhaps if I were home wounded,

“Dick, don't be mean.” -
“Daphne,” I said, “I am disappointed in you. At much
personal discomfort I have proposed, and your refusal is
unaccompanied by any reason.” I rose and stood erect.
“To-night Lonely Subaltern asks young lady to corre-
spond." - -
“Oh, Dick, not really.”
I waited for her to finish laughing.
“Buy to-morrow's Times,” I replied. -
Donning my cap I took a look round the room, obviously
a last long look, turned to the right, saluted smartly,
paused, then hurried out.
From Daphne's chair came sounds of either tears or
laughter.
“It was the words that
For a week I languished, and it was just as I was on the
point of writing Daphne a firm note that her letter came.
“Dear Dick,” she wrote, “when can you come to tea 2"
I replied in person. I greeted her courteously but doubt-
fully, leaving it to her to explain the situation. -
“Dick,” she said, “have you had many replies to your
advertisement 2 " ..
“Advertisement 2 What—oh–er—yes, of course. No,
I haven't had ‘many.’”
“You haven't had any from a girl called Dora 2"
“No, not exactly.”
“Not exactly 2”
“No, you see I didn't advertise after all.”
“Didn't advertise 2" -
Daphne went very white, then red, and then white.
“Oh, heavens,” she whispered.
I got up quickly. “Daphne,” I said, “you are not well.
Lean on me."
“I’m all right, thanks,” she said faintly. “But, Dick, I
really have done it.” - -
“How 2 '' . -
“Don’t you see 2 I answered your advertisement in
The Times—Lonely Subaltern.”
“But I sent in no advertisement.”
“Yes, but you told me you were going to.”
“Well, I didn't do it.”
“Then somebody else did.”
“And you answered it 2"
Daphne nodded.
“Thinking it was my advertisement?”
She nodded again.
“Daphne,” I said, “this is a serious business—most
serious. Has there been much correspondence?”
She gave a little laugh.
“Has there been much correspondence?” I repeated.
“Not very much from him,” she said. “I’ve written a
lot. He only sent two short notes typewritten, the last
one saying he was soon off to the Front. Er—that's why
I asked you to tea.” -
“Daphne,” I inquired, “what did you write?”
Daphne hesitated. “Oh, a lot. You see I thought it
was you, Dick,” she said. “You signed yourself, ‘Lonely
Subaltern.’”
“You must please leave me out of this,” I replied coldly.
“Well, what am I to do about it 2."
There was a silence. Then, “I’ll do it,” I said.
“Do what ?”
“Get you out of this mess,” I replied. “There is only
one explanation that can excuse you in this man's eyes
for your apparent trifling with his affections. It is quite
normal, Daphne, for a girl to keep two men in suspense
while she's making up her mind. Very well, I am one;
Lonely Subaltern is the other; and I am going to make
it easy for you to explain why he may regard himself as
no longer in suspense. I am going to propose.”
“Oh, Dick.”
“It's your only chance.”
There was an awkward pause in the dialogue, in which
I swallowed convulsively. “Daphne,” I began. “Daphne,”
I continued. “Daphne,” I finished rather lamely. -
I have made better proposals of course, but, considerin
the circumstances, I thought I did well. Anyhow the
result was most encouraging.

PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HIGH-WATER MARK.
A SMALL difficulty of some military
importance has arisen at “Sunnyside,”
and we don't quite know what ought
to be done about it. So if anyone who
reads this has a cousin at the War
Office—well . . .
Yesterday Bob arrived straight from
Armageddon.
His two “Mothers,” so he informs
us, are languishing under the eye of a
reckless and totally undependable gun-
crank—to wit, his Major. Therefore
his leave is strictly limited, as at any
moment the Major may be tempted to
foolhardy experiment, and—well, Bob
says three days is all he dare take.
This is just to let you know that
Bob is a person who is acquainted
with crumps, pip-squeaks, and other
nerve-racking instruments of war, and
by the same token is not a bad judge
of the matter.
The matter—something the matter
—began nearly two years ago. I went
to a doctor, who thought it was the
result of overwork—until he came to
know me better. Then he abandoned
the case, his temper permanently
Soured. So I went to another man,
who said it was caused through lack of
occupation. I abandoned him. After
that I went to manifold other doctors,
and at last, one bright morning in
Welbeck Street, I was told to have my
teeth out—all of them. I liked this
chap. There was something definite
about him. I went home and counted
my teeth—twenty-seven of them.
The programme read: “One ex-
traction weekly.” Twenty-seven ap-
pointments with the dentist
It was an epic of dentistry, slightly
vulgarised by the term “weekly.” I
corrected this to “third Tuesday in the
month,” thus transforming the affair
into a genuine Odyssey. I then wrote
a short note about appointment No. 1.
All this was in the beginning. I
hardly knew my dentist in those days.
Now I call him Charlie.
Month after month we (including
the anaesthetist) gathered round the
same old chair and spoke of all our
sorrows and our joys. Soon after the
right upper wisdom disappeared Charlie
married. Then the anaesthetist died,
poor chap. That was early in 1914,
before the second bicuspid vanished.
Then Charlie had twins, and in his
excitement nearly took out a couple of
incisors instead of one. Then the War
broke out . . . I was still at it.
Then the new anaesthetist grew a
military moustache—tooth-brush brand
I was still at it.

contemporaries in strange uniforms

was more than flesh could bear, so,
throwing aside all caution, I made a
final sprint and had the insignificant
remainder—three molars—extracted at
one sitting.
The rest, of course, was simple. It
was only a matter of weeks. I merely
had to sit still and consider patterns of
green-grey material suitable for wear
in the local brigade of “Frosty-Tops.”
That was some time ago, and—well, it
wasn't my teeth after all. We never
talk about teeth now, at least we didn't
until last night. As I have mentioned,
Bob arrived yesterday, so Joe and I, a
thoroughly selfish couple, arranged a
feast, to which we decided to invite our
three selves only. Joe wrote the menu
in Flemish and I shook up the old
Australian port. Nothing was forgotten,
and, when the time came, we sat down
to pump Bob of all the latest scandals
from G.H.Q. . . . Should any reader
wish to know whether things are going
well in Flanders, the answer is in the
affirmative.

Urchin. “‘READY FoR ANYFINK,' SIR.”
Over the barcelonas we raised a tidy
little breeze on the subject of courage.
Joe and I were all for something be-
tween the trenches — ours and the
Huns'. Some desperate deed such as
we should hear of daily if the Censor
were not so antagonistic to person-
alities. Bob entirely disagreed. -
“War,” he maintained, “is a sociable
and entertaining form of enervation,
punctuated with moments of breathless
exhilaration.” He admitted that there
were occasions when courage was really
necessary, viz.:-
(1) Leaving your guns in the hands
of Majors and other senior officers.
(2) Undergoing a prolonged exhor.
tation on tactics from the Brigadier.
(3) Eating marmalade by moonlight
during the wasp season.
(4) Borrowing another chap's mouth-
organ—and playing it.
“That sort of thing,” he continued,
“does need a bit of pluck, but the
actual fighting . . .” He cracked a
nut scornfully.
“Well,” I ventured, “what is your
idea of the best example of physical
courage 2"
He did not hesitate a moment.
“Having a tooth out,” he replied
tersely.
Just that. “Having a tooth out.”
I haven't quite decided what I am
going to do about it.
I did think of the V.C., but Joe has
persuaded me to wait until they make
a more distinctive award for the highest
form of valour.

Whom, with saucy face oblique,

With epithets in winding bout
Of clotted nonsense long drawn out,
Such as men may fancy witty

By kindred taste and fancy led,
And dim his eyes with thankful tears,
Beholding our resemblant ears!

SHE TELLs You THAT, BUT SHE HUGS ME.'
THE APPRO. WEEK.
This is what it said in the advertise-
ment: “On appro., one week willingly."
As Ursula observed, “They simply
must be honest to put that in " So I
answered the advertisement; and on
the next day he arrived.
He came by railway delivery, attached
to the railway deliverer by a rusty chain
and a friendship that seemed to have
been established on the journey from
the station. He had a white coat of the
variety known as wire-haired; a tousled
black-and-tan head, from which looked
out the most pathetically melting eyes
imaginable; and his name recalled the
finest traditions of literature and art.
It was Toby.
He appeared to take to the place at
once; and indeed to be almost cheerful,
hand with a supply of soothing con-
versation. But you would hardly credit
the extent to which the wistful pathos
in his eyes deepened at the smallest
suggestion of being left alone. His
passion for sitting upon laps seemed
also extraordinary in one whose short
life had been spent wholly (so I under-
stood) in the monastic society of a
stable. There was no dislodging him.
Did his supporter for the moment rise,
in two seconds Toby would impose him-
self upon the other, give an exploratory
turn or so, and with a little contented
sigh compose his countenance to sleep.
It was flattering, of course, but it had
its drawbacks.
When one day of the week had gone
we were still undecided. To appro. or
not to appro. Both Ursula and I were
already more than a little in love with
Toby, but his profound melancholy
militated undeniably against his success
as a boon companion. Neither sticks,
bones nor the suggestion of mythical
cats could raise him from this apparent
depression.
“Don't you suppose he knows any
games?” asked Ursula.
One active interest in life he had,
and only one; but this was constant.
“Did they say anything about—them
in the letter ?” asked Ursula.
“The person who wrote it said that
he had never seen him scratch,” I
replied.
so long as one or other of us was at
“He must,” said Ursula thoughtfully,
“have been a singularly unobservant
man.”
Still we hesitated. A point on the
credit side was that there was no
difficulty in making him follow; rather
the other way.
On the fourth aſternoon of his visit
Ursula and I were both engaged to tea
with the new Rectoress. We thought
to have solved the problem of Toby by
locking him in the potting-shed. The
Rectory stands at the remote end of
the village, about half a mile distant
from our home. One recalled after-
wards, of course, that the window of
the potting-shed had incautiously been
left ajar; but how the faithful animal
traced us to the Rectory and actually
forced an entrance to the drawing-room
was another matter. Somewhere on
the journey he must have encountered
a pond of green slime . The Rector
himself was exceedingly nice about it,
and related several appropriate anec-
dotes from The Spectator; but it cannot
be pretended that Toby added to the
success of the visit. We returned home
with the balance of popular opinion in
favour of rejection.
And that night Toby sickened.
Whether it was that green slime had
been inimical to his constitution, or
for whatever reason, the fact remains
that our probationer became mani-
festly unwell. His eyes grew dull, his
nose hot, and the little tousled head
clearly ached, with such reluctance was
it lifted from the human arm (Ursula's)
into which it had trustfully nestled.
His host and hostess regarded him and
each other with some anxiety, mingled
perhaps, on my part, with a little irri-
tation.
“That settles it,” I said. “We’ve
had the dog four days, and he's been
one perpetual bother. Directly he's
able to travel, he goes.”
“Ye-es,” said Ursula.
We made up an emergency bed with
a basket and some rugs before the
kitchen fire; and Toby lay in it, more
pathetic than ever, with a last fond fare-

“Seems a bit more lively now,” com-

Ursula looked up, and our eyes met.
“No,” I said firmly, with the air of
one who clings to an unalterable reso-

A SURPRISE VISIT.
“You must see the Camp Quarter-
master's store.” The voice was the
voice of our Commandant and I was
the Camp Quartermaster. The person
addressed I guessed to be the General,
who was paying us a surprise visit. In
our camps we are prepared for any
emergency and, curiously enough, the
whole camp had that morning been
scrubbed and cleaned in case anything
like an unexpected visit from the
covered things in time. -
“I hope,” she added, “that
you will write pretty sharply
about it to the advertisement
people.”
Two more days went by, while
we heard nothing of the invalid.
The week was now in its last
hours. Something had to be
done, and immediately. In the
unlikely event of its being pos-
sible, there was Toby's return
journey to be arranged. “I shall
drive in to-morrow,” I said, “and
settle the matter.”
“I might as well come too,”
said Ursula.
So in the morning we started—
I with the rusty chain in my coat
pocket. I had already looked up
times, and decided that Toby was
to catch the noon express from
the junction. “Of course,” said
Ursula timidly, “one wouldn't
want him to run any risks or be
unhappy on the journey.”
“Ursula,” I reproved her, “I
have no intention of being brutal,
but that dog would be unhappy
anywhere. He revels in it.”
At the locum's, however, a sur-
prise awaited us.
“Of course he's able to travel,”
declared Toby's medical adviser
briskly. “He's as fit as a fiddle !

down my pen, rose from my chair

forthwith removed one foot from

up with the bunch of bananas

in order to give an artistic Oriental
appearance to the store.
“You would hardly think that
this gentleman is a distinguished
writer,” said our Commandant,
meaning me. The look of frank
incredulity on the face of the
General, if somewhat offensive,
was thoroughly justified, as of
course I am not a distinguished

loyalty to our Commandant I en-

to be the air of a distinguished writer,
though I was considerably handicapped
by still having one foot on my cap and
my face in the bunch of bananas.

ladies.

his head in one of those long sticky
things which are known as “fly ceme-
teries” and are to be found hanging in
every self-respecting store. In spite of
the fact that we all worked our hardest,
the process of disentangling him took
time, as fly cemeteries are elusive things
and as soon as we got one end off one
ear the other end adhered to his other
ear. -
“So this is your store,” said the
General's wife, who was the first to re-
cover. “What's the price of potatoes?”
I had expected this, and in anticipation
of the General's visit (I mean in view
of the possibility of a visit from the
General) I had learnt the price of every
kind of potato that had ever been
raised. The making or marring of a
Quartermaster depends on whether or
not he can tell the General the price of
potatoes. I could have given the right
answer at any moment up to the time
of his becoming involved with the fly
cemetery, but now it had vanished
from me like a Zeppelin in the night.
“Potatoes—yes, of course these are
potatoes,” I said, and endeavoured to
change the conversation by treading on
a pot of jam, “and this is jam, as you
see by the pips x - -
“What's the price of potatoes?”
rudely interrupted the General, whose
temper was slightly ruffled by the
number of semi-defunct flies which
still adhered to his scalp.
“It depends whether you mean
London potatoes or Country potatoes,
Sir, because, of course, you can get
potatoes in the country as well as in
London. Personally I prefer the Lon-
don variety. This potato (I picked one
out of the sack) is a Londoner; the
country kind are similar in shape but
of course cleaner. I have had some
country ones here and, as a matter of
fact, kept one to show you in case you
came down, but it died yesterday and
we had to cook it. I don't remember
exactly what I paid for this particular
potato; you see I’ve had to buy several
and they're difficult to identify and the
price varies according to the market
value.
civilian doesn't pay sufficient attention
to the price of potatoes, but in Ger-
many things are different; that's why
we get so many conflicting reports.
I've read as many as two absolutely
contradictory accounts of the German
potato crop in the same paper. Accord-
ing to one account the last potato in
Germany had been destroyed by an air
raid; according to the other potatoes
were so plentiful that they weren't
worth picking and were simply rotting
on the trees.”

Providentially the General at this
moment became involved in another
fly cemetery and while we unglued him
I remembered the price of potatoes.
“You know, Sir, of course,” I said,
“that the present price of potatoes in
the London market is six shillings per
cwt., and sixpence more in the country.
Yes, that is tinned milk; fresh milk is
sold only in the towns. I buy my

HOLIDAY'S END.
(After six days' leave in the North.)
For three long days of white and gold and blue
(And three of driving wind and driven rain),
For wonder of the misty dawns that grew
Clear, as the dayshine followed in their train,_
For all the pleasuring that yours and you
Provided, Thomas, take my thanks again.
Now—Franceward bound once more—I look again
To where your hill slides into far-off blue
Behind me; and the rattle of the train
Can't drown the fairy-songs I hear, that grew
Out of the clouds, out of the falling rain—
Songs of a land I leave, alas! with you.
And for to-morrow? Oh, my Thomas, you
Will climb the stony southern beat again
To Corriecharbie; and across the blue
The driven birds will come, a straggling train;
And at the clearing where the rowans grew
You'll wait for lunch, and sniff the coming rain . .
Or, if the river's up with last night's rain,
That twenty-pounder's lying by for you—
The wary one I played and lost again
Down at the Falls; and shall you try that “Blue
Doctor” we tied on Sunday—left to train
On for a little, “till his feathers grew "?
Ah, when the fishing wind set fair, and grew
From south to south-west with a hint of rain,
All day we stayed there till our hands were blue
And the long line ran out and out again.
This—poor Unfit One—this remains to you;
To me, the flying shadow of the train. , .
Yet later, when the southward-swinging train
Crosses the Border—where our friendship grew
And ripened—and the scent of English rain
Blows through an English night, I think of you
Cheerfully; I am Sassenach again -
As the last stars go down in misty blue.

UNWRITTEN LETTERs TO THE KAISER.
No. XXVI.
(From CHARLEs PEACE, Esq., J.P.)
I CAN see your Majesty's startled look when your Imperial
eye falls upon my signature at the end of this letter.
“How in thunder,” you will say to yourself, “does a man
with such a name as that dare to address himself to me at
such a moment as this? Is it done by way of a joke? In
that case I would have him know that a German Emperor
does not care for jokes, except when he makes them
himself; " and you will throw the letter down and trample
on it with just that same silly petulance that caused you
to make this War and plunge nearly all the world into
bloodshed and destruction. -
However, I may as well ease your mind at once. There's
no joke about my name. It really is “Peace” and always
has been since I can remember anything, and I'm not
writing in order to tease you or pull your leg, or to do any
of those things of which a high and mighty Emperor
naturally disapproves. Quite the contrary. My object in
writing to you is to tell you that I have a certain admira-
tion for you. I realise that that is a queer thing for an
Englishman to say, and I don't want you to do what
you've so often done before in other matters, namely, to
draw erroneous conclusions. So I'll explain what I mean
without any more beating about the bush.
Sir, I had a grandfather—indeed, like the rest of us, I
had two, but only one of them stamped his name upon the
age and is worthy of public remembrance. That one was
my paternal grandfather, whose name, like my own, was
CHARLEs PEACE. You'll ask what he was. Well, I'll tell
you in strict confidence, for, after all, one doesn't like the
frailties of one's ancestors to become the subject of malevo-
lent public gossip. CHARLIE PEACE was a burglar and a
murderer who flourished some forty years ago. Many men
have been burglars and some have been assassins, but my
grandfather had special and peculiar merits. He was an
amateur of the violin and used to delight his landladies and
their visitors by playing popular selections to them of an
evening before going out on business in the neighbourhood.
Moreover, he had a marked taste for our dramatic poets,
especially for SHAKSPEARE, passages from whose immortal
works he used to read in schools by arrangement with their
headmasters. His greatest effort in this line, I am told,
was the Gravediggers' scene from Hamlet. Altogether he
was a most ingenious and versatile gentleman, devoted to the
arts during the time that he spared from the cracking of
cribs and the shooting of policemen. Finally, however, the
law got the better of him. All this was a great blow to my
poor father, who was doing a good and honest business of
his own in the North of England, and for a time we had
to forget my grandfather; but as the years passed on and
money began to accumulate, we could afford to remember
him sometimes; and now, I protest, we're rather proud of
him, just as many a Border family used to be proud of an
ancestor who had been hanged at Carlisle for sheep-stealing.
So it is possible that some future generation of men may
speak with less horror than the present of yourself and
your deeds. To be sure you have killed millions where
grandfather accounted for only one or two. He rifled a few
"|houses; you have laid whole provinces waste, and being
under a solemn pledge to guard a country, you entered it
like a thief in the night, destroyed its inhabitants and
trampled its liberties underfoot. Yes, you're a bigger man
in the realms of crime than ever CHARLEs PEACE, my grand-
father, was, but what with your dabblings in music and
painting and drama, you're not unlike him in the make-up
of your character, and if I happened to want a grandfather
of the real C.P. brand, I think I should know where to look
for one. That's what I wanted to tell you, and now that
I've told it my mind is easier. But please do not let this
unstudied tribute of admiration go beyond yourself.
Yours, CHARLEs PEACE.

THE GARDEN ON THE SANDS.
SHE made a lovely garden,
Its moated waters welled,
And all the brakes of Arden
Held not the peace it held;
No shadow swept the bower
That rose on sea-smoothed sands
Save, as she set each flower,
The shadow of her hands.
Herein were paths enchanted
With coloured sand inlaid,
And purple knapweed planted
In many a pleasant glade;
Parterres with grave devotion
She laboured to adorn
With cockles from the ocean
And cockles from the corn.
Then lo! the crowning wonder,
A flower that bent and swung
To filmy wings' faint thunder
And legs that clasped and clung;
And proud blue eyes grow wider
And cheeks a rosier hue—
Real bees at work beside her
And make-believe come true !
A MOULD OF FORM.
IT has been said that everybody is
afraid of some one. Equally true is it
that everybody envies some one. Mr.
RocKEFELLER, for example, probably
envies some poor man with a digestion,
hair on his head and no Standard Oil
troubles—a tramp even. Mr. CARNEGIE,
it is possible, envies a young Scotch
boy beginning life with half-a-crown in
his pocket. And so with the rest of us
—each has his hero.
The man who, at the moment, I feel
to be most admirable and remote
from myself—and this remoteness is
of course of the essence of envy—is
my acquaintance, X.
I had always felt that X had worthy
qualities of distinction, engaging touches
of superiority and aloofness, but not
until we were seated on an omnibus in
the high wind of last week did I realise
how splendid he could be and long for
similar gifts.
We had just come from Blank's, X's
hatter, where he had acquired a beau-
tiful soft hat, which he was wearing,
and we were on our way regally on
the front seat of a Dreadnought bus
to South Kensington Museum, where
we were bent on examining a branch
of applied art.
The wind, you will remember, came
furiously in gusts, and one of these
removed from X's head his becoming
new purchase and sent it spinning
into the road. Uttering a brief word
designed to meet, although not to ex-
haust, the requirements of such occur-

rences, he rang the bell and descended
from the bus. I followed.
So far he had done no more than
anyone else—you or I—would do; but
no sooner had he safely landed than
he put up his stick to a passing taxi
and bade the driver take us back to
Blank's.
In the distance I could see officious
persons closing in on the fugitive; but
X's eyes did not stray in their direction.
A very few moments brought us to a
part of the road where, as we passed,
an excited man was in the act of brush-
ing X's hat preparatory to finding its
owner and returning it to him.
I drew X's attention to this Good
Samaritan, and it was then that he
seemed to me to rise inches above the
common stature.
“Let's get on to Blank's quickly,”
he said.
“Further communications from Berlin are
expected to advance negotiations to the point
where attacks on ship-carrying passengers will
be definitely discontinued, at least while the
subject is under further discussion.”

Still, in view of the vagueness of this
Goncession, it would be wise for the
intending traveller not to include the
Mauretania in his personal baggage.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BACK.
MILLIONs of stout Germans buzzed
annoyingly about, flicking at me as
they passed with absurd toy bayonets,
and puffing from rounded cheeks their
nasty gases, which spread in great
balloons like the conversations in Mr.
HASELDEN's Daily Mirror pictures.
Then an angel—no, it must have been
a goddess—appeared and drove them
away with a wave of her arm, quite
like the old times, you know, HECTOR
and Troy and all that. I began to
wonder which she was; Hera—I hoped
not Hera, I always hated her so; or
Athena—I shouldn't mind Athena; or
perhaps Aphrodite: yes, I think Aphro-
dite on the whole, please. When the
last German had quite gone she came
towards me—so she hadn't forgotten
how to do it after all these years, you
see; having rescued her favourite, she
would speak to him words of advice
and encouragement. How splendid!
She touched me lightly on the
shoulder. “Breakfast,” she said. Then
she materialised a little, but only just
a little. Her robes became the sober
grey dress and little scarlet cloak that
soldiers know and bless. “Breakfast,”
she said again. “We’re in.”
She turned away to the next cot.
Breakfast indeed! Good Heavens, who
wants breakfast 2 We're in.
A doubt assailed me ; the goddess
had gone and I looked uneasily round
for the gas-blowing Germans, craning
to see under the cot. It's just the
mean trick they would do to hide
underneath and blow their nasty stuff
from there. I craned as far as my
miserable arm would let me till a
gentle bump of the boat nearly shot
me out. But it settled the matter.
We are in, and that's Southampton
pier we're bumping against.
The goddess returned. “Come, you
must eat your breakfast, you know.”
Even goddesses are a nuisance at
times. “And then you shall have a
paper; it's just come.”
“But Aphr . . . Sister, I can't eat
this mess.”
She coaxed a little, but finally gave
111. -
“Well, at any rate drink this, and
then I'll leave you in peace to your
paper.”
I drank “this ’’ and she went. I was
quite awake now, but I didn't want to
read ; I just lay and listened to them
getting the gangways out; it was a
jolly sound.
Presently a man in the far corner
said there was a big casualty list in.
Everyone takes a morbid interest in
casualty lists, so I opened my paper to
look at it. It was a penny paper, and
simply enormous; you know what they
seem like when you're ill. I turned
page after page; a trench was stormed
and recaptured, stormed and recaptured,
stormed and recaptured. In the money
markets tin shouted that it was buoyant
with a persistency that was simply
revolting. What business had tin to
be buoyant just then 2
At last I came upon the “Fallen
Officers” notices. I ran my eye down
—one or two of the men I had known ;
presently the name of 2nd Lieutenant
John Sevastopol... Hello! that's famil-
iar; Sevastopol is a name that has lain
heavy on the boys of our family ever
since an enthusiastic little lady bore a
son and lost a husband in the winter
of '55. Forsyth, 2nd Battalion, the
W . By Jove, it is. John Sevas-
topol Forsyth. I chuckled quietly; it
really was rather funny. I wondered
what people I knew would say about
me at breakfast that morning. With
the porridge perhaps, how sad it was all
these youngsters getting killed off like
this; over the bacon they might recall
my good points and say what a promis-
ing boy I'd always been ; by the mar-
malade they'd wish they'd been nicer
to me—I am so glad they weren't.
I was still chuckling when an
R.A.M.C. Major came round, decorating
each as he passed with a label. On
me he pinned the word “Ipswich.” I
read it and groaned. “Major,” I said,
“this is too much. Here am I, a bright
and promising young officer, who has
just died for his country, and you send
me home and bury me at Ipswich.
Ipswich of all places, I'll trouble you.”
The Major was adamant. “Sorry,”
he said, “but you'll have to take your
chance; you can't all go to London.”
I fired my last shot. When you
really want anything out of a Major
you call him Sir; it's like calling a
policeman Sergeant, you know; makes
him feel as if he'd got his command
by brevet. “But, Sir,” I began, and
then I explained exactly why I, at any
rate, must go to London. He'd only
just got his majority and was still
human. “Very well,” he said at last;
“but don't go talking about it to every-
body.” So I was redirected to London.
Soon the transporting began, an ex-
hausting process when you are absurdly
conscious of the tenderness of most of
your limbs; and when we were safely
in the train I dozed at once, not to
wake till we reached Waterloo. The
rest was short, an ambulance ride
through London streets, an absolute
dream after the French pavé, and then
the hospital, where beautiful white
walls with rounded corners seemed to
say, “You’ve got to get well here.”
It was perfect, but I wanted one thing
more. Of course they had it—a port-
able one, that I could speak through as
I lay in bed. “Western double-three 0
five.” That wasn't the real number—
this is the part of the story that isn't
true—and I don't know who Western
3305 is, but I hope he'll let me use his
line for a minute. “Western double-
thhrrree 0 five,” answered an austere
voice. A pause. “Hello!” I recog-
nised the voice, it was the one I wanted,
but it didn't sound quite so merry as
usual. “Hello! ” it said again; “who's
that ?”
“Roughly,” I said, “this is a voice
from the tomb.”
“Speak up.” I spoke up ; even so
there seemed to be some doubt.
“What's your number?” asked the
voice.
So then I began at the beginning.
“I am John Sev"—well, you know
who I am, don't you?—“And I hope
you're not believing this silly story
about my being killed, becau . . .”
“Oh, Johnny' " she began.
Yes, it's good to be back from the
dead.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE ought to be an Ideas Exchange for novelists.
Ideas for stories are always calling at the wrong address.
Probably at this very moment Mr. W. W. JAcobs has just
thought of a splendid plot for a mediaeval romance which
would make Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT scream with joy, while
round the corner Mr. HEWLETT is wishing that he were
able to do something with the magnificent idea for a
Night Watchman yarn that has come to him. If only
there had been some Exchange of this kind in existence,
Miss ELLEN ADA SMITH would have been able to let
Mr. W. B. MAxwell, have the theme of The Despot
(John LoNg). He is the only writer I know who could
have made out of Paul Manderson, the philanthropic but
unscrupulous mad doctor, the big living character which
he ought to be. Miss SMITH has done her best with him,
but has failed for lack of ammunition. Her gentle, rather
rambling style is unequal to Manderson. She is at home
with her less formidable characters, especially when they
happen to be women, but she has not the power and vision
necessary for the delineation of a man whose sole aim in
life is to benefit humanity in the mass, and who in pursuance
of this ambition ruthlessly sacrifices the lives and happiness
of individuals. The Despot falls between two stools. It
has not enough movement for a novel of action, and not
enough detail for a novel of character. The author's attitude
towards Manderson is a question. Was he a supreme
genius or merely a charlatan with hypnotic powers? If
you are interested in Manderson at all, that is the one
thing you want to know about him; and, when you apply
to Miss SMITH for authoritative information, she shrugs
her shoulders and says, “I wonder 1"
To get an idea of the style of Mr. F. HoRAcE Rose's
latest book, Golden Glory (Hodder AND Stoughton), I
suggest that you should imagine Mr. J. C. SNAITH in the
frame of mind which produced Fortune sallying forth to
follow in the footsteps of Sir RIDER HAGGARD in his
Darkest African humour. Such a combination sounds, I
admit, almost too good to be true, and in simple honesty
I hasten to add that both these famous warriors might
fairly feel a little aggrieved at the comparison, for, though
there is twist and thrust enough to remind one of Mr.
SNAITH and battle-shock that might well have been planned
by Sir RIDER, on neither flank is there quite the full
authentic fire; yet, due allowance made, it is fair enough.
Certainly for such a campaign one can hardly imagine a
more conveniently arranged country than Bechuanaland of
a hundred years ago would seem to have been ; for in the
wanderings of Napo the Dwarf, seeker of a vaguely spiritual
glory, and his two stalwart friends, the only important
credentials were a hand ready and a skull thick enough to
meet those occasions of “liveliness” in which they were
every day involved. May I confess that at times I found
these warlike details more than a little involved myself and
had need of a stout enough head to come through safely 2
But that perhaps was natural, since no white man is
allowed to intrude on these pages, a stray keg of gun-
powder being the only exponent of a civilisation against
which Mr. Rose is rather too fond of letting fly sundry
little arrows of criticism. Such an attitude seems to me
not only rather irritating but a bit ungrateful too, seeing

that his book owes a good deal to that climax of many
fascinating wizardries, the production of a real live thunder-
bolt; and without a properly civilised fire-barrel not even
Keshwan, the boaster, could have done that. But this is
not a very serious weakness, and on the whole the story
is certainly one to put on your list.
Mr. J. D. BERESFORD, having long delighted us with his
famous realistic trilogy, has in his latest mood gone off at a
tangent into the frankest conventionalism. It is indeed
possible that he has a little overdone it. I didn't find my-
self quite able to believe in his Arthur Grey, who (scion of
a noble English house, son of a remittance-man father and
an honest Canadian mother,) determines, owing to stout
highbrow notions, never to claim his inheritance, yet comes
over and contrives to be invited as a guest to his ancestral
home, falls inevitably in love with his cousin, Lady Tempe
(quite a nice girl), and ends by taking both her and the
family title and estates, in order to save complications—
idea. If the title was meant for apology it is certainly
undemanded, for the story or stories it covers are excellent
of their kind. I say stories because almost every chapter
is, so to speak, self-contained and semi-detached; indeed, if
they have not made a previous appearance in magazine
form, they might quite easily have done so. The subject
of them is the adventures of a little group of Lithuanian
Jews, newly settled in the United States. Throughout, the
atmosphere is what might be called Potashy; fortunately
perhaps a recent theatrical success has endeared this kind
of thing to the public heart. Chief among the characters
is one Lapidowitz, a Schnorrer. Perhaps you know already
what a Schnorrer is ? The author here defines it as one
who lives by his wits, or (one might add) the lack of them
in others. This Lapidowitz is a great man. One of the
tales tells of the little list he keeps of touchable friends,
and the method by which Fate and the widow Lubin
frustrated his plans of extracting ten dollars from the chief
of them. Lapidowitz indeed seems seldom to have been
which Mr. BERESFORD,
rather perversely, as it
seems to me, has himself
invented. By the way,
he will find, l think, if
he looks up his peerage,
that he has deprived the
Marquis of Cheshire's son
of his courtesy title; and
that is a very terrible
mistake to make in the
eyes of the higher pat-
rons of the circulating
libraries, though I my-
self might be disposed to
agree with him that it
didn't much matter. It
is quite likely that The
Mountains of the Moon
(CASSELL) will find new
readers for Mr. BERES-
FoRD on the strength of
a deservedly high reputa-
tion acquired in another
and more excellent way.

Green Eyes (HopDER AND SToUGHTON), by Miss EGERTON
JoNEs, introduces us to yet another Ruritania. But I think
that Asgaarde (the name given by Miss EGERTON. Jones to
the little Kingdom of her fancy) was created only because
she wanted a real blood-royal hero. The main scenes of
her book are laid in Australia, where the heir to the throne
of Asgaarde was travelling incognito and fell in love with
the lady of the verdant optic. Asgaarde in the end becomes
“practically a Montenegrin province,” but I am glad to say
—for it would be tactless to cast reflections upon one of our
Allies—that she does not leave me scandalised by the way
in which it was annexed. This is apparently a first novel,
and it is perhaps a little too sentimental and too gushing.
But it is written with the enthusiasm and verve of youth,
and the presence of those qualities in its pages makes me
readier to commend than to condemn.

FURTHER CONCESSIONS.
(To be outlined in the next German note.)
IN future it is understood that the Imperial Government
will (wherever this is possible and not highly inconvenient
to the operations of German war vessels) allow an interval
of twenty minutes for the repentance and self-preparation
of American citizens before the destruction by torpedo or
otherwise of any first-class liner.
This concession must be understood to be only available
when and where the following conditions are rigorously
observed :—
(1) On first sighting a hostile submarine the passenger
steamer must at once communicate by wireless the names
and addresses of all Americans and Englishmen passengers.
These persons must be collected into two separate open
boats, and the boats labelled “Wilson" and “Grey” re-
spectively. Also the exact amount of munitions of war
concealed as personal luggage must be notified.
(2) On being missed by a shell or torpedo discharged by
a German submarine, any liner must instantly signal to the
submarine concerned, “I apologise. Please try again—a
little more to the right (or left, as the case may be).”
(3) On finding his vessel within attacking distance of
any German submarine, but unobserved by the latter, the
commanding officer of any liner shall instantly signal her
name and exact latitude, with the words, “Here we are.
Please send torpedo; or shall we blow ourselves up 2"
(4) On receiving no answer any such commanding officer
shall instantly order all English passengers into open boats,
which shall convey them within range of the aforesaid sub-
marine. In case it cannot be found, such boats must be
left on the high seas, labelled “Englishman—To be left till
called for.”
(5) Any such liner or passenger steamer as aforesaid,
when torpedoed and sinking, shall order all remaining
passengers on deck, and go down with band playing Die
Wacht am Rheim. -
(6) Any liner or passenger steamer as above practising
evasive tactics, such as-
(a) Continuing its voyage without communication or
apology as above; - -
(b) Dodging, or attempting to dodge or evade, any Ger-
- man torpedo discharged with intent to destroy it,
shall be considered a legitimate object for destruction.
(7) Any English or other belligerents detected in the
action of looking for, scanning or observing any German
submarine occupied in the execution of its duty shall be
shot as spies. - - -

8 A.M.–Inspected Officers' equipment. Officers did not
come to attention at once on my appearance, so gave
whole lot two hours' pack drill. Put two men back to
clean their binoculars.
Orderly Room, 9 A.M.–Adjutant before me for omitting
to salute Lance-Corporal Smith. Awarded fourteen
hours' fatigue.
9.30 A.M.–Took Platoon-Commanders in squad drill.
Hopelessly stupid lot. Their formation of fours
ludicrous. No notion whatever of difference between
their right and left. Put entire squad back for further
instruction in recruit drill.
11 A.M.–Parade of Company Commanders. Gave them
“For inspection—Port Canes.” Several canes not
sufficiently polished; my own Company Commander's
particularly rusty in the nob. Gave him three days'
C.B. That should teach him.
Continued trouble with Colonel. Spoke to him
several times about his manner towards me. Any-
body would think sometimes, from Colonel's attitude,
that he was at least my equal in rank. His tunic
buttons, too, a disgrace to the battalion. Tell him
that I really cannot tolerate these slovenly practices.
His plea that he has not sufficient time for cleaning
tunic, etc., I reject forthwith. Tell him to rise earlier;
every Colonel should be up by 5.30. Stop all his leave
for a month.
12 Noon.—Gross impertinence on part of Brigadier. Have
had to tell him off several times on account of his
habit of making cynical remarks on the subject of my
alleged ignorance of the drill-book. Think I have
taught him lesson, however, and that he will be more
careful in the future.

Private could want. What did they expect 2 A chef

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
X.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-If the KAISER
still nursed any mistaken ideas that we
English are at all down-hearted about
the War, he should have paid a visit to
our Fort on the anniversary of the
Declaration of War. He would soon
have seen enough to convince him that
the British Empire has still plenty of
kick left in it. --
We played a comic foot-|
ball match with twenty-
two a side, the players
being lashed together in
pairs as in a three-legged
race. |.
It was a good match,
though hampered by the
eccentric behaviour of the
referee, one half of whom
persisted in signalling such
commands as “Retire” and
“Close on the centre" every
time he heard the whistle
blown by the other half—
commands which a year's
military discipline caused
the men to obey mechani-
cally. This brought about
confused conditions unpro-
vided for in the Rules of
Football. Later, when the
decision of the referee was
required in a little matter of
handling in the penalty
area, he was discovered
sitting at the other end of
the ground peacefully play-
ing cards with himself. The
cards were confiscated, but
shortly afterwards herubbed
down one of the goal-posts
and was ejected from the
field of play shouting, “Gott
strafe Prickly Heat l” with
passionate intensity.
In the evening we held
singing and speech-making
competitions, and — our
greatest effort—a beauty
show. The prize for beauty"
was voted by acclamation to a resource-
ful Private made up as an English flap-
per. His skirt, it must be admitted,
was improvised from an Army sheet
and his luxuriant locks from coir pur-
loined from an army bed (so-called).
But anything remotely resembling an
English girl now knocks us clean off
our balance, and there was never any
question of his success.
The stump speeches were not models
of eloquence, thus proving once more
that soldiers are men of action, not
words. The prize-winner was given
the subject “India” on which to deliver
an address. “India,” he said nervously,
worst, unhealthiest and most dangerous
“India—er—um–India, well, India is
a hell of a place and I shall be
thundering glad to get out of it.”
He was deservedly cheered to the
echo.
I fear, Mr. Punch, that our health is
causing the authorities grave misgiv-
ings. Ever since we landed in India we
have been constantly told that the Fort
which we are now garrisoning is the
Old Dame. “You’ve HAD Two PENN'oRTH of swi:ETs, MY LITTLE
MAN, BUT You've oNLY GIVEN ME A PENNY.”
The Little Man. “YEs, BUT FARVER SAYs on E PENNY's Got To
Do THE WORK OF Two IN WAR-TIME.”
hot-weather station in the country.
Regulars always allude to it pleasantly
as “the death-trap,” or “the white
man's grave,” or “that ruddy ceme-
tery;” and those who know both places
assure us that Aden is a holiday centre
by comparison. In fact, so gloomy
was the outlook when we received
orders to provide the garrison for the
hot season that our poet was inspired
to produce the following:—
Ten Territorials fancied India fine,
Till one caught malaria, and then there were
nine.
Nine Territorials mourned his hapless fate;
One found a cobra, and then there were eight.
Eight Territorials hoped he'd rest in heaven;
One took his topee off, and then there were
seven.
Seven Territorials brooded on their fix;
One picked up dysentery, and then there were
SIX.
Six Territorials strove to keep alive;
One died from cholera, and then there were five.
Five Territorials quaked more and more;
One ate a little fruit, and then there were four.
Four Territorials thought they'd better flee;
One met a mad dog, and then there were three.
Three Territorials felt extremely
blue ;
One drank some water, and then
there were two.
Two Territorials wilted in the
Sun ,
One had a heat-stroke, and then
there was one.
One Territorial felt his day was
done,
He committed suicide, and then
there was none.
Yet, strangely enough,
we remain as a body fit and
healthy, and in defiance of
all precedent persist in
flourishing as if our station
were a veritable health-
resort. Obviously such a
state of affairs is highly
irregular, and a month or
two ago the authorities
took the drastic step of
appointing a new Medical
Officer. As it happened it
proved quite ineffectual, for
this gentlemen, becoming
infected with the prevalent
spirit of heresy, entered
into beneficent league with
our O.C. Detachment and
set about taking energetic
measures which have made
us still fitter and healthier,
to the shattering of
statistics.
It is a curious situation.
I picture them up at Simla
perplexed and shrugging
their shoulders. “Ah, well,
these Territorial fellows are
|. not normal. One
- doesn't know what to do
with them.” And then they laboriously
compile fresh tables and sigh for the
good old days.
All the same, our glowing health
seems an inadequate solace for the
daily dose of quinine, and my final
word must be “Ugh !”
Yours ever,
ONE OF THE PUNCH BRIGADE.
P.S.—“Ugh 1”

MORE FISHING IN FLANDERS.
IT is all over now and the Corps
Commander has issued an order for-
bidding the practice. So of course it
never can happen again. There can
be no harm therefore in telling the
story. The entente cordiale is not
likely to be permanently damaged by
the revelation.
It happened in Flanders a few weeks
ago; not that part of Flanders where
Sergeant McCallum in his spare mo-
ments casts the fly over running waters,
as described in Punch, but the part
where standing water is everywhere
and the troops are forbidden to drink
it under pain of instant death. The
neighbourhood has a habit of fishing
and even in these bad days a few
stout-hearted old boys are not to be
interrupted in their favourite pastime.
I do not think that they ever catch
much, but they do a lot of fishing.
It was the hour when the homing
aeroplane comes droning overhead and
the big guns on either side are bidding
each other “Good night.” The sun
had set, but the red glow was still in
the sky. It was a windless calm and
the still waters of the canal reflected
the long lines of the over-arching
poplars. At the bend just below the
lock by St.-What-d'you-call-him was
an old Flamand, a regular vieur pécheur
clad in blue smock, with rod on shoulder
and his bait-can in his hand. He had
been spending a peaceful day within
range of the German guns and had
caught nothing. On his way home he
had stopped to talk to two brothers of
the craft. These, Heaven bless them,
were no other than two subalterns of a
famous Indian regiment. They carried
no rods, but between them was a large
basket filled with fish of all the un-
appetising varieties which haunt these
muddy waters.
As I drew near I heard an honest
British voice speaking in laboured
French. “Monsieur,” it said, “nous
les premons dams les mains.”
The old peasant was puzzled. Mes-
sieurs les Anglais were wonderful
people and admitted adepts at sports
of all kinds, but that they should
catch fish in their hands by the basket-
ful, without so much as wetting their
sleeves, seemed a bit too much. At
that moment a stalwart Sikh orderly,
who was standing a little apart from
the others, peering down among the
reeds which fringe the margin of the
canal, cried out, “Ek aur mila, Sahib ''
(Here's another, Sir), and, stooping
down, picked up a large roach which
wriggled feebly in his hand.
“Mon Dieu, les Hindous !” said the
Frenchman, and, crossing himself de-
voutly, departed through the twilight.
I swear I never gave it away, and
yet four days later the order appeared:
“Bombs are issued for use against the
enemy, and their employment for the
destruction of fish is prohibited.”

“’Ev yer got a partner, Sir?”
On the very threshold of the garden
stood a small figure, with one arm in a
sling and the other waving a tennis
racquet.
He smiled at me like a pleased child.
From that moment I belonged to him,
and to him alone. His name was
Kippy. -
“No,” I replied, “I have not. What
is it 2 ”
“Well, Sir, me and one of the other
incapables was agoin' to take on
Swish and Gunner Toady, but they
all seems to be crowkettin' and what
not, so I thort ?” He looked at
me inquiringly.
“Right-o!” I exclaimed. “Where's
a racquet” ”
Kippy produced one from the sum-
mer-house. It was half-brother to a
snow-shoe, but, having four uninjured
limbs, I willingly conceded the handicap.
“You got ter look out for Swish,”
my partner confided; “'e's extrordinry
nippy for 'igh explosive in the knee.”
I started to serve, a graceful honour,
and put a couple into the net. I re-
peated the offence from the other
court.
“I forgot to tell yer, Sir,” my partner
whispered hoarsely, “but I got a packet
o' fags on over this.”
I pulled myself together and, though
hard put to it by the Gunner's lobs, we
eventually won. -
“E's bin with one o' them 'eavy
'owitzer batteries,” remarked Kippy
à propos of the Gunner's play; “plung-
in’ fire, that's 'is game.”
He glanced round the lawn with a
bright eye.
“'Ow about a little crowket, Sir 2"
he queried.
“Of course,” I replied; “come on.”
I gathered up a mallet and tried a
short approach.
“Now,” exclaimed Kippy, addressing
the opposing platoon, “you knows the
rules 2 First through the 'oop 'its the
stick, and ennybody playin' out of
the 'erbashus border will be court-
martialled.”
We won the croquet hands down,
Kippy being made of the stuff which
is born to achieve success against any
odds, including a partner who plays
with the wrong ball.
We drifted over to watch the con-
clusion of the clock-golf competition—
four prizes for the four lowest scores.
Kippy, who had played his round
before I came, stood in an unassailable
position for the prize with a score of
27. The two last players finished well
in the thirties.
“’Opeless, ain't they 2” Kippy whis-
pered confidentially, “an' they both
got the D.C.M. too !” -
Suddenly he had an idea.
“Wot about these 'ere totally inca-
pables?” He indicated those warriors
who were too badly wounded to take
part in anything. “'Ow about their
prizes 2 . . . Tell yer wot,” he con-
tinued, no suggestion being offered,
“there's six totallies, ain't there?
Well, six of us repersents 'em and plays
agen—see? I'll take Soggy Mills.”
The resuscitated competition was
watched with burning interest, espe-
cially by the totallies. Whether the
previous practice had anything to do
with it or not I cannot say, but when
Kippy, playing last, put Soggy Mills
on the top with a miraculous 24, and
turned to read the scoring list, he pre-
faced the results by exclaiming Joyfully,
“Blest if the cripples ain't gone and
won hall the prizes' "
Having settled this matter to his
own and everybody else's satisfaction,
Kippy went on to further struggles.
Our sports platoon only averaged
two and a-half available limbs, but for
sheer endurance—well, it was the first
occasion on which I realised why the
Prussian Guard failed to reach Calais.
At length came the tense moment of
departure; blue jackets were donned
and farewell cigarettes were lighted,
and I, all that remained of me, went
happily home.

picked up a piece of metal from the

Bedaubed by his praises each hero
Whose prowess in honour I held
Sinks down from the zenith to zero,
His halo completely dispelled;
While the men I was always assailing
Some justification obtain

By the law that declares the corrective
Reciprocal force of extremes

The best sort of antidote seems;
For only by remedies drastic
Relief can I hope to attain

THE FIDDLER.
How the transformation came about
I can't pretend to explain, for in the
first place he must have felt very nearly
as bedraggled, as pinched and despair-
ing as he looked. You were bound
either to smile or to sigh : he was so
obviously, so grotesquely, “down on his
luck,”, with the shiny frock-coat (a
size too small) tightly buttoned across
his chest, trousers creasing like a
couple of concertinas about his thin
ankles, and the battered straw hat
worn with an attempt at jauntiness
which deceived nobody.
“Ought to be above this sort of
thing,” muttered a well-fed holiday-
maker. “Drink, probably,” suggested
another. But occasionally, very occa-
sionally, a coin would chink at his feet.
As he bent to pick it up, wisps of grey
hair tickled his cheeks. Standing in the
drizzling rain on this deserted sea-front,
he rubbed his numbed fingers, and a
dirty-faced boy, mimicking him to the
life, capered on the pavement, an imag-
inary fiddle tucked under his chin.
g-
“Hip, hip, hooray!” yelled the boy,
and, vaulting the railing, took up his
stand in the gutter as the 3rd Royal
shires—twelve hundred strong—
swung into sight. “Hooray!” cried
the urchin again; but it fell very flat,
and the men were fagged out, caps
pushed off their foreheads, tunics un-
hooked at the throat, boots weighing
like lead.
Hesitatingly, the fiddler shuffled
nearer the road, raised his bow, and
then—he came into his own. First
he struck up some familiar rollicking
tune, and the men in the front ranks
were soon humming the refrain. Next
he danced alongside the column, now
walking, now running, caring neither
that a sudden gust of wind had blown
his hat off his head, nor that a very
junior subaltern marching at the head
of the leading platoon cast him an
amused, not ungrateful glance over
his shoulder. From top to toe—mind,
I am not attempting to explain it—the
little man was transformed; his back
had grown straight; even his clothes
seemed to fit him; his feet flew over the
ground, and into his dull eyes had come
a foolish twinkling light as, with coat-
tails merrily flapping in the breeze, he
played the soldiers back to camp.

THE admirable scheme of Broad-

understand, had a marked influence
upon literary taste among the troops;
and the old popular songs are either
being discarded or modified in the
direction of greater dignity. Thus,
“Who's your lady friend?” has now
become “May I venture to enquire the
name of your fair acquaintance?” No-
body any longer sings, “Here we are,
here we are, here we are again,” except
in the new version, as follows: “We
have pleasure in signalising our return
to this neighbourhood.”
When they refer to Tipperary it is to
say, “The distance to Tipperary is very
considerable,” and allusions to John
Brown's body take the form of “The

Brown continue to decompose.”

MY HOLIDAY.
WE got there yesterday afternoon.
We came back to town hurriedly this
morning. It was not much of a holiday.
For instance, we found that our boat
had to have a permit signed by the
“Officer in charge of Coast-watching
Division.” “This vessel,” it said, “is
allowed to proceed as far as three miles
from—(name of port, creek or river to
which vessel belongs)—during daylight
hours only.” The nature of employment
of the vessel was Pleasure, it said. Plea-
sure with a label on it and with a possi-
bility of its being inspected by “any
Officer or other authorised person " '
Besides, “if caught out by fog” we had
to “return to shore at once.” On the
whole we decided against the boat.
Then again our house was on the
cliffs. The cliffs were patrolled by
guards with fixed bayonets. It was
thought safer to play Patience indoors
after dark. But I went to bed, bored.
Not to sleep, however. There were
regulations about lights. So we had
all the windows thickly curtained,
so thickly indeed that I could hardly
breathe in my room. I took it all
down when I blew out my candle for
the night. The night happened to be
rather breezy. Now, when you are
staying in a quiet spot, a little wind
can make your bedroom behave in a
peculiarly uncanny manner. Knowing
this from experience, I made what I
imagined to be ample preparations.
I wedged my door with a sock so as
to prevent its rattling. I tied all the
loose bits of things like curtains and
covers into tight knots so that they
should not flap. I collected all my
papers and put them under the heel of
a heavy boot. Then I went to bed.
I was deadly tired and was almost
asleep in two minutes; but sure enough
something began to scrape. It would
give a few jarring notes and then cease
for a time. I thought I might sleep
in spite of it because I was tired, and
I encouraged myself by thinking of my
son in France sleeping under bursting
shells. It was no use, however. The
grating noise got more and more on
my nerves. I finally got up and listened
carefully with a view to tracking down
the disturbance. It proved to be a
stray curtain ring. I summarily in-
terned it in the nearest knot and went
to bed again.
I next heard an insistent tapping
sound from the neighbourhood of the
mantelpiece. I got up at once this
time and, approaching cautiously, I
found that it was a piece of cardboard
—a photograph probably—doing a sort
of short-circuit performance against
a vase. I rounded that up with the
papers under my boot.
A few minutes later I was woke up
again. This time the wind was irritat-
ing what I imagined to be the wire sus-
pending a picture on the wall. I took
down the picture, wrapped it in my
dressing-gown, put a chair on it and
got back to bed with a certain sense of
satisfaction. But when I again heard
the same noise from the identical spot,
knowing as I did that there was now
nothing on the wall except the wall-
paper, I became desperate. I got up,
struck a light and determined to put
my house in order once and for all. I
was getting on well with the general
démeublement when I heard footsteps
on the path outside. I suddenly re-
membered that my curtain was tied up
and that my kindly light was probably
leading countless German submarines
on, so I guiltily blew it out. Then,
putting my head out of the window, I
demanded stoutly, “Who goes there?”
Some one answered, “Sorry to trouble
you, Sir, but there was a light shining
from this house that could be clearly
seen out at sea. I have to inform you
that only one warning is given; after
that it is imprisonment.” It was the
Coast-watching Division.
As I said before, we came back to
town this morning.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE BIG DRUM.”
I HAPPENED to see that version of
The Filsons then are disappointed,
but, as every stage hero is too proud
and stupid not to make an enormous
fuss about these secondary matters of
| The Big Drum of which Sir ARTHUR money and social standing, Philip, the
PINERo was the sole author. Now I
understand that he has complacently
collaborated with the British Public,
and that the new part-author, with
customary vanity, thinks - the play
vastly improved. Yet I suspect Sir
ARTHUR to be the better judge of his
own business; and if I venture a
private theory of the affair it is because
I prefer to hold the dramatist guilty of
a much lighter crime than this appar-
ently callous sand-bagging of his own
offspring. -
Philip Mackworth, the highbrow hero
of The Big Drum, was ten years ago an
obscure journalist, writing pars from
Paris for The Whitehall Gazette. He was
in love with Ottoline Filson,
the beautiful daughter of a
rich and pushful vulgarian.
Filson père hadn't made
such a social hit in Paris as
all that, so he planned a
raid on London, and Ottoline
asked Philip just to prepare º
the way in one of his bright ºf I
little pars, and so make the
job a shade softer. Where-
upon, hating nothing quite so
much as this disgusting pub-
licity, Philip drew himself up
and bowed her irrevocably
out of the room into the
waiting arms of the Comte
de Chaumié, with whom she
lived unhappily some nine
years, until she was very
mercifully widowed.
A year later, at which time
our play begins, a kindly
designing friend asks Ottoline and
Philip to lunch, to such effect that
with their usual hasty impulsiveness
they promptly become engaged—a First
Act that promises plenty of true-lovers'
knots. Ottoline is rich; Philip, now a
novelist, poor; but in his opinion (I
must in candour note that all the
available evidence was the other way)
he is on the eve of an enormous popular
success with his novel, The Big Drum,
a satire on the modern arts of notoriety.
Randle Filson, by this a knight, and
with his lady beating a more persistent
drum than most, has visions of a second
brilliant match for Ottoline, though why
from that point of view she shouldn't
have done better as the Comtesse de
Chaumié than as the wife of Sir Timothy
Barradell, the Irish bacon baronet,
whom her family is so eager to catch,
is one of those things that a fellow
in the stalls can never be expected
to understand.

white-souled, must needs accept their
vulgar point of view and add to the ten
long years of separation by inserting a
clause in his agreement with Ottoline
that there shall be no question of mar-
riage till his undoubted success as an
author shall have enabled him to put
up roughly the same amount of cash
and cachet.
Well, you will have guessed that
Mackworth's book is a hit. Not his
usual eighteen hundred or so, but
twenty-five thousand solid copies are
sold. There is no holding our author.
Windy enough in prospect he is posi-
tively gusty in realisation.

blow. For, as it happened, Ottoline,
who apparently hadn't any great faith
in The Big Drum, had been to the knave
publisher and bought twenty-three
thousand odd and stored them in a
damp cellar. No wonder Phil was
annoyed when all this was explained
just before what promised to be a rip-
ping little dinner. So he drew himself
up a second time and bowed Ottoline
out of his life—only, after a haggard
night, to send her a noble note of en-
treaty and forgiveness. Ottoline crossed
it, coming to say that she loved him
enormously but couldn't possibly tear
him from his art; also she knew that,
having been born, as you might say,
with a big-drum-stick in her hand, she
would never be able to resist booming
him and so spoiling his life. So she
just gives him one lovely lingering look
and goes off to marry Sir Timothy,
leaving Philip to console himself with
the MS. of The Big Drum's successor.
At least that 's what she did in Sir
ARTHUR's version. And I flattered
myself that I had taken his point with
commendable quickness. Knowing Sir
GEORGE's generous weakness for the
interpretation of truly noble characters,
he had played off Philip Mackworth
with his high disdain of manufactured
boom, his fidelity to his old love's
memory, his (unnecessarily) long and
impassioned speeches and those fine
moments just before the end when he
contrives so rapidly to make himself
believe love to be well lost for the
(entirely delusive) hope of success with
his next novel—as the hero of this odd.
slice of life.
Whereas in fact, as
Ottoline and I (and Sir ARTHUR) knew,
the authentic hero was Sir Timothy,
who understood how to worship with
a proper tenderness and loyalty and
would never draw himself up in dis-
dainful surprise. We also
knew not only that there
never was in Philip's head any
novel worth a fiver in advance

think, for the protection of a nice,

“goes for chickens.”
A small child, being asked to outline
her idea of a suitable future for Germany
and the KAIs ER, wrote as follows:—
“After the War I wouldn't let Heligo-
land belong to anybody. I would put
the Germans there, and they should
dig and dig and dig until it was all
dug into the sea. The KAISER should
be sent to America, and they should be
as rude as they liked to him. If he
went in a train no one was to offer him
a seat; he was to hang on to a strap,
and he is to be called Mr. Smith.”
We learn from The Croydon Guardian
that, although the cast of The Moulin
Rouge Revue, at the local Grand
Theatre, “includes many artists of
Parisian renown,” “the venue will be
in English,” a language which they
have been learning at the London
Pavilion. It would seem that this is
not their first notable achievement, for
we are told that “all the male members
have been to the font,” and are ex-
empt from further service. They have,
in fact, in the vulgar phrase, gone
through their baptism of fire.

WOAD.
PERHAPs I ought to explain that, on the strength of a
great-aunt who was an American, it sometimes pleases
Francesca to assume the airs and the ambitions and the
graces of a true American. This was one of her American
days, and she had been picturing to herself and to me
certain desirable things that would have attended her had
it really been her lot to be born on the other side of the
Atlantic. - -. -
“Francesca,” I said, “when you were a dweller on the
boundless and rolling prairie * , , -- - - -
“Yes,” she interrupted, “and when you were roaming
through the forests in a complete suit of woad.” --
“Woad 2 " I said. “What is woad 2 ''
“There's no ‘is’ about woad,” she said. “Woad 's all-
in the 'was' department. It was a blue stain habitually
worn by the Ancient Britons. Dark blue, I hope. There's
something too néglige about light blue. It could hardly
count as clothes, could it 2 Anyhow, woad was the Ancient
Briton's all-the-year-round dress. You ordered it at the
grocery stores.” -
“The grocery 2” I said. “What had the grocer to do
with it 2." -
“Every grocer in England,” she said, “calls himself an
oil and colourman. So in the brave old days you dropped
in on Mr. Baker in the High Street, a stout man and there-
fore probably a Druid, wearing long white robes and a
wreath of oak-leaves; and you told him that last lot of
woad was very poor stuff; your knees and elbows were
beginning to show through already; and he'd tell you he'd
just got in a new consignment warranted not to run in the
rain; and you'd buy a can of it and carry it home and
paint the whole family, and then we'd all go out and show
ourselves to the village in our new dresses * x
“Yes,” I said enthusiastically, “and we should have
little placards hung round our necks to say we were wet
paint and people mustn't rub against us.”
“Oh, that wouldn't matter; they'd all be in woad too.”
“It would matter very much,” I said. “You wouldn't
want the neighbours to carry off any of the paint we had
just paid for out of our own pockets.”
“Pockets!" she laughed. “There weren't any pockets.
You just let the account run up and then you handed a
sheep in over the counter and got a receipt from the oil and
colourman. Oh, it was glorious to live in Britain in the
ancient days' "
“Cheap," I said, “rather than glorious.”
“Cheap,” said Francesca, “and therefore glorious. You
could dress yourself and me and three growing girls and
one small boy during a whole year for about half a sheep,
and nobody ever complained that the bills were too high.”
“And that,” I said, “is just where you're wrong. If
you had married an Ancient Briton * >
“Which is precisely what I have done,” murmured
Francesca.
“If," I repeated sternly, “you had married an Ancient
Briton he would often have assured you that his account
at the bank had been reduced to two sheep, a cow and the
sirloin of an ox, and that if this sort of thing went on he
would be ruined.”
“And I,” said Francesca, “should have been quite frank
and direct with him. I should have asserted myself as an
American citizen and answered him in that style.”
“But,” I said, “you couldn't have been an American
citizen, you know, even supposing you had started like that,
which you haven't. By marrying me you would have
become an Ancient British subject, owing allegiance to
KING CASSIVELLAUN US * *
“Or KING CARACTAcus,” said Francesca.
“Yes,” I said, “ or possibly to QUEEN BoADICEA.; and it
wouldn't have been a bit of good talking to me like a true
American citizen. Being an Ancient Briton I should
probably have had to beat you, and it would have been
useless for you to appeal to the American Ambassador.
He would have had to tell you you'd brought it on your-
self. I've explained this to you a thousand times.”
“And I've refused to understand it ten thousand times.
You can't persuade me that if I had been an American
you would have turned me into a Boadicean by merely
marrying me.” - -
“I’m not,” I said, “trying to persuade you. I'm stating
a dread ſul fact.” - - -
“And I'm defying your fact,” she said. “If my great-
ſaunt, who was a Slingsbee, were alive, you couldn't make her
believe that, just because she married Mr. John Brabazon
of Yorkshire, she wasn't to be proud any longer of the
embattled farmers and the Pilgrim Fathers, and New York
harbour, and the American Constitution and the Stars
and Stripes.”
“No,” I said, “I daresay I couldn't, but I should tell her
that she must mix envy with her pride, as I do, for as soon
as she married your uncle John all these splendid things
ceased to be hers.” -
“And that,” said Francesca, “was most unjust. All I
can say is I hope Auntie never heard of it. She was very
hot-tempered, I remember, and she ‘guessed ' a good deal
and said “bo-id' instead of ‘bird,' and she wouldn't have
liked to be told she wasn't an American by a man who
didn't know what woad was.”
“I admit,” I said, “that it had escaped my memory; but
what of that 2 A man cannot always remember every-
thing.”
“No,” she said, “but he might sometimes remember
something.”
“It is our system of education,” I said. “Our English
public schools are champions at teaching us to forget the
useless things--Latin, for instance, and Greek and French
and Algebra. If I've forgotten more Algebra than you,
it's only because I once knew more.”
“I have solved,” said Francesca, “ more than one quad-
ratic equation.”
“Which,” I said, “was a very unwomanly thing to do.
It is strange that you should boast of it.”
“But,” she continued, “if I had been an American I
should have insisted on introducing you to the Tower of
London, St. Paul's Cathedral and the National Gallery.”
“And I should have retaliated by taking you to the
Falls of Niagara and a silver-mine in Colorado.”
“Take care,” she said. “I have a Staffordshire coal-
mine in reserve.”
“And I should have trumped you with the Bunker Hill
monument.”
“We'll leave it at that,” she said. “Why pursue these
imaginary recriminations?”
“Agreed,” I said; “but, you know, you began it. You
interrupted me with a perfectly frivolous remark about
woad, when I was going to say something very important,
and now it's gone clean out of my head.”
“Don’t worry about coaxing it back,” she said. “I'll
try to exist without it.” R. C. L.

SIR, CASE THEY MIGHT
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. E. F. BENsoN is now firmly established as the chief
satirist of what one calls (for want of a less vulgar term)
the Upper Middle Class. His latest book, The Oakleyites
(Hodder AND Stoughton), finds him dealing as faithfully
as ever with his chosen victims. Oakley is a place some-
what easy of identification, a sleepy, picturesque little town,
once a seaport, now rising from a waste of level marsh-
land, where “when in dusky Autumn evenings the low
sea-mist creeps up over the level, it is easy to imagine that
the retreated waters have swept silently back again, and
lap the base of Oakley Hill, ready to bear up to the walls
of the town freights of fantastic and ghostly merchandise.”
Here dwell a group of characters, chief among whom is
Miss Dorothy Jackson, whose middle-aged love story with
its poignant end Mr. BENsoN tells with much beauty of
manner. I shall not repeat the story, saying only by way
of criticism that it reveals its hero, a popular novelist, as
a rather foolish and gullible fellow. But it may well be
that popular novelists, in human actuality, are like that.
Mr. BENsoN probably knows. Indeed, I had a passing
wonder whether in Wilfred Easton he was not poking
gentle fun at the creator of a certain Dodo, now extinct.
But tender and full of genuine feeling as is his picture of
Dorothy, it is once again the subsidiary persons who make
the book. There is a Christian Scientist lady, for example,
who is glorious fun; one with whom “all ways led to
Mrs. Eddy,” and all that was conversationally possible for
her friends was to lengthen out the way. And not even
Mr. BENSON has written anything more bitingly humorous
than the episode of the three sisters each striving to select
the most valuable legacy from a collection of rubbish. You
can hardly read it for laughter; yet the fidelity of its
observation is almost painful. Both for satire and senti-
ment, in short, The Oakleyites is a book to be ordered.
It would be a rotten thing for anyone who sits at home
driving a safe quill to let himself go in any criticism of
trivial detail in such a document as Miss MAY SINCLAIR's
A Journal of Impressions in Belgium (HUTchINsoN) with a
motor ambulance. We must just gratefully accept it as it
comes, with its curious and no doubt entirely truthful
impressions of fears and laughter, of big things and little
things oddly huddled together, of anxiety about the shape
of the Commandant's hat and of dreadful visions of blood
and tears. There can be no doubt that Miss SINCLAIR and
her companions, the Commandant (a courageous and
apparently untrained man), two doctors, two stretcher-
bearers and five women, including the author, carried a fine
spirit and resourcefulness into devastated Belgium, did their
excellent bit and had the time of their lives. It is nice to
think of that young English girl, URSULA DEARMER, who
took with complete calm the bursting of a shell ten yards
from her, and to contrast generally the author's candid
suggestions of fear and dismay before the exciting events,
and of imperturbable serenity during and after them.

hero of Mary Moreland (MILLS AND Boon), also incidentally
the employer of that young lady in the capacity of typist.
So he loved her, and, being excusably bored by his
legitimate spouse, asked Mary to fly with him. But she
wouldn't, having a big soul and being a heroine; also,
probably, because she knew quite well that this kind of
sentimental American fiction is built on the Pamela-or-

The feeling I
had after reading The Jacket was that nothing should
induce me ever to go to the United States. Why, I might
forget to stamp a letter or fail to abate a smoky chimney,

warders jumping on my chest all the time, stopping only

seems perhaps a little easier in *

however, a quality that may be
worked to excess, and in this
tragedy of East Anglian farmers
Mr. PATTERSON seems to have
been overwhelmed by the
thought that to be sincere is
the one and only duty of a

care and ability. But all the care

prolonged. Certainly it was a master-plan—and for that I
have to thank my friend BERNSTORFF–to endeavour to
promote disaffection and strikes in American workshops
which were engaged in manufacturing munitions of war
for our enemies; but I regret to say that, owing to two
causes, this campaign was only partially successful. In
the first place many—I might almost say most of those
appealed to, though they were unquestionably subjects of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire-Kingdom, were by race
Croatians and as such bore but little love to the State from
which, to put it in their own words, they had escaped.
They made most disrespectful references to the Agram
conspiracy trial, in which, as you may remember, my
Imperial Royal Lord and Master was seriously defeated,
and our Government sustained great loss of credit for
having allowed its agents to forge the evidence on which
the prosecution was based. What could it do? If it had
not forged the evidence there would have been no evidence
at all, and then there could have been no prosecution. But
it was important that these knaves should be prosecuted
and convicted of their crime, even if they had momentarily
abstained from committing it. I am sure your Majesty
will know what I mean and will have sympathised with
the object our Government had at heart. The regrettable
thing was that we were found out, with the result that all
Croatians have since become disloyally suspicious of our
motives. They actually prefer making munitions for our
enemies to trusting in the benevolent sentiments of my
Imperial and Royal Master and his heaven-inspired
Government.
And now I come to the second cause of my ever-to-be-
regretted failure. Like the Government at Agram, I was
found out. Very indiscreetly, as I now see, I entrusted to an
American a letter to my chief. The American allowed him-
self to be stopped and rummaged by the British authorities;
the letter was discovered and was immediately made public.
The American Government saw a chance of doing some-
thing which had the appearance of being strong and
decisive without any possible risk, and it has requested my
Government to recall me. What a hell-brew for me to
have to swallow ! I confess I writhe when I think of
BERNSTORFF. The sly fox has done things ten times as
unambassadorial as anything I have ever done, but he
| didn't put pen to paper and therefore he remains comfort-
ably at Washington and is still able to scheme and bribe
and interfere for the benefit of your Majesty and for his
own great satisfaction. How blindly fate sports with us !
There is one point in which my experience of the
Americans may be useful to your Majesty. You have
sometimes—may I say it?—appeared to act towards this
people as if you were timid of offending and provoking
them. I think you are wrong. The Americans are not
really to be feared. They boast about their greatness and
their strength, and the magnificence of their star-spangled
banner, and they expect all the world to take them at their
own valuation. They have been accustomed to twist the
tail of the British lion, and the British lion has contemptu-
ously acquiesced, and the Americans have thus gained the
idea that all the nations of the world will bow down and
submit to them. But if any nation were to stand up to
them and show fight I am convinced this boasting would
cease, and you would see them grovelling in the dust and
submitting to every humiliation rather than push even a
just claim to the risk of a conflict. What, indeed, could
they do? They have no army; two or three submarines
could terrorise or destroy their fleet, and then where would
they be? Let there be no more truckling, but let a strong
policy be adopted towards these braggarts. Pardon me if I
have spoken strongly. On the truth of what I have said
I am willing to stake the reputation of

THE IMPORTANT PASSENGER.
I saw him immediately we rounded
the engine of the boat-train at Folke-
stone and had sight of the ship. There
he stood, “all over khaki,” as someone
expressed it, with his legs wide apart,
as though before the fire waiting for
dinner after a day's hunting, and with
eight inches of cigar protruding from
his mouth at exact right angles to his
ruddy physiognomy. He was on the
deck facing the gangway, and there he
stood scrutinizing the passengers until
the luggage had all been swung aboard,
a matter of a cigar and a-half. He
then without a quiver ascended the
bridge and stood in the same attitude
beside the captain, and it was now,
after so unprecedented an action, that
I began to realise that here was a nut
indeed.
Hitherto he had fascinated me by his
aplomb and suggestion of the govern-
ing class; my eyes were now to pursue
him for his importance. Who could
he be? There was something familiar
about his features. Surely I had some-
where seen pictures, “reading from left
to right,” of those whiskers so unmili- officer and have our passports stamped;
tary in themselves, although, taken in
conjunction with the khaki, and thered
on the cap, and the attitude, so com-
manding, so conquering? But hitherto,
unless I was mistaken, they had usually
been surmounted by a tall hat. Khaki
had never before been their concomitant.
To-day however khaki breaks out upon
the strangest figures, especially perhaps
in Paris at lunch-time in the best
restaurants.
After a while, the third or fourth
cigar beingburnt out, my hero descended
and, proceeding to the principal private
cabin, opened it with a key and dis-
appeared within. Here was another
token of authority and distinction—a
key. I too have occupied cabins, but
no key was ever in their locks.
With his departure the deck seemed
to become a simpler, more domestic
lace.
At Boulogne I saw him again. He
had now a swollen and very official-
looking leather case in his hand,
another cigar in his mouth, and he
walked right off the boat amid salutes
what time we others were huddling in
a dense mass outside the smoking-room,
to be passed in review before a French
and just as I at last reached the buffet
he was leaving it, still clinging to his
leather case and more important in
aspect than ever.
It was then that realisation came
upon me, for suddenly I remembered
having noticed at Victoria that one of
the compartments was reserved for a

that this was he. This was that ex-

A KHAKI COURTSHIP.
I ALways travel down to Haslemere
on Saturdays by the 1.19 train from
Waterloo, eating my lunch in the train
and sleeping afterwards. Last Saturday,
however, just as I had undone my sand-
wiches and was waiting for the train
to start, I was disturbed by the sudden
entry of a gentleman in khaki, whose
three stripes indeed proclaimed him a
sergeant, though his bearing and com-
plexion suggested that he was not likely
long to remain so. He was heavily
burdened; and he climbed into the
carriage at the third attempt with a
puff of relief, struggled across it and
subsided into the corner opposite me.
Having spent a few moments in
*collecting himself, he again rose
to his feet and laid the more
detachable parts of his equip-
ment in the rack on the top of
my soft hat. He then sat down
and, pulling out a large coloured
handkerchief, slowly wiped his
forehead.
Thus comforted he inspected
with no sign of false shame the
other occupants of the carriage.
His eye roved without comment
over the rather pale young clerk
who sat next him and the girl
eating a piece of cake in the
corner on the same side. But
I observed it dwell with satis-
faction, as it reached the oppo-
site corner, upon the ampler
qualifications of a lady, evi-
dently a widow, whose extensive
display of solid metallic orna-
ment left little doubt that she
had at some time received
honourable mention in a pawn-
broker's will. Then I looked
modestly down and submitted
without protest to the Sergeant's
inspection of myself. . . .
At the end of a minute or so I looked
up, assuming that it had been satisfac-
torily concluded, and was not a little
disquieted to find the Sergeant still
glaring at me.
“That man's a German,” said he in
a Scotch kind of voice, as I raised my
eyes; and then, in default of protest on
my part, “I’ve a good mind,” he said,
looking round the carriage for sym-
pathy—“I’ve a good mind to throw
him out of the window.” And he
gazed fiercely at me.
The youth and the girl each looked
up, and then resumed their respective
functions of reading a newspaper and
eating a bun. But I observed through
the corner of my eye that the widow
stiffened herself in her corner and
proceeded, as soon as she had rearranged
her jewelry to suit this new posture, to
fan herself with a paper bag and gener-
ally to emphasize her interest in my
case.
The Sergeant, spurred by this en-
couragement, again attacked me.
“Are you English 2" said he.
“I am not,” said I (being in fact a
mild-faced man with a beard, and Irish
on my mother's side).
“I told you so,” exclaimed the
Sergeant.
“You're right, Sergeant; you're
quite right,” said the widow, nodding
her approval. “He has a German face.
It's a crying shame the way these
Austrians are allowed to go about,

“you're right; and the Government are
a pack of old women to allow it. But
KITCHENER, now—he's the right man
in the right place.”
“He is that,” said the widow.
With a growing confidence in each
other's judgment, based on their esti-
mates of Lord KITCHENER and myself,
they proceeded to the discussion of
other topics, such as the Zeppelin raids,
the medical misfortunes of their re-
spective relations, the thirstiness of
the weather and the lonesomeness of
widows. As each subject drew to a
close the Sergeant turned to me as to
a dog, whose excessive displays of
- affection required periodical dis-
couragement, and,
| “I’ve a good mind to do it,”
said he ; and then, turning again
to the widow,
“There's KITCHENER, now ;
he's the right man in the right
place.”
| “He is that,” said the widow
on each occasion, and added at
the fifth repetition, “He is that,
and it's a marvel to me that he
should have been content to
remain a bachelor all these
years.”
There was a long and pregnant
pause.
“I’ve a good mind to do it,”
said the Sergeant.
An unusual trace of hesitation
in his tone made me look up;
and I observed that his remark
appeared this time to be directed
to himself, instead of, as here-
tofore, to the general company,
and that his glance had been
transferred from me to the
widow, who recognized the
compliment by bridling as effi-
ciently as her configuration and the
multiplicity of her ornaments allowed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VICTIM OF INVASION.
Peter Bintock referred generally to
summer visitors as “them blight.” He
did not see the good of them, he never
had seen and never would see that they
served any fruitful purpose. He came
of a family who had owned their own
land in Treginegar for incalculable
generations, and he could speak casu-
ally of his great-grandfather's attitude
towards the Restoration. (Any ances-
tor behind the grandfather mark was
indicated by the single prefix; beyond
the limit of his immediate experience
Peter was Bergsonian in his treatment
of time and simultaneity.) And if any-
one could need further evidence of so
obvious a valuation of “them blight"
Peter had a clincher in reserve. “It's
just twenty year since the first visitor
came to Treginegar,” he would say with
a kind of superheated patience, and
add as he turned contemptuously away
—“ and he was a black man.” The
well-informed were left to ponder on
the dismal quality of this black blight;
it is the sort you get on beans.
For years after the black man episode
Peter continued to live happily in
historic time, tilling his land on the
principles inculcated by his great-
grandfather in the days of WILLIAM
RUFUs, and only distantly critical of
the slowly increasing plague of green
fly that had miraculously descended
from a black ancestor. These first
visitors were, indeed, comparatively
tentative harmless creatures; the
same specimens recurred annually in
August and September, bringing their
young, and feeding them, for the
most part innocently enough, on one
of the various beaches—poor foreign
things who knew nothing of the
massive permanence of Treginegar,
and almost negligible from Peter's
point of view.
But about ten or fifteen years ago
some unintelligible thing that called
itself a “railway company” built a new
station at a point eight miles nearer to
Treginegar, and the blight only had to
drift five miles instead of thirteen in
order to reach its summer habitat. And
although the poor things tried desper-
ately in the first instance to keep their
refuge to themselves the names of other
places about Treginegar were becoming
famous. Dangerous people, like BAR-
ING - Gou LD and LEWIs HIND, wrote
very wicked books, actually naming
“beauty-spots” on the North Coast,
and all the competition of the “Cornish
Riviera" failed to prevent the blight
from spreading.
Peter began to lose his temper. He
had a curious feeling that he had
missed some opportunity to nip this
thing in the bud. He felt that if he
had, so to speak, killed a few queen
wasps earlier in the year the swarm
could have been avoided. He scowled
through harvest and swore a great deal,
and openly advertised the frightful
horrors that awaited any of “them
blight” if they trespassed on his
land.
And eventually that happened. Peter
saw it from his own front garden,
snatched a cudgel as he rushed through
the hall, and charged, shouting. The
invaders were three timidly - brave
schoolmistresses, and they scattered
and fled like scared hens before
Peter's vocabulary, leaving him vic-
torious but choleric in the middle of
the pasture.
But next August the sacrilege was
repeated more than once; and there
can be little doubt that the Socialist
who attempted argument, and after-
wards brought an action against Peter
for violent assault, secretly instigated
other visitors to dare the outrageous
experiment. That year report had it
that there were as many as twenty-
nine foreigners in Treginegar parish
during August, and Peter began to have
the feelings of one who had undertaken
a great and urgent work.
Incidentally he tried a bull, an indis-
criminating beast, who finally penned
him into a corner while a spasm of
blight were criminally trespassing in
the middle distance. That act marked
the bull as a true descendant of the
black man, and it was transformed into
vulgar beef directly the weather grew
cooler. This error of judgment, how-
ever, confirmed Peter in his conviction
that he was one against a multitude,
that he was a man with a great and
increasing purpose, and he prepared to
fight the whole world in defence of his
rights. He knew that the world con-
tained great hosts of visitors. He had
heard of other places in Cornwall, and
of Devonshire, and of a town called
London that was more than twice the
size (so they said) of Bodmin; but he
was magnificently resolute.
He had a matter of ten months in
every year for his preparations, and
his fields broke out, little by little as
he could afford it, into barbed wire,
and the steadfastly locked gates were
capped by a horrid cheval-de-frise of
dead furze. And during the crucial
seven weeks Peter himself never relin-
quished his cudgel or abated for a
single second of daylight his fierce
untiring watch across the spread of
arable and pasturage. He could not go
to market between July and October,
and his personal work in the harvest-
field was almost negligible. He never
swerved from his holy purpose. He
would not let “them blight" trespass
unaccosted upon one blade of grass in
the fields that his great-grandfather
had so successfully cultivated in the
days of ALFRED THE GREAT.
I am still inclined to believe that
Peter would have survived if it had not
been for the War. He was truly a
victim of the Zeppelin, inasmuch as it
seems that the whole East Coast has
this year vomited its vast swarm of
visitors into Treginegar—upwards of
two hundred, the postman said. And
unhappily a corner of Peter's land
offers a tempting and advantageous
short-cut. By mid-August he had a
wild look about his eyes, which he
had not closed since he found that
some fool had used two of his corn
shocks as a tent to sleep in — and
he had a convinced habit of turning
sharply to gaze across any field that
had been momentarily hidden. He
looked with fierce suspicion at the
very gulls. Two hundred acres take a
lot of watching, and Peter was never
still for five seconds at a time. No
man could endure that strain for seven
weeks. By the end of August I knew
that Peter was a doomed man ; and
when it was found that he had bar-
ricaded the main coast road one night
even the reluctant Cornish authorities
(egged on, unquestionably, by this
blight) were forced to intervene.
In the Bodmin “establishment” they
can keep him quiet in an empty room
by giving him photographs of bare
fields or moors or any desert in which
there is no human figure. The room
must be empty, because he is apt to
mistake furniture for blight, and his
methods are drastic and violent. They
hope to let him out at the end of
September, but they are prepared to
receive him again every year between
July and October. It's the recurrent
kind, the doctor says.
There is a certain irony in the
thought that Peter, whose great-grand-
father farmed Treginegar in the dear
old days of the Phoenicians, should
now be reduced to the level of a
summer visitor in Bodmin.

CAMP QUARTERMASTERING.
I
THE worst of Adjutants is that they
have so much time on their hands that
they can go about asking silly ques-
tions. I was busy at something or
another when our Adjutant asked me
if I would quartermaster our summer
camp, and I daresay that I did, absent-
mindedly and in accordance with mili-
tary etiquette, answer in the affirmative.
Anyway, I thought no more about it
until the middle of July, when the
Adjutant came along and asked what
I was doing about the camp.
“What camp?”
“The summer camp.”
“Is there going to be one?”
“Yes, and you've been appointed
Camp Quartermaster.”
“Very interesting. Any men going?”
“That's what I was going to ask
you. It's your business to find out.”
“All right, I'll ask the Company
Commanders. Do I have to do any-
thing else?”
“Not much. You have to provide
tents for the battalion, and see to the
food and things, and just run the camp.
That's all.”
“That sounds easy.”
“Yes, but you may have trouble
about the tents. I hear there aren't
any to be got.”
“Perhaps we'd better not mention
that to the men until they get there.”
“No, especially as there's no chance
of billeting them.”
“How long will the camp last 2"
“About a fortnight, and if there
aren't enough men we can stop it
sooner.”
“That's a most satisfactory idea and
will make it easy for everyone to make
their arrangements—especially me.”
“Well, you must do the best you can,
and I think you'd better begin to see
about it.”
I saluted, and that's how I became
Camp Quartermaster. The Adjutant's
one sensible idea was about beginning
to see about it, and I accordingly started
to worry the Company Commanders,
who worried the Seconds-in-command,
who worried the Company Sergeant-
Majors, who worried the Company
Quartermaster-Sergeants, who worried
the Platoon Sergeants, who worried the
men, and, as that's the only way that
things begin to move in the Army,
things began to move.
I found that the Adjutant wasn't as
wrong as usual about tents being un-
procurable. It seems that the War
Office had decided to use tents in con-
nection with their war, and that several
other people were thinking of holding
summer camps. These things had been
told to the tent-makers, who are pessi-
mistic people, and, if I had believed the
first half-a-dozen firms whom I ap-
proached, I should have come to the
conclusion that there wasn't a tent to
be procured in the country. However,
by a process of pretending that I didn't
really want tents but was writing an
article on the lack of enterprise in
British industries and in tent-making
in particular, I got the offer of quite a
number of tents at more or less reason-
able prices. To the surprise and annoy-
ance of the tent-makers I accepted
some of these offers and directed them
to despatch the tents to the remote and
inaccessible part of the country where
we had decided to hold our camp. This

put fresh heart into the tent-makers, as
they were able to assure me that no
railway company would carry tents, and
that the War Office had bought up every
available motor lorry. They were right
about the motor lorries, but I discovered
a railway company that was willing to
carry tents if and when they had time,
and if they could find the necessary
trucks and the men to load them. When
it got round that I had secured tents,
about ten members of the battalion
assured me that, if they had known
that I wanted tents, they could have
obtained them for me for nothing. - I
effectually stopped this kind of talk by
telling them that I wanted lots more
tents and eagerly accepting their offers
to get them.
Having more or less settled the tent
problem I turned my attention to the
food question, and sent for the battalion
Quartermaster-Sergeant, who incident-
ally was once a real Quartermaster-Ser-
geant. He said that he knew all about
feeding troops, but couldn't tell me
accurately how many stones go to a
pound of plum jam, or how many raisins
each man is entitled to in a ration of
plum duff. He was willing to hazard
an opinion on relatively trivial details
like meat, but on important questions
like pâté de foie gras and turnips and
the service allowance of pepper per man
for breakfast, and whether an infantry
man was entitled to one pickle and a
cavalry man to two pickles for tea he
was hopelessly uninformed. The best
he could do was to offer to look up a
book of army regulations which had
been issued to him in 1856, and which
he thought still held good. : -
On inquiry I ascertained that ou
last Camp Quartermaster, after feeding
the battalion on a consistent dietary of
pork sausages for four days, had retired
to a private home for the feeble-minded,
where he was passing his time calcu-
lating how many sausages it will take
to feed a battalion of uncertain number
for a week on the basis that pork
sausages go bad in geometrical progres-
sion, starting at one-eighth of a sausage
the first day and going on at the double.
I felt certain that mutiny would be the
result of attempting to feed the batta-
lion on pork sausages for a fortnight in
a year when there was no R in the
month of August, which Matilda assured
me is the sole test as to whether or not
pork is fit for human consumption.
- Obtaining no assistance from the
Army or our own past experience I
turned my attention to marine records,
and found that the staple food of the
sea is vinegar. As the weather looked
wet and stormy. I decided to adopt a
vinegar diet, especially as vinegar is
easily bought and, being wrapt up in
barrels, can be handled with facility.
Both Matilda and the Battalion
Quartermaster-Sergeant thought that
the men would expect meat either as a
relish or an alternative to the vinegar,
as some of them at least would be land-
lubbers and not entirely attuned to the
vinegar diet, and I accordingly agreed
to risk the expense of adding meat to
the cuisine. -
Subject to the state of the Editor's
digestive organs I will tell you some
other time how to buy meat for the
Army and the kind of things that the
War Office do by way of intervention
when they find out that you have laid
in stocks of tents, vinegar and meat
with a view to holding a camp.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, 14th
September.—On prorogation of Parlia-
ment elected in January, 1581, ad-
journed in March same year, QUEEN
ELIZABETH, with that affability in
conversation that marks royalty,
asked the SPEARER what had
passed in the House of Commons.
“If it please your Majesty,
seven weeks,” answered Speaker
PoPHAM. To-day Parliament re-
sumes the Session. If our Mr.
SPEAKER were asked by the
Sovereign what had passed in
the interval since the adjourn-
ment he might make answer, “If
it please your Majesty, nearly
seven weeks.”

towards end of July, we parted

more counselled and comforted by the
grinding of HANDEL Booth, the war-
bling of WEDGwood, the denunciation
of DALZIEL, the prattle of PRINGLE and
the jocularity of JoyNsoN-Hicks.
The hyphenated Member for Brent-
ford contributed to debate a remark
that uplifted cloud of war and made
Members momentarily merry. What
PREMIER aptly described as “a spor-
adic desultory discussion” on question
of conscription versus voluntary enlist-
ment had occurred. John DILLON in-
troduced subject in passionate speech
greeted with continuous cheering from
Members opposite. Remembering old
times when he was accustomed to be
shouted down from same quarter,
reception must have given him pleased
surprise.
Irrespective of Party lines House
divided into two camps, one demanding
day for discussion of the question, the
other insisting on leaving matter to
decision of Government, who alone are
in possession of information upon its
full bearings. It was here JoyNson-
HICKs rushed in and settled matter.
“On the question of conscription,”
he said, “I should myself prefer to
be guided — very largely — by Lord
KITCHENER.”
Leader of Opposition had rather un-
easy time. GUEST (in khaki) jumped
up from his side and, with pistol held

liamentary sense of the words—insisted
upon day being given for discussion of

laughter that followed this re-
mark. What were they laughing
at 2
Preserving best traditions of
Front Opposition bench, CHAPLIN
chivalrously declared his full trust
in the Government to decide if
and when compulsory service
might be needed in best interests
of country.
Only person House really cared
to hear on subject was the
PREMIER. Of the hour allotted
to discussion just nine minutes
left to him. More than sufficed.
Indeed, last half-minute served
for reply that for the time settled
everything.
“When,” he said, “the Gov.
ernment, without undue delay,
with as much deliberation as the
gravity of the subject demands,
arrive at their conclusions, they
will present them to the House,
and they will become the subject of
Parliamentary discussion.”
Business done.—Parliament re-assem-
bled. Commons sat eighty minutes.
Lords thirty-five.

attendance of Peers. Steps of Throne

Elderly Caddie (discussing with golfer the very indifferent exhibition of another member). “You KNow, HE DON'T REALLY ENJOY

This rapid, unpunctuated, unempha- |
sized reading of a paper hopeless.
Noble Lords sat in attitude of
strained attention waiting for dis-
closure of something new, striking,
peradventure cheering. What they
heard was a bald summary of com-
muniqués from Headquarters with
which the newspapers had long made
them familiar. Only new thing of any
importance was expression of opinion
that on Eastern front “the Germans
have almost shot their last bolt.” From
so high authority, abnormally averse
from taking sanguine views, this
opinion was welcomed with muffled
cheer. Standing alone it scarcely
satisfied high-strung expectation.
When K. of K. sat down a strange
thing happened. Noble lords sat in
mute surprise looking at each other.
Was this really all? Was the tale
ended ? Surely something must follow.
LoRD CHANCELLOR sat motionless on
Woolsack, looking round silent benches.
Nobody rose. After awkward pause,
it seemed a full minute's duration, but
was probably only a moment, he re-
marked, “The House will now adjourn.”

He was always so regarded whilst

be glad to hear that in new circum-

a personal pride in this tribute from a

cross-nibbed Government pen into my
hand and passing me a piece of that
charming Government blotting-paper
which blots in very truth. I did as he
requested, and then he handed me a
book of rules and a spade-guinea.
“No, really,” I protested.

Then I found it was only a brass
disc with a number on it. “That is
your metal pass,” the clerk explained.
“It must not be taken home as a
souvenir or worn on your watch-
chain, but must be dropped into the
box provided for it when you leave the
works to-night. You will commence
work in the Cartridge Factory this
afternoon.”
“Where 's that ?” I asked. .
“Second on the right, third on the
left—” -
“Thanks; I know that piece,” I
remarked hurriedly and left the office.
With the assistance of a friendly pro-
fessional munitioner who didn't seem
to know what to do with a trolley full
of brass plates I at length found my
shed and duly presented myself to the
assistant-foreman. “Good afternoon,”
I said: “I have come to ” (and here I
made a twiddling motion with thumb
and forefinger) “roll cartridges.”
The look of relief upon the man's
“I
face when he saw that the munitions
problem had been solved at last was
good to behold. He beckoned me to
follow him, and, making our way amid
a perfect maze of wheels and belts, and
cylinders going up and cylinders com-
ing down, and pistons making drives
to the off and pistons making hooks to
leg, we at last reached a machine that
was half mangle and half copying-
press. On a ledge in front of it was a
boxful of brass thimbles. These were
embryo cartridges, my companion ex-
plained, and my job was to (official
secret) . . . and then to (official

me how to switch the engine on and
off, cautioning me at the same time not
to put the thimbles in upside down or
I should break the punch. He then
started the machine and left me . .
A noise like a salvo of artillery nearly
startled me off my stool. My machine
had stopped. It had “downed tools.”
I issued my first complete high ex-
plosive. “You’ve put one in upside
down,” chuckled a ribald youth on
the next machine. “Your punch is
broke.”
I heaved a sigh of relief. From the
noise I judged that I had broken the
whole factory, and that I should have
to go and explain to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
that in consequence the War couldn't
go on, and that the Government had
better see about obtaining the best
Peace terms possible.
The assistant-foreman came up. I
quite expected him and was consumed
with curiosity to know which of my
ears he would elect to box. However,
he merely grinned, told me I had done
nothing startlingly original, and put
me on to another machine.
Then I got to work in earnest. For
three hours-and-a-half I stuck to my
job, and then the referee blew his
whistle.
without any assistance from me, and I
heard someone say “Tea.” In two
minutes we were all out in the yard
burrowing in our tea-baskets.
I was in the middle of my eighth
bloater-paste sandwich when I casually
looked up and saw the only man of the
V.M.B. I knew who was on the Satur-
day afternoon shift—Peter Travers.
We exchanged greetings. “Your cos-
tume,” observed Peter, as he helped
himself to my cake, “would put the
shabbiest tramp juggler to shame.”
“My oldest clothes,” I said, “as per
advice from headquarters. What, may
I ask, are you doing in last week's
tennis flannels and a blazer embroidered
with the arms of the Thornton Heath
Chess and Draughts Club 2"
“I am sorry,” said Peter, “but that
My machine kindly stopped
is an official secret. If you read the
Official Secrets Act of 1899 you will
find that By the by, what's your
job?”
I drew myself up proudly. “I am
making cartridge-cases longer,” I said.
“Good heavens !” exclaimed Peter.
“My job is to make 'em shorter | We're
merely undoing each other's work. Do
you think LLOYD GEORGE is aware of
this scandalous waste of energy? Let's
go home.”
We were still debating the matter
when six o'clock arrived, and we
followed the stream of workers back to
our respective sheds. Two hours later,
with several thousand others, we
attempted to board a motor-bus that
normally carried thirty passengers.
“It's all right,” said Peter, as we
scrambled on top, “I’m a trimmer.
I'm merely taking the rough edges off
your slovenly work.”
“Anyway,” I answered, “whatever
else I've been doing I've most certainly
contracted permanent curvature of the
spine in my country's cause.”
“And my back aches infernally,”
said Peter. “I wonder if there 's such
a disease as munitions-back — like
tennis-elbow, you know?”
“We're merely suffering,” I said,
“from a little unaccustomed strain
upon our sinews of war.”

ANTI-AIRCRAFT.
I HELPED myself to the last piece
of toast, munched it thoughtfully and
turned to Henry.
“What are we going to do to-day?”
I asked.
Henry stroked the thing he calls his
moustache.
“To-day. Well, I shall take the bike
to pieces.”
“Yes, but what are the men going
to do 2 ''
Henry stopped stroking his mous-
tache. “Clean,” he said. “First of
all they can clean the rooms, then they
can clean the gun, then they can
clean—er—”
“Themselves.”
“Yes. By the way, you're off this
afternoon ?”
I smiled. “I am.”
“Right,” said Henry. “Well, I'll
start on the bike now. Er—you might
look at the rooms.” And he went out.
Henry of course is my senior; we
obtained our commissions on the same
day, but his surname happens to begin
with a B, whereas mine begins with a
Y. He is therefore my senior by some
twenty-three letters, and on parade I
call him “Sir.” I also inspect the
l'OODIls. -
At eleven o'clock, acting on my in-
structions, I put on my belt, took up
my stick and inspected the rooms.
They were clean. At twelve o'clock I
inspected the gun. It was clean. At
twelve - fifteen I inspected the men.
They were clean. At twelve-thirty I
inspected Henry: he was black and
oily.
fired out with my morning's work
I returned to the mess, threw myself
into the comfortable chair and fell into
a light slumber, from which I was only
wakened by the enthusiastic mess
waiter distributing the lunch on the
floor.
It was just as we were finishing lunch
that the telephone bell rang.
I got up and answered it: it was the
Adjutant.
“Hullo,” he said. “The Colonel is
coming over to inspect you this after-
noon.” -
I turned to Henry — the senior.
“Colonel coming over to inspect this
afternoon,” I said.
“Help! Tell him we shan't be at
home.”
I turned to the instrument.
“Very good, Sir,” I said to it. “About
what time 2"
“Oh, during the afternoon.”
We rang off.
Henry stroked the thing he calls his
moustache. “Dash,” he said. “My
bike is all to pieces.”
“The Colonel will only trouble about
the gun,” I assured him.
Henry laughed bitterly. “I hate
these inspections.” .
“I don't mind them,” I said airily.
I don't ; on such occasions I walk
behind and listen to Henry saying,
“Yes, Sir, it shall be altered.”
“I don't mind them,” I repeated.
“After all, it isn't the General.”
“Very well, then, will you stay in
this afternoon 2 I hate them, and you
inspected this morning.”
I began to alter my point of view;
it is one thing to trot behind and watch
Henry with the Colonel; it is quite
another to trot in front and be watched
by the Sergeant. - -
“Henry,” I said, “be a man.”
“Look here, old thing, you might—”
“Of course,” I said, “you are my
senior x *
Henry is very sporting. “It isn't a
question of seniority, and of course you
take to-morrow afternoon off.”
I walked up and down the room
(20 feet the double journey) and then
across it, (9 feet). I thought of the
night when I had nearly shot at a
cloud and how Henry had restrained
me, swearing it wasn't a Zeppelin.
“Henry,” I said, “I’ll do it.”
He looked very relieved. “Sports-
man,” he said, “I’ll have to borrow
your pushbike.”
“Do,” I agreed; “and now I'm
going to inspect the gun.”
“But you did that this morning.”
“Yes; but this time I am inspecting
from a Colonel's point of view.”
: : ::: ::: x:
“During the afternoon” is a most
elastic term. I am not by any means
nervous, but I must admit that half-
way through the afternoon I had in-
spected the gun no fewer than ten
times, and the rooms and the men,
unofficially, at least five times. Inci-
dentally I had had a long chat with the
Sergeant. It was my first inspection.
At four o'clock the Colonel and the
Adjutant arrived. I explained that it
was Henry's afternoon out and he had
unfortunately gone before the tele-
phone message arrived—a very permis-
sible lie.
Then we inspected the gun. There
was just one slip; it was when the
Colonel pointed to a new lighting
arrangement, an idea of Henry's.
“That lighting,” he began.
“Yes, Sir,” I said mechanically,
“I’ll have that altered.”
“I was going to say I thought it
distinctly good,” he continued.
I tripped over the box of spare parts
and apologised. The rest of the busi-
ness was uneventful.
Just before they left the Adjutant
took me on one side and spoke confi-
dentially for a few minutes.
“You see ?” he finished. . . .
“Very good, Sir,” I said. I went in
smiling and waited for Henry's return.
Eventually he came back, sleepy and
tired.
“Everything all right?” he inquired.
“It was an excellent show,” I replied
modestly. “But they're horrid things,
inspections.”
“Horrid,” he agreed. “Well, I think
I'll go to bed now. Wake me at two.”
He yawned and murmured something
blatant about night watches. “Good
night.” -
“Good night,” I said. “Oh, by the
way, Henry, the Adjutant took me on
one side before they left. It appears
their inspection had—er—a particular

Recruit. “YES, YES 1 BUT DON'T TALK TO ME Now, THERE's A GOOD GIRL. I've Got To GET READY To saluTE THIs of FICER.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE appearance of a new novel by Mr. CoMPTON MAC-
KENZIE is always, even in these days, something of an event.
Therefore I opened Guy and Pauline (SECKER) with a lively
expectation, which—let me add at once—was by no means
disappointed. But having said this I must also say that
Guy and Pauline is not in the least the kind of book I was
prepared to find it. It reveals Mr. MACKENZIE in a quite
new manner, as far removed from the passionate vitality of
Carnival as from the realism, perhaps a little aggressive, of
Sinister Street. Here is miniature painting, most ex-
quisite and delicate in workmanship, devoted entirely to the
portrayal of an episode in the lives of two persons. Guy
and Pauline is the love-story of that friend whom Michael
Fane (you may remember) left to rusticate in an old-world
village, while he himself pursued the more strenuous life.
I have called it a love-story, and the description was surely
never better deserved, for Guy and Pauline is about love
from beginning to end. Had it been written fifty years ago
it might have had as sub-title “or, The Long Engagement.”
Mr. MACKENZIE has, in fact, set himself as hard a task as
could well be imagined: to recount the gradual waxing and
waning of attachment between two young persons, both
charming, solicitous for each other, and—as is the habit of
modern youth—somewhat too introspective to be able to
grasp happiness for thinking about it. Guy Hazlewood
was the man, and the girl was Pauline, youngest of the
three daughters of the Wychford Rectory, as wholly
delightful a family, by the way, as any in fiction. But
with their engagement began Mr. MACKENZIE's difficulties.
He had to show how from day to day the small restrictions
and uncertainties of their position (since Guy could not do
the obvious thing and marry Pauline out of hand) gradually
undermined the devotion of each, changing adoration at last
to something like antipathy. I doubt if any other writer
could have displayed his hero and heroine getting thus on
the nerves of one another without producing that effect
upon the reader. As it is, the story is so steeped in external
beauty (by a happy inspiration its progress is marked only
by the names of the passing seasons) that not till the end
does it reveal itself as tragedy. Guy and Pauline, in short,
is a book that, while it may exasperate the impetuous, will
be hailed by the reflective as an achievement.
Whether the dialect in Journeys with Jerry the Jarvey
(SMITH, ELDER), by ALEXIs Roche, is authentic or not is a
question that must be left to experts. I am content to
think it sound because Mr. RochE seems to know his
jarvey. But a Saxon may well find three hundred con-
secutive pages of Jerry's idiom a little trying. This
particular Saxon confesses as much quite frankly, and
furthermore that he has the impression of but a poor
pennyworth of wit to an intolerable deal of whisky. It is
a simple fact that the alcoholic joke in all but the subtlest
hands is dangerously liable to pall. Whether the vagaries
of a drunken lunatic, or the incident of some old maids at a
tea-party unwittingly swallowing a powerful emetic, or a
squireen at a shoot followed over hill and dale by the
mother of his illegitimate offspring, or Jerry himself pros-
trate in a rowing boat in a heavy swell, can be made

sufficiently diverting by tactful treatment is a speculative
question that may be left to the curious. Myself, I am
conscious that Jerry's painstaking chronicler leaves me
strangely cold, and I rather imagine that this is just the
kind of book that lovers of Ireland don't particularly care
to see published.
You may recall how MARGARET BAILLIE-SAUNDERs had
the singular good fortune to publish a novel of Belgian life,
called The Belfry, at the very moment when the attention
of the world was focussed upon the scenes it described. She
has now followed up this chance topicality by a deliberate
one. Captain The Curé (HoddER AND STOUGHToN) is a
story of Belgium in the agony of invasion. It is a fine
story, written with passion, by one who clearly knows, and
their conclusions. To my own thinking, Three Gentlemen
From New Caledonia is by no means a specially dis-
tinguished example of detective fiction. Its joint authors,
Messrs. R. D. HEMINGWAY and HENRY DE HALSALLE, start
indeed with a promising situation, the escape from a penal
settlement of three convicts, a gang of thieves who return
to civilisation burning to revenge themselves upon the man
who betrayed them. They continue with some pleasant,
if familiar, thrills about rogue-life in Paris and the booty-
buyers of Amsterdam. But their whole method suffers
from what seemed to me an exasperating confusion of
attack. Instead of going straight ahead on any one point,
they indulge in so many nibbles here and there that
one is never sure what they would be at. Perhaps it
was my own fault. The publishers anticipate that the

well. Quite probably the statement (to give the particular

hundred pounds may stimulate public curiosity and conse-
quent sales. What, speaking as a reviewer, I could wish
is that when the distinguished judges, “specially, selected
to represent a variety of tastes,” have made their award
they would retire and leave me to my own unprompted
opinion, instead of suggesting the excellences of the volume
in enthusiastic paragraphs on the cover. I am the more

ONE OF THE BULLDOG BREED.
[“An indent is a wondrously perfected device for whitening the hair
of the officer involved.”—Mr. Airwold BENNETT in “The Daily
News.”]
Lieut. and Acting-Quartermaster Denton-Smythe sat in
his office prepared for the nerve-racking process of filling
in the daily indent. Summoning up that courage which is
instinctive in the British officer, he opened Army Book B 55
and wrote the name of his unit, “H Bty. 999th Bde.
R.F.A.” on the top line. Without resting after the mental
strain involved he filled in the word “One’’ in the space
for “No. of day's rations required;” and again, without
pause, filled in the date, “Sept. 20th,” in the space for
“Date when rations are required.” . .
Many men would have taken a rest at this point, but
Lieut. Denton-Smythe was made of sterner stuff. He
only paused long enough to dip his pen in the ink and then
entered the number 112 in the space for “No. of officers,
warrant officers, non-com. officers and men," and the
number 112 in the space for “No. of rations required.”
The unflinching sense of duty which characterises our
officers was never better exemplified than in the case of
Lieut. Denton-Smythe. Even after the exhausting mental
effort required to calculate that 112 men would require
112 rations he would not yield to exhaustion.
Again dipping his pen in the ink with the same deter-
mination with which he would have thrust a bayonet
through a German, he put the number 126 in the space
provided on the form for “No. of horses;” and again, with
no outward sign of brain fatigue, he calculated the number
of rations required for 126 horses and entered the number
126 in the space provided.
Then, gathering together what remained of his superb
energy, he signed his name at the foot of the document
and laid down his pen.
Here one would like to be able to say that he was free
to rest—to go on leave for a week, and, attended by loving
members of his family, or by one even dearer than they, to
recuperate his jaded brain and shattered tissues.
But the Army regulations are callous, and no such happy
ending is possible, unless we tamper with truth.
The gallant officer had laid down his pen, but his task
was still incomplete. He had yet to detach the indent
from the book. This done he rose and, with a supreme
effort, opened the door and said, “Corporal, send this to
the Supply Office.” Then he collapsed. -
THE SIGNAL.
CoNCERNING the multitudinous charms and stately sweet-
nesses of Audrey, much might be written, but as this is to
be an article, as opposed to a book, and as young goddesses,
being but human, may be spoilt by a too candid worship,
I will here confine myself to her single fault. Audrey is
romantic, nay more, she is mediaeval. When recently I
approached her with a certain momentous question, she
was fresh from half-a-dozen versions of the “Tristram and
Iseult" legend, and to say that she was full of it is to put
the case feebly. The sick lover was to infer, you remember,
from the white or black sail on the good ship Swan whether
his affaire was going smoothly or quashed for ever; and
Audrey proposed to tell me my fate by a modernised treat-
ment of the idea. After a clear week for reflection, she
would meet me by appointment, and if she came clad in
brilliant hues I might go to the jewellers' at once for the
ring; but if the tints of her attire were “neutral" all
would be over, and I could interview the chemist, with
an order for strychnine, at my earliest convenience.
The fateful night arrived, and Audrey's ensemble flung
me into mingled triumph and despair. Even to my dull
masculine eyes the run of her tints was appallingly neutral;
but there was one solitary gleam of hope. She wore on
her breast a screaming red rosette which would have
spoilt the beauty of any ordinary girl. Poor tongue-tied
coward, I lacked the nerve to insist on an answer outright,
and we proceeded with the agenda of the evening, which
consisted of a theatre, a modest War-supper, and a taxi
home. I trust never again to pass through such torments
of doubt and suspense. At last, as we stood on the steps
of “The Lindens,” where Audrey dwells, I could no longer
silence my anguish. -
“Tell me, dearest,” I whispered, hoarse with emotion,
“tell me, and put me out of my pain. Are these tints to
be taken as brilliant or neutral 2"
“You silly boy,” she replied, “as if I could dress in
bright colours now-a-days' Why, you can't get anything
in that line fit to make up for love or money!”
A great wave of hope surged over me.
“But this thing,” I cried, pointing to the scarlet abomina-
tion on her breast, “it means?”
“Sh—h—h !” she whispered. “It's a dead secret, and
papa would disinherit me if he found out. I stole his Civic
Volunteer brassard and made a temporary rosette of it.
That seemed the handiest way to show what I mean "
My memory has as yet failed to reconstruct fully
the next whirling moment, but it is thought, from the
undeniable dustiness of my knees on the following morning,
that I behaved in the best sixteenth-century style. Audrey
informs me that a special on duty outside “Menaggio,”
four doors away, paused as if in doubt whether to arrest
me or not, and at last gave a furious stamp and strode off
in disgust. It may be that long years had dimmed the
memory of his own youth. Or possibly his feet were cold.
Clear as Mud.

he has a lucid style which makes matters plain normally very

I HAD never beaten Petherby; not
that he is a billiard expert, but merely
that I am a rabbit. A masterly series
of two nursery cannons, varied some-
times by (and very occasionally coupled
with) a hazard is all I aspire to. Peth-
erby, on the other hand, can generally
manage to score something every time,
and not infrequently runs into some
of the humbler double figures. The
truth is that I do not possess the
discriminating eye of a DIGGLE for
the niceties of angles. But I have one
facility of which I am proud and to
which I shall allude later. -
A few weeks ago, at Petherby's house,
I found him in one of his rare off moods.
These off moods of his generally signify
nique was concerned, but I felt that by
careful aiming (so as to hit the Fº
without disturbing the ivory, as I ex-
pressively put it when narrating the
incident to Pilkington) I could manage
to run in. So I took a deliberate aim
and pressed my cue gently forward.
Slowly, slowly my ball trickled up the
table, straight as a die all the way. It
was only a few inches from the red and
still running true when the electric
lights went out. At the same instant
a loud report was heard, followed
immediately by a second and third.
“Zepps!” cried Petherby. “Where's
my umbrella?” - -
“There's other game afoot,” I cried,
as I fumbled for my cigarette-lighter.
The wick flamed up. I hurried to
the top of the table. My ball was in

Sir,” she said, “the police sergeant has
just been, and said you're wanted at
once at the station.”
“I must go immediately,” said
Petherby, struggling into his jacket.
“What a nuisance these Zepp raids
are, interfering with one's amusements
in this way ! Really, I x -
“Half a jiffy 1" I cried as Petherby
moved to the door. “Wait while I play
that shot again. Anybody would think
there was a panic from your positively
indecent haste.” -
“Sorry,” said Petherby, edging off,
“but duty is duty. Where would my
crest of five oysters rampant gules on

150 or so in 250 up, instead
of by the more customary
margin of 200 or more.
But on the night in
question Petherby was
playing so shockingly and ||
I so brilliantly (on two
successive visits to the
table I had played for
safety and scored a clear
board each time), that at
length I was 240 to his
247. It was my turn to
play. -
My first stroke, though || ?
not exactly yielding the
result I had in mind, was
nevertheless a most satis-
factory and comprehensive
one. I made a cannon off
the red, and then my ball

“There's a precedent
for it,” I retorted. “How

But Petherby was half-

“Shirker!” I yelled after

ously disappeared down different
pockets. Petherby applauded with
the butt of his cue upon the floor.
“Good shot, Sir l’’ he remarked sar-
castically. “What a pity it didn't all
come off ”
“All come off " I said with hauteur.
“Why, it did all come off — much
better than I could have hoped for
even in my most sanguine moments.
What do you mean 2"
“Oughtn't the red to have done
something—gone down a pocket, for
instance? Then you would have won
the game. As it is * *
“Petherby,” I said sternly, “re-
member, please, that there are three
balls, six pockets, and certain laws of
coincidence which must operate at
times. In that stroke I distinctly see
the finger of Providence. You are
not intended to win this game. Just
look at the position of the red.”
The red was up the table close to the
left cushion. To pot it was an im-
possibility as far as my limited tech-
the pocket. “Hurrah!” I shouted
joyfully. “Game to me!”
“On the contrary,” said Petherby,
craning his nec Wet m - er,

“it’s my game. You've given three
away ! That red's never budged a
hair's-breadth, I'll swear.” - -
“Rot ' " I retorted. “I couldn't
possibly have missed. I was dead on
the edge of the red when the lights
went out.”
“Can you solemnly affirm you heard
the balls click 2''
“Of course not, you ass,” I replied.
“How could I through that beastly

see me miss 2 " .
“How could I in the dark?” he
answered testily.
“Exactly,” I said. “I couldn't hear;
you couldn't see. As you maintain
that the red hasn't moved, the fairest
thing will be for me to play the shot
again. Do you happen to have a
candle on you?”
There was a knock at the door and
“No, Sir, it didn't hit the red one,”
said Mary, as my ball stopped a few
inches from the baulk-line.
I pretended to heave a sigh of re-
lief. “Thank goodness!” I exclaimed.
“Properly to explain the object and
effect of that stroke, Mary, would
necessitate my using . technicalities
which you would probably not under-
stand. I think, under the circum-
stances, you had better not mention to
Mr. Petherby that I required your
assistance. He might consider it an
abuse of his hospitality.”

exchanged the cigarette-lighter for
half-a-crown.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON BELLONA'S HEM.
THE MISTAKE.
THERE is no need to specify the res-
taurant. It is famous for its English
joints, and is just now much visited
by officers on leave who wish to eat
together, just as a certain subterranean
grill-room is the favourite resort of
officers on leave when, as not in-
frequently happens, they entertain the
other sex.
To one of the tables, thoughtfully
provided with so many chairs that
secrets have ever been out of the ques-
tion here, came two lieutenants, very
obviously off duty for a brief season
and rejoicing in their liberty; and he
who was acting as host, and had long
since settled all doubts as to what their
meal was to consist of, flung out the
order for roast beef almost before he
was seated; flung it out too as though
expecting as instant a response from
the staff as he gets from his men, all
unmindful that this restaurant has
leisurely processes of its own, carefully
acquired and perfected during many,
many years. -
Meanwhile the saddle of mutton was
wheeled to my side and some unusually
attractive slices were separated from
it by a knife like a razor and laid
before me.
I saw the lieutenants eyeing my
plate with ill-concealed envy; but beef
was in their minds. Beef had been in
their minds for toilsome weeks, and
they did not betray their friend. At
least not wholly, but I fancy the host
wavered. -
“I wonder,” he began, and said no
more, for the beef arrived on its little
wagon, and their plates were soon
covered with it.
It was not one of the most successful
of the house's joints, and again I caught
their eyes directed towards my saddle.
Was it too late? their expression silently
asked. Yes, it was. Besides, they had
come there to eat beef. Nothing like
beef '
The lieutenants attacked with vigour,
but they still glanced muttonwards now
and then, meditatively, between bites.
Then the host spoke. It was in an
undertone, but I heard, because at this
restaurant, as I have said, there are no
secrets. “I wonder if we oughtn't to
| have had saddle,” he murmured.
“It looks jolly good,” said the other.
They ate on.
“Do you think the beef is absolutely
top-hole to-day ?” the host asked.
“I've known it better,” replied the
other.
They ate on.
“I rather wish we'd had mutton,”
said the host. “After all—saddle, you

know. It's not too common. Beef we
can always get in some form or other
—not like this, of course, but beef-
whereas saddle, saddle 's rare. I wish
you'd reminded me of the saddles
here.”
“We'd settled on beef long ago,”
said the other, performing prodigies of
valour with his knife and fork.
“I know ; but it was foolish not to
look at the bill of fare. I should have
thought of it then.”
They still ate heartily.
“No chance of getting here again for
goodness knows how long,” said the
host.
The other dismally agreed.
“Could you manage a slice of saddle
after this 2 " the host asked after a
busy interval.
“Sorry I couldn't," replied the other,
through a mouthful which a lion would
not disdain.
“I don't believe I could either,” said
the host. “What a bore l I shall
always regret not having had mutton.”
“So shall I,” said the other.
At this moment the empty seat next
to me was filled, and to the enquiry of
the head waiter, whose duty it is to ask
these questions and then disappear, the
customer replied, “Saddle, of course.
That's all one comes here for.”
Both the lieutenants groaned audibly.

already ruined by me, was ruined once

CAMP QUARTERMASTERING.
- - II. - - - - ... •
Matilda rather misled, me on the
question of buying meat. She said
that there was no particular trick about
it ; that all you have to do is to go to
a place where they sell meat and buy
it, taking care that you get the right
weight and that the man does not
throw too much bone and bits of
sheep's head and cow's feet on the
scale. She said that a purveyor of
meat is easily identified because he
wears a peculiar blue costume and that
the only other person you can possibly
mistake for him is a wounded soldier.
I got into the right kind of place
first time and said, “I should like to
..see some meat.” -
The man didn't take any notice of
me until he had finished cutting off
and wrapping up in newspaper a lump
of meat for a ready-money customer.
Then he said, “What kind of meat 2 ''
“Beef and mutton and such like
things.” -
The butcher affectionately slapped
the piece of meat which he had been
carving and said, “That's a nice piec
of steak.” - •
“How much meat have you got
there?” I asked.
“About five pounds; I'll weigh it
for you.”
“I think I shall want rather more
than that.”
He fetched down quite a large piece
of meat off a hook, weighed it, and said
it was twenty-two pounds.
“I was thinking of buying a larger
piece than that,” I said.
“How much was you wanting 2"
“The piece I had in mind should
weigh between three and four thousand
pounds.” The eager look which came
into his eyes was quickly succeeded by
something akin to fear as he went to
the door to make sure the policeman
was taking his usual afternoon nap in
the neighbourhood.
“If you was wanting to buy meat,
I can sell it you, but if you was looking
for a flock of sheep or a herd of oxen,
I admit I haven't got 'em in stock.”
“I don't necessarily want to take
it all with me,” I said.
“What with my boy leaving me
and my assistant joining the Army,
I haven't got time to waste joking.
Perhaps you was thinking of giving
| a party 2 "
“No I wasn't: I just wanted some
meat, but I see you aren't accustomed
to serve large families and I'd better
try elsewhere. I suppose it's possible
to buy meat for a battalion somewhere
in this town.”
“If you want to buy meat for the
Army you'll have to go to the meat
market.” ~ : -
The meat market is a dull place;
the mention of thousands of pounds
of meat doesn't excite the inhabitants
in the least, and they were rather bored
with my little order; however, they
condescended to deliver the stuff for
me after totting it up in sheep and
Oxen. - - -
In spite of the fact that I had the
vinegar and more than one kind of
meat, both Matilda and the Quarter-
master-Sergeant thought that the men
would expect a still greater variety, and
under protest I added, a few things
like bread, jam and cheese. ‘ I avoided
small tradesmen in making these pur-
chases, as they are so suspicious, and
only dealt with people who had the
capital to carry a decent-sized stock.
When the War Office heard about
the things that Matilda and the Quarter-
master-Sergeant had persuaded me to
buy they naturally got jealous and
started sending out circulars to say
that they weren't going to put up with
any competition with their camps and
that all camps without their name on
were spurious and contrary to law.
Of course I didn't worry about the
War Office because I know that their
printed circulars don't mean anything
and are only sent out to do the printers
and the post-office a turn, but the
Adjutant and our Commandant (who
is in the regular army and doesn't
understand War Office humour) seemed
to think that we ought to scratch the
camp. They got the idea that I had
let myself into some kind of a mess by
what they were pleased to term my
premature purchase of goods, and the
idea seemed to amuse them until I
explained that I had bought all the
goods in their names and that when
the Corps funds were exhausted they
would be personally responsible for
the balance.
So they went to talk to the War
Office about it, and met all the other
Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants
up there on the same errand. When
the War Office found how unpopular
their circular had made them, and
how they couldn't move about without
falling over Volunteer Commandants
and Adjutants, they said they didn't
object to camps being held if the
G.O.C.'s of the various districts didn't
object. Some people, who took the War
Office literally, wrote to the G.O.C.'s
of the respective districts where they
proposed to camp and got leave, which
was then cancelled by the War Office.
For myself, I took no such risk; and
as neither the War Office nor the
G.O.C. of any district found out about
our camp we didn't do any harm to
anyone but ourselves, and we only
caught little things like rheumatism
and indigestion. If anyone does find out
about it I shall apologise for my mis-
take and trust to his being too busy
to do anything further in the matter.
The camp was rather a success; we
got most of the tents to stand up and
some of them kept the rain out, includ-
ing those that mattered (I mean, of
course, mine and the Commandant's and
the Adjutant's). By marking all the
things “Goods for Troops "I persuaded
the railway company to deliver most of
our provender in the belief that they
were helping the Government, who are
among their best customers in these
days. I showed the Government mark
on the tents to the railway people, and
they weren't to know, any more than I
was when I bought them, that it was
the condemned mark. . . . * -
The vinegar didn't go so well as I
had expected and I had a good deal
left on my hands in spite of the fact
that I got quite a lot off in the shape
of claret-cup, which I retailed in the
canteen. Some of the meat rounded
on me and was accorded a military
funeral, but not enough to make a fuss
about. I had to pledge locally what
was left of the Commandant's and the
Adjutant's credit to make up for the
unused vinegar and defective meat, but
there has been no trouble on that score
up to now as they won't know about
it until the bills come in, and by that
time I shall either be on permanent
leave or else have enlisted. -

AT THE BACK OF THE FRONT.
It is true that in a sense' all the
home seas may be regarded as a front.
And yet inwardly I have doubts as to
whether I really am at the moment
exactly what you might call fróntal.
Though correctly swathed in a ceinture
de sauvetage I feel neither nautical,
martial, nor amphibious. I defy any-
one to feel nautical in a service dress
jacket, martial in a life-belt, or am-
phibious in ammunition boots. Martial
is my short suit at the moment. For one
thing, any front there is is underneath.
For another, I have , lost my leave
papers—if indeed I ever had any. In a
few hours, barring accidents, I shall
be turned off on to an unsympathetic
quay, under orders from one race of
red-hatted men eighty miles away from
it to report to them this morning, and
forbidden by another race of red-hatted
men on the spot to proceed anywhere
until I have given an account of my-
self; which just happens to be one of
the few insignificant things I cannot
do. My blind pig is considered one of
the finest outside the Central Powers,
and I can play selections from several
drawing-room ballads with my eyes
shut and my left hand open; but not
even with both my honest straight-
forward eyes at their widest can I hope
to convince Q. R. S. T. U. and other
gentlemen with alphabetical occupa-
tions that I am not a deserter creeping
and intruding and climbing into the
War. - - -
They will begin by saying, almost
apologetically, that they don't doubt
my bona fides (with four false quanti-
ties) for a moment. They will, then
doubt it exhaustively for three-quarters-
of-an-hour, by which time my train
will—as happens' eventually even to
trains in France—have gone. I shall
arrive at dawn to-morrow just in time
to be shot. It is true that the last
time I was shot at dawn I got up and
walked away. But this is not a reliable
precedent, and I regard the future with
the most perfect despondency. All I
can do is to write the word “Later.”
Later it is. Let me give you a hint ;
if you should ever, in a military town,
fall upon the rôle of the Man who Re-
quires Explaining and are told to report
to the A.B.C.D.E. find out what time
he lunches. When we landed, I went
straight to the A.B.C.D.E.'s office and
there extorted by intimidation from an
outpost the news that the officer º
went out to lunch at 12.30 exactly.
returned at 12.28. With one eye on
his watch the A.B.C.D.E. held out the
other hand. I shook it warmly.
“No, no,” he said, “I want your leave
papers—movement order, and all that.”
It was 12.30 exactly when I began
my explanation. At 12.35. I had
reached its crowning feature. At
12.40 he realized that it was I who
wanted a movement order. By 12,42
I had it in triplicate, with permission
to travel by any train that day. I
believe that if I could have hung on
till 12.45 I could have got another
seven days' leave. Even as things
were I have the pleasantest recollec-
tions of the A.B.C.D.E. I reported
everywhere to everybody's satisfaction,
and have not been shot at all to-day so
far. And I have spent the morning
wondering who put my leave papers at
the bottom of my haversack.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
(ExtRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, 21st
September.—Introducing his first Bud-
get McKENNA scored a double record.
In respect both of income and ex-
penditure he had to deal with the
biggest of a long list. The speech ex-
pounding it was the briefest.
Marshalling a multitude of figures,
from the extra halfpenny in the pound
in the price of sugar up to the
1,590 million pounds representing esti-
mated expenditure of the year, his
mastery of facts was so complete,
his explanation so lucid, that the
story was as easy to follow as an ordi-
nary nursery tale. Time was during
the prime of GLADstoNE at the Treas-
ury, and with his successors in later
years, when exposition of a Budget was
regarded as opportunity for a great
oratorical feat. Mr. G. thought nothing
of occupying five hours, finishing up
with a peroration almost worth an
additional penny in the pound on the
income tax. .
No self-respecting Chancellor of the
old school would think of omitting
to deck his business statement with a
classical quotation, much appreciated
below the Gangway. This habit led
to first step in downfall of Bob Lowe.
Allured by the tag, Ea; luce lucellum,
he invented a tax upon matches with
intent to label the boxes with the motto.
In the end, as everyone knows, he had
to remodel his Budget, leaving out the
obnoxious tax, label and all.
McKENNA's speech began without
exordium, finished without peroration,
and no single sentence rose above the
Spartan simplicity of the Multiplication
Table. Only approach to departure
from this level was when he mentioned
the dizzy height at which expenditure
now flies. He thereupon declared his
confidence that House and country were
prepared to support the Government in
bearing whatever measure of taxation
is deemed necessary now, “and,” he
ominously added, “in the future,” for
the successful prosecution of the War.
A hearty cheer confirmed this assur-
ance.
Cheerfulness was indeed the prevail-
ing note of historic occasion. Fresh
burden of taxation imposed enormous.
Affects every class, from the consumer
of half-ounces of tea and quarters-
of-a-pound of sugar to the hapless
millionaire who out of his modest in-
come of a hundred thousand pounds
a year will be called upon to contribute
to the State the sum of £34,029—more
than one-third of the whole. This, of
course, in addition to his share of in-
direct taxation.
As the MEMBER For SARK says, LLoyd
GEORGE chastised the taxpayer with
whips; McKENNA lays on with
scorpions. And yet no murmur is
heard. In November last LLOYD
GEORGE imposed fresh taxation esti-
mated to bring in a revenue of 68%
millions. On the top of that McKENNA
levies new taxes, which in a full effec-
tive year will increase the revenue by
little short of 78 millions.
A big bill, but it will be met uncom-
plainingly, with any furthercharges that
may presently be necessary for carrying
on the War to its inevitable end.

JIMMY'S UNCLE.
Jimmy's Uncle is coming. But
perhaps you know. The telegraph boy
told Jimmy as he was bringing the
telegram; he was coming by the three
o'clock train the telegraph boy said.
Jimmy's Uncle is a Colonel—didn't
I tell you?—and Jimmy's mother hadn't
seen him for years and years, and longer
than that, Jimmy says—not since she
was in India. - - - -
Jimmy's Uncle used to know Jimmy's
father quite well, because you see they
| had been brothers, and Jimmy's Uncle
knew all about Jimmy's father winning
the Victoria Cross in India; but you
haven't got to talk about that or
Jimmy will fight you—really, I mean,
not pretend.
Jimmy says his Uncle has got a piece
of shrapnel in him, and they won't let
him stay at the Front, because it hasn't
burst yet, and that's why he is coming
to see his mother.
Jimmy says the shrapnel might
burst at any time, and then it would
blow a hole ten feet deep in the ground,
but it would ease his Uncle because he
has to walk very quietly and not get
excited now.
put in them, Jimmy says, and you can
hear it ticking. It makes his Uncle
very wary, and he has to avoid certain
things at mealtimes which are not
easily digested because the doctor says
the shrapnel is quite enough.
Jimmy has seen the porter at the
station, and he has promised to stop
the train; you do it by the by-laws,
Jimmy says. - -
Jimmy told the porter he expected
his Uncle would give him some rupees
if he looked after the luggage well, and
the porter took Jimmy to see his; he
grew them in a plot of ground quite
close to the line when he wasn't busy
cleaning the station lamps. He asked
Jimmy if his Uncle soaked his in
paraffin before sowing—you do it be-
cause of the sparrers.
The porter knew all about India; he
told Jimmy that the Hoodans out there
lived on rice pudding, and it was very
hot there because of the degrees of
longitude, which were very warm in
those parts.
The porter hadn't been there, not
himself, but he had read a good deal
when he wasn't busy cleaning the
station lamps. He said he'd often
i. It's because of the time fuse they thought about India because he couldn't
abear rice pudding. He said Jimmy
might safely leave his Uncle to him.
Jimmy went to bed early so as to
give the next day a chance. His
mother nearly spoilt the day before it
came because she put out his best
sailor suit for him to wear and gave
him three pennies to have in his pocket
but not to spend. . He said his Uncle
would think it was Sunday, and he put
his head under the bedclothes to show
what he thought of her. However, he
let her hold his hand tight for an hour
and ten minutes before he went to sleep,
and when she came to look at him
some time later he only smiled in his
sleep when she gently removed his feet
from the pillow and placed his head
there once more.
It took the day a long time to break,
and Jimmy was glad when he heard
the birds tidying up to get ready for it.
He looked out of the window; the day
seemed very damp and as if it wanted
airing, so he got back to bed. It was
eight o'clock, and the day was up and
dressed and being busy when he next
awoke.
Jimmy had his mother at the station
in good time, and they had read all the

by-laws several times over before the
train came in.
Jimmy says his Uncle looked very
fierce when he arrived at the station
; and saw his mother. It made his
mother cry, and she wouldn't speak to
him, and that only made his Uncle grow
fiercer and redder in the face. Jimmy
says he thought the shrapnel was going
to burst. Jimmy says his Uncle didn't
take any notice of him, although he
kept on saluting him as hard as he
could. Then his Uncle turned on him
* and glared at him and asked him what
the dickens he meant standing there
looking so much like his father. Jimmy
said it made his mother very angry, and
she said, “Don’t, Tom, don't,” and cried
worse than ever.
Jimmy says he clenched his fists and
was going to give his Uncle the coward's
blow when his Uncle turned his back
on him and told the porter not to
stand scratching his head like an
idiot. Jimmy says the porter was
only saluting all the time but he wasn't
used to it, and every time he got his
hand to his head he forgot what he
set out to do and scratched his head
instead.
Jimmy says they drove home in a cab,
and neither his Uncle nor his mother
said a word to each other all the way,
they were so cross.
Jimmy says his Uncle had a bad cold
and kept blowing his nose, and every
time he did it the cab-horse gave a
jump.
Jimmy says his Uncle behaved better
after tea. He wasn't so fierce, so he
asked him to show him his wound, but
his Uncle said it was under his binder
and he couldn't.
After the tea-things had been put
away they all three went into the draw-
ing-room to look at the large framed
photograph of Jimmy's father. Jimmy
says they each held one of his hands,
and he had to bite his lip because they
hurt.
Jimmy says his Uncle didn't think
much of the photograph. He just said
“He was a man, Mary, a man;" then
he went very annoyed in the face,
clicked his heels, saluted very hard and
turned away.
Jimmy says it made him feel quite
angry with his Uncle, and he went and
climbed up on the top of the coalhouse
in his best clothes on purpose; and he
wouldn't come down until his Uncle
had promised to be good and not to
make his mother cry. Jimmy says his
Uncle gave him his word as an officer,
and they got on better after that.
Jimmy said his prayers to his Uncle
that night, and he let him know what
he thought of him. He asked that his
Uncle might be made a better man.
His mother said, “Oh, Jimmy' " but
his Uncle understood, for he said,
“Amen to that, old chap!”

FEEDING THE NATION.
“U.P. with that lawn | Over-with
these-flower-beds !” Such were the
clarion cries of last March, and the
family flung themselves into the work
of destruction with genuine patriotic
ardour. In a couple of days we, the
Medhurst family (well known in this
suburb as “the people who hire motor-
cars”), no longer possessed a garden.
We had a house and a frightfulness. . .
Still it was grand work. . I appointed
the two youngest children Worm
Gatherers in Ordinary (with the occa-
sional rank of Earwig Squasher),
because, although. I can plant seeds
with anybody, the handling of reptiles
is simply not my sort of work. It was
Nothing came up, but I kept on look-
ing, despite a certain-seornfulness in
the home circle. But I had the laugh
of everyone in the end. The seeds came
up! - . . -
My pride and joy in the little seed-
lings was, however, not long-lived. The
critics arrived. Always in life everyone
is happy till the critics appear. The
first of them in this case was my
ridiculous and pompous father-in-law,
who, after mumbling coarsely about
“greengrocery,” burst into rude guff-
aws because, said he, my celery (the
well-known garden esculent) should
have been “pricked off "...long ago. I
sneered rather hotly, and said other
people had other views about the correct
period for pricking off (whatever that
I forget what was insulted next.
But they nearly all caught it. My
wife's brother damned the broad beans
and was foolish enough to offer himself
for slaughter by inquiring if I'd ever
heard of “blight.” Then a near rela-
tion of mine, I'm sorry to say, fell ||
fiercely upon my cauliflowers, which,
he bitterly complained, were cramped.
Broccoli caught it too, so did the parsley,
and even the radishes did not go scath- |
less. I was ashamed, of course, but,
having created my vegetables, I swore
I'd stand by them come what may.
We would be misunderstood together.
. Then came the period of our annual
holiday by the sea. It was a wrench,
but I consoled myself with the reflection
that my plants would do their best for
the one profession which I did
not include in the list of my
side-accomplishments for the
National Register.
My wife, Mrs. Medhurst
(known as “the woman with
four hats"), was given a rake.
Let us leave it at that. I fell
over it often.
Jacqueline Medhurst, who is
now three and can say “J for
Jacqueline,'... gathered weeds
and sang at her work. Yes, A.

• The weeks passed away
wearily. I got everything that
I could for the nation out of
the sea — shrimps (several),
prawns (two), eel (one), minia-
ture dab (half), and, on one
glorious day, seven mackerel
(hire of boat, man, lines,
hooks, worms, the thing you
wind the lines on and a piece
- of string to tie fish up comin
to 5s. 6d.). Still it wasn't like
growing things, and the day of
our return was der Tag for me.
Frankly I was knocked,

furiously; everything was much
bigger. Nothing had stopped.
But here I must strike a note

Well, we got the seeds in. They
only cost two shillings—“Somebody's
Monster Gift Parcel"—but I had to pay
one shilling for postage as the potatoes
made the parcel heavy. Still I didn't
grudge that as there seemed to be an
astonishing number of seeds. In fact
when we had filled our garden there
were a packet of “Early to Come"
peas, another of Dwarf Kidney Beans,
and yet a third of Dobbie's Champion
Leeks left over. I mention this in case
anyone would like to buy the surplus.
They're still all right, except the peas,
which have been “played with ” by
Alastair Medhurst, and the bean bag,
which is frayed along one edge. No
beans have escaped, mind, but the bag
has unquestionably depreciated (I will
allow for this).

look at them a good deal, that is to say
I looked at the soil which covered them.

new variety, and I had arranged to
prick off that day if not interrupted
by callers. And when he'd gone I
pricked them off because I remembered
you don't eat the green stuff at the end.
But then they stopped growing.
There followed an attack upon my
onions. The solicitor next door caught
sight. of them one Sunday morning
and, putting his head over the wall,
asked if they really were onions. I
said they were hardly onions, but had
a certain onionimity. I expected ata-
vistic tendencies, however.
He grinned, because he has been to
a public school, and said that I ought
to have asked him before trying onions.
I apologised and offered to dig them out
and begin again. He told me that he
was only trying to be friendly and that
I'd never get an onion if I couldn't
take a tip. And then he went indoors
to his wife (well known in our suburb
as “the woman who whistles”).
noble exception, nothing was eatable.
The greenstuff was overrun with cater-

the beans were tough and coarse, the
peas were hard peas, and the radishes
were huge and woolly. . .

“MY DEAR SIR.”
HE was a small stout round man, with bulging eyes and
loose moist lips, evidently an inquisitive gossipy fellow, and
he had been talking (very optimistically) about the War and
(very pessimistically) about the taxation, fortifying himself,
as he proceeded, with quotations from the daily papers, of
which he had purchased every available specimen. I could
see that he was dying to tell me all about himself, and at
last out it came. He looked furtively round the railway
compartment, as if to assure himself that nobody was
lurking in the rack or under the seats, and spoke.
“I presume,” he said, “that you don't know who I really
am 2 '' -
“No,” I said, “I don't. I haven't got beyond classing
you as a friendly traveller.”
“Thanks,” he said ; “but I didn't mean that. Of course
I don't want to push it on you. I only wondered if you'd
got any idea of what my work in life is. It's a unique
business and keeps me hard at work, I can tell you. Look
here"—he produced one of his papers and pointed out to
me Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's letter—“what do you think of
that 2 ”
“Very telling,” I said; “distinguished by all the fire and
eloquence and innocence for which L. G. is famous.”
“Yes,” he said, “it’s a pretty thing. Well, that's me.”
“How do you mean ‘that's me'?”
“Don’t you see it's written ‘to a constituent '2 Well,
I'm the constituent.”
“My dear Sir,” I cried, “I congratulate you. To be a
Welshman is a great thing; to live in Carnarvon is a gift
from heaven; and to be a constituent of the MINISTER of
MUNITIONs must be the summit of earthly felicity,” and I
seized his hand and shook it warmly.
“Lord love you,” he said, disengaging himself, “how you
do jump at conclusions! I'm no Welshman ; I've never
been near Carnarvon; and of course, in a technical sense,
I'm not a constituent of LLoyd GEORGE's. I'm an accom-
modation constituent, that's all. Generally I’m ‘a corres-
pondent'—I've done a lot of work for A. J. BALFour in
that line—but this time I thought I'd try a new touch
and so I turned myself into a constituent. It's gone off
splendidly, hasn't it?”
“Ye—es,” I said, “but I don't quite—”
“Don't you see?” he said. “When one of these big.
bugs wants to explain something or have a whack at some-
body and there's a hurry about it, he doesn't wait until his
next speech. He just gets down and writes a letter. But
the letter must be written to somebody—you can't sit down
and begin ‘My dear Sir' with any conviction unless there's
a real dear Sir' somewhere at the back of it all, and that's
where I come in. I lend just the necessary amount of
reality to the whole thing.”
“Have you been at the business long 2" I said.
“Ever since I left school. It's been handed down in
our family from father to son for years and years. My own
youngster's just started in the Midland Members of Parlia-
ment department. He 's showing a lot of promise. Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN thinks a good deal of him ; but of
course, being in the Cabinet, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN mostly
works through me. His father was a regular gold mine to
us, especially during the fiscal controversy; but there was
no end of explaining going on then and we were kept very
busy.”
“I don't quite see,” I said, “where you make your
profits.”
“Oh, that's easy. We get the originals of the letters,
and after a time we sell them, mostly in America. There's
a big market for that sort of thing there. Of course the
prices don't run quite so high since type-writers came in,
but it's fairly steady all the same. Anyhow, it keeps me
in beef and beer and pudding, and you can't want more
than that, can you?”
Actually, of course, I could ; but at this moment we
drew up at Paddington and I left it at that.

Involved no fiscal problems that were serious or acute,
My wardrobe was a constant source of family dispute.
Against my passion for old clothes my estimable wife,
Supported by my daughters, waged a never-ending strife;
It was, indeed, almost the only worry of my life.
They used to hide away my old unfashionable tweeds,
Oblivious of my comfort and regardless of my needs;
They banned my pipe, but never once objected to my weeds.
My ancient ties of faded dyes excited their disdain;
My threadbare dinner-jacket caused them veritable pain;
And they criticised my boots in language less polite than
plain.
They heaped sarcastic obloquy upon my caps and hats;
They made me birthday presents of the most expensive spats,
And the latest thing in handkerchiefs, in collars and cravats.
In short in half-a-dozen ways they diligently “biffed"
My laudable intentions to promote domestic thrift,
Until the struggle threatened to produce a serious rift.
But War, though vilely fruitful in sorrow and distress,
For one small salutary change I am inclined to bless;
At last I am allowed a perfect latitude in dress.
My ancient clothes, misshapen boots, disreputable ties
No longer find disfavour in my wife's and daughters' eyes,
But, on the contrary, evoke their warmest eulogies.
Nay, better still, themselves released from giddy Fashion's
goad,
They follow me with docile steps along the frugal road
That leads to perfect freedom from the tyranny of Mode.

extra pressure which might produce the desired retreat.

Proprietor of Cinema. “YEs
ExcITING TIMEs—EH 2''
AND MY BUSINESS RUINED BY THESE HUNS GIVING A FREE show of THEIR own.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ſ TARE it that Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT designed his new
novel The Little Iliad (HEINEMANN) frankly as a grotesque,
an opinion in which four exceedingly quaint illustrations by
Sir PHILIP BURNE-Jones distinctly confirm me. The story
is in quite an original vein, the interest and mystery very
adroitly sustained. We are given a gruesome picture of a
physically wrecked but still indomitable sensualist, de-
plorably dragging shuffling feet—a Baron von Broderode,
married to a very beautiful and gracious woman who had
been caught young from out a convent. Enter Hector
Malleson, an egregious sentimentalist, heir incidentally of a
Highland chieftain. He diagnoses an Andromeda-dragon
situation, a thought which apparently had not occurred to
the Baroness, who however cordially accepts the suggestion
and is made profoundly miserable. Eventually she flies
and finds asylum at the head-quarters of the Malleson clan,
where three other sons of the house, as also the old chieftain
himself, fall hopelessly in love with her. Comes the relent-
less Baron in pursuit; and how this modern MENELAUs first
wins, then loses the game, and where the fair Helena finally
bestows her widowed hand, I must leave Mr. HEwleTT's
diverting little Iliad to inform you. I can promise you good
entertainment; and though, as I have hinted, the thing is
planned in a freakish mood the author has not let himself
off the honest labour of construction and polish. His
sympathies are throughout with his wicked Baron, who is a
very new version of the strong silent hero, and may fairly
be considered a sport. What I refuse to believe about him
is that, even though he shot from a pony cart, he “got his
gun up like lightning and fired at the instant,” consider-
ing the painful struggles he had to get his wine-glass or
cigar accurately to his mouth—pathological details that
Mr. HEwleTT has been at pains to rub well in.
Something will really have to be done about it. If many
more of our novelists take to turning out these prodigiously
long stories, we reviewers will have to agitate for payment
by piece-work. The latest exponent of the gentle art of
garrulity is Mr. E. TEMPLE THURSTON, with his new novel,
The Achievement of Richard Furlong (CHAPMAN AND HALL).
There are seven hundred and twenty-eight pages of it, so
that when you have turned the last of them you may
perhaps feel that the achievement is not exclusively con-
fined to the hero. Richard Furlong was a painter and
etcher, and the object of Mr. THURSTON is to trace his
progress from obscurity to fame; but, though he is repre-
sented as doing a lot of artistic work in his spare time, it
would be more fair to say that the real successes of Richard
were gained in the domain of what I might call (wishing to
put the matter as delicately as possible) unceremonious
polygamy. From the moment when he runs away from
the paternal mill, and joins the company of Mr. THURSTON's
other heroes in a picturesque slum-existence round about
Drury Lane, his career becomes a sentimental journey from
one affair to another. I don't want to say that there are

[SEPTEMBER 29, 1915.
not pleasant passages in the book—there is always a certain
jollity in a tale of success—but I do think that justice
could have been done to the theme in a smaller compass.
In his preface Mr. THURSTON tells how he came to abandon
his intention of publishing three separate books about
Richard Furlong's history, and to bind them instead into
one volume. My only comment on this is that it remains
true that three of his furlongs make at least a mile.
During the last twenty years Sir GILBERT PARKER has
written a dozen novels. At such a stage fancy is accus-
tomed to flag, and kind-hearted friends are apt to regret that
the author has “written himself out.” This makes more
pleasant the discovery that in The Money Master (HUTCH-
INSoN) Sir GILBERT surpasses himself. The story opens with
ever done before the American ideal of Bigness—its obvious
faults and its less obvious merits. “We must be Bigger!
Bigger! Bigger! Get people here! Coax them here! Swindle
them into coming! Deafen them into coming ! Any kind of
people! Blow ! Boost Brag We must be Bigger! We
want Bigness!” That was the motto of the town in which
Bibbs Sheridan lived, and it was the motto of James Sheridan,
his father; and Bibbs, by nature a poet and a dreamer of
dreams, found himself forced by circumstances to kill his
dreams and plunge in and blow and boost and brag with
the rest, until at length there came to hearten him the

POSSIBLE AUTHORITY.”
PEOPLE WE NEVER MEET.
THE MAN WHO SAYs, “I HAVE IT on THE worsT
ductions which it resembles only
in its popularity. It is easily the
best novel that Mr. TARKINGTON
has written. There are flashes of
the humour that illumined his
Penrod stories, but for the most
part the author is grimly in earnest,
as befits his theme. It is a story
to be read by all who would un-
derstand the soul of the country
that has produced sky-scrapers
and Pittsburg and the Chicago
slaughter - houses. “Man alive!
this is God's country, and a blind
man couldn't help seein’ it ! You
certainly stand up for your own
town, if you stick to sayin' you'd
rather live there than you would
here. You sure are some patriot
to say that—after you've seen our
city. I'll show you something
now that 'll make your eyes stick
out.” Thus Mr. James Sheridan
to a European visitor, and that is
America in a nutshell.
There is real stuff—as opposed
to stuffing—in Miss M. P. WILL-
cocks' Change (HUTCHINsoN). In
truth her material is better than
her pattern, which is rather casual
and formless. She leaves loose
threads, abandons even promising
dealer, his dross purified in the fire of adversity, is slowly,
step by step, transformed into a hero of sublime unselfish-
ness. Nearly every page of the story, certainly every
chapter, reveals the inventive resources of the author.
These never fail, and the reader is, with growing interest,
hurried on to the unexpected dénouement. The world of
Jean Jacques, a village which the censor may permit refer-
ence to as “somewhere in the neighbourhood" of Quebec,
is peopled with a diversity of characters whose acquaint-
ance and environment are refreshing after a long course of
ordinary novels.
A grievance that the American has against Englishmen
is that they pay visits to his country and then try to put
it all into a single book. He holds that America is too
large a thing to be put into a single book. Yet in Turmoil
(Hodder AND Stoughton) Booth TARRINGTON has come
very near succeeding in this feat. Turmoil, for all that it
has only three hundred and twelve pages, covers the whole
of one side—and that the most characteristic side—of
American life. It puts into words better than anyone has
beginnings, certainly crowds her embroidery frame with
too many figures. But you read her story and comment
without skipping, get pleasure of her characters, who really
seem to be alive and doing, and (I'll answer for it) you'll
be willing to put up with little defects of form for sake of
such fine substance as the patient and indirect wooing of
little brown Bess Latimer, the orphan, by the Professor—a
charming piece of delicate romance. There is a background
of Starrs, folk whose blood was older and bluer than their
purses were long, and who were a little too conscious of
other people's essential inferiority. It is part of the defect
of Miss WILLCocks' method that one can't make out just
what the “change” was which one supposes from her title
to be the motive of her work. She gives me the impression
of not having quite found herself even yet. But she will;
and meanwhile she has the heart of the matter in her.
“We are told that Delilah punctured the head of Samson with a
mail.”—China Mail. . . .
The other story of how poor SISERA had his hair cropped
is just as good.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THE KAISER.
I EveR regard his case as odd
Who ventures to doubt that I'm a god;
Few, in fact, can distinguish me
From my friend and double, the Deity;
Yet I cannot behave like a fowl in air,
I cannot at once be everywhere.
Limited thus, I must needs decide
Where I would spend last Christmastide;
Various pleasant schemes I had—
Paris and London and Petrograd—
But I couldn't have painted them all three red,
So I finally stayed at home instead.
Now Yule is on us again and I'm
Still bound by the laws of space and time;
My heart, like a common man's, is torn
Between the above and the Golden Horn,
With matins under a Moslem dome;
But how can I do all four—(and Rome) 2
Meanwhile it's bad for my beauty rest
(East being East and West still West)
If I'm expected to bear the brunts.
Arising out of a brace of fronts,
Neither of which—from a distant view—
Is doing as well as I told it to.
I find the travelling most severe,
Though I only do it from rear to rear;
And often enough has the wish occurred
That I could arrange to be a bird;
And it’s “Oh 1” I cry with my godlike voice,
“Oh for the wings—of a dove, for choice.”
O. S.
ADMIRAL POST.
“You’ve heard of ‘General Post,' haven't you?” said
Jack to Cheeks, the marine. “Well, the KAISER has invented
a new game called ‘Admiral Post.’ In the first place let
me tell you what I been reading in the paper about Admiral
voN HoltzENDoRFF, followin' on the sensational departure
for other scenes of Admiral voN TIRPITz. Now to be quite
frank with you, you being only a marine, I'm gettin' qualms
about the German Navy. They're threatened with a cer-
tain liveliness, Cheeks, they are. -
“You see this voN HoltzENDoRFF used to command the
High Seas Fleet just before the War. He was a fair oner
for paint work and leadin' the line at reviews. For the
pipin' days of peace he was absolutely It. But when the
War broke out the KAISER gets a sort of grouch on voN
HoltzENDoRFF and drops him for another feller called voN
INGENOHL.” -
“’ Ow do you come to know these names?” asks Cheeks.
“I was just reading them in the paper,” says Jack.
“Well, all the world knows now what voN INGENOHL did.
For months and months there was only one navy in the
world, and voN SPEE's little lot and the Emden and the
Bloocher and all the other victories was celebrated in Berlin
in the correct style, all school-children being ordered to get
hoarse by compulsion. But one day, when the KAISER was
counting his ships, he says to voN INGENOHL, he says,
‘Where's my Bloocher 2' And the gallant Admiral replies
that the Bloocher has been converted into a Dreadnought
submarine. Which is what they call a half-truth, and not
bad for a German. Then the KAISER gives voN INGENOHL a
nasty look, and says to him, ‘You can slide it. I'm going
to give the command to voN PoHL.’”
“You're making it up,” says Cheeks.
“Gospel truth, I ain't. I just read it in the paper.”
“'Ow do all these blokes' names come to begin with a
Von 2 ”
“If you wasn't an ignorant marine you'd know that von
is German for O'. I was once in a destroyer and we had eight
O's on board, Irish all of 'em. There was O'Flaherty,
O'Connor, O'Hara, O'Donovan and O'Reilly, and so on.
If they'd been Germans they'd have been von Flaherty,
von Connor, von Hara, etcetery—see? Where was I?
We'd got to von PoHL.
“Well, von Pohl, turned out to be the very man for the
job, and the KAISER was fair off his nut with joy about
him. He'd got the High Seas Fleet in grand order, and
there it was dashin' up and down the Kiel Canal, grittin'
its teeth, firin' birthday salutes and waitin' for the Day.
“The KAISER went down to Kiel for all his week-ends so
as to give away the iron crosses to the submarine crews
before they go West, and they say, Cheeks, as his admira-
tion for von PoHL had no bounds.
“Well, the last time he was there, musin' to himself on
the shore and wavin' his hand to the barges goin' down to
Wilhelmshaven for more anchors, he had a happy thought.
His active brain turned in the direction of Admiral voN
HoltzENDoRFF. - -
“Now you got to understand that voN Holtz, ever since
he got the push and his pension, had been livin' the life of
a simple German gentleman in Berlin. As far as can be
gathered, he behaved no different to nobody. He planted
taters in his window-boxes, he wrote to the papers, signing
himself ‘Too old at 84,’ and he sung the ‘Hymn of Hate'
before and after meals, just like everybody else who has to
subscribe to the War Loan.
“One fine mornin' he gets a wire from his Imperial
Master: “Allis forgiven. Can find you a new job.' That was
at 9 A.M.; and you can bet, Cheeks, that, grabbin' up his
telescope and pack o' patience cards, he caught the 9.40
all right. .
“The KAISER was all affability. He sends for Admiral
BACHMANN, who's the head of the Naval General Staff.
‘BACHMANN,' he says, “you thick-headed numskull, what's
this I hear about your plannin' another triumphant attack
on the fortifications of Scarborough 2' ‘It’s not me,’ says
BACHMANN, ‘it’s my fool of a vice-chief, BEHNCKE.’ ‘Then
you both take the push,’ says the KAISER. Whereupon turn-
ing to our old friend, voN HoltzENDoRFF, he says, hardly
able to keep the tears gushin' from his eyes, ‘You’re about
the biggest back number in the country, HoltzEY, and it's
up to me to give you the softest job that's going. You're
appointed Chief of the Naval General Staff,' he says;
‘and you can name your own Vice-Chief,' he adds, “vicey
that reckless feller BEHNCKE.' Well, HoltzEY votes for
voN Koch, who was friends with him in the old days
when the German Navy used to have Cinderellas on the
quarter-deck and knew nothin' of the horrors of war.
And that's how it stands now, Cheeks.”
“It don't give me no qualms, Jack,” says Cheeks.
“Well, I dunno. Here's this voN HoltzENDoRFF, who
used to command the Battle Fleet in the days when there
were no battles, succeeded first by voN INGENOHL and then
by voN Pohl, and then as a crownin' disgrace shoved
along with his pal voN Koch into the Naval General Staff
vicey BAcHMANN and BEHNCKE. It may not be lettin'
loose the dogs of war, Cheeks, m’lad, but it looks very
much to me as if the German fleet is goin' to hold a regatta "

REGIMENT HAs A BATTLE on FOR THE WEEK-END.”
ON BELLONA'S HEM.
THE RULING PAssion.
WE were crossing from Portsmouth
to Ryde. The almost horizontal rain
from the indigo cloud drove us all under
cover, and I found myself beneath the
captain's bridge, packed hard against
two lieutenants. Hence if I became
a listener to their confidences the
offence must be charged not to any
wish of mine to eavesdrop but to the
vagaries of the English August.
Yet no secret of warfare did they
unfold. In fact, but for their khaki and
their puttees and their canes, they might
still have been conversationalists in the
piping times of peace.
Having dismissed the weather with
their best but inadequate adjectives,
they turned to the real topic of interest
for the young and spirited officer—the
mo-bike. One of them had a mo-bike
on the island and was going to fetch it
back; the other had a mo-bike on the
mainland, and was, for the day, being
dragged sadly from it. Each had had
astonishing experiences which they re-
lated so eagerly against the other's that
neither story was ever quite finished,
or rather, as in some of the magazines,
both deeided, to be so careless about
the first instalment of the new one ran
concurrently with the last of the old.
It was wonderful what resources
each had extracted from his jigger. A
tragedy, however, hung over the one
whose jigger was on the mainland; for,
would you believe it, that young ass So-
and-so (I know his name, but mercifully
suppress it) had missed parade so often
owing to his smash-ups that anyone
else who defected from a similar cause
was to be forbidden to ride one again.
It was a pity that asses like So-and-so
ever got into a regiment; but on the
whole the speaker could not deny that
their crowd was a jolly decent one.
Still, it would be a foul thing if mo-
bikes were stopped.
But for some trouble once with the
carburetter, the other speaker's mo-bike
had never let him down yet, and it
was second-hand too. Nor had his
friend much fault to find with his,
except that it was such a whale for oil.
It was jolly decent of the police, they
the speed limit now, but then of course
they never know whether or not one is
on duty: one of the good points about
khaki. Had the other ever clapped
eyes on old Blank (I have his name
too) on his Regal? Talk about a flyer.
Never stopped for anyone, even in the
town. A bit rotten, the speaker thought
that. One ought to have some con-
sideration, dash it all! Yes, the other
agreed, of course one ought. But out in
the country let her rip. “Absolutely,”
said the other.
“Last Sunday,” said the first, “I went
to see my people. Forty miles an hour
or over if I was doing an inch . . .”
“Forty-two I was doing for a bit on
Friday,” said his friend, “until a string
of A.S.C. lorries pulled me up. Con-
found them | It was between . . .”
But here the sun came out and I
returned to the open deck.

hope that a career of such high promise
has not been cut short.

PUNCH,
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
XI.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-A few men
from the detachment have of late been
transferred to the hill station and sub-
stitutes sent down. Among the former
was our popular Company º
Major, who received a pleasant surprise
in the shape of a procession, which
escorted him to the outer gate of the
Fort, bearing banners of very strange
devices and accompanied by a band.
The band rendered the Regimental
March on three mouth-organs, an en-
trenching tool and twenty-two washing
basins. The whole procession sang a
chorus written specially for the occasion
and set to the tune of a popular hymn
—simple and haunting words which
must have brought tears to his eyes:—
Sergeant-Major's going to the mou-ou-
ountains,
Sergeant-Major's going to the mou-ou-
ountains,
Sergeant-Major's going to the mou-ou-
ountains,
He couldn't stick the summer on the Plains.
This unaccustomed excitement over,
we resumed our normal dull existence,
under conditions which render it prac-
tically impossible for us to do any
military training or to acquire any
soldierly qualities beyond a prodigious
development of language. One wonders
what will happen in respectable British
homes after the War, when moments
of excitement lead to lapses into army
speech.

[October 6, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BUNGAY LOWE AND THE B00KSTALL-MAN.
I cAME upon them at that hour when
one is most sensitive to the uncon-
genial; just before the day's work. To
the bookstall-man I daresay I am even
more irritating than he to me. Since
the War began and brought with it the
minor blessing of the truce to one's
political passions, I have been a casual
instead of a regular customer, buying
varieties of newspapers I would not
have been seen dead with in times of
peace. Moreover I think the bookstall-
man has begun to suspect that my
slender purchases are largely made
with a view to providing myself with
the supply of coppers that come in so
useful at odd times of the day; and he
hates being asked for change. At any
rate he's always rude to me if an
opportunity occurs. The other day I
thought to find favour with him by
asking for a book. I said, “Have you
Candytuft—I mean Veronica 2"
It was a real name, but unusual.
He made me repeat it, and then said
roughly, “When you know what you
do mean, I'll see if I've got it; ” and
I retaliated by making him change me
a half-crown for a halfpenny paper.
Parenthetically, I wonder why authors
sometimes let their progeny go forth
with such tormenting names. That
otherwise undeniable classic, The Cast-
ing Away of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.
Aleshine, is a case in point. Good
serviceable hard-wearing titles, ready
shrunk, requiring just a medium educa-
tion to understand, and not too much
moral courage to ask for, ought to be
easily procurable. Facility in putting
them together is not hard to acquire,
and may be a most useful accomplish-
ment, as I found in dealing with
Bungay Lowe.
Bungay Lowe as often as not travels
up to town with me. If he would only
talk about the weather I could stand it,
but he is one of those fatuous people
who consider that English weather is a
threadbare topic. He reads, it is true,
but he cannot refrain from reading pas-
sages aloud. They are generally such
things as letters he himself has written
to the newspapers, or the academic
pleasantries of Mr. BERTRAND RUssBLL.
He runs a debating society somewhere
Hampstead way, and is more than
suspected of rehearsing bits of his
speeches in his ordinary conver-
sation. When I say that since the war
began his debating activities have
apparently doubled, I think I am
delineating his character as fully as
any of my readers can possibly wish,
so when, a few mornings ago, I
arrived early at the station and saw
Bungay Lowe at the other end of the
platform awaiting me, I took temporary
refuge at the bookstall, where my other
enemy was in a particularly curt and
uncivil mood and muttered curses over
fivepence-halfpenny. I then advanced
under cover of The Daily Screen and
was incontinently caught.
Bungay Lowe's breast-pocket was
bulging with manuscript, and I was
soon fated to know that he had on him
the notes of the speech that he was to
deliver that evening. I must let him
read me some extracts on the way up ;
I might make some valuable sugges-
tions and perhaps help him out with
a quotation or two. What was the
motion to be debated 2 Oh, well, it
wasn't a debate exactly; he was giving
them a paper entitled, “Are we quite
fair to the Germans ?” There would
be a discussion, perhaps, but no division.
I have a somewhat confused remem-
brance of what followed in that walk
up and down the platform with Bungay
lowe. I recall that he asked me if I
did not think it was our sacred duty as
Englishmen to try honestly to arrive
at the point of view of the Germans;
and, assuming the German point of view
to be somewhere the other side of the
Rhine, I cordially agreed, adding, “By
whatever way round,” a phrase which
he immediately jotted down. He then
asked me if any rational being who
knew anything of Germany could
credit half the stories of atrocities in
Belgium and France. I waxed eloquent
again and said that there was no single
authentic recorded instance of German
soldiers having cooked and eaten an
enemy civilian. That, I added, was a
proof of truly remarkable powers of
self - restraint. All this was duly re-
corded and no doubt worked up into a
point. We were getting on finely,
but I doubted my power to keep
it up during the impending journey,
which I much dreaded. Suddenly an
inspiration came to me. The train
was not yet quite due, but no time was
to be lost.
“Of course you've read those little
books by “Jingo'-an ironical pseudo-
nym, as you will guess—that bear so
admirably upon your purpose?” I
asked. “No 2 My good man, they're
full of what you want. Quaint bits of
Shavian philosophy expressed in won-
derful sentences. Not read them or even
heard of them 2 Get them at once.
Let me see, there are three in a definite
sequence. Change for a Sovereign :
you can see what that's about—the
case for democratic control could not be
more admirably presented. A Penny-
worth of Manners; that's an open
letter to a diplomatist, who with a
ha'porth more could have saved the
situation. And, lastly, A German
Mother, a wonderful picture of the
domestic virtues of the enemy we are
so ruthlessly waging war upon. Our
friend at the bookstall might have one
of them—you can but try. Remember
the order: Change for a Sovereign; A
Pennyworth of Manners; A German
Mother.”
The signal went down as Bungay
Lowe sought the bookstall. I watched.
He had to wait a minute or two, and
then I could see his irritating profile as
he enunciated with the ghastly distinct-
ness which I have always found to be so
exasperating, and which with inferiors
always suggests a hidden intention
of sarcasm, the three enquiries I had, I
flatter myself, so ingeniously framed
for him.
The first two evidently drew blanks.
At the third there was some sort of
upheaval in the bookstall. Bungay
Lowe stepped suddenly back and a
small but interested crowd gathered.
What followed appeared, as far as I
could see, to partake of the triple nature
of a debate, a discussion, and a dog-
fight. I imagined Bungay Lowe to be
pointing out that there is no disparage-
ment in imputing Teutonic parentage
to any man, and he would infallibly do
so, if I know him at all, to his own
country's belittlement. He would urge
the propriety of seeing ourselves as
others see us, and this would give the
bookstall-man an obvious opening, At
any rate my immediate point was
gained. Bungay Lowe lost the train,
or at least my end of it.
WHEN THE HEROES RETURN.
LEST WE FORGET.
Mother England has been forgetful
before; Mother England has been for-
getful. I wonder if she will be forgetful
at the end of this War, when the
heroes come back. I am thinking, I
admit, of certain heroes in whom I
take a particular interest.
Before the War they were in London
and threw up, some of them, their
positions unasked.
Their places now are filled. Will
they be kept open for them against
their return ? Belgium and France
know their worth if England yet does
not. Let Belgium and let France
speak. -
Let them speak. I cannot—the sub-
ject moves me too strongly. But let
England answer, and let her answer
soon. What will she do when these
heroes come back to her? What will
the hostelries of England do when
Hans and Fritz and Carl return ?

THEY couldn't make the old chap
grasp there was a war, and, instead of
joining the little group of bent-backed
cronies outside the village estaminet,
he would sit at his window, mumbling
and grumbling. Standing arms akimbo,
in her check-patterned apron, his
daughter shouted herself hoarse. Now
she pointed to me, sipping delicious
coffee, belt unfastened, at the parlour
table; now she nodded towards the
eight-years-old grandson drilling his
squad of grimy-faced gamins outside
in the sunlit street. Grandpère merely
gaped at her; with his patched linen
blouse, felt slippers, and a beard like
Rip Van Winkle's, he was half blind,
deaf, and—as far as I could make out
—dumb.
We were in support billets that
week, going forward in working parties
for night-digging; but about an hour
before sunset this white-capped bustling
daughter had beckoned me hospitably
indoors, calling my attention, as she
poured out the coffee, to framed photo-
graphs of her three soldier sons and
her husband, who was a corporal in
a machine-gun section and looked as
though he meant business.
“Coquin "" cried she and, hastening
suddenly into the road, rescued the
snub-nosed, straight-fringed grandson
from the wheels of an A.S. motor
lorry. Leaning back, I was whistling
under my breath, mechanically rubbing
up a tunic button, when, from the
chair by the window, a slow deliberate
movement caught my eye, and—well,
believe it or not as you choose, I had
wakened Rip Van Winkle back to life.
First (though I never could convince
his daughter of it) he winked his right
eye; next, chuckling so that he showed
his toothless gums, and holding his
head an inch or two higher, he drew
down the cuff of his blouse, polishing
an imaginary button. Screwing up
his dim old eyes, he rubbed patch after
patch on that faded blue linen, and, as
if the familiar action called up Good-
ness knows what crowding memories
of youth and war, of chausses rouges
and képis, he muttered, with a sig-
nificant jerk of his head towards the
window: “A Berlin ( i Berlin "

IN that dark hour before the dawn comes thronging,

in ringing cheers when perchance

hours were alluded to. The
House, in this respect true repre-
sentative of the nation, was to all
appearance absolutely unmoved by
sudden turn in tide of war. Doggedly
meaning to go on with the business to
the end, it was no more elated by sudden
victory than it had been depressed by
long continuance of monotonous firing
from opposite trenches. It was all in

most welcome to them, in concert with

A BALLAD OF BULBS.
For several months I've striven hard to curb undue expense;
I conjugate the verb “to save” in ev'ry mood and tense;
And when Extravagance allures I sternly bid her hence.
I walk into the City, ay and back, on my ten toes;
Unhailed by me in rain or shine the flying taxi goes;
No more the merry motor-bus my solid presence knows.
I've laid a drastic ban upon the winsome cigarette;
Against the early morning tea my face I've sternly set;

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXVIII.
(From the GERMAN EMPEROR.)
MY DEAR WILLIE.—When you receive this I shall be
quite dead. Even before the outbreak of the War I had
been ailing. On August 1st, 1914, I took to my bed and
was definitely separated from you. I did not feel the
separation much ; it was no great wrench, for latterly, as
you know, I had had but little chance to distinguish
myself by any useful activity. Though we still kept up a
show of living together the strain was obviously becoming
too great to continue much longer. Then came the break,
and now, as I say, I am going. Even had the War by
some miracle been avoided I doubt if our companionship
could have been maintained. To be bullied and neglected
is never pleasant, and that was evidently the fate which
you had marked out for me. The lesson is a bitter one.
Would that I had learnt it sooner. I should have saved
myself much pain and many harsh disappointments.
As I look back upon my chequered career I ask myself
whether I was at any time sufficiently real and convincing
for the task I had undertaken to perform. Our articles of
association (if I may put it in that way) laid it down that
I was to be the good, kind, gentlemanly chivalrous family-
Emperor whose only fault was to be a taste for practical
jokes of a simple and innocent sort; while you were to play
your part in shining armour as an Olympian War-god or in
diplomatic intrigues as a modern reincarnation of MACHIA-
velLI. I was to discuss the merchant marine with Herr
BALLIN at Hamburg, while you were to plan Dreadnoughts
with voN TIRPITz at Kiel or at the Vulcan Works at Stettin.
KRUPP was to be in your department; I was to listen to
Dr. DRYANDER's sermons and talk peace-talk to the American
Ambassador. You were to review the Berlin garrison on
the Tempelhofer field and to tell recruits to shoot down
their fathers and mothers at your order; and I was to gain
a reputation for harmless levity and Imperial bonhomie by
pulling away the chair on which some portly industrial
magnate was about to seat himself. This may have been
slightly vulgar, but it was undoubtedly very funny. At any
rate the whole Court laughed most heartily whenever I
did it.
Then again there was my visit to Lord LoNSDALE with
the object of persuading the simple English that we were,
after all, a true English gentleman, fond of grouse-shooting
and all other English sports. Really I almost wished you
had yourself been present instead of me when we drove
through Cumberland with outriders and postillions, and an
escort of splendidly mounted British Yeomanry prancing
and clattering all round us. The whole affair went off
most successfully, and had excellent results. Unfortunately
the same cannot be said of the interview in which I laid
bare our heart to the London Daily Telegraph. That was
meant to please the English, but for some reason it had
the opposite effect, and besides all the Germans became
furious about it too, and the throne rocked in the storm.
The Tweedmouth letter was no more successful, but that
was yours, not mine. Nor had I anything to do with the
theatre parade to Jerusalem or with the foolish Morocco
adventure. These enterprises, like all the other insanities
of which I have not strength to write down the list, were
hatched in your brain, and, though I protested against
them, I was overborne. Can you wonder that I hailed our
separation as a release from an intolerable position ?
Well, you now have the War on which you were bent,
and all I can say is that I hope you like it. I, at any rate,
have had no part in it, and cannot be asked to bear any of
the responsibility for it. That is yours and yours alone.
You have the satisfaction of reflecting that you have put
in peril that great structure for the foundation of which
thousands of Germans gladly gave their lives. And you,
and those who have urged you on or followed you, now
stand forth before the world as men who have ruthlessly
trampled under foot all laws by which mankind sought to
mitigate ferocity, to protect the lives of the innocent and
to hold tyranny in check.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TOM LINSON'S PROGRESS.
About a fortnight after the Tomlin-
sons had taken “Rosedene’’ in our
road Miss Withers summoned a Council
of War. The Vicar's wife had of course
called on the Tomlinsons, but, as all
the world knows, vicars' wives are
nothing to go by; they have to look
up everybody, making no distinction
between the sheep and the goats. At
the Council it was unanimously decided
that the Tomlinsons were quite im-
possible.
I was not surprised; I had myself
noticed several unpleasant features
about Tomlinson. In saying this I
am not alluding particularly to his
WaS
face, which, though unattractive,
perhaps no more distressing
than hundreds of others that
one encounters in the City and
elsewhere. No, it was not so
much his appearance that was
at fault as his general social
tone. In the first place, he
made a practice from the very
beginning of rolling the grass-
plot in front of his house every
evening in his shirt sleeves and
with a pipe. It has always been
tacitly agreed in our road that
personal gardening should be
strictly confined to the backs;
fronts are done by a professional,
who visits us in turn. In the
second place, it soon became
painfully apparent that he was
addicted to the clarionet. There
are, no doubt, circles in which
went on with his rolling and his wife
continued to hang out her washing
all down the back garden with an in-
difference to public opinion that could
not have been more complete if they
had been inhabiting a desert island.
Miss Withers was very bitter about it.
“This,” she said, “is what comes of
providing the masses with cheap edu-
cation.” -
I often wondered exactly what she
meant by this remark, which struck me
as irrelevant to the situation; but she
repeated it so many times that at last
I felt sure there must be something
in it.
One day last January I met her at the
bottom of the road. “Have you heard?”
she said.
| opposite. “I suppose you have heard
about him 2"
“Yes,” I answered sympathetically.
“This is a terrible war,” she said,
and turned and walked dejectedly up
the path to her front door.
But worse was in store for her.
There was no stopping the enemy. By
the end of July he was a major; in
the middle of August he was invalided
home with a bullet wound in his leg.
And when he returned to us it was not
merely as an officer. Tomlinson came
home a V.C.
I shall never forget his arrival at
“Rosedene.” For an hour or more the
road had been filled by an excited
crowd, and when at last Tomlinson
“The man Tomlinson has appeared in a motor-car with his wife
and the General Officer com-
manding the district the en-
thusiasm became so intense
that the railings in front of
Miss Withers' house gave way
with a crash and several of the
populace were deposited among
her geraniums. I was standing
quite close to the scene of the
disaster. What would Miss
Withers do? Would she faint 2
| Would she go into hysterics?
Would she sue Tomlinson for
damages? Would she write to
the papers? I half expected to
see her rush forth upon the

my eyes away from the wreck,

not glance again in its direction.
When I did, I saw Miss Withers
on her doorstep. There was a
flush on her face, but not of rage.
Oblivious of her garden fence,
oblivious of what the road might
further than this we have never gone.
I think, however, that what really more
than anything else turned the scale
against our new neighbours was a
discovery that Miss Withers made about
them when they had only been amongst
us for a few days. She found out (how,
I know not) that Tomlinson was in the
habit of allowing his wife to address
him as “Sid.” You will now be in a
position to grasp Tomlinson. He was,
you will see, quite beyond the pale, the
sort of man, in fact, who, if you met
him and inquired after his health, would
be nearly certain to reply, “Nicely,
thanks; how 's yourself 2 "
I confess I was a little sorry for the
Tomlinsons. It is never pleasant to
feel that one is not wanted. Yet it
must be admitted that they bore up
very bravely, so bravely, indeed, that it
almost seemed as if they hardly realised
what they were missing. Tomlinson
enlisted.” It was true. Though slightly
over military age, he had prevailed
on the authorities to accept him, and
had left us to serve his King and
Country. I admired his spirit and said
so, but Miss Withers refused to share
my enthusiasm. “It is a pity they
can't take his wife too,” she said. A
little later we heard that he had gained
a commission. This time it was I who
broke the news to Miss Withers. It
was obviously a blow to her, but she
took it well. “The Army is not what
it was,” she remarked sententiously,
and changed the conversation.
passed, and then the gazette announced
that Tomlinson had been promoted to
the rank of captain. For several days
I avoided Miss Withers, and when at
length she overtook me one morning I
carefully kept off the subject. As we
parted at her gate she looked across the
road at the Tomlinsons' house just

think, she was waving in one hand
a handkerchief, in the other a small
Union Jack, and with her foot she was
beating time to the crowd's enthusiastic
rendering of “He’s a jolly good fellow.”
Then I did a foolish thing. A very
stout, phlegmatic-looking man was
standing immediately in front of me.
I took off his hat and flung it high
into the air. It was an act which sub-
sequently cost me half-a-guinea. But
I didn't care. Nothing really mattered
that afternoon.
If you happen to be going down our
road any day about 4.30 P.M., you may
possibly catch a glimpse on the lawn
behind one of the houses of a small
lady, rather past middle age, and a
short, thick-set man in khaki, who
smokes a pipe and walks with a slight
limp. It is Miss Withers and Tomlin-
son, playing croquet.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. CoNRAD of course has a way of looking on life as a
low, sneaking sort of fellow, lurking in unsuspected places
with a deadly sandbag. I suppose that in his Victory
(METHUEN) he means to show the relentlessly tragic effect
of the malevolent gossip of an evil-minded man on the
fortunes of a guileless idealist. His central figure, Aarel
Heyst, is a nobly born Swede, son of a crank, and he
inherits a paralysing philosophy of negations and distrusts
which make him by choice a hermit, a wanderer and a
man of indecision. Out of a dubious South Pacific Island
hotel, kept by one Schomberg, a loathly, bullying, envious
Teuton (an old villain of Mr. CoNRAD's and no product of
the War-spirit), Heyst carries away in pity to his lonely
home a young English girl who has fallen on evil days in
a travelling troop of singers, and is being persecuted chiefly,
but not only, by the infatuated hotel-keeper, who, eager
for revenge, by a lying tale about Heyst's treasure of ill-
gotten gold persuades two egregious scoundrels to follow
him. For myself I have to summon up all my faith in
Mr. CoNRAD's artistic sincerity to believe in any such
bizarre ruffians as the primitive and bloody Ricardo and
the languid, gentlemanly Jones. One might accept them
in Treasure Island, but in the elaborately contrived realism
of Mr. CoNRAD's setting they seem incredibly fantastic.
His perfected subtlety of method is indeed almost too
delicate a medium for the presentation of the fast and
furious riot of passion and bloodshed that Victory in the
end becomes. Nor can I help thinking that, pressing the
consequences of the Schomberg-Heyst affair far beyond
the point of decent probability, he has loaded his dice, so
to speak, and destroyed that sense of inevitability which
ought to be the dominant impression of a tragedy worked
out in this ruthlessly detailed and motived way. . . . And
having delivered this tentative judgment for conscience'
sake, let me beg of you to ignore the misgivings of an ultra-
sensitive and hand yourself over to the enjoyment of a
delicate, tender romance and as exciting a yarn as was
ever spun out of the very tough fibre of the South Sea
Islands by a master craftsman. -
Mr. HUGH WALPole displays a nice discrimination in
nurseries. This was one of my first reflections after reading
The Golden Scarecrow (CASSELL). Indeed one might adver-
tise the book thus:—“Advice to Mothers. Read this if you
wish to understand your child!” One may at least say for the
volume that it is quite unlike anything else; further, that it
is in many ways of a singular and haunting charm. Its
scope embraces a tour of the nurseries of a certain aristocratic
London square and a sympathetic study of their infant
owners. Mr. WALPole must himself be a bachelor, this class
being notoriously confirmed believers in the “trailing clouds
of glory” idea of babyhood. The type is here very pleasantly
suggested, and with a quite reverent touch of humour, in
the person of a Friend (unseen by the grown-ups of the
nurseries) whose mission it is to launch the small souls

It all depends on what you

while poor Harry, who is doing it all in his sleep, is
left more hobbledehoy than ever. If I fail to make this
quite clear to you, I may plead that Mr. MARRIOTT himself
has not been much more successful. There are agreeable
passages in the story, notably the picture of the over-
crowded Rectory in which poor double Harry was dragged
through a perplexed boyhood. And I liked the notion of
giving him an enormous hero-worship for the mysterious
Davenport. Otherwise I have, as always, an idea that the
whole subject is a little too big for treatment in the guise of
fiction. Also, since it is abundantly clear from the begin-
ning that Harry and Davenport are the same person the
laborious collection of proof is in danger of becoming weari-
some. But when all is said Mr. MARRIOTT remains a
dignified and conscientious artist, and this in an age of
slipshod writing may well excuse a superfluous page.
Mr. Michael Sampson, the hero of Little Hearts, by
MARJoRIE L. C. PICKTHALL (METHUEN), had some points
in common with The Master of Ravenswood: he was a very
indigent young gentleman who lived alone in a ruinous old
house and was waited on by a devoted but cantankerous
meaningless title of JUSTIN HUNTLY McCARTHY's latest
novel (HURST AND BLACKETT). It is the story of the life
of FRANÇois VILLON from early childhood to the moment
when he was compelled to fly from Paris after killing
PHILIPPE SERMois. Mr. McCARTHY's Willon is not the
Willon of A Lodging For The Night, but a chivalrous and
blameless Willon, so much more sinned against than sinning
that one can hardly realise that this is supposed to be the
same person whom STEVENsoN showed debating within
himself as to the advisability of knifing the good man who
had given him shelter. However, you pay your four-and-
sixpence and you take your choice. For my own part, I
thoroughly disbelieved in this latest portrait, but I enjoyed
Pretty Maids All In A Row immensely. There is a pleasant
smoothness about everything that Mr. McCARthy writes,
and he certainly has the gift of making the reader live in
the past. But the more historical novels I read, the better
I appreciate the merits of my own century. The only
people who seem to have had even a passably good time in
those days were the great nobles, and it would have been
just my luck to have been born a varlet or even a scurvy
knave.

JANET.
HERE is a description of “Janet,” a
lady rose newly arrived, extracted
quite literally from a catalogue of new
varieties just issued. We add one or
two as yet unpublished notices of
blossoms known to us all:—
“JANET (Hybrid Tea),—An ensnar-
ing or seductive rose of greatest charm,
and an unquestioned acquisition. In
colour it is of great refinement, being in
the young stage delicate egg-yolk silky
salmony flesh or golden ochre on very
delicate pearly champagne - biscuit
fawn. The thick shell-like petals tone
down to delicate but intense fawn with
intensified centre, almost chrome. A
greatly-to-be-desired-in-every-garden
rose. Its strong delicious perfume adds
much to its exquisite chasteness. The
more this rose is examined do its
beauties reveal themselves, and they
never pale. Exemplary habit, long
rigid flower-stalks on erect wood,
furnished with long oval leathery waxy
foliage. Exceptionally floriferous.”
WILLIAM (Prusso-Austrian Briar).-
An ensnaring and seductive rose of
markedly acquisitive habits. In colour
it is of great refinement, being in the
fully - expanded stage delicate break-
fast-ultramarine, submarine, eggs-and-
bacon-pan-German-pots-dam-vulgarian
or golden bagdad lucre on very delicate
turkey-red beaten-black-and-blue-in-
champagne. The thick tortoise-shell-
like rind of self- complacency tones
down to delicate but intensely self-
centred one-sided self, with an inten-
sified glory of self in the centre. A
greatly-desiring - to-be-in-everybody-
else's-garden rose. Its strong delicious
personality adds much to its exquisitely
chaste self-righteousness. The more
this rose is exposed do its beauties
reveal themselves, and they never pall
or fade. Long rigid chaste waxy side-
shoots off the wood. An exceptionally
free and continuous bloomer.
GEORGE (Welsh Bull-Dog Rose).-A
rose of the most beguiling and seduc-
tive charm and an unquestionable
national acquisition. In colour it is
of great refinement, being in the young
stage delicate leek-green your-life-or-
your-money sows-ear-silk-pursey or
golden ogre on very delicate early-in-
the-morning wines-and-spirits takes-
the-biscuit. In its later stages its
shells-and-shells-and-more-shells-like
blossoms, which are produced in ever-
increasing profusion, burst from shoots
of exceeding vigour in chaste spiral
gradations. A greatly-to-be-desired-in-
some - people's - workshops rose. Its
strongly delicious rhetorical pungency
adds much to its exquisite chasteness.
! some line of action on the
The more this rose is examined do its
beauties reveal themselves, and they
never, never fade. Habits and mannels
exemplary. Foliage long. Exceptionally
oratorically floriferous. A never-to-be-
too-much-commended British rose.
DOGS AT BAY.
CERTAIN protests against continuing
to keep pets in war time having been
made in the papers and elsewhere—
and particularly mentioning dogs—a
meeting of protest has been held at
the Canine Street Hotel in order that
art of the
threatened animals might be decided
upon.
The Chair was taken by a well-known
bob-tailed sheep-dog. Letters of regret
from Mr. BARK, the Russian Finance
Minister, Mr. Otto BEIT, and other in-
vited guests having been read, and a
careful search made for any concealed
dachshunds, one of which disguised as
a grey-hound being destroyed mem.
com., the meeting opened.
They were met, said the Chairman,
to frame a resolution that should meet
and dispose of the criticism that they
were parasites and idlers in times of
stress and economy. But first they
had, of course, to satisfy themselves,
or rather each other (Hear, hear), that
their existence was justified. For his
own part he had nothing to say on
that subject, for it was only too evident
that without his services society would
suffer. But for him, and his friend the
collie, where would be England's mut-
ton 2 Even more so, where would be
England's mutton-bones? (Sensation.)
After the expression of heart-felt emo-
tion which they had just witnessed, he
felt that he need say no more as to the
value of his own services. But what
of the others present 2 Perhaps testi-
mony would be offered, and with this
end in view he invited discussion.
(Applause.)
A Great Dane expressed his willing-
ness to do anything in the nature of
draught work, as his relatives did in
France and Belgium ; but unhappily
the laws of England did not permit of
this. He hoped that something would
speedily be done to legalise dog-labour.
(Cries of “Wow, Wow !")
A Newfoundland said that obviously
it was absurd to threaten the existence
of such as himself so long as there was
water for people to fall into and be
rescued from. (Hear, hear.) He did
not consider himself touched by the
strictures against pets.
A St. Bernard agreed with the last
speaker. It would be madness, he said,
to dispense with his services, for in
a country with such a climate as
England's you never knew when a
snowstorm might come, in which trav-
ellers would be overwhelmed and need
assistance. (Loud applause.)
A turnspit said that nothing but the
abolition of the spit made him idle.
He longed for work. (Hear, hear, and
laughter.)
Several other speakers having ex-
pressed their willingness to help human
beings in their own way—as guardians,
rat-killers, cat-hunters, and so forth–
a venerable Airedale rose and craved
the attention of the meeting for a
practical suggestion.
Man, he said, was the friend of dogs,
and dogs must all be loyal to their
masters. (Hear, hear.) He under-
stood that the present crisis had
arisen because many persons held
that they were no longer justified in
keeping and feeding useless animals.
Very well then, for his part he would
state that he intended never again to
be a burden to his owner. (Cheers.)
In future he intended to find his own
meals for himself. (Great enthusiasm.)
Rather than permit his owner, for
whom he entertained the deepest de-
votion and respect, to go to the expense
of feeding him, he should obtain his
food from next door. (Sensation.) Look-
ing at the subject dispassionately he
was bound to say that he could see
no other way out. (Loud cheers.)
Several other speakers having ex-
pressed their determination to follow
the excellent advice of the Airedale and
relieve their masters from the responsi-
bility of feeding them, a Pekinese
asked to be allowed to say a word or
two.
Speaking in Chinese through an
interpreter, she said she regretted
her inability to work, nor was she
permitted opportunities of foraging in
the basement next door; but she had
so often heard her owner say, in tones
of obvious sincerity, that life without
her, the speaker, would be unbearable,
that she considered it her duty to
continue in the house with an easy
conscience as a comfort and joy. (Loud
cheers.) And she believed that there
was not a Peek in that wonderful
gathering who did not share this view.
(Intense enthusiasm.)
At this moment a Zeppelin passing
over the Eastern Counties dropped a
lachrymatory Pom through the hotel
roof and the meeting dissolved into
tears.
A Quiet Patient.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAD-MAKERS.
I HAD always thought that in order
to make a map one had to be accom-
panied by a whole battery of theodolites,
sextants, artificial horizons, spirit-levels,
and logarithm tables. It was not until
Petherby told me that all one required
was a sheet of paper, a pencil and a
compass, that the subject in all its
naïveté began to appeal to me.
Then one morning he came round to
my house and proposed that we should
spend the day in making a map of the
neighbourhood. I explained to him
that there already existed a highly in-
genious plan of the district on view
free at the railway station, which, be-
sides indicating the principal thorough-
for the railway map was hopelessly out
of the market by War Office reckoning.
But then the poor fellow never had
Petherby's advantage of attending
lectures by an expert. He probably
never knew that in order to get the
correct relative positions of the Streat-
ham tram-depôt and the Brixton Bon
Marché, he ought to have lain down
in the puddle outside the former and
taken a fresh “North.” I attribute
my subsequent attack of gastric catarrh
solely to my conscientious observance
of this very necessary detail. But I
bore my suffering bravely in the know-
ledge that the Bon Marché is really
347 paces easter than most people
think. We discovered other discre-
pancies of a more or less serious nature,
“How would it be,” I suggested,
“to give the compass a day off, and
bring your aneroid 2 Then all we
shall have to do will be to climb to the
summit—somehow—and look at the
instrument, when it will at once tell
us how high we are above sea-level.”
“How does it do that 2" asked
Petherby sarcastically. “Does it chime
the number of feet, or does a cuckoo
emerge from a door in the dial and
cuck it 2."
“I don't know how it tells the
altitude,” I said, “but it does. Aero-
nauts always use one to calculate
their height from the ground, and I
daresay that's how those Zeppelin
chaps know when they're low enough

interest, showed how, i.
changing trains only eleven
times, it was possible to travel
subterraneously from Bow
Road to Golder's Green vid
Kennington Oval without ever
coming up to (as the Londoners
say) breave.
“We can do better than
that,” said Petherby, and we
started.
We had some trouble at first
with Petherby's compass. 2.
After spending the whole
morning in making a map of
the wild solitudes of Tooting -
Bec we discovered that the
needle didn't point North. In
fact, it had taken up a perma-
nent sou'-sou'-westerly aspect.
As a guide to the North Pole I
would just as soon have em.
ployed a hot cross bun, ºr

baby.”
“I could have told them
they were low enough down to
do that without appealing to
an aneroid,” said Petherby.
“Of course,” I continued,
“the drawback is that if we
make our observation at low
tide we shall be much higher
up than if we took it at high
tide.”
“I’ve got to attend a lecture
to - morrow morning,” said
Petherby, “ and I'll ask the
lecturer for a simple homely
recipe for calculating alti-
ſtudes. , Ten to one he'll
know of some method which
will be as easy as pie.”
My own experience of pie
is that it is almost invariably
hard. I told Petherby so.
And I said I could think of a
very simple way.
“Well,” said he on a note
erby if he thought that the magnetic
pole had through constant use lost
its efficacy. But Petherby said no;
it had not hitherto exhibited signs
of exhaustion. Then I suggested
to my friend that possibly he had
omitted to wind the compass up over
night and that it had run down.
1'etherby, on the other hand, suggested
some unwarranted aspersions on my
mental stability, and laid the blame
of the disaster upon a biscuit-crumb
which had worked its way in between
the glass and the dial. If ever Petherby
(usually the most orderly and punctili-
ous of Special Constables) gets court-
martialled and sentenced to be shot at
cock-crow, it will be entirely owing to
his deplorable habit of carrying his
compass in the same pocket with his
emergency rations.
The trouble being at length rectified
we got to work in earnest, and the
final results we achieved showed un-
deniably that whoever was responsible
chief among which was the lamentable
omission in the station map of the
road in which the house was where
those two pseudo-refugee ladies were
found shaving one morning recently
and—however, you know the story.
I only mentioned it because the affair
took place in the house of some friends
of some friends of Petherby's, and thus
I am in a measure personally con-
nected with the episode.
On our way home late that afternoon
Petherby drew my attention to a tall
chimney. It belonged to a tea com-
pany, though I can't think why a tea-
works should require a structure of such
altitude, unless for the making of high
tea.
“We'll come here to-morrow after-
noon,” said Petherby with enthusiasm,
“and work out the height of that
chimney. I'm not quite sure how to
set about it. It seems almost too
severe a task for the capabilities of a
mere compass.”
of irony, “if you can think of it be-
tween now and to-morrow aſternoon
I shall be obliged if you will let me
know.” I promised faithfully, and we
parted.
By the last post that night I sent
Petherby a brief note. “Never mind
about asking your lecturer,” I wrote.
“The chimney's 78 feet high. After
we separated I thought of a very
simple way of making the calculation.
I walked back to the tea-works and
asked.”
From the report of a dairymen's
conference:–
“The Chairman said he would be sorry to
take drastic steps, but he felt that they should
take the bull by the horns and say point blank
that there would be no milk delivered in the
metropolitan area at 24d.”
Adelaide Advertiser.
The bull, we suppose, was to pass
on this vital information to his lady
friends.

A PAIR OF BRACES.
ShopPING in France is always a
pleasure. The shop people are so
gracious and appreciative of my lin-
guistic efforts. My friends say I
overrate my knowledge of French, but
in the main that is their jealousy. If
I have not the vocabulary I have a
wealth of gesture which I consider is
truly Gallie but my friends insist
is merely simian. Be that as it may,
when David asked me to join him
and give him a hand in buying a pair
of braces in I at once agreed
without disclosing that the French for
braces was as little known to me as the
Sanskrit term for that necessary article.
(For those of you who don't know
Sanskrit I may explain that the San-
skritians didn't wear trousers.)
“Bon jour, Madame,” I said, bowing
gracefully. (The best of writing a
thing about oneself is that full justice
can be done to one's personal graces
and accomplishments.)
“B” jour, Monsieur,” she said.
“S'il vous plait, Madame,” I con-
tinued with my pleasant smile, “mon
ami désire des braces (day brass).”
She looked blank, and her assistants
looked blanker but interested. I pon-
dered. “Des braces" obviously should
be the proper phrase, and the sooner
they learned it the better.
“Des braces, Madame, s'il vous
plait,” I repeated firmly and in a louder
voice. I wanted to show her I was not
to be trifled with.
“Mais il n'y a pas de tel mot,
Monsieur. Ne comprend pas.”
“Mais oui, Madame,” I insisted,
“des braces.” David here tried to
make a noise like a pair of braces but
was unsuccessful, and it was up to me
again. As I was wearing the kilt I
could not show her my own. Instead,
I opened my tunic and tapped my
breast on both sides.
“Ah oui, Monsieur,” she cried,
delighted, as she produced the French
equivalent for Keating's Powder.
My position as an interpreter was
shaken to its very foundations, so I
braced myself [Horrible.—ED.] to a
final effort.
“Madame, Monsieur mon amidésire
quelque chose vite pour défendre tomber
ses pantalons,” I cried, waving my
hands after the manner of the country.
“Mais oui, Monsieur,” she gasped
between her shrieks of laughter, “des
bretelles, des bretelles l’’
Of course my friends say the correct
word was “empêcher,” but I maintain
there is an imperative note and a
demand for good quality in a request
for something which will actually
“forbid” one's trousers to come down.

AT THE FRONT.
THESE be stirring times. I remem-
ber well how, in the summer of 1915,
we used to envy the company chosen
to occupy the lump of line we now
cherish so reluctantly. Under the
shadow of the poppy-strewn corn the
C.O. and an odd General or two would
drop in for a bit of lunch with the
Company Commander of Willow Walk;
and on its stately verandahs was en-
joyed many a feast of walnuts, wine,
strawberries, meat and vegetable
rations, and sunburnt mirth.
Time can never let a good thing
alone. When we came in five days ago
we did not indeed expect sunburnt mirth.
Four days' consecutive rain militated
against mirth or sunburn. But we
had hopes of finding Willow Walk the
same haunt of ancient peace it had
been of yore.
It was not.
It appears that the morning before
we arrived the Willow Walk company
had, at the instigation of some heart-
less General, suddenly put on all the
appearance of a body of desperate men
on the point of an attack. They fired
off their rifles regardless of the fact
that you cannot turn out small arm
ammunition under a penny a round.
They screamed defiance in expeditionary
French and forceful English ; and to
top up with they let off a lot of horrid
black smoke-bombs in the direction of
the German trenches.
These playful acts, coming as they
did from the cloistered avenues of
Willow Walk, completely unnerved the
Germans, who had been a good deal
attacked in other places the day before.
We thus diverted a lot of valuable
artillery. The boly willows were
ripped, torn and blown up. By dint of
hitting nearly every inch of ground
within a five hundred yards square,
hostile artillery scored several direct
bulls on the trenches therein contained.
When I say several I mean some.
When I say some I mean you could
see it had been trenches once, even if
you hadn't known.
I arrived while the echo of the last
shell of the day was still resounding,
put my platoon down for a minute in
what looked like a bit of ploughed field
with some planks sticking out of it,
told them to make themselves nice and
comfortable for the night, and went
back to the mess dug-out to consider
our prospects. I liked the mess dug-
out. It was such a very cohesive
conglomerate of protective appurten-
ances, it looked as if it would hate to
break the set for anything under a
nine-inch shell. It made me feel
almost averagely brave.
I went back and reconsidered my
trench. It didn't look so bad after all,
once the sentries were posted and the
N.C.O.'s mess had made tea. Anyone
who really knows will tell you that tea
is the dominating factor in this war.
So I had tea, got the platoon plumbers
and decorators to supervise necessary
repairs, and turned as far in as circum-
stances allowed.
Next morning I awoke with a crash.
I was shocked without being surprised.
I dressed (i.e. put my cap on) hastily
and went to see what it was about. It
was, it seemed, only a trench mortar.
I flatter myself I can be as unconcerned
as anybody over a trench mortar I'm
out of range of. I was just working
up my most unconcerned manner when
something came along very quickly
and threw a section of my parapet
over my parados. Similar incidents
marred a magnificent day up till lunch-
time. On the second day the Bosch
lost his appetite for parapet-pushing
by breakfast-time. Thereafter we had
long oases of peacefulness that almost
recalled the long dead days of summer.
The Bosch had at last assured himself
that we were not going to attack yet
for a day or two. -
Our stay in Willow Walk will be
memorable, not so much for the fact
that it rained exactly from “stand
to " at night to “stand to " at dawn
as for the promotion of several promis-
ing young officers, who, including
myself, shall be nameless; and more
especially for the inadvertence of a
certain promising young officer's ser-
vant who, being given two extra stars
to sew on to his master's jacket, so
disposed them that the said master,
on donning the jacket, was revealed
as a second lieutenant on his left
arm and a captain on his right. It is
to be regretted that not even the
additional offers of a field-marshal's
baton and a good conduct stripe would
persuade the officer to retain this
striking and original constellation.
VEG.
I Noticed some time ago that some-
body expressed a wish, in the columns
of Punch, that he had a turnip of his
OWn.
Curiously enough, I lately conceived
a somewhat similar longing, namely,
to possess a vegetable marrow, body
and soul. And at last I have realised
my ambition. I am the somewhat
proud owner of a full-sized marrow.
Very little, so far as I can gather, is
known about marrows, their nature
and habits, outside of gardening and
culinary circles. As household pets
they are in small esteem, though they
give little or no trouble until their
second childhood.
I saw no reference to them in the
paragraphs which have recently ap-
peared in The Daily Chronicle relating
to the collective names of and the
sounds emitted by certain creatures,
and I was therefore interested to learn
from another source that not only are
marrows gregarious, but that collec-
tively, when alive, they are termed a
“bream,” but when gathered and killed
for eating they immediately become a
“tod.” Their note, heard only in the
Spring, and then but rarely, at any
rate in these Northern latitudes, is
spoken of as a “chirp.”
I have had my marrow from seed-
hood. The seedsman from whom I
purchased him would not sell me just
one seed, as I wanted him to do; he
insisted on my buying a packet.
I could not possibly do with several
bream of marrows, so I picked out
Randolph, as I christened him there
and then, from the packet, and planted
him. I tried to give the rest of the
packet away, but no one seemed to
want it, so I eventually threw it in the
road.
I watered Randolph, tended him care.
fully, and when he made his appearance
I watched him daily growing more and
more like a Zeppelin. At one time,
for a day or two, I thought he was
going to turn into a water melon, and
I encouraged him to soar. But, alas,
it was only a fit of youthful swank.
When he was about half grown,
Maria (accent on the first syllable,
please) suggested our eating him; but
I did not like the idea at all. I ex-
plained that I was growing Randolph
for pleasure, not profit. Besides, I
urged, it would not in any case do
during war-time to eat a marrowlet,
or whatever the young of the marrow
is called. Randolph, I told her, must
be allowed to mature. There would
be plenty of time when he was grown
up to decide on his career.
“I know what we'll put him into,”
said Maria.
“What—trousers?” I asked eagerly,
having Randolph's interests at heart.
“A saucepan,” said Maria.
I turned away in disgust.
And now that Randolph is really
grown up we have not, so far, definitely
decided on his future. Maria is still all
for the saucepan ; I am all for keeping
him as an ornament. The delicate
yellow green which his complexion
has assumed pleases my artistic sense.
There may, I argued only yesterday
with Maria, be further developments
in his colour scheme. But meantime
where to place Randolph has been
a matter for somewhat acrimonious

discussion between us. He is too big
to hang on my watchchain, and
Maria has flatly refused to have him
on the drawing-room chimneypiece,
even under a glass-case. Personally,
I think he would be quite as ornamental
as the pair of over-elaborate Dresden
groups that Aunt Sophia gave us.
Maria's brother Bob, who is at Balliol,
says Randolph's future is a problem
which solvitur ambulando, and after
thinking it over since breakfast this
morning I am of the opinion that he
may be right.
I shall wait another few days, and if
my suspicions, only slight at present,
should be confirmed by another sense
than that of vision, Randolph will be
found in the casualty list among the

THE COMPENSATION.
[Lecturing on BYRoN at the Harrow County
School, on Saturday, October 2nd, Miss MARIE
Corºlli lamented the absence of a national
war poet. “We appear to have no great poet,”
she declared, “fitted to immortalise the
magnificent courage that day by day adds
lustre to our lengthening roll of honour.
Feeble rhymes now and then appear in the
Press, but a living poem is not forthcoming.
If Byron were alive, what a difference it would
make ' Had he been living now he would have
given us England's Iliad, as only Homer or
Shakespeare could. . . .
“Compared to Byron, Tennyson was but a
weak singer, Browning a clanking mill-wheel,
while Swinburne lost himself in redundancy
of rhyme and metaphor.”]
Though myriads of minstrels environ
Our soldiers with lyric and lay,
The War hasn't thrown up a ByRoN
To answer the need of “The Day,”
As matchless as MACHIAvelli
With passion and pathos in tons—
But no matter; we've M C——
To frighten the Huns.
If ByRoN had only been living—
Though a hundred-and-thirty or so—
What beans he would daily be giving
To Britain's contemptible foe!
And yet, though no rending réveillé
The patriot's tympanum stuns,
No matter; we've M C
To scatter the Huns.
We've plenty of BRIDGEs and BINYoNs,
And bards of inferior sort,
Who, trusting to rickety pinions,
The fate of young Icarus court;
But their voices are lost in the mélée,
They stir not the souls of our sons;
No matter; we've M C
To flatten the Huns.

“Only surviving son of "-so it ran–
“Beloved husband ’’ and the rest of it.
But six months back I saw him full of life,
Ardent for fighting; now he lies at ease
In some obscure but splendid field of France,
His strivings over and his conflicts done.
He was a fellow of most joyous moods
And quaint-contrivings, ever on the point
Of shaking fame and fortune by the hand,
But always baulked of meeting them at last.
He could not brook—and always so declared—
The weak pomposities of little men,
Scorned all the tin-gods of our petty world,
And plunged headlong into imprudences,
And smashed conventions with a reckless zeal,
Holding his luck and not himself to blame
For aught that might betide when reckoning came.
But he was true as steel and staunch as oak, *
And if he pledged his word he bore it out
Unswerving to the finish, and he gave
Whate'er he had of strength to help a friend.
When the great summons came he rushed to arms,
Counting no cost and all intent to serve
His country and to prove himself a man.
Yet he could laugh at all his ardour too
And find some fun in glory, as a child
Laughs at a bauble but will guard it well.
Now he is fall'n, and on his shining brow
Glory has set her everlasting seal.
I like to think how cheerily he talked
Amid the ceaseless tumult of the guns,
How, when the word was given, he stood erect,
Sprang from the trench and, shouting to his mon,
Led them forthright to where the sullen foe
Waited their coming; and his brain took fire,
And all was exultation and a high
Heroic ardour and a pulse of joy.
“Forward ' " his cry rang out, and all his men
Thundered behind him with their eyes ablaze,
“Forward for England Clear the beggars out !
Remember—” and death found him, and he fell
Fronting the Germans, and the rush swept on.

Beneath the heavy burden of our years,
And may not, though we envy, give our lives
For England and for honour and for right;
But still must wear our weary hours away,
While he, that happy fighter, in one leap,
From imperfection to perfection borne,
Breaks through the bonds that bound him to the earth.
Now of his failures is a triumph made ;
His very faults are into virtues turned;
And, reft for ever from the haunts of men,
He wears immortal honour and is joined
With those who fought for England and are ºr.

(Being a reply to “The New Smoke.”)
SIR PoET who rhymed so adroitly
The praise of the Hampshire cigar,
The Planter's first daughter is out for
your slaughter,
Though quite unaware who you are.
You can't be a native of Hampshire;
You hail from some county afar—
Or surely you'd know, Sir, the plant
that we grow, Sir,
Could not make a Hampshire cigar.
The ignorance, Sir, of the public
Is gross as concerning the weed ;
For they think you can get a Young
Turk cigarette
By planting Virginia seed.
Let me tell you the climate of England
Is just as adapted, indeed,
For growing Havanas as tropic
bananas—
We don't try what couldn't succeed.
We can grow a Virginia or Turkish
High-class cigarette or a fag,
Pipe tobacco for clubmen or baccy for
ubmen,
Light golden or darkest of shag;
And all of 'em like our tobacco,
Both wearers of petties and pants,
But my ear simply ramps when you
talk about “Hamps,”
And—we don't grow cigars, Sir, in

MORE MASCOTS FOR OUR
HEROES.
ToRToISEs For THE TRENCHEs.
THESE delightful pets possess the
unique advantage of carrying their
own bomb-proof shelters always with
them. Regimental crests stamped on
their backs at a small extra charge.
Each tortoise provided by the firm is
supplied with a small pair of scissors
tied round its neck by a piece of ribbon.
Primarily intended for the trimming
of the pet's toe nails, these scissors
will be found most useful for other
purposes.
OUR SPECIAL LINE IN CHAMELEoNs.
These fascinating little reptiles are
well known to possess the valuable
military attribute of assuming the
colour of their surroundings. Every
chameleon provided by the firm is
supplied, at a small extra charge, with
a box of paints and two camel's-hair
brushes. This is for use should the
little pet fail to keep pace with the
change of environment during an extra
rapid advance (or retirement).
OUR TAMED HIPPopotAMI. ,
In wet weather these placid brutes
are well contented to recline for hours
in the trenches with their backs show-
ing slightly above the water level.
Dry accommodation for a whole platoon
on the back of a single specimen.
WATCH CATs For THE WATCH Dogs
IN THE North SEA.
These felines have been specially
trained to give immediate warning of
the presence of an enemy submarine
in the vicinity. Every cat is supplied
with eight spare lives, for which no
extra charge is made. Insurance com-
panies usually pay only on the ninth,
or last, life.
“Babu Jogodish said that as the accused's
father died suddenly on Monday, they were

asked by the Magistrate as to who were to be

Mr. Monnier.”—The Englishman, Calcutta.
Well, whatever the accused's crime may
have been, three step-fathers at one

DRAMATIC GOSSIP.
SIR ARTHUR PINERo's experiment
with The Big Drum seems likely to be
leading to great changes in the drama
of the near future. We hear of more
than one theatre where, pending the
production of an American “crook” play
or a new revue, dramas are to be put up
with a different ending for each night
in the week. Critics are to be asked
to attend each performance before
registering their deathless verdicts, and
the audience is to be provided with
voting papers to record their views as
to the most popular of the varied
dénouements. These papers will not be
inserted in the programmes, but handed
to the audience as they enter, as it
is wished that everyone shall have
one. The most popular ending is not,
however, to be played regularly, but
merely more often than the others.
It is felt that dramatic art, the aim
of which is to give pleasure, will be
conspicuously fostered.
::: ::: x:
A play to be produced at the Satiety
next week, entitled By Your Leave, is
also to have a fluid conclusion, the
audience in this case being invited to
make suggestions as to how things
should be wound up. Prizes (to be paid
by the author) are to be offered by the
management to the devisers of the
three best ideas, and the play will
then have a second first night, with

It cannot be sufficiently emphasised
that no matter how young and gallant
and capable the gentlemen of the chorus,
and even some principals, in the theatres
and variety houses may appear when
on the stage, there is not one among
them who, outside, is not either very
old, very ill, or very short-sighted.

a wittier title than the last. Among

American “crook” plays still hold
the field, but what has been already
seen in London is nothing compared
with what that fortunate city has in
store for it. Hitherto the crooks have
been chiefly burglars or gunmen. In
The Super Crook, which is promised
for the Depravity Theatre and is the
work of a Harvard student who has
never missed a single lecture from the
Professor of Dramatic Success in that
university, we are to see a fascinating
American figure of conspicuously taking
personality who during the per-
formance comes down the run in the
centre of the stalls—sometimes called
a “joy plank"—and undertakes every
evening to purloin articles of value
from the ladies and gentlemen present,
which will be returned—or not, accord-
ing to the popularity of the play—
on the fall of the curtain. New York
is said to have gone mad over this
engaging novelty.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“ROMANCE.”
OUR excellent American cousins have
provided us with yet another sound
loan—Miss DoRIS KEANE, who presents
herself in Romance, by EDwARD SHEL-
DoN, as a naughty wayward prima
donna, the Cavallini, known for short
as The Golden Nightingale. I liked
Miss KEANE and her two chief lieu-
tenants a good deal better than the
play, which began as a promising
enough thing of its nice naive kind, and
finally blew up in a racket of senti-
ment, with a lack of reticence which
affected my spine uncomfortably. Are
there not things appropriately said at
the revival meeting or in the confes-
sional or the cabinet particulier which
are not quite suited to the stage?
Or is that only my confounded
English stodginess?
Well, Miss DoRIS KEANE has
what (if only our pretty young
actresses and their admirers knew
it!) is the heart of the matter—
personality; with plenty of pleas-
ant detail in the unfolding of it
—fire, and a pretty vivacity, a
charming variety of moods, from
gaiety to passion, while she uses
gesture with a fair semblance of
Latin fervour and precision.
As to the play, a prologue shows
us a dear old bishop (none other
than our Mr. NAREs, the dominant
stage beau and hero of our day)
giving advice to his grandson,
who proposes the unheard of un-
wisdom of marrying an actress.
He sets out to tell the love-lorn
youth the story of his own early
broken romance. So from this
prologue we step back into three Acts
set in the New York of the sixties,
when the bishop is the young, hand-
some, and, if anything, over-zealous
Rector of St. Giles.
Comes the Cavallini to the house
of a rich debonnair banker, Van Tuyl
(Mr. A. E. ANsoN, a fine figure in re-
splendent clothes, the authenticity of
which for the place and period I am
inclined to doubt). The singer has
been Van Tuyl's mistress; but the
affair has ended, leaving only a very
charming friendship in its wake (I think
that's the idea), and certainly Van
Tuyl is a good sportsman. The young
Rector, struck all of a heap by the
Nightingale, pursues her in a way calcu-
lated to cause considerable comment in
a quiet parish. The Cavallini, who has
always been good as gold at heart, sees
true love beckoning. But of course she
must renounce—or, at least, confess.
So she confesses all but Van Tuyl, and
it is just the rumours about Van Tuyl
American dramatic technique.
that infuriate the Rector to the point of I think it wise of Miss KEANE to have
a most unsacerdotal violence.
It is fair admitted such a dispirited or dyspeptic
to say that this theme of the young monkey into her cast. Adelina indeed

urged in extenuation by walking for
hours in the snow in a thin overcoat,
coming to save, remains to hurt, but is
brought to his senses by the singer,
who has learnt from him and Van Tuyl
what real goodness is. The end is un-
exceptionable—the way a little devious
and not a little questionable in parts.
It is a problem that may be com-
mended to the curious as to how far
the “movies” have influenced modern
A PASTORAL VISIT.
Mr. Owen NAREs as the Rev. Thomas Armstrong.
Miss DoRIs KEANE as the Prima Donna Margherita
Cavallini.
That
old convention of looking backwards
has come to its own again under the
new inspiration. An enormous rest-
lessness and a passion for interesting
but entirely irrelevant incident are
signs of it. But the convenient cine-
matographic method of switching off
the players and switching on a
short bald explanation of what has
happened in the interval is denied to
the dramatist, who must bridge his
incidents by a longer (and in this
instance, more tedious) method.
Miss DoRIs KEANE, Mr. Owen NAREs,
both as old bishop and young rector,
Mr. ANSON as the repentant banker,
and Miss GILDA WARESI in a clever
sketch of the Cavallini's duenna, put
in some exceedingly good work. I

THINGS HE MIGHT DO.
MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL's astonish-
ing rise to fame within the short space
of three months is the cause of quite
a social sensation.
It seems that one summer day,
Mr. CHURCHILL, having nothing par-
ticular to do, was strolling among the
shops, when in the window of one of
them a lot of little tubes and brushes
and things caught his eye. “What
are those things for 2 " he asked the
shopman. “For painting pictures
with,” was the reply. “Then I will
take them,” said Mr. CHURCHILL, decid-
ing there and then that he would be
a painter of pictures.
In three months, so the papers tell
us, he has become an accomplished
artist, and he is likely to be an ex-
hibitor at the Autumn exhibition at
one of the galleries.
The only regret we have in connec-
tion with this new activity on the part
of our great statesman is that he may
find it necessary to enlarge that hat for
which he is so famous, and to adopt
a change in the shape of collar he
WC al’s.
But what is to be done with the rest
of Mr. CHURCHILL's time 2 He has
become an artist in three months.
What is he to do during the next three
months 2
May we suggest the flute? It is
quite a nice instrument, and not too
difficult. One can get twelve lessons
for two guineas; and when time is an
object the twelve lessons can be had
on the same day, leaving a good period
for practice. If Mr. CHURCHILL would
only adopt this suggestion, we might
have the pleasure of listening to him
play the old year out and the new year
in at one of our fashionable restaurants
at the end of 1915.
Three months, however, is but a
small part of a man's life, and having
conquered the flute, Mr. CHURCHILL
will be at a loose end once more
next New Year's Day. For January,
February and March we suggest either
conjuring or poetry. We do not pre-
tend to any knowledge as to which
Mr. CHURCHILL would most like to be,
a conjurer or a poet. As the father of
a young family, it may be that to pro-
duce a couple of rabbits from a bottle
of ink would appear to be a more desir-
able feat than finding new rhymes to
old words. We must leave the choice
to Mr. CHURCHILL, but, whichever he
prefers to take up first, we hope he will
not reject the other.
Thus we come to the end of June,
1916. There would remain to the
to be achieved, if he felt in the mood.
Singing, weight-lifting and balancing,
fretwork, preaching, surgery, short-
hand and typewriting—yes, there are
plenty of things he could take up to
provide him with that useful occupa-
tion which is so desirable for every one
of us. And who knows that in one of
these activities Mr. CHURCHILL will
not find his true life-work?
A DAUGHTER OF FERANCE.
“HULLo, Arkwright, what is it?”
The Captain spoke rather querulously
to the Subaltern who had awakened
him.
“Two bomb-dropping Taubes have
been over, Sir, flying pretty low. The
Archie—I mean Anti-aircrafts—failed
to drive them off, and I rather think
they have spotted us.”
The Captain swung his legs from
the couch and sat up. “D–n "
he ejaculated wearily. “What infernal
luck!”
Twice within the week enemy aero-
planes had got over his position, and
twice had the heavy howitzers to be
moved elsewhere.
“Right-O !” He shook the sleep
out of himself. “I’ll be out in a jiffy.
If they have spotted us they'll send a
battery aeroplane over first thing to-
morrow, and that will fly about 10,000,
and just mark off the range of the
orchard. Go and telephone the observ-
ing officer that we're clearing out again.
I'm not going to risk anything.”
The Subaltern disappeared and the
Captain reached for his boots. The room
in which he had been resting was at
the back of a farmhouse, and looked
out into a small orchard where the two
“Mothers" were well screened under
the apple-trees. They had arrived
thirty-six hours previously in the dark
of night, and the following day had
been spent busily in getting them
registered on a target by means of
abstruse calculation and an aeroplane.
A good observation post had been
found (not an easy matter) and five
miles of telephone wire laid. As the
Major, who was with the rest of the
battery, had appropriated all the new
wire, the latter job was no sinecure
and bred a good deal of blasphemy.
Also arrangements for billeting with
Madame Bontout had been gone into
thoroughly—no light matter either, and
now it was all rendered useless. The
Captain swore a few private and intelli-
gent oaths as he hauled on his boots.
From the back door to the ever-
present midden was but a step. The
Captain, thinking of other matters,
CHANCELLOR or The Duchy of LAN- took it ankle deep with both feet.
CASTER a variety of accomplishments Round the corner a Sergeant appeared,
and the monologue became a duologue
as the Captain proceeded to issue his
instructions. . . .
“Jack,” said Gunner Slade to Gunner
McCarthy after the Sergeant had passed
on the orders of the day, “we ain't bin
trained properly, we ain't. We ort
ter 'ave bin brort up in a furnicher-
removin' busmiss, we ort.” . . .
In the twilight the two howitzers,
attended by their caterpillars, removed
themselves to other quarters.
“Au revoir et bon voyage, mon brave
Capitaine,” Madame Bontout smiled
and nodded. “Nous mous reverrons,
n’est-ce pas ?”
“Oui, oui,” replied the brave Captain,
wrestling with a Woolwich accent,
“j'espère . . . mous allons un peu dis-
tance. Au revoir.” And, having done
his utmost, he fled.
Next morning, when the night mist
had thinned away, Lieutenant Ark-
wright, R.G.A., was made aware that
the Huns were getting in a bit of hate
about half-a-mile distant on his left
flank. He picked up his glasses to
locate their target, but could not make
sure of it. “I do believe,” he muttered
to himself, “that the blighters are
crumping that last position of ours.”
He confided his views to the Captain,
who, later in day, when the Bosches
had settled down for a quiet aſternoon,
walked over to see what had happened.
When he arrived there was nothing
to see: that is, nothing in the nature of
a farmhouse.
The farm, the house and the orchard
had vanished. There were half-buried
blocks of masonry and trees sticking
ridiculously root upwards from shell
craters; there were pieces of furniture
lying about, mixed up with bricks,
apples, broken timber and the mangled
remains of animals. That was all.
That and a woman who sat upon the
remnant of a shattered wall. She did
not seem to see or hear the Captain
until he touched her lightly on the
shoulder. Then she turned, and he
saw that she had suddenly become
very old.
“Madame Bontout,” he said quietly,
and then, not knowing what else to
say, he was silent.
But she understood.
“Yes,” she whispered slowly, “the
good God has so willed it, but "-and
into her voice crept the unconquerable
spirit of her race—“they did not get
the guns—they did not get the guns.”

the name of the fair-haired man whom I had
seen saying how easy it was to use a snake as
an instrument of murder while crossing on

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE's something all but heroic in the way H.G. WELLs
returns to his fine preoccupation with the theme of the
confounded muddle and waste of our good round world in
its bad square hole. Here in The Research Magnificent
(MACMILLAN) you have Benham, a young nobody in par-
ticular, but wealthy and reflective, obsessed with the great
idea that it must be someone's high job to put the whole
mournful business right. He envisages a loose committee
of aristoi (the samurai of his Modern Utopia in a new guise),
dedicate, trained and courageous, of which he shall be the
first. So he sets out upon his quest magnificent to study and
observe. Passion and romance lasso him by the way,
and he fights clear only at the cost of much suffering to
others. One may reasonably distrust heroics of the
far horizon which ignore plain duties of the foreground.
And yet Benham, driven, at the last a blundering megalo-
maniac, from pontinent to continent in search of “data,” is
no contemptible if a pathetically futile figure. And then
there's Prothero, the candid fleshly don, and Benham's
brilliant fluttering mother. . . . And Amanda, a queer
cross between Diana and her quarry. . . . Mr. WELLs's
own grand tour has no doubt given precision and
conviction to his vivid descriptions of places and the spirit
of places. I suppose him never actually to have met a
tiger in the Indian jungle by night; yet, when you read of
Benham, unarmed and fearful but controlled, putting to
flight that sinister striped brute in the haunted dark, and
all the convincing detail that precedes it, you feel that only
a man who had actually done these things could tell them
so. I can't recall a better piece of work of its kind in two
decades of English fiction. . . . Let no one who likes his

Miss Lambourne was an heiress who
Disdained a wealthy suitor,
One Waverton, whose blood was blue,

And wed the latter's tutor,
An odd young man named Harry Boyce:
The county marvelled at her choice.
At first their happiness was great,
And life proceeded gaily;
But in a year, I grieve to state,
Her sneers had turned his love to hate.

"If it can be reckoned my duty to create an atmosphere
suggestive of the book I am to talk about and the period
with which it is concerned, the author—he signs himself
Ashton HILLIERs—has kindly supplied me with a recipe
in which he places infinite reliance. It all lies in the
little word “ye.” Nothing else is required to convert the
language of the modern daily Press into that of the black-
guards, and of course the gentlemen, of the PRINCE REGENT's
Court. Suppose ye try how ye like it. That ye Will find
is a third refugee of a different stamp, Vivianne, whom
David at very short notice falls in love with and marries.
After the ceremony however he is going to understand that
she is his wife “in name alone.” Much have I travelled in
the realms of fiction, yet saw I never a matrimonial difficulty
of this kind that did not collapse in the last chapter. So
that, even when a former lover turned up to claim her, I
was never seriously anxious about the ultimate destination
of Vivianne (indeed for that matter, if the authors wanted
to withhold information about their climax, they should
certainly have censored the picture on the cover). So it
remains just a pretty story, with some pleasant wit and a
deal of sentiment: a very restful mixture.
The infinite variety of Mr. W. E. Norris remains a thing
to wonder at. Age and custom seem to have no chance
against him. I notice that on the title-page of his latest
something to approve in the bookſ
itself is assured because, ranging
as it does from such favourite old
topics of the author's as the Society
of Friends and forgiveness of one's
enemies to despatch riding for
WELLINGTON and comic opera at
the Horse Guards, Demi-Royal
(METHUEN) includes variety to suit
all tastes. Not indeed that the
writer is always equally at home.
He would, I imagine, be the first
to admit that in the detailing of
lively adventure he does not easily
catch that gallantry of movement
and conviction that must come
easily to come at all; if pressed
harder than I, his sincere admirer,
could wish, he might even confess
to having condescended to make a
convenience of those supposed gaps
in his hero's manuscript which
now and then do most certainly
seem to omit what should have
been a thrill, rather than to bridge
a threatened dulness; but in the
long run, and particularly in those
later chapters where Georgie com-
pletes her transformation from a
lumpish German boy to a glorious

novel, Troubled Tranton (CoN-
STABLE), he is described as author
of three others, after which the
- publishers fall back upon the refuge
’2 of “etc., etc.” Perhaps if they
º printed the names of all Mr.
º Norris's former stories there would
- be no room for the present one;
I which I should have regretted, for
H Troubled Tranton is an admirable
entertainment in its quiet way.
Tranton was a house, and its
troubles rose from the fact that
the late owner, in defiance of
justice and expectation, had left it,
not to his own nephew and heir-
presumptive, but to his niece-in-
law, one Mrs. Lyndem, a charming
widow, who didn't want it. So
Nicholas Alder, who should have
had the house, refused all the
- usurper's offers of friendship and
- even restitution. Moreover, poor
*= |inoffensive Mrs. Lynden began to
be agitated by the arrival of
abusive and anonymous letters,
threatening her with all sorts of
penalties if she remained as mis-
tress of Tranton. Naturally the
district, and all those nice neigh-
Princess of the Blood, he too comes to his own, which is
no mean thing. And so, notwithstanding his habit of
reproducing details, big and little, that he has given us
before, or his abominable misuse of comments in brackets,
I shall advise ye all to read him.
AGNEs and EGERtoN CASTLE, forsaking the eighteenth
century, have now turned their attention to the infinitely
more thrilling twentieth. The Hope of the House (CASSELL)
is a story of the modernest of modern times. A very pretty
story too—which you can take, according to your taste, as
a compliment or not. It really divides itself into two parts.
The first—and better, because the more moving and convinc-
ing—tells how David, the elder of the two Ouren brothers,
determines to endure a struggle with poverty in order to
keep the old home and pass it on to young John. This
episode, the success of David's effort and its tragic frustra-
tion with the death of John in the early days of the War, is
sincere and strong. I liked less the subsequent develop-
ments, in spite of some pleasant comedy in the treatment
of Lady Celia's relations with the two placid and eminently
worldly guests whom she calls “my poor Belgians.” There
bourly people who abound in Mr. Norris's books, were
greatly concerned by this; more especially when the un-
known enemy set fire to Mrs. Lynden's summer-house, and
even kidnapped the daughter of a local magnate who had
been active in her defence. As to who the troubler really
was, that in common fairness I must leave for Mr. Norris
to explain; possibly you will not have read very far before
penetrating the secret, which of course will only add to
your pleasure on finding in the last chapter that your
sagacity was not at fault. One captious question. Even
in these unhampered days, would Sir Augustus have allowed
his niece to journey unattended to London in order to
interview a wholly unknown man about the purchase of
a hunter? I can't help thinking that she went more to
help Mr. Norris with the plot than for reasons of proba-
bility.

TO FERDINAND, ON HIS PROSPECTS.
BET wer:N the Turk, your country's ancient foe,
Whose butchers drank her blood like steaming was sail,
And him of Potsdam, who, if matters go
Smoothly, will have you as his humble vassal,
You are the tertium quid, O FERDINAND, which
Conspires to make a most repulsive sandwich.
Here stands the Moslem with his brutal sword
Still red and reeking with Armenia's slaughter;
Here, fresh from Belgium's wastes, the Christian Lord,
His heart unsated by the wrongs he wrought her;
And you between them, on your brother's track,
Sworn, for a bribe, to stick him in the back.
Yet, spite of such a fellowship, your fate
Won't be a steady round of beer and skittles;
Old friends are best , and love that turns to hate
Is certain to acidulate your victuals;
For Russia, whence your land her freedom drew,
Will show that she who made can break you too.
And not alone that bright blade, hung o'erhead,
Shall dull your cheer and poison all you swallow;
Uneasy sits the alien King who's wed
To schemes his patriot folk are loath to follow;
So next your skin (for flannel won't avail)
You'd better wear a steel-proof shirt of mail. O. S.
DIVERSIONS OF THE CABINET.
W E all know how Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL walked into
a colourman's shop, three months ago, and purchased a
manual upon Pictures and How to Paint them ; and how
already he has produced a number of “large and dignified
landscapes,” and is at work upon a “stately portrait of
his wife.” But it is not by any means so generally known
—it may have been withheld by the Press Bureau—that
this sort of thing is going on all over the Cabinet.
I had a talk yesterday, writes our representative, with
a stall-holder at a forthcoming bazaar who was most
enthusiastic about Mr. BonAR LAw's poker-work. “The
work is so realistic that you can almost smell the singe,”
she said, “and there is an enormous quantity of it. His
industry is amazing. The unexpected adjournment of the
House for a week over the Finance Bill meant the addition
of three corner cupboards, a tea-tray and a small bedroom
bookcase to my supply. His work is always unsigned.
He picked it up, it seems, in a moment from an article on
Parlour Crafts in a magazine.” -
There is no busier man in the country at present than the
MINISTER of MUNITIONs, and it will probably come as a
surprise to his many admirers to learn that he contrives
to find time to pursue his new hobby of Ecclesiastical
Architecture. Visitors to Criccieth in the near future would
do well to keep their eyes open for a rich example of Neo-
Methodist-Gothic opposite the railway station, which has
caused something of a flutter in the R.I.B.A. Mr. GEORGE
apparently picked up the guiding principles of the art in
conversation with an intelligent steel roller on the Clyde.
New distinctions would seem to be in store for Sir
F. E. SMITH, “I had a talk with his publisher,” writes our
representative, “one day last week, and he told me much
that I feel bound to suppress in the public interest. But it
is an open secret that a gigantic Book of Sonnets is already
in the press which will give reviewers much food for thought.
The story that Sir FREDERICK had picked up a manual
entitled How to be a Poet is quite untrue. He was deep in
study of the map one day when he was struck by a very
singular coincidence. Fighting was going on in the neigh-
bourhood of Dwinsk, Pinsk and Minsk. Although he had
never before dreamt of writing verse; the opportunity thus
presented seemed altogether too gocq to miss, and as soon
as he had made a beginning the rest was plain sailing.
‘The wonderful thing,’ added his publisher, “is that he
scans so well. One frequently comes upon several lines in
succession with hardly a foot out of place.'”
Mr. RUNCIMAN has just completed a set of 117 orchestral
variations on the Montenegrin National Anthem.
EVADING THE CENSOR.
“Dick has got his marching orders at last—off on Satur-
day,” said Eileen. “Now I want you to find some way for
him to let me know his whereabouts without being stopped
by that horrid Censor.”
“This,” I said, “is a matter for reflection. What you
want is some quaint and rare device which will not only
dupe the Censor but can be guaranteed to furnish no
information to the enemy. Imagire the excitement of the
Ober-Offizier who intercepted a letter informing him that
Lieutenant Richard Donkin was at ‘Here's most
important news,' he would say. “Himmel ! Lieutenant
Donkin at ! Schnell / order up three extra army corps
at once!' . . . No, Eileen, we must avoid that possibility
at all costs.” -
As it happened I lunched with a man the next day who
had encountered exactly the same problem. His son had
arranged a cryptogram, using the first letter of every fourth
word to spell out the name of his whereabouts.
“And does it answer?” I said.
“Not very well. It was all right at first, when he was
at the base, but as soon as he moved on there came through
a string of highly improbable names which we couldn't
find in any map on the market. The last one was ‘Yttgau,'
which suggests that he lost count, or else he'd been un-
expectedly transferred to Russia.”
Anyway Dick wouldn't hear of the plan. He said it
would cramp his style. So I gave deep thought to the
matter and at last conceived the perfect plan.
“What you and Dick must do,” I said, “is to have
duplicate maps. You must then agree upon two main
towns, say Paris and Brussels, as bases. When Dick has
finished his letter he places it over the map (letters from
the Front are always written on flimsy semi-transparent
paper), sticks a pin through Paris and Brussels, and a
third pin in his own locality. Then when the letter arrives
all you have to do is to pin the two fixed holes over Paris
and Brussels in your map, and the third hole gives you
Dick's whereabouts. It is also obvious that a mere letter
with a few pinholes in it tells the Bosches nothing.”
Well, Dick agreed to this, and soon after he left we
received a letter with perforations indicating that he was
in , a well-known town in Northern France which is
familiar to all our readers. Then he moved on to *
and there he stuck for several weeks; or at least, if Eileen's
pinpricks were to be trusted, he fluttered round in a
sort of jaunty spiral. And then at last there came a hint
that he was approaching the firing-line.
A few days afterwards I found Eileen inspecting a
letter with furrowed brows. Its appearance was most
singular—simply riddled with pin-holes; rather like a target
on our miniature range when I'm in my true form.
“Wait a minute,” I said, “there's something on the
other side.” -
There was a hastily pencilled line of unfamiliar hand-
writing. It ran as follows: “The Censor is not such a
fool as you seem to think 1"

TREASURE TROVE FROM
THE TIN.
According to The Daily Chronicle
of the 14th inst., a Hull soldier, recently
returned wounded from the Dardanelles,
had occasion to open a tin of salmon,
and to his surprise found inside a
gentleman's silver watch in good con:
dition.
and it started ticking merrily.
Had this been an isolated case, some
incredulity might have been pardoned.
But, as a correspondent has hastened
to assure us, other similar experiences
have occurred of late, showing the
remarkable generosity of tinned food
manufacturers and their genial desire
to promote the happiness of the
Consuliner.
Mr. Pulling - Legge, a well-known
bath-chair proprietor at Sidcup, had
recently occasion to open a tin of
sardines. His surprise may well be
imagined when he discovered inside
the tin a rare quarto edition of the
He immediately wound it up, i. Suburban Gentleman"
works of SHAKSPEARE, which he has
since presented to Sir SIDNEY LEE.
Hardly less remarkable was the ex-
perience of Mrs. Hardy Phibster, the
wife of the postmaster at Deochandoris,
near Cromarty, who was helping her
family to some Californian peaches,
and to her profound amazement found
at the bottom of the tin a small
musical-box, which at once began to
play “Tipperary.” The matter is re-
ceiving the attention of the local
medical authorities.
A correspondent suggests that the
whose woes
were depicted in a recent issue should
change the name of his house from
“Sans Souci" to “Sans Six Sous.”

TO GET THE MEN.
THE great conscriptionist controversy
is entering upon a new phase. The
burning question of the moment would
appear to be whether the necessary
men are to be compelled to volunteer
or persuaded to be compulsorily en-
rolled. Both points of view are ex-
plained by a couple of letters which
have just reached this office. We
suspect that they were really intended
for The Manchester Guardian, but as
they have come into our hands we
hasten to give them publicity.
DEAR SIR,-Whatever Lord KITCH-
ENER may have said to the Labour
Leaders—that is perhaps a sore subject
and I don't propose to deal with it—
before a tribunal, presided over by the
local recruiting authority, to state their
case. If they still persist in getting
out of it, other tactful methods of
persuasion could very easily be devised.
The voluntary system would be by no
means exhausted even then. A re-
cruiting poster might be stuck on their
front-doors and garden gates. As a
further step the municipal water supply
might be cut off from the house or even
from the whole street (which would
insure pressure being brought to bear).
Finally the obstinate should be dis-
franchised and confronted with an extra
shilling on the income-tax.
If we are assured that conscription
is necessary we are ready to shoulder
the burden. But the possibilities of
we are all agreed that our army must the Voluntary System must be first
be kept up to full strength
till the War is over. But
it is clearly ridiculous and
altogetheriname to suppose
that the men cannot be got
in overwhelming numbers
by the Voluntary system
(to which I take off my hat).
It is by no means exhausted.
Indeed it has only begun
to work. We want no
pressed men. We want
nothing but men whose
heart is in the job and who
have freely and spontane-
ously come forward, clam-
ouring to offer themselves
as recruits. And they can
be got. Let there be no
taint of compulsion in our
methods, no encroachment
on individual liberty. All
that is necessary is to give
new opportunities of enrol-
ment to our willing masses.
Now that the National Register is com-
plete we have all the facts before us, and
the authorities can get to work along
rational lines. It is quite a mistake
to suppose that there are any shirkers
or slackers or shrinkers or skulkers
among us. Eligible men have only to
be firmly and tactfully approached to
fall over each other in their eagerness
to come forward. The best method of
procedure would be the following:-
Let every eligible man receive a
brusque summons in the name of the
KING to present himself without delay.
If that doesn't work, a close house-to-
house canvass should follow, in which
every man of army age should be
narrowly cross-examined and badgered
and asked to give a full account of
himself. (A policeman should be kept
in the background—perhaps waiting
in the street outside). If the results
are still disappointing, all those who
have not responded must be called

HiGHLY COMMENDABLE EFFORT ON THE PART OF A NEw RECRUIT
To DEAL witH A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION OF MILITARY ETIQUETTE.

(2) The whole of Ireland.
(3) Parts of Wales, England and
Scotland—to be known as Exempted
Areas.
(4) All those who can satisfy the
authorities that they have a strong and
genuine bias toward civilian life.
It is natural that we should prefer
the voluntary system, but, as it is,
compulsion is our only hope.
I am, Dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
DRASTIC.
We have also received a pronounce-
ment from a well-known novelist :-
DEAR SIR,-In one of those weekly
articles of mine which throw a white
light on the situation I pointed out a
month or two ago that conscription
- could do little to help us,
for the simple reason that,
having already raised an
army of some 4,000,000
men (by voluntary effort),
it would hardly be possible
for us to spare another
half-million. Again a week
or two ago, in one of my
many Last Words upon this
question, I made it quite
clear that conscription
would be of no avail, for
the simple reason that,
having already raised an
army of some 2,300,000
men (by voluntaly effort),
we could not with safety
enroll more than another
half-million. There may be
some little discrepancy, but
I am not always lucky
with figures — although I
thoroughly enjoy them.
- Anyhow it is the principle
exhausted. It must be given a fair that counts. Roughly speaking there
I am, Dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
ANTI-MILITARIST.
DEAR SIR,-We are all agreed that
the army must be kept at full strength
during the coming year. And it is now
perfectly clear to the most fatuous
observer that the so-called voluntary
system has broken down. Only by Con-
scription can we secure the necessary
men in regular drafts as they are wanted.
From the moment when the new system
is introduced the War will be as good
as won. Everything will change in a
twinkling; Germany will crack up.
The British conscript will strike terror
wherever he goes. There need be no
apprehension as to difficulties at home.
The term Conscription must not be
misunderstood. There will of course
be exemptions. I should suggest, for
the smooth working of the plan, that
the following should be exempt:—
chance.
are no more men that can be raised
by conscription. The same does not
of course apply to the voluntary
system.
Finally, if Mr. Asquith were to say
to-morrow that compulsion was abso-
lutely necessary to the safety of the
realm, I would acquiesce. I would
really. And that would ensure the
success of the new move. But Mr.
Asquith will never say that. I know
all about it.
Yours, WAR IXPERT,

THE MAN WHO HAD SEEN A ZEPPELIN.
THE WOES OF A WOUNDED.
Is there a man can think that Europe's quarrels
Are barren bickerings and do no good?
There may be such ; but let him see
The way in which Gallipoli
Affects young officers and moulds their morals,
And blow me if he could !
What kindness, what self-sacrifice was present
In that most painful of Peninsulae,
If several of the eggs were tired,
Or some drab services required
It was a joy to see how nice and pleasant
A Cambridge man could be.
With never a moan we munched the meanest ration,
We that of late were full of pelf and pride;
Swore not at all when privates erred
(Though Simpson said one shocking word),
And no one published, in pre-bellum fashion,
The state of his inside.
Moreover, we were bent on being fully
The same sweet gentry, men of model mood,
When parted from the scenes of strife
(If ever). We should laugh through life,
And never, by the bitterness of “bully,”
Complain about our food.
But it was vain; the soul is bound to stumble
When peace and plenteousness succeed the storm.
Each morning I become less kind;
To-day I had some fault to find
With Cook's fair fish-cakes, and they say I grumble
Quite in my ancient form.
Therefore with joy I hie me back to-morrow
To Turks and centipedes and all the pain;
I do not deem, as some have done,
That, on the whole, it's “rather fun";
Life will be vile. But this shall ease my sorrow—
I shall be good again.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON THE SPY TRAIL AGAIN.
You know Jimmy's blood-hound,
Faithful. Well, he has been right
off German spies; you couldn't have
tempted him with one not even if you
had dangled it in front of his nose.
Jimmy said it was the distemper, and
made up some medicine to get him
over it. After taking one dose Faithful
got over the distemper all right; he
also got over a six-foot wall on the
other side of the road, through three
fields, across a churchyard, through
the church door and up to the top of
the tower. There's more air on the
top of the tower, Jimmy says, that 's
why.
The church door was locked by the
time Jimmy arrived there. You have
to get the keys from a man who sits
in a cottage close by having rheuma-
tism. If you take him something for
his rheumatism he will always let you
have the keys this once.
Jimmy knows all about rheumatism,
and he makes up an ointment for it out
of the grease he gets out of the boxes
in the railway wagons. Jimmy says
the Indians always use it, and if you
gave some to an Esquimaux he would
eat it in his ignorance, and it's because
... of the temperature.
The last time Jimmy went up the
church tower he couldn't get any oint-
ment from the railway wagons, so he
had to make some up out of some
castor oil his mother had got for him
to go with a few crab apples he had
eaten. Jimmy says he likes putting
things into castor oil, because it serves
it right.
The way you do it is to get some
ingredients; but he won't let you
see him putting them in, because it
wouldn't work properly if he did.
Jimmy says you have to be very care-
ful about the ingredients, because, if
you didn't put the right ones in, it
would cure something else that, per-
haps, you hadn't got, and you would
feel very puzzled about it. I saw
Jimmy put one thing in, though; it
was some stuff for making sheep dip
that he found. Jimmy finds lots of
things like that, and he always puts
them carefully away in a box he has
got in the summer-house, and then
when he has any spare time he makes
up bottles of medicine and ointment and
different sizes of pills. Jimmy has got
one pill which he made over a year
ago; it is a very good pill, much
stronger than the ordinary ones. There
are so many things in it that Jimmy
had to put some cobbler's wax in it to
hold them together. Even then it often
begins to rise up in parts, and you have
to press it back into shape.
Jimmy says it's for a case of a
mergency or something like that. It's
not so big as it was, because Jimmy
used some of it to take a wasp's nest.
It is a very useful pill, because Jimmy
showed me how you could mend broken
plates with it. Jimmy once cured a
lady's pug dog with a bit of it. The
pug dog used to come and lie down in
the middle of a bed of tulips which
Jimmy's mother had planted. It liked
tulips. It was a very fat pug dog, and
had trouble with its breath; Jimmy
said it was suffering from sleeping sick-
ness and gave it a piece of the pill in
some meat. Jimmy says the pug dog
was surprised at its own activity; it
tried to get away from itself and ran
about very freely, Jimmy says. It
cured the sleeping sickness all right,
but it took all the curl out of the pug
dog's tail.
Jimmy can cure anything like that;
you'd be surprised.
He cured a man of water on the knee
one day. The man came to the back
door and asked Jimmy if he would like
to buy some mohair laces or what not.
There was only Jimmy at home, and,
when the man knew that, he told Jimmy
not to be frightened. Jimmy wasn't
frightened. The man said he had water
on the knee and that beer was a good
thing for it, if Jimmy would fetch him
some. He showed Jimmy his knee.
Jimmy says it didn't look as if it had
had much water on it. He told the
man he had some medicine which would
cure it. The man said he would take
it if Jimmy would put it in some beer.
Jimmy got the medicine; it was violet
coloured medicine and looked very
pretty. Jimmy always colours his
medicines; he has a different colour
for each day of the week. Saturday
is violet, and he does it with some
copying ink.
Jimmy says it is a very good medi-
cine, because if you leave the cork in
it blows it out in two days, and if you
tie the cork down it bursts the bottle.
Jimmy says the Indians use it when
they are training to run races, and
besides curing water on the knee it will
kill weeds on the garden path.
The man drank the beer, but said lie
would have to have some more to take
away the taste of the medicine. There
was no more real beer; so Jimmy made
some of his own and put into a beer
bottle he had found; it was the same
kind of beer that he had once used for
staining a rabbit hutch.
Jimmy says, when Faithful saw the
man he began baying like anything,
until he happened to catch sight of the
empty medicine bottle, and then, after
wagging his tail, he went and sat down
where he could have a good view of
the six-foot wall on the opposite side
of the road. He locked very happy,
Jimmy says.
Jimmy asked the man if his knee felt
better, and told him he had some stuff
which would ease it at once if he painted
it on with a camel-hair brush. The l
man looked surprised and laughed.
He said he had never heard that
before; he said he never knew that
camels used hair-brushes. Jimmy felt
very glad the man had had the beer as
well as the medicine, because he felt
certain he was a German, or he would
have known about a camel-hair brush.
Jimmy says very soon the man began
to have doubts, they kept flitting across
his face; so Jimmy went quietly inside
the house and locked the door so that
he could watch the water going out of
his knee without being in his way at
all. The man didn't seem to notice
Jimmy; he seemed to be thinking; he
looked as if he had a stomachache,
Jimmy says. Jimmy says he doesn't
know which reached the man's knee
first, the beer or the medicine, and he
thinks it must have been a near thing
by the way he ran out of the garden
and jumped over the gate. He forgot
all about the mohair laces.
Jimmy followed the man as well as he
could. He found him at the chemist's
shop quenching his thirst with mustard
and water. Jimmy says the chemist
had already sent for a policeman because
of the German which kept coming out
of the man.
Jimmy says the chemist had a happy
afternoon ; he took Jimmy into his
garden to show him the German, and
said he felt he could go on mixing
mustard and water for him all day.
Jimmy says the German looked very
tame; you could have led him about
with a piece of cotton.
Jimmy never charges anything for
his medicines, he is only too pleased to
let people have them who seem to
want them.

Ingenuous Daughter. “OH, I AM so GLAD. AND who—who Is THE HAPPY MAN ?”
THE RECRUITING OF POPPETT MINIMUS.
Mother told me she couldn't afford
a holiday this year, but that the doctor
said I had to go to the sea because I
was suffering from convalescence. Con-
valescence is a beastly thing to have ;
it's Latin really for feeling tired and
living off rice pudding. It's not catch-
ing; so Parsons, my greatest chum,
who's going in for the Church, was
allowed up to see me. The doctor con-
fided to my mother that I wanted rous-
ing, and Parsons says I might have
succumbed if it had not been for the
boy next door.
When I was a bit better and able to
look out of the window, the boy next
door, who is a Scout and has to do
one kind deed every day, called out,
“Slacker!” It isn't true, as I can't
join them before next term, but I was
too convalescent to explain through a
pane of glass. He is of a fiery nature
with red hair, and, being Scotch, he
can't understand people fooling about
and doing nothing. Parsons says that
MacWhirter didn't know about my
convalescence, but I was so mad that
I came down next day. I wanted
really to send MacWhirter a challenge,
but Parsons told me that forgiveness
was the highest of all virtues, and that
anyhow I was too weak to fight a cat.
So I said I would forgive MacWhirter
till next term.
Parsons, who is going in for the
Church, wouldn't hear of this, as he
says it isn't quite playing the game for
chaps at home to fight among them-
selves, and that I could easily wait till
after the War. At the same time he
reminded me how the doctor said I had
to be roused and that MacWhirter had
done it. He said it was really a merci-
ful dispensation and that I ought to be
grateful to MacWhirter for saving my
life.
I hadn't looked at it in this light.
Parsons knows already a lot of theology,
and when he likes a thing he calls it a
merciful dispensation, and when he
doesn't it's an unscrupulous decree.
As he says, there's no good grousing
about either. In the last Juniors'
cricket match Parsons made forty not
out in the first innings. He wasn't a
bit coxy about it, but said it was a
merciful dispensation. In the second
innings he was bowled by Loftus first
ball, and he said it was an unscrupulous
decree and that Loftus ought to have
his head punched for bowling no-balls.
Parsons has relatives at the seaside,
so his holiday only cost his people his
train ticket. As we are great chums
his relations asked me too. Parsons'
mother said he had a weak chest, but
Parsons confided to me in the train
that he really had clergyman's sore
throat. That's all nonsense, because
you can't get it till you are ordained.
Parsons got very angry when I said
this, as he says it attacks chaps who
are going in for the Church as well.
The last thing our people told us was
to look after each other and do nothing
but recruit.
We did our best, but we couldn't get
one single recruit. Recruiting at the
seaside is a very tough job. Perhaps

all the chaps we saw were convalescers.
We tracked a lot of likely cases, some
regular promenade nuts, but they were
always escorted by a convoy of girls,
who beat off our attack. I didn't care
for these fellows myself, but Parschs
says they may be suffering from con-
scientious anaemia or an indisposition
which keeps them from fighting. You
never can tell. One of our chaps in
the Upper Sixth, who was the first
to volunteer, was rejected for haricose
veins, and he was simply furious about
it and said there was no such disease.
I sent in a report to headquarters
signed by Parsons and myself. I got
a letter by return from the mater be-
ginning, “You silly little boys.” I had
to show it to Parsons, and he was
naturally hurt about it at first. He
said it was just the same with his
mater. He couldn't get her out of the
habit of speaking as if he was one of
the Lower Form kids, though she knew
he was to be promoted next term. He
said that “recruit" in the sense she
used it in was slang really, and that
he didn't like ladies to use slang.
He thought the rest of the letter about
the silly girls with white feathers, and
how wrong it is to judge other people,
and how we ought to leave the Govern-
ment alone and give them a chance, was
quite good theology, and ought to be a
lesson to me in future. Very likely
those fellows I had seen on the pro-
menade were really as brave as lions
but didn't read the newspapers.
I said they would know about the
War from their cinemas. I thought
I had Parsons there, but you never can
have him really, for he used to do Logic
once with his sisters' governess. He
retorted that if they had heard about
the War it would take a mighty lot
of pluck to play the giddy goat as they
do. He said it was really a case of
immoral courage.
When school began again, we made
up our minds, after the mater's letter,
to regard it as an unscrupulous decree
and not grouse this time. After all, as
Parsons says, some of the stuff they
teach you, like HoMER, might be useful
any day in the Balkans. He says he
knows as a fact we are going to start
Surds next term because he heard one
of the masters say so. It sounds
interesting and is perhaps instead of
German for fellows that want to act
as interpreters. Parsons has been told
that Surds are the finest fighting men
the Turks have got and there are
millions of them in Asia Minor.
Parsons knows a lot; he always
scores on the General Knowledge paper,
and if he wasn't going in for the Church
he says he wouldn't half mind being
an editor.

ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.)

12th.-PREMIER not only habitually
does the right thing but does it in the
right way, a correlation of circumstance he set out for the Front as if he were

not too frequent.
House after ten days' interval he
called attention to fact that mean-
while four Members have given
their lives for their country. He
made no set oration, brought with
him no script of prepared monody.
No notice of his intention was
published. Questions over, he rose
and, resting his hands on the brass-
bound box, spoke a few words of
simple earnest sorrow for the loss
of gallant comrades.
“The House,” he said, “will, I
am sure, acknowledge with grati-
tude the splendid example they
have set.”
When his purpose in rising be-
came apparent, Members with one
accord bared their heads in silent
sympathy.
A whispered message, conveyed
to Front Opposition Bench by
CHIEF WHIP, brought to his feet
the right hon. gentleman who endows
with dignity the post of Leader of a
non-existent Opposition. In shortest
speech ever made since, nearly half-a-
century ago, a gay young buck with
all the world before him where to
choose, he came to Westminster to
represent the county in which his
ancestral home was set, HARRY CHAPLIN
supplemented the PREMIER's tribute.
Heroes all. “Young men of high pro-
mise,” as the PREMIER said. Because
I knew him best I most deeply mourn
the cutting off of AGAR-RobARTEs. He
was in all respects highest type of
an Englishman. Heir to a peerage,
endowed with many interests intellect-
ual and social, keenly but tranquilly
enjoying the pleasant pathway through
which Life led him, he at the trumpet
call gave up everything, and went forth
to take his turn in the trenches, his
share of hourly peril.
The battle in which he fell was not
his first. Courage of another kind was
displayed in his political and parlia-
mentary career. Returned unopposed
by a Liberal constituency, he held
views on Home Rule differing from
those officially adopted by his Party.
In such circumstances it is common
practice for the conscientious dis-
entient to look out a corner seat below
the Gangway, take every opportunity
of asserting his independence and of
denouncing mistaken views of his
leaders and the majority of their
following. That not AGAR-RobARTEs'
way. Patiently suffering advice and
rebuke he was content to obey dictates
of conscience by unobtrusively voting
against successive stages of Home Rule
Bill.

upon to take earliest opportunity of

did not put in appearance at Question
hour. This the more regretted since
ARTHUR MARKHAM had placed on the
Opened with pertinent inquiry
as to payment of Members during
progress of War and the colossal
expenditure thereby involved.
Economy the order of the day.
Generally felt that economy, like
charity, should begin at home.
In flush of prosperity that spread
roseate hue over prolonged period
of peace, Members voted them-
selves salaries of £400 a year, pay-
able out of National Exchequer.
Total draft amounts to a quarter
of a million per annum, a sum that
might, among other things, create
and maintain a useful fleet of air-
ships. MARKHAM wanted to know
whether the PREMIER will propose
that only Members who are able
to make declaration that their in-
come is inadequate to maintain
their position shall continue to
receive the salary.
Another point which he sub-
mitted for kindly consideration of
PREMIER was the stoppage of pensions
retired from business. In one case an
aggregate sum of £110,000 has been
on account of Parliamentary services.
Beside this, Members' salary of £400
a year is alluringly moderate.
In absence of PREMIER, Questions
postponed. MARKHAM may be depended
putting them.
By accidental, not less striking,
coincidence, MoNTAGU later in sitting
made casual statement that luridly
illuminates financial position. He
reckoned that next year, if present
rate of War expend tule be maintained,
there will, in spite of heavily increased
taxation levied by two last Budgets,
be a deficit of 1,438 million sterling.
“Every citizen,” he added, “should
be prepared to put at least one-half of
his income at the disposal of the State,
whether in the form of tax or loan.”

About a year or more ago, when leading Unionists
Abjured all party rancour and left the party lists,
“Have we got an Opposition ?” The Daily Wail inquired,
And bluntly recommended that its leader should be “fired.”
Then came the Coalition, and The Wail awhile was dumb,
But very soon with fresh complaints began to make things
hum ;
And, concentrating upon shells, took once again the floor
With the question, “Have or have we not a Minister of
War?”
And so from month to month at each successive crucial
stage
We've seen this plague of questions fast and furiously rage,
Till now the Eternal Querist of The Wail desires to know,
“Have we got a Foreign Office?" and implies that GREY
must go. -
Now the questions that insistently suggest themselves to
line—
And I'm sure that with my attitude most honest folk
agree—
Do not concern the competence of Kitch ENER or GREY,
Or whether Mr. A. or B. or C. should go or stay.

With the ultimate resultant, “Must we have a Daily

NO TREATING.
“Two Brighton biscuits, please, Miss,
on two plates,” said the fat red-nosed
man. Then, turning to his comrade,
he asked, “What are you having with
it 2 ''
“Scotch,” replied the other. -
“No treating,” murmured the bar-
maid automatically.
“This isn't treating; it's a meal.”
“Go on with you,” replied the bar-
maid.
“It is,” protested the fat man. “What
with income tax and super - tax, and
war-profits tax and tobacco tax and . . .”
“Tea tax,” suggested his companion.
“And tea tax,” said the fat man,
casting a grateful glance upon his friend,
“I can't afford more 'n a biscuit for
lunch. Nor can 'Erb, and I owe him
a lunch.”
“Lunch at a quarter past three! Not
much ' ' exclaimed the barmaid.
“Couldn't get away before,” replied
the fat man, adjusting his tie with
scrupulous care. “Too busy in the
office.” -
The barmaid was persistent. “A
Brighton biscuit isn't a meal,” she
declared. -
“It's all the meal I'm having,” said
the thin man. “Come to that, what is
a meal 2"
“Here you are, then—two Scotches
and two biscuits.” The girl gave the
fat man his change and the two men
sat down at a table, leisurely swallowed
their drinks and made a pretence of
eating their biscuits. When their
glasses were empty they put the re-
mains of the meal in their pockets and
the thin man advanced to the counter.
“Two Brighton biscuits, please,
Miss,” he said, “on two plates, and
two whiskies.”
The girl laughed. “You can't have
two meals running,” she said.
“This is tea now,” argued the thin
Inan.
“No good,” declared the barmaid
briskly.
“Well then, give me a double
whiskey and an empty glass.”
“What do you want the empty glass
for 2 ” -
“Never you mind,” said the thin
man sternly.
The girl's anger rose. “If you pour
any of the whiskey into it I'll have
you run in.”
“Give me one whiskey, then,” he
commanded, and beckoned to his friend.
“Bill,” he said, “I bet you a tanner
you've forgot 'Arry Wilkins's address.”
“I’ll take you on,” replied the other.
“'Arry lives at 29, Goswell Street.”
“Right,” said 'Erb sadly, pushing a
sixpence to his friend.
“A whiskey, please, Miss,” said the
fat man, diverting the sixpence across
the counter.
The barmaid glared but held her
peace.
The talk of the two men turned to
horses. They discussed current form
with considerable interest and not a
little heat.
“Ah,” said Bill at length, as he
drained his glass, “I rather fancy

morrow, but my booky disappeared

Can you back it for me with yours, do

“Of course I can,” was the answer.
“How much 2" -
“Only a tanner,” replied the fat
man, producing the coin and handing
it to his friend as he spoke. Then,
noticing the girl's eye fixed upon him,
he added, “I can't afford more. What
with the income tax and the super-tax,
and the tea tax and . . .” The bar-
maid turned her back upon him and
stared haughtily at the bottles on the
shelf.
“One whiskey, please, Miss,” cried
the two men simultaneously.
For the third time they were served,
and they drank, talking of many things
the while.
“By the way, Bill,” said 'Erb, diving
his hand into his pocket, “I forgot to
pay you back that sixpence you lent me
to put in the plate on Sunday.”
“Why, so you did,” answered Bill in
a tone of great surprise. “Thanks.”
Again came the cry from each throat,
“One whiskey, please.”
The girl's face was crimson as she
served them. They gazed inncCently
at her helpless rage.
“Fine sermon, wasn't it, Bill ?”
“Very fine, 'Erb, very fine . . . About
these Russians, now . . . .”
They launched into a long War
argument. . -
The barmaid watched them as a
fascinated rabbit watches a snake, and
involuntarily half rose from her chair
as they set their empty glasses on the
counter. -
“Well, 'Erb,” said the fat man, tak-
ing his comrade affectionately by the
arm and leading him towards the door,
“if it weren't for these new regulations
I'd stand you a drink, old man. Good
day, Miss.”

THE SOCIAL SITUATION.
DAILY ANALYSIS AND For ECAST BY our
- SocIETY ExPERT.
(What we may expect if a present journ-
alistic fashion persists in peace-time.)
MoNDAY.-Among the most interest-
ing events of the forthcoming week will
certainly be the cricket-match between
Eton and Harrow. I propose, therefore,
with the reader's leave, to examine in
some detail the conditions and proba-
ble result of the forthcoming contest.
First, as to the all-important question
of numbers. Here, a careful survey—
aided by certain sources of information,
authoritative, but the exact nature of
which I am unable to reveal—inclines
me to the belief that there will be
little or no inequality in the actual
numerical strength of the opposing
forces. For data upon which to base
our conclusions we are therefore com-
pelled to turn to the factor of individual
achievement [turns accordingly for
half a column]. I have no hesitation
in saying that Etonians can await the
issue of the approaching conflict with
unshaken equanimity. Eton will win.
TUESDAY.-Readers of this paper
will be pleased to receive the first public
intimation of a romantic betrothal. Sir
John Brown, as I am exceptionally in
a position to state, has during the past
four-and-twenty hours proposed to Hon.
Mary Jones, and been accepted. Miss
Jones will be recalled as the popular
eldest daughter of Lord and Lady Jones,
at whose Welsh home the interesting
event has just occurred. The wedding,
probably a quiet one, is likely to take
place very shortly so that the bride and
bridegroom may be settled in town
before the opening of the Autumn
Session. -
WEDNESDAY.-Striking confirmation
of the news which I was able to give
yesterday as to the approaching union
of the houses of Brown and Jones, is
afforded in the tidings that Lady Jones
is giving an impromptu dance this
evening at her house, 405, Hill Street,
in honour of Miss Jones's betrothal. I
hear that many smart hostesses are
getting up boy-and-girl dinners for this
interesting occasion. 405 is a delightful
house for dancing.
THURSDAY. —The musical At Home
given at 405, Hill Street last night by
Sophonisba, Lady Jones (not, of course,
to be confused with the wife of the
Welsh peer of the same name), was in
every way a brilliant success. Every-
body in town seemed to be there. M.
Breitmann, the well-known Dutch tenor,
sang many songs; and the playing of the
White Portuguese Orchestra was enor-
mously enjoyed. By the way, speaking
of the Joneses, you may take it from me

that all the rumours contradictory of
the approaching marriage between
Miss Mary Jones and Sir John Brown
are entirely without foundation. The
wedding, I hear, will be celebrated at

and may be regarded, as absolutely of Sir John Brown to Miss Jane the splendid work that is being carried

FRIDAY.-The one innings defeat of
Eton by Harrow can have come as no
surprise to the readers of this journal.
Other things being equal, it is obvious
that the result of such a contest as this
depends almost entirely upon the state
of the wicket. And it has long been an
open secret that the recent dry weather
had rendered the wicket so fast that, if
Harrow could muster their full strength
in bats, the result was a foregone con-
clusion. Of course two days' steady
rain would have sufficed to reverse this
situation; but in cricket (as I have
more than once pointed out) we aré
concerned with facts, not with far-
fetched eventualities.
Sir John Brown, touching whose
matrimonial prospects gossip has been
so busy lately—and as usual utterly
wide of the mark—leaves town this
bombshell to many of our amateur
prophets. To those in the know, how-
ever, signs have for some time not been
wanting that something of the kind
was probable, though (for obvious
reasons) we could give no more precise
indication of our knowledge. The
happy event took place at Salisbury,
and the only bridesmaid, the Hon.
Mary Jones—alas for ill-informed prog-
nostication'—was charmingly gowned
in blue and silver chiffon. Thus ends
a crowded week. Of the events to be
expected in the next we shall reserve
information till Monday.

cal Stores; £220,000 worth of gifts
for the wounded, including nearly
2,000,000 articles of clothing; 1,000
Motor-Ambulances, Lorries, Cycles,
&c., which require £200,000 for a
year's upkeep ; and 1,200 packets of
food every week to Prisoners-of-war
in Germany; besides establishing
Hospitals, Hospital Trains, Rest
Stations and Convalescent Homes
abroad. It is impossible to spend
money in a better cause.

THE BUDGET.
“WELL, well,” said Francesca, “this Budget of yours
doesn't seem to be so popular after all.”
“It's a way Budgets have,” I said. “But why do you
call this one mine? I hadn't the least bit of a little finger,
let alone a hand, in it.” - .
“No, you didn't absolutely make it; but you praised it
up to the skies and said it was a proof of financial stability
and inexhaustible resources, and a nasty smack in the eye
for the Germans and all that sort of thing; and now you
admit it's not popular. If it's all you said it was, people
ought simply to be loving it and raving about it—but
they're not.”
“Oh, yes,” I said, “some of them are. For instance, if
you met Mr. McKENNA you'd find him perfectly devoted
to it.”
“Oh, don't,” she said.
“Don’t what 2 " I said.
“Don’t conjure up a vision of my meeting Mr.
McKENNA.”
“Why not?” I said. Mr. McKENNA's a very able man.
He once rowed in the Cambridge crew.”
“Yes, yes, I know,” she said; “but that was a good many
years ago, wasn't it? It's had time to wear off. Now
he's just bristling with figures.” -
“And a very good sort of thing to bristle with,” I said.
“If a man must bristle with something let him bristle
with * >
“I daresay you're right,” she said. “You sometimes
are. But I own I like a quiet unobtrusive bristler—the sort
of man who doesn't want to take you beyond ten times ten
in the multiplication table. I'm sure Mr. McKENNA
couldn't be persuaded to stop there. He'd be into rule of
three and vulgar fractions and recurring decimals before you
could turn round, and he'd pile millions and billions and
trillions on your head. Where should I be with a man
like that? I don't even know what four and a half per
cent. is on thirteen pounds seven shillings and ninepence
three farthings. Nor for the matter of that do you—now
do you?”
“Francesca,” I said, “I will be quite honest with you.
I do not know at this moment what four and a-half per
cent. is (or are) on thirteen pounds seven shillings and
ninepence three-farthings. The calculation is complex and
difficult, but if you give me time and a pencil and a piece of
paper I will start on it with every hope of carrying it to a
more or less satisfactory finish ; but I warn you not to be
too sanguine about it. It won't be a large sum—something
well under a pound, I fancy; in fact so small that it's
scarcely worth worrying about. However, if you insist I'll
have a shot at it. Only you must leave me alone in the
room and come back in about an hour and a-half.”
“And there,” said Francesca, “ you have the difference
between you and Mr. McKENNA. If I asked him a thing
like that he'd rattle out the answer without so much as
blinking. ‘Eleven and fivepence and forty-one fifty-thirds
of a penny,' he'd say, or whatever the real answer might
be. “Next, please.' And he could go on like that for ever,
even if he had scores of wives in the room with him.”
“Don’t you think,” I said, “that you are rather jumping
at conclusions about the CHANCELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER 2"
“Well,” she said, “if I see a conclusion simply staring
me in the face I like to go for it quick. You like to go
down on your knees and crawl up to it, and you generally
find it isn't there when you get to it.”
“At any rate,” I said, “I observe the logical processes.”
“There isn't time in these days for logical processes.
Things have to be done sharp and slippy.”
“Like taxation,” I suggested.
“Yes, isn't it monstrous 2 ''

“You don't seem to have thought so much of him when

Newly-joined Officer (at reveille). “CoNFound You !
TRUMPET OF YOURS 1 ''
THAT’s THE second TIME THIS WEEK YOU 'VE WAKED ME UP WITH THAT DASHED
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
For this great while Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick has com-
manded the homage of those who like an interesting story
told with a pleasant touch of distinction. But I am afraid
that in her latest volume, Mr. Broom and His Brother
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), though the story is there—indeed
two stories—the distinction is sadly to seek. The fact is
that the book is composed of a brace of pot-boilers, good
enough by the measure of such things, but astonishingly
below the level that we have learnt to expect from Mrs.
SIDGwick. Having said this, I will admit unblushing that
I read every page of both tales and could have enjoyed
more. The first is about a Prince who is bored with
Princeliness, so he runs away and becomes Mr. Broom,
travelling secretary to a pair of good-hearted vulgarians.
It is also about a fair maid, rich beyond counting, with
whom the supposed Mr. Broom falls in love. Finally it is
about two very wicked villains, male and female, who are
constantly endeavouring, for financial motives, to poison
the heroine or push her over cliffs. I fancy somehow that
Mrs. SIDGwick, having done sufficient violence to her gentle
nature in creating this astonishing pair, was at something of
a loss how to deal with them. For one thing, the number
of tries she allows them to have at poor Patricia, while the
good characters stand about and watch, struck me as an
excess of generosity. Finally, however, the villains run away
unharmed (to bob up serenely in the next story and murder
Somebody else) and Patricia falls into the arms of Mr. Broom.
So he puts on his smartest uniform, which with a fine pre-
vision he appears to have brought with him on purpose,
and everybody bows, and the curtain comes down on a
blaze of regal splendour. All of which is agreeable enough,
but hardly Sidgwickian. Nor is the second story much more
convincing. I can only trust that the author, having shown
what she can do with puppets, will now return to the
humans whom she draws so delightfully.
If ever there was a book in which you might expect
white-hot anger, and find instead a constraint and sobriety
infinitely more eloquent, it is the volume issued under the
auspices of the French Foreign Office, and published in
England, with an introduction by the translator, Mr.
J. O. P. BLAND, under the comprehensive title of Germany's
Violations of the Laws of War (HEINEMANN). Here is an
indictment of an army and a nation absolutely unanswer-
able; deadly in its direct simplicity. There are ten chap-
ters in the book. Each of them deals with some special
variety of crime, such as treachery, violations of treaty, use
of forbidden agents, cruelty, theft and the like. At the
head of each is quoted the undertaking given by Germany
in the articles of the Hague Convention; below in grim
contrast are the Deeds of Germany, such a record of infamy
as can never fade from the recollection of thinking men.
The charges are based partly on the signed and sworn
testimony of responsible witnesses, more often on the
writings of German officers and men, and of these writings,
in the large majority of cases, a photographic fac-simile
accompanies the printed version and translation. No
method could be more utterly damning, for it allows no
possibility of evasion or contradiction. Out of their own
mouths Germans stand here condemned for all time as a
people who have deliberately removed themselves beyond
the pale of civilisation. Before such a record all prattle of
excuse and allowances must sink to an abashed silence.

of paper, fragments from diaries and pocket-books, have
built a barrier that for generations will shut out Germany
from the community of the human race.
To be able to depict a bore without permitting his person-
ality to bore the reader requires an adroitness which very
few novelists possess, and ELLEN THORNEYcRof T FowleR
shows in her latest story, Ten Degrees Backward (Hodder
AND SToUGHToN), that she is not one of them. For the
purposes of the plot it was necessary to convince the reader
that Annabel Kingsnorth was to an almost inhuman extent
endowed with stupidity and lack of humour; and Miss
FowlFR does it by recording her every speech, with the
by the author of The Secret Flat and The Wild Widow,
result that before long one's dislike of Miss Kingsnorth
becomes a comprehensive dislike of the book and everything
in it. A great weariness falls upon one. It was possibly
this weariness that prevented me from being able to assimi-
late the situation for which nine-tenths of the book was
designed to prepare me. As a rule I am not an exacting novel-
reader. Give me time, don't. - -
bustle me, let me brace my-
self up and make the effort,
and I can swallow nearly
anything. But the culmi-
nating point—what Ameri-
cans call the punch—of Ten
Degrees Backward was too
much for me. On my honour
as a Learned Clerk, ' is
this—that a wife dresses
herself up in man's clothes
and passes herself off on
her husband for a long
period of time as his
brother-in-law, and he has
not a suspicion of the truth
till she throws her arms
round his neck and bursts
into tears. It is true that
Miss Fow LER dwells on the
fact that the wife and her
brother were twins and that
the husband's sight was de-

myself. The fact remains that this test of my gift for
deglutition was beyond me. I am sorry, and shall try to
do better next time.
To say a book is excellent is one thing; to say it is
excellent of its sort is a matter so entirely different that I
am afraid I cannot expect Mrs. GEORGE DE HoRNE WAIzEY
to value very highly an appreciation thus qualified; but
really and truly, in regard to her latest venture, Salt of Life
(MILLs AND Boox), there is nothing else for it. That the
class near the head of which it is to be placed is large and
familiar you will understand very readily on hearing that
the story has to do with lots of nice little girls turning into
nice big girls, not finding adventures or even many inci-
dents in the process, but just discovering in the most
natural way imaginable how pleasant it is to look pretty,
how well arranged is a scheme of things that leads in the
Victorian manner to warm homes and the smiles of Baby
Peter. Once in the secret you will not be surprised to

nor that the prettiest had hectic cheeks which eventually
required her to be sacrificed in the interests of pathos; nor,
indeed, that her wraith overlooked the difference between
Canadian and English time in appearing to announce the
event. All this, I say, you might well foresee, but you
might not by any means guess what a nimble way the
authoress has of sliding about the pages, patting and coax-
ing her dutiful children to keep them all marching abreast;
nor the lavish supply of dainty humour with which the
whole procession is besprinkled from 1 to 400. It is this
that makes me cry excellent, and as for the Sort—it is
many people's sort, and very likely yours.
A title like The Wife Who Found Out (WERNER LAURIE),
justifies one in supposing that one is meant to expect a
dubious tale of domestic infelicity. Well, one gets it duly
from Miss WENTwo RTH-JAMEs. But what Lady Carshutt

THE GRAND FLEET.
(With acknowledgments to the American
author of the articles, “With the
Grand Fleet,” written for “The
Times” of London, Eng.)
THE sea l
Salamis looked on it, WILLIAM THE
CoNQUEROR crossed it, LIPTON and
DEWEY have sailed it, Brighton is
situated on it, JoNAH was thrown into
it, and I myself haye been sick of it
on my way to Europe to write articles.
There are different sections of the
sea, and it is not to be inferred that
this part of it is identical with any-
thing scheduled above. On the con-
trary, it is another section. But it
is the same sea—breezy, wet, briny,
with little waves that splash and big
waves that do rather more, and undula-
tions that bring the throbbing heart of
a journalist nearer to his palpitating
mouth. And on this sea—this well-
known, time - honoured, immemorial
Sea—what do I behold 2 A Fleet !
For some reason, unfathomable as
the waters, I am permitted to go round
this Fleet. And I will tell you all
about it.
As a Dry Goods Store is directed by
a Wanamaker, so is this Fleet directed
by an Admiral. JELLICoE is his name,
but JELLICoE is not his nature.
An American might well expect to
find in him some physical resemblance
to NELsoN's column in Trafalgar
Square, but he would be disappointed.
The column would hurt you if it fell
on you; JELLICoE is not like that.
The Commander-in-Chief walks the
deck of the Unsinkable. Like his
great predecessor of the Pinafore, he
carries a telescope under his arm.
When he wishes to see anything dis-
tant he applies the telescope to his eye
—not to a blind eye, as did Lord
NELSON, but to a seeing, hearing,
watching eye. He paces the deck,
and as he paces a tense air of attention
seems to spread galvanically amongst
his men. They stand alert and up-
right; they do not slouch; their hands
are not in their pockets; their backs
are not turned carelessly on their
Admiral.
Yet JELLIcoe is not a harsh or brutal
tyrant; he is a good and kindly man.
He is strong and yet gentle; clean-
shaven and yet devout; and capable,
so they say. His men love him, and
his couriéry will learn to appreciate
him now that I have told it of his real
worth. And always remember that he
bears gladly with neutral journalists.
From the contemplation of JELLICoE
I pass on to other ships and other men.
And here let me tell you that the
Captains and Admirals are chiefly
remarkable for this, that they are not
senile; and that life for them is one
ceaseless round of duties. Would you
have thought it if I had not told you?
. And the ships! Here lie the
giant Hyena and the massive Gnu,
with their glossy guns and shining
Midshipmen, Young men too, these
latter, with not a grey hair amongst
them. Here is the Lady Squadron
—the good Queen Anne, the saucy
Bloody Mary, the Susie that does not
sew shirts. Here rises the Insoluble,
hard hit in the Balkan Peninsula.
The shell made one hole as it came in
and another as it went out, but both
apertures are now closed up—such is
the wonderful thoroughness of naval
organization. Here roll the tiny Des-
troyers, grey as their own sea, black as
their own coal, white as—no, not white
as. And, mind you, every ship has
its complement of well-trained men—
not a German amongst them—and
every gun its adjunct of shot and shell!
At moments I felt that I must be on
my own North American Fleet, and
there came like a flash to me that
memorable phrase of one of my country-
men—“Blood is thicker than water.”
I see it all, not as in a dream, but
in a waking reality—great vessels melt-
ing into horizons and looming out of
distances; gaunt guns and slumbering
torpedoes; winking yard-arms of wire-
less; decks a-scrub and spars a-shine;
canvas that passes in the night. It is
all there.
And through the haze, and the sea,
and the sun-rise and the sun-set, and
all my bag of journalistic tricks—above
and below all this, what is the inner
meaning of this mighty sea and this
storm-tossed Fleet 2 To me it is clear.
Its message--its meaning—is this:
that over the bosom of this selfsame
sea, and under the guns of this self-
same Fleet, a neutral country may
render its invoices and ship its goods
and haul in its dollars in perfect safety
and happiness—yea, even trade its
Christmas purchases with Germany |

Mr. CRUso must have been some time

PUBLIc attention was recently drawn
to the action of the Government Censor
in excising the words “and the kings”
from the well-known line of Mr.
KIPLING's “Recessional":—
“The captains and the kings depart.”
The alleged reason was that no kings
could depart as there were no kings
there; but the excision was really made
on the ground that the Censor could
not admit any reference to the move-
ments of Royalty.
As journalists, however, in spite of
the privileges accorded to them, con-
tinue to indulge in the miscellaneous
citation of English verse, with complete
disregard of military consequences, we
understand that a large number of in-
structions are about to be issued by the

A GENERAL RISING.
THE telephone began it. I walked,
after my custom, briskly into the call-
box, raised the receiver and asked for
the number—a thing I have done for
years. I then extracted from my
pocket the two pennies, which had
been carefully placed there for the
purpose and waited.
The girl's voice at last sounded :
“Put three pennies in the slot and
turn the handle,” she said.
You could have knocked me down
with anything.
“Put how many?” I asked.
“Three pennies in the slot and turn
the handle,” she replied.
“Why three ?” I inquired icily.
“The price has gone up,” she said.
He averted his eyes, and I perceived
that I had hit the truth.
“It's old stock,” I said, “and you
ought to give an old customer the
benefit of it. If you haven't paid extra
on it why should I?”
He said it was impossible for him,
doing the trade he did, to know what
was old stock and what was new. All
he knew was that the tax on tobacco
had gone up and he would shortly
be ruined.
Ibade him a permanent farewell and
in another shop purchased a cheap
tobacco which burnt my tongue and is
burning it even now as I write.
Then, having a cold, I went to the
chemist's for some asperin. For a
tiny bottle of tabloids he asked two
shillings.
Having taken my seat I asked him
if he had heard of the great advance.
He stopped in whatever diabolical
task he was performing at his box of
tricks and turned round excitedly.
“Has there?” he said. “Where?

“No,” I said, “in price. Every-
thing's dearer.”
He completed his grisly preparations,
and then, having got me well into his
power, he began to talk. He said that
it was an awful bore and he was very
sorry, but he and his partner, much
against their own wish, had been forced
to—ah—slightly augment their fees.

“MY DEAR
sure that's risen.”
He finished my poor
mouthin silence, which,
at any rate, was some-
thing to be glad about.
Such was by now the
state of my nerves that
I literally sobbed with
joy and relief when, on
entering a post-offic
and inquiring of the
young lady the price of
a penny stamp, she re-
plied, “One penny.” I
felt as if I would never
buy anything else. Is
the gum, I wonder, nu-
tritious enough to sup-
port life?
That evening I sat
down and wrote a
letter to be sent to the
editors of all the papers

“I'm sorry, but it can't be done,”
she replied. -
“All right,” I said. “You can tell
them that in future all I have to say
I shall write on halfpenny postcards.
They've lost a good friend.” And I
came away.
This bitter experience proved to be a
fitting prelude to a disenchanting day.
Going next to my tobacconist for
a new half-pound tin of what used
once to be harmlessly and playfully
called “Plutocrat Mixture,” for which
I have been in the habit of paying at
the rate of sevenpence an ounce, I put
down two half-crowns, expecting four-
pence change.
“I’m very sorry,” said the tobac-
conist, “but it's gone up. It's ten-
pence an ounce now.”
“Why?” I asked.
“The new taxation,” he said.
“I don't believe you got this stock in
since the Budget,” I said.
“Absurd,” I said.
“You won't get it cheaper,” he said.
“It's gone up, It's going up more
too.”
“I used to get that for tenpence or
less,” I said as I left the shop. “Two
shillings! Pooh.”
But I had to pay two shillings before
I had done, or go without. That's
the worst of things that one really
wants; the shopkeepers always get
you in the end. In spiting them you
merely cut off your nose.
I then went to be shaved.
“I’m sorry,” said the barber, “but
we've had to add twopence to the
charge. The War, you know.”
I said I knew it.
“How 2 " he asked.
“It’s in the air,” I said.
“Oh, no, Sir,” he replied, “not the

reluctance an old engagement in the

ZEPPELINS AND OTHER “MUGK.”
I RECENTLY selected a remote East
Anglian village for the purpose of a short
holiday and much-needed rest. My one
recreation was to discuss with the in-
habitants the Great War, of which I
found some of them had heard. Indeed,
the visit of a Zeppelin had struck terror
into the heart of at least one old woman.
“Them there Zett'lins,” she said—“I
almost shruk as I heerd the mucky var-
mints a-shovellin' on the coals—darel
dare ! How my pore heart did beat l”
“But they weren't likely to trouble
you?” I suggested, for she lived in the
entre of three isolated single-room
cottages dedicated to the poor.
But the old lady thought “them
Jarmans" might mistake these pic-
turesque little dwellings for the homes
of the gentry. So she crept for safety,
she said, into her next-door neighbour's
bed o' nights, for she dasn't sleep alone.
The German frightfulness had struck
home here right enough, which would
doubtless bring much joy to the Teuton
bosom, were it known.
A bomb from the Zeppelin had
dropped near the church, which it lit
up. An onlooker informed me that it
“fared to him like the body of the
chach a-floatin' away—that it did and
all ! It made a clangin',” he added,
Special (to Citizen retired for the night, whom he has called up). “Your GRound-FLooB
wiNDow's open ; AND Now I MUsT REPort You Fort showING Too Much LIGHT.”
“like a covey of lorries with their
innards broke loose"—not an inapt
description to one who had some per-
sonal recollections to draw on.
Another inhabitant, with a face as
expressionless as the “turmots” he
was hoeing, informed me that he had
two boys fighting. “One on 'em is in
France, wherever that might be,” he
said, “and Jimmy's in that hare old
Dardelles.” This, be it noted, is a land
of contractions, and the old inhabitant
invariably clips out of recognition the
names of familiar places.
“When did the elder go out?” I
asked. “I can't rightly say,” he replied
after much cogitation, “but it might be
a yare ago come muck-spreadin’.” The
word “muck,” like the article itself, is
of universal application in Norfolk, and
the local calendar usually starts from
that odoriferous season. On condoling
once with a young woman, wearily
waiting for her defaulting lover, I saw
tears in her eyes as she said, “We girls
are just so much muck; we have to wait
till the men come and cart us away.”
A Belgian family had been imported
into the locality, though since removed.
I inquired if they were liked. “Well
enough,” was the answer, “but they
only spoke that hare Blemish, which
in course no one could rightly under-
stand.”

THE WATCH DOGS.
XXVII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, You are not
to assume from this long interval of
silence that I have conceived a sudden
dislike for you. So long as you con-
tinue to purvey cigarettes I shall
always love you, and for all that I
have bettered myself by moving from
a platoon to an army I am still not
roud.
I don't know exactly how my change
of situation got started, but I know
that the affair was conducted through
the “usual channels.” Have you ever
met the “usual channels,” my friend ?
Have you ever tried to correspond from
the bottom to the top of the military
machine? If you want to experience
the sensation, you had better take the
first opportunity; there aren't many
wars long enough for the purpose. .
I incline to think that the fellow
who first started my affair, light-
heartedly coining the now immortal
text, “Lieut. Henry, transfer, pro-
posed for, of,” has lived to regret his
folly, and that the only reason why
I am left where I am is that all con-
cerned eventually got so tired with the
process of getting me up from a platoon
to an army that none could be induced
to take the pains to get me back from
the army to another platoon.
Be that as it may, the idea, when
first mooted, caught on ; it became a
vogue. All the people who matter had
a dip in it. A.B.C.'s and Assistant
A.B.C.'s, X.Y.Z.'s and Deputy X.Y.Z.'s
formed the daily habit of bandying my
name about amongst them for each
other's information, please; for each
other's guidance, please; for each other's
necessary action, please. No one said,
“This correspondence must now cease,”
and only I was kept out of it, never
so much as a picture-postcard coming
my way.
Now you may go on increasing
correspondence as long as buff slips
and indelible pencils hold out, and no
one (in war-time) will say you nay.
But the time arrives when the clip
becomes unequal to the duty for which
it is attached. In my case the papers
happened to be in the hands of the
Adjutant when the clip struck further
work. The Adjutant had not the
necessary daring or initiative to divide
the bundle in two. There seemed to
be nothing to do but to lose the
lot and risk being lost himself . . .
and then, by chance, he caught sight
of me, which reminded him that the
“Reference” of the minutes and memos
was, after all, a “reasonable creature,
in existence,” capable of bearing its
own troubles. And so at last the
documents (in a parcel) came to me
with a note, “For your information,
guidance and necessary action.” No
“please,” mark you!
Being then a child in these matters I
read the correspondence right through,
starting from the top and working
down to the bottom. From the chaos
only one thing at all definite emerged:
this Lieutenant whom all the trouble
was about would eventually have to
report to someone. The never-to-be-
forgotten maxim of the advertisement
occurred to me: “Do IT Now !” But to
whom to report? The Adjutant being
out of the question, I thought of our
regimental Quartermaster, a kindly and
intelligent man; I reported to him.
He told me that on these occasions
there were two alternatives only, the
one being to read from the bottom to
the top, the other not to read at all.
For the future he strongly recommended
the latter; in the present instance he
was not concerned and didn't propose
to be. There's no getting round Quar-
termasters, so I went along to the
nearest rail-head to do some more re-
porting there. I got in touch with the
R.T.O., and, ignoring his air of detach-
ment, I kept in touch with him till
lunch-time, stood him a good meal and
then took him and forced him into my
confidence. In his anxiety to work off
some of his own papers on to me he
forgot to return the original pile, so I
left him without another word, though
I should have liked to take him to task
for describing me, in my Movement
Order, as a “consignment.”
It was now clear to me that, having
a movement order, it was up to me to
move. Judging from the pace of the
train it had no movement order or, at
most, a very slight one. The motto of
trains in the zone of the armies is “J'y
suis ; j'y reste.” Passengers have just
to sit still and watch themselves being
overtaken by battalions on the march,
using their own judgment to decide
whether the train has stopped and, if
so, whether for good or just tempor-
arily for a day or so. For my own
part I was prepared to stay where I
was for eternity, and had nearly done
so when I found myself at the town,
necessarily anonymous, at which
G.H.Q. resides. Feeling that what
is good enough for G.H.Q. is good
enough for me, I got out. Fresh from
my long period of rest, I began report-
ing again, starting with a Military
Policeman and ending with a General,
not one of your generals of everyday
life but something out of the way.
G.H.Q. proposed to put me into
another train, but I urged that I was a
man with a lot of dependants and not
much constitution; so they relented and
put me on a motor-bicycle instead.
They told me where to go to, started
the engine, wished me luck, and left it
to Providence or the process of attrition
to effect the necessary halt. A fortu-
nate skid brought me to a standstill at
my proper destination, and, having in-
dicated to an orderly the direction in
which the bicycle was proceeding when
I last saw it, I brushed the mud off
me and looked about. Above all else,
a notice-board with Camp Commandant
printed across it made an irresistible
appeal to me.
He fixed me up with a billet and
a mess and then took steps to get
rid of me. I explained, with sub-
mission, that to go now only meant
to come back and report again later,
so he settled down to the matter
and made out a list of further likely
victims for my relentless persecution.
I asked him to name the likeliest. He
put his money on the “G” Office, as
being the most recent indentors for
nibs, blotting-paper and a new chair
and table. So I stepped across to the
“G” Office, frowned at the orderlies,
smiled at the Sergeant-Major, shook
hands with the Lieutenants, saluted all
the others, and, before I realised the
grim horror of it, found myself at work,
where I've stayed ever since, although
you might have supposed that this is
war, not work.
But it isn't all in an office, far away
from the smoke and dirt. No, there
are two great phrases for which the
historian of this war will have a rubber
stamp; the one is “to circulate,” the
other “to function.” But there are
advantages in having a home to return
to of an evening. And it all has some-
thing to do with the War, as I'll
hope to show you in my next letter
or two.
Meanwhile I do wonder what the
R.T.O. did about that correspondence.
Probably he made a dozen efforts to
get it “Passed to you, please,” received
it back time after time, and eventually
in despair set it alight and cast himself
into the flames.
Yours ever, HENRY.

LAST NIGHT I says To 'IM, ‘’Oo Goes THERE” AN' HE says, “FRIEND !';
HER GRACE’S HOSPITAL.
WITH that close secrecy which seems
inseparable from all things military, it
was not until nearly the end of an all-
day train journey that our destination
was divulged to us. It was the Duchess
of Blankshire's Hospital, Well,
that was fitting at least, and I tried to
forget my wounds in framing a suitable
greeting to her Grace when she met
me on the platform. “Ah, Duchess,”
I would say, “but how kind of you to
come down.” Beyond that I could
make no progress. I decided to leave
the rest to the inspiration of the
moment. The last hour was an Irish
mile, and by the time I reached
my strength, temper, patience and
courtesy were utterly exhausted. I
was carried out and into the ambu-
lance. All sense of decency was then
thoroughly shaken out of me, and I
was brought to the door of the Hospital
thirsting for someone's blood. And
the Duchess hadn't come to the station.
She must have been misinformed about
the train. I prepared to talk down her
apologies. “Not at all, my dear
Duchess; how could you tell?” etc.
Taken out of the ambulance I was
carried to the ducal entrance-hall. Here
I came in contact with the System
(with a capital S) which dominates the
place. A huge ledger, a lady clerk, an
assistant lady clerk, an imposing young
officer directed their united efforts on
me. But where was my hostess? I
specially wanted to work in that casual
“My dear Duchess.” I had practised
it so well that it would sound as if I
used the title every day.
“Name?” said the I.Y.O.
I told him.
“Age?”
“Twenty-eight.”
“Regiment 2"
“Sixth Blankshires.”
“Ah, Territorials,” he said, as if a
wounded Territorial was not quite the
same as a wounded soldier.
“Well, I have T. on my tunic, haven't
I?” I snapped.
“Yes, yes,” he said hastily and con-
fused. “Age?”
“Still twenty-eight. I'll let you
know the minute I have a birthday.”
“Where are you wounded ?”
“Head, back, thigh, calf, foot.”
I was taking no risks of clumsy
handling from orderlies.
“Date 2 ”
“September 5th.”
“Tetanus injection?”
“Yes.”
“Date 2 ”
“September 4th.”
He looked puzzled. I knew that
would beat him. He didn't know I'd
been wounded on different days.
“The day before the wound 2"
“Yes. You see I heard it coming.
Long range shrapnel, you know.”
Then they carried me to my ward
and there came to meet me quite the
youngest thing in nurses you could
imagine. She looked about sixteen,
but I suppose she was more as they
don't let them loose so early. She had
pencil on lip, paper in hand, and withal
a serious and inquiring look on her
round face.
“Oh, what's the matter with you?”
she asked, as if expecting me to say I
had fallen off a lorry or tried conclu-
sions with a taxi. I looked at her
solemnly as I explained: “I’ve got
wounded in this War that's going on—
against Germany, you know.” It was
perhaps too bad. She was covered
with confusion.
The large ward was glittering white.
Graceful girls moved about and looked

quite busy. Then one in blue-and-
white came to me and smiled. She
asked about my wounds. Nothing
could have been more soothing than
her eyes—blue and clear. - I sank in
them for a bit and then she melted away
into dreamland. . . .
“You see it was this way, Duchess,”
I was saying over a cigar as we sat
together on the verandah after din-
ner. . . “Time to get washed,” said
a fierce voice in my slumbers. . . -
Yes, it was full of system. It took
me two hours and five different appli-
cations to get some soap and water
outside the routine. But I got it. It
was a triumph. Then the curtains.
They must all be pulled to one parti-
cular side. I got mine put in the
middle for the sake of my eyes. All
day long I recited to each successive
rectifier of the curtain how the light
hurt my eyes. Of course I was asleep
sometimes and they got it put right.
Then it appeared that one's nose must
be in line with the centre fold of the bed
mat. I was glad I had a straight nose.
On the following afternoon, when I
was feeling a little exhausted after many
curtain, pillow and blanket disagree-
ments, there came a lady with a friendly
greeting. . . I didn't see what her job
was, so I said sternly and suspiciously,
“Have you been here before?” -
“Oh, yes,” she said cheerfully, “I’m
often here.” -
“But have you come to see me
before ?” . . . . . - - -
“Yes, I have,” she answered.
Then I saw her eyes. Splosh! I
was in again right over the ears.
“Yes, I remember you now,” I said
dreamily; “you were dressed in blue.
It suits you better.

“Well, I'll think about it,” she
laughed. “How are things going?”
“Oh, not badly at all, but of course
in some minor matters I could tell the
Duchess how to improve things.”
“Tell me,” she smiled.
Won't you always
“Well, she didn't come to meet me
yesterday, and wasn't even in the hall.
Of course it may have been the War
Office that was to blame. They do say
KITCHENER is very busy these days.”
“That was too bad; but hasn't she
been to see you since?”
“No,” I said gloomily.
“Well, next time you're wounded
she'll make a point of going to the
station, I'm sure. Now, what else?”
“Well, these plates are made so that
they spin round and round on the tray,
making it difficult, if not impossible, to
eat with one hand. You see, you can't
corner the stuff with your fork.” And
I told her many things of equal im-
portance. . .
“All right. I must fly now, but I'll
not forget anything you've said.”
“Nurse, who was that 2 " I said
when she had gone.

I turned over and groaned. And I
hadn't managed to work in “My dear

body who has told her Grace of

a few moments, that she looks best

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, October
19th.-Of a hundred and twenty-one
Questions on the Paper twenty-five
addressed to PRIME MINISTER. Covered
various controversial points. Put down
chiefly by his nominal supporters, the
Providences that sit below Gangway
and look after the higher welfare of
the poor P.M. Seemed to promise
lively interlude. PREMIER would either
snub his esteemed but inquisitive fol-
lowers, or he would make statements
on a succession of important problems.
The unexpected happened, as it not
infrequently does in House of Com-
mons. Of all men HENRY HERBERT is
on the sick list, he who as Premier
beats the record in length of time for
not having been absent a single day
from work owing to illness.
HANDEL Booth disconsolate. Ground
out mournful note of inquiry as to how
long PREMIER likely to be absent and
whether meanwhile MINISTER OF MUNI-
TIONs, man of leisure upon whose hands
time hangs heavily, might not under-
take to gratify patriotic curiosity of
Members below Gangway by replying
to miscellaneous inquiries.
SPEAKER did not know how long
LEADER of House likely to be away.
Could only hope “the time would be
very short.”
General cheer expressed concurrence
with this desire. Bad time just now
for the captain to be off the bridge.
CARson another absentee at Question
time. When Colonel Sir F. E. SMITH,
having doffed his khaki, presented him-
self to reply for ATToRNEY-GENERAL he
was greeted by hilarious cheer. Being
inarticulate its precise meaning was left
undefined.
We know all about what has happened
in the Cabinet during the last ten
days, and why CARSON, most amiable,
unassertive of men, could stick it no
longer.”
Questions disposed of, House got into
Committee on Budget Bill. As usual,
real business thus entered upon served
as signal for emptying of House. Amid
bustle of departure HERR GINNELL came
to front with motion to exclude Ireland
from imposition of Tea Duty. Genially
announced intention to move analogous
amendment in respect of subsequent
clauses imposing for War purposes new
taxes or increase of duty.
Summed up situation in Ireland in
pregnant sentence. Most of the money
raised by these taxes imposed upon
Ireland was, he said, spent in England
on production of munitions of war.

brought about, young Irishmen were

compelled to enlist and fight for young

worked in the munition factories.

memorial custom a Cabinet Minister,

the Government and being desirous of
explaining his motive, seats himself at .
Gangway-end of Bench immediately
behind that where his former col-
leagues sit. Thence, thirty-five years
ago, W. E. ForsTER rose, driven out of
office by the untiring animosity of the
Parnellites. Later in the same year
John BRIGHT resigned the important
office now held by the ARTISTIc WIN-
STON, and from this corner seat ex-
plained inability to agree with his
colleagues in that British intervention
in Egyptian affairs which has proved
an untold blessing to a tyrant-ridden
impoverished race.
EDWARD CARSON, having resigned
Attorney-Generalship and withdrawn
from Cabinet, made to-day unique
record. Returning to old quarters on
Front Opposition Bench, he thence, like
Truthful James, “rose to explain.”
A ready, practised speaker, he on
this solemn occasion did not trust him-
self to make a speech. He read a
paper. Essay composed in excellent
taste. Not a word of argument or
criticism, much less of recrimination.
Paid personal tribute to unvarying
courtesy of PRIME MINISTER. Would
not suggest that his views about
difficulties arising in Eastern theatre
of war might possibly be compared
with those of men who have much
more experience and greater wisdom in
dealing with such situations. At same
time they were “very strongly held,
conscientiously and patriotically.”
In such circumstances he thought his
continuance in office would be rather a
source of weakness than of strength.
Therefore he had withdrawn.
Outburst of applause that greeted his
rising was confined to political friends
on Opposition Benches. On resuming
his seat a general cheer paid tribute to
the excellent tone and temper of his
remarks.
Business done.—Sat up in Committee
on Budget Bill till a quarter past one
in the morning. The stage still un-
finished.
Thursday.—Fresh hue-and-cry after
the anonymous but immortal Censor
who has been severely sub-editing KIP-
LING and BRowNING. House particu-
larly anxious to know whether it be
possible that this century has produced
two such geniuses. Did one deal
with KIPLING, whilst the other tackled
BRowNING 2 Or was one mighty mind
equal to both triumphs 2 The HoME
SECRETARY, alike cautious and agile,
would not commit himself on this point.
Really couldn't say; believed there
might be two of them.
Business done.—Postal and Telegraph
Rates Bill went through Committee,
was reported and read a third time.

AT THE FRONT.
IF you should happen to get into
one of these wars and someone tells
you to take over a farm, don't you
have it without a character. You've
got no idea how farms vary.
There is the Never-been-crumped
kind, and the Not-been-crumped-for-
months kind, and the May-be-crumpeds,
and Will-probably-be-crumpeds, and
the Sure-to-be-crumpeds. If on in-
quiry you find that the farm they are
trying to cajole you into belongs to
either of the last two classes, you will
do well to send on an advance party
with a ton of gun-cotton and then
report farm non-existent on arrival;
or to apply for a transfer to the Volun-
º Munition-Workers' Guild.
n the other hand you may enjoy
in the healthier types an epoch of
* peace. Dead Spy Farm is in
the second class. Except that we
have to supply working parties of one
hundred-and-fifty nightly—which is a
difficult sort of trick to bring off with
a garrison of one hundred-and-three—
we are left undisturbed to the contem-
plation of autumn tints.
Whoever the deceased spy was, he
had some taste in farms. His moat is
an object lesson in how much duck-
weed you can get in without crowding
out all the water. Round the moat
runs an avenue of trees in “Fall suit-
ings" that recall the glories of Addison's
Walk. The buildings themselves are
portly, circumstantial and four-square,
as all good farms are. There is a
garden—not all it used to be—a well,
and three cats, sole representatives of
the late tenant. The mushrooming and
ratting are satisfactory, and recent
bags include a moorhen and a foreign-
looking cat suspected of espionage.
The whole intact, except for three shell
holes and portions of window glass.
Talking about working parties, there
is a report that our battalion is to be
sent to some other country where there
is still good digging to be had. Here-
abouts digging resembles the ploughing
of some immemorial field; one rather
wonders whether there is anything
about the original trenches in Dooms-
day Book or Magna Charta.
Take F. 107. We first knew F. 107
as an unrevetted communication trench
with a sandbag floor. A brigade fatigue
traversed and footboarded it and called
it “King's Road.” An R.E. party
dopped in one night with firing-steps,
and altered the name to “King's
Castle.” Three days later it rained
for ten minutes and the sides fell in,
and it was known as “The Marsh"
and officially disused, until one day a
very high sort of officer came round
the lines and said all disused trenches
in the system must be reclaimed.
This order was not popular, as it
would have entailed the prolonging of
the War to about 1977. However, we
began on “The Marsh" and laboured
bitterly sixteen nights with hurdles and
sandbags, and piles for the footboards,
and called it “Half-done Terrace,” to
immortalise a sound beginning... The
immortalisation lasted a fortnight, when
a new official programme of the trenches
fixed it until further notice as F. 107.
Now we are fitting it with model dug-
outs. Of course the trench is not
occupied, but it may be some day, and
in the meantime it is bad for the troops
to be idle.
This affair of picks and shovels has
interested us as proving that the Angels
who retreated from Mons are not the
only incident in the War that defies
normal explanation. It happened that

“IRIS INTERVENES.”
WITHouT wishing to boast, I may
say that I have never lived in a house
with a hedge only three-and-a-half feet
high to screen me from my neighbour's
garden. Perhaps that is why I have
never been on really intimate terms
(such as would be encouraged by
this lack of privacy) with any Russian
lady who has done time for knifing
her husband and retreated to a
British suburb to give her reputa-
tion a rest. I am not therefore in
a position to say whether Iris Olga
Iranovna, as depicted by Mr. JoHN
HASTINGs TURNER, was true to type.
But if one who is no judge of
these exotics may hazard an opin-
ion she seemed to me to have her
farcical moments. And I could
well understand how her tempestu-
ous intrusion into the next-door
household, which contained, among
other strange things, a morbidly
impressionable youth, would con-
vulse Mr. Henry Cumbers, a
thorough-paced epicier, with a fixed
“standard” of morality and a par-
ticular horror of necks exposed to
the eye of day. -
And indeed she was a bird of so
rare a plumage that she might
easily have astonished a man of
riper experience and more open -
mind. For in addition to a ravish-
ing beauty, to whose seductive and
troublous quality she was never
tired of alluding, she claimed a
record of unsullied virtue; and, if
you questioned it, she was on you.

threw doubt upon her past, and might be worse. We're well on into the Third Act, and
tears of genuine distress (it was Cum-
bers' one human weakness that he
could not stand a woman's tears) moved
him to sympathy. They exchanged
confidences. From him she learned
that, however narrow a man's preju-
dices, if he can inspire trust in his
fellows he has achieved something.
And she knew that she had never
inspired trust in the men that had
come under her spell. By her, in
turn, he was taught that the devotion
of his wife deserved a better reward
than the proprietary tyranny with
which he repaid it.
And so all ended well. The document
was recovered; Cumbers, his night-out

ishment. After her first fury, she was
content to stimulate the infatuation
of the weedy stripling, his son; but
this was too easy fruit, and she turned
to a more difficult and noble revenge.
A certain precious document containing
the design of a new motor car had been
lodged, for reasons that carried no sort
of conviction, in the keeping of Cumbers.
On its safety depended his career
and the fulfilment of an ambition which
embraced a residence in Kensington—
no less. Over the dividing hedge, to
whose inadequacy I have referred, she
was witness of the theft of these papers
and set herself to recover them. The
breakdown of her pursuing car entailed
a night in the sole society of Cumbers
on the open Dover Road. Out of
this enforced intimacy a mutual under-
standing was born. “You never get
to know one another,” said Iris, in one
of her rare lapses into probability, “till

appreciation of his wife's merits; and
Iris married a fellow-countryman, who,
if he knew her too well to put a very
perfect trust in her, had biceps enough
to control her explosions at need.
Miss LENA Ashwell, played Iris with
a most contagious vivacity, and carried
off the preposterousness of everything
with a delightful assurance. Mr. A. E.
GEORGE, in the part of Cumbers, was
too bearish at first in the family circle;
but his human qualities came out in the
end. Miss MAY WHITTY as his wife was
human all the time. Sound work was
done by Mr. HENRY DEAs, whose utter-
ances were stuffed with American slang
to the point of congestion; by Miss
AURIOL LEE, whose appearance, much
too fleeting, gave distinction to the part
of a suburban lady a little above her
environment; and by Mr. Owen Rough-
wooD, Iris's betrothed, who was a model
of restrained and confident muscularity.
Mr. TURNER has a promising gift of
Things
humour, but now and then a preten-
tious epigram showed that he had not
escaped the snare of young authors.
One of these days he may give us a
good character play, or a good farce or
a good melodrama. Even this medley
of all three had many attractions.
It is most regrettable that his first
production should have collided with
the Zeppelin season. It was no fault
of his or of the players that the audience
was so small. For myself, I took com-
fort in the thought that the moon was
nearing her full circle; that Artemis,
in fact, as well as her sister Olympian,
Iris, was “intervening.” O. S.
“THE CASE of LADY CAMBER."
Lady Camber's case, though it
very nearly came to the Old Bailey,
in actual fact got no farther than
the nursing home run by Harley
Napier, F.R.C.S., in Brook Street,
for titled people who had lost
weight (which made me wonder
where his surgical qualifications
came in ; had his patients needed
their weight reducing I should, of
course, have understood at once).
Now this Napier was a strenuous
"A fellow; he had a “life-work.” In
| addition to the fattening of the
leaner aristocracy by his novel
(surgical?) methods, he had con-
trived to solve a problem which has
engaged the attention of ambitious
experts all down the ages. He had
discovered halene, a poison with-
out taste, colour, odour or re-
action. Apparently all he did with
it was to give it the place of honour
in his poison cupboard for Mr.
WACHELL to hang his tale on. A
friendly fellow too. I have invari-
ably found medical men strangely
reticent about the technique of their
craft, which cannot always have been
due to ignorance. But Napier was
always delighted to postpone any im-
portant weight-producing operation or
to leave a patient like Lady Camber in
the article of death to the attentions
of the obviously inadequate Sir Bed-
ford Slufter, F.R.C.P., in order to
explain the precise properties of his
entirely irrelevant invention halene, or
to prophesy with regard to his patients
exactly and in highly technical terms
what would happen if all went well.
When it didn't, with superb resource he
would hand his case to Slufter, who
would promptly lose it.
All of which would not have been
noteworthy if it had not been for Nurse
Yorke, who loved our too preoccupied
Napier besides helping him to manu-
facture halene and mismanage his cases;

capricious villain who had once sug-

gested to Esther Yorke a liaison as the
price of some service he had done her.
Why, after having the nerve to ask
this young lady of birth, breeding and
beauty to be his mistress, he should
thereafter have been so unworldly wise
as to make an impossible dancer his
wife no sort of adequate suggestion is
offered; nor why, even after his wel-
come release from Lady Camber at the
hands of Slufter, Napier and Nurse
Yorke, he so decidedly refuses ever to
consider the question of marrying that
entirely attractive young lady, but
merely repeats his insulting sugges-
tion. A complex character, our Camber.
Napier is also complex. Not till he
suspects Esther Yorke of murder (this is
where halene comes in ; she keeps the
key of the poison cupboard) does he
begin to love her. The proof forth-
coming that Lady Camber's death is
due to entirely natural and professional
causes, Esther and Napier are united
and halene goes back to the shelf.
The play was admirably cast. You

manufacturer; he is artist enough to

sonality, and his reward is the smooth

No. XXIX.
(From the King of the HELLENEs.)
MY DEAR WILLIAM, I think you are pressing me a little
too hard. You must remember what my situation is. The
mass of my people have no love whatever for your people
or for the Austrians. That may strike you as being both
strange and deplorable, for I know what your opinion is
of the mild virtues and superlative attractiveness of the
Germans, and how firmly you believe that all these virtues
and all this attractiveness, with ten thousand other glorious
and lovable qualities, are concentrated and embodied in
º I have often noticed how angry it makes you to
e told that somebody doesn't like you, and your sister
SoPHIE has often warned me that in your presence I must
pretend to believe that you are universally beloved, not
merely on account of your splendour and power and wealth,
but rather and chiefly because of your own innate goodness
and geniality and benevolence. “If they
I have heard you say, “I shall certainly smash them; and
if they keep on not liking me I shall only smash them
more and more.” That is one way, certainly, of ensuring
your popularity, though I am not convinced that it is
always a very efficacious way. You tried it in Belgium,
and the only result, so far as I have been able to
judge, has been to make the Belgians detest you with a
hatred which it will take years to mitigate and centuries
to abolish. And, even when centuries shall have passed, I
can imagine how some Belgian of the future will point out
to a stranger the ruins and the graveyards which are the
country's monuments and will explain to him how they
were caused by an Emperor who had a passion for popu-
larity and chose this method of gratifying it.
Remember when I speak in this way I am not expressing
my own personal opinions so much as those of any detached
and impartial observer, and it is with him that you must
be angry rather than with me. For my own part, since I
married into your family I have tried to live a quiet life by
schooling myself to think of you as you think of yourself.
I cannot say it was an easy task, for, to tell you the
truth, you are, like caviare, something of an acquired taste,
and the palate must be educated to relish you. Whether
I have arrived at that perfect and enthusiastic liking which
you seem to demand I cannot say, but I know I have done
my best, and some gratitude is due to me.
But at present, as I say, you are pressing me a little too
hard. VENIZELos—forgive me for mentioning his name—
was supported by a majority in the country and in the
Chamber. He was determined to act the part of an
honourable man and to regard also the honour and the
interest of his country by carrying out the provisions of our
treaty with Serbia. I intervened and dismissed him from
his post as Prime Minister, and appointed in his place a
man who would be willing to stand by with folded arms
while Serbia, the heroic but unfortunate, was crushed to
the earth by yourself and the false brigand of Bulgaria
whom you had suborned for your purpose. All this I have
done against the will of my people, not knowing from day
to day how long I might be able to hold them in hand,
since they are a gallant people and have a clear sense of
justice. Therefore you must not press me to go any
further, for a throne in these days is an unsteady structure
for those who would attempt to secure themselves in it by
imitating the autocratic methods of a German Kaiser and
War Lord. Be satisfied with the allies you have—with
FERDIN AND the fox of the Balkans, and with Turkey the

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ALREADY Christmas is not far below the horizon, and those
of us who have the good fortune to be uncles will shortly
be reminded of the great problem of presents. It is safe to
suppose that the pictorial wrapper that covers The Book of
the Thin Red Line (LONG MANs) will attract many eyes.
The volume within it could hardly be bettered as a present
for a British boy. In his pleasant preface Sir HENRY
NEwBoLT explains that, although the stories of six great
soldiers which comprise the book are historically true, he
has “tried to tell them as adventures.” No one certainly
need be afraid of dulness in these heart-stirring records,
which range from the exploits of RoberT BLAKENEY,
gazetted ensign to the 28th when he was fifteen, to those
of STONEWALL JACKSON, concerning whom the chaplain's
prayer at the unveiling of his monument ended with the
tribute quoted here: “When in Thine inscrutable decree it
was ordained that the Confederacy should fail, it became
necessary for Thee to remove Thy servant, STONEwALL
JACKSON." Briefly, this is a book of real heroes, written
in precisely the way to appeal to the hero-worshippers for
whom it is intended. Not the least of its charms for lads
young and old will be the spirited illustrations in colour
and line by Mr. STANLEY L. Wood. There is one picture
especially, of the charge of the Scots Greys at Waterloo,
so full of the spirit of battle that I shall be astonished if
countless schoolrooms do not award it the thumb-mark of
highest popularity. A most timely book.
I suppose there can be few men more fitly placed for the
composition of a volume of entertaining gossip than Mr.
LESLIE WARD. Therefore it is only natural that his book,
Forty Years of “Spy” (CHATTo AND WINDUs) is as pleasant
a collection of cheery and amusing memories as any that
this reminiscent age has provided. For forty years Mr.
WARD has been the observant chiel' in English society,
taking notes of its prominent members—a chiel' not only
observant but witty, as the stories in the present book go
to prove. It is a work of which criticism is quite
impossible. One can but mention that it contains repro-
ductions of dozens of Mr. WARD's most famous drawings,
with in many cases some apt and illuminating anecdote
about the subjects—victims, the author usually calls them.
As an instance of his own sly turn of humour, I liked
especially the comment that accompanies a singularly
pleasant sketch of Miss CHRISTABEL PANKHURST : “I did
not discuss the subject in which she was so absorbed lest
by adverse criticism I might disturb the charm of expres-
sion I found in her face.” There surely speaks the perfect
gentle caricaturist. Elsewhere we find a wonderful store
of recollections about every kind of celebrity—human, I
was going to say, and divine; certainly the Church is re-
markably well represented, Bishops in their shovel hats
being (in the words of W. S. GILBERT, concerning whom,
by the way, there is that rarest thing now, a quite new
story) plentiful as tabby cats. Clubs, colleges, and govern-
ments are equally reviewed, not to mention distinguished
foreigners and dramatists (there is a delightful tale of
CHARLES BRookfield trying to persuade the editor of The
Lancet to publish a Christmas number)—in short, every
phase of social life has yielded material for this most witty
and welcome espiomage.

He certainly hit on one of the most ingenious dodges for
getting rid of a rival in love, and at the same time putting
himself ace-high (as he would also have expressed it) with
the loved one, that I have ever encountered in fiction.
There was trouble between the United States and Mexico.
American guns were at El Paso, Texas, their muzzles
pointing across the Rio Grande, ready for trouble if it
should come. The situation was tense and a single injudi-
cious act would precipitate war. In command of these
guns was Major Vandyke : under him his rival, Captain
Eagleston March. The Major sent the Captain an order
to fire the guns. No sooner was it done than he appeared,
raging; denied having ever given the order, and made a
spectacular dash across the river to soothe the Mexicans by
explaining that it was all a mistake. Major Vandyke was thus

with all the vehemence of the middle-ageing I must protest
against the suggestion that we came within the era of
crinolines and ringlets. However, let it pass. The book has
its own charm and interest as a minute analysis of young
womanhood, and the author has built up in Rose a
character sufficiently attractive for us to bear the prospect
of further revelations with equanimity.
No doubt it was because Mr. F. FRANKFoRT MooRE
admired (as we all do) the wonderful and self-sacrificing
work performed since the War started by our amateur
-- 1 nurses that he set out to write
a book that should commemo-
rate some of their difficulties
and triumphs. He may con-
ceivably have been influenced
by the consideration that as
everyone is more or less con-
cerned with nursing nowadays
there would be a safe welcome
for a volume about it. So far
excellent. But I am sorry that
he decided to produce it in the
form of fiction. Because my
honest impression of The
Romance of a Red Cross Hos-
pital º is that,
while the hospital part is in-
teresting enough, the romance
is boresome to a degree. As a
story also it contains certain
features that, to say the least,
leave me unconvinced. The first
of these is the attitude of the
hero, who, having been told by
i two doctors that he had an
| enlarged heart, let concealment
California. It must have required resolution on their part
to keep themselves from abandoning the plot in favour
of a description of the tour, but they resisted it. The trip
takes place off the stage, and the story moves on without it.
It was bound to happen. I knew that with so many of
our male novelists producing vast volumes about the life,
the whole life, and nothing but the life of their heroes, we
should not have to wait much longer for a companion
feminine picture. Well, now Miss NETTA SYRETT has
done it, or perhaps I should more correctly say begun it,
since on the last page of The Victorians (FISHER UN wiN)
she hints darkly that “the story of Rose Cottingham
is to be continued in the near future.” So far as the
present volume takes us, we get Rose through infancy and
schooldays—more than two hundred pages about them—
to the period of her first proposal and the publication of
her first book. It is all rather well done, with observation
and the kind of truth that one cannot help feeling springs
from personal experience. Especially is this the case
with the picture of Minerva House and its dominating
mistress, the “awe-inspiring little woman” whose “efforts
had revolutionized the whole system of education for girls.”
There seems a recognizable portrait here. Good too is the
of this blameless fact prey on his damask cheek because
he “shrank from the stigma of rejection through being
medically unfit"; and then was furious with all the other
characters for the excusable suspicion that he was shirking.
Frankly, I find myself as little able to admire as to believe
in him. Naturally, however, the laws of fiction require
that he shall eventually perform prodigies of valour.
Indeed the Red Cross Hospital is founded to his memory,
after he has been supposed to have perished in rescuing
people from a shipwreck. As a matter of fact he hadn't
perished at all; but that is another story. My second
charge of incredibility against Mr. MooRE is based on
the fact that he makes an educated woman of to-day

HOW TO REVIEW WAR POETRY.
(With acknowledgments to “‘The Times' Literary
Supplement.”)
THERE are abundant reasons, obvious enough to the
critical faculty, why very little of the verse occasioned by
the War is likely to survive. In the first place, poetry for
its production demands a state of mind removed from all
immediate pressure and excitement. This accounts for the
failure of TYRTEUs, of all the poets of the great Elizabethan
age of adventure, of Rouge.T DE LISLE, who wrote the Mar-
seillaise. Just now it is almost impossible to enjoy that
perfect calm, that indifference to one's environment, which
is the very breath of all great poetry. The noblest of all
lines ever written about Victory—the concluding lines of
MILTON's Samson Agonistes—were composed some time
after the tragic death of the veteran anti-Philistine.
It is the same with the passion of Love, which bears a
close resemblance to War, all things being fair in each.
Poetry, as WoRDsworth said, is emotion remembered in
tranquillity. If the expression of the sentiments uttered
under stress of immediate emotion in MICHAEL DRAYTON's
passionate sonnet—
“Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part—”
had been postponed to a period of subsequent tran-
quillity, he would have made a much better job of it. And
so, when Peace returns, as we hope it may some day, we
shall look for a revival of pure song. The Palace of the
Hague should be a veritable aviary.
Another source of weakness in our War poetry lies in the
fact that the poet does not speak from his own heart (“By
thine own tears thy song must tears beget”), but as the
accredited mouthpiece of the nation. The War may or
may not have touched him personally—we will generously
admit that we have known cases, even among poets, of
personal grief and personal patriotism induced by the
War—but as a general rule the writer has been weighed
down by a sense of responsibility to the State, of the claim
made upon him to speak for England. WoRDsworth was
suffering from the same unfortunate obsession when he
wrote—
“Milton thou shouldst be living at this hour;
England hath need of thee!”
Jºgotism, which is the essence of true poetry, should never be
merged in the choric “we,” sacred to editors and crowned
heads. What poet ever wrote in the first person plural 2
One has not forgotten MATTHEw ARNOLD's lines:–
“We, in some unknown Power's employ,
Move on a rigorous line;
Can neither, when we will, enjoy,
- Nor, when we will, resign";
but one cannot recall any other authoritative case of this
assumption of plurality by a recognised English poet.
Again, how can a poet write about things he has not
seen, even if by an effort of will he persuades himself that
he has felt them 2 Sincerity is only possible when it is
the outcome of experience. It is no good for a thing just
to happen; it must happen to the poet himself. When
WALT WHITMAN wrote that most moving of all War
poems, his dirge for two veterans— -
“O strong dead-march, you please me.
O moon immense, with your silvery face, you soothe me"—
he must with his own ears have heard the actual music;
he must with his own eyes have seen the moon in question.
But how many of our War poems have been written at
the Front? If SHAKSPEARE had been in a position to assist
at the Battle of Agincourt, he might have written more
worthily of St. Crispin's Day. As it was he had to fall
back upon his imagination, that last resort of insincerity.
It should further be remarked that the fact that every-
body is thinking the same thing at the same time constitutes
a fatal difficulty for our War-Laureates. If an obscure
friend of the poet dies peacefully of a zymotic disease, the
theme may well furnish him with a genuine inspiration;
but if a distinguished General falls gloriously on the field
of honour, or some national hero is borne to his last resting-
place in St. Paul's or the Abbey, any memorial tribute that
the poet may write is bound to be insincere because it
gives form to a sense of loss that is universal. That, of
course, was the trouble with TENNYsoN’s “Ode on the
Death of Wellington.”
Finally, we would say to our poets: Do not yield to the
very natural temptation to give expression to those emotions
of the common heart that cry for articulate utterance.
Just write from yourselves and to yourselves. Distinguish
between singing because you must, and going out of your
way to find something to sing about. Do not go out of
your way just because the War is there. Do not change
in a world of change. Keep on steadfastly in the old way,
like the Racing News in another column. For so, how-
ever long we others may have to wait for Peace, you will
know even now the true peace that can only be found in
artistic detachment. O. S.

your mouths and sing,

EveRYTHING would have passed off
admirably but for his lack of savoir
faire. Some excuse, perhaps, ought
to be made for him. It is not every-
body who is capable of rising to a
great occasion or one that, furnishes
a severe test of good-breeding. Still
he has nothing of the parvenu in his
character, and indeed his pedigree is
long and flawless, so that it was the
more surprising that he should fail at
the pinch.
He must have known from the first
that there was something unusual in
the air. The laughter at the breakfast-
table may have put him on the alert,
signifying that the strain of the last
few dreary months was relaxed. He
had been irritatingly restless the whole
morning, following one or the other of
us about, upstairs and down, in and
out of the garden, as if he felt afraid
of being left out in the cold. When
anybody opened the front-door an hour
too soon and went down the steps to
look along the road, Nigger was always
beforehand, wagging his tail and gazing
up with an alert, perplexed, pathetic
expression of inquiry; and when the
critical moment actually at last drew
near and we were all collected in the
hall he tried obtrusively to force his
way between us to the front. When
we heard a hooter at the corner and
the taxicab came into view with his
master's face at the window, he ran to
meet it, barking recklessly by the side
of the wheels till it stopped; but then
his voice died suddenly away. He
was obviously uneasy in his mind,
although for the next few minutes,
until we were all assembled in the
dining-room, it was impossible for him
to get a look in. When his turn at
last came and he was put to the proof
he dismally failed to rise to the occasion.
As for the rest of us, we tried to take
it as a matter of course and should
have succeeded if it had not been for
Nigger's complete want of tact. We
shouted and laughed and shook the
old fellow's left hand as if he had never
had another to shake; we pushed the
easy-chair towards him and kept on
saying how delighted we were to have
him home again without a word of
mitigation, asking innumerable ques-
tions without waiting for answers, for
really the only thing that mattered at
the moment was before our eyes, and
although it was different as far as
appearances went from what it used
to be—well, there it was nevertheless.
That was where Nigger proved such
a miserable disappointment. He alone
seemed unable to accept the situation.
We talked more persistently than ever
as he rested his fore-paws on the arm
of the chair, sniffing suspiciously;
then in the most tactless manner he
gave vent to a prodigious sigh as
he laid the side of his black head on
the empty sleeve.
TO A PATROLLING BALLOON.
O MIGHTY globel O gas-filled shape!

just joined the home circle, and the
doctor, after much anxious thought,
had decided to keep the small baby
and get rid of the large dog. There-
upon we offered a refined home, full
board, freedom of the hearth-rug, and
occasional use of rat in tool-shed, with
the result that, a few
weeks ago, Rip came to
us with a completely new

pincushion which she had fastened
saddlewise to his back.

and a paw was timidly lifted for me
to grasp. I took it. We made a

the stern yet kindly-looking man. The

[NoveMBER 3, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BATTLE OF THE ELBE.
[“A Lloyd's telegram states that the British
steamers Auk, Iris, and City of Berlin, which
were detained at Hamburg at the outbreak of
the war, have been sunk by the enemy.'']
“I’ve maintained now for some
time,” said Jack to Cheeks, the Marine,
“that the German Navy is threatened
with a certain liveliness.”
“I'm fair sick of your rumours,”
said Cheeks.
“This ain't a rumour, Cheeks. We've
got reality at last. There's been a big
engagement.”
“Suppressed by the Censor, I sup-
pose,” sneered Cheeks.
“Not at all. The bare details have
been published. Now I'm going to
give you the story in full.
“You know what a lot of changes
there's been lately in the High Canal
Staff. Well, Cheeks, those changes
ain't been in vain. The new blood has
done what the old blood simply never
thought of. But, to give credit where
credit is due, a thing most marines
don't understand, it was Herr BALLIN
who had the big idea first.
“He was chattin' one day with voN
WIEGAND, the well-known journalist,
otherwise famous as a nootral, and voN
WIEGAND starts tellin' Herr BALLIN
what a great man he is. They were
sittin' on the banks of the Elbe, sighing
for a capful of wind, like all good
sailors, and thinkin' of names for the
units of Germany's new merchant fleet.”
“You ain't 'alf got a comic imagina-
tion,” said Cheeks.
“P'raps so, but I've been proved
right often. Well, voN WIEGAND was a
bit sad. He'd just come off the Moltke,
which recently had a nasty attack of
torpeditis in the jaws, and hummin' in
his head was the German sailor's con-
stant refrain, ‘When will the British
Fleet come out 2'. He points out to
Herr BALLIN that the despondency in
the German Fleet is something awful.
What with worrying over the enemy
when he don't come out, and what with
chafing with anxiety over him when he
does, the German sailor, Cheeks, is a
mere shadow.
“Just at that moment Herr BALLIN
sits up. He's all a-shiver with excite-
ment. “What's that I see before me?’
he asks in a husky voice, like Petty
Officer Lloyd's when we done Hamlet
last Christmas. Von WIEGAND couldn't
see nothing, and he feels for his beer
ticket. But, Herr BALLIN don't give
in. “I’m right,' he says, “I’m not
dreamin'. It's the British Fleet !'
“When they found the hole which
voN WIEGAND had chosen for his
reverie, Herr BALLIN had got it schemed
all out ; and it's him, Cheeks, that
gets the prize this month for a comic
imagination.
“You see, lyin' in the Elbe off Ham-
burg was three British steamers, what
had the bad luck to be in dock there
when the War broke out. There was
the Auk, the Iris and the City of Berlin.
For the last one I have some sympathy,
Cheeks. She was handicapped at her
christening. Well, it was a matter of
a few days only, Cheeks, fixin' up those
poor steamers with canvas and wooden
guns and givin' them the look of the
most ferocious British cruisers. They
painted new names on 'em too, callin'
them the Lion, the Tiger and the-and
the Ring-tailed Ranunculus. Anythin'
more desp'rate than those ships had
never been seen near Hamburg, not
since HAGENBECK set up his institution
for the great Herbivores. All right,
Cheeks. You can read the book if you
like. Perkins pinched it out of the
Warrant Officers' mess.
“At last the great day arrived. The
German Fleet was brought round the
corner, and many scenes of light-
hearted joy was witnessed. Some said
“At last !' and them that didn't said
‘Der Tag,' and a few butted in with
‘Deutschland Ueber Alles ' ' Stokers
shook hands with each other and a few
popular fellers were even thrown in the
furnaces.
“Well, Cheeks, the action started at
9.47. A.M., the first gun being fired by
the Limburg, in case you didn't know
there was a ship with a name like that.
The KAISER and von WIEGAND was
on board, the former gentleman grittin'
his teeth and the latter makin' notes
besides grittin' his teeth.
“The German Admiral—maybe voN
BEHNCKE, but I ain't seen the Gazette
lately—begs the KAISER to go below,
but he says simply, ‘My place is beside
my brave sailors." Von WIEGAND was
quite as brave. When they impressed
upon him the danger he just smiled
contemptuously.
“Well, after half an hour the first
hit was made. Who done it nobody
knows. Perhaps it was the Pommern,
so called because old TIRPITz ain't
above havin' a mark or two on “Solly
Joel's Selected,' war or no war. Some
holds that it was the Moltke, but you
couldn't say because they was all dash-
in’ about so much and firin' on the
cigar or cocoanut system.
“Well, Cheeks, the fight was awful,
and the German darin’ what the papers
call a by-word. Old sailors said there
had been nuthin' like it since the bom-
bardment of Scarborough. The noise
of the guns was frightful and the smell
of the firin' was just like gunpowder.
“At 12.29 P.M. the Auk went down,
and the KAISER sent up a signal to the
masthead, ‘What price Britannia rules
the waves?’”
“Stow it,” growled Cheeks.
“Then, Cheeks, you disbelievin'
Thomas, the cheerin' broke out just as
it did at Trafalgar and La Hogue and
other German naval victories. But
suddenly the KAISER became grave.
There was stern work yet ahead. “Let
the guns speak,’ he said, and voN
WIEGAND put it down.
“Well, the City of Berlin went next,
torpedoed by a submarine what crept
recklessly in under her port quarter.
The Iris stuck out to the last, and
some of the German Fleet piped off for
lunch simply because they were sick of
the sight of her. Somehow she
wouldn't sink, although she lay bottom
upwards with the German Fleet all
round her. And if it hadn't been for
the happy thought of an Admiral, who
had her pushed down with a boathook,
I believe she'd be a danger to naviga-
tion now, Cheeks.
“That's the whole of the story. Yes,

lucky to have nothing worse to grouse
about than WINSTON CHURCHILL.”

AT THE FRONT.
A MILITARY humourist remarked the
other day that trench warfare was
becoming a constant drain. Last winter
the privilege of being able to write home
and say you were up to your knees in
water was so highly esteemed that no
one ever suggested such a sacrilege as
the draining of a trench. This winter
we are reformed characters. What
remains of the trenches is as dry as
the routine order prescribing for them,
and on this theme there is nothing
to write home about. The British
Army has made four drains to every
trench, so we have every prospect of
a rainless winter-
• Talking about constant drains we are
so reduced that I have had to take over
a company, just for a few days, until
they can get an officer. Nevertheless,
except that I have stopped speaking to
platoon commanders, I don't put on
a bit of side about it.
On the other hand you must not
imagine that I regard my duties lightly.
Only yesterday I built a new mess
kitchen. It is completely self-contained,
and when it grows up and we borrow
the electric range from the Hun oppo-
site it ought to turn out anything up
to an eight-course dinner in less time
than it takes to persuade the enemy to
retaliate.
We are also making a new recess to
match the kitchen, a palace with all
the requirements of a coal-cellar except
the coal. Our half-hoop roofings are
creating quite a furore round about.
These derniers cris of this season's
fancy ironwork were discovered loiter-
ing suspiciously among the ruins of a
barn. For months every officer looked
at them appreciatively as he passed,
and observed to his friends, “Fine stuff
for roofing a dug-out! We must use
them as soon as we have a battalion to
spare for carrying them.” I ended
their hopes by discovering that a com-
pany could carry one at a time comfort-
ably. Now I write under the shadow
of their spreading eaves, and our only
trouble is that one of those Generals
who keep popping in may want to
know why we've been wasting time
that might have been spent on draining.
Two evasions present themselves.
In the first place there is always a
good chance of passing the mess off as
a drain. Alternatively I may remark
lightly, “My dear General, that old bun-
galow of ours was positively unfit to
receive company in-much less to com-
mand one. When I became liable to
the honour of your visits, I felt it my first
duty to run up a salon worthier of your
rank.” By the time I have finished this
pretty speech the General will be at the
end of my line. On the word “rank”
I shall salute smartly and fall out.
There are still some Germans some-
where round ; they are of the Prussic
sort and very acid. They seem to be
experts in mixed frightfulness, which
they get off their chests in short rushes
as it were. Thus from 10 to 10.30 A.M.
comes a shower of rifle grenades; from
2.30 to 3 P.M., an assortment of shells;
while we have two brisk half-hours of
rifle and machine guns after dusk. In
the small hours of the morning the air
is full of the noises of bombous pro-
jectiles. I rush up as slowly as I
decently can to the sap-head to inquire
who is hit, and am informed by a very
unconcerned and obviously contemptu-
ous listening-postman that the near-
est bomb fell fifty yards short. As the
hours of the morning grow larger we
return to a shell and mortar diet; and
so it goes.
There was once a very old-established
company commander in our sector who,
having had to furnish the brigade with
reports on drainage, coke issue, sniper-
scopes, a wire-cutting patent, the health
of his command, and a new anti-frost-
bite slush, and being further asked, on
the same day, to “report on enemy's
attitude,” sent in the following illu-
minating wire :-"Enemy's attitude
hostile.” Anon came a brigade reply:—
“Please amplify your report on enemy's
attitude.” Whereupon the company
commander amplified:—“Enemy's atti-
tude distinctly hostile.” This corre-
spondence was then closed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Tuesday, October 26th.
—LANsdown E realises with increasing
conviction that the life of a Leader of a
Coalition Ministry, like that of the
policeman, is not a happy one. Repre-
senting Party Government at least
you know where you are. The Par-
liamentary host is ranged in two
camps. You and your men fire into
the fellows opposite, and they fire into
you. There is a simplicity about this
arrangement that lends it attraction.
Lamentable difference for Leader in
either House when Coalition Govern-
ment directs National affairs. Such
a body has natural unattractiveness
of the Hermaphrodite. It excites no
healthy encouraging enthusiasm. On
all sides it makes enemies, overt or
covert. Old friends and former col-
leagues remain seated on Opposition
benches watching Ministerial manoeu-
vres superciliously if not maliciously.
This lack of support from old chums is
not compensated for by loyalty on the
part of new companions. A life-long
Conservative seated on Ministerial
bench in either House is chilled by
consciousness that he is suspect in the
eyes of the party to which he has
attached himself.
This afternoon LANSDown E, with his
back to the wall, his practised rapier
showing no lack of skill or strength in
the handling, found himself and the
Government of which he is a distin-
guished Member assailed from all sides.
LoREBURN, in most pragmatic mocd,
began it. Neither House nor country
has recently heard anything of the
ultra-Radical who, making his way to
the Woolsack, in brief time so far
commended himself to Noble Lords,
lay and clerical, as to dispute in their
estimation the personal supremacy of
that stern unbending Tory, Lord
HALSBURY.
During occasional visits to House
he sits in silence, brooding over in-
efficiency of a Government deprived
of his collaboration. With grudging
assurance that he did not desire to
hamper the Government or to damage
the State by putting questions which,
even if not answered in detail, would
gratify the enemy, he submitted a series
suggesting that expedition to Salonica
had been rushed without the approval
of the Government's highest naval and
military advisers, and that full provision
had not been made for its communica-
tions and supplies.
In guarded reply LANsdown E pointed
out that KITCHENER, called to office of
SECRETARY of STATE for WAR by
public acclaim, is present at every
meeting of the Cabinet, and is a party
to all its decisions.
“It would,” he added, “be almost
grotesque to suppose that he allows
himself to be deflected from his course
by pressure of civilian colleagues.”
In the other House this common-
sense refutation of irresponsible gossip
“His BAck To THE wall.”
LORD LANSDown E.
would have been approved by hearty
cheer. The Lords are not in cheerful
mood just now. The majority to whom
a couple of years ago LANSDownB was
a revered, almost idolised, leader heard
him throughout in chilling silence.
Business done—Commons made fur-
ther progress in Committee on Budget.
“OTHERWISE ENGAGED.''
MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL.
House of Commons, Wednesday,
Burning desire for presence of WAN-
DERING WINSTON suddenly developed.
Question 25 on paper, addressed to him
by MoLTENo, inquired what he referred
to in his communication to the Navy
League, when he stated that “through
our long delays the enemy had seized
a new initiative in the Near East.”
How were those delays brought about 2
MoDTENO anxious to know, and who
was responsible for them 2
When Questions began WINstox was
seated on Treasury Bench chatting with
LLOYD GEORGE. When Number 25 on
the list was reached, lo! he was not.
MoLTENo appealed to SPEAKER to
know whether there were any means
of getting an answer.
“Certainly,” said the SPEAKER; “the
answer will be circulated with the
Votes.”
Doubtless. But that is not what
MoLTENo wanted, or what would please
the Pragmatical PRINGLE and the
Hustling Hogg E, who hurried to his
assistance. They desired to see
WINSTON in person, hear his explana-
|tion of what was certainly a curious
remark from a Cabinet Minister, and
put a few Supplementary Questions.
There was the Sergeant-at-Arms in his
chair; why was not he despatched to
bring in the errant Minister, handcuffed
if necessary?
SPEAKER, calling on next Question,
made this little pleasantry impossible.
Meanwhile WINSTON was otherwise,
perhaps more usefully, engaged. Had
brought down with him easel and
palette. Seated at favourable point
of view on Terrace was placidly en-
gaged in sketching Westminster Bridge
in full tide of traffic. Relieved from
strenuous work at Admiralty he has
given himself up with characteristic
thoroughness and impetuosity to pur-
suit of Art. Hopes MoLTENo and his
other friends below Gangway will like
his “View of Westminster Bridge from
the Terrace of the House of Com-
mons” when next May they see it
hanging on the line at the Royal
Academy.
Business dºwne.—Sitting devoted to
progress in Budget Bill.
Thursday.—Another word ruled out
from Parliamentary usage. It is “stam-
pede.” OUTHwaite inadvertently eli-
cited judgment from the Chair. Amid
random talk about raids by Zeppe-
lins, he, addressing HoME SECRETARY,
casually inquired, “Is the Right Hon.
Gentleman aware that last night there
was a stampede by Hon. Members
from this Chamber because they heard
of a Zeppelin raid 2"
SPEARER sternly objected to the use
of the word “stampede.”

Members accused of fleeing in affright
when they heard a Zeppelin was
coming. He now “desired to make
most absolute apology fºr having con-
veyed impression that Members left
on account of fear.” What he meant
to say was that they ran off to protect
their wives and children.
“I myself,” he added, “left on
account of a gas-bag which was not a
Zeppelin.”
This another unfortunate remark.
Members seated near him below Gang-
way looked inquiringly at each other
and angrily at him. Certainly was a
case that might have been put differ-
ently. There are no gas-bags below

AT THE PLAY.
“MAvou RNEEN.”
WHEN a nation is busy fighting for
its existence it is well that it should
traditions. And here the maker of
national pageants comes in. It is his
part, with the assistance of the cos-
tumier, the wig-maker, and sometimes
even the actor, to add flame to the
country's ardour. This thought, no
doubt, is active in the brain of Mr.
Louis N. PARKER, and it would there-
fore seem that it must have been
through mere inadvertence or
elsea temporary aberration that
he allowed his choice this time
to fall upon the corrupt and
frivolous Court of CHARLEs II.
To suggest that the chance of
bringing together the Merry
Monarch and the Merry Widow
(in the person of Miss LILY
ELSIE) diverted him from the
right path would be to cast too
cynical a reflection upon his
patriotism. And certainly it
could not have been the male
costumes of the period that
attracted him, for nothing
could well be uglier or more
ridiculous.
The comedy of Mavourneen
is a very simple thing. Apart
from the usual allowance of
pageantry it concerns itself
almost solely with the fortunes
of Patricia O'Brien. To escape
marriage with a detestableman,
assigned to her by a detest-
able father (neither of these
villains appeared, so we had
to take them on trust), she
journeys to London in boy's
attire, with the idea of putting
her case before the King, the
most natural person in the
world to consult on a domestic matter!
of this kind. Here, her mission at once
forgotten amid the novel diversions of
the Court, she finds favour with the
poor dusky Queen (very homesick for
Braganza), and then attracts the roving
eye of the Monarch. Her innocence,
however, defeats him, and in a spasm
of generous virtue he resigns her to
the arms of the only honest man
in his entourage. Plot there is none,
unless we are to count the customary
misunderstanding between the lovers.
It arose from an exhibition of the lady's
legs before the assembled Court in
Whitehall Palace. There had been a
question of rivalry in the matter of
stockings and the shapeliness that they
covered; and Patricia, who was in the
habit of wading through her native bogs;
with lifted skirts, failed to see how her

innocence could be damaged by this
simple demonstration. Why, indeed,
it should have come as a shock to so
hardened a Court I could not conjec-
ture; she had danced before us at Castle
O'Brien, in the First Act, with both her
stockings off and we hadn't blenched.
Miss LILY ELSIE—a very popular
resurrection—was always a delight to
the eye, and, boy or girl, she played
with a fine assurance. Happily for us
she was there most of the time; for in
her absence there was little enough to
entertain us, though Mr. HARKER's
scenery afforded a pleasant distraction.

“Oh, no,” I said, “not much. It just does it.”
“And that,” she said, “is how diaries are made, is it?”

Amelia, I am haunted by the thought
That this distressing news refers to you :
That, tiring of the commonplace, you sought
For something new,
And rushed off in a mad impulsive mood
To do this foolish thing—to be tattooed.
A fashion that would shock the common throng
Is just the thing in which you would delight;
I hope with all my heart that I am wrong,
But, if I'm right,
Your folly will effectively prevent
My showing off my one accomplishment.
For out here, in the midst of War's alarms,
We sometimes have a sing-song, and, you see,
I always sing, “I know of two white arms
Waiting for me; "
But if those arms with pictures are bedecked
I sing no more. My repertoire is wrecked.
Note added by Officer censoring letters.
Dear Madam, this intrusion may seem rude,
But I, alas, have suffered with the rest.
If up to now you haven't been tattooed,
Might I suggest
You go and get it done without delay.
Send us the bill. We'll very gladly pay,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN these days a fairy fantasy by Mr. F. ANSTEY comes
like a breath from the old happiness. How many years-is
it that he has been compelling our laughter with that
delightful jumble of magic and modernity of which he
owns the secret? And here the latest story, In Brief
Authority (SMITH, ELDER), shows what I may call the
ANSTEY formula as potent as ever. Take a stodgy family,
types of latter-day Suburbia; add a fascinating governess
(Mr. ANSTEY, if he will allow me to say so, seems some-
thing of a specialist in nice governesses—this one is own
cousin to her who married The Man from Blankley's),
and translate them all to fairyland as rightful heirs to
the throne of that kingdom. There is your scheme. But
only the author, in his own grave-faced way, can tell
you the countless solemn absurdities of its working out.
Myself, of all the Wibberley-Stimpson family I got most
fun out of the daughter, who had been taken unwill-
ingly from a course of lectures on literature, and was
frankly bored with the pomp and circumstance of a fairy
court. A boredom entirely reciprocated by her attend-
ants; till they cheer up on hearing from the royal note-
book that it was “after he had come under the spell
of Petrarch and Boccaccio that Chaucer produced his
wondrous Tales.” Though even then, says Mr. Anstey, “it
appeared their interest was due to a misapprehension.”
But I will not try to describe the trials of this ill-suited
family, nor their endeavours to propitiate their subjects by
knitting woollen vests for the gnomes, or floating a company
for the sale of tables replenishable by magic. Nor again—
since I have told you about the governess—need I say
who eventually turns out be the rightful claimant. It is
all excellent fooling, with, in one place, Just a suspicion of
allegory thrown in as ballast. And what a theme for a
Christmas Play!
I am inclined deliberately to call Miss MARJoRIE BowFN
the first of our costume novelists. I know of no one who
can so fill a book with the atmosphere of the past, or
whose characters wear their fine feathers with so compel-
ling an air of custom. Her latest story, Because of These
Things (METHUEN), is the strongest, though not the most
pleasant, work she has yet given us. It is a tragedy of
clashing temperaments, with an old plot, told often before
by many writers, in many settings, from the author of
| Othello onward. The husband here is Francis Moutray of
Glenillish, a Calvinistic Scots lord, who, coming as a
fiercely disapproving visitor to the gay life of eighteenth-
century Bolögna, is surprised by an overmastering passion
and elopes with the young Giovanna, a lovely Papist,
daughter of a notorious patrician house. What follows is
what inevitably must have followed such a union. The
instrument of the catastrophe is the child, whom Giovanna
has secretly received into the Faith which love for her
husband had made her outwardly renounce. When
| Moutray learns of this he kills his wife, and virtually his
son also. Thenceforward the tale moves by darkening
paths to the end that was foreshadowed at its start. All

I LITTLE worry when I'm told
That my orthography is gauche:
I spell it “Bosch,” though scholars scold
And all the leading linguists hold
I ought to spell it “Boche."

And every learned prig his fad;
By any name beneath the sun
It 's my opinion that the Hun
Would smell about as bad.

Between the Belgians and the Dutch

Have found a name by which to know
The Teuton beast, the common foe—
They call the thing a “Mof.”

O. S.
REx of THE TRANSPORT.
IN the dark ages, when the battalion was still uncertain
of its fate and the men returned nightly to comfortable billets
and long evenings, he was doubtless the property of some
up-to-date brewer, who regarded him without enthusiasm
as an item on the asset side of his balance-sheet. Among
so many others it was not to be expected that he should
attract special notice, but one likes to think that even in
those days he bore himself proudly, as a king should.
Other horses may have been sullen or restless as their
mocds prompted, but he stood aloof, removed in thought
above the things of earth, serene and stoical like MARcus
AURELIUs of old. Perhaps he felt that his hour was soon
to strike, perhaps he was up-borne by faith, intuition, second
sight—call it what you will; or perhaps his own calm
strength alone sustained him. Certain it is that he came
to us without hesitation and without fear, but also without
rejoicings. It was as if he had but stepped into the place
prepared for him, which he knew was his by right.
From the very first his claim was never questioned.
For this he was partly indebted to the dignity of his
| bearing, and partly to the beauty and immensity of his vast
frame. “He strode our little world like a Colossus,” and
to us of the Transport Section, watching the smooth play
and ripple of his mighty muscles, he seemed indeed less
suited to perform the menial tasks allotted to him than to
delight the pure soul of the artist. But most of all I
think he owed his supremacy to his eye. Large, dark
and compelling, it seemed to combine the wisdom of
centuries with the naïve wonderment of a child. There
were times when one could read in it the pensiveness that
is born of knowledge, and times when it seemed to look
out on the world with an air of gentle surprise. Thus,
when, standing at ease during the loading of his G. S.
wagon, he heard the regimental band strike up within a
few yards of him, he merely turned on it a gaze of mild
inquiry. Yet in that gaze there was an unquestionable
timge of mute contempt for beings who could derive
pleasure from such useless and undignified pursuits.
Where we, however, thought to discern a mystic aloof-
ness from common interests and desires, his companions
saw only a firm concentration of purpose, a rapt intensity
of thought, which they dreaded but could not understand.
Because of this no horse would face his glance. It is
rumoured that at night-time, from his place of honour on
the right of the line, he quelled disturbance by a turn of
the head. It is certainly true that since his coming no
picket has had to face the fear of a stampede in those
dreaded small hours before the dawn, when the grass begins
to rustle mysteriously and long shadows creep about the
horses' feet. Equally is it true that no picket has ever
seen him sleep. Sometimes in the chill of early morning
he has been noticed slowly and solemnly alternating his
weight from one hind foot to the other, but for the most
part he stands four-square and motionless throughout the
night, keeping watch and guard over his subjects. Sleep
he doubtless must, even as every living thing, but it is a
concession to the flesh which he makes grudgingly and
in secret, as though ashamed of his own weakness and
afraid lest he should be found unworthy of his trust. Al-
ways he succeeds in retaining such a measure of his facul-
ties as will enable him to be found awake at each recurring
inspection of the line. i
When at last Reveille summons the world to another
day's work, he submits to having himself groomed without
protest but with evident boredom. The only evidence of
interest in the proceedings which he displays is when, his
rug having been loosened, he reaches round and drags it
carefully from his back. It is his one parlour-trick, his
sole expression of gratitude, his solitary tribute to the
superior intellect of Man. By it he admits his dependence
on the powers that guide his life. Failing it we might
have admired his strength and respected his serenity, but
we could never have loved him. Because of it we know
that his detachment is that of the philosopher and not of
the cynic, and that beneath his grave exterior there beats a
warm heart.
Some day, when the War is over, he will return to civil
life. His brief reign ended, he will take his place once more
among the obscure and civilian legions of the prosperous
brewer. Will he look back with regret on the days of
his kingship, or will the memory of them, like a bright
jewel, help to sustain him through the dark years that
must pass before he goes down-hill with his last load 2
Time alone can tell, but we who knew him in his greatness
and must desert him in his poverty wish him the best
wish we know: a painless dropping of the traces and, when
the time comes, a dreamless sleep.

INSIDE KNOWLEDGE.
[We have had the eartraordinary luck to
intercept, on its way to “The Daily
Telegraph,” the following despatch
from the Sphina of the Balkans.]
IT is right that the British Nation
should be apprised of the crucial fact
that the whole question of Italian
activity in the Balkans turns upon the
peremptory need of establishing in how
far belligerent action may prove to be
congruous with the resources at the
disposal of the Consulta and in how
far they may prove to be proportionately
adaptable to the realization of Allied
aspirations. This truth was revealed
in a telegram which I have just received
from a source that I am not at liberty
to divulge; but I have first-hand
knowledge to guide me, if any guidance
were desiderated. And the conclusion
tallies exactly with my forecast of last
May—unfortunately overlooked at the
time. On this point the Giolittist
Stampa, the Salandrist Giornale
d'Italia and the Briandist Figaro are
all in agreement; and satisfaction is
expressed that the Dillonist Daily
Telegraph approves their attitude.
Other extraneous considerations of
an influential character, which it would
be inopportune to analyse at present
(though I am not precluded from
expressing the opinion that they may
soon reach the highest attainable degree
of intensity), also press for recognition.
Their sufficiency may be chimerical
but it can with truth be predicated that
their influence must tell—though I am
unfortunately not free to enter into
details the knowledge of which would
dispel those appearances that lend
colour to the opposite belief.
The attitude of Roumania is still the
subject of much misapprehension in
Allied diplomatic circles—in spite of
my article of February 13th last. And
here let me say, in passing, that on
those days when nothing new from
my pen is received in London the
diplomatic atmosphere might well be
lightened by the reprinting of daily in-
stalments of my former contributions
during the past five years. This should
prove a safeguard against a dangerous
lapse into bewilderment on the part of
civilian opinion in the Allied countries.
For though much has happened since
these pronouncements were made there
has been nothing to vitiate their con-
clusions, or what I may call their
continuous applicability or adapta-
bility to future conditions which had
yet to be created and which differ
materially from those obtaining at
the moment when my opinions were
adumbrated.
Whether or no Roumania will display
any velleity with regard to joint action
with the Central Powers is known to
certain judges who have watched the
diplomatic contest at close quarters or
mentally reconstructed it, and whose
views are at my disposal. In any case
it would be a rash assumption that such
endeavours as I may have made on my
own part to influence the course of
history—in negotiations that may be
published elsewhere—have proved in-
fructuous.
I earnestly hope that the pregnant
facts here emphasised will be duly
weighed and reckoned with.
Meanwhile Athens is positively wee-
villed with Germans.
“Should your umbrella turn inside-out,
don't try that “old woman's trick' of pushing
it against the wall. Grasp it at the ferrule
end, with the right hand; then place it behind
the body on the left-hand side. Next, place
the left hand on the hip with the arm en-
circling the stick; then simultaneously pull
with the right hand and push with the left
arm. This sounds rather complicated but is
really very simple in practice.”

THE GAP.
I ALways try to be neighbourly, but
people who keep hens which are not
chained up are a nuisance.
There is a small paddock at the
bottom of my garden belonging to a
man named Petherton, and, owing to
the Statute of Mortmain or some other
silly old enactment, the hedge dividing
this field from my garden belongs to
Petherton. Of course it does not on
that account refuse to act for both of
us. It does its best to bound my garden.
But the other day I noticed a fair-
sized gap in this hedge. I have no
objection to such a gap as a gap, but
when it acts as an early door for poultry
to enter my garden from Petherton's
demesne, it is time to see about it.
I saw about it. I wrote to Petherton
before my boot batteries had time to
get into action.
I am writing merely to prepare you
in case a similar raid should be made
on your property, especially as the
predatory force was seen to be marching
in single file through a breach in your
own defences. How are your arti-
chokes 2 Yours sincerely,

This elicited the following from
Petherton :-

ANOTHER GREAT SCANDAL.
DANGERs of Moon: ACTION DEMANDED.
The Globe has ever been in the fore-
most rank of vigilant critics of affairs.
The Globe's motto, taken from the im-
mortal works of CHARLES DICKENs—
himself, in his attacks on the Circum-
locution Office and the methods of the
Court of Chancery, no mean forerunner
of “C. P.”—is, to quote Mr. Weller,
“Ain't nobody going to be wopped for
this here?” and The Globe intends to
be true to it, come what may.
In pursuance of our policy of watch-
fulness we are forced to-day to protest
with all the eloquence and fervour left
over from our great Reprisals Meeting
at Croydon against the appalling and
perilous folly on the part of the
Admiralty—or is it the Home Office?
“but certainly one or other of these
mutually elusive criminals—of allowing
the moon to be seen from the Eastern
Counties. Nothing could be more cal-
culated to upset our nerves than this
singularly obsolete although intrusive
planet. For by some curious chance
it rides over the City exactly like a
Zeppelin. Think of the feelings of a
citizen who, suddenly looking up, sees
above his head what at the first blush
is nothing but a highly illuminated air-
ship, obviously filled with bombs. How
can such a man go about his business
with a rightly balanced mind? How
can he carry out the delicate tasks
demanded of him and of all of us if
the War is to end in our favour? He
is deranged, unbalanced, and everyone
must suffer.
We wish to bring no Government
down, but we say with conviction that
if the moon is not eclipsed the Cabinet
will be, and justly too. For several
days every month the moon is not
visible. What the Globe demands to
know, and insists upon learning, is this:
If the moon can be hidden for part of
the time, why cannot it be hidden
for all the time 2 The matter is of
tremendous importance strategically,
because so clever are our enemies that
very shortly they will be sending to
England a Zeppelin so like the moon
that we shall make no effort to stop
it ; and then where will London be 2
We call upon Mr. BALFour to act im-
mediately; or, if it is not Mr. BALFour
then Sir John SIMON. -
The moon must be extinguished.
Surely the task presents no real diffi-
culties. Placed in the hands of Mr.
GRAHAME WHITE, who spoke so nobly
at Croydon, although no one outside
The Globe has been permitted to read
his remarks, the thing could be done.
The fleet of aircraft could be so dis-
posed that they formed a sufficient
screen between London and this dan-
gerous luminary. We shall return to
the subject again unless something is
done. Never will we rest until the
Admiralty—or the Home Office—has
done its duty. C. P.

DEAREST DAPHNE,--There's quite a
little vogue this autumn for our home-
made Spas and Wells, and this place
in particular is full of people one knows.
But you mustn't think we're here
merely for a holiday. No, my Daphne,
we're all, in a sense, “broke in the
War”—that's to say, we're suffering
from the effects of War-work of some
kind. Myself, I'm being treated for
munition wrists. Beryl and Babs have
shell-makers' crouch to such an extent
that Sir William Kiddem orders them
to lie flat on their backs for ever so
long each day. In the intervals of
our treatment, however, we're giving

We crowd the Pump Room, we stroll
up and down Quality Walk, and we
shop in Farthingale Street.
It was my idea to adopt the manners
and so on of the poor dears who en-
joyed themselves here ages ago, and I
lead a set who carry quizzing-glasses,
and say, “La, you now !” and “My
dear creature, I'm infinitely obleeged to
you,” and all those darling old fancy-
dress phrases; and we have ridottos at

begin as minuets, but they generally
end as something livelier). Popsy,

She had a little trouble with her chair-
men one day when they set her down
farther from the door than she wished.
“Marry, come up, varlets,” she said
(rather mixing up her centuries);
“Oddsboddikins, 'tis a plaguy wet day.”
And the men said they wouldn't have
such language used to them, that they
were respectable working men, and
they'd lay the matter before their
trades union, and I don't know what
would have happened if Norty hadn't
been just coming out of the Pump
I'oom. He settled it and pacified them.
Yes, Norty came here during his
short leave (you heard how he's dis-
tinguished himself as a flight-com-
mander, dropping something on some-
thing somewhere and being decorated
by our darling French allies). IIc

My dearest, do you care to hear a
storyette with just a little creep in it?
Ecoute, done. I drove out to Oldpark
one afternoon, and among the callers
was a certain Colonel who's in com-
mand of a certain camp not a thousand
miles away. He's a rather grim and
very, very military Colonel, enormously
keen on recruiting, and considered by
many people (himself included, I be-
lieve) to resemble a very Great Man
indeed. Well, Eleanor Oldpark was
chatting to some of us, and she
happened to say that, while some
people were staying there lately, they
all amused themselves one evening by
dressing up in some of the antique
velvets and brocades out of the historic
Oldpark wardrobe. The Colonel, who
was silently and busily drinking tea and
eating sandwiches, suddenly weighed
in with, “That must have been the
evening I trespassed Cn your grounds,
Lady Oldpark. I wanted to take a
short cut over to the depôt, and I passed
across your lawn, below the terrace,
and saw one of your masqueraders:
what's more, I spoke to him and tried
to scoop him in-you know I never
lose an opportunity of scooping 'em in.
Did he mention it by any chance?”
“No,” said Eleanor, and added,
“There were no shirkers in the party,
Colonel.” “ Glad to hear it,” he
answered. “But when I saw my fine
young gentleman, with a wigful of
great long curls and a little fancy hat
atop of it, and a long flapped waistcoat
and wide-skirted coat, and shoes and

I couldn't help saying, ‘Young fellow,
my lad, are you doing anything for
your country?’ and, as he didn't
answer, I said a word or two more.
Sorry if it was undeserved, but he
should have said so.”
Eleanor looked puzzled. “None of
them was dressed in the fashion you've
described. Indeed, we've nothing of
that exact period in the wardrobe.”
“But, my dear lady, one of them
must have been dressed so, for I saw
him,” persisted the Colonel; “he came
down the steps of the terrace to get
some cool air after dancing, I suppose
—a tall, well set-up young fellow; I
saw him quite plainly in the moonlight,
with his long curls, and his silks and
velvets and his shoe-buckles and all.
When he didn't answer my first ques-
tion, I told him this was no time
for dancing about dressed up in the
trumpery of the past; that he ought to
be in the dress of to-day—khaki. But
he made as if he didn't hear, and went
off across the lawn and vanished in the
shadow of the trees.” -
Eleanor Oldpark had turned quite
pale; she looked at us all, and said,
with a strange little laugh, “My dear
Colonel, you are indeed zealous in
scooping 'em in You've tried to re-
cruit our Family Ghost.”
A delicious creep went through every-
one but the Colonel, and Eleanor con-
tinued, “I’ve never seen him, but
others have. It's Gervase, second
Baron Oldpark, who lived in ANNE's
reign. He's seen on a certain autumn
evening, the anniversary of the duel in
which he fell. The story goes that,
instead of finding somebody's wife or
sister (whichever it may have been) at
the trysting-place, he found somebody's
husband or brother, and the fatal duel
followed.”
'The atmosphere got so eerie that I
tried to lighten it by saying, “How
consumedly interesting !” as we should
say at Beaunash Wells. “But, my
dear Colonel, I should have thought
you were the last person to see a
ghost!”
“According to Lady Oldpark, I am
the last person to see one,” retorted
the Colonel, taking another sandwich
(either he thought Eleanor cut in her
facts, or is absolutely ghost-proof).

you that Mr. Blank cannot be found.
Such are some of the miseries of
holding the line.
In default of a simple contrivance,
either for fixing the receiver to one's ear
or arranging the receiver on a rest at
an angle so that one could lean one's
ear against it and have free hands,
cannot something be done to relieve
the tedium of this bitter process 2

If, when the time comes for me to
die, I am still not ready to relinquish

a boon, I shall ask for the restitution
of all the time I have spent “holding

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, Novem-
ber 2nd.—In anticipation of speech of
PRIME MINISTER House thronged as it
is only on historic occasions. Seats
being appropriated by early comers,
Members overflowed the side galleries;
clustered at the Bar, remaining stand-
ing through full length of PREMIER's
longest recorded speech; a few old
stagers accommodating themselves on
steps of SPEAKER's Chair.
Notable among Peers in their gallery
was JACK FISHER. Had satisfaction
of hearing two tributes paid to him by
Head of Government. Rumour, current
at the time, that First Sea Lord had
“doubts and hesitations” about sending
Fleet to force Dardanelles without co-
operation of Army was
confirmed. Also it is to the
inventive genius of Lord
FISHER, operative in anti-
cipation of events in the
Mediterranean, that “the
Admiralty built specially
constructed vessels that
have done magnificent
work.”
PREMIER usually man-
ages to compress within
space of forty minutes his
most momentous speeches.
This aſternoon spoke for
two hours less ten minutes.
One of opening sentences
struck predominant note.
If, he said, any thought it
was his duty to appear in
guise either of a criminal
in the dock making best -
possible defence of doubtful past, or
even of white-sheeted penitent with
candle in either hand doing penance
and asking for absolution, they would
be disappointed.
Who such expectants were he made
clear in what he called a passing notice
of “a small coterie of professional
whimperers who keep us supplied and
keep our enemies supplied with a daily
diet of falsehood.”
This the sole reference made under
provocation — not unparalleled, since
PITT in analogous circumstances more
than a century ago suffered similar
assault, but discouraging for an over-
worked statesman.
For the rest, after plain statement of
situation in the Dardanelles, in course
of which he vindicated WINSTON from
charge confidently made that he was
personally responsible for plan of cam-
paign, he frankly acknowledged that
disappointment had attended diplo-
matic action of the Allies in relation to
the Balkans; undertook, amidst out-

rather than a sailor, or
he would never have said
“downstairs.”)
The Spectator, improving
the occasion with its usual
pointed skill, went on to
say with splendid emph-
asis, “Let the nation go
downstairs and put on its
boots ' " Now that, Sir,
was all right; we knew
where we were. But un-
fortunately in the next
number of the paper ap-
peared a letter from a
correspondent who gave
another version of the
story. The Captain of the
ship, it seems, informed
the DUKE that she was
likely to founder. And
what did the Man of Iron
reply?—“Then I need not take off my
boots.”
But my own recollection is—though
it is a long time since I heard the story
—that what the DUKE actually said,
on hearing that the ship was sinking,
was this: “In that case I must take
off my boots” (the better to swim).
Now, Sir, there can be no doubt that
the Nation is quite ready to follow the
lead of so happy a combination as the
Editor of The Spectator and the Duke
of WELLINGTON. But we must know

MY OLD MAN WON'T HAVE IT THAT THERE IS ONE.”
WAR'S SURPRISES.
My friend Adolphus when at school,
Though always a persistent trier,
And not exactly held a fool,
Was never reckoned as a “flier.”
Perhaps it was his ducal name,
Perhaps his undistinguished features,
That marked him out for satire's aim,
For schoolboys are exacting
creatures.
He wasn't bad behind the stumps,
And would have played in the eleven,
But an untimely bout of mumps
Debarred him from that schoolboy
heaven. -
He never shone at other sports;
He wasn't brilliant or uproarious;
And nearly always his reports
Summed up his work as “meri-
torious.”
And so, whatever he essayed,
In spite of conscientious striving
He never thoroughly allayed
An unguessed passion for “arriving.”
Too negligible to be feared,
Too inconspicuous to be courted,
His blameless way he safely steered
Until to Oxford he resorted.
Within his Alma Mater's gates
He neither stirred our praise or pity;
He took a Third in Mods and Greats
Then gravitated to the City.
He passed completely from my ken—
Excepting at an Old Boys' muster
In ante-bellum days—and then
Emerged in unfamiliar lustre.
His trench had been severely shelled,
Two shots bang in the midst had
landed, -
But when the wave of onset swelled
He bombed ten Bosches single-
handed.
He got his D.S.O. all right—
Some thought he'd earned a higher
guerdon–
But still it broke the spell and quite
Relieved him of a lifelong burden.
No longer could his fellows rate
His worth at little more than zero,
One golden hour “beyond his fate.”
Had raised him to a full-blown hero.
Therefore believe him not who says
The past must be the present's
1measure ;
The War-test works in wondrous ways
And brings to light undreamt-of
treasure.
School verdicts often turn out wrong,
And boys we thought were “small
potatoes”
We now admit were all along
Potential paladins or Catos.
Notice.
IN a recent article in Punch, entitled
“Tomlinson's Progress,” there was in-
troduced a character of the name of
Miss Withers, and there was mention
of a house called Rosedene. It appears
that an actual Miss Withers, in whose
neighbourhood there is a house called
Rosedene, is under the impression, that
she was referred to in the article. In
point of fact the character was purely
imaginary, and the author is neither
acquainted with this Miss Withers nor
with the neighbourhood in which she
resides. Mr. Punch absolutely repudi-
ates all responsibility for what was a
mere coincidence arising out of the use
of familiar names. At the same time
he regrets any annoyance that may
have been suffered by the lady.

Policeman (in best official manner). “Up THE STREET opposite, MADAM, AND FIRST TURNING ON THE LEFT.”
A GIFT SHELL.
I DIDN'T like the look of the thing
from the first. When Celia had removed
the two sandbags and the dirty straw
in which it had been packed, and it lay
revealed in all its frightfulness in the
biscuit tin, I said, “I wish he hadn't
sent it.”
Celia seemed to think me rather
ungrateful.
“He must have gone to awful trouble
to get it past the Censor,” she remarked,
shaking the box gently.
“Yes, I noticed the outside wrapper
had ‘soiled linen' on it Don't do
that! If you value our lives, the house
and all this side of the street for about a
hundred yards either way, don't bang
it about.”
“It must have been banged about in
the post,” she said very reasonably,
“and I want to see if there's a note in
with it.”
“Suppose,” I said, “all the rough
handling it has been subjected to has
raised it to—er, boiling point. The
works inside, you know—very sensitive,
I expect.”
Celia took a step back and sent
Barbara to play in the garden.
“I'm sure there's a letter under-
neath it,” she said.
“Very well, then,” I replied, and I
carried the box and its sinister contents
up into the spare bedroom.
We turned it out very carefully on
to the feather bed. Nothing alarming
happened, except that Celia dropped
the empty tin and frightened me rather
unnecessarily.
Then we looked for the note and
found nothing. -
It was just after Celia had raised the
pointed end that I heard the noise.
“Listen,” I shouted, pulling her
away. There was an unmistakable
clicking noise.
The next moment, while I was
rapidly considering what to do, Celia
dashed at the window, and for some
unaccountable reason flung it open,
and dragged me from the room by my
coat pocket.
When we had everybody safely in
the cellar I gave the gardener instruc-
tions through the grating. “The tulip
bed must be sacrificed,” I said firmly,
“and as much of the lawn as you think
necessary. It must be at least eight
feet deep.”
In half-an-hour
warned Brown next door. He seemed
rather anxious about his new summer-
house and asked if it would be possible
to turn the business end the other way.
I went out and
I explained there and then that it was
all business end, but sacrificed another
eighteen inches of the lawn in his
interests.
After lunch we brought it down.
The mattress was rather awkward at
the turn on the second landing, but we
managed all right until we reached the
bottom of the back staircase.
Then the gardener slipped, fell two
steps, let drop his corner, and the shell
rolled off. -
Cook, who I always said would dis-
tinguish herself some day, caught it.
We got it back on the mattress again
just before she fainted.
The evening post arrived as we were
all stamping down the tulip bed. Celia
read the letter, standing (the irony of
it) where the lawn had been.
“I bought the shell,” she read, “off
a French soldier. When you turn the
fuse cap (the brass knob on the point)
the clock face appears in the opening
at the side. I expect you've discovered
the way it works by now. Awfully

“One can never be too careful,” I
said.
Celia smiled. I suppose there must
have been something funny in Harry's
letter. He rather prides himself on
his humour.

THE WATCH DOGS.
XXVIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, I hope this finds
you, as it leaves me, in the pink at
present. My letter is to be about
Headquarters. Later I'll tell you what
I see and hear when I circulate.
Any man can picture officers sharp-
ening their swords on the soles of their
boots, leaping lightly over parapets
and dashing into frays; and, if he can't,
there are artists enough to do it for
him. But no illustrated Sixpenny Press
has ever done justice to the stirring
picture, in all its gruesome detail, of A
Staff at Work. I am not staff, mark you;
I am but a very poor relation of the great
Brass-hat family. For the moment,
however, I live among them and share
their hard lot, and, what's more, I am
prepared to stand or fall with them.
Yes, Charles, there are those who will
tell you that Headquarters in general
exist merely for the purpose of prolong-
ing the War. I felt that way myself
in my troglodytic past; but not now.
To the ladies the staff-officer is a tall
good-looking man who bestrides a horse
with a long tail and is never far away
from his Field-Marshal; to the reader
of feuilletons he is a man of steel
nerves and cast-iron expression who
pores over maps, as often as not in an
ill-lit tent, and deals hourly with
questions of life and death in large
round numbers; to the junior regi-
mental officer he is an unknown
quantity in a motor-car, always to be
saluted, whatever his rank, on the you.
never-know-and-its-best-to-be-on-the-
safe-side principle; to the senior regi-
mental officer he is an enviable nuisance.
This is all very well, but what are the
facts? What is an M.G.G.S. 2 What is
a B.G.R.A.” How does a D.D.V.S. get
to work 2 What are the habits and
peculiar characteristics of an A.M.S. 2
Distinguish carefully, extra marks
being given for neatness, between a
D.A.Q.M.G. and a D.A. and Q.M.G.
Which would you sooner be, and why
a D.D.S. and T., a D.A.D.T., or a
D.A.D.R.T. 2 What relation, by blood or
marriage, is a D.A.D.S. to a D.A.D.O.S. 2
If an A.D.A.P.S. meets a D.A.D.M.S.
which calls the other 'Sir' 2 An army
being greater than a corps, and a major
being senior to a captain, the candidate
for honours is asked to suppose a
difference of opinion between an Army
Staff Captain and a Corps Staff Major
and to spot the winner. Lastly, if a
Lieutenant-Colonel is removed from his
office of P.M. and returned to his regi-
ment (to command it), do you congratu-
late him warmly as upon an achievement
or do you hush the matter up as being
a first step on the downward path 2
Most men would answer these riddles,
if not in the words, at least after the
manner of the sentry whom you ask to
direct you to the G.S. Office (the gate
of which he guards, if he did but know
it). “I don't rightly know, Sir. I've
only been in these parts a few weeks.”
My servant, having wanted a new
tunic a very long time but having failed
for all his efforts to come by one, was
at last told by an old soldier, “There's
a knack about indenting, my lad, and if
you haven't got that you're never
likely to get anything else.” So I
believe, it requires a very high order of
brain and years of patient industry at
the Staff College to learn the system,
let alone how to work it. In fact,
when you've proved yourself brilliant
enough to know exactly what a Staff
Officer is, you become, ipso facto, a
Staff Officer yourself.
You wonder how I, whom you know
much too well to suspect of any intellect,
can keep my end up in such an atmo-
sphere of knowledge 2 It came about
like this. On September 25th last an
affair began which you may recall; it
was officially known as “Giving the
Ger-dog the cold stomach.” It was
an affair of some dimensions, but it was
no mere coincidence that it happened
all along the line at the same. moment.
It wasn't that all the Generals, French
and English, chanced to lose their
temper with the enemy simultaneously.
No, Charles, strictly between ourselves,
it had all been arranged beforehand.
But it was a dark, a very dark secret;
only those who had to know knew, and
there was more woe waiting for anyone
of them who let it out than there was
even for the Bosches. And the secret
was kept, and but for accident and
considerable tact I might to this day
be reckoned as one who knows nothing,
never knew anything, is never likely to
know anything.
It fell out about that time that I was
getting due for leave; that is to say, at
the end of August my Colonel asked
me to name the happy day. He
thought I'd be off at once; but for some
private reason which I myself have
never been quite able to fathom, I must
needs select September 25th of all dates.
What's more, I stuck to it for all his
efforts to put me off. He said I'd be
late for the partridges; he said I'd be
early for the pheasants. I replied that
I was going to spend my time in
London, and there was no close season
for Zeppelins as far as I knew. “Very
well, then,” he said hurriedly, “Sept-
ember the 5th be it.” “The twenty-fifth,
Sir,” said I. “Right,” he said, even
more hurriedly; “I’ll put you down
for the 25th of October.” “September,
Sir,” I said.
Even in the G.S. office of an Army
at midnight a crowd will gather round;
and about my Colonel, in his sore
dilemma, assembled a little group of
interested listeners. They became
aware of my existence, even of my
leave. When did I propose to take it?
“I had thought of September 25th,” I
explained; “but there seems to be
something . . .” My Colonel blushed
deeply, firmly closed the conversation,
and there ensued the stoniest silence
I ever remember to have been mixed
up in.
My duty takes me with messages to
most of the people who matter, and it
is their habit in the kindness of their
hearts to interest themselves, at the
conclusion of the interview, in my
private affairs. To all of them I men-
tioned my leave and September 25th.
I confess that after the first time or two
I did this on purpose. It was appar-
ently an excellent jest. It induced
them to smile mysteriously at me.
When people do that, I always, on
principle, smile mysteriously myself.
At the mention of that date they
would look anxiously at the door, to
see if it was shut, and then would ask
me in an offhand manner questions
which only the inmost inner circle
could be expected to answer. In matters
of opinion (“How long will the War
really last 2".) I would say my say: in
matters of fact I would say briefly I
didn't know. In both cases I got infinite
credit for extraordinary knowledge, but
more especially in the latter.
And so my reputation was created
in the highest quarters; it very soon
spread down. When September 25th
arrived and the supposed inwardness of
all my mysterious smiling with regard
to it became apparent to all, I was a
made man. Nowadays, when other
people are asked to say what they think,
I am asked to say what I know. At
present I am unpopular, but pleasantly
unpopular, for my meanness, exceeding
that of the Bulgarians even, in not
warning people what was about to take
place in the East.
Very well, Charles, disbelieve me if
you will. But, say, how do you ac-
count for my present official address,
which is (omitting, so to speak, the
number of the Street) Intelligence,
, B.E.F.
Yours ever, nevertheless,

sent their Mr. Jacobson down to inspect and appraise it.
I welcomed Mr. Jacobson in the hall and immediately
felt that paralysis of all the mental faculties which is apt
to overcome me in the presence of an expert.
“We will now,” I said, “go up-stairs and I will show
you the corpus delicti.”
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Jacobsch, “I thought I

“So you are, Mr. Jacobson,” I said, “ so you are.”

“Quite right, Mr. Jacobson,” I said. “It’s been in the

We had now reached the bedroom passage and in a
moment I had thrown open the door of the spare room and
had introduced Mr. Jacobson to his victim.
“There it is,” I said, “as large as life and twice as natural,

“Oh, I don't know,” said Mr. Jacobson. “I shouldn't

“No,” I said, “not exactly, but I’ve often heard about it."

Nobody wants to sleep in them and very few people want

“That,” I said, “is very depressing, Mr. Jacobson.

“Well, Sir,” said Mr. Jacobson,” you could break it up,

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN Eltham House (CASSELL) Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD returns
to her pleasant field of high politics in an expensive setting.
Alec Wing, heir of a fabulously wealthy and detached Whig
peer, runs away with Caroline, the beautiful wife of an
odious wooden baronet. He marries her in due course, and
after a decorous interval she comes back to be mistress of
the great Whig palace which old Lord Wing has generously
put at the disposal of the brilliant young couple. Outraged
society and the Nonconformist conscience determine that
Wing shall not get into the Government and that no
other women than an eccentric duchess, the ladies of the
Embassies, and exotic dancers shall appear at Eltham
House. Wing succeeds to the title and so cannot be kept
out of politics, but fails in his attempt to bribe and intrigue
himself into place. In his failure he deserts his adorable
Caroline, who, after trying to rival the Salon of the
Lady Holland of the beginning of the last century, dies
of something like a broken heart. Caroline is a charming
pathetic figure, dexterously suggested. Wing is a bump-
tious ass, with little trace of the high talents claimed
for him. It is a curious trick of fate which has set Mrs.
HUMPHRY WARD to boomerang-making. Not once, but
thrice in these last four years she has written books
which seem to bring damage by inference to the causes
and conditions she has at heart. I take it she approves
and thinks impressive the atmosphere of Eltham House,
gilt and marbled and pillared, lined with the family por-
traits of three centuries and stuffed with rare treasures
of art; with its glitter and bustle; its starred and be-
ribboned statesmen and ambassadors; its political chatter
and anxious wire-pulling, even though she deplores the
vagaries of its headstrong young master, Lord Wing. But
in fact she contrives to make it all a little empty, unmean-
ing and unseemly—a good deal too much cry for so little
wool. And I conceive that, run as a serial by one of our
wrecking journals, the whole novel might have a quite
considerable success, in addition to that more flattering
welcome which the loyalty and gratitude of readers and
the author's competent handling of her well-dressed
marionettes assures her. One shining merit is that she is
herself alertly interested—always an infectious quality.
There is little point in attempting comparisons between
the various war-books that have appeared during the past
year. Each has its individual excellence. If I were asked
to name the chief characteristic of War Pictures behind the
Lines (SMITH, ELDER) I think I should say cheerful com-
mon sense. Mr. IAN MALcol M, M.P., writes of the War on
the Western Front as it appeared to him during his very
energetic employment with the British Red Cross Society.
That he happened also to be a trained observer and the
owner of a literary style were, so to speak, fortunate
accidents. The book is, as its dedication to the writer's
constituents says, primarily a record of work done. The
things seen come by the way. Part, a noble and terrible
part, of this work was concerned with the identification of
the graves of those who had fallen in action. This task at

times led the party into dangerous places.
Their reward Mr. LASCELLEs’ Thirty-five Years in the New Forest (ARNoLD),
was the comfort they were able to bring back to ºº: his life had its compensations too. For, after spending
mourners at home, especially in their testimony to the love
and reverence with which these graves are tended by
French peasants and privates. There are many moving
instances of this. But the book is not wholly grave.
Mr. MALcolM has to the full the brave optimism of the
busy worker, the very quality that he notices approvingly
in others. The illustrations are a very attractive feature of
the volume; they range from reproductions of German
bread-tickets to pictures and drawings by French artists
bearing upon the War. Of these latter, one especially, a
crayon drawing by Ochs of two amateur critics, entitled,
“Si j'étais d la place de Joffre,” is a masterpiece of good-
humoured satire. -
An Irish story from Mrs. FRANCIs BLUNDELL (M. E.
FRANCIs) possesses the added charm of novelty. But Dark
Rosaleen (CASSELL) shows her as much at home in Conne- ||
mara as in Wessex or Lancashire. There is indeed an
unusual beauty in the set:
ting of this tale; and that gº
feeling which she always ſºft
shows for the place-spirit, ſº
by which the surroundings || ||
of her characters become -º
an actual influence in
their development, has
never served her to better
purpose. The mist-laden
hills, the wet winds and
surging seas of Western
Ireland have all been
brought into her pages,
so that the haunting, ex-
asperating appeal of them
is like that of the country
itself. This being said, I
have to confess that the
actual story seemed to me
unequal; there are scenes
in it that could hardly be
bettered, others that leave - --
one unsatisfied. Perhaps this is because its motive is re-
ligious; and religion, which cannot always make a good man,
generally makes a bad novel. Dark Rosaleen is the tale of a
mixed marriage, between Ultra-Protestant Hector McTavish,
and Catholic Norah Burke. Hector and Pat Burke, peasant
lads both, had been brought up almost as brothers, till the
former is taken away to the North by his Protestant father,
and the latter becomes a priest. Exquisitely sympathetic
and tender is Mrs. BLUNDELL's telling of the scene in which
Patsy's mother and dying father kneel to receive the first
blessing of their son. These chapters, indeed all the Con-
naught part of the book, are a delight to read; but later,
when Hector has married Norah and taken her with him to
Ulster, though the contrast is well suggested, I could not
but feel that the story had suffered from the change of air.
The end, which I do not mean to tell, is unexpectedly
grim, but the horror of it is redeemed by a fine touch of
imagination.
Mr. GERALD LAscELLEs, formerly Deputy-Surveyor of the
New Forest (under the Crown), may have had his worries,
as every deputy-surveyor (under the Crown) must have,
for tenants are always tenants and related in one particular
(so other landlords tell me) to the daughters of the horse-
leech, to Oliver Twist, and to the patrons of the present
Ambassadors' revue. But there is plenty of evidence, in

an hour or so in refusing to build a new bedroom or put in
a lighting plant (or even in complying with such monstrous
demands), he could mount his pony and shoot deer, or call
out his spaniels and shoot pheasants, or even loiter among
the flowers of his pleasant and historic official residence,
King's House, Lyndhurst. One thing is certain from popular
testimony, and that is that the New Forest was never in
more capable or more sympathetic hands than in his long
regency; and this book proves that the Forest never had a
better lover. As an author Mr. LAscELLEs is easy-going
and communicative, and his volume, as the record of the life
of an English country gentleman of sound sporting tastes,
and a right dislike of egg-collectors and the destroyers of
rare birds, takes its place among the more excellent out-
door literature.

- WAR NOTES.
THE report, published in the evening Press of last
Wednesday, that a meeting was being arranged between
the Kings of Bulgaria, Greece and Rumania, at Bukarest
still lacks official authority, though it has since been
confirmed by the Panama correspondent of an Amsterdam
paper, and by our own representative at Monte Carlo, the
latter adding the further interesting statement that this
conference of Balkan monarchs has been summoned by
Lord KITCHENER. . . - - -
The enthusiasm aroused by President WILSON's latest
Note to Great Britain has distracted the attention of the
American public from the case of Herr FAY and his accom-
plices. It is felt that, while any attempt on the part of
these gentlemen to blow up American ships at the insti-
gation of the German Foreign Office should be discouraged,
the matter is one of minor importance as compared with
the necessity of insisting that Great Britain should adopt
the German ideal of the freedom of the seas. .
In view of the familiar behaviour of its captain and crew,
the opinion is widely held that the submarine which sank
the Ancona was a German U-boat masquerading under the
Austrian flag, and the Italian Government is gravely
considering whether, now that Germany is at war with
Italy, the friendly relations between these two countries
can any longer be usefully maintained.
The advertisement given to The Daily Telegraph in the
buckmasterful speech from the Woolsack (subsequently
endorsed by Lord Robert CECIL) has given great satis-
faction to the staff of that journal, who now sing every

to have caused considerable umbrage in Carmelite House,

way to continue extending to the Government its whole-
hearted support. -

THE TELEPHONE AT THE FRONT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I have not yet received my second
pip. I know fellows who were gazetted days after me who
have two, while I remain, in spite of my peculiar qualiſi-
cations, a mere Second Lieutenant. Clarence, for instance,
has two, and he merely lets out mo-bikes. As for ex-
plaining how a telephone works to a red-hat, why, he
wouldn't know which end to speak into ; and I don't think
he ever bumps into the Staff at all. -
On the other hand, I suppose I know more about the
ways of Staff Officers than they do themselves. Of course,
that's my métier. You know the man at home who comes
to the back door with a little black bag and a two days'
beard, and says he's come to mend the telephone; and you
say, “Oh, very well, I suppose it's all right; let him come
in, but keep an eye on the spoons?” Well, that's me—
out here.
I am the man who brings the telephone to the Staff.
They all want it—the D.D.M.S., the A.P.M., the R.T.O. —
all of them, and I have to take it to them and show
them how it works. -
The other day I built a telephone line out to Divisional
Headquarters at On the terrace of the château was
a Staff Officer in full bloom—all gold and crimson in the
October sunshine. I saluted smartly.
“Good morning, Sir; I've brought you a telephone.”
“By Jove,” said the Staff Officer, “splendid. That's just
what we want—what? I say, you know, can we talky-
talky on it?” - - -

Going up to the instrument he worked the handle round

anthems rather than with comic songs.” It is not every-

said, “Your excellent exposition in telephony has been
invaluable to me. Good morning.” But there was that
in the tone of his voice that I did not understand, and as
I went out of the office I glanced up at the little wooden

ON BELLONA'S HEM.
CHIVALRY.
I was sitting by my friend, Private
Dash, on the top of the motor-bus.
Having enlisted at the beginning of the
War, on the impulse, he has had his
: full share; but though he has been at
the Front for some months and has
been in many engagements he is so far
unhurt. He was at home on short
leave and riding on the bus-top rather
for enjoyment and to see more of that
strange foreign city, London (it was a
fine day), than of necessity, for he is a
landowner in the Shires, and he will
have a good four-figure income to his
name, even after the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER has done his worst
with it. He has his own reasons, into
which I need not enter, for remaining a
private. For a man of his tempera-
ment they are sound enough.
Well, we had not much more than
established ourselves at Piccadilly
Circus, going West, when an old lady
on the seat in front of ours leaned back
and spoke to my friend. She was one
of those old ladies whose curves are
all very soft. She had pretty grey hair

which, from its kind intonation, is
usually called motherly. Turning half
round she asked my friend what regi-
ment he was in. He told her. And
had he been wounded ? No. But he had
been in the trenches? Oh, yes. And
he was going back? Directly almost.
And here the conductor came up with
“All fares, please.” We felt for our
money, but the old lady interposed.
“Young man,” she said to the Squire of

I should like to pay for you. It's little
enough one is able to do for our brave
soldiers.”
Poor Dash, he was embarrassed by
her praise and for a second staggered
by her action; but there was a fine
light in his face as he thanked her and
watched her extract his penny as well
as her own from the old-fashioned purse
in her reticule.
“There,” she said, as she handed the
two pennies to the conductor—“it
would be a shame to let you pay that
yourself.”
These are the awkward moments.
It was so comic and so beautiful; and
I was glad when my friend, although
we were far from our destination, stood
up to descend. - -

January 1st, 1916, Salonika. — A
political crisis has been precipitated by
the resignation of M. VENEzELos and
his Cabinet owing to a triumphant
vote of confidence.
Later.—M. MichelidARIs has
consented to form a Government.
It is believed that the crisis is
already over as the new Premier,
commanding a strong minority,
should have no difficulty—except a
numerical one — in meeting the
Chamber. M. VENEzELos has given
an undertaking that he will support
the new Cabinet for not less than
two weeks. M. MICHELIDARIs, who
is a convinced pro-Montenegrinist
with anti-Bessarabian sympathies,
has stated publicly that, in his
opinion, KING CoNSTANTINE is the
greatest living strategist. The
policy of the new Premier is de-
scribed as being one of Tender
and Affectionate Neutrality to-
wards the Entente Powers. There
is no truth in the rumour that
he contemplates conveying the
benevolence of his neutrality from
one side to the other. Athens is
calm.
January 15th.-The crisis which
followed the fall of the Govern-
ment is regarded as being ... at
an end. M. Coundouriotis, the
new Premier, is very popular in
Greece. His attitude is under-
stood to be one of Malevolent
Impartiality towards the Central
Powers, and the idea that he will
transfer his impartiality from one side
to the other is scouted by the well-
informed. Interviewed last night by
an Italian journalist he is reported to
have said that he regards KING CoN-
STANTINE as the finest of living Diplo-
matists.
Later.—The list of Ministers with
their portfolios is published, and reveals
the striking fact that it contains the
names of no fewer than four men who
have never during the past year held
the post of Premier. M. VENEzELos
has retired from public life.
February 3rd.—The defeat of the
Coundouriotis Cabinet by 97 votes and
its consequent resignation has caused
little surprise. Parliament will be
greatest living Naval Commander. The
|Government can count on the active
co-operation of M. VENEZELos (who is
lºning from Crete). Athens is

getting used to it. The Army has been
demobilized. |
February 19th-Owing to the politi-
cal crisis the Army has been prorogued.
The defeat of the RALLIGovernment by
168 votes was anticipated. M. VENE-
zELos in his great speech on the con-
stitutional situation explained that he
considered that he had given this lot a
very fair run. The KING has sent for M.
Theokitis. M. VENEzELos has gone
to Cyprus.
Later.—The new Premier's attitude
is officially stated to be one of Genial
Inability. Parliament is to be instantly
demobilized. M. THEORITIs has ordered
a new set of portfolios, the others
being worn out by constant handling.
In the meantime his colleagues will
join him as Ministers without port-
folio. “The position of Greece as a
strictly Continental Power,” he points
out in an open letter to his wife, “must
ever make her chary of operations on
the sea-board.”
March 9th-Following upon the re-
mobilization of the Chamber, which
was quietly effected during the ad-
journment of the Army, the THEokitis
Cabinet fell without a division this
afternoon. It just toppled over, while
M. VENEzELos (who has returned from
Cyprus) was out at lunch. Athens
remains unmoved.
Later.—The KING has sent for
M. VENEzELos.
Later still.—M. VENEzELos, in
an interview with an American
reporter, has categorically stated
that he considers KING CoNSTAN-
TINE the greatest Dodger in Eu-
rope.
Extremely late.—M. VENEzELos
has formed a Cabinet. He will
meet the Chamber this afternoon.
Latest of All.—The scene in
the Chamber to-night points to the
final abandonment of Parliamen-
tary government in Greece and
the establishment of a Dictator-
ship. M. VENEZELos, in an im-
passioned speech, has frankly
stated that he finds it impossible
to conduct the affairs of the nation,
encumbered as he is with a
majority in the House—a position
so hopelessly at variance with all
the best traditions of Greek govern-
ment. Athens is quite indifferent.
The attitude, which had been
already foreshadowed, of the Dicta-
/
torship is stated to be one of the
Strictest Pusillanimity.

THE old GIRL I'M BILLETED witH WANTED HER Boy To IIAve: A KHAKI ARMLET."
AFTER-GARE OF THE BLINDED SOLDIER,
Mr. Punch ventures to call the atten-
tion of his generous readers to the
moving appeal contained in this letter:
To the Editor of “Punch.”
DEAR SIR,-Men who have been
blinded in fighting for us, and who
have been trained at St. Dunstan's,
Regent's Park, in one of the many
forms of industry taught there, are now
starting again in life for themselves.
We who have been engaged in their
training feel very strongly that our re-
sponsibilities should not end with the
completion of this training. The blind
home-worker has little chance of be-
coming a useful self-supporting member
of the community if he is left to him-
self. The purchase of raw material, the
maintenance of a satisfactory standard
of excellence and the marketing of
articles made represent, collectively, a
task which is beyond his powers to
accomplish satisfactorily.
So it has been arranged with the
Council of the National Institute for
the Blind that they shall establish a
branch, the primary object of which
will be the after-care of these men.
Its headquarters will be in London, and
it will be under the management of
Mr. Thomas MARTIN, Superintendent of
the School for the Blind at Swiss Cottage.
But very considerable funds will be
|needed to carry out this plan in a
businesslike and satisfactory manner.
I feel sure that there are many among
your readers who will feel that, in spite
of the numerous calls to which they
have so generously responded of late,
this is another to which they will
readily respond. In doing so they will
be showing the measure of their appre-
ciation for the blinded soldiers who
have so bravely taken up the burden
which has been laid upon them and
have fitted themselves to fight the
battle of life as gallantly as they fought
the battle of their country.
Contributions sent to me at the
National Institute for the Blind, 226,
Great Portland Street, W., should be
made out to the After-care Branch of
the Institute. Yours faithfully,
C. ARTHUR PEARson,
Chairman Blinded Soldiers' - and
Sailors' Care Committee; President
National Institute for the Blind.
“BEWARE OF IMITATIONS.”
[Imitation eggs and butter and many
other food-disguises have made their
appearance in Germany.]
If your very patient nation
Does not raise an angry shout
At each nauseous imitation
Of the things it does without;
If it shows no wish to mutter
When you bid it do its best
To eat imitation butter
With an imitation zest;
If it feels no need to question
Whether Culture which ordained
Such a strain on its digestion
Is not similarly feigned;
If it really is contented -
At its various dinner-hours
With the masquerade presented—
That is no affair of ours.
But one thing we have a voice in :
Be your skill however great,
There is one thing we rejoice in
Knowing you can't imitate:
When the struggle is concluded
And the sounds of battle cease,
Europe shall not be deluded
With an imitation Peace.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Popular Actor. “I’ve MADE UP MY MIND TO Join THE ARMY.
RHYMES FOR ALL TIMES.
THE subjoined interesting letter,
though it was addressed to us, was
apparently intended for a contemporary
in whose columns the question of in-
genious rhymes has recently cropped
up. But we make no apology for
availing ourselves of the opportunity
of appropriating so luminous and in-
structive a contribution :-
DEAR SIR,--When I was an under-
graduate at Balliol, more years ago
than I care to remember, Jowett often
expressed his dissatisfaction with the
famous rhyme to Timbuctoo, which he
considered much overrated, and one
day, at a breakfast party, appealed to
me to improve upon it. My effort, a
genuine impromptu, ran as follows:–
“One day, while hunting near my villa
Upon the plains of Timbuctoo,
I shot a very stout gorilla,
I shot a very slim buck too.”
Jowett was delighted, and for days
afterwards was found repeating my
quatrain at the most incongruous times
and in the most unsuitable places—
even in chapel, so it was said. For a
fuller account of the incident I may

Stimulated by the correspondence in

try my hand once more at an exercise
of ingenuity in which as a youth I

England relies on gallant JELLICoE.”
“Worse even than the Suvla Bay loss

“Fasque,” I need hardly remind your
readers, was the seat of Mr. GLAD-

of whom some characteristic anecdotes
will be found in my Conversations with

ing effects not easily produced in the

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday, November
8th. — At time of national crisis the
Commons dally in prolongation of week-
end holiday. Noble Lords, heedless
of personal convenience, assemble to
discuss affairs.
“Reminds me,” said MEMBER For
SARK, looking on scene from Commons'
Gallery below Bar, “of pretty story of
troubadour's lady-love:–
‘Sadly she thought of him
Whilst others slept.'
Whilst we of the Commons make holi-
day here are the Lords, sadly thinking
of their country, gathered together
to save it. A little unkind of LANs-
Down E, after sitting through three
hours of the talk, to remark, ‘There
has probably never been a more
discursive debate.’”
JEREMIAH, first Earl of Lore-
BURN, led off with chapter of
Lamentations. Looked back on
story of fifteen months of war
and, behold it was very bad. A
Cabinet three years ago deprived
of priceless counsel and com-
panionship had blindly blundered
along.
Speaking later, Co URTN EY s
mingled his tears with JEREMIAH's. S
“Whether,” he moaned, “we
look at home or abroad, our old
civilisation, which we had built
up through long generations, is
almost destroyed.”
In vigorous speech MILNER
brought debate to bear upon
actualities of the hour, with
special reference to situation in
the Balkans. Admitted he trod
on unsafe ground. Murmur of
sympathy ran over benches when
he alluded to himself as one “who
called a spade a spade with a rope
róund his neck.”
Useful purpose of debate at length
appeared in sharp commentary on
organised custom whereby, as MILNER,
fearless of the rope round his neck,
bluntly put it, “such war news as is
published has from first to last been
seriously misleading.” Such as it is, it
is withheld from the public till after
interval of time that makes it ancient
history.
CURzoN replied to this and other
criticisms. Hinted at possibility of
promptly publishing accounts of en-
gagements without going into details
useful to the enemy. Aſter two or three
weeks, might be supplemented with
names and details.
A clumsy device, but anything better
than the present grotesque, unavailing,
ostrich-like system.
Business done. — Talked for three ADMIRALTY, who daily answers ques-
hours round the War. No Resolution
being submitted, got home in time for
dinner. -
House of Commons, Tuesday. —
House heard with profound satisfaction
statement made by H. W. ForsTER on
behalf of War Office with respect to
woeful waste of food in Training Camps
throughout the country. Cheery pros-
pect of being mulct to extent of one-
half his income does not chill tax-
payers' resolve to carry on the War to
its appointed end. He sees with concern,
but without approach to downhearted-
ness, the daily cost mounting up from
three millions a-day to five millions.
THough on UNSAFE GROUND, Lord MILNER BoldLY
CALLs A SPADE A SPADE.
He will pay to the uttermost farthing.
But, with national business instinct, he
wants full return for his money.
To hear or read of wholesale wanton
waste of good and costly food, the result
of lack of system and plan of administra-
tion almost incredible in its unintelli-
gence, rouses just anger. No complaint
is made of wastage at the Front, where it
is inevitable. It is in the Home Camps,
where no such excuse or extenuation
exists, that a scandal prevails which
invites peculation.
According to ForsTER the War Office,
waking up at end of fifteen months,
has resolved to deal with the matter.
“A complete organisation is now in
existence,” he said, “with result that
themessing has been improved, economy
has been effected and waste reduced.”
At Question time little bout between
ex-Colonel LYNCH, late of South Africa,
and PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY To
tions for his absent chief. MACNAMARA
declined an invitation extended by
Member for West Clare to discuss details
of defences of London against Zeppelin
attacks.
“Does the answer of the Right Hon.
Gentleman,” persisted LYNCH in one of
those Supplementary Questions that
are responsible for much ill-feling,
“show his inability to reply, or does
it really mask gross incompetence in
his department?'
“The answer means what it says,”
was MACNAMARA's sharp response.
Business done.—Remaining clauses
of original Finance Bill passed through
Committee.
Wednesday.—A full House to
hear the PREMIER's speech cn
moving new Vote of Credit, the
fifth since War began. Lord
Court.NEY, wearing the white
" waistcoat of a blameless life,
looked on, sole occupant of the
Peers' Gallery.
In speech of less than an
R) hour's duration PREMIER stated
that total Votes of Credit amount-
cd to hitherto unheard - of sum
of £1,662,000,000. New one
would carry us on till the middle
of February, that is iſ current
expenditure of five millions a day
is not exceeded. Only cheerful
note in this portion of speech
occurred when he expressed hope
that the sum would suffice.
Later there was another gleam
when he declared his conviction
that “the fine spirit and resources
of the Allies will bring the War
to a triumphant conclusion.”
Business done.—New Vote of
Credit for £400,000,000. Sitting
came to abrupt conclusion with
adjournment of the House at a quarter-
past ten, by way of rebuke to PREMIER
and his colleagues in the Cabinet
absent from Treasury Bench through-
out debate.
“As far as can be ascertained the intention
of the Federal Government is to float a loan of
only £500,000,000 before Christmas. The
other instalments will be left until next year.
This will make much less disturbance in
financial circles than the £20,000,000 loan.”

Judging by what we have read of
Mexico in recent years the confusion is
pardonable.

struck at paying more than three-pence
each for a cigar so long as the War
lasted. He used to smoke Havanas,
but now he didn't mind what it was so
long as it had the outward semblance
of a cigar. -
And so we went on until, after a

said a young man in khaki who was at

absurd, of course, because a cellarful
would be much more economical.”
That was the end of it. This ass
always ruins serious discussion with
his ill-timed jokes. -

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXX.
(From the Tsar of Buda ARIA.)
Most HIGHLY WENERATED BROTHER,--I cannot refrain
from writing to you, though it is highly probable that we
shall soon meet in what has been described as the tented
field. For that meeting I have made all the necessary
preparations. Your life and your welfare are of such high
importance to our Common Cause that I shall take care
not to expose them to any foolhardy risks. I know that,
like myself, you are panting to be in the very front line of
the battle, wherever the danger is greatest. That, as I
say, was my desire; but RADosi Avor'F dissuaded me.
“Sire,” he said, “at this crisis in the affairs of Bulgaria we
cannot afford to lose your wise counsel and your diplo-
matic ability even for a single hour. Think of the joy that
would be spread amongst our foes if you were wounded.
Moderate your ardour and remain where there is some
slight prospect of immunity from the dastardly attacks of
the Serbians and their Allies. At a distance of twenty
kilometres from the Front you can always direct us with-
out losing that calm which is essential. While our soldiers
and officers do the rough business of fighting you can, at
that distance, smile upon their efforts and reward their
merits with your august approval. But above all things,
I repeat, moderate the ardour which is natural to a soldier
and a Tsar.” That was his advice, and, though I must
not altogether endorse the flattering terms in which it was
conveyed, I was forced to recognise its wisdom and I have
therefore adopted it.
What glorious days we are living in ' If anyone had
told me when I first accepted the Bulgarian throne that it
would some day be possible for me to spring to the assist-
ance of your Empire and that of our poor old friend,
FRANCIs Joseph, I should have been frankly incredulous.
I could not have believed that you, the son of the peace-
loving Emperor, FREDERICK, and I, the grandson of Louis
PHILIPPE, the Citizen King of the French, should ever be
associated together in the greatest warlike undertaking
that the world has ever known; that we should be within
reach of a position from which we two together shall be
able to dictate laws (or, shall we say, to impose lawless-
ness?) on the whole universe. Yet here we both are, liſted
by time and our own efforts to the highest pinnacle of
earthly success. He indeed spoke truly who declared
that the Prussians were the Bulgarians of Europe outside
the Balkans. You yourself will, I am certain, recognise
the appropriateness and justice of this pithy declaration,
now that Bulgarian valour has again been tested against
Serbia, our hereditary foe.
There is only one matter in regard to which I take
exception to your proceedings, and on this I will speak
openly as a Tsar may properly speak to an Emperor. You
have lately caused a woman to be shot in Belgium by a
sentence of court-martial. It is true that she was an
English nurse and that she had broken the German
military law by aiding English and Belgian soldiers to save
their lives by escaping from Belgium. Still, the fact
remains that she was a woman, and that in the course of
her merciful employment she tended the wounded of your
nation as well as those of her own. I cannot help thinking
that it would have been better and more expedient to spare
her life. I do not want you to think that I am squeamish
or that I shrink from ruthlessness when ruthlessness is
necessary. My record in Bulgaria should relieve me from
such an accusation. But even I am clearly convinced that
it was wrong to have this woman killed. The deed has
stiffened the resolution of our enemies, and has cast dis-
w
grace on our cause in neutral countries, where Germans
are now denounced as butchers of women. This is dis-
agreeable to me, for I wish to shine in public estimation
for chivalry no less than for glory. I know I have merely
to hint this to you in order to make sure that such an act,
so harmful to our reputation, shall not occur again. In
everything else I am your profound admirer,
FERDINAND.
GENTLER WAYS WITH THE PRESS.
IN the House of Commons, the other day, some questions
were being asked about the police raid on the offices of The
Globe, when the honourable Member for the Pacific (Sir
WILLIAM BYLEs) asked whether there was not some gentler
way of dealing with erring newspapers.
We deplore the burst of laughter which greeted the
question, because we are quite sure that several less drastic
expedients might have been tried before the sudden intrusion
of the police in force.
The gentle word has been known by some of our pictur-
esque writers to break down the most stubborn resolve of
even the hardened wrongdoer. To have its full effect it
should be spoken by a sweet-faced white-haired old lady, or
some frail and fair young thing with moist eyes, Surely
somebody at Scotland Yard has a mother or a sister who
could have entered The Globe office timidly and, placing her
hand on the arm of the Editor or the foreman of the
machine-room, or whoever it was, appealed to him affec-
tionately to stop it. Or a fair-haired laddie of six summers
might have done it if properly coached, without all that
trampling of heavy police boots about the place. Surely
the heads of the police have had brought to their notice the
potency of the little innocent child in melting the heart—
the curly-headed boy and the burglar, little Stephen and
the wife-beater, being cases in point.
Then, again, birds or white mice might have been tried.
Surely it would not have been beyond the powers of Scotland
Yard to introduce a robin into The Globe offices. Ere now
strong men have wept at the sight of the little red-chested
fellow and have resolved thenceforth to lead better lives.
Art and poetry should have been brought to bear. Is
there no policeman artist who would have lent his master-
piece, “Sunshine in the Home” or “Telling the Story to
Mother,” to be placed in the Editor's office for a while to
exert its silent influence 2 And, if it was not convenient for
a policeman-poet to turn out a few rhymes at the moment,
the works of ELLA WHEELER WILcox can easily be obtained
at reasonable prices, and would have had some effect.
Or why was not persuasive eloquence tried ? Among the
special constables of the division in which The Globe
offices are situated are numbers of able barristers. Why
were not their services employed 2
And there is music. The message of music reaches the
heart even more swiftly than the spoken words of a
barrister. Couldn't the police band have gone round to the
office and played a few selections?
“Information now available indicates that M. Briand will become
foreign minister as well as premier, with Jules Cambon, who was a
Mr. Togery at the outbreak of the war, as his principal secretary."
Norfolk Ledger and Dispatch (U.S.A.).
The correspondent who sends us the cutting kindly ex-
plains it as follows:– “The cable as received, in describing
M. CAMBON, said he was ‘AMR To GERY,' which is, of course,
Reuter's abbreviation for “Ambassador to Germany.’ The
local editor, however, apparently thinking that the passing
by the Censor of such a phrase was too good to be true,
gave us the thrilling version set cut above."

THE NAVY IN A NUTSHELL.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. A. H. Poll, EN in “Land
and Water.”)
THERE have been no purely naval activities this week
that require comment, but I have none the less matter of
the greatest moment to discuss. For I regret to say that my
critics have been throwing doubt upon some of my con-
clusions. That is a question which I must go into at once
and in detail. Not that I wish to hold myself above criticism;
I know very well that any one who has reached a pinnacle
as a Naval Expert must be prepared for it. But, holding
as I do that the views that I put forth in this journal are of
national importance, I cannot allow them to be assailed.
One of my critics, writing in the Press, has –I deeply regret
to say—brought to light an old story against me which
I had hoped was safely dead and buried. It worries me:
now that the cat is out of the bag it worries me confoundedly.
He declares that I am not a sailor. Well, I must face it.
It is true, I am not. It is not, strictly speaking, my fault.
I trust the public will not jump to the conclusion that it
was either my fault or my parents'. In any case, deeply
as I deplore it, it is now too late to do anything. I lie
awake at night and think about it. I would give almost
anything—except my position on this journal—to be a
sailor. But my laicism is chronic.
All the same, though I am not a professional, I am
not to be branded as an amateur. I am thoroughly well
grounded; I have got the thing up; I do know my subject.
And I may add in self-defence that I have been entertained
—in peace time—more than once on board a battleship.
I could call plenty of witnesses to show that the Navy has
always been my special hobby. I have quite a passion for
calibres and displacements and things, and have had ever
since I was at school. There is no deception about it. I
can only hope therefore that the public will receive the
shock of my laicism without flinching.
Another critic draws attention to a passage in which I
stated that the Navy will be perfectly satisfied as long as
the German Fleet remains lurking in Kiel. The bare sug-
gestion of what my words have implied, according to his
reading of them, has made my hair stand on edge and
set my teeth on end. The idea that I could have imputed to
Sir John JELLICoE's command the slightest satisfaction at
not meeting the foe would be absurd enough to any one
who knew me and my sentiments, but my words would
seem to have carried this construction to the critic in
question, who goes so far as to attribute it to my laicism.
No one knows better than I the high spirit of the Sure
Shield. I have often commended it in these columns.
All that I meant to imply—and I must apologise pro-
foundly for the ambiguity—was that, as long as the German
High Seas Fleet refused an engagement, the British Navy
was doing all it could. I feel confident that my words were
not misunderstood in the wardrooms of the Fleet.
I have decided on this occasion to hold over my usual
weekly prediction that America will declare war upon
Germany within the next few days. I hope to be in a
position to revive this feature in our next number, but
something depends upon the ineffably illogical BERNSTORFF.
I have been fortunate enough to receive a large number
of delightful letters from charming people in relation to my
quaint account of the sinking of the Königsberg. That is
no great surprise to me as I felt certain that it was bound
to please. The consensus of opinion, both in my corre-
spondence and in the Service Clubs, seems to be that my
gunnery deductions were correct.
If there is no further news from the Adriatic, the AEgean,
the Baltic or the Black Sea, I shall hope to return next
week (which I shall do very gladly) to my little quadrilateral
diagrams of the Submarine “blockade.” One of my fore-
most critics, surely in a fault-finding mood (even I cannot
satisfy everyone), has been making merry at the expense of
these poor diagrams of mine and has asserted that the
figure three conveys its meaning quite as directly as three
little squares neatly drawn one above another. I know
very well that my readers will not agree with him. An
article of this kind cannot exist without diagrams—that
much I have learned from a study of the work of my dis-
tinguished military colleague upon this journal. They
break up the page and give the thing an appearance of
diversity, besides tending to excite curiosity in the reader.
Nothing could be more effective than my diagrams. If
you want to know how many ships have been lost you
have only to count the squares, pricking them off as you
go along with a pin. It is just on such points as these
that I hope I am of service to my readers, who have
perhaps less time and ingenuity than I have, by collating
the newspaper reports and expressing them diagramatically.
The thing can also be done even more satisfactorily with a
box of bricks. That is how I do it at home—if I may give
away a personal secret. I have the whole . built up
on the smoking-room mantelpiece, with coloured bricks for
the Atlantic liners. Not a bad idea for a layman.
And while I am on this question I may add that the
effect of searchlights upon Zeppelins—as a guide to gunnery
—may be usefully tested by working in a dark room with
a suspended banana and an electric torch.
The Point of View.

my special constable duty, I
call for the Quartermistress
to escort her home. Though
a veritable dragon in a store-
room she is a little timid in
the dark. Then, as I am
badged and armleted, that
great person, the hospital
matron, condescends to ex-
change a word or so with me.
She is a magnificent person,
and as she sweeps down on
me in her official uniform
I feel absolutely confident
about the War. Nothing
could beat her. If she could
be marched along the Brit-
ish lines I know the Bosches
would break and flee. . . . . - - -
Still I am nervous when she speaks
to me. It is like talking to a Zep-
pelin.
On this night she bore down on me.
“We shall have rain to-morrow,”
she said, and I felt that the elements
would obey. -
“You have noticed an hotel oppo-
site?" continued the matron.
“Is there one?” I murmured. Guilty
man that I was, I had often taken refuge
in it when the Quartermistress had not
finished form-filling and stock-taking
and I had dreaded waiting for her
under the matron's severe eye.
“Yes. Listen to that,” said the
matron.
There was a sound of revelry from
across the way.
“That has been continuing all the
evening. It must cease.”
“Do the wounded object?” I in-
quired timidly.
‘The Merry Widow'? Will you please
stop it at once 2"
Automatically obedient I walked to-
wards the hotel. I found an electric
piano in full blast. I removed my
armlet and ordered a beverage—not
from thirst but from diplomacy—and
appealed to the landlord.
“Is that to be kept going all night?”
I asked. “It gets on the nerves of the
matron of the Red Cross Hospital.”
“Well, Mister, Councillor Stubbs
uses this 'ouse and he's a wottler if
ever there was one.”
“A what 2 ''

structions I give to a special constable
are promptly attended to,” beamed the
matron.
The next day, as I passed the hotel,
the landlord stood at the door.
“She come,” he said, nodding to-
wards the hospital.
“What did she say?”
eagerly.
“A lot,” returned the landlord.
“Er—anything about me?”
“She said that if I wouldn't take no
notice of a special—and she didn't
blame me, as they was such a poor
lot—I'd got to take notice of 'er. Yes,
I stopped the piano. I told her that
Mr. Stubbs was a true wottler, but she
said that it was wottling that was losing
us this War. She ain't got what I call
the wottling spirit. A fine figure of a

MALENTENDU CORDIAL.
THE alliance with France in our suburb is imperilled—
nay more, it is all but suspended. The regrettable in-
cident only shows how a mere choice of words, spoken
without a suspicion of malice or evil intent, may in a single
infelicitous moment undo the loving labour of years.
It happened in this way. In our suburb we are nothing
if not original, so it occurred to us to give a concert in aid
of the Belgian Relief Fund. The clou of the entertainment
promised to be the performance of a French lady vocalist,
a refugee, who had been a professional.
The eventful night arrived. Each artist was introduced
by our curate, who constituted himself a kind of articulate
programme, and then the French lady's turn came. Now
I am quite sure that the curate, a most earnest-minded
young man, was guiltless of any intention of facetiousness
in his introduction of Madame Chambellan; he was incap-
able of it. Yet before she had started to sing the aria,
“Mom caeur s'ouvre d ta voir,” the audience broke into
delighted laughter, and continued to give vent to subdued
giggles during the first few bars of the song. Gradually,
however, it dawned on them that no humour was intended,
whereupon their attitude became, and remained to the end,
one of half-aggrieved bewilderment, as of people who have
been unwarrantably deceived.
Madame came off the platform in high dudgeon, declar-
ing she had never been so insulted in her life and that
“ces Anglais" were still the rudest, the most stupid and
the most perfidious people in the world. For how should
she, poor lady, ignorant of “Sister Susie Sewing Shirts for
Soldiers,” appreciate the fact that her auditors had been
led to expect a French variant of that popular ditty by the
curate's announcement, expressed in the following terms:
“Madame Chambellan will now sing a chanson from
Samson, by SAINT-SAENs”?

of rest and quiet.
THE WATCH DOGS.
XXIX.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, I may not be
in a position at the moment to give
you information at first hand from our
own trenches, but I can give you the
next best thing—life stories of great
soldiers from the opposite trenches.
I don't recollect his name (Fritz as
likely as not), but, whatever he might
call himself, it was just fifteen months
ago when he suddenly realized the in-
tensity of his belief in himself and
everything German, and his scorn of all
other nationalities, temporarily except-
ing certain possibles in the Near East.
A passion for war came over him ;
battles and bloodshed, he discovered,
were things which appealed irresistibly
to his fair godlike Teuton manhood.
His newspaper told him what a fine
fellow he was and what a warlike
nature was his ; when he came to think
of it, he saw how true this all was,
especially the part about being godlike.
He itched for War, for which, it ap-
peared, he was already scheduled, and
his first experience of the horrors of it
did nothing to change his mind. He
came undaunted and unscathed through
a period at a training centre in the
interior, a period of garrison-duty in
occupied Belgium, and even more stren-
uous soldiering in a side-show on the
Eastern front, where, with nothing
more than a dozen or so heavy siege
batteries and at most a gross of field
guns behind him, he had to keep his
end up against hundreds of dangerously
angry peasants, armed with real sticks
and stones.
He not only held out, he liked hold-
ing out, and he was quite annoyed when
he was told to give over for a day or
two and come down to a soft job in the
West. They reminded him that he had
shown himself to be a finer fellow even
than originally supposed, and at last he
came to see that, even if things were
to be easier and less worthy of him in
the new area where the enemy hadn't
any sticks or any stones and had been
strafed into an abject inertia, he had
had a hard time and deserved a period
It would be hardly
worth while taking his rifle with him,
he suggested, if the enemy was as done
in as all that. “Perhaps you'd better,”
they told him. “It is just possible the
French and English may attempt some
half-healted violence in their last dying
spasm;’ and so he entrained, and told
all his friends whom he saw en route
that he would write them long letters
from his new quarters, where he ex-
pected to be very quiet and have a lot
of time on his hands.
His holiday began in earnest as his
train approached the Western front;
he was asleep at the time, but his
holiday beginning woke him up. His
first treat was a great spectacular
bomb-dropping turn by a Frenchairman.
For this he was in the front row seats,
so to speak: long after it was all over
he laboured under the impression that
he had been the target instead of the
privileged audience. He said he really
should want some months of repose
after that, and was told that he would
get it sure enough if he wouldn't just
mind helping to restore so much of the
train as could be found to so much of
the line as was left. He took them at
their word, as became a well-disciplined
Teuton, but he couldn't help being
puzzled when he remembered their
earlier statements that the Allies had
practically no ammunition left, what
with English strikes and French revo-
lutions and German submarines and
suchlike. However, he and his fellow-
travellers, who were in the same case,
thought perhaps that this was the last
shell and got rid of the “practically.”
But the English airman who was next
featured upset that argument (and a good
deal besides), giving them, in another
bomb or two, what you might call the
“All change here" chit. Our holiday-
maker concluded his journey on foot,
but even his country stroll somewhere
in France did not lack movement, being
enlivened by the Crump family, in their
side-splitting entertainment presented
by our gunners.
Twice detrained from above, much
harassed by public nuisances of all
sorts on the level, and lastly, even while
unpacking his valise in his dug-out,
rudely shaken from beneath, this ardent
enemy of ours lost first his ardour,
then his enmity, and conceived such an
affection for us that he must needs run
across the open that very night in order
to be, as he now is, among us.
By the way, you'll take a morbid
pleasure in hearing that he quite agrees
with your view as to the trend of
affairs. We are being thoroughly
beaten on all sides; the Central Powers
win all the way. He has this in writ-
ing from the people who are doing it.
We asked him, if this was so, why
he was in such a hurry to throw in
his lot with ours. But we had asked
him such a lot of questions by that
time that one can quite understand his
answer being a little confused.
This Fritz is not the only interesting
person I've come in touch with just
lately. I have found the Royal Flying
Corps people not wholly depressing.
On occasion I borrow off them a gallon
of petrol to see me home; the pleasure
is theirs, they say; the honour is mine,
I protest; the petrol is, of course,
yours, Charles. These airy fellows talk
of war as if it were a day's shooting
and they the cock pheasants with the
best of the fun up aloft. Upon my word,
the hen who hatched such birds should
be a proud, if anxious, mother
Other people quite well worth meet-
ing are our French Allies. I see a lot of
them these days, and it won't be long
before we are exchanging kisses. The
old Chief of the French side of my
business rolled up the other day. I
and my particular ally saluted accord-
ing to our several ideas of proud
humility. He waved all that sort of
thing aside, gave us a hand each to
hold, called us his infants, his brave
infants, his very brave infants, and we
concluded the parade by shedding a
few tears of affection and joy together,
still holding hands. To-day I have
with some pains composed and written
out orders for our new French depart-
ment, “signed by Henry, Lieut., for
Lieut.-Col. Commanding,” which con-
cluded as follows:—“In end of account,
you will you remind that, the responsi-
bility of the French Service of what-
you-may-call in this Army being to
you, Mister the Colonel will well wish
to have all the confidence in you, he
will count on you and he will. you
reinforce altogether and all at once if
you you find in the embarrassment of
the undiscipline.”
Our idea of our ally as a soldier is that
his élan and gay courage are very much
more remarkable even than supposed;
but for the dull heavy work of continued
warfare there is wanted, if we may say
so without offence, the more stolid
qualities of the English. On the other
hand the French opinion of their ally as
a soldier is that his dash and devilment
are really astonishing, even to the most
expectant critic; but for the sordid
monotonous strain of this trench busi-
ness it needs (a thousand pardons !)
the duller persistence of the French.
Yours ever, HENRY.

THE HERO OF THE HOUR.
As it was my first time home on
leave from the Front, I had expected
that my tales of battles would create a
certain amount of interest amongst my
friends and relations. My haversack
was filled with German buttons, pieces
of shrapnel, shell fuses and other in-
struments of torture, picked up on the
stricken field or bought in French
shops, and my tongue was eager to be
telling of hair-breadth escapes.
My arrival in Hampstead certainly
caused a little interest. My parents
were glad to see me safe and sound.
My sisters, so they said, were proud of
me. My aunt, who believes that every-
one should be sent to the Front the
day he enlists, and kept there until he
is killed, wished to know when I was
going back. I obliged her with the
date, and we sat down to dinner.
They asked me how I liked it, and
I started on the tales. They listened
in polite silence to what I had got to
say. Somehow the souvenirs in my
haversack began to lose their value,
and I decided that they had better stay
where they were till a more favourable
opportunity for exhibiting them pre-
sented itself. I turned the conversa-
tion from wars and rumours of victories
to the latest theatres. They were not
interested, and by the time we reached
the coffee I had decided that they pre-
ferred to talk rather than listen.
Had I seen a Zeppelin 2 Did I hear
about that last raid 2 Would I like to
see the piece of bomb that the house-
maid's young man had found, and the
housemaid had presented to the family
in recognition of an extra half-day out?
Was I talking of going to a theatre,
and didn't I know that a London
theatre was the most dangerous spot
in the world 2
This conversation, in its turn, bored
me to distraction, for I was one of the
lucky two hundred of my battalion to
emerge undamaged from the last scrap.
But it showed me that to produce my
relics of the field was to invite indiffer-
ence and a further half-hour of Zep-
pelin anecdotes, so I pleaded acute
fatigue and went to bed.
Next day we talked of Zeppelins and
their frightfulness from breakfast to
teatime. Then, as I found myself the
least important member of the family,
I sought out a male friend and together
we went to Shell Out. Luck was
with me, for they came. I heard them
whirring in the distance and I saw
search-lights playing on the sky. I
never saw the smallest trace of a Zepp.,
and I didn't care to, for my object was
achieved, and I returned to Hampstead
happy and uplifted.

Of how they heard the hideous cannon's roll,
And many a vivid but invented fray.

The lust for slaughter yet illumed their eyes;
On the way up they nearly took the life
Of two black braves from Afric (our Allies);
They longed to leap from out the sandbag's screcn,
And in close combat satisfy their spleen;
While I, who, truth to tell, was not so keen,
Hardly persuaded them it was not wise.
The slow days travelled, and no blood was drawn,
Yet long their hearts were lionlike and large,
For oft we woke them, on the cool still dawn,
To arm and hasten to the battle's marge,

to many more experienced speakers.
Certain references to him had been made
on previous day by WINSTON CHURCHILL.
Having been in the service of his
country for sixty-one years, he was
content to leave his record in the hands
of his countrymen.
“It is,” he added, “unfitting to make
personal explanations affecting national
interest when my country is in the midst
of a great war.”
With this dig at WINSTON, possibly

By this time PREMIER had retired,

Thursday. —In debate on Appro-

waste of rations in the trenches and in

speaking on behalf of War Office, threw
flood of light on situation by simple
statement. As result of stricter super-
vision wanton waste has already been
checked. Yesterday report received
from one command stated “In the
month of October we saved 800,000 lb.
of meat, a ton of mustard, a ton of
pepper, ten tons of salt, ten
tons of bread, and a ton of
bacon.”
ForsTER beamed with
honest self-congratulation
at this evidence of efficiency.
House rather inclined to
regard it as painful confes-
sion of amazing miscalcula-
tion. Problem takes form
of Rule of Three sum. If
in one month, in a single
command, ten tons of bread
and a ton of bacon, not to
mention meat, mustard,
pepper and salt, are chucked
away by the ton, what has
been the aggregate of waste
over a period of fifteen
months in respect of an
Army of a million men?
The harried tax-payer
- cheerfully suffers personal
and domestic privations. In order
generously to feed our gallant soldiers he
gives up luxury of breakfast bacon, cuts
down his butcher's bill, toys with the
pepper-castor and the salt-cellar and
saves up odd crusts of bread. But this
ton of wasted bacon, so to speak, sticks
in his throat. -

when my bairns are quiet. Noise is

bairns how to live. Every good school-

No self-respecting bairn should ever
be without an adequate supply of

giving each of my bairns a fresh ball of
this precious substance at least once a
week. It not only pleases them but it
has often enabled me to stick to my
work long after I should have naturally
left my chair.
As a boy my great ambition was to
possess (1) a Jew's harp; (2) a saloon
pistol. Acting on the principle that
all boyish instincts are sound, I have
purchased and presented one of each
to every bairn in my school and
encouraged them to bring them into
class. I do not insist, because insist-
ence is a crime. As a matter of fact
only two of my bairns have declined to
come into line. The results are most
exhilarating, though so far I have only
had two flesh wounds in the leg.

The cult of spelling is one of the
greatest curses of our educational sys-
tem. No really great man was a good
speller. SHAKSPEARE spelt his name
in nineteen different ways, and I en-
courage my bairns to follow his great
example. One of our best lessons con-
sists in spelling our names with the
fewest possible number of right letters.
I have given a prize to a bairn who
spelt his Christian name without a
single letter right —“Gekup " for
“Jacob.” --- ---
I object to age and experience; I am
all for youth and empiricism. The duty
of a schoolmaster is not to teach, but
to preserve the youthfulness of his
pupils by adopting their standpoint,
and dress. I always wear short thick
pants. x: ::
If one of my bairns misbehaves, I
send him to the top of the class. Top

The prime essential in essay writing
is to know absolutely nothing about
the subject. Then and then only is it
possible to approach it in a spirit of
fresh and vital detachment. All know-
ledge is dangerous, but ignorance is of
the Seventh Heaven.
I have not been caned by my boys

LIFE ON A HALVED INCOME.
My efforts to live on half my income
have not hitherto been very encourag-
ing. To begin with, my income is
already half my income; that is to say,
it is exactly half what it was eighteen
months ago; and the attempt to live
on a quarter of the income to which I
have been accustomed has shown me
with appalling clarity the hopelessness
of my outlook.
As matters stand at present I feel I
am ploughing a very lonely furrow.
People upon whose co-operation I con-
fidently relied are not helping me a bit.
They don't meet me half-way. They
don't even half-meet me half-way,
which is the least they could do if this
half-income business is intended to be
at all reciprocal. For instance, last
week I sent my landlord a cheque for
my somewhat overdueſ. -º-º-º-º:

half. As I pointed out
to him in my letter, if
I was expected to live
on half my income, it
was clear that I could N.
only afford to pay half ºf
rent; and as he too was º
doubtless living on the
same principle, it would
save him a lot of un-
necessary book-keeping
if I only remitted the
half he was morally
entitled to spend. On
receiving his reply I
was agreeably sur-
prised to find my
own cheque enclosed.
brows, her voice, Cain, or anything else
indicative of acute indignation or disap-
pointment I shall pretend I made a
mistake.
In the interim I am doing my best
to halve everything possible. The other
morning the cook-general was laid up
in bed, the inclement weather having
brought on a bad attack of asthma,
which, owing to the increased cost of
drugs, she had not taken the necessary
steps to ward off. As I had to get my
own breakfast I thought it would be a
good opportunity to try to poach half an
egg. This was harder than it sounds.
I found I could poach the yolk alone, or
the white alone. To isolate either was
a simple matter. But when it came to
severing the conglomerate mass into
halves the egg slid all over the dish, and
ultimately found a destination on the
hearth-rug. However, I succeeded in

he exclaimed, glaring at me fiercely
and suspiciously. “Yes,” I answered.
“You see, though I said the child had
only one foot, what I really meant was
that it has Siamese feet—joined to-
gether, you know. That's why I must
have an eight.”
But my attempt was (pardon me)
bootless. Lastly I found that what a
contributor to Punch has already af-
firmed—that dentists are not reducing
their fees—is correct. I went with the
intention of getting the dentist to stop
a runaway bicuspid which had been
annoying me. “How much are you
charging these times?” I asked when
I had told him what I wanted. “A
guinea,” he replied. “But,” I said, “I
am attempting to live on half my in-
come. Can't you meet me in the
matter of your fee?” “Certainly,” he
said. “My ſee for total extraction is

half; and you may take
the tooth away with
you if you like.”

melancholysatisfaction
of living at half my
normal rate of ex-
penditure.

“Good " I thought. “He’s a sport.
He's going to live on no income at all.
He's not going to do things by halves.”
This latter part of my surmise proved
to be correct. My landlord demanded
a cheque for the rent in full, failing
which he threatened to put a man in
possession—a whole one.
This was not a very comforting start.
I then sent for my cook-general, and
vid the inclement weather, her º
and the increased cost of drugs—each
topic cropping up out of the other with
perfect naturalness—I adroitly intro-
duced the subject of a reduction in
wages. '
And now I am wondering whether
her emphatic “Not 'alf" was a cordial
acceptance or an indignant repudiation
of my suggestion. I wish I were better
versed in the actual meaning of catch-
phrases. Meanwhile I don't know
whether she will expect thirty shillings
or three pounds at the end of the month.
I shall begin by giving her thirty shill-
ings, and then if she raises her eye-
retrieving most of it, and put it into the
poacher, though from the subsequent
result I am still very hazy in my mind
as to whether I have really effected an
economy in half-poaching a whole egg
instead of whole-poaching a half-egg.
My next attempt was in the matter
of boots. I possessed a pair, one of
which was worn out, the other with
many months of useful service before
it. I can't explain why they should
have been in this uneven condition,
unless I have unconsciously formed
the habit of walking more with one leg
than with the other. Be that as it
may, I went to the bootmaker's and
placed an order for one boot. He
simply wouldn't listen to me. The
more I placed the order the less he
listened. Finally, in desperation, I
invented a purely mythical child who,
I said, had been born with only one
foot, and was now threatened with total
bootlessness. He became so far inter-
ested as to inquire the size. I told
him an eight. “Eights for a child?”

either average it at three hundred words to a sheet of

“I do not know,” said Francesca, “what this poor
gentleman is talking about. I trust the world will be kind
to him, for much learning hath made him mad. Come,”
she added sharply, “what are you driving at 2"
“I am driving,” I said, “at my first novel, which I am
going to start without fail in half-an-hour from now.”
“Gracious heavens !” she laughed, “I thought you were
talking about getting your hair cut.” -
“Francesca,” I said impressively, “I have noticed with
growing regret a tendency on your part to neglect the
higher things of the mind. I want the mantle of FIELDING
and you throw round my shoulders a hairdresser's linen
sheet. How, I ask you, can Art (with a capital A) flourish
in such an atmosphere?”
“Art,” she said, “with or without a big A, can look after
itself. It generally has to. But if you're really going to
write a novel I take back all I said against your having
your hair cut. I have noticed that in novels novelists are
always contemptuously referred to as “long-haired.' Now
I want you to be an exception, so you can go at once and
get your hair cropped close to the skull.”
“Then,” I said, “I shall be contemptuously referred to
as ‘short-haired.' I think I shall write my novel with my
hair as it is.”
“And then,” she said, “you'll be contemptuously referred
to as ‘medium-haired.’ You're sure to be caught what-
ever you do; and besides your hair will grow as you go
along. You'd better give up this strange idea of writing
a novel.”
“You are not,” I said, “very encouraging. Is it nothing
to you that you should some day be referred to as the
original of Alexandra in the novel of that name, or that
men and women, when they see you, should nudge one
another—” - - -
“Men and women don't nudge one another in the best
circles. They've given it up with butlers and motor-cars
and other luxuries. There's an Anti-nudge Society, and
I'm going to belong to it.”
“Anyhow,” I said, “that won't prevent your being
spoken of as the wife of Carlyon the novelist. What a
glorious day that'll be for us!”
“It'll be all right for you,” she said, “but I don't much
see where I come in.”
“Don’t you?” I said. “You’ll have a lot of reflected
glory, and so will Muriel and Nina and Alice and Frederick.
Their paths through life will be made easier for them.”

“Nothing too violent,” I said. “Just a gentle under-

“It'll be rather a queer undercurrent, won't it, if it does
that ? However, you know best, of course. Will there be
a hero?” -
“There isn't much done in heroes of novels nowadays;
but I think I'll have one.”
“Blue eyes?”
“No,” I said, “dark brown, the sort of dark brown that
has a red flash in it in the dark.”
“You're thinking of dogs,” she said. “And, by the way,
who's going to take the dogs out for walks while you're
writing your masterpiece?” -
“Arrangements,” I said, “must be made for the dogs. I
can't afford to subordinate fame to a Great Dane and three
Pekinese spaniels.”
“Well,” she said, “you'd better be off now and make a
start. There's no time like the present.”
“Yes,” I said, “there is. This time to-morrow will be
much more like the present. I shall begin then.”
“You might start on your hair to-day.”
“Yes,” I said, “I will.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE name of the Baroness voN HUTTEN recalls agreeable
memories of Pam, whom she created and projected, for our
benefit, into the field of literature. I regret not to be able
to assert that in Birds' Fountain (HUTCHINsoN) she has
reached her ancient standard. If she set out to write a
trivial tale, flavoured with something more than a soupçon
of naughtiness, about highly uninteresting people, she may
be said to have achieved a considerable success. As to the
characters, my profound conviction is that all of them,
with the possible exception of Mr. Immenham, a butler,
would be the better of a sound spanking. The heroine is
Mrs. Cloudesley Dorset, whose tiring-room is described in
the opening chapter with an amplitude and particularity of
detail calculated to bring a blush to the cheek of a hardened
male reviewer. She is supremely shallow-pated and very
beautiful, and, having passed what the author describes as
a petty useless silly little life, she finally entangles herself
in an intrigue with Mr. Archibald Hood, a Don Juan. Her
husband is so deeply devoted to her that, to ensure her
happiness, he is willing to put her in a position to marry
her adorer and to settle seven thousand pounds a year on
her. I ought to add—though this does not explain Mr.
Dorset's complaisance—that she is able to “smooth her hair
with absent skilful fingers,” a pretty trick to which I invite
the attention of Messrs. DEVANT. The story oscillates
between elopement and reconciliation, and finally comes
down with a bang on the right side of the fence after
Mr. and Mrs. Dorset have, to the surprise of the latter, met
and embraced at the grave of their child. Mr. Hood's fate
is not described, but I trust we are entitled to assume that
the statue of the Commendatore will get him.
Quite one of the most remarkable books I have encountered
for a long while is My People (MELRose). When I tell you
that the name of the author is CARADoc Evans you will
perhaps be able to make an intelligent guess at the nation-
ality of the People described. But no guessing could give
you any idea of the quality of these horrible (I use
the word advisedly) studies. The Welsh peasantry have
been written about before now, in a variety of aspects; here
we have them, or, as I would prefer to hope, the lowest
class of them, from within. Not a trace here of poetry,
imagination or those pleasing manifestations of the Celtic
spirit that we have learnt to associate with Art movements
and the soulful eccentricities of the over-educated. I can
best compare My People to the grimmest passages from
HARDY, told in the language of the Old Testament. The
sordid brutality of them is only half relieved by a gleam of
savage humour that the author sometimes permits himself
in the telling. It doesn't sound pleasant, does it? Yet the
power of the thing is altogether undeniable. For page
after page Mr. Evans holds you, as The Ancient Mariner
held The Wedding Guest, and your unwilling attention has
no chance of escape. A word of warning however; My
People is emphatically not a book for indiscrimate leaving
about, even in these days of toleration. Mrs. Grundy is not
so much flouted as ignored by Mr. Evans. One feels
that he is telling of what he knows and has himself experi-
enced; it is this that gives its horrible fascination even to

the most repellent of the stories. The fact that they are
also literature will make me watch the writer's future work
with interest.
It is a long time since I read a new novel which reminded
me of CHARLEs READE, who latterly has been no one's
model. Yet all the way through Mr. Edward Noble's
story, The Bottle Fillers (HEINEMANN), recollections of Hard
Cash rose before me. Not only is there in it a young man
the victim of circumstances, and usually in search of a job,
but the book was written with a reforming purpose, the
author's desire being to see more justice done to the brave
men of the Merchant Service (who fill our bottles and
larders) and more vigilance on the part of the Board of
Trade (or Plaster Saint, as that august body seems to be
known at sea) to check rascally owners. So long as he is
at sea Mr. Noble is fine. He can marshal a storm with the
|has to me, a welcome escape, when health demands it,
from the immense and inexorable obsession of warfare;”
to which I should like to add that, whether my health
demanded it or not, I have tried and approved of his pre-
scription. The articles here have already been published in
The Daily Telegraph under the name of “Science from an
Easy Chair,” surely as seductive a title as the wit of a
Professor could find. The author, however, has not only
a nice taste for titles, but also the knack of presenting
scientific facts in a form that will not disagree with the
most delicately shy digestion. Even I, who thought myself
a “douser,” and now discover that my twig “plunged "
merely because my muscles became fatigued, must accept
this blow to my illusion with a good grace, out of pure
gratitude for the tonic quality of Sir RAY's Diversions.
It was doubtless because Mr. RILEY knew that the hero
best and prove every step T
of a fight with the elements.
But on land he is less con-
vincing, and I must confess
to getting as tired of Lucy
as of her forerunner in
READE's too lengthy attack
on private asylums. Nor
do I think it necessary for
Mr. NoHLE to be so ruthless
to both hero and heroine
(not to mention their only
child) as he is. The book

Sir James Digby, disgruntled victim of Land Purchase, is
the narrator of this acceptable trifle of a tale. The other
chief folk are a glib-tongued Nationalist, Gorman (a sketch
not void of malice), and Ascher, a subtle, likeable financier

A Book which is having a great
vogue in Berlin describes the entry of
the German Army into London, and
mentions incidentally that the troops
marched over London Bridge, as the
Charing Cross Bridge had been demol-
ished on the previous day by heavy
German artillery. We are glad to see
that this insidious attempt to enlist the
sympathy of Londoners for the invader
is being countered in advance, as the
South-Eastern Railway Company is
proposing to improve the appearance
of this engineering atrocity.

THE SOUVENIR.
THEY were a carriage - full of “veterans,” returning on
short furlough from Flanders—the new kind of veteran,
made by just the fifteen months of hard campaigning that
had filled their lives without cessation since they had landed
to the tune of “Tipperary” in August of last year. Veterans,
yet so close was their youth behind them that it would not
be denied, and bubbled out of them in strange contradic-
tion of their warworn appearance. Stories of Mons, the
Marne and “Wipers" were incongruously interspersed
with reminiscences of callow larks and ingenuous antici-
pations of the times they were going to have during their
short leave. -
First one and then another produced some treasured
souvenir that he was carrying back—a helmet, a piece
of shell or shrapnel. They all displayed their trophies,
excepting one somewhat older, hard-bitten man, who sat a
little aloof, taking no part in the loud talking and showing
but small interest.
At last one of the men addressed him directly: “Wot
'ave you got ?” •,
“Nuthink,” he replied shortly. -
“Wot! not an 'elmit nor nuthink to givyer gal?”
“Ain't gort no gal.” -
“Well, yer ole mother, then.” - -
“'Ere.' Never you mind abaht my ole mother, or you'll
get a thick ear, me lad!"
“Owl All right, 'Arry.”
“And,” fiercely, “my nime ain't 'Arry!”
“Blimeyl Marmajuke, then.”
A row seemed imminent, but peace was restored on the
understanding that “ Ginger didn't mean no 'arm.”
“Funny your 'aving no souveneers,” ventured one of the
peacemakers ingratiatingly. “They ain't 'ard to find.”
“Ain't gort no use fer 'em. Mug's gime, I calls it,
crawlin' abaht wiv shells and bullets dropping all arahnd

be to me if me 'ead was blown orf gettin' it! Wot's the

“But if you was to come acrost one, in a wye o' speaking,
I s'pose, nah, you'd pick it up?"
“Ow, if it was to come into me 'and, as you might sye, I
wouldn't mind, same as a souveneer wot I did 'appen to

me 'and wivaht looking fer it.”
“Was it, nah? And wot might it be 2"
They all became interested. -
“Ow, it ain't much.” And he produced a small iron
door-knocker from his pocket. -
“W'y, that's only a blinkin' knocker,” said Ginger; “I
s'pose yer pinched it off of some pore old Frenchwoman's
cottage door.” - - - - -

He prepares his desk for the next

Nothing more can be done, and you
hurry out to telegraph again for seats
and a cabin on the Dieppe route.
The next day you rise early for the
Folkestone train, the boat for Dieppe
now sailing from Folkestone—an added
hour of agony on the merciless sea—
and reach the port punctually enough,
only to learn that, owing to unexplained
causes, there is no service to-day. To
go back to London being absurd, you
take a room at a Folkestone hotel and
get through the day as best you can,
conscious with a certain dread sinking
that the wind is rising every minute
and a terrible gale is imminent. You
express your forebodings to fishermen
at the harbour, and they hold out no
hope. A stiffish storm is inevitable.
You buy sevenpenny novels, and hate
them. You play billiards with any
stranger humane enough to take you
on. You beat a young Naval officer
who is rather good, but the rude
buffetings at the window deprive you
of any joy in that feat. In the night
you wake to find your worst fears
realised—the hotel is shaking in the
tempest. You raise the blind in the
forlorn hope that the blast is confined
to the land and the sea is calm, and
are swiftly disenchanted. You return
to bed and cannot sleep for the beating
of your heart. - -
The next morning fortifies your
worst terrors. The waves are moun-
tains high, but the boat is going, and
you have not the pluck not to join it.
After all that has happened you simply
must go.
You hurry on board early to see if
your cabin is reserved all right and find
that your telegram arrived too late. . . .
Have I said enough to deter the
traveller to France 2 There is, how-
ever, more to follow.
The train from London is late, there
is a double number of passengers to-
day, owing to the defection of yester-
day, and the steamer does not get away
until three hours after time, when the
sea is infinitely more lumpy. On the
crossing it pitches and tosses away
another good hour; so that (dropping
a veil over the grisly horrors of the
passage) you are not at Dieppe until
seven instead of four. Once there, and
your passport, for the second time that
day, being viséd, and your baggage, for
the second time that day, being ad-
judged innocuous, you try to find a
telegraph office, but learn that there is
now nothing nearer than the head
bureau in the town; and here your
only gleam of sunshine in a depressing
day cheers you.
Having asked the way and lost it,
you stop an English soldier—for Dieppe
is full of A.S.C. men—and inquire
where the Post-Office is. I give the
dialogue verbatim:-
Yourself. “Can you tell me where
the Post-Office is ? I want to send a
telegram.”
Mr. Atkins (in broad North Countree).
“Ah don't know where it is. But will
you give me a drink?”
Yourself. “I’ll give you a drink
willingly if you'll give me a Post-Office
first.”
Here T. A. begins to shout, “Hi!
Hi! ” to some distant friends.
They stop and shout back, “What
is it 2 ''
T. A. “Hi! Come back | Ah've found
a moog.”
Yourself. “Mug | Oh no, my friend,
that's torn it. You can go to Tophet;
I'll find the Post-Office myself.”
You then ask a Frenchman, find the
way, and telegraph to your hotel that
your train will be four to five hours
late—a telegram which you subse-
quently discover no one will dream of
delivering until to-morrow is growing
old.
You then return to the station and
have what dinner you are able to
swallow, and walk up and down wait-
ing for the train to start, which it does
at nine-thirty, or forty-five minutes
after it was due to enter the Gare
St. Lazare.
At last it gets off and, maintaining a
snail's pace, creeps into Paris at exactly
2.20 A.M.
Now who will lightly adventure
upon a visit to the once Gay City ?
Nor will you be missed if you don't go.

MY DEAR CHARLEs, The other day
I was away at the far end of the
area. I had phut-phutted a couple of
dozen kilometres or so over care-worn
roads and hackneyed side tracks, all
amongst the motor-cars, motor-lorries,
motor-ambulances, other motor bicycles
as thrusting as my own, not to mention
the silly egotistical hens which abound
in these parts and have long ago lost
what little sense they had in peace
times. I arrived at my men's billet at
12.52 P.M. to the moment, and a most
convenient moment, too, as you'll agree.
Nobody appreciates more than I do the
contrast between my present facilities
and the housekeeping difficulties of the
men in front, where the trouble is ; and
nobody sets out on his morning rounds
with intentions more virtuous than
mine. But virtue doesn't flourish on
a motor-bicycle, and when I arrive I
find I have mislaid that conscience
which should make me refrain from
snaffling a slice of Uriah's ewelamb.
Uriah, bless his soul, was out on
this occasion, so there was nothing for
it but to leave a message and return
unfed. The Highland orderly was
very nice and cheerful about it all, but
didn't touch on the food question. It
is my business to know something
about languages and I think I should
have caught any reference to lunch
even in his. So first I cursed my luck,
and then I gave the old bicycle a kick
and off we skidded back, over the same
old hens, for home, where I was met
with a request from Sergeant-Major for
an interview at once. He gave me a
chit, referring briefly and coldly to my
leave. I told him that all previous
opinions were cancelled and he was
undoubtedly the finest Sergeant-Major
who had ever managed to survive the
dreadful business of being a Lance-
Corporal.
My leave was scheduled to begin on
the following day; the following day
was scheduled to begin at twelve mid-
night, and I happened to know there
was a boat scheduled to leave an hour or
two before midnight, and I had no doubt
of my ability to defeat the other sched-
ules if I could only get to the port of em-
barcation in time to do it. And to think
that iſ Uriah had been at home and I
had sat down with him to his old eve-
lamb (tinned at that) my chance would
have been lost long before I'd got
back to where Sergeant-Major and the
leave-chits grow !
With never so much as a gas helmet
(No. 2095 B pattern) by way of kit, or a
Park Drive Best Virginia Gold Flake
Cigarette by way of ration, I upped
and offed, dropping a piece of mudguard
at , other ballast at and at
, and finally parting with my
silencer at —. As to the last, I had
for some time been aware of a suspici-
ous noise, as it might be something
about to happen, but I wasn't being
too inquisitive and officious about it.
Once stop to inquire into the ailments
of these machines and they'll pretend
they're dead. In due course a lump
of metal fell off with a clank, but came
bounding along in the dark after us to
join on again. But we left it to itself
and proceeded so noisily that the little
villages, twinkling in the valleys be-
neath us, doused their lights at our ap-
proach, mistaking us for hostile aircraft.
When I had got my transport into a
rest path and myself on the quay there
were still a few minutes before the
sailing of the boat. I am always glad
to meet a new face, but this was not
the moment I should have chosen to
run up against what seemed to be a
couple or so of armies arriving. When
I was safe past them at last Iran into
a new thing in Majors, straggling be-
hind. “Say, officer,” he said cheerily,
“have you seen the boys anywhere?”
“Everywhere,” said I. “Be an old
dear,” he begged me, “and put me on
to my shemozzle. They're the Egmon-
ton Crush.” Had I had the time I
would have inquired into this; as it
was I told him briefly I’d just seen
that identical regiment moving out of
the harbour gates, and I set him doub-
ling away in that direction. I often
suspect, on reflection, that I've caused
the old fellow to get mixed up in the
wrong battle. For the moment my
brain was fully occupied in writing a
faithful description of myself in block
letters on white cardboard, stating that
I was not proceeding on duty and was
anything but sick. -
Reaching England at last I fought
for seats in the Pullman car. Being
small I was among the winners. It
was a difficult hour of the night for the
food-people to compete with, but, not
to be put off their hospitality by a little
thing like that, they served breakfast
on us before we knew what was hap-
pening. The company that can do a
large deal in eggs and bacon and mar-
malade at 11.45 P.M. deserves to make
its fortune, even if it be in five-franc
notes, slightly soiled. Finally we found
ourselves flung into the light and life
and laughter which are prevalent at
Victoria, S.W., at 2 A.M. on a Sunday
morning in war-time.
No doubt we are sent back to England
from time to time like this in order to
check our optimism. Out here we are
apt not to notice how rapidly and
completely we are losing. Anyway, it's
a gay welcome we get from London,
Charles. For myself it was the second
time, and I knew what to expect. My
young companion of the hour was in-
clined to think that no one loved him
and he'd much better go back to the
trenches and eat worms. The police-
men, upon being hailed, didn't respond;
they were very dignified, even sus-
picious. Four hotels refused to let him
so much as lie down on the tessellated
floors of their marble halls, and the
fifth only took him in because we
threatened them with legal proceedings
if they didn't. It was our threat alone
which recalled to the mind of Gold
Evening Dress that he had a room
vacant. The price of one night in that
room was equivalent to the subaltern's
wages for three days in the mud; we
proposed that it should be halved,
because there was only half the night
left, but it remained double because
there were two beds in the room.
When my friend agreed to that, or
anything else, he was asked whether
he had any luggage; and when we
explained that he'd started out with
his suit-case and top-hat box in one
hand and his cabin trunk and golf
clubs in the other, but had given the
lot to a poor man who sat begging at
the corner of a communication trench,
the official, puffed up as he was with
pride and regular meals, insisted upon
being paid in advance.
This is a true story, Charles, and if
you want to go round and discuss it
with the man, I'll give you his address
and half-a-dozen hand-grenades to
explain yourself with.
But at home how different 1 I believe,
when we come back again in the dead
of winter, they'll still produce that
last dish of green peas fresh from the
garden, “kept back special for you,
Master Henry . . .” Ah there's
little to be said, but lots to be thought.
And then it was all so short, so soon
over; but what there was (as Mr.
GEORGE RoPEY says) was good. When
I found myself back at Victoria
I considered the gathering of officers,
all great but some greater than the
others, and I wondered to myself,
how many of you, for all your greatness
and dignity, your importance on parade,
your habit of commanding and being
obeyed, saluted, deferred to and be-
lieved in, for all your top-boots, dare-
devil caps, red flannel tabs and eye-
glasses—how many of you, just about a
week ago, were being sent (sent, mark
you) round to the potting-shed to say
a word, any word would do, to the old,
old man who works there, and knew
you in long clothes, and would be heart-
broken rot to be called upon.
Yours ever, HENRY.

Territorial Driver (getting dangerously near the sea). “’ALT, cARN'T YER2 I'M on LY FoR Home service, IF You AIN'T' "
THE STRAFING OF STRAUSS.
(By an All-British Composer).
HERR Richard STRAUss's latest piece
of frightfulness, “An Alpine Symphony”
(referred to in Mr. Punch's Almanack),
may be regarded as a direct challenge
to British composers in general, and
myself in particular. Accordingly, by
way of reprisal, I am producing a work
which is to be absolutely the last word.
As I anticipate that a description of
it would be too much even for the
analytical genius of Mrs. Rosa NEw-
MARCH, I furnish one myself, and am
giving the readers of Punch the benefit
of it in advance. It is a Typographic
Tone-Poem in four paragraphs, to be
known as The Printing Symphony.
The orchestra will be considerably
augmented, the reinforcements com-
prising six Typewriters, a Telephone,
two Linotypes, an E5 Autoplate, four
Large Picas, a Long Primer, three
Double Octavos and two Double Sext-
uple Rotaries (by kind permission of
Associated Newspapers, Ltd.).
An impressive introduction by the
Double Octavos is followed by an
allegretto con grazia ma non troppo in
15-16 time, scored as a double trio
for the Typewriters, with Telephone
obbligato. As might be expected in
so advanced a work, no shift key signa-
ture is given. The movement comes
to an abrupt stop, the second para-
graph beginning with an announcement
(recitativo) by the Long Primer that
the MS. has been accepted and will be
proceeded with.
This statement is made the subject
of a lively fugue (alla brevier), begun
by the strings and wood wind; at the
sixth bar the Linotypes enter with a
counter motive suggestive of the Dia-
volo d'Imprimatore, to which reference
is made at intervals throughout the
work. -
The third movement begins with a
quartet for the Picas, andante canta-
bile, displaying to the full the mellow
beauty of this noble family of instru-
ments, accompanied pianissimo by the
rest of the orchestra, which at the
two hundred and forty-third bar have
just made a brief quotation from the
Typewriter theme, when the Autoplate
enters with a triumphant roar, and
after chasing the Picas away in a
succession of minor sevenths and
thereby establishing a personal ascend-
ency, dominates the proceedings for
the remainder of the movement, which
ends in a series of massive chords, an-
nouncing (con forza) that he's there
because he's there, an excerpt being
made at this point from the popular
marching song.
The fourth paragraph opens with a
short résumé of the preceding subjects;
the music then becomes wilder (allegro
furiosissimo inespressibile), neither time
nor key signatures being given, until it
reaches a climax with the entry of the
Rotaries, and finally comes to an over-
whelming conclusion on the seventh
inversion of the chord of the Submerged
Tenth, the discord, in accordance with
the best principles of modern Caco-
phony, being “left to evaporate.”
The work is to be performed shortly
at the Caxton Hall.
Hard Times in the West Indies.
“Among the lot of Fatables supplied ex
recent arrivals are the following:—
Lucas Best Fire Bricks. Lucas Best Tapered
Bricks. Best Bristol Hand Picked Temper
Lime. Steam Pipes 3 to 4" dia. with fittings.
Pig Lead. Blue Grit Grindstones. Sheet
Copper.”—Daily Gleaner (Jamaica).
“This big tract of land, if placed at the dis-
posal of men ready and willing to cultivate it
until the owners actually require it for build-
ing or otherwise, would enable nearly 200,000
men to cultivate all the vegetables needed by
an average family of, say, five persons.”
Morning Paper.
Are vegetarians so voracious?
“The simple folk of Devon and Cornwall, it
is said, maintain that the shades of Drake
and Nelson have returned to earth to inspire
their successors to emulate their triumphs, and
it is on record that from May, 1803, to August,
1905, Nelson was out of his ship but three
times.”—The Malay Mail.
A pity he couldn't stay there another
ten years or so, though, of course, the
Fleet still has the “ Nelson touch.”

The men sat mute along the line,

Was palpably in view;
A flare soared sudden through the murk;

But plied their triggers, undeterred

From sea to sea the tumult spread,
Nor could a single man have said
What he was shooting at.
They turned unflinching toward the Then spoke the guns, and gave it hot

No ordered cheer, but each man cried

But said it very loud.
A wilder din you will not meet;
It hit the hills, it shocked the Fleet,
And many a brave heart dropped a beat
To hear the hideous choir, -
While the pale Turk, with lips tight set,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Novem-
ber 22nd.—Emulating patriotic example
of the Lords, Commons began the week
with sitting to-day. PREMIER and three
Cabinet colleagues, safely back after
perilous Channel crossing, warmly wel-
comed. Von TIRPITz left gnashing his
teeth in disappointment at lost oppor-
tunity. To have wiped out PRIME MINIs-
TER, FoREIGN SECRETARY, FIRST Lord
of ADMIRALTY and MINISTER OF MUNI-
TIONs by one blow dealt from heavens
above the earth or from waters beneath
it, would have been stroke of Kultur
more pleasing in Berlin even than
sinking of Lusitania.
Appointed business being
further consideration in Com-
mittee of Budget Bill, attend-
ance scanty; proceedings
prosaic. CHANCELLOR of
ExchequER informed Com-
mittee that sale of scrip
vouchers of War Loan in
sm all denomination s
amounted to five millions
sterling. Submitted fresh
proposals for making invest-
ment more attractive to
wage-earner.
At Question time TENNANT
made interesting statement
with respect to comparative
salubrity of life under canvas
and under system of billet-
ing. Doctors in charge of
recruits report that when
men quit tents and go into
billets serious amount of sick-
ness forthwith develops.
“Under canvas it is much
more healthy.”
Business done.—Mills of Budget Bill
grind slowly in Committee. Another
long sitting devoted to process.
Tuesday.—House still economy-hunt-
ing. Thought it had “found " when
the other day vacancy created on
Equity Bench by retirement of Mr.
Justice Joyce. Evidence forthcoming
from various authoritative quarters
that state of business in Chancery
Court could be easily carried on with
remaining judicial forces. Question
immediately put on paper inviting
PRIME MINISTER to refrain from filling
up vacancy and so save £5,000 a year.
This stirred high authorities to un-
paralleled activity. In reply PREMIER
enabled to announce that a new judge
had already been appointed.

in the trenches, described as a well-paid
post of inactivity. Office of Chancellor

BRIGHT or WINston. Most appro-
priately PENNEFATHER (Heraldic motto
of this ancient family: “Take care
of your pennies and your father will
look out for himself") put up to
suggest that should it be deemed
necessary to appoint a new Chancellor
the Government might set an example
in economy by reducing the salary of
their new colleague.
This the sort of thing calculated to

salaries, fixed on scale arranged in
peace time, are assured. PREMIER
rode off on his consecrated reply that
“the matter is receiving my closest
attention.”
Thus repulsed on two favourable lines
of attack the economists turned off on
other track. It appears that the Head-
quarter Staff located at Hull endeavour
to make themselves comfortable in
offices leased at Station Hotel at
an annual rent of £410 per annum.
This trifle been paid since the War
began. ForsTER pleaded that sum
included firing, lighting and caretaking.
Still, when you come to think of it
—which the War Office are beginning
to do on 112th day of the second year
of the War—it seems a bit stiff.
However, there was another oppor- “Other premises,” he added, “are now

Attention next turned to luxury pre-
valent at public banquets. BATHURST,
spokesman of people of small means
officially enjoined to practise economy,
suggested that during the War all such
functions as the LoRD MAYor's Banquet
in London and the Dolphin and Colston
Banquets in Bristol shall be discon-
tinued. PREMIER full of sympathy.
But, really, this was a matter in which
individuals and public bodies must
exercise their own discretion.
This varied programme of economies
for use of other people looked hopeful
as seeming to lead up to a development
in respect of which the public are
keenly expectant. Economy like charity
should begin at home. When House
of Commons voluntarily relinquishes,
during continuance of the War, salaries
which only the other day, in
time of profound peace and
unbounded prosperity, were
conferred in breach of hon-
ourable and time-honoured
distinction among Legisla-
tive Assemblies, its cry for
economy will become more
effectual.

so avoid dissolution in

LEADER OF OPPosition, PRE-
MIER stated that introduction
is postponed till next week.
Whereupon Members went out into
the Lobby and tea-room to guess what
this postponement might portend.
Business done.—With assistance of
considerably less than a quorum several
small Bills advanced a stage. Adjourned
at twenty-five minutes past six.
Thursday.—On motion for adjourn-
ment till Tuesday, HENRY DALzied,
never weary of well-doing, pleaded for
an extra day's work. “Why not meet

that business on hand could not be

TO BILL, AGED SIX.
ALTHOUGH I'm just ten times his age
And long have cut, upon life's stage,
A figure quite austere and sage—
When will is pitted against will
I am the abject slave of Bill.
His parents are my lifelong friends
And often ask me for week-ends,
But, though his father is my host,
It's Bill that really rules the roast,
And, when I do as he disposes,
Life is not all a bed of roses.
If it is wet a tale of bricks
Is given me to pile and fix,
And when the structure stands on high,
With not a single brick awry,
The fabric, as my labour's crown,
Bill has the right of knocking down,
While I must gather up the blocks
And pack them neatly in their box.
Released from Architecture's claims
We turn to our Olympic games,
With Bill as driver, me as horse,
Pursuing our erratic course
Between the tables and the chairs,
Or even up and down the stairs,
Until the midday meal draws near,
And nurse removes my charioteer.
But, if the weather's bright and fair,
Bill hales me forth to take the air;
He makes me run exhausting races
And visit all his fav'rite places—
Tool-houses, chalk-pits, hollow trees,
And caves explored on hands and knees;
But always when the gong's vibrations
Recall us from our divagations,
Bill makes me promise not to talk
To anyone about our walk:
“Remember it's a secret”—so
Homeward the two explorers go.
Bill is a tyrant, I admit,
Yet may the old and the unfit
Win in his company relief
From sharp anxiety or grief;
For Bill no dismal paper reads
That mutinous misgiving breeds;
He never talks about the War,
But he is rich in fairy lore;
His laugh is my best anodyne,
His ignorance is half divine,
For Heaven still close about him lies
And has not faded from his eyes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SUMPTUARY LAWS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-On the principle
that the best brains in the country
should be at the disposal of the Gov-
ernment at the present crisis, I feel it
my duty to make a few suggestions on
the economic situation. You may take
it from me that we can afford to win
if I may be allowed to show us how.
But it may be a tight squeak, and there
is only one way to do it. That is by
killing two birds with one stone; other-
wise we shall soon be short of stones.
While, Sir, we pursue as a nation a
single aim, it is just as well in all
details of the enterprise to have a
double object in view. I am very glad
to see that one member of the House
of Commons has employed himself in
devising projects which, while they
have essentially a fiscal intention, are
also meant to nip luxury in the bud
and put the brake on extravagance.
He wants to levy a tax of five shil-
lings in the pound on all hand-reared
pheasants, and soon we may look for
the institution of a new and pictur-
esque Pheasant Licence. Any unli-
censed bird that gets into the bag
might well be claimed by the local Red
Cross Hospital, thus giving the tax
a third desirable tendency. A rebate
would no doubt be allowed on all such
as died a natural death, and if there
was any difference of opinion on that
point the bird could be submitted to a
post-mortem, for which a small fee
would be charged. (Licensed birds
would have to wear a badge or leglet.)
Then again, in view of the shortage
of milk, it is proposed that Cat
Licences be issued at a guinea a time,
except in cases where a cat is kept
solely for the destruction of mice.
This is another excellent idea. But
there is bound to be a considerable
loop-hole of escape unless the cat is
called upon to make good. Many so-
called mousers are mere pets. A
demonstration could be arranged with
Government mice. Or, simpler still, a
Mouse Licence might be imposed upon
all Freehold Cat Keepers which would
have the effect (besides bringing in
revenue) of keeping the cat up to its
work in clearing the house of them.
Much can be done along these lines.
This is no more than a promising
beginning. If cats are to be licensed
the cases of the mongoose and the
guinea-pig must come up for recon-
sideration.
Further, Sir, anything that tends to
give a man a distaste for his own fire-
side by robbing him of the solace and
companionship of his domestic pets
cannot but operate in the direction of
improved recruiting returns.
First Burglar. “DisgBiceFUL, I call IT |
ouGHT TER BE IN THE ARMY.”
GREAT 'EFTY YoUNG FELLER LIKE 'IM
Working on these lines I should be
inclined to levy a duty on:—
(1) CANARIES, which are notorious
consumers of seeds that might other-
wise be used for the upbringing of
edible and egg-laying fowls. All
canaries should be taxed, with the
exception of those that have been
specially trained as fly - catchers.
(These would be known as Controlled
Canaries.)
(2) TAME RABBITS AND HAREs (Bel-
gian Hares would of course be excused
out of deference to our Allies). An ex-
ception to be made in favour of such
as are designed for the table. (Known
as Exempted Rabbits or Hares.)
(3) GoLDFISH. — In this case per-
haps the Licence duty should only
apply to such as go beyond the number
of two in any one household. We
must have something to brighten our
homes, after all. (Or at least these two
might be placed in a later group.)
(4) SILKworMs. – Except such as
are engaged in spinning khaki silk,
suitable for scarves. (These would be
starred.)
There can be little doubt that such
wise and considerate taxation would
have the effect of raising money, con-
serving the food supply, assisting
voluntary enlistment and bridging the
gap between exports and imports.
I am yet again Yours,
STATISTICIAN.

AT THE FRONT.
TheRE's really nothing I hate talk-
ing about more, but, talking about
trenches, have you in England heard
yet of the awful case of S 245?
Well, we took over S 245 with two
platoons and instructions to “make it
good.” Having inspected it we wrote
out a curt little chit to the effect that
we weren't a reformatory, and then tore
it up. By using all the material sent
arrived next morning, “S 245 to be re-
constructed and occupied as soon as
possible.”
You people who compete for having
been most directly under the Zeppelins
are not the only ones. I was sitting,
the other afternoon, in a somnolent
condition watching the humid disin-
tegration of the mess dug-out when
there was a rushing through the air
from above, and a noise like someone
lifting the plug of an enormous bath,
to us, by stealing all the
material sent to adjacent
companies, battalions and
brigades, by devastating
farmhouses and ºf
bare all the R.E. material
dumps within two miles of
the line, we made that S
sodden chaos of shell craters
into a recognisable trench. É
Finally, when it had stood
two nights' rain without
disappearing, the O.C. com-
pany was just indenting
for a D.S.O. with two
clasps, when an order
arrived saying, with the
brief ambiguity natural to
all military orders, that the
two platoons holding S 245
would proceed to take over
S 246.
Having satisfied himself
that this involved the de-
sertion of S 245 he laughed
sardonically, ground his
teeth, ordered the bearer of
the message to be shot at
midnight (if the Q.M. had
sent up enough candles),
and went to look at S 246.
S 246 was just what S 245
had been, only, of course,
One Worse.
We got to work on it;
but then a new factor su-
pervened. All available
material had already been
put into S 245, so we wired
for more stuff for revet-
Mr. Johnkins (who has overslept himself). “HA, THE ZEPPELINs AT
LAST! WELL, I'M GLAD I INSISTED on EVERYon E SLEEPING IN THE
BASEMENT.”
noon 2 " I admitted I had heard some
explosions. Next I met O.C. left com-
pany (mine was centre). “It's extra-
ordinary,” he said, “that our guns
can't get straight on to a thing like
that. The beggar was dropping them
practically into my dug-out from half-
past two to half-past four.” I was
duly scandalized and sympathetic.
Later on I learned that the mortar had
nearly (but not quite) massacred two
passing generals and practically (but
nº quite) wrecked head-
quarters; and eventually
mine was the only sector
for some miles round which
did not report heavy bomb-
|ardment. I had originally
thought out a rather effec-
tive little brochure about it
|all, but, with everyone else
suffering so, it seemed up
to us to keep our own woes
dark. But it was a rare
lesson in the human instinct
of borrowing trouble be-
cause mourning suits you.
Atkins is really best when
an ordinary mortal might
be contemplating suicide or
= desertion. From a mile
behind our line runs a
communication trench
named Muddy Lane. In
parts it is excellent. In
parts you go in, during
rainy weather, up to your
middle. One night, after it
had been pouring for some
weeks, a fatigue staggered
up this appalling swamp,
carrying out-size hurdles
weighing about eight hun-
dred-weight apiece, brought
from a good two miles back.
As they arrived in the fire
trench, grunting and sweat-
ing and looking — if one
could have seen them—like
a wet landslide, the last but
one turned to the last man
and observed reflectively, “I

ments. To this we got the answer, “Use
material from S 245, which is now to
be scrapped.” Having used this we
wired for material for dug-outs. There
was none available through the ordin-
ary channels, but we were referred to
S 245. We did what we could.
Then arose the urgent question of
heating. This time we did not wait to
wire. We dug into the shattered and
dishevelled ruins of S 245 and brought
up every fragment of woodwork that
had been therein sunk since the War
began, and used it in the braziers of
S 246 to the last fibre.
Having taken this rash step we had
no right to be shocked at the order that
followed by another like Vesuvius ex-
ploding bodily. I went outside when
the lava had stopped coming down and
found that a trench mortar had dropped
a young mine about the size of a hotel
three yards off the dug-out. At least I
will swear it wasn't as much as thirty.
I spent the rest of the afternoon with
the signallers, cajoling a battery into
some warlike act, while twenty-three
further devils descended within a few
yards of the first.
After “Stand to,” came along the
O.C. right company.
“Do you know,” he said, “that con-
founded trench mortar was plugging
'em in just behind our mess all the after-
wonder now, Bill, wot made them call
this 'ere Muddy Lane?”
From a list of papers read at the
Royal Society:—
“The Bird's Heart. Communicated by
Prof. E. H. Starling, F.R.S.”
He should know all about it.
“The State of Kansas had for 30 years had
the benefit of prohibition, and there the death-
rate (73d. per 1000) was the lowest of any
place on the face of the civilised globe.”

This accounts, of course, for the small
change in the population.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LETTER FROM GRETCHEN.
Berlin.
DEAREST ELSA, We are very gay
and brilliant here—opera, theatres,
dinners and dances, and flags fluttering
and bells ringing constantly for some
new triumph. The last occasion was
two days ago, when we were told the
glorious news that our brave troops
are at Calais and have fired great guns
across the Channel and reduced Dover
to a little heap of rubbish, as it well
deserves. -
Our dear KAISER often pays a brief
visit to the Schloss. He is so busy,
my Elsa, so busy preparing for the
wonderful times that are coming when
our triumph is complete. Our Princes
are all going to be Kings, and our great
KAISER has not only arranged about
their kingdoms but has found time
even to design their crowns, and also
a new, splendid, very large crown for
himself when he shall take his new
title, Emperor of Everywhere. That
wretched Britain is to be broken up
into three kingdoms again; and besides
these there will be many kingdoms to
be given away. When all our Princes
are provided for, our adored voN HINDEN-
BURG and our brave voN MACKENSEN
will each be King of somewhere; our
voN TIRPitz was also to have been a
King, but there has been a little altera-
tion of plans lately, and he will perhaps
be only a Viceroy.
Ach, liebe Freundin' How my heart
swells with pride and joy to think I
am a German girl' I give a little
“Hoch Hoch ' " all to myself some-
times. I had the honour and happiness
to meet one of our Princes at a recep-
tion the other night. You will guess
which of them it was when I tell you
that at first he graciously refused to
dance, and sat on a couch, making
comments on the dancers and laughing
—laughing so loud in his own charm-
ing way; and then he jumped up,
snatched me from my partner (me 1
your Gretchen), and said I was the
only pretty girl in the room and
danced with me himself. He said many
gallant things to me, and I ventured
to ask him by what title we shall
know him when the War is over. He
laughed very loud and said, “If I'm a
good boy Father will give me Russia,
but if I'm a bad boy he'll only give
me Scotland or Ireland ’’; and he
laughed louder than ever and whirled
me so fast that, proud and happy as I
felt, meine Theure, I was not quite
sorry when the dance was over.
The Dowager Freiſrau von Bundel-
bosch has been in great trouble. Her
youngest son, the Hauptmann Karl, of
the Prussian Guards, is a prisoner in
barbarous Dngland, and she heard that
he was made to go on all fours and
draw a great wagon full of stones all
day, and was beaten with sticks | The
Freifrau was like a mad woman, her
big fists clenched and her eyes glaring
(even we, her relations, dared not go
near her), and she drove to the Schloss
and threw herself on her knees and tore
her transformation and her mantelchen,
and cried, “Majesty, is it to be borne
that a von Bundelbosch is to be turned
into a dray-horse and beaten with,
sticks?” Our noble KAISER promised
to see to it, but that very day a letter
came from the Hauptmann Karl. He
wrote from a place called Bonnington
Hall, and told his Mütterchen that he
is well, has enough to eat, a good bed,
a servant to wait on him, a piano to
play (so that he can accompany himself
when he sings the “Hymn of Hate”),
billiards and tennis, and a large park
to walk in. But he complains bitterly
that he has nothing to do, that he is
getting fat, that he is bored, and that
they give him beef and mutton in spite
of his demands for pork | Cruel bar-
barous islanders' It makes one's blood
boil to think that they look on while
an officer of the Prussian Guard loses
his beautiful waist and suffers bore-
dom and that they give him beef and
mutton when he loves pork better!
But the Hauptmann Karl will be
avenged soon.
My Sigismund came to Berlin on
leave two days ago. He looks well
and handsome, and has won an Iron
Cross (I am particularly glad of this,
as otherwise he would have been the
only man in Berlin without one). He
tells me we can crush our enemies and
end the War any day we please. I said,
“Then why not do it at once, my
Sigismund 2 " But he says there are
good reasons of a private nature for
not doing it quite at once.
He hurt me a little by looking me
over and saying, “Girl of my heart,
you have become a dowdy. Gott in
Himmel ! What a costume, and what
a hat l” I said, “You do not speak
like a kind betrothed or like a good
German, my Mündchen, and you even
come near to speaking lése-majesté. All
foreign modes are now verboten. These
are our German autumn fashions, de-
signed, even to the hats and boots, by
our noble KAISER himself!”
My Grossmütterchen, the Gräfin von
Dumpfendorf - Mumpenberg, gave a
little tanzfest for Sigismund and me.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A LITTLE while ago I remember writing that each of the
war-books now jostling one another from the Press had
its individual and special excellence. That of Between the
Lines (SMITH, ELDER) I should set down as realisation for
the stay-at-home of actual fighting under modern conditions.
Many of the other war chroniclers deal only sparingly with
the absolute killing and being killed that are at the heart of
the whole hideous business. Not so the writer who calls
himself Boyd CABLE, and who (as he tells us in his Preface)
has composed this book, all of it, within sound of the
German guns and for the most part within shell and rifle
range. His especial aim has been to explain “what lies
behind and goes to the making of these curt and vague
terms in the war communiqués.” To this end many of
his chapters (which you may remember in The Cornhill or
The Westminster) are headed by one of those phrases which,
though use has now made them familiar, remain mysterious
to us who only see the War through reports darkly.
*Artillery Support,” “Advanced Trenches,” “Nothing to
Report”—these are the words that he has translated into
pictures so vivid that at times the roar and reek, the whole
terrific nerve-wracking tension of trench-warfare seems to
leap out at you from the pages. It is a terrible and thrilling
glossary that will be read and re-read in countless homes.
One chapter especially, called “The Mine,” is really a short
war-story of which any writer in Europe might be proud;

I have myself read it three times with increasing admira-
tion. For this alone Between the Lines would be a book
that no one should miss.
The Princess CATHERINE RADziwiLL has written, Messrs.
CASSELL have published, and I have read Sovereigns and
Statesmen of Europe, a stalwart book illustrated with eight
photogravures and priced at 10s. 6d. net. Of these three
achievements mine is, perhaps, the most noteworthy, for in
regard to style and interest it must be said that the book
does but little to help the reader who comes to it with a
desire to be initiated into the mazes and mysteries of
European diplomacy and to learn the qualities of those
who have lately directed it to such calamitous issues. For
instance, it does not carry me any further in my know-
ledge of Russia to be told that M. Kokovtsov “has an
exaggerated idea of his facility in speaking foreign languages
—a trait which is noticeable among other middle-class
people whose early surroundings did not entitle them to
the right of expressing themselves in any other idiom than
their own. It is the saddest part of M. Kokovtsov that he
is middle-class, in spite of all his efforts not to appear so."
Again in the pages devoted to M. VIVIANI we learn that a
certain lady said of him that he would go far because the
first time I saw him he was still eating with his knife,
whilst yesterday he did not even attempt to do so with his
fish-knife.” This unexpected remark is said by the Princess
to have delighted all in the room, and she adds that “this
paradox had a deep meaning.” All I can say is that it is

not my idea of a paradox, but then possibly I am too
middle-class to appreciate all the sacred things that are
involved in the due employment of a fish-knife. Of our
own KING the Princess is good enough to say that “he has
shown himself a faithful servant of his country, watching
over her interests, and trying to lead her on the path of
prosperity and greatness.” The book is full of these
lightning flashes of insight and epigram.
It has often been my privilege to suggest that you
should read such and such a book; now here is one, The
Queen's Net (Hodder AND Stoughton) that I wish to urge
you in the strongest terms not only to read, but to buy.
And this for two reasons. First because you will thus be
helping one of the most - - - - - - -
practical and deserving
works that this time of
crisis has called into
action; secondly, because
you will at the same time
give yourself a great deal
of pleasure. For this
book, which Mr. HAROLD
BEGBIE has written about
the “Queen's Work for
Women Fund,” and cer-
tain persons who have
been helped by it, is em-
phatically not one that
needs the cloak of charity
to cover its artistic sins.
It has a value of its own,
apart from its object, as
being supremely well
written, with that highest
art” that eliminates the
writer altogether, and
leaves the reader face to
face with the persons
described, as living reali-
ties. And how they live,
and the strangeness of
the stories they tell !

gently-born women in these last terrible days. Unex-
pectedly, perhaps, there never was a more heartening
book, one more full of kindness and courage, and even
heroic laughter. The persons of whom it treats are all
—with perhaps one odd exception—at the present moment
entirely happy people; the horror from which they have
been gently lifted, and wherein others are still struggling,
is the background against which they stand out in cheer-
ful contrast. There is, I hope, no need to speak now of
the aims and achievements of the noble and chivalrous
scheme which The Queen's Net has been written to help.
Buy the book for yourself, read it, as you will, between
laughter and tears, and you will understand what work it
is to which our Greatest Lady has given her name and
energy. -

has been stated I feel that your hands are already feelin
for the three shillings which are asked of you for the help
of so humane a cause. Incidentally you will also be doing
a good turn to yourself, for this book is no medley collected
in haste and pushed between attractive covers, but a volume
that contains excellent work by both authors and artists.
Mr. H. G. WELLs, for instance, has contributed a tale that
no admirer of his ought to miss, and Mr. HUGH THoMSoN's
frontispiece is a delightful example of his delicate manner.

or almost blank. No check to our charitable impulses can

sense of tragedy in the

work which is being so
wonderfully done—as Mr.

student of the work of
Mr. George Moon. you
are no doubt already
familiar with that one of
his early stories which

the title of A Drama in

now been republished
under the name of Muslin
(HEINEMANN). The change
is to be commended, as
there is certainly more
muslin than drama about
the tale; one might even
— add, in captious mood, that
the muslin is of no special quality. For the rest the book
remains a comedy of Irish manners in the early eighties;
rather more than a little sordid in theme (was Dublin society
of those days so frankly husband-hunting?), but engagingly
youthful both in its manner and outlook. There is youth
º
|
- |
even in the attempts to outrage the sensibilities of the
libraries. Daring for daring's sake was still a big adventure
in those days; it has become commonplace now. Fortun-
ately the maturer Mr. MooRE has been so kind, in a new
preface, as to give the reviewer of Muslin a friendly lead.
“A comedy novel, written with sprightliness and wit,” is
what he thinks of it. Elsewhere he notices that the theme
is very much that of A Doll's House (which I should not
have thought myself), and concludes a sympathetic notice
of his own heroine with the pronouncement that she “gives
me much the same kind of pleasure as a good drawing.”
And, as I suppose Mr. MooRE ought to know, I will con-
tent myself with passing on to you his verdict. Personally
I shall continue to like other work of his a great deal better
than this rather thin and faded chiffon.

artist, and the Neue Freie Presse, in
describing the picture, says, “The face,

In reply to representations made by
the Roman Catholics of Germany on

An unnecessarily gloomy view of the

“The money will be fully returned to
us some day; but that, except we are
very young, will only be after we have
been a long time dead.” Our Scottish

this friendly intervention half-a-

It is lèse-majesté in Germany to

CHANCELLOR is said to have re-

“which, unfortunately, you cele-
brate for the second time in this

In connection with the recent
changes in the Austrian Ministry
it is stated that the Austrian Par-

SIR,--It has rather been my custom to criticise Kings
and Emperors in the columns of my paper than to address
them directly by means of a letter. Indeed, I have shrunk
from allowing my name to be mixed up with those who in
this age appear to me to be phantasms of the world-brain
called up into what is only a semblance of existence, having
no substance and no relation to reality. Still, even these
shadowy appearances that flit across the face of things
have their influence. One must reckon with them in a
world which is often ruled by shadows; and thus it comes
that I, who am but a hardworking publicist, earning my
daily bread by the labour of my pen, address myself to you,
the high and mighty KAISER, whose nod is supposed to
shake the spheres and whose liſted hand shatters kingdoms
into ruins.
For yourself as a man I may say that I have no vener-
ation. You are the chief of the gloomiest and coarsest
Court in Europe. No attempt that has been made to
lighten the darkness and to mitigate the harshness of that
Court has had more than a momentary success. Now and
then a young and gay-hearted princess might appear and
shine for an instant, but she was immediately drawn down
into the vortex and, to all intents and purposes, she dis-
appeared. It would have needed something more than
youth and smiles and innocent gaiety to resist the oppres-
sion of the combined sabre-clanking and hard pietistic
influences to which the new-comer was exposed from the
time of her entrance into this dreadful circle. And so it
has come about that there has been no check—none, at any
rate, that in the least availed—on your own baffling and
impulsive personality. At one moment you would pose as
the War-Lord, fierce and be-starred and be-helmeted; at
another you would show yourself as the glorified huck-
ster of world-power, intent on gaining by commercialism
all that your heavy diplomacy might fail to accomplish;
and then, hey—presto! you would change again and would
invoke in sanctimonious accents a tribal god whom, with
the aid of the narrowest and most primitive Hebraism, you
had invented as joint guardian with your own exalted self
of the traditions of the house of Hohenzollern.
And now the natural result of all this feverish striving
and all this posturing has happened, and we Germans are
at war. For sixteen months we have been at war, and the
end is not yet. On all sides money and blood are poured
out like water. We are determined to achieve victory, but
our foes too are stubborn and are resolved at whatever
cost to bring us to the ground. So the fighting and the
deaths and the sufferings continue and desolation threatens
the world. And in the midst of this unexampled welter, in
which our earth seems to be returning to chaos, are heard
faintly, but with increasing distinctness, the voices (some
of them German) of those who ask for peace before
universal ruin is utterly accomplished. As to this it is
right that we should not deceive ourselves by indulging
in a hope that nations whom we have attacked are, any of
them, in the mood to lay down their arms or to cease from
defending themselves and from attacking us. By our own
acts we have closed the avenues that might lead to peace.
If we hint that peace is now possible our enemies retort
upon us the destruction of Louvain, the shattering of
Belgium, the sinking of the Lusitania, what they call the
foul murder of Nurse CAVELL–in a word, all those acts
which we have performed with the justifiable intention of
producing terror and thus of shortening the War and
which are now seen to recoil upon us and to lengthen the
period of our sufferings. It is bad for a nation to become
a victim to sentimentalism, but there are different kinds of
sentimentalism, and perhaps the worst and most dangerous
kind is the anti-sentimentalism of the more brutal kind of
soldiers who see nothing but guns and shells and bayonets
and armies, and forget that their acts may rouse a spirit
against which the most powerful armaments cannot in the
long run prevail. -- - -

THE PHILOSOPHY OF THOMAS.
IN Summer we suffered from dust an' from flies,
The flies in our rations, the dust in our eyes,
An' some of our fellows they drooped in the 'eat,
But the Bosch, oh, the Bosch, was perspirin' a treat!
There were times when we longed for a tankard o'beer,
Bein' sick o' warm water—our tipple out 'ere,
But our tongues might be furry an' throats like a flue,
Yet it's nothin' to wot the fat Bosches went through.
Now Winter is 'ere with the wet an' the cold,
An' our rifles an' kit are a sight to be'old,
An' in trenches that's flooded we tumble an' splosh,
“Wot cheer 2" we remarks. “It's the same for the
Bosch.” -
If we're standin' in two foot o' water, you see,
Quite likely the Bosches are standin' in three ;
An' though the keen frost may be ticklin' our toes,
'Oo doubts that the Bosches' 'ole bodies is froze 2
Are we sleepy or sick or 'arf dead for a meal?
Just think of 'ow underfed Bosches must feel !
Are we badly in need of a shave an' a wash 2
Consider the 'orrible state o' the Bosch
So 'ere 's our philosophy simple an' plain:
Wotever we 'ates in the bloomin' campaign,
'Tis balm to our souls, as we grumble an' cuss,
To feel that the Bosches are 'atin' it wuss.

Chauffeur. “I AM soft Rx To say, SIR, EACH of THE LAST Two GENTLEMEN I HAVE BEEN witH DIED IN My SERVICE.”
THE NEW WIVISECTION.
FEw recent books have been more
piquantly promising than the collection
of portraits of Sir RABINDRANATH TAG-
orE, by Mr. RothBNSTEIN, with a com-
mentary by Mr. MAx BEERBoHM. That
MAx, the peculiarly Occidental quiz and
delineator of the foibles of London's
artistic and literary butterflies, should
devote himself to the appreciation of
the famous Indian mystic is considered
to have as many elements of, let us say,
surprise as often get mixed together
between two covers.
This book, however, odd as it may
be, does not stand alone. Other artists
and critics have also been at work on
similar collaborations, and we are able
to some extent to outline their activities.
As to the series of portrait studies
of Lord NorthcLIFFE by Herr RAE-
MAEKERs, with descriptive text by Sir
JoHN SIMON, no information has yet
reached us; and we are similarly to seek
as to the more juicy particulars of a
luscious septet of presentments in colour
of Mr. SELFRIDGE by Mr. JoHN HASSALL,
with joint appraisement by Madame
DU BoccAGE and CALLISTHENEs; nor
have we had any opportunity yet to
examine the twelve versions of the
fascinating but little-known physiog-
nomy of the Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL by
Mr. AUGUSTU's JoHN, with analytical
letter-press by Mr. W. W. JAcobs,
which is so eagerly awaited by the
cognoscenti.
We have, however, been favoured
with advance proofs of the ten views of
the more prominent facial peculiarities
of Lord HALDANE by Mr. SARGENT,
with a eulogy by Mr. Roger FRY, and
we can wholeheartedly recommend this
77107°Ceatl.
Mr. FRY's absorbing excursus is
largely devoted to a comparison be-
tween Lord HALDANE's visage as it now
is and what it might be had it been
designed by an artist of pronounced
futurist or even vorticist tendencies.
In a scholarly aside on the superiority
of the Cyclopean ideal of beauty over
that commonly admired to-day, the
essayist rises to lyrical heights. He
shows us the Cyclops in all his savage
charm, with one eye in the middle of
his forehead, and then proves clearly
that the precision and philosophic calm
of Lord HALDANE's character made
it imperative that he should have
two eyes, each in the usual place on
either side of the nose, no matter what
the sacrifice in aesthetic rapture.
We prophesy an immense success for
this extraordinary book.
A PARDONABLE ERROR.

But when I neared the youth and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CHAT WITH SCYLLA AND
CHARYBDIS.
I AM an uncle. I don't say it in any
boasting spirit, but simply to show you
that I have a stake in the country. I
found my nieces the other evening in
the nursery.
Lillah, looking distressingly bored,
was lying face downwards on the floor.
Phyllis was putting the hands of the
clock back, lest, as the ancients had it,
bed-time anticipate her.
My arrival was not the signal for a
furore.
“Here's Uncle James,” said Lillah,
without emotion, while Phyllis said
nothing at all.
Luckily I knew the way to rouse
them.
“Good evening, babies,” I said.
When the uproar had died down they
decided that I might be of some use.
“Tell us about the War,” said Lillah.
“Yes,” echoed Phyllis.
“The War,” I began, “is a very
terrible thing.”
“That's what Mummie says,” said
Phyllis with an air of reproach.
I apologised for having pilfered some-
one else's mot.
“And Daddy says,” added Lillah,
with obvious effort, “it’s a disgrace to
silly visation.”
“And he says, damme, he wishes he
was a bit younger,” said Phyllis with
immense gravity.
“Daddy says,” Lillah went on, “that
we are fighting for the flag. Are we?”
“Certainly,” I answered.
“Do the Germans want our flag?”
“They want everything.”
“Why couldn't we give them one
like it?” asked Phyllis with deadly
COIn non-Sense.
“Because they can't even keep their
own clean,” said I. -
“They could send it to the wash,”
pondered Lillah.
“They will have to,” I answered
grimly.
“Daddy says we are fighting for
silly visation too. Are we?”
“Your father,” I said, “is always
right.”
“I know,” said Phyllis gravely.
wanted to see if you knew.”
“Your Uncle also,” I said with
hauteur, “is seldom wrong.”
There was a ponderous silence.
“Mummie told Daddy,” said Lillah,
“that you weren't ever very bright.”
“Oh, indeed!” said I. I shall say a

few hard words to Margaret about that
—putting ideas into the children's
heads.
“And when we've won,” said Phyllis,
“will we have silly visation ?”
“I hope so.”
“What will it be like—a fairy-tale?”
“Very probably.”
“Daddy says it's freedom. What's
freedom ?
“Freedom,” I said “is—er—being
able to do what you like.”
“Then won't there be any policemen
after the War?”
“Oh yes, we shall keep the police-
men.”
“Why?"
“Because the streets would look so
bare without them.”
They looked at me with suspicion;
even at that tender age they could not
believe in an aesthetic ratepayer.
“Do people like the War?” said
Phyllis.
“No,” I answered. That was easy.
“Not even the Germans ?”
“I think not.”
“But if nobody made the big guns
there wouldn't be any war 2"
“Er—no,” I said.
“Then why do people—?'
“Well–er ” I stopped. I could
see that my last rags of reputation for
brightness were going. I was in the
Uncle's last ditch.
“When you are older,”
I began ;
..but Lillah interrupted.
“And why don't policemen take the
people who make the guns?” It was
Phyllis's shot.
“And if nobody wants the War what
makes it go on ?”
“And if it's a disgrace,” queried
Lillah, “why does Daddy want to
go?”
“And why,” began Phyllis; but I
put up my hand.
“One day,” I said, “I must tell you
the story of Socrates, who had to drink
a very nasty medicine called hemlock.”
“What for 2 ” said Lillah.
“For asking too many questions,”
I said.
“Were the people who gave it to
him the people who didn't know the
answers ?" said Lillah.
“Yes, they were,” I said, as I rose.
I took out my watch.
“Good heavens, it's after bedtime !”
“Does your watch say right?” said
Phyllis.
“It sometimes underestimates, but
it never exaggerates,” I said. At that
moment Daddy himself appeared.
“Good-night chicks,” he said. “Has
Uncle James been amusing you?”
“We've been playing with him,”
said Lillah with gravity.
And if ever there was a double
entendre I'll swear it was there. And
so they went to bed.
“I don't know,” I said to George as
we went downstairs, “why you called
your daughters Lillah and Phyllis; their
real names are Scylla and Charybdis.”
But George is a dull man, and simply
said that Charybdis Watson would
have sounded ridiculous.

“CoME ALONG, slacKER, or I'LL PUT LORD DERBY ON To You !”
THE UBIQUITOUS SCOT.
WE learn from The Daily Chronicle
that Mr. Richard Northcott has com-
piled and privately printed some notes
on the life and operas of DoNIZETTI,
which establish the interesting fact
that the composer's grandfather was
one DoNALD Izett, a native of Perth-
shire, who went to Italy, when the
name became “Donizetti.”
GRIEG's Scottish origin – his for-
bears spelt it Greig–is already well
known, but several other famous Italian
musicians and poets also hailed from
beyond the Tweed. Thus recent genea-
logical researches have revealed the
interesting fact that BELLINI assumed
that name as a tribute to the memory
of his grandmother, who was born at
Peebles, and whose maiden name was
Belle Leney. VERDI's grandfather,
who was out in the '15 as a Jacobite
and took refuge as an exile in Italy,
was a certain McIverdy, which was
abbreviated in the next generation to
the name associated with so many
masterpieces of the lyric stage.
MASCAGNI, the composer of “Cavall-
eria Rusticana,” had for his great-grand-
father a native of Drumnadrochit, who
rejoiced in the patronymic of MacSandy.
He emigrated to Florence to spread the
cult of the bagpipes and soon adapted
his surname to the euphonious form
with which we are now familiar.
MAscAGNI's great rival, LEONCAvALLo,
is, if not a pure Scotchman, at any
rate a Scotch derivative. His father, a
sturdy denizen of the Trossachs, who
would be astonished could he but know
of his son's musical genius, for he was at
his best but a poor performer upon the
pipes, was a prosperous crofter named
Steed—Donald Steed. Greatly addicted
to SHAKSPEARE, and especially Macbeth,
his favourite saying was, “Lay on, Mac-
duff"—so much so that his friends
came to speak of him as “Lay on ”
Steed. When, later, his son moved on
to Italy, in the inveterate Scotch way
of getting farther and farther away
from the native heath, he retained the
affectionate and humorous preface by
which the old man had been known,
but gave the “Steed" its Italian equi-
valent—thus producing Leoncavallo, an
interesting example of the evolution of
a mom de pays.
It seems that two of the greatest
Italian poets were also of Scots extrac-
tion, DANTE being a descendant of a
Dundee jute merchant named Alec
Gair, which on his becoming a resident
in Florence was soon Italianized into
ALIGHIERI; while PETRARCH's name is
merely a condensed form of the Chris-
|tian name and first syllable of the sur-
name of his father, Peter Archibald, a
| Scots soldier of fortune who first saw
the light at Inverness.
Among modern Italian writers Scot-
land also holds her own. Signor D'AN-
NUNzio, before he emigrated to Italy,
was a young Aberdonian named Daniel
McTavish, famous for a thousand fire-
brand tricks. Indeed, so great was
his fame that he was known as Dan
Nonesuch, and, on arriving in the new
style which we all know—D'ANNUNzio.
The list might be indefinitely ex-
tended, but we may content ourselves
by observing that Italy is not alone in
her indebtedness to Scotland. The
name of the great Trojan hero, HECTOR,
clearly points to a Caledonian ancestor,
and the imitation of Edinburgh which
the eye of every intelligent tourist.
A Snub for Posterity.
Extract from a letter signed “Nation-
alist " in The Irish Times:—
“Every eligible Irishman who emigrates,
turns, whether or not he realizes it, a deaf ear
to the cry for protection of unborn generations
is furnished by the Acropolis leaps to
land of his adoption, he quickly Italian-
ized this nickname into the world-wide
|
of Irishmen and Irishwomen.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, Novem-
ber 30th.-Such a storm in a teapot!
HoME SECRETARY, under misapprehen-
sion, made inaccurate allegation against
The Times. Wrote immediately to that
paper admitting his mistake and apolo-
|gising. There, it might seem, matter
would end. Those who anticipated
such ordinary commonplace result
don't know their Times. Here was
opportunity for not only damaging a
Minister but of securing bold
advertisement far beyond possi-
bilities of posters on the wall
or displayed announcements in
columns of contemporaries.
Times accordingly daily ham-
mered away at HoME SECRETARY,
accusing him not only of malver-
sation of fact but of disingenuous-
ness and dishonesty in attempts
to exonerate himself.
In such circumstances HoME
SECRETARY's best friend might
have whispered in his ear MEL-
BourNE's famous inquiry, “Wh
can't you leave it alone 2 " If
advice given certainly not ac-
cepted. Questions over, HoME 6
SECRETARY interposed with re-
joinder that occupied more than
a full hour's delivery.
Indiscretion contagious. Lord

a word about my own position.”
Impetuous MARKHAM created di-
version by dragging on the scene
MASTERMAN, of whom no one

Hoxie SECRETARY, meeting a
private Member in luncheon
room on day fateful question was
raised, concocted a little plot.
Jones (of Merthyr), the private
Member referred to, declared there
wasn't a word of truth in the narrative.
“Dear me,” said the MEMBER For
SARK, looking up at clock pointing to
hour at which adjournment must
necessarily take place, “haven't I
heard something about the country
being engaged in greatest war ever
waged since battles began 2 Isn't there
something said about Serbia being
wiped out under feet of Germany as
was Belgium a year ago? Isn't there
fighting in Flanders, peril in the
East, decimation of dauntless heroes at
the Dardanelles? What's this in to-
day's Roll of Honour — killed and
wounded 36 officers and 968 men 2
And here's the House of Commons
spending a whole sitting in wrangling
over personal questions.”
As matter of fact the whole sitting,
full seven hours long, was not sufficient
for high purpose to which it was de-
voted. Standing Order provides that,
with specially decreed exceptions, pro-
ceedings may not continue beyond
eleven o'clock. Accordingly debate
raised by HoME SECRETARY stands on
journals of House as “Adjourned.”
Business done. — None. STANTON

cheered from both sides. His victory
regarded as pledge from unexpected

His assurance that a certain matter
brought to his notice is receiving his
most careful consideration wards off a
multitude of inconvenient inquiries.
To-day struck out a new phrase.
Pressed to say whether if Parliament
be adjourned before result of Lord
DERBY's Recruiting Scheme is an-
nounced it will forth with be summoned
to consider the situation when the
scheme is submitted.
“I can say no more,” he gravely
remarked, “than if and when the
occasion contemplated by the Hon.
Member arises it will be for the
Government to take such steps as they
may consider suitable.”
Whilst the Hon. Member was framing

the Paper called by the SPEAKER, and

LONG read a second time.
Thursday.—Interesting to observe
how marked characteristics of a nation
survive through the ages. More than
a century ago CANNING, dropping into
poetry, wrote:–
“In matters of commerce the fault of
the Dutch
Is giving too little and asking too
much.”
In course of important debate
on export of goods to neutral
countries, a topic that attracted
audience of twenty-nine Members,
shown to-day that Holland is
taking far too much in the way
of linseed-oil and giving extremely
little in way of explanation as
to what eventually becomes of it.
In first nine months of present
year excess of export to Holland
over similar periods before the War
amounts to 29,000 tons. Shrewd
suspicion that, in breach of inter-
national law, this surplus is re-
exported to Germany, where it is
found equal to supply starving
population with material for
2,000 tons of margarine a week.
BIGLAND threw fresh light on
problem of continuance of War.
“If,” he said, speaking as one
having authority, “we could pre-
vent Germany from importing oil
and fat the War would be over in
seven months.”

THE LUCK OF THE LIGHTHOUSE.
Crossley is an old friend of mine—
we were at the same public school,
where he went by the name of “Kinks"
—but we hardly ever meet without
argufying. He is quite sound about
the War, the need of crushing Prus-
sian militarism and so forth, but he
has an unpleasant way of discount-
ing all claims on behalf of the Allies
to a greater humanity in the conduct
of the War. His favourite phrase is
“Six of one and half-a-dozen of the
other.” When I met him at the club
| last week his candour was at high-
water mark. When I quoted the latest
instance of German frightfulness, he
at once retorted, “Well, what about
Louis XIV. 2
“Louis XIV.,” I cautiously replied,
“flourished some two hundred and fifty
years ago. But he wasn't called the
‘Grand Monarque' for nothing.”
“Oh, indeed,” said Crossley. “Per-
haps you are not aware that he waged
war with the utmost barbarity against
the Dutch, the Austrians, and the
Prussians?”
Now a knowledge of the campaigns
of Louis XIV. is not my strong point,
but by a pure piece of good luck I had

a stone in my sling which I discharged
with great promptitude. Only a few
days before I had been looking at the
plates in Turner's Picturesque Views of
the Southern Coast, and had copied out
a passage from the letterpress accom-
panying TURNER's wonderful picture of
the Eddystone Lighthouse. “Did you
ever hear the story of Louis XIV. and
the Eddystone Lighthouse?” I asked.
“No,” said Crossley rudely, “nor yet
the story of WILLIAM THE CoNQUEROR
and the Crystal Palace; and I don't see
what on earth it has to do with the
question.”
“You don't 2 Very well then.” And
I produced and read my extract, which
runs as follows:—
“While the second Eddystone Light-
house was being erected under Mr.
Rudyard's superintendence, a circum-
stance took place which may be thought
to possess an interest that will justify
its insertion on the authority of Mr.
Smeaton. Louis XIV. being at war
with England during the erection of this
building, a French privateer took the
men at work upon the Eddystone Rock,
together with their tools, and carried
them to France, when the Captain ex-
pected a reward for his achievement.
While the captives lay in prison, the
transaction reached the ears of the
French Monarch, who immediately
ordered them to be released and the
captors to be put in their places, de-
claring that, though he was at war with
England, he was not so with mankind.
He therefore directed the men to be
sent back to their work with presents,
observing that the Eddystone Light-
house was so situated as to be of equal
use to all nations.”

at least a good egg in parts."

THE IMM IN ENT PROBLEM.
I shUT up the catalogue hopelessly
and put it on the table.
“As for me,” I said firmly, “I have
decided about my Christmas presents;
I shall give everybody putties.”
“You can't,” said Barbara; “remem-
ber what Aunt Alicia said when she
sent us the second-hand table-centre,
“It's not the gift, it is the spirit be-
hind it.’”
I frowned.
“If your Aunt Alicia knew the spirit
behind the eoffee-machine she got from
me last year—”
But Barbara cut me short.
“Your besetting sin,” she said, “is
laziness. What you ought to do is to
find out people's tastes—and then the
whole thing is perfectly simple.”
“Putting that into practice,” I re-
joined rather bitterly, “what do you
consider are the tastes of my nephew,
Richard Edward Keith ?”
“Poor little mite ' " said Barbara.
“Why, he's only eleven months old.”
“For all that,” I said, “his tastes
may be very pronounced, for all you
know. Bibs, for instance, may be like
the collars I have seen advertised,
which explain the wearer. ‘The bib
which proclaims the business baby,'
or ‘Smart gent's bib for the babe about
town.'”
Barbara sighed.
“Children are certainly difficult,”
she said.
“Then,” I went on, “there is Joan,
who I admit is getting on and will
never see five again; but she doesn't
seem to have developed any tastes.”
“Dolls,” murmured Barbara.
“Joan already has twenty-seven,” I
answered. “Of course, if you like to en-
courage large families amongst women
without independent means - ?
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Barbara.
“Well, there you are ' " I returned.
“Put your theory into practice, and
where are we?”
“I wasn't talking about babies,” said
Barbara.
“Considering,” I answered, “that
Christmas is a show run entirely for
babies of all ages, I don't consider that
you have the root of the matter in
rou.”
“Well,” she said, “adults can have
their tastes studied, anyway.”
“Do you think, Barbara,” I remarked
sternly, “that I am going to spend
December going round like a private
detective, spying on the little peculiari-
ties of my friends? “The innocent
conceits that like a needless eye-glass
or black patch give those who wear
them harmless happiness.' Do you
know who wrote that, Barbara 2"
Hosier (displaying latest invention in collar-pins). “KEEPs collar AND THE IN PERFECT
REPOSE, SIR. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL TO SMARTNESS OF APPEARANCE IN THE TRENCHES.”
“GEORGE ELIOT,” said Barbara
promptly.
“Bother,” I said; “I thought I
could plough you on that one; and it
isn't very helpful either, unless I give
Richard a monocle and Joan a powder-
puff.”
“If Providence was really provident,”
began Barbara slowly, “babies would
be labelled when they arrive.”
“You mean,” I said, “that it would
appear in The Times: ‘The wife of
Marmaduke George Bone of a stock-
broker.’”
“Something like that,” she said.
“Or,” I went on eagerly, ‘Of twins
—a married woman and a fine church-
warden.’ My dear Barbara, what a
splendid idea!”
“Of course,” said Barbara, “if it
turned out that it was going to be a
burglar or something—”
I waved the objection aside.
“Oh,” I said, “one would have to
have a conventional phrase for that.
People like the KAISER, for instance,
would just get: ‘The wife of F.
Hohenzollern, Esq., of a great, great
grief.' You see that would cover any-
thing in the nature of a failure.
“And it would simplify Christmas
amazingly,” I added, “white spats for
financiers, dolls' houses for married
women, and some assorted women's
movements for babies that were going
to grow up into spinsters.”
But meanwhile I don't know what to
give either to Richard or to Joan.

[DECEMBER 8, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE FRONT.
WE are enjoying a rest.
There can be no doubt about this,
because we have been told we are, on
very high authority.
When the British soldier has been
into trenches and out again, with an
occasional battle to break the monotony,
for a period of fifteen months he always
gets a rest.
To a rest two items are indispen-
sable:– -
1. Mud.
2. A nine-hours' day.
Only a few days ago we did not know
this. When they told us we were
going to be rested, though we did not
believe it for a moment, we imagined
that rest consisted in long hours of
sleep, warm comfortable billets, per-
haps a dinner or a matinee now and
again, and a few bright, brief and
brotherly parades.
Then we were sentenced to rest. We
marched deliberately out of a civilized
town to a soggy malodorous marsh,
where some war-weary A.S.C. driver
had got tired of the tents he was
carrying, and dropped them disgustedly
into a couple of feet of mud, hoping no
one would notice.
But no, the eagle eye of some red-
spangled controller of our destinies
spotted the jettison and said, “It's a
rest camp !”
And that is how we came to be where
We are.
There are no temptations. The mud
is not deep enough to drown oneself,
and no good soldier ever uses his rifle
or side-arm to commit suicide with.
For two days we lay in a condition
of bleak and comatose resignation,
while our complaints passed through
the usual official channels to the usual
official terminus. (Wicker, 2s. 6] d.)
On the third day we received our
programme. It provided for nine hours'
military training per diem—with inter-
vals for meals; for there was this
generosity in their justice—we were
not required to do the nine hours
straight off. This routine began at day-
light and ended at dusk.
In case any slacker should be cast
down by this prospect, the very Exalted
and Benevolent Person who had planned
the Rest visited us and assured us that
this was to be a complete vacation;
that the men were to be encouraged to
play football and hold sing-songs after
afternoon parade. Singing and football,
it appeared, would keep the men
thoroughly cheerful. The idea was, of
course, quite new to us. We asked
him how many hours after dusk he
would like the men to sing for; and
when he had gone away we indented
for luminous footballs. But we regret
to report that there have already been
several cases of men not singing either
on the line of march or during the
leisurely evening hours which should
be given over to harmless revelry.
Footballs of the required type, more-
over, have as yet not been forwarded
to us. - -
Fortunately, however, we have nu-
merous other healthy occupations in
our copious spare time.
busy by all sorts of red-hatted explorers
whosecuriosity goads them into visiting
the less wet parts of the Rest Camp,
and, after complaining that we have
allowed it to get into a disgraceful
condition, inquiring—(a) Why we do
not build huts?" (b) What is the ration
of candles and pepper per man? (c)
Why we do not take more care of the
men's health? (d) Why we mollycoddle
the men 2 and, lastly and most humor-
ously—(e) Whether we have any com-
plaints, and if we have why we have
not forwarded them to the Proper
Quarter?
It is stated, but unconfirmed, that
one of our newest subalterns met some
Commander-in-Chief or something the
other day and was asked by him in the
intervals of saluting what was the
extent of the field-ration; whereon he
replied, “Three ounces.” The General
clicked his teeth smartly and asked
the subaltern whether that was all he
knew about fuel; and the subaltern
said that in the trenches indeed the
men got two pounds and a half and in
billets four pounds, but in this deleted
spot it wouldn't run to more than three
ounces, and you had to steal that. As
the subaltern is still uncashiered these
exchanges may not be as reported.
The men surveyed their new home on
arrival in silent bewilderment. They
received the programme without com-
ment. It took two hours' tactical
training of five units to extract from
Private Thomas, who commonly speaks
the public mind, the observation, ad-
dressed to the four winds during an
“easy”: “And to think that there's
some as would spoil an 'eavenly 'oliday
like this 'ere with grousin'!”
THE WAR POEM.
THE Senior Watch-keeper sat at the
Ward Room table busily biting a pen-
holder as he stared at a sheet of fools-
cap.
“What's up?” asked the Paymaster.
“I've got an idea. It's a deuce of
an idea. Poem, you know. The sort
of thing to shake people up. Buck
up recruiting. Give people to think
furiously and all that sort of thing,”
replied the scribe.
We are kept ||
“Good on you,” said No. 1. “Want
any help ?”
“Yes, you can all lend a hand. You
see the idea of it is to show the
bounders at home the unity of the
enemy and their enthusiasm for war.
How they all think alike and their
singleness of purpose. The sort of
thing that soldier Johnnie did, the
sportsman who wrote about steam-
engines and things.”
“RUDYARD KIPLING,” hazarded the
“Pay.” -
“That's him,” said the poet. “I
want lots of names of German places
so as to show people what they are
y
doing all over the world. How's this
for a start—
“In Walfisch Bay I heard them say?”
“There's a real swing about that,”
said No. 1, “but it's not German.”
“What's not German 2''
“Walfisch Bay.”
“I don't see how I can alter that
line,” said the poet with firmness.
“Who’s to know I didn't hear
Germans talking there?”
“How would this do for a start"—
from the “Pay”—
“Across the bund at Swakopmund?”
“Who knows if they have a bund?”
objected the poet. “I must be accurate
to have any world-influence. Give us
some more good German names.”
“Dar es Salaam,” from No. 1.
“Rotten,” said the poet. “That's
Arabic, and no decent poem could fit it
in anywhere.”
“Well,” said the “Pay,” “here's
another start:-
“It fills my soul with mournful wonder
That Huns still walk the Apollo Bunder.”
The poet was inclined to doubt the
accuracy of this statement and also
rejected it as not within the immediate
scope of his endeavour.
“There are lots of Germans in
Shanghai,” interrupted the young
Doctor, “and in Hong Kong, the
Governor y?
The poet remarked with considerable
dignity that he was not starting a
Limerick competition. No doubt the
eccentricity of old gentlemen from
Peru or the levity of young ladies from
Balham might lend themselves to
humorous metrical treatment for the
amusement of callow medical students
in peace, but what lots of people didn't
yet realise was the fact that we were
at War.
I ventured to break the sticky silence
by politely asking, if he thought the
poem would take him long.
“Not if silly asses don't interrupt,"
he said. “When I once get started,
it'll come easy enough. It's all here,"
he added, tapping his forehead. “It'll

THE LAST CHANCE.
(A Romance d la mode.)
A GUSTY rollicking wind screamed
and whistled over the long white road
that curled like a ribbon on the bare
face of the moorland, buffeting and
swaying a man and a girl who struggled
against it. The man's eyes, hardened
to all weathers by long spells in the
trenches, swept keenly and searchingly,
almost fearfully, over the waste, as if
he were looking for something he feared
was not there, some help, perhaps,
some opportunity. His uniform and
his scars showed that he had faced his
country's enemies; but here, on an
English moor, he was palpably a prey
to nervousness. Tension and the con-
sciousness of approaching crisis were
written in the set of his jaw and on
every line of his lean sunburnt face;
at times the blood throbbed painfully
in his temples as a gust of hopelessness
swept over him, a suffocating dread
that this, his last afternoon of leave,
was to be irrevocably ruined, to remain
a memory to shrink from all his days.
Had he looked at his companion he
might have seen the questioning, sym-
pathetic, perhaps pleading expression
in her eyes; but his gaze seemed
riveted on the roadside.
And then suddenly, in a little hollow
beside the road, a mere furrow in the
heather, he flung himself on his knees
and looked towards her dumbly, be-
seechingly; and she stood above him, a
slender figure, her skirts spread round
him by the wind, and the face that she
bent towards him was anxious, pitying,
almost motherly. And then with
steady hand, albeit a trembling heart,
while she held her breath, he struck
his last match, and lit a pipe of
Benodoro tobacco; flushed and trium-
phant he rose, and she, cheeks aflame
and eyes shining with the glory of
desire satisfied, lit her Benodoro
cigarette at the glow. [ADvT.]

CONSTABULARY TACT.
WE emerge from the police-station
and fall into step together as we start
our beat.
“I can't spare time to go to the
police court this week,” says my com-
rade.
“Nor I; but it would be just
our luck if something turned up to-
night.”
“Well, we must be tactful.”
“That's it — courtesy and tact.
Unless there's a murder.” -
We are just exchanging the War
yarns of the day when a loud shouting
is heard from a side-street.
“I’m afraid that 's on our beat,” I
murmur. “Let's walk slowly so that
they can see us coming.”
Very majestically we march down,
making as much noise as possible; but
the row made by the combatants is so
great that they don't hear us.
Let me describe the military position.
The entrance to the fort—a small house
—is guarded by a lady in mysterious
white attire armed with a saucepan.
From the fact that she has bare feet I
judge that a night alarm has turned
out the guard. The slip of garden in
front is held by a gentleman simply
attired in a pair of trousers and braces.
The temperature is about 40. The
moral temperature a little above 212.
A stout lady leads the attacking party.
The garden gate is either jammed or
to get over the fence.
locked and she is making valiant efforts
Behind her a
gentleman, who combines in his attire
a frock-coat, carpet slippers, and a red
cricket cap, acts as support. A subtle
odour of beer pervades the air.
“Now then—now then—what's all
this?” we say genially but firmly.
The stout lady tumbles back from
the fence.
“She called my son a German
swine,” she says, pointing an accusing
finger at the lady in white, “and 'im
been twice wounded and once gassed."
One felt that the lady in white lacked
discrimination in abuse.
“I called 'er a German swine,” pro-
tests the lady in white.
“We got evidence ter prove it,” says
trousers plus braces. -
“You - called - my - son - a - German-
swine,” says Frock Coat with tre-
mendous emphasis. “I'm a Briton, I
am. I got British blood in me, and
when a man stands on my feet I let
'im 'ave it.”
“'Er,” says the stout lady—“I’ll
push her face in, I will.”
She makes another effort to scale
the fence.
“I’ve got evidence ter prove that she
called my son a German swine,” says
Frock Coat, tapping me confidentially
on the shoulder.
“’Oo stole the rent-book?” says the
lady in white, suddenly changing the
subject.
The stout lady, driven to fury by this
remark, tries to flop over the fence.
The moment for tact has arrived. I
take her and Frock Coat by the arms.
“I can't hear what you say because of
the wretched noise those people make.
Come up the street and tell me all
about it.” --
I walk up the street gripping the
stout lady firmly, for I feel that she is
the dangerous explosive. -
“Now, Mother,” I say, when she is -
at the corner, “why should a respect-
able lady like you lower herself to
speak to a woman like that?”
“Ah, you're a gentleman, you are.
You see 'er in 'er true colours at once.”
She begins a lurid biography of the
lady in white—who ought, I feel, to
have been dressed in red. Frock Coat
taps me on the shoulders after each
statement and says, “I got evidence ter
prove it.” -
“We was talking it over in bed,”
says the stout lady, “and it come over
me that I must get up and tell 'er what
she was. Calling a wounded 'ero a
German swine!”
“We got evidence ter prove it,” per-
sists Frock Coat.
“Well, Mother, suppose you go back
to bed. If you touch that woman and
she gives you in charge, I'll have to
run you in. Now it would pain me
awfully to run in a lady like you.”
“I'm a Briton,” says Frock Coat.

dence.”

I wait for my colleague. He comes
up radiating tact.
“What did you do with the others?”
“Oh, told them not to get mixed up
with a low lot like that. Now they're
safe in bed.”
“The other lady's going round to
smash their windows to-morrow.”
“That's all right,” says my unscru-
pulous colleague. “We’re not on duty

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
OBVIOUSLY at this time there is very little new to be said
about so established a classic as Sir SIDNEY LEE's Life of
Shakespeare. One can but give it the salute to which its
rank and record entitle it. The occasion of the salute is
its reappearance, revised and enlarged by the author, and
equipped by Messrs. SMITH, ELDER in the attractive bravery
of reset type. Since the first edition appeared in November,
1898, Shakespearean research has been both active and
fruitful; the resulting fresh knowledge, gained by Sir SIDNEY
himself or by the fellow-workers to whom his Preface
pays tribute, has been embodied in the present volume.
Especially is this the case with the documents that eluci-
date the stage-history of the Elizabethan era. There is
also a fund of highly interesting information derived by
the author while the volume was in course of preparation
from the archives at Stratford and from the wills at
Somerset House of SHAKESPEARE's Stratford friends. An
examination of them seems one of the things that one is
astonished to hear no one else had previously thought of
doing. Anyhow, here are the results, adding greatly to
the value of a book of which the publishers state their
belief that it “makes a direct personal appeal at this period
of British history to every reader of British nationality.”
And so say all of us ! Presumptuous as it may appear to
question the annexation policy of the official poetry depart-
ment at Berlin, the undeniable fact remains that, in spite
of all posthumous temptations, the author of Henry V.
remains an Englishman. So Sir SIDNEY LEE's reminder
of this comes, especially at the season of book-buying for
Christmas, at a timely hour.
Through a long cheerful life Lord REDESDALE has known
more of men and cities than did ULYsses. He has studied
both with keen eyes, and is happily gifted with a picturesque
style that presents his recollections in vivid form. He is old
enough to have seen Louis PHILIPPE strolling along the
terrace of the Tuilleries. He knew Countess CASTIGLIONE,
whose vaporous drapery, displayed at a ball at the Tuilleries,
shocked the EMPREss EUGENIE. He saw the funeral pro-
cession of the Duke of WELLINGTON and the fight between
HEENAN and SAYERs. He was at Eton in HAwTREY's time
and at Oxford in PUSEY's. He shot four buffaloes in the
Far West and played the cornet at the HANDEL Festival.
He was an intimate friend of KING EDWARD VII., to whose
memory he devotes an illuminating chapter. He knew
ABD EL KAEBER, the famous Arab chief who fought France
for years. He was intimate with RICHARD BURTON and looked
in upon BRIGHAM YoUNG at Salt Lake City. One of the most
charming of his personal recollections recalls a visit to GAR1-
BALDI at Capri. In a brief sentence he strikes the keynote
of the Liberator's character: “Simplicity combined with
great dignity.” He was on intimate terms with WHISTLER,
CARLYLE, RossETTI, FREDERICK LEIGHTON, DISRAELI, Lord
HENRY LENNox, Lord WolsFIEY and Lord RANDOLPH
CHURCHILL. Here is a marvellous, perhaps unique, portrait
gallery. Round it linger vivid Memories, which Messrs.
HUTCHINSON publish in two portly volumes. Temptation to

quote is hard to resist, but space in Mr. Punch's Booking
Office is limited. One quotation appreciated by the Young
Men seated to-day round the Old Mahogany Tree, under
whose shade F.C. B. for many years presided, must be given.
Writing of schoolmates at Eton Lord REDESDALE says: “I
must mention Sir FRANCIS BURNAND, who for so many years
led the merriment of the nation. Did I talk of memories 2
Here at least is no memory, but a Happy Thought, for
he still lives as gay, as bright, as laughter-loving and
laughter-compelling as when he was a Fourth Form Boy.
He remains the real Peter Pan, the boy who will never
grow old.” Of his many lifelike portraits the most attrac-
tive is that of the author himself. Undesignedly he makes
the reader acquainted with a light-hearted, straightforward,
resourceful man with a keen sense of humour. Of his
genial nature it suffices to say that, dealing with a multitude
of men over the space of 796 pages, he sharply criticises
only two. They are wider than Poles asunder. One was
Lord JoHN RUssell; the other—OscAR WILDE.
Mr. JEFFREY FARNOL, deserting the present age, from
while away a dull evening. In the matter of books of
reminiscences I am a little exacting. It is seldom that the
power of the human “I” is able to hold me. I turn away
and browse on fiction. But in Mr. CAPPER's bulky volume
there is an unaffected gaiety which made me feel, when I
came to the last page, as if I had been turned out of a cosy
club on a winter night after listening to the discursive
conversation of a man with a pleasant voice, a wide experi-
ence of men and cities, and a keen sense of humour. In his
capacity of Thought-reader Extraordinary to the civilised
world, Mr. CAPPER has been everywhere, met everybody,
and seen everything; and the cream of his memories is
contained in this book. Both as an entertainer and as a
collector of things worth remembering he has had unique
advantages, for his is a performance which appeals to
every class and nationality; and we have his wold for it
that he was just as big a success among the Tamil coolies
as at Marlborough House. Naturally, thirty years of this
sort of thing put a man in an excellent position as a
racomteur.
These are hard times, when ten-and-sixpence
think I can conscientiously
which he has already extracted
so many best-sellers, has now
turned his attention to the
fruitful fields of historical
romance. The accuracy of the
history of Beltane the Smith
(SAMPsoN Low) is a matter
that need not detain us; as for
the romance Mr. FARNOL's
countless admirers will not
need to be told that this is laid
on with no niggardly hand.
There are fights and escapes,
tortures and love-making to
satisfy the most exacting;
everything in short that the
public demands from its
costume-fiction Mr. FARNOL
sees that it gets in good
measure. Even the chapter-
headings begin with that
delightful adverb “How,” a
A TEMPORARY LAPSE.

pleasant trick that has thrilled me since I first met with
it in Windsor Castle. I need not conduct you through
all the tale of Bellane's adventures. There's lots and lots
of it; beginning with “How Beltane lived within the Green-
wood” (mark me that word “Greenwood!") and ending
with “How they came to Pentavalar City,” and “in the
moonlit dusk she gave her lips to his.” But of course
before this happened there was the villain, a right caitiff warlet
named Pertolepe the Red, to be overcome in fair fight, then
spared with that super-sportsmanship that always sways
the hero in the early chapters of books of this sort, then
to gain, as villains will, a temporary but terrific ascendency
and finally—but I must not discount the satisfaction of
that finally. In short a pleasant yarn of its not very un-
familiar kind; and if at times you feel that its wanderings
have not taken you further from Wardour Street than,
say, Soho Square, this but giveth a heartening sense of
security to the timorous. Beshrew me! Master FARNOL,
but so jocund a screed should be a-printing from now till
Candlemas. Marry come up !
I have not the pleasure of Mr. ALFRED CAPPER's
acquaintance, but, after reading his A Rambler's Recollec-
tions and Reflections (ALLEN AND UNWIN), I wish I had :
for the impression I get from that book is that he is an
extremely good sort and just the man to have by one to
recommend the investment of
that sum in Mr. CAPPER.

uncertainty it is good to be
able to count on something;
more particularly as in Lon-

MY MOUSTACHE.
Ev ERY day since my papers had gone in I had had a good
look at it, morning and evening. When I inclined my head
sideways some of it really seemed quite long and bushy;
but viewed full-face I must admit it looked somewhat
scanty. Still, although its growth was slow it was un-
doubtedly sure. I occasionally—about 465 times a day—
ran the tips of my fingers along it, and none of it rubbed
off. I had even pulled it with tweezers, and it had not
come out. I showed it to a few chosen friends, and after
one had said that nitrate of silver was good for removing
moles, and another had observed that all the best nigger-
minstrels invariably blacked their ears, too, and I had
ultimately explained what it was, they unanimously agreed
that it could never be taken for anything but a moustache,
though in the long-clothes stage. Hence I felt that by the
time I was due to report myself for duty to my C.O. it
would not disgrace me. -
And now I was actually en route for my battalion head-
quarters at Puddlecombe-on-the-Ooze. Before I had
lunched at the railway-station restaurant I had taken a
glance at myself in one of the many mirrors the establish-
ment possessed. My moustache was still there, but look-
ing a trifle wasted, I thought, and I began to wonder
whether I had moulted any of it on the way without
noticing it. However, after I had lunched (and I must own
that I did myself exceptionally well) I took a final look in
the glass, and to all appearances I was as well equipped as
the hairiest Ainu. “I shall not be ashamed of that, at
least,” I said to myself as I settled down in a corner of
the carriage for my three-hours' journey to Puddlecombe.

“What's that dirty mark on your lip 2" roared the
Colonel suddenly as I was in the middle of explaining
to him who I was.
“That's what puzzles me,” remarked the Adjutant before
I could reply. “I asked him about it, and his answers
were suspiciously—well, to say the least of it, suspicious.”
I started with surprise. I could swear that the only
remark made to me by the Adjutant had been, “And
how are they all at home?" However, I let that pass.
“It's intended to be a moustache, Sir,” I began.
“I don't care what it's intended to be,” snapped the
Colonel. “The question is, is it or is it not what it is 2"
“Yes, Sir, it isn't—that is to say, No, Sir, it is,” I stam-
mered, astounded beyond measure at the extraordinary
importance the Army apparently attached to moustaches.
“Well, it's a precious poor one, whichever it is—or is
not, as the case may be. What's your opinion ?” he
asked, turning to the Adjutant.
“Quite so,” said the latter,
even more so.”
“Just so,” said the Colonel. “Now let's get to the
bottom of this matter. Where did you get it from ?”
“I grew it,” I replied in astonishment. “All by my-
self,” I added, as if pleading extenuating circumstances.
“His parents did not help him with it, I can vouch for
that,” observed the Adjutant pleasantly.
“What seed did you use?” asked the Colonel.
“The very best, I assure you, Sir,” I answered in des-
peration, as I began dimly to wonder if there was some
War Office fertilizer I ought to have used and through
ignorance had omitted to do so.
The Colonel approached me with a magnifying-glass in
his hand. “Why, it's skewbald!” he cried. “Some of it's
brown, some of it's flaxen, and—bless my soul!—some of
it's ginger. You grew it in a pot! Why on earth didn't
you bed it out 2."
I racked my brains for some reminiscence of the law
governing the billeting of moustaches on private individuals.
“King's Regulations, page 993,” muttered the Adjutant.
“I won't have him,” raved the Colonel, resuming his
seat. “I won't have an officer that looks like a- By
the by, what's the fellow's name?”
I was about to tell him who I was when the Adjutant
said, “Charlie Chaplin.”
“Excuse me, Sir,” I put in hastily, “it’s nothing of the
sort. It's—"
“Do you mean to insinuate,” said the Colonel angrily,
“that the Adjutant doesn't even know your name 2 I
shall have you conducted to the padded mess-room, and
the M.O. shall remove your moustache, hair by hair, and
wozzle 'em.” -
I hadn't the faintest idea what he meant, but it sounded
dreadfully degrading. I thought of my mother and sisters,

room. He was obviously getting the wozzler ready.

THE PRESS IN WAR TIME.
WE observe that a German Professor has just issued a
manifesto imploring the public not to destroy old news-
papers. We have no doubt the German people will obey
the Professor; they would never have been where they are
had they not obeyed their professors. And yet—and yet
the temptation to destroy some of the German newspapers
must be very great.
The idea seems to be to use them for bedding for cattle,
and we hastened to consult our Agricultural Expert, whom
we encountered fortunately on our annual visit to Smith-
field. He gave us the following notes:—
In my opinion the thing seems all right, but it won't be
very comfortable. I notice however that, as the Professor
warms to his work, a wider vision opens before him, and he
suggests that papers might also be used as fodder, so that,
after having fed the mind of man, they would go on to
nourish the bodies of his dumb friends, and ultimately be
“turned into steaks.”
We may as well admit that, if it can be made to work,
along with the parallel scheme for feeding pigs on cinders
and poultry on cigar-ends, the collapse of Germany may
still be far distant. On paper the cattle may do all right,
but in practice difficulties are sure to arise. In the first
place the censorship will have to be much more strict than
it is if awkward facts in the situation are not to become the
common gossip of the shippens. There have been many
references in the German Press to a general slaughter of
stock, with a view to preserving the grain supply; this
might easily create a panic and put a whole herd off its
feed.
Then again—especially in finishing beasts for the fat-
stock markets—the most careful consideration in the
matter of diet would be necessary. I shrewdly suspect
that some of our own-newspapers, which have already been
accused of helping the enemy, may find their way into the
troughs of the Fatherland. Failing that, a daily ration of
the Frankfurter Zeitung might be recommended, with
courses of Vorwärts at intervals as a sedative. But some-
thing more stimulating would be needed in the later stages,
the Berliner, Tageblatt perhaps. . As a final dose nothing
could possibly be better than a bale of the KAISER's tele-
grams to TINo. These would have to be taken with a block
of Attic salt.
The experiment will be watched with interest by agricul-
turists. It may be that at the German Smithfield—if there
is such a thing—the patriotic prize-winner of the future
will be announced as “PRIME: PAPER FED.” And at the
least it is a happy way of disposing of any scraps of paper
which may have threatened to interfere with the KAISER's
Destructive Sword.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR “HELPFUL’” SERIES.
No. V.-EconoMY.
(After the style of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT,
at it again in “The Daily News.”)
Now that I have rolled over my
opponents—in spite of their references
to my fiction — on the question of
Invisible Imports it is clear that we
must get on to some other topic. From
my unique correspondence I judge that
there are still some people who don't
understand the argument for war
economy. I will therefore restate it
and show them in a moment just
exactly how it is.
To economise is to save money.
Money is saved by doing without
things—not by adding to one's ex-
penditure.
If we all economise faith-T
fully we shall not spend so –
much money as we did =
before.
If these facts were under-
stood there would be less
confusion in the public mind
than there is, despite the
fact that human nature is
human nature.
There are two ways of
economising—the compul-
sory and the optional; that
is to say the forced and the
voluntary. Forced economy
may involve a good deal of
inconvenience. Voluntary
economy might have the
same effect were it not that
human nature is human
nature. (You can always
get out of it that way.)
I will now explain where
economy is reasonably to
be expected.
(a) RENT.-Nothing doing here. I
blame landlords for the state of affairs,
and I blame building societies and
mortgagees. Everyone is to blame, but
the upshot is that unless the thing
were organised on a large scale no
results could be expected. If we all
moved into smaller houses and the
present large houses were allowed to
stand empty for a bit, rents for big
houses would come down with a run
—and then we could all move back.
But that demands unanimity.
(b) Food.—Optional economies might
possibly be brought about. But I doubt
it. You see human nature is
The waste is awful, I admit, for that
very reason. To this day all meat is
overcooked in Great Britain—every
time. To this day potatoes are allowed
to stand in cold water before being
boiled. To this day toast crusts are
cut off before it is served. To this day
without their skins. Our ignorance
of the art of feeding is profound and
shocking. And you may be sure that
a nation capable of these grotesque
follies will never economise in food.
Why should they 2 So that is no good.
(c) DREss. – Well, we don't spend
much on clothes. All women spend
far too little, which is a grotesque folly,
profound and shocking. I am con-
vinced that there are not enough and
never have been enough new gloves in
circulation. The duty to economise
in dress is a very urgent one; but let
us begin by trying to spend enough,
when we may hope to have some-
thing reasonable to work on in making
proper reductions. And mark you,
the spectacle of streets full of shabby
people, of ill-groomed men in taxi-cabs
Soldier. “THIS STAIRWAY DON'T SEEM. To ME To BE MoWING VERY
FAST.”
and dowdy women at matinées
No, no! It must not be. It would
adversely affect our spirits. It would
play the deuce with our moral. Nothing
can possibly be done in this depart-
ment. (See “Helpful "Series No. IV.
—“Moral.”)
(d) DoMESTIC SERVICE.-No; it looks
attractive but it can't be done. You
can only dismiss a servant by shutting
up part of your house. And you can-
not in practice shut up part of a house.
It is sure to burst open again, as long
as human—- Any economy on these
lines is ultimately uneconomical.
(e) TRAVEL-Great misapprehension
exists on this point. It is erroneously
supposed that money can be saved by
travelling less and travelling cheaper.
Don't you believe it. I can see no
earthly reason why those of us who
have been accustomed to travel first-
class should not continue to do so;
may more, I hold that those who used
to go third might well try the experi-
ment. Why not 2 The money is simply
transferred to the railway company, and
you may be sure that the railway com-
pany will use it to the best possible
advantage, whereas if you keep it you
are pretty certain to chuck it about in
some ridiculous manner. The same
argument applies generally. You are
quite safe in buying the best cigars, as
your tobacconist is sure to be a less
reckless spender than you are. Again,
what about motors? We read of
pleasure-cars. No one ever spoke of a
pleasure-dog-cart. Have we forgotten
the days when people used to scorch
about the country in dog-carts? No
one ever spoke of a pleasure-bus or a
pleasure-cab. It is pure prejudice.
Some say that we should sack our
TT chauffeurs, but that seems
to me to be a fallacy. Sup-
pose it were generally at-
tempted. Suppose that Sir
Edward GREY drove his
own car. What should we
think of the spectacle of our
For EIGN MINISTER down on
bis hands and knees in the
mud of Whitehall looking
for a puncture—while the
GREEK MINISTER was wait-
ing for him at his office?
I can imagine nothing more
destructive of our moral.
(f), DRINKING. — Some-
thing should be-done here.
R. But it will not be done.
The Government seems to
have surrendered to the
miserable argument that
human nature is human
nature.
(g) DISTRACTIONS.–I see
- no objection to dancing.
On the contrary a practice which
makes so directly for efficiency should
not be neglected as it is. Theatres
also are being neglected, which is a
pity, for we shall live in a horrific
void without them. But above all
more money must be spent on books.
Nothing steadies public opinion and
uplifts moral like a voracious con-
sumption of recent novels. Reduction
of expenditure must not be confounded
with true economy.
Here ends my list. The conclusions
are, I know, profoundly true. If we
all make up our minds once and for all
to economise faithfully on the drastic
lines here set forth—we can afford to

Scotch Wife. “O AY! I was PLEASED ENough, BUT I was NA sun PRISED. HE STOOD UP TO ME ONCE' ''
A MANOR IN THE AIR.
THE stately homes of England have
ever numbered some very odd names.
Everyone remembers that beautiful
Southern retreat whither, to the de-
light of the wags, Mr. BALFour often
journeyed for his week-end holiday—
“Clouds,” the seat of the WYNDHAMs.
Could there be a much more fascinating
name than “Clouds”? And then there
is “Wrest,” Lord LUCAS's Bedfordshire
home, now transferred, how suitably,
into a hospital for soldiers. And there
is that Midland paradise which, in the
days of placid even life, the editors of
illustrated weeklies always recollected
with gratitude when they were short
of other pictures—“Compton Wyn-
yates.”
But the new name which I have
just discovered, and which fills the
inward eye with joy, is a house on a
smaller scale than these—a manor-
house rather than a mansion, perhaps
one of the smallest that can be de-
scribed as a “gentleman's place,” but
assuredly that. Somewhere in Sussex,
Western Sussex.
It is not near the station, and to
reach it you walk or drive along wind-
ing roads just now sodden with rain,
but smelling of the good wet Sussex
leaves and mast and soil, with the
Downs rising not too many miles away
in the South. Then a turn into a narrow
lane, with the bare trees of a copse on
either side and a scurrying pheasant in
front of you, and behold the white
gate! There is no lodge—the house is
just too small for that, as you can now
see for yourself, for there it is, under
the protection of the wood that rises
behind it, so quiet and self-contained
that you almost gasp.
Very old it is, but good for many
years more. The frame is of timber
and plaster, and a Horsham stone roof.
These stones are a little damp and
moss-covered (for our ancestors insisted
on building in a hole, or where would
Friday's fish come from ?), and the
place is as Tudor as QUEEN BEss her-
self, in whose reign its foundations were
dug. The chimney stacks, all smoking
with the thin blue smoke of logs, are of
tiny Tudor bricks, and the chimneys
are set not square with the house but
cornerways. A long low façade with
the central door in a square porch; the
whole grave but serene.
A path of more Horsham stone leads
to the door, with thyme and lavender
springing from the interstices undis-
mayed by the feet of man, and smooth
lawns on each side, and under the
diamond-paned windows a bed where
in summer would be night stock and
lemon verbena and tobacco plant and
mignonette. On the roof a few white
fantails; a spaniel near the door; and
a great business of rooks in the sky.
Through the windows of the lower
rooms you see the greenery at the back
of the house and a suggestion here and
there of books and pictures—everything
that makes a house a home.
Beside the house on the right are the
stables; and on the other side a dark
shrubbery, and beyond that more
lawns and gardens and the fish-pond.
Do you see it? Perhaps you have
already seen it differently; for how
could you help forming some mental
picture of it when in every carriage on
the L. B. & S. C. R. is posted up the
notice, “Passengers to Lower Blinds”?
To me “Lower Blinds" is just such
a manor-house as that.

XXXI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, –You should drop
in one of these evenings at “A” Mess,
just to see the odd collection of special-
ists who go to make up our company.
These are the people who have the
Bright Ideas.
First there is the Colonel, whose
business in life is horses, Sir. He is a
soldier of the old school, courtly and
kind till it comes to a matter of business
with a regimental transport officer.
Then he develops a nasty suspicious side
to his nature, no doubt calling to mind
the affair of a certain “horse, draught,
one " of earlier days of the campaign.
Once upon a time the Nth Division
(let us say) found itself the possessor
of a horse which it did not love, but
which would not die. Being wise in his
generation the officer in charge very
wickedly prefixed another number to
that already there before he turned the
beast adrift. In due course the Colonel
became aware of the irregular existence
somewhere in France of a horse marked
NNth Division (let us say) and behav-
ing in a suspicious manner; and, also
in due course, the NNth Division got
to hear of the same thing and of the
Colonel's pained surprise in the matter.
The responsible person was invited to
explain it and not to be deterred from
putting the explanation in writing by
the fact that it would certainly be used
in evidence against him.
Now it happened that the NNth
Division had not at that time left Eng-
land, but were none the less ready on
that account to oblige the Colonel.
They were prepared to furnish any
number of explanations, but for the
moment regarded the following as the
most attractive:–“ The horse, draught,
one, feeling bitterly that the establish-
ment of the NNth Division was com-
plete without it, had trotted away from
ALDERSHOT (possibly in high dudgeon),
WaS
snatching a hasty but well-deserved
meal ELSEW HERE, grounded at or near
the H in Bou Log NE, been shaken off
the drops, strolled up-country to have
a look at the trenches, taken a foolish
dislike to the latter, galloped back
again, boarded a train for MAnsellips,
and when apprehended was doubtless
intending to proceed thence to some
PLACE UNKNowN.” This minute was
not made more welcome to the Colonel
by the remark upon it of an old
enemy through whom it was passed –
“For your guidance, please."
Then we have a most diabolical Cap-
tain known as Patent Processes. There
is only one man in the Mess of sufficient
intellect to take part in his highly
technical conversations, and that is the
Lieutenant, in the same business but
the other side of it, known as Anti-
dotes for Same. They are rarely in
complete harmony, but recently they
combined to beg, borrow or steal a
horse off the Colonel. This put the
Colonel, always anxious to encourage
youth and energy, in a fix; as he said,
you supply one sort of horse for riding
purposes and another for experimenting
on. They, of course, could be no more
explicit with him than I am being with
you, for, as we all now know so well,
“les emnemies oreilles mous écoutent.”
Then there's Eliza, a very necessary
euphemism (as you'll agree) for his tech-
nical description, Liaison Officer. You
are not going to be told even what his
business is; no one is allowed to know
that. We suspect that he is kept in the
dark himself. Whatever it is, he carries
it about with him on his long journeys
in a little bag. I have only managed
to see that open once, and then he was
helping himself to a piece of chocolate
out of it. However, he never fails to
bring back with him at night the very
latest news from the very highest au-
thority. He hints at it, behind closed
doors, in the most discreet of whispers;
and sure enough there it is in next
morning's paper, officially denied.
Don't let yourself be deceived by the
dignified bearing and intellectual refine-
ment of Captain He will discuss
with you diplomacy and the fine arts;
he will condescend, in an academic vein,
to remark upon the nuances of feminine
fashions, but on the whole he will leave
you under the impression that the prin-
ciple of his existence is noblesse oblige.
Nothing of the sort: he's the Inspector
of Army Ashpits. There never was a
rubbish tip in the area but he must
needs get to the bottom of it. We call
him “Sue,” which is short for sewage.
Next comes the General Staff Officer.
The hurried nature and inconvenient
times of his meals induced us for a long
time to look upon him as a busy man,
but now Lord St. DAVIDs has shown
him up. We therefore assume his time-
table to be :–9 A.M. to 1 P.M., beer and
bridge; 2 P.M. to 5, cocktails and piquet;
5.30 to 7.30, whisky and auction; 8.30
to closing time, wine, women and song.
Those solitary nights he spends on
duty are given to absinthe and the more
vicious forms of patience. Is it not all
very, very sad? To the casual observer
looking in, a General Staff office looks
like a particularly dull insurance office
always working overtime, instead of
which it is, of course, a sink of iniquity,
the female portion of which is cleverly
disguised as unattractive and not too
well-dressed Staff Sergeants.
Last, but not least, comes the Camp
Commandant, whose lot it is to do
adjutant over us, amongst others. The
other day, in performance of his duty,
he posted a notice in the Mess:–
NOTICE.
Will Officers please state how many Gas
Helmets they possess?
H. H. HuMBER, Capt.,
Camp Commandant.
For some days the only result was
as follows:–
NOTICE.
Will Officers please state how many Gas
Helmets they possess?
H. H. HuMBER, Capt.,
Camp Commandant.
Ome. H. H. HuMBER, Capt.
Even that failed to encourage the
others, and this was the complete text
of the notice when last seen –
NOTICE.
Will Officers please state how many Gas
Helmets they possess?
H. H. HuMBER, Capt.,
Camp Commandant.
One. H. H. HUMBER, Capt.
Thank you.
H. H. HuMBER, Capt.,
Camp Commandant.
Last night we had a guest, a most
engaging Colonel of one of the new
units. His youth was spent soldiering,
his middle age in commerce. His full
maturity finds him in his element again.
He said he wasn't feeling quite him-
self at the moment, having that morn-
ing had on the carpet (the Orderly
Room carpet) his own bank manager.
War is war and platoon commanders
must be treated as such if the rifle-
barrels of their platoons don't shine
bravely through the rain. “Under-
stand clearly,” he said, “if this happens
again you're for it, and you can do
what you like about my confounded
overdraft.”
“It's a hard life for an old soldier,”
he told us, but the old soldier doesn't set
about to make it harder. On receiving
summary orders from the War Office
to report for duty, his first action had
been to issue equally summary orders
to his private chef to the same effect.
He kept the fat, jovial but thoroughly
surprised fellow by him while the
Testament was sent for, and himself
swore him in then and there. And so,
within a few hundred yards of the
Hun, the good cook continues daily to
produce divine novelties from tins of
bully beef and plum-and-apple jam. He
takes his revenge for forced marches
by wearing on all occasions a faded
straw hat with his uniform, laughing
at all threats of imprisonment. “I hate
punishing my men,” said the Colonel.
Quite,” said we.
Yours ever, HENRY.

THE skies that arched his land were blue,
His bush-born winds were warm and sweet,
And yet from earliest hours he knew
The tides of victory and defeat;
Trom fierce floods thundering at his birth,
From red droughts ravening while he played,
He learned to fear no foes on earth—

The bugles of the Motherland
Rang ceaselessly across the sea,
To call him and his lean brown band
To shape Imperial destiny;
He went, by youth's grave purpose willed,
The goal unknown, the cost unweighed,
The promise of his blood fulfilled—
“The bravest thing God ever made!”
We know —it is our deathless pride!—
The splendour of his first fierce blow;
How, reckless, glorious, undenied,
He stormed those steel-lined cliffs we know !
And none who saw him scale the height
Behind his reeking bayonet-blade
Would rob him of his title-right—
“The bravest thing God ever made'"
I3ravest, where half a world of men
Are brave beyond all earth's rewards,
So stoutly none shall charge again
Till the last breaking of the swords:
Wounded or hale, won home from war,
Or yonder by the Lone Pine laid,
Give him his due for evermore—

House of Commons, Monday, Decem-
ber 6th.-As usual, lion's share of Ques-
tions fell to lot of UNDER-SECRETARY
For WAR. Also as usual, TENNANT's
replies were excellent alike in substance
and manner.
The art of answering Questions satis-
factorily not easy of full attainment.
A Minister, especially one of junior
rank and of age known at the War
Office as “eligible,” must avoid pert-
ness, but should be able occasionally to
gratify the almost infantile desire of
House to be amused. He must
be frank in statement whilst
discreet in measure of information
conveyed. In dealing with multi-
plicity of inquiries, a considerable
portion born of personal vanity or
desire for self-advertisement, he
must live up, at least in appearance,
to the Pauline example of suffering
fools gladly. At the same time he
must be able at rare intervals to
administer sharp rap on knuckles
to a pest of the Question-hour who
momentarily excels himself.
TENNANT too gentle by nature,
too courteous by habit, to dis-
tinguish himself in last field of
action. Other requirements neces-
sary to success in difficult position
he daily exhibits, achievement
rendered easier by fact that he
has modestly won his way to
favour of all sections of House,
with possible exception of Herr
GINNELL, who is inclined to class
him with his colleague, the IRISH
SECRETARY.

of this obserwation lays in the appli-

designed coincidence he to-night
indicated the latest attitude of
the Allies on subject.
“If,” he said, “proposals of a
serious character for a general
peace are put forward, either
directly or through a neutral
Power, by the Enemy Govern-
ments they will be discussed by
the Allied Governments."
This intimation is at the service
of the IMPERIAL CHANCELLOR for
any use he cares to make of it
when giving final touch to his
speech.

AT THE BACK OF THE FRONT.
ABout 10.30 o'clock on the night of
the –th —er, 19—, I was shivering
in my tent and trying to extract a pair
of frozen feet from a pair of freezing
gun-boots with the help of a tent pole
when an orderly dashed in with a
message marked “Urgent or ordinary"
for my immediate use.
It appeared therefrom that no less
a person than was going to in-
spect us to-morrow.
I read on with comparative non-
chalance (chalance was out of the
question at that temperature) until I
came to a bit about Company Com-
manders. (I was, in a manner of
speaking, a Company Commander at
that date. I believe I got an extra
sixpence a day for it, on account of
the responsibility, you know—or per-
haps it was to keep a horse with ;
anyhow, “Company Commanders,"
read the message, “will be expected
to know everything.")
More words may have followed
qualifying even this moderate expecta-
tion; but as a matter of fact I sud-
denly realised just at this point that
I was ill–horribly ill; had been for
weeks.
With a feeble gesture and a few
curt decisive orders I indicated to the
orderly that I wished him to hand
the message on to the Sergeant-Major.
Then I fell back and would have
swooned but for I can't really
think why I didn't swoon. Perhaps
because there was no one looking.
There are various ways of squaring
doctors. It happened by chance that
I had a great number of socks on hand.
The strength of a man is his weakest
kink. Our doctor's kink is socks. You
can't give him enough. He has an
idea, apparently not shared by official
t
t
men from frostbite. Anyhow, next
day he provided me with a motor-car
and a disease—I learned its name by
heart—and left another officer with
the company to swank before the
inspector. I believe in giving some
of the younger men a chance.
They brought me gradually here.
We arrived at dead of night and took
the place by complete surprise. Event-
ually we were lined up and asked to
account for ourselves. I assured them
that I was seventy-seven years old, had
thirty-two years' service, had been in
the country nineteen years and was
a Bush Baptist.
The R.A.M.C. Corporal seemed dubi-
ous, but allowed me into B Ward.
There a sister woke up and inquired
what was the matter with me.
I told her.
She seemed incredulous and asked
me again.
I repeated my lesson twice, and even
then I was sure she didn't believe me.
“Where have you got it?” she
asked.
“Here,” I said. “I didn't like trust-
ing it to my valise.”
She made a disappointed noise.
“Haven't you a card?" she began
again.
“I’m awfully sorry,” I said, “but
I've had none printed since war broke
out. You see
“I mean a card saying what's the
matter with you—from the clearing
station ?”
“No,” I said. “No, you see, they
couldn't have got it all in on a card,
and it wasn't worth writing a letter, as
I was coming myself so soon.”
She sent me to bed.

THE curriculum of the College is
specially designed to prepare pupils for
a Parliamentary career.
Especial attention is given to shy,
retiring and silent boys, with a view to
encouraging them to speak and assert
themselves on all occasions in a spirit
of fearless independence and aggressive
importunity.
The dominant note of the College is
the Note of Interrogation.
Besides attending lectures by the
greatest experts in the Inquisitorial
Art, pupils assemble twice a day, at
12 noon and 5 P.M., to take part in a
contest which faithfully reproduces the
conditions of Question Time in the
House of Commons, the professors
acting as Ministers and the boys as
Members.
Prizes are awarded every term to the
pupils who have asked the most em-
barrassing, the most irrelevant and the
most truculent questions.
Lessons in self-defence form an in-
tegral part of the curriculum. Classes
are held daily in boxing and ballistics
(Professor RoNALD McNEILL), fencing
(Professor ARTHUR LYNCH), jujitsu
(Professor Sir WILLIAM BYLEs), Greco-
Roman wrestling (Professor JoyNsoN-
Hicks), and pig-sticking (Professor
Hogg|E).
N.B. —Ill-tempered, violent and
quarrelsome boys are judiciously treated
on a new system of intensive culture,
so that their idiosyncrasies may be
turned to the best possible account.
Testimonials received by the Principal:
DEAR SIR,-Although my son has
only been for one term at your College
I am glad to say that he has already
largely conquered his hereditary bash-
fulness. Only yesterday he asked his
aunt at luncheon, in the presence of the
Vicar, how long she had dyed her hair.
Gratefully yours, PAUL PRYor.
DEAR SIR,--In sending you cheque
for next term I wish to express my in-
debtedness to your admirable method
of instruction as illustrated by the pro-
gress of my son Jasper. This morning
he asked me whether I intended to
give him a war-bonus in the shape of
an extra shilling a week pocket-money,
and when I replied that I must consult
my bankers before answering the ques-
tion, he threw his plate, containing
poached egg and bacon, at me with
extraordinary accuracy of aim. I attri-
bute this result to the excellent training
he has received from your Professor of
Ballistics; and beg to sign myself,
Yours truly, CHICKERING PECK.
DEAR SIR,--Before he went to Heckle-
bury Hall my son was the most back-
ward boy I ever knew. He is now
the most forward lad I have ever met.
We never know what he will say or
do next. He has revolutionised our
home life, and my wife seldom leaves
her room in the holidays. You are at
liberty to make any use you like of
this letter.
Yours faithfully, HADDEN Doon E.
DEAR SIR,--I have no sons, but if I
had twenty I would send them all to
your school to be turned into Heckle-
bury Finns. It is the finest product
of our times and the only school
where the young idea is instructed on
the sound principle of being always
“agin the Government.” Heaven pros-

JAMES GREENwood's “Amateur Casual” in The Pall Mall.
As Special Correspondent in the Paris of 1867; Geneva of
the Alabama Convention; Madrid of the Carlist rebellion;
Paris again, with the friendship of HUGo and GAMBETTA;
America; Berlin in the eighties; Petersburg (that was)
with TURGUENIEFF-he has not lived a dull life or given a
dull, though, may be, a quiet, reflection of it. The general
reticence sharpens our wits to understand the faint allusions
and induces a very pleasant glowing sense of intelligence
when we succeed, to counteract the chill of disappointment
when we fail. One must quote the verdict of “a brilliant
Irishwoman" on a certain fantastic countryman of hers
who shall be nameless: “You make a great fuss about
him. We have a man like that at the cross-roads of every
village snacking every passer-by for the benefit of the
rectories, his squires and parsons and all their pleasant
little world, gives us an account of a country in which
wealth is a wickedness and often a punishment, and where
ungenteel poverty rules the roast and oppresses the opulent.
Mr. John Howard, who penetrated into this country, was
startled and disconcerted by the furious indignation with
which a proffered tip of sixpence was repelled by an
inhabitant who had all the appearance of a tramp. He
was doomed to be still further disconcerted, for when a
kind-hearted native attempted to relieve him, for his own
good, of his rich watch and chain he naturally pursued the
thief, but was himself taken into custody. In Upsidonia a
Mr. Hobson “had come his biggest cropper over a worked-
out silver mine, in which antimony or some such metal was
discovered the moment the shares seemed to be worth

the author's own vehemence
on the same too much dis-
cussed subject is the product of
war passions. It is the only
touch of spleen in a gracious
book, which you may close
with the verdict: There goes
an honest Radical.
I suppose that detective or 4
spy stories may be regarded 3
as a mild form of intoxicant,
and in this case I can promise
that you will find The Thirty-
Nine Steps (BLAckwooD) an
agreeably exhilarating blend.
Indeed, I am not sure that
its consumption should not be
confined to certain restricted
hours, say 5 to 6 P.M., or
from 10.30 onwards. To begin
sipping at it in the morning
would certainly be fatal to
the day's work. In his pleas-
ant little Preface, Mr. John
BUCHAN refers to it as belong-
ing to that type of romance
“where the incidents defy
the probabilities and march
just inside the borders of the
possible.” There could be

certainly shall not tell you about them yet. At times one
may feel in retrospect that the border-line laid down by
Mr. BUCHAN has been overstepped; but this is in retrospect
only and belongs to the next-morning mood. At the
moment the thrill of Hannay's evasions and escapes and
disguises holds one too fascinated to worry over the
question whether they could ever have happened. If
I have a criticism, it is that the dressing-up motive is a
trifle overworked. But if you should be tempted into some
impatience over this let me beg of you to hold on for the
sake of the last chapter, which provides a quite original
and breath-taking climax. For this alone The Thirty-Nine
Steps would be well worth your climbing, despite the
undeniable steepness of some of them.
In Upsidonia (STANLEY PAUL) Mr. ARCHIBALD MARSHALL,
abandoming for a time his beloved country-houses and
(CoNSTABLE) ought to be given a roving commission; I
mean that it should be found here, there and everywhere,
so that one may have a dip into it and pass on. To read
it through at a sitting—as I did—is to come to mild logger-
heads not so much with the book itself as with AGNEs and
EGERTON CASTLE's idea of it. “We trust,” they say in a
foreword, “our pages may add a little mirth more to the
gallant spirit abroad.” Well, I discovered very little
to make me laugh, but I did find something to refresh and
gladden me. In short, when the EGERTON CASTLEs are
out to be funny they seem to me to leave the bull's-eye
unscathed, but when they are telling us of courage in the
face of danger, of anxieties nobly borne, or of the beauties
and joy of their garden, they hit the centre of the target
every time. Without conscious effort they create a bond of
sympathy with their readers which is very real and endur-
ing. This is what is called an intimate book, but eyes that
are merely curious will get little satisfaction from its
pages, its appeal being solely to lovers of a simple chronicle
charmingly told.

IT was a murky night, and the room
with its cheerful fire seemed particu-
larly inviting when I entered and
addressed myself to the man who was
busily writing in a book.
“I’ve come at last,” I said.
“Pleased to see you,” he answered.
“I should have come long ago,” I
continued, “only, you see, Jones and I
had a small bet as to who would stick
out the longer. I find Jones went
yesterday, so here I am.”
“Yes, you are,” he admitted, “but—”
“I’m five feet ten,” I went on, inter-
rupting him. “Chest thirty-nine—or
forty, I'm not sure which. Not bad, eh?”
“Excellent,” he agreed; “and I
should say you weighed about twelve
stone.”
“Pretty right,” I said admiringly;
“but I hope you don't propose to mul-

“Then there's my age,” I went on.
“Can you guess that 2 or shall we

I'd better see him to-night and get it
over. Suspense would be very painful.”
“Yes, perhaps you had better. “I
fancy that 's his step outside now.”
He darted out of the room, and after
a minute or two returned in company
with a sombre-faced man with such a
pronounced professional air that it
seemed almost to form a halo round him.
“You want to see me?” he inquired
briskly.
“It's usual, I believe,” I said. “Shall

“Duty alone,” I told him.
“H'm,” he murmured, raising his
eyebrows. “Perhaps I'd better have
a closer look at you. Come this way.”
He led me across a court-yard into a
snug surgery, through which we passed
into a room filled with weird-looking
instruments. *
Having examined me with the aid of
divers pieces of apparatus for about
half-an-hour, he put them aside and
turned to me. -
“You're quite all right,” he said.
“You’ve nothing to fear.”
“Thanks,” I said. “I feel as sound
as a bell.” -
“You are. Good night.”
“I suppose I may tell the other chap
I'm perfectly fit?” I asked.
“If you want to,” he said non-
chalantly.
“The doctor has passed me,” I told
the inquisitor, “so we can soon polish
off the rest of the business. I sign some-
thing, don't I, and get a shilling or so?”
A look of surprise spread over his
face. “If the doctor says you're all
right, I suppose you must be,” he said
slowly. “But what's that you said
about a shilling?”
“Have you given up the time-
honoured practice? I didn't know,
but it doesn't matter anyway. Now

His eyes suddenly lighted up with
understanding. He rose and led me to
the door. -
“You must have mistaken the way

OUR CHILDREN'S CORNER.
(A Point of Style.)
Is not this a charming letter from
Isobel?
DEAR UNCLE PUNCH,-I thought you
might like to know that Tony and I
are writing a story, because Tony says
these writer fellows make pots of
money, and he knows a chap at school
whose father is one, and he gets a
shilling a word, and if we write a lot of
words that would be ever so much,
wouldn't it? And perhaps we'd get
more for the big ones; and we're going
to put it all into the War Loan and win
the War, and then Father and Tom
can come home again. It's quite easy
except just the beginning, because we
both got “Very good” for spelling last
term, and I've thought of a splendid
plot, and Tony's bought a book, “How
to write Short Fiction,” which tells us
exactly how to do it.
I'll tell you all about it, Uncle
Punch, because I know you're a
literal old gentleman, and I expect
you've had some practice at stories
yourself. You see, this is what the
book says:—
“1. The plot must be striking and
original. Ask yourself, ‘Could anyone
have thought of this?’ and if the
answer is ‘Yes' it's no good.” Well,
that's all right, because Tony Suther-
ington is most awfully brave, and he's
been out to the Front and got all the
letters we can find in the paper after
his name; and he's in love with Isobel
Bruce, who is the prettiest girl in the
county, and she refused him when he
was a clerk before the War, but marries
him when he comes home wounded.
Many people couldn't have thought of
that, could they? And you don't think
it will matter their having our own
Christian names, do you, because that
will make it so autozoological, like
David Copperfield, when we become
famous 2
“2. It must be topical.” That means
about the War, you know, so it's all
right too.
“3. Grip your reader right away.
Have a snap in the first sentence. It
is a good plan to always as a general
rule begin (why did that make father
laugh, Uncle Punch 2) with the hero or
heroine's name, and let it be an attrac-
tive one.”
Now we come to the difficulty. I
began: “Lieut. Tony Sutherington's,
D.C.M., D.S.C., M.V.O., D.S.O., W.C.,
M.D., K.C. jaws snapped like steel,”
and Tony said that made it look as if
it was his jaws that were D.C.M., etc.;
so he put, “Lieut. Tony Sutherington,
D.C.M., D.S.C., M.V.O., D.S.O., V.C.,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
XII.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-We Terri-
torials in India are gradually coming
to realise the significance of our position
here. At first, misled by semi-official
statements, we fondly imagined we
had been sent out mainly for the
purpose of being trained under favour-
able conditions in the gentle art of
slaying Bosches. Months passed, and
as the hot weather came upon us and
we were split up into numerous detach-
ments, which rendered war training for
the time being almost impossible, we
began to perceive our error.
Now over a year has elapsed since
we landed in Bombay, and we are
persuaded in our own minds that we
are not, after all, destined to be useful formalities and the harsh ways of the afternoon you would probably find one
in the manner of fighters,
but to serve our purpose
during the Great War by
being merely ornamental.
We have, in other words,
come to the conclusion that
it is our sole duty by the
splendour of our appearance
to impress the peoples of
India with the might and
glory of Britain. Some go
so far as to assert that we
were specially selected for
this purpose by Lord KIT-
CHENER, after anxious con-
sideration, on account of
the matchless beauty and
symmetry of our persons
and the magnificence of
our physique.
Still, whatever we are
asked to do, we are patri-

the Company football and a washing
bowl in addition to me. Even allowing
for my rather emaciated condition—as
a result of the hot-season—the propor-
tions seemed altogether too generous.
But I think I see now that it is meant
as a gentle hint that my normal figure is
not as impressively proportioned as it
should be in order to awe the natives,
and that it is up to me to develop it
till it conforms to standard. Mean-
while I suppose the pillow, the Com-
pany football and the washing bowl
will have to accompany me when I go
on parade.
In view of the foregoing alleged ex-
planation of our presence in India,
there are naturally differences of opinion
in the regiment as to what constitutes
discipline.
Some are all for rigid

Front). “THAT'LL FETCH FATHER CHRISTMAs.”
the small matter of sloping arms from
the stand-at-ease position. We used
to count silently as we carried out the
different motions — one, two, three,
four—cutting the right hand away
smartly at four. After a time there
grew up a tendency to make the move-
ments too huried, so, instead of counting
four, we began to count seven, moving
only on the odd numbers—one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven. This, it
was presently decided, made us too
slow, so another method was adopted,
and we were told to count—one and
two and three and four.
These and similar changes inspired
certain frivolous privates to invent
other ways of ensuring uniformity of
movement in manual drill. If you
chanced to look into our bungalow one
T. man in a corner busily
sloping arms as he mur-
murs to himself, “Twice
one are two ; twice two are
four; twice three are sir;
twice four are eight.” An-
other would be performing
the same action while mut-
tering “Mensa, mensa,
menSam—mensae, mensae,
mensa — mensae, menSae,
mensas—mensarum, men-
sis, mensis.” Yet another
would be reciting—
“There is a happy land
Far, far away,
Where soldiersdon't have stew

And to justify the ex-
pectation—which in reality
we all nurse at the bottom of
our hearts—that some day

otically determined to do
it well, even if it is no more than to
| look beautiful. Consequently, when
an inspection of our battalion by the
General was announced a short time
ago, we resolved to surpass ourselves.
Such a creaking of starched tunics,
such a glittering of equipment, such a
flashing of bayonets, such a mingled
aroma of hair-oil and tooth-paste, have
never been known before in all India.
In the short march to the maidan, dust
had settled upon our mirror-like boots.
Native cleaning boys were hastily
summoned to kneel and restore our
footgear to its pristine brilliance as we
stood in review order on the parade
ground, till the nose of the General's
horse appeared round the corner.
There is generally some reason, if
you look for it, underlying even the
most puzzling actions of the Army
authorities. We have recently been
issued with serge uniforms for the cold
weather, and I was at first surprised
to find room in my tunic for a pillow,
martinet. Others believe in the most
free-and-easy methods consistent with
efficiency. It becomes a little con-
fusing for the long-suffering private at
times. Yesterday, when I was acting
as Mess Orderly, the Battalion Orderly
Sergeant chanced to be of the martinet
type. At dinner-time he formed us up
in companies, called us to attention,
dressed us by the right, numbered us
in a series of stentorian and bark-like
orders, and sent us marching off in
fours to our respective cookhouses,
heads up and arms swinging, left, right,
left, right . . . Our Company Orderly
Corporal, of the opposite school, bore
it with resignation until we were out
of earshot. Then he said quietly,
“Halt' Fall out and get your
grub' "
We strive to increase our impressive-
ness by rightly paying great attention
to ceremonial drill. No detail is con-
sidered too unimportant in our efforts
after perfection. Take, for example,
the Front, we do not neglect to train
assiduously in field work. If we expend
much facetious argument as to whether
shovels should properly be carried at
the trail or at the slope, and whether
the points of picks should or should
not be burnished daily, this does not
prevent us from getting underground
with great speed and efficiency when
the time comes to use them.
Privately I may confide to you that
we argue as follows:–
The best British troops are those
trained in India:
We are trained in India:
... we are the best British troops.
And we do our utmost to live up to it.
Yours ever,
ONE OF THE PUNCH BRIGADE.
P.S.—The Home Government has
not, as we feared, entirely forgotten us.
We have just been officially informed
that we are entitled to benefit by the
maternity clauses of the Insurance
Act on and after 1st November, 1915.

WINGFIELD House, the voluntary
hospital we were attached to, was an
off-shoot of St. Elmo's, the large and
dignified mother institution which was
supposed to feed us with patients when
it happened to remember our existence.
No wonder we thought we were for-
gotten when week after week went by
and the wards, which we had rubbed
and scrubbed and polished till we could
see our enthusiastic faces in practically
everything, were still lacking those
stricken heroes we longed to succour,
help and comfort. At last, in answer
to a tentative inquiry from our Com-
mandant, we received a rather curt
official intimation that we need not
expect any cases for at least a week.
On the strength of this the Matron
took the night off, the three trained
Sisters went home for the week-end,
and the ward-maids went to the
“pictures,” leaving me and Doris and
the Commandant in charge, and rather
at a loose end. There was a lovely

got to the lathery stage of the
shampoo when there came an impera-
tive knock at the entrance door. I
dropped my brush, bundled my hair
into my cap, which fortunately is one
of the kind that covers a multitude of
sins, and went to see who it was.
There stood an R.A.M.C. man and a
big motor ambulance drawn up at
the gate.
“What have you got there?” I
gasped.
“Seven cases for you, Sister,” he
replied cheerfully. “From St. Elmo's.”
“Oh, but—” I cried; “there's
some mistake. We were told none
were coming till next week.”
The R.A.M.C. man shook his head.
“I don't know anything about that,
Sister,” he said. “This is Wingfield
House. My orders was to bring 'em
here, and I can't take 'em back.”
“Oh no, of course not,” I said hastily,
my head in a whirl.
“My mate'll give me a hand to bring
'em in,” he continued briskly; “and
we'll set 'em down in the 'all till you
show us where to take 'em.”

her apron on in a jiffy, and, ignoring
the soapy water trickling down her

parade. The discipline and training
Doris and I had undergone told too.
Spurred by heavy footsteps in the
entrance and the sound of helpless
burdens being carefully set down, in
less than ten minutes we had the
fire blazing in the ward, the beds
turned down, kettles boiling and cocoa
simmering, and everything ready to
hand. Then, led by the Commandant,
we went to receive our first cases,

[DECEMBER 22, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WOUNDED HERO.
(By ONE of THEM).
I LAID my head back comfortably
against the pillows and glanced at
Eleanor sideways.
“And now,” I said, “you must never
forget that I am a wounded hero—
wounded hero, that is, as long as I am
wounded, and then of course a hero
pure and simple. This implies that
our relative positions will not be quite
what they were before the War.”
Eleanor looked at me suspiciously.
I should explain that she has an in-
credibly low opinion of my activities
in every field of human endeavour that
I have so far entered. She has also
a scorn for my personal appearance,
which in her less imaginative moments
renders her most unwilling to be seen
with me at public functions. Indeed,
it has always been a source of per-
manent and unconcealed amazement to
her relations and of modified surprise
and gratification to myself that she
should ever have chosen me for a
husband at all. But that is another
story, which I will tell upon another
OCCàS10n.
“Pooh,” said Eleanor. - .
I allowed a soupçon of pain to mingle
with the “wounded hero” look which
I had been practising in front of the
looking-glass every morning for a fort-
night and was wearing at the moment.
“But if I am not a wounded hero
is it not clear,” said I, with a happy
touch of the Socratic method, “is it
not clear that I must be a wounded
coward 2 Perhaps you suggest,” said I
with growing heat, “that I myself shot
myself through the leg 2" (I was suf-
fering from the uncomplicated passage
of a German bullet through my thigh).
Eleanor was by this time frankly
scornful. “My dear child,” she said,
“no one who looks like you look could
ever be a real hero,” and she gave me
one of her firm glances, clearly expect-
ing by decisive treatment at the start to
banish this latest bogie from my brain.
“That's because your mother brought
you up on novels in which the hero
stood six-foot-odd in his stockings, had
eyes of flame and an unnatural supply
of honey-coloured hair. Such men are
out of date nowadays. Their height
would prove fatal to them in a trench
even if their constitution proved equal
to the preliminary hardships. No,
Eleanor, heroes nowadays are made of
less obvious stuff.”
I closed my eyes, an invalid ruse
which I often found effective. Were
she less invincibly attractive in all
her ways I should describe Eleanor's
comment as something between a
snuffle and a sniff.
“There are proud moments ahead of
you,” I went on. “As, for example,
when you are able to drive by my side
round and round Hyde Park in my
grandparents' motor. Picture to your-
self how the women in the crowd will
nudge each other as we glide under the
arch at Hyde Park Corner; how they
will murmur"Lucky girl! Lucky girl!’”
I paused a moment for any com-
ments which Eleanor might make on
this sunny forecast. I judged, how-
ever, from her expr2ssion that her
thoughts were not on the happy tour
which I had been planning for her. I
felt that I must strike a nobler note.
“And then nothing is more certain
than that the KING and QUEEN will
visit this hospital,” I went on. “Twice
already since I was here it has been
reported that Their Majesties were
coming; and if the startling conse-
quences which this announcement has
had upon the flagging energies of the
W.A.D.'s. have sometimes tempted me
to doubt whether the rumour started so
far away as Buckingham Palace there
is little doubt that, upon the next occa-
sion, Their Gracious Majesties will by
their actual presence in our midst
banish so unworthy a suspicion.”
I stopped to recover my breath
after this unexpectedly long sentence.
Eleanor's eyes were far away.
“On that day the procedure will be
something like this,” I said, looking
prophetically out of the window. “My
bed will be placed in a prominent posi-
tion upon the hospital lawn. I shall
wear my green pyjamas and a brown
woolly waistcoat secured by a safety-
pin at the throat. The fissure in my
leg will be hidden beneath a red
blanket. The drawn expression on my
face will be released into a slightly wan
smile as the Royal couple approach. I
shall indicate you standing behind me
at a suitable distance with Griselda in
your arms, and I shall say, ‘Perhaps
Your Majesties will allow me to intro-
duce to you my spouse and little one.’
Whereupon you, wearing that jolly hat
with little side wings that I like so
much "-I glanced at Eleanor to see
how this subtle compliment had been
received, and discovered her with chin
on her hand obviously paying no atten-
tion to what I was saying—“wearing
that hat with rooks' wings projecting
on each side which always attracts so
much attention,” I resumed fiercely
and was rewarded by a flicker of
Eleanor's eyelids, “will advance with
dignity towards the Royal party. It
might quite well happen,” I said,
“that they, observing the satisfactory
nature of our offspring, should confer
some suitable military or other dis-
tinction upon me.”
“I can't make up my mind,” said
Eleanor slowly, “whether to put
Griselda into short clothes to-morrow
or whether to wait till next month.”
But a quarrel was averted by our
daughter and, as we sometimes with
ill-founded optimism describe her, our
heiress. She had been asleep in my
arms for at least ten minutes, but now
awoke with small cries which developed,
as she observed my moustached and
still unfamiliar countenance, into a
consecutive wail.
“There, there—did she want her
mother, then 2" said Eleanor quickly
and, not without satisfaction, taking
her from me.
That, I find, is one of the great dis-
advantages of a family of three in its
initial stages. I am always the oppo-
sition, and my most flawless reasoning
is always crushed by that solid majority
of two. Dut Eleanor is generous in
victory.
“You’ll let me know in plenty of
time if the KING and QUEEN are really
coming, won't you?” she said, and
kissed me.
There was irony in that kiss, cer-
tainly; but I still think that there was
about it also a dash of something
which I had never noticed in similar
signs of recognition vouchsafed to me
before the War.

WHY, from the point of view of

look in vain to the ornithologists for
the reason. AUDUBON cannot tell me,
MoRRIs withholds the answer, and
Bowdler SHARPE is dumb. They can
be great on his changing waistcoat,
loquacious on his Winter song, and
even too informative for a sensitive
reader on his distressing habit of killing
his parents; but they leave the reason
of his passion for gardeners, his adora-
tion for woodcutters, a mystery. And
not only is the reason a mystery, but
the very presence of the bird is a
mystery too, for at one moment there is
not a robin within miles, and there at
the next, with the first prod at the earth,
with the first fall of the chopper, a red-
breast has materialised—saucy, saga-
cious, critical, vigilant.
It was, I fancy, DAN LENo who first
remarked that he loved work; he could
stand, he added, for hours and watch
men working. Many have said it since,
for low comedians are not too nice
about repetition, but DAN, I believe,
began it, and one almost thinks he got
it from a robin. For it is the robin's
ideal of pleasure—to watch men work,
and especially, as I say, gardeners and
woodcutters. That a gardener should
be popular is natural enough, for he
is continually turning over fresh mould
and revealing new and succulent articles
of diet; and yet I don't think the
robin's is cupboard love either. I have
observed a robin watching a gardener
for long periods and he has never
touched food; and the woodcutter's
toil is of course wholly unproductive
of nutrition. It must be on the robin's
part an honest liking for human society,
mixed with curiosity and possibly a
freakish pleasure in playing the fore-
man, the gaffer. Certainly no gaffer,
not even the most detested, ever did
less or surveyed more searchingly.
Let us then leave it as a blend of
inquisitiveness and friendliness; but
why the thrush is devoid of it, and
the sparrow and the goldfinch and the
wagtail, is a problem for the Gilbert
Whites of our day. These birds almost
equally haunt the lawn, but at the
first sight of man they are off.
One particular robin that I have in
mind is so fascinated by the spectacle
of the labourer, no matter in what
capacity, that to-day he actually paid
attention to me, who do no more than
drive a reluctant pen. I had occasion
to consult a book in a garden room, and
he observed me walking thither and fol-
lowed. The day for once being sunny
I left the door open; and in flew the
robin to see what on earth I could be
about. I reached down one volume,
he perched on another—a dictionary.
That displeasing him, he flew to a row
of DICKENs; from these to a new novel
on the table, then to a bust of JULIUs
CESAR, and again to LILLYWHITE's
Scores and Biographies. It was then
that I came away, the robin preceding
me by a couple of yards. All the way
back to the house he flitted about me,
so that I felt like an Italian prince I
once saw leaving Venice, after a civic
ceremony, in his motor-boat, escorted
by aeroplanes.
Half-an-hour later I chanced to go
into the kitchen, and there the robin was
again, watching the cook. Two persons
in so small a room being too much for
him, he made for the door, not in the
foolish panicky style of the ordinary
bird that has strayed indoors, but with
quiet precision.
And now I am wondering if science
that can do so much cannot utilise and
direct this remarkable gift of espionage.
Flitting silent as a spirit and resented
by no man, not even a German, what
valuable information a robin might
collect, and, crossed with a parrot, what
valuable information he might impart |

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
over fate of E. Jon Es, Member for
Merthyr-Tydvil. Has not for more
than a fortnight been seen in his usual
haunts, including House of Commons.
Rumoured he has accepted service
in ranks of Y.M.C.A. UNDER-SECRE-
TARY FoR WAR, pressed for information,
loſtily replied, “I do not represent the
Young Men's Christian Association in
this House.”
That made clear, committed
himself to statement that missing
Member had “gone to the Near
Last"—personal addresses neces-
sarily vague just now — under
auspices of the Association.
MARKHAM, always practical, sug-
gested that the vagrant should
be captured, brought home and
enrolled as a recruit under
Lord DERBY's scheme. Cold water
thrown on proposal by expression
of doubt whether the hon. Member
was “big enough round the
chest.”
Subject dropped. Member for
Merthyr left missing.
“Curious how phrases recur,”
mused the MEMBER FOR SARK.
“TENNANT protesting that he does
not represent the Young Men's
Christian Association (which he
might well do) recalls BoBBY
SPENCER's famous declaration
which, some time in the last
century, amused a crowded House.
Interposing in debate on a question
relating to wages of farm labourers,
BoPBY, dressed in height of fashion,
his lofty collar gleaming round his
stately neck, turned languid eyes
upon the SPEAKER, and remarked,
'Sir, I am not an agricultural
labourer.’”
Business done.—CHANCELLOR OF Ex-
CHEQUER moved Second Reading of
Bill authorising purchase of all suitable
American and Canadian securities held
in this country. Some criticism of de-
tails by financial experts. But Second
Reading conceded without dissent.
Tuesday.—Question of payment of
Members to the front again. On this
occasion Ministers roped in. CowAN

example appeals for personal sacrifice

emoluments of public servants, includ-
ing Ministers and private Members of
House of Commons, in receipt of salaries
exceeding £300 per annum.
House of Commons, Monday, Decem-
ber 13th.-Profound ſmystery broods
PREMIER wouldn't hear of such a
thing. Income of Ministers and Mem-
bers is, he said, taxed in common
with other classes of the community.
Pressed by succession of questions he
rose to full height of his commanding
personality. Unconsciously assuming
attitude reminiscent of AJAX defying
the lightning, he said, “I take my
salary and am going to continue taking
it.”
Great weight lifted from mind of
Members uneasily watching growth of
movement. If Ministers will not con-

should private Members be called upon
to illustrate their lectures on economy
and self-denial on part of general public
by relinquishing portion of the £400 a
year which they voted to themselves
in time of peace and prosperity?
Loud cheers supported PRIME MINIS-
TER in his heroic determination.
CowAN, now and later, had rather a
bad time with the Four-Hundred-
Pounders. His conversation with
PREMIER interrupted by apparently
irrelevant questions.
“Will the right hon. gentleman,”
one asked the PREMIER, “consider the
high profit of manufacturers of penny-
in-the-slot gas meters?”
Gas meters turned on again in course
of CowAN's speech on moving rejection
of Parliament Bill. Called to order
by SPEAKER with instruction to avoid
irrelevancy, he was entreated to “Put
another penny in the slot.”
Business done.—Bill extending life
of present Parliament passed second
reading without threatened division.
To this end BoMAR LAw contributed
powerfully persuasive speech.
House of Lords, Wednesday.—Lord
DERBY, rising this afternoon to reply
to question as to measure of success
attendant upon his Recruiting Scheme,
met with reception of warmth rare in
this chilly atmosphere. The superb
service he has done the State by strenu-
ous, unremitting, well-directed efforts to
bring men to the colours recog-
mised by Lord CREwB in brief
speech of graceful congratulation.
As LEADER of THE House said,
Lord DERBY is better fitted than
any other man for gigantic task
undertaken. Might have put it
that he is the only man willing
and able to do the work. His
personal qualities, his experience,
military and civil, his friendly rela-
tions with all classes throughout
the country, political and social,
combine to give him a unique
position. History will write many
glowing pages recording individual
achievements since the War began.
None is more splendid than that
of the man who succeeded in
stirring the nation to the pitch of
enthusiasm that makes possible
the placing in the field of a fourth
million of trained soldiers.
Business dome.—Bill to amend
Munition Act read a second time
in Commons.
Thursday.—ATTorNEY-GENERAL,
standing at Table to announce
on behalf of self and SoLICITor-
GENERAL voluntary relinquishment
of considerable portion of their
Ministerial income presented noble
figure to yearning eyes of almost
crowded House.
Whilst others have been talking
about self-sacrifice, with general tend-
ency, strongly marked, to press its
observance upon the favourable atten-
tion of their neighbours, the Law
Officers of the Crown have simply
achieved it. They save an exchequer
drained by unprecedented expenditure
for war purposes a joint sum amount-
ing to £10,000 a year. If that be not
enough they “are prepared to consent
to any reduction our colleagues in the
Government or the House of Commons
consider is required by the necessities
of the case.”
If this doesn't fetch the Four-Hun-

KITTY: A WAR PORTRAIT.
Four years ago, when down at Sheen,
I stayed with Hale, a college crony,
My godchild Kitty, just fifteen,
Lived mainly for her dogs and pony;
She was a cheerful, slangy kid;
She played a dashing game of hockey;
And everything she said or did
Was “rotten,” or “top-hole,” or
“rocky.”
Then Kitty took a studious line,
And sought to “petrify her tutors”;
She banned the British Philistine,
And sniffed at cricketers and shooters;
She read and acted in Greek Plays,
Discountenanced the social scurry,
And spent laborious nights and days
With Sophiocles and GILBERT
MURRAY.
Another year came swiftly round,
And, yielding to a primal passion,
Miss Kitty in the van was found
Among the votaries of fashion;
Her hair was up, her skirts were down;
She made a cult of modish follies;
And Pekinese of golden-brown
Supplanted her devoted collies.
Then came the War, and all the traits
Whose growth her elders were afraid of
| - - - -
Dislimned, revealing to our gaze
The real stuff that she was made of;
Rebuking, too, the cynic pens
That quoted the Virgilian notum
Quid possit femina furens,
And showing us the New Factotum.
With both her brothers at the Front,
Her father working at munitions,
She found the ancient pleasure-hunt
Repugnant to her new ambitions;
She cooked; she nursed; she sold her car;
She felt “more natural without it ";
She ran the house without a jar
And never made a song about it.
There was no stricken household near,
No home too intimate with sorrow,
But gathered from her words of cheer
Solace and strength to face the
morrow ;
And when the wounded saw her come
To sing them songs or write their
letters,
The grinding pains that grip and numb
Seemed to relax their cruel fetters.
So when I met the other day
This new, transformed, ennobled
Kitty
The gold had triumphed o'er the clay,
For pride was swallowed up in pity.
O woman, everlasting sphinx,
'Tis not the least of War's surprises
That from the ashes of a minx
A ministering angel rises!
A Christmas Tip.
“When you burst send to Blank's, New
Street.”—Advt. in “Worcester Times.”
From a Parliamentary report:-
“Mr. Cowan (L.) rising to move the rejec-
tion of the Bill . . . Mr. Thorne (turning to
Mr. Cown):—“Go on; turn on the gas-meter.
(Laughter.) Mr. Cowen (proceeding) . . .’”
Evening Paper.
It is a pity. Mr. Cohen is no longer in
the House, or he might have had a
hand in this coincidence.

of the Mayor and Corporation officially attend-
ing the Parish Church alive.”

up at the theatre.

number of useful questions to facilitate saving

matrimony.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO TOUCH THE WORKING
MAN'S POCKET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-You will have
gathered by this time that I never like
to be left out of any newspaper discus-
sion that is going on, and I wish to
assure you that I never put any restric-
tion upon the publication of my views.
You are quite at liberty to make any
use you like of my opinions upon how
the War Loan is to be introduced to
the Working Man. A lot of weighty
statements have already been made,
explaining to us the preferences of the
Working Man. There must, we are
told, be no fluctuations because he
doesn't like them, and no use of the
words per centum because he doesn't
understand them. There must be no
vouchers because he has nowhere to
keep them. There must be no distant
date of repayment because he won't
wait, and no conversion rights because
he distrusts them. Again, the amount
must be paid by instalments, so that
he may be led to confuse the thing
with furniture and goose-clubs. Fin-
ally—and this is crucial—(a) the money
must be collected in the works; (b) the
money must be collected in the home.
Such, Sir, is the current picture of
the Working Man. I cannot say that
I recognise him, but all the same I
think we might set to work to smooth
away these little difficulties and thereby
open a clear path to success.
We can, in the first place, stop fluc-
tuations once and for all by legislation
which shall nail the loan to perpetual
par. Anyone paying either more or
less can be stuck in gaol, under the
Defence of the Realm Act, for creating
undue depression or inducing undue
elation in the KING's subjects. No
difficulty there. Again, there need be
no trouble about the phrase per centum.
It need not be mentioned. A plain fact
should be stated in plain language. Let
our motto be, “A tanner on every quid
twice a year.” That should be printed
in bold type at the top of the scrip.
But this raises the question of scrip.
Paper must be avoided at all costs.
The Working Man distrusts paper. It
is altogether too handy as a pipe-light
when matches run short ; besides, if
he sticks it in a drawer, it is apt to get
down the back; besides, in any other
safe place the spring cleaning is certain
to find it out, and we cannot be sure
that the War will be over by the
Spring. But why, Sir, need we insist
on paper ? It is a mere convention.
The suggestion that the amount be
tattooed on the holder's arm I reject,
simply because, looking ahead to the
time when the issue is redeemed, I can
see no way out of it but amputation.

AT THE PLAY.
“WHO IS HE 2''
SEVERAL influences had contributed
to make an eccentric of Lord Twyford of
Twyford (alias “Mr. Parker”). There
was his parentage for one. His mother
(I follow his own account) was an
angel, and his father prematurely bald
with a cast in his eye. On the female
side he had inherited a taste for anony-
mous charity, which took the form of
penny buns stuffed with half-crowns
and distributed to hungry people under
cover of darkness. The optical defect
of the other parent (his premature bald-
ness does not seem to have exerted any
hereditary influence) was no doubt a
determining factor in the son's choice
of the microscope as a medium for
nature-study. But, apart from this
predisposition to a habit of life unusual
in a Peer of the realm, his mind had
been incidentally deranged by an un-
fortunate affair of the heart. His lady,
jealous of the microscope which came
between them, had jilted him in favour
of a cousin of his, and the expenses of
their elopement had been met by a
forged cheque drawn in the name of
the aggrieved party.
Obeying that instinct for secretive-
ness which was so excellent a feature
in his philanthropy, Lord Twyford had
fled from the ridicule of Society and
under an assumed name had sought
the shelter of obscure lodgings, from
which he only emerged at nightfall.
Here the smallness of his bag and the
tendency to inconsequence in his speech
(the result of mental shock) might
justly have roused suspicions; but the
vagaries of a ground-floor lodger, how-
ever limited his luggage and however
vague his explanations of himself, are
never too closely scrutinised so long as
he pays handsomely and in advance.
Unhappily, however, “Mr. Parker's "
escapade coincided with a Jack-the-
Ripper scare, and his most innocent
eccentricities (notably his nocturnal
largesse of buns) soon had a sinister
interpretation put upon them by a
vigilant police. The misunderstand-
ings that followed tended to develop
an atmosphere of general insanity, and
his landlady's behaviour, based upon a
conviction that all was not what it
should be in her lodger's head, fell
under a like suspicion on his part. In
the event, both his mind and the situ-
ation were cleared by the intervention,
respectively, of a new love and an old
solicitor, and all ended well along the
simple lines of homely melodrama.
The charm of a scheme that has an
eccentric for its leading character is
that it gives you all the fun of farce
without its cruder buffooneries. His
AN INTERRUPTED PROPOSAL.

(Mr. HENRY AINLEY) actually says, “Shut
that door,” but his lady-love understands
that “Je t'adore ” is intended.
somersaults are mental and not phy-
sical. He does not catch his toe in a
material tin-tack; he trips over a kink
in his brain. Of course, under favour-
able conditions his eccentricity is liable
to be infectious—to communicate itself
to those for whom nature had never
designed it; and before you can turn
round you are over the borderland be-
tween comedy and farce. But in respect

trives to starve gracefully in Grafton Street

of his protagonist the author can
always claim the perquisites of irre-
sponsibility. He can always say,
“This is a figure of comedy; just thus
and thus my creation would behave in
the life.” Which indeed is unanswer-
able, for here there are no precedents
to follow and no rules to break. It is
true that my lord, by a disappearance
which was bound to get into the papers,
must defeat his own desire to escape
ridicule; but then he is an eccentric.
True that, for an alleged woman-hater,
he falls rather rapidly in love with the
first woman he meets after his jilting;
but what would you? He is an eccen-
tric. . And we of the audience are just
as pleased as the author with this
transparent device; we love to flatter
ourselves that we have the good sense
to prefer comedy to farce.
Mr. AINLEY, as he proved in the
more serious and sustained effort de-
manded of him in The Great Adventure,
is our one man for this kind of part. It
was a marvel how many fresh tricks of
voice and gesture he had invented to
distinguish his new character from the
one in the earlier play that so nearly re-
sembled it in its broader features. His
personality was an irresistible delight;
but the success of the play—and he
would be the first to acknowledge it—
was not due to him alone; he owed
much to the services of Miss CLARE
GREET and Mr. FREDERICK Groves as
the lodging-house-keepers. Types of
a commonplace humanity not easily
diverted from its fixed orbit, they
both made an admirable foil to his
eccentricity, and their closely-observed
realism set from the start the right
key of comedy.
With the character of Irene Harding
neither Miss IRENE BRowNE nor the
author was quite happy. As for the
actress, she never looked the part of a
starved typist; the studied artistry of
her auburn chevelure and the expensive
simplicity of her frocks gave her a false
air. For the author, he put some very
indifferent talk into her mouth, and
constantly left her pendent in the
most embarrassing silences while he
busied himself with Mr. AINLEY. One's
sympathy is naturally prepared to go
out to any woman whose heart enter-
tains a Peer unawares, but we received
a very niggardly encouragement. And,
by the way, I venture to suggest that
Lord Twyford of Twyford a little mis-
laid his nobility when he thought it
necessary to administer so much spark-
ling Moselle to the lady in order to
bring her to the point of accepting
his hand.
The unimportance of these plaints
must be the measure of my apprecia-
tion.
I am not in a position to say

Mr. AINLEY in the way of giving me an
extremely pleasant evening. O. S
“THEY ALSO SERVE . . .”
AcRoss the orchard you can see
from my study window the entrance
to the “Green Man.” My wife is
always wanting to have trellis put up
to shut out the view.
“How should we ever know the
time?” has been my invariable reply.
You see every morning precisely
at eleven o'clock William, the sexton,
arrives at the entrance to the hostelry.
At a quarter past twelve Mrs. William
(I don't think William possesses a sur-
name) chases him out to come to
dinner. When I discovered William's
admirable punctuality I utilised him
to check our clocks. It became a habit
in our home to say, “You’ve plenty
of time for the train. The dining-
room clock is five minutes fast by
William.”
Even my wife recognised the useful-
ness of William, though with feminine
ingratitude she lectured Mrs. William
at the Mothers' Meeting on the ad-
vantages of temperance. Once Mrs.
William retaliated, “Ah, Mum, I see
you know what the 'orrors of drink
are in a 'ome.”
Months before London went dry in
the mornings our district was scheduled
by the Board and a stern decree or-
dained that no licensed premises should
open till twelve. The rule did not in-
terfere with me who have given up the
Hun lager which I drank in the happy
times of peace. But I thought with
horror of its effect on William.
At five minutes to eleven on the first
morning of the new order I was at
my window watching for William. I
wanted to see the effect of the mental
shock upon him. Could he break the
habit of a generation ? At ten seconds
to eleven he appeared in the road and
with his customary deliberation ap-
proached the door.
“Can it be possible that no one has
warned the poor old man?” I thought.
“What will he do when he finds that
friendly door closed ?”
I expected something superb in the
way of dramatic denunciation. To
my amazement William never even
tapped at the door. He placed himself
on the seat at the side of the porch and
waited there solemnly till twelve o'clock.
When he arrived the following morn-
ing at his usual time I went across to
speak to him.
“This new regulation is very trying,
William,” I said.
“Not a bit, Sir, not a bit,” replied
William cheerily.
“But you find it dull sitting here?”
“Not me, Sir. I'm goin' to show
that other William that 'owever 'e
tries 'e can't put me out o' my regular
ways. Thirty-five year 'ave I been
coming 'ere at eleven o'clock and no
"Un's goin' to upset me.”
“But you haven't time to get your
beer.”
“If a man's got the proper spirit,
Sir, 'e can manage it. Once it was
just sip, sip with me, now it's swaller,
swaller; and I gets my two pints in.
We're goin' to win this War and I
got to do my bit—and my bit means
no interference with reglar 'abits and
no grumblin'.”
When Parliament is sitting and I
have the blues about the War—strange
that I never have the blues whilst
Parliament is in recess—I look out
for William, and his confident advent
brightens my day. I see the determina-
tion in his face, and whatever the
Cabinet may do I know that our
William will wear out the person
he cuttingly alludes to as “the other
William.”

I.
MICHAEL's condition was atramental, of that there could
be no doubt. Nor was he surprised to discover that,
having walked due West since breakfast, which he had
preferred not to eat, for the bloater had reminded him too
poignantly of Lily's favourite supper dish, he was now
pointing East with a slight inclination to North. Would
his search never end ? He wondered vaguely how his
mother and his sister would greet him, in the improbable
event of his ever seeing them again in the fuliginous
atmosphere of Chelsea. Why had he said what he had
unquestionably said to both of them 2 Dulcedinous mem-
ories crowded tumultuously into his mind. He saw himself
again at Oxford buying first editions of WALTER PATER,
drinking port and eating crystallized fruit at the J. C. R., |
making hay in a bad man's rooms, and generally making
himself as disagreeable as possible to everybody he met.
Had he really been the self-conscious and conceited prig
that these memories pictured him as being 2 He supposed
so, and the hypothesis filled him with delight. And now
he lived with a murderer in Tosspot Street with a view
to discovering Lily and eventually to becoming a Roman
Catholic priest, after spending eight hundred pounds a year
in purchasing mansions in various parts of London. Life
was indeed a strange mixture. He shook himself and
proceeded with his walk.
II.
As Michael neared the Thieves' Kitchen where he pro-
posed to have his supper he became aware that someone
was following him, someone whose footsteps made a curi-
ous clippity - cloppity sound on the pavement. In a flash
Michael realised that it must be Philip who was thus pur-
suing him, and he turned round and confronted him.
“Look here,” said Michael angrily, “why do you follow
me like that 2 This is my beat, and I can't allow anyone
with a club foot to come dogging me as you do.”
Philip blushed deeply, which was a way he had when his
deformity was harshly alluded to.
“By what right,” he said bitterly, “do you presume to
keep me away? You're not the only person whose thoughts
and feelings matter. I know you're looking for Lily in all
the shy haunts of London. Well, I'm looking for Mildred
in the same places. Shall we search together?”
“If you like,” murmured Michael, too tired to resist as
he felt he ought to.
“Then,” said Philip, “I will first tell you the story of
my life in all its details.”
“And I,” said Michael, “will aſterwards tell you the
story of mine.”
“Agreed,” said Philip; “but I warn you not to be
shocked. I have some dreadful things to relate;" and he
told him how he had been born club-footed ; how he had
grown up and dabbled in painting in Paris without the
least success; how he had all but poisoned his uncle, who
had made a will leaving him his money; how he had nearly
starved in London and been an assistant in a dressmaker's
shop; and how he had betrayed the daughter of the friends
who had rescued him from starvation and given him food
and lodging in his misery. As he finished the first beams
of the rising sun had begun to touch the houses with a
golden glow and the furtive night-shapes were flitting back
to their dens. Michael had fallen into a deep silence, though
at the outset he had shown his usual tendency to interrupt.
At last he spoke.
“To-morrow,” he said, “if you will meet me at the same
place I will tell you my story. I too have suffered; great
God, how I have suffered!”—he brushed away his tears with
a bright movement of his hand—“and I find in you a
sympathiser, in spite of the terrible fact that you are a
medical student. No matter,” he added impulsively, “we
are both degenerates, and that is a great thing.”
“Yes,” said Philip, “it has made us what we are. You
with your club-footed mind and I with my club-footed foot,
we owe more than we can express to degeneracy. And
now let us pursue our search.” . .
They linked arms and moved, supperless but united,
towards the dawn. -

I've hollowed my back in the riding school,
Broken my neck and been damned for a fool,
Learnt to parry and point and guard
Till my arm was lead and my wrist went dead,
Wisped my fidgetting long-faced pard -
Till he shone with a silky shine;
Learning “how” in the Cavalry,
The jaunty, jingling Cavalry,
What rides on the right o' the line.
Now here am I like a blinded mole,
Toil in a furrow and sleep in a hole
Dug in a grave twelve foot by three,
My strappings bust and my spurs all rust
With nothing but two mud walls to see
Sluiced with a driving sleet—
Me that was in the Cavalry,
The saucy, swaggering Cavalry,
Slogging my two flat feet!
I thinks all day an' I dreams all night
Of a slap-bang, Tally-Ho open fight,
One good chance on the open plain,
Then knee to knee, like a wave of the sea,
We'll blood our irons again and again
In thundering squadron line;

THE BITTER CRY FOR BUTTER.
[The KAISER's edict forbidding all celebration of Christmas has
served to increase the despondency caused by the lamentable shortage
of butter, without which the life of a German woman is not regarded
as worth living.]
THE dying year goes out in gloom;
In vain the sodden bunting flaps;
In vain the Potsdam pedlars boom
Their novel line in Balkan maps;
Bare is the festal tree, and still
The breath of music, brass or oaten—
All joyance, by the War-Lord's will,
Being verboten.
And, where beneath her limes Berlin
Moves silent as a dumb golosh,
What is this wail that chokes within
The bosom of the female Bosch 2
What is this sense of something lost
Which, when they meet in solemn batches,
Makes an unmitigated frost
Of Kaffeeklatsches.
Is it by any chance a case
Of husband, brother, lover, son,
Far from his womankind's embrace
Doing his duty as a Hun ?
Is it the absent strafer's kiss

No, 'tis a dearer loss—they miss
Their slabs of butter.
O Teuton Fraus are brave, no doubt,
And at a pinch would stand to arms,
But simply cannot do without
The fatty source of half their charms;

You take from life its leading savour,
Those podgy waists by which they earn
Their warriors' favour.
Some day the nation's nerve may crack
(So straws will break a camel's hump)
Through local riots due to lack
Of means to keep its women plump;

That WILLIAM's world-compelling flutter
Shall yet be dislocated by
A dearth of butter.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXXII.
(From Mr. BENJAMIN TILLETT.)
KAISER,-You don't seem to understand the people of
this country—if you had understood them I daresay you
wouldn't have got yourself into the fix you're in—but any-
how I'll tell you a little story of what happened to me, and
then perhaps you'll begin to see light, as the parson says.
It was a year or two back and a nasty rainy day, and I
was travelling inside a 'bus. The conductor was a very
uppish young fellow—got a swelled head, no doubt, from
being put in what they call a position of authority—and
as he came into the 'bus to take the fares he trod on my
foot. I'm a little delicate about that foot and we got into
a bit of an argument. He seemed to think it was his foot,
and I knew it was mine, and there was quite a pretty lot
of back-talk flying about, when at last he ups and says,
“Who are you, anyhow 2" he says, “and what's your
blooming name?” I says, “My name's nothing to you,
but if you want it you shall have it. BEN TILLETT's my
name, and very much at your service, my young corn-
smasher.” Just as I said this a tall thin lady who was
sitting in the 'bus gave a shriek and got up to leave.
“Anything I can do for you, Ma'am 2 " I says; but she
|gave me a regular witherer and sort of fixed me to the
floor. “Unhand me,” she says—I hadn't laid a finger-
joint on her—“unhand me. I can't sit in a 'bus with a
firebrand. We shall all be murdered in our beds;" and
with that she stepped it in double-quick time. I never
laughed so much in my life, and the conductor was struck
all of a heap. That shows you what feelings were not so
very long ago. We were all scrapping with one another and
forgetting we were human beings at the bottom of it all.
But now, Lord bless you, we're singing a very different tune.
Why, I'd engage to let an Earl, ah, or a Duke either, tread
on my best corn so long as he was dressed in khaki or I knew
And
as for the tall thin lady if I'm not mistaken I saw her in
the front row at one of the meetings I addressed the other
day, and she was cheering like mad, and afterwards she
came up and shook me by the hand very warmly, and she
says, “Mr. TILLETT, you've said what wanted saying about
the KAISER and the Germans, and you make me proud to
be an Englishwoman. It's liberty we're fighting for, and
we're all prepared to die rather than submit to a bloated
tyrant.”
There you are, you see. War's a beastly thing—there's
no getting out of that—but it's made us one people. I've
seen how the soldiers are carrying on in the trenches, and
I've seen what we're doing at home in England, and I tell
you straight your game's up; you can't win the War.
And it's no good trying to think of stopping it just yet.
We haven't yet got our teeth far enough into your throat;
but there's a good time coming, and when it comes you'll
know it and no mistake.
So I send you the compliments of the season and hope
you won't deceive yourself any more. ... We're not cherish-
ing any illusions, as the saying is. We know what the
Prussian is; we’ve seen him at work on land and sea,
and we've made up our minds to send him back to the
lace where he belongs. -
Good-bye and bad luck to you.
Yours cheerfully, BEN TILLETT.

XXXII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Great excite-
ment prevails. A number of unex-
ploded shells have arrived, and at
present lie in the Camp Commandant's
Office. Somebody has insisted on
knowing what's inside them, adding,
in a chatty sort of way, that “all you
have to do is to knock the tops off and
use your common sense.” Ah, yes;
but who’s “you”. 2 The Chemical
Adviser has demonstrated very lucidly
that it isn't the Chemical Adviser. He
is quite ready to do his part, he says,
which is the latter part. Who is going
to do the first part? Ordnance, usually
very jealous of its privileges, is not
assertive on this occasion. The Quarter-
master branch is, for once, modest and
retiring. Intelligence is being peculi-
arly intelligent and is sitting tight;
Operations isn't for operating, and the
O.C. Sanitary Section is thanking
Heaven he isn't a real soldier. It looks
to me as if the Camp Commandant is
about to open yet another branch of
his flourishing business. At any rate
we have sent him a chit, entitled
“Shell-opening for Beginners: by one
who has managed to avoid doing it.”
The salient paragraph runs: “To re-
move lid : puncture by sharp blow
with dull instrument. If necessary,
prize open forcibly with chisel inserted
under band.”
You have heard it said, no doubt,
that battles would be good sport if it
wasn't for the shells, and you've heard
it added that even the shells are less
trying than the telegraphic messages
on minor matters which arrive at all
hours of the day and night to compli-
cate trench life. Thus, an ill-informed
French civilian applied for the recovery
of a packet of letters from an upstairs
room of his deserted house. Notwith-
standing the fact that the site of the
mansion was in the first line trenches,
the matter passed safely through all the
preliminary stages of transmission. The
inquiry, as it reached the trenches, was
not happily worded. After referring
in minute detail to the position in the
house of the upstairs room, the position
in the upstairs room of the cupboard,
the position in the cupboard of the little
green box, and the position in the little
green box of the bundle of letters, it
concluded with the ingenuous question:
“Is the house standing still?” The
reply arrived with unusual speed.
“Most of the house,” it ran, “ has
removed, but that part which is still
standing is standing still.”
Again, a unit, having with some tact
and address secured a German soldier
from over the way, extracted from him
the information that lots more would
come over with a little encourage-
ment. Forthwith the unit was asked
somewhat curtly to state if any steps
had been taken to encourage same, and,
if so, what? With all the respect and
submission which could possibly be
packed into a telegram, the Company
Commander concerned begged to report
that “he had procured a gross (144)
native sausages and had suspended
them on the barbs of the barbed wire.
Favourable winds awaited.”
Lastly, there was some to-do further
behind the lines about the nocturnal
visits of an aeroplane, of which the
dut-dut-dut-dut-dut was distinctly
heard, and of which the conduct was
rendered all the more suspicious by the
fact that nothing ever seemed to come
of it. The matter was ordered to be
inquired into; a patrol, suitably armed,
was demanded for all-night watching
from the local battalion at (alleged)
rest. They went out, and the first thing
in the morning their report was re-
ceived. There could be no doubt about
the truth of the allegations; the dut-
dut-duts were indubitable. That they
were produced by an aeroplane was also
beyond question; the unmistakable
sound had been heard of its horn being
blown as it went round the corners.
It is the habit of people when hostile
aeroplanes are seen hovering to say to
each other, “Now I do hope there isn't
going to be any unpleasantness.”
Talking of which I might as well tell
you of the local frightfulness in which
I am at this moment involved. I re-
turned this evening to headquarters to
find a hubbub in progress. One of the
Greatest Ones is scheduled to deliver a
technical lecture, and all the less great
ones are scheduled to listen. Most of
them have run into one part or another
of my motor bicycle, and I do not
begin my share in this story with any
large margin of popularity. Eventually
I find myself in the office. Three tele-
phones start ringing at the same time;
three magnates proceed to detail three
totally different programmes of what
is to happen to the lecturer when he . .
arrives. The telephones have just been
got to lie down and keep quiet for a bit,
when he himself blows in. Having had
a judicious mixture of the three pro-
grammes put to him by me, he invents
a fourth, to which he gives first place,
and leaves me to settle things up with
the other candidates. Meanwhile he
thinks he'd like me for a guide.
I am just starting out when two of
the telephones, growing suspicious,
begin ringing violently. The obvious
course is for him to silence one while
I soothe the other; instead of which I
deal with both and at the same time
maintain my conversation with him
very deferentially as becomes a subal-
tern. No. 1 telephone wants to know,
Sir, whether it would be convenient for
me, Sir, if it came round to see me, Sir,
and, if so, at what time, Sir? Being
informed as to who I am, it changes
its tone and says it's coming round at
once, and if I am not there to meet it
I'm finished. No. 2 telephone refers
to my X.Y.Z. 1 and its A.B.C. 2, and
my X.Y.Z. 3, and asks me if I mean
anything by my last, and if so, what?
It must know at once and will hold on
while I find out. Meanwhile my dis-
tinguished guest is getting fidgety, not
finding my remarks at all enlightening.
So we leave No. 2 grimly holding on,
pretend not to notice that No. 3 is
waking up, and go outside to find that
his motor, with his chauffeur and all
that is his, has disappeared into the
void. Thither I follow it, alone, realizing
as I go, with a cold sinking feeling,
the picture of the three magnates
expecting three totally different pro-
grammes to function.
When I find the car the chauffeur
is, of course, absentee. When I find
the chauffeur and the car and get the
two back to where I left the owner, he,
of course, is gone. Not daring to go
back into the office for fear of telephone
bells, I get hold of a sentry, armed
with a rifle and 150 rounds of ball
ammunition, and set him to mount
guard over the chauffeur and the car
and to take immediate action if either
of them tries to escape. I then retire
apart and evolve in my own mind a
fifth programme, on the basis of what
any humanly constituted man would
have done, if there hadn't been so
much arranging. Finally (to omit for
your sake many further harassing
details) I return to find that a sixth
programme, cancelling all previous
programmes, has come into force, the
exact details of which are, I gather,
SECRET.
For the present I am left in undis-
puted possession of a large motor car
and a small chauffeur. For the future
... who knows 2 . Meanwhile there
are others greater than myself to
answer the telephones. At this mo-
ment, as I write, one of these terrors
has started ringing again. The Major,
who's talking to it at this end, isn't
best pleased when the fact comes out
that the man at the other end is an-
other mere lieutenant, who only wants
to have a little friendly chat with me.
The chat, conducted in public, was
not so friendly as all that. He wanted
to know if there was any chance of
ever seeing me again. “Damn all,” I
replied, and rang off.
Yours ever, HENRY.

Tommy (on his way back from the trenches—to General's chauffeur). “TAKE 'ER 'oME, CHAwles. WE’RE walkis'.”
FERGUSON.
Ferguson has just returned to us
from an enjoyable holiday spent in
what I am constrained to refer to as
“a fortress” situated somewhere con-
tiguous to the Eastern Counties of
England. Already, exact details of
his imaginary adventures have begun
to snowball their mendacious course
through the village. I have no scruple
about repeating them, for I know
Ferguson to be a satirist and suspect
him of being a Scot.
We have a local witticism to the
effect that teaching a duck to quack is
labour “dra'd away in vain.” From
what I know and don't know about
Ferguson I feel that ingenuity spent
in connecting his reputation with the
desultory expenditure of very occasional
sixpences is also labour dra'd away in
vain. Put in another way, and one
perhaps better suited to the require-
ments of the superficial reader, I con-
tend that something over ninety-nine
per cent. of the girds at Ferguson are
composed by their alleged victim and
circulated solely to afford him the
peculiarly Caledonian amusement of
laughing at us laughing at him being
laughed at by someone else. I hope
you follow.
There is the account of Ferguson
obtaining lodgings. With some little
trouble he discovered a small room
right at the top of a house kept by a
very worthy person of marked religious
tendencies. As the house itself stood
almost within the shadow of one of
our most sacred and irreplaceable public
buildings, the situation had, as the
good lady readily admitted, some slight
disadvantage just at that period. People
were not really nervous, she hastened
to add, but they all seemed to prefer
the basement to the attics. Ferguson
gravely assented—even enlarged a little
on the drawback—but suggested that
a thrifty and verra courageous man
might face the risk at a materially
reduced rent. Terms were agreed upon.
Then, and not till then, did it come
out that the modest fellow, combin-
ing patriotism with pleasure, and at
the same time covering all his holiday
expenses, had been taken on as a short
nightly relief at a convenient munition
factory. His hours for sleep would be
from 3 A.M. to 10.
This is mere bludgeoning. I prefer
the rapier-like malice of the theatrical
experience. At which theatre it took
place nothing short of a strictly legal
indemnity against any action for dam-
ages could drag from me. Tears stood
in Ferguson's eyes, beads of perspira-
tion on his brow, as he spoke of
the long-drawn agony of witnessing
the performance. Misled—heaven help
him 1–-by a specious title, he had
thought to witness a really serious
play, and it turned out to be a con-
fection of the lightest and most
frivolous description. Not to censure
too heavily in the light of what fol-
lows, it must be understood that Fer-
guson, himself a highly moral man,
considered that he had been defrauded
by false pretences.
It was a matinée performance, I
gathered, and there were three Acts.
At the end of the first Ferguson made
his way to the gallery pay-box and
offered, as a great bargain, to com-
pound for the remainder of the enter-
tainment by the return of fivepence.
This offer, it appears, was declined.
“But "–Ferguson's vigorous tone

ness—“aa got even wi' them after a’.”

The Corporal would arrange for him-
self and the older gunners to be off

found it would be Henry's night on.
Nevertheless I felt there would be
something lacking. I was convinced
that a parcel of food, tobacco and cigar-
ettes, including a box of cigars, for the
officers, would help enormously.
I had another happy idea: a letter of
good wishes. Some two night watches

“To twelve (12) British boys, wishing
them a Happy Christmas and hoping
they will soon get abroad, from a few
others similarly situated.”

spoil the whole thing by sending an

distributing it there and then.

“They needn't see it; the parcel will

“What are you going to do with

“Frame it,” I said rather shortly.
Henry didn't seem to be entering into
the spirit of the thing. However, I
was determined to see the matter
through. I spent a whole afternoon's
leave and two days' pay and arrived
back laden and triumphant.
Henry by this time had changed his
opinion and on the morning of Christ-
mas Eve together we made the parcel up.
I addressed it to the O.C., A.A.
Detachment, 3rd South Wessex, Rock
Hill, and called for the Mess waiter.
“You can't give it him to post,”
Henry objected; “if he sees the address
he'll think we're mad.”
“Henry,” I said, “need I remind
you a soldier never thinks? He obeys.”

I was the author of the business,
and naturally I was the one to receive
the blame, but, as I pointed out, Henry
being the senior, I was, anyhow, the
only one who could be blamed.
The Mess waiter had not thought us
mad. He had merely thought we had
- made a mistake, and that the
parcel was intended for the
other 3rd South Wessex A.A.'s
at Hill Grove.
So he altered the address.
Technically this is known as
initiative.
I forget what I called it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RESPECT FOR THE CLOTH.
TARING us altogether we are a serious
Mess. As a whole at table we are not
demonstrative. Groups of young subal-
terns in obscure corners do, it is true,
abandon themselves to occasional bursts
of hilarity; and where the great ones
sit there are quite audible sounds of
respectful laughter when the P.M.C. or
the C.O. is in exceptionally good form.
But ordinarily we do not express our-
selves as a body. • .
To-night there was an exception.
When the bugle sounded “Officers'
wives have puddings and pives” and
we filed into the long hut, there were
exclamations of delighted astonishment
which grew rapidly into a tumult of
applause. There were clean table-
cloths.
That sounds rather as though we
have been accustomed to pigging it;
- but it isn't so. The fact is that a
recent moving of camps has landed us
many miles from the nearest laundry,
and the linen which should have been
on our tables has been elsewhere.
For two or three days one may pass
such matters by unobserved. But
gradually we began to take notice. We
began to recognise spots and stains,
and at first there was a certain excite-
ment about speculating as to their
origin. We began to see in them a
kind of diary of past meals. We re-
called, almost with a smack of the lips,
the roast-pork of Tuesday's dinner; we
found traces of the chutney which had
been eaten with the curry of Thursday's
lunch ; there were marks of the efforts
of a certain O.C. Company—a sturdy
eater—to draw his full fourteen-ounce
ration from a bony segment of loin of
mutton. It was the sic ibat Simois
sort of thing, and we were getting to
love the old cloth for association's sake,
and to look forward to seeing it again
at every meal.
You must understand that in the
circumstances in which we are placed
such things may occur. The spirit of
active service is over everything.
Somehow it is easier than it would be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“CUT THE CACKLE . . .”
THE PHRASE AND ITS MAKER.
AFTER a recent visit to the House of
Commons—the second time only that
I had listened to that assembly at
work—I have come again to the con-
clusion that few of the sententiae of
the world have more virtue than old
ASTLEY's growled command to his stage
manager, “Cut the cackle and come
to the 'osses.” There is hardly a
moment of the day when this rule of
life could not profitably be remembered.
Every child should work it on a sampler
and read it on its mug ; copy-books
should prefer it to the usual run of
more arguable maxims; patriotic pluto-
crats should pay for its insertion at the
top of The Times' personal column; and
wherever there is an empty space on
hoarding or wall, in omnibuses or tubes,
it should be emblazoned in letters of
gold. In all French railway carriages
to-day the passengers are warned by
Government placards to be silent and
suspicious, for the ears of the enemy
are everywhere; so that “Taisez-vous !
méfiez - vous " has become a catch-
phrase in that country where catch-
phrases have ever prospered. ASTLEY's
immortal sentence should be equally
popular here, for never was the recog-
nition of its importance more necessary.
Entertaining such feelings as these
with regard to the dictum, I natu-
rally wished to know more of the
man who gave it life, so I have been
inquiring into PHILIP Astley's career.
To Newcastle-under-Lyme belongs the
honour of his birth, in 1742, his father
being a cabinet-maker there. At the
age, however, of seventeen (which
would horrify some of our head-masters,
however much it pleased others,) the
boy turned his back on chisel and plane
and enlisted in General ELLIoTT's
Light Horse, became remarkable as a
rough-rider and breaker-in, and so dis-
tinguished himself at the battles of
Ensdorf and Friedberg that his Gen-
eral presented him with a favourite
charger. With this noble companion,
known as the Spanish Horse, ASTLEY
toured England, to exhibit the tricks
that he had taught him, which com-
prised unsaddling himself, washing his
feet, removing a boiling kettle from
a flaming fire, and impersonating a
waiter at a tavern. Never had a
man a better friend. The Spanish
Horse (to anticipate a little) remained
in Astley's service for forty-two years,
and, on passing to ASTLEY's successor
at the Royal Amphitheatre, was care-
fully tended, two quartern loaves a day
being provided for a toothless mouth
that could no longer manage corn; and
when death at last came, his hide (in
order to perpetuate his memory) was
tanned and made into a thunder drum
for the prompt side of the theatre.
From touring AstLEY turned to cir-
cus and theatre management in London,
and, with various ups and downs of for-
tune, he continued in this business to the
end, both in London and Paris, though
on the breaking out of the French Rev-
olution he again joined the army, under
the Duke of York, and not only fought
but was invaluable as a horse-transport
officer. He behaved also in a way that
marks him out especially as a forerunner
of present-day methods, for he was
thoughtful as to supplies of clothing
and other comforts to the troops. In
the words of one who knew him :
“When he left this country he took
with him a very large strong chest,
with bits of broad-cloth, thread, needles,
leather, bristles, wax, in fact everything
useful in camp in that way; besides
five hundred flannel jackets, and at the
corner of each of them was sewed in a
shilling, that in case they [the soldiers]
should be in want of money for re-
freshment they would know where they
might find a ‘friend in need." Previous
to its being got together, like a good
tactician he called his company to the
theatre and asked them what they
would yield as contents for the chest ?
The ladies instantly offered their ser-
vices in making the jackets, which was
received very good-naturedly.”
After this campaign he was back at
his amphitheatre, which was then on
the site of the Lyceum Theatre, in time
to dress in the Windsor uniform and
sit his horse at the door of his esta-
blishment when the KING and Duke of
York rode by in triumphant procession.
The DUKE and Mr ASTLEY saluting each
other, “the King was pleased to say
to his son, ‘Who is that, Frederick?'
to which his Royal Highness immedi-
ately replied, ‘Mr. Astley, Sir, one of
our good friends, a veteran, one that
fought in the German war." Upon
this the King turned towards Mr.
Astley and made a most courteous
assent to him.” The incident, the
chronicler continues, was “a theme of
exultation to Mr. Astley, and it was
constant in his remembrance for a
long while.”
Mr. Astley's house of entertainment
was famous not only for horses but for
the gigantic spectacles which he devised
and elaborated. Among his inventions
I rather fancy that “real water" has
to be included.
In his circus he reigned supreme, a
vain and choleric martinet, who was,
however, beloved by his employees.
In all his adversity—and through fire
alone he had more than his share—he
remained steadfastly honest. His
name throughout England became
synonymous with whatever was most
daring and exciting in horsemanship.
Not only the best showman, but the
best horse-tamer of his time, he never
gave more than five pounds for a horse,
nor did he care what colour, shape or
make it was: temper was his only con-
sideration. But when he had done
with the horse fifty pounds probably
could not buy it.
A contemporary account of the great
man by one of his company, which I
have already quoted from, calls him
“very facetious and liberal.” It adds
that “he was obstinate at times and
would not give up his opinion to anyone,
but very forgiving the moment after.”
He was inclined (like so many auto-
crats) to be a little deaf now and then.
Riding was not his only accomplish-
ment. “One day, for a considerable
wager, he floated on his back in the
Thames, from Westminster Bridge to
Blackfriars, with a flag erect in each
hand.” Brave times | None of our
theatrical managers—neither Mr. BUTT
nor Mr. DE Courville — does these :
sporting things nowadays.
AsTLEY died in Paris in 1814, and
was buried in Père-la-Chaise. His son
“Young AstDEY,” who had long
assisted and then succeeded him, lived
only for seven years after, and Père-la-
Chaise guards his dust too.
The great PHILIP Astley built al-
together nineteen amphitheatres; and
what the old fellow's ghost can think
when he visits London now and finds
not a single circus for all her millions
(many of them children), who shall say?
'Twixt revue and revue no room for a
horse to put even his nose in Could
his reflection be other than that we
have cut the 'osses to come to the
cackle?
“An ‘R.T.O.," as a railway transport
officer is commonly termed, does more work
than any other two officers put together and
under far more trying conditions. His day
begins at cock-crow and, if he is lucky, ends
at the same time the next morning. But he
is not often lucky, and the result is he may
be kept on the go for a few additional hours.”
- Morning Paper.
The only time he gets ahead of his
work is when his superior officer kicks
him into the middle of next week.
From a notice of The Faithful,
Mr. MASEFIELD's new play:-
“If this play is not the equal of ‘The
Silver Box' and some others of his works, it
will have to be considered in the final estimate
of Masefield's place in our literature.”
Morning Paper.
Mr. GALsworthy, we understand, is
now wondering whether he should rest
his poetical reputation on Dauber.

AUNT'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
ABBREVIATIONS AND A MoTTo.
For the elucidation of military
mysteries, this treatise is written to
assist those estimable ladies who have
given their nephews to the service of
K. and C.
Motto.—When in doubt send tobacco.
Abbreviations.— Previous acquaint-
ance with the following is assumed :—
C.O., N.C.O., O.C., A.O.C., P.C., A.P.C.,
D.C.M., G.C.M., L.C.M., W.O., T.O.,
| M.G.O., D.P.O., G.P.O., H.O.
C.S.M.–A fierce misanthropist, who
made the British Army what it was,
not what it is, and who is justly jealous
for its future. Men reassure themselves
with the thought that he cannot eat
them; but they hate to be victims of
the partial success that attends his
efforts. On approaching the C.S.M. a
man halts rigidly at attention, says,
“Sir,” blushes by numbers (One—give
the blood a smart cant up to the facial
capillaries; Two—cut it away sharply),
and makes his request. There is an
interval of some minutes, during which
the man carries on with blushing,
judging his own time. Then he re-
peats, “Sir, may I—” “No 1" says
the C.S.M., and they carry the man
away.
M.O.—A callous officer, who heals
the sick and makes the lame to walk,
even when they can hardly limp. Sol-
diers with ailments report to him, and
he marks them “Medicine And Duty,”
using only the initial letters, as he is a
rude man. Then he explains that, there
being no medicine available, only the
latter part of the remedy is at their
disposal. He is the Great Disillusion.
O.O.-The officer who sees that the
rations are served and satisfactory.
There is a scheme to replace him by a
leaflet, printed, “If you are satisfied
tell your friends; if not tell us.”
This
would serve also as a recruiting agent,
and, for convenience, might be indexed,
The
O.O. may not accept a gratuity.
SEcoRD Loots.-No reference to later
enterprises of the CRowN PRINCE; but
the name applied by sisters and fiancées
to that vast crowd whose rank is de-
noted by a solitary star. Late 1915
models may still be obtained, new or
hardly used at all.
C.Q.M.S.—The man who proves by
algebra that soldiers are entitled to less
pay than they expect. “What about
your H.9731, and your B.C.55, and
your U.8?” he says; and, being unable
to solve even the simplest simultaneous
equation, they depart with sorrow and
regret. -
Punctilious Officer. “DoN'T You KNow THAT You MUST salute AN officer 2"
Irecruit. “YEs, SIR ; BUT I was ToI.D NEveR To Do IT witH A PIPE IN MY MoUTH.”
T.N.T.-An ingenious discovery hav-
ing a remarkable elevating influence
which is found to be of great service
in assisting Germans to leave their
trenches. It may also be used to
remove superfluous hairs.
C. 348-A piece of paper divided
laterally, with an unpleasant request
on the left-hand side and a blank space
on the right. Officers of the rank of
captain and above fill in the space with
“Passed to you for necessary action,
please,” and send it on to a subordinate.
O.S.E.-In summer camps an officer
of omnicidal tendencies is appointed
Officer Strafing Earwigs. Were this
under W.O. authority the third initial
would be W. for “Wigs, ear.” A sug-
gestion in “Insecticide Instructions,
1915,” is based on the earwig's well-
known propensity for climbing. A pole
of infinite length is erected; the little
|creatures make for the upper extremity
and are never seen again.
Another Impending Apology.
“At the Hotel Riposo, with Captain —
absent on active service, nothing is left to be
| desired.”—Berhill Chronicle.
Under the heading, “An Excusable
Error,” an evening paper last week
printed the following:—
“The following correction of a telegram
was sent out to-day by a news agency:-
In Christiania telegram sent you to-day
please read:—
“Mr. Ford's peac expedition' instead of
“Mr. Ford's peace exhibition.’”
To us the correction seems quite inex-
cusable. Poor Mr. Ford wants to put an
| end to war, not to take the end off peace.

To advertise my loathing of any low-class art,

Matched with orchestral music, as mere melodic swipes.

Denounced as inartistic their everlasting drone;
Denied that those who played them required the slightest

And held that their aesthetic significance was nil.
But time brings his revenges, and age the truth discerns,
Or, as the ancient proverb remarks, “one lives and learns”;
And I, who scorned the piperas one who squealed and crowed,
By way of recantation now pen this palinode.
We praise, most incorrectly, the piping times of peace,
But O it is in war-time that piping should increase;
For then no decent Briton—I leave the freaks alone—
Can hear unthrilled the music that from the pipes is blown.
I lounge up to the window when bands and soldiers pass,
Drawn by the lure of bugles, of drums and fifes and brass;
I hurry there like lightning when it's a kilted throng,
And at their head the pipers stride valiantly along.

They tell of ancient battles, forgotten, far-off things;
Of grief and death and glory, until the pageant glows
With memories of WALLACE, of BRUCE and of MoxTRose.

foam;
The flaning pall of sunset that glows on Suilven's dome;
The bracken and the heather, the clover and the broom—
All haunt the vision woven by music's fairy loom.
Back to the lonely shieling beneath the cloudy skies,
To strath and glen and corrie the yearning spirit flies;
For all the Highland glamour and all the Highland pride
Lives in these poignant measures, enshrined and glorified.
So when I find in Java diverging racial types,
United by their common allegiance to the pipes,
Remitting to old Scotland close on two hundred pounds
To foster the production of patriotic sounds,
I'm not surprised or prompted to talk of zeal misplaced,
Or call their contribution good money gone to waste,
But deeply moved at finding Armenians and Chinese
And Dutch combined to cheer us in trying times like

For, though I'm but a Cockney and know that in my

There's little blood deriving from any Gaelic strains,
I feel I'd merit beating with many bitter stripes
If I had failed in paying my homage to the pipes.

TOAST IN WAR-TIME.
CHAPTER I.
A wistful subaltern sat in the mess-
hut at breakfast. The rain poured
down unceasingly and ran musically
off the tin roof. He stared at the slice
of anaemic-looking A.S.C. bread he had
cut, and thought of toast—hot toast,
Yº..." crisp and divinely brown.
Toast for breakfast! He took up his
slice of bread and buttered it sadly.
CHAPTER II.
After breakfast he wrote in the Mess
Suggestion Book: “It is suggested that
toast be supplied for breakfast."
After some time the Mess Secretary
wrote on the opposite page: “This is
impossible owing to lack of accommo-
dation in the kitchen.”
CHAPTER III.
For many mornings he ate his de-
pressing bread in sadness; then an
inspiration came to him. He wrote
again in the Suggestion Book: “It is
suggested that toasting-forks be sup-
plied in the Mess.” He pictured him-
self squatting in front of the fire on a
cold morning making that pale expanse
of bread divinely brown. He waited
eagerly for the Mess Secretary's answer,
and was chilled to find written under
his request for toasting-forks: “What
for 2 " But, with a gleam of irony, he
wrote underneath, “To toast with,”
and smiled gladly. The smile faded
when he found written neatly under-
neath his ingenuous irony the single
word, “Where?” Still undaunted he
appended the necessary explanation:
“At the stove.”
He waited again for this to bear fruit,
and was himself noticeably brighter
for the new interest which he found in
his days. The answer, however, was
not reassuring. “As it is a coke stove
in the Mess at present, I am afraid you
would not be successful.”
CHAPTER IV.
He tried a fresh line of attack. “It
is suggested that coal instead of coke
be supplied for the Mess.” But here
he was on perilous ground. The answer
came swift and decisive: “This touches
on the Quartermaster's department,
and is out of my province.”
Feeling that the Mess Secretary was
“one up" on him, he interviewed the
Quartermaster. “Coal? What's the
use of indenting for coal for a grate
which is made for coke, and burns
better with coke? If you can have the
stove changed, I'll get you some coal.
You 'd better see the R.E.”
He saw the R.E. man, who was a
friend of his, but nothing could be
done without the G.O.C.'s permission.
“You’d better write out an application
and put it in through me.”
He went back to his quarters and
began to write. He had begun the third
copy, for it had to be sent in in tripli-
cate, when he started to think.
After all, toast seemed a very difficult
thing to obtain. It would only lengthen
the War. He tore up his letters.
CHAPTER W.
A wistful subaltern sat in the mess-
hut at breakfast. The rain poured
down unceasingly and ran musically
off the tin roof. He stared at the
slice of anaemic-looking A.S.C. bread he
had cut and thought of toast—hot
toast, wonderfully crisp, divinely brown.
Toast for breakfast ! He took up his
slice of bread and buttered it sadly.

“CoN-Found YoU

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
READERs who expect biography to be spiced with gossip
and flavoured by anecdote will find little to suit their tastes
in The Life of Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal (CAssell).
Mr. BECKLEs WILLsoN has given us a monumental book,
and if we are compelled occasionally to think that he treats
Lord STRATHCONA more as an institution than as a man I
for one am in the end bound to admit that his method is
justified by its results. After reading these 600 pages I
have not a very intimate knowledge of Lord STRATHconA
himself, but I do know thoroughly the work he accomplished,
and Mr. WILLsoN may well say that the work is the
man. What everyone knows from mere hearsay of
Lord STRATHCONA is that he played a wonderful part in the
development of Canada, that he was extraordinarily generous,
and that he lived to a very ripe old age; what perhaps is
not widely realized is that the thought always at the back
of his mind was to bind the British Empire closer and
closer together for self-support. That was his vision, that
was the poetry of a life strenuously lived among business
men and the atmosphere of business. When at the age of
seventy-six, after years of devoted toil, Lord STRATHconA
(then Sir DoNALD SMITH) was appointed High Commissioner
of Canada in 1896, one of our ex-Cabinet Ministers apparently
had never heard of him, and certainly did not know his
Christian name. “Who,” he wrote, “is this Sir David Smith
who is to replace our old friend Tupper?” In the end
honours fell fast to the lot of this gallant veteran, and
to-day, when we are all Imperialists at heart, we have to
thank him very largely both for the spirit of Canada and
for the splendid way in which she has been able to make
that spirit manifest.
I make a guess (it's dull of me not to be certain) that
the title of The Accolade (SIDGwick, AND Jackson) had
something to do with clever philandering Johnny Ingestre's
victory over himself when that tenderly passionate and
innocent maid, Helena Falkland, surrendered her heart to
him so completely. He had been jockeyed by a criminally
obstinate father into an early marriage with the wholly
unsuitable Ursula, but he never claimed that the real
thing when it came justified the breaking of all other
pledges and many other people's happiness. Such knights
are rare in modern fiction, and Johnny, who was the very
opposite of a prig, but an odd bundle of whims, vanities,
gifts and ambitions, and whose particular desire it was to
throw over all the rather solemn swagger of the Ingestre
tradition for the freer glories of the stage (his father dished
that business also), is a character drawn with the uncanny
cleverness, and subtlety, which the author of Herself so
consistently achieves. If I have a grievance against Johnny
it is that he found time to carry on such a delicate flirta.
tion with Violet Shovell, née Ashwin. I feel that if
Mrs. Shorell was going to allow anyone to flirt with her
it might very well have been me, who met her in Duke Jones
and fell desperately in love. So far I have very properly
let concealment feed on my damask cheek. But I am
sorely tempted to a paragraph in that indiscreet column of
The Times. . . . The fact is that Helena and Violet are
really perfect dears. Pray let me introduce you.
Still the War books come; and not in single spies. But

however dense their battalions there should, I am sure, dislike and despise Toby Settringham. You cannot judge him
remain room and a warm welcome in our hearts for the
one I have last read, the title of which is With My
Regiment (HEINEMANN), and its author a young officer who
discreetly signs himself “PLAToon CoMMANDER.” . His
volume, which has at least the classic excuse of being a
little one, is published at the pleasantly economical price
of three-shillings-and-sixpence, and from cover to cover
is filled with most vivid and well-realized pictures of the
early days of the War, as they presented themselves
to the writer. That is the special value of the book,
that it gives in detail just those impressions that the
stay-at-home watchers of Platoon Commanders most
wish to receive; to read it is to share every experience
(almost) in the life of a lieutenant on active service, from
the day when he hurriedly joined at the outbreak of War,
to that on which the Hospital Ship welcomes him, as a cot-
case, to her tender ministrations. But the book is not only
of interest for its descriptions of campaigning. Into his sub-
ject, arma virosque, the writer introduces many incidental
portraits of the men who - - - - -
are making our War, of ºr
fellow - officers, the re- .
sourceful company com-
mander, or the junior sub.,
fresh from Sandhurst,
facing unmitigated horror ||
with the quiet heroism of
a boy and a gentleman; ;
of certain N.C.O.'s in
whom a deserved tribute
is paid to a magnificent
body; and finally of the
best private soldiers in
the world. “The men are

He is such a good chap. You feel
all the time that he will wake up and be ashamed of himself,
and then he will prove his real worth ; and of course this
is what happens. I was a little sorry that Madame ALBANESI
fell back on the old device of the birth of a child to bring
about the reconciliation of Toby and his wife, but I suppose
the temptation was irresistible; and, after all, it is probably
what would have happened in real life. Madame ALBANESI
has the knack—achieved by virtue of her admirably natural
dialogue—of making the reader feel that he is reading about
living people. She uses no wood in the manufacture of her
characters. Toby Settringham is so alive that he becomes
a personal friend on the second page; and Oscar Beel is, I
think, the only moneylender I have met in fiction who
gave the impression of being able to walk and talk without
active support and prompting on the author's part.
Among the many things that—without wishing to argue
about the reason—I have clung to from my youth up is a
- tender feeling for pirates,
and I am not at all grate-
ful to Mr. LovaT FRASER
* for trying to rob me of
£º this cherished possession.
ſº Yet Pirates (SIMPKIN,
tº MARSHALL) is garbed, as
it should be, in a garish
cover; it contains “decora-
tions” by Mr. FRASER that
would thrill a cod-fish; its
mere title is enough to
stir the blood of the
most anaemic. Moreover
|Pirates has a delightful
|history, for it appears
that it reproduces The
History and Lives of all
the most Notorious Pirates
and their Crews, the fifth

printed in 1735, and that

of a larger work by Cap-
tain CHARLEs Johnson,

relations or friends at the West Front, and more especially
the parents, sisters, cousins and aunts of Platoon Com-
manders, should make a point of reading.
I do not know which to admire more, the courage of
Madame ALBANESI in sitting down to write a long novel
with a hero whom only the most skilful handling could
make sympathetic, or the art with which she has triumphed
over this obstacle. She has set herself one of the most
difficult tasks which the art of fiction presents to those who
practise it, and, in the expressive American phrase, she has
“got away with it." One of the most rigid rules governing
fiction is that the hero, whatever his other defects, must
never marry for money. He may have his faults, but he
must not do that. Yet such is the magic of Madame
ALBANESI's pen that, although the hero of The Sunlit
Hills (HUTCHINSoN) deliberately commits this worst of
crimes, never for a moment does the reader cease to like
him. Perhaps you imagine that there were mitigating
circumstances, that he did this thing to support a widowed
mother or to restore the dear old family estates? Not at
all. He did it from purely selfish motives, because he liked
money and the ease which money brings, and this was the
only way to get it. And yet, as I say, it is impossible to
entitled A General History of the Pyrates from their first
Rise and Settlement in the Island of Providence to the
Present Time; with the Remarkable Actions and Adventures
of the two Female Pyrates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny. The
smaller book takes no cognisance of the second section, and
so we miss the deeds of these adventurous women, but we
have record enough of the crimes of such men as Captains
Avery, John RAcKHAM, ANSTIs, etc., to satisfy most of us.
My trouble is that their crimes were too sordid, that they
murdered each other with an impartiality that is bound to
be distressing to anyone who has a regard for their pro-
fession. I am not sure that even my profound affection
for Smee is proof against the devastations caused by this
dreadful thing that Mr. FRASER has thrown at me.
“There is shortly to be opened at Nuneaton, her birthplace, a
memorial to George Eliot. This is the first public memorial to be
erected to the novelist's memory, the other one in existence being
that erected by Mr. F. A. Newdigate-Newdegate, M.P., on his
estate Arbury—the Cheveral Manor of her works—where George
Eliot was born.”—Morning Paper.
GEORGE ELIOT appears to have had HoMER's knack of
being born in several (we will not say cheveral) places at
Once.

THE PASSING.
“A PINT of British lager, if you please,” said the dear old gentleman who was my vis-à-vis in the restaurant car,
and he turned from the waiter to me. “One misses the Munich kind,” he said, “but I couldn't stomach it now.”
“Nor I, Sir,” I replied, and was glad that he had spoken. I had watched his benevolent face—it seemed some-
how familiar—in the compartment which we had shared, and wished he would speak to me. And now, with nothing
but a small table for two between us, the ice, as they say, was broken, and we fell to talking of the changes of taste and
habit, even in little things like lager, that the War had brought about.
“I should like to tell you, if I may,” he said, “of a rather sad dream that I had last night. In my sleep I found
myself in a certain London bier-halle (now Anglicized) that I used to frequent in the old days before everything German
became impossible. Though the decorations of the room were still as I knew them, the atmosphere had changed
with the management. I was sitting in meditation at my favourite table when there fell upon my ear a gentle moan,
very human and appealing. I looked up. It was just from where the little man in the red cap was smiling from
behind a Gargantuan barrel of beer that the sound of tender lamentation seemed to come. To be sure the little fellow
was only half a man, being a flat presentment on the frescoed wall of the restaurant, and of course it could not have
been he who had spoken. And then suddenly I knew that it was.
“‘You don't mind me speaking to you?” said the small person. He came right off the wall as he said the words
and squatted on the wooden table with its dumpy legs, swinging his own as he took his place. ... You see I fancied
you would understand. I shouldn't wonder if they close this place now, for it is gone and will never come back
any more.’ -
“‘What's missing?' I asked, feeling sorry for his dejection.
“‘You know. I have often seen you coming in for a sandwich and a drop of Münchner. What I am sorry
for is that it is all over, all the jolly old spirit of Germany; but there—it is gone, and nothing will make things the
same again. You see we were the real Germany, the Germany you and the rest admired. Pity to spoil it all, for
there was a lot of good in it, and we never did any harm.’ He planted his feet on a chair and shifted his belt.
“I come from the Rhine, but I've been here in London for years now. Good place Germany, or it was once,
but I shall never go back. They can scratch me off the wall if they like, I don't care.'
“‘You don't approve of this Kaiser person, then 2' I asked, a little relieved, for it seemed strange to be conversing
with one who possibly should have been interned. The little man shook his head till the red cap quivered.
“‘Him ' ' he said with vibrating contempt. ‘No, I don't. He's not Germany. It's we who are Germany,
we and my friends; and we are sorry, I can tell you that. Up there'—he gave a backward gesture whence he had

come—"we have talked it over, and we are all agreed. They have gone mad. You know what I mean. You've seen
the Rhine. I heard you speaking of it one night, for you always used to sit close to me here. I am thinking of all
that, and the music and the dreams, and the old professors—real professors who scorned politics as trivial things—and
turret windows, and ancient cities, and fat old burgomasters, and the little villages and the kinder. You know the
Christmas Tree came from there, the old Germany which we used to love when folks were kind and did their best.’
As he spoke he waved his hand, and in an instant there stood in the centre of the now deserted café a radiant
vision of a tree, all fairy lights and dark and mysterious shadows, with dainty little fair-haired Gretchens sitting on
the branches, and toy houses suspended by golden twine.
“‘It was good, wasn't it?’ murmured the little man as the vision faded away; but it wasn't only that. Germany
had its kingdom, a mighty kingdom among the only things which really matter. It had romance and the spring, and
it was good to see the students, to hear the laughter, and to listen to the old fellow who used to play the violin at
that place in Heidelberg, you remember him 2 Ah, yes, it is sad enough, for it never can happen again, since the spirit
of the true Germany is dead. No, it never can happen again—never again—never again He seemed about to say
it once more, when suddenly there was a step on the stairs and a waiter hurried across the room, coming from the modern
department on the floor above, and I looked up to see that my friend had returned to his place behind the beer barrel.
“That was my dream. Of course the little fellow had been out of Germany for many years, and
had not seen that the changes of which he spoke had been going on for a long, long time under the influence of
Prussian militarism. So that to-day we are not just at war with the KAISER and his professional soldiers, we are at
war with the whole German nation whose heart they have brutalised. How else can you account for the ecstasy of
delight with which the sinking of the Lusitania, to take one example, was received by all classes in Germany 2 No
such change of heart could be made on a sudden, even under the stress of war . . . Shall we go back to our compart-
ment and continue this talk?” . . . We returned, lit pipes, and he began again.
“We too, of course, have changed, but not like that. We have roused ourselves from our apathy; we have
learned to hate, and more hotly than we ever hated anything before, the spirit which provoked the War, and whose
conduct of it has put our enemies for ever outside the communion of humanity. But we have not changed our hearts;
we still cling to the old ideals and nurse the old hopes; we have not denied our faiths and loyalties; we have not lost
our sense of honour and pity, nor yet our love of that humour in which tears and laughter are blent. I hope not ; I
hope not,” he said very earnestly. “I look into my own heart and tell myself that I can find no change there.
But I should like the test of some one else's unprejudiced opinion.” He looked me very straight in the eyes as though
to probe my sympathies. Then he rose and took a nice fat bag from the rack.
“I have here,” he explained, “a few samples of my own thoughts, put down during the last half-year that has so
tried our English temper. I am to give them to my friends for an Old Year's memory and a New Year's greeting.
Will you do me the favour of accepting a copy, and letting me know at your leisure whether you think my heart, as
far as these pages reveal it, is right? You will find my name and address on the fly-leaf.”
As I was passing down the corridor behind him I had noticed a familiar excrescence between his shoulders,
and now my best suspicions were confirmed as he handed me Mr. Punch's
One jumbrth and forty-Ålinth tolume.

Quivered when he said good-bye—

BLOUDIE BILL.
AN AUGUST LEGEND, AFTER INGoLDSBY.
O, why doth thine eye gleam so bright,
%loubic gill,
O, why doth thine eye gleam so bright?
The Fatherland's sons
May have horses and guns,
They may fight all the day, and sit tight
All night,
But they'll never get round on the right.
Thy laughter is pleasant to see,
%loubic gill,
Thy laughter comes pleasant and gay :
“The contemptible FRENCH
And his Army entrench,
But We haven't a moment to stay
To-day;
And We shoo the poor fellows away.
“Then Paris lies open to Us
(%Inubic Bill),
In a week she comes under Our hand.
Next London shall feel
The full weight of our heel—
By October the 10th we shall land,
As planned,
And proceed up the Mall (with a band).”
O laugh not, I pray thee, so loud,
%loubie Gill,
O laugh not, I pray thee, so clear;
Art thou totally blind
To the danger behind 2
Look! the Cossacks are coming ! They cheer,
“We’re here.”
They are thundering up in thy rear!
Thy answer comes ready and quick,
%lcubic gill:
“In a week We have France on her knees;
Then We pillage and burn,
Do a right-about-turn,
And mop up the TsAR at Our ease,
And seize
Just as much of his land as We please.”
O, thine eye is prophetic and keen,
%loubie 33ill,
There's a splendour that shines on thy brow;
“'Tis done ! We have won
Such a place in the sun
As no one can take from Us now;
So bow
To Us, the All-Highest. Wow-wow !”
O, why doth thine eye gleam so bright,
%lombic gill'?
Doth the tear in thine eye make it bright?
Von KLUck and his Huns
Had the horses and guns;
They could fight all the day; they could fight
All night . . .
But they never got round on the right 1 A. A. M.

Officer (to Tommy, who is having his hair cut with horse-clippers). “Does IT HURT MUch?”
Tommy. “Not MUcH, SIR, only when 'Is Foot slips AND 'E ANGs on To ME BY THE MACHINE.”
TO POESY-FOR THIS CHRISTMAS.
O PoEsy, thou chaste and heavenly maid,
Whom all right-minded persons call divine,
IIow long, how long is it since I essayed
Aught in thy line;
Since last I wooed thee, wooed thee as a queen,
And thou didst not unswervingly say “No” ”
On a rough estimate, it must have bcºn
Some months ago.
I had a temple sacred to thy name,
A quiet shrine, where never sound could steal,
Wherein I fanned the favourable flame
And did a deal.
Then, as from flower to flower the deep bees sup,
I lit on themes of general bounteousness,
And, at a pinch, could always pick one up
Out of the Press;
And sat aloof, and plied my gentle rôle,
And, if afflicted by a sudden blight,
In soft communion with some poet-soul
Got myself right.
Now, now, alas ! that time has passed away;
The Huns have hoch-ed, the Huns are hoch-ing yet;
A stranger occupies the shrine to-day
(My flat is let).
The measures and the motives that I sang,
And hoped to go on singing, are decayed;
Nor do the folk about me give a hang
For thee, sweet maid.
That they have hearts attuned to warrior feats
And high emprise, I cheerfully admit;
But I believe that, if I spoke of KEATs,
They'd have a fit.
And men are round me who, with cries of brass,
Would drag me down if I essayed to climb;
All, all is changed, and as a rule, alas !
I haven't time.
So if, at this frail hour of hollow cheer,
I still attempt the seasonable strain,
'Tis but to notify the fact that “Here
We are again.” DUM-DUM.
