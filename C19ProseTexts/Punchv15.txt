TIME turns over a new leaf-page 1849.
It will take some pause to convince us that the leaf be turned; to assure us of the exit of Eighteen-Forty-Eight.
And for this good reason:—Eighteen-Forty-Eight has, all through his life, been such an uproarious knave, that we
cannot for awhile get his doings out of our ears. Like the bell that vibrates with the last stroke of twelve—with the
last pulsation of the dead year—so does the round world still hum with the hubbub of the deceased.
France rings with a brassy sound—the sound of a counterfeit NAP.
A crown has been suddenly dropt in Austria, and (though picked up again) we still hear the echo of the fall.
Prussia pricks up her ears, startled by the rumpling of parchment—the unfolding of a Constitution.
Rome, with Head separated still, like St. DENIs, moves on.
Naples shifts uneasily under a lucifer sceptre.
Spain, to be sure, is tolerably quiet; for, like a bankrupt pieman, she has no money to pitch and toss with.
The Russian Bear sucks his paws, seeming inclined to doze. -
And John BULL, rejoicing from his show of cattle, smacks his lips at fat six inches on the ribs.
If, however, Eighteen-Forty-Eight have been a swaggerer, Eighteen-Forty-Nine, feeling himself a born
gentleman, will, no doubt, behave himself as such. In France, he will be the pink of courtesy and gentleness: he will

iy PREFACE.
cease to yell Mourir pour la patrie; but do the best to Vivre pour la patrie. France has died often enough : it is
now high time to try to live.
Austria will plant olives throughout, and disband her armies. Mortars will be turned into beehives; and
lances into vine-poles. We already see JELLALIch and WINDIschgratz promoted from the field of glory to the field
of turnips.
Prussia will march on softly and comfortably in the path of Constitutional Freedom—a path carpetted with the
best of Berlin wool, worked with excellent designs.
The Pope, having read the following notice in Punch :-"If Pius will return, all will be forgotten; his absence
is not yet generally known: ”—the Pope, we say, having read this, goes back; and makes haste to secure his triple
crown with the best Roman cement.
Naples does nothing but eat maccaroni; and Sicilians and Neapolitans do not eat one another. FERDIN AND’s
lucifer sceptre changes into a sugar-stick.
Spain is prouder than ever; and never with such good reason—She pays her debts.
We hear nothing of Russia; and from some folks, no news is the best of news.
John BULL has been very economical, and very busy. He has wholly discharged a good many idlers; and
others he has put upon small pensions, to let them die comfortably out. But to think of John’s business all 1849 |
He hasn’t had a moment’s rest, orders from customers at home and abroad coming so thick upon him. And the fine
old fellow—for John, after all, is never without hope—anticipating this, has already taken off his hat and, having had
a Merry Christmas, (pray shout with him) shouts for—
“A Happy New Year.”

PUNCH PRESENTING HIs FourTEENTH WolumE TO THE GENIUs or HIs Country.
PUNCH's BIRTHDAY ODE TO HIMSELF.
I
AMID the crash of toppling crowns,
The crack of dynasties,
And thunder of bombarded towns,
Far booming o'er the seas,
While Europe with an earthquake-shock
Is reeling to and fro,
John BULL sits calmly on his rock,
i. with Ocean's flow, .
Watching the storm with quiet survey,
He being safe ashore;
And whilst abroad all thing are topsy-turvy,
He sees his QUEEN upon her throne,
His Lords and Commons holding still their own,
And some of them, perhaps, a little more.
II.
Oh, pride! our Institutions—
The old, the wise, the free—
In a world of revolutions
Still flourishing to see!
To view our own majestic native Oak,
Whilst other trees of Liberty decay,
Still whole and sound from stem to spray,
Not in the least inclined to droop;
. Indeed, without a joke
This sight should make each Briton cock-a-hoop !
III.
But of our Constitution
There's one peculiar boast,
Its finest Institution—
That is to say, almost–
With warmest exultation,
And self-congratulation,
With admiration utterly unbounded,
Should every mother's son
Regard THAT Institution, founded
In Eighteen Forty-one !
WOL, XW.
Yes, Punch, for ever vernal
By strife and storms unshaken,
Thy celebrated Journal
The proudest feelings must awaken
In every patriotic breast
That throbs beneath a British vest.
IV.
Lo, Punch, whose Fifteenth Volume now appears,
Begins the eighth of his immortal years;
#. his outpourings as the sea,
And also quite as shiny, -
With laughs innumerable, as the “briny.”
Thus AEschylus, you know,
Describes the Ocean's glow,..
When its countless ripples glitter
In a universal titter,
A tremendous Ha, ha, he
Ho, ho, ho!
W.
This is the happy day of Punch's birth,
And that is why he crows,
And his own trumpet blows
In plenitude of mirth.
He makes his fresh appearance,
Intent, with º:
To follow out the good HoRATIAN rule
With which he first began:
That is, in season still to play the fool,
Which to do well,
And wear with decent grace the cap and bell,
Takes a wise man. -
Thus, being now, septemnial,
Punch trusts to be perennial;
To him Oblivion's tiunk and dusty shelf
Suggest no fears.
He only hopes his readers—like himself-
§ live a thousand years.

Newspaper-boy (reads). “A GENTLEMAN IN THE N-E-1-G-H–NEIGHBour-
Hood of HAs AT THE PREs ENT time sevelt AL e-nonmous Goose-
BERRIES IN HIS GARDEN, which MEASURE TEN INCHES IN C-1-R-CIR C-U-M-
cum F-E-R-FER E-N-C-E-ENCE CIRCUMFERENCE, AND ARE OF THE A-s-As
Aston-Astonishing weight of THREE Hounces HEAch.”
His Friend. “Oh, what WHoppews | Wouldn't I LIKE A PINT."
THE SPECIALSº BANGUET.
IN imitation, of the heroes who meet every year to celebrate the
glorious days of Waterloo, a splendid banquet has been given in com-
memoration of the 10th of A. by a select troop of suburban
Specials. The chair was taken by BONNER's FIELD MARSHAL SMITH,
who was supported right and left by his own staff, and the staffs of those
who had served with him in the recent wars with the Chartists; .
The dinner service used on the occasion was the celebrated united
service of the willow pattern and the Asiatic birds; while the side-
board was one blaze of that true Britannia metal which was so fit an
emblem of the courage of the company.
The bill of fare was on a scale of sumptuousness not often equalled,
but almost always surpassed; for while Glory may be, said to have
resided up-stairs, Frugality, taking a wide range—the kitchen-range-
}. exercised its empire over the culinary arrangements; A magnificent
fillet of veal—out of which every hero present might have carved for
himself a fillet like those of the ancients, to crown himself with renown
—a fillet of veal had been roasted for the occasion, and each of the
Specials had gone down in turn, to assist in .# it, a ceremony
supposed to be symbolical of the basting they would have administered
to the mob had their active services been really required., To return,
however, to the bill of fare, of which we have been fortunate enough to
obtain a copy. It consisted of-
50 Eightpenny large plates of miscella- || 2 of Cauliflowers.
neous Meats. 10 of Stilton.
50 Sixpenny small ditto. 20 of Cheshire.
2 of Greens. 70 of Low Dutch.
3 of Spinach. 6 potations (exactly one pottle deep) of
100 Breads. Strawberries.
20 plates of new Potatoes, plain boiled. 6 pots of Jam, including two of old Goose-
80 plates of old, mashed. berry, one of fresh Strawberry, and
16 Cos Lettuces, au naturel. three doubtful.
15 hap'orths of Onions.
The liquids were of the most refreshing kind, and were supplied from
the vats of MEssRs MEUx, with the motto of “Tant M(j)eur” arranged
in pint pots over the side board. "The mustard was a present from the
Bishop of DURHAM, and the salt was supplied from the well-known
cellars of MEssRs. SHARPUs, of Cockspur Street. The vinegar consisted
of a recently popular white wine, which had been soured by the late
storms in the political atmosphere. -
The cloth having been removed, and the table, as well as the Chair-
man's throat having been cleared, he proposed the health of HER
MAJESTY. In doing so, he ventured to express a hope that the crown
upon her head may reflect the loyalty of her subjects, and that she may
always preserve that attachment for her people which is the diadem's
brightest gem-at least in the eyes of all respectable ge'men. -
Åfter the other usual and complimentary loyal toasts, the Chairman
rose to propose the health of the Army of Specials.
The cheering at this moment was tremendous. The roof of the
building responded to the roofs of the mouths of the company, and even
the gas-lights rattled their glasses in unison with the wine-glasses of the
assembly. When the applause had in some degree subsided, the
hairman proceeded nearly as follows:–
... In rising to propose the health of the Specials, I feel that the toast
will not create enthusiasm in this room alone, but that wherever the
staff of Civilisation is known to have cracked the head of Rebellion, your
cheers will find an echo. Yes, my friends,
“We’ve done the State some service, and we know it,”
as Qthello very sensibly remarked, and I must say that I quite concur
in the candid sentiments of that honourable gentleman. (Hear!) For
my own part, I may exclaim with the Moor, (A voice, “The more the
merrier.’) l shall not be deterred by that atrocious attempt to disturb
Qur harmony and conviviality by a hateful pun. I shall not, I say, be
deterred by that from exclaiming with the Moor,
- that in the City once,
When a malignant and disturbant snob
Beat a policeman, and traduced the force,
I—took by the snout the ragged trowser'd dog,
And smote him—thus
. The honourable Chairman, in suiting the action to the word, smote a
jug, of half-and-half-dividing the vessel into two halves—amid the
enthusiastic cheers of the company.
After the toast had been drunk, the vocalists present sung the
following, to the
An of “ The Soldier Tired.”
THE Special, tired of war's alarms
Comes home from Bonner's Field;
The glass of grog puts forth its charms,
The hero then must yield.
But when the brazen street-bell sounds,
His truncheon's seized once more;
He fearlessly will go his rounds,
And crack of heads a score.
This novel effusion having been powerfully chorused by the whole
Company, BRIEFLEss, as a Special Pleader as well as a Special
Constable, rose to return thanks in the name of the united body of
Specials. The learned and valiant gentleman observed, that of all
motions to which his practice had extended, he had never witnessed
such a regular motion of course as that which ensued by the running
away of the mob whenever the §ºl. showed themselves (Hear! and a
smile). He had himself had the pleasure of exercising the old legal
right of stoppage in transitu, by collaring a young scamp who was
running across the road after throwing a stone at him (MR. BRIEFLEss).
(Trés bien / and Wive sensation /) He was glad to see around him many of
those comrades who had fought—and he would not say bled, but he
hoped he might say that they were ready to bleed if the country required
it—against the common enemy—he meant the Kennington Common
enemy, on the 10th of April., (Cheers, and one laugh.), He (MR. BRIEF-
LEss) would always be º: to appear for the defendants in the cause
of Order, and he would never, shrink from throwing himself upon a
British public-he meant a British mob—if that British public should
be bent on throwing upon him either a stone or any other mis-
sile. (Sirteen Hears, three laughs, two fitters, and one Oh ( ) He
would not lodge a further detainer against the com , some of
whom, he observed, were preparing to demur to his declarations
—though, those declarations, were of the most loyal, and con-
stitutional kind; but he would now conclude by expressing a hope
that every one º would be ready to draw his purse, or even more
than that, his cheque—perhaps he who held money of, no account (at
least at his banker's) might be willing to draw his bill-in defence of
P. Order, the British Constitution, the British Sceptre, the British
ion, and the British Crown. -
. The learned and gallant gentleman sat down amidst the most enthu-
siastic jingle of wine-glasses and tumblers ever known. Several other
toasts were given, and the festivities were prolonged until the period
when that very early riser, the lark, emerges, from his bed to witness
the other larks that are being carried on by those strange human
birds who
“—won't go home till morning,
Till daylight does appear.”
Several of the company Fº: of coffee that had been prepared for
them under the Piazzas of Covent Garden, and at other convenient
stations throughout the metropolis. MR. BRIEFLEss, who declined to
indulge in this déjeineral fresco, proceeded to Hyde, Park for his usual
refresher in the Serpentine, to which he generally resorts for the
purpose of “keeping up the allegory of a refresher” as well as circum-
stances will allow.
Not A BAD IDEA.—It has been suggested to us confidentially, by a
§. authority whom we need not more particularly indicate, that if the
Orleans family should ever be restored to the French throne, the emblem
of the Bourbon dynasty should be partially restored by the modification
or translation of the fleur de lis into the white feather.

HOW TO TREAT THE FEMALE CHARTISTS,
ſ"> Yſ
LONDON is threatened with an º: of female Chartists, and
every man of experience is naturally, alarmed, for he knows that the
voir faeminae is the voz diaboli when it is once set going. We confess

THE BRUMMAGEM FRENCH EMPEROR.
URING the last month, Louis
NAPOLEoN has been en-
gaged in completing his
º
º arrangements, for the as-
?: sumption of the character
º of Emperor of France—a
part he contemplates filling
with more success than
has attended his past per-
formances. He has already
urchased, at Waterloo
ouse, six yards of imperial
purple, at 3s. 9d. a yard,
and he is in treaty with the
proprietors of Covent
Garden for some of the
still existing “machinery
#: dresses, and
ecorations,” that were
used for the grand spec-
tacle acted some 3. ago
under the title of Napoleon.
PRINCE Louis was offered, at a low figure, his uncle's “identical hat;” but upon “trying it on,”
the cap fitted so badly, that it was º by wearing it, he would only expose the difference
between his own head-piece and that of his renowned relative.
. Some difficulty, has been experienced in finding an Imperial Eagle, warranted not to be
sick at §º. it was º: would compromise the ś of the expedition. The old
original Colisseum Eagle, who accompanied PRINCE Louis on the last occasion, had his bill
seized by the French beaks, and died in the hands of the magistrates. An experienced Eagle
from the Surrey Zoological received a liberal offer; but it turned out to be by far too old a bird
to be caught taking a part in any affair got up by Louis NAPOLEON. It has therefore been
decided to throw the Eagle overboard, or rather not to take one on board at all; and the agent
9f PRINCE LOUIs has purchased a quarter of a main of Gallic Cocks, as a substitute for the
bird of larger pretensions,
It will be remembered that, on the expedition to Boulogne, six dozen of champ
of men, and a hamper, full of sandwiches, formed, with the Eagle, the whole of the Prince's
retinue; but it was thought, that the champagne. produced a deleterious effect, and it is
therefore to be superseded on this occasion by some imperial ginger-pop, which, while cheaper,
and almost as invigorating as the champagne, has the advantage of at least a nominal relation-
º to the soi-disaſt Emperor. A large quantity of that delicious, old “sweet-stuff.” fami-
liarly known as “Buonaparte's Ribs,” will be placed on board, to be distributed, as a
douceur, among the people.

If the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA does not quickly return to Vienna, the Imperial Palace will be

BROUGHAM IN LUCK.
SoME people appear to have been recently
seized with a mania for leaving their property
to LoRD BROUGHAM, who has within the last few
years become a legatee to the tune of many
thousands of pounds. Now we have no objection
to our old friend and involuntary contributor
to our pictorial department becoming the re-
cipient of bequests from º: ut when
he reflects that to us he owes his popularity-
that we in fact have made him what he is—we
are sure that he will consider us in justice
entitled to a fair share, of the property that
has been bequeathed to him. If the money is
left to console him for our banter, we are surely
entitled to a share of the proceeds; and if, on
the contrary, he is enriched by testators, from
a feeling of admiration, it is, we who have done
everything, during the last five years, to render
him popular, by keeping the eyes of Europe upon
him as frequently as possible. We trust his
Lordship will take the hint, and cause a hand-
some per centage on his legacies to be paid to
the respective accounts of the writers and artists
of Punch with the Bank of England. We shall
send to have our Books made up in the course
of next weeks and we hope to find that our
suggestion will have been duly attended to.
Old Iron for Sale.
WHAT ever will become of the Iron Crown
of Lombardy? It has fitted many heads, in its
time; but now it is without a single head to fit.
We believe the Railway King has sent in a
tender for it. The Iron is certainly more, in
his line than any other king's. We can imagine
how uneasy the poor Emperor of Austria's
head must have felt under such a heavy load.
The report is, however, that the crown no longer
exists—that it was broken up long ago, to enable
RADETsKI to make a rod of iron of it. The
heaviness of his rule, therefore, is easily ac:
counted for, and the *::: cannot be blamed
for no longer bearing it. How would the English
like an Iron Ruler over their heads?

PUNCH'S POEMS OF PARLIAMENT,
The Political Babes in the Wood.
d ow ſº. well, you statesmen deare,
The wordes which I shall write;
R A doleful storie you shall heare,
With moral obvious quite.
The Whigs, a race of good account,
Held Downing Street of late,
And did in honor most surmount
Who've fill'd that ticklish state.
One of this blood, grown grey in place,
he Commonweale to save,
Of boroughs close the rotten race
Still closer vowed to shave;
So the Reform Bille he did passe,
ith Radicals combined,
And then himselfe j hence, alas !
But lefte two babes behinde.
Russell the one, his father's joye,
Of speeche right quicke and bolde;
MoRPETH the next, a maiden coy,
Framed in Listonian molde.
For legacie these prettie babes
Had from their father deare
Great credite, and bills falling due,
For many a coming yeare.
Then HUME, his brother radicalle,
Bespake the grandsire, Grey-
“Be kinde unto my children smalle,
When I am passed awaye;
Hºli. them to keep, like brother true,
The credit that fº
Nor let my billes be overdue, -
Lest so my babes shoulde grieve.”
This speech did then that brother make,
To that olde gentleman—
“I’ll tend your babies for your sake,
The best that e'er I can:
So may I keepe my seate so deare,
And never change § coate,
As I will aide your children here,
With speeche and eke with vote.”
Their parent being past and gone,
These babes in task he takes
To teache, but when his teachinge's done,
Thereof small profit makes.
He had not had these babes in hand
Twelve sessions and a daye,
When he doth find them ever stand
Right grievouse in his waye.
So with two ruffians he did speake,
That were of ruthlesse moode,
That they shoulde take these children weake,
And slaye them in a woode.
One of these ruffians CoBDEN hight,
The other PEELE, his friende,
To what the firste his troth did plight,
The last his aide would lende.
Awaye these pretty babes they bore
Full innocente of minde,
Deeming that all was righte before,
And nothing . behinde.
They prate and prattle pleasantlie,"
And wonder while they playe,
Why that these men should ride so fast,
So rough and long a waye.
But nought this pretty speech they had,
Made those stern hearts relent;
The men that undertook the deed
Were not men to repent.
Till PEELE, the one less hard of heart,
Shrunk somewhat from his charge,
Tho' knowing, if they’re slain, his part
Of the reward were large.
The other won't agree thereto,
So falle they to debate,
As fiercely as old friends will doe,
Aboute those babies' fate:
Till he that was of mildest moode
At last did have his waye;
These babes, that nothing understoode,
They deemed it was but playe.
He took the babies by the hande,
That still like babes behave, -
And bade them straightwaie follow him,
Would they their bacon save.
Bº aye the faster he led on
hey followed aye more slowe:
“Nay,” quoth he, “an you’ll go alone,
Stay till you wiser growe.”
These helpless babes, with hand in hand,
ent wandering up and downe,
But never more came back the man
That thus had done them browne.
In vain out of their hapless plighte
To find their waie they tried, -
And when they sawe the darksome nighte,
They sat them downe and cried.
Thus flounder'd on these innocents
From pillar unto poste,
Till piteouslie '. rendered up
Their smalle official ghoste. -
o sorrowing worde this pretty paire
Qf any man receives
Till Mr. Punch most piously
Embalmed them in his leaves!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 5
A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMMINS’S.
ITzRoy TIMMINs, whose taste for
wine is remarkable for so young
a man, is a member of the Com-
mittee of the Megatherium Club,
and the great MIRoBoLANT, good-
natured as all great men are, was
only too happy to oblige him,
young friend and ſº of his, of
considerable merit, M. CAVALCA-
Dour, happened to be disengaged
through the lamented. death of
LoRD HAUNCHER, with whom
oung CAVALCADour had made
É. débit as an artist. He had
nothing to refuse to his master,
MIRoBoI.ANT, and would impress
himself to be useful to a gourme
so distinguished as Monsieur
TIMMINs. FITz went away as
pleased as Punch with this enco-
mium of the great MIROBOLANT
and was one of those who vote
against the decreasing of MIRo-
BoLANT's salary, when that mea-
sure was proposed by MR.
PARINGs, CoLonEL CLose, and
the Screw party in the Committee of the Club.
Faithful to the promise of his great master, the youthful CAyALCADour
called in LilliputStreet the next day. A rich crimson velyet waistcoat,
with buttons of blue glass and gold, a variegated blue satin stock, over
which a graceful mosaic chain hung in glittering folds, a white hat worn
on one side of his long curling ringlets, redolent with the most delight-
ful hair oil—one of those white hats which looks as if it had been just
skinned—and a pair of gloves not exactly of the colour of beurre frais,
but of beurre that has been up the chimney, with a natty came with a gilt
knob, completed the upper part, at any rate, of the costume of the young
fellow whom the page introduced to MRs. TIMMINs.
Her mamma and she had been just having a dispute about the
seberry cream when CAVALCADouk arrived. His presence silenced
Rs. GAshLEIGH; and Rosa, in carrying on a conversation with him in
the French language, which she had acquired perfectly in an elegant
finishing establishment in Kensington Square, had a great advantage over
her mother, who could only pursue the dialogue with very much diffi.
culty, eyeing one or other interlocutor with an alarmed and suspicious
look, and gasping out “We”, whenever she thought a proper oppor-
tunity arose for the use of that affirmative.
“I have two leetl menus weez me,” said CAVALCADouR to MRs.
GAshLEIGH.
“Minews—yes O indeed,” answered the lady.
“Two little cartes.”
“O, two carts! O we,” she said—"coming, I suppose;” and she looked
out of window to see if they were there.
CAVALCADouR smiled; he produced from a pocket-book a pink paper
and a blue paper, on which he had written two bills of fare, the last two
which he had composed for the lamented HAUNCHER, and he handed
these over to MRs. FitzRoy.
The poor little woman was dreadfully puzzled with these documents,
(she has them in her possession still), and began to read from the pink
one as follows:—
“DINER PouB 16 PERSONNEs.
Potage (clair) a la Rigodon.

“Madame will see that the dinners are quite simple,” said M.
CAVALCADour.
..Q. Quite!” said Rosa, dreadfully puzzled.
...Which would Madame like?” I
“Which would we like, Mamma”. Rosa asked; adding, as if after
a little thought, “I think, Sir, we should prefer the blue one.” At
A necessary
which MRs. GASHLEIGH nodded as knowingly as she could; though,
pink or blue, I defy anybody to know what these cooks mean by their
Jargon.
“If you please, Madam, we will go down below and examine the
scene of operations,” Monsieur CAvALCADogR said; and so he was
marshalled down the stairs to the kitchen, which he didn't like to name,
and appeared before the Cook in all his splendour.
He cast a rapid glance round the premises, and a smile of somethin
like contempt lighted up his features. “ Will you bring pen and ink, i
you please, and I will write down a few of the articles which will be
for us? We shall require, if you please, eight more stew.
ans, a couple of braising pans, eight_sauté pans, six bain-marie pans, a
freezing-pot with accessories, and a few more articles of which I will
inscribe the names.” and Mr. CAVALCADQUR did so, dashing down,
with the rapidity of genius, a tremendous list of ironmongery goods,
which he handed over to MRs. TIMMINs. She and her mamma
were quite º: º the awful catalogue. .
“I will three, days hence, and superintend, the progress of
i.; and we will make the stock for the soup the day before the
linner.
“Don’t you think, Sir,”, here interposed MRs. GAshLEIGH, “that
one soup—a fine rich mock-turtle, such as I have seen in the best
houses in the West of England, and such as the late LoRD Forty-
skEWER—”
“You will get what is wanted for the soups, if you please,” MR.
CAVALCADouB continued, not heeding this interruption, and as bold as
a captain on his own quarter-deck: “for the stock of clear soup, you
will get a leg of beef, a leg of veal, and a ham.”
“We Munseer,” said the cook, dropping a terrified curtsey. “A leg
of beef, a leg of veal, and a ham.”
“You can't serve a leg of veal at a party,” said Mrs. GAshLEIGH;
“and a leg of beef is not a company dish.”
“Madam, they are to make the stock of the clear soup,” MR.
CAVALCADour said.
“What?” cried MRs. GASHLEIGH; and the cook repeated his former
expression.
. Never, whilst I am in this house,” cried out MRs. GAshLEIGH
indignantly; “never in a Christian English household ; never shall
such sinful waste be permitted by me...lf you wish me to dine, Rosa,
you must get a dinner less expensive. The RIGHT Honour ABLE LoRo
oRTyskEwBR could dine, Sir, without these wicked luxuries, and I
presume my daughter's guests can.”
“Madame is perfectly at liberty to decide,” said M. CAvALCADouR.
“I came to oblige Madame an
myself.”
... “Thank you, Sir, I think it will be too expensive,” Rosa stammered
in a great flutter; “but I am very much obliged to you.”
“Il n'y a point d'obligation, Madame,” said Monsieur ALCIDE
CAMILLE CAVALCADoUR in his most superb manner; and, making a
splendid bow to the lady of the house, was respectfully conducted to the
upper regions by little BUTTONs, leaving Rosa frightened, the cook
amazed and silent, and MRs. GASHLEIGH boiling with indignation
against the dresser.
Up to that moment, MRs. BLowser, the cook, who had come out of
Devonshire with MRs. GASHLEIGH (of course that lady garrisoned her
daughter's house with servants, and expected them to give her inform-
ation of everything which took place there); up to that moment, I say,
the cook had been quite contented with that subterraneous station
which she occupied in life, and had a pride in keeping her kitchen meat,
bright, and clean. It was, in her opinion, the comfortablest room in
the house (we all thought so when we came down of a night to smoke
there); and the handsomest kitchen in Lilliput Street. - - - -
But after the visit of CAVALGADQUR, the cook became quite discon-
tented and uneasy in her mind. She talked in a melancholy manner
over the area railings to the cooks at twenty-three and twenty-five.
She stepped over the way, and conferred with the cook there. She
made inquiries at the baker's and at other places about the kitchens in
the great houses in Brobdingmag Gardens, and how many spits, bang-
marry pans, and stoo pans they had. Šhe thought she could not do
with an occasional help, but must have a kitchen-maid. And she was
often discovered by a gentlemen of the police force, who was, I believe,
her cousin, and occasionally visited her when MRs. GASHLEIGH was not
in the house or spying it;-she was discovered, seated with Mrs. Rundell
my good friend MIROBoLANT, not
in her lap, its leaves bespattered with her tears. y Pease be gone,
Pelisse,” she said, “zins Izaw that ther Franchman:” and it was all
the faithful fellow could do to console her. - -
“—the dinner,” said TIMMINs, in a rage at last: “having it cooked
in the house is out of the question: the bother of it: and the row your
mother makes are enough to drive one mad. It won't happen again, I
can promise you, Rosa-order it at FUBSBY’s at once. You can have
everything from FUBSBy’s-from footmen to saltspoons, Let's go
and order it at FUBsBY’s.” “Darling, if you don't mind the expense,
and it will be any relief to §º. let us do as you wish,” Rosa said; and
she put on her bonnet, and they went off to the grand cook and con-
fectioner of the Brobdingnag quarter.

Flunkey. “Oh, DEAR No, MA’AM-Not Dissatisfied EXACTLY; BUT-A-The FACT is, MA’AM, You Don't KEEP No webICLE, AND
I FIND I Miss My CARRIAGE EXERCISE.”
THE MODEL DEBTOR.
olong as he gets a thing on credit, he never thinks
it dear. No dinner is too good for him; the
dearest wines, the earliest peas, the most juvenile
strawberries; the strongest liqueurs, the most
exotic luxuries—everything that is expensive and
delicious, so that he is not called upon to give
ready money, for it. The world pays, and he
enjoys himself. cab is found him free of
expense, and by some charm, he has a 200 guinea
horse sent home to him without paying a single
penny for it. The rent of his house is several
quarters due; the furniture is of the very best,
but not a stick or a stitch of it has been settled for, and the very sheets
he aleeps in might be taken from under him by his washerwoman, for
terrible arrears of debt. These thoughts, however, do not trouble his
happiness. He trusts, for everything, to his appearance. . He knows
welſ enough that a man with, a shabby exterior never gets credit for
anything in this world. He has a good coat, and on the back of it
orders as many clothes as, he likes. He has only, to ask for hats,
boots, walking-sticks, pistols,...dressing cases, and they are all left at
his “residence,” exactly as if he had paid for every one of them.
No questions are asked-not a soul is in a hurry; for “any one can
see he is a perfect gentleman.”. He flourishes a º, though
his drafts would not be liquidated at any other bank but Aldgate Pump.
The day of reckoning, however, sooner or later, comes...Then it is that
the wonderful impudence, the real genius, of the MoDEL. Debtor
bursts out in all its greatness. It is not convenient for him to pay,
just at present. It would be ruination to sell out when the funds
are so low. He. wonders at Mr. SMIth's impatience (SMITH is his
butcher)—the bill can *g. been owing two years—but he will
call and settle next week. me he threatens to expose; the imperti-
nence of others, he will certainly report to all his friends: and he
silences the noisiest with a piece of stamped paper, on which his name
is inscribed, as the representative of hundreds of pounds. But the
bubble gets larger and larger, till it bursts. Then the MoDELDEBTOR
tumbles from his high estate—if ever, he had any—and from, an
“eligible mansion” he falls to a “desirable lodging,” at a few shillings
per week. . He likes the Surrey side of the Thames best:
His life is now a constant game of hide-and-seek. He is never “at
home,” especially to top-boots and Jerusalem noses, that bring letters
and wait for answers in the passage. He grows nervous. Every
knock at the door throws him back, and he rings the bell violently
two or three times, whispers to the servant through the door, turns the
key, and crouches down with his ear at the key-hole. He looks out of
window before he ventures in the street. He only walks when he can-
not afford to pay for a cab., Omnibuses are dangerous; it is not so
easy to avoid a creditor inside. He selects the dreariest thoroughfares,
and never penetrates into a cul-de-sac, or approaches within a mile of
hancery Lane. His impudence, however, does not desert him. . He
never recollects any bill whatever, and if stopt and questioned about
his name, he threatens in the grandest manner to call the police. When
ressed for money, he is sure the account was H. long ago, and that
e has got the receipt somewhere at home. He is most fruitful in
excuses, and lavish in promises. He generally expects a “good round
sum in a day or two.” He can never get his accounts in, and was disap-
pointed only last week of a large balance he had relied, upon for paying
#. little “trifle.” As he falls lower in the world, he gets meeker.
He would pay if he could. All he asks for is time. Business is very
bad—never was worse. He only wants to look round him; He hopes
you won’t be hard upon him; but if prosecuted, if goaded to death in
this way, sooner than lead the life he does, he will go into the Gazette,
and then his creditors must not blame him if they don't get a farthing.
He means well, if they will only leave him alone. He will be happy to
give you a bill. He a wife and three children. In fact he is a

most affectionate parent, and the sacrifices he has made for his family
no one can tell but himself—which he does upon every possible
opportunity. He grows tired of answering letters, and as for giving
the name of his solicitor, he hates the law too much to do it., He meets
a bill and a bailiff with equal horror; but does not care much for either,
if he can only be sure of a “ gºod long run.” He is very sensitive
about the left shoulder, going off, like a hair-trigger, at the slightest
touch. His great day is Sunday. He is then everywhere—in the Park
especially—and, any one to see him would imagine “he could look
the whole world in the face, and defy any one to say he owed him, a
shilling.” He is brave, too, during Vacation. He is very intimate with
the law, and has a profound respect for the Statute of Limitations; but
thinks England not worth living in since the County Courts Act. He
carries his antipathy, indeed, so far as to run over some fine morning
to Boulogne and never coming back again, º: all his T.";
though, behind him in a carpet-bag replete with bricks. There his
first care is to cultivate amoustache, sºto procure new clothes, new
dinners, fresh victims. He is always expecting a remittance by the
next post. His bankers, however, are very remiss, and he is lodged at
last by his landlord in the Hôtel d'Angleterre—in plain English, the
#." He only asked for time, and at last he gets more of it than he
ikes, for he is locked up for two or three years in jail, unless he is very
lucky and is liberated by a Revolution. He disappears no one knows
where. His friends wonder what has become of him, till there is a
Vague º: that he has been seen as an attaché to one of the gaming-
houses about Leicester Square, or, if he is tolerably well off, that he
has been recognised on the road to Epsom, driving a cab, with a large
number (say 2584) painted upon it.
The MoDEL, DEBTOR is honest at last, for he has arrived at that stage
of life at which no man will put any trust in him. He pays his way-
turnpikes included—and does not overcharge more than what is perfectly
som. He pays ready money for everything, even down to the
waterman on the cabstand, and gives hiji out as “a gentleman who
has seen better days.”. His great boast, however, is that all .
the ups and downs of his racketty career, he never left unpaid a single
debt of honour. Doubtlessly, this is a great source of consolation
to the numerous tradesmen to whom he never paid a penny!

THE tradesmen of London appear to be occasionally bitten

short of downright insanity. ... A firm in Oxford Street has
just caught the terrible cacoethes, and has burst out with a
placard exhibiting a very bad case indeed of counter-irritation
or shopkeeper's . Not only has Johnson been pillaged
of all his hard words, but the most formidable of our lexicogra-
phers have been left far behind by the accumulation of a
startling array of compound words of the most confounding
character. -
The tradesmen alluded to, announce their “co-acervation”
|ºf a lot of umbrellas and pocket-handerchiefs, which are
heralded as a “beautiful compilation;” and they describe the
recent depression in the value of foreign goods as an “aurif.

ary conglomeration of astounding dissyllables, trisyllables
and polysyllables culled from the deepest recesses of classi
research, and crammed into the small compass of a single

it extends to the goods, which are described with all the united

well be called an “Extraordinary excerption of foreign

WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATIONS.
TVERYBody must remember—at all events
everybody ought to remember—the inge-
nious individual who went about with a
sheet of paper, which he professed to fold
into “six-and-twenty different forms.” We
are perfectly familiar with the old delusion
by which, in “childhood's green and happy
hours,” we were persuaded that a bit of
paper “upside down”, represented “a
garden seat,” and that the same piece of
A paper," downside up”, gave us an exact
resemblance of “an old-fashioned curry-
comb.” We canthoroughly recollect being
convinced that if folded double, the sheet
of 3. er showed us “a door-mat,” and if
folded single, it brought before our eyes
“a stable lanthorn.” These convictions
were assisted considerably by the warmth
of juvenile credulity. But our ballet-
- - - - - dancers make in these days almost equal
claims on our simplicity. For instance, a sort of muffin-bell made of
muslin, with a double clapper—the two legs—gives us the ballet-dancer
in her original state; but clap a pair of wings on the muslim muffin-bell,
and we are taught to believe that we see a Sylphide. Adorn the handle
of the muslim muffin-bell with a crescent, and make a little fillagree
work in the shape of a bow, and we get a DIANA; while a hat and a
gun turns the muslin muffin-bell into a toy pen-wiper, in the semblance
of a female brigand. Taking the head as a separate article, and in fact
decapitating the ballet-dancer, we see it stuffed with coral one night,
and adorned with a tiara the next-an arrangement which gives us the
same head as CORALIA and JUNO on alternate evenings.
A single'sheet of paper cannot be more easily twisted into six-and-
twenty different forms than a ballet-dancer into six-and-twenty different
or indifferent characters.
A “WERY BAD ' AMBASSADOR.
AMONG, the batch of letters, left, in Paris by Louis-PHILIPPE, and
cruelly published by the Republic, there is one in which GUIzot says—
“BREsson writes me word that Bulwen is really seriously ill at Madrid. I don’t
like BULwea's illnesses; he turns them to account.”
We have heard a story of a crafty child, who, to work upon the fears
of his mother, said-‘‘If you won’t give me a penny, I know a little boy
that’s got the measles, and I'll go and catch em.” Thus our Ambas-
sador had a knack of turning illnesses to advantage... Indeed, we have
a few letters (purchased of the Ambassador's confidential friend, regard.
less of expense) in which SIR HENRY BUIweR lays down the politics
of , sickness to the *† Minister. If Dulce et decorum est, pro
patriá mori, -so to be sick has its degree of sweetness and propriety, if
sick for our country. , Did not LORD LONDONDERRy, upon a certain
memorable occasion, show his sense of value of this truth, and was he
#...? the testimony of LoRD LIVERPOOL-even “too bad” for
nglan
owever, we give a few of the letters sent by SIR HENRY Bulwer
to LoRD PALMERSTON. They will show how the simplicity of GUIzot
and Louis-PHILIPPE was played upon by our crafty Ambassador.
“Madrid, – —, ,
“My LoRD,-Seeing the advances that the French party are daily
making in the Palace, and wishing to hear of the further movements of
BREsson without .# liable to any personal interview with the Am-
bassador, I have thought it my duty, for ten days, at least, to be alarm-
ingly ill with the small-pox. I º: this, the safer malady, being
reviously assured that BREsson had been neither vaccinated nor inocu-
ated. In ten days—or sooner, if affairs require it—I shall be perfectly
well. “Meanwhile, I am, &c, &c.”
“My LoRD,--I regret, for the honour of human nature, that I have
been grossly deceived. BREsson, it now appears, has had the small-
pox; though, with the cunning of Frenchmen, nobody would think it
to look at him.
“Understanding that it was his intention to call upon me, I found it
advisable to be immediately convalescent, and ap ointed a day of
meeting. However, on the previous evening I made every necessary
arrangement to be seized with hooping-cough; so that when BREsson
came—for it appears that he has had the hooping-cough too, and laughs
at it—I was always prevented, by a violent access of the *hoop.” from
giving any answer to any definite question.
“I have the honour to be, &c., &c.”
My LoRD,-A violent cold caught at the last Bull-fight, brought on
a sudden deafness, when apprised of the wish of the Minister to com-
municate with me. He therefore sent me a letter (a copy of which I
forward); whereupon, I thought no course was open to me...but to have
a violent inflammation of the eyes. Awaiting your instructions,
“I am, my Lord, &c., &c., &c.”
“My LoRD,--The plot thickens. The French match is determined
upon. The Minister pressed to see me. Immediately I was a victim
to typhus. This has staid proceedings.”
“My LoRD,-The Queen-Mother having, insisted upon the Minister
demanding an interview, I was attacked with the plague. Considering,
too, the alarming character of the Fº crisis, P; not hesitate even
to kill my valet and coachman with the disease.
“Nevertheless, the Queen-Mother insisted I should write. Where-
upon, I put certain generalities upon paper—and the letter was sent.
CHRISTINA, as I understood, was present when the missive arrived.
The Minister was for having the letter passed through vinegar, whereon
CHRISTINA-having cast one of her terrible smiles upon it—said it
would then do quite as well without.
“I am, &c., &c.”
“My LoRD,--It was my intention this morning to have the Asiatic
Cholera, but as I understand the double marriage has certainly taken
place, it is only throwing away an excellent malady to no purpose.
“I am, my Lord, &c., &c, &c.,
“WISCOUNT PALMERSTON,” *H. Buſºe.R.”
We could add to the number of these letters; but surely we have
printed enough to prove the sagacity of M. GUIzot. No doubt of it,
our Ambassador at Spain has been very bad indeed—for France.
PARLIAMENTARY BRICKS.
MR. DRUMMOND would give a vote only to property, not to the indi-
vidual. He would give a vote to a house and not to the lodger.
Hence, all Britons have only to be “bricks,” to obtain the suffrage.

and a sail made like an immensé

ood-natured welcome. Chinese musicians sing their native melodies

out of him on all sides. This Joss is supported by voluntary contri-
butions. He will take anything you offer him. Put, what you like
before him, and the next morning it is gone. This habit of grabbin
everything accounts at once for the number of his hands. e coul
not help comparing him to the Ateliers Nationauz—a large body most
absurdly worshipped recently in France, where the only use of the
numerous hands employed upon it is to take all they can, and to remain
perfectly idol. The priests must make a good thing of this Joss. Their
perquisites must be enormous. We have a good mind to start a Joss
in our own office, and to advertise immediately for a Hundred Active
Hands. All offerings, of course, to fall to us. Oh, the haunches of
yenison, the pineapples, the Arabian horses, the black footmen, the
Opera-boxes, the ãº rings, the lovely legs of Welsh, mutton,
that would be deposited at our feet every day! The thought is too
much, so we will return to the Chinese Junk.

Everything is curious about it. The Emperor's two unmarried
ughters—wº mean their portraits—are very curious. Their com-
plexions are of the most beautiful coloured rice Fº Their hair is
the finest spun glass; and the sumptuous bunch of blue ribbons at the
top of their large cocoa-nut-shaped heads must be very convenient for
keeping them on their feet, in case they fall off their little toes, which
are quite as fétraussés as their celestial noses. Their large staring
green eyes, with the long eyelashes sticking out of them, though very
charming, struck us as too much like a couple of enormous goose-
berries, of the vulgar species called “hairy,” and we could not help
smiling at the cºmparison, even whilst our heart was º against
our waistcoat like a pocket steam-engine at the effect of the concen.
trated loveliness before us. They must be decidedly two of the
yery best leaves torn out of the Pekin Book of Beauty. We could not
imagine how the Emperor's two daughters, with such a rich dowry of
pharms, cºuld possibly remain unmarried, till our loving eye was caught
by their long nails, protruding like immense fish-hooks, and we no
longer wondered that no man had been bold enough to ask for their
hands in marriage. They looked very gentle, but we would not trust
the best-tempered woman in the world with such instruments of defence
always ready at her fingers’-ends.
It takes fifteen men in calm weather to lift their rudder. It runs up
three stories high, and must take thirty men at least to keep it quiet
in a storm. Wi. they want fine weather, they feed the compass with
cakes; but they told us it took a rare number of puffs in a dead calm
to get up a good wind. We informed them, that the best * to
get up º was to tread three times on the Mandarin's tail. They
promised us they would try it at the very first opportunity. We must
say we suspect H. Mandarin. It is not likely one of our magistrates
would let himself out on hire to the captain of a ship. We do not
think JARDINA would accompany the best collier that was going to
shoot coals in Japan, or that HALL would take a berth in the Bride, if
she were going to exhibit amongst the barbarians of Kamschatka.
We sºil. to produce his peacock's feather; but the good-
natured Chinaman only laughed, and showing his Chinese teeth,
(perfect “ivories,” by the bye), simply said, “How did-you-do-do?”
hat could we say to an answer like that?
We examined the ship on all sides, but could make, nothing of it
nautically. We might sink it, quite riddle it, with jokes; for in all
truth, there never was a ship so curiously
rigged. But Cui bono? as Confucius said of
his whiskers. It is the most perfect Chinese
uzzle we ever saw. The stage-coach in a
łºń. the four-and-twenty ivory balls, all
inside one another; the tremendous froth in a
pint bottle of Scotch,ale, are the easiest
solutions compared to it. It must be seen
to be properly understood, or rather to be
roperly misunderstood; fºr the more we
ooked at it, the less we could get to the
bottom of it. This mystery may have had
something to do in keeping it so well afloat
across 27,000 miles of not the most amiable
Ocean. ay it have a safe passage back
again to its native element at Canton! Only
we would recommend it this time to go straight
home, and not to go reeling about to America,
when it’s half-seas over. .
Now we must leave the Chinese Junk; but we wishit to be distinctly
understood that we do not run away because we are frightened by the
hideous faces that are painted on the lids of hampers, which they call
shields; but because there is a Whitebait dinner waiting impatiently for
us at LovEGRowe's. Before -

be perfectly at ease in such a small basin of water. We hope all
those—and their names are SMITH-who have money to lay out on
tomfooleries, will adopt our proposition, and never mind about the
EMPERQR of CHINA being angry at the diminution of his fleet. If he
wants, his man-of-war back again, why, let him come by all means

A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMMINS’S.
On the arm of her FITzRoy, Rosa went off to FUBsby's, that mag-
nificent shop at the corner of Parliament Place and Alycompayne
Square, a shop into which the rogue had often cast a glance of appro-
bation as he passed; for there are not only the most wonderful and
delicious cakes and conſections in the window, but at the counter there
are almost sure to be three or four of the prettiest women in the whole
of this world, with little darling caps of the last French make, with
beautiful wavy hair, and the neatest possible waists and aprons.
Yes, there they sit; and others, perhaps, besides FITZ have cast a
sheep's eye through those enormous plate-glass window panes. I
suppose it is the fact of perpetually living amongst such a quantity of
good things that makes those young ladies so, beautiful. They come
into the place, let us say, like, ordinary people, and gradually grow
handsomer and handsomer, until they blow out into the º: angels
ou see. It can't be otherwise: if you and I, my dear fellow, were to
ave a course of that place, we should become beautiful too. They live
in an atmosphere of the most delicious pine-apples, blancmanges, creams
(some whipt, and some so good that of course they don't want whipping),
i. tipsy-cakes, ºf...; hundred thousand sweet and
ovely things. Look at the preserved fruits, look at the golden ginger
the outspreading ananas, the darling little rogues of China, oranges,
ranged in the gleaming crystal cylinders. . Mon Dieu / Look at the
strawberries in the leaves. Each of them is as large nearly as a lady's
reticule, and looks as if it had been brought up in a nursery to itself.
One of those strawberries is a meal for those young ladies behind the
counter; they nibble off a little from the side, and if they are very
hungry, which can scarcely ever happen, they are allowed to go to the
crystal canisters and take out a rout-cake or macaroon. In the evening
they sit and tell each other little riddles out of the bon-bons; and when
they wish to amuse themselves, they read the most delightful remarks,
in the French language, about Love, and CUPID, and Beauty, before
they place them inside the crackers. They always are .# down
good things into MR. EUBSBY's ledgers. It must be a perfect feast to
read them. Talk of the Garden of Eden' I believe it was nothing to MR.
FUBsby's house; and I have no doubt that after those young ladies
have been there a certain time, they get to such a pitch of loveliness at
last, that they become complete angels, with wings sprouting out of
their lovely shoulders, when (after giving just a preparatory balance or
two) they fly up to the counter and perch there for a minute, hop down
again, and affectionately kiss the other young ladies, and say "Good
bye, dears, we shall meet again la haut,” and then with a whirr of their
i.º. wings, away they fly for good, whisking over the
trees of Brobdingnag Square, and up into the sky, as the policeman
touches his hat. -
It is up there that they invent the legends for the crackers, and the
wonderful riddles and remarks on the bon-bons. No mortal, I am sure,
could write them.
I never saw a man in such a state as FITzRoy TIMMINs in the presence
of those ravishing houris. MRs. FITZ having explained that they re-
quired a dinner for twenty persons, the young ; asked what MR.
and MRs. Fitz would like, and named a thousand things, each better
than the other, to all of which Fitz instantly said yes. The wretch
was in such a state of infatuation that I believe if that lady had pro-
F. to him africaseed elephant, or a boa-constrictor in jelly, he would
ave said, “Oh yes, certainly; put it down.”
That Peri wrote down in her album a list of things which it would
make your mouth water to listen to. But she took it all quite calmly.
Heaven bless you ! They don't care about things that are no delicacies
to them 1, But whatever she chose to write down, FitzRoy let her.
After the dinner and dessert were ordered (at fussy's they furnish
i.;; dinner and dessert, plate and china, servants in your own
livery, and if you please, guests of title too), the married couple retreated
from that shop of wonders; Rosa delighted that the trouble of the
dinner was all off their hands, but she was afraid it would be rather
expensive.
'Nothing can be too expensive which pleases you, dear,” FITz said.
“By the way, one of those young women was rather good-looking,”
Rosa remarked; “the one in the º with the blue ribbons.” (And she
cast about the shape of the cap in her mind, and determined to have
exactly such another.
. “Think so? I didn't observe,” said the miserable hypocrite by her
side; and when he had seen Rosa home, he went back, like an infamous
fiend, tº order, something else, which he had forgotten, he said, at
...'. Get out of that Paradise, you cowardly, creeping, vile
Serpent, you !
ntil the day of the dinner, the infatuated fop was always going to
FUBSBy’s.. He was remarked there. He used to go before he went to
Chambers in the morning, and sometimes on his return from the Temple;
but the morning was the time which he preferred; and one day, when
he went on one of his eternal pretexts, and was chattering and flirti
at the counter, a lady who had been i. j, paper an
eating a half-penny bun for an hour in the back shop (if that paradise
may be called a shop)—a lady stepped forward, laid down the Morning
Herald, and confronted him.
That lady was MRs. GASHIEIGH.
FitzRoy was in her º and she resumed a sway over his house, to
shake of which had been the object of his life, and the result of many
battles. And for a mere freak-(for on going into FUBsby's a week
afterwards he found the Peris drinking tea out of blue cups, and eating
stale bread and butter, when his absurd passion instantly vanished)–
I say, for a mere freak, the most intolerable burden of his life was
put on his shoulders again—his mother-in-law.
On the day before the LITTLE DINNER took place—and I promise you
we shall come to it in the very next chapter—a tall and elegant middle-
aged gentleman, who might have passed for an Earl, but that there
was a slight incompleteness about his hands and feet, the former being
uncommonly red, and the latter large and irregular, was introduced
to MRs. TIMMINs by the page, who announced him as MR. TRUNCHEoN.
“I’m TRUNCHEoN, Ma'am,” he said, with a low bow.
“Indeed!” said Rosa. -
“About the dinner, M’m, from FUBSBy’s, M'm. . As you have no
butler, M'm, I presume you will wish me to act as sich. I shall bring
two persons as haids to-morrow; both answers to the name of John.
I’d best, if you please, inspect the primisis, and will think you to allow
your young man to show me the pantry and kitching.”
TRUNCHEoN spoke in a low voice, and with the deepest, and most
respectful melancholy. There is not much expression in his eyes, but
from what there is, you would fancy that he was oppressed by a secret
sorrow. Rosa trembled as she surveyed this gentleman's size, his
splendid appearance, and gravity. “I am sure,” she said, “I never shall
are to ask him to hand a glass of water.”. Even MRs. GASHIEIGH
when she came on the morning of the actual dinner-party, to superintend
matters, was cowed, and retreated from the kitchen before the calm
majesty of TRUNCHEoN.
And yet that great man was, like all the truly great—affable.

CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
THE MONKEY THAT WENT UP
IN A BALLOON.
ANDIDLY, Mr. Punch, I am
a monkey, and not ashamed
to own it. (I could wish,
Mr. Punch, that all of my
species residing in London
were ... alike ingenuous.)
Well, Sir, I am a foreigner;
and therefore, it seems, my
feelings are to be violated;
my liberty, for, a season,
\ outraged. This, however, is
, the result of the feverish-
ness of the times. John
BULL thinks it only a proper
display of his own security,
to put contempt upon the
or alien. John BULL is
imself, so delighted with
his institutions, his sea-girt
isle, and all that—that to
5 complete his happiness he
ºn must be contemptuous to
the stranger.
“Mr. Punch, I have been
some years an inhabitant of
London. You may possibly
not recollect me; but I am
the same green monkey-
with a thoughtful earnest face, and restless eyelid—that has twenty times taken
off his Polish cap to you from the top of an o My former master, was an
Italian, late of Saffron Hill, now of the House of Correction, for feeding his poor
little boys from Naples with melted tobacco-pipes instead of macarone.
“The music I have suffered upon the top of that organ I shall not speak of; at
least, only a word or two. What have I endured from the Ethiopian melodies?, for,
Sir, iam a native of Ethiopia. Therefore, the music—the airs of my country—have
carried me back to my f. clime; have, in thought, waſted me back to a green
wife, and a green and happy family, where the only cane I ever knew was a cane
with sugar in it. Many a time, Sir, have I sat upon the top of that organ-trying
to think it a palm-tree—with my thoughts buried in my wife and family,–when an
inhuman tugging at my chain would almost wrench my heart out; and with m
bosom running out in tears at my º I have been compelled to twitch my Polis
cap from my burning brow to beg a halfpenny

—to ride a poodle in the streets of London; and, to make the mortification all the

esperation. I have been made to dance the slack-wire—I have-
“But let me hurry to the extreme of degradation. -
“At length, Mr. Punch—at length, and to cumulate my misery—they have sent
me up in a balloon!
“Yes, Sir, the person, the liberty of the helpless foreigner upon your shores has
been grossly violated in my unhappy person. To sit squat upon an organ was bad
enough; to beg for halfpence was worse; to ride a tail-less poodle was, I thought,
the extreme of degradation; until I was made to skip upon the slack-wire.
Degraded to this, I snatched my cap from my brow, and screamed defiance at fate.
“Destiny,' Iyelled, “you have done your worst, and I defy you.” Miserable me!
“The next day I was sent up in a balloon from Cremorne Gardens! I refer you
to the columns of the Times newspaper for the particulars. But I will myself strive
to pluck up the nerve to repeat them. . I *Tºº me to say—packed in a
º: for an experiment. An experiment! Upon me / Descended from the
lue Monkey, with a diamond in his head that no king can boast of in his crown.
But, read, Mr. Punch. The demoniacal reporter observes:–
“‘The ascent was a fine one;—[was it?)—the balloon took a course from the west over London;
there was little wind, and the sky being clear, it continued long in signt, so that a good oppor-
tunity was afforded to the spectators to form an opinion of the parachutes.”
“It is not now my intention to write a book upon the ascent. I do not at
. urpose to tell May Fair how it really looks to people really above it;
ow small, and of what little fillagree work much of its greatness is. This work,
when it has sufficiently fed upon my brain—like a worm upon a hazel kernel-shall,
like the worm, come out.
. “The cold-blooded penny-a-liner continues—"When the balloon was at an
immense elevation, the º: were let off simultaneously.” . There were three
parachutes, with an inoffensive foreigner in the shape of a monkey in each. The
reporter, with a diabolical coolness, proceeds:–
“‘The parachute of MR. HAMPtoN was obviously, the best ; it preserved a perfect perpen-
dicular throughout the whole of the immense space through which it descended, and came down
steadily and without any dangerous rapidity.” -
“True enough; but no thanks to MR. HAMPTON. No, Sir, the credit is due
to me—to me, the monkey passenger of that conveyance, whose nerves preserved
the perfect perpendicular” of the parachute, that otherwise would no doubt have
wiß gled itself into annihilation.
“I s not spoil my book by here disclosing my emotion upon my descent.
How the sun twirled and twirled about like the pewter
plate upon the point of a juggler's sword; how the whole
º went round and round like a bright-blue humming-top.
this—it is only fair to my publisher—I shall keep for
my book.
“And now, Mr. Punch, let me ask where is this to stop?
I have already communicated with the Ambassador–
ABD-EL-MUFF-of-A-FELLAH-for Ethiopia, who will no
doubt demand his passports of Lord Fºo. The
other two monkeys being natives of Gibraltar, and therefore
under British supremacy, have, I fear, no remedy; unless
a remedy much worse than the grievance: I of course allude
to MR.URQUBART.
“But let me close with the reporter:-
“‘The monkeys were brought back in safety to the grounds,
and received the caresses of a very large assembly, attracted by their
enterprise.”
“Now, Mr. Punch, to a monkey of proper feeling—to
a monkey possessing any claim to the common decencies of
Monkeydom—this is the greatest insult of all. My life,
whether I will or no, is to be put in danger, and then I am
to be ‘caressed” if I escape with a whole skin. What a
reasonable monkey—as I really am—considers a piece of
i. tomfoolery, is to be turned and twisted to his glori-
Callon.
“I shudder to think of it; but from what I have already
heard, there is a conspiracy getting up among certain young
ladies of certain families to coerce me to all their evening |
parties, as—par excellence—
“THE MonkEY THAT went UP IN A BALLooN.”
&ſjt #mbignant 330Littman.
THEY say we are resigning!
Heed not the idle tale
Of crafty knaves, combining
Our honour to assail.
No—till life's thread be broken
We’ll ne'er desert the lists
Which—duty's noble token—
We wear around our wrists.
|
In spite of service doubled,
And though of rest debarr'd,
Whilst P. peace is troubled
We’ll stick to Scotland Yard'
Yes, unfatigued, undaunted,
Our oil-skin capes we'll don;
And still, when we are wanted
Our cry shall be “Move oni"
No—by each area-railing
To recollection sweet
Never, with courage failing,
Will we desert our beat!
The loved one—and the luncheon—
This heart shall ne'er forget,
This hand shall wield the truncheon,
And wear the Berlin yet.
Who was the faithless talker
That raised the rumour mean?
Was’t the perfidious WALKER,
Or CHEEks, the false Marine?
We scout the accusation;
'Tis all a hoax—a do–
We scorn the fabrication-
Our corps is still true blue.
Cruel Hoax.
PUNCH is requested by LoRD BRough AM to state “that
there is unhappily no truth in the report of a sum of money
having been bequeathed to his Lordship by the late MR.
WATT, of Aston-Hall.” However, for the information of
affluent parties who may feel disposed to do what MR, WATT
has, most emphatically, not done, namely, to leave £20,000
to an ex-Chancellor who has deserved well of his country,
Punch is further desired to state that copies of a legal form
of bequest may be had upon application at No. 4, Grafton
Street, Bond Street. An early application is required.

A FEW KNOCKS ON KNOCKERS.
It seems that Art is knocking at every
man's door. We are , having Fine Arts
knockers; but as the designs of those we
have seen are not worth a rap, we present
manufacturers with sketches of a few which
are warranted to answer in any climate,
even the Equinox. Our great object is, that
ou shall know a man instantly by his
{... For instance, if your hand was
on a Gothic door-handle, you would jump
at once to the conclusion that some member
of the family of PUGINs lived inside, and
you would knock accordingly in the Gothic
style. Great feeling, and a deal of meaning,
may be thrown into these simple appendages
to the Wooden Doors of Old England.
Every Sheriff's-officer's house, where hos-
pitality is given to distressed persons, upon
the dearest terms, might be epigrammed with
a knocker of an officer in the touching act
of shouldering his victim. It would have
all the effect of a bird of prey over a barn.
Comic authors—and we are all comic, or
attempt to be so, now-a-days—will of course
take Punch as their prototype, for we find
they always steal one or two of our features
when they wish
to make a blow.
We are perfectly
willing to give º
} our countenance *
at all times to º
the Fine Arts ;
but still we are
not ambitious to
have our portrait
taken as a door-
knocker ; so we
beg no comic author will make a handle of
our great organ, and will choose other means
of knocking than by wringing our nose. Other
funny subjects can be selected. . There are
several heads in the House of Commons
most admirably adapted for knockers. We H -
have ourfinger
at present on
two or three that would make a great
noise in the country, if turned to that pur-
pose. There is likewise an Ex-Chancellor
—we do not like mentioning his name—
who would shine splendidly in the charac-
ter of a door-knocker. The range, in fact,
is infinite. A doctor’s door might have a
skull; a lawyer's a sheep under the
shears; and the barrister's an empty shell.
. The series, like the French Revolu-
tions, is endless; only we must acknow-

An Unanswerable Correspondent.
A GENTLEMAN, who tells us very liberally he has just arrived from
the country, writes to be informed whether the House of Commons has
removed to Holborn, and continues its sittings, there? For he says
that he has observed written up in a shop full of wooden machines, a
large placard, “Best JointED CLOGs HERE,” and he imagines, from the
little progress business has been making at St. Stephen's, that the
*Bes: Cºos” can be no other than those Members who have been
F. the Session, and nothing else, at St. Stephen's. The gentleman
rom the country is referred to the shop in question for an answer. We
recommend him to go in and ask for Lord ;oHN, and to see what sort of
a Clog they will show him. We have no time to answer such questions.
THE EASTERN COUNTIES AGAIN.
... OUR old friend, the Eastern Counties Railway, has been transferring
its irregularities from the passengers to the cattle, and a cow going
from Norfolk to Shoreditch has become very like the “Gentle ZITELLA,”
in being detained “so long on the road.” We have heard a shocking
case of an aged pig, who was “advised” as having started from London
on Saturday, and who did not reach his destination, Norwich, until
Wednesday afternoon...We know the difficulty of being able to “please
the pigs” is proverbial, but surely the poor creature in question had a
right to grunt out his objections against this cruel detention. , Happily
a stoker, touched by the affecting incident of a pig without victuals in
a railway cattle-box, offered the melancholy animal a mouthful of that
delicious mangel to which the expletive wurzel has been somewhat
unnecessarily subjoined. This sustained nature's failing energies, but
the poor brute arrived more dead, than alive—less pig than pork—at
the Norwich terminus, having been in great danger of being compelled
to fast by the slow train.
*
THE POSTMAN’S BENEFIT.
WE perceive that the poor underpaid letter-carriers of the Metro-
polis are making up, or endeavouring to make up, for the paltriness
of their salaries, by a Benefit at the Olympic Theatre, which, if
it were quite full, and contained 1500 persons at an average of a
shilling per head profit, after deducting expenses, would give exactly
threepence each to the 6000 postmen of #. and its suburbs. We
think the heads of departments would fancy themselves rather hardl
used if they were expected to put up with something very like half-
pay, and look for the remainder of their remuneration to Benefits at the
different theatres. LoRD John Russell would come rather poorly off
if he had to rely on a night at the Surrey, with his own Tragedy of
Don Carlos, aided by T. P. CookE at half-price. Nor do we think
LoRD MoRPETH, as Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, would
be satisfied with a cutting down of his official income, and the privilege
of calling upon his friends to support him at the Surrey Zoological.
Why, then, should the poor letter-carriers be reduced to †.ji
means of eking out an insufficient salary?
We have not seen the Programme, but we understand the celebrated
Letter Duet, with the farce of Deaf as a Post, and other appropriate
entertainments, have been resolved upon. Between the pieces there
will be a grand display of dexterity, in opening a letter, and sealing
it up again, by a retired veteran of the department, and the amusements
will terminate with the Grand Knocker Movement from SEBASTIAN
BACK's celebrated figure in A,B,C, composed in 1826 for the Two-
pennies, by general desire.
SIBTHORP SHOWETH A PROPER SPIRIT.
A Few nights ago, CoLoNEL SIBTHoRP—to show in the most mag-
manimous manner his contempt for the advice of MR. CoBDEN—said,
“Whatever way the honourable gentleman directed him to go, he
should go in the directly opposite direction.” . Thus, if in a lively
moment the Hon. Member for the West Riding should desire the Hon.
Member for Lincoln to “go to Bath and get his head shaved,” it may
reasonably be expected that the Colonel would go to Birmingham, and
sacrifice his whiskers. There is a certain pig, illustrious in Irish
history: the pig that could only be induced to go to Fermoy when he
thought he was being driven to Cork. In the late resolve of the
º it is clear that he has stooped to copy a member of the swinish
itude.
Extraordinary Novelty.
As we like to encourage enterprise in every branch of trade, we beg
to call the attention of all sight-seers to the new features that have
lately been added to the exhibition at St. Paul's Cathedral. In addition
to the Gold Cross, there is now appended the Surveyors'. Gallery, which
has been erected at a tremendous cost. The only thing of the kind
that we recollect, bearing any resemblance to it, was the gallery at
Vauxhall, from which IL DIAvolo ANTONIO precipitated himself when
he made his Terrific Descent in an envelope of fireworks. The one at
St. Paul's, however, is much stronger, and, we are glad to state, will not
be pulled down during the entire holidays. There is no extra charge for
seeing it. - - -
tº Please observe, the admission is only 4d. Babies gratis. Be in
time ! be in time !
TURF FLOWERS.
LoRD GEORGE's abuse has the recognised qualities of good Turf fire

A PARLIAMENTARY COLD WATER, CURE.
MR. HuME very properly complains of the º talk of Members
of the Commons. There is no doubt of the alarming fact; the Tongue of
Parliament has grown too long and toolarge. Like the tongue of a certain
species of parrot, it is in preposterous disproportion to the brevity of its
body. MR. HuME proposes that certain Members, under certain con-
ditions, should only be permitted to speak for half-an-hour. We would
make this another Point of the Charter. Few Members are so full of
knowledge that they may not pump themselves entirely dry in thirty
minutes. The ancients measured time by an instrument that dropt
water; a machine called a clepsydra. Now, we would, improving upon
this notion, measure Parliamentary time by the power of the lymph;
and after this manner:-
..We would have every Member about to address the House, place
himself in a sort of roofed pulpit. He should not be permitted to utter
a syllable from any other place. Well, from this pulpit there must be
a wire, leading to the chair of the Speaker. The Member having had
his full thirty minutes' discourse, should be summoned by the Speaker
to remove himself to his seat. Two minutes for we would do nothing
rashly, uncourteously-two minutes' grace should be allowed. If, after
then, the Member persisted to address the House, the Speaker should
touch the wire, which, communicating with the roof of the pulpit,
should act like the string of a shower-bath, and immediately flood the
ºrator. No call to “Order” could, in our opinion, behalf so efficacious
Again, should a verbose, stammering Member, with sundry bottles of
champagne fizzing and effervescing from under his white waistcoat, still
insist upon transgressing the half-hour, he would be soundly ducked,
as was done in the good old times, for the misdemeanor of scolding.
THE HEINOUS HUMBUGS.
THE HEINEs of º or, as some folks who cannot catch the
German pronunciation call them, the Heinous Humbugs, are continually
bringing their lottery schemes under the attention of the British public;
but a circular lately sent round, beats every preceding thing of the kin
within our wide experience. The circular requests a money-order for
£410s, or a Bank note of England for £5, on the kind return of a
certain ticket that may or may not have reached the individual who is
requested to return it. Perhaps if he ever, received it, he threw it
behind the fire as waste paper, directly he got it; and it is of course in
consideration of its very doubtful value, that an option is allowed in
the sum demanded to be paid for it. An order for £410s, or a £5
note, presents an alternative of such a perplexing, nature, that there is
every inducement to pursue the *Wºº, so far as to send
back neither one sum nor the other. e have no doubt that the
correspondents of the Heinous Humbugs will avail themselves of the
privilege conceded by the loose and indefinite nature of the demand, to
treat it in the same indefinite style, by making no reply to it. .
Dramatic.—wery Munificent.
It is said in the Green-rooms—and therefore we do not vouch for the
veracity of the report—that the receipts of Drury Lane Theatre, on the
approaching state visit of HER MAJESTY-will be handsomely devo
to the necessities of the late Monte Cristo Company. This is very
magnanimous. Popular ignorance breaks ahead, and a humane philo-
sophy applies golden ointment as a plaster.

A LASS OF WAX.
OUR old friend, MADAME Tussaud, is º in sticking like
wax to the improvement of her Exhibition, which is enriched almost
every week by the addition of some new º The last importa-
tion is a Chinese gentleman in the original clothes he wore at Pekin,
and who must have accordingly parted with his wardrobe to some
Chinese old-clothesman in order to enable MADAME Tussaud to repre:
sent him with the accuracy that is always professed in the saloons of
Baker Street. The individual in question is supposed to have been the
generous Howqua. - -
We believe that Howqua’s last moments were divided between
CAPTAIN Pipping and MADAME Tussaup, by his giving to the first the
recipe for combining the hundred teas, and making the latter the legatee
of his Chinese wrap-rascal, and Pekin tweedish trowsers, in which he is
now to be seen side by side with HERMAJESTY, JENNY LIND, Pius THE
NINTH, Tawell, Burke, HARE, and the other waxen illustrissimi and

THE MODEL FAST MAN.
You know him at once by his being the noisiest, the most conspicuous
person wherever he is...His dress, too, never fails to attract public
notice. He is unhappy if not seen—he is miserable if not heard. ...
In the street he flourishes a little stick, which, for want of something
better to do, he rattles against the ºf; H. stares ladies in the
face, and takes his hat off to carriages, and delights in kissing his hand
to some old dowager who is looking out of a drawing-room window.
sedan-chairishis amusement. He stops the porters, and asks them
what they will him to Buckingham Palace and back again for?
He directs hackney-coaches to drive to the British Museum, and be put
immediately under a glass-case amongst the Fossils. He takes a card
that is offered to him by a street conjuror, and gives him in return one of
his own, with an intimation that he “shall be º to see him at any
time between two and four.” He walks behind fat old ladies, and is
very loud in the praises “of the jolly mad bull there is in the next
street.”. He rings area-bells and inquires, “if they could, oblige
him with the loan of a cucumber-slicer for five minutes.” e
removes any pewter-pot he finds, and knocks at the door to ask
“if it belongs to them: it was hanging outside the railings, and
might be 'stolen by some unprincipled person.” Newsyenders are his
especial favourites. He calls them from the other side of the way to ask
“if they have got the Gentleman's Magazine of 1356, if not, he should
like to see the third edition of the Times to-morrow.” He makes cruel
faces to little, babies as they hang over their nurses' shoulders,
and is flattered if he makes them cry. If he meets with twins, he
is happy indeed. He shouts into sausageshops as he passes by-"D'ye
want any cats, dogs, or kittens, to-day?”. He hails an omnibus,
and whilst it is stopping, turns down the next street; and he looks at
a cabman till he drives up to him, when he wonders what the “cabbie”
wants: he was only admiring his handsome whiskers. If he finds a
looking-glass, he adjusts his toilet in it, and takes off his hat, and
bows tº himself, exclaiming, “On my word, you are looking remark.
ably well; I never saw you look better.” He looks at the milliners
through the shop-windows, and darts at them his most piercing smiles.
|
He stares at the watchmakers at their work, with intense curiosit -
and talks to them with his fingerstill they get up and leave their stools
with great indignation. If he meets the Lord Mayor's carriage with
three footmen on the footboard, he is sure to call out “Whip behind!”
and he laughs his loudest if the coachman should unconsciously lay his
whip across their calves. He is very rich in noises. His “WA-RI-Ety.”
is unequalled at two o'clock in the morning; and his collection of
“Ri too-loorals,” and “Rum-ti-oddities,” and select choruses, is not
to be surpassed by the oldest habitué of the coal hole." He whistles,
too, thrºugh his fingers, and can bark, crow, and bray quite naturally,
especially inside, Exeter. Hall, or any place where he shouldn't do it.
One of his º achievements is to enter an omnibus crowded with
females, and to display on his knees a large jar marked “Leeches.”
He delights, too, insprinkling cayenne-pepper and snuff on the floor of
a dancing-party after supper, or in going behind the cornet-à-piston
and making him laugh during along solo, when the struggling laughter,
ºozing out, in short gasps through the valves, nearly sends him into
fits. He glories in sending in six “brandies warm” to the chairman
and different gentlemen on the platform of a Temperance Meeting. He
makes a practice of ringing the bells of all doctors as he walks home.
In the theatre, he slams the box-door, and shouts. “Box-keeper!!”
with the most stentorian lungs. He is vociferous in his applause, and
sparkles up at the prospect of a row. He likes to sneeze during the
pathetic parts, and shouts “Bra

In respectable society he is awkward, and generally very quiet. He
does not dance, not knowing what to say to his partner. He hangs
about the door and staircase, and consoles himself with the cakes and
wine; he leaves early, for “he is dying for a pipe and a drop of beer.”
In his appearance he selects the gayest fast colours, and the more
the merrier. His shirt is curiously iñº with pink ballet-girls.
He has the winner of the Derby in his pocket-handkerchief. His boots
are very delicate, only keeping sole and body together with the aid of
mother-of-pearl buttons. He reveis in a white hat." His trowsers are
of the chess-board pattern. His shirt-pin is an Enormous Gooseberry,
that would make the fortune of a penny-a-liner. His coat has a New:
market expression, of the very deepest green. He is above gloves, but
encourages a glass, suspended by some magic process in his left eye.
His accomplishments are various. e carries in his waistcoat-
pocket the stump of a clay pipe, the bowl of which is quite black. He
can walk along, the parapet of Waterloº Bridge. He can slide, skate,
and box a little, and play the French horm. He can win a game of
billiards, and give you twenty. He is “up to a dodge or two” at cards.
He can imitate all the actors, and a brick falling down the chimney.
He can fry a pancake in his hat, and light a cigar at a *g. e
can in e a pair of sculls, and tool a tandem through Smithfield
Market. He can talk slang with a novelist, and “chaff a University
Man’ off his legs.” He can, also, “do a bill; and many other things,

ſº graces of life, and knows "a wrinkle” of everything. hlife,
lowlife, gambling life, sporting life, fashionable life, every kind of life he
isintimately acquainted with, particularly fast life. This consists in his
beginning the day six hours after everybody else, and finishing it six
hours later. It implies the knowledge, on his part, of the Polka, with
certain embellishments, and a constant attendance at Casinos, and other
places where that knowledge can be displayed. It involves, also, a course
of theatres, sporting-houses, masquerades, ſº cigar-shops,
cider-cellars, and early coffee-houses. To all of these the Monrº Fºst

does not keep pace with therapidity with which he runs, or rather gallops,
through life; and he annihilates everybody as slow, who presumes to
live like a rational creature. All books are slow—SHAkspeaRE is slow
—all domestic, all quiet enjoyments are slow. The country is very
slow, and so. are sisters. He even calls the railways slow... His
eat impulse is “Fast bind, fast find,” and he sighs that Society is not
ound by the same fast law. He is without shame, as he is without

and does not care how he insults an inferior. º ence, to him, is fun

humour is saying to everything, “I believe you, my bo-o-o-o:y.” In the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GRAND SPECIAL CONSTABLE TESTIMONIAL.
He result of the glorious, 10th of
April was celebrated with extra-
ordinary splendour lately at a most
fashionable chop-house in the
vicinity of Covent Garden. The
Globe gave a very jejune account
of the banquet: we shall humbly
endeavour to remedy this short-
coming by leaving for the future
historian of the Annals of English
Dinners, some farther details of
the Grand Special Constable Sym-
posium of the parish of St. Paul's.
It is well known that Covent
Garden parish is the very hot-bed
of Westminster politics. There
is no doubt that the existence
of the vegetable market in the
locality has had a subtle influence
upon the political exuberance...of
the place. Early patriots, like
early asparagus, have generally
: their first appearance in
Covent Garden. Mr. CochRANE
it will be remembered, showed
himself—on his first canvas–with
the first half-pint of greenest
ooseberries. . There has always
een a *. reciprocity be-
tween the gardeners and, the
Westminster public men: , thus,
i.the .."; ". failed in
gammon, Une gardener was
never behind with his spinach.
Moreover, the professions and doings of M.P.'s for Westminster have
very often been typified by the Covent Garden pottles of strawberries;
beginning with very decent fruit indeed, but becoming shabbier and
shabbier to the end. There is SIR. DE LACY EVANs, for instance:
consider his political pottle. He, it will be remembered, showed some
very good fruit at the commencement; but when required by his
constituents to march on with the HUME and CoBDEN "...i.
his political strawberries became smaller and smaller; faint, and weak,
and insipid in the mouth, and altogether different from the big, sound,
full-flavoured berries that lay upon the top.
Strawberries, however, since the days of ELIZABETH, have been
made to illustrate, and receive illustration from, public doings. ...Does
not BAcon, in his Apothegms, relate a strawberry quirk of Virgin
BEss? “For she,” º: the Chancellor, “was wont to, say, upon the
commission of sales, ‘that the commissioners used her like strawberry-
wives, who had two or three great strawberries at the mouth of their
pot, and all the rest were little ones; so they made her two or three
good prizes of the first particulars, but fell straightways. ” (There is
no doubt, we think, that the sort of “British Queens” now so big and
luscious in the mouth, were so named in memory of this pithy saying;
: are to be considered the great ones at the mouth of the world’s
pottle.)
It would certainly take more time and º than Punch can devote
to the subject, to illustrate the intimate and pleasing connexion between
Covent Garden Market and Govent Garden Politics. It is well known
that Westminster Hustings were erected in front of the Market in the
finest spirit of accommodation for those unsophisticated patriots who
might desire to explain their notions to the unpopular candidate by
means of potatoes, cabbage-stalks, or turnips. , Arguments of the sort
being always at hand, the discussion was sure to be carried on in the
most piquant, and often in the most convincing style. Everything
about the Market, smacks of politics. The adºrning motto of the
Bedford family-Che sara, sara, “What will be, will be,”—is of sin
i. and has often been beautifully illustrated by the Whigs,
when determined to make bad worse, and worse seldom better.
Everything is political in Covent Garden. All its memories—all its
associations. The beautiful Duchess of Devonshire still haunts the
place on polling-day; and old BURDETT, in shadowy top-boots, and
smalls of yellowest moonshine, may now and then be seen by the
Oldest Inhabitant of the Market, looking with wistful face at potted
laurel-trees, thinking of triumphant chairing when he rode in a bower of
bay. and his horses carried whole shrubberies about them.
Thus, is it to be wondered at that politics should hold the people of
St. Paul's, Covent-Garden—hold them like nippers? Is it a matter of
astonishment that the parochial heart—for these last hundred years—
nursing and beating with party emotions, should cause strange outward
developments of the inward feeling? At this moment, we are informed
there is a distinguished carver and gilder who came into the world
marked in the small of his back with a Fox, which when one of the
Melbour.NE family stood for Westminster, somehow turned into a
Lamb; but which has come back to the Fox again, the mark getting
redder and redder with the approach of the hunting season.
Wherefore, it may be asked, have we at §: prefaced the
account of the Special Banquet f The answer is, we take it, conclusive.
St. Paul's, Covent-Garden, being at once the most political and the
most enlightened parish in the United Kingdom, its doings ought to be
quoted and set before all men, as their political and social creed and
pattern., Thus, when the Special Constabulary of Covent Garden
present their Chief with a . piece of plate, the mode and the
object of the presentation ought to be scrupulously followed by all men
to whom the memory of the glorious 10th is precious. -
The banquet took place at the well-known Chump-and-Gridiron Chop
House. At two o'clock the º began to arrive.
It is usual to say of a dinner that it was composed of every delicacy
of the season. This we think absurd in the way of luxury. The true
test of magnificence is to present everything out of the season: it is more
difficult, and was triumphantly manifest on the occasion in question.
The minor toasts being drunk, a most distinguished Special rose. He
then took out of his pocket what we at first imagined to be a prize
cucumber, done up in silver paper. . Breathless silence was maintained,
whilst the Speci . fold after fold. In the course of twenty
minutes he then made visible to the naked eye—
A SPECIAL Constable's STAFF, IN solid silver (teste Hall-mark).
A thunder of applause burst upon this piece of plate. The Special
then proceeded to the business of presentation. He said, that he thought
the staff being made of virgin metal, would prove to the mob that the
Constable had vested property; and that with so much metal in his hand,
he had the price of many steaks in the country. (Cheers.) A blow upon
the head of Rebellion with that staff would perhaps be the greatest
change of silver ever given by a private individual. (Applause.)
The Chairman rose, and said:—“Gentlemen, I receive this gift with
the liveliest feelings of gratitude; of gratitude that it shall be my first
endeavour to give a perpetual form and expression to; and in this
manner: the silver being no use whatever to me as a staff, I shall, that
I may always think of the givers, have the staff immediately thrown
into the melting-pot; and, as f say, to keep you in my constant
recollection, have the metal reproduced as–a complete set of spoons.”

Transported Insurgents—The King of Convicts.
The Paris Insurgents, with their wives and children, it is said, are to
be transported to the Marquesas. The Daily News doubts the report,
and asks, “Where is the fleet, to be ſound to º people, viz.
seven thousand insurgents, with their wives and children, round Cape
Horn?” The fleet—upon a fair contract—may be found in the Thames;
and, considering the character and purpose of the transports, where
could be picked so good an admiral for the expedition as from the
bowers of Claremont? Indeed, we do not see why old ULysses-Louis-
PHILIPPE, himself—should not sail with the batch, and, succeeding
PoMARE, be crowned with a cocoa-nut diadem, and invested with royal
robes of parrots' plumes, here and there mixed with a feather from
congenial cormorant and magpie.

THE WINDSOR PARK EXCLUSION BILL.
To the Right Honourable the House of Commons in Parliament
Assembled. The Petition of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE and
ALEXANDER Pope, Humbly Sheveth:
THAT your Petitioners (as perad.
venture it may be known to your
Honourable House) are certain
Poets, of whom one hath written
a Poem, entitled Windsor Forest,
and the other a Play called The
Merry Wives of Mindsor; in virtue
of which Performances, they, your
7ſ. ºl Petitioners, enjoy no small Credit
ºr and Reputation with the British
| | Public:
That the said Play and Poem
of your Petitioners do contain
sundry and divers allusions, to
the Scenery in the neighbourhood of Windsor, to the right under-
standing and comprehension whereof, and therefore to the due appre-
ciation of those your Petitioners' works, it is necessary that the Public
should enjoy free access to such Scenery: -
That your Petitioners have seen, with alarm and *H. that a
Bill hath been introduced into your Honourable House, which Bill,
should it unhappily pass, will almost entirely deprive the Public of this
their ancient Right: - --- -
That in particular, the effect of this Bill will be to close and shut up
the greater part of the Long Walk in the Great Park at Windsor, and
sº
also the whole of the Home Park, including the walk from Windsor to |h
Datchet by HERNE's Oak, which have been open and common to all
men from time immemorial: --- - -
That great injury will accrue to your Petitioners if their readers, that
is to say, the People in general, are hindered and prevented from
roaming, strolling, and meditating in the above-named places, and
pursuing the pleasant fancies and ruminations by them suggested in
connection with your Petitioners' Writings: - -
That the green-sward surrounding HERNE’s Oak º: hal-
lowed ºš and sacred to the memory of your Petitioner, WILLIAM
SHAKspeARE: And that to deprive the Public of the very sight of such
ground will be to inflict a grievous wrong upon the said SHAKSPEARE,
by snapping and, tearing asunder the bonds of º whereby,
through the recollections of those precincts, he is bound to the hearts
of Englishmen;...
That your Petitioners have a vested interest in the turf, and flowers,
and the forest trees, and glades, and foliage of the Parks at Windsor,
which it is sought by the aforesaid Bill to shut up and inclose, to the
great injury and detriment of your Petitioners:
That your Honourable House hath respected the vested interests of
the City of London in filth and mud; wherefore your Petitioners trust
that you will also respect, their vested interests in green fields, and
woodlands, and sweet-smelling flowers:
That the interferences contemplated by this Bill with your Peti-
tioners’ Rights and the Public Enjoyment, are described in the Preamble
thereof as alterations and improvements, which “would be conducive
to the privacy and comfort of the QUEEN’s Most Excellent Majesty, as
well as to the accommodation of the Town of Windsor:”
That your Petitioners humbly submit that such alterations would be
anything but improvements, and that, whatever they would conduce to,
they would conduce to nothing so little as to the accommodation of the
Windsor People; for that they would greatly lengthen the journey
between Windsor and Datchet, and totally destroy its pleasantness:
That the privacy and comfort of HER MAJESTY are at present effec-
tually secured by a deep ditch, surmounted by an iron fence, whereinto
the pathway through the Home Park hath of late years been converted;
whereby HER MAJESTY's subjects are effectually prevented from gettin
flºº distant sight of her, and not only of herself but of her Roy
astie :
That HER Most ExCELLENT MAJESTY doth usually reside at Osborne,
or else at Buckingham Palace, and doth comparatively seldom occupy
her Castle of Windsor:
. Lastly, that the cost of these alterations and so-called improvements
is estimated at £280,000. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly hope
that your Honourable House will not, considering the present ãº
of the Nation, consent that so large a sum should be thrown away on
any account, and least of all to the injury of your Petitioners, and to
the inconvenience, discomfort, annoyance, wrong, and privation of the
Windsor People, and the Nation at large. And your Petitioners, as
in duty bound, will ever pray.

Witness, Mr. Punch. ALEXANDER Pope.
{THE LAST OF THE CLAP TRAPS.
Much curiosity has been excited on the subject of the disappearance
from the stage of everything in the shape of clap-trap, and people are
asking on all sides why it is that those beautiful apophegms eginnin
with “The man who—” are no longer allowed to warm our hearts an
expand our minds at the playhouse. We miss from the British drama
all those magnificent eulogies on the character of “the British mer-
chant,” which used to fill us with admiration for all our tradesmen, an
look upon, them as such ſº beings, that we never thought of
insulting them by paying them—until we were shabbily reminded of the
necessity for doing so... We have long ago missed from the mouths of
our actors the emphatic “Let me tell you, Sir, that the poor man's
cottage is equal to the rich man's castle!” and we listen in vain for the
º: announcement that “Old England, with her Magna Charta for
a sail, the : for a mast, and the crown for a figure-head, will ride
out *: roughest gale that ever blew off the hat of the tar for all
weathers.”
We have, however, made the discovery that clap-trap is not dead, but
has merely changed its quarters; and though it has retired from the
dramatic boards, it flourishes as much as ever on the floor of the House
of Commons. “The flag that braved a thousand years” has been
moved from the minor theatres to the Lower House; and though, the
Heavy Man of the Surrey no longer inquires “When did Old England
ever turn her back on a foe or a friend?”, the Heavy Man of Parliament
will ask, in almost the same language, for the exact date “when Britain
refused to help an ally with her hand, or to put a sword in it against
an enemy?” Clap-trap has, in fact, been banished from over the water
and having stopped at the foot. of Westminster Bridge, has foun
its way to St. Stephen's. There it is as rampant as ever, with all its
“man who's,” its’; allow me to add's,” its “honest hand of industry’s,”
and its “flag that braved's,” with a string of other old familiar bits of
umbug too numerous to recollect, and too absurd to mention.
A PATTERN FOR PARLIAMENT.
* HUME observed the other night, in the House of Commons,
a -
“They had no fewer than five adjourned debates standing over.... He would
ask the House to consider seriously how it was possible to get rid of their present
entanglements.”
We would not generally advise our British Senate to take a leaf out
of any foreign book; but really, for once, we would beg its attention to
the following statement of the Times correspondent relative to the
Prussian Chamber:—
“Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour is the average of an address in the
Chamber; half an hour is an exception; one of an hour's length is a phenomenon.”
It is a pity that the House of Commons cannot “imitate the illus-
trious Roman,” and the sensible German, “in brevity.” We know
what description of persons are known by their much speaking, and
what must be thought of our Collective Wisdom when this is its
peculiar attribute?
EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON.
“TRUTH,” says somebody, whose name we have been unable to catch
“is strange, stranger than fiction; ” and we can vouch for the truth o
this, for we have lately witnessed a wonder that throws all the gigantic
f. ever invented completely into the shade. The marvel we
we witnessed was on a certain railway—if anything in the shape of a
railway can be called certain—on which a big train was travelling, when
the discovery was made, that though the wheels were twirling round at
the rate of 300 miles an hour, the vehicles were not making any pro-
gress whatever. On examination it was found that the rails had ac-
quired, by friction, such a wonderful smoothness that the wheels would
not hold, and thus, though the rotatory motion continued at a speed of
five miles per minute, the whole train remained in one position.
Many ways have been attempted of accounting for this great pheno-
menon, but we believe the true solution of the apparent mystery to be
that the Share Market has been so extremely flat as to have prevented
#.only the shares, but even the wheels from getting any purchase
at all.
Query.
CAN the alarming depression of “native talent in our theatres, at
this moment, be in anyway attributable to the sudden stoppage of the
*W. of French pieces?
hen the French theatres are ruined, how can the English ones
flourish P You might as well expect the West London mains to be full
when the River Lea was dried up. Cessante causá cessat effectus.

AN ILLUSTRATED PARLIAMENTARY DUEL.
WE give a Diagram of how honourable Members # “in a *...*.
sense,” or rather. “in a Parliamentary nonsense.” e do not quarrel wit
them for not fighting-for we dislike quarrelling in any case, especially if the
*i. is likely to lead to “pistols and coffee for two”—but we blame them
or the stupid display of valour, the hard words, the insults, and all the etceteras
that might lead to a meeting at Chalk Farm, if the absurdity was not so well
understood. . The following are, the points of the circle round which Members
revolve, chasing one another, with as much result as a dog running after his tail;
that is to say, only exciting the merriment of those who look on.
1st Round is the hard word.
2nd. The hard word returned.
3rd. They both setto. Hard hitting,
right and left. offensive.
6th. The little man did not mean to
say anything offensive. -
7th. They neither meant anything
4th. The little man in Chancery.” 8th. They shake hands, and , always
* 5th. The big man did not mean to entertained the very highest opinion of
hurt him. one another.
Thus ends the Parliamentary Duel, and it is best it should end thus; only the
thing is so absurd, that it never should have had a beginning. Cannot gentle-
men meet without insulting one another? The above diagram might be made
into an instructive toy for juvenile M.P.'s.
A QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE AND SUGAR.
A GENTIEMAN named BULL being in great trouble and distress of mind, is
anxious to be introduced to some Casuist who will undertake to quiet his con-
science. MR. BuLL is the proprietor of certain colonial possessions devoted to
the cultivation of sugar. these he, some years ago, abolished Negro slavery,
from a conviction that it was barbarous and wicked. In justice to his colonists
he entered into an tº: to place a prohibitive duty on slave-grown sugar.
his arrangement MR. BULL, being fond of sugar, and desirous of obtaining the
article cheap, subsequently #.
BULL is persuaded by his economical advisers that he did not, by so doing,
break faith with his colonists; but feeling uncomfortably dubious as to this point,
he would be glad to have it settled to his satisfaction. He has renounced slave.
holding, believing it to be criminal; but while he continues to consume slave-
grown sugar, it strikes him forcibly that he is in the same position as a receiver
of stolen goods. He will feel deeply grateful to any ingenious person who will
convince him that he is mistaken in this view.
. MR. BULL desires to enjoy cheap sugar, unalloyed by the reflection that he
is encouraging slavery. He wants to be enabled to congratulate himself on having
abolished slavery, without being obliged to reproach himself for admitting the
produce of slave labour. He wishes to reveſ, at the same time, in sugar and
self-complacency. He seeks, in fact, to be relieved from the disagreeable sus:
§§ that he is acting the part of a humbug; and any special pleader who will
o him this kindness will be handsomely rewarded.
THE BLACKING BATH.
THE Serpentine, that great Pond of Correction for refrac.
tory, dogs and convicted cats, looks at present, more like a
dyer's vat for jºiſ, articles of mourning into than apiece of
ornamental water, it is ornamental at all, it can only be a
“jet” ornament, for the water is “as black as your hat.” It
has more pretensions for a jet-d'eau than any fountain we
have yet seen, including the lively ginger-beer bottles in Trafal-
gar Square. it may be called a perfect “jetty.” Musicians who
wish to give their countenance to Ethiopian music, have only
to bathe in the Serpentine, and after a few dips they will have
one great requisite for the nigger melodies, for they will be
...i. in the face. We heard of a Count falling in, who
had on a pair of the most beautiful white trowsers—“perfect
ducks” they were-and they came out after the plunge a #.
of the “best blacks.” A young gentleman after one bath,
quite lost the lovely strawberry-and-cream, complexion he was
universally distinguished for, and now walks about town with
features muffled up in the most “inky sables.” - l
Really something ought to be done to this great reservoir of
blacking. Let DAY and MARTIN purchase it, or, sell it to
TURNER, or, if necessary, “try WARREN.”. It might wash an
elephant and give him a fine black-lead polish; but no gentle-
man, excepting one of colour, and that colour the deepest Indian
black, would think of putting his body into the liquid mis-
called water, unless for a masquerade or a matter of the
darkest mystery. It is a large stain on the lovely bosom of
Hyde Park—a blot on the escutcheon of the illustrious Ranger.
The sooner the Serpentine is washed of it, and the filth is
taken clean, away--if such a thing can be done “clean”—the
better it will be for the fair ladies who are in the habit of
driving in their carriages up and down the great tank of malaria.
Let no fond father allow his children to bathe, in it! Let no
sympathetic Duchess allow her “King Charles” to be dipped
into it! ...The first would not like to press to his heart a bunch
of little Blackamoors, and the second would faint at the notion
of nursing in her muslin arms a nasty little ſpoodle as dingy
as a kitchen poker. Our cry is, “Send for the Ranger and
duck him in it;”—we mean, make him bathe in it.
AFTER I CAME OUT.
Before I Wrºnt in.
IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE.
OUR fashionably-frivolous, though sometimes politically:
forcible contemporary, the Morning Post, in his Thursday's
memoranda of the movements of the Little Great, informs the
world of the astounding incident about to mark the biography
of the EARL OF YARBOROUGH... We were told, in language 9
simple grandeur, or grand simplicity, that “the noble Earl will
pass through the metropolis on Monday, on his way to York,
to act as President of the Royal Agricultural Meeting.” How
considerate of our contemporary to prepare the metropolis,
three days in advance, for such an event as the passage of the
EARL OF YARBOROUGH through the British capitall The para:
graph was as considerate as if it had contained the warning of
an approaching comet, for it put London on the alert, and pre-
vented it from being dazzled out of its five, six, or seven senses
—we almost forget which—by the too sudden appearance of
the EARL of YARBOROUGH. It will be remembered that on
Monday the day was scorchingly hot, blazingly fine, and all
that sort of thing, which may now be accounted for } the
fact that the EARL OF YARBOROUGH was jº through our
metropolitan, hemisphere on his way to York, revolving, we
suppose, all the way on his own axle-trees.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GOVERNESSES.–SISTERS OF MISERY.
E do not want any Parliamentary Reform
soever. The House of Commons is the
House of all the Cardinal Wirtues. Every
Member, from Lond JoHN himself down—
down-down to NewdegaTE, Spoon ER, and
SIBTHoRP, is an “entire and perfect chry-
solite” of a senator. There is nothing
amiss in Parliament; all the mischief is
* among the people themselves. We do not
want better M.P.'s—all we need, is a more
enlightened elective power. Education—
says SERIEANT TALFouBD—is the grand
thing needful; let us wait until the people
are educated, and then they shall have the
franchise. The time is not yet come.
Whereas, when two or three generations of
schoolmasters and schoolmistresses have done their best to school the
millions (how the schooling is to be paid for, is not to be thought of) why,
then, Lord JoHN Russell's great-grandson (for the Premiership, like
right of patent, will of course remain in the family) may bring in a
new Reform Bill, with a touching allusion to his illustrious ancestor,
giving the franchise to the lodger; and possibly—for better equality of
representation—allowing to #. Fulham, Kensington, and
Chelsea included, the luxury of one Member. We do not like to be too
sanguine, but we are willing to cocker ourselves with the hope that LoRD
John RussRLI's great-grandson may do this—for our successors. . .
Meanwhile, let us do our best for the encouragement of the scholastic
uality. Let us elevate the condition of the teacher, that his better
#. may act upon the pupil. With this determination beating at
our heart, we lay before the reader two most interesting documents.
We quote them-with the gravest assurance of their authenticity, being
conveyed to us, by a known correspondent—as the strongest evidence
of the growing importance of the character of the teacher.
The papers are from the principal of an Academy—where, we are
sure of it, all the stoic principles flourish like birch saplings—on the
banks of the Humber. †. first document is a touching letter, penned
by the wedded MINERya of the establishment. It is addressed to a
young lady, who, having read the general advertisement, writes—
doubtless in a flutter of hope—for the particulars:—
“MRs. begs to inform Miss that she wishes for a lady who will be
able to instruct a class of about ten little boys about three hours daily; to give
instruction to her two daughters in needlework; to superintend the washing and
dressing of MR. 's pupils, and to assist at table and in the wardrobe depart-
ment. These objects are paramount. Other valuable services would receive due
consideration. The salary proposed is not less than £20, nor more than £30 per
annum. AE2 allowed for travelling expenses. The lady to pay her own laundress.
MRs. trusts to engage one whom she may have pleasure in associating with,
and that the connection may be lasting. If Miss will fill up the enclosed
form as well as she is able, and return it, a definitive answer shall be given without
delay.—No. of pupils about thirty.”
There is a fine spirit of discipline, very strong and very eloquent,
throughout this. The lady's “class” has, moreover, a vagueness that
awakens fancy. The class is “about ten;” hence, it may be a dozen.
Well, the ten—or the about ten—boys being duly taught the humani-
ties, the young lady is then, called upon to teach single and double-
stitch to “two daughters.” And now comes a greater variety of
employment to give wings to the otherwise heavy hours. The young lady
is “to assist at table,” and “in the wardrobe department.” Whether
she is merely to preside at the potato-dish, or is to be expected to fulfil
the sterner º of carving the joint, is not set down. Neither is it
stated whether her assistance in "the wardrobe department”, of the
little boys is to be limited to putting on buttons, or is to be made more
onerous by the nice adjustment of patches. Further, the young lady
is to superintend the washing, towelling, and combing of “Mr.—'s
Pººl, ;” and their number is “about thirty.” -
holly to instruct ten boys—to teach sewing to two girls—to carve,
and mend, and patch, and darn for about thirty young innocents, being
moreover, their C.C.B.--or Companion of their Cold Bath—are, of course,
objects “paramount” in the Academy on the banks of the Humber;
and the emphasis with which they are touched upon, ought to recom-
mend the establishment (we shall be happy to insert an advertise-
ment from the principals) to Parents and Guardians. But these objects
paramount being effected, what a new field of exertion is laid open to
the teacher in her mysterious over-hours (the mystery being, to get
them), if, being of an active turn of mind, she will acquit herself of
“other valuable services !” They would receive “due consideration;”
and then we perceive that the salary cannot be less than £20, and—
should gray hairs await the instructress in her ºf. be
more than £30 (“the lady to pay her own laundress”) for her ordinary
work, the extra pay for extra duty is very encouraging. It is absolutely
a new development of The Pleasures of Hope!
hat may we not expect from the instruction of a multitude of such
teachers upon a future generation' Talk of the self-denial of the
Sisters of Charity; why, the heroism of such teachers—such Sisters
- of Misery-must have the noblest effect upon the higher and soberer
virtues of their apple-eating pupils.
“Wisdom is found with childhood 'bout her knees,”
writes WoRosworth ; but the poet neglected to specify the exact
duties of carving, stitching, and superintendence of the tub, with the
salary, minimum and maximum, to be enjoyed. The magnificent pro-
prietor of the Academy on the Humber has, we conceive, with singular
intelligence and liberality supplied the omission.
Now, however, comes, the trial. The young lady is “requested to
fill up the enclosed form.” . The reader has heard of various ordeals;
the red-hot ploughshare ordeal, the ordeal of poison—of boiling-water—
of molten lead; and other ingenious tests to try the strength and inno-
cence of weak and erring humanity; but for our part, we think the
Sister of Misery who—for not less than £20, and not more than £30 per
annum-fills up the subjoined to the satisfaction of the Philosopher and
Friend on Humber, has earned the noblest recompense of moral glorifi-
cation. We immediately behold her. She stands before us, wan, and
thin, and pale; not in a garden of roses, but beneath a clump of weepin
birch.-And she has her crown of misery; thirty sovereigns, j
like stellar halo, round about her beating brow.
As, however, this Humber test e sent to other applicants, and
as many of these—poor, ingenuous things!—may be puzzled to fill up
the form in a manner : of its intelligence, Punch will underwrite
a response to every query, the said response to be now and then modi-
fied according to the iar circumstances of the Sister of Misery.
“Mrs. requests that the following queries may be answered in the
hand-writing of the lady in question.”
[The lady will, therefore—it is the earnest advice of Punch-pen her
response, if she can any way obtain the implement, with a quill drawn
from the tail feathers of a Bird of Paradise. Nothing meaner ought to
make reply to such golden questions.]
“Have you had experience in teaching children?" During what time *
In schools or families, or how long in each '"
[For some 3. a teacher in the School of Adversity; can be well
recommended by suffering.]
“ What branches of learning do you profess to understand?”
[To carve a joint with no waste of fat; and to make tea upon tea-
leaves as strong as the first pot.]
“What accomplishments 2"
[Darning, fine-drawing, º: socks, taking grease out of boys'
jackets, and iron-moulds out of shirts.]
“Have you had much practice in plain needlework?–Ditto in orna-
mental **
[A good dealin plain-work; having made shirts for threepence a-piece
before reduced to the condition of a governess. In ornamental, worked
two kettle-holders for the Countess of CANAAN's stand at Fancy-fair,
for Untatooing the New Zealanders, or as the case may be.]
“Have you read any works on Education **
Yes.
ſ Name the authors or titles.”
[SATAN. Robert Montgow ERY.]
“Are you ATTACHED to the Established Church 2" -
Yº much attached: because of the superior accommodation of the
pews.
“Can you sing so as to lead children?”
[Yes: especially if to be led to the pastrycook’s.] -
“What do you consider the most important virtues to be cultivated in
children by the example of their teachers **
[To eat fat and lean together; and never to ask twice for pudding.]
“What vices are most to be feared '''
[Neglecting their pocket-handkerchiefs, and putting their fingers in
the butter.]
“What are the best grounds or incentives to good conduct?”
[Bull's-eyes, Buonaparte's ribs, brandy-balls, and the real Albertrock.]
“ What are the best punishments 2'"
[If boys, threaten to make them ushers; if girls, governesses.]
“Can you reprove children without using offensive epithets, such as
‘STUPID,” “NAUGHTY,” “TROUBLEsoME,’ &c. ** -
[Certainly. My reproofs are in this style—“Why don't you wipe
your nose, you darling cherub?” “What a mess you’ve made with
your milk-and-water, you love-bird!” “Take your thumb out of your
mouth, you pattern of an angel,” and so forth.]
“What is your age?” - -
[Here let the Governess set down her age by the register, adding
thereto five years for every twelvemonth of tuition.]
“Are you now, and have you generally been, in good health?’”
[Most happily constituted #. the situation. Lungs of iron, flesh
of granite, and heart of lead : otherwise, should not presume to apply
for the appointment.] -
“Are you able to rise at five in the morning in the summer, and at six
in the winter '" -
[Oh dear, yes; and would have no objection—to further the interests
of the establishment—never to go to bed at all.] -
There are three or four other queries, such as name and address, with
the address of clergyman “at whose church" the applicant has

WE WANT NO REFORM
To be said or sung by everybody.
DEDICATED To B. OSBORNE, ESQ., M.P.
Two pounds twelve and sixpence a head
Is in England the rate of taxation;
Seventy millions and upwards, 'tis said,
Is the average that’s raised on themation;
But we want no Reform;
Oh, no! certainly not!
Not a bit—not a jot.
Pooh! we want no Reform!
Out of twenty, ten shillings on tea
Are paid by the labouring classes;
Eight on coffee; on sugar—let’s see–
Why, six shillings, hard cash, by the masses;
But we want ho Reform;
Take the word of Lord JoHN,
We are going well on:
No-we want no Reform!
Five on soap, four on beer, and fourteen
On spirits—sixteen on tobacco
Do they pay to our Lady the QUEEN,
ut what, nevertheless, says Lond Jackoº |
“Why, we want no Reform, -
Allis proper and right,
Satisfactory quite;
Pish! we want no Reform!”
On Industry, more than on Wealth,
There’s the weight of the Income Tax pressing,
But the nation’s in excellent health,
And we’ve no wrongs that call for redressing.
So we want no Reform;
Oh, no! not in the least;
We’re not plundered nor fleeced.
Stuff and nonsense! We want no Reform:
MR. RoberT Houdin’s “Bottle.”
nay, more than that: for we really believe if HoRACE happened to drop
in at the St. James's, and called for a poculum of his old Falermian,
that Mons. Houp1N would pourit out for him, and then ask him if he
would have a little magnum of Cyprus!
There are many good things, in MR. CRUIkshANK’s “Bottle,” but
we doubt if its greatest admirer could squeeze a bumper of Bur-
ndy, or the smallest glass of Madeira out of it. In fact our moral
ALlot would not be very well º if any one could, considering he
wishes to expose the horrors of drinking, and not to prove the pleasures
of it; and that his “Bottle” was drawn, not to go to men's lips, but
to their hearts. We implore Monsieur Houbin, however, to be
careful, or else, some night, if he does not put a timely “stopper” on
his liberality, his audience may be carried off to the station-house and
locked up, on the dreadful charge of inebriety. The scenes, too, that
might occur at his theatre would be rather unpleasant for the liberal
conjuror, if he had a number of young men rushing up to him for “just
one glass more.” We advise him to limit every lady to two glasses,
and every gentleman to four, unless they have been dining, when the
best thing to give them—we mean the gentlemen-will be a bottle of
soda-water. The drink should be varied, also, in this warm weather,
and be made to consist of some of Sox.ER’s “Nectar,” or SAINs-
BURY's summer beverages.

ENGLISHMEN AND GLORY.
“To M. Ponch E.
“Monsieur PonchE, “Square of Leicester, July 11, 1848.
“The other day I did see in your contemporary the Times an
account of a dinner of your Specials Constables at the Highbury Barn.
It was with the most great astonishment that I read as follows:-
“‘An original comic song sung by a Ms. Shaare, in which the “Specials”
were covered with a good deal of clever ridicule, created a vast amount of
merriment.”
“In truth, M. Ponche, you English are a race inexplicable. For
what your “Specials’ met they at the Barn of Highbury? Was it not
to celebrate one grand triumph P. How then? M. Sharpes sings a
comic song which covers them with ridicule. And this creates “a vast
amount of merriment.’ I cannot comprehend that. Ought it not rather
to have excited the most live indignation? What! when you con:
ceive yourselves covered with glory, you allow yourselves to be cover
with ridicule. I could well imagine M. SHARPEs to have sung your
anthem national, or your Rule Britannia. There would therein have
been something grand-sublime. But in place of that, he sings a comic
song at the expense of his company, and they are charmed of it...For
me, I should have shouted, “M. Sharpes to the lamp-post l'. Think
Leron-e-Tac-Truck-or-tº-bottle.
WE do not know what MR. GEORGE CRUIkshank would be likely
to say to MR. Houpin’s “Bottle.” The former inculcates temperance
in a pictorial poem that is the best sermon we ever read; the latter
makes drinking so pleasant, that we wonder no teetotaller has yet
risen and protested against the danger of putting such a "Bottle”
into the hands of the public. Why, it is inexhaustible! The more
liquids he pours from it, the more there are concealed at the bottom. It
is a bottled ocean of champagne, port, claret, and Curaçoa. It is
the whole London Docks, apparently, corked down in a quart bottle-
you that our National Guards, or our Mobiles, would have suffered a
Sharpes to mock himself of them in this manner: Ah! no: they
would soon have made repent M. SHARPes. But you English, you seem
to take delight in laughing at all enthusiasm and all glory.

AMong the recent applications for relief under the Poor-Law was
one made by a man on behalf of himself, his wife, and a donkey. A
question arose as to whether the donkey was a fit subject for out-door
relief, and whether he ought not to be made to bear his own burden.
After considerable difficulty, and a stringent, application of the be-
labouring test, the brute was declared irremovable.

QUEER QUADRILLES.
AN anything be more ridiculous than
getting up quadrilles with all
sorts of fantastic names, with-
out any particular º
to the subject of their title?
Such a fashion has lately grown
up; however, amongst the nº:
bility. At the Spitalfields Ball
there were the “House of
York” and “House of Lan-
caster Quadrilles,” but there
might as well have been the
House of Waterloo, consisting
of elegant young couples of
ladies and gents from HALLING,
PEARCE, and, Stone's; or the
House of Coburg Quadrille,
supported by the messieurs et
dames de comptoir from that
well-known establishment. The
Quadrille of the Kings, and
Queens of England might have
appropriately included our old
friend Edgar the Saxon mon-
arch, from Regent Circus, hay-
ing for his partner the fair
i. as she was familiarly called—the long-necked and beauteous Maude, of well-known
ovellness.
The Red and White Rose Quadrille was intelligible enough: but the Lace, Quadrille must
have been something very remarkable. We cannot conceive an un-lace quadrille;, but perhaps
the description had reference rather to the material of the dresses than to the mode of wearing
them. The Book-muslin Bolero would have had a pretty effect, and the Flounced Fandango
would have been no doubt delicious for its breadth and boldness. If there was a quadrille of
lace, why should there not have been a quiet little Reel of cotton, or an entire Ball of worsted?
We hope to see these novelties introduced at an early period.

EveRY addition, however humble, to our naval
resources, must be of considerable interest at the
present time, when “the stormy winds (of
politics) do blow, do blow, do blow,” like a
regular, or irregular hurricane. Every English-
man must feel anxious to prevent the bellows of
foreign rebellion from blowing up a domestic
breeze, and consequently the slightest augmenta
tion of our marine force is an affair on which to
congratulate our countrymen. With these views
of patriotism swelling in our bosom and trying
the strength of the buttons of our waistcoat, we
may be supposed to have gone with intense
emotion to witness the launch of a new coal-
barge at Hungerford. The craft was one of the
tautest we were ever taught to look upon, and
her º: (of coals) amounted to exactly
twenty. She had been built for the Wallsend
service, and her figure-head, which consisted of
a correct portrait of FAME (after Jones) blowing
a trumpet (after HARPER), was a work of art
that would have done credit to any carving-knife.
The launch was arranged to take place of
Hungerford, and when we arrived at the spot we
“found Youth at the helm, with Pleasure at the
prow,” to say nothing of Middle-age at the oars,
and Obstinacy at themarlin-spike, both º:
desperate endeavour to “shove off,” though the
effort was quite ineffectual. At length, at a
º º the jolly craft was uniaced from
er stays, and, slippin -
glided into the mud with a splash that shed its
influence over all the bystanders. At this
moment the scene was most exciting, for there
was scarcely a dry eye, or a dry foot, or a dry
coat, or a # bonnet among the whole of the
surrounding company.
The name was to be given to the t
vessel by Miss MATILDA Johnson Jones,
who broke a bottle of ginger-beer against the
row, and christened the craft the Tidy 'Tilda.
The cheers of the spectators at this moment
were absolutely deafening, and when the crew
struck up Rule Britannia, the Captain singing
God Save the Queen, and an adjacent organ-boy
playing Marble Halls, the struggle of alternate
emotions was too much for anybody, but particu-
larly for apoliceman, who happened to be present,
and whose stentorian “Move onl" rose high
above the din, like the voice of Æolus soaring
º a concert of halfpenny whistles in athunder-
storm.
The Tidy'Tilda being now firmly embedded in
the mud, a cold collation was served up to the
company on board, who partook of shrimps and
the other delicacies of the neighbourhood.
Dancing then commenced on the gunwale, and
was kept up till a late hour—the amusements
of the day being varied by naval hornpipes,
allusions, to “dear eyes,” “swabs,” and “land-
lubbers,” with the other customary peculiarities
of the nautical character.
In the course of the afternoon the compan
retired, º very much dissatisfied wit
the proceedings of the day. A vote of censure
was passed upon the Jack-in-the-Water, and
º to with a volley of stones by that indi-
vidual. A few speeches were made, but it was
impossible to catch their tenor, as the speakers
all spoke at the same time; and on Qur reporter
attempting to take notes, he was ducked with
vehement rapidity.

THE MODEL MOTHER-IN-LAW.
SH: is a tender creature, and requires
tº the nicest care and the hottest
luncheons to keep her in good tem-
per. She has only one child, a
daughter, , but she is
gº fond of her.
he “only lives to see
her dear child happy”
—and, everybody else
miserable. To insure
this, it is necessary to
be constantly with her.
Accordingly, she “brings
her things” some day
before dinner, and takes
session of the best
edroom, only to stop
for a week. Her weeks,
however, never have a
Saturday. She has no
knowledge of time, as
measured by the week,
month, or year, but is
sadly putout if supper is
not brought up precisely
to the minute. But JULIA always required a mother's care. She was
very delicate, even as a child, and the little thing is far from, strong
now. She has never left her side for two days together since the hour
she was born. Her daughter/must not walk—“Do you hear me, JULIAf
I will not allow it: the exertion is too much for you, and cabs are cheap
enough, goodness knows! You must not exert yourself, child; so give
me the keys, and I’ll attend to the housekeeping for you.” .
The shopping is attended to from the same generous motive. The
tradesmen soon look up to the Mother-in-Law as the mistress of the
house, and it is not long before the servants are made to acknow-
ledge her sway, and come to her regularly for orders. The husband, is
nobody—a creature to give money as it is wanted, and to, hold, his
tongue. If he ventures to º he is “killing” her daughter;
and as a mother, she is not goingito allow the murder of her darling
child before her own eyes and not tell him what she thinks about it!
He is reminded every day that “he little knows the treasure he pos-
sesses in that dear creature;” and if he hints anything about the
creature costing him rather dear for a “treasure,” he is asked if he calls
himself a man? If poor JULIA has a headache, the husband is blamed
for it. “It is all his doing; he knows it is.
to her at breakfast?” If the dinner is badly cooked, he must not say a
word, for the tearsimmediately flow, and the mother quickly upbraids him
“as a wretch who ought to be ashamed of himself for speaking in that
way to a suffering woman.” If he refuses to ; on the continent, “his
motive is very clear; butlet the crime be upon his own head!...She would
not have his feelings afterwards for a thousand pounds !”. If he
bles about any extravagant outlay, she is not going to allow her
laughter to starve for the consideration of a penny...She tells him he
is killing her, and if the new curtains are not instantly put up in the
drawing-room, she will not answer for the consequences! She should
like very much to know what he calls himself?
The MoDELMoTHER-IN-LAw in her kindest mood is fearful, but she is
most despotic when there has been a settlement made upon her daughter.
The domestic tyrant then rules with the iron rolling-pin of a female
NERO. All the little attempts of the poor husband to maintain his
rights are loudly anathematised as “base machinations to secure her
poor daughter's property. He wishes to drive JULIA mad, but she
sees through his mean devices!” Letters too are rifled for secrets—
fº ransacked for billet-dour, old servants dismissed, new ones
ed, the dinner hour altered, the luncheon kept on the table all day,
and the children brought home from school, just as MRs. SPITFIRE
pleases. . The house is quite a family Bastile. No one dares move out
or come in without her permission. The latch-key is surrendered, and
the husband is quite under the Mother-in-Law's surveillance, and is
only let out upon parole. , Woe to him if he returns home a minute
late | He is asked through the keyhole “if he’s not ashamed of him-
self?” and before he has wiped his feet on the door-mat, he is tºli,
loud enough for all the servants to hear it, that “Julia is determined
not to endure his abominable profligacy any longer, the poor thing is
sinking fast into a premature grave, and she is resolved, upon having'a
separate establishment.” The next morning the Mother-in-Law and
her daughter leave with a hundred band-boxes, and the husband is left
alone without as much as the key of the tea-caddy to console himself
Didn't he speak harshly
hydraulic scene, made more terrible by the threat that “she will
never leave him till she has brought him to a sense of the injuries he
has inflicted upon that sainted creature,” he is obliged to capitulate:
he falls upon his knees before his wife, and begs to be forgiven. The
Mother-in-Law stands by, like a stern NEMESIs of the sex, and will not
allow the poor culprit to rise before he has confessed over and over
again how deeply he was in the wrong, and “what an infamous wretch
he must have been ever to doubt such angelic goodness!”
3. The husband's children belong, º s ing, to the MoDEL
MoTHER-IN-LAw. She superintends, their education, dresses them,
whips them, physics them, and does whatever she pleases with them.
She begs “he’ll not interfere in matters he cannot possibly under-
stand.” It is at the advent of a new baby, however, that her tyrannic
power is the most absolute; the whole household then, from kitchen to
garret, is under her thumb, and, the centre of a large circle of
GoDFREYs, GAMPs, PRIgs, and DALBY's, she administers elixirs and
commands alternately, which no one dares disobey. The doctor even
succumbs to her; and as for the poor husband, he sinks to the smallest
possible point of virile insignificance. He rings the bell, no one answers
it; he wanders about a miserable PETER SCHLFMHIL in his own house,
a Husband who has lost even the shadow of authority. He asks for his
dinner, not a soul knows ºf about it. A bed is fitted up for him
somewhere in a lumber-room at the º: the house. He asks to see
his wife, but is met by the Mother-in-Law at the door, and questioned
iſ º the man really wishes to kill his innocent babe and wife?” He is
‘the man.”
The MoDELMoTHER-IN-Law is essentiallya" *†. woman.”
She is always telling people. “a bit of her mind.” The husband gets a
bit every day. All his relations, too, who dare “to put their noses into
what does not concern them,” are favoured with “a bit”--a good
bit—also. Her “mind,” like the bell of St. Sepulchre, is never told,
: lt º the prelude to some dreadful execution. She dearly loves a
Quiet Iamlly.
.The MoDEL MothHR-IN-Law makes a principle of residing with her
victims. When once in a house, she is as difficult to get out as the dry;
rot, and if allowed her own way, soon undermines everything, and
brings the house “in no time” about everybody's ears. She goes out
of town with them every year. She should never forgive herself if
anything happened, when she was * and she was not near her
dearest JULIA to aid and comfort her., he husband's comfort is never
considered. If he does succeed in driving her out of his house, his
torments are by no means at an end, for the chances are that she takes
a ºf in the same street, and lives just opposite to him. Then she
|amuses herself by running backwards and forwards all day, dropping in
| to dinner or luncheon about six times a week, or else watching every-
thing that takes place in his house from over the window blinds of her
“first pair front.” His only escape, then, is in establishing a Society
for the Promotion of Emigration from England of all homeless Mothers-
in-Law who have only one daughter. If this should be fruitless, his
only hope is in procuring a Law to annul all marriages where the
husband can prove that he has married “a treasure of a daughter”
who has a “jewel of a mother.” If this remedy even should fail, he
had better take a couple of Life Pills, for there is “no rest but the
grave” for the husband who groans under a MoDEL MoTHER-IN-LAW.

PERSONS WHO WANT NO REFORM.
URELY it is easy
enough to see that
there is a very large
class who are not at
all eagerfor Reform.
Amongst themum-
ber there are those
who hold nomination
boroughs. Is it not
very natural that a
family which has en-
joyed for generations
the privilege of send-
ing two Members to
Parliament, should
grumble at the pros-
pect of its being
taken away from
them, and cry out,
“We do not want
any Reform?”
The sinecurists
are far from partial
to the notion of Re-
perfectly content with things as they are. They
Downing St.
form. They are
don't want Reform! -
The over-paid government officers, also, are not very anxious for
Reform. A gentleman who is in yearly receipt of £500 for getting
some one else to look after a door of the House of Commons, is not
exactly the person to clap his hands with joy at the notion of its bein
taken away from him. ho can wonder at his shouting, “It’s absur
any one wanting Reſormi, I don't.” - -
The same with a Prime Minister who commands alarge majority, made
up of office-holders, and Whig Commission-brokers, and little placemen
from five thousand to five hundred a-year. He is perfectly satisfied
with the present state of things. He has everything he wants. He
has only to ask for a Bill, and he has it merely for the asking. He
wants ºn advance often thousand men, some new stables, or a good
handful of pensions, and he gets them, if he makes the request at all
in a gentlemanly manner. hat can a person with all these easy
advantages want with Reform? - -
Then there are all the persons who support the Minister, his nume-
rous lordly relations whose family pride does not prevent them accepting
f. fat appointments; and MR. DisraFL's country gentlemen, with
arge estates and numerous voters—calculated like so much timber-
upon them, and the nominees of the Peers, who all know if there were
tº be Reform to-morrow, that they would lose their only chance of
sitting in the House of Commons. These gentlemen are very useful
in swelling a majority, but what can they want with Reform? Who
can blame them, therefore, for voting against it?
The class of persons, in fact, who do not want Reform is very
numerous. It consists of some 800,000 persons, who have all they
require, and who laugh at the absurdity of a few millions wishing to
have the same “privilege”, which they possess. It would make them
none the poorer, and would make the poor man all the richer: but it
is useless talking. The wealthy want no Reform. LoRD John does
not want it; the House of Commons and the Aristocracy do not want
it; no sinecurist wants it; and this settles the question. It is pretty
clear that no one does want Reform—so where is the use of saying
another word about it?
PASSENGER-CATCHING IN THE PARKS.
THIS very pleasant amusement is much indulged in during the
summer months, by the Park-keepers. Their orders are to shut the
ſº at nine, and the fun of the game turns on this arrangement.
hey allow passengers to enter by all the gates º to the last moment.
Then as the clock strikes nine, the gates are all closed at once, and the
passengers secured. Their first rush in opposite directions is º
amusing, as are their subsequent attempts tº scale the palings, whic
besides being difficult, is forbidden by law. Thus, if they escape being
impaled, they are pretty, sure to fall into the hands of a policeman
outside, and to spend their night in the station-house. The only other
alternative is to pass their night in the open air, under a tree. Some
malicious persons, envying the Park-keepers this innocent amusement,
have proposed as a change, that instead of the gates being closed simul-
taneously, no person shall be allowed to enter them after a certain
hour, but that they shall remain open for egress till some time later
than the hour fixed for shutting them. It is obvious that with such
an arrangement no passengers would be caught, and a very º:
class of public servants would thus be deprived of a harmless an
exhilarating recreation.

MR. Qswald has for ever endeared himself to the gudewives of Ayr-
shire. Canny chiel that he is, he has made his election sure upon the
tea and the whisky-toddy of the old ladies of his constituency. For on
the Sugar Debate, MR, Oswald thus delivered himself, to the enduring
glory of the anility of Ayrshire:-
“Every old lady in Ayrshire liked a good deal of sugar in her tea and her whisky-
toddy (laughter). But not one old lady there wished to rob her grocer (hear, hear,
hear) to obtain it. If it was necessary to pay º in the pound, as satisfac-
tion, he was quite certain every one of his §. friends (much laughter) would
say, “We will take a little less sugar and rob nobody.” (cheers and laughter). It was
easy to speak of sympathy, but sympathy was of no manner of use at all unless it be
attended by some sacrifice (hear, hear). Sympathy should not be on the lip, but in
the heart (hear, hear).”
It is gratifying to know that there is at least one Member in the
House intimately connected with the feelings and consciences, and with
the yearnings towards tea and whisky-toddy of an influential section of
his constituency. We are, moreover, glad to find the declaration of
the willing self-sacrifice of old ladies so well received by the Commons:
it argues asympathy on the part of some of the Members that we hardly
looked for. MR. Oswald spokein homely, household phrase; yet, after
all, there was fine charity enshrined in his lumps of sugar. f for
instance, throughout society, folks would only consent to sacrifice a few
bits of sugar of some sort to the necessities of others, how real would
be the relief effected by the self-devotion! If sinecurists and pensioners
would only throw back some of their lumps of sugar into the state basin
—sugar, by the way, refined by the blood of over-taxed industry—the
timely sacrifice would be no less wise than prudent. We have only to
turn over the Black Book, and what asaccharine heap might be obtained
from its leaves!
We understand that the old ladies intend to commemorate the chivalry
of MR. Oswalp. He has already sat to Count D'ORsay for a statuette
in sugar—the best shilling lump-and will, in due season, adorn every
tea and toddy-table in Ayrshire.
KINGDOM FOR DISCHARGED KINGS.
We think it is a great pity that the numerous deposed monarchs
now “hanging out” ignominiously in different parts of the world
cannot be accommodated with small substitutes for their lost kingdoms
out of the various little independencies scattered over England. There
is the well known Isledom of Dogs, which would jump at any dynasty
that offered, to say nothing of that snug little cluster familiarly known
as the Eel-Pies, and hitherto torn by civil dissensions in the shape of
struggles among the waiters for precedence in changing a º: and
pocketing a sixpence. Perhaps the Isledom of Thanet would be some-
what too large and expensive for any of the ousted potentates to
undertake the management of, but the others we have named have got
a quantity of allegiance on hand, which they are dying to bestow, in
change for a sovereign, which is considerably more than the price it has
been yet able to realise.
Fellow-feeling of the French Insurgents.
We read in the Daily News—
“The insurgents who were stationed in the Jardin des Plantes have, it is said,
killed and eaten during the three days the rare birds, and destroyed the pheasantry;
even the small exotic birds have shared the same fate.”
There can be little doubt, could the insurgents have made good their
position, that they would have had a complete run of the menagerie.
After the birds—the due course of poultry—they would, doubtless,
have fallen upon the rhinoceros and elephant, as pieces, de résistance.
There is no doubt, however, that the individuals who could commit the
fantastic atrocities with which they are charged, would-from a horrid
sympathy, a fellow-feeling with the brutes—have spared both the tigers
and the monkeys.
More Monstrosities.
WE perceive by the papers that a new source of profit is opening out
for the penny-a-liners, in addition, to the tremendous gooseberries,
strapping strawberries, and colossal cauliflowers, which have hitherto
furnished the materials for profitable paragraphs. It seems that the
mushrooms have burst out into a sudden state of amplification, and an
article headed “Monster Mushrooms” has been going the round of
all the newspapers. Should these fungi become Fº enlarged,
they will supply many a meal to the gentlemen, of the press, who were
beginning to be pretty hard run, for the gooseberries were almost used
up, and the public had begun to object to being made gooseberry-fools
º any longer.

ALL work and no play makes JACK a dull boy, but all play and no
work makes him a stupid boy; and when JACK is stupid, he takes to
fighting, and the consequence is he gets into mischief. e evils of the
former system are often º: in our factories, and many of our metro-
politan establishments; but, thanks to the Early Closing Association,
these evils are diminishing every day. The evils of the other system
have been terribly proved lately at Paris. The Ateliers Nationaur
were one of the great causes of the recent Revolution. The workmen
were so accustomed to play and no work in those admirable institutions,
that when they were turned off, and had to work, and leave off playing,
the change was anything but agreeable, and they preferred" fighting.
We do not know who has drawn the great prizes of the French Revo-

THE COURT AT DRURY LANE THEATRE.
__--→HER MAJESTY. has, for some weeks past,
ºsº resolved upon encouraging English manufac-
tures. To prove that she was in earnest,
she, last week, graciously inspected a piece of
English Comedy at the Haymarket; and, by
no means discouraged, determined, on Mon-
day last, upon going to Drury Lane. The
* Queen dropt in upon the Comedy of MR.
= CHARLEs KEAN, as it were, en déshabille.
To Drury Lane, however, to the passing
confusion of the Court folks, she resolved
i to go in state. Whereupon, the crown and
sceptre were brightened up for the occasion;
# the CHANCELLOR and the SPEAKER having
their maces new burnished for the visit.
Indeed, everybody about the Court bestirred
themselves. Gold-sticks and Silver-sticks
= were in a state of alarming excitement, and
5 even the Maids-of-Honour full of bustle. The
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN, whose peculiar boast it
is, that “he never, never, goes to an English
- - theatre, and knows, nothing at all about
'em.”—his Lordship, who licenses new plays because he never reads
them—sported a new key for the solemnity. It was, however, with
eat difficulty that his Lordship found his road to the Royal box.
onder and dissatisfaction were also expressed in the Royal stables;
and more than once the Royal coachman had to pull up, and ask “the
way to Drury Lane.”
. The Theatre was, of course, brimful of fashion. May Fair was crushed
into the first tier, and Belgravia was squeezed close in the private boxes.
The play was Henry the Eighth, a piece (we give this information exclu:
sively for the Chamberlain) written by WILLIAM SHAKsPEARE of
Stratford-upon-Avon. Many of the Court seemed a little startled at
the beauty of the language. Even the Lord Chamberlain was heard
in a courtier-like whisper to say to himself—“Really, very good!” and
further, at the end of Wolsey's famous speech to Cromwell, “Upon my
life, extremely good!”. Lord John Rüssell, as a brother dramatist,
was of course very enthusiastic in his applause of the poet. All the
House of Commons occupied the pit; and it was cheering to witness
the tolerance of SIR HENRY_INGLIs towards the Popish Cardinal in
his meretricious scarlet...MR. Spooner, however, who sat between
CoLoREL SIBTHORP and MR. NewDEGATE, looked ominous throughout.
More than once, moved by the scene, and taking up the arm of MR.
N. between his thumb and finger, Mr. S. observed—“Now HER
STY can pay the least attention to a Cardinal”—for the QUEEN had
throughout evinced the profoundest interest in the actor—“there’s an
end of the Protestant, religion.” The Colonel, with a short, emphatic
* merely declared, “It was all owing to those infernal
rallways.
It is not for us to say how many times God Save the Queen was sung.
Even now, so vociferously was it given that—we doubt not—“echoes
talk along the walls.”. Even Fussell must have heard the strain
beating at the granite ribs of Newgate.
Well, the tragedy over, HER MAJESTY commanded the attendance
of MR. MACREADY. Üpon his almost instantaneous arrival, our
beloved QUEEN–to prove the high honour in which she held the
actor's art in its noblest development—smilingly bade him kneel.
MACREADy, after a modest hesitation, did, kneel. Whereupon, the
QUEEN taking a drawn sword from behind her chair of state, laid it
upon the actor's shoulder, saying in her silveriest way, “Rise, SIR }
ILLIAM MACREADy, Knight of the Fleece and the Garter, and
Commander of the Bath.”
This accumulated honour was too much for words. MR. MACREADY
retired to the sanctity of his own dressing-room, and immediately wrote
a cheque for £1000; sending it to Garter-King-at-Arms, (who luckily
happened to be with his family in the slips) as herald's fees. This
pleasing duty was scarcely ſulfilled, when the Lond CHAMBERLAIN (as
it turned out) knocked at the door of the .. Upon ºf
requested to come in, that functionary entered, bearing upon a sil
yelvet cushion the Order of the Fleece and the Bath, and the Garter
besides (all of them warm from His Royal Highness); with PRINCE
ALBERT's “compliments, that SIR WILLIAM MACREADY would do him
the honour to wear the trifles for his (H.R. H.’s) sake.”
Comment upon this is superfluous. Notwithstanding, we should be
more or less than human, did we restrain the emotion that puts this
uery—this one—Who shall dare to question the patronage of the
§n Drama by the English Court now *
We pause for—but do not expect—a reply.
MORE REPUBLICS.
THERE seems to be no end to the revolutionary mania, which
threatens even to invade the vegetable kingdom, and turn it upside
down. The potatoes have already passed through the terrible ordeal of
blighted prospects; and, so hard was the struggle they went through,
that very few came out of it without an enormous number of black
eyes. There was not a member of the potato tribe, scarcely, that did
not find itself the victim of a very bad spec-and the boldest champions
were found to be worth nothing when their jackets were thrown off.
The carrots were for a time, threatened; and, such was their pitiable
condition at one moment, that if they could have done it, they would
have, in despair, severed their own carotid arteries, which would, in
fact, have been cutting their own throats. We have lately heard that
the parsley is so sickly as to be confined to its bed, and that the peas
are so very poor that they can hardly be got to shell out. If this state
of things should continue, the vegetable kingdom will be completely
annihilated in a very short space of time.

A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMMINS’S.
N the great, momentous,
stupendous day of the
dinner, my beloved
female reader may
imagine that FITzRoy
TIMMINs was sent
about his business at
an early hour in the
morning, while the
women began to make
preparations to receive
their guests. “There
! will be no need of your
oing to FUBSBY's,”
Rs. GASHLEIGH said
to him, with a look
that drove him out of
doors. “Everything
that we require has
been ordered there /
| You will please to be
| back here at 6 o'clock
and not sooner; and I
presume you will ac-
quiesce in my arrange-
ments about the wine.”
“O yes, Mamma,”
said the prostrate son-
in-law.
“In so large aparty
—a party beyond some folks' means—expensive wines are absurd. The
light Sherry at 26s, the Champagne at 42s. ; and you are not to go
beyond 36s. for the Claret and Port after dinner. Mind, coffee will i.
served; and you come up stairs after two rounds of the Claret.”
“Of course, of course,” acquiesced the wretch : and hurried out of
the house to his Chambers, and to discharge the commissions with
which the womankind had intrusted him.
As for MRs. GAshLEIGH, #. might have heard her bawling over the
house the whole day long. That admirable woman was everywhere; in
the kitchen, until the arrival of TRUNCHEoN, before whom she would
not retreat without a battle; on the stairs; in FITzRoy's dressing-
room; and in FITzRoy minor's nursery, to whom she gave a dose of
her own composition, while the nurse was sent out on a pretext to
make purchases of garnish for the dishes to be served for the Little
Dinner. Garnish for the dishes! As if the folks at FUBSBy’s could not
5. dishes better than GASHLEIGH, with her stupid old-world
evices of laurel leaves, parsley, and cut turnips!...Why, there was not
a dish served that day that was not covered over with skewers, on which
troufles, crayfish, mushrooms, and forced-meat were impaled. When
old GASHLEIGH went down with her barbarian bunches of holly and
greens to stick about the meats, even the cook saw their incongruity,
and, at TRUNCHEON's orders, flung, the whole shrubbery into the dust-
º: * while poking about the premises, you may be sure MRs.
. Saw it.
Every candle which was to be burned that night (including the tallow
candle, which she said was a good-enough bed-light for FitzRoy) she
stuck into the candlesticks with her own hands, giving her own high-
shouldered plated candlesticks of the year 1798 the place of honour.
She upset all poor Rosa's floral arrangements, turning the nosegays
from one vase into the other without any pity, and was never tired of
beating, and pushing, and patting, and wapping the curtain and sofa
draperies into shape in the little drawing-room.
In Fitz's own apartments she revelled with peculiar pleasure. It
has been described how she had sacked his Study and pushed away his
papers, some of which, including three cigars, and the commencement
of an article for the Law Magazine, “Lives of the Sheriff's Officers,”
he has never been able to find to this day. Mamma now went into the
little room in the back regions, which is Fitz's dressing-room, (and
§ jºined to be a cloak-room,) and here she rummaged to her heart's
elight.
In an incredibly short space of time she examined all his outlying
pockets, drawers, and letters; she inspected his socks and handker.
chiefs in the top drawers; and on the dressing-table, his razors, shaving-
strop, and hair-oil. She carried off his silver-topped scent-bottle out
of his dressing-case, and a half-dozen of his favourite pills (which Fitz
possesses in common with every well-regulated man), and probably
administered them to her own family. His boots, glossy pumps, and
slippers, she pushed into the shower-bath, where the poor fellow
stepped into them the next morning, in the midst of a pool in which
they were lying. The baby was found sucking his boot-hooks the next
day in the nursery; and as for the bottle of varnish for his shoes, (which
he generally paints upon the trees himself, having a pretty taste in
| |
|

that way) it could never be found to the present hour; but it was
remarked that the young MASTER GASHIEIGHs, when they came home
for the holidays, always wore lacquered highlows; and the reader may
draw his conclusions from that fact.
In the course of the day all the servants gave MRs.TIMMINs warning.
The cook said she coodn't abear it no longer, aving Mrs. G. always
about her kitching, with her fingers in all the saucepans. Mrs. G. had
got her the place, but she preferred one as Mrs. G. didn't get for her.
The nurse said she was come to muss MASTER FITzRoy, and knew her
duty; his grandmamma wasn’t his muss, and was always aggrawating
her.—Missus must shoot herself elsewhere.
The housemaid gave utterance to the same sentiments in language
more violent. - -
Little BUTTONs bounced up to his mistress, said he was butler of the
º Mrs. G. was always poking about his pantry, and dam if he'd
stand it.
At every moment Rosa grew more and more bewildered. The baby
howled a great deal during the day. His large china Christening-bowl
was cracked by MRs. GAshLEIGH altering the flowers in it, and pre-
tending to be very cool, whilst her hands shook with rage.
“Pray go on, Mamma,” Rosa said with tears in her eyes. “Should you
like to break the chandelier?”
“Ungrateful, unnatural child!” bellowed the other;. “only that I
know you couldn't do without me, I’d leave the house this minute.”..
“As you wish,” said Rosa; but MRs. G. didn't wish; and in this
juncture TRUNCHEoN arrived. -
That officer surveyed the dining-room, laid the cloth there with ad-
mirable precision and neatness; ranged the plate on the sideboard with
graceful accuracy, but objected to that old thing in the centre, as he
called MRs. GAshLEIGH’s silver basket, as cumbrous and useless for the
table, where they would want all the room they could get.
Order was not restored to the house, nor, indeed, any decent progress
made, until this great man came: but where there was a revolt before,
and a general disposition to strike work and to yell out defiance against
MRs. GASHLEIGH, who was sitting bewildered and furious in the
drawing-room—where there was before commotion, at the appearance
of the master-spirit, all was peace and unanimity:...the cook went back
to her pans, the housemaid busied herself with the china and glass
cleaning some articles and breaking others, BUTTONs, sprang up and
down the stairs, obedient to the orders of his chief, and all things went
well and in their season.
At six, the man with the wine came from BINNEY AND LATHAM's.
At a quarter-past six, TIMMINs himself arrived. -
At half-past six, he might have been heard shouting out for his
varnished jº: we know where those had been hidden—and for
his dressing things; but MRs. GASHLEIGH had put them away. -
As in his vain inquiries for these articles he stood shouting,
“Nurse! BUTTONs 1, Rosa, my dear!” and the most fearful execrations
up and down the stairs, MR. TRUNCHEoN came out on him. -
“Igscuse me, Sir,” says he, “but it’s impawsable. We can’t dine
twenty at that table—not if you set ’em out awinder, we can't.”
“What’s to be done?” asked FITzRoy, in an agony; “they’ve all
said they’d come.” -
“Can't do it,” said the other; “with two top and bottom-and your
table is as narrow as a bench—we can't hold more than heighteen,
and then each person's helbows will be into his neighbour's cheer.”
“Rosal MRs. GashLEIGH!” cried out TIMMINs, “come down and
speak to this gentl— this-”
“TRUNCHEoN, Sir,” said the man. ~ -
The women descended from the drawing-room. “Look and see,
ladies,” he said, inducting them into the dining-room; “there's the
room, thºre ’s the table laid for heighteen, and I defy you to squeege
In more. -
al 4. º person in a party always fails,” said MRs. GASHLEIGH, getting
armed.
“That’s nineteen,” MR. TRUNCHEoN remarked;” we must knock
another hoff, mam;” and he looked her hard in the face.
Mrs. GAshleigh was very red and nervous, and paced, or rather
squeezed round the table (it was as much as she could do)—ſhe chairs
could not be put any closer than they were. It was impossible, unless
i. ‘. sat as a centre-piece in the middle, to put another guest at
that table.
“Look at that lady movin round, Sir. You see now...the diffickly;
if my men wasn’t thinner, they couldn't hoperate at all,” MR. TRUN-
cHEoN observed, who seemed to have a spite to MRs. GASHLEIGH.
“What is to be done?” she said, with purple accents.
“My dearest mamma,” Rosa cried out, “you must stop at home-
how sorry I am! And she shot one #. at FitzRoy, who shot
another at the great TRUNCheon, who held down his eyes. “We could
manage with heighteen,” he said, mildly.
MRs. GAshLEIGH gave a hideous laugh.

cloth, and blue and white ribbons—their footmen drove the house down
with the knocking. - - -
Then followed the ponderous and snuff-coloured vehicle, with faded
gilded wheels and brass Earl's coronets all over it, the conveyance of
the House of BUNGAY. The Countess of BUNGAY and daughter
stepped out of the carriage. The fourteenth EARL of BUNGAY couldn't administered in open Court.” The verdant gentleman proceeds to narrate
come.
SIR. Thomas and LADY GULPIN’s fly made its appearance, from which
issued the General with his star, and LADY GULPIN in yellow satin.
The Rowdy's Brougham followed next; after which MRs. BUTT's
handsome equipage drove up.
The two friends of the house, young gentlemen from the Temple,
lºved in cab No. 9996. We tossed up, in fact, which should pay
the fare.
MR. RANVILLE RANVILLE walked, and was dusting his boots as the
Templars drove up. LoRD CAstleNoddy came out of a twopenny
omnibus. Fun NYMAN, the wag, came last, whirling up rapidly in a
Hansom, just as MRs. GAshLEIGH, with rage in her heart, was counting
that two people had failed, and that there were only seventeen after all.
MR. TRUNchEoN passed our names to MR. Billiter, who bawled
them ort on the stairs. Rosa was smiling in a pink dress, and looking
as fresh as an angel, and received her company with that grace which
has always characterised her.
The moment of THE DINNER arrived, old LADY BUNGAY scuffled off on
the arm of FitzRoy, while the rear was brought up by Rosa and Lord
| CASTLEMOULDy, of Ballyshanvanvoght Castle, Co. Tipperary. Some
fellows who had the luck, took down ladies to dinner. I was not sorry
to be out of the way of MRs. Rowdy, with her dandy fied airs, or of that
high and mighty County Princess, MRs. Top HAM SAwYER.
A CRY FROM A BLUE-COAT BOY.
- EAR MR. PUNCH,--THough
- I am only a little boy, I am
sure you will hear what I
| have to say; for do you
know I am very miserable,
- and don’t know what to do?
I’m sure I’m ready to cry
whenever I hear the little
blackguards whisper as I go
along, “D'ye twig, the Blue-
coat Boy? It's only a charity
school, crikey! of a betterer
kind.” . Now, it isn't any-
thing of the sort. It is true
that the school was origi-
nally founded for poor
children; but that’s quite
altered now. My father
keeps his carriage, ... and
many of the young fellows
are the sons of noblemen,
and we are, all gentlemen, excepting the masters, – I know... we
are. There’s nothing of the charity school about us. I believe
it was so once, but that’s long ago, and I wish you'd tell people
that our. school is quite different from what it was at first ; and
I’m positive that, every one of our fathers pays the Income Tax,
and goes to the Opera as often as he likes, and thinks nothing of
a hundred or two. # the blackguards knew this, they would not call
us charity boys, for they would see we are gentlemen's sons, and no
mistake about it. The place has been improved very much since when
it was built by KING Edward, and there isn't now a vulgar boy
in the place, that there isn't ; and I wish you would mention this, and
then we should not be mixed up with charity boys and that sort of
thing, as iſ we belonged to an Institution that was open to any poor
man's child that chose to come and be educated. I’m sure my father
had a precious deal of trouble to get me in, and I don't like to be
called charity boy when I have three shillings a week pocket money;
and my uncle, SIR JAMEs, always tips me a sovereign when he comes
to see me, and I have a Welsh pony at home. But the bell is ringing,
so I must run, or else I shall catch it.
“I am, my dear Mr. Punch,
“Your humble servant—but no tellings,
“A BLUE-coAT Boy.”
“Oh! I forgot: there is the son of a washerwoman—his father was a
tallow-chandler in the City—but none of us speak to him. Not a word of
this to any one. I want you to support the school a bit, by just telling the
truth. I should cut precious quick—and all the boys would too—if we
thought it was a charity school; but I’m sure it isn't—is it, now?”
THEATRE ROYAL, OLD BAILEY.
An innocent correspondent of the Daily News naively writes:—“I
always thought it was one of our national boasts, that Justice was
that, on presenting himself, at the Old Bailey, to witness one of the
Charlist trials, he was told the only means of getting the Court opened
to him was by the use of a silver key, with a lubrication of palm oil.
At the entrance to the gallery,” he adds, “a fee of two shillings was
demanded for permission to enter.”—
“Is this exclusiºn of the public sanctioned by legal authority, or is it merely the
result of unchecked official impertinence and cupidity ? The gallery door-keeper,
on my demurring to the required payment, told me that “SERJEANT WILKINs was
addressing the Jury.’ Truly, the learned Serjeant must feel gratified by this tribute
to his eloquence.”
With such attractive performers as MR. SERJEANT WILKINs, there
are hopes for the truly British Drama, in spite of the foreigners; and
although Punch is no advocate for crushing private enterprise by public
monopoly, yet he does not see why the second-hand horrors of
the Surrey and Victoria should not be superseded by the real-life
terrors of the Old Bailey. The performers, both in the Dock and on
the Bench, are extremely costly to the country; and as the principle of
paying to enter Courts of Justice is, it appears, fully re ised, it
should either be abandoned altogether, or thoroughly carried out. If
followed up with skill and energy, a profit might be realised sufficient
to pay the cost of criminal prosecutions, especially if the working of
this plan were intrusted to the parent of public economy, MR. HuME.
Meantime, we would modestly suggest that a programme of each day's
performance should be ºf as at the other theatres; something
after this fashion:—

LOOKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. DYING FOR A MEDAL.
He Charinari accuses|...THE Peninsular war veterans, are, asked to exercise their patience a
W-
the Illustrated News
of being the real
author of the laſe
insurrection at Paris.
Our Parisian contem-
porary supports his
charge on these
absurd facts:–The
fighting at the Porte
/ St. Denis was no
| sooner over than
there appeared in
Paris copies of the
News, containing
most beautiful pic-
tures of the barricade
in question. “Now
it is very evident,”
savs the good-natured
Charipari,"that these
beautiful pictures
must have been
drawn and engraved
several days in ad-
vance, and that the
Editor, no doubt,
drew up the barricade in question upon the exact plan of his drawings,
in order to supply the newspaper market of England with the very
earliest intelligence.”
We must say, in defence of the Illustrated News, that this plan of
anticipating events, if it does adopt it, is only perfectly fair. Any one
might have foreseen for weeks previous that there would shortly be
another Revolution in Paris. It required no great prophet to guess
such a very common event as that. Accordingly, orders were doubt-
lessly given to the artists to get up a great Revolution immediately,
with plenty of barricades in it, so that at the slightest disturbance they
might be inserted as wanted. The only thing that would be required
to perfect the cuts would be the titles, and these could be supplied at a
moment's notice by any printer. It would be only necessary to write
under them “Tremendous Conflict at the Porte St. Denis' " or “Fearful
Slaughter at the Barrière de l'Eoile!” and who would be any the wiser
when one half of the engraving is filled with smoke, and the other half
with paying-stones?, The system, we contend, is perfectly fair, and we
* if an illustrated paper could exist without resorting pretty often
O it.
We should not at all wonder if our spirited contemporary has not
already on hand half-a-dozen more Revolutions, so as to meet the pres-
sure of the times. If persons will have pictures, they must not be
particular as to the accuracy of the facts. Illustrations were never
meant for history. Who ever expects a “Winner of the Derby’’ to be
a correct likeness? or . -
believes, an “Alarm-
ing Conflagration” to
be a view of any-
thing but the fire-
engines and the
flames? or imagines
that a “ Gran
Battle,” or the
“Awful explosion of
a Powder Mill,” was
ever sketched by an
artist on the spot?
And yet these things
are indispensable to
the success of pictorial newspapers, and they would lose half their
charm in our eyes, if we looked at a Number without finding some-
thing of the sort in it. . We maintain that the Illustrated News has
shown its usual acumen in this instance; and the fact of there having
been a barricade at the Porte St. Denis, only proves that it seldom
errs, when it trusts to those high powers of embellishment which have
raised it to the proud success it enjoys as the richest illustrated paper
of º period. May the same imagination always guide its clever

OMNIBUSOLOGY.
It is a very singular, but nevertheless an indisputable fact, which
any person in a great hurry can vouch for, that since the Omnibus fares
have consisted of “odd coppers,” no Omnibus Conductor ever has
the smallest changel
little longer before they receive their long-promised medals. Only another
five years more, or at the utmost ten, and they will be ready; for has
not EARL GREY informed us that “the dies are finished, but that at the
same time the necessary engraving will cause some further delay?”
By the time, these dilatory medals are awarded, they will be valuable
as coins, and future antiquarians will compete for #. possession of
one, as eagerly as they do for a QUEEN ANNE's Farthing. As for the
poor veterans, they have, in the altered words of one, whom it is the
fashion of these fast days to call “slow,”
“—set their glory on a cast,
And they must wait the hazard of the die.”
However, whatever difficulty there may be on the side of the Govern-
ment, there is certainly none on the part of the veterans in “making a
die,” as the Military Obituary will abundantly prove if examined. Can
The Duke, who has the interest of the soldier so much at heart, possibly
know that the brave fellows are literally dying for their medals? Per-
haps, after all, we may be wrong; for nothing can be more likely than
that the issue of the medals has been postponed altogether “sine die?”
CURIOUS DISCOVERY.
Ast Saturday week a joke was dug up out of the
columns of the Morning Chronicle. Such a thing
was never known before, in the recollection of the
oldest printer's devil. The joke is considered a
very perfect specimen of the reign of CHARLEs
THE FIRST, if not of an earlier date. Its age,
in fact, has been a matter of great dispute
amongst our oldest antiquarians of jokes. §.
PLANCHE has given it as his opinion that the
joke must be at least three hundred years old.
It is undoubtedly a unique specimen of the rich
italicised school, which was brought over from
Hanover by one of the celebrated MUFFs attached
to the suite of GeoRGE THE FIRST. It is perhaps
a little the worse for wear, but still is easily recognised by those who
are at all versed in the science of jocular numismatics.
MR. WIDDIcomb has inspected it, and turned it over in his mind at
least seven times. He tried it in every way, and at last put it to the
severest test to which a joke can be applied—that of the ring. This at
once decided its antiquity. He recollects vividly hearing the great
TARLEton repeat it, and QUEEN BEsslaughing at it. . He was then in
the Hoop, a travelling circus to which old BEN had given a number of
lively conundrums, which he had taken out of Every Man in his Humour.
It was at that period called “a ryghte merrie jeste.” -
It is still a profound mystery how the joke could have found its way into
the office of the Morning Chronicle. It is supposed that many more of the
same distant da'e may be on the premises, and will some day turn
up. We look forward to this hope, with anticipatory feelings of venera-
tion. Our old jokes are plentiful enough, but it is extremely difficult to
meet with one in such a fine state of preservation as the aged specimen in
question. By the way, the Editor of the Morning Herald has offered any
sum for it: ſº wants it to complete a museum of fossils and epigrams,
which he preserves in his studio. . The Editor of the Morning Chronicle,
however, has refused to part with it, and we cannot blame him for it. He
has had it put under a glass-case, and out of memory to its origin, it is
preserved in the original sawdust, which is supposed to have been made
from some of the classic boards which TARLEros trod in his day, and
which has been an heir-loom in W1DDIcomb's family for centuries.
For the benefit of the curious, we subjoin a copy of this venerable

THE AUSTRIAN AUTOMATON.
IT is a great pity that the EMPEROR FERDINAND cannot discover the
famous Automaton purchased by his ancestor in 1759. The thing
would do admirably for an Emperor, and would have the advantage of
great cheapness—not always an imperial quality. However, as few of
our readers have, doubtless, heard of this wonderful machine of the last
century, we give an account of it, having stumbled over the document in
the Annual Register. “A certain artist at Wienna,” says the annalist,
“has constructed an Automaton dressed in the habit of an Austrian
entleman, with a pen, in one hand and a standish in the other: after
ipping the former in the latter, he strikes upon a sheet of paper, marked
with a kind of spiral line, and in the space between appears the following
inscription : Augusta domini Austriacae et imperatori Deus nec metas nec
finem ponit; that is, that God has not set either bounds or periods to
the august House of Austria, or to the Emperor. His Imperial Majesty
has bought the piece, and settled a considerable pension on the
inventor.”
Now, there can be but little doubt that such a valuable piece still
exists, . We would answer for it, that if search were made for the
“Austrian gentleman with a pen in one hand and a standish in the
other,” he would be found—no doubt a littly rusty in his springs
-in, some corner of some old museum; in some nook devoted
to the gimcrackery of the olden time. Indeed, Austria itself
may have altogether forgotten the wonder. It was the º of
Cicero, a stranger, to discover the tomb of Archimedes to the t
eometrician's countrymen; in like manner, it may be one of the
innumerable services of Punch to discover to the Viennese the Automaton
Austrian, gentleman. If found, a very little, alteration in the “spiral
line” will enable him to sign royal warrants, instead of continually
writing, as before, a bit of vapid brag; and thus, the services of FERDI-

THE POETRY OF PRIZE CATTLE.
Between the agricultural and stable mind, there are some
analogies; but there are also some differences. The stable mind has
certainly the advantage of the sº in taste and fancy. There
is something pretty and playful in the nomenclature of race-horses,
which we do not recognise in that of prize pigs and cattle. We should
have perused the list of the winners at the late Agricultural Show at
York, with much more pleasure, if the interesting animals had been
designated by suitable titles. “What's in a name?” it may be asked;
and it may be urged that a hog by any other name would look as plump.
True, but in a nice name there is something pleasing, even when
applied to a pig. For example, one would experience an agreeable
emotion in reading of MR. GILes's boar. “Zephyr,” or MR. Hopge's
sow, “Flora,” or “Lisette,” or “Julia,” or “Zitella,” weight so
many stone. An ox might be called “Tiny;” a fine milch cow,
“Dudu” We do not see why the graces of nomenclature should be
i. by horseflesh, and none di'i. shed upon pork, and beef,

A CUT FOR AN
A BARRICADE TAKEN ON THE SPOT BY OUR ARTIST.
|LLUSTRATED PAPER.
NOT WORTH AN OLD SONG.
ThERE was an action tried the other day
(DAVIDson v. BoHN), which is valuable for the
light it throws on the very disputable value of
that common article of comparative value, “an
old song.” MR. SERJEANT TALFouBD declared
that the words of a song were of no value apart
from the music, and that “immortal verse”
erishes outright as to any market value it may
ave, from the moment of its being wedded to
music. This is to consider the music as the
husband, and the words as the wife, whose per-
sonality is merged in that of the man in wedlock.
Composers were called who had been accus-
tomed, when disposing of the copyright of their
accompaniments, to throw in the words as of no
value, just as turnip-tops are flung in to the
purchasers of turnips. BRAHAM and Bishop
take no account of the poet. Yet there are
words, by one SHAKSPEARE, and one MooRE, and
One Henrick, and one BARRY CORN wall, and
one KEATs, and one SHELLEY, and one TENNY-
son, in this lamentable predicament, of being
coupled with flats, and minims, and crotchets—
prisoned within musical bars, and warbling
through their cage like captive nightingales. It
is the cage, however, we are now informed, and
not the bird, that is to be looked to. The sound
is not the echo of the sense, but the sense of
the sound. The music is the accompaniment of
the words, and not the words of the music. We
congratulate the champion of Copyright on his
argument and his theory.

RAILWAY PICNICS.
THE grand object of Railway Directors is to get a dividend; and the
maxim applicable to this prºcess is, “Get a dividend—honestly if you
can—but—get a dividend!”. Among the various artifices lately resorted
to for the purpose of swelling the coffers of the various Companies is
the happy idea of Railway Picnics, which are becoming exceedingly
popular. A few days ago, the Station of the Eastern Counties, at
Shoreditch, was alive with all the resources that beauty can derive from
millinery; for a party of gay and light-hearted houris, in stiff muslins of
every degree—from the
thronged the platform for the purposes of pleasure. The ample Wisite
hung upon the sloping shoulders of youthful grace, and the newly-imported
Palalla—manufactured of every material from the rich brocade to the
altry Persian or the seedy Sarsnet—gave life and vigour to the Station.
W. were at first puzzled to make out the meaning of this group,
assembled among porters, and packages, luggage and luggage-vans,
passengers and paper-venders, until upon inquiry we ascertained that
a Picnic party was going off by the railway, with sandwiches stowed
away in the stuffing-box of the engine, hot water for tea in the boiler,
hard eggs deposited in the cylinder, and some champagne, placed for
security in the safety-valve. Nothing could be more complete than all
the arrangements, and when the tender started, with Pleasure in its train,
the sight was a truly refreshing one.
The Picnic came off, we believe, at one of the largest Goods Stations
of the Eastern Counties Railway, and the eatables were set out upon
one of those revolving pieces of machinery upon which the carriages
are turned round, and which, acting as a sort of dumb-waiter, caused
the wine to circulate with the utmost facility. There was a constant
succession of hot tea from the boilers of the trains passing up and down
the line, and the festivities were kept up with great spirit till, a late
hour. One of the locomotives was kept constantly supplied with the
pure element, to act as a great moral engine for the advancement of
temperance principles among such as were inclined to follow them.
Wonderful Unanimity of the Paris Press.
“IN consequence of the violent outbreak which visited our city
yesterday, we regret that our paper could not possibly appear.”—The
Débats, Constitutionnel, National, Chariwari, Gazette, Le Neveu de

DRAMATIC DEFAMATION.
A CoRRESPONDENT, signing himself “DRAMATICus,” wrote last week
to the Times, insinuating that the malcontents in human shape at
Drury Lane, on the QUEEN’s visit, went with malice prepense to
insult MACREADY because of his advocacy of fair play in the case of the
ill-used Frenchmen. This insinuation has caused the greatest wrath
throughout, the whole profession. So, indignant are the actors in
general against the Times that—we tell this in confidence to our distin-
uished contemporary—that an émeute may in a few evenings be looked
or in Printing-House Square; the actors having purchased the wood
pavement of Piccadilly, wherewith to throw up a barricade for an attack
upon the office. However, we are further told that the demands of the
insurgents will not be extravagant, the head of “DRAMATICUs” being
all . intend to ask for. We do not see how they could very well ask
for less.
Whig Phenomenon.
*IT may be remembered º the sight-seers of London, that some five-
and-twenty years ago a little boy was exhibited, the iris, of whose eyes
was formed by the letters N. A. P. O. L. E.O. It will, we are sure,
gladden the heart of the country to learn that a little boy has been
discovered somewhere near the Land's End, in whose irides, in very
large letters, may be read R.U. S. S. E. L. L., This child, there is no
doubt, was born triumphantly to illustrate the sublime Whig truth
modestly hinted by LoRD JoHN, that Russells are to be ever appointed
by Providence as English Prime Ministers. The Divine Right of Kings
is exploded: not so the Divine Right of Whigs.

Russell is quite homoeopathic in its amount, and may be considered as

does his best, though his best is bad enough, to make everybody indiffer-
ent. He seems to have a community of feeling with the old poet, who
thus addressed the object of his solicitude :-
-- Though times are hard, to show how I adore you,
Here's my whole heart and half-a-guinea for you.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SUNDAY BILL.
He tolerant MR. HINDLEY has brought in a
Bill to restrict Sunday trading. Now
we are great advocates for Sabbath
tranquillity. A Sunday in England
may be thought to have its dullness;
but with that dullness is there not an
exceeding comfort . It is a beautiful
- pause in the moil and toil of life: and
may the day be far distant, when the
shopman and the labourer shall not
look towards one whole complete day
in the week, when—to use a com-
mercial phrase—he may quietly take
stock of his inner self. At this time
of day Punch need make no declaration
of his unqualified dissent from the
gloomy tribe of the funereal AGNEws.
Punch would not desire to have the birds dumb on the Sabbath, the
flowers closed, the rivers stagnant, and the very greenness of the
meadows covered up in a fog of whitey-brown. And, on the other
hand, very much would Punch deplore a †. that should permit even
the acknowledged heroine of Domestic Drama to embody her bright
fireside truths at the Victoria Theatre on the evening of the seventh day.
Whilst Punch would not, with SIR ANDREw, put everybodyinsackclothon
a Sunday, neither would he permit anybody to wear the motley. It is good
that men should take their seasonable pleasures on the seventh day: it is
good that they should innocently and H. enjoy the great First Day
of Rest: and the º the man's lot, the greater his right to the en-
joyment; for with him the hours of Sunday are doubly precious. Was
it not the wise all-tolerant Festion who, when acº complained that
his parishioners would dance on a Sunday, answered him with a soul of
goodness:—“These poor people work all the week, and may if they
will, without blame, dance on Sundays. But you, Mons. Cubſ, and
myself—you and I, who do not work all the week-let not us dance
on Sundays.”
We would, therefore, have Parliament legislate with scrupulous
tenderness towards the poor man, in this projected Sabbath enactment.
Many suspicious little meddlings have been already menaced. Some-
body in the debate threatened a crusade against the peripatetic sale of
oranges. Now, surely, there can be no harm in a Sabbath orange.
The men—mostly of the Hebrew tribe—who proffer the grateful fruit,
do not, with their nets, like the Evil One, fish for unwary souls. Neither
do we think a pint of shrimps sold, and picked, and eaten on Sundays,
are therefore shrimps from the Lake of B. Ginger-pop carries
with it no alarming thunder to our conscience; and we can, with no
dread of after remorse, serenely contemplate even the foaming periwig
of an overrunning pot of ale. “Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.”
Sure we are that the excellent LoRD MoRPETH is an advocate for
Sunday recreation. Qr wherefore—for we see the amenity published
in the papers—wherefore, by order of the Woods and Forests (by com-
mand of bounteous PAN) have “upwards of two hundred chairs been
Fº in Hyde Park, and a proportionate number in St. James's Park,
or the public accommodation?” Why, to the end that the people, to
whom Sabbath is double rest and double sweetness, may, at 1. ease,
contemplate the feathered pensioners of HER MAJEsty's Civil List. It
would be well, too—would certainly afford pleasanter matter for re-
flection—were all the pensioners at least as useful as the swans, and
ducks, and Solan geese, and all the variety of shovellers and waders
disporting in the stream, and unconsciously drawing forth the humanities
of little children, prodigal of cake and biscuit.
It is our stubborn faith that the black swan, the noble stranger from
the Antipodes, is a source of quite as much benefit and pleasure to HER
MAJESTY's subjects, as the Hereditary Grand Falconer; and—not that
we desire to be taken as an authority on the fact—and doubtless hardly
costs the people more money. Indeed, if the mob of ladies and gentle-
men of the Civil List could be brought into St. James's Inclosure, and
fairly confronted with their fellow Fº: in feathers, it is our belief
that every bipes implumis would feel humiliated by a sense of uselessness
conveyed in the self-comparison. Besides, the ducks and geese on the
ornamental water—the web-footed pensioners—may in due course be
stuffed with sage and onion, and so be eaten... Now, we do not believe
that even MR. HuME could ever think of putting the Grand Falconers
upon the spit.
To return to the immediate purpose of the Bill. It is just now one of
the measures always brought in at an advanced stage of the Session, to
make a show of business, and be duly withdrawn. We shall hear but
little more of it for the present year. It is said, however, that MR.
Spooner, has a few clauses—cut and very much dried-to propose, to
equalise the law, whenever the subject shall be agitated, between rich
and poor. We give a few of the enactments:-
“That no lady or gentleman soever (bishops inclusive) shall ride to
church on Sundays: That no footman shall be employed to carry a
prº-book for master or mistress: , . -
“That if the sale of oranges be forbidden in the streets, the delivery
of pine-apples shall be forbidden at private houses:
“That if shrimps are not to be sold, under a penalty, at Bagnigge
Wells, neither shall lobsters be supplied at the Athenæum, the Reform,
and other Clubs: -
“That if bake-houses are closed on the Sunday, every family keeping
º cook on the Saturday, that they may dine cold on the
“Sabbath.
THE IRISH TUTOR FOR LADIES.
We have somewhere heard or read of a Club, rejoicing in the appella-
tion of the “Devil's Qwn.”. Such, a title, we should, think, would be
highly appropriate to the Society alluded to in the subjoined paragraph,
by the Cork Constitution :-
“At a meeting of one of the Confederate Clubs, held on Thursday evening in this
city, at which a vast amount of “base, brutal, and bloody’ language was uttered,
three vociferous cheers were given for that “pattern for all Irishwomen." Madame
Le Blanc, who confessed in Paris that she had cut off the heads of four of the
Garde Mobile during the late insurrection.”
So MADAME LE BLANc is to supersede KATHLEEN O'MoRE and
Norah CREINA, as the type of Irish womanhood. KITTY of CoI.ERAINE
is to spill, not buttermilk, but blood. The Cork Confederation Club
having proposed MADAME LE BLANC as a model for their ladies, we
wonder what distinguished personage they would choose for their own.
The great Burke, we presume—we mean the friend of HARE, not of
Johnson. -
But it seems that the Irish female character, according to the Con-
federate view of its perfection, is not yet quite developed. Education
is requisite to bring out its latent virtues. “Therefore,” says our
contemporary,
“It is proposed to establish clubs for women, in which they are to be instructed
in all the arts of assassination capable of being effectively carried out by the ‘fair
daughters of Erin.”
By way of a preliminary training to actual homicide, we should re-
cº a quiet course of pig-butchery to the tender novitiates. But
we doubt if any amount of initiation would qualify them to become
priestesses of Thuggee. We suspect that no instruction in the arts of
assassination would render the “fair daughters of Erin.” more
than they are at present.

THE MODEL TAILOR.
THI* is the most confiding of human
beings. He is generous—chari-
table to a fault—for the desti-
ask for clothes, and they get
exactly what they want. He gives
them the best of everything—
velvets, silks, the finest kersey-
meres,-nothing is too good for
them. He even feels a virtuous
pleasure in the act—and is quite
angry if the person whom he has
clothed does not return to him
afterwards, and be , measured for
a new suit. Far from repuls-
ingyou, he makes you welcome,
and really feels grateful that
ou have not forgotten him
e presses you in the most tempt-
ing manner to have something
new. He has a lovely pattern
for a waistcoat—a real Cashmere—
it is just the thing for you. Will
you allow him to send you home
one? Heismiserable if . refuse,
so take the waistcoat by all means, and make the poor fellow happy.
He has, also, some beautiful stuff for trowsers—just arrived from
Paris—it would become you admirably—will you let him make you
a pair? ... Don't say No, or else his generous heart will sink, and with
it his high opinion of you. His philanthropy, in fact, is unbounded;
he does good merely for the sake of doing good. All men are his
brothers, with this exception, that he gives them all they ask, even
lends them money if they want it, and never expects the smallest
return. He is the Gentleman's Best Friend.
The MoDEL TAILOR, sometimes, it must be confessed, sends in his
bill, though, payment, generally º never enters into his
thoughts. But then he is ashamed of the liberty, and apologises most
rofusely for it. He is fully sensible that he, is doing wrong, and
§. in his soul for the shabbiness he is guilty of. It is only that
he is terribly distressed for money, or else he would not think of
“troubling” you. He is greatly subject to that heaviest of all social
calamities—a “little bill.” He asks you, as the greatest favour, to let
him have a “trifle upon account,” and leaves you happier than poets
can express, if you promise to let him have something in a day or two.
Should it be inconvenient, however, he never presses the point, and
will look in some other time. Should you express astonishment at his
demand—you cannot have had his bill more than two years—he excuses
himself in the most penitential manner, and begs your pardon for
having mentioned the subject. The next day he calls to inquire if you
want anything in his way; the generous creature forgives, as quickly as
he forgets. His anger is only roused when you leave him to go to
another tailor. He is very jealous of any one else doing a kind action,
and would like to enjoy the monopoly of all the Schneider virtues.
In his anger he has been known to send a lawyer's letter; but if you
go to him, and tell him what you think of his conduct, and order a new
wrap-rascal, he will settle the matter himself, and assure you that the
thing is purely a mistake, and that no one can possibly be more sorry for
it than he is.
THE MoDELTAILOR takes a pride in seeing his clothes on the back
of a perfect gentleman. He knows no higher gratification than when he
is “cutting out” a nobleman. His greatest enjoyment is going to the
Opera, and recognizing, from a distance, the Earls, and Marquises, and
the dashing young Barts. and Knts, all walking about in the “charm-
ing” coats he has made for them. He throws his entire soul into his busi-
mess, and places it high amongst the Fine Arts, Sculpture excepted,
which he excludes altogether, as he cannot imagine how persons
can see any beauty in APOLLó and VENUs, dressed as they are, or
. toga can be considered a suit of clothes any more than a table-
Cloth.
THE MODEL TAILoR has exquisite taste, and unlimited faith. He
praises the figure of every one of his customers, and never doubts any
one till after four years' credit. He strives his utmost to conceal the
eccentricities of a pair of parenthetical legs, and spares no cloth for
fattening every miserable lean calf that comes under his paternal shears.
He disowns fox's heads and four-in-hands, and such vagaries upon
saucer buttons, and does not encourage the style of dress invented b
the “stable mind.” He warrants to fit anything, and boasts, thoug
not much given to joking, of having made a dress-coat for a corkscrew.
He does not recommend things to wash, that are sure to leave their
complexion behind them in the first wash-tub, nor make a practice of
registering his straps, his belts, button-holes, and every little article
-
tute have only to go to him and |b
of costume. He estimates men, not by their measures but, his own,
and in his tailors' eyes he is the best man who turns out the best after
he has been well-dressed by him once or twice. He despairs of LoRD
* ever being a great man, but has great hopes of PRINCE
ERT.
The MoDEL TAILOR rarely makes a fortune, unless he has been very
unfortunate through life. An insolvency just puts him straight; a first
ankruptcy leaves him a handsome surplus, and a second one enables
him to retire. The sad truth is, that the simple child of EVE knows he
owes all his business to the fact of her biting the apple, and he has not
the heart to distress any son of ADAM for i. clothes he wears. Per-
haps he feels that it would be like pocketing the wages of sin. His
assignees, therefore, are obliged to collect his debts for him, and ac-
cordingly, the oſtener he fails, the richer he becomes. He buys, in
his old age, a large estate with a small title upon it, somewhere in
Germany, and leaves his “goose” to be cooked by somebody else,
universally regretted by all those customers who have known him since
the date of his last fiat. He dies a contented Baron. Of all tradesmen,
there is not one so estimable, so incredulous, so generous, so beloved,
when you meet with one, as the MoDELTAILOR.

DISSOLVING WIEWS.–PRIZE CATTLE SHOWS.
THE sympathy of the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE was greatly
moved by the evident distress of a prize bull at the
York Agricultural Show. The poor beast could
scarcely breathe under its accumulation of suet. The
tallow, like Parliament, was just on the eve of disso-
lution; the heat was so intense that the suffering
animal seemed to be basting itself to death with its
| own fat. It was a piteous sight, and HIs Roy AL
HighNEss could not help remarking to his chief
equerry and cook, BARON Von SPEISEKART, that
the bull was literally “dripping wet.” The joke,
such as it is, fled with all the wonderful, rapidity of a
royal joke, and formed the exclusive subject of con:
versation for hours afterwards at the Mayoralty, and
the principal black-doll shops of the ancient City of
York. If the DUKE can only make another joke like
it, or one only half as good, his reputation is achieved
as a great wit. When he speaks, persons will dig their
forefingers into his royal ribs, and exclaim reproach-
t fully, “You’re a wagſ" or else he will pass through
$ life as a “ sad dog,” and have his bon-mots collected
after his death, and sold at all the railway stations.

Mortality for the Million.
Last week, at a meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Colo-

population is incret sing at the rate of 1000 souls a day. It cannot be
said that Government is doing nothing to supply a remedy for this
monster-evil; for Government sanctions the sale of quack-medicines,
than which nothing can operate more effectually as a check to over-
population.

Glad, for the sorriest mess, to sell his heritage of lore.
The Barrister who thro’ the Courts, sore pinched and ill at ease,
Hollow of cheek and bag alike, still hopes for hopeless fees;
The College bred Physician, heart-sick, and poor, and prim,
Patient as patients waiting, that never wait on him.
And the poor Scribe, that to a film spins out his sorry brains,
As spider spins its web-but his, alas! no prey detains;
The worn Inventor, adding still new engines to the old,
Starving himself on the device shall breed for others gold.
So Mind and Matter pine alike in this eternal press,
The kindly seed of Pity choked with rank growth of distrees;
Hearts drown with all their freight of hopes, as on life's ocean rolls,
Sapping our bodies of their strength, and of their grasp our souls.
Yet earth is wide enough for all, and England holds in fee
Rich prairies—broad savannahs—o'er South or Western sea,
Where virgin soils are offering their riches to the hand
That withers for pure lack of work, in this o'er-peopled land.
Unopened mines, ports shipless, loam innocent of grain,
Gardens unpruned, wild vineyards, happy islands, happy main;
The banquet spread, the guests unfed, that jostle here and jar,
Plenty that runs, unblessed, to waste, while want here breedeth war.
Then raise the cry, till loud and high it rise from lathe and loom,
From forge and field, from hut and hall, the cry of “Elbow-room ' "
Of elbow-room for labour, of elbow-room for life, -
For mind, for means, that so may come some calm upon our strife.
That we may have some pause for thought, may find some breathing-space,
To look, not as a foeman looks, upon our neighbour's face;
That we may hold our hold on life, not like poor drowning souls
Where each that grasps the plank, to death some weaker comrade rolls.
And then how many a swimmer, now struggling with the tide,
Will find that he was grappling with sº at his side l—
What Right may grow where Wrong is now, what Concord from Debate,
What Knowledge out of Ignorance, what Loving out of Hate'
LOGIC OF DEBT AND CREDIT.
THE Morning Chronicle has a long article on the law of Debtor and
Creditor. The essay is finely conceived and logically conducted;
imparting to the trading world in general one unexpected comfort.
For instance, “at this moment,” credit is in a most wholesome condi-
tion. Hear the Chronicle—
“At this moment, not less-than nineteen shillings in the pound of everybody's
money is fructifying or evaporating, as the case may be, in the pockets of some-
body else.”
Now, as nineteen shillings in everybody's pound is one in the 1.
of somebody else, it follows that everybody must owe everybody nine-
teen shillings; and as everybody owes nineteen .."; and everybody
has nineteen shillings to receive, why everybody, in fact, owes every-
body nothing.

A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMMINS’s.
F course it does not become
the present writer, who has
partaken of the best enter-
tainment which his friends
could supply, to make fun of

as it must be confessed) hos-

season that seems no great

white-bait as you would of a
whale—yet we must always
remember that there’s ano-
ther season coming, and hold
our tongues for the present.
As for describing, then, the
mere victuals on TIMMINs's
table, that would be absurd.
- Everybody—(I mean of the
genteel world, of course, of which I make no doubt the reader is a
polite ornament)—everybody has the same everything in London. You
see the same coats, the same dinners, the same boiled fowls and mutton,
the same cutlets, fish, and cucumbers, the same lumps of Wenham
Lake ice, &c. The waiters, with white neckcloths, are as like each other
everywhere as the peas which they hand round with the ducks of the
Can't any one invent anything new P
The only difference between TIMMINs's dinner and his neighbour’s
was, that he had hired, as we have said, the greater part of the plate,
and that his cowardly conscience magnified faults and disasters of which
no one else probably took heed.
But, Rosa thought, from the supercilious air with which MRs. Top-
HAM SAwyER was eyeing the plate and other arrangements, that she
was remarking the difference of the ciphers on the forks and spoons—
(which had, in fact, been borrowed from every one of FITzRoy's friends
—I know, for instance, that he had my six, among others, and onl
returned five, along with a battered, old, black-pronged, plated abomi.
nation, which I have no doubt belongs to MRs. GAshieigh, whom I
hereby request to send back mine in exchange)—their guilty consciences,
I say, made them fancy that every one was spying out their domestic
deficiencies; whereas, it is probable that nobody present thought of
their failings at all...People never, do; they never see holes in their
neighbours' coats—they are too indolent, simple, and charitable.
Some things, however, one could not help remarking; for instance,
though Fitz is my closest friend, yet, ºf I avoid seeing and being
amused by his perplexity and his dismal efforts to be facetious? His
eye wandered all round the little room with quick uneasy glances, very
different from those frank and jovial looks with which he is accustomed
to welcome you to a leg of mutton; and Rosa, from the other end of
the table, ºover the flowers, entrée dishes, and wine-coolers, telegraphed
him with signals of corresponding alarm. Poor devils' why did they
ever go beyond that leg of mutton?
FUNNYMAN was not brilliant in conversation, scarcely opening his
mouth, except for the purposes of feasting. The fact is, our friend ToM
DAwson was at table, who knew all his stories, and in his presence the
great wag is always silent and uneasy.
Fitz has a very pretty wit of his own, and a good reputation on
Circuit; but he is timid before great people. And indeed the presence
of that awful LADY BUNGAY on his right hand, was enough to damp
him. She was in Court-mourning (for the late PRINCE or Schlippen.
schioppen). She had on a large black funereal turban and appurte-
nances, and a vast breastplate of twinkling, twiddling, black §.
No wonder a man could not be gay in talking to her.
MRs. Rowdy and Mrs. ToPHAM SAwy ER love each other as women
do who have the same receiving nights, and ask the same society;
they were only separated by RANVILLE RANVILLE, who tries to be well
with both: and they talked at each other across him.
Top HAM and Rowdy growled out a conversation about Rum,
Ireland, and the Navigation Laws, quite unfit for print. Sawyer.
§. speaks three words without mentioning the House and the
peaker.
The Irish Peer said nothing (which was a comfort); but he ate and
drank of †† which came in his way; and cut his usual absurd
figure in dyed whiskers and a yellow under-waistcoat.
GENERAL GULPIN sported his star, and looked fat and florid, but
melancholy. His wife ordered away his dinner, just like honest
SANcho's physician at Barataria. - -
Both ERBY's stories about LAMARTINE are as old as the hills, since
the barricades of last month; and he could not get in a word or cut
the slightest figure. And as for ToM DAwson, he was carrying on an
undertoned small talk with LADY BARBARA St. MARY's, so that, there
was not much conversation worth record going on within the dining-
room.
Outside, it was different. Those houses in Lilliput. Street are so
uncommonly compact, that you can hear everything which takes place
all over the tenement; and so, -
In the awful pauses of the banquet, and the hall-door being further-
more open, we had the benefit of hearing - - -
The cook, and the occasional cook, below stairs, exchanging rapid
phrases regarding the dinner; - -
The smash of the soup-tureen, and swift descent of the kitchen-
maid and soup-ladle down the stairs to the lower regions. This acci-
dent created a laugh, and rather amused FitzRoy and the company,
and caused FUNNYMAN to say, bowing to Rosa, that she was mistress
of herself, though China fall. But she did not heed him, for at that
moment another noise commenced, namely, that of - - -
The baby in the upper rooms, who commenced a series of piercing
yells, which, though stopped by the sudden clapping to of the nursery-
door, were only more dreadful to the mother when suppressed. She
would have given a guinea to go upstairs and have done with the whole
entertainment.
A thundering knock came at the door very early after the dessert,
and the poor soul took a speedy opportunity of summoning the
ladies to fººt though you may be sure it was only old MRs. GAsh-
LEIGH, who had come wiſh her daughters—of course the first person to
come. I saw her red gown whisking up the stairs, which were covered
with plates and dishes, over which she trampled. -
Instead of having any quiet after the retreat of the ladies, the house
was kept in a rattle, and the glasses jingled on the table, as the fly men
and coachmen plied the knocker, and the soirée came in. . From
my place I could see everything; the guests as they arrived (I
remarked very few carriages, mostly cabs and flies), and a little crowd
of blackguard boys and children, who were formed round the door, and
gave ironical cheers to the folks as they stepped out of their vehicles.
As for the evening party, if a crowd in the dog-days is pleasant,
oor. MRs. TIMMINs certainly had a successful, soirée, You could
ſºil, move on the stair. Mrs. STERNHoLD broke in the bannisters
and nearly fell through. There was such a noise and chatter you
could not hear the singing of the Miss GAsHLEIGHs, which was no
great loss. LADY BUNGAY could hardly get to her carriage, being
entangled with Colonel, WEDGEwood in the passage. , An absurd
attempt was made to get up a dance, of some kind, but before...MRs.
CRowper had got round the room, the hanging-lamp in the dining-
room below was stove in and fell with a crash on the table, now pre-
pared for refreshment, - -
Why, in fact, did the TIMMINSEs give that party at all? . It was quite
beyond their means. They have offended a score of their old friends,
and pleased none of their acquaintances. So angry, were many who
were not asked, that poor Rosa says she must now give a couple more
parties and take in those not previously invited. And I know for a fact
that FUBsby's bill is not yet paid; nor BINNEY and LATHAM's, the wine-
merchants; that the breakage and hire of glass and china cost, ever so
much money; that every true friend of TIMMINs has cried out against
his absurd extravagance, and that now, when every one is going out o
town, Fitz has hardly money to . his Circuit, much more to take Rosa
to a watering-place, as he wished and romised. -
As for Mrs. GAshLeigh, the only feasible plan of economy which she
can suggest is that she should come and live with her daughter and son-
in-law, and that they should keep house together. If he agrees to this,
she has a little sum at the banker's, with which she would not mind easing
his present difficulties; and the poor wretch is so utterly bewildered
and crest-fallen that it is very likely he will become her victim. -
The Topham Sawyers, when they go down into the country, will
represent Fitz as a ruined man and reckless prodigal; his uncle, the
attorney, from whom he has expectations, will most likely withdraw his
business, and adopt some other member of his family-BLANCH CROWDER
for instance, whose husband, the doctor, has had high words with poor
FitzRoy already, of course at the women's instigation—and all these
accumulated miseries fall upon the unfortunate wretch because he was
good-natured, and his wife would have a Little Dinner.
Awful Desecration.
SIR F. Buxton presents his compliments to Punch, and be

working on the Sunday at his brewery, he has found that the fault does

OH DEAR No—Do YoU P”
BESIDEs, How ABoxſDNABLY AFFECTED SHE is l’”
ALBERT THE GREAT.
PRINCE ALBERT has made another good speech....His oration at the
York Cattle-Show would have done credit to a Bishop-even to the
Bishop of Oxon. ...The Prince drew a very pretty rustic picture of
the mutual goodwill and respect of the farmer, the parson, and the
farmer's wife. He descended into the details of working-day existence
with an affability, and grace that charmed all hearers. But all this is
nothing to that which is to follow....
We understand that His Royal Highness, animated by a noble am:
bition, intends in a manner to set aside his present conventional
advantages, and to work himself up to the highest honours of the
government. It is said that PRINCE ALBERT proposes to model himself
upon PETER THE GREAT. Thus, at the next election, the Prince will
start for one of the metropolitan boroughs.--Finsbury has been named.
Depending upon the manifesto of his principles, His Royal Highness
has every reasonable expectation of a triumphant return, to the exclu-
sion of ToM DUN.com.B, who will be very much outbidden by the
liberalism of royalty. Once in the House of Commons, there is the
grandest field for the exertions of His Royal Highness. There, he will
work himself up from an Under-Secretaryship to the post of Prime
Mººr: to be subsequently raised upon his merits to the Upper
Ouse.
As the hut of PETER THE GREAT—covered and preserved—the hut
where the royal shipwright worked at the dockyard of Saardam, is still
shown to an admiring posterity,+so will the Hustings of Finsbury,
whereon the Prince shall labour for the honour of M.P., remain a
precious relic; a most interesting evidence of the patriotic labour of
ALBERT. In the hut of PETER there is, we learn, an inscription set up
by the EMPEROR ALEXANDER—“Nothing is too little for a great man.”
The same inscription, in raised letters, may be blown in the glass case
that covers the ALBERT Hat.
Of course His Royal Highness will not start upon his glorious career
under his own name. Such publicity would defeat the noble end. No:
as PETER went unknown into the dockyard, so will ALBERT, un-
known, canvas the constituency of Finsbury—or somewhere else;
for it will be seen that, with our usual astuteness, we have named
Finsbury in order to put the country on the wrong scent. When a
young Member—duly disguised for the occasion—makes an eloquent
onslaught upon the civil abuses, the lavish expenditure of the state,
upon the necessity of sympathising with an enlightened democracy—
when such a senator shakes SIBTHoRP and fulmines over INGLIs, how
little will it be thought that the new Member—the Jon Es, or SMITH,
or BRowN, or W1GGINs, as it may be—is no other than the PRINCE
Consort, who, on his return home, will delight QUR GRACIQUs LADY
THE QUEEN with a full and particular account of the night's debate.
When his Royal Highness shall be raised to the Peerage, then, and
not until then, will he reveal himself. Then, whom the world admired as
WIGGINs THE ABLE, the world will worship as-ALBERT THE GREAT.
WAUXHALL IN CHANCERY.
THERE is something so º: between a place of amuse-
ment and a Court of Equity, that it cut us to the quick to peruse a
report in Thursday's Times, of an tº." made on the subject of
Vauxhall Gardens in the Court of Chancery. A motion was made to
appoint a receiver, or, in other words, it was proposed to make the
Accountant-Gene ...Y. either in person or by deputy, the money-
taker's box at the door of the Royal *... It would be enough
to damp the spirits of any visiter to be greeted with the words “Pay
here,” from the lugubrious º of an officer of the Court of Chancery,
and to be compelled to give his check into the hands of some filacer or
usher from Lincoln's Inn, with a face of forensic length and an aspect
of legal sombreness. -
The Court of Chancery can, we know, do almost anything in the way of
taking; but we apprehend there will be some difficulty in acting as a re-
ceiver of all the cash paid in for sandwiches, bottled porter, Vauxhallchick-
a-biddies, and the other delicacies in which the frequenters of the
gardens luxuriate. We can understand property being thrown into
Chancery; but we cannot comprehend its being worth the while of
Equity to take cognisance of mere provisions; But it is clear that even
out of a plate of poultry Chancery can find a bone to pick, and, we have
no doubt, would enjoy a grill amazingly.

CHEAP TOURS.
In these days, when it is quite impossible to abroad, there is a most eligible º:
for a lover of travelling—if he happens to be a rich man—who may go abroad to his heart's
content without stirring beyond the equinoctial line (so called because it is half-light and
half-dark), of the Diorama in the Regent's Park. This eligible combination of various climes
and countries is advertised for sale, with all its life-like representations of cathedrals and
mountains, by daylight, sunlight, moonlight, º or any other light, that a dozen gas
burners and ten gauze mediums can be made to produce. We recommend a party of moneyed
tourists to club together for the purchase of the Diorama, when they may frequent, as often
as they please, some of the favourite scenes of the Continent, without exceeding a twopenny
fare by omnibus from their own doors.
THE COLD-EARTH CURE.
THE cold-Earth Doctor visiting. His PATIENTS.
THERE is nosoilin which Quackery flourishes so well, and bears such good fruit, as in England.
From cow-cabbages to Life Pills—from homoeopathy to brandy-and-salt-from nonsense to
º stupidity—it does not matter what it is, they all take root, and the weaker the plant,
generally the further it shoots, and the larger the produce gathered from it., You have only
to cultivate it well with advertisements, and the crop cannot fail to be a liberal ºne.
The last specimen of greenness in this Jºº. branch, has been the Cold-Earth. Cure,
It seems that a man's diseases, like his faults, are completely buried when once he is put
under the earth. You are imbedded for so many hours, up to your chin, and yºu come out
quite new clay. We have heard of an hospital where the º: were arranged in so many
beds, with their heads in rows, like a field of cabbages. The doctor is the gardener, and he
digs you up when you are well, and carries you home in a wheelbarrºw. This system of
horticultural medicine, we are told, is spreading everywhere in the North. . It must be
only another offshoot of the Vegetable Pills. Man can bear a great, deal; but we must
say, we should not like being cut and trimmed like a tree, or, watered like a flower-bed, or
turned over and harrowed like a plough-field, just to get rid of the rheumatism. Wh9
knows, we might rise with
our ears full of corn, our
head replete with green-
stuff, our eyes expanding
into two enormous goose-
berries, whilst our hands
were covered with big
foxgloves, and our coat
showed nothing but a
mass of tares
We have had this new
system explained to us.
First of all, Fº are put
into a bed of virgin soil
up to your waist; your
arms are at liberty, so that
you can read the paper, or
drive away any sparrow
that perches on your
n
Ose.
At twelve o’clock, one
- - - of the medical gardeners
arrives, and administers to you, a douche-bath of the finest gravel. This is repeated every
hour till you experience the most delicious shooting pains all over, when a refreshing shower
from a watering-pot is sprinkled over your head.
This has the desired effect, and your rheumatism,
or your toothache, or your corn, is considerably
relieved, and you feel "as fresh as a daisy.” This
is repeated till nightfall, when you are carried
between pieces of turf into the conservatory,
where you are locked up till the morning; or else
you are provided with a comfortable cucumber-
frame to protect you from the dews of the night,
and the nocturnal invasion of the cats. This
system is persevered in till you acquire quite a
new trunk, when you are transplanted to the
hot-house and fed upon the most nourishing
herbs, and wrapped up in the daintiest leaves.
º these means you are restored to the flower
of your youth, and live to a green old age.
Now, this course of medicine may bevery deep
and clever to those who wish to go below the
surface of things; but for ourselves, we prefer
standing upon the old order of things. Flesh
may be grass, but still we cannot imagine that a
kitchen-garden was ever intended as the hospital
to cure all the “ills that flesh is heir to.” But the
subject is far too grave to be pleasant. The
duties of such a cure borders so much on the
Cemetery, that, we are confident, none but an
undertaker would accept the dirty living.
A Good Toast For A Political, DINNER.
AFTER the number of disfranchised boroughs,
Members unseated, and seats without Members,
it will be absurd for Englishmen, to brag any
more about Purity of Election. Henceforward
the national cry must be, “IMPURITY ºf ELEC-
tion.” We are sure every Member will act up
to it to the utmost of his means.

JOHN BULL’S “ATELIERS NATIONAUX.”
USINEss-MINDED, calculating, º John
BULL, with so many wise wrinkles in his ample
brow, enjoyed many puffs of contempt at those
beautiful castles in the air—castles, rose, and
gold, and sapphire-tinted, like the evanescent
* fabrics of one of these fine July skies—the airy
A castles called Ateliers Nationaur ; bright,
blissful buildings of the last Utopia—Louis
BLANC the hopeful architect. For weeks did
John BULL grunt, and growl, and pooh-pooh
at the glittering mist; and sometimes, in the
depths of his prophetic spirit, did he sternly,
sadly foretell the total dispersion of the cloudy
loveliness—rent, swallowed up by the hurricane
and thunder. And when the storm began; and
when Louis BLANC heard and saw the destruc-
tion of his misty castles in the thunder and smother of the barricades;
when, aghast and spectral, the sometime magician BLANC made his
fitful appearance on the scene of ruin, John Bull, was cool, unmoved,
stoical. He disdained to be surprised. And why? Because John is a
political economist; he knew full well that the Ateliers Nationaur—
wanting a truly economic foundation — would, sooner or later, come
down like houses of cards; though, º; he did not expect with such
a crash, and at such a cost of human life and human suffering.
Nevertheless, having for a brief time pondered on the homicide at
the barricades, John BULL found comfort—a selfish satisfaction, but
withal a cosey one—in the deep conviction that there were no Ateliers
Nationaur in very merry England. He allowed no idlers: he did not
suffer money to he taken from the industrious to cram it in the
pockets of the do-nothings. No, no! Ateliers Nationaur—and such
imcrack Castles of Indolence—were to be expected in monkey France;
ut in solid, practical, equitable Britain—he would as soon tolerate the
hº
hi
t was with this sort of self-complacincy in the superior wisdom of
is own beloved Island, that John laid down the French paper—ſhe
had translated the passage to his wife)—that announced the suppression
of the Ateliers Nationaur.
“Of course, my dear; I always said so: no substance in the notion
—all moonshine, and couldn't last. Pay a mob of people for doing
nothing—pay 'em out of the taxes, too; why, it isn't in reason—it
isn't, my dear”–and JoHN always looked the bigger when he came to
the phrase—“it isn't political economy.”
MRs. BULL was darning her husband's worsted stockings. They had
already been so much mended, that, as she avowed, she was ashamed
people to afford new stockings? People must save somewhere. And
after all, what was the Income-tax, when in England there were no
such burdens—no such folly—no such stupid political economy as
Ateliers Nationauar 2
“Certainly not, John,” said MRs. BULL, in her quiet, matronly way,
taking off her glasses, and calmly rubbing them on her white linen
Apron..." You haven't the same word, certainly; but surely, there is in
England—and that, John, that is what is eating us up, and making
people wear over:darned stockings when they should buy new ones—
there is exactly the same sort of thing.”
." MRs. BULL,” said John, with a mild, benignant look, as though
pitying the ignorance of the partner of his bosom—“MRs. Bull, you’re
a silly woman.”
“Of course, that’s how you men put us all off. But the fact is,
John, you look so much to words—now, I will say it—that you alto:
gether forget the things. Only give a nuisance an English name, and
you swallow it as though you loved it, and could live upon it.”
“What does the foolish woman mean?” cried Bull, knitting his wise
brow, and drawing his lips to a cherry-bob. “I said, in England,
MRs. BULL, we have no Ateliers Nationaur.”
"And I say you have,” replied the dame, “only otherwise christianed.
Willyou hear me, John ”
.."You're a silly thing, my dear,” said BULL, contemptuously filling
his ºil. but go on.”
| “Well then,” said MRs. BULL, “suppose, John, every week I was
to set down in the house expenses, say ten pounds a week, for seed and
sugar and toast for parrots; when, at the same time there wasn't a
- single bird in the house. What should you call that?”
. Rºbbery,” said JoHN, with no hesitation for the word.
Well, then,” said MRs. BULL, “what do you say to that precious
DUKE ºf St. ALBANs?—oh, I’ve been reading all about the fine idlers
Qfour Telver Nashuno, reading it till when I think of 'em, and the hours
I have to darn to save a penny, my blood does boilagain—that precious
Duke that takes in the Nashund £1200 for feeding hawks, when he
hasn't a single feather on his hands? What’s that?”
to see any decent man in 'em. Whereupon, John, with a philosophic instruction
indifference, declared that the stockings were quite good enough for the something -

and nothing short of it. Again, then, what are we to say to the
mint of money that's still paid to the royal bastards of -". -
“Bend sinisters, MRs, Bull, when you speak of high life,” said
BULL, and his eyes twinkled despite of him. . .
“And what are you to say,” cried the persisting woman, “to that
EARL of ELLENBorough, that, as the monkey ate the cheese instead
of weighing it, takes £9000 and more every year out of the scales of
Justice?”
“Forms, my love; that is—perhaps—necessary forms,” stammered
BULL, and he began to redden. - -
“And what do you say, then, to the German Princes that are paid
for doing nothing in our Nashuno 2'
MR. BULL said nothing; but puffed his pipe very violently.
“And what do you say to the Six Clerks’ pensions, and the DUKE of
MARLBoRough's pension; and LoRD CAMPBELL’s pension, for wearing
the Seals of Ireland at his watch-chain for a week; and moreover, what
do you say to the EARL or BesBorough, that takes of the dear QUEEN
º lady, how she is robbed among 'em!) £1700 a year for feeding
the buckhounds, as if the Crown was to be supported by dogs; and—
but here—MR. Bui, look at the list,”—(and here the dame whipped
the Black Book of England from under her chair-cushion, and forced it
in the hand of her husband)—“look at all the names; if some of 'em
...; ut me in mind of police cases for false pretence and embezzle-
ment,
have, in England here—where we’re obliged to
we should buy new ones—say then that º: have no Telyurs Nashuno.”
MR. BULL received the book as though it were a lump of ice: opened
it—ran his eye up and down many a passage—glowing and blinking
the while. At length, in a grand burst of indignation, at his long
ignorance, he dashed the book upon the floor, and rose bolt upright
from his seat. -
“MRs. BuLL,” he said, “I’m sorry to own it; but you're quite right.
We, too, in England, have our Ateliers Nationaur for pensioned idlers.
But we must sweep them away; we must, and no mistake about it.
We, too, must throw up our barricades—but tremble not, my love-
they shall be barricades in the House of Commons.”
A NURSERY FOR NURSES,

An Ill-Fated Revolution.
How will the Three Glorious Days of July be celebrated, this year?
Will there be any rejoicings at Claremont? Will there be any fire;
works, any gratuitous saucissons, any greasy poles, at Paris?, And all
the speeches, too, that used to be delivered to the King, full of such
allegiance, such devotion to the throne of J uly, will they be repeated
this year? e have no doubt the same persons will carry their
homage to the President, and protest to feel all, and to swear all, if not
more, for the Republic than ever they did for the Monarchy. We are
curious to learn how the July fetes have been celebrated? By the bye,
different nations have different fates. It is England's fate to be quiet;
it is France's, apparently, to have nothing but Revolutions. Surely her
destiny is reserved for happier things?
Buckles and Ties.
A writeR in the Daily News very ingeniously, traces, the political
disorders in the middle counties, in 1791-2, to the sudden disuse of
buckles, for shoe-strings. Thousands were thrown out of work:-
“The manufacturers of Birmingham, Walsall, and Wolverhampton, appealed, by
petition, to the PRINCE Regent. He promised his influence and example. On the
strength of this promise hundreds of persons invested their fortunes in buckles.”
# The Prince, however, did not use his influence in the cause, of
buckles; being, perhaps, the only instance on record in which his
Royal Highness was not neglectful of his former “ties.”

THE MODEL MOTHER.
* LL her children are angels. ... She
3. ** knows no children like them.
#3: ToM can already spell words of
ºº: three syllables, and the little
fellow is only five years old next
thirty-first of July. Polly puts
such curious questions, that her
papa is often puzzled to answer
them. It was but yesterday
she asked him “Why he had
such whiskers, and mamma had
none P” and MR. SMITH really
didn't know what to say. Thank
goodness! she has given all of
them a good education, and
there isn't one that can turn
round and reproach her with
a moment’s neglect. She loves
them all dearly, and never
ceases thinking of them. It
does her heart good to see
them happy, and she cannot
understand how mothers can
part with their children, and
put them out to nurse, where
they never see them, and leave
them entirely to the care of a
strange woman.
No wonder their children don't love them! Now, she has nursed
every one of her family, and is she any the worse for it, pray? She
has no patience with such fine ladies. They don't deserve, having
children. Why, look at baby! The little thing knows her, and under-
stands every word she says. If it cries, though it is, the quietest
child in the world—she has only to say “Be quiet, baby!” and it goes
off to sleep directly. No! those who don't behave as mothers, will
never be loved as mothers, and it's her opinion that, when children
turn out bad, it is because they have been neglected in their childhood,
and have never known the comforts of a home. Ingratitude never
fº up in a child's heart, unless it has been first sown there by the
and of the parent. Why, she has never had a moment’s uneasi-
ness with any one of her children—and she has, ten of them,-
and why? Because affection begets affection, and she is positive
they would not do a single thing to make their mother miser-
able. It’s true that NED is “a little racketty,” but boys will be
boys, and the lad is too good at heart ever to go wrong. But if
the worst should happen—not that she fears it—the boy never will
forget his happy infancy, and that’s a blessing!, The thoughts of a
º: childhood has brought back many a prodigal son, and she knows
well enough that her NED would never wander far without feeling that
chain round his heart gently pulling him towards home. But, it’s all
nonsense! The boy’s right enough, if MR. SMITH wouldn't be so
harsh to him
Thus the MoDEL MoTHER defends her children. Their defects are
beauties in her eyes: their very faults are dear to her. They can do no
wrong. If any breakage takes place, it wasn’t the child's fault; she
tells you she’s only to blame. She stays the father's arm when his
anger is about to fall, and stops his voice when his paternal passion is
rising. If any of the boys have gone to the theatre, she sits up to let
them in. When questioned the next morning as to the hour they came
home, she has forgotten everything about it—all she recollects is, that
young ToMate a tremendous supper. She supplies them with money,
and, if her good nature is laughed at, she asks you, pray to inform her
“when lads are to enjoy themselves, if not when they are young?” She
is continually sending presents to Eliza, who, “poor thing! did
not marry so well as her sisters.” . She is not afraid of taking her
daughters out with her, for fear of their age leading to the confession
of her own, nor does she dress like a young lady of sixteen, in order to
look younger than they. To tell the truth, she carries her family every-
where. The youngest she takes to the theatre; on a Sunday they all
go out together; she will not travel, or stir out of town, without the
whole troop, or call on an acquaintance “just in a friendly way to take
dinner,” without having JULIA, and JACKEY, and BETSY, and AUGUSTU's,
and ever so many more with her. She imagines that because she dearly
loves her children, every one must dearly love them also. She discourses
on their talents for hours—the reading of the one, the sewing of the other,
the blue eyes of the third, the superior accomplishments of the eldest,
the wonderful “Busy, Busy Bee’” of the youngest—and tells wonderful
anecdotes that prove them to be the greatest geniuses that ever wore
pinafores. She makes plum-cakes for the boys when at school, and has
them home on the Saturday, and every possible holiday, though she's
told each time that it interferes sadly with their studies.”
The MoDEL MoTHER is happiest, however, at a wedding. She runs
about, kisses her, daughter every time she meets her, looks after the
breakfast, puts all sorts of packages into the travelling-carriage, runs
º and down stairs for no one knows what, and laughs and cries every
ternate minute. She never was so happy; and when her darling girl
says, “Goodbye, mother,” she throws her arms round her neck and wishes
her all the happiness in the world, accompanied with a hope that “she
will never forget her dear mother,” and that “she knows where there is
always a home for her.” Her joy, too, at the birth of the first child is
only equalled by her pride and importance. She never leaves her “pet’s”
bedside, and stops to comfort her, and be the first to kiss the baby.
She attends every christening, and nearly ruins herself in presents to
the nurses, and coral necklaces, and magnificent bibs and tuckers. At
Christmas"she has all her children to dine with her; it has been the
3. of the family as long as she can recollect, and if there is a
daughter abroad, or a son in disgrace no one exactly knows where, she
is the first to call recollection to the fact, and to propose the health of
the missing one after dinner, joined with the prayer that he or she
“may soon be among them again.” In the evening, she arranges the
romps for the boys and girls, and is not the least offended if any one
calls her “grandmother”. Little presents are given, forfeits are played,
glasses of weak negus are handed round, and a Happy Christmas is drank
to all. Sir Roger de Coverley finishes the amusements, in which she leads
off the dance with her husband, after dragging him away from the whist-
table, and she keeps up the fun as long as anybody. At last it is getting
late; her children crowd round her, they kiss her, and hang about her,
and there is nothing but one loud "God bless you, mother!” heard on
all sides. This wish springs from the heart of every one, for there is
not a child but who has felt, in sickness as in health, in adversity, as in
rosperity, abroad as at home, the love and kindness of the MoDEL

DEATH OF A NOTORIOUS CHARACTER.
Last week, at John Street Institution, Tottenham-Court Road, died,
Physical Force Chartism. The deceased had been in a very bad way
some time; and, by his uproarious conduct, gave very great uneasiness
to many who otherwise were his well-wishers. The deceased has not
been opened, which we regret; therefore there are many conflicting
opinions as to the cause of his death. Some attribute it to a softness
of brain, some to diseased lungs; some (the more amiable interpreters)
to the misfortunes of several intimate friends, now undoing oakum in
the House of Correction. We believe that the desertion of MR. CUF-
FEY had a very serious effect upon the spirits of the deceased. It was
thought, at least, that MR. CUFFEY would have closed the eyes of
Chartism, and that MRs. Curfey would have laid him out. We regret
to state that it has been otherwise. The deceased died, almost wholly
neglected. It is still declared by some, that he .# his death on the
10th of April; when, against the advice of his best friends, he would go
to Kennington Common, where--it is !. alarm of the scarlet
fever, latent in the neighbourhood, gave such a shock to his system, that
he sickened from that hour. Nevertheless, he made frequent attempts
to rally, and it is thought, that had his friends supplied him with funds,
he might have lingered on for some time. For want of a shell,his
remains were consigned to an empty money-box; with a bad shilling
mailed upon the lid, as a significant coffin-plate.
Fasting Extraordinary.
A FashionABLE morning contemporary, on last Monday week, made
the following announcement:-
“Mas. BATEs's breakfast is unavoidably postponed till the 26th instant.”
An awful time to go without one's breakfast! We sincerely hope
poor MRs. BATEs may not have been starved.
TRUTH on ToMEstones.—The best epitaph we ever saw was that of
a Clown. It simply said, “HERE I AM! ”

A BATTUE OF BILLS. *
THE Parliamentary shooting season has just commenced, when it is
customary for the Legislature to fire away in good earnest, and hit the
mark at last after the mere noise and smoke in which both Houses have
been indulging during the last eight months. Lord John Russeii, has
just performed the customary process of slaughtering all the superabun-
dant measures that are not sufficiently matured to reach their natural
growth, and a tremendous amount of billicide has been committed. The
House of Commons has been turned into a sort of abattoir for the
yarious hobbies that have been ridden since the opening of Parliament,
but which have come to a dead stand-still, and now evince such an utter
incapacity for further progress that it is considered advisable to put
them out of their misery, at once, and save their friends any further
trouble. The Battue of Bills this year has been perfectly murderous,
and there are but a few survivors left to lament the loss of their com:
panions, who have been cut short in their career.
The Irish Tribune.
THE Times of July the 15th, in its report of the Review of the Clubs
at Cork, says, “The Review having terminated, MR. SMITH OBRIEN
mounted a heap of rubbish, and, fronting the Lunatic Asylum, he pro-
çeeded to harangue,” &c. It strikes us forcibly that iſ those who
take their stand upºn Repeal talk to no other, end. But really, with
Mº.O'BRIEN’s position, and such inspiration before him, ever; word
of his discourse must have gone home." Theºle scene, with its
rubbish and Lunatic Asylum, must have reminded the honourable
Member strongly of Confederation Hall.
THE SUFFERING FOXES.
No doubt, the reader has, of late years, come unexpectedly upon
foxes in highways and in bye-ways, where foxes were to be least
expected. These foxes—the fact has at length been divulged by the
French correspondent in the Morning Post—are victims to the railways.
º have been turned out of their ancestral holes by the despotism
of the iron king. Listen to the Post. The theme is a description of
the road to Vincennes:—
“The route resembled much our Epsom road on a Derby day, such as it was
wont to be before the railway ...ºf its lean long arms through our fields and
parks, shutting us out of our green lanes with its iron bars, puffing its noxious
vapours into the pure air of heaven, and terrifying all our fores from out our best
coverts by that infernal whistle.”
Is it too late in the present Parliament to consider the condition of
these homeless animals—the guileless victims of an infernal whistle!
We put it to ColoneL SIBTHoRP whether, as an enemy of railways, as
an officer and a gentleman, he ought not to bring in a short Bill to
remunerate "all old foxes” for the loss of their “best coverts.” Never,
again, shall we travel by rail with our wonted pleasure. We shall
always be overshadowed, depressed by the thought of the many foxes
terrified by steam into destitution. Now, it is not “the little foxes”
that spoil the vines, but the lines that spoil the little foxes.

THE (VERY) RUM DUTIES.
THERE has been a long debate on the “Rum Duties.” It followed
the Debate on what the Ministry had done,—or rather had not done,
this Session.—A most, fit end for such, a beginning ! By the bye, a
Whig never displays the smallest spirit, but it is sure to turn out rum. |

“OH DEAR1 WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE **
THIs is the question one naturally asks when one hears of all the
maladies among the animal and vegetable, kingdoms, which are being
regularly revolutionised, or turned upside down, in accordance with the
present order, or disorder, of things throughout the Continent. The
sheep are unfortunately laid up with the small-pox; the pigs are suf-
fering from their old complaint, the measles; the young Highland steers
are all so bad that they are being dosed with STEER's opodeldoc.; the
caterpillars can scarcely grub on; the gnats have lost their matty look;
the 5. are breaking fast; and even the fish may be said to be
* under water on the brain, or some other equally distressing
malady.
Besides the invalids of the finny tribe, we may particularise the
crustacea as being nearly all indisposed; and though the mussels are
straining every nerve to keep up, while the cockles are trying to stimu-
late the cockles of their hearts by an assumed cheerfulness, those who
look ..º. to the bottom of the sea—will perceive a general
depression among the tenants of the briny ocean: even the sharks are
giving vent to a melancholy wailing, and, the shrimp, in its small way,
is labouring under the almost universal illness that has afflicted the
inmates of the ocean. We recommend the throwing of 12,000,000
boxes of PARR's Life Pills into the sea, for the benefit of the fishes
tº: the good of the public who otherwise might get hold of the
inculcine.
A PLUNGE
INTO THE THAMES.
A shabby CREw, who ARE ABOVE PAYING TO SEE THE Tournaxtºxt.
The Earth has been worked fallow for a fresh crop of amusements.
The Air has been traversed with fireworks and balloons. Even Fire has
been stirred up and eaten, to give the flºº, public a fresh appetite
for sight-seeing. There was nothing left but the water, to slake the
thirst of the dusty million for something new. The Proprietor of
Cremorne Gardens has plunged boldly into this, and it promises to
turn º new element of success. There are depths in the Thames
which have not yet been sounded, and hundreds of pounds are
there concealed, if a person will only trouble himself to go to the
bottom-but then he must not get on a Cricket steamer to prosecute
his search, or he may never return from his inquiry. However, the
Aquatic Tournaments do this admirably for every one, and you enjoy
all the sport, without getting any of the ducking. Next to bathing
yourself, there is nothing so refreshing, perhaps, in this warm weather,
as seeing other persons º sue the manly pastime, which is here
carried to its greatest depth. Life-Guardsmen go head over heels, and
seem to stand water just as well as fire. Wrestlers court the Thamesian
mud, reckless of the laughter that follows their divers exploits.
Swimmers splash about like regular TRItons, and old NEPTUNE looks
on, smiling as becomes such a professed veteran.
The balancing-pole, however, is the great fun. The Revenue itself
cannot be a mºre slippery affair to balance than that great pole which
is bent upon plunging every one into the mud which yawns beneath it,
just as if the candidates were only so many Whig Ministers. There
is a mine of wealth, we repeat, in the Thames; the first plunge has only
been taken. Why not have an aquatic circus? Thereis AMPhitsite,
who might becalled upfrom her coral caves to execute a rapidact of sea.

FOUND, TWO CONUNDRUMS!
THEY will be given .# to the owner upon his leaving his name and
address with, the publisher, and paying all expenses. Respectable
references be required. - - -
The following is an accurate description of the two Conundrums, as
far as we could make them out:—
FIRST CONUNDRUM.
Q: Why is an old gentleman who gives a hundred thousand pounds
to his favourite niece like PERRot?
A. Because he comes down with a plum (aplomb).
- second goNUNDRUM.
Q: What is the best wine to drink at dinner?
A. Why, or-dinnery wine, of course, you great pump!!!
An early application is requested, as it is feared that the Conundrums,
unless speedily removed, will do serious damage, for they are of that
ſº nature that it is found utterly impossible for any one to keep
cul ill.
A Hint for Holloway.
PROFEssº Holloway has shown so much vigour of imagination in
his cases of “a gentleman having recovered the use of" this, that, and
the other, by the use of the Professor’s Ointment and Pills, that we think
we cannot do less than reward his ingenuity by suggesting to him some-
thing new, in the shape of an Advertisement.
“A GENTIEMAN Recovered THE Use of His senses. By So-AND-
So's, PILLs. The patient had long been addicted to the folly of taking
quack medicines, and he had resorted to every º and ointment that
came out, without deriving from any of them the smallest benefit : at
length, in a fit of unusual absurdity, he tried Professor So-and-So's
Pills, the effects of which were such as to cause him at once to recover
the use of his senses, and he has never been known from that time to
take a single dose of quack medicine.”
ONE FACT, is worth A. Dozen DERATEs.-More Members have
been unseated for bribery this Session than in any previous one. This
is only another proof that No Reform is needed.

IRISH AGITATION."
ARMS FOR THE
acºuſtº
We have lately seen the Arms of Sicily, which consisted of
nothing but legs. Now, the Irish Confederation has been going lately
at such a rapid rate, that the same arms would do capitally for it, for
really it wishes to walk into everything. It has long been dis-
tinguished for the absence of head, and vapour and smoke are not
a bad substitute, as Irish rebellion goes, for brains. A pair of wings
will assist its flight, whilst its long legs will help it to get out of the
way of danger in time. ... We present the Irish Clubs with the above
arms; and, if they will only take our advice, º had better throw away
the pikes and blunderbusses they have lately bought, and remain
peaceful, as we are doing in England, in the hopes that there is “A good
time coming, Boys.” Why nºt join cause with the Saxon, and make a
common cause—one victory of it?
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
“MY DEAR SIR,
“WILLyou excuse my stepping out of my grave just to address
ou? You said in your leader of July 18th, (an admirable one, but this
is “spoken aside,') that “a full-grown Bill bounces on the table of the
House like a Harlequin out of a window, and exclaims: ‘Here I am!”
“Now excuse me, Sir, but Harlequins never speak. They jump
through windows, it is true, and very º they do it; but not a
syllable ever comes from them. Like a dumb beggar, a word would
ruin them. It is only the Clown who speaks,—a truth which can be
ºned any day by reading the Debates, or any old copy of Mother
00&e.
“Will you allow me therefore, Sir, to take the words out of Harle-
quin's mouth, and to put them into my own? I have said them so
often that I am sure no one will doubt my word, or attempt to rob me
of a single one of those above.
“With every respect,

Turf Pressure.
THE scientific papers inform us that “LoRD WILLough BY DE
ERESBY has constructed a turf-pressing machine, which secures uni-
formity of pressure.” The thing which presses the hardest upon the
Turf, we always understood to be the settling day at TATTERSALLs'.
The uniformity of this pressure, however, we very much doubt, for
hitherto it has only pressed upon those who could afford to pay, without
touching in the slightest upon those who had not the means to pay.
If Lord WILLough BY has at all remedied this inequality, he must be
the best friend the Turf has had for years; for hitherto the pressure has
been so much upon one side, and the ground has been so slippery, that
it has required a very strong man to maintain his footing upon the Turf
for any length of time. Lord WILLoughby deserves a testimonial from
the “Stable Mind.”
NATIONAL VANITY-Governor Dodge has been nominated as Vice-
A DINNER ON THE EASTERN COUNTIES.
It is not, &º generally known that there is a regular table
d'hôte at the ºf: Station, for the passengers by the trains that
stop at that delightful rendezvous. The first course consists of soup,
boiled up to fever heat, and the next course is that mere matter of
course—the ringing of the bell—before three spoonfuls of the soup can
be taken by the most determined of railway Salamanders, or eaters of
fire. It is necessary to have the º: of Monsieur CHABERT, the
gentleman who lived on prussic acid and red-hot coals some twenty
years ago, or took his dish of ash direct from the grate every day—it is
we say, necessary to have this individual’s tongue, with a throat of
genuine asbestos, in order to partake comfortably of the soup on the
Eastern Counties Railway.
We have seen some infatuated individuals sitting down to partake
of the table d'hôte spread for them at the Cambridge Station, but we
never saw anyone get beyond the spontaneous combustion of his mouth
with the burning soup, and we really believe that the rest of the dinner
is a mere matter of fiction, which the rapid starting of the train after
the first four mouthfuls renders completely superfluous.
Nothing can be easier than to start atable d'hôte on a railway line; for
it requires only a tureen full of boiling hot liquid and a few dramatic
chickens, with a piece of cold roast beef done in profile by a good stage
carpenter who knows his business—and a few slices of practicable—
that is to say real-bread, when, by a timely ringing of the bell, the
whole company may be drawn off atonce, before the “mean subterfuge.”
of canvas fowls and timber sirloins can be detected. We verily believe
that we have recognised the same “property” plum-pudding on the
table at one of the Stations for the last three months, and we have no
doubt that the sponge-cake in the centre is dusted once a week, and
garnished with candied lemon-peel once a month, for the lemon-peel is
candid enough to speak for itself, and it tells its own age by the extreme
dryness of its aspect. -
As to the sandwiches at the table d'hôte, they prove the indifference
of the proprietor to his own interest, for it is quite evident that he
could not say on which side his bread is buttered. We have nothing to
say against the ordinary refreshments at the Cambridge Station, which are
no doubt sufficiently cheap and good, but it is against the attempt at
a table d'hôte that we protest, when five minutes are allowed to
make a meal, upon which the most mealy-mouthed could not bestow,
conscientiously, the smallest eulogium.
THE POLITICAL SIAMESE TWINS,
MR. URQUHART protested-
MR. Anstey complained-
MR. URquhart would divide the House—
MR. Anstey would support his Hon. Friend-
The House does divide, and the Siamese Twins get one by their motion
—thus proving, singularly enough, the great unity that exists between
them. Really, we wish these two-in-one gentlemen would propose
some amendment in their own acts, instead of those of Parliament.
This mighty league of two is getting dreadful. It must be weakened.
Now Anstey is nothing without Urquhart, and URquhart is still less
without ANSTEY. The only plan, then, is to separate them, or else the
country is lost. But perhaps it will be safest to leave them alone.
They are so fond of dividing everything, that eventually they cannot
fail to get up a division betwixt themselves. With their usual clever-
ness for splitting straws, they must succeed in the operatiºn, and when

THE MODEL LODGING-HOUSE KEEPER.
SHE is so hurt to hear that
the children disturb you!
She has the greatest trouble
in keeping them quiet, but
begs you will not hesitate
to mention it if they are at
at least fifty times never to
come into your room, the
little plagues!—She’s very
sorry, but she cannot make
twenty breakfasts, and wait
upon twenty gentlemen all at
once. You really must wait
a little longer.—Well! it’s
very strange, but the chimney
never did smoke before:
whatever can be the cause of
it?—Oh! that noise at the
back is the skittle-ground—
she quite forgot to mention
it previously, but her house
adjoins “a public,”—it’s a
É. nuisance to be sure,
ut it’s only of an evening,
and won't trouble you muc
after eleven.—She hopes you
feel tººlſ perfectly com-
fortable?
She can't for the life of her make out who takes, your books 1 all she
knows is, that she's no time for reading—it must be that hussey, ANN;
she’ll send her away as sure as she’s born, if she catches her at it.!—
You must make a mistake-there wasn't a bit of the leg left yesterday,
she's ever so positive there wasn't—she can show you the bone if you
wish it.--She never recollects coals so abominably dear; it’s quite
shameful! The ton you had in last week is all gone, and she was
obliged to lend you a coal-scuttle herself this morning.—She can’t make
out what makes the paper so very late—those tiresome boys are enough
to wear one's life out.—She’s very sorry if there's no mustard in the
house—she has told ANN, to get some at least a hundred times, if she
has told her once, but it’s of no use. She must get rid of the girl!
—Lor! how very provoking—she wishes you had only told her you
wanted some hot water—she’s just that very minute put the kitchen
fire out, but there’s some nice fresh water, if you’ll have any.
What! a FLEA? (it is quite impossible to express the scream in
§ the reader must imagine in his mind's ear something equal in
shrillness to a railway whistle), A FLEA!!!, did you say. Oh! that she
should live to hear such a thing! She’s only a poor lone widow, and
it’s cruel—that it is—to throw such a thing in her face | Well! if you
are bitten all over, it’s no fault of hers; you must have brought the
“nasty, things” in yourself. Her house is known to be the sweetest
hoºse in the whole street—you can ask anybody if it isn't!—Would
§ be kind enough not to ring the bell so often—there’s a poor invalid
y on the first floor, and it distresses her, sadly l-She begs your
ardon, but linen always was an extra–she had a gentleman who stopt
in her two parlours once for ten years: he was a very nice gentleman
to be sure, something in the law, and he never all the time raised so
much as a murmur against the linen, nor any other gentleman that she
has had any dealings with. You must be mistaken.
She really cannot clean more than one pair of boots a day—some
rsons' seem to have no bowels for the servants—poor creatures —
ell! what’s the matter with the curtains, she should like very much
to know? What, rather old | Well! on her word it’s the first time she’s
eyer been told so, and they have only been up these eight years, -
if so much, decidedly not more . However, if persons are not satisfied,
they had better go–she has been offered three and sixpence a week
more for the rooms—and goodness knows she doesn't make a blessed
farthing by them. She’s anxious to satisfy everybody, but cannot do
wonders—and what's more, won’t, to please any body!—She’s ex-
tremely sorry to hear that you have lost half your shirts, but she
cannot be answerable for her servants, of course. She has told her
lodgers over and over again always to be careful and lock their drawers,
till she’s § tired of telling them! What do you say? They always
have been locked! Well! she shouldn't at all wonder now that you
suspect her?—if so, she can : tell you to your face that she doesn't
wear shirts, and begs that you’ll suit yourself elsewhere. She never
experienced such treatment in all her life, and more than that, she
won’t-no, not to please the Queen, or the yery best lodger in the
world! º ou’ll accuse her next of stealing your tea and sugar?
What, you do ell! she’s ashamed of you—that she is—and should
like exceedingly to know what you call yourself? A gentleman indeed!
No more a gentleman than she is a gentleman. However, she won't
all noisy. She has told them |b
harbour such gentlemen in her house, she's determined of that, so
you’ll please take the usual notice, and bundle yourself off as quick as
you can, and precious good riddance too! She won't stand, nonsense
from anybody, though she is nothing better than a poor widow, and
has not a soul to protect her in the wide world! She never saw such
a gentleman.
Not a word more, however, is said. The next evening, some oysters
are sent in for supper “with Missus’ compliments, please she says they're
beautifully fresh ; * or if it is Sunday, she ventures in herself with her
est cap, and two plates, one over the other, and “hopes you will excuse
the liberty, but the joint looked so nice, she thoug t you would just
like a slice of hot meat for luncheon, with a nice brown potato.” She
stirs the fire; sees that the windows are fastened down tight; can't
make out where the draft comes out; asks in the softest voice whether
ou wouldn't like a nice glass of pale ale; and finishes by wiping with
er apron the dust off the mantelpiece and all the chairs, and hoping
that you’re comfortable.
As the fatal day draws near, she knocks at the door. “Is she dis-
turbing you? Would you be kind enough to let her have a little drop of
brandy—she should esteem it a great favour—she has such a dreadful
sinking.”
The next morning she lays the breakfast cloth herself. For the first
time the weekly ; is not ready, “but she’s in no hºy-Aºy time
will do. Why? surely you're not thinking of going in this way? You
have been with her so long; she should be miserable to lose you-such
a nice gentleman too—you cannot mean to go!”
. But, alas! there is no appeal.., Here let us shut the door. Iº.

fearful sarcasms of that last day... Arithmetic too, falls powerless before

A PROBLEM SOLVED.
PEOPLE have been wondering a good deal lately, how it is that France
contrives to be called, or to call itself, the centre of civilisation. We will
not dispute the assumption of the French, but we can only say, that if
their country is the centre of civilisation, there must be just now a good
deal of centrifugal force in operation, which drives all the civilisation
away from the place which national vanity proclaims to be its centre.

56 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OVERWORKEd DOOR-KEEPER."
SoME ill-natured remarks have re-
cently been made on the subject of
the duties and salary of the door-
keeper to the Court of Chancery. It
is really too bad to throw out insinu;
ations of idleness against an official
whose occupation is constant; for if
he even had nothing else to do but
to open the door of the Court of
Chancery to the abuses that are con-
tinually pouring in, he would find
himself incessantly at work in his
official capacity. It is true, perhaps,
that as the door for abuses is left
wide open at nearly all times, there
is an economy of the door-keeper's
exertions to a considerable extent:
but the labours of the official exten
to a series of arduous tasks of which the º: cannot be cognizant.
We have been at some trouble to trace the door-keeper through an
entire day's work, and whenit is remembered he has only £32.18 a-year,
and that his claim rests upon usage, which is the most peremptory of
all laws—for “use is second nature"—we are sure it must be admitted
that the functionary thoroughly earns his salary. He begins his day's
work-in a costume sufficiently light to fit him for the arduous under-
taking-by reading, or at-
tempting to read, the Morning
Post, with the aid of coffee
and other stimulants. Those
only who have tried to accom-
lish this exhausting feat, can
orm any opinion of what the
door-keeper goes through, if
he goes º a column of
the journal selected for the
exercise of his powers of
endurance.
This toil being over, he
proceeds to the scarcely less
fatiguing operation of a drive
in #. #. in the course of
which rapid act of flºº.
his head is perpetually at wor
in the distribution of nods,
bows, and smiles-to say
nothing of touches of the hat
—to his numerous circle of
male and female acquaintance. It is calculated that the muscles of
his mouth assume no less than five thousand different itions during
one circuit round the ring, and it is humbly presumed that this of itself
would be sufficiently hard work to entitle
him to two-thirds at least of his door-
keeper's salary.
Perhaps, however, it is the evening's
demandon his physical and mental ener.
#. that may be supposed to give the
nishing touch to the prostration of the
used-up door-keeper. He may be seen
in a box of HERMAJESTY's Theatre, per-
forming feats of almost Herculeanstrength
with his hands, and gasping out in mur-
murs, rendered faint and gentle by the
exhausting labours of the day, an occa-
sional “brava” at the strains of the
reatest Swedish turn-up that ever fell
into the hands of a manager. We trust,
after this explanation, that we shall hear
no more about the office of door-keeper
to the Court of Chancery, with its £3218
per annum, being little better than a
-- - - - - sinecure. We shall be having the holder
of it giving it up in a fit of over-sensitiveness if these imputations upon
the value or extent of his exertions should be cruelly persisted in.
Court Patronage.
From the immense fatigue undergone by the Silver-stick and Gold.
stick-in-waiting during Her Majesty's visits of state to the Royal
Italian Opera House and other theatres, it has been decided to appoint
a third officer to lighten the burden of the twº above officials. The
new birth will be bestowed on.G. Hudson, Esq., M.P., under the title
of the “Iron-stick-in-waiting.”
TO AGED CLERGYMEN.
We subjoin an advertisement from the Athenaeum, that must drop upon
the greyhead of some curate of “not less than 80 years of age,” like a
whole omer full of mamma:-
O AGED CLERGYMEN.—The Patron of a Rectory of about £700 a
year is desirous of presenting it, in the most legitimate manner, to a clergyman
of not less than 80 years of age, ºf sound High Church principles.—Applications, with
testimonials, &c. to be addressed to --All i-arian---
be considered quite conſidential.
The Patron is, of course, desirous of keeping the Rectory aired for a
short season; hence, why did henot at once put forth his wants in the
following straightforward terms?—
ANTED, A WARMING PAN for a Rectory. The said Warming-
Pan must be avery old Warming-Pan, as it is only needed for a very, very
little while; the young gentleman for whom the bed is destined being about to
leave College in a very short time, when there will be no further use for the warm-
ing-Pan, the º young gentleman keeping the bed aired himself.
Perhaps, moreover, we do the Patron-ſwould he sit for his portrait
to LEEcHP)-grievous wrong. Possibly, his “High Church prin-
ciples”—by the way, some people's principles fly as high as Chinamen's
kites, there is no discovering the er “clergymen of not less than
eighty years of *. for the best of reasons: they are best illuminated
for their office. For what says the poet?
“The soul's darkmansion, battered and decayed,
Letsia new light thro’ chinks that time hath made.”
Hence the Patron-through his octogenarian rector—may obtain at
least a glimpse of the light that, from his present darkness, there is no
doubt he wants. “Tell him,” said BEN Jonson, sending a message to
KING JAMEs, “tell him his soul lives in an alley.” May not the soul
of a Patron dwell in the darkness of a mouse-hole?—Of a Church
mouse-hole?
ANOTHER CRY FROM ANOTHER BLUE.COAT BOY.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“IAM so glad you have said we were not charity boys, and
hadn’t anything to do whatever with a charity. We feel more com-
fortable now, and don't mind so much what the little blackguards say,
when they laugh at our dress—it isn't very handsome, though, is it?
My sisters don't like it at all, and wish you could get it altered forus.
I tell you what we should like—a nice little velvet cap, with a gold
tassel; and a coat (red's a nice colour,) with tails (of course), and some
pretty brass buttons. Then instead of our yellow stockings, which are
not becoming, are they? and expose our legs to all kinds of remar
we should wish to have some white trousers, that fit tight, an
Wellingtons, with high heels. These, with a buff waistcoat and a blue
tie, would do much better than our present costume, and would save us
the annoyance of being mistaken for vulgar boys, that are under the
command of a beadle with a big cane, and sing on Sundays in the organ-
loſt...We have no doubt, if you would make a nice drawing for us, that
the thing would soon be done. I am sure our mammas would like it
immensely; or, if it came to the worst, we should not mind wearing
a gown like the boys you see in the pastrycooks' and cigar "...i
about King's College—but the red coat and white trousers woul

only get in.

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
EveRypopy admits that the Thames authorities are only waiting for
a tremendous accident, by the overcrowding of a steamer, to take the
necessary measures for protecting the lives of the community. We
have no doubt that “There’s a good time coming, boys,” as the song
says; but it is a great pity that it don’t come at once, for the Load
Mayor can do nothing for us till he has got a tremendous accident to
go upon. He requires a few broken heads and arms, as data to deal
with, and it is only upon the disjecta membra of a few tourists, tº
Greenwich or Gravesend, that he canyenture to legislate...We
not be allowed to feel cool and collected in a steampacket until some of
our fellow-creatures have beenblown to bits in such a style as to render
it º impossible that they should ever be cool and collected after-
Wards.
We really begin to wish that some gallant fellows would crowd them-
selves into one of the river craft, for the purpose of forming the
materials of a “terrific casualty,” and thus do for the Thames what
CURTIus did for the gulf, in closing it up by making himself the sacrifice
for his fellow-citizens. The river yawns, and the LoRD Mayor is
asleep, until some over-crowded steamer, turning itself into a forlorn
hope, shall perish in the attempt to awaken the authorities from their
fatallethargy. When there shall be a regular explosion on the Thames,
and some of the victims shall sing in mournful chorus,
“Here we go up, up, up,”
while others proceed with the dismal refrain,
“Here we go down, down, down,”
nothing will be done for the prevention of the overcrowding of steam-
boats. A reward ought to be offered for a cargo of voluntary Woyades,
willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of the public in general. If
some of the Irish rebels would undertake this service, they might be
doing a service to themselves by cooling their revolutionary ardour, and
at the same time earning the gratitude of their English fellow-subjects.
THE WOICES OF A NATION.
We see a pretty little book advertised, called The Cries of London.
What a curious book the Cries of Paris for the last twenty years would
make It should begin with Charles X, and give the different cries
of the House of Bourbon, Wive la Duchesse de Berri, Vice le Duc de
Bordeaur, &c. &c. Then it should enumerate all the cries of the July
Revolution, starting with Wive la Charte, and ending with Wive Louis-
Philippe, specifying all the numerous cries which followed Le Premier
(and le Dernier) Roi des Français. Then should follow the cries which
have made France such a place of crying evils ever since February. The
Wire Barbes! Wive le Bonnet Rouge, Pive la Guillotine, and Long Live
many other things that would let no one else live. Lastly should come
Wive la République. Here, for the present, the series should stop, just
reserving a line for Wive Lamartine, (a cry in which we would join with
all our heart,) only perhaps it will be best to leave the book alone. It
would only suggest melancholy thoughts, proving that a nation is often
so childish that it will cry almost for anything. Since France, however,
is fond of crying Wive everything, we will give it a motto, which is quite
as good as Liberté, Egalité, and Fraternité. Let the cry of every
Frenchman henceforward be “Live AND LET Live.” If this were
generally acted upon, it would knock down the barricades more
...; ly than all the cannon from Vincennes. We say “Wive tout le
monate.
IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.
COMMITTEE or supply–ARMY ESTIMATES.
MR. B. Osborne said it was a great hardship to compel officers to
march or go to dinner in full-dress coats. How absurd it was to ask
an officer with £60 a year to march in a coat worth £20. (Hear, hear!)
It was also very ridiculous to substitute a shell-jacket for the usual
undress coat.
MR. Punch (Member for all England) thought that a shell-jacket was
the best fitted for lobsters. (Loud cheering.)
GENERAL Evans and Colonel, Sibthorp rose to order.
Colonel, DuNNE didn't care being himself made the subject of MR.
PUNCH's attacks, but in the name of the whole “line” he protested
against the term lobsters being used in reference to that portion of the
y.
MR. PUNCH had no objection to say, that he had merely used the term
lobsters in a Parliamentary sense. (Oh, oh!)
GENERAL, Evans, Colonel SIBTHoRP, and (CoLoREL DUNNE were
then perfectly satisfied.
Mr. Punch resumed his seat and his hat.
MR. Osborne wanted to know how it was that, in the 7th Dragoons
at the Cape, all the bullets were too large for the rifles?
MR. Fox MAULE apprehended the Hon. Member laboured under a
great mistake. The fact was (Hear, hear!)—the fact was, all the rifles
were too small for the bullets.
NO LIGHT MATTER.
WE are not afraid of being suspected of revolutionary or republican
F. and wetherefore do not hesitate to avow that we have serious
thoughts of raising the cry of “Les Lampions” in the first-class carriages
of the Eastern Counties Railway. If the Directors do not trim the
lamps, we shall certainly begin to trim the characters of the Directors;
and we earnestly call upon them to pour the soothing oil of sperm on
the storm that is raging in our angry º Our mental ejaculations
have already amounted to “A has HUDson 1* and we have once or twice
“pronounced” emphatically on the subject to guards, policemen,
inspectors, and station clerks, who, individually and collectively, shake
their heads with a melancholy confession of utter ignorance as to the
cause of the darkness to which the Directors of the Eastern Counties
have doomed us. Even the night train is but partially supplied with
light, and there being only one lamp where there should be two or
three, it is impossible for more than one passenger in a carriage to be
illuminated, while the rest remain wrapped in gloomy obscurity.
The intelligent librarian has it, we believe, in contemplation to include
a candle in each newspaper or book he sells after eight o'clock, P.M.,
so that the purchaser may see to read what he has bought-except in
the case of Punch, which, like the sun itself, requiresno borrowed light,
and can be perused at all times by the blaze of its own brilliancy...
Our Own Alarming Intelligence.
OUR penny-a-liners in the agricultural districts tell us that drilling
has been extensively practised in most of the English provinces, and
that the effects are beginning to show themselves in a general rising all
over the country. As we, happily, never believe a word that our penny-
a-liners write to us, we transmitted one of our confidential scouts (we
keep fifty at a thousand a year each) to inquire into the truth of our
reporter's reports, and we have ascertained that there has been a vast
uantity of drilling (with reference to turnips), and that the rising of
º crops throughout the land is general.
The Weakness of Human Nature.
A young author wrote to his father a letter of the best resolutions.
Amongst other glowing promises, he said, “I am tired of joking, and
ashamed of punning. Light literature is to me now so heavy, that I
am resolved no longer to support the burden. I am determined to go
in for higher things.”
The next week he went up in a balloon!. -
Alas! for the goodness of young men's intentions!!
The Great Wentilator of the House of Commons.
The education of some Members has been dreadfully neglected.
Look at MR. Anstey. It is as much as he can do to count. Some-
times he gets as far as 30; occasionally he musters as many as 35;
once or twice he has been able to reach as high as 39;...but never, in
our recollection has he succeeded, in one sitting, in getting up to the
figure of 40. It cannot be denied that no man in the House counts
less (figuratively speaking), than MR. ANSTEY.

We regret, to perceive the Electric Telegraph becoming so very sadly addicted to
falsehood, that we never know when the fluid is speaking the truth. If the wires were
the wires, of a harp, they could scarcely represent such a ferocious lyre as the
Electric Telegraph turns out to be. The old saying, "Between you, and me, and

We may with justice say to the fluid, “Bless me! how you do run on!” when we find
it telling lies at the rate of hundreds of miles in half a second. We think an action for
libel would lie against the Telegraphic bar for impugning the fidelity of the Army, and we
can only express our surprise that the wire, which seems generally pretty rigid in adhering
to the straight line, should have allowed itself to fall into such very loose observations.
OUR OWN ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
As we find our contemporaries are in the habit of pro-
ducing immense effect by news manufactured expressly
for them at the offices of the Electric Telegraph, we
have some idea of establishing a little electric telegraph
of our own, for the production of startling intelligence.
In order to give our readers an idea of the kind of
article we should be enabled to furnish, we beg leave to
lay before them one or two specimens. Of course we
should head our news in the usual manner, and the
usual type, with the words
BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
A beadle has just galloped through Kensington, on
a donkey, with the report that the pump at Hammer-
smith is inflames, the spout torn out, and the handle
in the hands of the Chartists. The police are said to
have been tampered, with, and a Sergeant has been
seen.with a pint pot at his lips, drinking success to
the five, six, or as many points as the insurgents are
willing to propose to him.
A ſº." whom somebody has seen, and whom
nobody knows, has arrived, out of breath and out of
gash, at our office, with the announcement of his having
been plundered by a mob, who, he says, are in posses:
sion of the capital; but we have not been able to
learn whether he alludes to the capital he had in his
purse, or whether he uses the word capital with a more
important meaning. He states—at a guinea a line—
that the teeth have been torn out of the policemen's
rattles; that PUMMELL has been well pummelled; that
the charity-boys have been called out, but upon the
master seeing them in the street, they were all called
in again. The omnibus time-keeper has fled—continues
our breathless and cashless informant—Kensington
runs with gore as far as Gore House, and the omnibuses
are being sent as barricades, to block up Fleet Street in
the usual manner.
ANIRISH QUAKER.
We hearmuch of the charity of the Society of Friends,
but we never heretofore knew of a member of their
community displaying such a specimen of that virtue
as the following, recorded in the Waterford Chronicle:-
“within the last few days, an application was made by some
persons in the adjacent town for a small piece of iron and a bit
of steel, to make a few pikes, to a Quaker gentleman in the iron
trade. The merchant, more kind than merchants usually are,
gave the poor applicants-iron and steel sufficient to make 2000
pikes. Honest Quaker that, say wet."
Honest Quaker, indeed—honest as Iago!. But mark
our contemporary's pathos. The poor applicants come
to beg, not a little meal to make a few loaves, but a
small piece of iron and a bit of steel to make a few pikes.
The Quaker, “more kind than merchants usually are,”
gives them—not sacks of flour, wherewith to make two
thousand loaves, but iron and steel, sufficient to make
two thousand, pikes. The humble petitioners are
hungry and athirst—not for food and drink, but for blood
and carnage—and the tender-hearted Quaker feeds
them. Why, the Waterford Chronicle is maudlinin its

PUNCH*S LITTLE BIRD.
UDGE what manner of bird it is! - -
Is it a pye—a daw—a starling—a jay? Or is
it a dowager macaw—or an maid cockatoo—
or a small spinster parrot, succinct in tender
green? Is it of the tribe of jewelled humming-
irds, trained to swoop at butterflies P Is it a
sparrow-hawk with an eye for chickens? ..
Does it build on the elm-tops of a bishop P
Does it nestle in the cornice of a city mansion?
Does it watch from a mud hut the feathered
mason of a cottage-corner P
It matters not; and if it did, 'twould be allone.
The bird shall remain, to the knowledge of the
reader at least, without a name—unchristened—
as though ADAM had never beheld its ancestral cock and hen.
There is a sort of swallow, whose nest is melted into soup for man-
darins. A hundred swallow-houses are dissolved, and steam in one
China vase ; the very houses of the birds are gulped by the rapacity
of man... Lobsters have a better fate; though devoured themselves,
respect is shown to their blood-red coat of mail. Even the oyster,
when opened by Equity, is by Equity bolted without the shells.
Our Little Bird, like the swallows above, will elaborate a nest for
the moral appetite of the reader. And the nest will be made of all
sorts of materials. Now will be found a bit of cinnamon, a shred of
clove, that the phoenix, in his rare building season would take a day's
flight for; and now a lock of wool, plucked, it may be, from the
Chancellor's own sack, when haply his Lordship is nodding.
it Our Little Bird has a bird's eye for everything: it will pick up all
lt may.
We had hardly written the promise, when our Little, Bird flew in at
the window with a bit of paper, like a label, in its mouth. Here it is—
* The door-k of the Court of Chancery. whose duties are returned as “none,’
receives a salary from “fees” to the extent of 3218. per annum, his right to which
is returned in the parliamentary papers as “usage’ only.”
Our Little Bird has perched upon the inkstand, and now sips the ink;
for it is a strange little creature, and loves the literary black broth upon
*::: we foolscap Lacedemonians live, and now preens its rumpled
eathers.
So; let us again read the news brought by our Little Bird. What?
The door-keeper of the Court of Chancery have no duties! Was
there ever such ignorance, or such spite? Why, is he not the great
turnkey of Equity? Is it not, a watchful janitor, his sole unceasing
travail that, suitors once in Chancery, they shall never escape? Is he
not the unrelenting Ne Ereat—the reversed Cerberus, with his one
tail turned to the back of the door, that innocents may, without seeing
his terrors, creep in ; and with his three heads—with costly grinders in
every jaw-opened and opposed, that they shall never get out?
hy, his smaller brethren, the grimed and mouldy Philistines, who
in other days sat watchful in the human rat-traps in neighbouring
Cursitor Street; the biped sponges that, with truly zoophyte mouths,
sucked up the last drops of their guests—their life was but a life of
listlessness, cheered now and then, it is true, by the music of the door-
chain, the shooting of the lock; a life of idlesse to the still incessant
toil, the unwinking vigilance of the janitor of the Court of Chancery.
No duties! Is it nothing to watch with three heads, only one eye of
the six sleeping by turns, lest a thousand captives or so should break
Chancery? Is it nothing to see the miserable prisoners growing paler
and greyer, as they pace the Court, framed of ruddy brass; and wearing
gyves that, though they clank not, are heavier than iron?, Fetters of
parchment, writ and writ with cabalistic meaning; bonds that cut into
i. * and—it has been known—bring gangrene to the torn, expecting
ear
Or take the other side.—Is it nothing not to keep the door, and to
know that less than your shadow; a nominis umbra of a door keeper;
a thing of moonshine or rather of marsh-shine, being the Jack-o'-lanthorn
that is born of corruption, dodges and flickers there, making pilgrims
for justice-widows and orphans, among them, mind you—shake
from their scrips three thousand two hundred and eighteen pounds
every, year of God's grace as a lie offering? Is it nothing to stop
travellers for justice with fees at their breasts; fees of three thousand
two hundred and ... barrels?
Consider it thus, door-keeper. Work out this terrible bit of Newgate
arithmetic, and conscience may burn in your cheek, hot and searing as
the old Newgate brand.
How many thieves—young and mature—say, at twenty groats a head
T-how many may obtain places in the Old Bailey dock at the booty of
three thousand two hundred and eighteen pounds per annum ? Get chalk
and slate, and work out that sum, master door-keeper. But you will
say these are no parallels, for they put their dirty, naked hands into
people's pockets.
. “And so they do. Now, MERCURy the God of Thieving, has his pets,
his piggesnies”—
. (The reader will please to understand, it is our Little Bird that now
sings. The delicate creature is still perched upon the edge of the ink-
bottle; and with one eye upon the bright black pond, turns, its head
towards a sunbeam that slants j above it. Our Little Bird
weaves a silver song, which we undo into the prose of common life;
as soaring larks are sometimes shot for puddings.)
“MERCURY, the God of Thieving, has his pets, his piggesnies. Now,
they who creep into pockets with naked fingers, are rogues to be
whipped and hanged. But they who take and give not in return, may
dip into pockets with safety and with thrift, if—scorning the naked
hand—they wear gloves of parchment.”
Naughty Little Bird!
CATERING FOR THE PUBLIC.
SURELY the public must be the concentrated essence of ingratitude;
for no sooner does a person attempt to cater for the public, than his
attempt at a cater ends in playing the deuce with his own means and
pockets. The fate of poor JULLIEN, at Drury Lane shows the cost of
catering for the public on a scale of liberality. It is true, that some of
his arrangements do seem to have been a little superfluous, and we may
particularly inquire what necessity there could have been for a singing
rompter, in addition to three other prompters, who are all entered on
#. balance-sheet. A . that required so much prompting could
not have been worth much, and as to the singing prompter, we don’t
know what he could have had to do; though, if he combined the accom
lishment of whistling, he might have been engaged expressly to whistle
É. his own and his brother artists' salaries. We see an apologist set
down among the regular members of the company. Considering the
liability of vocalists to colds, catarrhs, and other casualties incidental
to a theatre where salaries are rather irregular, the apologist of a losing
concern must have no sinecure, JULLIEN's apologist must have been
almost black and blue with “throwing himself on a British public”
two or three times a week, and he must have worn half-a-dozen white
waistcoats dirty in one night with placing his hand upon his heart, and
pressing his hat to his shirt front, in token of his sincerity.
We cannot give the Mons credit for the wisdom of º his arrange-
ments, since we find £2000, set down for MADAME DoRus. GRAs, who
only sang a few nights, and who may well have become literally gras
if such has been the usual proportion of salary she has been accustomed
to take from the pockets of a manager.
By the way, we have been utterly lost in admiration at JULLIEN’s heart-
rending exhibition of sensitiveness as to the opinion of his own country-
men, and his declaration that until he has paid every shilling he owes
here, he will never return to France. We hope, for his own sake, he
will never pay, if a liquidation of his debts will send him to Paris; for
we wish no one so wretched a fate as a return to the city of equality,
liberty, and fraternity; but we do think the Mons is a little squeamish
when he expresses his horror at entering France with a few English
liabilities hanging over him, when he remembers that 'spoliation and
repudiation have been popular in Paris for the last five months.
KENSINGTON A PORT.
WE understand that since the Serpentine has been opened as a navi-
gable river for craft varying in tonnage from six stone to a couple of
hundredweight, the project of connecting the marrow tongue of that
ºver with the broadmonth of the Thames, and thus realising the mag-
nificent idea of “Kensington a Port,” is beginning to be entertained by
several enthusiasts. The attempt to bring shipping into the middle of
Warwick, Square, and render the locality a miniature watering-place or
fishing-suburb has, it is true, signally failed; for the canal having been
intended to supply the railway with coals, and the railway having been
constructed to take the superfluous traffic of the canal, these two con-
cerns ended in the awful catastrophe of cutting one another's throats—
the one requiring no coals, and the other having no traffic. It is, how-
..ever, thought that the Serpentine may become a great naval station, and
there is already a talk of placing an Admiral on the spot, with two war-
unts at his disposal, and a skiff of two guns, or six pistols, to carry his
#. whenever he is on duty.
* WHILE every one else has puzzled himself in vain to find out what it
is that really ruins Ireland, our friend the Morning Post has hit the
right nail, on the head., Indeed, a ninny-hammer may be sometimes
quite as likely as any other hammer to succeed in doing so... Our con-
temporary informs us, that, “imprudent marriages” are at the bottom
of all Irish distress, Irish discontent, and Irish, turbulence. The
Morning Post thinks that matrimonial matches are as bad as any Lucifers
for setting the country in a blaze, and he believes, no doubt, that im:
patience of the conjugal yoke causes the people to call out for a repeal
of the Union. Never mind, JENKINs, try again. As a first attempt at
political sagacity the experiment is at least respectable.

tion through the public Press is unbecoming either Service on ordinary
occasions) to rush into your columns, with a charge which, if justice be
equivalent, to tripling any given force, as asserted by SHAkspeaRE
must be irresistible. Qur pay might have been cut down, and
should not have complained—though, what with Mess expenses
and Kit, I find it hard to keep out of debt, as it is. Our allowances
might have been docked; our feathers snipped; six, inches might
have been taken off our bearskin shakos; the adjutant's spurs might
have been shortened; a few fathoms less gold lace on our full-fig
uniforms I would have tolerated. Parades might have been cut
down; marches abbreviated; the term of West India service
diminished; barracks, if possible, made more uncomfortable; all these
loppings and toppings we could have borne—I speak for myself and my
brother officers—but we cannot submit, in silence, to the cur-tailing of
our coat-tails. A sedentary life, which that of the officers of a marching
º must be admitted to be, the absence of occupation, and the
calming influence of routine, and country quarters, necessarily tend to
the increase of flesh. We are, as a body, stout:—so much so indeed,
that the description of us as ‘the stout defenders of our native land,”
must be familiar to all readers of newspapers. Yet our skirts are to be
cut off, by an insidious movement of a certain distinguished personage
upon our rear. The decent undress blue frock, which lent a grace to
portliness, and a concealment to obesity, is to be discontinued, and we
are henceforth, when not in full fig, to appear in shell-jackets! Do
. readers know what a shell-jacket is? It is a scanty garment,
arely reaching the waist!. The humiliation it is calculated to produce
among officers like myself, weighing fifteen stone, or upwards, is
indescribable. As to marching at the head of one's company, from
which position a full view of the officer's back is necessarily com-
manded, I apprehend that will, from the date of the execution of this
order, be absolutely out of the question. It would be alike impossible

A RUN FOR CHANGE.
OMNIBUSOLOGY has been subjected to many changes lately. It has been spared the dreadful
disgrace of the barricades, to which omnibuses in Paris have been obliged to give the weight of
their bodies. They have not assisted, as in other capitals, in driving Ministers from the seat
of affairs. They have always stood up for everything fair, though it has sometimes been a puzzle
for anyone who has not regularly followed the ups and downs of the omnibuses to know precisely
what the fare was. One week it would be stationary at threepence, another it would run up to
fourpence, occasionally it would drop to twopence, till, with the number of changes the public
mind became so agitated, that really we expected nothing less than that MR. CochRANE would
call a public meeting to consider the * of overthrowing the Government, unless they put
the public vehicles on abroader basis. The latest change has been in taking your silver and
keeping it; so, if a
º wants Change
or a Shilling, he is
obliged to run avery
long way before he
can get it. No sooner

twopence, or threepence, or whatever the mighty defalcation may be. e advise all overland
travellers beyond the age of forty, who are easily put out with a trifle, not to leave the steps
before they have paid their fare, for it stands to reason that if a gentleman has any difference
with an Omnibus Conductor, he must be leftfar behind him in the mud. Any intrepid sportsman
who is fond of a splendid run can have one any day by getting out of an omnibus in the Strand,
and, giving the man sixpence. It is capital sport, and excessively cheap for the money,
as the run takes place in the most crowded parts of the City. On Smithfield Market-day
there is nothing like it,

IMPROVE YOUR WINES.
EveRx wine-drinker knows, or pretends to know-which is much the same—that Madeira is
always the better for a few voyages to the East Indies. We have fortunately discovered a way
of preventing the ruinous expense of these journeys, by merely substituting the words “Eastern
Counties” for “East Indies;” and we beg to recommend the dispatching half-a-dozen bottles
of white wine, by the Eastern Counties Railway, to be forwarded from some station by coach,
and we will take a bet that the generous liquor will make seven or eight gratuitous voyages at
least, before it will terminate its itinerant career by delivery into the hands of the individual
to whom it is directed. The º coach is a great vehicle for this kind of improvement; and if
anything once finds its way to the boot of that remarkable turn-out, there is an even chance
that the article will travel twice a day between Brentwood and Ongar for at least afortnight,
Wine is happily improvable by this yagabondising career; but unfortunately fish is so
completely out of its element in the front boot of a two-horse coach, that the sojourn of a salmon
there for even a couple of days, brings no improvement to the ex-native of the deep; but, on
the contrary, militates so much against him, that when weighed in his own scales the deficiency
is obvious. We are afraid that
“Full many a salmon is bought to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness in the Ongar boot.”
And we have, in fact, known an unfortunate jack to have lain there so long neglected, that he
was as dry and as hard as a boot-jack when released from the boot to which the coachman's
oblivion had abandoned him.
A very Knotty Point.
We understand that the opinion of the Attorney-General, has been required by a celebrated
tailor at the East-end, whether, in registering a Paletot, he will experience any difficulty under the
Act for the Registration of Arms, supposing the garment offered for registration happen to
have arms attached to it...We believe that objections have been made by the authorities at
the Paletot Registration Office, on the ground we have stated, and particularly since it has been
stated that these articles are intended to have a “killing effect” when the price reaches thirty
shillings. Those Paletots, at six-and-twenty are merely “stunners,” but the regular assassinators
begin at a sovereign and a half, which is the “figure” at which a difference is made about
the arms being registered,
FORTIFIED POLICEMEN.
THE Police have already received staffs; the next weapon put into their hands was a cutlass,
and the next, it appears, is to be a sword....They are, also, to be instructed in the gentlemanly
art offencing. Bravo! Our brave Police will in time be made a perfect military force: in the
event of a second NApoleon springing out of the ashes of the last French Revolution (the
fortieth already, if we are not wrong), they may be sent abroad to assist at a second Waterloo.
They might be called the London Blues. The regiments quartered, in the metropolis will find
the Police, in time, most dangerous rivals. Their bright, cuirass, will attract the eyes of many
a sensitive cook; whilst their gay moustache, which is indispensable as a military appendage, will
certainly tickle the fancies of all the romantic housemaids. A Field-Marshal will also be wanted
at their head. If so, we could point to an
exalted personage, whose numerous, cam-
paigns, certainly entitle him to that distin-
guished honour. We give the prophetic
portrait of a Policeman as he will be armed,
cap-à-piè, in a few years' time. -
Doesn't he look ferocious? His very ap-
pearance is enough to disperse a mob of ten
thousand peace and window breakers, and
almost sufficient to strike envy, if not awe,
into the stalwart hearts of the Special Con-
stables. -
He only wants spurs and an ALBERT Hat
to complete his ferocity.

NEWS FOR THE ExCURSIONISTs. .
tº,
We perceive by the advertisements, that the Excursionists are not
to be neglected this year in consequence of the virtual blockade of the
Continent against pleasure-seekers; but the steam-packet owners are
beginning to
“Survey mankind with comprehensive view,
And manage trips to China and Peru;”
which are being announced on a scale of unusual liberality. As our
tourists cannot visit France and Italy with much prospect of amuse-
ment, it is suggested to convey them to Pekin, the Arctic Circle, and a
few other distant localities, where it is hoped, instead of proceeding to
the Continent, they may go further without faring worse, which is the
usual penalty of proceeding to extremities.
There is a plan on foot—not to be carried out on foot, by the way—
for chartering a steamer to all the four quarters of the world; and it
is understood that half-an-hour will be allowed for landing at each of
the four in succession. Refreshments will be ready for the arrival of
the steamer, on the principle now adopted at the Railway Stations, and
a policeman will be in attendance to preserve order among the natives.
SATISFACTORY TAXATION.
REALLY some honourable Member of the House of Commons ought
to move for a return of the “Conscience Money” received yearly by
the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER. Scarcely a number of the Times
has of late appeared that has not contained an acknowledgment from
that Minister of the receipt of five, fifteen, or twenty pounds, on ac-
count of the income-tax and other taxes. We reckon that these sums
amount, on a moderate calculation, to about £10 a day, or £3652 10s.
a year—a treasure, one half of which would make many of our wives
and children, happy. The conscientiousness which can be thus parti-
cular in A. its taxes must be something very, much more than
“Oriental scrupulosity,” and must be represented, if there is any truth
in Phrenology, by bumps as big as apple-dumplings. Such virtue might
serve for a definition of the height of honesty. We are now also
enabled to define the height of generosity. The Times lately astounded
us by the following announcement:—
“The ChancELLon of THE Exchequea has received from ‘F.C.” the half of a
note for £100, for the use of Government.”
Actually and gratuitously to tip the Governmentis, we submit, the very
perfection of munificence. e wish the CHANCELLOR OF THE Ex-
CHEQUER would tell us who F.C. is. We will not insinuate that he is a
f. May he not, however, be a decoy-duck? Well, be it so. We hope
e will induce others to follow his example. Who knows but that Govern-
ment is feeling its way towards establishing a 5. fiscal reform? It has
long been desirable to devise a popular mode of raising the revenue.
This is precisely what would be found in a system of voluntary taxation.
We only want more F.C.’s, and the more, we may justly say, the
merrier. How infinitely more pleasant it would be to be taxed to the
extent of our inclination, than beyond that of our ability! Let Govern-
ment, then, throw itself on the bounty of the country—previously
lacing itself in a condition to deserve it by a reduction of expenditure.
e trust that at last there is “a good time coming,” when, we shall
have the i. going round with a hat, and with the gentle
solicitation to bestow a trifle on the Exchequer.

IRISH TACTICS.
MEAGHER of the Sword—who is so far akin to the sword that he
knows how to cut away—gave some truly rational advice to the people
a week or two ago; for he recommended them to imitate the lads of
Limerick, who had first erected barricades and then taken them down
again. The manoeuvre strongly reminds us of that of the
-- six thousand men,”
who, as the poet melodiously tells us,
“Marched up the hill and then marched down again.”
We can fancy the poor Irish dupes setting to work to construct a
barricade, and when it was complete setting to work to take it º: In
conformity with the rebellious principle of undoing all that has been
done, and setting a thing up for no other purpose than the gratification
of knocking it down again. The Limerick Confederates have indeed
given an example of sagacity to the rest of their fellow-countrymen,
which MEAGHER of the Sword very naturally asks them to imitate.
They have, no doubt, had the same truly Hibernian principle in view,
of doing only to undo, when they got up a rebellion merely to get it
down, and made an idol of SMITH O'BRIEN simply to dis-idolise him
when he required their fidelity.
We should not be surprised if, in the event of an outbreak, they
should practise on each other's heads, and act as policemen against
themselves, by cracking the skulls of one another.
Military Changes.
THE present Commander-in-Chief has been ably represented by a
pair of Wellington boots. The next, we are told, will be nicely taken
off by a pair of Albert shoes.
DREADFUL SUPERSTITION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
THERE is a Member in the House of Commons who really believes
that MR. SMITH O'BRIEN is in possession of his senses. It is but right
to state, however, that the gentleman who nourishes this belief is only
a Protectionist. His friends have long been looking after him.

CoCKNEY tourists must know that Sheerness and
Southend are the two pillars of the Thames., Southend
is a beautiful downy pillow, lying at the head of a lovely
bed of oysters, which, with the shrimps, give the lazy
incumbents that resort here the most delightful tuck in.
Sheerness and Southend are both at the mouth of
the Thames; so that if the mouths of rivers were fur-
nished like those of men, Southend would be one of its
front teeth.
To find it—which is no such easy voyage of discovery
–you must start from London Bridge and take the first
turning on the left. When you get there, anybody will
direct you.
There are many peculiarities to be picked up at South-
end. Its greatest is its size. It may boast of being not
only the º: in point of situation, but
the first also in point of littleness; for, after all, it is
very little bigger than a point. No point could be suffi-
..". small to express it on the map. It would be
best described by being left out altogether. Its nearest
size, I should say, would be that one which we often
hear of... but rarely see, popularly called “next to
nothing.” To enjoy the town—to take it all in-you
should look at it under a microscope. It would not

Guy's Geography, I should speak of it as:
“A fishing-town of ten souls, almost invisible to the

clear day, by the aid of one of DolloND's strongest
telescopes.”
I advise all travellers of weak sight, when they land,
to call out “Waiter!” when a gentleman with a napkin

assistance of visitors, who otherwise would never be
able to find the town again when once they had left it
after dark. The postman passes the spot repeatedly
without, being aware of it, and letters are frequently
carried back to London with the libellous inscription,
“No such place to be found.”
The inhabitants are so few, that there is a legend,
that when they had occasion once to shout for the
QUEEN, they were obliged to send over to Sheerness to
“lend them half-a-dozen voices,” before they could raise
a single “Hip—hip—hurrah!”
The longest peculiarity of Southend is by far its pier.
It is a good day's walk from one extremity to the other.
A railway might be laid down, at a very trifling expense,
if there was only traffic sufficient to pay for the coals
that would necessarily be consumed to work the engines.

I N FR E S H AND SALT WATE R.
BY THE BUOY AT THE NORE.
This pier is nearly the length of all
the London Bridges put together:
even then, I think, it would require
the Houses of Farliament, or one of
MR. ANSTEy's speeches, to make up
the difference. There ought to be a
cab-stand at each terminus. Instances
daily occur of a husband being at one
end and a wife at the other, and their
never seeing one another for hours.
* It may be for this reason that it is so
often made a place of appointment
with married couples; the distance
lending (not the only distance, that
lending frequently leads to ) probably
the greatest enchantment to the view.
Woe to , the traveller that is five
minutes late for the steamboat Un-
less he has the Seven League Boots, he must stop at Southend
another day. By-the-bye, they might easily establish an electric
telegraph. I really pitied a poor servant, that was sent out
“to tell master dinner was ready.” Master, at the time, happened
to be at the ſº head. It was full two hours before that wearied
maid returned! . .
Couldn't something be done to reduce this pier a few of its
unfair proportions? I am aware, with what reverence a peer is
looked upon in England, but still this one might be cut down
without going between the wind and anybody's nobility. It might
be constructed on the principle of a telescope, to slide in and out,
according as it was high or low water. This would come to the
same thing in the end: it would only be several piers merged into
one. I hope no one will accuse me of wishing to pull up or
weaken one of the strongest institutions of our beloved country;
for no one in his time has been more indebted to the pierage of
England than myself, and the way in which I always cling to them
must prove my attachment to such a national stronghold. Their
value, I can tell you, is best proved in a storm.
Another peculiarity of Southend is its extreme quiet. . This may
partly arise from there being no one to make a noise; but I half
suspect it is strictly forbidden for any one to laugh or cough. I
certainly never heard a single sneeze the whole time I lodged there,
and, as I missed the steamer exactly seven times, I was at that
marine abode of silence exactly a week. I only got away at last
by sleeping all night at the top of the pier, with a tarpauline (that
had the strongest perfume of pitch I ever inhaled) for my counter-
pane, and a carpet-bag, (that was full of boots, unfortunately) for
my pillow. There is, however, a strong natural sleepiness that
hangs over the five houses. The inhabitants, too, seemed as if they
were practising to be somnambulists. ... I never heard them speak-
I suppose they do occasionally—but they looked uncommonly like
a set of deaf and dumb people that had come out to have a .
good holiday. I had occasion to whistle once, and ten windows
were instantly thrown up to see what was the noise. The wind
is the only thing that takes the liberty of making itself heard, and
then it is only in the softest whispers. When the bells were ringing
they reminded me of muffin-bells I have heard off London on avery
foggy night. The crier came round; but, poor fellow, he must
have had a sore throat, for I couldn't hear a word he mumbled.
I sent him, the next morning, a box of voice lozenges, but in the
afternoon he was no better, for he had to announce “A copy of
last week's Times has just arrived,” and it sounded more, like the
noise of a strong blue-bottle that was :* his head against
the window in the vain endeavour of ...i through it, than any
thing human or articulate. He tried to speak up when he saw me,
but his words, from long habit probably, preferred remaining in his
throat, and they certainly did. Not one of them stirred out that
day. I doubt if Universal Suffrage even would give that man a
Wolce.
There are more peculiarities about Southend. The Shrubbery is
one; it is a stupendous maze, and beats Rosherville and Hampton
Court hollow. It is constructed apparently to enable nurses to lose
the young children intrusted to their charge. It may have another
view, for I noticed that the bathing-machines were just opposite;
if so, other sea-towns (Ramsgate for one) would preserve the
“decencies of life” all the better if they took a leaf or two out of
that Shrubbery. Another peculiarity is the saltwater; º bucket,
I believe, contains a whole grain of saline matter; but that grain
must be a very homoeopathic one,—so infinitesimal, that it must
be a difficulty to see it, like the grain of sense which peºple who
crowd a thousand in a steam-boat are said to possess. The next

THE SLANDERED ARMY TAILORS.
AFTER all, it appears that the Goose that invented the shell-jacket
for officers, was not the Tailor’s. “A Military Tailor,” in a letter to
the Times, thus vindicates the taste of his fraternity:-
“As to the tailors being blameable for the alterations that may occur, I deny the
soft impeachment. They are tabooed at the Horse Guards; and the only trades-
man who is ever consulted there, is not a tailor, which perhaps accounts for the
incongruities that are committed.”
We congratulate our ninth of a military man on the skill with which
he plies the needle of sarcasm. We protest that we fear, he will cut
out our very selves. In a passage no less admirable for its aesthetics
than its practicality, he proceeds:-
“Any tailor with correct motions of taste or utility, would not dress a stoutman
in a short jacket, or send a man of any size to Canada, in one.”
This perception of the Fit, in relation to the Fat, and of the Com-
fortable in connexion with the Chilly, is worthy of a transcendentalist:
Our tailor—for he shall be our tailor—thus concludes, with a dignified
burst of professional feeling:-
“No, Sir, I flatter myself that when the authorities condescend to consult the
tailors and act on their advice, the officers of the army will no longer be the
laughing-stock of the multitude, or the victims of a tasteless irresponsibility.”
Bravo! We really sympathise with this good Knight of the Thimble
in his jealousy for the fame of his Order. We admire his chivalry in
defending it. For standing up thus gallantly for his cloth, we give
him all credit, and when we employ him, we hope he will reciprocate
our liberality,
Our Indian Arrivals.
By the last mail from India, we had consigned to us a smallpackage
of Puns from the Punjaub. We beg to inform the person.sending
them, that as the carriage is charged by weight, we have refused to

and though we understand from our Correspondent, that he has several
times had these puns on the tip of his tongue, we do not feel ourselves
strong enough to attempt to bear the burden.
Apology for Smith o'Brien.
THE courage of MR. SMITH O'BRIEN, in slinking, under the fire of
the police at Boulagh Common, among the cabbages in Widow CoR-
Mack's garden, maybe questioned; but it is to be remembered that the
hero, if he creptout of the way of the bullets, betrayed no fear of the slugs.

Tussaud's, which is almost the only place in which
Royalty can be met within a satisfactory condition.
In Baker Street, at least, the crowned heads of
Europe are secure, and allegiance may be paid-
together with one shilling, the price of admission-
at the waxen courts of most of the sovereigns.
MADAMETussaud has not yet established Repub-
licanism, in her Bazaar, and we believe she even
contemplates offering an asylum to some of the
dethroned kings, for whom she will provide crowns
and sceptres quite equal to the legitimate insignia,
and robes superior to their own, on condition of
their holding levees from ten till dusk, and drawing-
rooms in the evening, with a military band, which
Madame Tussaud will provide from eight until
eleven. The excellent Pope Pius is much firmer
on his sacerdotal music-stool in Baker Street, than
on his pontifical chair at the Vatican. If here should be an extensive
emigration of crowned heads, they will feel themselves thoroughly
at home at MADAME Tussaud's establishment.

Compliment to the Seditionists.
Punch is desired by several influential members of the Aristocracy to
present their compliments to the Physical Force Chartists, and to thank
them for so engrossing the public mind with the fear of revolution, as
to distract it from the pursuit of so-called moderate reform; such as
any extension of the franchise, revision of taxation, interference with
the Game Laws, abolition of sinecures, amendment of the law, reduction
of expenditure, adjustment of Church property, or any ºther alteration
in the established order of things. Punch has anything but pleasure in

“HOW HAPPY THE SOLDIER!”
THE felicity of the soldier, who, it was alleged, “lived
on his pay, and spent half-a-crown out of sixpence a day,”
| could have been nothing to the truly Elysian happiness of the
Ensignin the Army, who, out of a diurnal stipend of five and
threepence, manages to expend some six or seven hundred
ounds per annum. We dare say it adds greatly to the
ravery of the British soldier to be compelled to wade
through, an expense of many pºunds, with such, miserable
odds in his favour as a few odd shillings. He must be pretty
well accustomed to meet the enemy's charge—we mean his
tailor’s bill—with resources utterly unequal, to the emer-
ency; and in the battle he has to fight with his bills, he
eaves them no alternative but to run, while he looks them
in the face with marvellous audacity. How highly, we
ought to think of the Ensign's boldness when we find him
putting his five and threepence a day against such a perfect
volley of charges as the following:-

giving his companions the benefit of his precautionary measures. His
own retreat into the cabbage-bed was understood to have been chiefly
dictated by the hope that, having lost heart, he might succeedin finding
heart among the vegetables that afforded him such timely shelter. He
had purposed intrenching a i. of his followers in the trenches of
some cºlºry, and he contemplated planting his cavalry appropriately in a
grove of horse-radish. A select cohort of Tipperary boys were to have jain
in ambush in some gooseberry-bushes, in order that their courage might
have been pricked º: and part of the force was to have bivouacked in
a comfortable bed of parsley. The Saxon minions on their first approach
were to have been surprised from a mignionette-box, in which a few of
SMITH O'BRIEN’s immediate followers were to have been conceale
and the drums would have beat from the beet-root bed on the arrival o

DRAMATIC LIFE INSURANCE OFFICE.
We understand that aparty of gentlemen, connected with the business
of Dramatic Authorship, have resolved on forming an Association for
Insuring the Lives of all New Pieces, and guaranteeing a certain sum of
money to those interested in their welfare, in the event of the new pieces
.# prematurely jº ſº unceremoniously damned. The
object of the Association e to protect the owners of this kind of
property against loss and ruin, from accident, either by hissing, yawning
or other causes that are likely to prove fatal to a drama; and a graduated
scale of premiums, commensurate with the risk incurred, has already
been prepared. Translations will be considered doubly hazardous; and
it has been determined by the Directors to grant no policy in favour of
any F. in which the very dangerous practice of firing is carried on ;
for the constant fire that must be kept up in order to work this branch
of the dramatic business with effect, is believed to be a source of con-
tinual danger, by which the whole thing may at any moment explode.
It is in contemplation to establish a sort of brigade of claqueurs in con-
nection with the Insurance Office, who will be instructed to give the
alarm at the *...". of danger, when all hands will be expected
to go to work; several º: belonging to the press will,be
attached to the Company, with the view of insuring all pieces insured
in the office against untoward accidents.
. In order to meet the views of individual actors or actresses interested
in particular parts of a dramatic production, but regardless of its fate
as a whole, calculations have been made by which an insurance may be
effected on a single scene, or a single part, or in some cases even upon
a single speech, if the success of a part may be thought to depend upon
it. Blank verse may be insured in quantities of not less than a hundred
lines, and in some instances jokes will be accepted for insurance; but
the policy will be high in proportion to their age, and nothing more
advanced in years than Joe º: can possibly be dealt with.
TROOPS AT EVERTON.
We have seen with considerable surprise the announcement of the
formation of a camp at Everton. Our |. feelings have experienced
a severe shock from this startling intelligence. , Everton is associated in
our minds with everything sweet, and we shudder at the possibility of
the Toffey districts being proclaimed. -
There has been a rumour of a rising among the hard-bake population,
and five hundred bullets, disguised as brandy-balls, have been seized by the
police, as well as a million squibs, which upon having the outer coating
sucked off from them, have turned out to be made of explosive materials.
Something has been said about drilling in this quarter, and the forma-
tion of squares; but we have ascertained that the formation of squares
ls a very less practice, with reference to hard-bake, to which the
process has been limited.
M O DE L C L E RKS.
HE LAwyER's CLERK enters the office
at nine, and leaves at eight. His only
holiday is when he is sent into the
country to serve a writ. He has a
“fine bold hand,” and can “fair copy”
two brief sheets an hour. He does not
throw up his salary because he is too
proud to engross skins of parchment;
on the contrary, he has a pair of false
sleeves (like umbrella-cases) for the
purpose. He, knows exactly the legal
price of everything, from a savage assault
to a breach of P. of marriage.
He is not fond of taxing, and is ready
to cry if not allowed his “Letters and
essengers” every Term. His great
delight in an action is to ... costs.”
He then shows the admirable system
of “the office” by proving in how
short a time a long bill can be made
out, sent in, execution served, with
- the sheriff's sale, if not paid within
a fortnight. . He has no patience, with, people who come, to beg
for time—he is very sorry, he has but one duty to perform. That duty
is invariably an appointment with the obsequious 3. DoE, made by
HER GRAcious MAJESTY at the Court of Exchequer, or some other place
of amusement. He does not read novels during office hours, nor roast
chesnuts, nor apples, nor act plays, nor toss for beer, nor learn “The
Wolf,” or any song, comic or dreary, when “the Governor” is out.
His soul is in his master's pocket, and he always appeals, or has a
rejoinder ready, or a new bill on the file, if the client can only afford it.
His cry, like DEMosTHENES', is always “Action, action, action,” and in
his opinion the best reward a good action can have is a Chancery suit.
He is cautious as he is zealous—keeps a copy of every letter, almost
dislikes saying, “How d'ye do” without a witness, has a horror of

imensions of 13s. 4d. He would blush to take any of the office º:
home with him. He understands perfectly when a client has called to
complain of delay; in which case, “MB. HookHAM has always, just
stepped out—he believes, it is to move in your very suit.” He takes
but half-an-hour for his dinner, and only allows himself ten minutes for
his tea. When he serves you with a writ, he hopes “you will not be
offended—it is his most painful duty.” The same with a distress: he
throws a cloak of politeness over every step that gradually leads a man
from a lawyer's office to the Queen's Bench. By half-starving, the
strongest self-denial, little agencies from friends he has recommended to
the office, and the Christmas Boxes of a long range of years, he saves a
hundred pounds, and, working upon half salary in lieu of a um
gets articled to his master. However, the County Courts Hº:
a fine profession, and Loan BRough AM has so cut down the profits of
the Law to scarcely a herring a-day, that he is obliged to come,back
and occupy the same stool he has ſº grey upon during his clerkhood.
He buries all ambition in his “pad,” takes to copying after officehours,
in order to gain a few pounds, when his fingers can no longer hold a pen
and ultimately resigns his desk to some young man, who, like himself,
with a strong constitution, and probably a generous heart, sells himself
to lose both, for the matter of eighteen shillings (and “a rise") as |
a LAwYER's CLERK.
THE RAILway CLERK dresses smartly.
He is a friend of a Director, or the cousin
of a large Shareholder. Business with
him is quite a secondary consideration.
He opens his little trap-door five minutes
before the train, and closes it the minute
the clock has struck. He will take your
money if you want a ticket, but mind, he
is not answerable for any mistake. He
has no time to count change, or answer
questions about trains, or attend to stupid
people who come inquiring about the
persons who were killed by yesterday's
accident. It is not his business. He
cannot attend to every one at once, and
he runs his diamond fingers through his
rich, Macassared hair. It’s really no fault
of his if you lose the train—you ought to
have come sooner; and then he whips off,
with a very pretty penknife, a sharp
cormer that pains the *"...# of one of
his filbert mails. What should he know "
about dogs?—you had better inquire at
the luggage train. You can write to the newspapers by all means,
if you like: the newspapers don’t pay him. The parcels are not
in his department—the porters perhaps can tell. He is very sorry
he has no change for a five pound note-he has no doubt you can
get it round the corner. e yawns all the morning—his eyes are
only half open at eight o'clock, and his white, waistcoat betrays his
dreadful impatience to get to the Opera," as the time draws slowly
towards the mail train. hat he does between the dreary intervals, as
we cannot peep over the walls of mahogany into the small circle of his
duties, we cannot tell. On a Sunday, however, his usual amiability
deserts him. His cambric shirt is beautifully smooth, but his temper
is sadly ruffled. The Excursions upset him. The number of absurd
questions annoy him. He wonders how people can be so foolish, and at
last makesaresolution not to answer anymore inquiries; and the Railway
Clerk knows his own º too well not to keep it. He becomes as
silent as a Government Surveyor's Report over a “Dreadful Collision.”
He only stares; but occasionally troubles himself to the utmost of his
abilities to give anod that may express “Yes” or “No,”just as the person
leases. Beyond this, the Railway Clerk is as obliging as most Clerks, and
e has thisadvantage, that he is very good-looking, and after coming out of
an omnibus on a wet day, is quite pleasant to look at. In the heat of sum:
merhelooks cool—in the depths of winter he always appears warm and
comfortable. He is really a pattern of politeness to ladies, and smiles
most condescendingly to pretty girls, displaying his gallantry and white
teeth in a thousand little ways. He was evidently intended by Nature
as an ornament to a tea-party, or born to grace a pic-nic. The only pity
is, that his friends ever made him a RAILWAY CLERK.

THE NEW SCHOOL OF SMUGGLERS.

THE days of Romance are certainly as extinct as the deys of Algiers,
and even smugglers have degenerated, from the WILL WATCHEs of
former times, to the lowest of itinerant Israelites. Smuggling has
enlarged its area by the adoption of the common herd of area sneaks
into its once gallant fraternity. Piracy has left the sea, familiarly
known as “the blue, the fresh, the ever free,” to settle on the scum of
the literary world, and smuggling has been abandoned by the gallant,
though lawless, sons of the ocean, to be taken up by the fraudulent
crew of pedlars and hawkers, who look down into kitchens and up into
attics, for the victims of a misplaced confidence... We recollect the time
when a smuggler º: himself to our imagination as a magnificent
villain, with black fringe for ringlets, a night-cap slashed with red
worsted, like the chimney of the City of Çanterbury steamboat, a belt of
patent leather ten inches in breadth, a pistol in each hand, a pair in his
girdle, and a sword in his mouth—to realise the ferocious allegory of
“armed to the teeth”—and a white petticoat sown up the centre, by
way of trousers, with a pair of pumps adorned by paste shoe-buckles,
and equally adapted for skipping about in terrific combats or naval horn-
pipes; for the smuggler was half Tar half Tar-tar in our early days,
when T. P. Cooke and TERRY were the representatives of the British
Navy at the Adelphi, and the Battle of Trafalgar might be seen every
night at half-price, including a beautiful tableau of Loºp Nelson dying
in the arms of three supernumeraries, “expecting every man to do his
duty,” and execrating the carpenters, sotto roce, for º: down the
curtain in time to release him from his uncomfortable attitude.
The Smuggler is . quite another creature now from what he
was then, and his smuggling seems to consist of the very superfluous
labour of importing as contraband those goods which are not liable to
the smallest, amount of duty. He will, for instance, be as mysterious
over, a palpably British worsted comforter, value 9d, as if he had
unrolled it from the throat of an outlandish Mufti, swam with it in his
mouth from the Eastern Archipelago to Wapping Old Stairs, and suffo.
gated, the custom-house officer by cramming it half-way down his throat
in order to avoid the payment of duty.
If we are to put faith, in the hawkers, every one of the craft is a
smuggler in disguise, and every article they offer for sale has been
landed from some distant port, in defiance of the coast guard, or by the
bribery of all the custom-house authorities. The cheroot, cabbaged from
an adjacent cabbage-garden, has been conveyed in a pencil-case all the
way from Havannah, and the calico at 2%d. per yard, was stripped from
the back of a dancing dervise, and pocketed by a Carib chief, who gave
it to the hawker in exchange for a tenpenny-mail, a glass bead, a bottle
of Bass's ale, and a kitchen-poker.
The handkerchief offered at half-a-crown, and perhaps pilfered from
sºme rural hedge, in an adjoining village, is, if we are to believe the
Hawker Smuggler, the identical handkerchief thrown last year by the
Sultan to his favourite Sultana, and picked up by the party now in
º who got into the Harem disguised as one of the eunuchs,
or no other purpose than to select his stock of Eastern goods, in order
to give an extensive choice to his British customers.
The splendid shawl at 2s. 9d. was the turban seized from the head of
a turbaned Turk, who had been bonnetted first and robbed afterwards
of his head-gear, when he had become too stupid and confused to
rotect himself; and the catskin muff was of course purchased of a
§ whose appetite for rum-shrub had enabled the hawker to effect
an exchange on such terms that the muff might be “put in” at three
half-crowns to an English purchaser.
We hope that the enlightenment we have given to the world on the
subject of the Smuggled Goods Dodge will have its effect, and that
the parvenu smugglers will find, the police, have such an eye to duty,
º: * ºve drawback may be imposed upon the trade in alleged
contradauci.
MORE ARCHAEOLOGY.
THE Archæologists areat it again, and have been riding their hobbies,
rolling about their barrows, tumbling over their tumuli, and rubbing
up their monumental brasses, with more than their usual energy. We
last heard of them at Lincoln, where they mounted a dead wall, and,
sticking to it like bricks, declared it to be the relic of the “Old Mint
of Lincoln.” It is usually a sign of weakness to fly to the wall * but
the Archæologists were in great force, and E. Hawkins, Esq., “read
a paper upon the wall;" his brother members sitting, of course, upon
the wall to support and encourage him. He went into the wall brick
by brick; dwelt forcibly on the buttress; revelled among the mortar;
and hanging upon the coping with affectionate tenacity.
He followed the cement from the lime-kiln to the hod; he handled
cleverly the clay that gave the material for the foundations; and then,
taking a rapid glance at walls in i. he touched lighi on the
Great Wall of China; passed gracefully over the walls of the Colosseum
and came playfully down upon Blackwall with a pun that shook the old
wall of the Mint of Lincoln with the laughter of his audience. He
then proceeded to a digression on wall-fruit, and went cleverly into the
peach, which he laid open with such effect, that in his mouth the peach
seemed to be a different thing from what it appeared before he set his
tongue and his jaw in motion, to show what might be done with it.
After the paper on the wall was concluded—a paper by which, if
walls have ears, the subject of the discourse must have been greatly
edified—an energetic Archæologian insisted on reading a paper about
“The family of the Dymocks,” which might have been very interest-
ing if MR. and MRs. Dymock, or any of the little Dymocks, had
been there to hear it; but as this was not the case, the audience stole
away by degrees, and the surant was for some time holding forth alone
on." The family of the Dymocks,” until a rustic, voice, exclaiming,
“Holloa'ſ you º: come down off that there wall,” induced him tº
look around, and led to his discovery of his loneliness. By way of
atifying the Archæologian, who had inquired if there was any barrow
in the neighbourhood, he was wheeled home in what was supposed to
be his favourite vehicle; and, his remonstrances being set down to the
score of modesty, were of course wholly disregarded.
A Polite Inquiry.
THE Session is fast wearing out. Before it is completely threadbare,
may we venture to ask, without wishing to be in the least impertinent,
if Lord John intends to do anything? Our friend, MRs. CHIck, unites |
with us in imploring him to “make an effort.” She says she is sure
he would soon get over his difficulties “if he, poor fellow, would
only make an effort.” We hope he will, but don't expect it.

THE IRISH ABD-EL-KADER.
ET us hope SMITH O'BRIEN will be taken before
these remarks fall into the public hands, or
rather get into the public eye; for if he is
not captured, we shall begin to look upon
SMITH O'BRIEN as a sort of ABD-EL-KADER
whom everybody sees, but nobody seizes.
Every day last week brought accounts of his
having walked up to, parleyed with, and walked
away from the very persons who were in pursuit
of him, and to whom it never occurred that it
N would have been as well to have collared him
|\ at once, instead of indulging in small talk.
The whole business has been beautifully Irish;
for when SMITH O'BRIEN and the authorities
have met, the latter have usually considered
themselves the obliged parties by being allowed
... to go about their business; and the former
has made quite a merit of civilly permitting them to depart without
opposition. He has been walking up to officers and others, with
pistols in his hand, and walking off again as coolly as possible, while
on other occasions he has been equally potent, with no other weapon
than a º At one p he seems not merely to have
deliberately bid his pursuers good bye, but to have helped himself
to one of their horses in order to accelerate his departure, while
the police . looked on and allowed him to evaporate.
e wonder that the Inspector did not send one of his men to call a
cab for SMITH O'BRIEN, to convey him to the nearest railway station,
and enable him to make good his retreat with the utmost speed; or fetch
him a Bradshaw, that he might take his choice of routes, and select the
one that would most effectually baffle his pursuers. One would think
that the book of etiquette, rather than the Articles of War or the Govern-
ment Proclamations, had been the guide adopted by the authorities in
their dealings with ‘Mr. Swith Ö'Brien; it has been a sort of "how
d’ye do,” and “good bye.” between him and the soldiery, whenever
they have come into each other's presence. A little dialogue
occasionally ensued, in the course of which the officer in command has
given his word of honour that he has had no warrant to arrest SMITH
O'BRIEN; and, after a few further exchanges of courtesies, the interview
has usually ended by the parties walking off in opposite directions.
THE CHEAP SHIRT MARKET.
It is a golden rule, doubtless, to buy in the cheapest market. But
the cheapest market is sometimes a foul place. The cheapest sugar is
that which is slave-grown. The cheapest fire-irons are to be had at the
marine store keeper's. The cheapest linen is purchased at the slop-
shop—at what cost let us see. recent police report in the Times
informs us that, at Lambeth-
“EMMA Mouxsen, a wretched-looking woman, but who, from her manner, had
evidently seen much better days, was brought up for final examination, before Ma.
Noaron, on the charge of unlawfully pawning seventeen shirts, the property of
MEssas. Moses and SoN, Aldgate. . . . The prisoner did not deny pawning the
shirts, but said she had been driven to the act by sheer necessity. Her husband,
who was a printer, she said was out of employment, as well as her son and her
daughter, and all, at this particular time, were dependent on the wretched pittance
which she made by shirt-making.”
It may seem a difficult task to feed four mouths with a needle, yet
that of EMMA MoUNSER might have served as a fork to administer the
food which it earned. MR. Norton inquired of the accused—
“What were you paid for making these shirts **
“Prisoner.—2s. 6d. a dozen, your Worship, or 24d. apiece.”
" Now, to support herself and family at this rate, EMMA MoUNSER
must have possessed the productiveness of a steam-engine, and even
then her frame—albeit of iron—would have been overworked. But,
the magistrate asking how much she had been able to earn a day at
such work—
“The prisoner replied that the utmost she could do in the day was to make two
shirts, and deducting from them the price of the thread, cotton, and needles, all of
which she was to find herself, she could not make more than 4d. a day.”
She was, then, . ired to make shirts, and, out of her destitution,
to supply the thread., There was a certain monarch who obliged his
subjects to make bricks, and gave them no straw. Is it necessary that
we should mention this historical fact to Moses? But Moses, it must
in fairness be remembered, is a seller as well as a buyer in the chea
market. A clerk in the Aldgate establishment was in attendance, an
MR. Norton demanded of him what were the prices of the shirts thus
economically produced?—
one The rº” to said the wholesale price was twelve shillings a dozen, or
..So the work of each shirt costs 2}d, and the article sells at 1s.; the
difference between which sums is ğd, subject to a certain deduction
for materials. We are left to wonder what stuff such shirts are made of,
and till we know we cannot tell what the vender gets, and are unable to
say what he deserves... It is not, we are happy to say, our intention to
deal with him, but with his customers. The clerk, to his foregoing
statement, added that—
“The competition in such business was so great that his employers, Mºssas. Moses
AND Sox, could not afford to pay more than the present rate.”
It is the purchaser, therefore, rather than the seller of cheap shirts,
that is the task-master, the PHARAOH, of such as EMMA MoUNSER. These
are the gentlemen who save in linen, to the starvation, demoralisation,
and destruction of needle-women. Such trifling considerations cannot
be expected to arrest them in rushing to the Cheap Clothes Mart. It
is, nevertheless, in their power to plunge into a yet lower depth of
parsimony. e organisation of stinginess would enable them. to
procure shirts at º: still more ridiculous. By judicious combination
they might grind the shirt-makers without the intervention of a
middle-man. There was once, a Society, called the Dirty Shirt Club.
º: they form an Association with that truly appropriate epithet,
In the meantime, those who would unite comfort-of conscience as well
as of back-with economy, will, perhaps, avoid the slop-shop, employ
their own workwomen, and pay them decently; their shirts neither
pinching them, nor they the shirt-maker.
EMIGRATION FOR THE UPPER CLASSES.
ºil.
º Fº
ºTº
Bºº
THE Lords have been complaining bitterly of having nothing to do
in their own House, in consequence of the little work that has been cut
out for them this Session by the Commons. LoRD BROUGHAM has
done his utmost to find a vent for his superfluous, energy, and has
been trying Legal Reform as a safety-valve, though without much effect,
for he has been almost constantly on the fiz and fume without bein
able to go a-head by the aid of his vapour., We recommend their Lord-
ships to try emigration, the great remedy of the dº which, during
the recess, they might resort to very beneficially. They have been
lately merely dummies in the game of life; but if they were to suit
themselves with spades, they might turn up regular trumps in some
distant colony. e do not recommend permanent expatriation to the
peers; but after the ennui of this do-nothing Session, we are sure they
might find both health and amusement abroad, in the exercise of a
i. manual labour. ;
APOLOGY FOR THE SHELL-JACKET.
Much as the shell-jacket may be objected to as a disfigurement to
the British officer, it is, unquestionably, an excellent, coat for action;
as the wearer will certainly never show the enemy his back.

PARIS CLUBS IN LONDON.
ERILY, the Clubs may be abolished in Paris, but
there’s no shutting one's ears to the fact that
they exist with equal fury in London. They
have taken refuge in the coffee-shops, and the
different restaurateurs about Leicester Square.
Enter any of the cafés, where the long-beards
most do congregate, and try to get through a
newspaper. A hundred voices, each shouting
its loudest, soon makes nonsense of the ver
best Leader. The noise completely ruins all
attempt at reading. It is a perfect Babel
de Paris. It gives you a faint motion what
the National Assembly must be. Every
Frenchman is talking at once. In vain is
and the arguments wax so warm, that you
imagine every minute they can only be settled
by blows. There is generally a representative
§ every class of opinion. HENRY W. (that
never was, and never is to be) finds his champion, in some closely-
cropped enthusiast, and the réactionaires prophesy all sorts of revolu-
tions yet to come.
to the din; and they talk so earnestly and confidently, that you are per-
suaded they must be, at least, GUIzot, or Louis, NAPOLEoN, or JöIN-
VILLE, in disguise. Communism even has its rabid oracles, and they
are generally of the loudest. On one of our visits we heard one prophet
declare that “all goods ought to be equally divided;” and certainly his
system had one advantage, for, judging from his appearance, he could
not possibly be a great sufferer by it himself...We involuntarily shifted
our quarters to the other end of the room. His denunciations made us
tremble for the safety of our breakfast; for we naturally expected that
he would begin sharing our ham and *::: and helping himself to half
our tea, as a simple matter of right. He was very mild, however; a
perfect DANTON in speech, but a gentle B£RANGER in demeanour. He
wished the room “Bon jour,” with all the amiability of a “bon enfant,”
and walked out with his own umbrella.
There was one Republican, who, we confess, somewhat alarmed us.
We do not know whether he belonged to the Social Republic, or to the
Democratic, or to the Red or White, Tricolor, Purple, Green, or to
what particular shade of the numerous series of polychromatic Republics.
Suffice it to say, he startled us, by loudly asserting that—“All property
was a theft.” We had a sovereign at the time (we º: no one will
think us proud) in our pocket, and felt very uneasy lest this mad
disciple of Mons. PROUDHoN should denounce us as a public robber,
A certain panic was created, also, in the room. Coats were buttoned
up, and several of the most timid asked *H suddenly “what they
had to pay.” . We did not linger long. The discussion was very
interesting at first, from its peculiarity; but the novelty soon lost its
charm when we discovered that two of the apostles entertained such
very peculiar opinions. We left the place in safety, though the latter
gentleman followed us down stairs, with no other intention, as we
thought, than that of tearing the coat off our back, and carrying off
our diamond pin, if only to prove his favourite theory that “all property
was a theft.” We are weak enough to confess we should not like to
lodge in the same house with that man!
We passed the café at 11 o'clock at night, and they were still speaking
all together, in the same loud strain as when they spoilt our breakfast.
Now we like to read the morning newspapers quietly by ourselves. It
is the enjoyment with which we always open the day; but we defy
any one to tell what the Funds are, or to make out a single word of last
night's interesting debate, whilst fifty, clamorous Frenchmen are
throwing into your ears such horrible truths, as that all “goods ought
to be equally divided,” and that “property is nothing better than a
theft.” Admirable laws these, doubtless, for a nation of pickpockets, of
which Newgate was the capital, but scarcely adapted for industrious
persons, who have yet to learn that meum and tuum mean exactly the
same º whether in French or in English. These wild &migrés of the
Parisian Clubs should have a room to themselves. In the meantime,
we only say, “Landlords, look to your spoons.”
* -
The King of Munster and the Coal-Hole.
THERE, is something very remarkable in the affection evinced by
SMITH Q'BRIEN for coals and coal-holes, which have been associated,
more or less, with the whole of his political career. If he should ever
come to the throne of Munster, and wear the Irish crown, they wi
assuredly be nothing but black diamonds that will sparkle in his diadem.
It would seem as if he was always looking amongst the coal-cellars for
fuel to feed the flame of rebellion, from the time when he was let down
as a martyr into the coal-hole of the Commons to the present moment,
silence implored; the discussion still continues,
Royalists, Legitimists, Bonapartists, all contribute |
These discussions are continued, it seems, upon une séance permanente.

when he is supposed to be sneaking about the coal-pits of Ballingarry,
under the protection of the Irish Black-boys. As the would-be suc-
cessor of Guy FAUx, SMITH O'BRIEN must feel himself at home in the
cellar, though he does not much relish the determination of the
Government to haul him over the coals. º

trusting to the ears of barley sent up to us as specimens, or relyi

lating lava of his ridicule. But, how! by what keen sleight of sorcery has the
mighty wizard achieved his spell ? I will tell you; he has conjured up the assump-
tion that soldiership and brigandism are mere synonymes; and, with this for his suffi-
ciently spacious basis, he fails to see upon what score of propriety lovely woman
should grace us with her august presence, and deign with her snow-white hands to
commit the banner of war to the brave spirits who defend her in peace and purity!”
No, Colonel, no. Let Punch explain. He make true soldiership and
brigandism “synonymous !” Never. May his grey goose-quill turn the
whitest and most recreant feather, could he defile foolscap with such a
thought!, Punch takes off his hat, and bows—reverently bows—to the
heroism, the endurance of human nature, tested in the terrible crucible
of war. Punch honours the valour of the soldier; but Punch hopes for
the day, when all men of all nations will denounce MARs as a curse, and
not cocker up the bully, dress him, fondle him, and call him all sorts of
É. sugared names, to make the Ogre of the world pass for its
eneficent guardian spirit. Punch will continually use, his ink where-
with to water the olive; but whilst he does this, he will give all honour
to the men who, in the field of º gather the blood-stained laurel.
As for the “snow-white hands” of woman; bless them, if they must
minister to glory, their best employment is to pick lint for the wounded,
and not to pat “the dogs of war” to slaughter. If women, are to

The editor of the Telegraph says, CoLoREL SHAw’s “allusion to the
satirical comments of Punch upon the presentation of colours, cannot
fail to be appreciated.”...Very true. Punch appreciates them; and—we
are sure the Colonel will confess as much—has duly chronicled them.
Instinct in Grouse.
Accounts from the Moors mention a curious phenomenon which has
this year been observed among the grouse. The birds are seen every-
where continually clapping their wings. It has been suggested that
they have been attacked with a disease of the nature of ST. WITUs's

MEssRs. Moses AND SoN have disclaimed the disgrace of being the
employers of the unfortunate shirt-maker EMMA MoUNSER: -
§. are glad to find that kind-hearted Thomas Hood did not write
the “Song of the Shirt” altogether in yain, since some of the task-
masters of the poor needlewomen are alive to the discredit of paying
2}d. for ten hours' labour. -

IRISH EMIGRATION SOCIETY.
TALKING of Emigration, we should first think of supplying our pos-
sessions that are nearest home with hard-working labourers and indus-
trious husbandmen, where their example might be of great benefit to
the population, and their labour productive of the greatest value to the
rich hy not, instead of :*: our farmers to Australia and
other parts, induce them to emigrate to Ireland, which really has the
greatest need of them? We feel there is a great difficulty to be first
surmounted, viz., the inducement; for no man, let him, have ever so
little to lose, likes naturally being shot!...This, however, is the Govern;
ment’s consideration, and not ours. What Ireland wants is a body of
men who will work, and to be freed from the burden of those who will
not work. We propose, therefore, that for every Englishman who, by
some inducement, is imported into Ireland, that two Irishmen, by the
same potent charm, be exported. By this exchange the country would
in time have a new population, and would eventually be happy. How-
ever, if our plan be adopted, we must stipulate that the Irishmen are
not brought into England; for though we are very anxious to benefit
them, still we are even more anxious not to injure ourselves. If there
is the smallest difficulty about it, we prefer remaining as we are.
THE MONSTER SESSION.
| MANY of the short-hand writers are beginning to suffer dreadfully
from the nausea consequent upon attending this Long Session. The
Times says it never had such a cruel time of it; the Chronicle declares it
would not go through it, again for anything; the Herald asserts that
it is fairly knocked up; the Post only wishes that every Member ma
be subjected for once in his life to the same torture, and then they will
know what it is; the Daily News has heard of the in uisition, but
doubts if it was ever so bad as the House of Commons; º the Morning
Advertiser questions seriously if a night cabman's existence is not a
much 'º. one than a reporter’s.
We feel for all these poor fellows who work when we are comfort-
ably in bed, in order, to provide us with a paper, the first, thing in the
morning, and hope that, with the help of a good holiday, they will soon
recover from the fatigues and the injuries of this enervating Session.
If ever men deserved pensions of their country, the Parliamentary
Reporters of this year certainly merit that poor distinction, for no
heroes can possibly have fought harder for one. LoRD John should, if
he wishes to show the least, sympathy for patient toil and suffering
talent, present them each with £200 a year; only we fear there is very
little hope for them unless they are related to one of the 1000 GREYs,
or happen to know the butler of the DUKE of BEDroRD, or can prove
they have done nothing, and are fit for nothing; in which case, if there
is a Lord or a Wiscount amongst them, he will probably be sent as an
Ambassador somewhere, at a handsome salary. This is all the best man
can expect under a Whig Government—Nobility first—Ability last.

(To the Editor of Punch.)
EAR SIR, “Belgraria, August 4th, 1848.
“I see by the Illustrated Neucs—which I take in
for the dear children, they are so fond of pictures—
that it is possible to move a house—an entire house—
at once. I am so glad of this, because it will save us the
trouble of packing up this year when we go out of town.
You must know, Sir, the trouble, the care, the anxiety there is, about
August, in every household, previous to running down to Brighton, or
going up the Rhine, or going to lovely Naples. There is seeing the
chandeliers sewn up in muslin bags; there is looking to the gold frames
being carefully silver-papered; there is covering the chairs; there are
the fire-grates, the door-handles, the plate, the crockery, the bed-curtains,
a thousand little domestic things, all of which have to be stowed away
or protected before you can leave your house in peace and quietness.
Now I am so charmed, so delighted, I cannot tell you, with this new
invention, which takes your domicile clean up by the kitchen, and
transports it, servants’ bedrooms and all, to any spot you please. By
this means you have the benefit of the sea air and the comforts of your
own home at the same time; and you know, Sir, as the Poet says, “there
is no place like home.’
“Our drawing-room cost us at least £2000–green damask with gold
fringe, and marqueterie tables—and the furniture of the lodging-houses
is so very so-so, that I am always afraid to sit down on a sofa for fear
of spoiling my dress. The only thing we shall have to do, will be to
give the order over night, and by the morning we shall be on the way
to Brighton—in fact, I suppose if we took post horses, we should get
there in time for breakfast. How nice' and there would be none of
the apprehension of sleeping the first night in damp sheets, because we
should occupy the same Arabian bedstead (ours is pink and satin with
white lace) we reposed in the night previous. ... I will certainly do this—
take my servants, cook, dishes, chimneys and all-only I am puzzled about
one thing : I don't know the address of the man who contracts for this
sort of thing, and the darling Illustrated News has forgotten to supply it
though I must say its picture of the removal is particularly pretty and
interesting, and shows at one view how casy the thing is to do.
“I do not like asking for favours much, but if you could oblige me
with the address of the Company which moves houses in town or
country, I should esteem it a very great obligation; and if you could
do it directly, you would oblige me still more, as I expect in a few
days my uncle to come and visit us; and (entre nous) he is a very cor-
pulent gentleman, and always brings his four daughters, lady's-maid,
You will feel, therefore, the additional weight of
valet, and servant.
what I say.
“I remain, dear Sir, with the greatest gratitude for your charming
petite publication, your constant reader—(whenever my husband brings
a copy home.) “ARABELLA Bold ER (née SMITH).”
SIBTHORP SERIOUS.
NoTHING less than KEELEY in Romeo, CoMpton in Hamlet, BEDroRD
in Mark Antony, or WRight in the melancholy Jacques, can bear com-
ison with º, strange reality of SIBThorp doing a bit of sentiment.
evertheless, the thing has positively occurred, and the gallant son of
MoMUs was caught in a piece of pathos, a few nights ago, on the subject
of his bones, and their future resting-place. He expressed his deter-
mination, in the most solemn way, to deposit his reliquide with those of
his ancestors; and he declared in effect, that where the remains of his
forefathers may have been piled up into a venerable Pelion, his humble
Ossa should be º: on the top of them. . Though there are many
changes, to which the gallant Sibthony is indifferent, the receptacle
for his bones is one of the few things he cannot persuade himself to
make no bones about. We trust it may be long before SIBTHORP,
who is always a source of pleasantry, shall degenerate into the very dry
subject to which he must be reduced, before his bona notabilia can give
rise to the discussion he has thought proper to originate.
Jenny Lind's Hospital.
THE seraphic JENNY has given—the receipts of her concert-the sum
of £1776 15s. to the Committee of the Brompton Hospital, for the
extension of the building. If the Committee do not call the Hospital
after JENNY LIND's entire name, they cannot refuse to denominate the
new part of the building—The Nightingale's Wing.
DENMARR AND THE DUCHIES.
WE regret to observe that GENERAL WRANGEL is recommencing
hostilities in Schleswig-Holstein. The General's name is ominous.
We hope this GENERAL WRANGEL will not prove the precursor of a
European row.

THE DEPUTATION MANLA.
THE Deputation Mania is on the increase, and the Ministers are
being continually pestered with little parties of delegates who come to
inquire why this, that, and the other, are not done, or undone, to please
certain parishes who think their will ought to be paramount. The
increased efficiency of the Police Force has roused the slumbering lions
of the Marylebone and other metropolitan vestries with remonstrances
and demonstrations of various kinds, enlivened by occasional badgerings
and bickerings at the Home Office. These gentlemen manage to mix
up the Constitution, somehow or other, with every private grievance of
their own; and they cannot see the addition of a º to their
Police-rate without apprehending that the downfal of public liberty
will be the consequence of the extra coppers for which they will be
called upon.
The Home Secretary having failed to see any danger to the Crown
or Constitution in the additional halfpenny, the delegates have vented
their indignation on their own representatives, and in the excess of
their ire, have threatened the Home Secretary that they will tell the
Premier; and one irate gentleman wanted to tell the House of Commons
at once, instead of telling the Minister in the first instance. In the
meantime, the Government will, we hope, do what is right, with the
assurance that so long as they do not attempt what is wrong, there will
be no reason to apprehend the fumes and threats of a party of parochial
blusterers, who happen to be patriots on this occasion, because they
happen to be rate-payers.
MODEL CLERKS.—THE GOVERNMENT CLERK.4
HE GOVERNMENT CLERK is the
most refined specimen. He
has grown so mild by practice,
that he never loses his temper.
He knows his station better
than to argue, or dispute, or
contradict, or differ in opinion
with any one. He has a sove-
reign remedy that protects
him from all complaints, mil
or virulent, and that is, deaf-
ness. Do what he will, he
cannot hear. It is a great im-
pediment that has never been
cured, though very often tried.
You must speak two or three
times, and very loudly, too,
before you can make him hear
a single word. He has then a
very indistinct notion of what
you want, and must read the account of last night's farce deliberately
through, and look at himself in the glass, before he can arrive to a
perfect comprehension that you are in want of anything. It is
in fact, in the art of putting a person off, that the Government
Clerk is especially clever. e does this so politely, that, though
offended, you are yet afraid to give explosion to your anger. “He
will be with you in one instant;” and he retires with a new coal
into the next room to give audience to one of his tailors. “He shall
be happy to attend upon you directly;” and he finishes to his fellow-
clerks a most curious incident that occurred to him last night at the
Polish Ball. “Will you be kind enough to take a chair?” whilst he per-
fects a Sweep for the next St. Leger. You cannot possibly be rude with
one who is so polite. At three o'clock he locks his desk, and commences
his toilet. After that hour every one is most blandly requested to take
the trouble to call again the following day. At four o'clock, as soon as the
*. before it strikes, he is to be seen on the water, or in Hyde
?ark, or on the top of an omnibus, so neatly attired, you never would
suspect he had been doing a hard day’s business. }. fact, who can
fell the papers he has diligently read, or the tender notes he has beau:
tifully written; or the happy little bits of literature he has knocked
off for Punch, or Blackwood's Magazine; or the numbers of “Don’t
love '' and “Do love,” he has strung together for gorgeous illumi-
nated songs, if BALFe only likes to have them; or the quires of paper
he has richly cartooned; or the endless quills he has cut into tooth:
picks, , or the countless variety of things, all requiring time, and
some degree of ability, that a Government &: is expected to do when
he gives his presence to his ungrateful country, from the very early hour
d or playing, like kittens, with one another, whilst the Welshman and the
of ten in the morning to as late an hour as four in the afternoon.

French pieces, and it cannot be pleasant to be interrupted in the middle of
a most impassioned scene, between a Countess and a sentimental barber's
boy, merely to give a date, or to hand over the office copy of some drear
document. Hasn't he to keep himself clean too, all the while? for, c
when you will, you always find the poor fellow busily employed in washing
his hands, or combing his hair, or dusting his boots, or mending his nails.
Before we laugh, we should really pause to consider whether there is
any one who could do as many things so well in the same short space of
time, as the Gover NMENT CLERK.
GOOSEY, GOOSEY, GANDER.
THERE has been a good deal of surprise expressed that MR. CHIsholm
ANstey should have found his way into Parliament; but the mystery
was solved a few evenings ago by MR. W.M. BRowN, who informed the
House of Commons that the voters of Youghal always look out for a
“good fat goose” at every election; and the conclusion is, that in MR.
CHISHOLM ANstEY they found the verything they are in the habit of
looking for. If they required the “foolish bird” for its cackling qualities,
we must confess the Youghal electors have had nothing to complain of
in their new representative, who has kept up an almost uninterrupted
cackle throughout the session. His goose-like attributes have also
developed themselves in a propensity for sitting continually upon mare's-
nests, and taking that odd bird Urquhart under his wing, with a per-
tinacity worthy of a better object. They have been egging each other
on, from first to last, like a brace of rare aves—which, for the credit of
Parliament, we are glad to say they have shown themselves.
THERE IS NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE.
WE long to see the picture of the Happy Family realised, viz., a
Scotchman, Welshman, Englishman, and Irishman, all living comfortably
and quietly in the same cage together. The thing is to be done—in
fact, has almost been done before, only the Irishman will occasionally
disturb the domestic peace, and insist upon being let out. The foolish
fellow only knocks his head against the bars, and then he raises a wild
cry about being an injured person, it never entering into his broken
head that he has been the principal cause of the injury himself. How:
ever, we . he will get tame in time, and that §. long we shall
see the Englishman and the Irishman sitting on the same perch together,
Scotchman look on with brotherly tears in their eyes.
We would walk any day to Trafalgar Square to see this phenomenon
of the Happy Family. It will be the greatest curiosity in London,
and will even throw a grace round the National Gallery. It will be a
beautiful sight—the first Wonder of the World. We only hope we
may live long enough to see it.
The Head of the British Army.
FMANY regiments have animals that walk always at their head. The
Fusiliers has a beautiful Welsh goat; another regiment has a mag-
nificent Indian elephant; and we forget the others. Might we suggest,
to parade at the head of PRINCE ALBERT's Own, an animal that has
lately presided over the changes and movements of the British Army-
we mean “The TAILoR's Goose?” In fact, a couple might be quartered
: the Horse Guards, under the arches, always kept ready for the heat
of action.
PARLIAMENTARY MOTION.
MR. —— to move for “a return of all the useless, idle, imper:
tinent, and ridiculous speeches made during the present Session, of
Parliament, with the names of the speakers affixed.”. Should this
return be granted, it is supposed that the document will be the most
voluminous upon record.
A Joke for the End of the Season.
It is not at all surprising that the Grand Opera of MEYERBEER
should have made such a hit at Covent Garden; for it stands to reason,
or in other words, it is as plain as the nose upon our own face, that
the Huge-nose (Huguenots) should be the greatest feature of the
season. Since the days of OvIDIUs NAso, or Ovid with the Nose,
we have met with no Opera equal to the Opera. we have named, in
aptitude for leading the public by the facial prominence implied in the
title of the Hugue-nots.
Family Quarrels.
IRELAND strikes us as being the Prodigal Son of England, always
going astray, then coming back, repenting, and being forgiven. JoHN
BULL may occasionally have been a harsh parent, but we are sure the
old fellow means well. It is too had to see father and son at daggers
drawn in this way. When will Ireland be a good boy, and learn to
remain quiet at home *

THE attention of Nursery Governesses is requested to the subjoined,
from the Times:—
ANTED, in a Gentleman's family, a Lady, who can be well recommended
as NURSERY GOVERNESS. She must be fond of children, clever with her
needle, active, intelligent, and good-tempered in the discharge of her duties. No
salary will be given. Travelling expenses and washing paid, with every domestic
comfort. Address, stating age, to R. L., Mr. , Dundee. -
Punch herewith proposes himself as private secretary to all Sisters of
Misery; being desirous of writing for them a form of reply to all invi.
tations animated by the like spirit that crawls in the above.
(Copy of Answer.)
. “SIR,-Having a comfortable patrimony, and acknowledging that
high and elevating necessity of our nature, that compels the heart to
love something, I should feel myself selected by the happiest fortune,
id you think me worthy of fulfilling the serious, and no less delicious
duties of Nursery Governess to your interesting children (number no
consequence).
“If I have any emotion in excess, it is that of the love of children;
a quality, perhaps, only second to that of plain and ornamental needle:
work. My activity never permits me to have a moment's leisure; and
my º: temper, from the time of my infancy, has passed into a family
proverb.
.“You state, Sir, and I admire the frankness—that “no salary will be
given.” I can fully understand, Sir, that the delightful privilege of
dwelling under your roof, and enjoying the pure moral atmosphere of
your hearth, must far exceed any value to be awarded by the coined
dross of this selfish world. How happy am I, that, possessing a suffi:
cient competence of my own, I may give myself up heart, and soul, and
pocket, to the formation of the minds of your children, and to the daily
execution of your needlework. Deign, Sir, to consider my application
with the most favourable grace; and, supplicating an answer,
“I remain your obedient and anxious servant.
“P.S. Pray do not pay the postage of your letter. I shall esteem
it as a touching earnest of your friendship, if you will allow me to pay
the twopence.”
SELF-GOVERNMENT.
ONCE on a time a fire broke out at the end of a long street, and crept
†m. . eating away the houses as none but such a devouring
element would have had the impudence to do.
|
There was a cry of “Send for the engines!”. But the occupier of the
middle house was a great opponent of Centralisation, and he stood on
his threshold with a bucket in one hand, and a garden squirt in the
other, and he exclaimed—
“Send for the engines' No such thing. All the engines come from
the Central Station; and Centralisation is a great mischief. Let every
man get his bucket and squirt, and put out the fire for himself. That’s
Self-Government!”
And so he was burnt to death, manfully squirting to the last moment.
Once on a time there was a man in a fever, and in his delirium he
insisted on having a bottle of port per diem. The doctor said it would
finish him; but his nurse was an iſ: for Self-Government, and she
pooh-poohed the doctor, and the patient crept to the cellaret and got
his bottle of rough old port, and uncorked it with his trembling hands,
and set it to his mouth and floored it manfully, and died an hour after-
wards; and his nurse glorified Self-Government exceedingly, as she
tied his chim up.
Once on a time Cholera rose from his marsh-bed in the East, and
stalked westwards, killing his thousands and tens of thousands as he
passed along. The feast was spread for him in stagnant ditches, and
reeking cesspools, and filthy dwellings, and wherever these were, he
fared abundantly; but where these were not, he starved.
And wise men who saw this, said “Let us not spread the table for
Cholera amongst us. Let us drain, and cleanse, and, sweep, and
whitewash.” But the people, who did not see it, grumbled at this, and
would not set hand to the work. And certain wiseacres stood by and
said, “Nay, we know a spell to keep of Cholera;” and they spelled
their spell, and it was, to repeat many times over “Self-Government,
Self-Government, Self-Government!” And Cholera chuckled when he
heard the spell—for he knew those wiseacres of old.

THE BATTLE OF THE OYSTERS.
WHEN the little boys poke an oyster-shell under our noses, with a re-
uest that we will shellout, and a plea that it is only oncea-year, we little
think how important it is that Oyster-day in London should be only an
annual. We have heard of the Battle of the Constitution being fought in
the Registration Courts, but it is mere child's play compared with the
Battle of the Oysters, as fought on the 4th of August at Billingsgate.
There is nothing in the history of the onslaughts made upon the indi-
genous, tribes by foreign invaders that is half so fierce as the attack
upon the natives on the anniversary of Oyster-day. The superstition
prevailing in London, that nobody can be lucky : the year unless he
devours a dozen or so of the favourite crustacea on the first day of their
coming in, necessitates the supply of some millions of the case-hardened
fish; and as they can º be bought in one contracted spot, no wonder
that the contest is one of inveterate bitterness and desperate ferocity.
The simultaneous rush of fishmongers' carts towards the point whence
the spoil must be taken, resembles the rapid whirling .P. Roman
war-chariots, which ADAMs, in his Antiquities, and BATTY, in his Circus,
have combined to impress upon our memories.
Every fishmonger in London sends a vehicle to the scene; and as the
horses are driven furiously to the attack, the approach of the cavalry
affords a magnificent spectacle of equestrian eagerness, stimulated by
human energy. Every combatant seems to reverse the view of ancient
Pistol, who looked upon the world as his oyster, and to see in every
oyster a world for which everything must be jeopardised. When we
witness in the evening the mountains of shells reared into grottoes, or
strewed along the thoroughfares, turning every street, for the time
being, into a sort of sea-shore, without any sea; when we witness this
peaceful sight, we little think of the fearful encounters amid which
these oysters have been sacked. We, at an awful sacrifice, paraphrase
the words of the poet:—
“Fish on whom the town has fed,
Oysters o'er whose gory bed
Many a British nose hath bled,
Hit by one, two, three.
Who would for an oyster—spread
Butter fresh and fancy bread,
Run the risk of broken head 3
Why : the more fool he: ”
Mercy among the fishmongering tribes is a quality utterly unknown;
and it has been well remarked by SMITH, in his Joca Seria sine Punctu,
(a work at present unpublished), that the Shellfish dealers are imbued
i. the ºu Shellfishness that their calling is likely to generate in
elr Inlinois.
THE BREAK-DOWN ON THE BALLOT.
To LoRD JoHN RUssell.
MY DEAR LORD, -
In the debate on MR. H. BERKELEY's resolution in favour of
the Ballot, you are reported thus to have expressed yourself in opposition
to it :—
“I can understand, indeed, that an argument might be used, running somewhat
in this manner—and if you introduce your principle of secrecy into the right of
voting, I do not know but such an argument might have its force and effect—that
it would be better that juries should not be subject to intimidation in the discharge of
their duties; that the judge, to give the fuli opportunity for deciding justly and
impartially, should not become obnoxious to public censure, and therefore trial
at law should be secret.”
Very well, my Lord. And if juries, in their vocation as grocers or
cheesemongers, *. exposed to loss of customers, and if judges
did, really lose their employment, by giving verdicts and passing
sentences according to their consciences, then, doubtless, trial at law
should be secret. Do you mean to say that such is the fact as regards
them? Do you mean to say that such is not the fact as regards voters?
Will you pretend that the cases are similar? Excuse me, my dear Lord,
but I really must beg you to take your choice between the bouncer and
º ºr. Which will you admit that you have outraged—truth
or logic
Next, dear LQRD.John, I find you represented as objecting to
the proposal of the Ballot, for being unaccompanied by a plan for the
Extension of the Suffrage, and as saying:—
“So this one-seventh of the adult male population of the kingdom is to be endowed
with what the constitution of Venice enjoyed, a secret and despotic power over all
the affairs of the realm.”
But, my good Finality LORD John, whose fault is it, I beseech you,
that no scheme has been proposed for the Éxtension of the suffrage:
that the constituency of the kingdom includes but one-seventh of adult
Englishmen? Does this sin lie at MR. BERKELEY’s door, or at the
ſº the Treasury, and at the portal of a certain domicile in Richmond
ar
Lastly, after having objected to the Ballot on the score of secrecy, I
am informed that you assert:—
“I believe that if persons took the pains to find out the vote that was given, it
would always be discovered, and that it never could be disguised; and therefore
there would be always some kind of influence used at elections.”
So you maintain the Ballot to be mischievous on account of its
secrecy, and useless because that secrecy is impossible. You support
your point by a mis-statement and a false analogy, and clench your
reasoning by a contradiction in terms. Your #: remind me of
PHARAOH's kine; for your lean arguments eat up your º assertions.
No wonder the House affirmed the principle of the Ballot, after hearing
your objections to it. Congratulating you on having thus attained your
minority, - - -
I remain, your sincere well-wisher,
3355678.

THE PARLIAMENTARY HARVEST OF ONE SHEAF.
Mr. Bull. “WELL, John, what of THE HARVEST : ”
John. “Oh, MR. BuLL, we’ve AN Aven AGE CROP.”
CONSCIENCE MONEY.
We are ha 8. see the H." of sending sums anonymously, in
the shape y nscience Money, becoming somewhat general...The
CHANCELLoR of THE ExchEQUER is continually getting the half of a
bank-note from some penitent, who, in his day, has done—what England
expects every man to do now and then—the Duty.
We shall be glad to find this system applied more generally, and it
would give us unalloyed pleasure to hear of cash dropping into the
public coffers from the overburdened consciences and plethoric purses
of some of the holders of snug sinecures. Unfortunately the consciences
of people of this class are not very troublesome, and we hardly know how
to work upon them, unless the Treasury were allowed to put into com-
mission a few ghosts, regularly rigged out in sheets and stilts, to inter;
cept the sinecurists on their º. after receiving their un-earned
salaries. Something of the kind might answer very well behind the
door of the Court of Chancery, to alarm the scruples of the door-keeper;
but unfortunately the keeper never goes near the door, and therefore is
never in a position to be pounced upon.
As a proof of something like returning conscience among certain
literary depredators, we may mention the fact that we have received
several hundred ideas, jokes, and articles of a miscellaneous description,
forwarded to us by persons who had tried to convert them to their own
use by pilfering and slightly disguising them, but who had disgracefully
failed in the experiment.
Some curious instances of Conscience Money, returned in the shape
of fees disgorged by attorneys, and sent back to their victimised clients
have also been reported to us; but these cases are of such anapocryphal
nature that we cannot believe them until we have had experience of
their reality. When MR. BRIEFLEss sends us back the guinea we gave
him for the opinion that has been overruled twice, at a cost of 240
guineas, and established three times, at an expense of £570 14s. 2d.
and “a friendly suit” that, amicably eased us of £86.18s, we sha
begin to put some faith in the rumour that conscience is beginning to
find its way at last into the forensic profession.

A LETTER FROM A SLEEPY MEMBER.
“MR. PUNCH, “Bellamy’s, Friday, August 11th, 1848.
“SIR, I rise-I mean sit—to address you, Sir, on a subject
involving, in a great degree, the comfort and happiness of a considerable

fact to you, I am sure you will not
be surprised, nor will your numerous

unfrequently during the speeches of
MR. Anstey and other Honourable

Commons in Parliament assembled-
I say, Sir, that you will not be sur-

finding ourselves in the hands of
MR, ANSTEY. (Hear, hear, and a

cramp, rheumatism, and pins-and-needles, what I desire is, to obtain
leave to bring in a Bill to enable Members of Parliament to pro-
vide their own seats in the House as well as out of it (Hear! and a
very small laugh). I have, Sir, at great personal trºuble, and I will say,
at great pecuniary sacrifice, constructed, by the aid of my upholsterer,

COURT-MARTIAL.
THE soldier's frock-coat has been called up before a Court-martial,
presided over by LIEUT.-Colonel. STULTz, assisted by GENERAL
DoudNEY, Ensign Moses, and several other distinguished officers.
The offence the frock-coat has given is not distinctly known, but it was
stated that an example was wanted to strike terror into the British
Army, and accordingly, the coat was sentenced to receive a dozen rounds.
The culprit was instantly tied up by the arms to the Alberts. When
he was cut down the rounds had been given with such precision, that
the poor coat was wasted away almost to a mere jacket, and presented
so sad a spectacle that it made the stoutest turn and tremble. He was
immediately carried to the tailors' board, and restoratives applied, but
it is not expected that he will survive much longer. He has evidently
been cut offin his prime, and will be universally regretted, as he was avery

The Delightful Process of Dressing in a Bathing Machine.
THE LADY CORONETS OF WESTMINSTER.
- HE days of chivalry are gone; and MR. H. BERRELEY
may be said to have spoken the funeral oration of
the deceased. His assault upon the female Coronets
(Coronets are of both sexes) of Westminster in his
Ballot resolution, was distinguished by a fierceness
that makes Punch blush for the gallantry of the
Commons. To think that an M.P., in human shape, should speak
thus of woman; lovely, gentle, darling woman!-
“In the course of the day before the election six carriages drew up at this trades-
man's door, each with a coronet on the panels. From these carriages descended
parties of ladies, and there was no cajolery or artifice to which they did not resortin
order to induce him to vote for Captain Rous. In conclusion, they worried the poor
man so much-"
In short, they left the man no voice, driving off with his plumperas
banditti would ride off with a traveller's portmanteau. Such, at least,
is the ungallant inference of MR. BERKELEY ; and we very much
regret, for the honour of Parliament assembled, that, no. Member
had the chivalry to question it. “Cajolery,” “artifice,” applied
to female Coronets! Endeavouring to speak in the injured spirit
of the accused, “We should very much like to know what the
honourable gentleman means? It’s like his impudence A lady
can't shake hands, with a butcher, or kiss his baby, or declare
what a dear good-looking woman his wife is, or merely give her
private opinion that CAPTAIN Rous is a darling of a sailor, and one who
ought to be voted for, and if he isn’t, that the tradesman refusing
shall never send in another farthing's-worth of goods; no, not if there
was not another butcher in all Westminster: a lady, for the most
innocent motives, can only just hint so much as this, for the good of
the country, assailed as it is in Church and State-as the dear Bishop
of Canaan says, with tears in his eyes—a lady, making an effort with
herself to protect our Institutions, has only to smile, or laugh, or
frown, or scold a wretch of a voter, as the case may be, and up
gets agentleman in the House of Commons-ſand what that House ºf
Commons can be made of, to sit quiet and listen to such things, it’s
more than she can tell)—and talks of ‘cajolery, and ‘artifice, and
‘worrying!' Well, shenever! The lady only wishes she was a man-
that’s all !”
. For our own part, we think it would have been more straightforward
in MR. BERKELEY to have brought in a Bill making it felony for any
lady to canvas a voter, unless the said lady should—as in the days of
our great-grandmothers—wear a mask and register herself as not being
under two-and-forty. This, we take it, would have put down the abuse
once and for ever.

Suspension Acts.
It was a question in the Assemblée Nationale whether MR. PROUD-
HoN's speech should be reported. By this it would seem that the
suppression of a Member's speech is evidently a great punishment. It
would have a great effect in the House of Commons, we think, if
several Members were punished in this way... We should like it to be
applied to MR.ANstEy-for hitherto only the House and the nation
have been punished with his speeches. By the bye, if LoRD JoHN
were to suspend the printing of the debates, it is a question whether more
business would not be transacted? The Habeas Corpus Act should be
enforced against the body of reporters. As yet, so little, has been done,
that g; think his Session might with justice be called the “SUSPEN.

The North-Western Engine-Drivers.
THERE is a little disagreement between these useful functionaries and
their employers, the latter charging the former with a desire to drive a
very hard bargain as well as a tender, and the former implying that the
latter are ºf the old saying with reference to a certain old
gentleman driving when needs must, which is alleged to be the case in
consequence of the resignation of the experienced servants. Considering
the very powerful engine both parties have in their hands, we hope the
will have the good sense to prevent any further collision; and thoug
we cannot recommend, in railway matters, the system of meeting each
other half-way, we hope that they will lose as little time as possible in
getting into a train of settlement.
SINGULAR OCCURRENCE.
A Few evenings ago, as a gentleman named JoHN RUSSELL was
quietly seated on his bench—thinking of nothing—he was assaulted by
a person named BERKELEY, who, with others, carried him off his feet,
and—as GULLIVER was jammed into a marrow-bone—stuck him hard
and fast in a ballot-box. Happily, no injury was committed upon the
worthy gentleman; but there is every reason to believe that his
assailants, animated by their late success, contemplate a renewal of
their violence.

• IMPROMPTU IMMORTALITY.
THE Widow ConMACK must, in future, take her place by the side of
LoRD BYRON, and exclaim, with the poet peer, or peerless poet—“I
awoke one morning, and found myself, famous.” . The gentleman
jumping up into the air with the explosive force of a quack pill, and
shrieking out convulsively, “Ha! haſ ha! cured in an instant?”
undergoes a tedious process compared to the celerity with which the
Widow CoRMACK attained a sudden, renown, that would justify the
frantic shout of, “Ho!, ho! hel he hel immortal. in a twinkling.”
She went to bed one might, and waking, found herself in the pages of
history, the police in , her cupboards, and SMITH.Q'BRIEN in her
cabbage-bed. She had retired with her children into the arms of
MoRPHEUs, and tumbled directly into the hands of the Constabulary;
while the King of Munster had dropped in among some of the growin
eens of Green Erin, in the Widow's kitchen-garden. She who
; nothing but “a poor lone widow” qver night, found herself at
such a premium in the morning, that her cabbages were being cabbaged
by the crowd as curiosities, and she É. a letter by an early post, from
a theatrical manager, offering her her own terms, for herself and
family to appear between the first and second pieces, with a bunch of
the original cabbages in their hands, as a sample of the King of 4
Munster's hiding-place. Notoriety was never before achieved at such
short notice, for the mantle of Fame has fallen upon the Widow
CoRMACK and her family, as rapidly as if Fame kept a lot of mantles on
hand, ready made, after the manner of the dealers in the tribe of paletots
which fit everybody by fitting nobody, and hang as loosely on the
natural shape, as any lusus naturae that modern tastelessness has been
permitted to thrust upon society.

Cheap Noise for the Navy.
MR. HUME, the other evening, in the House
of Commons, gave notice of his intention to
ask the Government for an account of the
expenses of gunpowder used for Salutes. To
blow the money of the nation away into ex-
pansive es, is literally to fling it to the
winds. The cash of the country ought not
to be converted into fulminating gold and
silver.
HUME in objecting to these expensive explo-
sions. We do grudge an outlay of the
precious metals for the mere purpose of
making a noise in honour of illustrious
personages. That end would be answered
equally well by sheet-iron, the material for
|prºducin mock-thunder not, to be distin-
|guished from real...This would be din enough
|for any manifestation of respect or loyalty;
|and therefore we suggest that, as a substi-
tute for powder, mimic thunder should be
added to the ratlins of the Royal Navy.
The Ne Puff Ultra.
A FORMIDABLE placard, in letters long
enough to show the length to which puffing
may go, has been paraded round London for
some weeks past, with the startling catch-line
of “BILE! BILE! BILE!” A mad wag of our
acquaintance, who has two Commissions of
|Lunacy out against him on two separate puns,
shape of a declaration, that on seeing the
words “BILE | BILE! BILE!” intruded upon
the public gaze, he felt his blood “ Bile,
BILE, BILE” in the most tumultuous and
extraordinary manner.”
- SHAKSPEARE BIRCHED.
An unfortunate individual, who thus writes himself down, “W. J.
| BIRCH, M. A., New Inn Hall, Oxon,” has been guilty of begetting a
book called An Inquiry into the Philosophy and Religion of Shakspeare.
This benighted Biach calls up SHAkspeaRE, and accuses him of In-
fidelity. #. had not the proper notions of immortality, says BIRCH;
and—to the great delight of his own charitable soul—he proves, at
least in the belief of the possessors, the existence of no such for other
people. MARLow is at once written down an Atheist; and, indeed,
other playhouse folks are turned inside out, as BIRCH would turn out
one º his old gloves. Several of our contemporaries have abused
BIRCH at length; the more simple they. We should as soon think of
arguing with a reasoner who, for fault of human wit, used ancient eggs.
†. however, insults SHAKspeARE; we would punish him, and in
this fashion:—We would turn him adrift in a washing-tub upon the
Avon; and whereas BIRCH has thrown his dirt at the Swan, he should
be piloted by congenial geese. After this, we would have it most sig-
nificantly proved to BIRCH that he deserved nothing short of himself.
Work and Wages for Parliament.
LoRD John Russell, in spite of the lamentations of Colonel
SIBTHoRP at losing his holiday, has induced the House of Commons to
resolve to sit on Wednesdays. We do not wish to interfere with the
business of MR. CANTELO, but we would suggest that the cushions of
the Members should be stuffed with eggs, so that something might be
hatched with all this sitting. It is clear that if there were less standing
and talking in the House, there would not be so much sitting and doin
nothing. We are fast veering round to that point of the Charter whic
requires the payment of Members of Parliament; only, to insure the
work for the wages, we would have them paid by the job or the
In easure.
As Good as a Play.
THE Morning Post, reporting a “marriage in high life,” which took
place last week at St. George's, Hanover Square, informs us, after
describing the bride's clothes, that “the ceremony was beautifully per-
formed by the Rev. MR. CAMPBELL.” Good gracious ! what does our
ſº contemporary mean? Does he consider the Marriage service
to be a tragedy or a melodrama? or does he look upon it in the light of
a genteel comedy?
“WHAT'S IN A NAME? “
WE have received two or three letters from some unreasonable Third

Quite right! If Third Class Passengers were not rendered as uncom-

to the receipts of the Company. If a Third Class Carriage was not
made to be “replete with every inconvenience,” who would ride in a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR PROROGATION SPEECH.
HEN Parliament opens, it is gene-
rally witha Speech from the QUEEN;
it ought to close with a Speech
from Punch. There would be a
Fº about this arrangement,
t would be pleasantly typical of
the Royal Promise and Ridiculous
Performance of the present Minis-
try. So to our Speech:—
You assembled on Thursday
the 19th of November; you are
about to separate this present
Saturday, the 19th of August...You
per:eive this gives nine months of
work—that is, talk. In eight of
these nine months you have passed
twenty-six, Acts, of which all but
nine were Acts of course. To bring
about these mine Acts you have
- - talked 4810 pages of HANsARD.
About twice that quantity of talk has : unprinted. The Country
appreciates your services. She acknowledges your readiness to devote
your last breaths to her advantage. All she asks is the halfpennyworth
of work to this intolerable quantity of words.
GEMTLEMEN OF THE House of CoMMONs,
You met early; §. are separating late. You were called
together mainly for three objects. Measures were to be recommended
to your consideration for advancing the social condition of Ireland; for
modifying the Navigation Laws; and improving the Public Health.
Towards the first of these objects you have contributed an Arms Bill, a
Crown and Government Security Bill, and a Bill for suspending Habeas
Corpus;, towards the second you have contributed nothing; towards
the third, not exactly nothing, but next to it. , You have, besides this,
passed a Sugar Bill, which has the great merit of dissatisfying every-
body; you have thrown away a million and a half in the shape of a loan
to Irish landlords, and a half-million, in that of an advance to West
India Planters. You have also emasculated the Public Health Bill, and
passed a measure on the subject which cannot do much harm, and may
do a little goo -
When I turn from what you have done, to what you have left undone,
I am struck by a great contrast. You may congratulate yourselves on
having abundance of work cut out for the year.
I have given directions that Estimates of all that is to be done “next
Session” should be made out, and laid before Ministers. I expect
that it will astonish them.
I remark with pain, that you have ſº into a habit of laughing at very
serious things; such as Chartism and Irish Rebellion. I am desirous
that you should leave this to me. I will find out the absurdities of
both : you have to deal with the serious side of these facts. FEARGUs
O'ConnoR may be a very absurd person, and SMITH O'BRIEN very
contemptible; but Chartism is, nevertheless, rife among English working
men, and disaffection among the peasantry of Ireland. I look with
confidence to see you grave on both these subjects for the future.
am preparing measures for limiting the speeches of honourable
Members; º, that the time is not far distant when honourable
Members who have nothing to say, will not think it necessary to take
up so much time in saying it.
Gentlemen, your Session has extended over a time marked by
marvellous events, and full of great suffering on the part of the
Working Classes of the Empire. You do not seem to have appreciated
the one, and you have done nothing to alleviate the other. It is a
gratifying proof of the stability of our Institutions that they have
resisted convulsions without any help from HER MAJESTY's
Ministers, who have tested the Constitution, as railway bridges are
tested, by putting on, it a much heavier weight of incapacity than it is
ever likely to be required to bear on ordinary occasions.
My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
. Allow me, to bid you all good bye, on the conclusion of a
Session unexampled for the greatness of its promise and the smallness
of its performance—the Spanish Giant of Sessions, as far as words go;
and their ToM THUMB, as far as work.
The Walue of Ridicule.
If the Irish Rebellion had only broken out six months ago, what a
deal of bloodshed might have been saved' for there is no doubt the
result would have cast such intense ridicule upon the very name of
Revolution, that no State would have had the courage to attempt one
after the Hibernian failure.
RATHER UNSATISFACTORY.
THE Court Circular is certainly not the place in which we are in the
habit of looking for our light reading, nor do we expect to find it in any
of those moving accidents by flood and field which form the elements of
romance; but we do occasionally get hold of a paragraph in it that (as
the Reviewers have it when their amiable criticism is charged as an
advertisement) “will repay perusal.” We found in Wednesday’s
Number of that water-gruelly work a few lines that raised a smile, and
as we estimate every smile at threepence—we will pay that price to any
one who can manage to call up a risible illumination into our counte-
nance-we may allow that the Court Circular has for once “repaid
perusal.” The following is the paragraph, whose value as a ludicrous
irritant may not at first sight appear:—
“CAPTAIN DENHAM, R.N., F.R.S., had interviews at the Board of Trade and
Admiralty yesterday with his reports and diagrams respecting the recent steam-
vessel accidents in the Irish Sea and Gulf of Finland.”
A closer examination of the sentence will, however, show its purport
to be that CAPTAIN DENHAM has had an interview with his own reports
and diagrams. Why he should have made the Admiralty the place of
rendezvous between himself and his own productions does not appear,
and the thing is almost as absurd as an amateur punster making an
appointment with one of his own jokes to meet him at the Punch Office,
or Colon EL SIBTHORP arranging an interview with himself on Water-

writes the Court Circular must have come to the fearful determination

Shocking Accident to Mr. Urquhart.
We are sorry to record a terrific accident which has befallen
MR. UrQUHART, M. P. On Wednesday last week, in the House of
Commons, the Honourable Member attempted to move a heavy reso-
lution, condemnatory of the anti-slave trade policy of Ministers in the
East. This incautious movement brought down upon him Loºp PAL-
Merston, who, falling upon him with tremendous weight, literally
crushed him to atoms. We cannot say that the unfortunate gentleman
lies in a dangerous state, for he is completely smashed, and the vital

anybody.
THE HORSE FOR OUR MONEY.
In the list of the horses at Egham races, we observed a steed named
“Death's Antagonist.” This is just the animal on which a man would
choose to ride for his life.

PHOEBUS AT HIDE AND SEEK.
It is motorious that during the whole of last week the Sun was
keeping out of the way, and we have at length discovered the cause of
this alarming act of Solar bankruptcy. The truthis, that the celebrated
firm of Phoebus and Sun was quite unable to answer the demands
we hear have lately been made upon it in Paris to take Photographic
Portraits of the 900 Members of the National Assembly. There is
something awful in the task of running through 900 noses, filling in
1800 eyes—some of the noses are of course hooks, to match the eyes-
and biting in some 32,400 teeth, belonging to the Members of the
National Assembly.
We do not wonder at the Sun having proved nonest inventus for the past
week, when such were the labours assigned to it. Even the greatest of
all luminaries, ourselves, would feel a little put out if such a task as
this were to be imposed upon us. Imagine the horror of having to take
the impression of all the miscellaneous snubs, pugs, and other proboscal
prominences of 900 Republican representatives, to say nothing of the
other features that diverge from the 900 great scenters that the Sun is
Hope for the Potatoes.
The Manchester Courier
says that a potato-grower near
W. on examining his
crop a short time ago, “found
it in every direction seriously
affected; ten days afterwards,
on examining it, all trace of
the disease had disap
and the plants were looking
healthy.” We are glad to
find the potato disease mani-
festing itself in a milder form.
It thus appears, that when
potatoes are out of sorts they
may be sufferingmerely from a
slight cold-caught, perhaps,
from lying in a damp bed-
or some other temporary in-
to have the handling of. We could scarcely expect our old friend Phºeus ever to shine again if he should disposition. When, therefore,
really execute the awful duty said to be imposed upon him at Paris.

THE English language is known to be a delicious jumble of some
half-dozen tongues, of which, like the tongue of the half-boot, the
tongue of the buffalo, or the tongue of the British female, it is difficult
to get at the end. Language has been called the criterion of a nation's
jº. we don’t see why—and it may therefore be said that a
country, like a patient, has only to put the tongue out to enable us to
judge of the condition of either. It is true that there is much power in
anguage; and, though DeMostRENEs failed in his celebrated boxing.
match with the Grecian prize-fighter, the orator used to say, “Wouldn't
I have given him a licking though, if I had depended on my tongue!”
The English tongue is very ancient; and we think we may hazard the
observation, that the tongue of every country, though not of such
remote extraction, must always be a little older than its teeth. With
these preliminary sentences, we proceed to consider some of those old
phrases which time has rendered familiar; and without going back
to WYNKYN DE WoRD, whose wordiness always sets us winking, we will
look at the original meaning of some of those sayings, our familiarity
with which has almost degenerated into contempt. We will commence,
rather appropriately, by seizing the bullock by his capital excrescences,
all
2 I—Taking the Bull by the Horns.
This operation enjoys a much larger reputation for wisdom than it
deserves, inasmuch as it, is very doubtful policy to attempt to bully a
bull, by treating him in this unceremonious manner.
II.-He put his Nose out of Joint.
This saying is about as absurd as the other; for everybody knows
that everybody’s nose is utterly without joints, and cannot therefore
be put out of a condition it has never enjoyed.
III–Money makes the Mare to go.
There is a semblance of truth in this observation, if we may be
allowed to sacrifice its º: for money may be said to make the
Mayor to go, to a certain extent, by keeping things going at the Man-
sion House. In an equestrian sense, the saying is perfectly monstrous,
for there are some mares that will not go for any money, if you put them
up to auction, on the one hand, or put them into harness on the other.
These afford only a small specimen of the nonsense inscribed in old
sayings; but ea tribus disce omnes, is the reply we make to those who
would ask for a more extensive sample.
A Hint from Houdin.
WE understand that LoRD John Russell applied to the celebrated
Houdin for the loan of the empty bottle out of which he so miraculously
extracts all sorts of good things, in order that the Whig Premier may
those valuable tubers chance
to look poorly, we trust that
they will not in all cases be
given up in despair.

THE CHARTIST HEROES.
ONE of the vagabonds who was concerned in the late scheme to
blow out all the gas-lights in London at a single gust, and empty the
Thames, the New River, and every other source from which London is
supplied with water, by merely boring a hole in the main—one of
these scoundrels was discovered to have an old coal-scuttle round him
in the place of a shirt, by way of armour. Another scamp had got
a couple of coffee-pots, by way of greaves for his legs; a third, had
got a pair of pepper-boxes for gauntlets. Another of the asinine villains
had got a dripping-pan by way of waistcoat; and we only wish he
had got the benefit of a thorough basting from the appropriate spoon.
One of the delegates was found with his head entangled in a potato-
strainer that he had been trying on as a helmet.
The precipitancy of the Chartists in arming themselves with tin-
kettles a little too early, has sent them all to pot, rather before their
time. The individual who sported a tea-kettle for a stomacher, had a
natural tendency to spout; and when he declared his blood was boiling,
he was no doubt thinking of his own hard case.
Arson Extraordinary.
... WE are sorry to have to record an alarming and rather atrocious
instance of arson, committed by a contemporary whom we have hitherto
been in the habit of regarding as decidedly respectable. The case to
which we allude is the entire burning of the city of Milan by the Daily
News. This fearful conflagration occurred at the commencement of
last week, and appears to have originated in the folly of some wickedly:
disposed individual, who threw up a lighted straw for the purpose of
seeing which way the wind blew. , Happily, some dampers were speedily
applied, in the shape of wet blankets, from the printing-presses of some
other Journals, and the fire was extinguished, º not until Milan had
been in ashes for at least half-an-hour, when the conflagration turned
out to be nothing more than a column of the ordinary newspaper smoke.
The Heavy Blow, and Great Discouragement.
PARLIAMENT is still in the hands of the ventilator and the architect,
and it seems likely to deserve at last the title of
“The House that braved, a thousand years,
The BAARY and the breeze.”
John BULL may certainly say of the money granted for DR. REID's
experiments, as Othello did of “all his fond love” for Desdemona,
“I give it to the winds—'tis gone.”
Arms Found Here.
SoME Irish patriots intend convening a public meeting to take into
take a lesson in the art of obtaining a constant surplus from a perpetual
deficiency. MossIEUR Houdin obligingly submitted the bottle to the
Premier's inspection, who saw, as usual, “nothing in it.”

Out of compliment to their leader, the national insignia are for the
future to be, “The Rose, the Thistle, and the CABBAGE.”

“Frankfort, Aug. 9, 1848.
“MY DEAR PAPA,
~ “Agreeable to
the wishes of yourself
and dear Mamma, I take
- up my pen to give you
some idear of my travels on the Continent, as far as I have yet been,
“The little baskit of Ham-sangwidges and Sherry was a great comfut
to me on the journey to Dover. They served to console me after takin
leave of my dear Mar, and kep my sperrits up very well. We arrive
without accident at the Shipp Inn in time for supper.
“MR. BIRMINGHAM has some of the best Maderia ever drank in my
life; if you come this way for the ollidays, ask for it, and thank your
dear SAM for pointing, you out a good thing, MR, CoRKER liked it too
very much, and we wiled away the hours till bedd-time drinking it, and
to the health of my dearest parents.
“The packit sett of so dewsiderly there was no time to ave anythink
comfortable for breakfast; we therefore only ad some coffy and biskits,
and went on board the Ostend boat. -
“It blew very fresh, and MR. C. was quite overcome. But the sea
hair gives me always an appatite, and I had a good foring breakfast of
ham and eggs, and a glass of Coniac, which kep me all right; and I
didn't wake until we were in Ostend Arbour, by which time MR. C.
begºn too to look up.
‘This town is very ugly to look at, but strongly fortafied, and has
oysters all the year round. Aving to wait for the train, I thought our
best amusement would be to try a few dozen of their famous natives,
which we did so. But law bless you Pa, there no such great things after
all. Many and many time after the play have we ad bushels of as good
fish, as well as to lunch, in my dear native city of London. Porter they
charge ls. 8d. per bottle, which you must allow is rather heavy.
“The country all the way to Brussells is as flat and green as our billiard-
table at Camberwell—the towns quite old and ugly. They sell fruit
along the road; we ad ..º.º. sower, cherries ditto, aypricots so
so, cost one frank. At all the Stations they were drinking beer which
I had some, but olor! Pa! such sower stuff! Why they wouldn't
drink it in our servant's hall ! -
“ Brussells is a clean town. We got in just in time for dinner at the
Hotel de Suede—as handsome, comfortable, well kep an Inn as ever you
saw. Dinner not like us, but famous, all except the soup, which is very
shy, and made me think of my dearest Ma and the Shippand Turtle wit
tears in my eyes.
“Fish is served after roast meat in this Popish country; and Puddn
comes in the middle of dinner, about the fourteenth †. ; which sur-
prized and disappointed me a good deal, for I wished twice of it, and
was obliged to go on agin quitº, fresh at the remaining things, 1 had
twenty-nine different things: MR. C. was obliged to cry pickayvy at
the twenty-third or so—and he did look so red! We went and took
something warm at a caffy near the Qpera, where we went afterwards,
and fell asleep with the fateagues of the day. I never much cared about
that singing.
“Next day we set off for a watering-place called Spa, pronounced
Spore here—a little bit of a quiet place, where there’s what they call
mineral springs. But the best thing I found here was some little cray-
fish, that ain’t much bigger than a good Brighton prawn, but they are
full of ſlaviour and you can eat no end of 'em. I wish I could see dear
Ma with a plateful before her. They certainly are both crisp and juicy.
“We were at a most comfortable Inn, the Hotel de Paybaw as it is
pronounced. I remarked the ladies at the table d'hôte used their knives
to their vedgetables and things, and I like the practice very much.
“Ax-la-Chapelle is another bath or bang where the dinners are by no
means bad. Game is here in plenty: and if you go to the Grand
Monarch Inn you will get there a kind of Sallat, which, upon my con-
science, is the best thing I ever ate in that way. We went to a ball at
--"
Tº-
the Rooms, but there was no supper, and I didn't care for staying
dawdling about and seeing the stupid dancing.
“I had a shy at the famous gambling tables: and neither lost nor
won. As my dear Par gives me as much money as ever I want, what
do I care about winning anybody else's It was much better surely to
come home to a quiet supper than to bother yourself at that stupid
dancing or gambling.
“What I have particularly remarked on the Continent is there capital
way of doing potatoes—sometimes brown—sometimes in white sauce—
sometimes in sallid which is capitle. I’ll dress one when I come home
for my dear sisters and Ma.
“The railroads has tunnels just like ours: and in every train there’s
a carriage express for smoaking—with little tin-boxes to put your cigar-
ashes into, and every think convenient. There is plenty of what they
call restorations at the stations, by which they mean places where you
may lunch and have refreshment. I will say for eating and drinking
these Germans are people after my own heart.
“As there was a steamer to Coblence setting off just aſter the rail,
we only drove through the town of Cologne, and that was quite enough,
for it is an ugly old-fashioned place: and got on board for the three
o'clock boat.
“Would you believe they had all dined already on board the boat?
which disappointed both me and MR. C. very much, for there is no
place where you can see the manners and customs of a people so well as
where they are dining, and we were forced to put up with just a beef-
steak—(it’s not a reglar beefsteak on the Continent such as you git at
dear Joe's—only the undercut of the sirloin) and made out a wretched
disappointing dinner as best we could. It was rather showary, and so
we played at chess, and had a map in the cabbin, and reached Coblence
at ten at night—time for supper though, trust your SAM for that. Wild
bore very good. Trouts ditto; call them. Forellens here. Rudesheimer
rather sower, must take something to correct it afterwards.
“Up in the morning at five, and off per boat to Mayence, where the
famous Ham comes from. Couldn't sleep all night though: beds small:
people walking about. When we got on board took coffy, and went
and had a good snooze in the cabbin again. Didn't wake till ten, when,
as I ... we had passed all the pretty part of the Rhine, and it
couldn't be helped, (and as for me, give me a good sleep before all your
lanskips). We had a meat and egg breakfast, and got to Mayence at
one o'clock.
“They kep us waiting at the train two hours, and then we came on
to Frankfort to our Correspondent, MR. SchILDKROT, who had a
handsome dinner ready to receive
“Your affectionate Son,

UNDER THE ROSE; or, BRITANNIA TO THE POPE.
(Supposed to be sung by SIR RoBERT INGLIs.)
CoME to the garden bower,
Come where the violet blows,
And honeysuckle grows,
With every pretty flower:
There will I treat with thee,
All so clandestinely,
Under the Rose.
There will we plight our troth,
Our mutual minds disclose,
As everybody knows
Is needful to us both;
Though for appearance sake,
We must arrangements make,
Under the Rose. l
Of Irish schools and sees,
And little things like those,
Where the carnation glows
We'll sit and talk at ease;
Among the pinks and cloves,
O'er which the brisk bee roves,
Under the Rose.
That I ignore thy power
The world must needs suppose;
And we must pass for foes:
Yet will we, many an hour,
Among the tulip beds
Together lay our heads,
Under the Rose.
The Late Weather.
“I HAVE no coppers, my good man,” said a gentleman, “but I'll
remember you, one of these fine days.”—“Long life to your honour!”
exclaimed the crossing-sweeper. “Sure enough, I’m eternally indebted
to you.” The gentleman was so well pleased with this answer, that he
tried the same promise at the next crossing he came to. “One of these
fine days, monſ” repeated the crossing-sweeper, who happened to be a
Scotchman. “ wº I dinna mind, if you'll allow me interest.”
Female Poltroonery.
WE perceive that at the late Meeting of the British Association at
Swansea, a DR. Edward SHUNck read a report on colouring matters,
the length of which drove most of the ladies away. We were aware of
the promeness of ladies to timidity; but, judging from their partiality
for gay ribbons and smart bonnets, we were not prepared to expect that
they would have thus deserted their colours.

THE BRITISH ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.
onceive what a matter of pain it is to us that we cannot
devote one whole Number, at least, to a report of the
doings of this itinerant body Perhaps Antiquity
never went upon the tramp for so useful an end; so
many of the members “rubbing” up their brass to
flºº in the eyes of an illuminated generation. Per-
aps the luncheons—for it would seem that antiquarians
ate by double-entry, taking two luncheons where com-
ºſ) mom ignorance is content with one—were among the
*| most useful additions to the science of Antiquarianism.
The Cheshire cheese produced on these occasions, was
very old indeed; one distinguished Archaeologist proved
the descent, in a right curl, of the mites from the mites
of the “toasted cheese” celebrated in song as the cheese that made
the Welshman's mouth like unto a mouse-trap. The beeswing in
the port was shown—by means of a microscope—to have belonged to
the bees of Hybla; one Professor boldly buzzing the bottle in proof
of it. The ham-sandwiches were descended from the Plantagenet
boar; and a noble round of corned beef claimed for its ancestor the
first bull of Pope INNOCENT. We merely allude to these matters, as
showing that even in the leisure of refection, the members by no
means forgot what was due to science.
Did, we pretend to give any kind of description of all the papers,
how gladly would we linger on “The Chalk Deposit that Scrred the
first Figures of the National Debt l”. How dally with MR.PLANCHE's
contribution “On the Early Knee-buckles of the Primitive High-
landers!” But we must not expatiate; no, we can only give a few
brief, notes from MR. ARDEN's Paper on the “Mummy of an Egyptian
Qat,” exhumed for the occasion from the mummy pits of Thebes,
When we reflect that the Association—national in its objects—travelled
to Worcester to instruct the natives in the antiquarian wealth of the
locality, we may ask, why travel with a Cat from Eygpt? But we put
no such query. And for this reason: let our Archæºlogist do what he

Or it.

MR. ARDEN unrolled the Cat, to the breathless attention of a crowded
room. The most ancient inhabitant of Worcester does not recollect
so many old women brought together upon any one occasion..." Egypt.”
said the learned Professor, “might be called the Paradise of Cats. It
was well known that the Egyptians held the Cow in reverence: and for
this reason, for the milk which the animals supplied to the Cats. Above
the great Cat-mummy-pit of Thebes was written in the picture language
of the olden, time, this sentence—"Egypt expects every Cat, to catch
her, mouse; a sentence,”—said the learned Professor—“not that he
wished to allude to politics—a sentence that might be transferred even
to the offices of Downing Street. He, however, would not be led from
Science by party. It was plain—from indisputable marks known to
the Professor—that the stock of the Cat before them had come in
with the Shepherd Kings; that it passed from the hands of Isis to
the lap of Osiris; then appeared in Heliopolis, passed on to El-
Karnac, came down the Cydnus with CLEoPATRA in her barge, and
on her death, the individual specimen that the Professor had had the
honour of unrolling before the assembled, intelligence of Worcester,
had become the property of a fortune-teller in Thebes, and died in
her service. There could be no doubt that from the Cat in question
descended Puss-in-Boots and Puss-in-the-Corner.” Several hearty
rounds of applause rewarded the research of the lecturer; every-body
feeling that a mummy from Egypt was a subject quite at home in the
county of Worcestershire. -
. The Association next day proceeded to, Malvern for a practical
inquiry into the sº of the springs that supply the lymph for
the cold-water cure. hen, our reporter quitted, the President and
several Professors were left in a sitz-bath, and MR. ARDEN himself

SKETCHES
IN FRESH AND SALT WATER.
BY THE BUOY AT THE NORE.
EFoRE landing at Ramsgate it will do your
heart good—(if the weather has not been
too rough)—to look up at the long line of
happy faces that is drawn along the pier
purposely to see you come in. They are al
smiling; some are welcoming friends, some
are recognising old acquaintances, whilst
A here and there a young wife is flourishing a
A cambric handkerchief, which a gentleman
on board returns with a most excited stick.
It is easy to see he is the husband, for the
young lady takes a live baby from the arms
of a fat nurse, and holds it up to him. The
delight of the gentleman knows no bounds.
He makes all sorts of ugly faces, claps his
hands, smacks his lips, as if he longed to kiss something, and indulges
in a variety of chuckles pronounceable only by frantic papas. The baby,
however, is very ungrateful, for it does nothing but scream, and has to
be carried away, at last, by the fat nurse.
The scene is very different in the morning. The bustle is sometimes
amusing; a band-box thrown from the pier occasionally creates a laugh
when a wig flies out of it, but the faces of those both going and
remaining seem much more likely to cry than to laugh. The husband
goes, away quite sullen, kisses his darling “Ducky,” as if he were
about to be launched into eternity instead of the Duchess of Kent,
scarcely notices the baby, and has to jump on the paddle-box to save his
sage. How different his sensations when he arrived, even though
e had the week's housekeeping money in his che ue bookſ
In walking through the bow-windowed streets of Ramsgate, nothing
strikes a person so much as the open-door and open-window life the
inhabitants—I mean the lodgers—lead. Any one could walk into the
passage and help himself to whichever hat or coat he pleased, or elope
with the best hoop, or spade, or trap, his juvenile fancy chose to play
with. Families pick their shrimps and mend their stockings in public,
uite ujº the public eye, and seem quite proud to lay before
the noses of the hungry multitude every dish of their three courses
and dessert. The sight is agreeable enough before dinner—for English-
men never look so pleasant as when they are eating and drinking—
but it has its inconveniences when one has already dined; and you
wonder, on glancing at a plate almost breaking with the load of
meat, currant-jelly, and vegetables, “how persons can eat so.” The
hospitality, too, I am ashamed to say, exists all inside. I was never
once asked to step in and take a snack, or even as much as stopped with
the inquiry if I would have a glass of wine? How the poor beggars
endure it, I don't know. The torture of TANTALUs must be a feast to it.
Talking of beggars, Ramsgate is surely their Paradise. The numbers
that have embarked in the trade quite beggars belief.. The item of
“Charities,” every week, in the domestic bills, must be something
fearful. It really says a great deal for the ladies, but a great deal more
for their husbands; for it is evident that every penny that comes out of
the lady's reticule, is at least twopence out of the gentleman's pocket.
These beggars are not restricted to Englishmen, but take in every shade
of foreigners, from the German who looks as if he came from Saffron
Hill, down to the Italian boys, those young imps of darkness, who seem
as if they washed in blacking, and who, since WARREN is in my mouth,
cannot circulate less, I am sure, than Ten Thousand a Fear.
Perhaps, however, the musicians beat the beggars in numbers. Never
was hurdy-gurdyism carried to such a loud extent. You are pulled up
at every corner by a wandering band, who immediately commence an
overture for a penny; and sometimes you are stopped short in the
middle of a narrow street, and obliged to stop till the trombone has
pulled in “its linked sweetness long drawn out,” before you are able to
pass. You certainly have too much bad music at Ramsgate, and not
*} of the good. This superabundance of discord may account for the
“Green-baize Band” being so little supported that, when it performs on
the parade, it is obliged to write upon its music stand, “Supported by
Flºy contributions.” This is most beggarly for the rich Isle of
ancº.
The street cries, also, are another crying evil, which, if it only cried
half so loudly for redress as it does for “Muffins,” would not be
tolerated a single minute. They begin crying at eight o'clock. It is
then “Live Mackerel!” At nine, it is “Fresh H-eels, " . At noon
you are surfeited for hours with “Plum, Seed, and Pound-cake.” After
that comes the “Sweet-stuff,” which, at the sound of a bell, you are told
“Only one penny an ounce is the price,
If you taste them but once, you'll want more, they're so nice.”
After the “Sweet-stuff” come the “Fine Fresh Shrimps” which were
not sold, yesterday; and these are succeeded by a round of “Nice
Muffins,” with which crisis you are sent to bed, to sleep if you can.
The only escape from these continual cries is a bathing-machine. For
myself, I am naturally very fond of bathing, but I must say I do not
like it under a powerſul array of telescopes. . Now the bathing at
Ramsgate is on the sands. The ladies congregate there of a morning
and there is generally a band of music. The-scene is very pretty; an
really, if the sea was not there, and the band would play a little better,
you might, fancy, yourself in Kensington Gardens. To complete the
delusion, dirty chairs are let out at a penny a-piece. The ladies
generally have a penn'orth, and the resultis, that the whole surface of
the beach is covered with the most lovely bonnets and parasols. There
they sit till luncheon calls them away, or some Cockney horseman puts

Berlin wool, a few perform CANUTE in defiance of wet feet, and the
remainder hold the last fashionable novel in their hands, but still every
one of them are looking intently at the sea, and several of them—it’s
the naked truth—looking through telescopes I wished to bathe, but
I had not the courage—I mean the impudence. The next morning the
concourse was even greater. I threw up the sea in despair. Imagine
a wide amphitheatre of , chairs—a group of bathing-machines, right
opposite—and not more than four yards of water to divide the two—
imagine this, and you have the delicacy of Ramsgate brought at one
view before you. I quite admired one old lady, who used to turn her
back every morning upon the sea, and all that was in it.
The sand, I need not tell you, is very soft. It is curious to notice
how the weight of people acts upon the legs of the different chairs.
Qne corpulent gentleman kept sinking and sinking, till his knees were
far above his head, and he would have sunk altogether perhaps, if he
had not been extra- –
cated in time; for the
old fellow was so fat
that he could not rise |
without the assistance
of two people.
I send you a curious
cartoon I found on the
sands. It is a very ."

saw such a picture
of a selfish man at
Ramsgate! He was
sitting on the trunk of
a tree, eating a pine-apple, all by himself! Some five or six little boys
were ſº round him, staring with eyes that plainly said, “Oh! give
us a bit.”. Slice after slice disappeared, they still kept watching, but
not a bit did he give to any one of them. That manate a whole pine—
no, I make a mistake, he threw away the stalk.
The Marquee is a large tent on a mound one foot high. Occasionally
a big wave rushes in, and carries off a newspaper to the Goodwin Sands.
It is worth while being in the Marquee, not when the ocean enters,
but when the newsman bursts in with the morning papers. The whole
room immediately rushes at him, and if he did not throw the papers into
the middle of the room, and quickly run away, he would infallibly be
torn to pieces. It is a tragedy in half a minute.
The most curious thing to be seen at Ramsgate is the Gothic house
on the Parade. It belongs, I was informed, to MR. PUGIN, the architect.
Report speaks most highly of the courtesy of this gentleman in showing
his rooms to strangers, and speaks still more highly of the perfect taste
with which every article of domestic use has been bent, kitchen pokers
included, to the caprices of Gothic ornament. I had a private view
º one of the windows, which happened, in accordance with the
law of this place, to be open. It was the Study, and such a study for
a gentleman, so handsome, and yet so comfortable, I never before
beheld. Everything, of course, was Gothic, and I was º surprised
at the luxurious, rich effect. A person was sitting inside: I ..
to see him Gothic also, but he was dressed like any other gentleman.
I could not help noticing, whilst prosecuting my Paul Pry view, (which
I hope MR. PUGIN, in the same friendly view, will overlook,) that the
Gothic paper and curtains bore the motto “Gºu abant.” Now, situated
as the House is, not more than six small feet from the sea, it will never
do for the walls to be moved with this spirit, for if they do attempt
to go “ºn abant,” the house most assuredly goes over the Cliff.
By the bye, does the motto quite keep pace with the style of archi-
tecture the house is evidently built to revive? It strikes me that in
running after the Gothic, the motto ought rather to be “Cn arriere.”
However, I hope the house will neither go backwards nor forwards,
but will always maintain just the same place in the estimation of those
who are lucky enough to see it, even if, like myself, it is only through
an open window. - - -
A great number of people visit Ramsgate for its beautiful sea, its
smooth sands (when weeded of the bathing-machines), and its quiet
walks, and stroll about, not so much for amusement as for health. A

proof of this may be seen in the long row of easy chairs that are drawn
out, like a cabstand—only the horses are men—on the cliff near the
Clifton Baths, all waiting for a fare. On a warm day (when there is
one) there is not a chair left.
The great attraction is the Library, where hundreds resort of an
evening to hear “One, two, three, four, five, six,” shuffled about in all
manner of ways, to induce young people to invest their shillings in
sweepstakes. The noise of the dice is accompanied by the perpetual
f. ling of a dull piano, which is stopt every now and then for the
umming of a love-song. Qne, singer, “from the Nobility's Concerts,”

would exclaim, “There’s that horrid MR. Jones . Was it his
style of singing? I doubt it, for the young men would only laugh during
an interminable roulade, and cry out “Beautiful!” and “Bravo!” in
the most good-humoured manner. However, Jones's popularity and
his encores went on increasing every night, till the Librarian called
aside the recognised leader at Ramsgate of the young gents' fashions
(he is in the Guards), and said to him imploringly, “My dear Sir, pra

George's Column, directs an explosive crash of music that subsides as
soon as the Roman candles are nearly burnt out, into a cry of “Hats

FORCE OF STATISTICS.
| OUR old friends of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science are at it again, and the Statistical Section is coming out with
unusual strength, to an extent that would induce us to believe of some
of the members, that
“They lisped in numbers, for the numbers came,”
It is astonishing what Statistics may be made to do by a judicious
|and artist-like grouping of the figures; for though they appear to begin
with a limited application to one subject, there is no end to the mass
of topics that may be dragged in collaterally on all sides. A few facts
= on mendicancy, introduced by one of the members, became the cue for
|an elaborate, calculation of how many meals had been given to Irish
| beggars in the last twenty years; and this was very near leading to a
division of the meals into mouthfuls, with a table showing the number
of teeth, subtracting the molars and taking out the canine, employed in
the mastication of these twenty years' returns of meals.
Returns were also threatened of the whole number of mealy-mouthed
Irish mendicants within the same period; and an analytical catalogue
distinguishing mere gruel from grub in its ordinary acceptation, an
showing the numbers of those who had wanted grub merely to assist
them in the process of grubbingon. This led to an elaborate disquisition
on potatoes, in which the parings were compared on the principle of
pares pariºus, and the result showed that when two potatoes had been
stripped of their jackets, they were so very unlike each other, that they
...?. be said to be pared but not matched. - -
The great utility of this kind of research and calculation is so very
obvious, that we need not point out, the value of the labours ºf our
scientific friends, whose large returns have been ill-maturedly said to be
productive of very small profits indeed.

Not content with the wonders the
Electric Telegraph performs

in announcing outbreaks-aye,
and making them also, now

posed to apply its powers, to
the operations of every-day
life, and to carry on o

Electric Telegraph. We have
heard of a singer's voice being
rather wiry at times; but there

would be something electric in the affair to compensate for the absence
of the feu sacré that poets celebrate.
It has been suggested, also, that this new method of being able to
:Give your orders, gentlemen,” when it does not happen that the
“waiter's in the room,” will enable ºnervous men who dislike servants”

the Deys of Algiers, and several other days, have irretrievably gone-

LETTERS TO A NOBLEMAN VISITING IRELAND.
the time this affectionate letter
reaches your Lordship, you will
have had an opportunity of per-
sonally inspecting that beautiful
Island of Ireland, which occu-
pies us so much, and which we
all love so. I also have had the
good fortune to see it, and have
my own sentiments regarding it,
sentiments which I will gladly
confide to your Lordship's
private ear, and which I have
no doubt will become general
in England before long, how-
ever unpopular they may at
present be.
- “However, you are at head
quarters, and can get at the
actual truth about Ireland from the people themselves. Indeed, I don’t
know anything so easy to get at in Ireland. I should say if there was
any one virtue which characterised the people, a love of truth was that
merit. You may, if you like, rely upon every single word that every
single Irishman tells you, and placing implicit credit in their statements,
the task of governing them will become both easy and pleasant. It was
by a steady perseverance in the truth, and a skilful arrangement of facts
that the great O'Conn ELL attained his influence over ; enlightened
countrymen. But why enlarge on this? You yourself, my Lord, knew,
and were fond of that great man. You gave his sons places, made
himself offers of preferment; and when by a combination of misfortunes
he was locked up in gaol, your party nobly aided in letting him out of
s-
S
s
º
§
;
prison.
“You will find the respected Roman Catholic clergymen distinguished
for straightforwardness and candour. Their conduct throughout the
late disturbances has been frank and manly: I, protest, for instance, I
know nothing more amiable than the interposition of the Tuam clergy
apropos of the late great rebellion. Modesty, Truth, and Charity figure
in every line of their composition.
“‘Rest assured, the heart of Ireland is sound and true towards your Gracious
Majesty—hence we implore, we intreat, nay, we most humbly beg—‘no blood;’ and
as ministers of religion, whose sacred duty it is to inculcate peace and good will
amongst men, we further beg to assure your Majesty that the concession of the
prayer of this our petition shall be an additional stimulant to us to uphold the laws,
and to secure, even at the sacrifice of our lives, the stability of that Throne which is
so happily occupied by your Most Gracious Majesty.”
“No, mo, “no blood;’ their Reverences can’t bear it; and our govern-
ment must forego its known desire for shedding it. , No, ‘no blood;’
let those good folks rescue the lambs from the butcher. “Even at the
sacrifice of their lives’ they will be loyal. See with what generous
openness they speak—without arrière-pensée. They will be loyal, what-
ever you can do. Though you were to shoot half of them (and you know
ou have some notion of the kind), the rest would sing ‘Domine salrum.”
o, no blood; restrain your appetite for it, too truculent and sanguinary
statesman
“I would suggest a little more than a mere forbearance of revenge—I
would conciliate. I would have the officer broke, for example, of whom
MR. MAHER complained for having drilled in his grounds, and dared to
otect his property, at Thurles. I would have the policemen shot who
red upon those honest fellows at Boulagh Common. Compensations
ought to be given to the innocent victims who fell, there. And some-
thing handsome should be done for the leaders, under whom the people
‘declined to act.’ Send the young gentlemen of PIM's out of gaol, with
leave to wear their uniforms behind the counter; let the colonels and
field-officers of the (so called) rebel army retire on half-pay—but no
blood. Odds butchers and shambles! No blood. If we English have
a fault, it is that love of murder—and on whom do we practise it? ...On
a most innocent, simple, loyal, jury-loving, truth-telling, pike-hating,
pistol-loathing, blunderbuss-dreading people, that never harboured a
thought of evil.
“I propose that the Irish Chartists, who are doing us the favour to
assist our native-bred patriots with their counsels and their valour
should also be handsomely provided for. By heavens, Sir, I see no en
to the benefits which a union with them confers upon our country!
“During your visit, and as there is no food, in Ireland to last the
people beyond January, I hope you will call the Irish gentry together,
and get from them a round statement of the sum which they would like
us to pay for the next year's maintenance of their people. There is
nothing like having a fair statement of accounts. Let it be well under-
stood in England that we are to support the Irish for the next ten,
twenty, hundred years, (for indeed there is no end to the ºl.

and apportion our rations to the number of feeders. If for the rest of
my working days I am to have the inestimable pleasure of receiving a

grateful and agreeable Irishman every day at my dinner, let me know,
so that means may be got ready to accommodate this charming boarder.
“Repeal the Union, indeed! Restore the Heptarchy! Let it be
well understood that we will never part from the Irish, and that we are
prepared to feed them for ever and ever. No, Sir; we won't part with
the Emerald Gem of the Western Wave, which now forms the
brightest Jewel of the British Crown.
“By the way, in personally inspecting it, your º will
remember how, eighty years since, LöRD CHATHAM declared the North
American Colonies to be the most elegant ornaments of, the diadem in
question; and that our utter national smash and annihilation would
ensue, if we lost those appendages.
“Now it is certain that in spite of the above prophecy, the English
empire is not a bit the less handsome, splendid, or yaluable, although
these Colonies are taken from it: that it is a thousand times more pleasant
and profitable to us to trade with the United States, than to bully the

well off as we are at this moment of time. -
“Suppose anybody were to offer us back Normandy, and Picardy,

prº I wish the Irishman every possible freedom and prosperity. I will
give him sixpence with all the pleasure in life; but in exchange for a
fair sixpennyworth of wheat, pork or butter. Last year I, gave him
money out of my pocket, and was cursed for my pains. I will do so no
more; never more. I prefer a quiet life, and have my own kindred to
help out of my superfluity. I say, in these hard times you have no right
to say to us, ‘Keep your house, your servants, your family, and your
Irishman.’ Why am I to keep an Irishman? He threatens me as he
clutches my bread; he hates and insults me as I try to do him good.
Isn't work scarce enough and life hard, but that every Englishman, in
addition to his own burthens, is to have this howling, cursing Irish
beggar on his back? What has reduced him to this state is not the
question: what fault of ours or of his own, what clumsy tyranny of the
State, what stealthy priestly inquisition, what coarse cruelty and
insolence of landlords, what native fallings—virtues even (for it seems
to me as if the Irish virtues are, like their faults, quite different to
ours)—have helped the degradation of this fatal people, what faults of
our fathers' or theirs, have produced this woful state, is not the
question. But there it is. There is your Irishnan as you have made

your English press as an incentive to rebellion, and as a means for

box with perjury; he evades, your English laws with, lies, 9r combats
them with murder. Do you intend to alter our English institutions for
his benefit, or to continue the not-governing him under our own?, Are we
to go on for ever in our present condition, we paying and grumbling, he

of our forefathers a right to bind us to this monstrous calamity? As

We have heard a good deal of the beauty of the Blenheim breed;
but we cannot say much for the Blenheim breeding, if we are to judge
of it from the specimen exhibited by that surly dog, the Cerberus of
the establishment. A correspondent of the Times has given a striking
picture of his escape from imprisonment, which he ran the risk of
encountering upon his refusal to º the demand that was made upon
him by that insatiable Ogre in plush breeches. It will be desirable never
to go hº to this abode of flunkeyian extortion and insolence;
for if the black-mail of half-a-crown perhead is not paid, incarceration—
perhaps solitary incarceration-will be the doom of the unhappy traveller.
If this should occur, the fate of the unfortunate will resemble that
of the banished noble in the melodrama, who is “discovered” as the
curtain goes up, ºf in a complete suit of fetters, with a jug on
one side, and a canvas loaf on the other, ºf that for fourteen
long years, “these”—meaning the pitcher and the tea-cake—“have
been his only friends—his only sustenance.” We hope that when the
subject of imprisonment comes before Parliament, some attention will
be paid to the question whether imprisonment by the Blenheim porter
should be retained in our list of punishments.

We laughed at the French for making ditches merely to fill them up
again, yet we have seen just as great an absurdity in the streets of
London. All last week, watering-carts, when it was pouring the most
multitudinous cats and dogs, were quietly going up and down our
principal thoroughfares. The more it rained, the more industrious
they were. Never before was the water laid on London at such an awful
rate!. The gutters were working double tides...We think the English
watering-carts beat the French ditches in absurdity, hollow.

THE SALE OF THE SEASON.
of Essen as well as unforeseen causes haveled to the sale of
the Duke of BUCKINGHAM's effects at Stowe. It is not
generally known that MR. DuNUP has been compelled to
stow it, and endure the humiliation of a sale by auction on
his premises. . It is sad to reflect that a number of
- objects, º: together with the greatest ingenuity
—for how he got the tradespeople to send the articles in is really
surprising—should be in a few days disseised, and that the hammer
should scatter abroad what the ninny-hammers—we mean the creditors
—have contributed. - -
The sale has, however, excited the greatest interest, and we will
briefly mention a few of the lots that were the subjects of the most
active competition. - -
Lot 9. Five pots of antico giallo, or ancient jelly, which has been
reserved from-or rather over—the kitchen-fire, in the year 1842.
#. lot was eagerly sought for until it was ultimately knocked down
by the negligence of one of the porters. -
Lot 14, MR. DUNUP's shaving tazza, representing PRINCE ALBERT
in tin, with the alphabet in ºf all round his hat, and a similar tazza
to match, representing HER MAJESTY in the same precious metal, with
the figures from 1 to 10 surrounding her head by way, of a diadem.
This lot was bought for a celebrated hard-bake house in the City. .
Lot 26. A rare old, MS., consisting of a promissory note for six
pounds ten shillings, which, according to a tradition of rather doubtful
authority, had actually been paid on the day it was due, by an ancestor
of MR. 3. This lot was purchased for eighteenpence, by the
Trustees of the Houndsditch Museum. -
Lot 80. One of the identical Italian irons that the Italians, when
they threw of their irons, were supposed to have got rid of. This lot
was purchased for the Pope, by Pope, the Kensington carrier, at the
rate of ninepence a hundred weight: - -
L91 94, MR. DuNUP's favourite horse, upon which he used to give
an airing to all his linen. This lot was nearly the cause of bringing the
sale to a stand-still, for the horse could not be got to go at any price.
Lot 98. An easy chair, used by MR. DuNur when in easy circum-
stances, but subsequently in the possession of the Sheriff of Middlesex.
This lot, which was ultimately purchased for amere song by a celebrated
vocalist, concluded the day's proceedings,
The following Conditions of Sale were attached to the printed
Catalogue, and we add them as a curiosity, almost equal in value to
some of the objets included among MR, DUNUP's property.
Cuntitions of £ale.
1st. Every purchaser to become the buyer, and the Auctioneer to do every
bidder's bidding.
2nd. If a dispute should arise between two or more bidders, and before the
Lot is knocked down, one of them should knock the other down, the
property will be withdrawn from competition.
Every Lot to be taken as it stands, unless it be a chair or table without
legs, when it must be taken notwithstanding,
If after an article has been sold, it should be found that there is no
such article in the Sale, half the Deposit will be returned to the
purchaser, after deducting from the other half the Auctioneer's Com-
mission, amounting to 40 per cent, and 60 per cent, for preliminary,
intermediate, and subsequent expenses.
The Lots must be cleared by the purchasers, but if the Lots cannot
be found, and confusion should arise, the room will be cleared by the
police, in a summary manner.

“ MILKING THE BULL.”
His is generally, considered to be a hopeless process, a
synonym, in fact, for labour in vain. -
to the j profit of all who like to apply themselves to
his well-stored udder.
The Committee of Supply brings out curious evidence of
- the quantity this patient animal produces of that cream
of the milk of human kindness, which mantles in the pale of society-
we mean money—and of the odd rays in which the nutritious product
is distributed. There is ". a country in Europe but furnishes its
calves to suck this great, good-humoured Bull. The distressed Poles
drain to the tune of an annual £10,000, St., Domingo sufferers, and
Corsican emigrants (Who the deuce can they be?) absorb their driblet
of he KING of THE BELGIANs is “a ºf. suck” to the
amount of we don't know how many hundreds or thousands, for travel-
ling expenses. This item accounts. for the extraordinary, propensity
to gad *: about which we have noticed in this monarch, who ought to
contest the title of Railway King with MR. Hunson. It turns out
that JoHN BULL pays his fares: it appears to us that he ought to go
further and fare worse, before we pay another farthing for his railway
and steamboat tickets.
Besides, there is the King of Abyssinia, who comes in for a drop of
comfort, in the shape of for presents, this year. This is too bad!
As if John BULL had not already European pulls enough on him, they
must go to the interior of Africa for black leeches, to bleed the poor
overwrought, old fellow with. The worst of it is, that this poor dear
old Bull, with all his stupidity, is the best tempered of horned cattle.
He would willingly meet all the demands upon him from calves of his
own seed, breed, and generation. These surround his pen, meagre and
melancholious, their bones showing through their hides, lowing for the
milk that they see carted off by pailfuls to feed Polish, and Belgian,
and Corsican, and Abyssinian, and—ARRowsMITH only knows what
outlandish cattle!

“DEEP REGRET' OF THE “MORNING POST.”
He Morning Post is the conscience-keeper, of high life.
sº It is the happy privilege of that journal to feel with
PE the acutest . any domestic accident that may
- occur at the West-End. Its heart-strings are bound
up with the heart of the haut ton, and if a Duke has
the vapours, JENKINs, in sympathetic duty bound, is
terribly out of sorts. We all remember, the Agony
of the Post upon a certain runaway match. It felt
the indiscretion as something personal. As BARRY CoRNWALL some-
where says:- “ — that single fault
Went blushing down a line of Posts / "
We never expected our contemporary to hold up, his powdered head
again; but, he took heart! the match was pardoned by the parties, in:
terested, and the Post did not go into mourning. However, a few days
since, the Post was again plunged into grief by a “painful occurrence”
in high life:–
“we hear, with deep regret, that a lady of high rank, both by birth and marriage,
has within the last few days mysteriously absented herself from the residence of her
noble husband, in consequence, as it is supposed, of distressing domestic disagree-
ments. A variety of details have reached us, but, in deference to the feelings of all con-
cerned, we refrain from mentioning them in the present state of the unfortunate
circumstances.”
.The deference is very touching—extremely delicate. Jenkins poke:
his nose into a family circle, proclaims, tº the world—“Oh yes, oh yes!
a domestic disagreement—lady absented herself from her husband-
variety of details—feelings,” &c. &c., and then, with the resolution of
a martyr, resolves that, for the present, not another word shall escape
him. ethink it impossible for even JENKINs—(for PAN is not dead)
—to maintain a more dignified politeness.

IRISH UnANIMITY.
UNANIMIty in Ireland seems to consist in differing. This should be
taken into account when a jury returns averdict; and when the foreman
states that the jury cannot agree, the judge should take it for granted
that they are perſectly unanimous, and convict or acquit the prisoner
accordingly.

GET you gone ! Turnout! Depart! Go along with you! Tramp! Start!
Close your Session—and a pretty one you’ve passed!
Vanish. Toddle ! There’s the door!—what you should have done before,
Go about your business, Gentlemen, at last.
Stop though—ere you disappear, it is well that you should hear
Just a word or two that I have got to say
As the spokesman of the nation, of intense disapprobation
Of the mode in which you’ve thrown your time away.
You a house of legislators? Bah! a pack of idle praters,
- Do you call yourselves a Parliament? What, you ?
Fok a Parliament? A flam, a deceit, imposture, sham,
An unqualified unmitigated “do!”
After full nine months' gestation, in the way of legislation,
Is there any thing to which you’ve given birth P
Yes—the Sanitary Act—mutilated, clipp'd, and hack'd,
Nothing else of any consequence on Earth.
Ab J. you well may feel ashamed of that measure mauled and maimed,
Of that inefficient, miserable Bill,
Which has left its work half undone in permitting noisome London,
Filthy City, to continue filthy still.
Scarce one movement of progression have you made this blessed Session,
Scarce a single pledge or º have you kept;
Not one expectation answer'd, and for all I find in HANsaRD,
It appears that you might just as well have slept.
Your attention, 'twas expected, would be first of all directed
To the question of the Currency, for one;
You referr'd it to Committee, which concluded—'twas a pity,
But unfortunately nothing could be done.
S T. S. T E P H E N’S 1
Then your next great end of meeting was some remedy for treating
Ireland's complicated evils to invent; -
And your course has been reversion to the system of coercion,
Of repressing, not removing, discontent.
After Ireland and its shindies came the state of the West Indies,
Where our colonists are likely to go smash; - -
It was trusted that your cares would have settled their affairs;
I believe you’ve settled nothing but their hash.
Your interminable jaws on the Navigation Laws,
Which I understood that you were to amend,..
Are postponed, and I may say, that's the Irish kind of way
That your sage deliberations mostly end.
What's the reason? Talk and chatter, always foreign to the matter,
Recrimination, disputation loose, -
Whilst irrelevant discussion, upon Eastern or on Russian
Questions, URquhart and his ANSTEY introduce.
Talk of gagging Chartist spouters! Gag your own—those out-and-outers
Who five mortal hours stand raving at a pull; -
What you want’s another BURKE, to * that hinder work,
To the detriment and damage of John BULL.
Well, your palaver’s finish'd, with taxation undiminish'd,
On the other hand you've added to the Debt: .
Now, when you have ponder'd duly on the question, tell me, truly,
Don’t you think you are a very pretty set
But enough 1 Decamp Be quick, ere I help you with a kick |

PLAYHOUSE PROSPECTS.
INGULAR reports are
flying about the draw-
ing-rooms of England
- that the English Drama
- ) is to rise refreshed and
strengthened for a long
| run. The QUEEN her-
self proposes to take
SHAkspeaRE by the
hand, and lift him on
his legs again. This
is very commendable;
and the noble influence of high example will of course be felt through-
out high places. Not that we should despair of the vitality of the
Drama, even were it not nursed—as BARoN said—on the knees of
Royalty, and fed with daintiest patronage in Windsor Castle. Never-
theless, that the QUEEN, even at a somewhat late hour, should order a
theatre to be built in her J. that she may hold a review of the
players, is a very grateful self-assertion, on her part, against the folks
who accuse the House of Hanover of a coldness of the heart towards
the Drama and letters in general.
We understand that levies are to be made ". the various theatres,
that they may send their best tragedy, their best light comedy, their
best broad farce; in fact, a sample of every quality. Thus, it is not
improbable that,even the acknowledged heroine of Domestic Tragedy
may spasmodically twirl her mop in the countenance of Royalty! The
stage-management devolves upon MR. CHARLEs KEAN, who, it is
whispered, will be knighted (for six nights only) for the occasion. The
audience will, of course, be very select, very distinguished, though orders
*H. of the Garter, Bath, and Thistle) will be admitted.
aving spoken of the Theatre Royal Windsor Castle, let us descend
to the regular houses. . The Haymarket—the Adelphi Inimitables
having withdrawn—is to be thoroughly trimmed up and burnished. It
has, however, been suggested that, just to sweeten the house from such
nastiness as the burlesque of Norma, it would be as well to burn two or
three copies of The Critic and the Beggar's Opera, to cleanse the boards
from the contagious properties that may otherwise hang about them.
MR. PAUL BEDFord's white gown we would have burnt in the Old
Bailey, as some expiation for the offence committed upon the gentle
creatures born to petticoats. There are, it is said, to §. new artistic
developments and new faces at the Haymarket, with new plays (not
from JEFFs' of the Burlington). MR. Charles KEAN is to make a
dash at Comedy, and has been already measured for a pair of handsome
socks. MRs. C. KEAN, who sheds grace and gentleness upon merest
common-place, will, it is whispered, now and then play in little pieces.

“pearled wrists” alike in serious Play and Comedy. , JAMEs WALLACK
has expressly laid in a lasting stock of good health and spirits wherewith
to act and “manage.” FARREN retires for a while to Madeira, where,
it is said, he has purchased a magnificent orangery and vineyards; (at
least, this is the report, though only our f. the Observer knows if
it be really true or not).
We have not heard whether the Lyceum is to be newly decorated.
We should think not. They will not attempt to paint the lily. And for
ieces, in our worst greediness we can only hope for as good fare as we
ad last year; better (of its kind) it cannot be.
The Princess's—there is circumstantial evidence of the fact—will
open with new decorative splendour, and with º of alarming
interest. For we have it upon the best authority that, only last week,
2lbs. of rose-pink, and one whole book of Dutch metal, were sent in to
the painting-room, and a bundle of French plays from MR. JEFFs, to
the private sanctuary of the “spirited and indefatigable proprietor.”
There are fitful whisperings of the proposed doings of a distinguished
Bard at Covent Garden; but we will not blow the trumpet of idle
rumour. We must, however, take proper notice of a cruel expression
of barbarity, employed by the creature in human form who drew up
the last annual Drury Lane Report. Poor JULLIEN (flayed and bleeding
from the Philistines) has left the Court of Bankruptcy with nothing
but honour. And what is the aspiration of the Committee ? Listen—
“The Committee expresses a hope that M. Jullien will persevere in his endea-
vours to render Drury Lane a means by which the Drama may once more be
restored to it.”
Now, this properly translated, runs as follows:– “The Committee
express a hope that as soon as M. JULLIEN shall be covered with a new
skin, he will persevere in his endeavours to be once more flayed alive.”
Take Care of your Pockets.
WE take the following from the papers:–
“The rumour that Stowe will be bought for the PRINCE or WALEs gains ground.
The Inspector of Palaces has made a minute examination of the Mansion.”
Well, we can only end as we began—“Take Care of your Pockets.”
NEW SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
THE Zodiac may be improved. The Gemini should be represented
henceforth by those Siamese twins, MEssrs. ANSTEY and URQUHART.
Taurus, too, might be the Pope's Bull, which has frightened the
Gemini so much fº. We hope these corrections will be made in the
next year's lease of the Zodiac.

THE MODEL WAITER.
D VERY Model Waiter is single, of course. What
time has he to make love, excepting to the cook,
and she is hot-tempered and cross, as all tavern-
cooks are; and he i. far too many spoons to look
after, to think of increasing his responsibilities
with a family of children.
... He is always “Coming ! coming” but rather,
like the auctioneer, he is always “Going ! going !
gone !” for he no sooner jerks out “Coming !”
than he bolts out of the room. Ask him for his
- name. It is “BOB,” or “CHARRRLEs.” The
Waiter never has a surname. He takes his dinner
how he can, off the sideboard, or a chair in the passage. If he is very
busy, he has no dinner at all. He approaches his plate to steal a
mouthful, when fifty shouts of “Waitar /* call him away. Of many
contending cries, he attends to that of “Money,” first.
The MoDEL WAITER never says I. He is quite editorial, and always
says We—as, “We’re very full at present, Sir. We had two hundred
dinners yesterday, Sir, and three hundred and thirty-five suppers. We
consume one hundred and sixty-nine rabbits º every night, Sir.”
He puts a “Sir” on to everything, and an odd penny, if the same comes
to an exact shilling. “Chop? yes, Sir, sixpence. Potatoes?...yes, Sir,
tuppence. Beer P exactly Sir, tuppence; and Bread yes, Sir, makes
tenpence; and tuppence makes thirteenpence—precisely one and a
penny, Sir.” His favourite word is “nice.” He recommends “a nice
chop with a nice glass of half-and-half;” or he says, “You’ll find that a
nice glass of port, Sir ;” or, “It’s the nicest breast he ever saw.” He
can unravel the mysteries of Bradshaw, without turning over every one
of the tables two or three times; and he knows all the playbills of the
evening by heart. He never calls a slice of Stilton “a cheese.”
He is impartial in the distribution of the “paper,” and gives the
middle sheet invariably to him who has eaten the most dinners in the
house. He shows no favour, either, with the evening papers, but
awards them first to those who are drinking wine, to the spirits next,
whilst to the beer he gives the Supplement of yesterday's Times.
His shoes are perfect fellows, with upright heels, and the strings are
carefully tied; and his handkerchief so white, it would do credit to a
pet parson in the heart of Belgravia. He has “everything in the house”
till, you cross-examine him, when the “everything” sinks down to a
“nice chop or tender steak, Sir.” The joint is always in “very good
cut,” and . only been up these two minutes. He is mute for a penny,
says “Thank ye, Sir,” for twopence, and helps on your coat for every-
thing above it... Politics have no charm for him, and he never looks at
a paper, excepting when he is waiting for the last customer, and is
tired of killing flies. The only news that interest him are the “Want
Places,” and the pictures. He is good-humoured, and laughs at any
joke, even those of a Fast Man. A stranger in his vocabulary is a
“party.” He talks of persons according to the boxes they sit in, and
cuts down all gentlemen to “gents.” He is not mean with his mustard
or the vinegar cruets, and does not hide them in a dark corner. He
carries a lofty pillar, quite a falling-tower, of plates, without dropping
anything out of them, and does not spill the gravy down an old gentle-
man's neck. If anything is done to rags, or to a cinder, or under-done,
or not done at all—if the punch is as weak as water, or there’s too much
sugar in it, or it’s as sour as a pew-opener, he bears it all with unruffled
meekness, and only begins wiping down the table with his napkin. If
the wine is too old, or too young, or too fruity, or too tawny, his
waiter's fine instinct tells him at once what the gentleman will like, and
he rushes out furiously in a waiter's gallop to get it, and returns with
something that elicits “Ah! that’s just the thing.” However, as a
general rule, the port has never been less than ten years in bottle. The
cigars, too, are imported direct from the Havannah, and cost us full 32s, a
pound, Sir. We do not clear a farthing by them, Sir.
The MoDEL WAITER very seldom has a holiday. If he does, it is to
see some other waiter, or to help at the Freemasons', or to assist a friend
at some grand dinner in a nobleman's family. His life vibrates between
the kitchen and the parlour, and he never sits down from morning till
long past midnight. He attempts to doze, sometimes, but the loud
chorus of “We won't go home till morning!” wakes him up, and he
execrates in his heart the monster who ever composed that song; it
must have been some wretch, he is sure, who owed a long score to an
unfortunate waiter, who had sued him for it. He makes a faint effort to
turn off the gas, but is repulsed with an unanimous call for “more
kidneys.” It is not wonderful, therefore, if in the morning he yawns
over the knives and forks, and drops several involuntary tears whilst
replenishing the mustard-pot. -
After wearing out innumerable pairs of shoes, a Testimonial is got
up for the Model Waiter by the “Gents of his Room,” and they present
him with a full-length portrait of himself, “as a slight, token of their
warm appreciation of his unfailing civility, cheerful demeanour, and
uniform attention during a term of forty years.” This testimonial
represents him in the act of drawing the cork of one of the ten years'
bottles of port for a party of gentlemen who are sitting in a box in the
cormer of the picture, and who are portraits of MEssRs. BRowN,
ROBINSON, and SMITH, three of the oldest chop-eaters of the house !
It is hung in a glittering frame over the mantelpiece of the room, in and
out of which he has been running for the last F. years, and becomes
the property of the establishment, there being a special clause let in the
frame, that it is never to be removed from the room. The MoDEL
WAITER, however, has been saving a little fortune of pennies during
his long career of chops and steaks—his only extravagances having been
the washing of his white handkerchiefs and Berlin gloves every now and
then on state occasions—and he purchases, in his grey old age, the
business of his landlord, takes unto himself the pretty barmaid as his
wife, and dies without having once been fined for keeping open half a
minute after twelve on a Saturday night, or serving a pint of beer on
Sundays during the hours of divine service. His portrait still hangs
over the mantelpiece as a moral public-house sign to all future waiters,

SIBTHORP'S SPEECHES.
EALLY in a Session like the past, so full of talk and so
empty of wit, it is, after all, very cheering to select one
man who keeps up the old eloquence of St. Stephen's;
one man who is a sort of vestal Colonel, Charged
with the sacred fire. Of course we allude to Colonel
SIBTHORP. . We write this with all that great man’s
&S. speeches before us; and they are worthy to be tolled
by the tongue of his own native Tom, church orator of
Lincoln' We have gone through all the speeches, and we are
º: to give their quintessential properties in the following sparkling
syllables:—
CoLoREL SIBTHORP would not believe the present Ministers on their
oaths. (Laughter.)
CoLoREL SIBTHORP thought LoRD JOHN RUSSELL’s answer most
contemptible. (Much laughter.)
CoLoREL, SIRTHORP said (on the Intramural Burial Clause, in the
Sanitary Bill) he * the whole thing. Like RUTH, where his
father lay, he would lie. He would; for he felt that he was the last
man to be offensive, dead or alive. (Shouts of laughter.)
CoLonel, SIBTHORP (on the Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill) said
he knew what a goose was. (Hear!) Had, moreover, some experience
of what a donkey was. He could lay his hand upon his heart, and say
that. (Loud cheers.) But the wretches opposite—not that he wished
to be personal—the wretches opposite were the greatest of geese, and
the hugest of donkeys. (Screams of laughter.) The Bill was a low
sneaking, paltry, contemptible measure. For his own part, he should
continue to give away blankets like, a man—to broach his ale like a
Christian—and to buy kittens of his constituents like a legislator.
(Loud and continued cheering.)
As many of the gallant Colonel's constituents may desire to possess
the essence of their representative's wisdom for the session, we have
been at the pains of distilling it, for their service. It must be very
precious to the intellectuality of Cathedral Lincoln.

HANDY. PHRENOLOGY.
NEW LOT OF PHRENOLOGICAL CASTS.
A Book recently advertised, called “The Hand, Phrenologically Considered,” developes a new mode of
ascertaining character, by getting it at our fingers'
ends; though, as for ourselves, we are not going to
have humbug palmed upon us in this very off-hand
manner. We shall of course be having a quantity
of plaster-casts, handing down to us the hands of illus-
trious men, whose length of finger will be said to
indicate the grasp of their intellect. We dare say
the hand of WERTHER will be distinguished by its
Werts; and we can imagine that the wrist will be
found fully developed in A-wristotle, A-wrisTIDEs,
and the rest of the a-wristocracy of genius that the
world has contained. We shall in future be ashamed
rather than proud of our delicately and proverbially
white hand, lest it may be thought to show a phre.
mological affinity with the light-fingered tribe; but we
shall look with interest to a fellow-creature's knuckle,
regarding it as a sort of knuckle-us of all his mental
qualities. We have long been familiar with the hand-
organ, yet we were never aware of the existence of
the peculiar organs of the hand, until this new system
was propounded. If the science should be carried to
perfection, it will be easy to detect an “itching palm,”
and the hand that would be ready to serve another at a pinch, might be discovered by the way in which
snuff is taken.

[SIR John TYRRELL presents his ºl. to Punch, and begs he will insert the º in his
cosmopolitan columns. SIR.J., intended to read it in the House of Commons, but had left it at home
in another pocket. As SIR.J. does not live (like a certain noble, Lord) at Richmond, convenient to town,
and as he cannot wait another day for the House, he thinks it best to send the warning where it may most
universally apply. The letter, is evidently written by one of the very industrious classes; one of those
deserving people who sit up all night, and then get up early in the morning to pursue their honest labour.]
“To SIR John TYRRELL.
“RESPECTABLE SIR. John,
“Is it true, Sir, that whether or no, every one of us is to be made to have Relations at Rome *
I, too, Sir, who have kept a §º for twenty Kººi (wife and widow) and never advertised for a
housemaid, that I didn't put at the end in big letters, "No Irish need apply?’ And why? Because, Sir,
it is my solemn belief, like yours, that no boards can be scrubbed—that no fire-irons, can be made to look
decent—no furniture dusted, and no potato biled by anybody as harbours the Catholic Religion. And
that’s why, SIR John.
“Andºnow for an Act of Parliament to make honest housekeepers have Relations at Rome!... (But, as
my poor dead husband used to say, it's just like the Whigs). To compel people whether they will or no—
and against all their argiments of flesh and blood—to have Relations that they never heard of afore, and
if they did, always despised 'em as heartily as if they’d been the poorest relations that ever worried people
well-to-do! But I, and all my street, defy the Government. I †. no relations, as Mrs. MAC THISTLE,

all the wretches aboard, and take
'em out to sea; and when in deep
the bottom of the ship, and so give
peace and quietness to England
and Ireland, besides lightening the
taxes and curing the potatoes? Do
think of it.
“But as for our having Relations

'em. It's all very well to say “at

we once acknowledge.’em as Rela:

DUALITY OF THE CRITICAL MIND.
WE have heard of such exploits as riding upon two horses
at once, and we have been ourselves on speaking terms with a
gallant steam-boat tar, who" did bestride” that little “world,”
his steam-boat, “like a Colossus,” with a leg upon each paddle-
box; but we never met with such a wonderful instance of the
duality of mind as the critic of the Daily News has justafforded
by including in a single critique a couple of performances, on
the same night, at the two Italian Operas. It has been said
that a Reviewer, in the discharge of his duties, should look
neither to the right nor to the left; but here is an instance of
agentleman who must have taken a terrific squint from Covent
Garden to the Haymarket. He must have carried JENNY LIND
in one eye, and wrapped º ALBONI in the other, or he must
have continued running backwards and forwards all night
between the two Operas, like a melo-dramatic connoisseur
whom, we once knew, that was accustomed to oscillate for
a whole evening between the Surrey and the Victoria, for the
purpose of weighing the respective merits of Ix (Anglice,
Hicks) and Saville. -
Often, after ºf Miss VINCENT rescued, from ummerited

The daily critic, whose duality...we have noticed must have
been a F. of this pendulum-like description, for otherwise
he could not possibly have favoured us with his remarks on two
erformances going on simultaneously at two different estab-
É. How he managed to hear God Save the Queen, like
a bidding at an auction, “in two places,” is more than we can

aneurism and an aneurism of the Protestant Church. Is there, SIR
John TYRRELLP
reader's, when we tell him that MR. REYNOLDs
said, a few nights since, that he had never heard
a creed ascribed to cash. He did not think that
pounds, shillings, and pence were Protestant or
Catholic. These were MR. REYNOLDs's sayings
on the Irish Education Debate ; sayings in | *
*- condemnation of a phrase of MR. HAMILTON's. -
- e much regret MR. REYNoLDs's state of
darkness: it is plain he knows nothing of the condition of money.
Why, pounds, #. s, and pence are the Pucks, the Ariels, the Familiars
of mankind. They have feelings, emotions, opinions—yes, religions.
Ask SIR. J. Tº RRELL if he .# give half-a-crown to one of the race
of Catholic Priests, who “ought to be exterminated.” No. ...And
wherefore?.. Because the half-crown so devoted would become a wicked
Catholic half-crown, doing Catholic service. Now, the half-crown in
SIR John's breeches pocket is a sound Church and State half-crown,
(what a full, mellow ring there is in it!)—a two-and-sixpenny worth of
true religion. ..
In our condition of society what so truly represents the feeling of
men as their money?. Is the shilling jingled in the plate at Exeter
Hall, for the conversion of the Jews, the same as the shilling dropt in

BEAUTIES AND BEASTS.
From the Bengal Tiger, Surrey, Gardens, to the Pike and Tow-Ball
Chartists.
oME time ago, my dear friends, it was settled among
us Beasts of the Gardens to open a communication
with the Beauties outside. For though in captivity,
we nevertheless hear all the news through the bars,
and according to our feelings and dispositions sympa-
thise with the two-legged people of the world without.
So to speak it, every Beast, from the Lion to the
Marmoset, has his human Beauty, in whose sayings
and doings he takes a peculiar interest and pleasure.
- You would be surprised did you know with what
deep attention the Parliamentary Debates are attended to-(they are
always read by one of the keepers)—would wonder did you, listen to the
loud laughter of the Hyena, and the “hear! hear!” of the Wild Ass.
Let this much suffice to convince you that, Beasts as we are, we have
our Beauties—our two-legged pets.
“When the news of the fresh tyranny that has fallen upon you was
spread among us, I do assure you that your misfortunes caused the
eepest emotion among all the Carnivora. Perhaps I ought to except
the Lion; but then you know his narrow, monarchical prejudices: he has
been so long mixed up with the Royal Arms that all freshness of feeling
has left him. He has stared so long upon the crown jewels, that he
turns up his whiskers at mere flesh-and-blood with thorough contempt.
The Leopards, too, give themselves airs, and call themselves a part of
the monarchy; but, my dear friends, you have the Hyenas, and the
Panthers, and the Tigers with you to a hair.
“And you are quite worthy of us. You are, indeed. I felt my eyes
turned with admiration to burning topazes when I heard of your plans.
Could I have been changed into human shape, retaining my Tiger heart
with the added gifts of man, it is exactly what I should have done. To
steal out to kill at night ! The very thought of it made my heart jump
up again. How I drew my whiskers stiff as wire, and scented my bloody
rey, as the midnight wind sighed through the jungle ! How, in my
ancy, I paced with you down the silent street, the thoughts of human
flesh warming my heart | Now crouching, noiseless—and now with
fangs and teeth (that is, pike and cutlass) in the yelling prey ! With
one bound to leap to rapine and revenge—to maim and rend in the
dark | My mouth waters at the thought; and here a cloud falls upon
me, for I feel, I know, that it was not to be.
“Nevertheless, it is something to dream of what success might have
compassed. Nor, because I am myself constitutionally afraid of fire,
can I suppress my admiration of those magnificent tow-balls I believe
they are not of purely English invention; nevertheless, it is something
to have introduced the exotics. I endeavour to suppress my timidity
whilst I strive to imagine their glorious effect in the midnight streets
of London. Whizz they fly in at the windows, together with the
packages of hob-nails and gunpowder How the upper rooms blaze
like a kindled cane-brake How the wretches fast asleep in their ill-
gotten feather-beds are roused to be roasted | Or if half naked, they
make for the street–pat, we have them | But alas ! this was not to be.
“Still, as I say, it is pleasant to dream of rapine and slaughter; it
somewhat delights my Tiger's spirit to find that there are men with
whom Tigers can sympathise; that there are patriots, resolved to make
the most of society, even as once upon a time my honoured father made
the most of a woman and two children.
“Nevertheless, most puissant Beauties, every Tiger, every Hyena,
every wild, flesh-eating Beast, is bound to acknowledge the excellence of
your intentions. What though you failed?—you hoped to succeed. It is
not your fault that the combustibles did not explode; it is not your
fault that houses were not turned into cinder-heaps; it is not your fault
that your pikes and cutlasses did not do gallant work. I will not stay
to describe it. No, brave Beauties; you meant well. But it was ever
thus ! That prying, eaves-dropping police will turn heroes into felons.
It was a noble cause, but—as º have said—it was not to be.
“And yet, it does soothe the spirit even to call up a vision of success.
How beautiful! Whole streets burnt down! Every man his own land-
lord, his own banker, his own monarch—that is, if he would so far
º his nature as to govern himself. Alas! Why—why was it not
e
“What have we–the ravenous Carnivora—not lost by the failure of
the plot For, carry out to the full the principles pointed and contained
in pikes and tow-balls, and every city would return to its primitive con-
dition, before flag-stones, squared by slaves, oppressed the earth, and
filthy, coal-gas tainted the air of heaven.
“This very country, this enslaved, degraded England, has been
wrested from its original possessors. There was a time when here the
Wolf and the Wild Boar held their lordly sway—before their dens and
forests were invaded by the Saxon. I have heard, too—but I will not
be too remote in my statements—that skeletons of the Elephant and
Rhinoceros have been ſound in certain caves; no doubt infamously
murdered, and secretly buried by the Whigs and Tories of a distant
day. Well, then, it is plain by the natural rights of quadrupeds, that
as we were the first possessors of the soil, so ought we to have returned
to us our original goods.
“And, my Beauties, your intentions carried out to the full, would
go far to give us back our own again. Your rº, is the policy of
Tigers; your courage the courage of the Pard. It is therefore we, the
Carnivora (always excepting the Lion), sympathise with you, even in
defeat; it is therefore that you will ever remain Beauties to your
admiring Beasts.

almost, as the old Nine Elms. The prudent traveller will take a cab.
Really the distance is quite enough to license an omnibus expressly for
the traffic. It jº be stationed at the toll-gate, and would be
an immense boon to persons distressed with corns, bundles, children, or
any other impediments against quick walking. At all events guides
should be in readiness at the foot of the Bridge, for the consternation

despair. We were told it was somewhere in that direction, but shall
not believe it till we see it with our own eyes and spectacles. We
intend to make another venture next week, and then, if it does not rain,

this “Pons. Asinorum” to the invisible station. He shall certainly
have our halfpenny when we reach the end of our journey.

relief. There’s TIM has not been able to earn anything, in, England

country in the ‘War.’ There's PAT has sunk all his capital in the

all the estate to drain. How can the country get on without a loan *
and whose duty is it, but that of Government, to come down with the
money for poor, suffering, bleeding, oppressed Ireland?... .
“Go and stay at Castle Crazy, and then say if this picture of a
country’s desolation is overcharged. As you look on the town through
the beautiful cracked French windows of the drawing-room, you will
see the Park swarming with ragged cloaks and frieze coats. You will
see three or four old crones squatted in the Hall porch, for whom the
Masther has a joke, and, very rarely now, a sixpence; as you go out
of the lodge-gate (which to be sure won't, open unless they come lift
it), more will start out to let you pass through; if you go with the
Masther to look at the mags in the stable, a score of tattered horseboys
will be there to show you the way. They will show you MASTHER
Mick's grey horse that ran for the Curragh Cup, or MASTHER JAck's
bee meer that ran second in the hurdle race, and Miss BIDDY's chestnut
filly, &c, &c.; but all the people you see, from the Masther down to
poor half-witted JoE in the chimney-corner, with his feet in the turf, are
in want of money, and look to you quite naturally to sº it. Don't
talk about refusal...Are not the English gorged with Irish beef and
corn? Who provides your pork, who wins your victories, but the
Irish P. lf it is their right, they take it and thank you for nothing; if
you refuse, you are tyrants and oppressors. Those are to be the terms
of the bargain; at least if words go for anything; if Old Ireland and
Young Ireland are to be believed, and if O'Connell and MITCHEL
represent any opinions at all.
“And while you are arranging your plans for the relief of this fine
peasantry, which is now º quiet, being about to ask you for money,
you will remember that their beautiful pikes, scythes, and dainty rifles,
(delicate instruments, with which they proposed to reap the present
harvest) are all comfortably hidden away within call. I say it behoves
an English statesman to remember that PADDY has a weapon somewhere
at hand, with which he proposes to “rise in the might of his freedom”
Some day, or in other words, to cut your throat. Where are all the
lopped forests of ash-poles which the patriots cut down before harvest,
and the bushels and cartloads of pikes which the blacksmiths flung off

vigilance, have not pounced on twenty pounds worth of old iron, the
people laugh in their ragged sleeves as they give them up old muskets
without locks, and old rusty weapons, relics of former wars. The pikes
are only thrust away into the hedge or the bog; and so the animus to
use them is merely laid aside convanient. -
“I don't say this is particularly blameworthy on the part of our Irish
brethren. I don't say that they can do otherwise—miserable as they
are, and instructed as they have been—but that you are bound to take
account of it—and to remember that the person whom you persist in
keeping in your house has been, from some cause or other, worked up

about his person somewhere, which he will use on your's whenever he
can attack you at an advantage.
“If this is the fact; if the people hates you, and you have no means
to pacify it, why should not the Irish gentlemen try their hand to settle
their own affairs in their own city of Dublin? How would their palavers
hurt us? or how would our strength be injured by leaving them to
arrange their own difficulties, and provide for their own poor?
“And what if the orderly and sensible portion of the Irish are at this
minute actually prevented by you from keeping order in their country?
—if the house is on fire and we keep the keys of the engine?
“Why, Sir, I say, are we to turn out and work the pump for the Irish
conflagration, and not allow them to put out their own flames with their
own buckets? Why shouldn't the #i have a Council House or an
Administrative Assembly of their own? You never condescend to give
reasons or entertain the question. And yet there are only phrases
against it. MR. CANNING says, “Restore the Heptarchy!” MAC-
AULAY says, “Let the whole Empire go down together, rather than a
separation ensue;’ MR. CARLYLE says, “The British Lion will squelch
the Irish Rat, but separation must not be.’...I hope to see a great party
in England before long, which shall say, ‘Why not?’ At any rate, that
it shall be a question open to fair debate; and that, when our Trish
friends bawl out “Repeal,” some people will answer “With all our
hearts!” from this country too. -
“Gentlemen,' (that band of simple-minded patriots will exclaim) “we
get no good out of you. We pay you for your pigs and oats, that you
are always bragging about. As for an army, it is not for love that you
shoulder the musket, but for money; and to say that we are to keep a
nation of eight millions, in order that we may get forty or fifty thousand
men out of it, is as if you were to tell us to burn a house down in order
to roast a pig. We are tired of your brawling, your bawling, your
bullying, your bragging, your begging. You stop our kindness with
your curses, our pity with your ludicrous menacing and boasting; you
render our confidence impossible with your double dealing. We may
part, from, you, and yet survive, without a restored Heptarchy. We
won't go down, even though we have the pleasure of your § In
the ship. As for “squelching,” that is out of the question, The British
Lion has much better occupation; the business would fatigue him.
The dog Billy can do it infinitely better. We believe that we shall be
better without, you than with your company; and finally, if you want
Repeal, we will do our utmost efforts not to balk you.’
“Sentiments of this nature simply put forward, and conveyed to the
leaders ecclesiastical and occult of the Irish party, I believe would go
farther to stop the Repeal movements on the other side, than any
efforts of conciliation; and I think we should begin to show that we
are in earnest, and to prepare our Irish friends for the change they look
for, by stopping the subsidies which they have been in the habit of
drawing from this country.

Portsmouth, Sept. 6th.-A Notice was this morning received, ap-

that plebeian merit is not henceforth—as NAPIER observed—condemned
to wither in the “cold shade of aristocracy,” but is to be rated at its
own intrinsic greatness. MR JEROME will, of course, rise in the scale
of promotion as rapidly as the rules of the service will permit. The
UEEN has already sent him gold for his purse: a few years, and as
post-captain, he may wear the precious metal in epaulettes. It is by
such fostering care as this, that BRITANNIA makes herself beloved by
all her salt-water children.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WACANCY IN THE PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS.
It has long been a matter of surprise with us, that a celebrated
character has not been included amongst the illustrissimi of Baker
Street. He has for years been a public favourite—has won more battles
than the luckiest general—has corrected more abuses than the greatest
reformer—has put down more quackeries, nuisances, and delusions,
than the mighty SIR PETER—and has made more people laugh than
SIBTHORP or GRIMALDI.
We flatter ourselves we know this honourable individual—and a better
and a truer, creature never existed. Who so welcome at every one's
fireside? Who mixes more with every grade of society, from the
palace to the skittle-ground, and is more generally liked Who is
there that possesses the same chance of turning his enemies—if in any
odd corner of the globe there now lurks one—into bosom friends? He
is the Poor Man's Friend, and the Rich Man's Best Companion. We
say all this confidently; for we know this honest fellow almost as well
as we know ourselves; and can say from our hearts, that the more we
know him, the better we love him. It is, therefore, with this profound
conviction of his merits, that we are astonished he has not yet been
allowed the very foremost rank at MADAME TUssaud's popular
Walhalla of waxen heroes... We hope this accidental omission, however,
will soon be repaired, and that we shall shortly read on the placards of
the Metropolis, the following announcement, now long due:-
“Just ADDED, MR. PUNCH.”
Not a “Common" Compliment.
THE Committee of the Underwriters' Rooms of Liverpool have, in
grateful acknowledgment, granted the freedom of their establishment
to ADMIRAL GRENFELL, to Thomas LITTLEDALE, Esq., and to CAPTAIN
LISBOA, in consequence of “their meritorious exertions” at the burning
wreck of the Ocean Monarch. The reporter adds, this compliment “is
no common one.” This is evident; otherwise it would have been
awarded to the heroic FREDERIck JEROME, a “common” sailor.
WHAT IS ONE MAN'S MEAT IS ANOTHER MAN's POISON.
TREVELY AN, fee’d, and K.C.B.'d,
No maudlin feeling shamming;
Whilst Paddies droop, and beg for soup,
He thrives upon a famine!
The People's “Sweeps.”
THE Attorney-General has given timely warning to newspaper pro-
prietors that, if they continue to advertise public-house “Sweeps” he
will proceed against the offenders for penalties. LoRD GeoRGE BEN-
TINck boldly stood up for the “Sweeps” of the masses. Why, he
inquired, should gambling be allowed at the Clubs, and not at the
Bag-o’-Nails and Goat-in-Boots? Wery proper; it is too bad that the
little “Sweeps”...should be persecuted in public-houses, whilst big
“Black-legs” still swagger on the turf.
AN AUDACIOUS BOY.
ROM the public papers we learn that a shameless
varlet, aged 14, was a few days since brought before
MR. ComBE (Clerkenwell), charged with an unblush;
5 ing attempt to sell vegetables from a stall he had
boldly erected in Leather Lane, Holborn. He and
his vegetables had been taken into custody by a
policeman, on the complaint of a most punctilious
and particularly respectable tradesman.
“The shopkeeper said that he was constantly annoyed by
the prisoner and other venders of fruit and vegetables standing
before his door selling their goods, and he called upon the
bench to punish the prisoner.—MR. Coºrer: Pray what for 4–
Shopkeeper: For causing an annoyance by standing with his
articles opposite my door.—MR. Conse: Nonsense; poor per-
sons like this boy must get a living by some means or other.
Was he standing on the footway with his property 3 - Constable: No.; on the
carriage-way, your Worship.”
The end of this was—MR. CoMBE discharged the boy, thus—there
can be no doubt of it—giving an encouragement to all boys desirous of
obtaining their livelihood by selling goods from stalls, when not rich
enough to take shops.
We can feel for the complaining shopkeeper...There was great au-
dacity in the boy attempting to set up for himself upon the naked flags,
and under nothing more respectable than the roof of the *: And
this, too, when there was another obvious course open to the little
trader. For instance, at the very time he was selling his penn'orths of
onions and lettuces, and thereby annoying a worthy, shopkeeper, at
the very time, how many individuals were perambulating the streets of
London, with pocket-handkerchiefs about them that—carefully ab-
stracted—would, any two or three of them, return more to the boy than
the wretched profits of a day’s dealing in beans and cabbages! To be
sure, the boy would have to run the risk of Newgate; but what of
that? Better dare the hulks than by “standing with articles” opposite
his door, excite the ire of a respectable shopkeeper. Is there to be no
respect to the dignity of—rent and taxes?
THE CHEAP ARMY CLOTHIER.
AFTER dinner, at all public banquets, or most,
It is usual the “Army” to give as a toast;
And no doubt there can be that the custom is right,
To drink health to the brave for their country who fight.
Then allow me the “Army's "good health to propose;
And now, if you please, just a word on their clothes.
| All soldiers, of course, must dress matty and smart,
Or they never will conquer the feminine heart;
And a regiment should always appear on parade,
In a uniform, credit which does to the Trade.
Now cheapness with elegance must be combined,
Satisfaction to give to the national mind. -
John BULL likes HER MAJESTY's troops to look nice;
But he wishes them clothed at a moderate price.
And you’ll own, of all people the Colonel’s the man
Who would rig out his regiment as cheap as he can.
For the Colonel receives, as 'tis right you should know,
So much money to furnish his soldiers with clo’.
At the lowest of figures he does every suit,
As the difference goes into his pocket, for boot.
Then go to your Colonel, 3:#. of MARs,
Ye spirited Lancers, and dashing Hussars: -
Ye gallant Life-Guardsmen, and Troops of the Line,
For the cheapest of clothes—if !". 're not superfine.
To your Colonel repair, horse and foot, rank and file,
He'll equip you in most economical style; .
Each Squadron, Battalion, Detachment, Brigade,
Seek your Colonel's depôt to be cheaply array'd;
Divisions, and regiments of all sorts of hues,
Ye Lights and ye Heavies, ye Greys, Buffs and Blues,
Ye Sappers and Miners, ye tall Grenadiers,
Artillerymen, Rifles, and Scots Fusiliers,
To your Colonel apply, for by him you may count
Upon being supplied at the smallest amount;
For a profit, you see, he obtains on your dress,
So that no other tradesman can find it for less.
To your Colonel's Emporium you therefore should rum,
E’en more cheap than the Mart of LONGNoSES AND SON.
A GREAT SIMILARITY.
O whatever the Irish rebel leaders may be accused, they certainly
manifest great consistency, for there is as much difficulty in the appre-
hension of their speeches as of their persons.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 109
OUR RAILWAYS AND OUR RESPECTABILITY.
THE cloven foot, or rather, the claw, is beginning to peep out among
the Railway Directors, who, having secured a monopoly, and beaten off
competition, by that convenient bugbear, “the badness of the times,”
are beginning to raise the fares, and to reduce the amount of third-class
accommodation as much as possible. They have made the discovery
that people are riding by the third-class, who, from their position in life,
ought to take a better position in the train; and, to guard against this
tendency to self-abasement, the public will in future be deprived of the
power of riding by third-class trains more than once in the day, which
the Act of Parliament expressly requires. It is delightful to see the
Railway Directors evincing this anxiety to uphold the respectability of
their fellow men, by preventing them from having the opportunity of
lowering themselves, and by affording them ample means of keeping up
and *: for their dignity. In THURTELL's days respectability con-
in keeping a gig, but in our own times it is in riding by a first-
class carriage that true respectability is to be accomplished.
We do not exactly know how the means and position in life of
travellers by Railway can be, or have been, ascertained; but perhaps the
Directors intend to insist upon every passenger making a return of his
income before he can be permitted to take a ticket as a third or even a
second-class passenger. We think some of the machinery employed in
ascertaining the amount of Income Tax could be introduced beneficially
at every station, and exemptions from the necessity of paying first or
second class should be distributed to all who could show themselves not
possessed of at least two or three hundred pounds per annum.
A Polite Speaker for Parliament.
THE Times correspondent at Cheltenham gives the following specimen
of invective as an extract from a speech
by the Honour ABLE CRAVEN BERKELEY:—
“Sra WILLIAM Clay, the Member for the Tower Hamlets, was an empty-headed
fop, possessing the very best opinion of himself; or, to use a common-place expres-
sion, any one who would purchase him at his own valuation of himself, and then
sell him at his own intrinsic worth, would be very much the loser. The next
Member, MR. Roundell PALMER, the Member for Plymouth, is a Puseyite lawyer of
questionable reputation, who has bolstered up that reputation by some luck in one
or two suits in the Court of Chancery, but who is perfectly ignorant in the Law of
Evidence, and of the Common Law of the land.”
The honourable orator is at present without a seat in Parliament.
We propose that a new metropolitan borough should be created
expressly for him. If a constituency ought to be heard through its
representative, he would be just the very Member for Billingsgate.

THE STATE OF FRANCE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
OUR French express brings us nothing at present from a spot more
remote than Boulogne, as “our own Correspondent’” had not yet
ventured beyond that point at the date of our last advice, and our last
advice to him was to make the best of his way home again. Boulogne
remains perfectly tranquil, nothing having been knocked down but the
price of apartments, and there having been no rising, except in the
fruit, which is somewhat higher than it used to be. The old blind
organ player on the pier has had 0 Richard, 0 mon Roi! taken off
his instrument, and Mourir pour la patrie put in its place; but this
tºº. seems to excite little sympathy, or rather, it is responded
to by a general tergiversation on the part of his hearers, who usually
turn their backs upon him. ... He has simply converted his organ into an
organ of republicanism; but it is to be observed that he suspends his desire
to Mourir pour la patrie until he hears a footstep approaching, when he
“turns, and turns, and turns again, and still goes on ” with the sick-
ening refrain which everybody is now compelled to listen to. The
Tree of Liberty in the Tintelleries looks as if it would shortly pack up
its trunk, make its bough, and retire, though it will go without even

FLOWERs “ouT OF PLACE.”
WE take the subjoined from the Leicester Mercury.
It is a case tried at the Leicester Borough
Court, a HILDYARD, Recorder and
Judge:–
“Liggins v. J. Shaw.—Claim £1.15s., for garden crop.
Defendant said he had entered into plaintiff's service,
and in addition to his wages was to have the use of a
piece of garden ground. In June last, when he had
ot the ground into good order, and had well stocked
t with vegetables, he was suddenly dismissed—de-
fendant telling him to get the garden-stuff valued,
* and he would pay for it. This was accordingly done,
and the value put on was the amount sued for, which
defendant refused to pay. Defendant now said plain-
tiff might have the vegetables; but it appearing he
had formerly refused this proposition, the Court made
an order for £1 13s., deducting 2s. for flowers, which
it considered out of place in a cottager's garden.”

with roses? For this sole reason, MR. HILDYARD; that, in length
of days, they might be made to give up their essence, distilled, for
people who could afford to buy rose-water. Why should Lavender
cumber the earth, if not to scent “fine linen?” It was never made
for a mere cottager's garden, thence, perhaps, to be gathered and
consigned to old worm-eaten walnut-tree drawers, to give an odour
to the holiday neckerchief or the Sunday shirt. We should as soon
allow pearls to the cottager's wife, as Snowdrops to the cottager's
border. How can a mere rustic for a moment dare to think of Heart's-
ease? What has he to do with Stocks, unless to sit in them? For the
cottager, Balm of Gilead is surely “out of place;” and, we ask it, was

Again, there may be democratic thoughts wafted even to the dull

we might reasonably expect him to bring in a “Bill for the Repeal of

cottagers, such flowers must surely be alarmingly “out of place.”
HONOUR TO JOIN WILLE |
You’RE a noble fellow, JoſNVILLE, you’re a seaman true and brave
As ever bearded Davy Jones upon the stormy wave;
Never hero did more gallantly the work of bloody strife,
Than you have done humanity's in boldly saving life.
There are chiefs at Glory's summons who all dangers can defy,
And risk their precious carcases, prepared to do or die,
Who have gone through fire and water at the trumpet-call of Fame;
You, at the signal of distress, have braved the flood and flame.
As a fire-eater I’ve laughed at you—prophetic was the joke
It only shows how true a word in jest is often spoke; -
Had you burnt the British Navy, your renown could not be higher
Than what you’ve gained already by your conduct under fire.
Your deportment in an action I have oft desired to see;
I’ve had my wish, and own that better bearing could not be.
With the Ocean Monarch, Joinville, to your chivalrous affair
There is not a naval action that I know of, to compare.
You have had a golden medal for the deed that you have done,
Just to match with the opinions that your º has won;
But no kind of testimonial we could possibly invent,
Though as big as a dessert plate, your desert would represent.
You have earn’d a name of honour—for to all the fact is known,
That he who saves his fellows' lives at hazard of his own,
With our native sons of NEPTUNE is establish'd on a par,
And decidedly entitled to be call'd a British Tar.
May your timbers ne'er be shiver'd, then; your braces ever taut,
Your topsail, gallant, royal, exactly what they ought.
So we hail you, Joinville, heartily. . Yoho, there! JACK, ahoy!
Three cheers for you, my heart of oak-good luck to you, my boy!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SKETCHES
IN SALT AND FRESH WATER.
BY THE BUOY AT THE Norte.
If watering-places were ar"
ranged like the divisions of
a theatre, Margate would be
the pit, and Ramsgate the
dress circle. The two places
of amusement almost touch
one another, and yet how
wide apart are the people
who frequent them in their
manners, appearance, and
notions of enjoyment . A
erson in the pit—I mean
argate-laughs outright,
and is quite indifferent about
his dress. In fact he would
as soon takeoff his coat, and
sit in his shirt sleeves, as
look at you. He generally
takes his provisions with him
too; and, whenheisthirsty
pulls out a stone jug, an
applies it to his lips in the
faces of all the company.
Far from being abashed, he
passes it to his wife, and
holds the cork, turning away his head, whilst his good lady drinks. He
does not mind what people, say. He has come out to enjoy himself,
and he is determined to #. it. -
How different is the company in the dress circle! I am speaking
now of Ramsgate. The ladies are dressed very prettily; the gentlemen
have most superior gloves; and altogether the coats, gowns, opera and
eye-glasses, and jewellery are selected with the most fastidious taste.
It is impossible for people to be more genteel; but gentility, I am
afraid, must be dull work. They all seem afraid to enjoy themselves.
They smile occasionally, and simper with the best grace, but appear
about as lively as if they were sitting for their portraits. They never
º: least heartily. When a good roar wakes them up, they
look down with supreme contempt upon the pit below, and wonder how
people can be so vulgar? -
I have now mixed in both circles, and have arrived at
the º: conclusions:-
1st, That Ramsgate is very genteel;
2nd, That Margate is very vulgar.
This means that the latter enjoys itself unreservedly,
not caring twopence (which is the amount at which
Fº it seems, estimate the world's opinion)
or what people think; and that the former is
afraid to appear in public and follow its
impulses, for fear of being considered vulgar.
If the two towns could be made to amalga-
mate, the junction would probably be one of
the pleasantest watering-places in England.
The starchness of the one would soon be
taken out of it by the freedom of the other.
As for myself, I would sooner live in Mar-
gate than Ramsgate—and for this reason,
that I would sooner walk in pattens than
strut about on stilts any day; but, mind you,
º, I am not fond of either.
It is a curious fact that no lady is com-
plete at a watering-place without a watch.
At Margate the watches grow to a very large *.*.*.*.
size. At Ramsgate, however, the gentility is º.
apparent again on the face of them. They are
rarely bigger than ſourpenny pieces. They are so small that you imagine
they must be sold, like shrimps, by the pint. I should say, thirty
Ramsgate watches make one Margate ditto.
Margate is populated with Bazaars. They drive a rattling trade, if
I may judge from the dice-boxes. I was passing by one, when a gentle-
man rushed out and exclaimed up and down the street, “Only one
wanted for sixpence.”
This was at noon... As I passed the same Bazaar at ten o'clock at
night, the same individual was at the door, bawling out the same
demand for the same amount of money. Good gracious! Could he
have been wanting one for ten long hours, and that one had not re-
lieved his want yet?. One felt ashamed of oneself! I gave him the
sixpence, and slept that might the sleep of the blessed!
Margate, I am afraid, is a very dissipated place, since the raffling
begins at twelve o’clock in the day; though the smallness of the stakes

improvement, however, has been introduced into that exciting

ame. Ladies' dresses are now put up as some of the prizes. This is
tter than the old match-cases and card-holders; though, if I had won
a bombasine, or a visite, I confess I should have been puzzled rather
what to do with it. Gentlemen's clothing should also be admitted into
the raffling, or at all events legs of mutton with trimmings, or a barrel
of oysters, or a cod’s head and shoulders, should occasionally be thrown
into the stakes, and then there would be something to please all tastes.
One of the amusements at Margate is º: the telescope.
The ships in the Downs, far from moving on, like many people, if you
stare at them, will stand perfectly still for days; or, if you have another
hankering after the beautiful, you may amuse yourself by admiring

BEAUTIES AND BEASTS.
From the Beaver of the Surrey Zoological Gardens, to Louis-BLANC, late
of Paris.
ND so, CITIZEN BLANC, you have discovered that men
are neither bees nor beavers. You have failed to
turn France into a hive or a beaver-house. The
Organisation of Labour is yet to be carried out
among the human species. Among men there will
still be task-masters and idlers. As yet, they will
not be instructed. Beavers are at least for awhile
to remain superior to bipeds. Nevertheless, Citizen,
you meant well. Ifeel assured that it was the honesty
of your heart to elevate the condition of Man to that of the family of
the Castor: your fault has been the fault of too sanguine hope, and not the
wickedness of a debauched egotism. And therefore, CITIZEN BLANC,
you are welcome to England; though you have described it as the
rison-house of the world, you are nevertheless welcome to a corner in
it; though you have Fº Englishmen as soulless slaves to a money-
box; as forcats proud of their gold and silver chains, and exulting in
the Mint-mark that brands them—nevertheless, they will forget and
forgive all such misused ink, and give you cordial greeting. And for
this reason, CITIZEN BLANC–you meant well. Whereupon, in your
exile, let your dwelling-place (whether a whole suite of rooms, or a
modest two-pair back)—let your dwelling-place be honoured far above
the palace of Claremont.
“The human family—especially that portion of the family dwelling in
France—is at present too ignorant to be taught your elevating lessons.
Frenchmen will consume, from time to time—as the gift is vouchsafed
and wasted upon them—half-a-dozen BLANcs, ere Labour will be
Organised as it is with us, the superior Beavers. But what makes our
superiority to Man? Why, our equality among ourselves. Form all
men equal, and you elevate them to Beavers. Were we, of the streams,
and lakes, and rivers, made with different powers, I fear that our
Organisation of Labour—an Organisation perfected on the banks of the
rivers º: girdled Paradise—would full soon lapse into confusion. For
example :-
“Here is a Beaver who, by the adroit use of his teeth, can cut
through a whole tree while another Beaver is nibbling, off a branch.
Well, the better Beaver will build the better house; and, having, built
it, will prefer that his own Mrs. Beaver and the little Beavers shall have
the said house; he will not consent to make it part of a common
barrack for the whole family of Castors, many of whom are too lazy or
too ignorant to make the best use of their incisors.
“Another Beaver has a better eye, a better brain for building. . He
is the happier judge of the exact place to be chiselled in the trunk of
the tree to be flung down. The architect Beaver hereupon makes his
i. * cut, in the bark of the tree; and labourer Beavers bite it
through.
“Another Beaver is a superior engineer. At a glance he can tell
where the river-dam is to be built, and at what exact curve best to
oppose the stream. He defines, the curve by swimming it; and the
dam is built by a crowd of mud-layers. Now, Louis, it is not to be
expected that, Engineer Beaver—the wiser Castor—will take up the
mud and rubbish in his fore-paws, working with the crowd of mud-
layers. ... Certainly not. When SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN designed
St. Paul's Cathedral, it was no business, no duty of his, to carry a hod
of mortar.
“Now, Louis-BLANC, I take, it that social equality can only result
from equality of mind and bodily powers. One Beaver is as good as
another, only because they are both equal. Every Beaver brings into
the world the same incisors, the same eye for the tree to be levelled,
the same judgment to form a river-dam. The family of Castor can live
upon the happiest equality, for they have equal abilities. But, depend
upon it, Louis-BLANc—if one Beaver excelled in chiselling, another in
levelling trees, another in building dams, and so forth, throughout the
whole social polity of Beaver life-depend upon it then there would be
a very different Qrganisation of Labour to that prevailing on the banks
of the Qhio and Mississippi.
“When every man is in himself a SHAksPEARE, a Newton, a
MICHAEL ANGELo, a WREN, a WATT, and so forth-each man con-
taining in his common self all the genius and all the wisdom now vouch-
safed to units out of millions—why, then, there will be less than ever a
need of an Organisation of Labour, for the duties of existence will then
be made as the motions of angels.
“Mind—I do not say because all men, even the poorest and weakest,
are not Beavers, that they are not to have full bellies and warm houses:
all I say is, the belies can't be filled with the same sort of food, and
the houses built of the same sort of materials. You think it should be
otherwise; and there, Louis, your mistake; and there the mischief
you have done. Nevertheless, again I say, you meant well; so well,
that—both of you exiles, one in a palace and one, it may be, in a garret
—who would rather be Louis-PHILIPPE than Louis-BIANC:
“Your's respectfully, (but not fraternally), THE BEAVER.”
CONSCIENCE-MONEY FROM GOVERNMENT.
THERE are certain gentlemen, remarkable for tender conscience, if
not for a more general softness of character, whose remittances to the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER “on account of Income-Tax,” ſur-
mish at least one daily paragraph for the Times. It is to be wished that
SIR CHARLEs Wood º: open his mind to the advantages of the
reciprocity system, and be guided by that truly sound maxim, that one
. turn deserves another. At present it º: that conscience is
all on the side of the tax-payers. We should be glad to see, the
Government making restitution occasionally, as well as the defaulters.
It would gratify us to find it announced in the newspapers, that, the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExcBEQUER, in consequence of A.B.'s calamitous
fire, or D. E. F.'s bankruptcy, had begged to return him the amount of
his Income-Tax. But the Government, we suppose, like DR. PALEY,
cannot afford to keep a conscience. On the contrary, they seem to act
on the principle expressed at the foot of the play-bills, of “No Money

PU N C H > S P R I Z E S FOR T H E S E S S I O N.
MR. PUNCH's Sessional Examination of his young and old friends of
the St. Stephen's School, Westminster, which is breaking up for the
holidays, took place this week, in the presence of a numerous and dis-
ſinguished audience of the Nobility Gentry, and Public in general. .
Mr. Punch has much pleasure in furnishing the following list of prizes
bestowed on the occasion:-
To MASTER JOHN Russell, the head boy of the establishment, the
first Prize, for General Inefficiency; and an extra Prize (a medal, with
the motto, “Woret praeterea nihil”) for an Essay, illustrated with prac-
tical examples, “On the Art of doing the Least Possible Work in the
Greatest Possible Time.” For this last prize there were a great many
competitors, but MASTER RUSSELL’s Essay was by much the most
successful.
To MASTER GEORGE BENTINck, the first prize for Arithmetic and
Artificial. Memory. This young gentleman exhibited the most extra-
ordinary feats in Mnemonics, committing to memory, within an incredibly
short time, long tables of figures and statistical returns upon every
subject, and repeating them without any regard to order or natural
arrangement. In order fully to test his powers, subjects were purposely
chosen on which he possessed no previous knowledge whatever.
To MASTER BENAMIN, DISRAELI, the first prize for Elocution, with
extra prizes for an Essay “Qn the Use and Abuse of Words,” and a
disquisition “On the Caucasian Theory of Civilization,” which showed
much ingenuity in contradicting all the theories of Ethnographers on
European languages and races. -
To MASTER CHISHOLM ANSTEY, Prizes for some remarkable pieces of
A MA P

ing Popular Assemblages.”
To MASTER URQUHART, a Certificate of Honour, for a Fired Idea,
manufactured entirely by himself in his leisure hours, and an amusing
comic recitation with MASTER ANSTEY, called “The Impeachment.”
To MASTER BROTHERTON, a Prize for an Essay “On the Advantage
of Early Hours,” and general r sº
To MASTER BowFING, a Certificate for procuring the greatest number
of useless returns. - -
To MASTER MoRPETH, a Prize for Good Temper, and obliging, readi-
ness to give way to everybody in everything, with marks for his diligence
in undoing his own º - • *
Prizes were also awarded to MASTER WILSON, for unremitting atten-
tion in the discharge of his duties to himself.
To MASTERs SIBTHoRP and TYRRELL, for grinning through horse-
collars, and generally promoting the amusements of the young gentlemen.
To MASTER HUME, for Essays “On Economy in the use of Pocket-
money,” and “A Cheap Method of Writing, by which crosses on t's
and dots overi's are entirely got rid of.” - - -
To MASTER PALMERSTON, for his intrepidity in jumping into hot
water on all occasions.
To MASTER CHARLEs WooD, for his pursuit of financial knowledge
under difficulties. -
And to the Irish Class, in a body, for their ingenious definitions of
the following words—“Treason,”“Saxon Oppression,” “Job,” “Duties
of Property,” and “Justice to Ireland.” -
WANTED, A JUDGE.
We have read in the papers the particulars of a very odd freak,
attributed to CHIEF Justice WILDE, wh9, it is declared, refuses most
positively to sit at Chambers... We know from experience that “sitting
at Chambers” is rather a dull sort of occupation; but Pºi SOme-
thing may be done to enliven the matter, for the sake of SIR THOMAs
WILDE, whose spirits we presume would sink under the horror of being
boxed up in Sergeant's Inn, after having been accustomed to the greater
variety and freedom of a Judge's life in London and the Provinces... If
we may be allowed to interfere as amicus curiae, we should propose that
the court in which the Judge's Chambers are situated should have a
carriage-way made through it, and that an omnibus should be engaged
to gallop round and round, for the purpose of enlivening the scene, and
enabling SIR. THOMAs Wrips to the confinement of sitting at
Chambers, which the dulness of the spot has evidently rendered un-
endurable. .. -
Possibly a limited number of organ-boys might be permitted to play
beneath the windows of the learned Judge; or, we shall be happy to
allow a company of our own itinerant puppets to go through a per-
formance once a day before SIR THOMAS WILDE, if it will have the
č.: inducing him to withdraw his threat that he will not sit at
ers.
The Nice Young Man for a Small Party.
MR. DISRAELI held a brief against the Government, which he pleaded
upon last week. This brief, like most documents of the same interesting
nature, was of a most tremendous length. After all, it might have been
rolled into one line, for it was proved at the end that the brief was
nothing more than a common motion of course, “Ex-PARTY MR. BEN-
JAMIN DISRAELI.”

THE HAUNTED PILLOW OF PARLIAMENT.
gº - (To Mr. Punch.)
“Now that the horrid Parliament—thank goodness!—is over,
do pray, Mr. Punch, endeavour, during the vacatiºn, to persuade those
Ministers to manage better for the future; so that the next Session
shall not be so dreadfully long as this has been. Such another will be
the death of MR. BURGEss, and if there is any fear of it, I shall insist l
on his resigning Mudborough, accepting what he calls the Chiltern
Hundreds, and retiring into the bosom of his family.
“Here, ever since November last, he has been out nearly every day,
attending those plaguy Committees by day, and those tiresome debates
at night; and has scarcely ever come home till two or three in the
*: This is enough to ruin the constitution of any gentleman,
and to destroy the domestic happiness of any lady whose husband goes
on in that manner.
“When he had got away from that odious House, and all those
eternal stupid discussions, and we were settled in our quiet country
seat, I was in hopes that change of air, relaxation, and his gun and dogs,
and other amusements, j have recruited his shattered nerves, and
made him himself again. But no; his mind has become seriously
affected, and is in a state which it will take him a long time to recover
from. He is absent all day whenever he is spoken to, and he passes
such frightful nights that I can get no rest for him.
“No sooner has he fallen asleep than I hear him groaning and
crying ‘Oh, oh!” When I shake him, he calls out ‘Order!” Some-
times, he shouts, Hear, hear!” at , others, “Question.'” and occa-
sionally mutters ‘I move that this House do now adjourn.” Very
often he starts up and utters a cheer, and more than once I have heard
him hoot like an owl, and crow like a barn-door fowl; nay, I have even
known him positively to bray, and it has surprised me to think that he
could be such a donkey.
“Now and then, whilst he is rambling in his sleep, he declares that
he is upon his legs, although of course he is really on his back, or side.
He keeps running on all manner of nonsense about miscellaneous
estimates, notices of motion, orders of the day, and committees. At
times he counts one, two, three, and so on; but never gets farther than
forty. In the meanwhile he frequently bursts out laughing; and on
awakening tells me that he has dreamt that he was listening to Colonel
SIBThoRP. He is also apt to be seized with fits of moaning and gasping
for breath, which frighten me extremely; and then it turns out that
he has had the night-mare, and has imagined himself to have been
hearing MR, ANstey.
“Now, Mr. Punch, as you are the advocate of early closing for the
advantage of shopmen and people of that sort, I do hope that you will
be as considerate towards Members of Parliament, and get the Govern-
ment, if you can, to close the next Session earlier. If one's husband is
to be worked and worried out of his mind, and his pillow to be haunted
in this way, a lady might as well be married to a night patrol or a poor-

THE SMITHFIELD NUISANCE “ENLARGED.”
WE have great pleasure—on the faith of the public papers—to record
a new triumph of the bestial spirit that presides over the destinies of
Smithfield. “This market,” say the journals, “is about to be enlarged
by the removal of the entire clump of buildings,” &c. Is this the first
result of the no Sanitary Bill for the City ? Is this the first fling at
LoRD MoRPETH for his doings in other parts of the metropolis P. His
Lordship may invade the cesspools of Westminster, and thrust his
meddling fingers in the dunghills of Middlesex; but Smithfield is
tabooed. It is written up, “No Health admitted here.” We under-
stand that the Lord MAyor and Corporation intend to honour the
opening of the “new space,” by partaking of a banquet of beef-steaks
from oxen solemnly slaughtered on the spot; the steaks to be cooked
—for the better conservative gusto—on the legendary gridirons of the
place. It has been said of an Act of Parliament, that a coach-and-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

BALMORAL GAZETTE.
E are very glad to see that
a Highland Littérateur of
celebrity is going to set up
the Balmoral Gazette, for
the purpose of chronicling
the actions of HER MAJESTY
and her Royal Consort and
Court while enjoying retire-
ment after the Session. If
the Highland Littérateur will
swap his paper against Mr.
Punch's, Mr. Punch will be
happy to enter into an ar-
rangement for exchange.
In fact, we have been for
all our lives so accustomed to
read a Court Circular every
morning for breakfast, that
we can’t do without it now: and it is absolutely as necessary to us to
know what PRINCE ALFRED did yesterday, and whether the PRINCEss
Alice rode out in a pony, chaise, as it is to know the price of the
Funds, or who spoke in Parliament, and what was the division.
Nobody has a right to take away all our sources of pleasurable excite-
ment at once. Here is Parliament over—but the Court is still the
Court. Where the Sovereign is, at Windsor Castle, at Pimlico, at the
Isle of Wight, on a Scotch mountain, or where you will—loyal subjects
rally in spirit.
everybody would like to be informed of its sylvan retreat, and a Court
Newsman should be perched on a bough somewhere, to scribble down
the *ion of the Sovereign and the other branches of the Royal
amily.
Now the Globe newspaper is an excellent print, and always remark-
able for its loyalty: whereas a very contrary charge has been whispered
(by calumniators) against this present journal, which they have accused
of turning august things into ridicule, and speaking disrespectſully of
regal institutions, beef-eaters, gold-sticks, and what not: and yet it
pains us to see a venerable contemporary speaking in what we must call
a ſlippant vulgarity of tone, which is highly reprehensible, of the above-
named loyal Highland Newspaper.
“We really had imagined,” says the Globe, “that nothing remained
to be adventured in penny-a-lining; that the capacities of outrage on
illustrious privacy º been already strained to the utmost; that immo-
rality or Balmorality (mark the wag's wicked play upon the words) had
been carried to the utmost. But we were mistaken.” Yes: for once the
Globe was mistaken; and it owns to the anpearance of an advertisement
which states that, “In order to afford DAILY details to the public
of HER MAJESTY's movements and the festivities at Balmoral, it is
intended to publish a DIURNAL print, entirely devoted to those subjects.
The Balmoral Gazette will be edited by a distinguished Highland LIT-
TÉRATEUR, conversant with the country, and all that renders it so
attractive to the tourist; and, besides containing unusually copious
details of what news respecting the Royal movements can interest the
loyal public, , it will contain accounts, historical, descriptive, topo.
graphical, and antiquarian, of HER MAJESTY's High LAND House, and
of the wild, romantic, and magnificent scenery with which it is every-
where enlivened.”
. For this announcement—which is a perfectly loyal, honest, decent,
intelligible placard—what does the Globe propose for to go for to do?
Why, to TAR AND FEATHER the poor £ºl. the worthy,
ood-natured Highland Littérateur against whom our Cockney brother
as some prejudice, and utters some dark hints, because our Celtic
contemporary wears no breeches. But, in the name of common decency
and brotherhood, why this pother? It is not the custom to wear that
portion of dress in the Highlands. When his late Majesty GeoRGE IV.
went to Scotland—even to Edinburgh—he royally came forth without
the garments in question. SIR WILLIAM, CURTIs wore no breeches on
some occasions in Scotland—we have his late R. H. the DUKE, or
Sussex painted in a philibeg, kilt, and snuff-mull, with nothing on but
the ordinary costume of the Scottish Highlanders. If Princes and
Aldermen turned out in kilts, who the deuce is to quarrel with a High-
land Littérateur for wearing his national raiment” We say no to the
Tar-brush. The Littérateur has no right to be tarred and decorated
with non usitatis pennis, any more than any other inhabitant of his
mountainous district.
Again, to hold him up to ridicule because he intrudes upon “illus-
trious privacy” at Balmoral is a monstrous instance of envious perse-
cution. Why are we not to know what HER MAJEsty and PRINCE
ALBERT do at Balmoral as well as at Windsor? We are told by the
Court, eaves-dropper how his Royal Highness wore a blue frock-coat
and white hat, and looked remarkably well as he crossed from Ryde to
Portsmouth: why are we to be prevented from knowing that the Prince
took an airing in a philibeg at Balmoral, and looked remarkably well
If the Court were up a tree, as in CHARLEs II’s time, S
too? This is all nonsense, persecution, and stupid jealousy—the Litté.
rateur has as good a right to his Gazette as the Globe to his own. -
We want to know, for our parts, what our Princes and our Sovereigns
do. We are not like other people in Europe (who, very likely from
having no Court Circular, have been taking sad liberties with their
monarchs); we are accustomed to know the Royal where and what-
abouts. Why, we spend eighteen thousand a-year in mere salutes and
gunpowder for the Rºyal Family; and what is a salvo of twenty-one
guns from all round a fleet, but an immense roaring Court Circular? We
read all HER MAJESTY does; all the PRINCE does; when His Royal
Highness rides, who rides with him, and when he comes hack to
luncheon; who takes out the children on the ponies; who “attends”
and who “accompanies”, them, &c. We get these news from HER
MAJESTY's own people, chamberlains, pink-slicks in waiting, or other
flunkeys. If it was not good for us, it would not be told to us. If the
Sovereign did not think fit to graciously authorise the publication of the
account of the royal venerated movements, we should never know them
at all. Jones has lived next to us for twenty years, for instance, and
we have not the slightest motion when he goes out or comes in; what
he has for dinner; who dines with him; whether he has children or no,
and so forth. But about Royalty it is different. It is beneficial for us
to know, therefore we know ; and hence it is clear that Scotland or
Pimlico both equally administer to our benefit, and increase our store
of knowledge.
We say to the Highland Littérateur, “Go on and prosper, my boy.
Never mind the Globe jeering at you because you have no breeches; or
threatening you with a tarring and feathering. You are doing your
duty to us and the Sovereign, and a little abuse need not deter you.”
What? Squeamish about disturbing illustrious privacy at Balmoral?
Highty-tighty! Mr. Globe—are you to have it all your own way in the
ºrand P. You take your fill of it. , You are loyal enough. . So are we
all—all loyal hearts—gallant, freeborn souls: we like to read of
christening of intants; the progress of babies in donkey-carts; the
movements of Princes. When we read about them, our hearts boom
out a salute, as it were, and man yards as they do at Spithead; and, W
while we have a Court Circular, shall our partially-clothed friend, the
Highland Littérateur, be denied one? For shame, Globy! for shame!
OBITUARY.
DIED last week, the Atmospheric Railway... Its death is supposed to :
have been hastened by the want of breath. When the tube was opened,
it was found quite gone. Its loss is deeply regretted by a large circle
of India-rubber buffers. A stone will be erected to mark the melancholy
fact, with the following epitaph:-"The earth hath bubbles, and this
is one of them.”
Died this week, the Wood Pavement in Oxford Street. Its remains
have been looked after by the Illustrated News, whose quick expression
of sympathy does the greatest honour to its head. Six engravers watch
over the surviving chips of the old blocks night and day.
Died of extreme attenuation, after lingering ten months, the Long
Session. It is not regretted by a single person. It has left behind it a
large family of little Bills, several of which are so weak, that they have
been ordered to lie upon the table. In answer to our last inquiries,
they were as bad as could be expected. MR, ANSTEY treats them as
one of his own, and talks to them for hours; but, strange to say, they
do not rally, and one or two of them have since died of lockjaw.

MERMAIDS AT PLAY ; OR, A NICE LITTLE WATER PARTY.
IRISH NEWS FOR AMERICAN READERS.
Expressly written for the “Tribune," New York Paper.
You have, ere this, expected extraordinary intelligence of the glorious
rebellion in Ireland, and I should be unworthy of the cause if I could
disappoint you! The chain cable that formed the corroding Union is
chopped in two–Ireland is a º At this moment the national
flag, a Golden Harpin a green field, waves above Dublin Castle; and
Lord CLARENDON.—in the very van that conveyed MITCHEL to his
dungeon (there’s retribution for you!)—has been rattled to the rail-
way station. He has been allowed to take with him only one carpet-
bag to England; the rest of his wardrobe being *:::::::: to the poor
of Dublin. SMITH O'BRIEN has been voted President for the term of
his natural life; with permission to name his successor.
My former letter must have informed you of the escape of the Presi-
dent from the dungeon of the Saxon. He was confined at the extreme
top of the prison, and supped every night upon bread-and-milk. There
was a mighty good reason for this. Thirty fathoms of silk cord—twisted
by the Lady Repealers of the Four-Leaved Shamrock Club—were con-
veyed to the illustrious captive in a milk-pail, concealed beneath the
lacteal fluid. At midnight, the Liberator of himself and country let
himself from the roof–"the cord gliding swiftly through his glowing
hands”—perpendicularly down, as the blessing of chance would have it,
upon the head of the sentry. The man ſell stunned to the earth; when
O'BRIEN seized the musket, and discharging it, and giving three cheers
for Repeal, was joined by some say a thousand, but it is certain not less
than fifty, patriots.
It would be tedious to detail the victories of the night, they trod so
close upon the heels of one another. I have only time to say, that
before two in the morning LoRD CLARENDoN was a prisoner—he was
taken in his bed, in his first sleep—and the Liberator and President of
Ireland had quaffed a bumper of claret, calling upon MR. MEAGHER,
(who was of course one of the party) to give them, on the festive occasion,
“Who fears to speak of '98?”
LoRD John Russell escaped somehow. There are many reports
as to the manner of his evasion. But the story most generally credited
is, that he was carried on board the packet by his faithful valet in a
fiddle case. I believe the President is, after all, not sorry for this, as
it relieves him of a difficulty.
The populace have been greatly excited by the clemency of the
President; who—in opposition to the advice of a majority of his
council—has come to terms with the English Army, permitting them
to quit, Ireland with their arms, stores, and honours of war. The
national heart has been acutely touched by the loss of so many bayonets.
I ought not to omit a circumstance that, after all, speaks very favour-
ably for the chivalrous bearing of the Saxon. . PRINCE GEORGE and
GENERAL MAGDoNALD both dined with the President, ere their depar-
ture, and in the handsomest manner drank the immortality of the
Irish Republic. -- -
In order to wipe into oblivion every obligation to the Saxon, it is the
intention of the President to send by an early post to the English
Government, an I.O.U. for the eight millions voted in the time of
famine by the British House of Commons. -
The receipt of the QUEEN or ENGLAND will—when obtained-be
worked in the flag of the Republic

SUBJECTS FOR THE EASEL.
UR artists are evidently at a loss for subjects worthy of
their paint-pots, their pencils, and their palettes, and we
therefore take pity on their poverty of idea by recommending
a few subjects to their attention. “Catch a weasel asleep”
is looked upon as a direction not to be complied with, but
to “Catch an easel asleep” would be accomplished very
easely, for nothing can be more sombre than most of the productions of
Art that are to be met with on our modern canvass. There is, perhaps,
a dearth of subjects, for history and fiction have been long ago almost
exhausted, and the supplies of fancy have been always of a rather
limited order, so that there is scarcely anything left for the painter to
fall back upon. We have, however, set our own ingenuity to work for
a new batch of subjects worthy of the artists of our native land, and we
beg to suggest the following:—
. The #. giving the Handkerchief to the Mother of Othello.
. The Husband of the Nurse of Juliet in one of his merry moods.
. The malignant Turk beating a Venetian and traducing the State.
. The Dogs barking at Richard the Third as he halted by 'em.
. The Baker baking the meats for Hamlet's Father's funeral.
i
More Arrests.
WE understand that a new writ has been issued and placed in the
hands of a well-known Sheriff's Officer whose quickness is at variance
with the slowness indicated in his name, and who has received instruc-
tions to lose no time in arresting the potato disease. Should he succeed
in arresting this enemy to the prosperity of the country, he will earn
not only the gratitude of all classes, but half-a-guinea in addition, by
way of fee, on the arrest being made.

To SPECULATORS, CAPITALISTS, PUBLIC COMPANIES, &c.
At a time when the public attention is strongly excited on the subject of Colonisa-
tion, and numerous cargoes of emigrants are daily leaving our principal ports,
ESSRS. RUSSELL, GREY, HAWES, & Co., of Downing Street, and
St. Stephen's, westminster, who are declining their Emigration and Colonial
line of business, beg to call the attention of the above to their extensive stock of
Crown Lands, unoccupied British Possessions, &c. &c., in various parts of the
world, and of the finest qualities; for the disposal of which, in consequence of the
unexampled pressure of the times and the difficulties of the firm, arising from
circumstances over which they have no control, Messrs. R., G., H. & Co. would be
happy to treat on even the most disadvantageous terms.
heir list comprises wood-lands, Mineral soils, Coast-lines with Harbours,
Alluvial Plains, and other descriptions of territory, most inviting to the Capitalist
and bestfitted for Emigrants, with many spots likely hereafter to be of great value to
the public as naval and steam-boat stations. Capitalists would find this an excellent
opportunity of acquiring immense tracts for comparatively nothing, which might
afterwards be re-sold in small lots, at high prices, to Emigrants. No questions will
be asked, and no inconvenient conditions attached to the property, which will be
disposed of without any (but the usual official) reserve. Companies formed for
hunting or fur-trading purposes will find this an opportunity never before offered
(and not likely to be offered again) of securing to their game and fur-bearing
animals uninterrupted possession of fine and fertile tracts of country. The abo-
rigines, in all cases, will be thrown in with the land, without any extra charge, and
wil become the absolute property of purchasers. Emigration Societies, by availing
themselves of the peculiar facilities which the position of Messms. R., G., H. & Co.
gives the firm, may make their own terms with Emigrants, and secure an enormous
profit, which their other numerous avocations entirely prevent Messrs. R., G., H. &
Co. from even attempting to realise.
Messas, R., G., H. & Co. are kindly permitted a reference to the Hudson's Bay
Company, who have just concluded with them a most advantageous bargain for
Vancouver's Island. Secrecy and strict honour may be relied on. No Member of
the House of Commons can be treated with, and no Irishman (without capital)
need apply.
The present time is particularly well-suited to Colonial enterprise, as the Stocks,
Plants, Machinery, &c. of West Indian, Mauritius, and other proprietors, who are
retiring from-business, owing to ruin and other causes, may be had on the most
reasonable terms.
N.B.-Great reduction to persons taking a quantity. As Messrs. R. G., H., & Co.
are anxious to get their entire stock off their hands with the least possible delay,
no offer will be rºused.
MILK-SOP. HEROES.
* THE papers inform us that the Lord Lieutenant has ordered the
State prisoners to be supplied, in addition to prison fare, with plenty of
sweet milk. Really his º: ship must be full of the very essence of
milk himself—we mean, the cream of human kindness—to treat these
rebellious innocents like so many sucking doves. His kindness will
never stop at milk. Surely he will let these gentle agitators have a
drop of rum in their milk, or at least he will order them fish, or a
few devilled bones for breakfast, and something warm for supper? He
will likewise give them due notice when he intends to give them a little
treat, by ordering the jailor to go round the cells, and write over the
mantel-pieces—“Penison to-morrow.”
We are no advocates for harshness. It only hardens criminals;
sending them away from a prison much worse than when they entered
it. Therefore, the Lord Lieutenant may be º: in just trying kind-
ness as a remedy. He may believe that the best way to cure a rebel,
is to steephim in milk. This is notabad method, certainly, of bringin
him within the pale of society, but then all prisoners should be allowe
the benefit of the same immersion; otherwise the prisoners of a lower
grade will be justified in calling out every morning and afternoon, when
the pail is being carried up to the rebels, “Milk below!”
THE ENGLISH PAINTED BY THE FRENCH.
HE Morning Chronicle—in an article which we might have
mistaken for one of our own, it was so funny and yet
so sensible-informs us of the discovery of a monster
mare's-nest which has been made at Paris by the Con-
corde newspaper. The profound knowledge which French
writers generally have of England, and everything relating to England
is ludicrous enough; but this mare's-nest goes even beyond the usual
boundary of Anglophobian absurdities. But suppose we let the corre-
spondent of the Concorde speak for himself. e quote from memory,
only regretting that we have not the identical º before us, as the
reality, in these matters, is always so much richer than the cleverest
imitation:-
To the Editor of the “Concorde.”

Republic, the awful weight should crush it at once into a premature grave. I send you facts, which I have
seen with my own eyes.
“You know, of course, that England is at present the hotbed of constitutional exiles. . This was
enough to excite my worst apprehensions, for where there are exiles, I said, plots cannot be far distant.
I heard, moreover, there was to be a Cabinet Council at Osborne
House. This was more than sufficient to convince me something was
going on. I rose very early, and got into an omnibus to reach in time
the Isle of Wight. Going through St. Giles's, which is the Faubourg
St. Germain of London, where all the Legitimists hatch their vile
| designs, I recognised at a window a well-known face that was yawning.
| I looked four times in order to be right, and the fifth time it yawned I
became confident it was MonTEMOLIN. He was not shaved. My suspi-
| cions were at once excited. He got into my omnibus. Soon after this
| we passed the Turkish Ambas-
- - sador. As he looked into our
windows, he stroked his beard.
The sign, though very hasty,
did not escape me. I got next
to the door, determined to see the end of this drama. I was
intensely excited, as you may imagine. It was not yet day-
break, but luckily, I had brought my spectacles. ... I did not lose
a single wink. MonTEMoLIN evidently did not like my starin
at kim, for he moved his place three or four times. I followe
- him each movement. He got outside—so did I. It was here
- I heard a horse in the distance. I kept both my ears open,
and, as I *..." a rider flew by us. It was but a moment—he
was mounted on a brewer's horse (the most rapid steeds in
England); but my practised eye had already detected PRINCE
Louis-NAPOLEoN... I held my breath, and looked at the Spanish
Pretender by my side. He could not meet my fº and coughed.
It was quite º: The next moment another cough was re-
turned. Could I doubt such unerring proofs I went on—but we
were drawing near the end of
our journey. Crossing Batter.
sea Fields an old man was seen
hobbling before us... There was
something about him which I
did not like. He wore a cocked
hat. He put his hand before his
face, but in vain; at one glance
I had traced through his fingers the features of who do you think?
my pen shudders as it writes the name of -METTERNICH!! Good
racious!. Here was a discovery 1. I was half afraid to persevere;
ut, braving the worst, I did. We reached Osborne House about
nine o'clock. MonTEMOLIN got down; I followed him. He evidently
did not like it—I need not tell you this did not influence me in the
least. He went into a beer-shop; mind you, it was the Crown
and Sceptre-METTERNICH soon joined him. They had “sixpenn'orth

bottom of this; but I leave it to you to find out. Louis-NApoleon and the Turkish Ambassador

for Montexol.IN in the meantime had borrowed a stick. I did not tread too closely on their
steps, for if I ventured too near, it struck me my position might involve serious consequences,
probably, plunging Europe into a war. But I kept my eyes upon them. They went into the Palace,
the Ambassador stroking his beard as before. I climbed over the wall; a shutter attracted my
notice. I peeped through a crevice. Heavens ! it was a cellar; but so dark, I could hardly see
anything; a light was brought in. It was the Turkish Ambassador; the monster, I observed, was
stroking his beard once more. There was something in the wind, for the candle that moment went out;
but METTERNIch brought in a dark lantern (it emblem of his policy), and he was succeeded by Monte.
MQLIN with his stick, and the other two. After them came Guizot and Nesselrode, the Editor of the
Times, Louis-PHILIPPE, Duchatel, the BARON NATHAN, the CoMTE DE PARIs, attended by his nurse,
and the last arrival was the QUEEN || || My eyesight here failed me. The excitement had been too
much for me; but I had seen enough to leave it beyond the shadow of a doubt that I had been led
by the most miraculous chain of accidents to be a spectator of a
CABINET COUNCIL. At OSBORNE HOUSE.
... “Keep this matter dark at present. The horrible conspiracy must soon come to light; but to reveal
it at present would only cause the head of your correspondent to be rolling the next, minute down the
yawning precipice of Holborn Hill.” We do not say that the above is literally the article in the
Concorde, but it gives the substance of
it, only not half so absurdly expressed.
Really, there should be a College at
Paris for French writers, to instruct
them upon the most common English
subjects. It might be called the
“Colli:GE DEs GoBEMOUCHES.”
T | HOW TO MAKE PARLIAMENT
PROFITABLE.
A PLAN has been hit upon in Paris
for making the sittings of the National
{{{3||Assembly a source of profit, and we
mention it in order that our own
House of Commons may take a hint for
converting such a protracted Session
as the last into a regular branch of
Revenue. The nine hundred represen-
tatives of the French people, or at
least those acting under their autho-
rity, charge sums, varying from 10 to
12 and 15 francs, for the privilege of
entrée to their unique performances.
We don’t know whe her the receipts
go towards paying the Members their
pound each per day, or whether the
sum charged for admission is a perqui-
site of the door-keepers, the ministers,
or any other portion of the great fra-
ternal family now quarrelling and
starving in France; but there is cer-
tainly a good deal of money being
* made by somehody out of the attrac-
tion which the National Assembly holds
out to foreigners and sight-seers. We
understand that for 5 francs extra,
any of the Members will attend at a
private house, and make a speech,
either legitimist or communist, at the
option of the hearer; or, if particularly
desired, a Member will bring with
him a representative whose opinions
are opposite to his own, so that a
debate, or even a personal altercation
—either with or without blows—may
be provided at an hour's notice.
It is expected that this will ulti-
mately become the most profitable
portion of the labours of the Assembly,
which has done little as yet, beyond
proposing 500 amendments to the new
Constitution, and voting itself-as
well as its salary of a pound per head
every day—en permanence.
Legislation is now almost the only
thing that pays in France; for a
Legislator may positively not only live,
which few people in the Land of
Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity can
do, but may actually save money
which nobody in the land aforesai
thinks about. Some of the Members
have been trying to push their trade
beyond its legitimate limits; and,
among others, one M. LeRoux has
been trying to get off the unsold
copies of an old pamphlet, by speaking
the whole of it as a speech, and lettin
it be known that the production .#
be had for a few sous, in the lobby.
This advertising trick was discovered
and exposed by a rival; but ingenuity
will no doubt find other modes of
turning a seat in the National Assem-
bly to pecuniary account, the only
account in which it appears to be held
by many of those who have arrived at
the dignity.

From the Zebra, Surrey Zoological Gardens, to SIR PETER LAURIE, Alderman of the
City of London.
HE, sneering paupers of this world, my dear SIR PETE
call a Zebra nothing more at the best than a Donkey in luck, a Jackass in
a fine coat. Ha, SIR PETER! How many folks there are whose brayings
would never be listened to if not uttered in the finery of office and fine
trappings! Deprive me of my skin, and what am I in any part other than
the poor Donkey-devil that drags the water-barrel ?, Take the gown from
many a man of place, and what is there that is not common between him
and the forlornest of vagrants? Hence, as Zebras are only Asses with silk

in minever gowns. In this world, outside does so much, SIR PETER. Here

“I am not aware that this reflection has anything to do with the purpose of
my letter. It, however, came into my head, whilst i was chewing my artichoke
(for they don’t give Zebras thistles here, like the asinine poor), and I thought
I might as well get clean rid of it. If, as Alderman and Middlesex magistrate,
Governor of Bedlam, and Churchwarden, it can be of any service to you, pray
make use of it.
“Bred in Africa—where I have seen something of vagabonds—I have always
been an admirer of your moral self-elevation. You look so loftily about
you, it is almost impossible for human weakness to catch your eye. You do not believe in
the possibility of a converted, thief. Before LAURIE, the fallen man can never get up again.
The sinner, once sinning, is tattooed with crime; no penitentiary soap, with parson
superintending the ablution, can wash him clean again. The wretch is branded for his
first offence, He has picked a pocket; and his fingers are feloniously crooked by Fate for
the rest of his days. Repentance is a fine word in three syllables; but it never enters the
heart of a rogue.
“A day or two ago, at the meeting of the Middlesex Magistrates, there was a MR. ARM-
strong—butter-hearted gentleman —who wanted to have instituted a house of industry,
wherein “discharged prisoners might resort for instruction in some useful employment, handi-
craſt, or trade.” Whereupon you, SIR PETER, turned over the whole scheme as gallantly as a
beadle with his best leg would turn over a stall of lollipops. What did you say? Why,
you called the supporters of such a scheme “visionary philanthropists!” (Upon the word of
a Zebra, SIR PETER, I responded to that sentiment three times, in three separate brayings).
And then you said:-
“‘As to reforming a thief, it was quite out of the question, Indeed, he would at any time go twenty miles
to see a reformed convict.” -
“It would be a beautiful journey, SIR PETER ; especially on foot, with a little Balm of
Gilead, or other Samaritan ointment between your hose and soles; for who would not grieve
were such a curious pilgrim to be chafed P
“And yet, with so wise a man as yourself, the City—may, the whole country—persists upon
continuing the absurd expense of prison parsons and prison schoolmasters. You know it’s
money thrown away; you know it is impossible to teach the thief the difference of ‘mine
and ‘thine;’ you know that Nature has made the felon—has hewn him for his place in the
world, like a Newgate stone—and it is only flying in the face of Fate (to the awful waste
of much siller)—to turn him into ‘the corner of the building.’
“It is grievous to think of the time and pains cast away by ‘visionary philanthropists.”
Was there not one HowARD, who (poor, creature!), had a foolish belief in the divine nature
of man? Who thought that however the jewel might have been defiled, it was still worth
the trial to cleanse and wash it from abomination? And was there, not one ElizaBETH
Ry, who went about visiting gaols to reform criminals; when, no doubt, she would have
been better employed superintending her pickles and her jams at home? It is terrible—
(looking at the thief through your strong spectacles, SIR PETER)—to consider the awful
amount of time thrown away upon him by ‘visionary philanthropists!'. What their ‘visions’
in their labour of love must have been, I know not; nor you either, I’ll be sworn, SIR PETER.
“Why don't you get into Parliament, and save honest people's money? Why throw
away parsons and schoolmasters upon thieves * You can’t make a bad shilling a good one,
by passing it from hand to hand: no; the safest way is to mail it to the counter at once.
Now, once a thief, always a thief, never let him have a second chance. Nail him for life;
for, as you say, neither parson nor schoolmaster will take the brass out, and put the true
silver into him. He'll never have an honest ring; so nail him—nail him, SIR PETER, for his
natural days.
“However, in another part of your speech you say—
“‘Then he [SIR PETEA) found from the Australian papers that convict servants were most eagerly sought
after by the residents, and that 95 out of every 100 had turned out well. All the settlers said let them have a
convict and not an emigrant for a servant, for the one would work whilst the other was on the look-out for
comfort and luxury.” - -
“This 95 per cent of repentance is a little at odds, SIR PETER, with your grand axiom
of non-reformation, and were you in Australia might cause you many a “twenty miles’ walk;
but I suppose you can account for this: no doubt, you’ll say, there’s something in geography.
“And still, SIR PETER, it is a fine creed this of yours, to have no belief in the possibility
of repentance. Do try and, make converts of everybody; for the less that’s .." to try to
reform thieves, the more shillings people will be able to afford to come and see

DREADFUL ASSAULT, AND MIRACULOUS ESCAPE. -- ---
A RESPECTABLE Englishman nearly lost his life last week on the
shores of France. He was rash enough to land at Boulogne, when he
had no sooner put foot on the French soil, than twenty hungry-looking
Commissionaires set upon him and disputed possession of his body.
His coat was instantly torn into innumerable strips. His neck-hand-
kerchief was violently pulled off, in the hopes of seducing him into the
Hôtel d’Angleterre, whilst, horrible to relate, his false collar shared the
same fate as he ran by the Hôtel de France. He was pursued through
the town by the wild gang, and many of the shopkeepers, carried away
with the excitement of seeing an Englishman, joined in the pursuit.
Nothing was heard through the town but the joyful cry of “Un Anglais.”
and the bells, by order of the Mayor, were immediately set ringing;
though rather prematurely, for the Englishman escaped, and it is not
known at present where he is concealed. His flight is all the more
wonderful, as many of the hotel-keepers were after him, and it cannot
be imagined how he got away so cheaply out of their clutches. The
fiotel du Nord has exhibited one of his coattalis in the window, with
the promise that “it shall be restored to the owner upon application;”
but the unhappy fugitive has not yet fallen into the alluring snare. The
pier-head illuminated in the evening; but alas! it was nothing better
than an optical delusion, for the greatest depression and emptiness only
reigns at present in Boulogne. The destitution can easily be imagined,
when we state positively that there are none but Frenchmen in the
town. This state of things is evidently too horrible to last !

GENTLEMAN with a wild air, wearing a white hat, and holding a
copy of the Times º; in his hand, paid a halfpenny by way
of toll at Hungerford Bridge last Friday, and saying he was
“pressed,” begged the toll-keeper to send the accompanying note
to our office. His letter bears marks of an almost maniacal excite-
ment, and we deeply grieve to say that the toll-keeper has not heard
of the gentleman since. Which way he passed over the bridge it is not for us to
say. But the most painful conjectures have been hazarded, and there is little
doubt that if he did not cross over to the Waterloo Station or elsewhere, or
takeasteamer from the bridge, he must have jumped over it, and so put a period
to an existence, which the present prevailing terror had rendered unbearable.
“POISON | POISON | POISON 1
“MR. PUNCH, -
- “I AM a family man, and a coal-merchant by F. My place of
business is at the Diamond Wharf (where I shall be happy, during the feeble
remnant of my existence, to serve you with the Wallsends, and where my father
and grandfather carried on before me), and . private residence is in Bayswater,
whither I came because I was told the suburb was not only genteel but healthy.
“My father and grandfather died at upwards of threescore and ten, living in
the City, by the river, and I had hoped our change of residence
would not hurt our condition. My wife takes a drive in the
Brougham every day by the Serpentine, and fancies herself in
the fashion, and my children go out in the Park and Kensing-
ton Gardens every day, and I thought they looked pretty ...i
My little boy got leave to fish in the Serpentine—it was MRs.
Jones's pleasure to watch him as she passed there, and we
used to sit down to the gudgeons which he caught, with no
particular relish.
“I say used, Sir, because all that sort of folly is P. now,
and I am come to a sense of my real condition. I know that
that Serpentine is a pool of death, and only wonder that people
don’t drop in as they fish there. Who knows how many do?
It was only yesterday that I saw in the papers that the
gudgeon (Faugh! the nasty little abominable beasts') ought
to be combed and washed before being served at table; and I
think it is in your own columns I have read that people who
bathe there are taken out, of a livid green colour, by the
Humane Society's hooks.
“So much for the Serpentine. Its neighbourhood ought,
by rights, to poison the air, to lower the rents in Bayswater,
to kill away the Fº: who frequent the Drive, and to turn the
Swans green. shudder, Sir, as I think of mephitic ducks
feebly flapping about in an Acheron, and Newfoundland dogs
jumping after sticks into a river of that name.
“Of my own Thames I hear no better a report. The Times
tells me (in terms of the most amiable pleasantry, it is true, and
with a º mournfulness which only renders the death-grin
infinitely more ghastly) that “the whole atmosphere of the whole
City is perpetually poisoned, from one year's end to another, by
the effluvium of this enormous sewer. And thousands of us are
going up and down by penny boats; hundreds of thousands
go to Gravesend, for what they imagine to be fresh shrimps
and fresh air; Ministers and persons of repute go and dine
at Greenwich, and partake of water-souchee and whitebait-
I see a picture of them in your journal of last week. Ah,
Sir! No wonder that LoRD John makes a wry face at the
table, and that LoRD MoRPETH is represented as withdrawn
from it alºthº, and, looking uncommonly queer! What
are we to do?. Whither are we to fly? I want to know to
what place of comparative safety I may take myself, MRs.
Jones, and our family? Where can I get awholesome diet and
an unpolluted air?
“I know very well, ever since Accum's time, indeed, that

sources of existence: My water is poisoned—I correct it, or
drink other liquids, but what are they? If I drink wine, what

ceivable combinations of pollution. If I take brandy-and-water,
I know that every sort of Cognac, except the patent British, is
a poisonous mixture, and the British, in spite of the recom-
mendations of the faculty, I cannot bring myself to like. Gin,
Sir! what is gin? turpentine, and I have no doubt arsenic and
Prussic acid in equal portions. Bitter ale? aloes and gamboge,
to say the best of it. Porter? treacle, quassia, senna, black
dose, the deuce knows what infernal medley of horrible drugs,
which must pull me down gradually to the grave. The Bottle
is sheer poison, as I know from MR. CRUIkshANK's excellent
work: but, ah me! the cistern is poisoned too; the air is
poisoned; life is poisoned; business is poisoned; pleasure is
poisoned; dinner is poisoned; tea, coffee, and muffins are
poisoned; and we are only lingering over them, knowing the
end. It is like SENEcA stepping into a hot bath, or Socrates
being served with a cup of warm drink. We take them; but
we know how they are to end—in death, death, death!
“I need scarcely say that the tea which I am in the habit of
drinking with my wife and unsuspecting family, is a poison
of the most atrocious and deadly character. its green hue
(for I take my poison mixed) is occasioned by the sheets of
copper upon which it is grilled before I use it, and the
pungency of its flavour is mainly to be attributed to verdigris.
“The quantity of white-lead which I imbibe in my milk, is
tearing my intestines to pieces, and likewise ruining the health
of MRs. Jones and my daughters. They often take tea in the
middle of the day, by way of lunch, for which meal I don’t care,
so that they poison themselves rathermore than I do. Good
Heavens! is it possible that I shall survive MRs. J., and that
she prefers her, Bohea to her husband? -
“My butter, I know, is mixed up with poisoned lard, and
my bread is compounded with flour, alum, a most consive
and dreadful poison, and the bones of animals. What do I say
—of animals?—of men, possibly, who in, life, owing to the
deleterious nature of their air and food, were in a highly
diseased state, and whose “bones we grind to make our
bread.” Graciouslowers! I shudder when I seemy daughters

with their mouths full of bread-and-butter, and think that I am bringin
up nine little ogresses. However, they are poisoning themselves, an
can’t live long.
“As for my coffee, which I have been taking after dinner for years,
I find that it is impregnated with the sulphurous and noxious fumes of
coke, with which it is roasted, and which penetrate into the iron
cylinder in which that operation is performed. As soon as I have my
coffee in my cylinder it begins to give off a gallic and malic acid, which
coming into contact with the iron, form gallates and malates of that
metal—(I feel inward agonies as I write)—and this vapour, Sir—this
infernal vapour—is again vapourised, and is assisted in its destroying
work } one of the most powerful acids known—namely, pyroligenous
acid, which is given off by the coffee most freely (and be hanged to it).
The action of this pyroligneous acid upon an iron cylinder is to create
a compound eminently disgusting to the taste; while, if I prefer a
cylinder of copper, I simply generate poison. One of these two things
I have been making and drinking through the course of a miserable life.
“Now I certainly may º at FAKIN’S, NUMBER ONE

which even the kites of little boys drop down dead in their fight), if

of taking a little more or less pyroligenous acid in my coffee?

“Welcome then, thou dark stream; let me quaff thee, thou deadly

poisoned existence much longer—I can’t bear to think of the premature
death of my children, and of MRs. Jones perishing before my eyes a
victim of a pestiferous Twankay. Good bye, my dear Punch. If any
thing happens to me, it is you, and the Times, and LoRD MoRPETH, and
FAKIN have done it. I was happy, until I knew I was so miserable.
And I know I’m poisoned now, and don't think I can survive it.”
JOHN BULL'S LAST BARGAIN.—PRICE £1,100,000!
WE may treat ourselves to a tremendous flourish of the trump
of glory.'. We have added another sprig of laurel to our plantation; a
sprig cut by British sword from the Bush. We have—let the world
ring with the glad tidings!—we have beaten the Kaffirs. But you
cannot break even such miserable bits of human pottery without gold
and silver. They can only be hammered to bits by £ s. d. There is
still the bill to pay for the damages.
The head of the interesting person that decorates these triumphant
lines is the faithful portrait (see Doctor PRITCHARD) of a Kaffir
biped. There is no doubt that such an individual—though not exactly
the person we would invite to share with us our muffin and a hand!
at whist—is of touching interest at Exeter Hall. Nevertheless, we
fear that the uncultivated reader will hold that any number of such
heads (with even the most liberal allowance for taking a quantity)
*. b: dear at the price of one million, one hundred thousand
pounds :
Nevertheless, such is the sum to be paid by John BULL for thrashing
the Kaffirs; for making them promise to be loyal subjects to QUEEN
Victor.IA, until they shall deem it profitable again to rebel!'. We
wound up the late Session of Parliament with an increased debt of two
millions; and more than half the money is thrown away upon powder
and shot wherewith to kill and subdue a horde of savages. ... Let it not
be forgotten that henceforth we pay an annual interest of thirty-seven
thousand pounds for the chains of the Kaffirs.
Thirty-seven thousand pounds a year!
The schoolmaster, says the proverb, is abroad. Well, then, Punch pro-
poses to set him the following sum:—“If it takes thirty-seven thousand
a-year to kill and conquer a certain number of Kaffirs, how much less
than the same sum . educate the like number of destitute British
children?” Surely one little English boy at school, is worth twenty
Kaffirs in the Bush.
---
THE MODEL FAST LADY.
THERE cannot be the most vulgar fraction
of a doubt that the great attribute of the
present age is Fast—very. Fast. Too
many of us are trained as if we were to
form part of “John Scot's Lot.”. It is
as clear as the course, the minute before
the Derby, that the quicker our pace in
this world, the surer we are to win.
The race of life is only to the Fastest. If
F#NieloN were asked to-morrow what
were the great requisites for a young
person to get on in the world, he would
infallibly answer, “Only three: the first
is, Be Fast; the second, Keep Fast; and
the third, Hold Fast. The MoDEL
FAST LADY acts as if she had received
this golden, or rather, brazen, advice.
Riding is one of her great hobbies. Walk-
ing is far too slow for her. A smart gallop does her such a world of
good. To be in “at the death” is a triumph for a week., You could
almost swear that the “brush” is displayed on her toilet-table.
She delights in dogs; not King Charles's, but ºf .. that live in
kennels. She takes them into the drawing-room, an es them leap
over the chairs. Her mare, too, is never out of her mouth. The
incredible things she has done with that dear creature—the tremendous
fences that she has taken, and the five-barred gates—you would scarcel
believe. It must have been born in Leap Year. If she is intimate wit
you, she will call you “my dear fellow;” and if she takes a fancy to yo
you will be addressed the first time by your Christian name, familiarise
very shortly from HENRY into HARRY. Her father is hailed as
“Governor.” Her speech, in fact, is a little masculine. If your eyes
were shut, you would fancy, it was a “Fast Man” speaking, so quick
do the “snobs,” and “nobs,” and “chaps,” and “dowdies,” “gawkies,”
“spoonies,” “brats,” and other cherished members of the Fast Human
Family run through her loud conversation. Occasionally, too, a “Deuce
take it,” vigorously thrown in, or a “Drat it,” peculiarly emphasised,
will startle you; but they are only used as interjections, and mean
nothing but “Alas!” or “Dear me!” or, at the most, “How pro-
voking !” One of her favourite words is “ Bother.” so you had better
be careful, and not “bother” her too much, or else she will be sure to
tell you, and that very plainly too.
The MoDEL FAST LADY is not particularly attached to dancing. If
she does not admire your appearance, “she was out with the hounds
this morning, and is too tired for that sort of thing.” When she does
dance, however, large officers, or colossal huntsmen are generally her
*. Her pride then is to pass everybody. She waltzes as if she
ad made a wager to go round the room one hundred and fifty times
in five minutes-and-a-quarter. If any one is pushed over by the rapidity
of her Olga revolutions, she does not stop, but merely laughs, and
“hopes no limbs are broken.”
By the bye, if she has a weakness, it is on the score—rather a º
one—of wagers. She is always betting. If you happen by some od
accident to say, “I think it will rain,” the chances are, she will imme-
diately say, “I’ll bet you 5 to lit doesn't.” She keeps a little pocket-
book to register her bets. Towards Epsom and Ascot it is almost
bursting with the odds; and she rushes about asking everybody “to
lay her something.” . She will take the field, or hedge, or back the
winner, or scratch, or do anything to oblige you. It must be mentioned,
however, that she is most honourable in the payment of her debts.
She would sell her Black Bess sooner than levant.
THE MoDEL FAST LADY has, at best, but a superficial knowledge of




## p. 129 (#137) ############################################

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 120
the art of flirting. Compliments, she calls “stuff;” and sentiment,
“namby-pamby nonsense.” She likes persons to be sensible; and has
no idea of being made a fool of . Come, don't flatter her; just help
her to a little bit more mutton, and look alive.
At a picnic she is invaluable. When your tumbler is empty, she’ll
take Champagne with you—that is to say, if you’re not too proud.
You may as well fill her glass; she has no notion of being cheated.
Here’s better luck to you! and to enforce it, she runs the point of her
parasol into your side.
In laying the déjeiner, or “snack,” as she terms it—(she is very
abstemious of foreign phrases)—she arranges the knives and forks, and
plates; mixes the salad, and at an emergency can supply a corkscrew
—it belongs to her "...". She orders all the young men about
as if they had been hired for the day, and speaks almost as familiarly
to the servants.
. Returning home she steers, and has been seen, on two or three occa;
sions, rowing. She dislike smoking? not she indeed, she’s rather fond
of it. In fact, she likes a “weed,” herself occasionally, and to convince
you will take a whiff or two. When pressed to sing, she does not
warble I'd be a Butterfly, but bursts into a Southerly Wind and a Cloudy
Sky. Her fore finger is not much needle-marked, and she laughs at
Berlin wool and all such fiddle faddle. If she makes a present to some
young gentleman of a pair of handsome emblazoned braces, she buys
them ready-made. She declares she will never marry unless her husband
is a good needle-woman. She has a pianoforte; but really she has
no * to practise. She can play a short tune on the cornet-
a-plston,
Literature is a sealed pleasure to her, though it is but fair to state she
reads Bell's Life, and has a few volumes in
her bedroom of the Sporting Magazine. She
knows there was a horse of the name of Byron.
She plays at cards—not for love, but
money; but before beginning, she is honest
cheats; and if detected, only says, “Well, I
told you so.” She has no great yearning for
canaries, or any birds, excepting in their gravy
and bread-sauce state. She went out shootin
once, but gave it up, “the boobies laughe
and stared so.”. Fishing is a different thing,
but it’s stupidly slow; she would as soon
mend stockings any day.
The FAST LADY rather avoids children. If a baby is put into her
hands, she says, “Pray, somebody, come and take this thing, I’m afraid
of dropping it.” She prefers the society of men, too, to that of her own
sex. After dinner she is very quiet, turns over in silence the engravings
of some picture-book, but directly the gentlemen enter the drawing-
room she is chatty again, and “begs to return thanks for the honour
º: gentlemen have done the ladies in drinking their very good
eallins.
Her costume is not regulated much by the Fashions, and she is always
the first to come down when the ladies have gone up stairs to change
their dress. Gay colours please her the most, and †. succeeds, gene-
rally, in attracting notice by some peculiarity; either, on an evening,
by the largeness of her bouquet, .."
about her hair, or, when out walking, having an ugly monster of a dog
following her, or a big footman walking after her with a basket full of
kittens; or else she will promenade the streets in a riding-habit, and
the people will stare about in all directions, to see what has become of
the horse; and all this passes to her infinite amusement.
Her greatest accomplishment is to drive. . With the whip in one
hand, and the reins in the other, and a key-bugle behind, she would
not exchange places with the QUEEN herself. It is rumoured, also,
that she can swim, but there is no authentic proof of this.
With all these peculiarities and manly addictions, however, the FAST
LADY is good-hearted, very good natured, and never guilty of what
she would call “a dirty action.” Her generosity, too, must be included
amongst her other faults, for she gives to all, and increases the gift by
...'. She is always in good humour, and, like gentle, dulness,
dearly loves a joke. She is an excellent daughter, and her father doats
on her, and lets her do what she likes, for “he knows she will never
do anything wrong, though she is a strange girl.” In the country she
is greatly beloved. The poor people call her “a dear good Miss,” and
present their petitions, and unfold all their little griefs to her. She is
continually having more presents of pups sent to her than she knows
what to do with. The farmers too sonsult her about their cows and
pigs, and she is the godmother to half the children in the parish.
Her deficiencies, after all, are more those of manner than of feeling.
She may be too largely gifted with the male virtues, but then she has
a very sparing collection of the female vices; that is to say, she has no
taste for ill-natured scandal, is not given to novels, flirting, or jilting,
and is no more a coquette than the Lady in the lobster, that great
model of the female sex. Nature may be to blame for having made
her one of the weaker vessels, but imperfect and manly as she is, she
still retains the inward gentleness of the woman, and many fine ladies,
enough to give warning that she always

THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OUT OF TUNE.
- EIN HERE PUNCH, “Elysian Fields, Sept. 14, 1848.
“‘What, I believe one of your English proverbs
asks, “does it matter provided you are in a state of feli-
- city ?’ That such is my agreeable condition you will
perceive from date of this epistle; but although I do not trouble
myself with the affairs of your world, I have not ceased to take, a
kindly interest in them. I now regard with a lofty º the
servility which moved my bile so long as I had any. hilst upon
earth, there was nothing that I despised and detested more than
flunkeyism. At present, I only i. with pity on that thorough-
base element in the ‘still sad music of humanity. . It was merely
with this mild feeling that I read a statement—which I shall presently
subjoin—in the Times this morning at breakfast-for the news-
papers (especially Punch) are a portion of our beatitudes, and form
a regular addition to our matutinal nectar and ambrosia, I perceive
that yesterday a symphony of mine was performed at the Norwich
Mººl Festival, and that your DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE went to hear it.
nd that-
“The symphony had already begun, the first movement indeed was over, and the
intermezzo in process of performance, but at the entrance of the illustrious visitor:
M. BENED1ct stopped the band, and the National Anthem was immediately begun.’
“Now, I am far above being personally offended at the interruption
of my symphony in order to compliment a Duke; but I must, quite
dispassionately, remark that the barbarity was gross, and the motive
contemptible. It is merely with the abstract low-mindedness of the
proceeding that I am disgusted. I assure you I am not at all indig-
nant—only scandalised. I feel justified—not proud-in asserting
that I am any nobleman's betters. Royal Dukes used to take off their
hats to me, and very properly. Kings have stopped to speak to me.
Genius is more worthy of honour than rank. - -
“Observe, that I care for nothing but the principle. To me, had
the symphony been MozART's, or MENDELssoHN's, it would have been
all one. If it is unmannerly to interrupt any man while he is speaking,
what a rudeness it must be to arrest the effusion of a master spirit
discoursing sublime music! Besides, any well-constituted mind-
speak it not vainly, but philosophically—would have been so absorbed
in my harmonies, as not to have observed the entrance even of a monarch.
But to proceed:–
“The Duke was loudly cheered on his entry, and after the Anthem, and acknow-
ledged the compliment by repeated salutations. He then took his place on a chair
of state made for this special occasion, and the performance was resumed from the
point at which it had been interrupted.”
“The National Anthem is all very well in its proper place, as for
instance in such a medley as the Battle of Prague, but what business-
with all seraphic calmness let me ask—had it in my symphony? The
honour intended to be done to the Duke of CAMBRIDGE would have
been rendered more effectually by giving him credit for having so much
good taste as to be unwilling to be noticed till my piece was over. The
performance, of course, was spoiled. That is no annoyance to me, who
can no longer suffer from being murdered, but it must have greatly
vexed all those present possessed of any soul for music. . It would be
awful to think º: state of M. BENEDict's—if the atrocity lay at his
door, and not at that of the Directors. Otherwise I should be obliged
to express the hope that in future he would take a higher tone in
conducting himself, and any composition by,
“Your humble Servant,
“L. von BEETHOVEN.”
“P. S. You have heard of “tears such as angels weep’. at anything
that is very melancholy. You will now have an opportunity of seeing
what they are; for I have been crying profusely over this letter, and it
is quite saturated with them. “L. V. B.”

MASTER JACKEY HAVING SEEN A “PROFESSOR” of PosturiNG, HAs A PRIVATE PERFORMANCE OF HIs own IN THE NURSERY.
THE QUEEN IN SCOTLAND.
By our own Halfpenny-a-liner.
S. ARRIVED at Aberdeen only just in time to witness the arrival of
HER MAJESTY, who has taken us all by surprise by getting here
twelve hours before we expected her. Fortunately MR. ABER-
NETHY happened to be at the dock as the royal yacht hove to,
when he, with great presence of mind, though unprepared with
other refreshment, offered the QUEEN an Abernethy biscuit,
which was graciously declined. No sooner was the intelligence made
known, than the inhabitants were thrown into the greatest excitement.
The LoRD PRovost perched himself on the end of the Jetty, surrounded
by the Corporation, and after sitting there some hours, moved off on
the assurance that the QUEEN had nointention of landing there until the
next morning.
Being desirous of presenting an address, the LoRD PRovost and party
drove down in the Captain's gig, and being hauled on to the deck, were
introduced to the QUEEN, whose attention, was called to that extra-
ordinary animal of the human species, a city baillie. Several specimens
of the tribe were shown to HER MAjesty, who expressed her pleasure
at witnessing the curiosity, which had hitherto only fallen under her
notice in WALTER Scott's novels. Though I had not the impertinence
to remark particularly HER MAJESTY's dress, I learnt from one of my
fellow-reporters, who was on duty, with his eye-glass and sketch-book,
for an Illustrated Newspaper, that the QUEEN wore a simple straw bonnet,
a Paisley shawl, a dress of Orleans cloth, kid gloves, leather shoes, silk
parasol, and muslin mittens.
.The youthful PRINCE OF WALEs was dressed after your celebrated
picture of him, where he is ſºlented handing a glass of grog to a
tar to drink his mamma's health.
The landing of the royal pair was a magnificent sight, and I have
looked through the dictionary in vain to find words capable of describing
it. MR. ABERNETHY, supported by two of his own, biscuits, which he
had taken for luncheon, led off. The scene altogether was most bril-
liant; and as the pensioners, drawn up in single files—including the
old married files—hobbled ; with their silver hair sparkling in the
sun, the effect was truly electrical. + × * +
Qur reporter goes on at considerable length; but we are so disgusted
with his vulgar and inquisitive intrusion upon the leisure and amuse:
ment of Royalty, that we omit the remainder of his account, and
request that he will send us no more of his impertinence.
A REPUBLICAN MYTH.
WE take the following from the French newspapers:—
“A young ourang-outang has lately been brought to the Garden of Plants, and is
the object of almost universal curiosity. The animal is only six months old, but has
all the appearance of a child aged three years, of a grave and reflecting character.
He is at the same time very affectionate, shaking hands kindly, but with a certain
Arabian solemnity, with the keepers. He feeds delicately, taking roast meat, wine,
chocolate, and even liqueurs. Being very susceptible of the cold, he sleeps between
a large cat and a rough-coated dog, and wraps them both, as well as himself, in a
blanket. In the daytime he is dressed in a red-coloured blouse and white pantaloons.”
The above is a very fair specimen of the political satire of our neigh-
bours. It is, however, so delicate that—without the aid of Punch—the
hasty reader may fail to see the deep meaning enshrined in it. Punch
will endeavour to pluck out the heart of the mystery. The ourang-
outang then—it cannot be doubted—is Louis-NAPOLEON: he is a very
yºung republican, scarcely six months old; but has the “ appearange”
of a “grave reflecting ” politician of maturer time. He is “very affec-
tionate, shaking hands, kindly” with the Communists. “He feeds
delicately” and takes wine. His *. and cellar, when he sailed to
invade Boulogne, leave no doubt of the circumstance. Being susceptible
of cold, he seeks for a warm place between a cat and a dog. . In other
words, Louis NApoleon, for a snug berth, is willing to avail himself of
extreme parties. The red-coloured blouse is, of course, a significant
compliment to the République Rouge.
RAPID IMPROVEMENT OF MAChinery.
LAST year we had the Talking Machine.
This year we have had MR. CHIsholm ANSTEY.
Gracious Goodness! what shall we have next year?

OUR COMMITTEE ON T
THE House of Commons appointed, in the
course of the Session, its Committee to con-
sider the best means of promoting the despatch
of public business. As the fourth Great Estate
of the Realm, we, by request of the Public,
some time since constituted ourselves and Toby
a Committee for the same purpose, and we now
beg to present the following Report to the
Sovereign Public:-
Your Committee first proceeded to make itself
comfortable. It then attempted to discover the
amount of business, public and private, which
the collective wisdom of the 658 gentlemen
of the Commons, had managed to get through
in ten months, allowing six days to the week,
and six hours to the day. For this purpose it
first attempted to read the debates in the Times
newspaper, but finding this quite impossible,
great confusion of mind being produced after
the first month's reading, and symptoms of
decided imbecility arising during the second,
your Committee proceeded to measure the said
debates. They find that they extend over a
space of 17,684 yards, or something above ten
miles, of newspaper type, Times column.
Your Committee then proceeded to siſt the
said ten miles of chaff in search of results and
ideas. But the quantity of both discovered was
so far inappreciable as to defy representation
in any figures or symbols with which your Com-
mittee is familiar.
Your Committee next made a summary of the
number, character, and labours of the various
Committees, public and private, of the Session.
They are glad to report that the incubations or
sittings of these Committees have been as close
as those of the most affectionate and devoted
hen on record, their united length amounting
to 1648 hours.
Your Committee then proceeded to examine
the results of these extraordinary incubations,
but cannot discover that anything has been
hatched, beyond half-a-dozen Reports, more or
less unreadable. Whether this melancholy con-
trast between the sedentariness and the success
of honourable gentlemen proceeds from their
brains having been addled, your Committee
cannottake upon itself to say. Your Committee
would suggest an application of MR. CANTELo's
steam-hatching apparatus to Parliamentary
Committees.
Your. Committee were anxious to have
weighed the 18,450 petitions presented during
the Session, but found that no weight whatever
had been given them in the House.
Your Committee notice with alarm that the
talk of the House seems continually on the
increase. The characteristic of the present
Session has been the number of persons who,
having nothing to say on any subject, have
ersisted, at great length, in saying it on all.
tisunfortunate that this tendency should have
HE PUBLIC BUSINESS
been in some degree encouraged by HER MA-
Jesty’s Ministers, who, by doing nothing
through the year, left the more time for talking.
In fact, there being no Acts worth mentioning,
the time of the Session has necessarily been
devoted to words. -
To assist these inquiries your Committee
sought counsel of everybody but the Speaker,
as the mischief seemed to originate in there
being too many Speakers already. They have
received 400 distinct plans for improving the
business arrangements of the House of Com-
mons, including six from LoRD BRough AM,
-
each contradicting the other. All these plans,
however d r, concur in certain sugges-
tions, viz.:-
1. That a Gagging Bill be passed expressly
for MEssRs. CHIsholm ANSTEY and URQUHART,
who are to be thereby declared silent en perma-
*ence, and not to be allowed to address the
|House, except in writing, and then only in
short-hand.
| ºſinisters, befºre they bring in a bill,
know their own minds, if they have any; and if
not, say so to the House at once.
3. That LoRD MoRPETH be squeezed before
coming into the House, in order to save the
time of the House, now regularly devoted to
that process.
4. That Lord GeoRGE BENTINck be totally
debarred all access to Trade Circulars, Ready
Reckoners, Statistical Compilations, and gene-
rall I figures, except Figures of Speech,
which he is to be allowed to cullwhere he likes,
except in Billingsgate.
5. That SIR CHARLEs Wood be instructed
in the method of book-keeping by single and
double entry, and the rules of arithmetic up to
Vulgar Fractions, the expense of such instruc-
tion to be defrayed out of the Consolidated Fund.
This, it is hoped, will save the time now con-
sumed by the Housein exposing and correcting
the Right Honourable Gentleman's arithmetical
blunders.
6. That Mr. Punch be allowed to put a stop
to a debate at any moment, subject to the
obligation of justifying himself to the public
for exercising this absolute power of la clºture.
After as full a deliberation as circumstances
would permit, Mr. Punch being extremely
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
anxious to be off to the Moors, your Committee
agreed unanimously to the following recom-
mendations:-
That, when the order of the day is moved,
the disorder of the night shall at once be put a
* to.
hat Members snoring so loud on the back
benches, or in the galleries, as to interrupt the
speech of any Honourable Member, be imme-
diately awakened by the Serjeant-at-arms, and
sentenced to remain awake through such a
number of the heaviest class of speeches as the
Speaker may think fit to appoint.
That before a Billis discussed in Committee,
Honourable Members shall make themselves
acquainted with its contents.
hat no allusion to, “self-government” or
“centralisation” be allowed in any debate, on
any pretext whatever.
That Honourable Members be allowed a cer-
tain time for speaking, proportioned to theideas
they may have to convey; as, five minutes for
a speaker with one idea, ten for one with two,
and so on. It is supposed that, practically,
this willcome to the same thing as the American
one-hour rule, as it is not conceived that any
speech was ever made in the House containing
more than one dozen ideas.
That,for enforcing the above rule, the Speaker
be furnished with an hour-glass, and a list of
#: supplied by each gentleman on catching
ls eye.
It * worthy of consideration, whether the
shutting up of BELLAMY's and the tea-room
might not operate º in shortening
the ºf: of the House...The practice of
denying the necessaries of life to Jurymen is
found to stimulate them very much to that
unanimity which is required by the law in their
decisions. -
But your Committee wish to say, in conclu-
sion, that they cannot much rely on any restric-
tive rules for the prompt and efficient discharge
of public business. They would suggest that,
after all, the country has the matter in its own
hands. If the present public servants cannot
or will not do its work, it must find others that
will. Perhaps this would be the most certain
and shortest way to bring about the result, for
the forwarding of which your Committee was
appointed.
MR. PUNCH.

SCENERY AND COSTUME OF THE STAGE.
THERE is something very peculiar
in the rural landscapes and the
town residences inhabited by the
dramatic population, if we are to
judge of the haunts of their rustics
and the dwelling-places of their
citizens by the representations of
these places which we see upon
the British stage. The dramatic
idea of the country consists usually
of a series of set pieces, backed by
a six-inch deal bridge, surmount-
ing a two-foot waterfall, and
leading to a profile cottage of such
diminutive dimensions that when
the feet of any one entering it are
on the basement, his head soars
into the second story, and he can-
not, without doubling himself com-
pletely up, go either in or out of
the door. In some cases the
- --- - cottages have no pretension to
habitable qualities, but are simply “made out” of a single piece of canvas, on which a clearly
impracticable” window is painted, and which the business of the scene does not require to
he ºpened, the ºttage being only needed as the cue for sºme song or ºnliment, such as
Ah! that humble cot–how its aspect makes me sigh for Home, Sweet Home!” or, “The
sight of that igwly roof makes me feel no envy for pampered pride in its palace, or venal villany
in its vila; for I am convinced more and more º the º truth, that it is in the
cottage alone contentment can be found.”
Sometimes there is, by way of back-ground, a castle, frightfully foreshortened, with its battle-
ments half-a-yard º and its towers towering among the sky-borders, while its foundations
rest on a rock no higher than the top of the low comedian's hat; but the structure, is
sufficient to admit of its being apostrophised by some young gentleman in hessians and a
chocolate surtout, as “Deserted halls of my ancestors, whose pavements have rung to the clang
of the usurper's hoof, and whose donjon-keep has echoed to the noisy revels of a stranger band.”
When the occasion is an operaticone, the distant
castle forms an admirable subject for something
like the following-
Recitative.
Long cherished pile—home of my ancient sires,
Your aspect kindles all my youthful fires;
And when your sainted towers salute mine eyes,
Within my breast revengeful feelings rise.
Every playgoer is familiar with the “mossy
bank” of dramatic rural scenery, with one end
slightly elevated for the head of the weary way:
farer or benighted traveller, and a bit of an old
bolster craftily crammed underneath the canvas
to complete the mossiness of the contriyance.
The town scenery of the stage is not less pecu-
liar than its landscapes, and the exteriors are
particularly tº: for teaching “what to avoid”
to the youthful architect. If young Dashington
calls upon Lord Toploſſy, the latter lounges lazily
out of the first-floor French window, in which
his head and shoulders are a pretty tight fit,
while the former bears about the same proportion
to the house that the peasant bears to the cot-
tage we have already been speaking of. It is a
singular fact that the inside of anyoneroom is no
sooner represented to us, than we find it to be
much larger than the whole house when judged
by its external appearance; and though the man-
sion itself may º only ten feet high from the
basement to the tip of the topmost chimney-pot,
the smallest apartment is found to be as wide as
the wings are apart, and as lofty as the pro-
scenlund.
In costume, the stage presents some really
astounding phenomena;
and we have often been
struck by the similarity of
the dresses worn by the
retainers of every country
every age, and indeed ºf
almost every family. One
would think that the word

The same “singleness of purpose”, which is observable in the ward-
robe of the retainer, whatever may be the era, the clime, or the interest,
in which we find him, may be noticed also
in the dramatic old man, the dramatic soldier,
and the dramatic nobleman. Semility knows
no other distinction than a coachman's wig,

Wanted, a Librarian-with no Prospects.
THE National Advertiser (Glasgow) of the 6th inst. was enriched with
these golden lines, set forth as tidings of peculiar promise to students
knowing in Hebrew, Greek, and German:-
ANTED, a LIBRARIAN for LIBRARY, who will be required to
give his whole time and attention to the Business of the Library. None need
apply whose present intentions or prospects are towards any profession or business
that may lead them to retire from the situation at a future period. Preference will
be given to a Candidate who can read the Hebrew, Greek, and German characters.
The emoluments will be about £60 per annum. Security for intromissions to the
amount of £200 will be required.
Applications, under sealed covers, addressed to “The Lord Provost, President of
's Library,” must be left at the City Chamberlain's Office, on or before Twelve

into collision, when the rival battalions stick it into one another in a
style that cannot be pleasant, excepting to those who are in the habit of
meeting and taking * bills. ne day Louis-NAPOLEON is in the
ascendant; the next, he is pasted over with CAVAIGNAc, In the
morning Paris is stained with the sheets of the Red Republic; and in
the evening it is completely riddled with the fiery broadsides of the
rapacious Communists, who, it is to be hoped, will always be sent to the
wall, and always kept there, since their aim is to board everything.

These battles, however, are rarely attended with any other loss than
that of a smart brush or two, and the combatants, who are generally
great sticklers for outward forms, do not break the laws of Convention
more than pulling down everything which they are not paid to main-
tain. With them, “à las Henri V. Z.” and “a bas” this, that, and the
other, and everybody, is not only a cry, but a fact, which they proceed
vigorously to carry out, unless they have received some very weighty
reasons, to support the Hero of the Hour in the temporary elevation
which they may have given him. If you want to reign over Paris, and
to have your name become a household word, you must not disaffect
the army, or bribe the “incorruptibles,” or undermine the “Montagne,”
or make all right with the gauche, but you must buy up all the bill.
stickers. The throne of France (if there is to be had such an article
at any frippier's) is to be gained, not by a coup de main, but by a bold
stroke of the paste-brush. Louis-NAPOLEON, it is said, has the greatest
chance, owing to the fact, of which he is very tenacious, that there is
more paste about him than any other pretender.
OUR OWN LITTLE RAILWAY ONCE MORE I
THE º meeting of shareholders in our pet Railway at
Kensington, has just taken place, and the usual clamour was got up
for the working of the line. Not satisfied with the Great Western
having bought it, the shareholders call upon that Company to work it.
but Messrs. GLYN, BRUNEL, and SAUNDERs, think they have done
uite, enough in setting a couple of creepers to run upon, the Line.
e think so too; for we do not quite see the use of re-establis the
communication between the Scrubs of Wormwood, and the shrubs of
Warwick Square, or sending a lot of guards and policemen_rattlin
backwards and forwards between Shepherd's Bush and the Hand an
Flower, bringing nothing but misery in their train. -
We understood that there was some talk of an extension branch;
but we found on inquiry, that the rumour arose from the old, elder at
one of the stations, who has been sending forth several new branches
from his trunk line. We believe the Electric, Telegraph is let out for
the purpose of drying clothes; and an Act will be applied for, to give
the concern the name of the Great Kensington Clothes Line, in the
next Session of Parliament.

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTION.
, HE British Constitution is one of
§ those magnificent mixtures, , for
! which the recipe has long been
lost, and of which every one acknow-
ledges the merit, though none can
say what are the ingredients. The
British Constitution, like the Scotch
Ale, the London Porter, and the
Irish Whisky, has a reputation, no
one knows why, for no one knows
what ; but it shares with the articles
mentioned the character of being
|| the very best of its kind, and the
| very highest of its order. As in the
case of the Ale, the Porter, and
the Whisky, it is doubtful whether
the peculiar virtue resides in the
quality of the water used for the
first, the quantity of Spanish liquorice
- - stirred up with the second, or the
precise, amount of smoke mingled with the malt in the third, so it is
impossible to say in what especial attribute the great strength of the
British Constitution resides. England's Palladium, like its plum-
pudding, is a magnificent hodge-podge that every one admits the
#. of; but when we come to analyse either—to separate the hodge
rom the podge, and reduce it to its component parts--we feel that we
are dealing, as it were, with Humpty-Dumpty after his fall from the
wall, and that if we once take the British Constitution to pieces, not
“All the Queen's horses,
And all the QUEEN's men,”
could make “the mixture as before,” or render the British Constitu-
tion, like Richard III, itself again.
It has been wisely said by one of our modern historians,” that England
must have the Constitution of a horse; and the proud manner in which
it is now rearing its head, while other countries are riding their wretched
hobbies and cutting the most miserable capers, may be regarded as an
apt illustration of the peculiarly happy simile. A nation, like a
uadruped, can no sooner throw off the reins of all power than it soon
finds itself without a bit in its mouth, in more ways than one, and it
goes, off, too frequently, in a headlong course of ruin and anarchy.
While, however, we are prepared to acknowledge our own Constitution
as the best in the world, we are not going to pin our faith implicitly to
the tail of the British Lion, nor hang up our judgment on the hat-peg
which the Unicorn wears in place of a hat; but we shall examine the
whole fabric with a critical eye, and shall, without ceremony, knock off
much of that plastering which the trowel of flattery has laid far too
thickly on, for the purpose of smoothing over many of the defects and
irregularities that exist in the really noble structure.
he preceding remarks are intended merely as an introduction of our
subject to the reader; but lest our intention may have been smothered
in our words, like a rabbit in its attendant onions, we beg leave to
complete the ceremony in due form; and therefore, with the simple
observation—“The Reader, the British Constitution; the British
Constitution, the Reader—you really ought to know each other,”—
we proceed to our important task.
CHAPTER THE FIRST.
FIRST CAUSES OF THE LIBERTY OF THE ENGLISH NATION.
E should very properly expect to be rebuked for
{ our impertinence, by the very youngest of our
readers, and our conscience would certainly pinch
us for our stale news, if we were to announce
as a new fact, that Great Britain was abandoned
by the Romans, when they found it necessary to
, look at home, and desist—as SPELMAN, the great
- sacrificer of spelling, says – from “Romeing
abroad.”
It is, however, undoubtedly true that the origin of our becoming our
own masters, was our not being worth the trouble of keeping; and
our first freedom came to us in the shape of a kick, which sent us
about our business, to get on as we could by ourselves. No sooner
were we abandoned by the Romans as mere leavings, than there came
from the shores of the Baltic small picnic parties, to avail themselves
of the nice pickings we might still present; and, having destroyed the
* The Comic History of England. We are unable to remember the page, the
chapter, the book, or the volume, but theso points may all be ascertained, and the
idea referred to may be found, by a perusal of the entire work.
ancient inhabitants or earliest pot-wallopers, these gentlemen began
wallopping each other, because it was the only occupation—except the
occupation of the place itself—which the island seemed to afford.
After a good deal of Baltic sound and fury, signifying nothing, and
after the establishment of a set of small sovereignties, which, under
the name of the Hep-
tarchy, kept the place
in a state of sevens—
if not of sixes also-
for many years, the
whole southern part
of the island was
united under that il-
lustrious seven in one,
the renowned EGBERT.

the East Angles, who
knew their own interest too well to resist. He reduced Mercia
without mercy; deputed his son to ravage Kent, whose people were
soon led a pretty dance among their native hops; while the same
bold youth was despatched to Essex, whose inhabitants were pillaged of
their herds until they had not a leg to stand upon, and were deprived
even of their exceedingly popular calves. Northumberland, in the
- midst of a civil commotion, very civilly
offered EGBERT the somewhat shaky
throne, which no other upholsterer,
whether royal or otherwise, seemed so
likely as himself to be able to uphold.
Making short work of further opposition,
and in no quarter doing anything by
halves, he managed to achieve the extra-
- - ordinary feat of sitting, not simply upon
wº two, but upon no less than seven stools,
without falling to the ground. Qur Constitution had not advanced very
far in its formation at this early period; and as to our liberties, we
had little to boast of under that head, unless they could have been
beaten into us by the series of drubbings we received. The grand
principle of Government appears to have consisted in the right of some
powerful personage to do what he liked with our ancestors' own, until
the Anglo-Saxon princes licked us a little into shape, after the various
unprofitable lickings we had endured.
ALFRED THE GREAT, who was less happy
at cooking a cake than concocting a code
was the most illustrious of this line, an
Edward THE CoNFEssor, who seldom
kept himself out of a hobble, was exactly
what nature fitted him to be—the last of
his race. He had, however, in violation
of the strict principles of copyright,
compiled a body of laws out of those
framed by his predecessors, and he dis-
honestly put his own name on the title-
F. of the piratical work. Little is
nown of our Constitution, under this
successional crop of early Royals, until
that Pink of invaders, {º familiarly as Sweet WILLIAM THE
Conqueres, shot up on our soil. -
There had previously been a King and a Nobility; but SIR WILLIAM
TEMPLE, who gives us this information, might fairly take for his
motto-
“I tell thee all, I can no more—
Though poor the offering be;”
for poor, indeed, is this contribution of SIR WILLIAM's to our early
Constitutional history.
It is from the Conquest we are told to date the real commencement
of our freedom; and it is a remarkable illustration of the wisdom of the
maxim, “Spare the rod, spoil the child,” that the more we have been
thrashed, the stronger our liberties have grown, as if, like an old carpet,
we wanted a good beating to show us in our true colours., WiLLIAM
of NorMANDY turned his sword at once into a carving-knife, with
which he sliced up our native land, and divided the bits, among his
followers. He treated Old England like its own immortal roast beef,
and finding it in capital cut, he, without making any bones.about it,
roceeded to serve it out, by distributing large helpings of, it among
#. hungry retinue. In his large interpretaſion of the word meum, he
altogether lost sight of its ordinary companion tuum, and he appropri-
ated the land so extensively that he left no other possession but self-
possession to its former owners. He handed over the soil to his
creatures, who held it subject to WILLIAM's will, and thus what is
termed the Feudal,” System was established in England.
WOL. XW.
* We do not mean to go into the depths of philology as to the derivation of the
word feudal from feud, feudum, fides, fief, or fife; for, as Spelman say”, “that
fife has been already too much played upon.”

WILLIAM evinced all the carving qualities of a Vauxhall waiter; for,
as that expert practitioner has been known to cut up a single ham into
fourteen hundred shilling plateſuls, with a surplusage of several six:
nny sandwiches, so William THE CONQUEROR is said to have divided
ngland into sixteen thousand two hundred and fifteen military fiefs.
To pursue the figure of the ham-it will be remembered, by the way,
that WILLIAM landed at Sandwich—those soldiers, who knew on which
side their bread was buttered, accepted with eagerness the slice that
was proffered to them, with all the conditions annexed. The recipients
of these fiefs were to take up arms when called upon, and it was death
to write upon their doors “Not at home, returnin an hour,” when this
call was made. - - - - -

the law entirely in his own hands.
He was his own judge, his own jury, his own counsel, occasionally
his own witness; and, in fact, the whole affair was a sort of At-Home,
after the manner of the late MR MATTHEws, or MR. YATEs, the whole
of the characters being sustained by our old friend the Conqueror.
The reader may, by this time, have begun to wonder what the pranks
of WILLIAM can have to do with the birth of Liberty; but as our
predecessor, DE LoLME, has it, “The seed, though it seemed to be
smothered, was imbibing nourishment for future sap" amid the sappies
of the period. The i is, that the Barons had nothing else to talk
about but their wrongs, until at last one noble Spooney, who was rather
more shrewd than the rest, suggested the possibility of one man being
being domineered
resisted by a thousand, instead of the thousan -
over by one,—a state of things which they had all been consenting to.
The Barons, however, from whom it is thought in these days so great
a glory to be descended, were still as ſunky as a boy when he first
“knuckles down” at marbles, and the whole number of aristocratic
souls, still shaking in twice the number of shoes, were glad to get the
people to join in a confederacy for setting bounds to the royal authority,
or in other words º the Norman WILL from too arbitrary

A STATESMAN'S LAST “RESOURCE.”
EITHER PRINCE JoinviLLE, pen in hand, has drawn at once a very
sharp and very delicate likeness of his father, or the name of the Prince
has been subscribed to the pen-and-ink sketch of another artist. Cer-
tainly the production reaches the French newspapers a little circuitously
being first despatched from the Tuilleries (where the letter “was foun
on February 24th”) to Algiers, to be printed in the Akhar. True or
spurious, the letteris very good; indeed, as an evidence of its astounding
#. the Post assures the world that the missive might have been
written' for its own columns !
There is, however, one little sentence that makes us suspect the
imputed authorship of the letter. The writer touches upon the self-
destruction of BREsson:-
“People will not fail to repeat, and will enlarge upon what I consider as dangerous
—viz., the action which he (le pere) exercises over everything. This inflexible
action, when a statesman compromised with us cannot vanquish it, leaves no other
resource than suicide!”
So when a statesman is snubbed by a King, he has “no other resource”
than rope, poison, steel, or lead. A Monarch is pig-headed, and in the
self-devotion of his sorrow, his Minister must cease to be! Let this
be received as a political axiom, and an appointment to place may
be thus gazetted:—“To-day, Monsieu R — received the portfolio
for Foreign Affairs and-Prussic Acid;” in order that when His Gracious
Majesty is “inflexible” in his “action,” the victim Minister may at any
moment have his “resource” at hand.

A Nice Calculation.
THE Health of Towns Magazine says:—
“The amount of hard cash paid for intoxicating drinks in the Metropolis alone is
three millions sterling per annum. This sum, if spent in sewers, would afford up-
wards of seventeen hundred miles at 6s. 8d. per foot run, and of ample capacity for
the largest thoroughfare, if the supply of water were good.”
Now, take it that every Alderman of the City of London consumes,
at the Mansion House and Guildhall, say £10 in wine per annum;-this
sum, devoted to drainage, would, at the above computation, give to
every said Alderman the delightful satisfaction of having every year
thirty feet in the sewers. Thirty feet! This is tremendous; when, at
the best, in any sewer, a rat has only four.

AVILION, BRIGHTON.—If one Gronge the Fourtn, who some years
ago left several ARTICLES OF FURNITURE at the Brighton Pavilion, does not
cause them to be removed without delay, they will be sold to help to pay the expenses.
It is the more necessary that the said effects be removed with all despatch, as within
the last ten years they have cost for warehouse-room (laid out upon repairs of the
said Pavilion) eighteen thousand, seven hundred and nineteen pounds, of the coin
(of the pockets of the people) of this realm.
BREADALBANE, Chamberlain.
Government is only taking due time to vouchsafe a due reward. It
is, it must be, in such a case, difficult to square the honour, to the
merits of the deserving... Well, we have not been disappointed. The
. Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to consider
|? the best mode of providing additional room for works of Art given
to the public,”—the Committee have made their report, and, making
it, have nobly satisfied MR. WERNoN :—
“Your Committee are *. to pass from this topic without recording their
sense of the public spirit and considerate liberality which have prompted this living
bequest on the part of Ma. VERNoN, and they entertain no doubt that the public grati-
tude will furnish the most powerful incentive for eliciting further instances of
munificence similar in kind, as well as the most honourable reward to him who has
afforded this noble example.”
|.The Committee “entertain no doubt” of public gratitude; no doubt
of MR. WERNoN’s “most honourable reward ' " This is satisfactory.
May we, however, ask of the Ministry when the public gratitude, as
|vouchsafed to MR. VERNoN, will be made visible to the naked eye?
—when the “reward” will be manifested? We have good reasons for
our anxiety., For at this moment we know of twenty galleries about to
be given to the nation; the gift only delayed until the donors may feel
certain that they shall not be seized and knighted. It is rumoured that
MR, WERNoN himself has had a very narrow escape.

WE take the following from the Builder:–
“A statue of Venus Rising from the Sea was hotly bid for by two rival agents,

We congratulate his Royal Highness. It is not always that the

THE INWASION OF FOLKESTONE.
THE quiet little town of Folks-long since jum-
bled orthographically into Folkestone-was
thrown into a state of extreme agitation a few
days ago by the arrival of some of the National
Guards of France, in their uniforms, by the boat
from Boulogne. As soon as the vessel was seen
in the offing, bearing down under the able sea-
manship of CAPTAIN Monger—who adapts his
signals so thoroughly to the state of the ocean,
that every wave of his hand seems to be called
for by some wave of NEPTUNE–a report was
raised that the French soldiery were on the
point of invading our shores, and Folkestone
instantly took an attitude of defence... A depu-
tation from the Pavilion Hotel waited upon MR. FAULKNER, the intelli-
gent Consul, and requested him to assume the command. Having
consulted his own inclination, and retired into his brown study to
deliberate, MR. FAULKNER drew up a plan of the operations that he
desired to recommend. He ordered aſ: the posts on the pier to be
immediately doubled, and he advised that the chain of communication
should be unbroken; a measure that rendered it necessary to send for
the ironmonger, as part of the chain of communication between the
posts had for some time been out of repair.
Recollecting what had been done with the lines at Torres Wedras, he
sent for the thickest clothes-line the place could afford, and had it
arranged in such a manner that persons landing from the boat would
still have this line to pass; and, having called out a detachment of light
portery from the railway station, he placed them in such a position that
everything coming off a vessel must fall into their hands. These pre-
cautions having been taken, he sat down upon the pier parapet, as if
wrapt in deep thought; and as the inhabitants gathered round him
with eager interest, to catch from the expression of his features the
result of his deliberations, the scene strongly resembled the celebrated
picture of NAPOLEON's famous bivouac.
At length the vessel came round the pier point, and MR. FAULKNER,
placing himself in the gap, while one of his trusty officers appeared in
the van-used for carrying ". very stones of Folkestone
seemed ready to rise as one block against the expected foe. By a
prompt intelligence between CAPTAIN MongeB and MR. FAULKNER,
the fact was ascertained that the French invaders were only National
Guards come over from the Boulogne Fête to take a peep at England;
and, beyond the firing of a few charges into them from the Pavilion
Hotel-none of the charges being very heavy—the visitors were utterly
unmolested, and many of them left for London by the first train.
RESPECTABLE CRUELTY.
We think, if we wanted to bait a badger, or fight a main of cocks, or
skin a cat alive, or indulge in any other of those recreations proscribed
by the law under the head of “Cruelty to Animals,” we should—having
first taken care to put our best clothes on—repair to the City. This,
at least, we should do if we expected to be called to account for such
conduct before MR. ALDERMAN CHALLs. The reason which would
induce us to adopt this course will be found in the subjoined Police
Report:—
“CRUELTY To An Ox-MR. B. WARD, a salesman, of Leicestershire, appeared on
an adjourned summons before SIR. G. CARRoll and MR. ALDERMAN CHALLls, charged
with having ill-used an ox.-Police Constable TREw deposed, that about five weeks
ago, while he was on duty in Smithfield Market, he saw the defendant strike one of
the cattle in the market a tremendous blow on the head. It was what is termed
‘pething” the animal. Upon asking the defendant his name, he refused to give it
until he was taken to the station-house.—Mn. ALDERMAN Challis considered that
the police had exceeded their duty. They had no business to interfere merely
because the defendant struck one of his bullocks.-Thew said that he had seen
many, bullocks knocked down by a similar blow.— Ma. Alosawan Challis:
Admitting that he had, such a blow did no hurt to the animal.—TREw said he
always understood that such a blow was termed cruelty.—Ma. ALDERMAN CHAllis :
It does not hurt the animal.”
Now “pething” an ox, we believe, means beating him in a peculiarly
savage and brutal manner on the head with a bludgeon; which, in an
ordinary slaughterman, is accounted an act of remarkable barbarity, and
as such punishable with fine and imprisonment. In this instance,
however, it was ruled by MR. ALDERMAN CHALLIs to be a perfectly
innocent operation; first, on the ground already stated, that it did “not
hurt the animal.” It is dubious if the extreme of beef-headedness
could so far enable even an Alderman toyº. himself in an ox's place as
to justify him in such an assertion. We certainly should hesitate to
... enter on our list of friends” a gentleman apparently so much
“wanting sensibility” as ALDERMAN CHALLIs. Salesmen, however,
may be of a different opinion, for—
“The defendant here said that the police had acted very improperly towards him;
they came up and took him to the station-house.—One of the sergeants who was on
duty said that whenever they interfered with any of the salesmen they were laughed
at, and told they had only to send for Ms. ALDERMAN CHALLis, and it would be all
right.”
To which assertion of the police-sergeant, MR. ALDERMAN CHALLIS
gave the following indignant contradiction:-
“ALDERMAN Challis: You had no right to take defendant into custody.”
No right to take the defendant into custody! Why? Well, first as
atºli because he did “not hurt the animal.” Secondly, for a far
more substantial reason—solid and weighty, as an Alderman's reason
should be. Perpend it:—
“TREw said he should not have done so had not defendant refused to give his
name.—ALDERMAN CHALLis: But you could see that defendant was a respectable
person.”
The interference of the constabulary, then, according to ALDERMAN
CHALLIs, must be determined, not by the appearance of the act, but by
that of the agent. TREw “could see that the defendant was a respect-
able person.” We will not stop to inquire how. We will suppose the
defendant to have been well shaved; to have had on a decent hat—
whether with or without butchers’ mourning—a clean shirt, and a good
coat, waistcoat, and continuations, with a watch and seals, and perhaps
top-boots. We will accept these from the worshipful Alderman as the
obvious evidences of “respectability.” Still we must remind him of a
certain trifling inconvenience to be apprehended from the adoption of
his principle, which would assuredly preclude the police from any
intervention with the “Swell Mob.”
The only doubt in the mind of TREw related to the nature of the
defendant’s conduct. He frankly admitted his perception of the
individual’s “respectability.”
“TREw said he was aware of that, but as he refused to give his name, he had no
alternative.—SIR. G. CARRoll remarked that he thought the police did F. right
in taking defendant into custody when he refused to give his name.--Taew said the
instant §. had given his name he would have been allowed to go away.-
ALDERMAN CHALLIs thought such a charge did not come within the meaning of the
Act; and the case was dismissed.”
But whether the charge came within the Act or not, was, according
to our Alderman, nothing to the purpose. The defendant was evidently
a “respectable person.” When he refused to give his name, the police-
man should have been satisfied, and asked no more questions: Really
his Worship ought to compose a “Guide for the Police,” which, we are
uite sure, would eclipse all the precepts immortalised in the third
Scene of the third Act of Much ado about Nothing.”
In the meanwhile, let all butchers who would work their own sweet :
will, unmolested, on their oxen, exchange the blue smock for a respect-
able paletot—which, we would suggest, may be called the “Cruelty
Wrapper”—and cut away, regardless of the police and of any Act of
Parliament in such case made and provided.
INNOCENCE.
Victoria at Boulogne,
At the Boulogne fººte the health of “HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN OF
ENGLAND” was given, and drunk by the French with, we are told,
tremendous enthusiasm. We are glad to chronicle this º fact.
Nevertheless, we cannot take the compliment as indicative of the better
feeling of the whole of France towards Perſide Albion. Boulogne, it
must be remembered, is little other than an English watering-place on
the other side of the Channel. It has become enlarged, beautified, and
is mainly supported by English money. Hence, when the Frenchmen
toasted WICroRIA, it may be a matter of nice inquiry, whether they
drank to the English Queen or the English—sovereign.
SIGNS OF THE SEASON.
We are strikingly reminded of the presence of Autumn, and the
consequent dearth of intelligence, by the American aloes and Lilia lan-
cifolia, which are now in full bloom in the newspapers.

THE SE M P S T R Ess AT HOME,
IN THE UNION AND THE GAOL.
To Mr. Punch.
IR,--I well remember when MR. Hood sang his Song ºf the
Shirt in your pages. Ha, Sir! what a song was that! and
how it seemed to touch and tremble upon the heart-strings
of all England! We sempstresses thought that one little
song had made the selfish world ashamed of itself; that a few
lines of verse had carried compassion and Christian tender-
ness throughout the land. A lovely song, Sir, setting free,
as by a charm, thousands and tens of thousands from the
bonds of slavery: Fine ladies sang the song, as though con-
verted by it from the carelessness of plenty to think kindly, tenderly,
of the sufferings of the sempstress. People talked of the sisterhood
of woman; and the slaves of the needle and thread smiled at the
words, and, in their simplicity, thought there was really something
true and beautiful in them.
“All this, however, passed away. I once heard MR. HuckabACK
observe, ‘Songs are all very well to humbug the ignorant, but you can't
set'em, to political economy.” Now, Sir, I don't exactly know what
political economy is, but I’m told, it’s an economy that’s to teach the
poor to live upon nothing. . And this I know—a many thousands of 'em
every day learn a good deal of the lesson.
“But, Sir, my reason for addressing you is this. I am a shirt-maker,
and am desirous of getting into the Union or the Penitentiary (which.
ever you may advise as best), that I may be able to eat a little more
from my needle and thread than I am able to do in my own garret.
“You must know, Sir (and MR. RoPER, the Secretary to our Society

THE WEGETARIANS.
WE see by the papers that there is a society existing in
Manchester, that devotes its entire energies to the eating
of vegetables, and the members meet occasionally for the
purpose of masticating mashed potatoes, and munching
cabbage leaves. “Sweets to the sweet” is a popular
maxim, and “Greens to the green” may fairly be applied
to the Vegetarians. At one of their recent banquets, a
party of 232 sat down to a couple of courses, in which sage
and onions, beetroot, mushrooms, and parsley, were the
principal luxuries. Joseph BRotherton, Esq., M.P., the
gentleman who is always wanting to get the House of Čom.
mons to bed by 12 o'clock, was in the chair, and proposed
a series of toasts, which were drunk in plain water, and as
several odd fish were present, they no doubt felt themselves
quite in their element. We do not quite understand the
º: upon which these gentlemen object to animal food;
ut if health is their object, we do not think that will be
promoted by the mixture of messes they sat down to the
other day at Manchester.
In addition to their sage and onions, they disposed of
several dishes of plum-pudding—in itself as heavy as
plumbago—almonds and raisins, cheesecakes, custards,
grapes, gooseberries, sago, figs, and flummery. There, is
something very infantine in the pretended simplicity of this
fare, for none but a parcel of overgrown children would
sit down seriously to make a meal upon sweetstuff. We
look, upon the vegetarian humbug as a mere pretext for
indulging a juvenile appetite for something nice, and, we
are really ashamed of these old boys who continue, at their
time of life, to display a puerile partiality for pies and
puddings.
The Future of the Royal Academy.
THE Athenaeum publishes a report, relative to the National
Gallery, of a Select Committee of the House of Commons,
composed of LoRD John RusseII, SIR ROBERT PEEL, and
other legislators of all parties. “So that,” observes our
learned contemporary, “whatever party shall be in power,
something will be done to enlarge and new front, the
National Gallery. Where will the Royal Academy
go to ?”
ºf what have been the doings of that same
Society, we should like to know where the Royal Academy
expects to go to?
of Distressed Needlewomen will be my witness), that there’s a Union
where they take shirts from warehouses at 3}d, each, that—to keep
life and soul together in the needlewoman that makes them—ought at
least to be ls. 9d. At Millbank Penitentiary and other prisons, sailors'
jackets and soldiers' great-coats are made at the rates of 23d, and 5d.
“Now, Sir, as the pauper woman gets a farthing for herself out of
every 3}d, I am sure I should be much better off in the Union than in
my own attic. Because the Union finds board and lodging and coals;
and there is, at least, the extra farthing clear for little luxuries, such as
snuff and tea. But, Sir, with rent and food to º: for, I must starve
(I mean, Sir, I do starve) in my own garret, with never a farthing to
spare at all... Therefore, Sir, I have made up my mind not to attempt
any competition with my Parish, but to go into the Union at once, and
enjoy the independence of the farthing.
“Or, Sir, as I feel my pride pretty well starved out of me, if you
think I should do better’in the Penitentiary, I think after a few trials
with myself I would attempt to steal a roll, or a bun, or sometrifle of the
sort, to get comfortably committed. Once I should have died to think of
such a thing; but—I am sure of it—'tis nothing better than conceit in
such as me to think to work against the authorities. I can't work at
either the Union or the Prison prices, and keep myself, but am content
to take their 3}d, and 5d., with the understanding that they must keep me.
We must all come to this sooner or later, and I may as well go among
the first as the last.
“Your obedient Servant,
“SUSAN Jon Es.”
“P.S. I’ve got a linnet and a geranium, and as I hear I mustn't take
'em either to the workhouse or the gaol, they’re at your service, dear
Mr. Punch, if you will do me the kindness to accept ‘em.”

HEMIGRATION MADE HEASY.
To LoRD HASHLEY.
- “The Cabbys Hinstatute, Blue Postes.
“Lookin hover the Times at our Hinstatute on Sattaday, I sea
that 2 winming have come up Before MR HARNOLD, the Wushup
Street, Beak (whomb I ope he is quite well & know very hintimit)
uarralen quite outragus (as there is no satisfyink some of em) about
eir usbands hemmygrating without them.
“Has I thought it mite interest I prigd the hextrack out of the
paper, and send you the sam.
“‘The woman ANNE Lorinck stated that in consequence of her husband, a cab-
driver, being unable to procure employment, he determined to emigrate with herself
and child to one of the colonies, and for that purpose, with a number of others,
attended a meeting at the Irish Ragged School in the Minories, at which Lond
Asanºr and many other influential persons were present. A subscription was then
set on foot to provide a free passage to America for as many as the funds would
cover, and the whole superintendence of the undertaking was intrusted to MR.
Jackson, who placed her husband on the list of applicants. She and her husband
both remained in the fullest conviction that she and the child would be sent out
with him, until a short time before his embarcation, when to her astonishment she
was informed that the funds were insufficient, and that the child and herself must
remain behind. She subsequently sought an interview with the manager, M.R.
Jackson, and pointed out to him the hardship of their separation, but he told her
he could not assist her, and that rather than thwart her husband's prospects it would be
much better for her and the child to enter the workhouse. Her husband had now gone
: #. America in an emigrant ship called the Victoria, leaving his family entirely
estitute.
“The other woman's usband went off without so much as with your
leaf, or by your leaf.
*** He left her and the infant in the morning, promising to be home at 10 o'clock at
night, and she had never seen him since. She was i. in the deepest distress,
the infant in her arms was dangerously ill, and she had no means of procuring
support for herself or medical attendance for the child.
“‘Ma. Annold said, that it was so extraordinary a case that he should like to know
what it all meant. He felt perfectly satisfied that Load AshLEY would not have
contributed his money to an undertaking which had for its object the separation of
husbands from their wives and families, leaving the latter in the position of destitute
paupers; and as the fact of the second case coming so soon after the other rendered
it a matter of much public importance, one of the officers must go at once to the
house of the gentleman complained against, and request his attendance, with an
explanation.
***MR. Jackson stated that the object of the gentlemen present at the meeting
referred to, in entering into the voluntary subscription, was to send out a number
of reformed and repentant thieves and criminals, and that both of the brothers
Lori.Nck had represented themselves as convicted felons, and, therefore, qualified as
the objects intended by the meeting. Numbers of such characters had waited upon him,
for it was a work of months, and he felt satisfied he had accomplished a great deal
of good. With regard to the wives, he was not at all aware that the younger brother
was a married man, and although he knew that the other had a wife and child, it
was distinctly understood that the husband was himself to provide the means of
conveying her to his place of settlement.
“‘Holland, the warrant officer, repeated the statement the first woman had made,
that MR. JAckson had advised her to go with her child into the workhouse, but that
gentleman made no observation in reply. - -- º - ->
“‘Ms. JAckson.—These men came tome representing themselves to be thieves and
felons of seven, eight, or ten years' standing, and repeatedly convicted, and by so
furthering their interests I was P. them with the means of becoming res-
pectable and worthy members of society. I certainly should not have done so if
they had not positively assured me they had led such a life.
* “EMMA Lorinck declared that there was not a word of truth in it; her husband
i.º shoemaker, and, though out of work, had never committed an offence in all
s life.
“‘MR. Jackson.—I assure you, Sir, I displayed the utmost caution in the execution
of the office intrusted to me,
“‘Ma. AanoLD.—I must say I do not think so. Did you make inquiry as to the
men's former character of any one else but themselves?
“‘MR. Jackson (hesitating). —Why, no; but they were in the company of known
thieves and felons, and appeared to be conversant with the haunts and slang of
such characters, and I founded my judgment of them upon that, which seemed to
me satisfactory.”

Lisqualification for Billingsgate.
WE feel called upon to withdraw our nomination of the HoN. CRAVEN
F.BERKELEY as a fit and proper person to represent the electors of
Billingsgate. By the †† of a very handsome apology to
MR. RounDELL PALMER, the honourable gentleman has completely
disqualified himself for the representation of that constituency.
THE CROWNING EWIL.
“TAKE away that bauble!” was the first excla:
mation that occurred to us when we saw one of
the new Post Office crowns on the lamp-post in
Fleet Street, that it is our almost daily lot to
pass. With our well-known, respect for the
monarchy, we confesswe felt it difficult to restrain
ourselves from demanding the surrender of the
diadem into our own hands, in order that we
might for ever destroy such a shameful insult
to §. We should like to know who can
have been the artist that has dared to desecrate
the type of Monarchy by constructing a crown
out of a couple of tin uprights, with an iron
centre bit, and a rim of some inferior metal,
relieved here and there by
two or three ungainly-looking
stars, cut apparently from
the lid of an old saucepan.
We cannot, dare not, will
not imagine the head of our
beloved Sovereign block'd in
this block-tin, the bare con-
templation of which caused .
our indigmation to rise so high, that it only required a ladder, to
rise still higher, and “dash the bauble down”. Fortunately, for the
security of the Crown, as represented in the street regalia furnished by
the Post Office, it is “fixed on such ‘a height” that, like Richard, the
Third, we feel we must “strain” our “inmost workings” to an extent
that might jeopardise our braces, if we were to, allow ourselves to be
strung up to too high a §. of indignation by the unseemly sight. We
can very well understand the monarch who says,
“ Uneasy is the head that wears a crown,”
if it was such a crown as the one at the Fleet Street Post Office that
his most uncomfortable majesty had run his head against. SHAKSPEARE,
when he lays down the beautiful proposition that—
“Crowns got by blood must be by blood maintained,”
must have had in his eye such a crown as this, which could not be
maintained upon anybody's head without scratching it or tearing it in
the most dreadful manner.
WHAT MAY BE BOUGHT FOR FIVE POUNDS!
IF º: are a married man, you may buy these luxuries for the small
sum of £5 !–
You may, with your clenched fists, beat your wife until her eyes shall
be “dreadfully bruised and swollen.”—For £5. - -
You may “take the bellows from her hand,” and with them .#:
her several blows upon the head,” until she falls “senseless on the
floor.”—For £5. - -
You may further kick and beat her “while she is down.”-For £5.
These things—free and enlightened Englishmen, blessed with laws
that make you the envy of surrounding nations—these things you may
do, if you have £5.
“But how”—you ask—“if I have not £5 !” - -
Why, then, inhuman º: outcast—penniless mis-
creant—why, then, in defauſt of payment of £5, you shall taste the
bitterness of captivity and oakum picking for two statute months!
For an illustration of this ennobling legal truth, see Marylebone
Police Report, in the case of MICHAEL GoRE, late of 25, Orchard
Place, now on a two months’ visit to ColonBI, CHESTERTON, at the
House of Correction. - - - - -
Michael GoRE is punished—not, in very truth, for beating his wife
—but for not having £5 to pay for it. Is not this the highest triumph
of property?
Rebels' Weapons.
WE take from the Chronicle the following paragraph, dated from
Clonmel:—
“During the present harvest the wages of agricultural labourers have not, ex-
ceeded an average of threepence a day, with diet—black bread or diseased potatoes
—and in numerous instances so low as one penny per diem has been paid."
It is true there is a foolish, a wicked spirit of rebellion waking, and,
tiger-like, watching, in Ireland: there are pikes, and guns, and pistols
in the hands of knaves and fools. But, after all, are not the worst
weapons against us to be found in that fatal three-pence a day-that
filthy black bread—those loathsome potatoes? The penny per diem is
harder to contend with than the hourly bullet.

As I sit in this railway-carriage, whirling down to Brighton at an infernal
speed, borne along by a screaming engine which tears through the bowels of the
earth, and before which rocks are cleft, and valleys are filled up; as I sit in

reading it until I am anon plunged into the sudden darkness of a tunnel under.
neath a mountain, or º to lay it down, oppressed by that still more awful
obscurity through which my own thoughts have to make an issue, there is no
wonder that the lady opposite, with the novel in her lap, stares
aghast at the haggard countenance of the gentleman with
whom she travels, and at the wildness of his eyes.
“Is there anything in the paper, Sir?” she says; for we
had the honour of a trifling acquaintance.
“Anything in the paper! All the world is in the paper.
This express train travels fast, but the world travels faster.
Why, Madam, if you will but read what is written in the
Times of this very day, it is enough for a year's history, and
ten times as much meditation. If we have such a Times every
day, life wouldn't bear it. How can we follow and remember
such changes? The whole of Europe sends news, and every
state is in revolution. States—we can't call them states any
more: nothing is stable; it is overthrow after overthrow, a
succession of convulsions. It is struggle, battle, barricade,
murder, conspiracy, abortive or active everywhere.
“In Frankfort there is a barricade, and one set of patriots
firing against another. Because the majority of United
Germany is for not making war with Denmark for the present,
the friends of the minority tear up paving-stones, fire on flags
of truce, and shoot down unarmed Deputies in cold blood.
Men who were beloved patriots yesterday, are carried away to
their homes stabbed and dying. A great red flag, surrounded
by riflemen, flares out over upset omnibuses in the street,
until artillery comes down and pounds them into flight.
“In Spain, “Our Own Correspondent’ says, a vast Monte-
molinist conspiracy is organised throughout the country, and
about to burst on a given day. Meanwhile, the Government
is engaged hourly in arresting, not the Montemolinists, but
the Constitutional opposition.
“In Paris, they have just elected Louis-Napoleon; the
band of the National Guard is playing Weillons au Salut de
l'Empire, and the people shouting out Wive l’Empereur. So
who knows but that GENERAL CAvAIGNAc may be prepari
to pack up his portmanteau, and to join Louis-BLANc an
Louis-Philippe in this country P -
“Meanwhile the Red Republicans are organising with great
alacrity, and after the chief of the Provisional Government has
evacuated it, the Emperor may come in for his turn of exile.
“The Emperor being disposed of, and communism in per-
manence, the partisans of º THE FIFTH will natural
have their chance. Their party is increasing daily in strengt
. favour, and the white cockade may take the place of the
red one.
“In Petersburg, they have erected barricades too, and
attempted a little murder; but this is as yet confined to the
persons of a few physicians, who are accused of desiring to
}. the people; and the revolters knelt, down when the
mperor alone mounted the barricades, and told them that
those defences could not keep out the Cholera. But who shall
say, a practice of barricading having once been tried in a
country, when that sort of experiment shall cease?
“All the towns of Sicily are barricaded, against the Nea-
politan enemy, except Messina, and that is blown up.
“In our own dear United Kingdom of Ireland and Great
Britain, they are trying, SMITH O'BRIEN and his associate
leaders of the Ballingary fight in Tipperary, while other patriots
are still robbing, and in arms in Waterford and Cork. The
younger Mitchel, is represented as carrying out the precepts
of his enthusiastic brother in exile, and engages with others
in the pursuit of freedom, and in cutting down the crops., , .
“At Dublin, other advocates of liberty are tried for stabbing
a policeman on his beat. And O'Connell, not having done
anything in particular, yet longs to be tried too, and calls upon
the Lord Lieutenant straightway to put him in the dock.
“In the Central Criminal Court, close by our own New-
gate and Ludgate Hill, MR. WILLIAM Dowling, a very mild
and inoffensive young artist, is being tried with a number of
his friends, martyrs to their political opinions. Their project,
as announced by a witness (a traitor to their sainted cause, as
it must be confessed), was a gallant one. It was concisely
announced by, the patriotic Mullins. ‘Mind, gentlemen,
he said, “our object is, if possible, to destroy the power of the
Queen, and establish, a Republic.” There was a general
acquiescence in this, by every one. Some ‘conversation”
having then ensued, ‘about vitriol and assassinating the
police, an honest fellow, by the name of Rose, remarked-
"We must first assassinate the police, pull down the station-
houses, and build barricades.”
“So that, though we have had no barricades, nor much
murder, for our parts, in London, yet we might have had
them but for an untimely interference of the tyrants in
power. Our city containei many Clubs, who had numbered
off their ‘fighting-men.” Besides the surveyors in the Crow’s-
nest of Saint Paul’s, Liberty had appointed her men of

science, who had mapped out the metropolis for barricades, where
they would put their red flags up. Ginger-beer bottles were filled with
wder and combustibles, accord-
ing to the Irish receipt, to pop off
at a moment's warning. The great
CUFFEY himself approved of them,
the informer says, and the teach-
ing of the exile of Bermuda was to

Ireland (Heaven bless her ') had
the honour of the day. Indeed,
there was a little jealousy about
there not being a sufficient number
of Irishmen in the Ulterior Com-
mittee, and so four Irishmen'were
placed on it; and, that their in-
fluence was considerable, is shown
by the fact that many of our Clubs
took the names of the gallant
children of Erin. There was the
MITCHEL Club, the DAVIs Club,
the EMMETT Club, as well as the
Tom PAINE Brigade, and all these
were prepared to act; when, on
the 11th of August, the police
seized Rose’spapers, and it was all

“Yes, it was all up with them;
but it might have been allup with
us, but for the Government, and
its myrmidons. Those gallant
Clubs, those true-hearted patriots,
those dear, good, kind Irishmen,
whom, as we know them better,
we should learn to love and bless
more and more, would have pep-
pered us with fire-balls, burnt our
shops, and houses about our ears,
butchered our police, and set up a republican form of government.
All this is in the paper, Ma'am,” I said. .
“And anything more?” asked the opposite. - -
“Yes, indeed, one thing more; there is the history of a noble-
man cut off in the vigour of his life, powers, and fame—of one who
had a great name yesterday, and was the chivalrous leader of a great

REPUBLICAN MAGNANIMITY,
A FINE instance of magnanimity has recently been given by the
French Republican Government. From the statue of JoAN or ARC in
the palace of Versailles the name of the sculptor has been erased,
because the artist happened to be MARIE, a princess of the fallenhouse
of Orleans. We had flattered ourselves that there was alreadya republic
of art as well as of letters, and that the late PRINCEss MARIE, as a
member of the former republic, would have had her genius recognised
and her memory respected by the present fraternal rulers of her country.
If no other restoration should take place in France, we do at least
hope to see the restoration of the name of the royal artist to her work,
as well as a restoration of their º beauty to the public places in

OH, Yes! OH, Yes! This is, to

seen since. It is supposed he has
gone to meet the Comet, or that the
bond is busy star-gazing. In
either case any astronomer who meets
him in his walks is requested to keep
his eye upon him, as the said Planet

ROYAL CARRIAGES AND CATTLE.
THE Edinburgh. Witness, in reference to the QUEEN’s visit to Scotland,
says:-
“The Royal horses and carriages selected fortheuse of HER MAJESTY and PRINCE
ALBERT, on their visit to Balmoral, arrived in the harbour of Aberdeen on Monday
afternoon.”
Royal horses! We have heard of Royal tigers often, but never, till
now, of a royal horse. There must also be a royal road leading some-
where, because it is said that there is none to Mathematics; but we
can hardly fancy a iage invested with the attribute of royalty. We
should be seriously puzzled how to address a royal horse. Ought we
to say, Wol your chesnut Majesty,” or, May it please your. Royal
Nagship togee up? We should wish to observe proper etiquette
in talking to royal blood horses.
Cui Bono?
EveRypopy is asking what on earth took LoRD,John Russell to
Ireland? for, beyond a visit to the Castle and a few other complimentary
calls, he might as well have been out of Erin, for he does not seem to have
lent an ear to anything that the Irish people º have had to say to
him. He, however, had much communication with the Lord Lieutenant;
and the probability is, that the Premier, who is extremely fond of Con-
stitutional inquiry, went to Ireland for the purpose of studying
CLARENDon's History of the Rebellion.
The NATIONAL ExCRESCENCE.
THERE is a person who keeps etermally advertising an “EFFICACIous

We wonder if this man could enable us to cure that troublesome ex-
crescence, Ireland, without cutting it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HERO OF A HUNDRE
D STATUES.
%3 \
ANOTHER statue of the Duke of WELLINGTON is to be put up in the Tower, and in fact,
London is becoming a sort of livery stable, where the Hero of Waterloo and his horse are
being constantly put up. The Duke's head will soon be as familiar an object in the metropolis
as the top of the monument or the dome of St. Paul's. The plume of his helmet has already
begun to take its place among the established London weathercocks; and, as to his nose,
there is scarcely a bridge on this side of Westminister that is half so conspicuous...There
is hardly a street, where the Duke of WELLINGTON may not be seen looking, in at the top
windows, or inhaling the smoke from the chimneys, or º to take a gentle trot over the
tiles. As to poor NELson, the Duke of York, and the two or three others scattered about
town, they are completely lost in the crowd of DUKEs of WELLINGTON, who are beginning
almost to jostle ...; other at every turn. - -
If we want a new site for a statue, we shall soon begin to find that “the DUKE OF WEL-
LINGTON's horse stops the way.” for it must be remembered that the steed generally shares
with his master in this great game of thoroughfare cibbage, and that if the former needs one
yard for his head, the other requires at least two for his heels.
THE SHERIFFS LIVERIES.–(IMPORTANT)
We stop the press to announce that last week London was thrown into a state of delirious
excitement by the exhibition of the new Sheriffs' (FINNIS AND GoodHART's) new liveries,
destined for November the 9th. Could GoG and MAGog condescend to plush—could they
so far forget the moyen age—as to creep into the coat and waistcoat of degenerate 1848, we
think they would choose the cut of DoudNEY and of CLIFFord, as shown in their respective
windows. The. Morning Chronicle revels in each suit; “JEAMEs” himself was never more
ecstatic in a livery, which our gifted contemporary calls “a brilliant specimen of civic
splendour!”: Perhaps the gorgeousness of London is more largely d veloped in the livery
of FINNIs, though there is an unspeakable mixtureof taste and grandeur blushing unseen in
the plush of GooDHART. . As the reader has already concluded, all the footmen remaining in
London visited the private view at DoudNEY and at CLIFFord's; and, as is usual on similar
critical occasions, partook of a champagne breakfast, doubtless the better to cultivate the purity
of their opinions.
The coats are of spring green, embroidered up and down with chains and fetters, illustrative
of the sterner duties of the shrievalty. The waistcoats and breeches are of kerseymere
and plush; the waistcoats worked all over in golden letters with fi ſa, and the breeches'
pockets with nulla bona. Among the crowd of distinguished footmen there was just a
sprinkling of sheriffs' officers, and they, viewing the embroidery, declared the execution perfect.
-
COINING LIKE BLAZES.
* THE Two-Shilling Piece has made its appearance. They say it is very pretty. There is
every chance, then, of its being snatched out of our fingers as soon as it is in our hands.
The crown-piece was never circulated because it was found too beautiful. The Mint was afraid
that people would wear them round their necks as ornaments, and that women would
hide them in their stockings, as being much too pretty to spend. However, people do say
that the Moneyer's Company set their faces against them, and that the amalgamation of silver
and brass was found not to mix at all. It seems that these gentlemen do all the coins by
contract; that is to say, they clip a ſourpenny-piece as much as they can, in order to get the
greatest possible profit out of it. Their motto is “Never say die,” unless they pocket a
very.handsome percentage out of every one they strike. This is the reason why the five-
shilling pieces went up like sky-rocket pieces, creating a great blaze for the moment they were
up; but when the public looked for them they
found nothing but the sticks that issued them.
[n, the same manner, we suspect, will the two-
shilling pieces shoot up, shine, and disappear.
“AN EXCUSE FOR THE GLASS.”
OUR *::: ive contemporary, the Builder, who
|hº laid the foundation, occasionally, of some
|of our jokes, gave forth a suggestion not long
|ago, that glass doors might be adapted to houses

with considerable effect. We have heard of
people living in glass houses, and it has been said
they are the last persons who ought to throw
stones; but as our population has not arrived at
that pitch, we think the objection would not
apply, at all events to the experiment of begin-
ning, as it were, with glass doors. There are
numerous advantages to be derived from such an
arrangement; and, in the first º: it would
be highly desirable that a dunorabailiff knocking
at the door, under the false pretence of a visitor
should at once be seen through—which he would
be if the door were of glass; and by being kept
out, he would at all events be debarred from
the right of saying - -
that his debtor had
let him in.
The usual excuse
of “not at home”
might, in some in-
stances, become ra-
ther transparent, if a
glimpse of the denied
individual should be
caught; but an inner
door of some opaque
material would pro-
vide against this disa-
greeable contingency.
In the matter of
wine, the glass would
frequently save the
bottle; for if a dining- .
room door were made =
of glass, no wine-bib-
bing butler could, without detection, drain the
last drop of the generous liquor, of whose gene-
rosity he takes an undue advantage, when he
consumes its entire substance by a single draught.

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE SECOND.
FURTHER PROGRESS OF THE LIBERTIES OF THE ENGLISH NATION.
A FEW WORDS ABOUT KING John AND MAGNA chARTA.
hi rasanora piano" is an Italian proverb,
which, when education has so many
irons in the fire-Italian-irons of course
included—we need not translate; but
it is a proverb exceedingly applicable to
the progress of our Constitution, which
perhaps derived its quality of forte from
the very piano character of its gradual
development.
our fanciful French neighbours, and
ye an allegorical representation of
iberty, we should typify her under the
- form of a slow coach, which, in the
absence of any determined patriot to put his shoulder to the common
weal, would frequently remain for years in exactly, the same position.
The great political vehicle achieved something in the way of progress
under HENRY THE FIRST, who had robbed his elder brother RöB of the
British crown, or rather had bought him out of the concern with an
annuity of which the instalments were not long kept up with due punc-
tuality. When the instalments got into arrear, Robert expressed a
wish to be paid off, and he was paid off by imprisonment in the Castle
of Cardiff. until his death—an early in-
stance of fratermity, resembling in, qualit
the specimens of the same article, wit
which the French Republic has recently
favoured us.. -
HENRY ...; thoroughly aware that his
conduct towards his own family would not
entitle him to respect, adopted the course
usually followed by men who behave ill at
home, and courted out-door popularity.
Though he had cheated and ill-treated his
brother, he started as a philanthropist upon
a large scale, and like many others in a
humbler sphere—the would-be heroes of
Trafalgar, for example, who met with such
asevere cross in that noted Square—whose
private actions are heartless, oppressive,
and fraudulent, he was seized with a won-
derful amount of tenderness towards his speciesingeneral. He became
a wholesale dealer in the milk of human kindness, taking good care,
like others in the same line, to keep all the cream to himself; and he
relaxed the rigour of the laws because he knew that if too much
strictness prevailed, his right to the crown might undergo some
awkward questioning. -
Pretending to be the friend of enlightenment, he abolished the
curfew, that extraordinary arrangement which enforced the putting out
ofali the candles in the kingdom just as it was getting dark, which was,
of course, the only time when they would be wanted. The curfew
was one of those institutions which, assuming to take a parental view
of the people, decreed, that, sunset was the proper time for all good
children to go to bed; but the arrangement was of course prejudicial to
the few lights of the age, and particularly to the development of that
wonderful, composition-candle which has grown, as it were, upon the
fat of the land, and to whose wick—if we º be allowed the allegory-
we all of us so cheerfully cotton—the light of Liberty. The curfew, by
putting an extinguisher—after a certain hour—upon every light in the
realm, from the “mould of fashion” to the dip of no particular form,
was felt as a º on all classes, and particularly upon those who,
before the latch-key. *opened the door to midnight revelry, were not
permitted to keep sitting up for them even the rushlight, that beautiful
#. of domestic patience, shining appropriately, like modest merit, in
the shade. It has been beautifully said º SPELMAN, that the light of
science received material aid from the abolition of the curfew; for, as the
candles were permitted to burn all night, it was º that some
one in every family should be up to snuff, and hence knowledge began
to spread among the whole people..
nder HENRY THE SEcond, Liberty, which had previously been
making a series of, imperfect hops, began to take large strides, and
Trial by Jury—emblemed by twelve men in a box—began to start up
again, after a long repose; for it is a curious fact that these twelve
men in a box have appeared and disappeared, upon the principle of the
Jack-in-the-box, at frequent intervals in our Constitutional history.

It was his successor John, however, who gave himself all the
exaggerated airs of a royal Jack-in-office, and, treating the prerogative
as if it had been made of caoutchouc,
stretched it to such a degree, that it must
have cracked if he had not let go his hold,
and allowed it to shrink into such little-
ness as it never need have known had he
been expertin handling it. The humiliated
sovereign having roused the discontent of
the whole country, found himself without
resources, and was at last glad to put his
name to abill which the Barons had drawn
and offered for his acceptance at Runny-
Fimede. Englandstill lives upon theinterest
attached to that glorious bill, which takes
the name of Magna Charta to distinguish
it from other promissory notes of Royalty
which have been, in early days, shamefully
dishonoured; but this valuable security
- has been endorsed from reign to reign,
and every succeeding sovereign has never failed to put a fresh name
upon the back of it.
We suspect that, as far as the great majority of our countrymen are
concerned, Charta is little more than a great constitutional
Mrs. Harris; for, although everybody talks, about, very few have read
or seen this marvellous Fº for our rights and liberties. We regret
to be obliged to strip of much of the gilt that adorns this magnificent
lump of historical and truly wholesome gingerbread, by announcing the
fact that its chief provision was the e º: of weights and measures;
so that, if it raised the social scale, it had an opposite effect upon scales
in general. It secured to the villain his implements of tillage, or
rather, it looked upon the owners of spades as trumps playing the game
of life with their hands, and deserving of every encouragement. na
Charta declared also that no freeman should be imprisoned; but some-
how or other mistakes often happened afterwards, by the inearceration
of a liber homo–the lawyers doubtless holding that “upon being im-
prisoned he was no longer free, and that, consequently, upon his coming
within the jail, he no longer came within the statute” . -
This venerabl *. e of drawing nice distinctions without differ-
ences has descended to us from our very earliest lawyers; and there is
º
º º º §
º:
no doubt that the modern judge was backed by an ancient precedent
when he declared, in the celebrated Duck case—which has since become
a leading case, from duco, to lead—that “a dead duck by inducſkºtion
is no duck at all,” and acquitted the thief who stole the living duck,
because the dead duck, when laid on the floor of the court, did not seem
properly laid in the indictment, and had not a legitolstand uponjas
against the prisoner.
tº- º,
The Charter provided also that justice should never be sold-a pro-
vision that would seem at first sight to annihilate all lawyers' bills; but
when we recollect the enormous difference between justice and law, we
see at once that the prohibition against the sale of the one could not in
any way affect the practice of charging most extravagantly for the other.
Notwithstanding all its i...". Charta was valuable as a
collection of rare old clap-traps; and it was at least satisfactory to the
people to be told that certain º: and privileges belonged to them,
though, how the prize was to be got at, might not have been very
obvious. In the frame-work of our Constitution, Magna Charta figures
rather more for ornament than use, since, notwithstanding its arrange-
ments for equalising weights and measures, every housekeeper knows
that Magna Charta does not prevent him from getting an ounce, occa-
sionally, short in a pound of tea; and, as long as old TIME's hour-glass

but lest some melancholy ignoramus may require enlightenment, and instinctively
drop down among the notes, we tell him that our own saying, “slow and sure,”

THE SERPENTINE REPORT OF COMMISSIONERS.
WE have been favoured with a sight of a Report about to be for-
warded to the Woods and Forests by the gentlemen *. in sur-
veying this elegant sheet of water. It embraces several heads; and,
we need not say, strongly condemns any interference with its present
condition.
With regard to the greenness of the water, of which so much has
been said, they find it due to a beautiful little plant exquisitely organ-
ised, under the i. and which MR. HassaLL calls the Stick-to-
skin vericlos.. This plant has been sent to DR. Lyon PLAYFAIR, who
finds that it is composed of the same elements as cabbages, and green
peas; and the reporters suggest, that instead of destroying this valuable
matter, that a highly economical use might be made of it in the making
of green soup for charitable Institutions. The reporters also found that
the green colour of the skin produced by this plant, after bathing,
might be easily removed by gently sponging the body with a diluted
solution of muriatic acid.
The next point examined by the reporters was the deep holes alleged
to exist in this piece of water. They found these holes to vary in
depth from twenty to forty, feet, in addition to several feet of black
massive mud; but, in consideration of the number of persons employed
by the Royal Humane Society in rescuing persons from drowning in
these holes, and the moral benefit of persons subscribing to such a |f
Society, they do not recommend that these holes be filled up, or that
any alteration be made in the present dangerous character of the whole
bottom of the Serpentine.
The reporters had observed several lizards in a very lively state, as
well as innumerable animalculae, which could not have existed if the
waters of this place were so unfavourable to animal life as was ordinarily
supposed.
...As another reason for continuing the Serpentine in, its present con-
dition, the reporters had found that the number of bathers had been
reduced from three thousand daily, to five hundred; and they feel
assured that anything which could thus deter so large a number of
reckless youths from playing with so dangerous a temptation as deep
water, could not be wished to be removed by an enlightened and
civilised community.
With such powerful reasons for keeping things as they are, we feel
that our Serpentine Reformers will not have another word to say.
QUERY-Are not the French going fast enough to the Devil without
calling a Cab-eh? (CABET')
THE DUKE OF RUTLAND ON TOWN AND
COUNTRY LIFE.
AGRICULTURE draws forth the natural man.
He cannot, let him be sophisticated as he
may, forget the original ADAM. The sweet
smell of the country awakens his old love
—lulled to sleep, it may be, by the whirl
of London carriage wheels—for his mother
earth. All objects that remind him of
º of seed-time, and harvest-time,
draw forth his purer tastes; and man is
never so truthful as at an Agricultural
Meeting. Therefore was it with peculiar
delight that we read the speech of the
- - Duke of RUTLAND at the recent Waltham
gathering. His Grace spoke to farmers; and—
“He assured them that he had always felt, and that he always should feel, a
superior pleasure in finding himself in the village street rather than in the crowded
ways of the great city, in associating with the homest yeomanry of England rather
than with that society which he should have to mix with in the metropolis, and in
visiting the interior of the humble cottage of the honest and independent labourer than
in visiting the splendid mansions of the great.” [Loud cheers.]
His Grace has mixed alike in village life and in London life—he has |
alike visited the mansions of the great, and the thatched cottages of
hedgers and ditchers—and he acknowledges purer happiness in the
village street than in May Fair, and has tasted sweeter repose on the
three-legged stool of DAME Duckweed than on the velvet ottomans of
the DUCHEss of DIAMonds. We have before heard the same sort of
preference avouched at the Coburg Theatre, and the gallery-like the
Waltham farmers—exploded in loud cheers: nevertheless, we attributed
the sentiment to the harmless spirit of º to the excusable
desire, on the part of the bard, to obtain a burst of applause at any
cost. We beg his pardon: he was right. We beg pardon of the
galleries: they were right. We erred in our cynicism and our igno-
rance; and therefore beg additional pardon of the DUKE of RUTLAND
and the Waltham farmers.
How are the medals reversed—how are the tables turned—by the
confession of his Grace! He has tested city and village, lowly cottage
and splendid mansion, and is happiest when with the humblest! It is
clear, then, that the honest yeomanry, the lowly cottager, are the
º e to be really envied, and the Peers the unhappy individuals, to
e much commiserated. The burthen of life is in the coronet;, the
weight, dragging the wearer to the earth, in the ermine, and velvet.
Happy, thrice º the gaitered leg, bound and cramped by no gold-
and-purple-garter; light the rustic breast that carries not an Order!
“Ye clodhoppers of England,
That quaff the nut-brown beer,
How little do you think upon
The sorrows of the Peer!”
At length, however, the honest souls of Waltham must be awakened
to the sufferings of the Duke, when distant from the village street, and
seated under the fretted ceilings of the great. At such hours, the
yeoman and labourer must feel their superiority to his Grace—must
acknowledge their better cast in life—seeing how very much he prefers
its lowliness to his own gilded condition!
We marvel, however, that men, oppressed by the burden of wealth
and state, and finding their best enjoyment in a village street, and on a
cottage stool, do not resolutely make up their minds to put their sin:
cerity beyond question. History gives us several instances of royal
abdication; but we do not remember any case in which even an Earl-
much less a Duke—bade farewell to his state, and became a humble
cottager. Wery probably the original example is reserved for the DUKE
of RUTLAND. After what he has said, he will by no means take us by
surprise, should he set aside his robes and coronet, undo the garter
rom his leg, pack up his Orders in silver paper, and appear, for the rest
of his days, like CoMUs, “some harmless villager.” And whereas the
cell of Charles THE FIFTH became a place o F. : so in due
course of years the “humble cottage” of labourer RUTLAND may
become a shrine, whereat the pomps and vanities of the world may
swallow wholesome medicine.
As MADAME Tussaud will never die, posterity may * to see, duly
advertised—“The Duke of RUTLAND as an honest and independent
labourer, seated on his original three-legged stool, when finally retired
from the mansions of the great.”
In conclusion, we beg to assure his Grace that it has given us great
pleasure to chronicle his sentiments upon the superiority of village
streets to metropolitan, highways, a." honest {...} to “that
society” that is ignorantly understood to be the politest and the best.
A Set of GRINDERs.-Oxford Street has been blockaded now for
upwards of a month. Our Paving Commissioners evidently think that
the London thoroughfares should be treated like teeth—when a little
decayed, they ought to be carefully stopped.

LIBERTY'S VISION OF LOUIS NAPOLEON'S ENTRY
DEEP in her cell sick Liberty heard a hurry and a hum,
And she liſted up her aching head, and wondered who might come:
“Though little matters it to me,” quoth she, as she turned round,
And felt, amazed, her lips were gagged, and hard her wrists were bound.
Then wearily her fettered hands she press'd across her brow:
“Have I been drunk, or dreaming? Am I mad or sober now P
What memory is this I have of struggle, shot, and shout,
Of King Mob sea-like sweeping in, and KING Louis slinking out?
Could that be me, red flag in hand, astride a barricade?
Wast’t my voice, that club-clamour, that made the world afraid?
Is this I, in a strait waistcoat, to a prison-pallet shrunk—

I º some good souls caged me here to keep me out of harm—
Well—if ever I—” but here again broke in that strange alarm;
And Liberty, to listen at the grate her ear inclined,
And the far-off whisper of a name came to her on the wind.
What was there in that name that made her, all her chain's length, start?
What was there in that name that drove the blood back on her heart?
That struck her, faint and shivering, with clasped hand and failing knee—
“Oh, not like him—oh, not like him may his Nephew prove to bel
Still I feel his scourge upon my back, his brand upon my brow;
Thro' Russia's snows or Egypt’s sands I do his will e'en now.
Once more before his slavish work I seem to hold a blind,
Again light up false beacons for that wrecker of mankind.
I have had grinding masters, but none that ground like him;
| Tyrants have baited me for sport, and whipped me for a whim-
Fools have held dominion oer me—of slaves I’ve been the slave-
And lightly went I to the block, and as lightly left my grave.
But could Death have pass'd upon me for ever and a day
Ne'er had I risen from the tomb where he my bones did la 2.
INTO PARIS.
Piling a-top, from spoil of war, a towering trophied mass,
Which, like his power, was based in clay, altho' its head was brass.”
So speaking, Lady Liberty had dragged her to the grate,
And there she saw the Nephew ride by in solemn state;
The crowd to gaze upon him, no martial music drew,
Unless 'twere the small trumpet that for himself he blew.
He comes!—“The same! ” cries Liberty—“The very same—'tis flat—
Eagle ! jack-boots!! well-known grey coat!!! and better known
cocked hat! !!!
Alas! alas! But, as the form more marrowly I scan–
Hat, coat, and boots—I see them all—but where, then, is THE MAN ?”
Showering its tinsel crosses, the phantom moves along,
While to the shadow of a shade low lout the applauding throng;
With hiss and bray, in Freedom's name those chariot-wheels they grace,
Where Freedom, erst a captive, walked with bowed and burning face.
Poor Liberty, lugged from her cell, must stand without demur,
To see, borne by, a hideous Guy, which men adore for her,
Crowned with her cap, and carried (scarce the ; her groan can smother)
By a littérateur at one end, and a soldier at the other.
And still as moves the cavalcade, the Future looketh down
With scorn on him that gripeth still at a ghostly iron crown,
And the brass bands that blow in front, and the brazen bands that follow,
All play one tune, whose burden still is “Hollow, hollow, hollow.”
Yes: as the shrewd º; eagle, that, when he should have flown
To the columns, in the Prince's cause, sought the tripe-shop in his own,
To that fierce bird whose talons grasp'd the thunderbolt of war,
That swoop'd from northern snow-steppe to African Sahar;
As the return from Elba to Boulogne's unlucky “do,”
As the sawdust strife of ASTLEy's to the real Waterloo
So is the BUoNAPARTE of word to the BUoNAPARTE of deed—
He that rides there, to him that sleeps within the Invalides!
KIDNAPPING IN LEICESTER SQUARE.
THE days of the old Venetian
Doges are nothing to these days of
new dodges, in which a man may be
suddenly pounced upon and carried
off against his will, not perhaps to
a dungeon, but to some gloomy apart-
ment in a Leicester Square hotel.
It is true he is not liable to be laid
hold of by the Sbirri, who once used
to excite such terror, nor by the
familiars of the Inquisition, but he
may be clutched by those horrible
familiars in the form of waiters, who
tout à tout pric for the rival hotels
in the neighbourhood of Leicester
Square, of which they are the repre- -
sentatives. The ". of a cab-wheel is the signal for a descent
upon the unwary traveller; and no sooner do the landlords of the
|*
two opposition houses catch the distant rumbling of a vehicle than
they summon their myrmidons as MACHEATH would have assembled
his band, singing—
“Hark! I hear the sound of coaches,
Now the hour of attack approaches;
To your posts, brave boys, be bol
Let the cabinen beat their horses,
To the ‘fare’ direct your forces,
On them you must lay your hold.”
... The neighbourhood of Leicester Square is becoming a sort of miniature
Terracina, infested with rival Fra Diavoli, who affect a degree of
courtesy in the treatment of their captives, and politely demand the
ransom-money that is exacted, in the form of a regular hotel bill.
Every attention is shown to the kidnapped travellers; a Bill of Fare
is set before them, and choice wines are presented; but all this does
not compensate for the terrific struggle in which they are involved
when the booty they are expected to furnish is the object of a scramble
between the rival competitors for the spoil.
... We have heard of some heart-rending incidents that have occurred,
in the separation not only of travellers from their carpet-bags, but of
wives from their husbands, ladies from their dressing-cases, children
from their parents, razors from their strops; and we have known one
dreadful instance of a gentleman who was carried to one hotel while
his clean shirt-front, his only luggage and the only friend of his bosom,
was lying as a neglected parcel in the hall of the rival establishment.
But perhaps the most lamentable case of all, is that of a distracted
father with nine children, who being attacked by the rival touters, was
compelled to effect the horrible compromise of handing over four of his
helpless innocents to one of his assailants, and surrendering himself
into the hands of the other, with his five remaining little ones. -
Nothing more affecting than this has happened since the appalling
—but fortunately apocryphal—affair of the travellers in the Pyrenees,
who, followed by a flock of wolves, threw out, one by one, their babes,
to assuage the ravenous appetites of their pursuers. The wolves in the
ravine of Leicester Place are not so easily satisfied, but must have an
entire family to glut upon, and every traveller becomes a bone of con-
tention, under the snappings and snarlings of the voracious tribe.
Would that the beadle were a WAN AMBURGH, to act as a brute-tamer
in this fearful locality for, while it is infested by that most formidable
of animals ferae natura, a touter, there can be no sense of security for
the voyager, who should avoid as he would a jungle, or a loup hole, the
precincts of Leicester Square.

A BAD JOB FOR BADEN.
He readers of the advertisements
—which are really the most inte-
resting department of the news-
papers just now—must have been
struck by the occasional appear-
ance of an announcement from
- Baden-Baden, as to the continued
tranquillity and undisturbed
gaiety of that most diminutive of
Duchies. Travellers had been
§ informed that the hotel charges
were as moderate, the . Grand
Duke as accessible, and his brass
band as well conducted, as usual;
and that “bed and breakfast,”
including a presentation at Court, with “no fees to servants,” either at
the inn or at the *:::: might be had at the customary reasonable
figure. The Grand Duke himself was clearly at the bottom of these
little commercial puffs for the Duchy, as he naturally might be, for his
revenue depends a great deal upon strangers. -
We are not sure that a suite of apartments taken for, six months
certain would not purchase a Marquisate, at least, for the fortunate
visitor, and six days' board and lodging paid for in advance, insure, a
Knightship of the Golden Kangaroo, or some other Order, at the
disposition of the Grand Dukedom. The very last advertisement,
issued only a few days ago, contained the following very enticing
paragraph:-
“Our delightful valley, which has not been agitated by the least political disturbance,
affords its numerous visitors the most secure and attractive retreat. Concerts and
fêtes succeed each other . . . . The magnificent conversation salooms have never
been frequented by more brilliant and sociable assemblies. Of the many families
of the highest rank residing amongst us, we may mention their Royal High-
nesses,” &c., &c.
Here comes a long list of Royalties, including some half-dozen
families of the tremendous house of Furstenberg, and a catalogue of
Serenes, whose serenity did not appear to be threatened by any con-
sions—such convulsions as Revolutions in their infancy experience
when beginning to show their teeth; and it was added that numbers
had resolved to spend the winter in this Elysium of fourteen acres by
six, which we believe is the extent of the Duchy. - -
nfortunately, when people are just beginning to think about their
passports for Baden, under the impression that,
“Oh, if there's peace to be found in the world,
The Tourist that's anxious may meet with it there,”
they are startled by the frightful intelligence, in a third edition of the
Times, headed
* REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT IN BADEN.”
The “peaceful valley” is in a regular revolutionary storm. The
“magnificent conversation saloons” are cleared by a sauce qui peut; the
bank of the rouge et noir table is in the hands of the Provisional Govern-
ment, intent on providing for itself in the first instance; and “the public
chest,” with its entire contents of small change, and the whole of the
money taken at the café on the preceding evening, is in the hands of
the insurgents. Those who were in the act of taking ices, chocolate,
or anything else of the kind, received formal notice that they were to
hand over the cups, the glasses, the spoons—when done, with—and the
price of the refreshment, to the red and always ready Republicans.
MR. STRUVE was the leader of this uncomfortable affair, and, breaking
in upon the soriče at Baden, proved himself a very nice young man for
a small party of Radicals. It was in vain that a counter-movement was
attempted at the counter, and an effort made to save the wine-cellars;
for the insurgents blockaded all the ports—six dozen—in the name of the
#. at the same time threatening the keepers of the Restaurant
if they attempted a restauration.
DESCENT OF AN EAGLE,
LAST week, during the sitting of the National Assembly of France,
an eagle perched upon one of the benches. For a short time there was
considerable excitement, in the Chamber, all eyes being directed
towards the imperial bird—the legendary thunder-bearer. After a
time, it was satisfactorily discovered that the bird was perfectly harm-
less: there was not an inch of thunderbolt between its claws, and it
behaved itself in the tamest manner possible. No cockatoo fed on
sugar and toast could have done better. It had been predicted that
the eagle-for its descent was by no means unexpected—would show
very carnivorous propensities. But there is now every belief that the
royal bird has made up its mind to forget all sorts of regality, and to
live on bloodless corn, like the most peaceable poultry of the Republic.
THE PILGRIM OF CHANGE.
AIR-" The Pilgrim of Love.”
Now Europe is all in a state of commotion,
One turbulent scene of insensate revolt,
Unruly as Bedlam, St. Luke's, or the ocean,
And Princes abscond and their Ministers bolt. .
Like scared birds of passage, on double-quick pinions
What numbers of foreigners, .# and strange,
Flock o'er to HER MAJESTY's peaceful dominions!—
No host but JoHN BULL for the Pilgrim of Change |
KING Louis-PHILIPPE here at Claremont is lurking,
And GUIzot in some place is lying perdu;
And hither we’ve had MASTER Louis BLANc shirking—
Perhaps we shall soon have CAvAIGNAc here too.
Amongst us old METTERNICH also’s in hiding,
In somebody's castle, or mansion, or grange:
All exiles of rank are in England abiding—
No host but JoHN BULL for the Pilgrim of Changel
It is likely enough that the Monarch of Prussia
Our guest will become before Time has sped far,
And should Revolution extend into Russia,
We may see you here some day, likewise, MR. CzAR.
To-morrow the steadiest throne may reel over,
The firmest of dynasties chance may derange;
Each sovereign will find, when he's forced to turn rover,
No host like JoHN BULL for the Pilgrim of Change |
CHARLEs ALBERT is King of Sardinia at present,
And QUEEN ISABELLA is ruler of Spain;
But who can assure them that something unpleasant
May not suddenly shorten of either the reign?
A rival may triumph—the people's affection
This, that, or the other offence may estrange;
There’ll be, if their lieges should cut their connexion,
No host but join Buifor the Pilgrim of Change:
Just now things are in such a terrible tangle,
That it would by no means surprise us to see
Both MARSHAL RADetzsky and GENERAL WRANGEL
Take refuge in this little Isle of the Free—
To hear, for no matter what Prince or Commander,
That Mºnt apartments was bid to arrange;
For hither such exiles are certain to wander-
No host but John BULL for the Pilgrim of Change'
E’en Pius THE NINTH, if the tempest should shake him,
Could hardly obtain an asylum elsewhere;
To England he too would be forced to betake him,
Establishing here his pontifical chair.
With the Pope we could form diplomatic relations,
To Rome without having the trouble to range;
HIs HoliNESs crying, “Oh nation of nations !—
No host but join Bui for the Pilgrim of Changel”
THE MARCH OF MORALITY.
THE following appears in the midst of a linendraper's advertisement:
“SEveRAL Assistants WANTED.—None need º but men of high moral
attainments, good abilities, courteous demeanour, determined energies, and strict
integrity of character.”
We were not aware that “high moral attainments” were required
to get of “fifty, thousand straw bonnets;” assist at “alarming
sacrifices;” officiate at “tremendous failures;” help to “give things
away;” and perform the last sad duties of “clearing off one hundred
per cent. under cost price,” by way of climax to "another awful bank:
ruptcy.” We can comprehend the necessity for “determined energies”
in a linendraper's assistant, for his duty seems to consist in encumber-
ing people with what they do not want; preventing them from º;
what they do; and tempting them to the purchase of dozens or half-
dozens of an article of which only one is required... We have often been
victimised by the determined energies of an individual who has emptied
our pockets of cash, in exchange for bits of ribbon, pieces of sheeting,
or rolls of jaconot, merely because they happened to be “remnants”
that we might have for a series of mere nothings, amounting in the
aggregate to something rather inconvenient. The “high moral attain-
ments” needed for this sort of thing, remain to us a mystery.
THE WORSEST OF THE WORSERS.
AMONG the names of magistrates lately dismissed in Ireland for
joining in the Repeal Movement, we find that of MR. DENNIs SHINE
}; We presume this gentleman will, be obliged to drop at least
one of his appellations, for by his dismissal the SHINE is completely
taken out of him.

Must Be MoRE FUNNY, if you please. MR. Snir, the Tailor, HAs called
Again That MoRNING: you have A splitting headache, FRoºt A TRANsaction

I suppose she Found the BILL in your coat-rocket. How changed ANNA-
| MARIA is From what she was when You MARRIED HER! AND how uncommonly
ILL-TEMPERED SHE Has GRown .
TO CUFFEY IN MISFORTUNE.
DEAR MR. CUFFEy,
As I read over.your Trial, and that of your associates, which has
been occupying the public imattention for the past week, and has afforded a
spectacle of legal bally-ragging which covers Themis with contempt, and drags
the long robe in the mud, I have been made to think, as many others no
doubt have thought, too, of what would have happened after the 16th of August
º& º Cuffeyites had had their wicked way with the present Institutions of
e Uountry.
I wonder whether you now can lay F. hand on your heart, and say—“I
wish we could have done it!. I think if we could have piked the Cabinet; cut
the throats of the police; shut up the two Houses of Parliament; dismissed
ALBERT and his family to privacy and Saxe-Gotha; seized the Bank; smashed
the gas. lamps; taken possession of the Tower, and proclaimed the British
Republic, we leaders, should have very greatly benefited, and the whole nation
would have made an incalculable advance in liberty, comfort, and prosperity.”
Arsenal (for the gallant little spirit does not care about money
so much as war), and distribute a couple of hundred thousand
guns and bayonets to the people to keep down the atrocious
tyranny of the police...But all the leaders are not probably so
careless of gold as the little tailor. Mooney, Rooney, Loosey,
Hoolan, Doolan, and some of our Irish allies, who did us the
kindness to sympathise with us, would probably like the specie
with which the City abounds. Imust confess they are not far
wrong, and shouldn’t have the slightest objection, for my part,
supposing the general scramble or re-distribution of the pro-
perty of the country (such as the new philosophers propose) to
take place–I should not, Isay, have the slightest objection to
have the Bank for my scene of operations.
Well, we are in possession of the City. We announce that
the Government and the property of the country are henceforth
for the people; that working men's wages are trebled, and
bread and mutton brought downto a reasonable *: that the
tyrant landlords are to get no more rent, their land being as-
sumed by its rightful owners, the people; and a decree from
St. James's or Northumberland House, prefaced with God
Save the British Republic! and signed Looney, and counter-
signed Mooney—(if that child of Erin condescends to adopt the
usual orthographic symbols to represent his respectable name)
—signed, I say, Looney, and countersigned Mooney, informs
us that they have taken the high offices of state, and have con-
stituted themselves the Government of the country.
Now, CUFFEy, with your hand on your heart, say, do you
think you would have been better off, and that the people would
have profited by the change? You may have your doubts
about LoRD JoãN, as other people have, but would you rather
have him or Doolan for a Premier? Which is the best informed
man, the most conversant with public business and persons?
which would º trust, we will not say with a large sum of
money—for that is neither here northere, and an offensive sup-
sition—but with a complicated set of accounts?, Though
birth goes for nothing, and Doolan is a MAN, a capital man,
i. as much as my Lord—yet, as the life of the former has
een passed in the rapid ascent of ladders, the laying of bricks,
and the skilful management of hods, and, as a bricklayer, his
brother MAN is not fit to hold a trowel to him; so, in like
manner, in an affair of government, the advantages of early
practice, and, the prize for intelligence, political information,
and habits of labour, would be awarded to the other individual.
I am as good a MAN as you, CUFFEY, but I don't know how
to make a waistcoat near so well.
In the various conversations which are reported as having
taken place between the gentlemen about to arm against
Government, the destruction of the police, I perceive, is always
a preliminary measure.
The murder of the Peelers is the beginning of the Republic.
That seems to be a settled plan. Every new constitution or
º of liberty commences with the extermination of the poor
lues. I suppose a Revolution successful, and the police hung
up in blue clusters to the lamp-posts—acurious, edifying sight!
Now, the policemen hung, are we to go without guar s
altogether, or will you have gentlemen in brown coats in place
of the blue? Even a Republic must have some guardians; for
who knows what would be the quarrels about the distribution
of property; and whether Doolan, having taken possession of
the Bank, might not have a fancy to the ion House oppo-
site too, temporarily, and after the massacre of the Logo
MAYon, in the occupation of Hool.AN ? . These, quarrels,
divisions, would be endless, and always turning to the benefit
of the rascals of the community; for though you and I, Currey,
as honest men, would not wish to robour neighbours were the
temptation ever so, yet if there are no guardians, we may be
pretty sure thieves will flourish; and as, after roasting and
cutting the throats of the Municipal Guards in Paris, the great
French people found they were obliged to have an Urban
Guard, or a guard by some other name established, so our
Peelers being confiscated, you may be sure that Looney and
Rooney would be the first to bawl out for the organisation of
a body of men wh9 should keep property and patriots in order.
I mean, there is no use in killing policemen. We must
have them, under any form, of government, and as long as
thieves and rogues exist in this life. I daresay there are some
folks, (though I mean no personality) who would be...for
abolishing locks to doors, and turnkeys to Newgate. What
is the question, then, but a question of brown instead of blue,
and brass buttons, in place of pewter? ...The uniform may be
changed, but the MAN, CUFFEy, (the fellow in large capitals,
whom I love,) would remain the same.

... It stands to reason, too, that you would have to abolish the Press as
it at present exists, and as they have been obliged to do in France.
There is an office in Printing-House Square, another opposite Somerset
House, in the Strand, nay, a third little shop near St. Bride's Church
in Fleet Street, where I expect no slight interruption of business, and
to see plenty of broken glass. Nobody can doubt for an instant that
the Irish and English patriots who are bawling out about the bloody
Government and the enslaved Press, would, on the very moment when
they came into |.” abolish every, one of the Sº, journals.
They would be fools if they did not do so. We should all be gagged,
smashed, and silenced; the Times, the Chronicle, poor old Punch-ſfor
if we have the fortune to pass for dangerous levellers with some people,
we are considered aristocratic sneaks by others)—we should all be sent to
the right about; and all our compositors, reporters, editors, thundering-
leading-article-writers, wags, wives, servants, tradesmen, children, their
schoolmasters, and all depending on our labour, would be ruined at once.
And it is a fine thing to think that not we only, but all the commerce
of the whole City of London, would fall to ruin; the Stocks would fall
to zero; the merchants would not meet their his ; goods would tumble
to no price at all; rents would be nothing, and then they wouldn’t be
paid; the Early Člosing Movement in the shops would be impossible,
as the shops would never be opened—at least all this has happened on
the other side of the water, in ...” of disturbances caused by
the political opinions of many honest folks.
I picture to myself the City, the Republic *::: been proclaimed
there, and a few battalions with venerated chiefs quartered about
Threadneedle Street and the Mansion House. Of course all the bankers,
brokers, and monied men in the City would be obliged to shut up their
shops, and all their hundred thousand of clerks, with their neat little
houses about. Stockwell, Camberwell, Kennington, and Camden Town,
with their wives and families would be in desolation and ruin. Thé
house is shut up in the City—there is no money to pay the butcher;
the butcher has nobody to buy chops—the grazier cannot get off his
stock, because CUFFEY is in possession of the Tower, and the City
barricaded with omnibusses or blown up with ginger-beer bottles. -
The Republic and the Rights of Man proclaimed—everybody being
thrown out of work—the º Banker and the little clerk at forty
*...* who keeps his mother at Anna Maria Villas, Hoxton
ew -MoSEs and the sempstress who works that eminent
manufacturer's chemises for him—Punch and his poet, and the little
errand-boy who gets five shillings and is waiting in the hall for this
very, copy-everybody being, thrown out of work, and a general ruin
ensuing, I want to know who would be bettered by a Revolution?
The Five Points of the Charter may be good and wholesome in them-
selves; but what are they without a dinner? I would rather eat roast beef
under a tyrant NICHOLAs than starve under the most glorious Republic,
It is a vulgar and humiliating confession, but I own to it., Universal
Suffrage is a doubt, but Mutton is a certainty. I should not enjoy
the one, if I had it ever so much, without the other.
And after all, what is a vote, my CUFFEY P Perhaps it is only a
clumsy, barbarous, and absurd way of governing. If I, for instance,
and my neighbour, vote that your manner of stitching waistcoats is not
the correct one, neither of us knowing anything about tailoring, and if
we force |. who are sixty years old, and no doubt accomplished as a
snip, to alter your present method, we are certainly not working out
freedom for you nor benefit for us. A thing is not good because I vote
for it. A voteſ
popular vote; and the death of SQCRATEs was voted by an immense
majority. My poor old QUFFEy, I have read nothing, that was said at
the Orange-Tree or other houses-of-call ofº and nothing in your
own remarks, that makes me think it would be a particular benefit to
me to have you, and many millions of folks even inferior to you in
intelligence, legislating for the country in general.
...And iſ, in order to procure you this.--what'you call your undoubted
right, we must undergo ruin, as in rance, tyranny, as in France, we
must wait in daily expectation of conflict, and doubts of the future, we
must submit to strong military government, and rather than have 'Red
Republicans firing into bodies personal and legislative, our Archbishops,
and other recognised institutions, must defend our lives with bayonets,
at the sacrifice of our peace, press, freedom, customers, workpeople,
families—why, I say no; I had rather not murder my commerce or m
F.” for the sake of any of those prospective benefits about whic
doubt yery much, or those undoubted rights which I am perfectly
ready to forego. -
Yours, in sympathy, dear MR. CUFFEY,
33&Iſ?Cº.
Give Ireland its Due.
WE have heard of certain persons whose claims to distinction arose
from their being the “best abused men in the world.” This honour
has been disputed at times by innumerable claimants; but we never
recollect a country putting forward its pretensions to the title. We
demand it, therefore, on the part of Ireland, who, with all its faults,
has an undeniable right to be called “THE BEST ABUSED NATION IN
THE WORLD.”
Why, the Cross was raised upon Calvary by a | ||
&ſje 3Lagt & lett of the ºtagon at Eſaurijall.
WE regret to say that Vauxhall experienced its usual luck during
the final week of its season, which was a nightly succession of “tre-
mendous overflows.” Who can wonder that the lessee, the waiters,
the vocalists, and the fire-works, were all, most terribly put out? The
managers resolved on winding up brilliantly, and making a r
splash of it, but, they little expected that the only splash would be
caused by the paddling of the waiters and the visitors into the puddles
caused by, the elements having turned on the water with all their
|might and all their mains. ven the grog became dispirited by
the cold water thrown upon it, and the fifty thousand lamps felt
as if every jet was a jet d'eau. PELL could scarcely keep his
|cºuntenance for the wet that continually fell upon it, giving to his
nigger personations a new and rather varied complexion, as the rain
kept pouring into every pore. His attempts at dry humour were
|utterly fruitless, and the moisture seemed to have penetrated even his
renowned bones.
FIGHTING FOR A SONG.
EvoluTIONs come and go in France, and each leaves behind it
a song. Thus, for the first Revolution, France was endowed
with the Marseillaise. - -
For the Second she received as a legacy the Parisienne.
J. For the Third she has come into possession of Mourir pour
la Patrie.
That song, by the bye, has not been so popular lately. Are Frenchmen
beginning to find out that there is a “sort plus digne d'envie” than
dying for one's country in the very, “fraternal” manner in which they
have lately been doing it. . No fashion, we know, lives § in France,
but this new Mode of patriotism has been short-lived indeed. ...Perhaps
the fact of so many Frenchmen having carried out literally the parti-
ÉMas
et des Révolutions.”
cular “sort” of thing prescribed by the song, may have had something
to do with it? Dying must come very monotonous at last, even when
* such a Patrie as France as an inducement to go out of the
world.
To sum up: France has had three Revolutions, and she has three
songs to show for it. For ourselves, we would sooner be without any
songs at all, unless they contained far better."motifs.” France, has
always styled itself “Le pays des Chansons.” . The title is only good by
one half. Henceforth it should be altered into “Le pays des Chansons
Here's to You.
LoRD AsHLEY, and MR. CHADwick have already commenced their
sanitary labours in good earnest, and they have intimated to FATHER
THAMEs that they hope soon to have the F. of drinking his health;
with a view to which excellent object they trust he will be fully pre-
pared to “stand a drain.” LoRD AshLEY, whose zeal has been very
active on behalf of the sempstresses, is now about to assist in seeing
what can be done for the sewers. We are glad to see this promptitude,
for “a stitch in time saves nine.”

“DID YOU wanT A DONKey, SIR.?”
A ROTATORY IRISH PUNCH.
RotATORY Parliaments are the last new panacea proposed for the evils of Ireland, which they
are as likely to cure as Vegetable Pills would be to arrest an attack of cholera. To send a
Parliament whirling through Ireland would not even have the effect of suggesting to the Irish
the industrious art of † It would be almost as wise to start LEDRU RoLLIN, as to cause
Parliament to rotate over the Emerald Isle. The circumgyrations of such a senate could have
no other effect than those of a top; namely, to produce a mere hum. Rotatory Parliaments, we
are quite sure, would only prove the wheels of Irish misgovernment. There is, indeed, a rotatory
power which might be set in action with great benefit in Ireland. We modestly allude to
ourself; for we feel confident that a Rotatory Punch would in a short time be quite certain to
rub down all Irish asperities. With this view we are making arrangements for periodical publi.
cation in all the principal towns in the sister kingdom; and it will only rest with the Irish to put
their shoulders to the wheel, and communicate to it the . rotation. We should at all
d never be accomplished by such
events succeed in amusing the Irish mind—a result which co
childish playthings as the proposed Parliamentary whirligigs.
BARON NATHAN ON THE BENCH.
It is with unmixed satisfaction that we have heard of our being, likely to meet with BARON
NATHAN in a new and highly important character. The same ambition, which egged, him on
to the new-laid eggs, and the same blind goddess who put the cambric handkerchief over his eyes,
in that famous reel when he reeled with the intoxication of success—these same stimulants have
taught him new steps, and have directed him even to aim at judicial honours in his baronial
capacity. BARON NATHAN has actually advertised his intention to “proceed on his arduous duties
in the North Riding of . - -
Ay, and he will accomplish the great task he has undertaken; , Who that has seen him twirl
and twirl, and twirl again, in the graceful fandango, will doubt his capacity for “going the
Circuit?” Who that has heard him order about the waiters at Rosherville, will question, his
power to make his own “rule absolute?” Who that has witnessed the easy, undulating
movement of his hornpipe, will fail to recognise, in his natural and effortless action, the very
principle of that “motion of course,” which
is no less important to law than charac-
teristic of the Baron's deportment.
When, after the dignities of the day, after
a fête at Tivoli, he thrown himself on
the Bench before the door of the tavern
department, and ordered the flipping of just
one of those eggs upon which he has lately
conferred hornpipean honours—when, we re-
peat, he is seen reclining on the Bench under
such circumstances, who shall say that his
sittings in banco will not be equal to the
most dignified séance of Pollock, WILDE, or
DENMAN ? Under BARON NATHAN's judicial
auspices, if he condescends to criminal
matters, we may expect to see the hornpipe
in fetters revived in full force, and the chaine
des dames arranged for female prisoners.
A WALK FOR SIR PETER LAURIE.
SoME short time ago SIR PETER LAURIE
declared that he would at any time walk
twenty miles to see a reformed culprit. Only
last week, one SARAH ANN FREnch—an old
associate of “dashing housebreakers,” an
offender who had seen the inside of Bridewell
—was brought before the LoRD MAYor,
having broken a pane of glass in order to be
sent to prison. She said, “she had been
pursuing very abandoned courses, was in a
desolate condition, and hoped in time, through
the interference of the magistrate, to be
restored to society again!” His Lordship
seemed inclined to believe the sinner; and, it
is said—though we vouch not for the truth of
the report—ordered his clerk to drop a line
to SIR PETER, advising the knight to put
himself in walking condition.
twenty miles from SIR PETER’s town-house
to ANN FRENCH's prison, he will—for con-
science sake-go backwards and forwards
As it is not
until he completes the promised distance.
SIR PETER's match is not inst time but
repentance; in which case we hope repentance
may win.

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE THIRD.
PROGRESS OF ENGLISH LIBERTY UNDER HENRY THE THIRD AND
EDWARD THE FIRST.
HE British Constitution, like
: the British baby, was fre-
quently in extreme peril dur-
ing the period of infancy; or,
to use a more apt illustration,
the British Lion was as
troublesome to rear as a
young child, and experienced
its regular routine of maladies
peculiar to the early stages of
* all our existences. In the
midst of convulsions it had
cut its teeth—a process typi-
fied by the bristling up of the
steel-pointed swords of the
discontented Barons, who
swore “by gum ” that they
would never “bite the dust; ”—it encountered its moral measles when
an eruption of a “rash” character broke out in the time of HENRY
THE THIRD by the turbulence of the nobility, and there were symp-
toms of a sort of Constitutional weakness of the chest, in the drain
Perhaps, however, the more or less gentle irritation that was kept
up preserved the blood of the nation at a wholesome heat; and it is not
improbable also that the frequency of the attacks which the Constitution
in its infancy was doomed to undergo, caused the adoption of a strict
regimen, which has laid the foundation of future strength and salubrity.
However great may have been the value of Magna Charta to succeedin
generations, we doubt whether it can be said to have paid the origina
grantees, for it cost them enormous sums in renewals, repairs, and
additions, which, whenever a king was short of cash, were always
HENRY THE
THIRD carried this principle to a ruinous extent, for he passed the
whole of his minority in obtaining fresh advances upon this great Con-
stitutional security, which, on coming of age, he repudiated under the
plea of infancy; and after he had turned twenty-one, he negotiated the
same bill, taking care to exact a tremendous bonus as the consideration
for his undertaking so large a liability.
Throughout the whole of his reign HENRY THE THIRD was continually
trampling the Charters under his feet; or, to speak figuratively, he
danced over them a series of hornpipes, in which the double shuffle was
the most º: step; but he generally had the cunning to get
the Parliament or the people to pay the piper. Sometimes, however, he
carried his antics a little too far, and the Parliament took the great
Constitutional liberty of ...; to send an answer when he called
for a subsidy; and in these cases his anger was shown in his declaring
that if he was not enabled to liquidate his debts, he could at least do
something in the way of liquidation by dissolving the Parliament. This
great and glorious privilege of refusing the Supplies was practised with
such effect, that in one instance HENRY was compelled to sell, his
private plate, which, as kings are born with silver spoons in their
mouths, he could not have missed very grievously.
But a new actor now comes upon the Constitutional stage, and we
eet him with a cry of “Hats off!” “Down in front l” for it is
2DwARD THE FIRST who passes before the footlights of History. He
made such a hit in the character of a law-maker, that he
got the name of the English JustiNIAN, just as Cooper
was called the American WALTER Scott ; and as a
certain Albata philosopher—a spoon making some stir in
the present day—might deserve the title of the British
Plate-o. This sovereign, whose approach is trumpeted
by several flourishes of our brazen pen, was called Long-
shanks, as some say from the length of his legs; but, in
our private opinion, from the enormous strides he took
in advance of all former sovereigns. He was a man of
somewhat expensive habits; and, being fond of the
amusement of war, he required a good supply of its
sinews; "which of course,” says that odious SPELMAN,
“he could only obtain, by insinewating himself into the
good graces of his people.”
Having flattered the vanity of the nobles by fleecing
them until any further shearing them wºuld have been a
sheer impossibility, he bethought him of the Commons, and caused them
to be invited by the sheriff to send deputies for every city and borough,
—an invitation which, as it was only intended to give them an opportu.
nity of contributing to the Supplies, was equivalent to the old cry of
“Dilly, Dilly,” &c., with which the ducks of nursery tradition were
lured to the sacrifice. Nevertheless, it was a “great point gained,” as
DELoLME truly observes, for it gave the Commons the pleasant privi-
lege of assisting at their own victimisation; and the words used in the
writ of requisition, being ad faciendum—literally, to be done—et con-
sentiendum, and to consent, to it, would seem to imply that there was
little attempt to disguise the object for which the towns and boroughs
were required to send deputies. It is, however, one thing to bring a
horse to the water, but another to make him drink; and though the
Commons in those days could be got to swallow a good deal, they were
not always to submit quietly to have crammed down their throats
whatever was set before them. -
They at all events had the opportunity of complaining; and the luxury
of grumbling has been, from the earliest times to the present, one
of the most delicious enjoyments of the English people. The roar
was always the most formidable attribute of the K. Lion: the
growl was ever the most alarming symptom of the British Bull Dog:
the complaint that “things, never were worse” is, to this hour, the
great consolation of the British merchant; a lamentation...over its
own decline, is the only thing that keeps the British Drama alive; and
grumble, grumble, grumble, is the great safety-valve of the British
public in general. -
There is no doubt that the taking part of the Commons in the busi-
ness of the legislature, was a great privilege, for they thus formed a
portion of the organ of Government, and even if their position relative
to the organ was only that of bellows-blower, it was natural that they
should sometimes get rather inflated themselves; for the occupation of
raising the wind, even for other people, is an office of some dignity.
It would seem that the invention of the friends of Freedom was not
very fertile in former times, for we find little originality in the efforts
made for advancing the cause of liberty. Nothing new was devised;
but the people were continually falling back upon Magna Charta,
which inºt the process of confirmation no less than eleven times
during Edward THE FIRST's reign, until the old roll must have become
.# stale, and the desire for something new must have been
general.
Edward seems to have become blasé of Magna Charta himself, for
he introduced a most successful novelty in the shape of the statute
de tallagio non concedendo, which provided that no tax should be laid
nor impost levied without the joint consent of both Lords and Commons;
an arrangement which placed the Royal purse in the people's pocket,
though it was very long before the pocket was protected against the
fingers, both royal and aristocratic, that took the liberty of dipping into
it. Sovereigns and nobles continued the practice, or rather, kept their
hands in, until very recent times; and, feeling it to be our duty io trace
the progress of the great moral and social watchword, “Take care of your
pockets!” through every reign, we shall mark how the most flagrant
instances of light-fingery were visited with a rap on the knuckles, until
the system has reached such perfection that the most itching palm can
grasp nothing that must not on the nail be accounted for. -
THE EARLY TWANKAY MOVEMENT.
“MR. PUNCH, - - -
“WHERE are we going? More shops shutting up at six
o'clock? Why, after dark, London streets won't be worth looking at ;
and nobody will be about their business but pickpockets.. I’ve just
read it in the papers that the grocers are going to put by their canisters
and put up their shutters at six at night; so if anybody’s dying for an
ounce of tea, or a half-pound of sugar, they may die till next morning,
for nobody will serve 'em.
“And they say this is all to improve the young men's minds. No
doubt of it. Improve their billiards, Mr. Punch, improve their cigars;
improve all sorts of idleness. Why, Sir, we shall have balloons from
all sorts of places at half-a-crown a head; and all the 'prentices of
º will be always going up a purpose to look down upon their
etters. -
“Why, Mr. Punch, half the pleasure of life was doing a little bit of
shopping at night; and, as for the young men behind the counters, it
kept 'em out of mischief to keep ’em at business till it was time to go
to their honest beds: now, they'll give their minds to dominoes,
and politics, and Chartism, and high treason. Early closing of shops
will be the early opening of the Old Bailey. Besides, some colours
never looked so well as by candle-light; and Regent Street never
so handsome as by gas. And now young men are to shut their shops
that they may open their minds! o you think HER MAJESTY
could be persuaded to go in state to Twining's at nine at night-just
once, by way of protest; and the aristocracy be made to dine at eleven,
that they might shop up to ten at night? . Depend upon it they ought,
if they knew their own interests; for this counter-movement—as my
husband says—is sure to end in counter-revolution,
“Yours
*BoAnices.”

BY THE BUOY AT THE NORE.
IT must be a curious spectacle for the
old mariner who has not been down the
river for several years, to watch the
new towns that have lately sprung up,
like so many aquatic mushrooms, on
each side of the Thames. If the popu-
lation only manages, to keep pace with
the mania for building, the “silent
highway” will soon become as noisy
and as populated as the New Cut. The
river will be only one immense street
and wherries filled with vegetables, an
funnies loaded with fruit or fish, will be
rowing for custom up and down the two
banks. Who can say whether large
barges will not in time be fitted up as
hotels, and a little town of inhabited
boats moored in the middle of the stream,
in the same way that the Chinese take
to the water, and cast their anchors for
life from the cabin, of some pictorial
junk, when the land is not large enough
to hold the tremendous overflow of population? A gentleman's card,
with the address, “21st Yacht, Collier's Canal, London Bridge,” may
create no more surprise in 1948 than the simple address of the “Albany”
does at present. -
The newest of these new towns is North Woolwich. It is the
younger brother of Woolwich, or rather it looks like a poor relation of
Old Woolwich, which, finding, it cannot prevent. its having the same
name, is determined to keep it at a respectful distance, and so sends
it to the opposite side of the river.
I doubt if North Woolwich has taken its dot yet as a town on any
map. The only gazetteer that mentions it is BRADSHAW. It may be
necessary, therefore, to describe its §§
North Woolwich is situated on the Wapping side of the Thames.
After you leave Blackwall, it is the first town on the left, on the road to
India. It is well worth stopping at to explore, for it is a perfect curiosity
of a town. It is a little bijou of a *::: that you might almost, wear
in your scarf as a .*. ;I should not advise any lengthened
stay, however, at North Woolwich, unless you have an intention of
turning hermit, or meditate *...* a tragedy, or wish to escape from
a wild mother-in-law or creditor; for, to tell you the truth, there is not
a bed in the place. . .
“No bed!” exclaims the reader. “Then there is no hotel?” Oh yes,
there is ; that is to say, if you can call a Railway Refreshment-room an
hotel. You can live very well, too, if you have a taste for cherry-brandy
and ginger-beer, and are fond of captain's biscuits for dinner. -
There are not many buildings at North Woolwich; in fact, there is
only one, but that is a good-sized one. It is the Railway Station,
Trains run between North Woolwich and Shoreditch, which has a great
influence at certain hours upon the population of the former place; for,
with the Stoker and the Guard, there have been as many as four souls
at the same time in this promising little watering-place; but then this
has included the Railway Clerk and the young lady at the Refreshment-
room, both of whom are day-boarders.
I, should say, that, the traveller, had better visit, its hospitable

without dislocating your neck, as the pier is on a level nearly with the
shore. Here, and there it is decorated with a flower-pot, and at one
end is inhabited, for the Jack-in-the-Water has constructed, for
himself a snug parlour in the interior of the barge. This, with true

Jon Es, before you can surmount them. The pier is accommodated
with a suspension bridge, which must be made of Gutta Percha, for
it bends and stretches just like a silk stocking, and allows the pier to
walk out to any distance that it pleases into the surrounding mud.
The consequence is, that at low water, North Woolwich has such a
dreadful sinking, that you fancy it never could rise again or possibly
recover itself. -
Above the bridge is a plantation of first-rate sunflowers, very prettily
laid out, and edged with a running border of flints, so white outside
they look as if they had been lathered for shaving. In the centre of the
most gorgeous group sprouts a tremendous flag-staff, which reaches
here a very high state of cultivation. This is accounted for by the fact
of its serving as a landmark when the spring-floods are turned on, and
the face of the country is covered over with one immense sheet of water.
The weathercock of North Woolwich then is of the greatest service,
for it serves to keep up the post between the mainland and the Isle of
Dogs, when the latter cannot show its head for a similar cause of de;
pression. If it were not for this communication, the natives would
never be able to receive their letters, and the Revenue, probably,
would be a considerable loser.
There is not much Commerce at North Woolwich. I have referred

fesses to give a correct account

over to Woolwich for their mid-day meal., The conflict to get into the

Altogether North Woolwich is well worth a visit. I will warrant
the visitor has never seen anything like it. It is neat, humble, beau-
tifully clean, can boast of a flower-garden, and the handsomest pier on
the river. It must rise, and will rise, despite the attempts of every tide
to pull it down, and I have no doubt that in time it may be a second

Greenwich, be returning its two Members to Parliament. I have no
doubt North Woolwich will feel the “Good time that’s coming,

A TOAST FOR THE CITY.
At the next civic dinner that Mr. Punch is invited to, he will take
the . of proposing a toast. The subject to which Mr. Punch will
allude, will, he is sure, be one of interest to all present... Mr. Punch
will observe, that at a Court of Common Council lately held for despatch
of business the following motion was put and carried:—
“That this Court do agree with the Commissioners of Sewers that it is highly
necessary that a medical officer be forthwith appointed, and that a sum for the pur-
se, not exceeding 4150, be #. out of the City cash, and that the Court of Sewers
e required to nominate two fit and proper persons, of whom this Court will appoint
one, to be the medical officer of health for this City and Liberties.”
Mr. Punch will congratulate the Court of Common Council on their
considerate desire to render their medical officer exempt from Income-
tax. He will also congratulate them on the skill and talent which they
| expect to get for a sum not exceeding £150 a year. Mr. Punch
will venture to suggest that a young man just out of his apprenticeship,
or an old one in despair of a practice, will be the kind of man for their
money. Whether he will exactly be a fit and proper person for the
rather important office to be intrusted to him, Mr. Punch will not under-
take to determine. Mr. Punch will preface, with these brief remarks
the proposal of a toast, which he feels sure will be cordially responde
to. Mr. Punch will then give “The very good Health of the City of
London and its Liberties, and may it be attended to as well as it ought
to be by the medical officer to be appointed to take charge of it, at so
liberal, munificent, and remunerative a salary 1”

THE º: of Tom Thumb has been produced at this dreary
establishment for domestic tragedy; and, although there was consider-
able drollery manifested in the course of the piece, the curtain fell upon
a very serious interest. The part of Grizzle was performed with de-
lightful ferocity by a MR. Edws Rp KENEALEY, an actor from the Sister
Isle, almost new to the Old Bailey boards. It was impossible not to
admire the energy and precision with which he flung about him those
|flowers of rhetoric whose native soil is Billingsgate. . He pelted. Lord
Doodle (represented by SIR John JEEvis) with considerable felicity;
now and then hurling at him—as a change from blossoms-some very
bad, and much blighted potatoes. The audience testified their admira:
tion of the genius of tº: young actor by very significant shouts of
laughter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PEEP AT LONDON THROUGH A TELESCOPE.
--
THERE can be no doubt that London is on
the point of finding its level very soon; for,
when viewed through a telescope, we make
the wretched discovery that the capital is in
the hands of a set of levellers, more deter-
mined and more dumpy than even CUFFEY
himself. At the corner of every street may
be seen a sort of military occupation going
forward, and at a distance the whole city
seems to be studded with odd-looking erec-
tions, intended to ascertain “the decline and
fall” of the great metropolis, in the gradual
descent of its sewers. To the uninitiated,
-
-
the effect is somewhat alarming, for in these
days of barricades it is a suspicious circum-
stance for soldiers to be seen planting their
apparatus in the public thoroughfares, as if
there was some idea of an intended “frater-
misation” of some kind or other. It is satis-
factory to feel that the warlike preparations
now going forward are directed only against
the dregs of our sewers, not against the dregs
of our population; and that, instead of being
called upon to “drain our dearest veins,” we
are only required to drain our houses rather
better than heretofore.
THE MANAGER AND THE PLAYERS.
“That strain again.”—Shakspeare.
..THE Bard of Drury Lane—removed to Covent Garden—has prelu-
dised in the newspapers. “Several journals,” he sings, “have ob.
served upon the omission of the names of the professors of the legitimate
Drama in my programme.” For ourselves, we would sooner see
legitimate elephants and legitimate zebras at either Drury Lane or
Covent Garden than any of the legitimate little ones of the spring-cart
of THESPIs. We know that many very worthy old gentlemen are
troubled—regularly as with winter cough or periodical shooting of corms
—with twinges of grief at what is now regularly accepted as the dese-
cration of the boards where GARRICK trod and SIDDons fainted. We
are above such weakness. We could see a dromedary take either of
the patent stages, and feel no sympathy for any absent Gloster; and for
this sufficient reason: the patents abolished, Gloster may be had at any
other establishment. Now, he has a wide range; being permitted to
pitch his tent anywhere, from Whitechapel to London.
This being the case, Gloster's boar—if introduced in a drama measured
for his tusks—is much better placed at either of the late patents than
Gloster himself; whose artistic beauties are surely more visible to the
naked, eye at the Haymarket than at Drury Lane or Covent Garden.
The Manager, however, gave handsome invitations to a certain number
of the legitimate actors--wandering stars—to come and shine in his
play-bills. He says (or sings):—
“I offered Miss HELEN FAU cit the highest salary (£25 per week) given to that
delightful actress Miss O'Neill, when she was drawing all the world after her, but
Miss F Aucit demanded £15 per night, which is £90 per week.”
MRs. NISBETT is offered MRs. JoBDAN’s salary, £25 per week; but,
says the Manager—
“I was scared by her intimation that she had recently been in the receipt of £60,
and was exempt from playing in after-pieces !”—
MRs. NISBETT being, no doubt, a staunch advocate of early closing. The
Manager next turned to MR. ANDERson.
“I was prepared to give MR, ANDERson £20 per week—higher terms than he had
with Mr. MacReady at Drury Lane; but he required £10 per night—4:00 per week—
with certain, other drolleries, quite bijoux in their way; and recollecting that the
KEAN had £25 per week in the plenitude of his attraction, I felt called upon to
decline the difference.”
After such terms demanded, ought we to condemn the Manager if, in
the course of the season, he should wander to the Zoological Gardens,
and-like his brother bard, ORPHEUs—soothe the beasts into his
own terms?
The letters in answer to the Manager have, of course, come into our
hands. Punch will not print the º: of the ladies—(be feminine
pothooks eyer respected!)—but the ſetter of Mr.Anperson is so good,
is so full of the art and the actor, that justice to the noble and dis-
interested profession of which MR. A. is an effulgent member, compels
Punch to hand down the missive to the very last posterity.

tragedy. . There is no doubt that a trip across the Atlantic enlarges
the histrionic faculty, and the tragedian, thus increased, is entitled to

OLD FAWOURITES RETURNED.
In the revived piece of Court Beauties, now performing at the
Lyceum, two old performers have been restored to the stage in their
original characters... We allude to the re-appearance of two little dogs
of the real KING CHARLEs's breed, who made some sensation a few
years ago, under MADAME WESTRIs's management at the Olympic. The
return of these old favourites was greeted with considerable applause,
which was increased almost to enthusiasm when the dogs, made the
faintest of bows (wows) in acknowledgment. Such, we understand, is
the sagacity of these performers, that when the call to rehearsal was
first put up in the theatre over which they have the run, they barked in
acquiescence at the prompter, and sat at the wing waiting for their
cues while the earlier, scenes of Court Beauties were being proceeded
with... We understand that these extraordinary animals were punctual
in their attendance at the treasury door on Saturday, when six nights'
full salary, in the º: of a couple of pounds—of dogs’ meat—was dealt
out to them. The dogs went through their respective parts with all
that smoothness and polish for which they were so remarkable a few
seasons ago, and the usual admiration was bestowed upon the coats of
both, which are exactly in conformity with the costume of the period.

HOPES FOR HERNE BAY.
22-sºº =s HE present state
of the Conti-
ment, which has
closed its ports
against plea-
sure-seekers,
blocked up the
gangways of
| Our steamers
against travel-
º lers,stopped the
zº sale of MUR-
sº RAY’s
* Books, and
- - driven no end
of kings from their thrones, has nevertheless opened out to Herne Bay
a prospect of not only taking its well-merited place in the scale of
watering-places, but of building for itself, on the ruins of monarchies,
a substantial prosperity. It is indeed an ill wind that blows nobody
good; and the blasts of revolution which tore up the Orleans branch of
the Bourbon tree, without leaving it time to secure its trunk, but sent
it packing, without even a portmanteau to pack—these very same gusts
will probably fill with a prosperous breeze the sail of Herne Bay’s luggage-
van, turn once more the long stagnant arms of its deserted windmills,
and breathe a healthful inspiration into its commerce, hitherto struck
with an almost deadly dormancy.
We know that, in the opinion of many, the shout of “Revive Herne
Bay!” will seem almost as wild as the cry of “Restore the Heptarchy!”
A scornful world looks at the potato crops luxuriating in what ought to be
the kitchens, sees a horse munching grass in a front parlour, and meets
with a cow uttering its lowlow in some half-finished scullery, while the
farmer cuts his wheat—amidst his neighbours' chaff—from the centre of
an acre of coal-cellars; but we look upon the Bay of Herne with a different
eye, and see not why civilisation and progress should necessarily be kept at
bay—or rather kept from bay—in the midst of all the world's vicissi-
tudes. We have a proposal for its benefit... Our plan is to convert
the really beautiful. Bay into one great substitute for all the watering-
places of the Continent, by the introduction into its bosom of every
source of attraction for which the famous foreign rendezvous are
remarkable. It only wants a pasteboard Cathedral to make it a Cologne
a set of canvass Alps to render it a Geneva, the Surrey Zoological
Vesuvius to turn it into a Naples, a brass band to make it a Darmstadt,
a dice-box or a rouge-et-noir table to constitute it a Baden-Baden; a
sprinkling of sprouts to realise a Brussels, an artichoke or two to
flavour it with a Jerusalemish aspect, a few Venetian blinds to invest it
with the air of a Venice, with moonlight mights from the Colosseum,
warranted to last all the year round.
. With its wonderful extent of acreage, exceeding the area of Vauxhall
in the proportion of ten to one, Herne Bay may hope to realise to
the imagination of every banished outcast the picture of his own native
land. As the Albata is recommended to the lover of plate as the only
perfect substitute for silver—in every respect but its value—so Herne
Bay can offer to exiled foreigners the only perfect substitute for their
own sunny climes. To travellers, also, the Bay will present a grand
réunion of all the attractions of all the foreign resorts they have been
accustomed to visit, if our plan should be carried out. Let the inha-
bitants summon BRADwell, and the thing is done. . Herne Bay, in
spite of all its great matural advantages, has long languished for want of
men of property, but it is clear that property men, in the theatrical sense
of the term, must be the regenerators of the place.
“PICK UP THE PIECES.”
WHAT does the word “United ” mean? It must have different
significations. We always imagined it meant “firm, compact, bound
together, of one piece;” but late events seem to have broken up this
meaning into a thousand pieces, and there seems now to be nothing
binding about it.
For instance, there were the “United Irishmen,” who were always
divided; for some “Rent” or other invariably caused a distance between
them, and then they went at it like hammer and tongs, or like Concilia-
tion and Confederation Halls. And yet they were called “United.”
Then there is the United Empire of Germany, parcelled out into
hundreds of little States, no bigger than pins, all knocking their heads
together, and calling out for Unity. Occasionally there is a disturbance
at Wurtemburg; then you hear of a few crowns being broken at Baden:
Baden; and after that you read of a violent collision at Frankfort; and
yet, far and near, the cry is raised for the German People to be United.
The same clamour is heard in Italy, and as yet with no better result.
There are bombardments, royal butcheries, towns taken and retaken,
Hand:
armies organised and disorganised, and all to enforce the necessity of
the Italians being “United.”
The United States might also be called as a witness, to prove that
“United” has not the same meaning with nations and persons as it
has with things. It seems to us that one side of a kingdom, may be at
open variance with another, either, about rent, slaves, religion, taxes;
beer, or potatoes, and still, the kingdom, will be called “ inited.”
We cannot make it out, and vote that a Commission be appointed to
inquire into the meaning of the word—only there must be no Irishmen
upon it, or else the result of the inquiry will, infallibly be that
“ United” meant nothing more than “Disunited.”. But who knows
whether this very Irish Bull, would not toss us right into the middle
of the meaning of the word, whilst we might be beating about the
bush for weeks to find it? -
So, till Unity can be bound to keep the piece, we beg all lexicogra-
phers to amend the definition in their future Dictionaries, and write
OWn-
UNITED, a. Broken, Disjointed, Mutilated, Disunited.—Er. gr., Ger-
many, Italy, France, and Ireland.
A DREAM IN THE SHERIFF'S COACH.
OH then, I see, #. LAURIE’s been with you;
He is the Sheriff’s coachmaker, and builds
A drag no smaller than is suitable
For the dimensions of an Alderman, ,
Drawn by a team of little º:
To bear his worship as he lolls asleep; .
The chariot wheels of pink, picked out with blue ;
The body like the wings of butterflies;
The traces studded o'er with silver knobs;
The collars F. and glittering with japan;
The whip of amber, and the lash of green;
The coachman a lace-coated liveryman,
Not half so slender as a beadle, bred
To twenty stone upon parochial fat;.
The coach is made by LAURIE and his Co.,
Time out of mind the City coachmakers. .
And in this state the slumbering Sheriff rides
By butchers' shops, and then he dreams of beef;
By fishmongers', and then of turbot straight;
By poulterers', then of capons dreameth he ;
By cooks', and then he doth on turtle dream,
Or haply venison comes athwart his nose,
And then he dreams of gloating o'er a haunch;
And sometimes Fancy, with a roast-pig's tail,
Tickles his palate as he lies asleep.
Oft times he rideth to the Mansion House,
And then he dreams of feasting foreign kings,
Italian, Russian, Prussian, Spanish blades;
Of toasts five fathom deep, and then anon
Cheers in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus roused, gives a hooray, or two,
And snores again. True, these are only dreams,
Begot of nothing more than phantasy,
Suggested by the Sheriff's flaming coach.
PRETTY LICENSE INDEED !
THE “Killing of Hares of Scotland Act” has conferred upon the
landowners of Ścotland a privilege which, if carried out, would be
likely to rid them far more rapidly of the burden of the #ntail Laws
than the provisions which the same Session made, for that express
purpose. The Act above mentioned allows any landlord tº "kill him-
º which is the most suicidal Act ever committed by Parliament;
but more than this, it allows “another person to do so,” which is Ing
the license a little too far. But really it is too bad to make game of the
Scotch landlords in this pointed way. . It could not well º wºrse, if
they lived over in Ireland. We expect to read in next year's debates
(though we are by no means anxious to anticipate that pleasure) the
following motions of course:- -
*MRTANstry moved for a return of the landlords in Scotland who
had killed themselves.” -
"Mr. Urquhart moved for a return of the landlords in Scotland
and Ireland who had been killed by others.” - -
Seriously, however, there should be a gamekeeper appointed in the
House, to prevent. Honourable Members walking over the QUEE's
English, and sporting with such deadly aim amongst the pronºuns.
We know nothing is too “personal” for M.P.'s, but we should like to
beinformed how many “relatives” of LiNDLEY MURRAY they bagged
last Session!

ALARMING PROSPECTS.
To Mr. Punch.
“SIR,-We live in awful times, as my late husband remarked at the
time of the Reform Biſi, but what would he have said now?" And
what with Prussia, and France, and Red Republics everywhere, and
countries one never heard of—such as Jellachich (where that can be,
*Evins only knows)—I am sure one needn't have had that wretch CUFFEY

“But we have not seen the worst yet, depend upon it; and what’s
brewing I’m sure it would take a wiser woman than me to tell; but I
call upon you, Sir, to explain the awful advertisements one sees every

last week, called the ‘ Palaeontographical Society’—something repub-

Testacea of the Great Oolite. Who the ‘Great Oolite” may be, I don't
know for certain; but no doubt it’s their horrid slang for the Queen,
or Lord John Russell, or the DUKE of WELLINGTON, or somebody.
And a MR. RUPERT Jones there is, -which you will remember,
Sir, one ERNEST. Jones, who is to deal with the ‘Entomostraceous

will turn out to be, mark my words; and I am surprised Government
should allow such advertisements. Who knows, one mayn't be
an “Entomostraceous animal’ oneself? If you can throw any light on

British and Foreign Street-sweeping.
SoME of our readers may have noticed a machine of ingenious con-
struction, drawn by a horse, which, makes the circuit of the western
thoroughfares of the metropolis, and in its progress brushes up all the
mud. We allude to this contrivance for the purpose of remarking how
much preferable is the above-mentioned mode of sweeping the streets
to that which has been lately adopted in certain continental capitals, of
sweeping them with grape.
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.
HR following advertisement
lately appeared in the Times
newspaper:-
BARGAIN.—Y. Z. being
placed by circumstances
so that he does not require the
following, which he offers for
Sale:—The Receipt for making a
Patent Medicine,which he brought
out four years since. It is quite
superior to anything OF THE
KiND, has TAKEN remarkably
well, and REALLY an Excellent
Medicine, and very pleasant to the
taste. It is a gentlemanly employ-
º ment, requiring but little atten-
tion, and from which a fortune
may speedily be made. Apply,
&c., &c.
..Here, then, is a real opening for an enterprising capitalist, who is
disposed to go heartily into the *atent Medicine line; but, as we think
the advertisement scarcely does justice to its object, we propose a sale
by auction, which should be announced in the following manner-
PILLS - PILLS - PILLS .
The present proprietor, who has lived formany years upon a Pill, from
which he is about to retire to a Box in the country, having amassed a
plum, has resolved on offering the Pill to public competition. The
Pill needs only to be known to be appreciated; and such has been its
success, as far as it has been tested, that it is generally talked about,
and is in the mouth of every one who has taken it. In addition to the
Pill itself, the proprietor will submit to auction
THE SPLENDID ADVERTISING CART,
Which has been twice in custody for its admirable barricading qualities,
and is warranted to create a crowd, with that most desirable incident
—a quarrel with the police-in any "..."; tº it makes its
appearance. The whole of the valuable Bill-sticking Apparatus will
also form a separate lot, including-
200 POUNDS

THAT VERY CLEVER DOG

it at once into a

In connection with this invest-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,

THE ENGLISH PAINTED BY THE FRENCH.
THE following extract is taken literally from a late number of the
Constitutionnel. It is a chapter of a romance, called Le Cabinet Noir.
The sooner this Cabinet is thrown out, we should say, from the specimen
below, the better. However, it is too peculiar to be lost. 6 are
sure the British Peerage will be a little astonished at the new genea-
logical tree introduced, root and branch, into it. One thing, however,
is certain, that no noble house in England can boast of such a peculiar
line of descent as the one at present eulogised. Without further
flourish, we inform the reader it is the “House that JACK (KETCH)
built.” The writer (a Mons. CHARLEs RABOU, a name that henceforth
must upset LoDGE, and throw BURKE from the Sublime into the
Ridiculous), devotes a whole chapter to “KITTY KETCH. Amongst
other absurdities, too numerous to mention, he informs us that—
“This KITTY KETch was a young and pretty girl, having the purity and the
sprightly tourmure of the lily, with the freshness of the rose in the month of May.
“She was well known in the capital of England, first of all on account of her
beauty, but more especially on account of the profession exercised by her father.
Since the reign of CHARLEs THE FIRsr, the Kerches have been the public execu-
tioners in London. It is a family which does not yield ANYTHING IN Notos IETY
(en notorieté) to THE PRoddest NAMEs of THE English AR1stocaacy, and which has
established for itself a sort of nobility with the people, by the cord and the gallows.
“Far from detracting from the success of the lovely KITTY, the lugubrious pro-
fession which the worthy author of her days followed seemed rather to have multi-
plied the number of her admirers and sighing lovers. For many she had the
particular attraction, which is found amongst actresses, of occupying a prominent
position before the public eye. For others, which is generally the result of contrast,
the glory (l'auréole) of blood which circled her fair forehead spoke with a strange
eloquence to the imagination ; and upon the foggy banks of the Thames, where the
national character delights rather to come in contact with gloomy ideas, KITTY had
become such a matter of fashion, that bankers, the most opulent Jews, the greatest
political celebrities, and even several Members of the Royal Family, would willingly
have laid down, if her heart had only listened to their appeals, the most fabulous
prices for the possession of her hand.”
We hope the absurdity of our extract will compensate for its length.
But, absurd as it is, we can deduce several facts from it most interesting
to English history. -
First, We learn that the family of JACK KETCH competes with the
BEDForps, and Norfolks, and NoFTHUMBERLANDs, &c, &c. -
Secondly, That JACK KETCH has created a nobility for himself with
the British mob.
Thirdly, That the banks of the Thames are always foggy.
Fourthly, That we Englishmen revel in gloomy ideas, and that every
Anglais is in heart a lugubrious fellow, who makes a cemetery his play-
ground, and MIss JACK KETCH his playfellow. -
Fifthly, That English bankers and English Ministers, carrying out
this national taste, are apt to prowl about Newgate, and wait in
ambush round the corner of Horsemonger Lane, with the view of
meeting the lovely daughter of the public executioner.
Sirthly, That members of the royal family are not too proud to
follow in this English pastime. It is a thousand pities Mons. RABOU
never mentions the name of the royal prince who wanted so madly to
elope with Miss JACK KETCH, for it would make a very valuable illus:
tration for the next edition of MR. CHARLEs KNIGHT's “Pictorial
History of England.” It could never have been JAMEs? -
º the bye, what an amusing book it would make—“The History of
England, written by a Frenchman P. When we have nothing to do,
we will write it ourselves, just “for the ſun of the thing.”
POMPEY AND CAESAR IN AMERICA.
THE Times, in allusion to an anticipated state of anarchy in the
American Union, says—“Such are just the times for a MARIUs or a
SYLLA, a Pompey or a CAESAR.” There is really something ominous in
our contemporary’s remark.
The American Republic may not have much to fear from a SYLLA
or a MARIUS, but JonATHAN may well entertain a pretty considerable
apprehension of a CAESAR or a PQMPEy, Thanks to the institution of
Slavery, the United States already produce, Pompeys, and CAEsARs in
abundance. There is a black spot in the American horizon, which is
daily growing bigger and blacker. The Black Republicans may prove
as troublesome in the States as the Red have been in other quarters;
and, should they acquire the upper hand, there is no knowing to what
a pitch the blackness of Transatlantic affairs may grow. At present,
GENERAL TAYLOR and MARTIN WAN BUREN are contesting the Presi.
dency; but we may live to see the American Dictatorship, the bone of
contention between Pom PEY and CAESAR.
Bourbon Liberality.
THEY write from Naples— -
“A Neapolitan steamer left for Sicily on the 23rd (ult.) with fresh supplies of
bomb-shells.”
Thus the KING of NAPLEs supplies his subjects with bombshells, as a
conscientious egg-wife supplies her customers—namely, with the com-
modity fresh and fresh.
MODEST MERIT.
55T WE, have long come to the conclusion
º; that “Modest Merit” is one of the worst
o o oſ. specs. in the world, and that a dumb
waiter upon fortune . wait long
enough, unless he will speak up for him-
self and proclaim his own deserts to an
indiscriminating public. We are afraid
that the NELson Monument in Trafalgar
uare owes at least half the contempt of
- which it is the object to its omission to
Mºſ: proclaim its own value, or rather, its own
cost, to the passing stranger. We
recollect hearing of a person who, by way
of advertising his literary achievements
to the world, hung a placard about his
neck, inscribed with the words, “The
author of a hundred pieces,” and thus
labelled, he obtained not only, publicity
for his books, but occasionally a few
THE Col.U.M N - -
- odd coppers for his dinner.
º ; : ºt We think this system might be applied
23.000 zł. with success to some of the monuments
about town, which the public do not
appreciate. The NELson Column, for
example, would never be suspected of
having run through £23,000—to say
à
:
nothing of the amount of capital expended
| on its top; and those precious stones at
the base do not bear the appearance of
having cost close upon £4000-two little
facts that ought to be notified by having
- the component parts of the column duly
| := ticketed. The Lions, who are daily ex-
= pected from the mason's menagerie, where
T if they are, only waiting, to have the last
HESE STEFIſ) º; -blow of the mallet on their noses, and the
§§. final chiselling out of the whites of their
- eyes, will never look like their worth–
or rather their price—of £3000, unless
means are taken to state the fact by
hanging a copy of the bill and receipt round the neck of each of them,
to the ginger-beer fountains, we should recommend their being
decked out with one of the old familiar
haberdashery puffs, inscribed “Look [**** as “”
here ! Alarming Sacrifice!” which will L rouſ f.3000]
be more expressive than naming any "Tº -
actual amount as the price paid for their
erection.
The National Gallery buildings should
be ticketed en masse, as “All these at"
—whatever the figure may be which
the nation has paid for them. The statue
of the DUKE of WELLLINGTON at the
Royal Exchange should be decorated, like the bread when it has risen
with the words “Up again!” and the price, whatever it may be, should
be added in very large capitals.
A Slight Contradiction.
º P. R. JAMEs published, last year, a Book called The Last of
agrºes.
This year again he has published another Book full of Fairies.
This is the worst of JAMEs—he is determined you shall never hear
the last of him.
SABBATH LOLLIPOPS.
THE REv. W. S. BRICKNELL of Easham, Oxfordshire, has fined a
fruiterer, named BARTON, in the penalty of 5s. for that—in his absence
—his daughter, a child of nine years old, did on the Sunday, instigated
by the enemy of man, serve another child of the like mature years
with lollipops to the amount of one halfpenny. It is really delicious, in
these days of laxity, to find clergymen so apostolically precise! It is
no less gratifying to know that such sweet single-mindedness on the
part of a divine, meets with its appropriate reward. For we have
heard that a meeting is to be convened at Easham, for the purpose of
voting a piece of Art to the REv. W. S. BRICKNELL, commemorative
of the lollipops, and the offending children. The substance of the
Testimonial will be neither gold nor silver, but the hardest hard-bake;

SoME of the Shopkeepers of London, who rely upon the external
singularity of their establishments to attract customers, are in despair
at the difficulty they find
in hitting, upon, something
new for their shop fronts.
Original ideas seem to be
exhausted, and the old
ideas no longer take effect.

suring some four or five
yards square, dangle in vain
from the upper stories of
tinware º and
red or yellow, golden or

equally to no purpose on
the outside of their owners' doors. Idle are now the efforts to obtain
custom by carrying the shop front into the second story, and turning
the house—not exactly out of win-
º dow—but into one window; for all
º () this only serves to make more con-
- - | || il spicuous the smash that frequently
ensues. The cry is still for more
novelty in the shop fronts; and we
s considerately add a few specimens
from that best of all Schools of

MORAL FOR CONSPIRATORS,
It is well that conspirators of the CUFFEY stamp should know that
the only approvers they can expect to meet with are such gentlemen as
MR. Powell.
PHYSIC FOR THE “ MORNING POST.”
As the winter Medical Sessions are now commencing at the various
London Hospitals, we recommend our contemporary the Morning Post
to enter himself aſ one of them, for the purpose of acquiring a little
pathological knowledge, which, when he next adventures, to decry
sanitary reform, may perhaps prevent him from committing himself in
the manner following:—
“In London there are many slaughter-houses, the air of which is most offensive.
The effluvium they send forth is sufficient to give character to a neighbourhood,
being far too strong for the endurance of gentility. None of our readers may have
seen the interior of these obnoxious dens, but within them may be beheld a race of
beings neither undersized nor weakly. The fellows are huge of frame, and in the
tainted atmosphere they appear to thrive, actually growing fat and full ºf blood.
The men may be said to be too full of health; for, seized with illness, their disorders
have a tendency to run into inflammation, which cannot be reduced. ...The same,
but in a milder degree, is witnessed in the butcher, who, though he lives where
flesh abounds, nevertheless displays a bulky body and a ruddy face.”
What our friend of the Post means to inſer, we presume, is that these
“fellows” live and thrive amid filth, as eels do in mud, and are, like
eels, uninjured by it because used to it. According to him, being “fat
and full of blood,” they partake of the quality of the atmosphere they
inhale, which is “far too strong for the endurance of gentility.” But
our philosopher argues that, they are “too full of health; for, seized
with illness, their disorders have a tendency to run into inflammation,
which cannot be reduced.” If he will consult the requisite authoriti
he will find that the end of healthy inflammation is what is term
"resolution,” which means, simply, subsidence, or getting well of
itself. It is well known that if a slaughterman scratches his finger he
is very likely to be attacked with fatal erysipelas, or, as the Post says,
“inflammation which cannot be reduced.” And as the acute DR. JEN-
KINs himself adds, “the same, but in a milder degree, is witn m
the butcher.”. Exactly so. Atmosphere less foul, disease less malig-
nant. Why, the Doctor himself establishes the ratio existing between
foºtors and festers. It is not often we are thus scientific, not to say
unsavoury;, but really we should feel that we were deserting our Post
had we neglected to rectify the very erroneous medical views advanced
by the journal in question.
BOTTLED CLIMATES.
AMONG the triumphs or alleged triumphs of modern science, is the
effecting of a change of climate through the medium of a respirator, by
means of which it is professed that the air of the “balmy South” may
be inhaled at pleasure, and the draughts of the blustering Boreas be
rejected in favour of a soft Italian air, or any otherspecies of atmosphere
that may be desired. If this can really be achieved, we may expect to
be soon choosing our climates as we do our wines, and, with respirators
on our mouths, discussing the merits of a fine old dry Neapolitan
Zephyr, or a rich full-flavoured and fruity Florentine breeze, including
beeswing fresh from the bee, to give a sharpness—a sort of agro dolce-
to the luscious flowery flavour of the composition.
It will indeed be luxury to be enabled to get our “change of air”
without going abroad for it, but to have it sent home to our own
homes in pints or quarts, so that we may sip it after dinner, and in the
middle of crowded London breathe the soft atmosphere of Italy.
At dinner parties the respirators will take the place of the wine-
glasses, and the guests, instead of being invited to partake of cham-
pagne, sherry, or hock, will be asked what they think of the gust
recently imported from Genoa-of which the host has just received a
few dozen—or they will be entreated to “put that away, and try
another climate.” e shall behaving “sample hampers ºf sirocco”
advertised, and consignments of “fine old crusted monsoon” announced
in the newspapers. We long for the time when bottled climates will
be as common as bottled ports, and the air of Madeira may be had, like
its wine, at so much per }.
THE ENRAGED MUSICLAN.
THERE is a sing-song tune which has for some months past been so
continually squalled, bawled, drawled, ground, fiddled, drummed, and
otherwise dinned into our ears, that it has a last put us into such a
rage, that we have set upon it, and picked it to pieces. º:
blister upon our organ of music is called Jeannette and Jeannot, of
which, having reduced it to its component smithereens, we here present
an analysis to our readers. It cºnsists, in nearly º proportions, of
When we went out a Gipsying, The Fine Old English Gentleman, and
John Anderson my Jo; with about half a bar of the Soldier's Tear and a
cadence from the Return of the Admiral; exhibiting, besides, a distinct
trace of Lucy Neal. We can bear this strain upon our phil onle
nerves no longer, and we beg all small children, organ-grinders, and
other offenders, to take notice that we desire that the nuisance may no
more be repeated.

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE FOURTH.
PROGRESS OF THE CONSTITUTION UNDER THE THIRD AND FOURTH
EDWARDS AND Henry The Fourth—the Origin or election
CONTEST8 CAREFULLY CONSIDERED–THE WAR OF THE ROSES A
THORN IN ENGLAND's SIDE IN THE DAYS OF HENRY THE FIFTH
AND HENRY THE SIXTH,
IF we might be allowed to compare
our incomparable Constitution to
anything at all, we should liken it to
the American Aloe, which, though
always vigorously alive, condescends
to blossom only once or so in a hun-
dred years, when it yields something
like a Magna Charta, a glorious
Revolution of 1688, or a Reform
Bill. The last of these we have had
in our own day, and we must rest,
therefore, satisfied until the 20th
century, when we may expect the
British Constitution to blow again
with some new flower for John
BULL to wear the usual time in
the national button-hole. Magna
Charta was the first great contribution to our select constitutional
flower-show; and though it was long before there was such another full-
blown blossom on the stem, every succeeding reign since the time of
EDWARD THE FIRST has assisted the development of our budding
liberties. The representatives of the nation were now in Parliament;
and though they were only required to furnish subsidies, they used to
smuggle a Petition now and then into the body of the bill by which
they granted the supplies, as Moses and others, in the presentation
copies of their works, blend a solicitation of our custom with the
literary banquet they gratuitously serve up to us.
Though the laws were submitted to the Commons for their assent,
their dissent was never asked, or at all events it was never attended to;
and, with reference to a new Act, to like it or to leave it alone, was the
only option allowed to them. Under EdwarD THE THIRD, however,
they began refusing to acknowledge the laws they had not concurred in
making. But the king and the nobles often flew to the “mean subter-
fuge.” of, “It’s the same concern,” when they turned out, of the
legislative workshop an article that the Commons had had no hand in
the manufacture of. - -
The next step was to claim the privilege of impeaching ministers of
State; and, as sovereigns sometimes found it convenient to favour their
favourites with all the odium justly due to themselves, the liberty of
impeachment was not much ‘...] to. The plan enabled a despotic
monarch to reserve all the g º of success for himself, and to visit
upon his unfortunate tools all the disgrace and punishment that his
failures richly merited. This was the origin of the great doctrine of
Royal Non-responsibility, and the foundation of the maxim, that “The
king can do no wrong;” which, beginning as a fulsome fiction, has
grown into a solemn truth, the impossibility of doing wrong having
gradually been accomplished by the withdrawal of the power of doing
anything. The fact is, that the Executive in this country is like the
hand of a clock, which cannot go otherwise than right, while all the
works are regular in their action; and though the hand of a clock, like
the hand of the State, seems the only thing that moves, it is the most
passive portion of the whole machinery it is connected with. . No one,
however, will deny that the hand is both useful and ornamental in avery
high degree, and that it has its appointed share of duty to go through,
which cannot be well performed without a due sympathy with every
vibration of the ºil. whose ticking may be typified by the voice
of public opinion, and a promptitude in keeping pace with well-
regulated movement—two qualities possessed in an eminent degree by
the illustrious pair of hands that * the present time in England.
Under HENRY THE Fourth, the Commons began the new, and, with
small dunning tradesmen, the now favourite, dodge of waiting for an
answer when they came with their bills, and refusing further supplies
until their demands were satisfied. It may be presumed that now, for
the first time, a seat in Parliament had become an honour worth startin
for, since the Commons had got considerably above the state in ...;
we found them in the days of HENRY THE SEconD, when they used to
be called up in batches of a dozen or so before the Norman King, and
were informed through an interpreter that it was only for the purpose
of emptying their pockets that he desired the pleasure of their company.
It was certainly a very happy and appropriate idea to summon these
poor victims, by writs—for it was equivalent to having a writ, served
upon them, in the familiar sense of that odious term, when they re-
ceived their invitation to the presence of their Sovereign. When
however, the power of selection was placed in the people's hands, and
their representatives began to º: the luxury of having a fling
at the higher powers—for there is nothing so much pleases John BULL
as bullying those above him—then it was that some of those election
scenes may have commenced which have since woven the cabbage-leaf
among the flowers of our Constitution, beaten up the rotten egg with
the purity of election, converted the common cat into the pole-cat by
its constant presence at the poll, and identified gammon with its
since inseparable spinach, by stopping the issue of the former from the
mouth of the candidate with large bunches of the latter, thrown by
those who have his fate, and a vegetable missile, in their hands.
Then it was that the earliest of our English SNOOKSEs began to kiss
our babies, fraternise with our wives, and shake hands with ourselves
to secure our “vote and interest.” From that period may be dated
the birth of that intolerable nuisance, “The Poor Man's Friend,” who
has ever since worried the “Poor Man” almost out of his life, by per-
suading him to feel as miserable and as malignant as possible. Then it
was that the awful option of “MUGGINs and Freedom” or “BUGGINs
and Slavery,” was first offered to our forefathers, who were impressively
informed, that “Now, or Never” was the time, and they firmly believed
it was; though, if they had been asked what “Now” was the time for,
or why “Never” would not be equally convenient, and perhaps rather an
improvement on “Now,” they .# have been quite unable to answer
the question.
Under the Fifth and Sixth HENRIEs there was such a din of arms,
such a clanging of battle-axes against breastplates, and such a rattling
of the marrow-bones of one party against the cleavers of the other, that
nobody could hear himself speak, and the voice of Liberty calling for
changes in the Constitution was either mute or muffled in the miserable
mêlée. . The Wars of the Roses were the pretext for all this to-do, and
both of them were at last so terribly dyed in blood, that if the Red and
White had not been happily united, it would have been difficult to dis-
tinguish one from the other. The partisans of the cabbage had so be-
laboured the adherents of the moss—from whom the famous, moss-
troopers perhaps took their name*—that for thirty years couleur de
rose was suggestive of a state of things very different from that to which
the phrase, in the present day, is applied; and in fact, England beat
|...} almost black and blue in settling the disputed pretensions of
White and Red, as urged by the respective Houses of York and Lan:
caster. It was from the accession of HENRY THE SEVENTH, who grafted
the two Roses on one stem, that the historian of our Constitution
may begin to
“Sing the song of happier days ;”
and, in order to clear his throat for this agreeable vocal effort, he will
| up with a series of AHEMs the interval between this and the ensuing
chapter.
THE FALL AND DECLINE OF REGENT STREET.
If the architect of the Regent Street Colonnade were only alive, how
he would gnash his teeth, to be sure, at seeing the work of destrugtion
that is at present sapping and undermining the beautiful fabric of his
vision, leaving not a stick behind! - -- -
The mistake will be found out, we are afraid, when it is too late to
repair it, and we shall behold Regent Street in its decline, without a
pillar to rest its roofless head upon. We wonder the Woods and Forests
do not take St. Paul's down, and sell it for old bricks, for we have
repeatedly heard shopmen complain that it sadly darkens their drawing;
rooms. But, after all, there is one consolation—let London be disfigured
as much as possible, let things come to the very worst, we shall still
have the National Gallery left us! Three cheers, boys. Hip, hip, hurrah!
* Perhaps—on further consideration—they didn't.

A MOWING EXTRAWAGANZA.
SINCE the new plan of moving houses has come into fashion, persons
who are in the habit of going to the seaside every year, need no longer
be afraid of leaving their property behind them. They will have their
mansions taken up and, carried to the bankers'; where we can imagine
an extravagant scene taking place in a year or two, like the following:—

COUTTS'S BANK.
Enter MR. HuDSON with several hundred porters, carrying on their
shoulders the Albert House.
Clerk. What is that, Sir?
Mr. Hudson. Oh! that is my little mansion; I’m going on the
Qontinent for six weeks, and I want you to take care of it for me till
I come back. ill you be very careful, if you please, and not turn it
upside down?
Clerk...Very sorry indeed, Sir; but our cellars are quite full. We
were obliged to refuse Buckingham Palace this morning, Sir, for want
of room. [Erit MR. HUDson, followed by his House.
THE WEAKER SEX, AND THE WEAKEST POLICE.
. J. WILDE is charged at Clerkenwell with beating ELLEN HARRIs
insensible. The fellow made use of a stone, whirling it about the
woman's head in a handkerchief. The woman was shockingly beaten;
nevertheless, the ruffian was charged only £5 for the damage committed.
This—unfortunately for the dignity of property—he could not pay:
he could not afford the recreation of beating young women's heads
with stones; therefore, as a check to his extravagance, he was con-
demned to two months' .*.*. with hard labour.—A brief
retirement this from the world, for the better contemplation of the
rights of property. . With £5 in his pocket, WILDE would have been
free as a bird, and his fingers undefiled by oakum. However, the
ruffian had committed another crime for which no money could be
received in recompense. He had slightly hit—with the self-same stone
T-the sacred person of a policeman. Upon this, the villain was sen-
tenced to an additional month's captivity, no money being taken by
Justice as golden ointment for the #. of her officers. The moral
of this is: You may beat a woman if #. can afford to pay for it; but
money is of no avail if you smite a policeman. Hence, by a metaphor,
the stone in the ruffian's handkerchief may be considered as the stone
§ Justice, and therefore one of the brightest jewels out of the British
rown.
MEDICAL ADVICE FOR ALDERMEN.
For reasons to which it is unnecessary to allude particularly, it is
very.requisite that all manner of persons, just now, should be very
cautious in their diet. Your serious attention is therefore invited to
the important subject of “What to Eat, Drink, and Avoid.”
Salt, meat and cured fish are very unwholesome; accordingly, your
food should consist much less of bacon than of venison, and much more
of turtle than of red herring, provided you take only a very little turtle
and venison, to which plain joints are preferable. Green vegetables are
pernicious, so that you are not to be condemned to hermit's fare; and
F. as well as inclination, will lead you to eschew all manner of
erbs and roots, except good mealy potatoes. You may safely vary
yºur dietary with hare, partridge, pheasant, grouse, snipe, woodcock,
plover, quail, turkey, turkey pullets, and capons. All these are very
fxcellent things, only it may be as well to observe that they should not
be all taken at the same meal. You are recommended to eat as much
as is good for you, and are at liberty to eat more, if you like.
You need not be afraid of truffles, stewed mushrooms, tourtes, ice-
creams, lobster-salad, Chantilly biscuits, jellies, blanc-mange, º:
trifle, and strawberries, which will not do you the slightest harm—
you will let them alone. -
You may indulge in iced punch after your green fat, if you first take
the slight precaution of it; your will. Otherwise, you had better
stick to good old port and sherry.
The point of clothing is one of great consequence. For the purpose
of protecting the body against atmospheric influences, you will find it
sufficient to devote half the pains to covering the surface which you
have hitherto bestowed on lining the interior. . . . -
You will have observed that the foregoing dietetic precepts contain
no recommendation to avoid fermented liquors. The truth is, that you
must drink something, and every drop of water that you can command
will be required to sluice, and cleanse, and scour your nasty dirty city.
THE HUMBLE PETITION AND REMONSTRANCE
OF THE WERNON GALLERY.
To MR. PUNCH.
WE, the undersigned, being perfectly resigned to our º lot, as
ictures—for instance, to newspaper strictures, which, whether
aily or weekly, we all submit to meekly; tho' it certainly were to
be wished that, if we are to be dished, those who “do” the sauce
and the dressing possessed, besides professing, some knowledge,
however slight, in the subject on which they’re writin'—being also
prepared to endure all processes, whether for cure of horminess,
mildew, or blight, or touching us up to be bright, or toning us
down to be ºf or skinning our natural hull—a process by dealers
called cleaning, (whose effects TrriaN's Bacchus are seen in); in
short, all sorts of excoriation, restoration, lustration, purgation, to
which works that belong to a nation, as to people of private station,
must make up their expectation. So, had nonsense about us been
written, or had we with acids been bitten, or Art-Union engraver
been sittin', to gibbet us all bit by bit in his journal, all “in the
line manner,” we'd ne'er lifted Rebellion's banner in this Revolu-
tion'ry day, and rushed to our Punch, thus to pray his protection,
our sufferings to stay, if but in a “provisional” way. But the fact
is, believe it, oh Punch, even now they’re beginning to “scrunch”
our poor canvasses (truth and no raillery) all into that National
Gallery ! And if he get us all in, with our frames, thick and thin,
EastLAKE will have quite earned his salary. However we are to
be packed, unless, that’s to say, we are stacked like slates, one
a-top of another, till each of us kills his poor brother; or packed—
tho' like brothers we quarrel-like best Yarmouth bloaters in
barrel; or stowed close, with no more regard than tramps in a
“casual ward”—we can't think—in the name of OLD HARRY,
rhaps you would ask MR. BARRY. The Old Masters may stand,
if they like, being treated as bad as poor SMIKE ; but we, true
British Pictures, will strike, and ne'er to High. Art turning
martyrs, submit to such misrable quarters—if “quarters” they be,
says a droll old WILKIE—being surely a “hole,” we hear talk how
they’ll patch up and plaster it, how they'll stucco, and skreen, and
pilaster it; but BARRY will ne'er put a face, we should hope, on
the Nat'nal disgrace. And if BARRY declares he can alter the place
for the better, we say that this Barrytone's base. In a word,
Mr. Punch, we declare here that we, late one WERNoN's, but now
one John BULL's propertie, being works one and all of the best
modern artists, have made up our minds to declare ourselves
Chartists, unless, without any more changing and dodging, we are
found, not in washing, but suitable lodging; and we’ll set up our
Charter—its Six Points to be—
69ne—The National Gallery ceases to be.
Cºnd–Givers of pictures shall see their gifts placed where the works
by the walls shall no more be disgraced.
Cbree—No newspaper writers shall dare to be critics till examined in
(read for the rhyme's sake) asthitics.
Jour-Gil Blas and the Vicar of Hakefield must not furnish subjects,
on pain of the artist’s being shot.
fibe—Art-Unions are humbugs—so are the Trustees of the National
Gallery—both Lords and M.P.'s.
#fr—Each artist may think (and get others as well to think so, if he
can) he's the new RAFFAELLE.
LADIES” FASHIONS FOR IRELAND.
Two spinsters—in correspondence with the rebels—have been com-
mitted to Clonmel Gaol. They wore percussion caps in their hair; no
doubt—with the spinster purpose—of the more readily going off!

LORD BROUGHAM’s PAMPHLET;
In TWELVE DROPS.
E have distilled LoRD BROUGHAM,
to be taken in Punch, and present
to the world the quintessential
properties of the philosopher and
statesman. We purchased A Letter
to LoRD LANs Downe, on the French
Revolution (a very thick and heavy
epistle, price 4s.), and proceeded to
extract the essence. After this
fashion—for Punch has no secrets—
did we catch and hold the volatile
spirit of his Lordship's wisdom.
We first chopped the pamphlet
into pieces about the size of an
alderman's thumb. We then threw
the pieces into a brass skillet, with
a pint of aromatic vinegar—to n
tive the gall-nuts of the writer's ink.
—with a pinch or two of rock-salt,
to supply the saline wants of the
original material. To this we added
a few drops of very old seal oil, with
the smallest touch of mace; stirred
altogether, and placed on a French
charcoal brazier to stew and simmer.
We occasionally fanned the charcoal
with an old wig (turned inside out);
and removed the scum as it rose
with a tea-spoon of QUEEN CARO-
LINE’s pattern.
When the chopped pamphlet was
done to a pulp, and the vinegar reduced to half a gill, we carefully
distilled it; and—in a quarter of a thimbleful of the blackest liquid–
possessed the condensed properties of Lord BROUGHAM's many pages.
We shall proceed to dip a clean new pen into the essence that, when
delivered to our page, shall present the whole of the pamphlet in a few
lines. And we modestly call upon the world to admire our combined
industry and ingenuity. It was, doubtless, held a good trick of magic
to imprison Ariel in a pine-apple (for so we read SHAKSPEARE); but
what was this to the potency of Punch, who wraps up a whole
Brough AM in a º: -- -
We shall now begin our task; prescribing our extracts of BROUGHAM
to be taken in drops.
:§
:-º
H
DROP I.—ENGLISH REFORM, FRENCH RevoluTION.
I brought about the Reform Bill of 1832; I have consequently a clear
right to review the French Barricades of 1848. They refused to make
me a French citizen; I have, therefore—my old and excellent friend,
LANspowNE—I have, therefore, an inalienable privilege to abuse all
French citizens soever.
DRop IL–WULGARITY OF THE REvolution.
The Revolution was effected by unknown Frenchmen; by men who
never had a grandfather. My illustrious friend ARAgo was the solitary
meteor that coruscated among the National Guards. The Revolution
was effected by obscure men, who lighted the fires of rebellion from the
dark-lanthorns of their own reputations. They knew not the modesty
of patience: they had, possibly, never heard of a BRough AM.
DROP III.--THE ENGLISH PREss, AND “PUNch” IN PARTICULAR.
I speak of my own knowledge when I aver that Louis-PHILIPPE was
struck from his throne by the bdton of a miscreant hanging out in
Fleet Street. The illustrious exile may thank the Press, and that
miscreant in particular, that he was hooted from Paris. When Louis-
PHILIPPE was compelled to call himself “MR. SMITH,” the execrable
Punch may be considered his inexorable godfather!
DROP IV.-CRAssiTUDE of THE REvoluTIONISTs.
In 1840, I wrote The Political Philosophy, at once and for ever
settling the destinies of nations. And yet a crass Parisian mob must
throw up, barricades in the very face of that immortal work! The
Royal bed-chambers at the Tuileries and Eu were papered with early
copies of that book, that an illustrious exile—awake and asleep—might
always have its pervading wisdom about him. Nevertheless, with
the work, by no means out of print—I repeat it, by no means out
of print—there is another Revolution Why, what is all human fore:
sight worth P and—I may particularly ask it—what is now the worth of
those two volumes (post 8vo) of my Political Philosophy?
DROP W.—THE FRENCH IRRITATED BY WATERLoo.
The French were made sore by the memory of Waterloo. . The more
crass they. They should have forgotten it. Had I been made a French
citizen, I would have denied the occurrence of such a battle. More: I
would have written a book—two, three, four books if necessary—to
disprove it.
DROP WI-THE FATAL FAULT of Louis-PHILIPPE.
The “illustrious exile” did not sufficiently attend to my advice. I
well remember when I said to him, “Louis, mon cher, I tell you what
you must do; you must put a patch or so upon the Constitution; you
must not appoint all vour Chamber of Deputies out of your placemen.
You have only 250,000 voters in all France. Therefore, mon cher,
extend the franchise; make them—for there is strength in caution, see
myPolitical Philosophy-make them 250,00l.” Had this been done, I
should not, in February last, have embraced an “illustrious exile” at
Claremont.
DROP WIL–WHAT THE FRENCH HAVE LOST.
Half-a-year ago, the French had ample liberty, and some to spare.
They had a wise. Prince, and the inestimable benefit of commerce.
egº: Their capital was º visited by an illustrious foreigner—he had
it in his intention to found a philosophic colony at Cannes—who is now
resolved to pass every vacation in Westmoreland.
DROP WIII.-INCIDENTALLY OF GERMANY.
Speaking of France, I think Germany in a much wºrse condition. A
late fellow.labourer of yours—(my excellent friend)-never had, and
never proposes to have, a country seat in Germany. The Germans are
slower to warm than the French; but iron that takes longest to melt,
takes longest to cool. I fear the imagination, when ongº roused, of the
Germans. I dread the Marseillaise when played with diabolic variations
upon the German flute.
DROP. IX.--THE RULER of FRANCE.
Whoever he is, he must have power. You must not parley with a
mob; bullets they may understand, but not words. Think of the dregs
of the people—(when I was HARRY BROUGHAM the people, of course,
had no dregs)—rising to the top at Neuilly, and overwhelming a king
whose only faults were an excess of mercy and a too great contempt of
money: a man who thought of his country first, of his family next, and
perhaps of his own particular person afterwards.
DROP X.—THE PREss AND THE MULTITUDE.
The Press, to repeat very significant words of mine—“has dome it
all.” A newspaper lives upon untruth. It accidentally—I will allow
as much—prints an error: it is too proud to swallow its words. There-
fore, it goes on swaggering and vomiting forth all sorts of sophistries
that honest men in gowns and wigs drop tears to think of. The Press
ought to be the bread-tree, protecting and supporting all who seek it.
My excellent friend, is it not rather the flaunting poppy, whose poison
creates dreams, and delusions, and idiotcy, and madness? I am, how-
ever, not yet prepared to say that I would destroy the Press, repeal the
invention of printing, and bring in an Act of ğ. that, in its first
clause, hºld swallow up the memory of John GUTTENBURG. I repeat
it: I am not yet prepared for this.
DROP XI.-AN ExhortATION.
And now, my old and excellent friend, let me not conclude without
affording you some consolation. When, from your high position—when
from the Pharos of Place—you look abroad and see the all but universal
storm; when you behold France still heaving from the tempest—
Germany in billowy strife—Italy with uncooled lava–Sicily bubbling
liquid sulphur-when you behold all this, be not dismayed.
DROP XII.--THE REMEDY.
There is a man who is intimate with France, and can still her waves
into a duck-pond—who can make the billows of Germany smooth as
the native meerschaum—who can render Italian lava harmless as Italian
maccaroni—and with Sicilian sulphur tip the lucifers of all society for
the diffusion of political knowledge. -
That man—it is a great happiness at the present time to think it—is
still spared us, and he is
Your old and excellent friend,
HENRY BROUGHAM.
DISCOVERING THE LONGITUDE.
The Sea Serpent has been seen again; persons declaring it was
several miles in length. We should no at all wonder if it was a stray
column of one of MR. ANSTEY's speeches, for we know as a fact that
that gentleman has been at sea for a long time.

AN INNOCENT IRISHMAN.
T a time when, unhappily, an innocent Irishman is some-
what of a rarity, it is really pleasing to meet with an
undeniable instance of that character. There was a gentle-
man named.WILLIAM M'CARTHY, who appeared on the trial
of MºMANUs at Clonmel, as a witness, in which capacity
he established an indubitable claim to the appellation in fi
question. MR. M'CARTHY was examined by the SoLICITOR-GENERAL.
We borrow from the Times a little of his remarkable testimony:-
“Did you see any men about the door with a pike –A pike! What's that ?
I would not know a pike. (A laugh.)” -
No doubt he would not if he could help it.
it. would you not know one if you saw it?—I never saw one, to know it, in my
e.”
MR. M'CARTHY does not see pikes for the purpose of knowing them,
or remembering anything about them. Probably he is subject to a fit
of hard winking when he looks at pikes.
“Would you know a carving-fork f—Oh! indeed, I might.”
| It will be observed that MR. M'CARTHY speaks in the potential
mood. He might know a carving-fork—but that would depend upon
circumstances.
“Did you see anything in the hands of the people about 3–I saw sticks with them.
“Anything else?--I did.
“What?–Things I heard the people say were pikes. (A laugh.) But I did not
know them at all. (A laugh.)”
The plainness which is proverbially ascribed to a pike-staff by no
means appears to extend to a pike, in the eyes of MR. M'CARTHY.
His ignorance on the subject of weapons in general is equally crass–
indeed he appears to be quite an infant in arms:—
“Would you know the look of a gun ?–Oh! I think I would.”
This is not to be mistaken for “I should think so; ” for mark:—
“Had any of the men you saw guns in their hands 3–0ne had something with the
appearance of a gun in his hand.”
We should like to hear MR. M'CARTHY's description of the “Hall
so brave” of the “Fine Old English Gentleman,” which of course he
would have represented as hung around” with the appearances of
“pikes and guns and bows.” We are indebted, by the way, to the
ne and ready-witted, though, somewhat short-sighted fellow, for a rich
exhibition of genuine old Irish humour; only we should have enjoyed it
better at a minor theatre in a melodrama, than in a Court of Justice on
a trial for High Treason.
Modest and Benevolent.
A Foreign Correspondent of the Morning Post, in the best dove's
milk writes as follows:—
“It is a marvel that fire and flame have not descended from Heaven to sweep
away Frankfort from the face of the earth; it would be well if the hand of man
should supply the deficiency and lay waste the city with fire and sword.”
What if the writer himself came in for a turn at the fire, and a cut of
the sword? Truly, if all cities wherein horrors have been perpetrated
were laid waste with fire, the map of Europe would inevitably have the
appearance of a burnt ironing blanket.
SINK AND THE DEUCE.
A SEAL Engraver, hearing that the Thames so poisoned the atmo-
sphere that it was dangerous to live near it, called it “a first-rate sink

A WOICE FROM “BROMPTON.”
BROMPTON SQUARE is known to be the square of ease to most of the
theatres. A complete company—tragedy, comedy, farce, opera, and a
cut of the ballet-might be recruited in Brompton in less than forty
minutes. Any Manager THESPIs might take a very brief turn with a
van, and fill it. Hence, we are not taken by surprise when “an old
actor” from “Brompton” wheezes to the Morning Post in defence of
the high-priced stars. The “Old Actor”— as if intimately knowing
the lady's arrangements—declares that Miss FAUCIT only expected to
play three nights a-week at £15 per night, when—
“Her salary could amount but to £45 per week, £20 per week more than Miss
O'Neill, eertainly, but considering the high price of provisions, and the scarcity of
leading artistes, ought not to be grumbled at.”
Thus, the prices of Juliet are to vary with the prices of house-lamb,
and Romeos may be expected to “go up” with kidney potatoes!
The subjoined illustration, if not very new, is very happy:—
* Luxuries can always fetch their price. Strawberries and green peas, for instance,
will be greedily sought after and cheerfully purchased at a guinea an ounce and
two guineas a quart. There is but one Miss FAUc1T, one Mas. NishkTT, and one
Hiſtºp-- as there is but one JENNY LIND, one-Gaisi, one ALBoni, and one
Therefore, as KEAN's (not EDMUND's) seedlings are cheerfully
bought at a guinea an ounce, why should not Belvidera fetch, say five
guineas a scream? Marrowfats command two guineas a quart, why not
: Lady Spankers two guineas a laugh? The reasoning is very con-
Cluslwe.
And yet, it may be answered, it is the public who give guineas for
strawberries and greenpeas of Covent Garden salesmen; but the public
will not give guineas to managers for FAUCITs and ANDERsons. Gar-
deners and fruiterers, upon the profits of their commodities, retire into
private opulence. Managers—with their peas and strawberries—go
into the Gazette. One tradesman proceeds to invest in the Bank; the
other rarely gets farther than Basinghall Street.
THE LABOURS OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
HE LABouBs of HERCULEs are ºf to them. Thou-
sands of books are lying about the shelves without a local
habitation—almost without a name. . It will require the aid
of the beneficent fairy in the story, who sorted all the feathers
for the Fair One with the Golden Locks, to put them in
their right places. The national cry of “Register! Re-
gister!” does not apply to our National Library. Valuable gifts
are wasted for the loss of a common Catalogue to record their riches.
Our grandsons, when they have arrived at the age of grandfathers,
may be able to consult the precious volumes we are not likely to see,
for the chance is so faint, that the librarians only laugh, when asked to
bring some unrecorded book, and say, “Will you be kind enough, Sir,
to call this day forty years, and I have no doubt Sir, it will be ready
then for you.” .
... This evil, too, instead of diminishing, accumulates every day; for
it stands to reason, if half-a-dozen books are inscribed only, every week,
and some twelve dozen new ones are published, that the balance must
always be, even if they engaged an extra hand at sixpence an hour,
against the possible completion of this dilatory invisible Catalogue.
Will it be believed that not less than three gentlemen are engaged to
finish this gigantic task * They have asked for assistance, but the
expense was too awful, for it can scarcely be credited that the salaries
of these three gentlemen amount to the ruinous sum of 12s. 6d. per diem
-as much as 4s.2d. each a day! The nation has so many burdens that
it is quite clear it could not bear an additional inscriber put upon it!
Besides, the payment for such services is disproportionably large.
These gentlemen are expected to know eight or ten languages, and
surely sixpence an hour for each language is most handsome remune-
ration. Why, a charwoman is not paid more! A man who bottles wine
scarcely receives higher pay, and surely no one would think of putting
upon the same footing with them one who merely drafts books from one
ledger to ledger, and only scours acres of volumes, to make a stupid
Catalogue ! .
The possession of languages may be a valuable accomplishment, and
ought doubtlessly to be well rewarded; but there is a medium in all
things, and we think a pound a week for a man who knows Sanscrit,
Hebrew, Chinese, and other tongues that are much easier to catch than
Welsh or Scotch, is most liberally remunerated, and we are quite sure
every Whig Minister in his heart agrees with us. It is false to suppose
that the subordinates in all Government situations are underpaid, and
that the Directors and Commissioners get the large salaries. The fact
of as many as three inscribers being engaged upon one Catalogue, when
one would do it just as well with an equal chance of completing it, is a
sufficient contradiction to this absurd delusion, especially when the
large sum they receive every Saturday is taken into consideration.
The Catalogue will be completed in time, there's no doubt of that.
We may not exactly live to see it; but still, we should take courage
from the above facts, and hope that our descendants of the fourth or
fifth generation perhaps * We can fancy, then, the height the
Catalogue will have attained. A separate, Museum will have to be
built to contain it; and if some intelligent bibliopolist wishes, in 2048,
to consult Punch on the Constitution, or any other standard work
of English literature, we can imagine a mountain of huge quartos
* to him by some one of Herculean frame, who comforts
lm Linus :-
Librarian. “You asked to see the Catalogue of the letter P, Sir?
I’m sorry it's not yet completed, Sir, but I’ve brought you all there
is, as far as it goes.” --- -
Depend upon it, the Catalogue of the British Museum is not a work
for one time, but for all ages 1
HECATOMBS OF PORTRAITS.
OUR next-door neighbour over the water, the Charivari, informs us
that portraits of the French Members swarm all over. Paris. One
house, it says, is quite blockheaded with them—the exterior is covered
all over. The house may well hide its face for putting on so bold
a front
It seems there are no less than three editions of these endless
portraits. Now, there are upwards of 900 Members, which only
makes the pretty number of 2700 heads. The most Dantonian Red
Republican could not wish to take off, a greater number; Never did
such a number of patriots put their heads upon the block beforeſ
Imagine having them all hung about your room!. What an ugly view
it would give of Universal Suffrage!...The portraits, we are told, are sº
i.i. that there are not two alike. This makes the collection all
the richer, and is only another proof that no politician is himself
for two days together. However, it must be a festering épingle, to
every Frenchman’s vanity, that his belle France should possess such a
cabbage-garden of portraits, and scarcely one good head amongst them.
We .# recommend vigorous weeding. - -
At all events, France cannot complain of being badly represented-in
the shop-windows.
WRECK OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.
THE Pavilion at Brighton has been called, and very appropriately,
the “Wreck of the Royal George.” Colon EL PAISLEY has offered in
the handsomest manner to blow it up, if the town will only find the
gunpowder; but we believe this offer has for the present been refused,
as the Woods and Forests are in treaty with the proprietors of the
Chinese Collection, it being their intention to turn it into a travelling
caravan. There is no doubt it would draw tremendously—if there is no
gilding or paint spared to make it as showy as possible—as a new vehicle
of attraction. It would be a pity to blow it up; though, as it has never
had anything else all its life, it must be pretty well used to it by this
time. By the by, the title of Pavilion ought to have foretold its fate,
for, not being an English Pavilion, the Brighton Marines, if they had
had any British loyalty about them, might have known it would be sure
to be very quickly pulled down. As it will want a new name when it
vagabondises through the country, drawn by eight cream-coloured
horses, may we be allowed to be its godfather?...The name we would give
at its second christening is one which it is well entitled to, from a lon
intimate connexion with it on the lids of work and snuff-boxes, and
sorts of toys. We would simply call it, “A TRIFIE FROM BRIGHTON.”

“T H E G LAss : " A co MPANI O N To “THE BOTTLE.”
We need not tell the world that we have a hearty contempt for that
paltry spirit of imitation which exists by the adoption, second-hand, of
successful ideas—a sort of trade for which theft and monkeydom com-
bined are the only two qualities requisite. We abhor, therefore, the
mere suspicion of having meanly availed ourselves of GeoRGE CRUIK-
SHANK's genius by hanging our idea of “The Glass” on to his wonderful
conception of “The Bottle.” We were almost as disgusted as the artist
himself could have been when the swarm of paltry plagiarists came out
with their “Pint Pots in Six Plates,” their “Beer Jugs” on stone; and
when a mean caitiff had ac'ually advertised “The Decanter,” we had
very serious thoughts of bringing out, on our own account, “A Tremen-
PLATE I.—The GLAss Discovers to ARABELLA THAT SHE is PRETTY.

Before the Glass she stood and gazed,
Attraction growing stronger;
With her own beauty quite amazed, .
She thought, “A pleasure now l’ve raised,
I'll wait a little longer.”

“There’s a new gown coming, dear,

Her husband angry turned around,
His passion growing stronger,
d cried, “The money can’t be found:
The milliner”—he stamp'd the ground,
dous Stopper,” if somebody had not fortunately cut off “The Decanter” |
prematurely, or perhaps broken the neck of it. We are sure, however,
that the renowned artist will not be angry with us for following up his
great moral lesson of “The Bottle” by a little moral lesson of our own,
under the title of “The Glass,” more particularly when we inform him
that our “Glass” has no connection with the subject of his celebrated
designs, but has reference to a perfectly different article. In accordance
with the prevailing custom, we have put the whole of the papers and
drawings into the hands of our poet, with instructions to “peruse and
settle,” and subsequently to “prepare draught from Pierian spring,”
which he has accomplished in the following highly satisfactory manner.
PLATE III–ARAbella, still devoted to the Glass, had led HERsely

The house, neglected every day,
More wretched grew : he could not stay,
To stand it any longer.

NEW ARCHITECTURAL WORKS.
SHORTLY will be published, a new edition of NASH's Mansions. They
will consist of - - -
1st. The Quadrant, which will be brought out plain, and without
columns, on a much smaller scale, adapted to the tradesman's pocket.
The cuts will be very numerous. Rough specimens, done up in strong
boards, may already be seen in Regent Street. - -
2nd. Buckingham Palace, enlarged to a handsome royal size, and with
a new frontispiece. Nearly complete. - - -
3rd. The Pavilion, at Brighton, greatly reduced in price... This
stupendous work will be brought out in parts, and is expected, if vigo-
rously pushed and well circulated, to extend the author's ſame all over
England. A brick will be sent as a specimen of the building, to any
one who forwards the requisite number of postage stamps. -
4th. To face the above, a portrait of the Architect contemplating his
works. Underneath is the motto, Si monumentum ſ: NoN circumspice.

LA PRESSE EST MORTE ; VIVE LA PRESSE.
RANCE enjoys, since its last Revolution, a most curious
Liberty of the Press, This Liberty seems to be the
Liberty of saying anything that is agreeable to the
Government, and nothing more. The freedom of
thought is allowed to the greatest extent, providing
the National Assembly is most freely praised. One
word of censure, and the poor Editor is called upon by
the President “to excuse the freedom, but will he take
the liberty to walk this way?”—and he is escorted in the
politest manner to Vincennes, or shown into some private apartment,
where he may study at his leisure the profound mysteries of Locke on
the Understanding. In England, “open and advised speaking” is for:
bidden; in France, it is open and advised writing. . In Paris, a journal
is suppressed, the Rédacteur imprisoned, and a whole printing establish-
ment stopped, and perhaps ruined in a day, without the smallest public
resistance or sensation; in London, such an event would almost cause
a Revolution, if Revolutions were not fortunately so unpopular.
Imagine the editor of the Times being carried off to-morrow morning to
the Tower, and Martial Law being proclaimed in Printing-House
Square l_Why, the stoppage of the Bank would scarcely create a greater
panic. The whole country would rush to the rescue, the united Press
would nobly league together and forget their little jealousies in the
defence of their injured brother, and Punch would wield his baſton with
the force of a pocket thunderbolt, and, with his patriotic squeak, cheer
on LoRD DENMAN, and LoBD CAMPBELL, and a host of others who
have stepped from the reporter's gallery on to the Woolsack and the
Bench, to liberate their honourable colleague. But in Paris there is a

HOW NEWSPAPers Are
CATCHING GREY HAIRS.
A LADY who styles herself an épileuse—an artist whom, in the ver-
macular, we may venture to describe as a tweezer—announces, by
advertisement in the Morning Post, that—
“Les personnes qui ont été mal operées peuvent s'addresser a MADAME
F. l'épilation, devenue d'un usage général à
es cheveux blancs étaient contagieux.”
s
Paris, depuis qu'il a €té reconnu que
We really must protest against the fallacious idea that grey hairs are
contagious; a delusion so obviously calculated to deprive venerable
uncles of the caresses and endearments which they have hitherto been
accustomed to—of their vested interests in the blandishments of social
life. MADAME says, that she “se rendra au domicile des dames
qui voudront bien l’honorer de leur conſtance.” We must say that we
cannot honorer MADAME with any confiance whatever in the above state-
ment. Were it credible, it would introduce a new element of discord
into conjugal relations. An elderly fºliº in the position of MA-
RINo FALLERo would have no rest till he had parted with every hair on
his head. Were he to ask, with MARC ANTony—
“What, girl, though grey
Do something mingle with our brown 7"
The answer would be—
“Oh pray,
Go, let the grey be weeded.”
Not only would the cares of matrimony turm us grey; but we should
speedily become absolutely bald; and the husband would soon have
nowhere to hide his head except in the Gentleman's Real, Head of
Hair or Invisible Peruke. No, no; this will never do. It is all very
well to talk of catching heiresses; but as to catching hairs—fiddle-de-
dee! We can only º that where greyness is believed to be conta-
gious, greenness must be decidedly epidemic.

can imagine one or two Ministers ãº ‘La Clöture,” and the
hostile bureau is instantly closed. Its shutters are put to in the name
of Freedom, and its Editor is left in prison to warm himself, as best
he can, with the chilling truth that the French Republic certainly
takes a great deal more Liberty than everit gives. It is perfectly true
that several French papers went to such insane lengths that it was really |
a mercy to lock them up; but still, that is a bad excuse for sealing the
fate of many a respectable journal with the black wax of the Procureur,
and padlocking a number of doors that never exceeded the fair bounds |
of newspaper discussion. However, the Press never dies; it knows no
interregnum, and the very minute it expires, it lives and reigns again.

to be in France, as it is with us, the True Friend of Liberty

iagara, something better might be devised for the extermination of
the musca tribe than these yellow sheets of gum ! To see them dotted
over with the innumerable carcases of these unsuspecting insects is a
Waterloo, which may be a high triumph over our “natural enemies,”
but is decidedly a sight most unpleasant to one's eye, and most un-
comfortable to one's fingers and clothes. Could not the poor flies—
against whom every man's hand, and woman's too, is raised—be killed,
without pain, by Chloroform, or be exterminated wholesale by some
ethereal process P, Surely this is worthy the attention of philanthropists,
º wf, should then be spared these ugly, nasty, blister-looking fly-

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE FIFTH.
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LIBERTIES UNDER HENRY
THE SEVENTH,
E have now reached that point of our
great historical and literary voyage,
at which we overtake, pick up, and
travel with no less illustrious a per-
sonage than Lord JoHN RUssell,
THE SEVENTH.
We have now fairly started in a
parallel line with his Lordship; and
not doubting that we shall find him
an instructive companion, we shall
certainly turn aside to consult him
when we think he can assist us;
and, if we succeed in getting nothing
out of him, it will be his fault—not
ours.
The Roses having “ceased to blow"—or at all events to inflict their
blows upon each other, we find HENRY TUDOR being crowned on the
very field of Bosworth; his throne, a drum; a sword, his sceptre; and
the accompanying globe, to make up the regalia, consisting of what
was rather a novelty at the period—a cannon-ball.
• HENRY TUDOR-or, Two-door, as the name is usually pronounced–
was aware that the illegitimacy of an ancestor placed him, instead of
on the threshold of sovereignty, at least Two-doors off; and he
therefore called a Parliament for the purpose of getting it enacted, that
the Crown, like the hand of the * lady, dreamt about by
the imaginary youth in the song, should
“his, and his only.”
The object of this statute was to let bygones be bygones, and apply the
3. to all the §: legitimate or illegitimate, to the
rown; thus constituting HENRy, as MR. HALLAM terms it, “a new
stock,” and enabling England to hold up its head above the quarrels of
rival dynasties.
The terrific “crumpling of the Roses” had occasioned so much
. to the people, and the opponents of the China had been so fre-
quent { punished for adherence to the Cabbage, or vice versá when the
latter happened to prevail, that the nobles and gentry wished to guard
against similar accidents for the future: “Fi f: it out among your-
selves, gentlemen, as much as you like,” was their implied language to
the various pretenders in posse to the throne, “but don’t let our alle-
giance to one of you to-day become treason to another of you to-morrow,
by any of the ups and downs of your dynasties.” A law was accordingly
passed, to protect from punishment any one serving a king...de facto,
whoever he may be, and as the law still remains in force, it follows that
there would be no penalty for paying allegiance to any scamp who might
seat himself upon the throne, even if it should be JACK Nokes or #.
STILEs; “but happily,” says Common Sense, “against these Stiles
there are impassable barriers.” It may be a nice question, whether a
mere visitor to the House of Lords, who throws himself on to the fauteuil
of Royalty, is entitled to allegiance, as being, de facto, on the throne;
but it is pretty clear that the usurper, if he persevered, would soon be
transferred to his proper—a police—station.
Though our Constitution certainly acquired some vigour under
HENRY THE SEVENTH, it is not so certain that this king did so much
good as those whom we and HALLAM turn up our noses at, as “smat:
terers in history,” have given him credit for. Even the Statute of
Fines, which clipped the Aristocracy's claws, by enabling them to cut
off their own tails, was a mere copy of an Act of RICHARD THE THIRD,
who has been more grievously misrepresented in history, and at the
Theatres Royal, than any other sovereign.
The pocket was always the most sensitive point of the English people;
and HENRY THE SEye NTH having the tact to discover that they would
often give generously twice as much as they would like to have taken
from them against their will, hit upon the happy, idea, when he wanted
money, of leaving it to JoHN BULL's liberality. The cash thus collected
was termed a benevolence voluntarily bestowed; but, in plain language,
the whole thing amounted to nothing more than playing a voluntary on
the national organ of benevolence. This was often done to a very pretty
tune; though, not satisfied with what he obtained in this, manner, he
took to the practice of escheating, which was literally little more than
cheating, as many heirs as he could out of their property, under the
pretext of forfeiture. By these and similar fines, the property of the
nobility became so fine-drawn that their hitherto excessive power was
impaired; but the end was certainly more satisfactory than the means
were respectable.
the author of An Essay on the English
Constitution, from the time of HENRY | :
So avaricious was HENRY THE SEVENTH, that he sold pardons, first,
for what he asked, and secondly, for anything they would, fetch-the
prices varying from £200 to 20s.; but some of our own laws of the
present day are just as bad, since they sell to a
man a pardon for half-killing his wife, as low as
£5, or even for a sum more moderate.
it is usually considered to be the great glory
of HENRY THE SEVENTH's reign, that he res-
trained the power of the Barons, which he some-
times did in the oddest way, as, for example,
by pulling the liveries off the backs of their
servants, or heavily fining their masters for
retaining those badges of early flunkeydom.
This movement on the part of Royalty was
perhaps suited to the times, but in these days,
- ...we should think no great deal of a Reformer
who should vent his indignation on such little matters as velveteen
* |smalls—in which there seems no harm at the first plush—and who
should imagine that by blowing out the powder from
our footmen's brains, or prohibiting us from calving
out our own establishment according to our taste, ºr
inclination, the cause of true liberty could possibly
be advanced. - - - -
Few of the objects of º from livery would
be thankful for any de-livery of the sort; and there is
not one of the richly-caparisoned state-coachmen, from
HER MAJEsty's to the LoRD MAyoR's, but would
scorn the freedom proffered by a hand that would
dash his wig and h his buttons to the ground.
The same “smatterers in history,” towards whom we
and HALLAM have already expressed our joint and -
several disgust, have attributed to HENRY THE SEVENTH the extension of
the powers of the Court of Star Chamber; but the statute supposed to
have had this object, had no connection with the Star Chamber at all.
The Act in question empowered the Chancellor, Treasurer, and
Keeper of the Privy Seal, or any two of them, to call persons before
them for “maintenance, giving of liveries, or other embraceries, untrue
demeanings of sheriffs in making panels, unlawful assemblages, &c, &c.,"
which in these days would seem to be a statute directed against Lºrd
Mayors' Shows, with their attendant paraphernalia of liveries, sheriffs'
panels, and the mobs they usually bring together. - -
The people were certainly indebted to HENRY THE SEVENTH for his
little differences with the nobility, as the antagonism of arbitrary
Monarchy and insolent Aristocracy had the effect of weakening. both
and the Commons were likely to profit, in conformity with the wise old
saw—some of these old saws, by the way, are apt to blind us by throwing
sawdust in our eyes—which tells us that when rogues fall out honest
men have a chance of coming by their own.
º,
THE BEAUTY OF FORGIVENESS!
HER Majesty’s “pardon”—say the papers—has been granted to
John Shelly and WILLIAM Lewis, convicted at the last spring assºs,
Devon, “for attacking, ill-using, and robbing on the highway, MR.
JAMEs' Reddicliffe, yeoman, and sentenced to 15 years' transpºrta-
tion.” The men were too poor to bring witnesses to prove an alibi on
their trial; but this has been subsequently done by the benevolence of
others. Whereupon, after lying in gaol since the spring, they are par-
doned. The fortunate individuals were so overjoyed by such manifestation
of clemency, that they have addressed a letter of thanksgiving tº the
Home Secretary. We are enabled, exclusively, to give a copy of the
epistle. As might be expected, it is written with simplicity—even with
rustic rudeness:– -
* Honoured Sir-We beg to give you our humblest thanks for not
being transported for fifteen years for not ºf not ill-using, and
not robbing MR. REDD1GLIFFE, as was sworn we did. We feel it to be
very kind of you to forgive us for not being, thieves and highwaymen;
but it does somehow strike us, and we must be bold enough tº ask it,
—if you can only forgive º #: being innocent, what sort of mercy
do you show to them as is guilty -
..? We are poor labouring men, but have heard that ‘Mercy is the
brightest jewel in the Crown. All we can say to that is this: when
that jeweſ is made to forgive folks for not doing wrong, the jewel is a
sham; more, like a jack-o'-lantern than a dimond, or a emerald, or
anything of the sort.
“Your humble servants (forgiven for nothing),
“John SHELLY.
“WILLIAM LEWIs.”
These r ignorant men are, of course, not aware that the term
“pardon,” in their case, is but a State fiction...Nevertheless, it may be
a8 ed-Ought the State, under the guise of Mercy, to preach flams to
its illiterate children?
* This is not an idle pun, but a painful sacrifice to the awful rigours of Orthography.

MR. YoUNg's letter to GENERAL NAPIER,
that a twin epistle of similar import would

the very earliest copy of the new dis-
covery. The original was written by a
gentleman holding a high office in
S t H–e, and was sold with
quires of Lord Brough AM's Political
Philosophy, and other waste-paper, to
a distinguished trunk-maker, who has
large literary connexions.
“My DEAR BRough AM,

become a French citizen; at least for the present. The inducement
was at first yery tempting; but as Cºf Mieux would not have half of

In . I did not write to you while the correspondence was
going ºn; but I felt that reason was against your acceptance; though,
certainly on that account I considered you the more likely to acquiesce.
Besides, with {*. various duties, your health, your purse, and your
99mfort, would all have suffered by your attendance at the National

And then, it would have been impossible for you, of all men, to be a

exile' quicker back to Paris than he is likely to go; or than, perhaps,
all things considered, it is desirable he should go. Let us go back to
the 10th of April. -

heard that the Duke of W had stationed troops in the neigh-
bourhood of Kennington Common, was greater than I expected. I

“The Chartists (FEARGUs O'Connor, &c.) bounced a good deal, and
felt assured of success. Throwing up a few barricades would have
brought matters to a crisis; and a week, they–the Chartists—thought,
would have finished the Monarchy. The Special Constables, however,
say that they and the Duke must have succeeded. Thank Goodness
we have been spared the convulsion; but, as a matter of playful specu.

A VISIT TO KEW GARDENS.
From “Our Own Old Lady.”
“You can’t think, Mr. Punch, how thankful I am to you for explaining
to me all about the great Oolite, and his testaceous dispositions, and the
mysteries of Zoology, which, indeed, it is a wonderful thing to think of
the earth, having a crust, all as one as a beefsteak pie, and society, I
suppose, like the steaks, some at the top and some at the bottom, and
I am quite ashamed of my suspicions of the Palae—something—gra-
phical Society, which I’ve no doubt, now, that they take their name from
the Rev. Mr. Paisy, a highly respectable archdeacon of the Étailisiº
Church, and wrote a Natural Theology, and Evidences, showing us the
wonders of nature, which my son has the work, and LoRD BROUGHAM
wrote an edition of it, and he wouldn't countenance anything that wasn't
quite correct, as is well known.
“However, Mr. Punch, what with your explanations about those poor
dear Chelonians, that live like the poor neglected brick-makers among
the London clay (though how it isn't all made into bricks before this,
with the houses they’re building in all directions, I’m sure I can’t think),
and my son's talk out of MR. PALEY about the wonders of the vegetable
world, I said to myself, says I. to think of there being a vegetable
world, and I, fifty-five my last birth-day, and never saw it, and accus-
tomed to greengrocers all my life, for the late dear deceased he wasn't
happy without his two dishes of vegetables regular, so I determined to
pay a visit to this vegetable world, and hearing it was to be seen in
Q. Gardens, I thought I would take, an opportunity this fine weather,
and took the 'bus, accordingly, at Sloane Street, and a very civil con-
ductor he was, with whiskers and a gold band round his hat. Ithought
we never should have got there, and was very near getting out at the
myself and my niece, for I was determined she shouldn't grow up as f
had done, having placed her at an establishment near Turnham Green,
where I made the conductor stop and called for her, and why that old
gentleman next the door did swear so I’m sure I can't think, for we
weren't above ten minutes waiting for JEMIMA.
“Well, Sir, we got to the Gardens where the vegetable world is; and
it’s well I expected to see vegetables, for there isn't no flowers to
signify; but hot-houses upon hot-houses. How the coals are paid for
isn't my business. And such a Conservatory; all made of glass, and
covering I don't know how much ground; all under the care of SIR
WILLIAM HookEY. First, we went into the Conservatory, where
they’ve the poor plants transported from Botany Bay—what for I’m
sure I don't know, but no good, I'll be bound—and very ugly they looked,
set in bush-ranges, which you may have read of, and put in solitary
confinement in tubs, on short allowance of earth.
“But oh, Sir, that Palm-house ! The heat was awful, and the compan
suffered a deal; and it’s little watering them plants want, I’ll be bound.
And all the fanning in the world isn't any use; for the more you ſan,
the hotter you get, for it’s heated up to the topical regions—that is,
the parts about the line, which must be the no-clothes line, where, the
benighted blacks go stark naked. This was the vegetable world. I
wanted to see, where you’ve trees that grow umbrellas and chair-
bottoms, and trees that grow bread equal to hot-rolls, and custards, and
cocoa-nuts, and chocolate, and tea, and coffee, and other groceries, and one
that makes lace, and another that grows sugar and nutmeg and all sorts
of spices, and one that you milk for all the world like a cow, and another
that makes butter, and another that makes pots to put it in: and the
Cabbage Palm, equal to the best savoys, and the Guinea Palm, which
grows the Öil . Palm, which guineas is well known to be; and
there's some, no doubt the Aristocracy, that spend their time
catching flies; and some that carry water; and there’s dwarfs among
'em, and “an Qldest. Inhabitant,’ into the bargain, SIR. W., Hookey
says in his book, which his name is Baobab, and my niece, who draws
sweetly, took the portraits of some of them, ain't they pretty? There
was one little plant I was tempted to put into my reticule—the Paw-
paw—that makes tough meat tender, a great comfort it would be to
one, as none but a housekeeper can know.
“But of all the vegetable world I saw that day, and dear knows I saw
plenty, and almost ſainted among the Palms, there was one dreadful
house in particular, where the Hugh. Forbeses live, and awful plants
they are, like melons, with spikes a sticking out in every direction, and
tickets written up—“Visitors are requested not to touch the plants,’
and they’d better not, for I came on one of the Hugh Forbeses, promis-
cuously, and my shrieks ºf. in three gardeners, very civil young
men, and how they got me off I hardly know, but grateful I was I'd put
on my stout bombazine that morning. And in the same house there's
a heap of little old plants, called the Cereus Senilis in SIR. W. Hookey's
catalogue; and when I asked a gentleman who was civil to me and
JEMIMA what "Serious Senilis” meant, he said it was the Latin for
‘a heavy father,” or serious old man; and serious old men they ma
well be called, for this is what they're like in JEMIMA’s drawing, whic
is the very moral of them, all, covered over with white hair, and little
at you as you walk through, like so many rows of wicked old gentlemen
that never had their hair cut.

Indeed, what with the turn they gave me, and me coming upon that
pumpkin with the spikes in it, I was obliged to 3eave the Gardens
and take the first 'bus back to town, and very glad I was to get out of
the vegetable world, you may be sure; for what with the hot, rooms

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WEGETARLAN MOVEMENT.
WHEN we noticed, a week or two ago, a banquet of vegetables, we
were not aware that a great Vegetarian Movement was going on, with
a vegetarian press, a vegetarian society, a vegetarian boarding-house,
a vegetarian school, two or three vegetarian hotels, a vegetarian
Life Insurance Qffice, vegetarian letter-paper, vegetarian pens, vege-
tarian wafers, and vegetarian envelopes. -
The Wegetarian Advocate has replied to our article on the late
vegetarian banquet, and we must confess that, notwithstanding the
very cholera-inducing diet on which the members of the sect exist, the
answer is by no means of a choleric character. The Wegetarian
Advocate has a delicious vegetable leader, with two or three columns of
provincial intelligence, showing the spread of vegetarian principles.
There are vegetarian missionaries going about the country inculcating
the doctrine of peas and potatoes; and there is a talk of a yesetarian
dining-room, where there is to be ºff. eat but potatoes, plain
and mashed, with puddings and pies in all their tempting variety.
We understand a prize is to be given for the quickest demolition of
the largest quantity of turnips; and a silver medal will be awarded to
the vegetarian who will dispose of one hundred, heads of celery with
the utmost celerity. We sincerely hope the puddings will not get into
the heads of our vegetarian friends, and render them pudding-headed;
but they are evidently in earnest; and, if we are disposed to laugh at
them for their excessive indulgence in rice, we suspect that,
Risum teneatis, amici,
will be the only reply they will make to us.
originAL WEGETARIANS,
THE “ FEAST OF REASON ?” UNIDER EXISTING
CIRCUMSTANCES,
- # questions, “What to Eat, Drink, and
Avoid f" the Board of Health has very judiciously answered the latter
one. A medical correspondent of the Morning Chronicle has undertaken
to reply to the two former, wisely remarking that “The public should
be told not only what to eat but what to consume.” e subjoin the
dietary proposed by this º, who has given our mornin
tºpony something very much better to chronicle than s
eer:-
OF the three grand
“DIET TABLE DURING THE PREVALENCE OF THE EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.
"Baeakfast.—To eat: Bread baked previous day, toasted bread, biscuit, rusk,
with butter; an egg, boiled 34 minutes; mutton chop; cold chicken.—To drink :
tea, coffee, milk and water.
“Dinnea.—Mutton, boiled or roasted; roast beef; eggs, boiled or poached;
boiled or roast fowl; tripe; rabbit; mínced veal ; sago; tapioca; arrowroot;
semºlina; rice; rice-milk; bread; biscuit; light puddings; mealy potatoes.—To
drink : toast-and-water; weak brandy-and-water; bitter ale; sherry-and-water;
porter; stout.
“TEA.—Bread and butter: dry toast : k: plai d - t.- :
coffee; black tea. ; dry toast; rusk; plain seedcake; biscuit.—To drink
"If anything is required for luncheon or supper, it may consist of a few oysters or
a small muttºn chop, with bread. A few glasses of good wine, port, sherry, or
madeira; spiced negus, warm brandy or rum and water maybe taken, with discretion,
during the day.”
Now if the Public should ever die, which of course the British Public
never will, even after stuffing to the extent above prescribed, we will
undertake to write its epitaph, which shall be a slight parody on that
of Queen Katherine upon Cardinal Wolsey- ght parody
“He was a man
Of an unbounded stomach.”
The foregoing bill of fare is, in fact, the programme of a regular
gorge—of as complete and thorough a blow-out as could be desired by
any living creature of gastric capacity inferior to that of an Alderman
or a Boa Constrictor. Such jº might amply satisfy the Sea
Serpent himself. Great as is the gul §§ John BuLL, he has never
yet, we are quite sure, been crammed at this rate. If a licensed jester
may appoint, a licensed victualler, Punch will nominate, the corres-
ondent of the Morning Chronicle to serve the empire in that capacity.
racious!, he will make us absolutely a prize people. Our weight-if
we are to be fed by him—will cause every country in Europe to kick
the beam in the scale of nations. What a pity that this gentleman was
not antecedent to old CoRNARo!... He #: ave saved that patriarch
an immensity of self-denial. Why, there is hardly a luxury that he
forbids except cucumber and green apples. He might have regulated
the habits of Justice Greedy himself, to the entire satisfaction of that
worthy magistrate, curtailing him not a jot of his indulgence in
“the substantials, Sir Giles, the substantials.”
As to ourselves, we will only say that he is the very man that we
should like to ask us to dinner.
Our own dietetic directions may be thus briefly stated:—Eat and
drink as much as, is necessary to satisfy your hunger and thirst, and
avoid everything beyond it. .
One thing, however, we will say. The diet-table of the Medical
Adviser of the Morning Chronicle is eminently calculated for adoption in
Union Workhouses, and is likely to prevent a complaint in those esta.
blishments, which is perhaps even more formidable than the prevalent
epidemic. The best regimen that we have as yet seen prescribed, with
reference to the latter, consists, in its essential element, of that
popular and universally digestible substance—gammon.
WHAT AN IDEA
We see a new work, advertised under the honoured name of S.T.
CoLERIDGE, entitled The Idea of Life. Now, we want to know which
Idea of Life this is ? There are so many Ideas of Life!
There is the Politician's Idea of Life:—a good cry, a quiet con-
stituency, a friendly newspaper, and a permanent º:
There is the Young i. Idea of Life:–pleasant balls, eligible
offers, a good settlement, a place in the Morning Post, and a “fashion-
able circle” to move in.
There is the Man About Town's Idea of Life:—a dog-cart, a cab, and
a park hack, the entrée of the coulisses, tick at a tailor's, a good “tap”
of Haw s, the right club, and a bowing acquaintance with every-
body.
#ere is the Gent's Idea of Life, a vermacular version of the last:-
a seat on a drag to Epsom, a lark with “the ” at the Casino, a
“stunning ” choker, Greenwich Fair rººf. a latch-key, and a
good-natured mother, to stand between her boy and the Governor, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
187
AIDWE RTISEMENT."
TH: YOUNG LADY with the Spaniel, (a real KING CHARLEs) in
pink riband, who bit a GENTLEMAN in the Brixton bus, is IMPLORED
to return her initials and address. As a proof of the advertiser's heartfelt devotion,
THEoDoRE
he gives an instalment of his name.
THE CITY OF LONDON IN IDANGER.
WE offer no § for laying the subjoined letter before the people
of England. Quite the contrary; we expect to be very much thanked
and—metaphysically—embraced for a goodness. The letter—there was
no need of the signature to tell us so much—is written by a female. It
has all the mingled impulsiveness and delicacy of the sex. Here it is:-
“Gracious Goodness! Mr. Punch–Can this be true? Is it possible?
But we live in such times, that whether I am standing upon my head,
or sitting in my chair, I must think before I’m sure! -
“Sir—I am the wife of a citizen of London, of the Skinners'
Company, and therefore may be allowed, to have the interest of the
City close at my heart. Well; I read in the papers, that in that horrid
place of Paris they’re#. to have another dinner: that is, of course
another revolution. The old story; when the cloth’s removed, they
bring in the ’tillery.
“But that’s not all. . paper tells me that “It is added that the
City of Parisintends solemnly’-(very fine words, Mr. Punch)—solemnly
to invite the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, as an acknowledg-
ment of the cordial reception which that City recently gave to the Frenc
National Guards who went to visit it.” And what for, Mr. Punch *
Why, I'll tell you—for I know it; and I’m sure of it.
- "Fis some years—I don’t deny it—since I went to school; but I
think I remember something of MR. PINNock's History of Rome, which
gºt as a prize for a tambour, kettle-holder at Miss BACKBOARD's
establishment at Camberwell. I think I remember how, when Romulus
and REMUs weaned themselves from the wolf-how they set about to
found Rome. Why, they did what the French Parisians propose to do;
they ve a feast, and invited their neighbours.
“Now the French, seeing that they can't govern Paris as they ought
to do, without a Lord Mayor and Aldermen, will take a leaf out of the
book of Rome, and Carry off all our Corporation. For nobody can
i. that when . ve once got our City Legislature-(as m
husband calls 'em)—saſe in Paris, that they } let 'em slip tº:
their fingers home º: No, Mr. Punch, no: I’m certain of it;
if we once let go the Mayor and Aldermen, the 9th of November is set
for ever in this Metropolis of the world (as it is)—is set for ever in
London, only to get up in Paris.
“Or if they should come back—not that they ever would—pretty
lessons they’d bring back with 'em. In a little while we ...iſ have
frogs instead of turtle; and, at the very next Easter Ball, dance
GUILLOTINE Quadrilles, and RoBESPIERRE's Gallopade.
“Now, Mr. Punch, what I propose is this:—Let us accept the invi.
tation of Paris; but instead of sending over our precious or and
Aldermen, let us send their representatives. I mean-Gog and MAGog.
The French will take the compliment every bit the same; and the
wooden giants be quite as useful to the Republic as a Corporation of
flesh and blood; which, being flesh and blood, have wives and families
to look after and consider 'em, one of whom is,
“Your constant reader and admirer,
“THE WIFE OF A CITIZEN AND SKINNER.”
• Punch-to assist the agonised man-inserts his wood-cut; a benevolence on
the part of Punch that must not be used as a precedent.
THE BEAR AND THE BEE-HIVE.
A TRUE FABLE.
THERE was a certain Bear, remarkable for the irritability of his
temper no less than for the sensitiveness of his skin. BRUIN, or
BRough AM, as he was more commonly called, was often tormented by
the attacks of certain Bees, which he provoked by his antics in the
flowery paths of literature, wherein he was accustomed to run riot,
licking everything and everybody with the rough side of his tongue.
Although they could not pierce his hide, so as to penetrate his sense of
shame, yet with their little but sharp stings did they grievously wound
his vanity. At last, unable to endure the smart, he made one desperate
rush at their hive, and thus upset their whole swarm, and, of course,
brought it down about his ears. The exasperated Bees, flying upon
the invader, soon stung him into downright frenzy; and it is said that
the unhappy Bear, in his rage and impatience, tore the skin over his
ears with his own claws, and scratched his very eyes out for vexation.
THE APPLICATION.—When eccentric and wrong-headed persons
incur the animadversions of the journals, they had much better put up
with what they have merited, than, by running a-muck against the
Press at large, draw down the whole body of writers on their unlucky
shoulders. Variation of Æsop.
THE DONKEY-DRIVERS' DINNER.
THERE is, it seems, at Malvern, in Worcestershire, a Society ºf
donkey-drivers, who dine together every year, and fifty of them lately
met together at their annual banquet. A local blacksmith was in the
chair, which causes us to ask with astonishment how it was that...no
M.P. could be found to fill such a very appropriate position? What
was SIBThorp about? Was BoRTHwick otherwise engaged?...or was
LoRD BRough AM too busy in belabouring the Press to show his sym:
pathy with another ill-used class of animals?...The festival went off
extremely well, notwithstanding the absence of those notabilities, whose
connection with the donkey cause would seem to be most natural.
An eloquent Address was spoken by the chairman in proposing “Pros-
perity to the Donkey;” and in a beautiful episode upon the nature of the
beast, its length of ears was assigned as the jº cause of its pro-
verbial longevity. The donkey was well, described as a “creature of
impulse,” for the “creature” requires all sorts of “impulse” to induce
it to go'; and a touching story was told of a faithful animal, who by
refusing to move towards a spot where a highwayman was lying in
wait, had probably, by the mild perseyerance of the ass, saved a master
from ass-ass-ination, This affecting incident drew tears from the eyes
of all present, and the Meeting dissolved in gin-and-water.
THE SCHOOLMASTER WERY MUCH ABROAD,
We must deprecate that glut of classical names for common things,
which threatens shortly to render Latin and Greek as absolutely neges:
sary for our tailors, hair-dressers, ironmongers, and cook-maids, as it is
now for classical tutors at £20 a year, and assistants at the British
Museum at 4s.2d. a day.
Soon, if asked “What’s in a name?” any but a polyglot professor
must confess his iº answer. We broke our. shins over, an
“Anhydrohepseterion,” the other day, which, on knocking up our dead
languages, we discovered to be neither more nor less than a common
steamer for boiling potatoes. Then, in garments we have the Greek
tongue thus misapplied to the British toggery, a great-coat becoming a
Chlamys, when the very merit of a great-coat is not to be º or
anything of the sort; and the Palla Gallica advertisement, has been
repeated till it has positively palled upon us. But if these dead
languages must be galvanized by our tailors, let them at least stick tº
Grammar, and do not let us be at once puzzled by a “Pallium,” and
provoked by a “Pallium tepidus.” . We ought not to stand neuter in

| MISERIES OF AN ONMNIBUS CONDUCTOR.
By A cAD OF TEN YEARs' stanDING.
It isn't pleasant, I can tell yer, to be sus-
pended, like MAHIMET's coughing, 'twixt
eaven and earth all day, come bad wether
come good, come rein, snow, orale. Neither
is it quite haygreable to have a big fist
a-knocking at ye, just as if a gemmeninside
couldn't axyeto stop without breaking the
glass of your silver watch, and robbingye of
your breath. I calls it muffin more nor less
than areg’lar buster; but people imagines,
I really beleave, we have no bowels, 'cos
we’re 'Bus Conductors; thesexperiments
ant pleasant tho’.
There's summat else two that tries us
more ticklarly than another, and that’s a
big bull fresh from Smitheel, and as black
as your hat, which comes behind you, and
sharpens his 2 horns on the soft part of
your 2 calfs, and the pelissman axes you, as cool as Joseph Heyday, if
ye're going to stick there all day? just as if you were a mutton-pie,
and was only made to be tossed for... I can't and won't stand sich
things, that's flat! Again, it quite takes you of your legs when
you’re seased round the waste, and hung
over the door, for all the world like
an osier's Golden Fleas, 'cos an incider is
too proud to tellye to stop. All umbe-
rellas, if I was a 'bus proprietor, should
be put down by act of parleyment.
They’re the newsansees of public wehicles.
Either they’re being lost or miss laid, or
stolen, or they turns the 'businto a water-
ing-cart, or they raises a storm 'twixt two
hoppysight gentlemen, 'specially if one on
'em is Irish with ducks, or else they’re
thrown out of window to hook us and eye
for one don't like it.
I mean to say this, that theſe shoed be
some plan of communikation between the
conductor and his Fair. I don't ax for the Lectric Talygraff—that's
absurd-nºr a bell, much less a chec string, which brings us to
the hold hackney coach, nor a trumpet, but some easy thing that
will tell me what my insides want. How can
I guess what a fellow stuffed at the bottom of the
'bus wishes? And I'm tired of having my leg pulled
off, and the soul tornrooflessly out of my Blucher
whenever its kneedful to “hold hard.”
But no matter; my leg might go, if that was all,
but I do not like my coat being ſugged, as if it
were a º every minit. Its useless soing won's
skirts on, they're sure to come off again the next
day, and a Spenser or a military jacket does not
ook well on a Conductor, for I tried it, and all the
Strand and Cheapside laſted
and I never felt so exposed
or so small since I ran from
Paddington to the Bank. I thought of pinning
“spring guns,” on to my coat tales, and of filling
'em with crackers, or a live badger, but it never
would do; for I’ve jumpt to this conclusion since
I have hopped on and off my Perch for the last
ten ears, and that is, the real badge of our order is
sufferin. All hands are raised agin the 'Bus
Conductor. He never, has a good, word from
º only comes in for the bad sixpences!
I shall go over to France, and get, my guinea a-day like a Gent, by
sitting in the National Assembly. Anythin is betterer than this where
and tare of won's hole eggsistense.
HE CITY SEWERS.–Wanted by the Commissioners of the City Sewers
AN INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN, capable of hearing the Commissioners
rehearse their speeches in private; in order that what they intend to say, they
may say; much inconvenience having arisen, in consequence of their imperfect
delivery. They did not on a late occasion mean to propose that the City Medical
Officer should receive only £150 per annum; they had no such intention: never-
theless, from a confusion of intellect, and their utter disuse to public speaking, it
is very plain that they did say, what by no manner of means soever they did not
mean to say. Wherefore, they would be happy to enter into terms with an intel-
ligent young man to put 'em right for the time to come.-An extremely liberal
Salary given. A knowledge of grammar and stops indispensable.
POISONING MADE DIFFICULT.
In a recent Fº º which appeared in the Times, an unfortunate
woman, named SARAH R1ch, was stated to have been brought before
MR. HAMMILL, at Worship Street, charged with having attempted to
commit suicide with laudanum. The charge was º by the
authorities of the London Hospital, and supported by MR. SAMUEL
BIRCH, House Surgeon to that Institution; not for the purpose of
having the poor creature punished, but with a view to the discourage-
ment of a certain branch of ‘...º. of that part of the art and
mystery of a chemist and druggist which consists of trafficking in death.
The prisoner, it appeared, had bought sixpennyworth of laudanum at
two different shops—the money taken, and no questions asked or
directions given. She had swallowed her fatal bargain, and would have
been lost but for the saving efficacy of the “Purgatory of Suicides”
superintended by Mr. BIRcH.
equid minis, Free Trade doubtless is a very fine thing, but the
best of principles may be ridden to death, as that of Free Trade evi-
dently is, in the permission of the unrestricted sale of poisons. We
would suggest an improvement in the chemico-commercial dialogue as
it stands at present in the drama of life and death: widelicet-
Poor Woman. “Three penn'orth of laudanum. "
*Prentice. “Yes, Ma'am, directly.
Threepence the laudanum—and the bottle is
A penny-fourpence.”
We object both to the º and the answer, but more particularly
to the latter—for which SHAkspeaRE (and what problem has he not
solved?) has supplied the model:—
“Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.”
For “death” read “fine and imprisonment,” and the desideratum will
be obtained. The response will then run somewhat thus:-
"Prentice. “Laudanum, did you say *
where's your prescription It is poison, Ma'am.
we cannot serve it but by warrant, signed
By a physician, or the officer
of Public Health. we really can't indeed,
Under a penalty of fifty pounds,
or of a year's imprisonment.”
We commend this important, alteration in the social drama to the
consideration of our legislative play-wrights; and if they will attend to
it, we feel quite confident that suicide will less frequently occur both in
London and elsewhere; and that much fewer husbands and children
will be poisoned in Essex.
-
THE CITY MEDICAL OFFICER.—A MESS WELL MENDED.
... We rejoice to see that, since the publication of our last Number, the
civic authorities have thought fit to explain that the salary of their
Medical Officer is to be £150 up to January next, and not that sum per
annum. It is not for us to say how far our remarks may or may not
have elicited this verbal explanation—we will not call it change of
intention. But we do feel called upon to complain of the manner in
which we have been dragged before the public by MR. RATHºose, as
originating a report which, if correct, would have been highly scan-
dalous to the City.
If the Court of Common Council will pass resolutions, the plain and
obvious construction of which is to its own disparagement, the blame
of any misconception that may thence arise is clearly to be laid at the
door of the Worshipful Court, and not at that of the Office, 85, Fleet
Street. They proclaimed—
“That this Court do agree with the Commissioners of sewers that it is highly
necessary that a Medical ºfficer be fºrthwith appointed, and that a sum for the
purpose, not exceeding +150, be paid out of the City cash.”
Hence, it might have been naturally inferred that the whole fund for
the remuneration of the officer was £150, and that his º was to
consist of the interest of the money; just £55s, a year. Of this shab-
biness we could not suspect even the City, and we therefore put the
most charitable interpretation on the phraseology of the Common
Council; for which they ought to thank ºn: themselves for
the misapprehension occasioned by their own obscurity. We must beg
to remind the Court of Common Council that though a nominative case
may sometimes be legitimately understood, an essential portion of a
sentence cannot be so without the whole sentence being necessarily
misunderstood.
The next time they vote a man aquarter's salary, we trust that they
will say so, and not lead everybody to suppose that the sum specified
is a year's. We are glad, however, that they have found out their
mistake; and, in the plenitude of our candour, we will not assert that
we do not believe that it was not somewhat worse than a verbal one.
We trust that in future they will be more guarded in their language-
if we may not say, more mindful of their p’s and q's.

THE MONSTER CAB AGE.
Wºº in our funny rival, the Illustrated News, another portrait of
- a Cab. It is always giving us the physiognomy of some new
monster in the Cab line. The last has two horses, which, if
they multiply the speed by two, will make a Hansom almost
equal to a railway engine; which will render it very pleasant if
the speed is accompanied with the same run of accidents. This is
better, however, than the “improved”cab, which you entered through the
roof, and the cab which was over the horse's head, and rose up and
down every time the horse plunged or took a fancy to kicking. The
two horses will be an advance, also, upon the patented cab that was so
near the ground that if a paving-stone was out of its F. you felt a
sudden knock and a violent jolting all over you, and your hat was
turned in a minute into a Gibus, by the roof kindly flattening it into
the requisite shape of a pancake.
- The great success of these new cabs seems to be in the strange
position of the door. It is only requisite to place the door behind #.
cab, or over the wheel, or just above the horses' hoofs, or where a door
was never placed before, to call it “an improved cab,” and to take out
a patent for it Fº We wonder no genius of the JEHu stamp
ever thought of putting the door right underneath the vehicle, so as to
prevent the person being thrown out; but this invention is sure to be
patented soon, for it is the only opening left. But we must not com-
plain; for after all, the surpassing excellence of these cabs consists in
their never arriving at anything. They appear in the Illustrated News,
but are never carried out. They run through all the coffee-houses in
the world inside its columns, and then, as if their journey was completed,
they suddenly pull up, go home, and you never see anything more of
them. They only come out to go in again. The poor things, have
their portraits taken, and then die. Our clever contemporary evidently
wishes to ride over the press as the most complete vehicle of novelty.
It is º; to take its position in the republic of letters as the
Weekly Cabstand of literature.
The Most UNLUCKY MAN IN EUROPE.
. HeNRLQUATRE is reported to have said, before gaining quiet posses-
sion of France, “Paris taut bien une messe”, Louis-Napoleon seems
determined to gain it by the same means, for the end of all his attempts
through life has never been anything else but a “mess.”
FOREIGN GEMS.
THE German correspondent of the Post is, evidently, a terrific fire-
eater. When he writes his letters, he sits upon a pile of cannon-balls,
and writes upon a drum-head. A fusee is burning ; his side, and his
iron * is a short sword split and nibbed for the occasion. He thus
quietly wipes out Vienna:-
“But, perhaps, even while this is being printed, the cannon of JELLAchich has
silenced the joyous hum of the Prater, the band of Staatss and LANNrk, and all
the Students “Lieder;' and now perhaps Vienna is delenda, a heap of ashes, and
well will it be for Germany if it be so.”
He has a mighty mind, this fellow, for the contemplation of a metro-
politan cinder-heap. The Parisian J.ENKINs is, however, of another
kidney; not quite so terrible, and a little more figurative. He speaks
of Louis-Napoleon:-
“The impression is equally prevalent, that if he be elected to the Presidency, he
will but serve as a stepping-stone for the hereditary Monarch of these realms once
more to assume the purple, which has been soiled in the red cauldron of revolution.”
We should expect nothing so shabby from HENRY THE FIFTH.
Surely, should he be called to the throne, it will be worth his while to
be measured for a bran-new piece of velvet: he would hardly wear the
old royal purple, shot with republican red.

ook little fellow! We fear he is a TRUMP that has been
kept too long in hand to be played with much profit. If put
off against THuMB, the cards might have fallenyery differently.
But the Dutch are proverbially a slow people; hence they
only resolved to send their Dutch Dwarf to market when the
go ahead American General had carried off all the kisses
that enlightened English ladies had to bestow upon littleness;
all the watches, and rings, and pencil-cases that the English
Aristocracy (the proverbial patrons of genius) had to vouchsafe upon
insignificance. This is too bad; but so runs the world. For WAN
TRUMP is smaller than Tom THUMB; weighs less; dances as well;
lays at cards, and writes—for so small a hand—a good bold pothook:
efeel for genius out of luck; and therefore make this pathetic appeal
to the Ladies of England—to the British Aristocracy--to give a lift tº
the little Dutchman. Why should ToM THUMP have all the kisses—all

(Signed) “J. BRIEFLEss, President.”
PREFACE.
The substance of this work consists of a series of Lectures, delivered
in the Hall—of his own Chambers—by the author, to various attornies
who have, from time to time, attempted the mean and unprofessional
practice of tendering briefs without the customary fees, and abusing
the clerk—a defenceless urchin—for refusing to take the papers in.
Many of the topics discussed required much firmness—and in two or
three instances a kick—to produce an impression on those who were
addressed. MR. BRIEFLEss has been so frequently invited to repeat
what he has advanced, and he has so often been told he had “better say
that again,” that he has resolved on saying it again, with a good deal
more added to it, in a printed form.
LECTURE I.
SIR,--I shall not waste a moment of the precious time allotted to me
—my chop is getting cold in the inner room—by expatiating on the
conduct of such a fellow as yourself. I have had many opportunities
of observation, and reflection, for there is a speaking-pipe, by which I
hear, and a looking-glass, in which I see what is going on in this room,
and I must say that your attempt to foist that brief, without the usual
quiddam, upon that friendless lad—my clerk—betrays a want of fee and
of feeling which has never been surpassed.
I, Sir, have no merely selfish motives. It was not to aggrandise
myself or my family that I adopted that most honourable of callings,
which is entered upon by a call to the Bar. If my brief-bag is clear,
so is my conscience. In that Court, at least, I have had some practice.
Reſºrt that tribunal I have taken many a verdict—aye, and without
costs |
You will tell me, Sir, that if I have no selfishness, I might have
undertaken your business for you; and you will perhaps refer me to
the old statute, which gives to the meanest pauper the right to com-
mand either your or my gratuitous services to enforce his rights and
redress his wrongs. True, Sir, that the 11th of HENRY 7th, chap. 12,
tells us we are to do this for nothing. But if a pauper came to us with
such an unprofitable retainer, should we not either of us thank him for
nothing, and decline?
You, Sir, are armed with really formidable powers for good or evil.
Your knock at that outer door can raise a hundred hopes, which your
artful, production of a brief can encourage; when º, by your
omission of the usual fee, the nervously excited utter, is suddenl
panic-stricken, and “drops, terrified through the air, thrilling wit
agony into the arms”" of his clerk.
You know, Sir, that we cannot do without you, or at least without
your class. To you we produce the dishonoured bill, the deadly writ, the
“thrice repeated” application for rent, and the “damnably iterated”
railway call. ...When our peace is slain; when our very hearts are
perforated with the very same file upon which the declarations against
us are impaled, when the shaft of calumny, or the shaft of a cab has
wounded us, it is to you that we rush for a vindication of our smarting
honour, or consolation for our smarting limbs.
Am I overstating the case? There is before me a news-boy, who
has just called for the newspaper, and who ought to know something of
the world; there is at my side a beadle, who has called for a Christmas-
box, who ought to know something of me; there is on the landing, a
lamp-lighter, who comes to clean the lamp, and him I ask have I over-
stated the case? I have not Then think, Sir, on the overwhelming
importance of the profession to which you belong. The world is
obliged to take you, but I am not obliged to take your briefs—on trust.
When you write Attorney and Solicitor on your door—in appropriate
brass-you MAY BE CALLED IN AND MUST Act; but if you inscribe
two or three guineas on a brief, and bring it to one of us without the
money, YoU MAY BE or DERED out AND MUST Go!
Language, Sir, is not strong enough adequately to stigmatise the
misconduct of him who rashly rushes into Chambers, where he may do
such irreparable mischief; raising hopes only to be disappointed;
sending the barrister to an untimely cigar; while the next morning,
his clerk brings his grey horse-hair (wig) down in sorrow to the Court.
Let me ask you, Sir, whether you have ever given those matters
a moment's thought P Is it not possible that your not having done so
may be the cause of your not very flourishing condition? Your office
may display “a beggarly account of empty boxes,” perhaps, Sir.
“The world is not your friend, nor the world's law;”
or at least, what law the world may have, you do not get a good slice
of it. That coat, for instance, looks as if it had seen the morrow of ST.
HILARY, had been turnable at All Souls, and was now almost returnable
again! That appearance seems to have been put in—as the song says
—“long, long ago.” Those boots, I perceive, go only—
“Halfway down (or up),
Like those who gather samphire.”
The buttons of your coat hang, like your existence, by a thread, and
your whole aspect bespeaks anything rather than prosperity. Let us
take a glance at your profession, and see whether it is the fault of your-
self, or if it—but the subject is a large one, and my mutton-chop is a
little one. The former will keep, the latter will grow cold, and I will
therefore go and discuss the second, while I reserve the first for future
discussion in this Hall, when your attendance may give me the oppor-
tunity of addressing to you another Lecture.
THE LAST NEW PATHY.
THERE is no end to the
Pathies. We have had
Hydropathy, Homoeopathy,
and nearly every pathy that
the fancy could devise, but
a new pathy has just been
launched, under the title of
Atmo-pathy. The object of
this new discovery is to
cure every disease — no
system stops short of that
in these days—by the appli-
cation of steam. How the
thing is to be dome, we don't exactly know, and we have no very
particular desire to try ; but we
presume the principle involves the
necessity of establishing a steam com-
munication between the patient’s mouth
and a boiler, in some way or other.
If steam comes into fashion, and dis-
charges from a hot vapour cylinder
should supersede the doctor's draught,
the Railway Companies may yet redeem
themselves, by charging high fares for \-
seats on their safety-valves, and other N-
portions of their machinery, where the
full benefit of a good rush of steam
may be enjoyed. Such a little incident
as that of the Cricket explosion will no
longer be regarded as a tremendous
casualty, but as a refreshing shower-
bath, and a seat over the boiler of a steam-packet, with probable
contingencies, will be looked upon as a healthful luxury.
* This beautiful image is taken with most respectful acknowledgment from the
recently published work of a learned brother-in-law of Ma. Baierless on the same
subject as these Lcctures.

AIDWER TISEMENT.
O THE BITTEN GENTLEMAN.—The Young Lady (in a black
velvet bonnet, with an artificial corn-flower and poppy; a puce-flowered
silk, and a black glacée visite, with her dear little dog Chenny in a pink
riband), has, she hopes, better things to think of, than to answer any idle person

ON THE MORAL, SOCIAL, AND PROFESSIONAL
DUTIES OF ATTORNIES AND SOLICITORS.
Delivered in the Hall (of his Chambers) by J. BRIEFLEss, Esq., &c., &c.,
BARRISTER-AT-LAw.
LECTURE II.
SIR,-You have come again, and in a somewhat better spirit; for I
perceive that with that motion-paper, which instructs me to tax the
arithmetical powers of the Court, by that simplest and yet sternest of
rules, a compute, you º: half-a-guinea into the hand of my clerk.
My first Lecture, then, has had some impression upon you, and my second
will, I hope, be equally successful. The sage has told us to “strike the
iron while it is hot.” True. There was no striking you when your
coolness-in coming here without the quiddam—was my amazement
and my disgust.
Let us look at the Law as the map of a country through which you
are about to travel; a map in which many allow too much latitude,
others too much longitude, by going to greater lengths than they ought.
Will you enter this glorious country as one of the mere hewers of wood?
Alas! you had better cut your own stick, than assume this ignoble
character. Would you sink into a mere drawer of water? Believe me,
it is better to let well alone. Draw bills in Chancery, draw declarations,
draw teeth, draw corks, draw—a badger if you will—but never draw
water, for you will get nothing allowed for such a draft,
Many have regarded the Law as incompatible with “the heart that
can feel for another;” but it º opportunities for the exercise of
the best qualities—we all of us have two sorts—of our nature.
. A generous attorney, washing the costs, from the back of a writ,
in tears of sympathy, is a far nobler, spectacle than that of a legal
Shylock, exacting the “pound of flesh” clutched from the shoulder,”
and applying to his victim the Shakspearean query (slightly varied)–
“If I tickle him will he not bleed tº
Not that I would have you indifferent to your great mission; for
you have a high, office to fill, and your office must be filled in some
way or other. The Grecian F. took for his motto, “Action,
action, action;” and it may be *:::::: by you, Sir, to mean action
in the Queen's Bench, action in the Exchequer, and action in the
Common Pleas. But seek not to make business out of the regular
course. In long vacation,
“There's nothing so becomes a Gent., (one, &c.),
As modest stillness and humility;
But when the blast of Term blows in our ears,
Be Foggs and Dodgsons in your fierce deportment.”
The Law is a great engine; and you, Sir, are one of the stokers by
whom the fire must be kept up, that sets us all going. You must
throw in, from time to time, but with an honest and judicious hand, the
coals of litigation; for, as the song beautifully says of love, and why
not of lawyers? that—
it. *: though honest, must still be fed,
or not e'en I could live on flour.”
It is you I mean, of course your class, that must whisper into the
ear of the public, “what, to sue, settle, and avoid.” It is you, that
must gently urge the vacillating plaintiff, or implant in the too yielding
defendant, that dignified spirit of resistance which rouses human nature
into pleading, and you will recollect there can be no successful
demurrer in this instance; for, though neither STEPHENs nor CHITTY
have told you, I venture to tell you, Sir, that—
“Holy Nature never pleads in vain.
Let me guard you against treating every man as, of necessity, a
knave. Trust him till you have reason to do otherwise—until, in fact
you find him out, as I formerly trusted, you, Sir, until I never could
find you at home. But Sir, avoid all connection with rogues, and
be not led away by the card-playing principle, that if you get a
knave into your hands, and will play at beggar my neighbour, your
knave will be a sure card. If I might be allowed to fling the fleeting
flowers of fair facetiousness into the eternal laurel-wreath I am now
twining for my brow, through the medium of these Lectures, I would
say of the knave, “Do not try and make a card of him, but dis-card him
altogether.” -
Human nature, Sir, as we find from HUME-AN'-SMOLLETT, as well as
from every other historian, is a mixture of good and bad. It is the old
story, Sir, of the sugar and the sand; the milk and the chalk-pit; the
port-wine and the sloe-juice; the Bohea and the birch-broom. Man is
the “Mixture as before;” and such, I fear, he will ever remain. Even
you, Sir, are not altogether so black as that bit of stocking_under the
hole in your highlow has been painted. That half-guinea-I hope the
half-sovereign is a good one—is at least a small redeeming point in
your character. I shall cherish this motion-paper as a specimen of the
yery poetry of motion; for the fact of a fee having accompanied it, is
i. enough to invest it with the air of a fiction, a reverie, or a
eam.
But to return, Sir, to human nature. You will frequently see much
of it that is bad. To you will rush Revenge resolved on a writ, Cupidity
crying for a cognovit, and Hatred howling for the heavy artillery of
Chancery. Will you, Sir, become the instrument of their bad passions?
Will you act as the wadding in priming to its muzzle the formidable legal
howitzer? Will your hard heart furnish the flint and steel, or will you
be the emissary of LucIFER, to strike the light that shall kindle these
malignant feelings into a blaze? No, Sir, you had better put an
extinguisher on the earliest spark; or, if the flame is already lighted,
seize the snuffers of benevolence and—do your duty.
You belong, Sir, to a class that must know all our secrets.
we tell our tailor is not the tale to be told to you. The “expected
remittance,” the disappointment of a large sum, the “derangement in
the money market,” the “bad time for selling out,” and all the other
fictions by which we
“Put off, put off, our course we steer,
Put off—whisper low !”
—all these matters of imaginary fact for creditors, are fictions with
which it would be idle to amuse you. Ourselves, our wives, and our
children, whether in arms or out of arms, must go into, your hands.
When our affairs are getting into confusion; when our debts stand in
the relation of three to one to our assets; when we have sixty pounds
to pay and twenty to pay it; and when the frightful truth flashes upon
us, that sixties into twenty won't go—when the same idea flashes on
the brain of the importunate tradesman, and he won't go either—at
least without his money—then it is we fly to you, as Young Norval tells
us that somebody or other did to somebody else—both of whose names
we forget—
“For safety and for succour.”
How horrible if this succour is only rendered by sucking our pockets
will therefore hope for your attendance again—accompanied as you have
been to-day-when I may resume my discourse.
Natural Phenomenon.
THE London milk-consumers have been for the last week expressing
their astonishment at the unusual, thinness of the lacteal, beverage
supplied to them. We have ascertained the cause to consist in the
extreme wetness of the weather, which has so completely saturated
the cows, that the milk has become diluted into little better than
breakfast and tea-tables. The milk has, in fact, most of it found a
watery grave.
The tale

our heads, we should have been so inundated with sky-blue at our

(NAMBY-PAMBYTITLES.
PIECEs of Music seem to be monopolising all the namby-pambyism of
the present period. If we were judged by our songs, we should be the
most loving, affectionate, doting, sentimental, stupid people that ever
existed out of a French romance. There are the Pet Polkas and the
Love Bird Waltzes, and Dost thou love me now as then * and the answer
to it, I do not love thee now one-half as much as then, and we do not
know how many more questions and answers which heart-broken ladies
and gentlemen are continually putting to one another at the piano, in
all the varieties of Flats and Sharps. If the mamby-pambyism only
increases, we shall be having:— -
The Tootsey-Pootsey Polka, dedicated to all the Tootsey-Pootseys in
the United Kingdom:
Tiddledy-iddledy little Tunes for Tiddledy-iddledy little Fingers:

BACCHUS TAKEN ABACK.
A LAw has just come into operation, rendering it a punishable offence
to encourage intemperance; and, if a man may be fined five shillings
for being drunk, the same fine may be imposed on the individual who
helped to make him so. There is an end at once to the trade in
drinking-songs, and this once profitable branch of the poet's business
is for ever cut off. It is now penal to say or sing anything by way of
incitement to
“Push round the bowl.”
§ though it may be doubtful whether it would be punishable to
exclaim-
“A bumper of burgundy fill, fill for me,”
there can be no question that the recommendation to
“Give those who prefer it champagne,”
would bring, the vocalist at once under one of the most stringent
clauses of the new Act of Parliament. Like every other statute,
this.one will, of course, give rise to innumerable questions; and it will
be asked whether the exhortation,
“Drink to me only with thine eyes,”
will be taken to amount to an inducement to drunkenness, since drinking
with the eyes cannot be construed into drinking with the mouth;
though a gentleman with “a wee drap in his e'e” may be in a state
to bring him under the five *: mulct imposed by the magistrate.
As to poor old BAccHus, he will have to resign his jolly godship at
once, and turn his beer-barrel into a water-butt. The teetotallers, in
anticipation of the working of the Act, have added a Royal Humane
Society to their other arrangements, for the }. of preventing

GRATITUDE AND GROUSE.
* MR. PUNCH
“The subjoined paragraph, relative to your unfortunate humble
servant, appeared lately in the Bucks Advertiser:—
“‘His GRAce THE DUKE or BuckINGHAM, who is grouse shooting in Scotland,
a few days since considerately sent a box of grouse to a clergyman and magistrate,
residing near Padbury. The porter's demand of 10s. 6d. for carriage, was, by the
reverend gentleman, considered sufficient to quite spoil the flavour of the Scottish
game, which was in consequence refused; and will, in the order of things, find its
way back to his Grace, in the Highlands.”
“Now, Sir, it is too motorious for me to deny that two years ago,
when His GRAce THE DUKE of BuckINGHAM was lord of Stowe,
and I–why should I mince the matter?—had the run of his princely
cuisine, the smallest donation from his Grace, in the shape of game,
especially if labelled with the ducal autograph, would have been most
thankfully received—the expense of carriage no consideration. Had
he sent me, with his compliments, a single jack-snipe from the utter-
most parts of the earth, I should neither have minded how much its
conveyance cost, nor what state it arrived in. Nay, Sir, if the present
had been a horse, under the denomination of venison, I would, in the
fullest sense of the word, have taken it in, and never looked the gift-
horse in the mouth. I would have joyfully paid the carrier's demand,
and, moreover, I would have given him a quantity of beer, to drink my
own health and that of the Noble Duke withal. But times are changed
now, and that is why, malicious people say, I offered his Grace the
indignity of rejecting his gift for the sake of a paltry half guinea.
“Yes, Sir, times are changed; but it is because they are changed
with me—not, believe me, from any reverse in the fortunes of the
House of Chandos—that I sorrowfully turned away the Duke—repre-
sented by his grouse—from my door. Had I possessed fifty pounds, I
should not have thought it too much for such an addition to my larder,
and such an honour to myself. But extreme poverty is my excuse for
an act which otherwise would have been one of intense meanness. The
fact is, Sir, that I had not 10s. 6d. to bless myself with; much less to
pay for the Duke's game. , Indeed, Mr. Punch, I can assure you—and
you, I know, will credit what I say—that I am positively not worth a
farthing.

MES IMPRESSIONS DE VOYAGE.
BY A GARDE NATIONALE IN LONDON.
HAVE received several letters from
the . Garde Nationale. They are

Sº humour, and end with the pleasant
words, when friends are concerned,
“au revoir.” We select the follow.
ing, as best exhibiting the spite with
which “our natural enemies” now
regard the “perſide Albion.” . It
looks so strange that opposite neigh:
bours, living vis-à-vis like France and
England, should have been until now
in such blind ignorance of one
another. But now that they are
introduced—now that they have the
entrée of each other's houses—we are
sure the two nations will mix more
frequently, and will soon learn how
much pleasanter it is to “drop in”
than to fall out. As for war, when
studied at each other's firesides it
must explode, and be replaced, doubt-
lessly by roasted chesnuts.
Here is the letter, which we have translated as closely as possible.
It is from Monsieur BongAILLARD, a private in the Second Legion,
and is the copy of one addressed to his wife, in the Rue St. Denis —
“My VERY DEAR CLæMENTINE,-Oh, I wish you had been with me;
but only wait—the next time—these devils of English have said as
much, and politeness is the only law which we Frenchmen obey without
the smallest rappel. They have said, “My good fellows (“fellows” means
‘coquins'), you have come alone this time; well, you must bring your
wives with you the next.’, Don't be alarmed; they won’t eat you, my
dear, unless it is with kindness—for I can tell you I am half devoured
myself. If it continues, there will be nothing left of me but my red
epaulettes. You will receive the remains of your poor husband in a
bandbox or a bonbonnière.
“Imagine, my dear, these Anglais do not hate us—I was so astonished.
They took me everywhere by the hand, and were wringing it ever
day from morning to night... I wonder I have a finger left. First of all
it was a shake for myself, then a squeeze for La France; then
another one for myself; then half-a-dozen for the two countries; and a
thousand more—I don't know for what. And when I tell you I felt
a heart in each hand I took, I was stung, with my own meanness
for having ever raised an arm or a cry against them. It does one
good, though, to be convinced in this manner. It is like the feeling I
have had, when we have had a little disagreement together, and one of
us has confessed being in the wrong. You recollect how happy we
were for the reconciliation; and that we were all the better friends for
it afterwards. Well, for the time being, England was you, CLEMENTINE,
—don't be j." I was so pleased for being in the wrong,
and acknowledging my error, that I could have cried for joy. We
French have been fools. We have had friends whom we have treated
for centuries like enemies; but we must make up for lost time. I
am sure myself. I trampled in one day upon the antipathies of a
whole life. I wish all France could have seen with my eyes, and
have felt with my heart, and have known the sweet shame I
experienced for having ever abused these poor English—these
‘good shaps,’ as I called them, CLEMENTINE (shaps” is ‘gueur,” or
rather. “bons enfans')—and I have thanked them, if not in words, at least
in feeling, for having disabused me of all my vulgar prejudices... I return
—if ever I can get away—with another country. Henceforth I am a
native of England, as well as France. Every one of us have been
naturalised by kindness. When you see me, you will embrace un
Anglais, pur sang—and I am sure when you know them, you will not
dislike your dear husband any the less for it.
“Oh! I have drunk so! perhaps a little too much, but I could not
help it. When the heart is too full, it always overflows, I find, into a
tumbler... I have drank, porter–oh! the beautiful porter—you must
come and taste it—and ale, both Scotch and Irish, and every sort of
ale—and wine—and gro d stout—something of everything—but
how could I refuse it? hen one is hemmed in by a circle of glasses,
you are obliged to seize one, if it is only to make an opening to effect
your escape—and the escape. too is so pleasant'. Every fresh! glass I
emptied I felt another prejudice going down with it.
“Oh! the antipathies I have swallowed since I have been here, and
feel all the better for; only I wish it had been the British Channel we had
been .."; for there would not be a drop of it left now. The big
ditch would be dried up, and there would be no difficulty in running
over from one country to another; not that there is any difficulty since
our visit; for I mean to say, every Frenchman in coming over brought a
portable bridge with him in his sac de nuit, which remains behind him,
and hundreds of my countrymen will very quickly pass over this same
bridge, and thousands of Englishmen come over to us by the same means !
“I have no time, Clf. MENTINE, to tell you what I have seen, for, in
fact, I have seen everything, and everything has been so surprisin
about our visit that j I ‘... too many words, too many ideas an
sensations, to express one of them. If I began, I should never end. I
could talk of “ces bons Anglais.” till the dictionary was exhausted, and
your patience also. Suffice it to say, you must come and see for your-
self; and don’t be surprised at my returning home with a whole"regiment
of Horse-guards, or a hundred young men or so, or two or three dozen
families, for really I have given, so many invitations that all Paris, I
think, would not be large enough to quarter them. To º against
any show of inhospitality, therefore, you had better get beds fitted up
in every room, magasin, and loft in our street, and ask our neighbours to
be kind enough to lend us their larders and cellars to feast our new guests.
“We must not allow these “braves’ to outdo us in good cheer.
Henceforth the kitchen shall be our only battle-field, and the batterie
de cuisine the only battery we will point at one another, Ma foi, I
am so hot for the fray, I jºi. like to begin to-morrow. I am burning
to conquer these English with their own weapons. You must help me,
CLEMENTINE, and with our efforts we will turn, in time, the Hôtel des
Invalides into a real Hôtel; no maimed soldiers, but fat cooks; and over
the portico shall be written, “Ici on donne ô manger et à boire.” That’s
my notion of Glory. Anything warm in the stomach, , but a cannon-
ball, tout chaud. Depend upon it, the National Guard has been the
best diplomatists that one country ever sent to another.
“I have said enough; the rest will suffice to fill º our long winter
evenings—when I will charm you, CLEMENTINE, with the wonders of
this wonderful nation of a town; but no wonder will please you so
much, or appear to you half so wonderful as the kindness we have met
with everywhere from everybody in it. Il n'y a plus de ‘bouledogues.’
“Expect me, love, when you see me, but not a post before.
“Your happy husband,
“BongAILLARD.”
*I have such a beautiful penknife for you! I know you will start
with astonishment when you see it—it contains a hundred blades! . I
have also a pair of scissors—such little loves—for ANG#LIQUE, and a
flannel waistcoat for gros papa; and as for JULEs, tell him 1 have got
for him, all snug, a bottle of real English demi-et-demi–the veritable
half-and-half. It will warm his good heart.
“Oh! I must tell you of a ‘toast” I delivered at a grand dinner at
our Hotel, the Red Lion, which made a great fury. I was on my legs,
and said, ‘Messieurs—Burons au rapprochement de l'Angleterre et de
la France; deur nations qui se tiennent si étroitement par la Manche
doinent se tenir aussi par la main.”. It was not bad for me, eh?
CL£MENTINE! but you see I was inspired with the superb Stout, which
is the most delicious, the most—but the remainder of the adjectives
another time.”

We came not upon cannon, but by rail,
The capital of England to invade.
Not conquest, but the love of peaceful trade
And polity to gather, that the tale .
Of British laws and manners may avail

And now we know that, though you have a Queen,
And ranks and orders in your social scale,
Yet Liberty, of the strong sense of right,
Tempered by steady moderation, born,
The growth of ages, paramount in might,
Reigns with the Lion and the Unicorn.

We go, with wisdom gained: of errors shorn.
Irish Food, and Irish Famine.
MR. WHITESIDE, in his i. for the defence of MEAGHER, is
reported to have made the following singularly happy observations:-
“Again, the prisoner stated he had made a “flaming speech' at Cork. The
Attorney-General did not like flaming speeches. But they were nothing uncommon;
they were food and drink to them in Ireland; for the last twenty years the people
had fed on them.”
Exactly so. Not without reason is it that the miserable state of the
Irish #: been referred by some philosophers to the peculiarity of
their diet.

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE SIXTH.
ADVANCES OF THE PEOPLE (PECUNIARY AND OTHERWISE) UNDER
HENRY THE EIGHTH.
ENRY THE EIGHTH commenced his royal career
by
of the late reign, and practising great extor-
tions on his own account; for it was the
policy of that monarch to throw overboard an
7 occasional sprat belonging to his predecessor,
in order to secure a herring for himself.
Even at this early period, our Constitution
had already so far advanced that it was in the
Q power of the humblest individual to rise to
the highest office, and young ToM Wolsey,
who, a few years before, might, have been
seen taking out the meat from his father's º at Ipswich, was able,
in a few years, to exchange, the sheep-hook for the bishop's crook
and the blue serge apron, with a cap of the same material-only in re
—for the cardinal’s s ºuch hat and magnificent lace pinafore. OLSEY,
who was an exceedingly agreeable dog, with a joke always on his
tongue, a song in his throat, and a twinkle in his eye, became an
immense favourite with HENRY, more particularly when, over their
wine and walnuts, the sovereign happening to confess himself hard up
for £800,000, Wolsey, with a confident exclamation of ** dear
fellow, leave it to me,” offered to get it for his royal master. OLSEY
went down to the House one afternoon during the Speakership of SIR
Thomas MoRE, and it was at first proposed not to let him in; but MoRE
who never looked less than on this occasion, suggested, that “the 'd
better see him,” and in he came, tremendous ū. got up,” with a
“numerous train of auxiliaries,” g and melting under the great
seal, the mace, the hat, and al the rest of his official properties.
Wolsey commenced with a violent speech against the King of France,
and hinted that arrangements were in progress for smashing him. It
was “an opportunity for a spirited capitalist to come forward,”
according to Wolsey's account; and “everybody would admit the
money would be well laid out, if the King of France should be well laid
into.” . One of those happy turns having raised that most encouraging
of Parliamentary contributions, “a laugh,” Wolsey ventured to hint
that £800,000 was all that would be required to do the business. The
House became perfectly serious, but uttered not a word; and Wolsey,
though he had heard that “silence gives consent,” saw plainly that
silence was not likely to give the money. Nobody showing symptoms
of a wish to catch the Speaker's eye, SIR THOMAS MoRe apologised
for this dumb show of resistance, intinuating that the appearance of the
Cardinal amongst the Commons had been “a stunner” to their feeble
faculties. The scene ended by Wolsey hurrying out in a regular huff,
his followers hastening P. after him.
... Long debates followed this exorbitant demand, and upon a calculation,
it was said that England had not as much ready money about her as
would pay the £800,000, and at length the Commons proposed a com-
promise of 5s. in the pound, to be forthcoming, by instalments, in four
years—a suggestion that Worse would not listen to." The Cardinal
insisted on “money down;” and looking at the 75 per cent. as “discount
for cash,” he agreed to accept what he contemptuously termed this
apology for a º
The spirit shown by the Commons had had its effect; for the Cardinal,
making up his mind there was nothing to be done in that quarter,
rsuaded HENRY...to refrain for seven years from, summoning a
arliament. The King and the Cardinal proceeded to beg, borrow, or
steal, for the supply of the royal, necessities. Commissioners were
appointed to take a sixth of everybody's everything; and sometimes
an attempt was made to double this exaction by a verbal puzzle, by
taking a sixth twice over on the same articles, and alleging that if
there was six of one, there was half-a-dozen of the other, and that con-
sequently upon both the six and the half-dozen, a sixth would be payable.
Those who were weak in nerves, and slow at arithmetic, yielded to unfortunately
this contemptible “dodge,” though in some parts of the country a
resistance was made; and in Suffolk, where the breath of
erty was not yet extinguished by suffocation, there was an insurrec-
º:
tion of the people. HENRY perceiving that it would not do, dis-
avowed his ster; the Minister disavowed the Commissioners; the
Commissioners disavowed their subordinates; and, as the subordinates
had been most of them killed in the riots, that which had been every-
y’s roguery, ap d to be nobody's roguery, or at all events there
was nobody to be held responsible.
Recourse was now had to the more delicate, but not less decided
swindle, called a Benevolence, the demand for which brought out some
very heroic qualities in a certain alderman of London, who, as alder-
manic heroes are very scarce, we think we ought to immortalise. . This
civic dignitary was one RICHARD REED, who, disdainful of the
ting little restitutions to the victims
popular saying that “a reed must break if it will not bend,” declined
bending or bowing his head to the exacting
#. of HENRY. REED was not one of
those martyrs of whom our own times furnish
an occasional specimen, and whose martyrdom
consists in, refusing to pay a tax," on prin-
ciple,” until a public or a local subscription,
to fifty or a hundred times the amount of the
legal claim, enables them to do so with a
handsome balance in their own favour. REED
was really impelled by a patriotic spirit, and
the tyrant determining that the alderman
should not get off scot-free, sent him off to
fight against the Scots, where the General,
SIR RALPH EweB–"not only an Ewer, but
a base’un,” will be the mental ejaculation of
the reader—had orders to send poor REED
into the thickest of the fight, and expose him”
“to the sharpe disciplyne militar of the
northern wars;”, when, not being half
“sharpe” enough for the “disciplyne,” he fell
into the hands of the enemy.
Considering how much we boast of our ancestors being a liberty-
lowing people, it is surprising how prone they were to assist in
almost * sorts of tyranny by which their own ets were not dipped
into. Perhaps, however, something was gained for freedom by even
this apparent servility; for if the Commons helped the King to stretch
the Rºyal prerogative to an almost unlimited extent, the King gave an
equivalent in the aid he rendered to the assertion of the #. of
Parliament. -
on the occasion of an M.P. having been arrested for debt, and
released by order of the House, HENRY applauded the resolution, and
held it to be a settled point that the Commons were bound.ſo º
nobody but himself; for," thought he to himself, thought he,” “What
will these fellows have left for me if they begin...to entertain absurd
motions of honesty towards their own private creditors?” .
On the whole, the Constitution can scarcely be said to have
advanced much in the reign of HENRY THE EIGHTH; and .We cannºt
agree with Spei MAN, that a fresh joint was added to the British Lion's
tail by the encouragement Parliament received in its own pranks, as
an equivalent for the support it gave to the encroachments of the
monarchy.

of the Railway authorities supplying first-class passengers with the
means of writing

We strongly sus-
ct that the rest-

poser of such an
absurdity, which, if
adopted, would en-
able the noble
HARRY to write

ever he took an

is no reason because
those “who run

those “who ride
should write.”

AN OPERA TO HIS ADVANTAGE.
It strikes us that the new opera of Haydée, or the Secret, must allude
to the secret which Joseph Apy was in the habit of selling to confiding
individuals for a sovereign. But ScRIBE might as well have spelt his
name right; but probably Haydée is very good French for “ADY.”

EALIY in times like the present, when kings are brought into such

good guide to “what to say and how to say it,” in communicating

Cut and Dry º: for Crowned Heads; or Epistles for an Embarrassed
Emperor; or, Little Letters ſº Levanting Lords Paramount. To be

people, as he has long ruled in their hearts. Your sublime attitude
inspires me with confidence, Your rights shall be secured by every
constitutional guarantee, and a universal amnesty granted for political
offences. A king is never so great or so happy as in the bosom of his
people. Abandon your attitude of heroic self-assertion. Return to
your homes, and rest under the shadow of the law which you so much

you, my beloved and heroic people; and do not forget to return to the

Our old friend the Eastern Counties
is, we understand, sadly in want of
sewage for the second-class car-
riages, through which there runs a
sort of open drain, making a perfect
sop-not half so agreeable as a sop

passengers. We should recom-
mend that the º for ascer-
taining the health of the Metro-
polis should be applied to the rail-
ways; for we have heard that the

of the lines, and precautions ought
to be taken to prevent its spreading

mense tract of marshy flooring at a
station we could name, and we trust
an officer of health will be instructed
at once to look to it.

THE BLACKGUARD GRENADIER,
Ana-(with Prelude of “The Rogue's March”). “The British Grenadier.”
Most regiments have some varlet,
Somerascal mean and base,
A stain upon their scarlet,
Their scandal and disgrace;
But of all the arrant scoundrels,
There’s mone for to compare -
With my ah! shame! to the fellow with the name
Of the Blackguard Grenadier!

Their way to Temple Bar,

Two brother men of war,
Two National Guards, come over

Of a Blackguard Grenadier.

he generous French received
As frank fraternization,
And in the sneak believed:
To the Dragon they invited
The knave and his compeer,
There to stand treat, with bounty indiscreet,
To the Blackguard Grenadier.
To pay their shot so duly,
ey gave a coin of gold,
The change for which was truly
Upon the counter told.
This scamp, his lips yet smackin
With the taste of their good cheer,
Made a grab–dash! and pocketed their cash:
Oh! the Blackguard Grenadier!
But, thanks to British justice,
This dirty-thief was sent
To Bridewell, where our trust is
He'll have due punishment.
Andwhen discharged from prison,
His corps, we’re glad to º

HARD NAMES.
A “PLAIN MAN” writes to us,
-- SIR,
“I Have received a regular, plain English education, and I
flatter myself my spelling and pronunciation of our own tongue are
perfect according to WALKER.
“But now-a-days, to help a man to the pronouncing of the names
which fill the Foreign Intelligence columns of the Times, Walker is
“all Walker.” Accustomed as I am to ride in omnibuses and take my
part in the discussion of political events, I am distressed beyond
measure by the distracting uncertainty which prevails as to the names
of many of the heroes of recent revolutions.
“For example Sir, there's the BAN (and by the way, I should like to
know what a Ban” is) JELLAchich, DR. Swish, the principal of the
Establishment where my sons are, (who ought to know) calls him
‘Yellow Cheek;' but Miss Rue, principal of the Establishment where
my daughters are, (who also ought to know), calls him “Jelly Sitch.”
The gentleman whº regularly rides opposite me (believed to be in the
Russian trade) calls him “Hell-a-kick.’ I have also heard the name
spoken with the following variations:–
... Jelly-chick;’ ‘Yeller-shish: “Heller-shick:” “Jelly lick.’
“Now, Sir, you would much ease my mind by telling me which of
the abºve, if any, is correct. Would you take the same opportunity
ºf kindly informing me whether I should pronounce the name written
‘WINDisch-GRATZ, as ‘WINDY-scRatch’ or “Vinder's gastes;”
also, whether ‘Magyah' rhymes to “swagger,” or "fog yer;” also,
whether. HoRNBustle” is a real or nickname; and what, in the
name of PINNock, is a ‘Czech?’ and whetherit is to be sounded
"4eck, or ‘Check,' or “Setch, or ‘D'Jeck,' or “Shek, or ‘Cisies, or
simply like a sneeze: And, while you are about it, any information
as to **** WALLachs, and Slowaks, would be thankfully
received.”
We have laid the above queries before Lond Brougham and Mr.
SILK BucKINGHAM, the only universal geniuses of our acquaintance;
and, when we receive their answers, we shall hasten to relieve our
puzzled correspondent.
PICTORIAL ACTS OF PARLIAMENT.
As it is now certain that mere words are insufficient to express the
intentions of modern legislators (notwithstanding, the liberties taken
with LINDLEY MURRAY, such as making singulars include plurals, mas-
culines, include, feminines, and so on), an intelligent, correspondent
suggests to us that the aid of the Fine Arts might be called in to make
the meaning of the statutes plain and intelligible. This would have the
further advantage of rendering the Acts of the legislature accessible
to that numerous class of the community which cannot read. Illustrating
the Acts of Parliament would also afford much more various employ-
ment to our artists than illustrating the Houses of ditto. We cannot
conceive a finer subject for MR. Cope, for example, to cope with, than
is suggested in this, from the “Removal of
Session:-
“On receipt of such notice by any Commissioners for the drainage, paving, lighting
or cleansing, managing or directing the Police of any city, borough, town, or place,” &c.
Here the artist would be called upon to express pictorially the extra-
* Ing
uisances Act,” of last
ordinary functions of these Commissioners for "
the Police,”—say in two Cartoons; the first thus:-
or
Tººlſ
-
Which represents CoMMIssionER MAYNE administering by main force
to the Force that favourite mixture.so well appreciated by the masses
as “Cream of the Walley” or “Old Tom,” and taken in the form
popularly called “a drain.”
Next, “Cleansing the Police.”
The scene of which might be the Baths and Wash-houses in Gulston
Square; and the great practical lesson of the blessings of bodily
ablution would not be thrown away on our humbler population.
In fact, an immense gallery of great works breaks on our imagination
as we write, to which we may from time to time introduce our readers.
We may thus, also, be opening out to our artists a class of subjects
entirely new, to the utter downfal of Burials of Harold, Finding Body
% ditto, Alfred Burning Cakes, Margaret of Anjou and Robber, King
ºn and Barons, and the other common-places of the Pictorial History
of England.
IRISH RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE,
THE Cork Eraminer relates an accident which occurred on the
Limerick Junction and Tipperary Line, and of which, as it was un-
attended with fatal consequences, we may legitimately take cognizance.
This railway, it seems, consists but of a single pair of rails. Our
contemporary says—
“Whether the Tipperary Train should have waited the arrival of that from
Limerick, or vice pered, we have not learned; but it so happened on Tuesday
morning, that both trains started almost simultaneously frºm their respective
stations, and as a natural consequence came slap-bang one against the other,
about midway on the line. . . . Fortunately, there were no persons in either,
with the exception of the guards and engine-men. . . . The carriages were
completely shattered.”
To start a couple of trains on the same rails in opposite directions,
is a trick which savours strongly of that greenness which is said to be
eculiar to Erin. But what heightens the joke, whilst, on the other
and, it diminishes the seriousness of the affair, is, that there was
nobody in them except the guards and the engine-men. However, the
next time the Tipperary and Limerick Company run opposing trains
upon one line, they will find it a very considerable improvement to have
nobody in them at all.

Day of October, instant, at Ten o'clock in the Forenoon, at the Union workhouse, in

erson (doubtless) has committed
owden Union Board of Guardians,
The Howden District comprises 18 Townships, with an aggregate population
of 6107.
No person can be appointed to the above Office unless he possesses one of the four
following qualifications.
The qualifications enumerated are those which are necessary to con-
stitute a legitimate practitioner. The author of this defamatory
announcement is a deep dog. Had he intended it for a simple piece of
banter—a mere squib-he might have mentioned among the requisites
for the medical-officership of the Howden Union that—
“The candidate—whose time the duties of this plurality of populous
districts will fully occupy-must be prepared to exist on the above-
named salary of £70 per annum.
“He consequently must be a single man, since he obviously should
not have more mouths to feed than his own, his horse's, and that of his
apprentice, who must be his servant of all-work, it being absolutely
impossible that he should maintain any other domestic.
“He must be a vegetarian and teetotaller, as must also his apprentice,
contented with the staff of life and the pure element. He cannot expect
to get bread and cheese too.
“He must be provided with a horse warranted togo—without corn or
beans; as otherwise the animal would eat up his entire salary.
. “It is desirable that he should possess a little independent income,
inasmuch as, inspite of the most economical arrangements, his remune-
ration for the discharge of his arduous duties will very probably leave
him out of pocket.”
But no...The rogue was not a mere satirist. He was maliciously in
earnest. He wanted to fix upon the Howden Board of Guardians the
triness, the shabbiness, the effrontery, insolence, and iniquity of
insulting the medical profession by offering an educated practitioner the

Nevertheless, as enormities very nearly as monstrous as this have
sometimes been perpetrated by Poor Law Guardians, it would be as
well, perhaps, if the Howden gentlemen would just take the trouble to
refute an imputation which would be unspeakably disgraceful to them
if it were true. But here a thought strikes us. The advertisement
may be genuine after all. There may have been a slight erratum in the
specification of the sum. For £70 very likely we shall have to read £700.
POST-OFFICE ROBBERIES.
The present rage for economy vents itself as usual upon those
servants of the public who really do the work, and those unfortunates
—the postmen—who occupy the most ill-paid post under Government,
forwarded by letter, as voluntary contributions of the public to an ill-
Instead of the highwayman's cry of “Stand and

come, you must stand something, or Iwon't deliver you at all.”
Post-office robbery is now such a common occurrence, that to put
* of money into a letter, is equivalent to subscribing it for the
relief of the under-paid postmen of the Metropolis; when our
“vile dross” does not go safe to its destination, we are fully aware
that the mistake has not arisen “by any misdirection,” but by the
letter-carrier having carried things a little too far, and paid more
regard to the spirit than to the letter, in the view he takes of what

SHORT PIPES TO SMOKE.
To please the greatest number, it is not so necessary to say, as to
leave unsaid.
A “scoundrel” is often but an incomplete philosopher, and a
“ruffian” but an unfinished hero.
A person who knows English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish,
is often only able to say a stupid thing in five languages. . .
In so far as it is better to be sordid than ferocious, so far is it better
for a nation to be commercial than martial. -

When a man is called “a successful humbug,” the general feeling is
not so much indignation because he is a humbug, as envy because he is
successful.
Folly is like a Jesuit: it is always being exposed and weakened—and

“It has been universally allowed by most nations, that Science
would be vain if it did not tend to F. happiness, and that that
science is the greatest, by which the greatest amount of happiness
Is prºduced. -
‘I agree with the poet SoLoN in this remark—and if, as I have no
doubt it is one which has also struck the august intelligence of your
Royal Highness—I beg to ask with retiring modesty, what Science
confers greater pleasure than that which I have the honour to profess,
and which has made my name famous throughout the world?
... “Eating is the first business of a man. # his food is unpleasant to
him, his ealth suffers, his labour, is not so productive, his genius
deteriorates, and his progeny dwindles and sickens. A healthy diges-
tion, on the other hand, produces a healthy mind, a clear intellect, a
vigorous family, and a series of inestimable benefits to generations yet
unborn ; and how can you have a good digestion, I ask, without a good
dinner P and how have a good dinner, without knowing how to cook it?
“May it please your Royal Highness Consort of the Imperial Crown of
England, and you ye learned and reverend doctors, proctors, provosts,
gyps, and common sizars of the Royal University of Cambridge, now that
|. are wisely resolved to enlarge the former narrow sphere of know-
edge in which your pupils, move.—I ask you at once, and with
unanimity, to ordain that MY Science be among the new ones to be
taught to the ingenuous youth of England.
“Mine is both a physical and moral science-physical, it acts on the
health ; moral, on #. tempers and tastes of mankind... Under one or
other of these heads, then, it deserves to be taught in the famous Halls
of Cambridge. I demand, and humbly request that, the SQYER
PROFESSORSHIP of Culinarious Science be established without
loss of time. And I ask of your Imperial Highness and the learned
Heads of the University, what knowledge more useful than that which
I * and profess could be conferred upon a rising and ardent
outh
you ho are the young men of Cambridge? They are brought up for
the most part to the study of the Law or the Church.
“Those who have partaken of food in the miserable chambers of the
law student, and seen their cadaverous appearance and unearthy yora-
city, will at once agree with me that they are in a lamentable state as
regards eating. But it is of the other profession which I speak.
“I can conceive now no person so likely to become eminently useful
and beloved as an interesting young ecclesiastic going down to take
ossession of his curacy in a distant and barbarous province, where the
| inhabitants eat their meat raw, their vegetables crude, and know no
difference between a white and a brown sauce.—I say, most, noble
mighty, and learned Sirs, I can conceive of no character more delightf
than a young curate coming into such a district after having graduated
honourably in MY science. He is like SAINT AUGUSTIN, but he bears
a saucepan in his train, and he endears the natives to him and to his
doctrines by a hundred innocent artifices. . In his own humble home-
see my Regenerator art, my kitchen at home-he gives a model of
neatness, propriety, and elegant moderation. He goes from cottage
to cottage, improving the diet of the poor. He flavours the labourer's
soup with simple herbs, and roasts the stalled ox of the squire or farmer
to a turn. e makes tables confortable, which before were sickening;
families are united who once avoided each other, or quarrelled when
they met; health returns, which bad diet had banished from the cot:
tager's home; children flourish and multiply, and as they crowd
| round the simple but invigorating * bless the instructor who has
|taught them to prepare their meal. Ah! honoured Prince, and exalted
gentlemen, what a picture do I draw of clerical influence and parochial
armony! Talk of schools, indeed! I very much doubt whether a
| school-inspector could make a souflé, or S. G. O. of the Times could
toss a pancake
“And ah! gentlemen, what a scene would the examination which I
icture to myself present! The Professor enters the Hall, preceded by
#. casserole bearers; a hundred furnaces are lighted; a hundred elegant
neophytes in white caps, are present behind them, exercising upon the
roasts, the stews, the vegetables, the sweets. A Board of Examiners
is assembled at a table spread with damask, and the exercises of the
young men are carried up to them hot and hot. Who would not be
proud to sit on such a Board, and superintend the endeavours of youth
engaged in such labour? Blushing, the Senior Medallist receives the
Vice-Chancellor's compliment, and is crowned with a fillet by the Yeo:

“And if ever British gratitude should erect a statue to a national
benefactor, I can suppose an image of myself, the FIRST PROFEssor of
CookERY in Cambridge, to be elevated in some conspicuous situation in
after ages, holding out the nectar which he discovered, and the sauce
with which he endowed the beloved country into which he came.

GEMS OF THE “HUE AND CRY.”
THE Hue and Cry has struck out quite a new vein, of humour-so
very peculiar, in fact, that we feel inclined for once to copy it. We
: a few specimens, which we have borrowed, from its amusing
columns :-
“Missing, JANE O'Donrary. She had in her arms two babies and a Guernsey
cow, all black, with red hair, and tortoiseshell combs behind her ears, and large
black spots all down her back, which squints awfully.
*A reward of e5 is offered for the apprehension of Mike O'BarEN, who on Tues-
day last stole the jackass with a pair of corduroy breeches, with blue eyes and a
short pipe, and is very much given to swearing, and has his shoes down at heel.
“Absconded, Phelim, TIMorhy, AAaon, Phil., and PAddy Blake, of Roscommon
Gaol, who broke into the turnpike, and carried off two pounds and six sucking-pigs
in silver and copper, with a canary and a bull-dog, who had frieze-coats dreadfully
given to bad language, and a wheelbarrow that cannot look you in the face without
winking, and ten shillings will be given for each of their apprehensions.
"Lost, a Tom-cat, the property of Miss SANDEas, that was last seen going over
the roofs of the houses in Holly Street, and is supposed to have dropt down one of
the chimnies.”
We may give one or two more next week; and in the meantime we
thank our talented contemporary, the Hue and Cry, for the rich amuse-
ment it has lately afforded us.

To Which JS-ADDED fly's DYNNERE.
Aº the general smash of Continental Crowns, it is comfortable
to feel that every throne is not yet overthrown, and that among
º º still preserved to us, may be numbered the Sovereignty
of the City.
The commencement of a new reign over the Cockney kingdom is
always an event of interest; but in days like these, the elevation of
SIR JAMEs Duke from his Dukedom to the Civic Royalty, is an incident
which we cannot contemplate without such emotion as may be shown
in our shedding of an entire gill of inky tears—not of sorrow but of
sensibility.
The Cockney accession, which happens once a year, adds annually to
those fixtures, which cannot be taken at too high a valuation, by fixing
some new potentate in the affections of the people. The ceremony,
which takes place once in every twelvemonth, may be compared to the
opening of a new Civic Parliament under a new Civic Sovereign; and
the procession to the House—the Mansion House—is a matter of
Fleet-streetian, Cheapsidean, and Ludgate-hillian, if not of absolutely
national interest. The excitement on the occasion of the advent of the
Dukian dynasty may be judged by an advertisement headed-"Wanted
a Window to see the Procession;” which has actually appeared in
one of the newspapers. The happy birth of the PRINCE of WALEs on
Lord Mayor's Day seems to have linked the sovereignties of the East
and West in a bond of real fraternity—much better than that imperſect
substitute in vogue across the Channel—and the throne of St. James's
may be regarded as bound by an honourable alliance with the fauteuil
of Civic Sovereignty.
There are certain things which must be seen to be described; but a
Lord Mayor’s Procession is one of those things that may be described
without being seen; and, as our description is necessarily written
before the event, we proceed to give our particulars, in the style of the
Expresses of the present day, which furnish intelligence of facts so
early, that they have not yet occurred, and unfortunately mar, occa-
sionally, the éclat of a very anticipatory despatch, by never happening.
The following order of the Mayoral procession may, however, be relied
upon; and if any of our daily or other contemporaries give any version,
after seeing the ceremony, different from the account we furnish before
the event can come ºff, our only reply is, their report is wrong and
ours is right; for, to borrow the language of the dealers in cheap but
birchy tea, low-priced but sandy sugar, and economic but
arrow-root, “None other is genuine.”

As the procession passed up the river, it was saluted by a very
minute gun-of the most minute dimensions—as well as by a discharge
of abuse from a discharged porter, who had formerly been in the Grand
Dukal service, but had been dismissed for constantinebriety.
The opening of the Civic Parliament was marked by the usual very
extensive opening of mouths, and several Bills (of fare) were laid upon
the table, which were read a first, second, and third time with scarcely
a dissentient voice. After a superficial audience given to the soup and
fish, the company had the privilege of the entrée, which consisted of
nearly 100 entrées of the most recherché description that culinary inge-
nuity could devise. At the conclusion of the reception, in the course of
which everybody received nearly everything that was handed round,
His Cockney Majesty pronounced the following
SPEECH FROM THE (CIVIC) THRONE –
My Lords AND GENTLEMEN,
In meeting you on this occasion, I am glad to say that my friendly
relations º, my gracious ally, Queen Victoria, are as firm as ever,
and that Temple Bar is, in fact, no bar to the good feeling existing
between us.
I have given orders for the opening of the ports, and I have prepared
a declaratory Act on the subject of the clarets, both of which measures
I hope you will approve. -
I am happy to cultivate the hope that you are, impressed, as on
former occasions, with the grand gastronomic principle, that appetite is
the only legitimate sauce .# a good dinner. - -
I have concluded a treaty with the chef of a celebrated, cuisine, the
papers connected with which treaty will, in the shape of Bills of Fare,
be laid before you at the proper period. -
The Estimates for the Supply have been framed with a due regard to
your powers of demolition; and, having amply discussed, I hope you
will not fail to digest, all that has been submitted to you.
I regret that partial distress has occurred in some remote parts of my
dominions, and I am sorry to hear that a scarcity of provisions occurred
at one of the cross-tables. I have also heard with pain of some dis-
turbances connected with the Cape, in consequence of its substitution
by mistake for Madeira; but I have taken measures that will, I am
convinced, preven: a recurrence of these, or any other similar calamities.
The trifling differences existing between London and Edinburgh, in
respect of the porter of the one, and the ale of the other, have caused
me to try the effect of mediation, which has resulted in the half-and-
half that has already been submitted to your judgment. ...
I can assure you, my Lords and Gentlemen, that nothing shall be
wanting on my part to promote the spread of civilisation; and I hope
you will regard the spread you have partaken of this day, as an earnest
of my good intentions. - -
The speech of his Civic Majesty was loudly cheered, and his reign
may be considered to have opened most auspiciously.
A Natural Mistake.
A NATIONAL Guard was walking into St. Paul's, when he was stopt
for the ordinary twopence. “Qu'est que c'est?” said the astonished
Frenchman. “Twopence,” exclaimed the clerical door-keeper. “Plait-
il?” inquired the Frenchman... “TWOPENCE,” shouted the two-
penny janitor, getting very wrath. After numberless explanations, the
twopence was paid, and the Frenchman walked in. “Hollo! you Sir
you must take your hat off.” No notice was taken, when the enraged
door-keeper ran after the Frenchman, and explained to him very warmly
that he must not walk about with his hat on... “Pardon mille fois,”
said the National Guard, removing his shako, “mais je ne savais pas

WHAT we prophesied a year ago is now being literally fulfilled...We
drew then a most harrowing picture of the Beadle of Regent Street
sitting amongst the Ruins of the Arcade. A most agonising Cut
accompanied our prophecy. Our readers can see both by going as far
back as June 5, 1847. Let them compare our then prophecy with its
present fulfilment, and they will shudder, as we shudder, at tº:
the work of destruction that is going on every minute of the day
amongst those fair pillars of Regent Arcadia. Let this be a lesson to
all who have a turn for prophesying, not to foretell evil things, but
good, Henceforth we shall only prophesy the beauty, not the
rubbish of life; the things to rise, and not the things to fall in the
world. We will prophesy, the Regeneration of Ireland, a Whig
surplus, a real admirer of MR FEARGus O'ConnoR, and other wild,
improbable, out-of-the-way, visionary things; and who knows but what
they may come to pass! May we all live to see the happy day! What
rare old fellows we shall bel
THE STANLEY “STANDARD.”
IF LORD STANLEY were not one of the boldest of men, he would
certainly bind over the Standard to keep the peace. That honey-
mouthed print is very great upon dogs; and, insisting that LoRD
STANLEY has been cruelly barked at by Tray, Blanche, and Sweetheart,
raises his Lordship with unabated severity. The Standard, very
owing, we say, incurs, declares-
“There is not a hungry follower of the Whig camp, not a mongrel cur in the
whole Whig kennel, that is not at this moment gnawing at his character. It is the
old system. We are not sorry it has not been departed from in this instance.
The chosen man of the country cannot permit that country's choice to be insulted
in his person. His loyalty, never questioned by his sovereign, will retributively
approve itself by unmasking the slanderers who dare assail it.’
Now, what is all this about? Simply, about Tom YoUNG’s gossipping
letter, written in veriest idleness—even as Mrs. Gamp, would have
ured her heart out in ink to Betsy Prig. For a fortnight and more
as the Standard lived upon that letter, and, we doubt not, will serve
it up at tea-time, with customary crumpets, any day for a fortnight to
come. The Eraminer, it seems, {j that “LoRD STANLEY was not
the least fervid and determined” of the party in 1832. Whereupon the
Standard, brandishing the Gampian umbrella, exclaims-
“As sure as Jon PAakes and his friend ‘the Secretary’ are well-paid placemen,
so assuredly will Lond STANLEY drag the dark treason into light.”
We confess ourselves set in expectation by the promise. When WAN
AMBURGH showed the Lions in Drury Lane, an old benevolent bald-
headed man took his place unfailingly, every night, in the pit. . And
wherefore? Why, the good creature was assured that “some night”
the Lion would bite off WAN AMBURGH’s head, and the philanthropist
determined not to be absent upon the occasion.
We shall imitate the perseverance of this curious gentleman.
Every night—when Parliament assembles—do we propose to seat
ourselves in the House of Lords; that, as in youthful days, we rejoiced
when the innocent victim at the Coburg dragged the villain of the
melo-drama down to the footlights, so in maturer time we may exult
when LoRD STANLEY drags the Eraminer on the floor of the Lords.
We feel certain of the sight, for we do not see, how the Eraminer
Can : the lordly grasp; unless, indeed, like the wrestlers of old,
it goes oiled.

A SANITARY POLICE.
THE noble art of Self-Defence was never more nobly put into practice
than it is at present, being brought into operation against those
inveterate foes to the human race-Filth and Malaria. We should,
however, suggest that, to -
facilitate the arrangements of
the General Board of Health,
a Sanitary Police Force
should be at once organised.
This corps might be empow-
ered to order the stagnant
pool to move on, and in case
of wful assemblages of
large vegetable bodies, the ſ
sanitary policeman, should || ||
have instructions to take
them up at once without any
other warrant.
We are great enemies to
anything, decidedly inquisi-
torial, but we think it would
not be, altogether unconsti-
tutional to allow a right of search into any receptacle for hot pies where
the inmates are suspected to be in bad odour.
Large crowds of persons in small
houses or single rooms might be
declared illegal, and power should
be given to the sanitary police
to call, upon them to disperse
while the law of arrest should
at once be put in force against
anything in the shape of a pesti-
lential vapour. Open drains, in a
state of open, defiance, under the
very nose of the authorities, ought
at once to be subjected to close
confinement, and the policeman
should at once rush upon the
offensive grating, however gratin
it might prove to his own nas
** Every offensive sty
should be f out of the public eye, an ºl
care should be taken to prevent unlawful \\\ .
assemblages, of the swinish multitude in
thickly-populated neighbourhoods.
The necessary accoutrements for such a
Force as we suggest would be in the first b-
instance somewhat costly, consisting, as
they should do, of a shovel and a box of
disinfecting agents; but we are quite sure
that such a police would protect us against
the most formidable class of thieves, namely,
those that come to rob us of our healt
which we all know is more valuable to us
than our very best set of albata spoons, for
the protection of which we have paid in
police-rate † nine times their original
cost, and are still paying twice their value …a

THE College of Physicians having sent forth some gratuitous advice,
which is well worth its cost, on the subject of Cholera, we hasten to
put it into plain language for the benefit of the community.
Every one is to live extremely well, and no one is, on any account, to
neglect warm clothing, with º coal fire, or any other arrangement
that may be conducive to health and comfort. ..
All persons crowded together in small ill-ventilated houses are re-
commended to take at once more commodious apartments, and those
individuals who are insufficiently clothed must give orders forthwith to
their tailors for taking the necessary measures.
Families not hitherto in the habit of keeping up a good fire in the
winter, through their inability to purchase the fuel, will without delay
take the necessary steps for laying in a stock of coals from their
respective coal merchants; and those who have had meat only once
a week, will give orders for a daily supply in future, to their various
butchers. It being highly expedient not to overtax the strength, those
who feel exhausted by their labour will relinquish their work when
they feel themselves too much debilitated to continue with comfort to
themselves, and they will of course take care to make up in some way
for the deficiency of their wages. These simple suggestions have only
to be followed out with due care by the labouring classes of the com-
munity, in order to mitigate very materially the severity of the Cholera.

| THE NATIONAL CELLAR-IUS.
THE Vermon Gallery has been stowed away, like so much coal or
wood, in a cellar. Art must be going down in our country, when you
have to descend area steps to look for it. The trustees of our National
Gallery have evidently the souls of butlers, and think pictures, like
casks of beer, improve in their drawing when they are kept underground.
Butlers, however, when they go down to the cellar, take eandles with
them. They do see what they are about; but in the Vernon Gallery the
atmosphere is at the best an illuminated fog; and people knock against
one another, and growl and grumble, as only Englishmen can do when
they are put to it. Many was the exclamation we heard, of “Now then,
Stupid!” whilst the painful cry, every second minute, of “Where are
}. showing to?” revealed the sad history of an injured corn, or, may-
ap, an oppressed bunion, smarting under the iron heel of the heaviest
despotism. We felt for these poor sufferers, complaining audibly,
and evidently struggling, in a misty twilight, to catch the careless
oppressor who had trodden on their softest feelings. The gloom, how-
ever, favoured their escape, and may probably aid the elopement, some
wintry afternoon, of one of our finest LANDseeRs, or most valuable
MULREADys. Really a light might be afforded, if it was only a rush-
light, to cast a ray of glory upon our poor eclipsed native artists. Why
not let lanthorns be let out near WILKIE’s statue, or candles be sold at
a penny a-piece, or small dips be handed to every visitor who ventures
down the cellar, as they do in the Austrian salt mines?
Little link-boys might be allowed to traffic outside to show strangers
the way to the Vernon º: It is too bad that foreigners should
go away with the motion that English Art is in such a state of profound
darkness in our country, as our Fine Arts Commissioners have too

Perhaps you may endeavour to elude the responsibilities of your
position by sending hither your clerk? Perhaps you have not chosen
SIR,-
one. Come, let me guide you in your choice. What is the “cunningest
pattern” that “excelling nature” has cut out for the attorney's clerk?
A clear head and a polished boot, a quick eye and a clean shirt, with a
moderate amount of “vaulting ambition,” but an aversion to that
leap-frog which is the bane of our clerical youth, which meets us on
the landings of our staircases, disturbs us at our arbitrations, and con-
verts our ante-rooms into little better than that spot at the foot of
Mount Aventine, celebrated for the celebration of the Lupercalia by
the Roman boys. Let me ask you, Sir, shall we re-establish a Lupercal
at the bottom of every stair-case? No, Sir; I would rather be the
CURTIUs of my own coal-cellar, and by coming suddenly down upon
them—shut them up. I have told you, Sir, what a lawyer's clerk
should be; let me now tell you what he should’nt.
You have heard What’s What. Listen to What's Not.
If I saw a youth with dullness in his eye, but brilliance—at the
end of a cigar—in his mouth, possessed of the sournees of the crab,
without its sharpness, having the rashness of youth with the mustachios
of manhood, slow in his understanding, but fast in his mode of life,
with a brow
“Sicklied o'er with the pale ale of Bass;”
then, although it may be true that “there can be no smoke withoutfire,”
I will not accept the smoke of the Havannah as an indication of the
fire of genius, but I will exclaim, on the contrary, “Don’t send that lad
into the law, but let the lad seek another ladder for his ambition.” .
Your's, Sir, is a profession requiring a liberal education, as I have said
before; but I may as well say it again, for it is by hitting the nail often
that we drive it home, just as by hitting the horse often, the cab-driver
was enabled to drive me home yesterday. To you comes the client,
with his affairs and himself...in a state of , nearly equal derange- |
ment. . Your office is the lunatic asylum to which he resorts. He is a
man of science, perchance, who has invented some elastic trouser-strap
at which he expects the public will take “a long pull, a strong pull, an
a pull altogether,” and which he seeks to protect by a patent. He
may be a poet, who has “loved the merry sunshine,” and said so in
gushing measure, or, forgetting that pink sarsenet takes a very good light
blue, has carolled forth the beautiful fiction that “bright things can
never dye.”* . Such a client as this may require an injunction against
iracy; for what right has, any one to “love the merry sunshine” but
#. or at least, set the fact to music, and wed it to immortal
verse? It is you that are asked to lay the law's solemn injunction on
the act, and teach these
“Land-rats and water-rats—I mean pirates”—
that they cannot carry on their piratical trade with impunity.
But do I seek to make you a natural philosopher or a scholar? No,
Sir; though jº are now lending me your ear, I would not attempt to
construct a silk purse out of such material. Nevertheless, you should
remember that in these days, Science, like a Vauxhall ham, is spread
over a wonderfully extensive surface. It is not every one for whom it
is cut fat, but nearly every one has got a taste of it. Shall the attorney
alone be left without a mouthful of the ham of Science? No! better
bury himself in the Sandwich Islands at once than undergo such a
horrible privation. The “feast of reason,” to which the advance of
education invites us, may not be so rich nor so rare as formerly, but it
is a great and comprehensive “spread” in more senses than one. For
the meanest of us Arithmetic has laid out her tables, and Geography
brought forth her plates.
The Curriculum of the Classics draws up at the humblest door,
Engineering civilly invites us, and Chemistry smoothes the way to its
most elaborate laboratories, by leading us, as it were, over a º:
that softens down the drudgery of penetrating to a knowledge of its
most mysterious drugs. The attorney and solicitor should have a
taste of everything, from physic to philosophy, from senna to SENECA,
from wit, or mirth to medicine, from the attic to the Epscm salts.
Even his handwriting should be carefully cultivated; for when we con-
sider that the pen is scarcely ever out of his hand, we cannot deem him
to be “penny wise and pound foolish,” though caligraphy should occupy
some portion of his time. Even in writing a letter for payment of
debt, he may use his pen as something on which to plume himself.
I have known, Sir, one of your class whose hand was so tremulous,
from a consciousness of his bad writing, that we should have believed
him to be in his dotage, if we had judged by his I's. Within my own
knowledge, Sir, there is a sad instance of a fatality having nearly
occurred through the hieroglyphical writing of an attorney. The
subject was one of a criminal charge, and he wrote a letter to a witness
to come and prove an alibi. The letter was unintelligible. The case
was one of murder, and the client was nearly hanged upon his attorney's
pothooks. Fortunately the case for the prosecution broke down, by the
murdered man walking into Court, or the innocent accused might have
been troubled with a line, because a witness was so troubled with a line
by the attorney as to have been actually unable to make it out. It is
true that sometimes “might overcomes right;" but in this case, right
* I love the Merry Sunshine, and Bright Things can Never Die, are the names of two
ballads, fresh from the heart and the music-publishers, at two shillings each.

might have been overcome by bad writing, and the want of six lessons
in penmanship would then have taught the attorney a sad lesson
indeed. I myself, Sir, have had briefs sent to me, in which there have
been figures that f thought were figures of fun, and I have been unable
to unravel the sixes and sevens into which my client may have thrown
his affairs.
I cannot quit this part of my subject without º; upon º
Believe me, Sir, I would not º an ounce of my Logic for a pound of
your brass. It is Logic that helps me to the use of this language, so
ºf. nervous that I perceive you have caught its nervousness,
and are trembling like a leaf. Logic enables you to arrest your own
attention; and, though arrest in other cases is nearly abolished, it is
* to keep up the good old legal practice, even to this limited
extent.
University education is not a bad thing, Sir, for an attorney, nor
for any one else; but were I to judge by my knowledge of you, I should
say that if you had ever been at College, you had picked up nothing
there but the College Hornpipe, and that of the College Hornpipe, the
double shuffle, Sir-yes, Sir, the Double SHUFFLE-is all that you
have retained.
. My words are too much for you, Sir, and you are retreating. Go,
Sir. I am glad that a sense of shame, or another appointment, carries
you away. In the words of SHAKspEARE let me address you, Sir,
before you descend the staircase, and—
“If any spark of shame is still remaining,”
you will perhaps oblige me by going
“Down, down to—Dick's—and say I want my dinner.”

MR. DUNUP'S AFFAIRS.
We are happy to observe that MR. DUNUF, following the example of
some of the leading Railway Companies, has at length resolved on
publishing a statement of his affairs. This step had become absolutely
necessary, on account of the various unpleasant rumours lately in circu-
lation upon this somewhat painful subject. In one or two quarters a
composition had been talked, about, while in others a suggestion had
been actually made for a regular wind-up; both of which alternatives
MR. DUNUP had resolved to scornfully reject. He is not prepared at
present to offer anything in pursuance of the first arrangement, and as
to the second, he refuses it with disdain; for though his transactions
may not have been as regular as clockwork, he looks upon a winding-up
as the very last resort. We hope the following very clear summary of
MR. DUNUP's position will silence, not only public rumour, but his own
private knocker, which has been kept continually going since the
reports of his difficulties were first whispered abroad.

It will be seen from the above clear and satisfactory statement, that
on a valuation of all the anticipated assets, MR. DUNUP's estate will be
ºf only solvent, but will afford to that gentleman a handsome surplus.
We are glad to find that he has followed the example of the Railway
. and we are quite sure that his balance-sheet will be as
intelligible as theirs, and nearly as satisfactory.
Monstrum Horrendum.
. It is all very well to talk of the Great Sea Serpent, but a more
disgusting ºf: exists in the shape of that aquatic monster the
Serpentine. It is several hundred feet in length, and presents a most
loathsome appearance, being covered nearly all over with a coat of green.
If a stone is thrown at it, the monster sends up a black and noxious
fluid of the most poisonous description.
The bed it occupies is formed by a collection of several layers of
filth, which has been accumulating for several years; and it is believed
that many have fallen victims to the venomous exhalations that the
monster has long been in the habit of sending forth.

A NURSERY LAY FOR YOUNG LANDLORDS.
IF I live, and grow up to a great man, I hear
That I shall come into ten thousand a year.
Oh! what shall I do with it all f. I suppose
I can't spend it in eating, and drinking, and clothes.
Shall I buy a large number of horses and hounds?
What a lot I could purchase for ten thousand pounds!
But I surely can do something better than feed
More horses and dogs than I ever shall need.
Shall I bet on the turf f : Shall I gamble and play?
Oh! but that would be throwing my money away;
If I lost I should be a ridiculous goose:
If I won, with my riches, 'twould still be no use.
Shall I keep up a box at the Operaf Let’s see-
Several hundreds a year I am told it would be;
Which would prove me possess'd of more money than sense,
Since the pit only comes to eight shillings six pence.
I have made up my mind. I will have, nicely planned,
A number of cottages built on my land;
Snug and neat, but not gaudy, well drain'd they shall be,
For poor people to live in that labour for me.
I shall ask them as little as may be for rent,
And that, I have heard, will pay full five per cent.;
Of their comforts and morals I'll take the best care,
Keeping them in good order—their cots in repair.
Tis in this way my fortune I mean to employ,
But my hunting and shooting I’ll also enjoy;
Pursuing my pastime, improving my health,
At the same time bestowing around me my wealth.
We should not be regarded with envy and spite
By the poor, if we rich people always did right,
And adopted the course I’m determined to steer
From the moment I get my ten thousand a year.
ANOTHER WELLINGTON STATUE.
THE rage for erecting sta-
tues to the DUKE has seized
the boot-shops. We give a
view of one that has lately
been put up in Whitechapel.
The fact of there only being
one boot might seem rather
odd at first, but it is sufficiently
compliment,which is evidently
meant to be set up with the
statue, that there is but one
great WELLINGTON in the
world. We hope that, now the
Wellington Statue mania has
; down into our public
oots, we may consider it to
have reached its last extrem-
ity. We fear that the National
Guards, during their last visit,
must have thought the DUKE
OF WELLINGTON our, only
reat man; and surely his
É. emblemed in our very
boots, looks as if he was our
sole celebrity.
Musical Critics.
OUR friends of the musical world have given up their alphabetical style
of criticism—at least for the present—and We are no º puzzled
with their A.’s in alt., their B.’s in the bass, and their little military
touches about Major Fifths, with which they have so fre j
us. They are now beginning a new style of mystification by talking about
voices being ropey and wiry—a ropey voice being, we suppose, a voice
that can take a dominant cord, or can go above the line, or perform
some other novel feat, which only the musical critic can *...";
How a voice can be wiry, we don't know, though we have heard of
such a thing as a voice as clear as a bell; and, as bells hang upon wires,
we see a sort of connection between the human voice and the wiry
quality that is often assigned to it.

THE SEA SERPENT IN THE THAMES.
We lose not a single moment in laying the subjoined letter before
the eyes—ſhow they will be opened!)—of astonished London. The
Sea Serpent is in the Thames' It will be seen that the monster was
beheld by our correspondent—a most intelligent and conscientious
waterman, as we have made it our business to discover-off Chelsea
Reach. Whether, in its course from the sea up the river, the Serpent
has entirely swallowed the multitudinous family of whitebait off Black-
wall, is a speculation that must, until next May, feverishly engage the
minds of all men interested in the Crown and Sceptre of Greenwich.
However, we hasten to introduce the reader to the letter of John

# style that endears to our memories the voyages of Anson and

It was about a hundred yards long, and seemed to move with two fins
that went round and round, and made a hissin' noise like bilin’ water;
and it carried its head out o' water some twenty feet and more, womiting
sometimes smoke and sometimes fire. And so it went on at the matter
often knots an hour, till it came to Battersea Bridge, where it seemed
to bend its head back'ards to go thro' the arches, and so, takin' the

PUNCH ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.
THE REFORMATION.
WHATEVER, glory may attach to the reign of HENRY on account of the
Reformation, is due to the polygamic propensities of that Royal reprobate.
Had his domestic arrangements been respectable, he would never have
renounced Popery; but as the Court of Rome would not allow him to “put
away” his wives like his old coats, whenever he wished for a change, he
became a bitter opponent of the papal power. He had at first attacked the
Reform movement, and, like one of our more recent HARRIES, he had taken
to pamphleteering, for the purpose of putting the proofs of his inconsistency
into black and white; but again, like our own old HARRY, he made no
scruple of changing his tone altogether, and turning his back upon his former
self, when he wished to wed himself to “another3. .” When the decision
came from Rome, by which CATHARINE was or . to be returned upon
HENRY's hands, he flew into a storm of passion, which, after whirling him
ë. ºld round, left him prostrate upon the bosom of the Reformed
urch.
The personal interest of the sovereign chanced to be in accordance with
the popular feeling, and there was no difficulty, therefore, in setting the
British bull-dog in antagonism to the papal bulls. Though the Reformation
was popular, the divorce of CATHARINE was quite the reverse, and the good
old English rallying cry of “Woman
in distress” was everywhere heard.
The king was secretly spoken of as
“the man who could basely ill-use a
British female,” and it was occasionally
hinted that he was “unworthy of the
name of an officer and a gentleman; ”
but he was regardless of these matters
so long as he got rid of CATHARINE,
and he used to say, with a cruel dupli-
city of allusion to his opponents and
his wife, that he did not care a button - -
for the entire Kit. HENRY's religious
zeal took at a very early period a rapacious turn, and he soon began to combine
his spiritual with his secular interests, by pouncing upon all the moveables
of the monks; and whilst reforming, abuses with one hand, he pocketed the
gº. of those abuses with the other. He, however, amused his subjects
by pretending to do º: for the good of the country out of the
immense wealth he had seized for the advantage of himself, and he repaired
a few highways as well as a port or two in the Channel; but he did so very
reluctantly, for he declared that to lay out money in mending roads, was to
throw it in the dirt, and to devote ready cash to the improvement of harbours
was merely sinking so much capital. .
In order to bring the religious notions of the nobility to the same tone
as his own, and persuade them to see the errors of Popery in their true
colours, he gave them large slices of the spoil, and their eyes were suddenly
open to the horrors of superstition, as well as to the excellence of thereformed
religion. However corrupt the monasteries may or may not have been, it
is clear that the King and his nobles did not scruple to act as scavengers
to the “filthy dross;” and, having carted it away, they laid it as manure to
the roots of the ancestral trees of some of our “first families.” This pro-
ceeding was highly important in a constitutional sense, for it humbled the
once haughty clergy, and made them cut their coats-or regulate their habits
—according to their cloth, while it gave to many of the nobility a power that
has often stood very advantageously between the overstraining of
the prerogatives of the Crown, and the too great license of the
people. Admitting the heads of the Aristocracy to be sometimes
overcharged with lead, it must be allowed that the metal in
question has, at least, considerable weight, without being wholly
unyielding; and in the vessel of the State there is no better ballast
than a Peerage, sufficiently ponderous to keep us steady in our
goings on, but sufficiently ductile to take from time to time
the premion, that the force of public opinion may be used to
lmpart.
We cannot, like the “smatterers in History,” give credit to
HENRY THE EIGHTH for sincerity as a church reformer, since his
plan of reformation went little further than that wholesale spoli-
ation which is not unfrequently the covert object of an ultra-liberal
reform. What are usually called the great errors of Popery were
by no means removed in the religion established by HENRY ; but
instead of rooting out the errors, he simply disabused the monks
of the one great, mistake, that having collected so many good
things, they would be allowed the undisturbed possession of their
acquisitions. -
Upon HENRY's death the Reformation was really carried out
under EdwarD THE SIXTH, the Boy King, who was a very early
specimen of a regular infant prodigy. SomERSET, the Protector,
who played the part of showman to the monstrificus puellus, as
CARDAN calls him, made the most of the phenomenon, and a
journal has been published, purporting to have been kept ‘. the
young king, which, instead of being a mere record of tarts demo-
lished, toys purchased, and sights seen—as might have been
expected in the pocket-book of a youngster—is replete with
business-like matter. . Whether as much of it as remains may be
regarded as the genuine cream of the young king's thoughts we
are unable to say, for we have scarcely done more than skim it
off in a moment of leisure; but there is no doubt that Edward
THE SIXTH would have been regarded as a promising youth at any
classical and commercial academy, or even at an evening school
for adults.
Though the Crown and the Aristocracy supported the cause
of the Reformation, because its plunder supported them, the
people, who got nothing by the job, were not disposed to consider
matters quite ripe for a change; and it is not wonderful they
should hesitate to see ripeness where they were to get no pickings.
Accordingly, in the time of MARY-familiarly known by a term
equivalent to “sanguinary Poll.”—the road, to Rome was easily
retraced, and England was formally reconciled to the papal See,
with a blindness of obedience to the royal will that says little for
Parliamentary enlightenment.
A PATTERN CATECHISM FOR YOUTHFUL
CANDIDATES. :
THE HON. CHARLEs FITzwillLAM, in the timidity of extreme
youth, has had some difficulty in making known—by way of
answer to a requisition—his political principles to the electors of
the West Riding. We modestly propose a pattern document for
the future voters and candidates.
I. Will you support Free Trade 2–As for Free Trade, there is
not the slightest doubt that the potato blight, the cholera, and
possibly the Sea Serpent, would have compelled some relaxation
of our commercial policy-even if possibly the potatoes had been
sound, the cholera had been unknown, and the Sea, Serpent had
remained, as the song says, “coiled about the world.”
II. Will you advocate the Extension of the Suffrage *-
With the greatest pleasure. Every man with a vote—it has
long been my opinion—should be allowed to vote at every polling-
booth: if the vote does not count for more than at present, the
§. in giving it is prolonged; and this I call Extension of the
uffrage.
III. Will you advocate Separation of Church and State P-
With the greatest pleasure; that is, all the people of state shall,
as at present, be separated in pews, and the people be separated
as now in the body of the Church.
IV. Will you advocate Retrenchment of Public Expenses?—
I have not yet made up my mind. That entirely depends upon
what the Minister may refuse or offer me.
A QUESTION QUESTIONABLY ANSWERED.
WHEN will France find repose? It will, mayhap,
If it resolves at once to take a NAP.

without intention, done

recollects no thief since

The people at large,
who have a notion that
kings and queens wear
diadems instead of hats

about with them—as a
sort of state life-pre-

been much astonished
to find that HER Ex-
CELLENT MAJESTY can let her Imperial notions subside into the home:
liness of common life; and, forgetful for awhile of the jangling of
Qabinet Councils, can busy her thoughts with the “Head of ºn Arab
Gipsy and Child, and H. of an Old Woman,” (No. 60). The Windsor

very pretty, very charming, we must confess the exhibition to be... We
do not believe that, Louis-PHILIPPE left any such etchings at the
Tuilleries, as “The Apotheosis of MIGNON;” neither, so far as is yet
known of the matter, did the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA, on his late
drive from his capital, leave such memorandum as “Pigeons at the
Royal Aviary,” in charge of his beloved Viennese. Therefore, it is
more than pleasant to contemplate the private recreation of a Queen,
when it is at once so refined, so graceful, and so truly womanly. We
have read all MADAME D'ARBLAY's book of the Court of GeoRGE THE
THIRD, and find nothing so agreeably suggestive in it, as in the “List of
the Royal Engravings” filed in the Court of the Vice-Chancellor.
º Panch be permitted to touch with his pen—a dove's quill—a few
of the homelier subjects P To begin:-
“No. 1. Portrait of a Turk, Head of an Old Man, and German Peasant Girl.
Drawn and etched by HEA MAJEsty, Aug. 28, 1840.”
Were the portraits from the life? If so, who was the Turk? Who
the chosen Old Man (no doubt made happy with a thumping present
for his modelship)? Who the German Peasant Girl: , Have we seen her
in London streets, thumbing a tambourine ... Did her picturesque
look catch the Royal eye in the course of a Windsor drive? and was
she forthwith commanded by equerry to prepare for a sitting to-morrow?
At this moment is not that very girl—(for so is the meanest accessory
of Art rewarded at the Castle)—the wife of a thriving farmer on the
Rhine, having brought him an apronful of English gold for a dowry:
There can be no doubt of it.
The dogs honoured by the QUEEN-like many other lucky dogs of
this world—are altogether ignorant of their happiness. Otherwise, how
would “Islay, a Scotch Terrier,” twitch his whiskers, elated beyond
the usual elation of puppyhoodſ ...And “Eos, a Russian Greyhound,”
would bound more lithely, walk with nobler step. But let us rise to a
loftier theme:—
“No 16. Portrait of His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT. Copied by HER
MAJEsty from SIR GEongE HAYTEA's Marriage Picture, and etched by the QUEEN,
Oct. 26, 1840.”
Pretty and wife-like this. A labour of love, full of happy memories.
How many Queens—IsabelLA OF SPAIN, for one—would prefer any
other subject to dwell upon, save that of their Marriage Picture' (Is
it not so, Count NEUILLY F)
“No. 19. Portrait of a Lady. Drawn and etched by HER MAJEsty, Nov. 18, 1840.

- -
Who is the Lady, and who the Female A very proper and very
courtly distinction. No doubt, however, both handsome ; both the
porcelain and the delf.
“No. 27. Scene from the Opera of Norma. Drawn by HER MAJEsty in 1836, and
etched by the QUEEN, Jan. 7, 1841.”
This is, perhaps, one of the most condescending tributes ever paid by
Royalty to Art and the Drama. It has been held a fine thing that
FRANCIS THE FIRST once picked up TITIAN's pencil; but this was only
the grace of a moment. Now, a good slice of the day of January the
7th, 1841, must have been given up by HER MAJESTY by way of studied
compliment to the Drama of our land (as imported). If MR.LUMLEY be
wise, he will immediately have the subject painted for an act-drop.

Any way, we can hardly find fault with the Windsor rogues who have
caused it to be made known to all men that HER MAJESTY delights in
the labour that from month to month, and from day to day, fixes...the
changing loveliness of babyhood, and enshrines the future with unfailing
memories of the happy past. We shall never again see VICTORIA,
whether in cottage bonnet, in pony chaise, or in diamond frontlet in the
House of Peers, without thinking of those fifteen portraits—the tender
work of tender mother’s hands—of the PRINCESS ROYAL.
To return to the Windsor thieves. The pillory is gone. That vene-
rable piece of timber (the very heart of British oak) has been cut down
by levellers. Otherwise, the folks concerned in the plate robbery would
surely have been doomed to twirl their hour. In which case they would,
no doubt, have been pelted for their evil doings. And yet who—pon-
dering the prettiness they have brought to light—who would have cast
at them aught heavier than sugar-plums—aught dirtier than custards?
Again; we recognise another good in ºi. PRINCE ALBERT
has been in Chancery. The QUEEN and the PRINCE now personally feel
what it is to be robbed, pillaged, pirated. Will they then do their best
to push on an International Law of Copyright with our kind friends in
America, who live by robbing “us youth,” and against whose wicked-
ness there is not even the forlorn hope of the Vice-Chancellor *
BARBAROUS TREATMENT OF THE EQUITY BAR.
It is well known in legal circles that the Equity Bar is, four times per
annum, walked nearly off its legs by having to run backwards and
The sittings, being
held alternately in the East and in the Sou’-West, keep the Chancery Bar,
like the vane of a weathercock, engaged in the truly vain task of vibrating
continually between those two points of the compass. The Equity
Counsel shares, with the Pilgrim of Love, a perpetual restlessness.
The bearer of his bag is a literal bagman, for he is an incessant traveller
between the Hall of Westminster and the Inn of Lincoln. As to the
Vice-Chancellors, they are almost as much “put about” as the Bar; for
no sooner does KNIGHT BRUCE get himself snugly ensconced with his
curtains drawn cosily round him in the little outhouse they have run up for
him in the old yard, than he is obliged to get the carrier to call for the
º of Justice, and “move in" to his “humble shed” at the
ack of Chancery Lane, Really there is no knowing where the limits
of one Court end, and the confines of the other begin. A suitor
scarcely knows whether he and his business have been (to use the
technical term) “done at Westminster” or done at Lincoln's Inn.
WICE-CHANCELLOR KNIGHT BRUCE has been heard to ask for a
caravan, which he would glauly convert into a Court of Justice, so that
he might be only allowed to call it and consider it his own. We weli
remember the iribulation of his Honour when he used to hold his
sittings in a three-pair back, and was constantly being interrupted by
the announcement that the room was wanted for another party; upon

a cause on “further directions” on the landing outside a door, take
petitions through the banisters, and hear small motions under an
umbrella in the court º below. Such is the determination of his
Honour to attend to the interests of the suitors, that we are sure he
would not personally object to sit under the dry arches of Waterloo
Bridge, if no other spot could be found for him, or to take short causes
in any of the doorways in the neighbourhood of Westminster Hall.
“Give me but the portico of the Sessions House” is the feeling of his
Honour, “but let me have it to myself; and if Counsel will only
regard the division made by the railings as marking a distinction
between the Inner and the Outer Bar, I will undertake to get through
the whole business of the term, and the sittings aſter.”
His prayer, however, is not yet to be granted. The Equity Bar must
still be the shuttlecock of ſate, knocked backwards and forwards between
those battledores—the doors of Westminster Hall and Lincoln's Inn.
It is proposed to sit at the latter place during one part of the year, and
at the former during another part; but eventhese semiannual migrations
are very properly exclaimed against by the exhausted Equity Counsel,
who sings—
“Faint and wearily the wayworn barristers
Plodon droopingly, afraid to stop:
Dim and drearily the clerks go after them,
Wig-bºx carrying, and fit to drop;
Limping, laughing,
One another chaffing.”

A PALPABLE MISTAKE.
“Gossipzille.
Y DEAR MR. Punch,
“I’m come back
again. Well, I sup-
pose you know that;
at all events it’s got
nothing at all to do
with it. Last Mon-
day, I took my º
cousin Georgie all
the way from St.
John’s Wood into
London, to see those
firesome National
Guards that dearest
KATHLEEN is always
raving about. She
s is to be eighteen on
Xer next birthday.
Let mesee—what was
I talking about * 0,
yes, to be sure—the
National Guards.
Well, I never, did see such odious frights. Upon my word, there
were men chairing them about the streets—the ugly, clumsy things
—in chairs, too! I am sure, I wonder how they could bear to touch
them. No sort of uniform,
either; only pasteboard hats,
and trumpery coats, and looking,
for all the world, as if they were
stuffed with straw. One of
them had the audacity to have
abeautiful Albert Haton, which
you like so much. And they
had all lanterns, too—but so
have our own Railway Guards
—and he must have been tipsy,
the horrid brute, he reeled so
in his cart. They said he be-
longed to the heavy artillery,
and an old woman told me some
of them had been caught trying
to blow up St. James's and the
House of Parliament. Only
think, Sir! and these monsters
come over under the guys of
friendship, too! Coming home
we met a rabble of those dread-
ful boys, carrying another of
them, and drumming and
cheering—what they call ‘fra-
termising’ him. When I asked
where they were taking him, they only said, “Fawkes, Fawkes.” I
suppose they were silver forks he had stolen. I hope he was going
to the Old Bailey. Oh, if I was his wife, I’d give it to him! I’m
sure if I was a man, I wouldn't submit to be put on by those Guards
—black-guards, I call them.
There are some of them big enough,
to be sure; but their legs and arms don't look like soldiers at all;
how they managed to fight at Waterloo, I'm sure I don't know.

OXFORD MIXTURE,
Oxford, determined not to be outdone by her sister University, is
making a movement in rivalry of that which has so much enlarged the
circle of Cambridge teaching. As Cambridge is hereafter to offer to
her sons her draughts of science, not pure but mixed; administering,
from 1849, not the “cold without” of Algebraic Abstraction, but
the “warm with.” of Physical Philosophy, so Oxford is bent on blend-
ing the practical with the theoretic, and mixing the uovauxn with the
yuuyao turn, as recommended by Plato and ARIstotle. We insert
the following advertisement from the Oxford Herald of Saturday
week:-
AN OXFORD M.A., who Graduated in Honours, and is now resident upon
the South Coast, within easy distance of London, will be happy to receive into
his House two or three Undergraduates, to read with him during the ensuing
winter Vacation. He can offer accommodation for three or four Horses. There are
Foxhounds (2 packs) and Harriers in the neighbourhood—excellent Wild Duck Shooting
Pike Fishing, &c. References to men of almost every College in the University.
Address A.G., care of Mr. &c., &c.
This is a fine sample of the Oxford Mixture. We feel it our duty,
however, to amplify this brief prospectus into a detailed programme
of the arrangements for the winter season of this Oxford Graduate.
Sunday. Rise at eleven-breakfast, and a Tract for the Times.
Walk to the river and look at the chub-holes, and mark down pike for

I SAID A (hic) PLEsi-
| THE MISREPRESENTED CITY.
We read of a toast being given at the Lord Mayor's
Feast, to the “Members of the City.” Now the City is
without its full complement of Members, which we look
upon as the worst compliment that could be paid to a city
". ºfesses to be “the most civilised metropolis in the
world.”
Since BARON Rothschild has been thrown out, the
City of London has been most singularly misrepresented
in Parliament. The least Ministers can do in return
for a good dinner, is next session to re-Member the City.
We are told that Rothschild was advised to respond, to
the toast; but he said, with great irony and modesty, “My
feelings won't allow me—I never felt so, disgracefully
§ out.” We wish he had risen and spoken as
Ollows :-
“Gentlemen, I was elected by you; but the House of
Lords said, “This man is not worthy to represent, you,
because he is a Jew.’ Parliament says to the City of
London ‘Make your free election;' but mind, that election
is null and void, if it happens to be a Jew, Government
is not too proud to ask my advice now and then upon finan-
cial matters; but then it declares I am unqualified to legis-
late upon such questions, because I am a Jew. I am
received everywhere, the honours of the City are open
to me, I can enter every place with renown, but the House
of Commons—the door of that is shut in my face, simply
because I am a Jew.... You associate with me, foreign
States deal with me, Kings have been my clients, every
capital in Europe puts confidence in me, you with the same
confidence elect me your Member; but the House of
Lords says, that confidence is grossly misplaced, because
am a Jew. Let us hope the day is not far distant when
England will respect the opinions, and honour the consciences
of all men, even of Jews.”
* There BY HANGS A TALE."
LoRD BRough AM has left England in a steamer. We are
informed, but mind we do not state how credibly, that his
Lordship has started expressly to have an interview with the
Great Sea Serpent. He intends to devote the remainder of
his life to this pursuit.
No more day tickets up and down,
For people who live out of town;
A Private Act that guarantees -
Our power to treat folks as we please;
Stokers cheap, and smashes plenty;
Forty per cent. instead of twenty;
For sole bye-law our high pleasure;
Engines at low price and high pressure,
(No matter though they smash and scald ore,)
Add to the ingredients of our cauldron.
Bubble, bubble, without trouble,
Fares increase and profits double !
Join three directors' heads and hands,
And the amalgamation stands !
Now for picking up our crumbs — .
Something stupid this way comes |
Open strong box, to buy our stocks!
Enter MAC-BULL. -
Mach. How now, you secret, sharp, and downright stags,
W º ’t you’d do.
All.
2nd Witch.
3rd Witch.
To us 'tis quite the same !
A Ray of Sunshine at last.
THIS has certainly been a wonderful year; but of all wonders that
have been packed as close as a carpet bag into it, none has been more
wonderful than the wonder which set everybody wondering on Lord
Mayor's Day. Future ages will be astonished to hear that the Show
passed through the City without a drop of rain, and reached Guildhall
without the ghost of a fog. The Sun was distinctly visible all day!!
This is the first time within the recollection of the Oldest Man in
Armour, that the Civic Monarch's reign has begun without a shower.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
ADW ER TISEMENT.
A NGELA will merely allow herself to observe, that 'busses run from
Brixton to the Bank every day, Tuesday next, at 12, included. This
much, however, she will say: the weather having set in cold, it is quite the
season to wear a Chinchilly Victorine, and a velvet mantle. P.S. Damask
roses in cottage.
THE DRAGON'S-BLOOD ORANGE CLUB.
A MAGNIFICENT supper was eaten on the 5th of November by
Club, in commemoration of the unexploded gunpowder of GUY
FAwkes. The Chair was taken by Brother OCH MURTHER. He
made an elegant address. Rising, he observed- ---
There was ºf in the world (after a good supper) like the
Christian virtues. He was proud to say, he saw the table full of them.
There was not a Brother there who did not think every Papist a
scoundrel; and who did not believe that the curse of Ireland was the
Catholic religion. That blot, however, should be scratched out—if
necessary, by the point of the sword. He was a Christian, and a man
of peace; and as such, his cry was—“War to the knife, and no sur-
render!” He was very sorry for QUEEN VICTORIA. He wished to
speak of the gentlewoman § the deference of a #. subject and the
politeness of an Irishman; but this he must say of HER MAJESTY-no;
on second thoughts, he would not say it; but he would not shrink
from his duty. He would give the following toast:-
“QUEEN VICTORIA, and may she º return to the upright
principles which placed her illustrious family on the British throne!”
AIR.—“Why are you wandering here, I pray?”
The Chairman next gave—
“The Notorious, Glorious, and Uxorious Memory of the immortal
KING WILLIAM THE THIRD !”
AIR.—“Old King Cole.”
This toast, was drunk with three Irish howls, every Brother going
down upon his knees, and—ere he tossed off his glass-knocking his
head thrice upon the floor. A few enthusiasts took the sawdust out of
the spittoons, and—to show their sorrow for their loss-sprinkled it
upon their heads. The effect of this was very impressive.
The next toast was—
“ERNEST, King of Hanover.”
AIR.—“'Tis the last Rose of Summer.”
This toast was, of course, honoured by very many “Bravos.” Brother
O'Brºther, a distinguished ſocksmith, returned thanks. He said-
the KING OF HANovek was a great King. In the present Cimmerian
darkness of the Continent, when the sweet firmament of rational
liberty was obscured by the pestilential fogs of Popery—in the present
hour of Stygian, gloom, it was a pity that ERNEST, like Romeo in the
play, could not be cut into little stars, that he might at one and, the
same time twinkle over twenty kingdoms. And Oh! wouldn't it be a
great day for Ireland, if QUEEN VICTORIA—whom he wished to speak
of with the least—he meant, at least—respect, if she would only invite
this
to England her beloved uncle—that unsqueezeable orange—to take of
him a few lessons upon Church and State. As it was, HER MAJESTY-
though he could never, forget, the Maynooth Grant and the potato
blight that grew out of it—as it was, he would not refuse the QUEEN
the benefit of his prayers.
The next toast was—
“Protestant Ascendancy in Church and State.”
AIR.—“March to the battlefield.”
The Assistant Secretary returned thanks. He said it had been asked
what was really, and truly, and definitely intended by Protestant
Ascendancy? It was this: that in throwing the State dice, Protestant
Ascendancy should always come up sixes. Now, this could never be
left to chance. ...Certainly not. How, then, effect it? Why, by loading
the die; not with lead, but with a heavier metal—gold. (Loud Cheers;
in the middle of which the table, that had long groaned with every delicacy
of wine and dessert, broke down ; the lights went out; and the brethren,
tumbling one over the other, each man illustrated to his utmost, his personal
desire for Protestant Ascendancy.)"
A KINDLY CAUTION TO TRESPASSERS.
THE pleasantest and dullest road to Richmond—we adapt our des-
cription to all tastes—is that which leads over Hammersmith Bridge
through Barnes and Mortlake... There is the peaceful repose—or #.
extreme dreariness-about portions of it, of quiet, solemn park-scenery.
Going to Richmond by this road you will remark, to the left, within
three quarters of a mile from the town, a sign-post, directing you
through a bye-lane, to the Star and Garter. , You will take that path,
which is also the lonelier and more agreeable, because it will be the
nearest to your destination, inasmuch as you are bound to dine with a
party of friends at the tavern just mentioned. You pursue your
journey in anticipation of a choice banquet and a glorious sunset, an
outlook on the valley, of the Thames, which will suggest the happiest
imaginings, and the delightful reality of one of the best dinners in the
world before you. You are in the most amiable frame of mind possible—
on excellent terms with yourself and all mankind. In these disposi-
tions, your goal in view, midway between it and the humbler hostel
of the “Lass of Richmond, Hill,” on your left, surmounting a hig
wall you will observe a Board inscribed with the subjoined benevolent
notification. We have transcribed it verbatim et literatim:-

This precious relic of the olden time—which probably has long out-
lived the old boy who reared it—is slowly yielding to decay. Perhaps
it is destined soon to fall before the hand of innovation and improve-
ment. As a tribute to the memory of the venerable individual whose
spirit yet survives in his Notice, Punch thus throws the halo of his own
immortality around this interesting monument of crusty exclusiveness.

TRAITORS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, - - -
“You are one of the most humane and kind-hearted of satirists,
and stopped one of my letters while the Conspirators' Trials were
nding, for fear lest the severity of that remarkable production should
º: borne hard on the prisoners, and perhaps have shortened, their
lives. Sir, you could not be brought to believe that, the trial, the
defence, the depositions, the formation of the Jury, and the verdicts,
and the sentences, were humbugs altogether, and you consigned to the
flames the document which exposed those fictions. What sober man
ever believed that anybody was going to hang MR. SMITH O'BRIEN, or
in that way put an end to young MR. MEAGHER's oratory P
“This morning, looking over the Dublin Evening Post (at Derraheeny
Castle, the hospitable mansion of my friend, Roland. CASHEL, Esq.),
saw a letter which a MR. MAGEE, a gentleman who is a traitor to the
British Government, addresses to a New York paper. Ah, Sir, what a
blessing it would be for England, and what a comfort to the States, no
doubt, if all the traitors to Government would but join company with
MR. MAGEE | - - - -
“In this letter, MR. T. DARcy MAGEE, a traitor to the British
Government, has the honour to announce to the inhabitants of New
York his safe arrival in that city. He feels, no doubt, that his mis-
fortunes will create a sympathy for him in the breasts of all honest and
prudent citizens; and, having failed in his attempt to incendiarise his
own country, he flung himself with confident generosity upon the
hospitality of the great North American Republic. - - - -
“Before quitting his beloved Ireland, MR. MAGEE did his best to
plunge her in anarchy, ruin, and murder. It was not his fault if a
H. Government thwarted his designs and those of the good and
I three
great men with whom he acted. Some of these have been nabbed and
are in prison. Dogged from the cabbage-groves of Boulagh, to the
clanking dungeons of Clonmel, they have met, without blenching, the
anger of the Law, and would have died resolutely under her fasces,
had the bloody Government not let them off. Honour to the Martyrs
of freedom! Next to coming to America, it would have been most
agreeable to MR. DARcy MAGEE to have laid his head on the block
where they F. their own, and, having cursed England—got up again.
But to see America was MR. MAGEE's first duty. He is here, and he
hails the Republic.
“Gentlemen interested in murder and rebellion, may inspect, at
MR. MAGEE's offices, the , beautifully bloody, and authentic plans
ordained for the late revolution. He has no objection to publish the
councils of the leaders from whom he has run away; and, now he is out
of Ireland, thinks it right, to the best of his humble means, to exaspe-
rate the English against that most miserable and beloved country.
“As the people are starving, as usual, and the begging season is to
be uncommonly well attended, MR. MAGEE begs to warn the people of
England, THAT THE Two stroNGEst of FEELINGs of THE IRIsh, ARE

them credit, are begging the bloody-minded Government to hold its
hand, nor deal severely with the leaders of a rebellion, which wasn't a
rebellion after all, only an excitement—nothing but a little discontent—
merely a show to frighten the English Government into compromise,
like those for which the late dear MR. O'Connell obtained so much
credit—it will be a great comfort to all parties to know that there
really was a rebellion intended to the Government, because the charge
of cruelty is disposed of; and, the deuce is in it if men menaced by cut-
throats, may not apprehend their assassins. The friends of the prisoners,
who, havin -
outrage and rebellion always excite in a noble and romantic country,
must, nevertheless, perceive, that though º for all prisoners and cap-
tives is a Christian quality, it is better, after all, to have them locked up,
than practising upon your own throats, families, and hayricks; and to
the gallant prisoners, finally writhing in the dungeons of a bloody
Government, whose honour is saved, at any rate, by their friends' timely
vindication, and who can say to those inclined to exclaim, “Pooh! you
never intended to fight; psha! you are but braggarts and brawlers’—
who can say, ‘Dastards, ye lie to the teeth ! DARcy is there and free,
listen to him, if ye will not to us. We were going to pike and torch;
We were § to fire and murder; we were not bragging, but in earnest;
and very kind it is of DARcy to vouch for us from New York.”
“MR. T. DARcy MAGEE then respectfully requests inspection of the
plans, as proposed for the late insurrection.
“In confidence, his explanations will be full and complete; but at
present it is only his intention to say so much.
“The towns were strongly garrisoned by the bloody old troops of the
- |QUEEN, whom it would be impossible to attack in their fastnesses. It
was the intention of the gentlemen of the Executive to burn down the
towns, so that the troops would naturally be put upon the country.
Here they could be disposed of more easily—multitudes of guerilla
bands would deal with them, and cut them off. And though it is certain
that by roasting them in the cities a vast number of Irish must have
been roasted too, yet a patriot, and one especially who is across the
water, and has nothing to lose, can contemplate the idea of his people
butchered and his country in a blaze, for the sake of the delightful free-
dom which would afterwards ensue, and the harm which the bloody old
British Government must get in the shindy.
“But for the intervention of the Irish Clergy, will it be believed
that all these benefits might have been brought about? Their reve.
rences prevented their people from joining in the contemplated rising–
the tempest which was to tear the monarchy out of Ireland rose, blew,
and die º: and the only persons injured by the blast were two or
oor fellows prostrated in a cabbage-garden, and two or three
more blown across the water. The spirit was ready to come, MR.
MAGEE says, but the Irish clergy exorcised it.”
“My revered friend Punch knows my opinions, and that I believe,
for my part, it would be greatly to the benefit of this country if we could
be rid of the union with our beloved sister; but this opinion, rapidly
gaining ground, is not universal as yet; meanwhile, and until it become
so, are there not compromises to be made, and palliatives that we may
apply?
4. §: instance, if there ever was a moral pointed to a story, there is
one to the amiable tale of MR. MAGEE, and that is-PAY THE
QLERGY., What force of policemen in green coats have you...in
Ireland P what horse and foot artillery, and what do they cost? Will
it be worth your while to have3000 black policemen—the best soothers,
detectives, preventives, in the world? From the very indignation of

they extend almost horizontally, and render it nearly impossible to

PUNCH TO THE REW. THE EARL OF GUILDFORD.
My LoRD,
- A coRRESPONDENT of the Daily News, signing himself. “G.,
Winchester.” asserts that #. Lordship is Master of the Hospital of
St. Cross, near that city. He describes St. Cross Hospital as a relic " of
ancient piety and munificence,” as it is known to be. He states that
it "... was founded by princely prelates in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, and richly endowed to maintain a number of brethren, to
afford support to a number of poor, and to furnish partial refreshment
to the multitude of pilgrims and travellers journeying in the South of
England.” All perfectly true. There, he says, “the poor and weary
traveller can still demand his horn of ale and slice of bread, as he did
seven centuries ago.” . Exactly so; though the ale is not very strong of
the malt, and cannot be designated §: He avers that St. Cross is
situated “in one of the most delightful spots in the Wale of Itchen.”
I believe, my Lord, that these statements are quite correct; I am
acquainted with parties who have caught minnows in the Itchen, and
fasted the Sanetacrucian ale: albeit they gave that liquor a milder
term; for, between myself and your Lordship, they called it “swipes.”
But, my Lord, this G, also declares that the brethren of your richly-
endowed Hospital are greatly reduced in number. This may or may
not be. The Institution may have become poorer. ...Let the base
insinuation pass. I wish to arouse your Lordship's indignation at his
direct iº on yourself. He has the impudence to say, that
though the St. Cross property, if properly managed, would yield
£10,000 or £12,000 a-year, the amount expended in charity is only
£1000 a-year. He has the effrontery to assert, that whereas part of
the income arises from fines for the renewal of leases, and £12,000 was
paid lately for the renewal of a lease, your Lordship receives 16s. 10d.
in the pound out of every fine, and did receive nearly £10,000 out of the
£12,000 aforesaid. He is so audacious as to allege that your Lordship's
income is more than four-fifths of the revenues of the Charity, instead
of one-fifth, as originally intended. Pray, my Lord, allow me to excite
your Lordship's wrath by the mention of these monstrous aspersions
on your Lordship.
But no: your Lordship feels that the charges are incredible. That
you, my Lord, should have the capacity—to say nothing of the
conscience—to swallow up four-fifths of St. Cross. Hospital, beats
anything in MUNCHAUSEN. The disgusting exhibition of a clown
devouring a leg of mutton and trimmings is nothing to.it...If this
thing were true, your Lordship would be a greater prodigy than the
Sea Serpent. You would be a sinecurist so tumid, my Lord, that you
would burst a Castle of Otranto. . My largest cut, by the side of my
least initial letter, would give no idea of your Lordship's dimensions.
You would be too big for this world; and where could your Lordship
expect to go to ?
My Lord, this “G.” would make out your Lordship to be a monster
exceeding in rapacity and voraciousness, the cormorant, the vulture,
the shark, the boa-constrictor, the alligator, the whirlpool, the earth-
quake, and DANDo the celebrated oyster-eater. He would represent
you to be as greedy as the grave, and very nearly as gluttonous as Time,
the consumer of all things. I hope your Lordship will not endure his
calumnies, and will allow me to refute them; only, if you please, your
Lordship must condescend to furnish me with the data requisite for
that purpose. I have the honour to be, my Lord,
Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant,

PARIS MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT.
On the 4th instant the most alarming reports were circulated
throughout Paris; which is not to be wondered at, all things consi-
dered, and especially the fact that no less than 101 cannons were fired
between six and seven o'clock in the evening. It happily turned out
that the noise did not indicate any fresh demonstration of Red Repub-
lican liberty and fraternity, but was merely meant to announce the
birth of the New Constitution. We trust this will be the first and last
discharge of artillery which that Constitution will occasion, or, at least,
that any future connonading it may give rise to will be equally harm-
less. GENERAL CAvAIGNAc, however, should take care, another time,
how he suffers his cannons to be let off in this manner, without any
sort of notice or warning, in such a ticklish place as Paris.

THE MONS (JULLIEN) IN LABOUR.
UR Mons is again in labour; but the result is neither
a ridiculus mus nor ridiculous mus-ic, but a treat of no
ordinary character for the economic but enthusiastic
amateur. It is true that our imagination is rather over-
“a double military band,” for which the situation has
been expressly .# can give us the notion that
“Silence reigns around;” though the extreme drubbi
given to the enemy is perhaps appropriately º:
by Collin ET on the flageolet, whose conception of a
thorough flagellation is something quite marvellous.
It is gratifying to know that “in the trumpet calls
military regulations.” We understand that the Mons
had several interviews on the subject with the DUKE of
WELLINGTON, who perfectly approved the arrangements
of the professor, and several notes, both caligraphic and
musical, are understood to have passed between these
two distinguished characters.
The great attraction of the Concerts is, however, God
Save the Queen, arranged for “five distinct bands.” though
they are so jumbled together that, the preservation of
their distinctness is almost impossible. The performance
w & : * of the five bands is insignificant, after all, compared with
the performance of the audience. The enthusiasm of the latter knows not only no bounds, but tolerates no hats; and indeed such is the
demolition of these articles of head-dress that God Save the Queen, as now played, is a grand hatter's movement in at least forty flats; for, no
less than two sº of hats are nightly flattened on the heads of those who cannot raise their arms for the purpose of uncovering and showing
their loyalty. Many an unfortunate individual who is too crowded to be able to show his respect for HER MAJESTY's crown, suffers in his
own, by having his hat converted into a temporary gibus; and, though the sentiment of loyalty which inspires this onslaught upon the rebellious
beavers may be all very well, we think it hard that the public should be kept with their hats in hand, raised high in the air, during the
capricious solos with which the National Anthem is interlarded. -
o one could object to keep his hat off while the air is played; but it is rather hard to preserve a most uncomfortable attitude, while
KQENIG is shaking for a quarter-of-an-hour over “happy * glorious,” or PRosPERE is ... ling about “their politics” for ten minutes,
through his monster ophicleide. Perhaps the greatest martyr of all to the cause of loyalty is the unhappy drummer of the Coldstream, who,
standing next to one of the two men required to play upon one of the grossest cases of ſ. caise we have ever seen, receives upon his
head every contre-coup of the enormous drum-stick, to which a momentum is imparted by the performer's flinging backward his arm, and
unconsciously making the head of the Coldstreamer a fulcrum from which the drum-stick receives its rebound.
We, hope M, JULLIEN will, in, mercy, to the public, cut out all the superfluous twiddling, which detracts as much from the simple deur
of God save the Queen, as it tries the loyalty by taxing the patience of the hatless crowd, who are obliged to preserve a most awkward and uneasy
posture while listening.

WERNON GALLERY.—ARTISTIC SYMPATHIES.
UR letter-box has been
filled with letters from all
the living painters whose
pictures—known as the
Wernon Gallery—have
been put into the Na-
tional Cupboard. The
artists are, it seems, one
and all in a terrible con-
dition. There is, it
appears, some “horrid
sympathy” betweentheir
flesh and blood and their
paint and canvass. The
men suffer in their pic-
tures. If a bit of silver-
grey be scratched, the
artist feels the stab some-
where; if a cool green be
peeled, the artist has his
skin flayed away. This
is very odd, and reminds
us of the famous portrait
that gives the name of
the Picture to a play
of MAssing ER's. Of
- course in these dramatic
times, all the world knows it. Nevertheless, we will venture to speak
more fully of the incident. A certain king, going to the wars, leaves
his wife. (Some men go home to both.) He is doubtful of her con-
stancy; whereupon one Baptista presents him with a portrait, whose
changes shall truthfully indicate the changing condition of the Queen.
Baptista assures Mathias that if the picture once vary
“From the true form, and what’s now white and red
Decline to yellow"—
the lady is courted, but innocent. “But,” adds Baptista-
“But if it turn all black, 'tis an assurance
The fort, by composition or surprise,
Is forc'd, or with her free consent surrender'd.”
Such º are not to be painted now-a-days; and if they were,
some folks might refuse to sit for them. However, it would seem that
the Vernon Pictures and the Vernon Artists sympathise in an opposite
way. It is the painter that suffers when “what’s
now white and red” is rubbed into “yellow:”
it is the painter who “turns_all black” when ||
his picture receives a thump of the eye from a
crowding public.
We have no space to give all the letters at
length; but shall pick a few extracts illustrative
of_the feelings of the living painters now
suffering in their pictures.
Hear MR. S. Cooper, about his Farm. Yard
with Cattle. “For these last three weeks”—he
writes—“I haven’t had a bit of rest. No, Sir, not
so much as a bit. I have had a dreadful tender.
ness in my rightcalf, as if the skin was peeled off
like an onion. Went to the National Gallery
yesterday, Mr. Punch, and saw the whole thing.
One of my—nº, I won't say beautiful, but I might—one of my best
bits of cattle, flayed as if a butcher had skinned it. If this is to go on
I must be measured for a whole suit of diac'lum.”
The next is a very temperate appeal from MR. MacLise. He is
concerned for his Hamlet. He writes, “The day before yesterday,
Mr. Punch, I received from an invisible handa very savage ºimproper
black eye. There being nobody in my studio, I thought of course it
was my fancy; and so went on as if nothing at all had happened—to be
sure. Why should I trouble myself about it? However, going out to
dinner, and going to a glass by accident, I saw this same black eye.”
(MR. MacLise here enters into a very fine theory of colour: it is, how-
ever, too abstract for our pages—so, we jump to the great fact.)—“The
thing was plain, when to-day I º the Wernon Pit (it was once
called a Gallery). There, Sir, I saw my Polonius, with one of his eyes
nearly out—and my eye, you may be sure of it, was entirely out to look
at it., What's to be done, Mr. Punch? I'm a peaceable man, and
love the laws of the Saxon; but do you think they would allow me to
take private lodgings for my Hamlet, till the Government can provide
him with a decent apartment?”
MR. Pickersgill complains very pathetically about his Syrian
Maid. He writes—“Were she a M.W. in a lodging-
house she couldn't be worse touselled. I can't express my feelings;
and, being an R. A., I am not expected.”
MR. MULREADY complains of a dreadful “pricking of his thumb”
for some days. “Went to the Babel Gallery,” he writes, “and
found the hand of one of
my boys in Fair-Time
shockingly scratched.”
In like manner, MR.
STANFIELD suffered from
a sudden thickness of
vision. All sympathy!
Went to the Gallery, and
discovered some of his
pellucid sea-water rubbed
into brown paper.
We might proceed,
adding new instances of
sympathetic suffering on
the part of the unfortunate
men whose works have, in
veriest simplicity of heart,
been handed over by MR.
WeRNoN to the tender
mercies of our Art-loving Government. However, we trust we have
done enough to convince even a very dull reader (if we have such a
treasure) that it is very natural that, painters should feel the injuries
º upon their works as sensibly as wrongs inflicted upon their
own Liesl.
THE TIMES WERE NEWER SO BAD.
--- oR two years the badness of the times has been the cry
Wºº- of the world in general, and the excuse for dunning trades-
men in particular. Everybody to whom one owes money has
had “a little bill to make up,” ever since 1846; and the
“tightness” has been the pretext for one half the world to
= bother the other half about those “ small trifles” which
have been “standing since Christmas.”
It is a popular notion with the tardy debtor, that the tradesman who
cannot wait, has no right to continue his business; and that to ask
for his “small account” is to confess a deficiency of the requisite
capital to carry on his dealings in a respectable, or at all events in a
creditable manner. Without going sofar as this, we may confess that we
hate grumbling, and are glad, therefore, to hear a change in the tone of
the national voice, and an acknowledgment that things are beginning to
look a great dealbrighter than they have done. For ourselves we have
little care, though we like cheerfulness in our neighbours, and therefore
we have been indifferent as to “railway panics,” “monetary pressures,”
“pecuniary tightnesses,” “financial crises,” and all the other ills that
Commerce is heir to. We have always felt that if the worst came to
the worst, we could send Toby on to the stage, and let him take that
station among the dramatic dogs of the day to which his histrionic
genius would entitle him. We are convinced that in such pieces as
The Dog of Montargis, The Butcher's Dog of Ghent, and The Jolly Dog
of the Abruzzi, he would make a hit, or, to speak more appropriately,
bite his name in our histrionic annals. e would far surpass in
sagacity that popular but injudicious mongrel who, while performing
at the Victoria, lingered too long over the sausage that formed the
bell-pull. Our own dog Toby would never disgrace himself by such
an unprofessional neglect of the business of the scene; and therefore, as
we said before, the stage was always open to him if the worst had come
to the worst. Happily, the worst is coming rapidly to better, and even
Railway shareholders are beginning to wear a smile. We seldom predict
until after a thing has occurred; but we venture, on this occasion, to
anticipate for the country a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
What's to be done with the Serpentime 2
Every one agrees that the Serpentine must be got rid of, but no one
knows how to get rid of it. It would be vain to get a policeman to
invoke it with the exclamation-
“Flow on, thoushining river:”
for its stagnant state prevents any hope of the order being obeyed. We
know of only one way by which it may be absorbed and made serviceable
at the same time. Our plan is to use it as a substitute for the
“glutinous wash” employed to give their adhesive quality to the backs
of postage stamps.

PUNCH'S ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND
ON FINANCIAL REFORM.
My PEOPLE—as MR. ELLISTON used to call the British Public when
he was sober, or my Pippins, as he termed it when otherwise—I have a
few words to say to you about Financial Reform. There is a cry, and
a very proper one, for retrenchment; but let us take care that we do not
adopt that species of retrenchment which has been happily described as
the “reduction of useful expenditure.” . Let us cut our infinite variety
of Gold Sticks and Silver Sticks by making them cut theirs; and let us
go into particulars respecting the useless Generals who form some of the
most expensive and most unnecessary items of our Army; but do not let
us begin our retrenchment at the wrong end.
If in some respects we are too lavish, in others we are too niggardly,
and without meanness let us try to hit the happy mean. There are
many functionaries receiving
too much for doing nothing, º -
and many more receiving too
little for doing a great deal.
There is one class whom I
would call your attention to
as being, between you and
me and the post-I allude to
the postmen—most cruelly
ill-paid. The letter-carrier
who gives a double rap at --
your door has often not a
single rap wherewith to bless -- -
himself. His walk in life is frequently such a walk that it is a wonder
how he has a leg to stand upon; for he travels some twenty or thirty
miles a day, to the equal wear and tear of body and sole. For this, his
salary is a guinea a week; and in addition to physical fatigue, he has
to endure the mental tortures of TANTALUs, by money-letters frequently
passing through his hands. The rich Uncle in a farce, who gives away
a couple of fortunes in an evening, after having pawned one shirt to
pay for the wº of the other, is not more wretchedly situated than
the postman who has to leave large sums at other people's houses,
without having a shilling at home. Even a pig is thought to be worth
a farthing a mile for his travelling expenses on a railway; but a post-
man is frequently paid at the rate of five miles a penny, in the course
of which he has to knock at two hundred doors, make out one hundred
hieroglyphical directions, and be informed six different times, that six
different MRs. Joneses are “gone away, not known where.”
More need not be said of the hard lot of the postman. His knock
comes home to every man's door; and everybody will admit that a
reasonable addition to the postman's pitiable pittance, ought to be one
of the first steps of a really equitable financial Reform.

in love with the “merry sunshine” in a place
like London, where the object of one's love |
is so very rarely seen, and even when visible,
is so muffled, up in fog and smoke as to
º to a dreadful disadvantage. If our
affection is to be bestowed on any kind of
light, why should we not love the “jolly
camphine?” or some other object illumining
the dreary path of life, but with whom we are more likely to come in
frequent contact than with the “merry sunshine,” which we cannot
expect to see much of in a climate like ours.
If our song-writers were to make up their minds to love any light |
rather than the light of the sun, they would not be so likely as they
now are to give themselves up to a hopeless flame, or so unlikely to
have their passion returned with appropriate warmth. Even the rush-
light ...}repay devotion better than the sunlight; for in the case of
the former, should the rushlight itself expire, we may always cherish
with affection the shade of the departed.
The Loves of the Lights will be a memorable era in the history of
English Poetry. Our songsters are gushing with affectionate yearnings
for all kinds of lights, from twilight to moonlight; and, in fact, they
are apparently so dreadfully light-headed, that it is a º some member
of the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, does not kindly
come forward to blow out all their brains.

keeper, in some part of the room, exercises a professional control over
him. Nevertheless, these antics of DICKSON ought to be suppressed:
otherwise, who can answer for the mischief they may create * We
know how prone is a certain low, creeping mind to plagiarise a first
great thought. A Russell, for instance, cannot have his Ship on
Fire without a SMITH immediately coming out with a Barge in
Blazes ; The Maniac instantly produces The Beside Himself; and
The Gambler's Wife is inevitably followed by The Thimblerigger's
JWidow. Now, unless this profane tom-foolery, or hopeless lunacy of
Dickson be met by the proper authorities, we shall very soon not have
a single hero—whether of foolscap, gunpowder, or imperial purple—
wherewith to bless us. Allow Dickson his rant, and prepare to have,
in a very short time, announcements somewhat similar to the following:-
“THE NAPOLEON NONSENSE.-The lecturer is prepared to
prove that NAPOLEoN never existed in human form. e was no
other than a myth of the French Revolution.
He was, in fact, th.
original of the Jack-o'-lanthornplaying on the blood of a slaughter-house.
What we believe to have been NApoleon at Saint Helena, was no
other than a Grey Redingote, filled with the blast of a trumpet.”
“THE TALLEYRAND TARRADIDDLE.—There was no such
person as TALLEYRAND. Many Lives have been written of him; and
others are to be written; but the human thing we acknowledge as
TALLEYRAND, in fact, like all genius,
is a myth. An incarnate embodiment of the wakefulness of a weasel;
Hence, the Proverb–º Catch a

TALLEYRAND asleep.
“THE LOLA, MONTEZ LIE.—None but the most ignorant can,
for a moment, believe in the existence of a LoLA Montez. As easily
§. it, as make a feather broom from the tail of a phoenix. LoLA
oNTEz is, in fact, a myth. In very truth, the incorporated idea of
crinoline, diamonds, pearls, and coral; with roses and lilies in the
abstract, and castanets and bull-dog in the concrete.”
“THE WELLINGTON WAPPER.—Of course, as men manu-
factured NApoleon out of a myth, it was necessary to supply an ideal
conqueror of the aforesaid glorified Jack-o'-lanthorn. Hence the idea
of WELLINGTON. Hence the Wellington Boot, that signified the iron
heel of the victor. It can be received as no valid argument that the
bronze horse opposite ...'. House wears shoes and not Wellington
Boots. That defect lies at the door of the sculptor.”
“THE GEORGE THE FOURTH FLAM.–The King that en-
grosses so many pages of the History of England is, in truth, no other
than a mythic embodiment of the graces of the dancing-master, and the
work of the tailor. The oak leaves about his head merely typify the
wonderful power of a bow that, could beat all Europe. A certain
Welsh Bard, named BRUMLLLL, known to the learned by his Epic of

to the shadowy Man. For what does the monument signify, but
the Column of a Ledger? what, the folding-doors that lead to its
staircase, but Debt by Double Entry? As a climax, the assumed
figure of the Duke is stuck upon the top, as poetically illustrative of
i. principle, or rather want of principle, never known ‘to come

As worshippers of the heroes of our country, we trust we have now

THE OLD AND NEW CANTAB.
Possibly, a THERE's a fine old song for fine old gents, with fine old wine elate,
Of a fine old, etcetera—the rest I needn’t state;
And Punch unto that fine old air new-fashioned words would mate,
Of the fine old Cantab as he was before this change of late—
The fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time !
His rooms their range of ballet-girls and running-horses showed,
And a fox-brush, meant to indicate that up to hounds he rode; ,
There at vingt-un or loo he’d sit, until the cocks they crowed,
Nor ever thought of how to pay the various ticks he owed—
This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time !
From Eton or from Harrow he came cramm'd with longs and shorts,
An ambition to drive tandem, and a taste for fruity Ports;
And his hardest work was playing, till he deafened half the Courts,
Concertos on the Cornet, in keys of different sorts—.
This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time.
As a Freshman he wore sober ties, and gave a Don the wall,
But came out, his second year, in short coat and fancy shawl,
And treated the authorities with no respect at all,
Was seldom seen at lectures, and never dined in Hall–
This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time.
So he managed to forget the trifling all he once did know,
And by a very narrow shave got through his little-go,
| And then he took “a coach” with cram what brains he'd left to stow—
Arithmetic to the Rule of Three, and some Algebra, also-
This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time.
Thus, loo, lark, liquor, and late hours, made time and money fly,
Till when three years brought on the Poll, he was plucked disgracefully,
And his disgusted gov'nor came and paid off, with a sigh, .
Ticks to a tune which nearly sucked the poor old pump quite dry,
For his fine old Cantab of a son, one of the olden time.
But times are º: henceforth, we know; for, from eighteen-forty-nine,
The sons of Alma Mater must choose a different line;
And if you try the Muses round, not a lady of the nine -
Out of whom he won't be qualified with ease to take the shine—
Our fine young Cantab that’s to be, all in the future time.
For reading and not racing he’ll have to keep his book,
He'll blush at his own pink, and hang his tops upon the hook;
And if e'er he use a cue, 'twill be for motion's laws to look;
And for milk punch he’ll drink his toast—and water from the brook-
Our fine young Cantab that’s to be, all in the future time.
He'll put of the old Apax for the new one–ADAM SMITH;
Political Economy will bring private, p'raps, therewith:
At Ge—or else The-ology he’ll spend his pluck and pith,
Tea and Theorems ousting loo and lush, which will be all a myth
To our new Cantab that's to be, all in the future time.
Save for studying the pendulum he'll never try a tick;
A novel definition he’ll invent for the word “brick; ” .
Not one who braves the Proctor, or bargee can slang or lick,
But who digs up Hebrew roots like beans, and knocks off Morals slick-
Such our new Cantab is to be, all in the future time.
Old Dons will shake their heads, no doubt, and the good old days deplore,
When reading men were yoted slow, and lectures all a bore;
But still let’s hope that Cambridge will furnish, as of yore,
All the wisdom § our ancestors, and perhaps a leetle more, .
To the fine new Cantab that’s to be, all in the future time!

ON THE MORAL, SOCIAL, & PROFESSIONAL DUTIES
OF ATTORNIES AND SOLICITORS.
Delivered in the Hall (of his Chambers) by J. BRIEFLEss, Esq., &c., &c.,
BARRISTER-AT-LAw.
LECTURE IW.
IR,-In my last lecture I touched upon your educa-
tion; the field was, indeed, a narrow one: but to-
day let me say a word or two on manners, of
which the “gent., one, &c.” betrays too often a
sad deficiency. In the first place, you should avoid
flippancy, and fly the faintest shadow of a joke;
for, though the man who can make a pun might
pick a pocket, I do not think it is essential for even
an attorney to be au fait at this accomplishment.
You, Sir, have often been led into vulgar jocosit
at the expense of my clerk. I have heard you as
him when he would be out of his teens, and out
of his velve-teens. Nor have you scrupled to try
to catch the services of me—the old bird—by offer-
ing chaff to him—the younger one. Believe me,
that although the poet has told us,
“'Tis good to be merry and wise,”
it is not always wise, but frequently other-wise, to be merry. Let me
entreat you, Sir, never to forget the suaviter in modo, and recollect
that he will have little prospect of being able to keep himself, who
cannot keep his temper. You may undergo many trials from the
Very fact of your never being engaged in any trial at all; but recollect
that the man who allows his own judgment to go by default, will
meyer obtain the confidence of his client.
The violent action of irritability is an action against yourself. It is
you who will suffer the damages, and—oh terrible penalty upon an
attorney!—the party pays his own costs. You are the party; you are
your own legal adviser; and, as every man in this condition has a fool
for his client, you, Sir, are a fool!. How many cases I have known,
how many instances I have seen, which I might, could, would, or should
describe, if it were not that, for obvious reasons, I mightn't, couldn't,
wouldn't, and shouldn't.”
Shall I hint the possibility of an irritable “gent, one, &c.,” being
found impaled on one of his own files, or having devoted the whole of
his tremendous powers of attorney to his own destruction?
Avoid slang, and particularly in the presence of the Judges, even
when at Chambers; for, though the ermine is superseded by the
paletot, the judicial heart beats no less majestically beneath the
registered wrap-rascal of NicoLL, than under the ample crimson of
ADAMS AND EDE (late WEBB).f. Be careful not to put off the Chester-
field of politeness on such occasions as these. The Caxon f of private
life, may not be so imposing as the judicial horse-hair; the Jasey of
social intercourse may not have the pomp and stiffness of the official
head-gear; but you must recollect that—
“A Judge's a Judge for a’ that;”
and you must never indulge a presumptuous familiarity on the strength
—or rather, on the weakness—of the private wardrobe of a great
public functionary.
The unrobing of a Judge, like the unrolling of a mummy, takes
nothing from the venerable character of either. A Lord High Chan-
cellor, with whom I enjoyed the privilege of constant intimacy, and an
occasional chop; at the soirées of whose lady I have
“Stood amid the glittering throng;”
at whose banquetting-table I have sat among those
“Who deeply, deeply drink of wine;”
at whose matutinal breakfasts I have eaten the bread of friendship, and
laid on the butter of admiration; with whose card-rack and with whose
toast-rack I have been equally familiar—yes Sir, a Lord High Chan-
* Ma. Balkfless has in this case copied a learned predecessor on this subject, who
continually states that he is able to say a great deal, “only he doesn't ;” and who
thus gives the public to understand that, like that “honest fellow” Iago, he “knows
more—much more—than he unfolds.”
f The robe-makers at the corner of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street.
# Caxon and Jasey are two almost obsolete terms for two kinds of artificial
coiffure, which the “Real Gentlemen's Head of Hair,” or “Gentlemen’s Head of
Real Hair,” or “Gentlemen's Real Head of Hair,” and other similar contrivances
have superseded.
cellor, with whom I have been on those easy terms, has been, to my
knowledge, a purchaser of the humble highlow; yet no lawyer ever had
a more respectable standing than himself. Have I said enough to
prove to łº that the Judge en déshabille at Chambers, should be as
respectfully treated as the Judge en grande tenue in Court—his proper
sphere? Echo, through a million ophicleides, answers “Hear.”
Your intercourse with the Bar is a very delicate subject, and I had
rather let it alone—I mean, of course the subject; though in your case
I might add, “and the intercourse also,” without giving offence to the
class to which you belong. The relations between barristers and
attorneys require the nicest treatment. You know, Sir, that I abomi-
nate huggery; but when I have a gentleman to deal with, who is also an
attorney, I can avoid huggery without adopting any of the opposite
attributes of the bear. Nor do I admire those who, while keeping an
attorney at more than arm's-length in public, are in private “all things
to all gents.” (ones, &c.). I am not one of those, either, who consider
that a man once admitted on to the roll of attorneys, is at once struck
off the roll of humanity; nor do I look upon the Law List as essentially
the Black List of the age we live in.
It would seem like mockery on my part were I to lecture you on
exactness in money matters, when it is notorious that you, Sir, are
exactly the reverse; or rather, that your exactness consists in exacting
from me my labours without their equivalent—when you can. “Know-
ledge is Power,” and happily, my knowledge of you enables me to
prevent your making many more of these “points of practice” at my
expense. Learn, if you can, to be economical, not of money only, but
of time; and I will set you an example on the latter point, by telling
you, that as my time is valuable, I can spare no more of it at present,
and you must therefore go., I would have warned you, nevertheless,
against the consequences of doing things in a hurry; but, as I have just
remembered I have something else to do, I must advise you to hurry
off. Time, they say, is money, and therefore capital, which may be true;
but if you have nothing to do, your capital will remain idle, although
it is constantly going, and returning you no profit at all. This is my
case at present; so,
“Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.”
MUSIC FOR THE NURSERY.
IN consequence of the great demand that has lately sprung up for
Niminy Piminy Tunes for Namby Pamby, Players, and other musical
minutiae of the same class, it is in contemplation by the Mons. JULLIEN
to arrange a series of classical compositions to suit the nursery taste
that is now prevalent. The Maestro, who last year took a trip to the
Swiss mountains, for the purpose of picking up all sorts of instruments
to give effect to the Rang des, Waches, has this year been upon an expe-
dition to the Lowther Arcade, to collect the necessary materials for
arranging pour un grand, or rather pour un petit orchestre, the overture
to Fidelio, in which the penny rattle, the halfpenny whistle, and the
child's coral, will be intrusted to the respective mouths of BAUMANN,
Kºng and Richampson. It is intended to announce a series of
classical performances, under the name of Funny little º for Noisy
little Ninnies, and these will be succeeded by a set of Brobdignagian
Barcaroles for Boisterous little Baritones.

DisrAELI of the daily press, to
devote himself to the task of
collecting the curiosities of the
advertising literature of the

day gave a rich specimen, in the
shape of an advertisement, of a
Double Brougham, the lightest
ever known, and “built to the
order of a gentleman called out
of this country to be sold a great
bargain.” Are we to inſer that
the unfortunate gentleman has
been kidnapped for the Slave
Trade, or how are we to under-
stand his being called out of the country to be sold a great bargain?
We do not pause for a reply—if we did, we should never go on again.
Another advertisement, in the same day's paper, commences by
calling public attention to Native Oysters, which, it is added, are not
in perfection until they are six years old. We should like to catch an
oyster telling its age, and we defy any one else to ascertain the secret.
here is no judging by its teeth, and we are not aware of any other
criterion, unless the strength of the beard may be relied upon. It is
something new to us to be told that an oyster must be six years in
shell before it is worth opening.

JELLACHIGH, prepared to meet MessenhauseR, who relied on Kossuth
relieving him; but FRGEBEL advised him to retire to the Burgthor,
where LiMosich, with his Magyars, was waiting for supplies from

THE DIET OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.
A. the risk of our popularity—which is with us an infinitely
- minor consideration to the public good—we propose an organic
change of a tremendous nature in the British Constitution.
Plumply and plainly, without if or but, we recommend the
conversion of the House of Commons into a National Diet.
It has long been said that no business in this country is ever done
without a dinner. . We were going to instance Parliament as affording
an exception to this rule; but we find, on consideration, that it does
not. We say then, that every ...; of the House should be a public
dinner; and then, perhaps, there would be some hope of the despatch
of public affairs. In this way the Assembly of St. Stephen's would
become a bond ſide Diet. The following are the arrangements which we
suggest for adoption; and when they are adopted, we sincerely trust
that the evening's legislation may bear the morning's reflection:-
Tables shall be laid out separately for the principal parties, with the
legs of the mahoganies fi. firmly in the floor of the House, lest, in
the heat of discussion, the rival partisans should literally turn the tables
on each other.
The Bill of Fare for the day shall be appropriate to the Order of the
same. Thus, when the Poor-Law is to be discussed, it shall consist of
roast beef and plum pudding (with skilly and water-gruel for those who
other hand, the debate on the Estimates shall be taken upon cold
mutton.
Irish debates shall be preceded by the stew, Scotch by the haggis, of
the respective countries.
The business of the House shall not commence until after the removal
of the cloth. The Speaker shall then call upon an honourable gentleman
for his motion, which shall be proposed after the manner of a toast.
If the measure is one of reform or retrenchment, no Member shall
drink it who is not prepared to vote for it; but if it be for the impo-
sition of a new tax, or of a coercive nature, it shall in that case be
allowable to drink, by way of amendment, to its second reading that
day six months.
r
Each Member shall be strictly required to drink every pledge which
he has given to his constituents.
FreeTrade questions shall be debated upon French wines; those
relative to Excise over grog; but whisky shall on no account be intro-
duced when Irish affairs are under consideration. -
Foreign Policy shall be discussed upon iced claret, as the lightest and
least heating of beverages. . . . -
In deliberations upon University or Ecclesiastical questions, the
Conservative tables shall be supplied with champagne, and the Liberal
boards with choice old port, which will tend to produce that coin-
promise of ſeeling so desirable upon such occasions. . . -
No Member shall be permitted to drink till he has finished his speech
—with a view to the probable abridgment of the oration.
When a Minister is asked a question, he shall be bound to answer
it—or swallow a glass of salt-and-water. - - -
Should any Honourable Member so far forget himself, in the excite-
ment of debate, as to throw bottles, he shall be obliged to acknowledge
that he committed the outrage only in a Parliamentary sense.
The allowance for each individual shall be a bottle of wine; but a
power shall be vested in the Speaker to license certain gentlemen to
drink as much as they please—there being some of them whom it would
be desirable to prevent from remaining on their legs. , A, similar
privilege shall be extended to the Premier, on the principle, “In vino
peritas.”

To do what you have went & dome!
My trembling Andamost refevses
To write the charge which SIR JOHN swore,
Of which the CountEss he ecuses,
Her daughter and her son in lore.
My Mews quite blushes as she sings of
º ſatle charge which now I quote:
He says Miss took his two best rings off,
And pawned ’em for a tempun note.
“Is this the child of homest parince,
To make away with folk's best things?
Is this, pray, like the wives of Barrins,
To go and prig agentleman's rings?”
Thus thought SIR JOHN, by anger wroughton,
And to rewenge his injured cause,
He brought them hup to MR. BroughTox,
Last Wensday week as ever ways.
If guiltless, how she have been slanderd!
If guilty, * will not fail;
Meanwhile, the lady is remanderd
And gev three hundred pouns in bail.

WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE EARL OF CARDIGAN ?
THE EARL or CARDIGAN, who has so often figured at the
bar of public opinion, has been once more brought before that
Court, charged with the old offence of tyrannical and insolent
conduct to one of his officers. The present plaintiff is the
Hon. CAPTAIN Noel; and the particulars of the case are
motorious. Of the treatment which he received from the
noble Lord, CAPTAIN Noel, complained to the Commander-
in-Chief, who decided that it was so well merited that he ought to
apologise to the EARL ºf CARDIGAN. This the gallant Captain declined
to do, probably not seeing how he could apologise for his word having
been denied, his manners sneered at, and himself turned out of the room.
In deference to the decision of the Duke of WELLINgron, we will
suppose that Loºp CARDIGAN, in this matter, has acted and spoken
like an officer, a nobleman, and a gentleman. Otherwise, we should
have regarded him as having decidedly exhibited himselfin what Bottom
calls “ERCLEs’ vein-a tyrant’s vein.” We might have been tempted
to pursue the analogy between the EARL of CARDIGAN and Bottom,
whose “chief humour” was “for a tyrant,” and who was denominated
by his comrades, “Bully Bottom.” - -
But we will assume that his Lordship was in the right. No doubt,
at least, he has kept on the safe side of martial law. We cannot,
however, help asking how it is that the EARL or CARDIGAN is
constantly at variance with somebody in his regimentſ? Whence comes
it that, as the Bishop of Exeter has always,some undutiful curate, so
he has ever some refractory officer on the grill?
Is the circumstance ascribable to peculiarity of temper? If so,
what is it that has soured his disposition? Can it be an ungratified
longing for military distinction? Is his Lordship the young Norval
of the 11th Hussars? Has he “heard, of battles,” and sighed for
unattained laurels? Is he tanțalised by the sight of decorations and
medals adorning the breasts of Peninsular and Indian officers?... Nay,
we trust not. Perhaps he suffers from some physical source of irritation.
Is he troubled with a corn? Or is his general health qut of order?
Is his liver in fault? That must be it. Then why does he not try an
Antibilious Pill? Why not drink Taraxacum Coffee? He should
consult SIR JAMEs CLARKE, or DR. CHAMBERs. We are convinced he
must be very ill. Poor Loºp CARDIGAN! We pity him very much;
indeed we do. He is the victim of bile and indigestion. His food
disagrees with him, and hence he disagrees, with his, ºfficers. The
Duke of WELLINgton is not the man to deal with his case. The
proper person is the Surgeon to the Forces. If the EARL of CARDIGAN
will take a little medical advice, the 11th Hussars may become quite a
pleasant regiment. Thus tenderly have we touched, LoRD, CARD1GAN;
whereas it may have been expected that we should have hit him hard.
But his Lordship is not one of those persons who have no friends.
The issue of his affair with CAPTAIN Noel shows that he is exceed-
ingly well befriended at headquarters.

THE UNLOYAL ONE.
We formerly used to hear and read a great deal about 3 Hatti Scheriff;
but if ever there could be a necessity for the interference of such an officer,
now is the time. The nightly demolition of hats at Drury Lane, Theatre is
something so tremendous during the shakes, solos, ad libitums, and encores of
God Save the Queen, that (we have it on the authority of one of the charwomen
of the establishment) there are at least six dust-pans full of old beaver to one of
orange peel to be removed every morning after the performance of the preceding
night. The little bit of clever fingering on RICHARDson's flute costs many A
samer its existence; for, the impossibility of keeping the gossamer elevated
in mid-air, brings it down on to the devoted head of its owner, and immediately
three thousand voices, joined with four hundred fists, a score of walking-sticks,
and six umbrellas, reduce the hat to an untimely gibus, in spite of the remon-
strances of the bonnetted occupant. When Jullien gives the signal for a da
capo, many a hat is converted into a sort of night cap (oh) by a crushing process,
which reduces it to the consistency of a mere bonnet de nuit.
One would think that the notorious HATzoff, the great enemy of Polish
independence, had arrived in this country, and taken a season ticket,for
JULLIEN's Concerts, in order to oppress the Polls of this country, and violate
their liberty, even when under the shelter of the British hat or crown. The débris
of devastated chapeaux would make a monument to SIR.THQMAs BEEvoR, and the
pile of velvet maps that have severely napped it, would, if woven into a Carpet,
make several hundred yards of velvet pile. , If God Save the Queen should run
through the season, with all its absurd and tedious yariations; if, in fact, its
glorious notes are not paid in short, to that bank of loyalty, the British ear,
the hat will disappear from the head of the playgoer, for no one will be anxious
to play the victim in the farce of Smasher and Crasher, which is performed every
night, not only at the Adelphi, but at Drury Lane.

Rather Showery.
We have had our showers of frogs, and of lady-birds, and of locusts, and of
blacks, and of hail the size of small paving-stones, and other things that do
not usually turn up on the top of an umbrella; but a French paper puts the
English newspapers completely out, in the way of showers. The Réforme
publishes a shower of Fire / . If this shower really fell in France (and we would
not doubt it for the world), we should say it was only the commencement
of the reign of the République Rouge, which wishes to carry fire everywhere.
However, this sort of shower has been pretty general lately, all over the
Continent.
We would much sooner have a shower in London just at present, than
one in Vienna or Berlin. We must confess we have a weakness with regard
to showers, and when we have one, we like it to be “cold without,” instead
of “warm with.” We preſer taking it “meat,” and do not think a shower
is much improved, after the French recipe, for having a regiment of soldiers
“just to take the chill of.”
A REMONSTRANCE FROM CUFFEY.
WHAT do you mean, my Lord John Russell,
To do with me and MR. Fussell ?
You put us down without a tussle—
We only bluster'd;
Whereas you see that SMITH O'BRIEN,
The QUEEN's authority defyin',
Agin the Unicorn and Lion
bellion muster'd.
Well, you’ve convicted him of treason;
It seems that clemency’s in season,
For he, no doubt, for some good reason,
Ain't to be martyr'd;
Oh, no! you mean to spare his wizen,
The traitor's doom will not be his'n,
Dragg'd on a hurdle from his prison,
Hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd.
Now, if he isn't executed,
Why ain't my sentence, too, commuted?
Your justice will be, sure, disputed
By all the nation,
If, of a smaller crime convicted,
I’m to have mine in full inflicted,
Served out, with rigour unrestricted,
With transportation.
I own my crime—I’m punish’d rightly—
I know I ought to cº it tightly;
But yet my Lord—don't weigh it lightly—
I ask you whether
The gaol, at least, don't level stations,
Ranks, and conditions, and gradations,
Rendering all in our situations
Convicts together?
Fair play, your Lordship, is a treasure:
Deal with us all in equal measure;
Spare SMITH O'BRIEN at your pleasure,
- But unto RUFFY
Show the same favour, and to Rooney,
To Jones, to Fussell, and to Mooney,
And me, unhappy, crack-brained spooney,
Poor little CUFFEY.
WHAT IS A POUNDP
SIR Robert PEEL, some time ago, puzzled the world in
general, and himself in particular, by asking, What is a Pound?
We believe the Right Honourable Baronet, like the green-
grocer's boy with his master's little account, is “waiting for an
answer;” and, taking pity upon him, we offer the following
solutions of his rather quaint query:—
A Pound—of cherries sold in the streets, is eight ounces.
. A Pound—of raw sugar is ten ounces of saccharine to one
ounce of brown paper and five of sand.
A Pound—of arrow-root is twelve ounces of pure radir
sagittae to four of chalk.
Pound—on the stage,'is one brass button, or, when in the
shape of small change, it is ten gallery checks.
A Pound—of waste-paper sold at a butter-shop, is twenty-
four ounces.”
A Pound—of mutton-chops, is nine ounces of meat to four
- of flank and three of bone.
A Pound-cake is a shilling and upwards, according to its size.
We hope SIR Robert PEEL will find these answers to his
question of “What is a Pound?” perfectly satisfactory.
A Dish for a Jesuit.
MR. STEINMETz, in his recently published History of the
Jesuits, tells us that IGNATIUs Loyola “used to fast every day
on bread and water, except Sunday, when he would eat a few
herbs, boiled and mixed with ashes.”. We have heard of a
glass of water with a cinder in it, but ashed herbs are a
novelty not to be found in even SoYER's code of cookery.

DEATH OF THE EARL OF ROBINSON.
(In the manner of a popular Necrographer).
T is cur duty to record this morning the demise
9f a nobleman who has for some time held a not
insignificant position in English politics and
society. AUGUSTUs GUSTAVUs ADOLPH.Us SMITH
EARL, Wiscount AND BARon Robinson, expired
a quarter-of-an-hour ago at his house in Bel-
grave Square, where indisposition, had of late
detained his lordship. His son, the Wiscount
SMITH, at present third EARL of Robinson,
was immediately sent for from Paris, where his
lordship is staying. The death of the second
= Earl will no doubt be a shock to the present
= nobleman; but as his Lordship inherits Castle
Robinson in Yorkshire, Robinsonburgh, Mayo,
the rich paternal estates in Norfolk and Suffolk,
and the funded º: which is very con-
siderable, his grief will probably be of trifling duration. ..
The family of the Robinsons is rather numerous than distinguished;
nor can the biographer of the race discover that they were remarkable
for talents or wit, or for public or private virtue. The founder of the
House was known for many years by our ancestors as Cock Robinson,
and his juvenile escapades with SMITH, and BRowN, and Jones, were
long ſamiliar subjects of public talk. Cock Robinson was a creature
of ALPoLE's, and accused—not without justice, probably,– of
repeated malversations of the public funds. ... He was Deputy of the
Pewter Closet, did not retire into private life without carrying with
him some of that metal over which he had the charge, and was created
a Baronet by a clever but certainly not squeamish minister. This SIR
HAycock Robinson died in 1764, and was succeeded by his son SIR
GEORGE Robinson. - - -
SIR GEORGE represented Robinsontown in Parliament, and in-
creased the family estate, not by any genius or talent of his own, but
by an economy which was pushed perhaps beyond the bounds of manli.
ness; and, above all, by marrying the immensely rich daughter of
WoolEY BRown, Esq., of Tobago. The absurdities of the lady and
the niggardliness of her husband, formed matter of fun for the wags of
the day; and cheese-paring Robinson and the whitey-brown heiress
have had the honour of some satirical verses from the pen of Top HAM
BEAUcLERC. GeoRGE III. is said to have been shocked when the
BARoNEss Robinson was presented to QUEEN CHARLOTTE at Court;
and cried out “Black, black; didn't know she was a black woman.”
However, Robinson was a baron. The votes which he commanded,
and which were at the service of LoRD North, LoRD RocKINGHAM,
the Lord Keeper CECIL, and indeed of every Ministry—and the lucky
demise of the black heiress, raised BARON ROBINsoN to an Earldom ; at
which period, though stricken in years, he consºled himself by marrying
a very young lady–ARABELLA, daughter of HIcks, fifteenth Earl of
Blenkinsop, who subsequently ran away from his Lordship.
The subject of the present memoir, AUGUSTUs GUSTAvUs ADoIPHUs
(then the Hon. G. A. A. Robinson), in the year 1799 entered the House
of Commons, when QuiBERoon capitulated, LoRD NELson engaged
the Spanish Armada, MR. Huskisson brought in his Turnpike Act,
MR. TIERNEY made his celebrated speech against the Pig-tail Tax,
and the one-pound note question was raging. On neither of these
questions did the new Peer think fit to speak from his place in the
House of Lords; nor indeed did he open his lips there—a proof of
discretion on his |Lordship's part, for nature had endowed him with but
a feeble brain, and he had the sense to be aware of his utter mental
inefficiency. It is a pity that, in this respect, some of their lordships
would not take pattern from the EARL of Robinson—a pity, too, that
that nobleman's own incapacity was such as to lead them justly to
mistrust him.
The young nobleman was educated—if that may be called an educa-
tion where a man can barely write his name (and LoRD Robinson
could not be said to have gone much further in the practice of ortho-
graphical learning)—at Eton, and subsequently at Christchurch. It is
needless to say that he took an honorary degree. The Continent
was as yet open to our aristocratic youth, when the young man
achieved the distinction just mentioned, and the young Peer took the
grand tour of Europe. A quarto volume was published, with some
observations on Hecla and Stromboli, by Wiscount SMITH ; but it
was known that the work was written by the REVEREND BARING
LEADER, his tutor, and afterwards Bishop of Bullocks MITHy—a man
neither conspicuous for preaching or practice, and who might be called,
by the severe, a disgrace to the Church.
In person, LoRD Robinson was corpulent rather than athletic,
and ungainly without being strong. He was marked with the smallpox
in infancy, and by that disease deprived of an ... His lameness was
the result of a subsequent accident. His Lordship lished, and could
not pronounce the letter R. M.R. CANNING's lines about “Wobinthon”
will probably be remembered by our readers... They are to be found
in that clever but overrated Miscellany, the Antijacobin.
He was sent to negotiate the Treaty of Straalsund, when the capitu-
lation of Magdeburg gave some hopes to the Allies (though it may be
supposed that a person such as LoRD ROBINSON was merely a cere-
mony, and that the work was really done by subordinates), but the
negotiations, whatever they might, have been, were interrupted by the
best reason in the world—MAck’s victory. The battle of Pultawa,
Count TILLY's brilliant engagement, with MIRoLADovich, and the
sudden burst of NApoleon into the Ukraine and Swedish Pomerania
with an army of five hundred thousand French, Poles, and Italians of
the Old Guard, abruptly ended the conference, and sent the diplomatists
to the right-about. Lord Robinson narrowly escaped capture in the
frigate the Arethusa, which brought him from his mission. She was
chased and engaged by the French ship the Belle Poule, in the Bay of
Bengal, and the particulars of the action are narrated in JAMEs. His
Lordship was not complimented for his courage in the affair—but he
was a civilian, and suffered greatly from sea-sickness.
In 1811 his Lordship married BLANCHEFLEUR, the beautiful daughter
of HARQUEBUss, Duke of FITZBATTLEAXE. GILLRAY's caricatures of
the pair are still to be seen in the portfolios of collectors. Suffice it to
say, their union was not a happy one,
The pleasures of the table appear of late years to have been LoRD
RobinsoN's only passion. His dinners were the most splendid given
in this city, and were frequented by those who contributed their wit in
return for his entrées. * Lordship's mind did not enable him to
appreciate the former, and it is owing to a too great indulgence in the
latter that he has been called away from a world which will not very
much miss him.
With all his splendour LoRD RoBINsoN was said to be stingy, and,
though dull, he was not good-natured, as are some stupid people. His
deafness of late years still farther excluded him from the enjoyment of
society. But beyond these º little can be said in his dispraise.
So long as his tenants paid their rents, he did not annoy them. He
cannot be said to have cheated his tradesmen, to have picked a pocket,
or to have robbed a church; nor, on the other hand, can it be stated
of him that he invented gunpowder or set the Thames on fire.
PICKFORD A MYTH.
It was Bishop BERKELEY, we believe, who denied the existence of
matter—a doctrine which taught us to look at everything as perfectly
immaterial. We really shall begin to think there is something in this
great theory of nothing, for lectures are being given by a gentleman
who ignores SHAKSPEARE altogether, and maintains that there never
was such a person in existence; so that, if he never lived at all, the
house he lived in must be, a fortiori, a castle in the air. It is difficult
enough to believe that the Swan of Avon, whom we have all been so
accustomed to run after, is a mere nonentity, involving us in a wild-
goose chase; but it is still more perplexing to hear, as we heard the
other day, from a letter in the Times, that, there is no such person as
Pickford, and that PickForp is an idle fiction, a stretch of the
imagination, a creature of the fancy, and, in a word, a myth. We can
scarcely credit the possibility, that PICKFORD, whom we have always
imagined as a sort of luggage ATLAs, carrying the whole world of heavy
goods upon his shoulders, should be a mere name, without a living
representative.
Our faith in the reality of everything is shaken when we find PICK-
For D, whom we always regarded as leading the van of civilisation, to
be nothing more than “a mockery, a delusion, and a snare.”. After
this, we feel that seeing is necessary to believing, and we shall doubt
the actuality of even BARCLAY &
EDGAR, unless they one and all give us “the proof, the ocular proof,”
by coming forward in propriis personis and proving their respective
identitles.

EDUCATION IN THE ARMY.
WE observe by the papers that it is in contemplation to oblige per-
sons seeking a commission in the Army to undergo an examination as to
their qualifications, in the same manner as candidates for the medical
and other professions. This is quite right. Of two professions so
similar in their objects, it is strange that so much should be required to
qualify for the one and so little for the other. But henceforth the pill
and the bullet are to be placed on the same level—the lancet and the
sword in the same case. The soldier will no longer receive his license
to kill (any more than the doctor) without having first taken out his
diploma. Degrees will, of course, be granted to the candidates for
honours—the M.R.C.S.'s (Members of the Royal College of Soldiers)—
so that we shall have another squad of M.D.'s, F.R.S.'s, &c., these
letters representing respectively Mad Dragoon, First-Rate Sclaier, &c.
The only objection that occurs to us as likely to be raised to this
new project, is, that it may cause a number of extra professorships to
be created, and so lead to some jobbing. If we thought this, we should
decidedly º “As you were with that motion.”. But, as many of the
professors of our Universities have plenty of leisure time, they might
undertake the duties of the new office. The Church Militant might
perhaps spare some minor canons to teach the young military idea how
to shoot. By way of assisting the new professors, we beg to give the
following as a specimen of an examination for a young cornet:-

%
DISCOVERING THE LONGITUDE.
The extreme length of the American Sea Serpent may be in a degree
estimated from the astounding fact, that it has been running through
the papers now for a month, and we have not seen the last of it yet.
THE SEA SERPENT.
By the “Observer's.” (and our Own Correspondent.
We have reason to believe—though we will not pledge ourselves,
because we have an objection to being pledged—though we are often
taken in-that a Sea Serpent, or something like it, has been seen some-
where by somebody. As we make a point of believing nobody's eyes
but our own—not that we can always depend on those without our
spectacles—we are unable to say, with certainty whether the Sea
erpentreally exists; not that we deny its existence—far from it; for
we should be sorry to throw a doubt on anybody's words, or to deprive
an innocent creature of its life; for if none of our readers would
“Rank among his friends the man
Who needlessly would set his foot upon a worm,”-
we are sure that nobody would rank us among his friends, if we need:
lessly set our foot upon a Sea Serpent, which we are determined
not to do. From our own peculiar sources, which are no secret,
for they are open to all the world—if, indeed, the world takes the
trouble to look—which we don't say it does, though we won't say it
mightn't, if it liked—we have ascertained that the Sea Serpent is
something like a horse, according to some, and according to others,
“very like a whale.”
Professor Owen, with whom we do not pretend to be intimate,
though we don't feel called upon to explain whether we are intimate with
him or not—which has nothing to do with it, although we have stated the
fact, which we have a perfect right to do, if we think right, and we care
not who says we are wrong—thinks it was a Seal desirous of taking an
ice, and looking out for an iceberg. This seems doubtful, for few would
think of taking ices in autumn; at least, we should not, but we do not
say that Seals have the same tastes as ourselves; but we are wandering
from the subject; at least, if we may be said to have had any subject in
view when we set out with admitting that we never saw the Sea
Serpent at all.
Though it may be doubtful whether there is such a thing as a Sea
Serpent in real life, we have good reason to believe, on the best possible
authority, which is, after all, the proper authority, and no other autho-
rity ought to be called upon to act. And this brings us to the point
we were going to mention, which relates to acting, namely, that the Sea
Serpent will most likely figure in one if not two, and perhaps three-
supposing there should be as many as three, which we are not in a
situation to say—of the forthcoming Christmas Pantomimes.
We might, per-
haps, add, it we were
isposed, and we
don't know that we
are not disposed; at
all events we cannot
be called indisposed,
for our health at our
time of life was never
better, that the Sea-
Serpent will figure on
hearth-rugs, dressing-
gowns, neck hand-
kerchiefs, and other
articles of daily con-
sumption-supposing,
at least, that a neck-handkerchief can be fairly called an article of con-
sumption, when it is notorious that consumption is prevented by keep-
ing the throat warm.

VERY HUNGRY COMMISSIONERS !
oUBTLEss reading a report in the Times is believing ;
or else it would be impossible to credit the extra-
ordinary statement, that, at a recent meeting ofthe
Court of Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers,—
" A letter from MR. BATEMAN, lately one of the Com-
missioners of the Holborn and Finsbury division, addressed
to the EARL oF CARLIsLE, was then read, complaining that
the Metropolitan Commissioners had refused to pay a sum
of money ( é94 16s.) expended at a dinner which some of
2,- 2 the Commissioners of that division had at the Albion
- Tavern.'*
- Ninety-four pounds sixteen shillings expended
# at one dinner by some of the Commissioners !
Gracious goodness ! how much would have been
devoured at one meal by the whole lot of them ?
i If they can clear cesspools as well as they can
plates,, the sewerage of Holborn and Finsbury
must be excellent. How could they possibly
manage to consume between minety and a hundred
pounds',worth of food and drink ? Did they call in the assistance of
their subordinate sweeps and scavengers ? Why, the wine they must
have drunk would have sufficed to flush their sewers as well as them-
selves. They have outdone HELIoGABALUs if not HERcULEs. We
know nothing to match such enormous gluttony, except the effrontery
of asking for the payment of the cost of it at the public expense.

SOFT SOAP AND CIVIC SEWERAGE.
A REPORT on the state of the civic sewerage has been lately published,
addressed, to the City Remembrancer. The document has been com.
piled by MESSRs. WALKER, CUBITT, and BRUNEL; but its authorship,
we think, will be ascribed wholly to WALKER. It declares London to
be the best drained city in the world, the sewerage to require very
little extension, the sewers themselves to be :.. clean, to need no
alteration, and to have been constructed economically. It decides that
the attempt to divert the flow of filth from the river is hopeless. It
assumes that sufficient improvements in the metropolitan drainage will
be made from time to time, as heretofore, which will be quite sufficient.
It cºndemns both of the plans of sewerage which have been suggested
for Westminster, as inapplicable to London. In fine, it asserts that
to cleanse the City hardly anything is wanted beyond a little more
water. All this must be highly satisfactory to the citizens, and MEssrs.
WALKER, CUBITT, and BRUNEL will savour in their nostrils more
agreeably than anybody would suppose they could, after the peculiar
researches they have been engaged in.
. Qur own engineer has furnished us with a report on the same sub-
ject; which embodies in a few words both the substance and the spirit
of that above referred to. It is simply this:—
“Your humble servant has explored all the sewers in the City, and
pronounces, them incapable of any improvement in size, form, or
arrangement. His nose has been unassailed, his boots unsullied, during
his progress. He considers the City of London better drained than
even the national pocket, and the purity of the sewers to exceed the
roverbial cleanliness of the whistle, or the new penny. The result of
is, investigation is, that he can only suggest that now and then,
Pº they might be advantageously flushed with lavender-water.
“Your humble servant is nevertheless of opinion that the sewerage of
the City, should be inspected from time to time, and respectfully recom.
mends that he himself should be engaged, at areasonable salary, to do
the job; in the performance of which he trusts he has proved that he
is likely to meet the views of his employers.”
SONGS OF THE LONDON TRADESMEN.
No. I.--THE TAILOR'S SONG.
My pal'tot now is register'd,
My beautiful, my fair;
You cannot test its quality
Unless you know its wear.
Had you been standing at my door,
You might have seen arrive,
Six thousand of the overcoats,
And all at one pound five.
The sculptor’s chisel all in vain
Might with my cutters vie;
If PHIDIAs could live again,
He’d fail were he to try.
Its durability is such,
No change it ever knows; .
My pal'tot, like a good man's life,
Is brilliant to the close.
No. II.-THE WINE MERCHANT'S SONG.
WHILE merry Christmas is approaching
Through old November's fogs,
My wine I quietly am broaching—
The heads of several hogs.”
I’ve Port than penny loaf more crusty,
And Sherry bright with gold;
Marsala, too, in bottles dusty—
Proof that the wine is old.
I’ve exquisite and choice Madeira,
Round which the cobwebs twine,
As if to mark the distant era
Of laying down the wine.
I’ve Cape from fifteen pence or lower,
If tastes should that way tend ;
I of the vines can trust the grower—
I’m proud to call him friend.
When METTERNICH, amid the fury
Of Revolution’s shock
Was hurl’d to London, I assure you
I purchased all his Hock.
His terms were cash, and I consented:
Those terms are therefore mine;
But you will be, like me, contented,
When you have tried his wine.
A Political Malaria.
M. CR£MIEUx, the Ex-Minister of Justice under the Republican
Government, declared, a few days ago, that “the Revolution arrived
because it was in the air.” The air in question seems to have been one
of those very ill winds that blow no good to anybody. It stands a very
fair chance of going away by the medium which brought it, and dis-
solving into air of the thinnest description, though not without some
breezes of a very heavy character. Most great scourges are accounted
for by saying that they are in the air... The Cholera is, we are told, in
the air, and we are not surprised at the French Revolution being a
creature of the same element.
Child's Dissolving Views.
THE above series has been enriched within the last fortnight with a
valuable addition, that is likely to be very popular amongst all judges
of chiaro-scuro. The subject was “The HoN. CHARLEs FITZwilliam
expressing his views to the Electors of the West Riding.” The prin-
cipal figure came out at first very boldly, standing prominently on the
foreground; then it got fainter and fainter, lost colour, became very
confused, gradually grew obscure, kept retreating more and more, till
all of a sudden it disappeared, and no one, could tell where... It is sup:
pºsed it was withdrawn by the hands who were pushing it forward.
The exhibition was a very short one, but afforded a deal of amusement
to those who witnessed it.

For his wholesome suggestions to the public, and his honest pro-
posals to individuals—for his comprehensive benevolence, which would
take everybody in, we owe something, to this respectable pundit, and
shall endeavour to pay the debt in kind, by a judicial opinion on his own
particular horoscope, as displayed in his annual. We have there
the Sun in the Seventh House, threatened by Saturn. Our Astrologer
himself is under the Sun, and may be regarded as one of the greatest
humbugs beneath it. ... By the menace of Saturn may be understood an
intimation from an officer of the detective police, who has an eye upon
MR. SIDROPHEL, and tells him, that he had better mind what he is
about. In the Fifth House, the Moon appears in conjunction with
Mars, which signifies that a cook-maid, under lunar influence, has
reposed her affection upon a Grenadier Guardsman." The relations of
these planets show that the cook, will consult the Astrologer on the
subject of her attachment to the soldier. In the Sixth, Mercury is lord
of the scheme, denoting that Mercury, as the ruling star of roguery, will
Preside over the design of the fortune-teller on the servant's pocket.
The Seventh refers to the success of the swindle, which appears doubtful.
Jupiter, afflicted in the Eleventh House, shows that the master of the
domestic is suffering from depredations on his larder, and other larcenies,
committed by the young woman’s military follower; many legs of
mutton mysteriously disappearing; unaccountable consumption of butter
and cheese; divers chickens and lobsters run away with by the cat.
Mars on the º of the Fourth, squaring Venus in Taurus, foretokens
the Grenadier in the Bull, Inn, carousing on the proceeds of his court-
ship—the money out of which he has done the confiding maid. Doubts
and suspicions on the part of the girl's master, who is applied to for
an advance of wages.
The conjunction of Saturn and Mars in Aries foreshows the meeting
of the policeman and the soldier at the area, whence the former is
ascending with a roast duck under his arm in a napkin, . This combi-
nation of malefics will occasion woe to the Astrologer. All is discovered.
It turns out that the cook has for a long time been robbing her master,
in order to feast her grenadier, in the expectation, fostered by MR. SI-
DROPHEL, that the fellow would ultimately marry her. She has spent
her last farthing, and pawned her clothes besides, to meet the Astro-
loger's demands...Mars, afflicted in the same House, with the Sun,
indicates the soldier and the fortune-teller together at the House of
Correction, whither the former is committed for theft in a dwelling-
house, and the latter as a rogue and yº, and a receiver of money
under false pretences. In short º read in the aspect of the
stars a disastrous"six months” for SIDROPHEL.

postors | Let them tº: reason to conjecture the future, and

A CHURCH AS COLD AS CHARITY.
To the EARL OF GUILDFORD.
My LoRD, -
- YoUR Lordship's name, I am sorry to tell you (in a letter
signed “Just1tia”) has again appeared in the columns of the Daily
News. I believe you do not like to see it in print. Your Lordship has
long possessed a seat in the House of Peers; but nobody, from having
read the Parliamentary Debates, would be aware of that circumstance.
You are evidently, my Lord, averse to notoriety.

nished, with a stove, is at this season of the year extremely cold and
somewhat damp.”. This, my Lord, I understand is true; although your
Lordship, for the best of reasons, may not be aware of the fact.” Could
you separate your secular from your clerical personality, your cloth
from your coronet, your Lordship from your Reverence, and occasionally
come and edify from the pulpit that brotherhood over which you pre-
side, you would be satisfied of the coldness and humidity of St. Cross
Church. Thus far Justitia does not belie his name. But, my Lord, he
proceeds to say:—“The parishioners lately petitioned the church-
wardens to remedy this evil; and the churchwardens, in their turn,
applied to the reverend Earl,” meaning your Lordship. ... His con-
siderate and charitable answer to the application was, that “since the

PICTORIAL CONCERTS.
If this is an illustrious it is illustrious chiefly for its illustrations.
Nothing goes down, or, rather, nothing can be got up, without pictorial
aid, and to take effect a hit requires to be made a “palpable hit,” by
tableaua and such tangible means of taking the public.
Some vocal professors have been, or are giving, a series of illustrated
concerts in the provinces, each song being accompanied by poses
plastiques of an appropriate character, and “Here's a health to the
Queen, God bless her,” has been got up with a bumper of real Burgundy,
and for “those who prefer it champagne ; ” while the rare old ballad of
“Ye shall walk in silk attire” has been superbly mounted with the
interior of a silk mercer's for a sort of background, to which the singer
points with extreme tenderness in the direction of a large bale of
goods ticketed “Look here ! real Spitalfields, five and tenpence three
farthings.” - - -
“He loves and he rides away” is being prepared as a sort of scene in
the circle with a real horse, richly caparisoned, and “Rise, gentle Moon,”
will shortly be produced, with a superb illustration of day going down,
on a broad billow imported expressly from the Baltic, to give com-
pleteness to the illusion: “Upon his heel he turned,” which turns upon a
truly pathetic pivot, will be relieved of its more sorrowful features by
an effect something like the following.
upon HIS HEEL HE TURNED.
That's the way the Money goes.
In the midst of an eloquent article on Ireland, the Times, the other
morning drew a fearful picture of the death of an Irish tenant's pig, and
it followed up the mournful description by the startling exclamation-
“With his pig goes his rent,”
We have heard of the dish running away with the spoon, and, for the
future, we shall look upon the pig going away with the rent as a
companion incident,
parishioners have always done without a stove they may do so now.”
ANTS A PLACE—The IMPERIAL Eagle.—It can have a good character
from its late master, one Napoleon Bonapants, but is disgusted with its
present service. It can boast of having never shown the white feather, excepting
on one occasion at Boulogne, where its disgraceful flight was owing to a chain of
circumstances over which it (the Imperial Eagle) had no control. It is still strong,
and capable of achieving the highest flights. Any one who has a yacancy for it.
and will only promise to treat it with common respect, will be conferring a great
favour on an old bird, who can stand fire, hunger, cold—anything but ridicule. A
line dropped at the Colonne, Place Vendôme, will be attended to as soon as the
Imperial Eagle has recovered from a slight attack of pip, under which it is at
present labouring.
N.B. No objection to travel, having been in its time all over Europe.

PICTURES OF THE REPUBLIC.
“Six hundred designs in painting and sculpture have been sent in for the allegorical figure of the Republic, intended to adorn the Hall of the Assembly.”
UP, sculptor, painter, one and all, from the grand prize of Rome,
To seediest rapin, spoiling paint and canvass nearer home,
For bare life and bright laurels, to work, each mother's son;
Paint us Republics by the mile, and mould them by the ton.
Canvass and clay—fit stuff, methinks, for such Republic be,
That best may match the poplar stumps, her trees of Liberty;
But speed your work—for an ye shirk, before her likeness done,
The goddess may have disappear'd from underneath the sun.
So, as ANACREON invoked the Rhodian painter's art
To set forth in her loveliness the lady of his heart, -
Let Punch invoke the skill that lies in Paris' arts and arms,
To show the world La République in all her various charms.
Come first, young RAFAEL, moyen age of vest and hat and head,
You’ll dash in your Republic in a rusty ground of red;
A red-capp'd dame, half fishſag, half fiend in mould and mien,
And in the distance MARAT's bust, crowning a guillotine.
Flung at her feet, Humanity, crush'd 'neath “the rights of man,”
To Reason's blindfold goddess lifts his blind eyes as he can;
Force, on her right, from Justice the balance wrests, and shows
Her sword to the old lady, red with blood—but not her foes’.
And here another picture—of a more decorous hand,
Whose Republic is more lady-like, with attributes more bland;
Whose artful drapery scarce conceals the lilies on her shield,
While from beneath the bonnet rouge a crown peeps, half revealed.
THE REPUBLICAN MEDAL,
That third red cap surmounts a face, which tho’ of whiskers bare,
Methinks that we have seen before, in a different kind of wear;
A Republic to the red one that owns neither kin nor kith,
May be heard of about Claremont: address plain “MR. SMITH.”
And yet one more, whose Phrygian cap somehow assumes the form
Of a small three-cornered hat, that once beacon'd through battle's storm;
With tunic loop'd above the knee, that to the curious gaze |
A high historical jack-boot unblushingly displays.
Observe the attendant Eagle, “as natural as life,” -
With bon-bon thunderbolt, inscribed “Boulogne and Strasburg strife.”
The one fault of the picture is, it shows, beneath its hat,
No head; but hark, the crowd's remark—"C'est trai; but what of that f°
And here, in rear of all the rest, the true Republic see,
No figment vain of artist's brain—sad, stern reality;
A painted harridan, whose show of strength but mocks the tale
Told by those palsied hands and cheeks, thro' all their plastering, pale.
That which she wears for armour, is a strait-waistcoat, meant
To keep from harm those frantic hands, 'gainst her own entrails bent;
The gag that rends her frothing lip is kindly used to tame
The blasphemies she would put forth in Freedom's sacred name.
|So paint her, painters, as she is—your Republic in her youth,
Graced by no senseless symbols that lie against the truth;
Fence her with swords from her own sons, and let her motto be—
| “Behold, all nations of the Earth! what I am, be not ye.”
John Bull taken by the Hand.
SoMEBODY advertises something for everybody's hand, which, if it
possesses half the virtues imputed to it, should not be allowed to slip
through anybody's fingers. The nostrum which professes to make the
hands perfection itself, should be invaluable to such men as Lord
BRough AM, who is a bad hand; at statesmanship; Mr. Peter Borth-
WIck, who is a bad hand at a speech; MR. ChishoLM Anstey, who is
a bad hand at an impeachment; and a few others we could name, who
are very bad hands at everything. The new specific undertakes to fix
the seal of elegance wherever it is applied; but we do not see how seals
are to be affixed to our hands, without burning our fingers. The in-
Yentor of the preparation undertakes to restore delicacy of touch to
those who have lost it—a quality which must render the article in-
valuable to those engaged in pursuits of a light-fingery character.

ADWER T I SEM. E.N. T.
A^ GELA has merely to observe that THEODORE may, possibly,
* judge what she suffered on Tuesday week, when she could not take the
Brixton bus. The horrid Influenza had decimated the family, and ANGELA
was a sufferer: even now she drops a tear to think of it.
REPORTS OF OUR FINANCIAL REFORM
ASSOCIATION.
EconoMy and retrenchment are great things'
and very much wanted in all departments'
We are delighted to see the higher offi-
cials, Under-Secretaries, Assistant-Secre-
taries, Senior Clerks, and so on, showing
the deepest conviction on this point, and
a perfect willingness to diminish the
expenses of their various offices by a most
vigorous and disinterested reduction in
the salaries of their under-clerks, porters,
and messengers.
An excellent public servant contributes
this evidence to the Report of our Finan-
cial Reform Association:—
MR. PENGUILLIAN, examined:—“Is
Assistant-Secretary of the Treasury, at
a salary of £2,500 per annum. Has very
important duties to discharge, and dis-
charges them. Thinks himself uncom.
monly cheap at his salary, but has no
- \ –- doubt that the expenditure in his depart-
** ment is profligate and unnecessary. A
great many clerks are employed. Their
salaries vary from £80 to £400 per annum. There are also a number
of messengers fully employed at £1 per week. Their hours are from
eight till eight, or as long as there is anything to do.
“Has a plan for reducing the expenditure in his department. It is to
take off 25 per cent, from all salaries under £80, and between £200
and £400. -
“Would not reduce those between £80 and £200, as they are received
by young gentlemen of family, who generally get diplomatic or other
appointments after a few years' practice in the office. . It is very
important to have such a class of young men in the public service.
They are very regular at their offices.
“Believes they read the newspapers very diligently. It keeps them
out of mischief. , Looks to the older clerks to do the work. The
latter are not a class expecting or requiring large remuneration, They
are modest men in their way of living. Thinks they would gladly
consent to the proposed reduction, as it is for the public service.
“Would reduce the messengers to 15s. per week. Has no doubt they
would be more active at lower salaries, and that they feel it the duty of
every poor man to make any sacrifice which lightens the burdens on the
poor.
“Would not propose any reduction in the salaries of heads of depart-
ments. Considers himself the head of a department. The prospect of
ultimately attaining such places is very encouraging to the inferior
clerks, and therefore the places ought to be good ones. Believes there
is an instance of an inferior clerk having risen to an Assistant-Secretary-
ship, but will not be sure. A very superior class of men is required for
Assistant-Secretaryships. Believes any reduction whatever in the
salaries of Assistant-Secretaries generally, and himself in particular,
would be attended with very mischievous consequences.”
. It is truly delightful to find this active spirit of retrenchment abroad
in one class of our public officials. , But the clerks, themselves, as a
body, are by no means actuated by the same admirable zeal for
economy which distinguishes their superiors. The subjoined letter,
from one of this profligate order, shows at once their ingratitude to
those above them, and their inability to comprehend the true interests
of the country:—
(Confidential.) “Treasury.
“SIR,--I have been a clerk in this office for twenty-two years.
I began at £80, and have got up to £300. I married MRs. D. when I
reached £250, and we are now the proprietors of a happy family of five
little D.'s. I grieve to say, it has lately been rumoured in the office,
that we clerks are to be cut down twenty-five per cent. MR. PEN-
GUILLIAN told me so, with regret and indignation. Upon my word
and honour, Sir, this is too bad. I do not consider myself an
over-paid man. I should have done better in the Bank of England.
There’s not a merchant’s house in the City whose stools ain't better
stuffed, literally and metaphorically, than those the nation finds for us
in the Treasury. And I find it hard enough to get along as it is. I’ve
done my duty, as the office books will show, and have brought up my
arrears regularly to the end of last week. I don’t deny the nation is
heavily taxed, and am as ready as any man to do my best to ease it.
But it is bitter, Sir, to come down from £300 to £250, aſter twenty-two
years' hard, homest, and regular service.
“After all, if they half-starve the batch of us, the reduction won't
tell as much as if they knocked off a couple of Lords. There are five
of 'em, and the Black Book will tell you what their salaries come to;
and what they do but sign warrants, and stir the fire, an hour or two
per diem, most of 'em, would puzzle a wiser man than I to tell you.
“However, it's a comfort to think our excellent Assistant-Secretary
will cheerfully submit to the same privations as the rest of us. Ah,
Sir, that’s a man! The way he works, to be sure—and the style he
refuses anything like extra pay for it. Lord John little knew his man
when he offered him £2500 for the Irish business of last year. He took
it, to be sure, for we all saw it in the Estimates, but you must have
remarked the number of small sums paid in since to the CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequer as ‘Conscience money.” I could guess where
they came from, I think. I wish the country could have the benefit of
his advice in the matter. We shouldn't be having the poor clerks and
messengers cut down then, I know. -
“Meantime, . Sir, Economy is a good, thing; but Economy isn't
Shabbiness—it isn't getting work done under the market price—it isn’t
pinching the little people, that the big ones may go on at large pay and
small work. In short, Sir, I wish you to ask John BULL to look, not
only at the sum total, but at the items—and as he is anxious that the
saddle should be put on the right horse, to take care that the salary is
not taken away from the wrong man.
“Yours, respectfully and resignedly,"
“John DoCKET.”
This letter, we say again, appears to us prompted by a most abomi.
nable spirit.
IIGHTS I LIGHTS! I SAY!
InstEAD of there being the slightest chance that wonders will ever
cease, we have strong reasons for thinking that wonders have only just
begun. The last new marvel is a Company for lighting our streets, our
shops, our houses, and even our bed-candlesticks with electric fluid, so
that we may sit, and read or write by flashes of lightning, and go to
sleep with a column of electric fluid doing duty for a rushlight in our
room. The new lights that have sprung up within the last few years
have been extinguishing and snuffing each other out in rapid succession.
The first breath of science blew out the dips, which fell prostrate under
the wax of discovery, and then came the metallic wicks, offering
“metal more attractive” than the cotton, of whose existence ingenuity
has at last cut the thread. Chemistry then took the candles in hand,
and superseded with the composite fashion the once popular “mould of
form,” until the public, having nosed the presence of arsenic, stopped
its mostrils and its patronage. The electric light now threatens to
supersede all, and considering the universal use now made of electricity,
we should not be surprised at the formation of a Company to fix, a light-
ning conductor instead of the ordinary conductor to every omnibus.

Punch ON THE CONSTITUTION.
CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.
PROGRESS OF THE constitution UNDER ELIZABETH and JAMES THE FIRST.
We are compelled to linger a little longer than may be agreeable to ourselves, and
perhaps even to our readers, over the historical portion of this great work; but
when we come to contemplate the British Constitution in its entirety, the feast will
well repay the trouble and pains of preparing it. As we cannot eat our Christmas
pudding until our suet has been shredded, our raisins stoned, our eggs beaten
to the utmost extent of battery, our lemon-peel subjected to the grater till nothing
can be smaller, and our sauce of gravy made with an anxiety equal to that of the
Queen described by VIRGIL as “gravi saucia curá;” so is it impossible to banquet
upon our Constitution as a delicious whole, until the parts are cut and dried—a
process in which the driest pºrts shall be cut as short as possible.
Our “great and glorious” Constitution is generally admitted to have been in the
course of construction until the “ditto and ditto.” Revolution of 1688, and we must
*...* proceed by progressive steps to that important epoch in our national
1story.
ELIZABETH is said to have advanced the cause of liberty, though it must be
admitted she did so on the old scholastic principle of thrashing the child to promote
its happiness; for she was about as arbitrary as she well
could be; and, among other things, she forbade the Com:
mons liberty of speech; though this attempt to get all
the talk to herself was more the act of the woman than of
the sovereign. - - -
Parliamentary garrulity has always been an evil, as it
is at the present day; and if QUEEN, Victoria, were to
emulate Elizabeth in the attempt to abridge the length of
the legislative wind, her present MAJESTY would have the
thanks of her subjects for an endeavour to cure the Mem-
bers of the Commons of that chronic flatulence to which
they all seem painfully liable. The Virgin, Queen, if she
knew when to storm out, had the fact to know when to
draw in : and though she checked the loquacity of the
Parliament, she could not stifle the voice of the People.
The clampur against monopolies, caused her to abandon
several of them, particularly that relating to salt, which
was very unsavoury, and was ever in the public, mouth;
and another on the subject of ruffs, which º to take
people too much by the throat, and caused them to be not a
little ruffled.
It was in this reign that the Commons, first asserted
their right to decide on matters touching their own elec.
tions—a right which has degenerated into the practice of
treating every disputed return as a mere question of party,
to be settled by }. Committee in favour of the side that
chances to be the strongest. -
JAMEs came to the English throne intending to play the
º: of an absolute king, but he must have been little
etter than an absolute fool to expect that such a game
could be played by himself, when a very superior sovereign
had so recently failed in the effort. In 1620 a Parliament
met, which," according to RYMER, who never wrote a rhyme
but was full of reason, “took the shine out of this JEM,”
by a most spirited reply to a royal threat of punishment.
The Commons told him plainly that they should say and
do exactly what they pleased, which so displeased James,
that, sending for the Journals of the House, he tore out,
without a “with your leave” or “by your leave,” the leaves
containing the protestation alluded to. He dissolved the
Parliament, caused Coke, a Member who was burning
with patriotism, to be shot down into the cellar of the
House, and imprisoned several others. These proceedings
were so arbitrary, that an opposition to the Court was, for
the first time, raised in #. Upper House; and among
others, SAY declared himself ready to do, while SPExces
hung on at the skirts of the liberal party formed among
the Aristocracy. -
Instead of tearing º: out of the House of Commons,
Journals, it would have been better for James had he taken
a leaf out of his predecessor's book; for ELIZABETH knew
how to use power without sacrificing popularity, while
JAMEs, who was perpetually babbling about his divine right,
was rapidly sending the monarchy to a destination we cannot
think of mentioning.
Something that is better Felt than Described.
THE little émeutes that take place every evening at Dru
Lane, whenever God Save the Queen is being drummed,
ophecleided, piccoloed, and fluted through, have had a great
effect upon the Hat-trade. We need not tell our readers
that there are numerous individuals, for whom we can find
no better term than Polar Bears, who object to remove their
chapeaua when the National Anthem is played. The con-
sequence is, that the democratic hat is instantly taken, well
shaken, and tossed, in less than a minute, into a pancake.
Bulletins might be published every morning of the number
of hats that have been killed or wounded in the campaign
of the preceding evening. The slaughter lately among the
beavers has been very terrific; and the hatters intend, as
a mark of gratitude, to present Julties with five new hats
—that is, a hat apiece for each of the bands that are
engaged every night to make more noise than has been
heard since WERDI’s Attilla.
There never was known an instance º of so great
a flatness in any trade being succeeded y such a rapid rise
as that which has lately fallen upon the hat department, for
the flatter hats are overnight, the higher they rise the next
º; Many habitués, in the fast walks of life, go now
with gibuses, which they allow persons to flatten as much
as they please. But others, of an elderly turn, do not take
it so smoothly. In the meantime, Julliºn is delighted
with the great success of this new issue, in Numbers, of the
Heads of the People.

CEASE, RUDE BOREA(LI)S.
We have been all last week dreadfully haunted with a Bore-alis, which
has been flitting about the country in a most extraordinary manner.
reverend gentleman at Stonyhurst has been reading let-
ters by it at nine o'clock at night, without the aid of a
bit of rushlight, or even, a morsel of moon, and other
people, in other places, have been sitting up until the
dawn of Aurora herself, in order to watch for Aurora's
friend, the Borealis, who has been forming a series of
brilliant back-grounds to our country’s scenery. We
ourselves were thrown into a state of excitement and
alarm the other night, in driving up to our own door, to
find a luminous appearance at the back of our abode, which
caused us to imagine the whole of the southern side of
our premises was in flames; and, without asking a ques-
tion we rushed to the nearest fire-office—three miles off
—and returned accompanied by an engine, the pumps of
which were on the point of being brought to play upon
the Aurora Borealis, when the truth, and a meteoric
streamer, flashed upon our eyes.
These Aurorae Boreales have presented themselves
under very different circumstances, and in one case the
eye of science found its socket suddenly filled with a large
stick, while, contemplating a quantity of fiery streamers
accompanied by cracking noises of a most mysterious
character. The stick, on examination, proved to resemble that of the
rocket, and tends to show how much the fireworks of nature resemble
our own.
We ourselves, while rambling in the recesses of Rotherhithe, were
deceived by a grand halo, which we had booked as the Borealis, until
closer inspection convinced us it was the finale to a grand display of
fireworks, on the occasion of the
last gala of the season, at the
Cow and Cribbage Board, in the
neighbourhood of our stroll.
A NEW TURN IN MENDICANCY.
THE kerbstones of the Metropolis are now invaded by a squadron of
hearty, jolly-looking sailors. They are in the regular T. P. Cooke cos;
tume—the glazed hat, the two curls, the ruled shirt, the loose tie, and
the full breeches without any braces. There they stand, with their
hands in their pockets, which they only take out to pat on the head
occasionally a poor shivering child, whom they station before them.
The child is generally very pretty, with a clean pinafore, and carefully
curled hair, and has a cºi tied with a silk riband round its neck;
This cardboard informs the spectators that the child is “motherless,”
or that his “brothers and sisters are starving at home.” At night, the
hardy sailor holds a candle, to make the mockery of misery all the more
apparent. The child then shivers with cold in reality, and the pennies
flow in most abundantly, the brave British tar holding his hat to collect
the stream of charity.
The exhibition is a most painful one, and, however profitable to the
parties interested, ought to be suppressed. There must be an infant
training school for beggars, somewhere in London, with regular
appointed professors, to instruct, children in the cunning tricks of
mendicity. These sailors are evidently Masters in the art, who have
taken all their degrees of roguery, and grown ſat upon them, and the
children evidently are their pupils, . It is time that some inquiry were
made into this School of Vice; and, in the meanwhile, there could be
no harm in examining one or two of these sturdy nautical, beggarly-
professors.
It is very curious that the Mendicity Market is ºrigged” almost
exclusively with sailors' Does this arise from the fact that when a
A|ship has i. off its crew, that all the men are literally sent a begging?
e
or is it the only employment on land that is open to a sailor? It is
º however, that they should be allowed to drag children along
W1 em.
THE “ BRITISH LABOURER '’ AT ANDOWER.
I'M STEPHEN WITCHER, labouring man—of Andover I be,
A pauper of the workhouse, and a cripple in the knee;
The Guardians there have sent me out, here, in the cold and rain,
To zit all day, a breakin' stones in agony and pain.
I've arm'd my living honestly and fairly all my life,
And zo, till lately, did suppoort a vamily and wife;
I broke my thigh some time agoo, but still I struggled on,
Notwithstandun that 'a left me wi' a 'largement o' the bone.
But, twelvemonths gone come Christmas, I was cuttin' of a tree,
When, by ill luck, my axe did slip, and open laid my knee;
The neighbours put me in a cart and took me whoam to bed,
Wherefrom 'twas full five months afore I liſted up my head.
Lame as I was, I couldn't work; zo what was I to do?
Unto the Boord o' Guardians I at last was foced to º
“Oh! WITCHER,” says the Chairman—he's a parson, Ishould say—
“We’ll relieve you for a vortnight, but no longer—not one day.
“For when that time is up, you must turn to at breakun' stones.”
“Why, Sir,” says I, “you can't tell what I suffers in my bones;
If I do butput my foot to ground it pierces to the heart.”
“We aint got nought to do wi' that,” he says, and bids me start.
Then I went unto the Doctor, for to beg and pray of he
For to spake a word o' kindness to the gentlemen for me--
For my wife and little children's sake some º, to beseech:
He said he shouldn't alter. That was MR. DoCTOR's speech.
Zo then I went to CAPTAIN PooBE, an order for to beg
For the Hospital at Winchester, to cure my dreadful leg:
The Captain—thank him kindly—took and wrote un then and there,
By which means I got admitted under MUSTER MAYo's care.
Five weeks I bid in hospital, and there I had...I’ll own,
The very best o' tendance and o' skill as could be shown;
But, erysip'las breakin' out, as I was ill and wake
They zent me whoam again, for fear the 'fection I should take.
I left wi' a certificat from Doctor MAYo's hand
(Long life to un), which gave the Union, Boord to understand
I wanted warmth and nourishment, in clothin' and in food,
If ever they expected for to do me any good.
To the workhouse on my crutches then I hobbled back again,
And begg’d and pray’d for mercy, but my words was all in vain;
So here be I a crackin' stones in misery, and grief, -
And this here treatment’s what they calls their “System of Relief.”
Oh! gentlefolks, I don't purtend to be alarned man,
But I’ve lately had the news eapers read to me now and tan,
Them going on in Wrance, I thinks, should tacheye to beware
How ye drives the lower classes, as ye calls us, to despair.
Think well upon’t, ye Lords and Squires, and rulers o' the land;
Asºtis, there baint much love that’s lost between us, understand;
The time may come when you may wish that you had know’d aſore,
That kindness is the only means of keepun down the poor.
The New American Liner,
Now sailing daily between London and New York.
THE astounding phenomenon of two vessels having seen , the
American Sea Serpent within so short a date, (almost the same day)
and yet at such extraordinary distances from each other, is accounted
for now, by the very simple circumstance that one vessel saw the head,
whilst the other only saw the tail of this decidedly the longest monster
that is known—on record.

THE CAREER OF “THE COMING MAN.”
AN anxious public has long been patiently awaiting the “Coming
Man,” and in all probability will have to wait for him considerably
longer. In the meanwhile, imagination may expaliate on the prospect
of the wonders which are to be worked by this Wizard of a yet unde-
termined point of the compass. It is generally understood that the
object of his mission will be to set all things to rights, and to arrange
affairs, political and social, to the entire satisfaction of everybody. To
this º he will necessarily perform the following prodigies :-
He will increase the incomes of farmers, and augment the wages of
agricultural labourers, so as to enable them to support themselves and
their families in comfort, and to lay up a provision for their old age,
without in the least diminishing the rents of the landlord.
He will provide constant employment and ample, pay for all opera-
tives, at the same time not limiting the profits of employers, or checking
them in the slightest degree in the pursuit of gain. He is to confirm
Capital in all its advantages, and invest Labour with all its rights. He
must render unlimited competition compatible with universal success,
and individual aggrandisement with general prosperity.
He will secure legal redress alike for rich and poor; nevertheless
allowing forensic ...i. to command its price in the market.
He will combine the encouragement of British industry and the con-
sumption of British produce with the freest importation of manufactures
and luxuries from abroad.
He will guarantee, in perpetuity, the payment of the interest of the
National Debt without any inconvenient demand whatever on national
exertion. He will gratify every desire for the reduction of taxation,
and yet maintain the revenue, and our civil and military establishments,
on a scale commensurate with our greatness as a nation. He will make
Ireland happy and prosperous, independently of any co-operation from
the Irish themselves, or of pecuniary assistance from this country. He
will give a simultaneous predominance to all sects and parties one over
the other; and thus, it may be hoped, he will effect the pacification
of that hitherto distracted land. . He will cause the prerogatives of the
Throne and the privileges of the Aristocracy to coexist with the fullest
popular rights; to the contentment of all classes of politicians. He will
reconcile the extreme of luxury on the part of the few with the absence
of privation on that of the many, and will furnish a subsistence to the
helpless and the unfortunate at no cost whatever to the able and the
opulent. . He will fully supply the wants of everybody, without obliging
anybody to practise the least self-denial.

ONE of the Professors ||
who arc engaged to make ||
science popular at so much
or so little a week, is giving ||
daily lectures on the philo- ||
sophy of an empty bottle.
There does not seem to be
a great deal in an empty
bottle at a first glance, but
we dare say the Professor
will contrive to put a little
spirit into the empty bottle
if he determines to go regu-
larly into it. A good deal
of philosophy is sometimes
required in reference to a
bottle which has been paid
for as a quart, but which
turns out to hold scarcely a
pin', and is indeed compara-
tively an empty, one. We
shall be very glad to have a
crack with the Professor
over his bottle; and, though ||
the subject may be a difficult
one, we dare say we shall be
able to break the neck of it, I
“BOYS WILL BE BOYS.”
It is supposed that the
young Candidate for the
West Riding was induced to
offer himself to the electors
by... the popular saying,
“There’s a good time
coming, boys.”
Having accomplished these marvels, he will retire from the world,
and contract himself, publicly, amid the acclamations of the multitude,
into a quart-bottle ; wherein, absorbed, like, BRAHMA, in beatific con:
templation, he will suffer himself to be exhibited in a shrine provided
for the purpose by a grateful nation, to an admiring posterity, for ever!
Walking on the Slopes.
WHAT are the sº which the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT are said
to be continually walking on ? We are by no means levellers, but we
nevertheless should like to see these Slopes put in such a state that
HER MAJESTY and Consort could pursue “the even tenour of their
way” in their matutinal perambulations. To say nothing of the diffi-
culty and the discomfort of walking continually on the slope, we are
sure it must cause the royal pair to take occasionally a sort of one-sided
view of things around them. By way of exercise, a promenade on the
Slopes may be all very well, for it must require a hopping movement
that would naturally create a wholesome muscular action; but on the
whole we think an even surface would be preferable for the morning
walks of the Sovereign.
No Work, no Wictuals :
“‘IF any man,” says MR. CHARLEs PEARson, writing on the subject
of prison discipline to the Court of Aldermen, “will not work, neither
shall he eat,” is a law of GoD, as applicable to a prisoner as to any
other member of the community.” Does the rule also apply conversely?
Only suppose it to be enforced in Belgravia. Alas!
inhabitants of that fashionable district should we behold extended on
the pavement in front of their own areas, the flagstones beside them
emblazoned with the piteous inscription, “I am starving!”
Anticipations of Christmas.
THE small wine-merchan's are already putting fºrth their, large
placards, announcing their “Golden Sherries at 28 shillings,” and their
“ pale ditto,” full of anything but “ineffectual fires,” at twenty-five

prime Port at six-and-thirty, “just fit for laying down.' ...We have
tasted it; and, thºugh it is certainly “fit for laying down,” it is by no

NAMES OF SHIPS.–H.M.S. “NATIONAL DEBT.”
ERTEs the Post is fortunate in
its correspondents. One is
very indignant that—
“There are two ships building, to
be called the Sanspareil and the
Niobe. Now, Sir, why should a new
ship have a French name to be pro-
nounced by a British tar How awk-
ward it will be, too, for the Sanspareil
to be passed at sea, or beaten And
as for Niobe, it is at best a most un-
fortunate name: and, if omen's go
for anything, does it not tell of
striking on a rock, from the sad me-
tamorphose of Niobe into a stone *"
This is really very fine—very
suggestive; and awakens a
train—long as the sea-serpent
—of salt-water thought., We
say to the Lords of the Admi-
ralty, reform your ships' names;
re-christen your ships; and
when we say re-christen, we
mean give them names worthy
of a Christian nation, and of
the meek, well-beloved Christian
clergyman who is rated on the
ship's books. Let us have a
momenclature soft and sweet as
oil and honey. Bethere no more
Thunderers, and Devastations,
and Furies ; but Lambs, and
Lady-Birds, and Turtle-Doves.
Why should a bomb-ship be
called the Blazer £ Why not
the Balsam & The Cornucopia would suggest sweeter thoughts of peace and plenty, as she threw her
shells upon roofs and magazines, kindling a town into one huge bonfire—much prettier thoughºs. than
the Hecla or the Strombolo. Why have we the Sulphur & Why not the Heart's-ease fire-ship?. Is it not
preposterous—indeed, a matter of mockery—to float a clergyman of the Established Church on board the
Thunderbolt, when his creed and his office only assort with the Balm of Gilead? These things must be
altered. e propose a general re-christening of all. HER MAJESTY's ships that carry bad names; and
beg the established Clergy—(of those members especially, who talk of the “God of Battles” as though
the true weight and odour of religion were to be found in ball-cartridge)—we beg of them to select a
batch of beautiful names, so that all HER MAJESTY's navy may, in our association, sit like so many
halcyons on the wave.
And Punch, in return for this large suggestion, merely begs this small privilege: the right to give a
name to one ship; and the name he proposes is the National Debt. This, of course, must be a ship of
the line, and the longest known line. #. weight of metal to be carried will be enormous. She will
always fire gold shot, with bank-note wadding. Her gunpowder will be corn of the very finest grain,
transmuted by the magic of the tax-gatherer. Her crew will be º men—picked from the highest
names and deepest º: of the Civil List. Wery distinguished pensioners and sinecurists must
compose the body of her officers. These will wear an uniform peculiar to the ship; the cloth of patriot's
blush (if the colour can be hit upon), worked in various places with little vermicular £ s. d.’s in gold lace.
Such men as the Duke of MARIBoRough and the Duke of St. ALBANs, will, of course, bear
commissions. There being no Royal hawks, St. ALBANs will be rated on the ship's books as Hereditary
Grand Albatrosser...Now and then, we should compel the CHANCELLOR OF THE Excheques to turn
his attention to the Sinking Fund, which, in our amended terms, we would call taking a hand at the pumps.
We think this magnificent ship, the National Debt, would please ‘all parties; for the eminent men who
declare our National Debt our National Safety, would behold their opinion magnificently embodied in
Punch's mighty three-decker... Moreover, there are many, meanings and qualities in a ship of the line
called the National Debt. No power in the world would think of touching her. No power would
think of depriving us of her—of boarding her—of cutting her out, and cutting her down;, and again, the
§§ Debt would never be paid off; though occasionally she might, oddly enough, be found upon
e Stocks.
THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS.
THE postal population has been thrown into a state of fº. excitement by our exposure of the
wrongs of the letter-carriers, whose case completely destroys all our pleasing illusions of a life of lettered
indolence. The London postman has his grievances, but they appear to be light in comparison with the
burdens imposed on the letter-carriers of the provinces. The metropolitan functionary does get his guinea
for his hundred and eighty miles of walking per week, but the rural Mercury has to “go further and fare
worse,” for he obtains only fourteen shillings a week, and his promenade is greater in extent than his
London fellow-sufferer. There is every reason to fear a general rising of the general postmen, for the
purpose of establishing a republic of letters, and effecting their own early delivery from their present
state of ill-paid serfdom. They are resolved, like the letters they carry, to be “free,” or at all events, they
will no longer consent to be treated as mere dead letters, and ignominiously stamped upon. The authorities
may soon be awakened to a sense of justice by a tremendous postman's rap—for even a letter-carrier's
patience must be nearly exhausted, when the application for an increase of pay has been “hung up’ for
the last eighteen months, under an assurance “that the subject of fixing a scale of pay is under the
consideration of HER MAJESTY's Post-master General.” This dignitary is entitled to the utmost
consideration, no doubt, but to keep
a hard-working body of men a year-
and-a-half in suspense about their
means of existence, is rather incon-
siderate. We have taken up the post-
men's cause, and shall always be
found 'at our post when our good
offices may be required.
MORE LAST WORDS.
Who killed the sea-serpent P
“I,” said PROFEssoR Owen,
In Zoology so knowing;
“And I killed the sea-serpent l”
Who won’t say “die” to the serpent?
“I,” said CAPTAIN McQUHAE,
“I stick to what I say;
And I won’t say “die” to the serpent.”
Why couldn’t it be a serpent P
'Cause Owen’s never seen one.
Has there, therefore, never been
one :
Why couldn't it be a serpent P
What was’t if not a serpent?
We know it wasn't a seal,
And 'twas too big for an eel,
And it certainly was a serpent.
There’s six of us saw the serpent,
With a mane upon its back,
And a tail and not a track;
And we'll all swear to the serpent.
PUNCH ON SOLITUDE.
THE Solitudes of Southend are
about to be invaded by a railway. We
recollect we were the first to lay down
this projected branch. The Surveyor
was the Buoy. at the Nore. #.
pointed to the Pier as the finest bit of
wooded country that could be picked
out, ready cut and dried, for such a
purpose. Its length, he held, Was SO
extensive, that some communication
was absolutely necessary to make both
ends meet. His valuable hint, it
seems, is to be carried into effect.
Trains are to run, every time a fresh
packet comes in, that is to say, once a
day. , Cheap excursions, we have no
doubt, will in time be started, and mur-
sery-maids and children will be taken
by these easy means out to sea without
experiencing any of the unpleasant
effects of sailing. These aquatic trips
—for they belong more to the water
than the land—will .# Southend
much nearer to London, for it took
formerly almost as long to walk the full
length of the pier as to go by steam
º NICHOLson's Wharf to the top
of it.
This mode of conveyance will be a
very great improvement upon the old
arm-chair with the sail at the back,
which was the only vehicle that for-
merly connected Southend with the
Ocean, and was certainly the most
cruel method of being driven to extre-
mities that a patient man could be
subjected to. e are sure Southend
will advance rapidly into something
like a civilised watering-place as soon
as the immense distance that divided
it from the approach of man, and kept
all human intercourse completely at
bay, is cleared in sufficient time to
enable a visitor to reach the Royal

THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.-SHAMEFUL EXPOSURE
OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
“MR. PUNCH,
- “I, with thousands, have to complain of the Electric Light.
It is an invention impertinent and presumptuous. No other than a
clear attempt to destroy the vested interests of a revered institution of
darkness, old as Nox—and an undisguised intention to abolish the stars
in a twinkling, and take the entire shine out of the moon.
“And where is this Electric Light displayed as ‘a first experiment
out of doors?’. Why, Sir-T take my authority from the newspapers)
– in front of the National Gallery. Now, there is something heart-
less, cruel, in the choice of such a place. Why, as a sweet poet says,
why ‘drag its frailties from their dark abode,’ buried as they are for
\|some hours of the four-and-twenty in the obscurity of the sky? And
§. ‘the light was so placed as to illumine the whole of Trafalgar
Square, the rays reaching as far as Northumberland, House. The very
lion at the top winked at the blaze.” This is shameful... Are the
fountains of the Square to have no peace? Are the nymphs that reside
there to be compelled to confront a light that makes them, as the writer
declares, ‘conspicuous as at noon-day?’ Is this fair? Is it humane?
Is it gentlemanly It was some consolation to think that—at night,
at least—the National º was covered up in darkness, and so pro-
a
tected from the sneers and -
crowd our streets. But with the Electric Light, the Gallery is sport
for the stranger any hour of the four-and-twenty. And this evil is
#: means Fº balanced by a few of the advantages said to be
obtained by the ſight over gas; though, as a lover of justice, I will not
suppress them, as, from the mouths of certain people, they have
strangely reached me.
“One gentleman (by the aid of the Electric Light) said–. He could
read writing that had entirely escaped his naked eye. Standing in the
Square and pulling out his washing-bill, he saw written at the bottom,
the word paid. Thought very highly of the Electric Light.”. -
“Another gentleman, who before had the highest opinion of his
cook, saw, as far as the Horse-Guards, the aforesaid MARY Jones
handing up a pigeon-pie to the mounted guardsman. Could swear
to the pie. Thought the Electric Light would be a great agent in
public morality. -
“LoRD NElson, by the aid of the Light, could see so inconceivably
far into the future, that he saw his Pillar completed.
“All the pictures in the Vermon Pit saw themselves most infa-
. placed. Hitherto, they had been wholly in the dark upon the
subject.
“GeoRGE THE FourTH (in bronze) saw himself as he is seen in
history; and thought the Electric Light impertinent and disgusting. .
“The Duke of York (on the top of his Column) saw all his unpaid
bills, and conceived the Electric Light to be a shameless invasion on
the sanctity of private dealings.

excellencies into utter darkness. Not that I have any interest in the

ADWICE TO SPANISH BONDHOLDERS.
SPANIsh Bondholders, robbed by Spaniards—who are so proud that
they scorn to pay-listen to the advice of Punch. Listen; be righted;
be remunerated.
GENERAL NARVAEz, President of the Council, has prigged, since 1843,
a quarter of a million of money.
Mon, the Minister of Finance (avers the Times) has prigged no less.
SART.orius, the Minister of the Interior, no less.
This, then, oh Spanish waste-paper holders, is the advice of Punch.
Set up a crucible. Catch NARVAEz, Mon, and SARTORIUs, and (after
the manner of the Jewess) pitch them into the aforesaid crucible. Blow
the fire; and when the Ministers are dissolved, skim the dross, and
pocket the gold that has run from them. -
If we say nothing of QUEEN ISABELLA, it is from no squeamish
gallantry; no desire to save her; but from the fact that she is beyond
the test of the crucible, inasmuch as she was never known to melt.

SoME fellows are
going about the
country with a lot
of inferior ds,
which they declare
they are commis-
sioned by the
QUEEN OF ENG-
LAND to sell off
# consequence of
e
Reign of Terror
in France,
and which they
will have the
honour of offer-
ing under deed of
forfeiture, “By
ORDER (DF THE
Presidented Fºthe
FRENCH REPUB-
Lic.” It so hap-
- pens that there is
no reign of terror just now; nor is there any President of the French
Republic, for the election has not, at the present writing, taken place;
but if it had, we do not see why the President should commission
a party of British Doos to go about England “selling off;” nor do
we know how HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA could be a party to
such a transaction. - - -
These things are not very closely inquired into by a gullible public of
the softer sex, and it is not impossible that the knaves may be reaping
a harvest, which we must prevent them from continuing. -
Their stock consists of everything, from “Enamels of ancient
Limoge,” down to gloves, shoes, and stockings. One of the items
consists of “Priests’ Westments,” to be sold off in consequence of the
French Revolution; though we had not heard that the Church was
reduced to the necessity of parting with its wardrobe, and placing it in
the hands of DIDDLE & Co., to be disposed of “by private treaty.”
To add to our astonishment, we perceive that the Catalogue contains
“700 Chinese Washable Dresses three times the ordinary width.” But
unless there has been a revolution in China, we cannot understand
why the natives should be letting all their washable attire go at an
alarming sacrifice. The Chinese must have been j to greater
lengths than we were aware of; or perhaps, as the dresses are three
times the ordinary, width, the º: of China, have been allowing
themselves extraordinary latitude. Russia, too, has contributed 3500
of her richest Court Dresses to this Sale, if we are to believe the
placard—which we don't—for we have yet to learn that anything has
occurred to break up the Court of St. Petersburgh.
It would seem, also, that the Bushmen of Africa had been involved
in a “Revolution,” a “Reign of Terror,” and an “Alarming Sacrifice,”
for 500 of their hearthrugs—we were not aware that they had hearths,
and a fortiori were we ignorant of their indulgence in rugs—are adver-
tised. The placard containing all these astounding announcements,
repudiates any connection with HoweLL AND JAMEs, EVERINGTON AND
GRAHAM, or other London houses. This is something like a Brumma-
gem BRUMMEL cutting a real GEORGE THE FourTH; or the constant
scayenger, who at Christmas repudiates all connection with everybody
and everything.
ELLIPTICAL ADVERTISEMENT.
THE subjoined advertisement lately tºº. in the Times. We
greatly fear that it has not been answered, for we very much doubt that
it can have been understood:—
EDICAL PARTNERSHIP-Aged Practice. £1100 annually, within
30 miles of London. Equal working share for disposal; applicant fond of field
sports would tell; patients increasing ; hence partner. Price £1000; part credit
if required. Returns last year, £1600. Connexion the cream. £400 guaranteed,
if desired, by the wealthy owner.
To this, Punch, on the part of all whom it may concern, offers the
following reply:-
“Aged Practice”-noidea of what meant. Can't understand what to
take it for, except £1000. “Applicant fond of field sports would tell.”
-Query, on partridges or patients, or both alike P. Suspect that all last
year's returns were smoked. More credit offered than is likely to be
got. “Connexion the cream”—vulgar expression. Should not think
Society was “the cheese.” Deficiency in articles, conjunctions, prepo-
sitions, and verbs, necessary to make sense of sentences, bespeaks
illiterate person. Terms highly objectionable in point of grammar.
Style evidently that of snob; advertiser probably shocking “do.”
WEST RIDING SQUIBS.
Two BARGAINs; ONE BAD, THE OTHER BITTER BAD.
THERE was a young man of the West Riding;
So, when a new candidate was to be found,
The FITzwill IAMs thought it a natural thing
That this young man should walk over the ground-
With a too-ral, oo-ral, oo-ral, oo,
Ri too-ral oo-ral-a!
Now this young man had no principles got-
As how should he have at twenty-three?
So he wrote an Address, which showed he had not
A will of his own in the least degree.
With a too-ral, oo-ral, &c.
Then the Yorkshire yeomen, so long i'the head,
And the Yorkshire spinners, so cute and keen,
They thought to themselves, as the letter they read,
“His colours be blue, but his sen' he be green.”
With his too-ral, oo-ral, &c.
$o then the youngman a canvassing went,
Andwhen his credentials folks asked to see,
He showed them his name, and the roll of the rent
Of the great FITzwillIAM propertie.
With his too-ral, oo-ral, &c,
On the Suffrage, Economy, Church, Free-Trade,"
They begged he’d a bit of his mind let fall;
But he couldn't give 'em a bit, he said,
Of his mind, 'cause he hadn't got any at all.
With his too-ral oo-ral, &c.
If the Whigs had a motion, why, his was the same;
If the Whigs had none, why, no more had he ;
So they snuffed him out, and so settled the game
Of this would-be Member of twenty-three.
With his too-ral oo-ral, &c.
Who once was Tory, then turned Whig,
Who is half †. half grig,
Sour face and sanctified, like STIG-
GINs always pulling f
Who only from the truth ne'er stray'th,
Infallible to judge each faith
Save that wherein himself he pray'th?
SIR EARDLEY CULLING.
Who, when poor Ireland's wounds we search,
Would leave ten Irelands in the lurch,
Rather than take from Ireland's Church
(So called absurdly)
Wealth, which, if truth the text inspire
About the labourer and his hire,
Priests, and not parsons, should require?-
SIRCULLING EARDLEY.
What thins our schoolrooms of the young P
What whets to wrath our old men's tongue?
What down on England's board hath flung
Discord's own apple P
What, preaching peace, still breedeth jarf
What Charity’s fair work doth mar?
What is it but that fatal war—
Church versus Chapel?
If Lib'ralism be worth a fig -
(For which you Yorkshiremen talk big),
Nor gets on, like an Irish pig.
By backward pilin 2
You will not give the cause to shame,
Nor back the bigot's bitter game,
Trusting your high trust to this same

In order to play it, you must first catch your
candidate—if you can get two at once it is still
better—and shut him up in a hustings, openin
front, or in a large room with a balcony, or you
may let him run loose on a platform. Yout
send in the baiters upon him—one at a time, if
you wish to give him fair play, though, we regret
to say, several are often turned in on him at
once. The baiters are then allowed to throw all
sorts of questions at him, and to poke him up
with interrogatories, while he wards them off as
well as he can, or dodges them. He is not
allowed any books of reference, and must en-
counter the baiters without any defensive armour
of facts and figures. All questions are fair, and
the more they defy a short answer the better.
The candidate is not prevented from parrying
with nonsense or humbug, and is expected to
keep his temper. He may be baited as long
as the electors like, or until his wind is com-
pletely gone. When two are, baited at once,

“Accident to the Duke of Richmond.”
Is this manner the pennyº-liners head the account of “a serious
accident” happening to His Grace on his way to the Aberdeen Station.
His horses fall, and the leading postboy “is not only stunned by the
fall, but is very much bruised, and has his shoulder dislocated and some
of his ribs brºken by the heavy coach being dragged over him.” In
truth, a sad accident this to the Duke of Richmond. However, upon
inquiry at the last moment before going to press, we are happy to
inform the world that the Duke of Richmºnd shºws no bruise what:
ever; that his shoulder is strong enough to bear all the honours of the
peerage; and that his ribs are as whole as ADAM's when ADAM was a
bachelor. It is delightful to think that this “accident to the Duke of
RICHMOND” has been of such very brief calamity.
By-the-way, we know not whether it is worth while to observe that
the postboy-spºken of somewhere above—still lies at “the Montrose
Infirmary.” º

THE TURE IN IRELAND.
Not many have had the luck to see Donnybrook Fair; and still fewer
the good fortune to witness Irish Races. This peculiar description of
sport has been lately introduced, very much to his credit, by LoRD
GEORGE HIII, on his property at Gweedore, county Donegal, a place
which, thanks to his Lordship's spirited exertions, is quite a little
garden in the howling waste of Ireland. The following are the particu-
lars of the last meeting, . We must H. that, as the race was an
Irish one, nobody be astonished at discovering that the runners
were not horses:-
BUTTER-Cup Sweepstakes of 20 sovs. each, given by Load SHAMRocz, churned
for by from eighteen to seventy year-old Shelahs, one year heats, the winner to
be the producer of the greatest weight:—
MIKE WALsm's . . - - - Biddy 20 yrs., churned 1500 lbs.
PAT. Hogan's - - - - - Norah - 34 yrs., churned 1200 lbs.
TEAExck O'SHAughnessy's Sweet Heart, Molly Malone, 24yrs., churned 900 lbs.
Betting 7 to 4 agst. Biddy, and 5 to 2 agst. Norah.
Molly took the lead at starting; but for want of spurring on was dis-
tanced by Norah and Biddy. Norah ran a-head for ten months, and then
gave in, and Biddy churned away, a clever winner by 300 lbs.
StockING STAKEs of 24 sovs. each, the gift of the EARL or SKIBBEREEN, to be knit
for by spinsters under 30 yrs. old.
DARRY KELLY's - Honey - 19 yrs. knit 100 pairs.
TIM. SULLIvan's . Darlint . 21 yrs. knit 98 pairs.
Dan. SinerMI’s - Jewel - 25 yrs. knit 84 pairs.
Betting 10 to 1 on Honey.
i. Won easily by Honey by a length of 2 pairs.
Subscription Plough STAREs of 50 sovs. each, to be ploughed for by labourers of
21 yrs. and upwards.
THE MAnquis of ConnemARA's Phil. Murphy .. 23 yrs., 10 st. 1 lb. ploughman A1
Load BANTRY’s . - - Dennis Macarthy 33 yrs., 10 st. 41bs. ploughman 2
SIR. Lucius O'Rourke's - Corny Callaghan 40 yrs., 12 st. ploughman 3
CAPTAIN BANAGHER's Phelim O'Grady 45 yrs., 13 st.5lbs. ploughman 4
Betting 6 to 1 agst. Murphy.
The competitors vied with one another in good earnest, in acting on
the approved maxim of “Speed the Plough.” At starting, O'Grady
was foremost, and got over his ground in good style; but Macarthy
went ahead of him, and in his turn had the go-by from Čorny Callaghan,
over whom, however, Phil. Murphy ultimately triumphed, the umpires
awarding to him the palm of superiority for neatness and expedition in
turning up the roots of the daisies. The work was up hill; but it was
done very cleverly.
The candidates were all in prime condition, and when the sport was
over, were provided with a good substantial feed, including plenty of
corn (which answers much better than potatoes), whereat, in sporting
parlance, they all pegged away like four-year-olds. Some of the nobs,
we understand, netted a good round sum by betting on their respective
favourites; but all of them are certain to reap a large profit from the
impetus which the introduction of these sports will give to the cultiva.
tion of property in Ireland; and they will also assuredly benefit by the
good feeling and understanding which this noble pastime is j
to engender between the landlord and the labourer.
A Truly German Name.
THE President of that turbulent body of legislators, the Prussian
Chamber—himself the professor of very extreme opinions—is named,
by the Journals, M. UNRUH. There must be some mistake here. Wé
believe that the proper name of this gentleman is UNRULY.

for when last seen, he appeared to be almost at his last extremities. He need not
beafraid to make his appearance again, and unfold himself without scruple; but he
must embrace the present opportunity, or he is for ever lost.

Its creases smoothed away;

Our husbands they may scold or snore,
Or bake, or fry, or stew;
While we this man-spoiled world restore,
And make it good as new.
Lords of creation—vice men, §
At last we have our way;
Uprouse ye then, my merry women,
t is our mangling day.
No husband's mission own we now,
To bully or to bore; .
“Obedience” of the marriage vow
Shall form a part no more.
Till now we’ve ruled by stratagem,
Henceforth we’ll rule by sway;
Uprouseye them, my merry women,
or this is Lady-day.
The Right of Labour we’ll proclaim
In favourof the male;
Our new couleur de rose shall flame
The Red Republic pale.
Latch-keys or Clubs, who dares to name,
With life shall forfeit pay;
U. ye then, my merry women,
or this is Lady-day!
KITCHEN STUFF.
AN advertisement in the Globe a few days ago informed us of the
establishment, at Bristol, of a School for Domestic Servants, and the
iano was mentioned as being taught at this novel establishment. We
É. no objection to a School for Servants—a class requiring to be
schooled rather severely sometimes—but what they want with the piano
somewhat puzzles us. Perhaps it may be useful to them to know how
to play ºff: when, the family being out, there is a réunion of the
policeman, the lamplighter, the greengrocer, and other friends of the
culinary department; but for ordinary use, a knowledge of music seems
to be somewhat de trop in an education intended to fit the pupil for a
career of domestic service. Cooks, housemaids, and nurses are crotchetty
enough already, without putting musical, as well as other crotchets
into their heads; and unless the pianos used for teaching are semi-
grands and semi-dressers-forming a sort of half and half between har.
mony on the one hand and household duty on the other-wºdo not see
how the new scheme of education can be at all º: We presume
the instruments will be supplied with metallic plates; but if our plan is
carried out, earthenware plates may be added. There is perhaps after
all some affinity between music and pots and pans, for the comparison
of a piano to an old tin kettle is by no means unusual.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAR TO THE (PAPER) KNIFE.
THE contest now going on in France
for the Presidentship of the Republic
is being carried on by caricatures and
squibs, which are certainly very prefer-
able to the mode of hostility which
has lately been popular in Paris. We
should be very glad to see all war
superseded by paper war; and our
Army Estimates would certainly be
very much reduced, if literary an
artistical powder and shot were sub-
stituted for the ammunition of a more
costly as well as more deadly character.
One of our modern advertising carts,
loaded with caricatures, would form a
van-guard of the most effective kind,
and we should be delighted to see the artist instead of the soldier follow-
ing the word of command to draw, and dealing out cuts of a humorous
rather than of an inhuman
nature.
We can fancy the advance
of a regiment of light satirists
producing an effect more per-
manently triumphant than the
onslaught of a troop of heavy
cavalry; and even in a naval
action we think the broadsides
of the printing press would be
more damaging than the broad-
sides now used for hostile pur-
poses. The lead of the artist's
pencil leaves, at all events, a
more lastin ". than the lead of the warlike missiles hitherto
in use; and, in boarding the ship of a foe, a party of literary board-
men, inclosed in their customary armour of posting-bills, would be
quite irresistible.

THE SPELL-BOUND ENTHUSIASTS.
MADNEss has adopted a variety of methods, and run the round of
almost every absurdity; but decidedly the most insane thing out of
Bedlam in the present day, is a scheme for the annihilation of MAvon,
the demolition of Dilworth, and the utter or unutterable confusion of
all orthography.
A Society has started for the purpose of promoting, bad spelling and
wrong writing; for knocking out half the public Is, depriving us of a
great portion of our Ees; multiplying our mutes, without hearing a
word in their favour; absorbing some of our liquids; depriving us of
our Vs without a Y or a wherefore; and vowing vengeance on our
vowels. It seems we are to read and interpret everything in future
according to its sound; but we are not told what we are to gather from
that “sound and fury” proverbially “signifying nothing.”
... A newspaper has been already advertised under the hieroglyphical
title of the “FONETIC NUZ;” which is to contain twelve pages
“desiz.oy dozin de Mºzaminer.”. We presume that this mystic print
will be intended chiefly for circulation among old clothesmen and Jew
orange-boys, with whose peculiar dialectit seems to chime in very har-
moniously. The prospectus of this affair calculates upon “mor dan
wun undreed an fiftitousend supporterz,” which is as near as possible
the amount of the orange an pencil population of the Empire,
including the denizens of the large-bladed penknife districts, and the
sons of the clothes-bags of Israel.
The objects of the paper are said to be “educashun,” not only moral
and intellectual, but “fizical;” and “fizical” it would indeed become
under the new system, by keeping the mind ever on the fiz, or in a
state of effervescence, to comprehend the meaning of the mis-spelt
lessons placed under the bewildered eyes of the pupil. Who would
think that people were mad enough to expect to facilitate the art of
learning to read by such sentences—or rather, by such mysterious
orthography—as the following, which we print, as well as our civ
d|#ypes will allow, from the prospectus of the Fonetic Nuz-paper:-
erming tue red iz, at depresnt da, so dificult and lengtiatasc, data
molejov redin and ritin haz bin rech'd de gol,ov a puur munz educa-
shun.” After an octavo page of this truly speluncular spelling—for it
hurries us into the Cave of Despair when we try to make it out—the
prospectus goes on to say:-"dis iz de grat, de nobºl, de holi.cozin
hwich wear engajd;” and the projectors add, that of this “holi coz”
they are resolved to record the “triumfs in de columnzov de Fonetic

FINE ARTS.
THE Morning Post has a very noble notice of the Portrait of George
Hudson, Esq.; noble and slightly pathetic. The picture was painted
by F. GRANT; engraved by George RAPHAEL WARD; published by
P. and D. Colnagh I; and to be purchased by every true-born Briton
who would wish to lay his hand upon his heart, and feel his bank book
there (with a good balance) in his breast-pocket. Englishmen are
frequently told (especially at elections) that any of them may, if they
will, be a Commander-in-Chief, a Lord High Admiral, a Prime Minister,
or a Lord Chancellor. This is all very well. But we would have a
copy of the Portrait ºf George Hudson, Esq., in the house of every
humble Englishman, as an incentive to a yet higher sition in social
; e would have it preached to every hedger, ditcher, and
stone-breaker, “You may be a HUDson.” And to this end, we
would multiply the copies of the portrait, till Hupsons were plentiful
as sprats, with the like suggestiveness of gold at the gills, and silver all
over. We do not see why good stout copies of the portrait (on brown
paper), should not adorn, every cottage, and every Union. How
admirably has the critic burnt his incense (we may say in his sim-
plicity, his frankincense) to the gilt original!—
“The naturally strong mind and marked individuality which have made the
name of Hudson honourably known among a people who are slow in their recog-
nitions, and tardy in their acknowledgments, are not denoted by the placid but
somewhat vacant look of the image which is now before us.”
This is so true; at least the early part of it. For it is happily well
understood, at least by the select, that MR. Hudson is not known and
honoured by a people “slow to recognise” the power of money—(there
was no subscription, none, to gild the ears of MIDAs)—for his wealth;
but for his studies in abstract science; for his continual self-devotion
to anything but himself.
HUDson “well-fed and contented.” A pictorial libel. Like all the
ascetic philosophers, it is known that Hudson lives º pulse and
dates; and—ere he addresses Parliament-drinks nought save waters
from the well of Truth. The artist should have painted the face of
Hudson, that it might have appeared—
“The combination of courage, prudence, foresight, and determination which
seized fortune where too many embraced despair, we in vain strive to discover in
the well-fed and contented gentleman, who looks as if he had nothing in this world
to think about, and even less to do.”
“Before the Times' effacing fingers
Have swept the lines where beauty lingers.”
the lines are gone; and all that remains—according to
Whereas half

finely says:-
“The mere obtrusion of skin and bone is therefore no evidence of intellect; nor
is the factofthehuman skeleton being somewhat softly clothed, proof that the brain
has lost its firmness; and those who are offering premiums for the encouragement
of art would do well to reward the first living painter who can execute the portrait
of a corpulent person, and make him appearan object deserving of respect.”
. A fine motion. We should like to see the portrait of a four-pound
dip. One of the greatest lights of the world, “deserving of respect!”

And took the oss from TATTERSALL’s :
Wasn that a artful dodge?
One day this gentleman's groom
This willain did spy out,
A mounted on this oss
A ridin him about:
“Get out of that there Oss, you rogue,”
Speaks up the groom so stout.
The thief was cruel whex'd
To find hisself so pinn'd;

T. PAUL'S AND WESTMINSTER
ABBEY.
NotwitHSTANDING our continued notices of the Exhibition at St.
Paul's, the twopences, we understand, come in but slowly, and the
Dean and Chapter murmur horribly at the tightness of the times, the
pecuniary pressure, and other causes which mulct them of those coppers
that used to pour in upon them most abundantly. The door-keeper
complains of its being the worst season he ever knew, and the great
whispering professor, who wheezes out the measurement of the nave,
and other interesting º grumbles grievously over a dreary
succession of empty galleries.
Instead of the “continued overflows” anticipated from a “reduction
of prices,” which had induced the authorities to think of letting out
the cathedral stalls for the season, to insure seats for those requiring
them, the attendance has been growing gradually less, until the vergers,
verging on despair, have arrived almost at their wits' end—no great
length after all-in a search for novelty. One of the most ingenious
of the Cathedral functionaries has, we understand, proposed a scheme
to the Dean, and Chapter for adding to the interest of the present
exhibition. The project recommended is to combine the great features
of MADAME Tussaud's collection with the existing attractions at St.
MoRE Novelty Ats
Paul's, and thus achieve that most, desirable triumph familiarly known
as "two exhibitions in one,” which we sometimes see placarded on the
walls of the metropolis.
| The object will be to dress the various statues in “costumes of the
| most costly character,” so as to compete with the “magnificent addi.
tions” continually advertised by MADAME Tussaud, when she brings
out a new lad of wax, and lays in a new piece of silk, satin, sarsmet, or
yelvet, to render him preseniable. We have heard that a negotiation
is already pending with a celebrated costumier, who is remarkable for
the great value of his dresses, which are usually so costly that a tunic
and trunks originally purchaseable “out and out” for three pounds, will
rise in value at the rate of a guinea a day, if the hirer neglects to return
the articles, or the lender omits to send for them. This great dresser
and redresser of the age will be happy to place the whole of his superb
stock of cocked hats, admirals' coats, general officers' uniforms, with at
|least 5000 entire suits of fleshings for the undraped sculpture, at the
service ºf the Dean and Chapter of either St. Paul's or Westminster
| Abbey, by the day, week, month, or year, at a price extremely moderate.
Pants? Why You, You Bage creechua"; and well may you go and
Exhibition, and , all the field-marshals, admirals, poets, and other
celebrities will be suited to a hair with scalps, scull-caps, fronts,
crops, or ringlets, as the case may be, of the most soft and silky
texture.
We shall watch with intense interest the progress of this great plan
for getting up the grand spectacles of St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey with those dresses and decorations which have been brought to
such perfection by MADAME Tussaup, who can scarcely object to the
competition, for the two great ecclesiastical shows will hardly hurt her
|by the rivalry, at so great a distance from her old established concern
in Baker Street.
HERALDRY FOR THE BILLION.
WE wonder King-at-Arms does not, like unfortunate Miss BAILEy,
hang himself in his own garters; for the trade of Heraldry must be in
a state of sad depression, when we find crests engraved, “and found”
into the bargain, for 10s. 6d-a fact we learn from numerous adver-
tisements. The Heralds' College enjoys the monopoly of finding the
public in coats-of-arms; but England must be crest-fallen indeed,
when half-a-guinea will make any one a legitimate gentleman.
We presume the pressure of the times will be pleaded for this fearful
reduction in the price of heraldic bearings, and the determination of
Garter to place an Esquireship within the reach of the humblest—or,
at all events, the poorest—individual.
Sadler's Wells Theatre has lately been performing, in its usual style
of excellence, a piece called A Blot on the Scutcheon. But the British
|Scutcheons seem likely to be covered with blots, or converted, in fact,
into mere dabs of ink, by the lowering of price, to a degree so base,
that we fear it will be utterly impºssible to “keep the thing respect-
---

THE GREAT SQUATTLEBOROUGH SOIREE.
OOD MR. PUNCH,
“I AM an author
by trade, and in confi-
dence send you my card,
which will satisfy you of
my name and my place
of business. If the de-
signer of the series of
cuts called ‘Authors’
Miseries’ will take my
case in hand, I will not
ask to plead it, myself;
otherwise, as it is one
which concerns most li-
terary persons, and as
the annoyance of which
I complain may be a
source of serious loss
and evil to them, I take
leave to cry out on behalf
of our craft.
“The system of op-
pression against which I
/ desire to protest, is one
which has of late been
exercised by various
bodies, in various parts
of the kingdom—by the
- harmless, may, most
Societies there established. These, under the name
stitutes, Parthenons, and what not, meet together
laudable Lite
of Athenaeums, -
for the purposes of literary exercitation; have reading-rooms, supplied
with magazines, books, newspapers, and your own invaluable mis-
cellany; and lecture-rooms, where orators, and philosophers, and men
of science *}. to instruct or to amuse. The Sea Serpent, the
character of Hamlet, the royal orrery, and dissolving views, the female
characters in MRs. Jones's novels, &c.—whatever may be the subject
of the lecturer. I am sure no friend to his kind would wish either to
revent that honest man from getting his bread, or his audience from
istening to his harangues. Lecturers are not always consummately wise,
but that is no reason why audiences should not listen to them. yself,
Sir, as I walked down Holborn the other day, I saw placarded (amongst
other names far more illustrious) my own name, in pretty much the
following terms:- .
* L. A. HUGGLESTONE.
"ARE THE WRITINGs of HUGGLESTONE MORAL OR IMMORALP’
“PRofesson GRouTAGE will deliver an Essay on this subject, on the 25th Instant,
at the Philosophical Arena and Psychogymnasium, Cow Lane, Smithfield. After
the Lecture, the Arena will be opened for free discussion. Admission 2d.,
Children ld.”
“I, of course, did not attend, but female curiosity induced MRs.
HUGGLESTONE to pay her money. She returned home, Sir, dissatisfied.
I am informed the Professor did not do me justice. My writings are
not appreciated by MR. GROUTAGE (nor indeed by many other critics),
and my poor Louisa, who had taken our little JAMEs, who is at home
for the Christmas Holidays, by way of treat, came home with mortifica-
tion in her heart, that our JEMMY should have heard his father so
slightingly spoken of by GROUTAGE, and said, with tears in her own
eyes, that she should like to scratch out those of the philosopher in
question.
“Because the Professor has but a mean opinion of me, is that any
reason why free discussion should not be permitted? Far otherwise.
As Indians make fire with bits of wood, blockheads may strike out sparks
of truth in the trituration of debate, and I have little doubt that had my
poor dear girl but waited for the discussion in the arena, my works
would have had their due, and GROUTAGE got his answer...The people
may be lectured to by very stupid quacks (perhaps, Sir, it may have
been your fortune to have heard one or two of them); but, as sure as
they are quacks, so sure they will be discovered one day or other, and
I, for my part, do not care a fig for the opinion of the Professor of Cow
Jane. I am putting merely my own case in illustration of the propo-
sition, which is, that public debates and fair play of thought among men
are good, and to be encouraged. Those who like to read better out of
a book, than to listen to a long-haired lecturer, with his collars turned
down (so that his jaws may wag more freely), those who prefer a pipe
at the neighbouring tavern to a debate, however stirring, at the Cow
ane Gymnasium, are welcome and right, but so are the others on the
other side.
“I will mention a case which seems to me in point. In my early days,
my friend HUFFY, the dentist, with myself and several others, belonged
to the Plato Club, meeting of Saturday nights in Covent Garden, to
discuss the writings of that philosopher, and to have a plain supper
and a smoke. I and some others used to attend pretty regularly, but
only at the smoking and supping part, which caused HUFFY to say, with
a look of considerable scorn, "that there were some minds, not capable
of sustaining or relishing a philosophical investigation.” The fact was,
we were not anxious to hear HUFFY's opinions about PLATO at all;
and preferred scolloped oysters to that controversy.
“I submit that, in this case, both parties were right, HUFFY in
indulging himself in Platonic theories, and we for refraining from them.
We doubted our lecturer–of our scolloped oysters we were sure. We
were only sceptics in this instance, not in all; and so in the multifarious
Institutes throughout the country, where speechifying is performed, I
own I sometimes have doubts as to the wholesomeness of the practice.
But it is certain, that if there may be stupid lectures, there may be clever
lectures; there may be quacks or men of genius; there may be know-
ledge good and sound acquired; there may be but a superficial smattering
ºf parrot-like imitation of a teacher who himself is but a pretender;
and also it is clear that people should talk, should think, should read,
should have tea in a social manner, and, calling the fiddlers and their
wives and daughters, have a dance together at the Parthenon, Athenæum
or Institute, until they are tired, and go home happy. And if in a
manufacturing town, of course it is good that the master of the mill
should join in the sport in which his hands are engaged; or in the
country districts, that the great man or Squire should aid. For example,
I read last year in the Squattleborough Sentinel, how the heir of the
noble house of YAwNY, the Honourable MR. DRAWLEIGH, came over
ten miles, to Squattleborough in the most slushy weather, , and
delivered four lectures there on his travels in Nineveh, and his
measurements of the tombs of Baalbec. Some people fell asleep at these
lectures, no doubt, but many liked them, and MR. DRAWLEIGH was
right to give them.
“He represents the borough. His family are time out of mind lords
of the neighbourhood. Nothing is more certain than that the heir of
Dozeley Castle should do his utmost to give pleasure to his faithful
constituents and the children of the quondam retainers of his race. It
was he who set up the Squattleborough Parthenon, his father, LoRD
YAwNY, laying the first brick, of the edifice; the neighbouring clergy
and gentry attending and delivering appropriate, orations, and the
library beginning with two copies of DRAwleIGH’s own Travels, in
morocco gilt. This is all right. But the Squattleborough. Parthenon
is not, for this, “the Beacon of Truth, the Centre of Civilisation, the
Pharos in the storm, which the troubled voyager sees from the dark
waters,. radiating serenely with the Truthful and, the Beautiful,” as
PROFEssoR Jowls said at the Inauguration Meeting, the Squattle-
borough Institution, I say, is not in the least like this, but an excel-
lent good place enough, º: every man can read the paper if it is not in
hand; or get a book from the library, if nobody else has engaged it.
Let things be called by their names, Mr. Punch; this place at Squattle-
borough is a good literary club, and that, is a good thing, and it pro-
motes the good fellowship, and aids the reading and education of
ºrs of people there; and, Heaven send every such scheme pros-
perity
“But now the Squattleborough folks are bent on following the
fashion, and having a grand tea-party at their Institute. Amongst
others, I have been favoured with a card to this party. The secretary
writes in the kindest manner; he says the directors of the Institute
are going to give a grand soirée, which many noblemen and gentlemen
of the neighbourhood have promised to attend, and where they are
most anxious ‘to secure the leading ". talent.’
“Noblemen and Gentlemen of the neighbourhood, a la bonne heure-
and it is very complimentary, doubtless, to be mentioned amongst the
leading literary talent; a noble Lord, a couple of most reverend
prelates, a great poet, and so forth, we are informed, are asked. But
why the deuce does Squattleborough want ‘to secure literary talent?"
Gentlemen, do you think men of letters have nothing to do? Do you
go three hundred miles to a tea-party, spend five or six pounds on
railroads and inns, give up two days' work and a night's sleep at the
request of peo le hundreds of miles away, of whom you have no earthly
knowledge? #. are one or two men of letters, who, upon a great
occasion, and by a great city, are rightly called to help and to speak;
these men are great orators—whom it is a privilege for any community
to hear—but for those whose gift does not lie that way, why drag them
out from their homes, or their own friends, or their desks, where their
right places are P - - - - - --- -
“I, for instance, who write this, have had a dozen invitations within
the last few months. I should have had to travel many thousands of
miles—to spend ever so many scores of pounds—to lose weeks upon
weeks of time—and for what? In order to stand on a platform, at this
town or that, to be pointed out as the author of so and so, and to hear
Lord This or the Archbishop of That, say that Knowledge was Power,
that Education was a benefit, that the free and enlightened, people of
What-d'ye-call-'em were daily advancing in Civilisation, and that the
learning of the ingenious arts, as the Latin bard had observed, refined
our manners, and mitigated their ferocity. -

happy, ye men of Squattleborough, and other places. I say amen to
all § ; but if you can read for yourselves it is the best. If you can be
wise without bragging and talking so much about it, you will lose none
of your wisdom; and as you and your wives and daughters will do the

your native lions to roar?

“LEONTIUS ANDROCLES HUGGLESTONE”
MEDICAL JOURNEY-WORK AND WAGES.
It is to be hoped that few professors of physic will adopt the doctrines
of Fº force; but there is great fear that many young medical men
will turn Chartists. The main object of Chartism, after all, is to obtain
a good day's : for a good day's work; and the existing relation
between medical labour and wages may be too correctly estimated from
the subjoined advertisement in the Lancet :-
MEDICAL ASSISTANTS.—WANTED, by a General Practitioner in
the County of Hants, an assistant who has been accustomed to visit, dispense,
keep the books, and take charge of Union patients. He must either be a Licentiate
of the Hall, or Member of some College. As the situation is one in which he will be
treated as a gentleman, it is quite indispensable that his character will bear strict
investigation. To save trouble, replies will only be sent to those applications which
appear likely to suit. Salary, 1630 per annum.
Punch suspends his cudgelover the head of the “General Practitioner
in the County of Hants.” . If it is a part of that individual's general
ractice to give his assistants £30 a year for visiting, dispensing,
eeping books, and attending Union patients, Mr. Punch will not at once
beg leave to tell him that he is a shabby fellow. He may be, and most
likely is, not an active but a passive screw, merely transmitting the
pressure which is applied to him by the public and the Poor Law. But
this does not mollify the case of his unfortunate drudge. Why, the
doctor's journeyman earns absolutely less than the bricklayer’s The
helper at any decent livery-stable makes more than the assistant of the
medical man. The aggregate “tips” of an ordinary Boots exceed £30
per annum. Nothing but high moral feeling can be depended upon to
hinder so ill-paid a workman from converting his pestle and mortar into

CATECHISMS FOR THE HUSTINGS.
We have serious thoughts of publishing a series of little manuals,
under the above title, that should contain a summary of questions likely
and unlikely to be asked of Candidates, with answers calculated not to
satisfy the minds, but to stop the mouths of the querists, the latter
being the great object in such cases. Of course, there should be sepa-
rate, manuals for different parties. The following may serve as a
Specimen:-
TORY MANUAL.
s% How do you define our glorious Constitution in Church and
ale
4. That state of things dictated by the wisdom of our ancestors, for
the advantage of ourselves and the amaz ment of posterity.
Q: Are you prepared to stand upon the old paths?
A. I am; and to keep off all trespassers.
Q: What are the old paths?
A. Those which begin, like charity, at home, and lead, like officers of
the army, to glory. The Nobility, Gentry, and Dignified Clergy are
their trustees; they are paved with good intentions; their “pikes.”
must be paid, and therefore none but those with a money qualification
can travel along them.
Q: Who pays for keeping up those paths?
A. The Public.
Q: Who has the administration of the road fund?
A. The Aristocracy.
Q. Will you maintain the Church?
A. I will-comfortably.
Q. Will you keep up the Exclusion of the Dissenters from the
Universities?
A.. I will. Churchmen don't ask for admission to Coward College,
or Highbury—Why should Dissenters to Oxford or Cambridge?
Q: What do you understand by meum and tuum ?
A. Meum, is all I can get. Tuum, is all others can prevent me from
getting.
Q. What would you teach the poor?
A. Their duties.
Q. What would you teach the rich f
A. Their rights.
Q. What is your object in seeking for a seat in the House of
Commons?
A. To advocate your interests and push my own.
Q: What is your opinion of the Ballot? .
A. That it is un-English, as tending to withdraw the voter from the
influence of his : superiors?
Q. Will you oppose any Extension of the Suffrage?
A. I will. If votes were given to all, they would cease to command
any price in the market.
It will be obvious how this idea may be applied to other schools of
politics. If carried out, it º: save young gentlemen from that sort
of painful exposure to, which the Hon. CHARLEs FITzwilliam was
lately so cruelly exposed in the West Riding.
DESIGN FOR A BANNER Fort M.R. Denison.
PLEDGES FOR SALE.
Louis NAPOLEoN has been severely taunted because he has given no
pledges, whereas the pledges he has drawn from his Uncle must be
obvious to everybody. For fear they should not be generally known, we
subjoin a short list of them:—
THE THREE-Consen Ed Hat.—Formerly there was a great deal in this little hat,
but it is greatly to be questioned if the inside is worth anything now, more especially
when Louis Napoleon has it on his head.
2. LA RED1Ngorz Grise.—This has been so sciled, so pulled about, and dragged
in . mud, that it is scarcely recognisable, from the numerous stains that are
upon it.
3. The OLD Boots.-Very much trodden under foot, and trampled out of all
shape, from having been worn by a person whom they evidently have not fitted.
4. The IMPERIAL Snuff-box.-Quite dry—not a pinch left in it, to throw into
the eyes of a single person.
5. Several proclamations, a telescope, a fur coat worn at Moscow, a sword used
at the bridge of Lodi, a tin model of the iron crown of Lombardy, the imperial
sceptre flourished at the coronation at Notre Dame, two or three of the crosses
displayed to “les braves” on the memorable return from Elba, one of the flags
embraced at Fontainebleau, and other articles, far too numeroustomention.
The only question is, whether France is likely to be redeemed by
pledges of the above second-hand nature.
“What's IN A NAME?”—All that Louis NAPOLEoN possesses.

THE RAILWAY LADY-KILLERS.
DID you ever? No you never did, I’m sure, young ladies, hear,
Such a tale as one I'll tell you from the Liverpool Courier;
'Tis about affections trifled with, confiding girls betray’d,
And heartless hoaxes, ruthlessly on tender bosoms play’d.
There are some gents in Manchester, whose avocations will -
Send them sometimes on the railway, from the counter and the till;
Each sports his large Mosaic rings, his breast-pin, and his chain,
And, in the stead of shop-yard, bears a natty little cane.
The object of each fellow—for we will not call him man—
Is but to captivate as many victims as he can,
As many head—or heart—of game as possible to bag,
And of his booty afterwards to go away and brag.
His carriage in the railway train should some fair maiden share,
He eyes her sentimentally, but with respectful air;
From time to time he heaves a mild and melancholy sigh—
Ob, dear, how very easy'tis without a word to lie
At length the object of his wiles he ventures to accost,
Says that the day is wet or fine, or there will be a frost,
And then too many answer him—the base, perfidious one—
Engage in conversation, and are, consequently, done.
For remarks, when once they're answer'd, though the merestnothings, oft
Lead to the further interchange of nothings sweet and soft;
She who assents, at starting, to a speech about the day,
May end the parley with the word which gives her heart away.
And thus it fared with one who was of Liverpool the belle,
Her name—but that let asterisks alone to Scandal tell—
Thus hoaxed was she by one of those young Snobs of whom I spoke;
And now the puppy shows about her letters, as a joke.
There is a scamp among them who eleven dupes can count;
The victims of another unto twenty-three amount;
And these two varlets chuckle, with their ribald gibes and jests,
O'er the fond effusions of no less than four-and-thirty breasts.
Then, all fair railway passengers, a timely warning take,
Cut short all smirking, simpering gents, advances who may make;
Be deaf to the soft speeches, blind to all the killing looks
Of BROWN and Jones and RoBINson, of SIMPKINs, SMITH and SNooks.
JENKINS AT THE CATTLE-SHOW.
CHILD’S-PLAY.
THE latest novelty introduced into the game of Revolution “over the
water,” has been an Infant Phenomenon. She talks like a woman, that
is to say, as long as they will let her, and * } to demand the equa:
lisation of sucre-d'orges, and the division of galette shops into equal
electoral districts. She made her début a short time ago at one of the
barrières, and drew down the applause of a crowded, but not very respect-
able dinner, at 8 sous a head, children at half price,—which must have
been a “consommation” not altogether to be most devoutly wished by the
restaurateur, considering the little profit he could have got out, of it, if
these specimens of La Jeune France only ate and drank in the same
destructive manner that, they talked. Really La Jeune France should
be ashamed of itself, and deserves being whipped and put to bed. The
poor little thing should be at school or with its nurse, making little paper
soldiers or cocks and hens, instead of rearing social fabrics, or lisping
constitutions, whilst its own is not yet developed. However, it is very
strange that Frenchmen, who are always putting themselves forward as
“le peuple le plus spirituel” in the world, should not see the absurdity
of these juvenile exhibitions, and when a baby Genius begins prattling
they do not stop its little mouth with confitures, or drown its squeak
amidst loud cries of “Au lit! Au lit!” Every great cause has its hero;
but what are we to say of the Republic when its advocates are little
boys and girls?. It is true that their national songs call upon all enſans
de la patrie to defend it; but really some limit should be º to the age
of these blessed"enfans,” and none under twelve should be allowed to
deliberate in any public assembly, or children-at-arms permitted to have
a voice in the nation elsewhere than at home in their nurseries.

were not complimentary to the pride in which the show originated.”
.There is a .."; incoherency in this. The heart of JENKINs is
distressed, subdued by the confidential sheeps' eyes cast upon him;
and his mind wanders in a maze of words.
But, we can respect, the compassion—albeit a little maudlin—of

of the step on which, he has resolved. He abdicates in favour of his

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, -
“As you are such a friend to us, of the Rising Generation, and
always stand up for our rights against them that I won't say anything
more about, I hope you will put this letter in your paper, that it may
meet the eyes of our parents, who we know regularly take you in.
“I write for the whole school—there's 79 of us—and we always
have three Punches a-week; so it may be worth your while not to for-
get to print this letter.
“Yesterday, we wrote home to all our “Honoured Parents,” telling
'em that the Christmas Holidays began on Wednesday, and ended on
the 30th of January (a precious sight too soon for any chap). But that
letter was set for us by DR. MAvor, of Birchblossom Hall; and if he
should come to your office, I trust to your honour hot to show him
what I’ve wrote to you, as he knows my hand, and wouldn't he-after
holidays—neither?
“There's 79 of us, and I tell you, Mr. Punch, upon my word and
honour, that our. Honoured. Parents’ do not understand how to make
home happy, while we are with 'em in the holidays.
“To begin. Why should our mothers take us shopping with 'em P
Isn't it dreadful to do nothing but sit on a stool, seeing'em roll out all
sorts of gowns, when there’s so many pastrycooks, where we could
wait for 'em a good deal better?
. “Why, too, should we be always taken to St. Paul's Church, spend-
ing money, when there’s Astley's, and WRIGHT, at the Adelphi, that
cost so very little more?
Then, again, there's a lot of money always goes for pulling out
teeth, when we don't see half the Pantomimes, that wouldn't come to
half so much.
“Poets' Corner's slow, and the wax-work at Westminster Abbey—
which costs sixpence—isn't near so nobby as MADAME Tussaud's.
“Do speak up for us young chaps. We arn’t at all treated as we
ought to be in the holidays... I want a cornet-à-piston, and the back-
parlour to practise in; and if the noise is always too much, why, I don't
mind going out to a shooting gailery.
“I remain, Mr. Punch, your Constant Reader,
“BIRCHBLossOM HALL.”
“P.S.. If the governor doesn't do the right thing these holidays, do
let me show him up, there’s a good fellow.”
THE HORSE GUARDS CLOCK.
. papers of Monday contained the following remarkable para-
graph :-
“Connt of QUEEN's Bench.-Upon Lond DENMAN taking his seat on the Bench,
he called attention to the state of the Horse Guards Clock, which he said bad
stood at six for the last fortnight, and he was desirous of bringing it under the
notice of the proper authorities.”
There can be no doubt that Punch is the proper authority which LoRD
DENMAN so gravely alludes to; for, in the celebrated St. Clement's
case--we mean clock-case—our jurisdiction was universally recognised.
We shall be happy to take the matter in hand—hands and all; but we
must in fairness admit that the delinquent shows some sense of its own
position in standing at six, whereas its notorious predecessor stood at
nothing, aye, and stuck at nothing, for a very considerable period
The Horse Guards Clock should, we think, be proceeded against in
a regular way, by motion; and we are sure MR. BRIEFLEss will be
happy to move the Court, calling upon the Clock to show cause why a
summons for farther time should not be immediately served upon it.
We regret that a clock standing so high as that at the Horse Guards,
should have fallen into these irregularities, which have ultimately
brought it to a stand-still.
MR.WULLIAMY, who has undertaken the defence of the Clock, seems
to think that the damp weather, by its vexatious action on the case, has
so injured defendant, that to stay proceedings until its affairs can be
wound up, was its º alternative. We shall certainly instruct
Counsel to move for a rule to compute the time already elapsed, and to
settle the minutes, in conformity with the principle of time being of
the essence of the contract between the Clock and the public.

this undertaking. Ill tidi always travel fast enough without being
expedited by the electric te ph; and no news is good news, or at
least the best, that we are likely to receive from Ireland; therefore,
the more slowly and less frequently we are furnished with, Irish

A TRIFLE FROM BRIGHTON.
I took the trainto Brighton—I walked beside the sea,
And thirty-thousand Londoners were there along with me.
We crowded every lodging, and we lumbered each hotel,
Sniff’d the briny for an appetite, and dined extremely well.
The Cliff it shows like Regent Street come down for the sea-air;
Not in Hyde Park's self do ladies more becomingbonnets wear;
In enchanted “upper circles” one seems to move about,
When the sunshine brings the flies and private equipages out.
To Brighton the Pavilion lends a lath-and-plaster grace—
Fit shrine for fittest God of this pleasant watering place;
And against the show and shallowness, the vanity and glee,
With his hollow, hushless murmur, comes up the solemn Sea.
I sat there in the Bedford, and in the Times Iread -
Of the West Riding Canvass, and a thought came in my head:
How England’s one Great Brighton—we all sorich and gay,
While at our feet and in our face a sea comes up alway.
Qur wealth is vast, our gains grow fast, we are dealers fair and free;
Qurgoods tempt every market, our ships plough every sea;
Qur lords are great, our traders true, our priests good men and grave,
Our women fair, our sailors staunch, our soldiers blunt and brave.
We have a brilliant lot for some, a bustling lot for all;
Qur hold on life seems manful, our fear of evil small;
But underneath this surface, with all its strength and shine,
The hoarse and heaving sea of toil doth chaſe, and moan, and mine.
For I saw how in that Canvass, were it Whig or were it Tory
That talked to the Electors, it was always the same story:
Whate'er the hustings said in praise, or self-congratulation,
Produced a comment from the crowd of aught but approbation.
It was Capital a-preaching, out of plump and prosperous men,
And Labour's hundred hungrythroats refusing their “Amen.”
When Riches mentioned “Industry,” Rags answered with "Despair,”
And Fustian rapp'd a curse out, when Broadcloth talked of prayer.
I dropped the Times to look upon the Cliff with all its life,
And that stern sea, that now 'gan curlits white waves as for strife—
And I felt to seek for appetite from the briny, 'twas in vain,
And so took my place for London by the earliest fast train.

tained their ground stoutly for a few weeks, but the strong arm of the
law has been called into disperse them, and those who refuse to “move
on,” will very quickly be taken up, and bound down not to disturb the
small piece of vegetation in Leicester Square any more. The interior
shows all the signs of a civil war: here a barricade with an overturned
wheelbarrow, there a summer-house turned inside out, and everywhere
there are heaps of stones, remnants of clay pipes, paper caps, and aban-
oned pickaxes; whilst oyster-shells strew the ground inevery direction,

THE LAND FOR THE LASSES.
AN Australian newspaper contains the following, to those whom it
may concern, interesting intelligence:-
“ATTRACTIVE NEws Fog ouh Countrywom EN AT Home.—Out of the female
immigrants who recently arrived at Melbourne by the William Stewart, eight were
married within twenty-four hours after their landing.”
Australia indeed is a land of promise to the Wives and Daughters of
England: to as many of the former as have more of the latter than they
know what to do with; and to as many of the latter as are vainly desi-
rous to be included among the former. We expect that many youn
ladies who have been hitherto singing, There’s no place like Home, will
now change their tune, and sing “There's no place like Australia,” and

that another ditty popular here will be thus slightly varied for adapta-
tion to the climate of the Antipodes:-

Oh, dear, what shall I do
Thousands are coming to mary me,
Thousands are coming to woo.”
If any young woman wishes to know when she will be married, she
may satisfy her curiosity by a very easy process. Let her take her
passage for Australia, calculate the length of the voyage, and add to it
twenty-four hours. Within that time she will be a wife-or a voluntary
spinster.

economy in the public service, would have taken an extra year's salary
for extra zealous discharge of his arduous duties, without managing to
put it delicately back into the public purse, even if he j it at
phib-ious. We must entreat MR. CHADwick and his zealous coadjutors
to remove, as soon as possible, from the public thoroughfares, those
leathern monsters, that, like an Alexandrine, or a Serpent, “drag their
#: length along,” to the terror of the timid, and to the inconvenience
OI all,
first, not to hurt the feelings of LoRD JoHN, who is a connection of
his." Indeed, I didn't think he was capable of extra zeal. He has
always given us to understand that his common zeal was wearing him
out as it is. -
“As to the chance of any of us reaching an Assistant Secretaryship,
we are just as likely to furnish a Prime Minister. Bless you, Sir! we
are not men of the family interest to aspire to such things.

Lords, has caused me many black looks and cold shoulders already.

A CURATE ON SUNDAY SHAVING.
The extremely reverend MR. KENT, curate of Upton-on-Severn, has
laid an information against the local barbers for shaving on Sundays.
As beards cease to grow upon the Sabbath, it is manifestly wicked to
shave them on the seventh day. However, there was a flaw in the
information, and the magistrates, warning the barbers of Upton-on-
§ºvern not to shave after half-past ten on the Lord's day, dismissed Mr.
KENT to his hermitage to ponder on the iniquity of Sabbath soapsuds.
MR. KENT himself—we speak upon the authority of our own corre.
spondent—always shaves on the Saturday night, so that he may, under
the circumstances, * as bare-faced as possible in the pulpit on
Sunday. MR. KENT has, of course, been reviled by the scorners of
Upton-on-Severn; but, on the other hand, he has been highly honoured
by the elect, who look upon a Sunday razor as an instrument no better
the scissars of DALILAH.
A testimonial has been presented to MR. KENT; a testimonial—the
product of subscriptions of many worthy wives and spinsters of Upton:
on-Seyern. A complete set of shaving-tackle, charmingly illustrative of
the KENTEAN piety, was yesterday, presented to the curate. (Regard-
lºss of expense, we have obtained the intelligence by electric telegraph.)
The gift is very pertinent—very handsome.
.The shºwing-brush. is of good, stout, mortifying hedgehog, set in
hiccory, . The soap-dish is very massive, cast out of pewter pots con-
demned for short measure. The soap is real Naples, with a sulphurous
ºdour. The razor, a scraper begged from the door-step of SIR ANDREw
AGNew, and ground to the finest edge. The stropis made from an old
cover of Fº: Book of Martyrs.
R. KENT, received the testimonial with mixed feelings of piety and
gratitude. Calling for hot water, he begged to be permitted to show his
thankfulness, by shaving in the presence of the deputation. This
º request was handsomely accorded; and it says no little for the
“elings of the curate, and no less for the hedgehog brush and razor
when we assure our readers, that the deputation left the reverend and
respected gentleman with tears rolling down his cheeks.

STRONG CLAIMS TO A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT.

* A MR. CHAPMAN has expressed his opinion that SIR CULLING
EARDLEY will be a better Member of Parliament than MR. DENISON,
because the former is the stronger and healthier individual. ...We know
that physical strength is rather necessary for an M. P. in these days
when legislation is the work of nights; but we are not quite prepared
to admit that animal power, or in other words, physical force, is the one
thing needful in the House of Commons. If this were the case, the
strong man from Greenwich, Fair, who lifts a ton weight with his
teeth, and º: it over his head with a toss of his chin, would be the
most eligible person for a seat in Parliament. -
We know that there are a good many heavy measures to be carried,
and a great quantity of dead weights to be thrown off by the energy of
our M. P.'s º: we might as well return a Parliament of coal-whippers,
or send BARCLAY & PERKINs's little army of draymen into the Lower
House, as accept the principle on which SIR. CULLING EARDLEY is
recommended to the electors of the West Riding. A portrait of SIR
C. E., with the ladder of Parliamentary ambition on the tip of his
nose, and a chair or comfortable seat at the top of the ladder, would
form a yery good subject for an election squib, and we suggest the sub-
ject to his Committee, with our full permission to make use of it.

OWERFLOWS AT THE OLD BAILEY.
THE Old Bailey officials are reaping a splendid harvest from the succession of crowded courts
that have been attracted by the recent performances. The Chartist trials, embracing the talents
of the ATToRNEY-GENERAL in the leading business, with MR. BALLANTINE as a highly respect-
able second, and MR. CLARKson, the acknowledged “heavy man,” brought into play a phalanx
of forensic strength that drew together very numerous audiences, while the interesting legal
drama of the BARoness St. MART has given to this usually dull part of the season a very
owerful impetus. We have received a complaint from a simple youth, a member of Lincoln’s-
nn, who, ºf heard of students' seats in the courts of law, went the other day to the
Old Bailey in the capacity of a student, expecting to receive theº: of the entrée. On
applying to the door-keepers his claim was coolly ignored, and half-a-crown was demanded as
the price of his admission. Not satisfied with the fees, the Old Bailey functionaries have
taken to the undignified process of touting, and have commenced the practice of describing
what is going on inside, for the purpose of tempting the public to walk up, and pay their
money. Our student correspondent was assailed by all the arts of puffery, equalled only by
the celebrated appeals of the showman, whose stentorian cry of “Alive! alive!” calls the atten-
tion of the public to some alluring alligator who is to be seen inside, with an º new set of
teeth, and an extra joint to his tail; or the Norfolk giant, with six additional inches of gutta
Fº on his boots, to add to his stature. Our student was tantalised by the assurance
from the door-keeper that “Cockburn was knocking the maid-servant all to bits,” and that
if the applicant for admission wanted to hear the best of it, he had better pay his half crown at
once, or he would miss the cross-examination, which the janitor described as “a right down
smasher, and no mistake.”
It seems to be such a regular practice to charge for admission to the Old Bailey, that we think
the prices ought to be printed at the bottom of the true Bills found by the grand jury. As
it is the fashion to reduce the admission to public entertainments, we must confess we look
upon half-a-crown as rather too much for the gallery of the Old Bailey, even when Cockburn
has got a servant girl in hand, or Wilkins has seized a dubious policeman between his
forensic teeth, and is tearing him and his testimony to taſters. As to the students' seats, we
begin to believe that they are mere myths, and that the students are as seatless in the Old
Bailey as the angels are when cut in stone on the monuments of antiquity.
We understand that the traffic in places at the Old Bailey is carried on to such an extent by
the lower officials, that it has been º: to let the Jury Box as a Fº: and turn in
the twelve honest men anywhere on the floor of the Court, or amongst the barristers.
THE COST OF “GREAT BARGAINS.”
It is an alarming fact, that the malady of
*:::::::::::: is very prevalent among the
ladies of England. Messrs. Howell, JAMEs,
AND Co. have written a letter to the Times,
complaining of some rogues who go about the
country, selling worthless goods under an
assumed commission from their firm. They
observe:-
“We have endeavoured by all means in our power
to prevent the use of our name, but cannot succeed.
and we regret to say, that these parties are much
encouraged in their º by the very unfor-
tunate, but strong-feeling in the minds of English
ladies, to secure what they are told is a “great bar-
gain,” but which always turns out to be a something
that would be dear at half the price paid for it.”
This defective vision of the British Ladies
arises entirely from weakness—from a debi-
lity of intellectual perception and the moral
sense. The latter renders them desirous to
et goods for less than they are worth, the
ormer blinds them to the fact that the con-
verse desire is as natural to the vender.
If they would but consider that sellers
may be as fraudulent as customers, and are
º: very much deeper; that there is as
ikely to be a “do” on the farther as on the
hither side of the counter, the one behind it
being considerably more cunning, they would
always deal at a respectable shop, and eschew
those “great bargains” and “tremendous
sacrifices,” which, only result in themselves
being greatly sold, and their money tremend-
ously sacrificed.

Louis NAPOLEON ONTHE SUBLIME.
THE library of PRINCE Louis NAPoleon,
who, now that he aspires to govern a great
nation, would seem to think any further cul-
tivation of his mind unnecessary, has, accord-
ing to the Morning Post, been sold by auction.
The literary treasures, included a copy of
LAMARTINE’s poem of Jocelyn. On theinside
of the cover the following annotation had
been written by the princely proprietor:-
“Undertook the reading of this book at Florence.
Sunday, the 7th of May, 1837. Abandoned it as being
too sublime for me.” Undertook the reading for the
second time, Monday the 8th, without being more
fortunate. Recommenced by a new effort, Tuesday,
the 9th, and abandoned it definitively.”
Substituting “the Presidency of the French
Republic,” (and we wish he may get it) for
“the reading of this book,” and making the
requisite alterations of place, and dates, we
think it by no means improbable that the
above critique will have epitomised the future
political career of PRINCE Louis Napoleon.
---
--All Stuff.
THE juniors of the Equity Bar complain,
with some justice, that the present Loºn
CHANcellon has made no silk gowns, and
the consequence is that the space below the
bar is over-stuffed in the most inconvenient
manner. It has been suggested that his
Lordship will not give the elder juniors silk
—or in other words, silk’em—because he is
naturally partial to Corres *ext.
N.B. The forcing of this joke into Panch’s
pages is a flagrant act of trespass, and we
. instruct anybody who will take the
trouble, to apply for a certiorari to move the
said joke out again as early as possible.

THE FRENCH FEMALE SOCIALISTS.
It may be expected that in the next French Revolution-come when
it will—the women will be in the first rank, and the washerwomen, if
we may believe the Semaphore du Sud, will be ready to plunge into hot
water with an alacrity characteristic of their calling. The next
barricades of Paris will be formed of the washing-tubs and mangles of
those whose feelings have been already mangled by a refusal to recog-
mise their claims, and they will show themselves impatient of their
irons by throwing them—flat as well as Italian—upon the soldiery. We
shall find the blanchisseuse opposing the approach of cavalry by drawing
up a detachment of clothes horse, and she will show herself no less
expert in getting up a fine row than in getting up fine linen. The
authorities must not be soporific in º of these viragos of the
soap-suds, who are eager to form a lather for the purpose of lathering
the authorities.
INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE.
It was natural that, at a juncture like that of the Presidential Elec-
tion, L-U-s N-P-L-N should seek for counsel from his friends on this

to lay before the public some extracts from the very interesting corre-
spondence of the P-E and his English advisers:–

“CHER CoMTE,
“It is very embarrassing. The accounts, as they come in,
swell my majority more and more. I shall certainly be returned, and
by the absolute majority. Then, you see, I am President at once, and
the Assembly will not be called in to decide between me and my rival,
this excellent CAvAIgnac. It is too much honour forme. My dear friend,
I have been too calm, too prudent. They have found out, they say, that
I am a man of vast &pacity. They discover ideas in my bulletins, of
which I had no conception. The Invalides insist upon it, that I am to
restore the armies, wars, and glories of the Empire; the Legitimists,
that I am to overthrow the Republic; the Orleanists, that I am to rule
through a Dynastic Ministry, and so pave the way for the amiable PR-N-E
DE Jo-Nv-LL-E.; the épiciers, that I am to restore trade; the rentiers
that I am to raise the 5 percents. to par; the Red Men, that I am to
open the career for the talents, remodel society, substitute the sense of
duty for the sense of self-interest, set up association for competition,
and extirpate vice and misery.
“All this is a vast mission for a single man; and I begin to feel
unequal to the actual situation. What is to be done? I repeat, it is
embarrassing to sit with the eyes of Europe upon one. Furnish me,
my dear friend, with a programme. You have much experience of
society. Perhaps you might be willing to aid me here in person. At
least open to me your heart. I am indeed in an embarrassment,

“CHER PRINCE,
“Your position reminds me of an anecdote told of the man
who won an Elephant in a raffle, and was much perplexed what to do
with his large prize. You have won your Elephant.
“It is indeed embarrassing. You cannot satisfy everybody. Pardon
me, if I say rather, I do not think you can satisfy anybody, for every
party expects of you something different from the other.
“For your obliging offer—I must answer no. The Arts engross me
wholly—I have taken to religious painting in the great style, and find it

“DEAR AND ILLUSTRIous ARTIST, ----
“STANDING on the pinnacle of success, on which thirty millions
contemplate me with astonishment, I fly to you, worthy repository of
hallowed recollections, illustrious successor of that mighty uncle, who
in you has lived again on the boards of Astley, amidst the cruel and
haughty insulars (unworthy of a genius like yours)—I fly to you
for inspiration, as to a source of historic tradition, a living record of
the departed great.
“France has chosen me her chief, as forty-four years ago she chose
that hero to whose memory you and I have dedicated ourselves. At
such a moment I feel that the uncle should revive in the nephew.
“Come, then, to me—to the Tuileries. There I may place myself
once more under your tuition, to fit myself for my great task of restor-
ing to France its Emperor. Come, and do not forget the properties.
Soon it may be necessary for me to make a tour of the Departments, to
present myself to the country that, in choosing me, does honour to a
recollection, which your lessons alone can assist me to up before
them in living, moving majesty. Quit, then, Astley's, that scene of your
triumphs. Leave that modest retreat in which you brood over the
recollection of Austerlitz and Marengo. Come to my palace and my
heart. Rooms shall be prepared for you, with trophies and memorials
of him. “With respect and affection,
“L–s N-P-L-N.”
IV.-From MR. GomeRSAL to L-s N-P-L-N.
“MY DEAR P-E,
“It does my heart good to find, at last, that the French are
going in for the legitimate business, and choosing one from the acknow-
ledged stock to be their manager... I was delighted to find your election
had been a bumper-crowded houses—immense hit-and, in fact,
a blaze of triumph. Indeed, from your first appearance on the stage,
I knew you .# do it, and exclaimed—aside—with Hamlet, ‘Oh, my
prophetic soul, his uncle!” -
“I need not say how your success comes home to my business and
my bosom. To think that the hat, boots, and grey surtout, that will
hardly draw a house at Astley's now, except on an 18th of June, can
still pull 'em in, in your Circuits—I mean Departments—in millions, is
“a comfort to my age,’ as Wolsey has it. am glad to see you are
not like some other stars I could mention, jealous of all other talent,
and ready to forget former lessons.
“I shall have much pleasure in doing anything Ican for your benefit,
in the genuine Emperor line—and I think that between us, what
with your NAPOLEoN ideas, and my NAPOLEoN togs and props,
we may “win golden opinions,’ as Macbeth styles 'em, which are
the ‘sovereign'st thing on earth’ as Hotspur would say, for one whose
reputation, hitherto provincial, ought now ioaspire to become European.
As to my coming over to give, lessons in the real thing, or to make
a tour of the Provinces with you, I shall be delighted; but Hal, an
thou lov'st me,’ ‘put money in my purse’—as in the distracted state
of your treasury I should’nt be surprised to find myself on half-salary-
“a thing most tolerable and not to be endured.’ -
... So no more from one, who, tho' now in “his sear and yellow leaf, is
still, in regard for your late uncle, “Sincerely yours,
GomeRSAL.”
“P.S. Don't forget the magnanimous business. You remember that
scene with the Scotch Prisoner. Pitch in your clap-traps—"bits of
fat’ we call 'em.—I take it, your's is a º: audience, and wants
something “hot and strong.’”

’ a call of Threepence per head, on the whole of the British population, will be

A CRUEL ATTACK UPON ATTORNIES.
WE are surprised, and something more, at the Times. It
is evident that, for the most part, that well-conducted and
generally delightful print has a malevolent intention to |
attornies in the black dye of its own ink, making, them muc
more dark than they are ordinarily painted. This is vulgar
—shameful. Only last week, we saw one respectable
man—he must have been three-score five, at least, with a
blue bag beside him—a respectable old gentleman, smelling a little of
pounce, and looking a little of parchment, we saw him, we say,
indignant and affected, as, he sat with the Times, newspaper in one
hand, a piece of biscuit in the other, and a glass of brown sherry on the
table before him. We like to be particular, and will give the time and
place. It was on the 13th of December, 2 P.M.–the third box upon
the right as you enter the Gray’s-Inn Coffee House. -
MR. REDTAPE (we inquired the name of the waiter) reads a letter in
the Times. The writer speaks of a “system of robbery, which consists
of small attornies purchasing small debts and bills under £20, and suing
the parties upon them in the superior courts for the sake of costs.”
“And why not; why not?” asks MR. REDTAPE of a gentleman opposite
(evidently a country client). “Did you ever hear the like, Sir?”
“The attorney claims the privilege of suing for a debt due to himself in his own
court, and of being out of the jurisdiction of the County Courts either as plaintiff
or defendant! This evasion of the sprit of the act surely was never intended
by the Legislature, and calls imperatively for attention.”
... Indeed!” says REDTAPE. “And so we’re to be stripped of all our
little rights? We are to have no privileges? An attorney is not to be
allowed to speculate a little, buying up small debts for the sake of
dearer practice, but is to be compelled to go, into the County Courts,
and get dirty, cheap law like any paltry individual out of the profession.
Why, Sir, carry this out, and what a blow will it deal upon many most
energetic attornies of the Hebrew persuasion—of men of enterprising
habits, who buy small debts, as graziers buy lean sheep, to ſatten 'em
into profit P But just hear the fellow.” (And REDTAPE reads)–
“A debt of £16 was speedily magnified by costs, &c. into e32, of which I have
paid £24, and having unfortunately made default “on the day' in payment of £8,
the balance, the next morning was served with a fresh writ for that amount, with
£1.15s. costs, and in a few days after a declaration, thus creating £4 more expenses,
and which, if not paid in four days, will be increased to £9 or £10 costs only.”
“And why not ?” asks REDTAPE. “Is not a law—at least proper law
-made for the use of attornies? Look here, Sir. I pay an annual sum
for my certificate. Just, Sir, as you pay for your shooting license.
And my certificate is as your gun, -I am to bag as much game as I can
with it. The County Court is a shabby, paltry place; not fit for a
gentleman to practise in. There’s no game—no game, Sir. I might
as well ask you, with a license, to pop only at may-bugs and cock-
chafers. And so, being duly certificated to kill, I, as an attorney and
* by Act, of Parliament, bang away in the superior courts.
nd this—this little privilege—they would deprive us of All I say is
this; I respect the laws of my country, so long as they’re profitable;
but if they attempt any more of what they call their reforms, I only
hope I shall not be found with my coat off, throwing up a barricade.”
THE PILOTS THAT ARE TO WIEATHER THE FRENCH
STORM.
THERE are some doubts about the Ministry of Louis-NApoſſeon.
We give the following as the most correct, for it has been forwarded to
us by the Electric Telegraph, which is known never to exceed the
truth. None other, consequently, is genuine:—
Minister of Justice - -
Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Minister of the Interior
Munister of Finance - -
Minister of Public Works .
Miniºter of War - - - - -
Governor of Algeria . . - -
The President of the Council will be MossIEUR GoBERT, the cele-
braed Napoleon of the Cirque, and every theatre on the Boulevards,

distinct unders'anding that PRINCE Louis is not to speak a single
word—which he has most handsomely promised; as he declares, yery
innocently, that he has nothing to say, and is not particular about
saying it.

a country like
rance, where only the highest things are ridiculed, is a

PRINCE Louis, when he puts himself at the head of the Cabinet, will
soon prove that there is nothing in it.
THE NEW FLOATING RAILWAY.
SoME ingenious gentleman, who seems to think that capital does not
get sunk rapidly enough in Railways, has proposed a floating line, which
will of course, if carried out, be exposed to more than the ordinary fluc-
tuitions to which these things are liable. The scheme may work well
enough when matters go on smoothly, but when NEPTUNE has a bill-
or a bill-ow—to take up, and BoAEAs may be raising the wind to help
him out, we fear the traffic on the floating line would be entirely
swamped, to say nothing of the difficulty the engineers might experience
in taking their levels.

“NO SKETCHING ALLOWED.”
ARTISTs are not permitted to sketch in the Temple. Those excellent
friends of ours, the stout gentlemen in the aprons and brass badges,
whose arduous duty it is to drive out dogs, and do nothing about the
corners of the courts in sunshiny weather, have lately been drivin
away all persons attempting to carry off (in their sketch-books) any o
the ornaments of the Temple Church. The Benchers may, †.
be of opinion that the only copies that ought to be permitted within
their precinct, are those charged twopence a folio, which is considerably
under what a folio of (artist's) copies usually fetches.
In fact, the Temple is a drawing academy already, CHITTY supplying
the models, in the shape of very common forms, and all the drafts
drawn having one quality—colour—for which the English school, has
always been famous. Still, we cannot think the Bench are aware of the
prohibition recently issued by the honourable Beadles of their courts,
and we accordingly beg to move for a quo warranto, to show on what
authority those functionaries interfere with sketchers, or rather a pe-
remptory mandamus, to order them to abstain from doing so in future.

THE THREE CHRISTMAS WAITS.
My name is Pleaceman X;
Last night I was in bed,
A dream did me perplex,
Which came into my Edd.
* I dreamed I sor three Waits
A playing of their tune,
At Pimlico Palace gates,
All underneath the moon.
One puffed a hold French horn,
And one an old Banjo,
And one chap seedy and torn
A Hirish pipe did blow.
They sadly piped and played,
Dexcribing of their fates;
And this was what they said,
Those three pore Christmas Waits:–
“When this black year began,
This Eighteen-forty-eight,
I was a great great man,
: And king both wise and great,
And Munseer Guizot by me did show
As Minister of State.
“But Febuwerry came,
And brought a rabble rout,
And me and my good dame
And children à turn out,
And us, in spite of all our right,
Sent to the right about.
“I left my native º
I left my kin and kith,
I left º royal crownd,
Wich I couldn't travel with, -
And without a pound came to English
ground,
In the name of MR. SMITH.
“Like any anchorite
l’ve lived since I came here,
I’ve kep myself quite quite,
I’ve drank the small small beer, .
And the water, you see, disagrees with me
And all my famly dear.
“O, Tweeleries so dear,
O, darling Pally Royl,
Was it to finish here
That I did trouble and toylf .
That all my plans should break in my ands,
And should on me recoil
“My state I fenced about
With baynicks and with guns;
My ga's I portioned hout,
#. vives I got my sons;
O, varn’t it crule to lose my rule,
My money and lands at once #
“And so, with arp and woice,
Both troubled and shagreened,
I bid you to rejoice
O, glorious England's QUEEND !
And never ave to weep, like pore LOUIs.
PHILEEP,
Because you out are cleaned.
“O, Prins, so brave and stout,
Í's and before your gate;
Pray send a trifle hout
To me, your pore old Wait; .
For nothink could be vuss than it’s been
along with us,
In this year Forty-eight.”
“Wen this bad year began,”
The nex man said, saysee,
“I was a Journeyman,
A taylor black and free,
And my wife went out and chaired about,
And my name’s the bold CUFFEE.
“The QUEEN and HALBERT both, ,
I swore I would confound,
I took a haw fle hoath
To drag them to the ground;
And sevral more with me they swore
Aginst the British Crownd.
“Aginst her Pleacemen all,
We said we’d try our strenth ;
Her scarlick soldiers tall,
We vow’d we’d lay full lenth :
And out we came, in Freedom's name,
Last Aypril was the tenth.
“Three 'underd thousand snobs
Came out to stop the way,
With sticks with iron knobs,
Or else we’d gained the day.
The harmy kept quite out of sight,
And so ve vent away.
“Next day the Pleacemen came—
Rewenge it was their plann–

They took her tailor-mann:
And the hard hard beak did me bespeak
To Newgit in the Wann.
“In that etrocious Cort
The Jewry did agree;
The Judge did me transport,
To go beyond the sea:
And so for life, from his dear wife
They took poor old CUFFEE.

Great Prince, O call me back,
And I will be your Wait !
And never no more vill break the Lor,

The tailer thus did close
(A pore old blackyalore rogue),
When a dismal gent uprose,
And spoke with Hirish brogue : .
“I’m SMITH O'BRINE, of Royal Line,
Descended from RoRY OGUE.
“When great O'Connle died,
That man whom all did trust,
That man whom Henglish pride
Beheld with such disgust,
Then Erin free fixed eyes on me,
And swoar I should be fust.
“‘The glorious Hirish Crown,”
Says she, “it shall be thine:
Long time, its wery well known,
You k-p it in your line;
That diadem of hemerald gem

“‘Too long the Saxon churl
Our land encumbered hath;
Arise my Prince, my Earl,
And brush them from thy path;
Rise, nighty SMITH, and sveep em with
The besom of your wrath.’
“Then in my might I rose,
My country I surveyed,
I saw it filled with foes,
I viewed them undismayed;
Ha, ha! says I, the harvest's high,
I'll reap it with my blade.
“My warriors I enrolled,
They rallied round their lord;
And cheafs in council old
I summoned to the board—
Wise Doheny and DUFFY bold,
And MEAGHER of the Swold.
“I stood on Slievemamaun,
They came with pikes and bills;
They ga hered in the dawn,
Like mist upon the hills,
Aud rushed adown the mountain side
Like twenty thousand rills.
“Their fortress we assail;
Hurroo! my boys, hurroo!
The bloody Saxons quail
To hear the wild shaloo;
Strike, and prevail lovely Innisfail,

“Our people they defied;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FRENCH AND ENGLISH
CONSTITUTIONAL COOKERY.
THE British Constitution may be
compared, in some respects, to the
British Plum-pudding; for it is a mix-
ture peculiar to the country, and it
forms a magnificent whole which
foreign nations have vainly endea-
voured to imitate. France has lately
been incessantly occupied in a fruit-
less attempt to make up the com-
pound upon the English pattern,
but our neighbours, in spite of all
the proverbial excellence of French
cookery, have hitherto made a sad
mess of it. Having got hold of the
idea that we commence our plum-
pudding by tearing a quantity of suet
into shreds, they have been pulling
all the fat of the land to pieces;
but unfortunately so much of it was
already in a rancid state, that it is of
very little use, and has, to a certain
extent, tainted all the other ingre-
dients.
The English Constitutional Pud-
ding requires a proper distribution of
the plums; but the French have had
too many of their plums crowded
into one place, at the top of their
pudding, and in their recent attempts
to rectify the error, their Constitu-
tional cooks—of whom too many
have had a finger in the pie or pud-
ding—have been for the most part
eager to secure the plums to them-
selves, and the fruit has been greatly
diminished by the number of attempts
to get some good pickings. As a
substitute for the well-beaten eggs
in the British Constitutional Pud-
ding, from which the yolk is care-
fully rejected, the French have
adopted a system of battering, that
consists in battering each other; and
the milkiwe use in this country to
give softness to the compound, is
turned, by all the bitterness peculiar
to our Gall-ic neighbours, into some
curdled stuff, which gives a sourness
to their entire mixture.
But even if France had been per-
ſectly skilful in the choice of her
ingredients, [there is one omission
that would utterly'prevent the suc-
cess of her Constitutio-culinary expe-
riment. She has forgotten the small
quantity of flour that is required for
binding together all the rest; and
this little essential we happen to
possess in our limited monarchy.
Enough is wanted just to give con-
sistency and coherency to the whole
Constitutional compound, without
making it heavy and indigestible.
The attempt of France to find a
substitute for this valuable material
—this spoonful of flour—is shown in
the selection of Louis-NApoleoN,
who may unfortunately turn out to
be the spoon without the flour; or
at all events, if he should happen to
represent any of the latter material,
it will seem to be produced from

more chaff than grain, with a great
preponderance of straw, and re-
spected only on account of the origi-
mal seed from which it is a collateral
offshoot.
There is a story of a Frenchattempt
to make an English plum-pudding,
which failed from the omission of a
damp cloth; but we fear the recent
experiment of our neighbours will
not succeed, although, by way of
substitute for the damp cloth, they
have resorted to a wet blanket, by
allowing their Constitutional Pud-
ding to be wrapped up in a-Louis-
NApoleon. The pudding being
made, we fear it will take a very
long time boiling, and that it will
remain in hot water for a consider-
able period, amidst that
“Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble"
with which the French are only too
familiar. If they do not know, ex-
actly how to make their pudding,
they seem to be impressed with the
utility of keeping it on the continual
stir, and if they do not know how to
boil it to a nicety, or to determine
when it is done enough, they appear
to have a notion of putting it on to
the fire, or—to use a technical phrase
—going to pot with it, in the very
promptest manner.
HE AMALGAMATION OF THE
THREE GREAT RAILWAY COM-
PANIES sinks into a mere bagatelle in
comparison with the amalgamation of
PUNCH's own peculiar and various lines
in his ALMANACK for 1849.
The Paris Road to Glory.
ALL persons seem to agree in con-
sidering the election of the French
President as only “paving the way”
to something else. This unanimity
is certainly very complimentary to
the Prince, as it pulls him down at
once to the level of a mere stone,
which, we think, is rather hard. But
considering the very grea' antipathy
the French have to old travelled
roads, that the first effect a Revolu-
tion in France always has is to make
the stones rise, we doubt if “paving
the way” is the right expression.
We submit that “erecting a barri-
cade” would be much more in the
way of the French.

few Wiennese having been shot,
BLUM murdered, and so forth-now
FERDINAND has abdicated the throne
of Austria, he is eulogised to the

seem FERDINAND, like a guinea
twelfth-cake sacrificed for five shil-
lings,was much too sweet for a crown.

Tº presents his regretful Compliments to ANGELA.
He did not attempt to discover her in a Brixton 'Bus on Tuesday. Having
from the earliest dawn of reason determined never to marry any woman who
thought herself above Thick Boots, or believed in her superiority to Cork Soles,

A CHRISTMAS GAME COCK.
From a recent work on “Ornamental and Domestic Poultry,” we
learn that there is a certain amusement in the country, called “making
the cock drunk,” much practised by stable-boys. The game, consists
in seizing the poor unfortunate bird by the legs, and whirling him
round and round in the air. The great fun (stible boys have as yet
but cruel notions of fun) is in seeing the cock stagger and reel when
º: * the ground, and gradually recover as it unsteadily
walks. OII.
Now, is not, Le Coq Gaulois somewhat in the same position?...The
poor bird has been whirled round and round by so many revolutions,
that it has clearly lost its head. It has become quite unsteady in its
movements, reeling in all directions but the real one, till it becomes a
matter of doubt whether it will not fall every minute off its legs, and
scarcely have a feather left, but what is soiled with mud and dirt, to
plume itself upon. It may be good fun to us, who quietly look on, to
watch and laugh at the ludicrous movements of the fine old bird; but
too many of these revolutions may one day be the death of it. The old
Coq must not get drunk so often, or else it will be dragged eventually
through such a quagmire as will take years of washing to make it clean
again. It really should learn to grow a little more steady.
SECOND-CLASS COMPANY.
- A LETTER. signed, “A TRAVELLER,” which lately appeared
* in the Times, will afford a useful lesson to all persons in
& moderate circumstances, who are mean enough to think of
º, travelling in second-class carriages. The writer, with his
$º, family, was journeying on the GreatWestern Railway, having
* taken places in the second-class. They had not gone far
before they discovered that their fellow-passengers were a
drunken man, and woman, who annoyed and insulted them. . As soon
as they could, they quitted this carriage for another, in which they
found themselves in company with a madman; paying thus the usual
penalty of getting out of the frying-pan. The upshot of the matter was,
that these contemptible, economical people were driven into a first-
class carriage. Very right and proper. Railway Companies, in these
hard times, are justified in resorting to any legal means for the purpose
of obtaining the highest possible fares.
The poverty which cannot afford the first-class, ought to make folks
acquainted with strange companions. We venture to suggest to the
parties concerned, the expediency of allowing all chimney-sweeps
gratuitous admission to second-class carriages, and of making scavengers,
fresh and redolent from their employment, free of the same. There is
not a sufficient number of drunkards about, or of maniacs at large, to
render the cheaper seats necessarily intolerable. Nevertheless, they
would help the scavengers and sweeps in obliging the public to travel
by the first-class. No law exists to prohibit this arrangement; although
it is to be apprehended that an Act of Parliament will shortly compel
|Railway Directors to establish lunatic and tipsy classes of carriages;
or at least to protect HER MAJESTY's rational and sober subjects from
outrage and intimidation, by assigning to the insane and the inebriated
places in the train by themselves.

REMEMBER THE BEADLE.
SACRED to Memory is the buried Past;
The inward Eye beholds it as a Dream,
Whose hazy Forms are softened by a gleam
Of golden radiance, like the splendour cast
By Winter's Sun, about to look his last
O'er woodland valley, and majestic stream,
On a mild evening. Thou, whose mind doth teem,
A magic mirror, crowded thick and fast
With Images of the departing Year,
Behold among them. One—a Wision bright,
Which in blue, gilt, and crimson vesture flames.
Ah yes! amid the Šhapes that Memory frames,
The BEADLE hopes to captivate your sight,
Not vainly suing for a pot of beer.
THE TURNCOCK.
The Cataracts rush from the Mountains,
Laughing loud, ho, ho, ho! in their mirth:
And with frolicksome gambol, the Fountains
Bubble up from the bowels of Earth.
The Waters glide on to the Ocean,
From the Main to the Cistern they flow;
And the TURNcock, who sets them in motion,
For a Christmas Box waits down below.
THE REGULAR DUSTMAN.
I blame not Nature that she gave mine eye
A certain tendency towards my nose,
And bowed my legs; for hence I can defy
Unprincipled endeavours to impose.
Should any person unpossessed of those
Certificates, present himself as me,
Your palm against the base imposter close.
The REG'LAR DUsTMAN asks his Christmas fee:
Those blemishes will serve to show that I am he.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FALL OF THE QUADRANT.
NEveR, since the decline and fall of the Railway Share Market, or
of the Roman Empire, has there been a greater tumble than the recent
overthrow of the Quadrant. The decadence of the family of the
Colonna may be compared to that of the Colonnade of Regent Street.
Both had reached a high elevation, and both sunk under the ingratitude
of those to whom they had afforded shelter and protection. Already,
however, have the destroyers begun to regret their work of devastation,
and the unhappy foreigners who once used to nestle under its ſriendly
wing are wandering in damp and wretchedness, cursing the perſide
Albionism of those who, in reality, meant mort aur Français, when they
cried out for the destruction of the Colonnade of the Quadrant.
It is not, however, without a struggle that the ill-used foreigners will
resign the friendly roof; and they have reared a shade of umbrellas,

which form a kind of moveable colonnade, obstructing the light
almost as completely as before, and thus defeating the very objects of
those who caused the work of demolition to be performed. -
They have raised against the rays of the sun a barricade of gingham,
almost as impenetrable as that of lead, which has been removed; and
so dark are the designs—we mean the parapluies—of the foreigners,
that to see through them is almost impossible. Considering the
horrors of over-crowding, against which a movement is on foot, we
begin to shudder at the local congestion that is likely to be occasioned
at the entrance of the Burlington Arcade, by driving the French and
Italian loungers at the West End, during the London Season, into the
only covered promenade that is now left for them.
The Burlington and Lowther Beadles must be something more than
men, and their bàtons something more than wood; their nerves must
be more than iron, and the heads of their staves something more than
brass, to enable them to stem the tide of over-population that is likely
to flow in upon them.

WHAT will Count D'Orsay do, unto MR. HogaRTH, printseller, of
the Haymarket?, How can he best acknowledge the delicate, the
tasteful mode with which the tradesman invites an enlightened public
to “walk in" and see the D'ORsay Picture, which—
“In its high intellectual character, and the simplicity of its conception, has excited
an ertraordinary sensation. The picture was only intended for private view, but on
account of the emotions which have been elicited by the contemplation of the work,
MR. Hoganth has prevailed upon the Count to allow it to remain at his house,
where it may be seen during the present week.”
It is sweet to know that there are publishers who may be influenced
by “the emotions.” They care not about subscribers’ names to the
prospectus of a work “in the line manner;” they are only influenced
by the solemn effect of “contemplation l’” Hence, MR. Hogarth,
who has no intention to make a farthing by a subject “suggested to the
Count” by St. LUKE's Gospel, ch. xxi., v. 33, nobly invites the world
to bestow upon it a cheap, delicious treat of “the emotions.” ãold
goes for nothing; all's for the feelings!

THE CHRISTMAS BOX NUISANCE.
Aſ
Tºº
C |
f º
|.
THow much longer, we ask with º sorrow, is the humbug of
Boxing-day to be kept up for the sake of draining the pockets of
struggling tradesmen, and strewing the streets of the metropolis
with fuzzy beades, muzzy dustnen, and intoxicated—but constant—
scavengers? We have received the usual intimation from our pertina-
cious friend who eases us of our dust, that he expects us to come down
with our dust in another sense, at what the fellow sarcastically calls
“this festive season.” The gentleman who boasts of his “constancy”
in scavenging—as if he loved the mud and stuck to it—has apprised us,
according to his annual custom, that we are to ascertain his genuineness
by a dog with a black eye, a white nose, a red ear, an absent tail, a
swelling on his left cheek, and other little symptoms of his having lived
the life of a busy dog rather than of a particularly lucky one.
The Christmas Box system is, in fact, a piece of horribly internecine
strife between cooks and butchers' boys, lamp-lighters, beadles, and all
classes of society, tugging at each other's pockets for the sake of what
can be got under the pretext of seasonable benevolence. Our cooks
bully our butchers for the annual Box, and our butchers take it, out of
us in the course of the year by tacking false tails on to our saddles of
mutton, adding false feet to our legs of lamb, and chousing us with
large lumps of chump in our chops, for the purpose of adding to our
bills by giving undue weight to our viands. Punch has resolved on the
§ºw of the Boxing system, and down it will go before 1849 has
explied.
PUNCH*S REVIEW.
“Anecdotes of the Aristocracy: ”—CoBURN.
WE seldom review books, we read so many. But when a volume like
the present comes upon us, though we do not read it, we feel it our
duty to review it. MR. BURKE, the historian of the Peerage—we know
this by the comely appearance of the work—has put all his soul into
this production. Here are a couple of extracts, highly honourable to
the Aristocracy. They are the newest anecdotes; fresh and new as
ºf eggs. We quote them alike for their substance and their
yie:-
“His GRAcE THE DUKE of MARLBorough is, it is well known, a person of the
shmplest manners, the most unostentatious habits. No one, unconscious of his
pension, would for a moment think him a nobleman. Hence, last summer, as he
stood at the outer gate of Blenheim, he was accosted by a party of three Londoners.
"I say, Mister,’ said one of the vulgar Cockneys—evidently a shoemaker—“I say,
how much to see this?’ The Duke—for he is a wag—to keep up the joke, said–
Half-a-crown for the three.' Whereupon, the money was given into the Duke's
hand, and his Grace, still enjoying the jest, showed the strangers the grounds., “I
think,’ said one of them, in the course of the walk, “I think, as we pay the Duke a
pension, and moreover bought this place for his ancestor, he might put the people
on theºre. list!' The Duke said nothing at the time; but when he had conducted
the visitors to the gate, he returned to one of them the half crown, saying, “My good
friend, if all the people are not on the free-list, you, at least, may congratulate your-
sºlves —here the Duke, unbuttoning his great-coat, showed the Fleece at his neck-
that yon came in with an order.” The astonishment of the vulgar visitors may be
more easily pictured than printed.”
The second anecdote is not so pungent; but touching withal:-
“The Duke of St. ALBANs, Hereditary Grand Falconer, is a great goose-breeder.
He employs a vast number of gosherds to tend the birds upon one of his estates
upon the fens. Last autumn, his Grace—he is distinguished for his condescension
–presided one Saturday at the payment of his people. Simon Bluff-an intelligent
boy, a gosherd of some ten years old—was called to the table to receive eighteen-
pence, his week's wages. The boy refused to take the money. Upon being pressed
for the reason of his denial, he ingenuously replied, “Why, 'cause all the geese on
Monday morning flied away, and how could I take money for looking arter birds,
when there was no birds to look arter f" The Duke, returning home, immediately
sent in his resignation as sinecurist Falcorer... In humble imitation of Simon
Blurr, he even refused to take the current quarter's salary. This is true nobility.”
So it is: Punch says ditto to MR. BURRE.

REPUBLIC OF LETTERS, in favour of Mr. Punch, whose claims to the
distinction will be found in his ALMAN ACK for 1849.

ordered one cup of coffee and three saucers.

MR. TURNER, in a recent Lecture at Manchester, averred, with
reference to brass bands, that “no man was ever known to blow the
largest horn and live beyond a period of three years.” It is, however,
otherwise with man and his own trumpet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MISERABLE WARM CHRISTMAS.
If this very mild weather continues, it will have a very curious effect
upon Christmas—and not a pleasant effect either. One thing is certain,
no fires will be wanted: the heat will be too much; and can you fancy
a Christmas without a good, roaring, blazing coal-fire? The chesnuts
may º: themselves upon escaping a good roasting; but they
ill be the only parties benefited by the emptiness of the grate. There
will be no kettle singing on the hob, and every time more hot water is
| wanted for the negus, or the punch, or the bishop, the bell will have to
berung, and the servants pulled away from their amusements down in the
kitchen, to bring up a niggardly pitcherful at a time. The plates will
be cold, also, for dinner, instead of their being drawn out from the plate-
warmer so hot that when the mince-pies are put upon them,they smoke,
j. and hiss *. And, worse than all, there will be no family
circle round the fender, when the last dance is over, and the musicians
have taken their supper and left, and the lanternman outside has gone
home; there will be no inducement to hang over the mantelpiece, an
bring your chairs as close as possible to the chimney, just to have a
quiet chat before going to bed.
It will be a strange Christmas. If the mildness is drawn still milder,
we shall be gradually going back to the Dog-days, and be obliged to eat
our turkey and Christmas, pudding with the windows wide open; and,
instead of screens to the backs of the chairs, ladies will be calling out
for fans. Ices will be served round, the gentlemen will come in white
trowsers, and spring muslims will supersede silks and satins, and old
ladies will be obliged to discard for once their heavy velvet dresses, and
to carry on their heads something lighter than a massive turban loaded
with more bugles than there are in KoeNIG's . And where will be
the romps, the games, and the furious gallops that threaten to break
down the drawing-room floor, and annihilate the cosy party of old
gentlemen who are having their grog underneath? Why, the weather
will be so mild, that not even one of the handsome Guards, who seem
to dance more than anybody else, will be able to find a partner. The
universal excuse will be, “Really it is too warm to dance!”
It will be a strange, out-of-the-way, unseasonable Christmas!. One
might as well be at Sierra Leone, or give a ball in the crater of
Vesuvius. Decidedly, we shall watch the barometer, and put our hand
out of window every morning, to feel if it is any colder; and unless
d|there is a small touch of the frost—we do not mind how small, as small
as ToM THUMB if you like—before the 22nd, we shall make up a pic-
nic party, and go and spend Christmas Day in the heart of Iceland, or
on the summit of Mont Blanc.
Persons who are anxious to join our frost-party are requested to
enter their names forthwith at the Punch Office. None but jolly, good.
humoured persons need apply.
JOKES FOR JUNIOR BARRISTERS.
N consequence of the largeness of the demand and the
smallness of the supply of Jokes in the Courts of Law,
MR. BRIEFLEss has resolved on forming a class of his
young friends—jolly Old Juniors of not less than ten
years’ standing—for the purpose of exercising them in
|, the art of joking, an art in which he hopes they will
} obtain proficiency under his system, in six easy lessons.
MR. BRIEFLEss, refers with pride to the following
| specimen of a joke made by one of his young pupils—
a bald-headed Junior of fifty-five—after a short course of
A study. Having been called upon to examine a witness
3 in an undefended cause, he found that the evidence
was getting rather vague, and made the following happy
observation:— - - -
“Since, Sir, you can say nothing def-in-ite, I think
you had better be dumb-in-it. You may stand down, Sir.”
MR. BRIEFLEss flatters himself that the above result
of his system is a very superior article to that which is
usually produced in a Court of Law or Justice. -
MR. BRIEFLEss contemplates carrying his method to such perfection
that he will be enabled to teach the difficult art of joking in two and
three parts, or in other words, harmonising a joke so that the leader
and the junior, with occasionally even the opposite counsel, may have
a share of it... Specimens of these comprehensive jokes are being pre-
pared, and will shortly be submitted to the attention of the profession.
Should his idea, be generally approved, MR. BRIEFLess will make
arrangements with Mr. HULLAH for the alternate use of his singing-
hall, so that there may be ample room for the formation of classes on a
scale of the utmost magnitude.
ExTRAORDINARY EVENT.-Last week a French eagle hatched an
egg; when, oddly enough, the thing produced was a gosling !

“OH, wasn't I glad, old Punch, to see that letter from the chap
at Birchblossom Hall about the Christmas Holidays?, And
didn't we all here, at Cane Brake House, give him three cheers?
Do go on, Mr. Punch, and put a letter in every week, 'specially
'bout us little boys who aint at all treated at home as little boys-
not that we're so little, neither—ought to be. I tell you how they
served me, -and a good many more chaps upon my form. -
“I don't know when I’ve had a new jacket; not but what I'm ºld
enough, and more than that, to go into tails; but I mean that the
governor's always cut down for me, and one of his coats-threes into

it. Same with trowsers. Same with waistcoats. There’s an Orleans
plum-coloured velvet that I’ve worn this last half year, that the
governor wore hisself when he first brought me to school; and a coat
of pepper-and-salt; and I’m ‘bliged to wear 'em both, and the boys
call me sometimes pepper-castor, sometimes damson jam: ur
gov'nors don't know what it is to get a name at school. I’ve had
three fights; one black eye about the pepper, and such a nose all along
of the damson. Therefore, I hope you’lſ put this in; and I remain

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 273
John Bull Kicks the Old Year Out,
And the Old Year reads him a Moral.
Now get you out, and join the rout
Of all bad years gone by,
And don't believe a soul will grieve
When with the past you lie.
A sadder year, a sorrier year,
I never look to know;
In blood more rife, in sack and strife,
In war, and want, and woe.
All o'er the earth, with mocking mirth,
You dashed old thrones about ;
Made monarchs run from pike and gun,
Put Ministers to rout.
A desperate year, a drunken year,
With wine of madness stung—
You scattered words more sharp than swords,
And firebrands of the tongue.
In cellars damp, by stealthy lamp,
In garrets bleak and bare,
You crept and cowered, you lurked and lowered,
To plot, and plan, and snare;
You tempted fools, the traitor's tools,
To put their trust in knaves,
Urged Chartists on to Kennington,
And served out Specials’ staves.
You bade the mean detest the high,
The high distrust the mean,
All steps you staid that had been made
To bridge the gulf between;
You used to alms hard, honest, palms,
And closed them up from toil,
Cursed Labour's rest with dreams unblest,
Of slaughter, strife, and spoil.
A cruel part in mill and mart, "
In forge and field, you played;
Laid Riot’s knife to Traffic's life,
The feet of Commerce staid.
Ships, bound for sea, at idle quay
ou bade still idly stay—
Stoppered the crane, unhorsed the wain
And locked the bales away.
A year of hate from man to man,
A year of threatened war,
Of hopes undone, and gains unwon—
A bankrupt year you are.
And as you lie, in act to die,
No pious hand I lay
On eyes that cast a blight and blast,
Since first they saw the day.
So get you gone-for dreariest one
Of years yet passed away.
The Year answers.
The breath apace ebbs to my face,
Shadows about me throng—
Then hear a rede may challenge heed,
In answer to thy wrong;
We years are things that move on wings
Guided by higher Powers;
What shade we throw o'er worlds below
Is at their will, not ours.
Small gift have I—hast thou—to spy
Into that hidden will;
But this believe—that we have leave
From Good, and not from Ill.
The shadows black that mark my track,
Have light within their breast;
My sorest hour hath healing power,
y curses even are blest,
Fierce is the fire through whose red ire
Nations must pass—nor quail;
But Truth’s a gem doth fire contemn—
'Tis counterfeits that fail.
What toil secures, that most endures—
Worthless, what's easy gained;
'Tis mighty shocks that rive the rocks,
With gems and treasure veined.
Old Order’s dead—but in its stead
New Order see begun—
The ruddy night where sinks my light
Bespeaks to-morrow's sun;
Then ease my head upon my bed,
And close my glazing eye;
My evil day will pass away,
y good will never die.
SWEEPI SWEEP 1
We thought the cry of “Sweep!” was put down by Act of Parlia-
ment, but it has lately come up in another form. You cannot pass a
shop without a big Sweep calling out from the window. Sometimes, it
asks you to “STOP1’ sometimes it invites you to "LOOK HERE!”
These Sweeps seem to have the management of all the retail London
business. Nothing is too high or too low for them to lay their dirty
fingers upon. In one street it is a piano, in another it is a plum-pud-
ding, which is not exactly the article we should like to take from the
hand of a ...; They are general dealers in everything.
The Sweeps have been swept from our chimneys by the Ramoneurs;
but they have fallen down #. Trade, and you will find a Sweep now
on almost every counter. They have taken to sweeping the pockets of
customers clean, instead of their flues. They have introduced them:
selves into every channel of Commerce. We should not be astonished
to see advertised, “A handsome young lady, worth £300 a year,” to be
disposed of in so many shares by a Sweep. , Members of Parliament
will be returned by their agency, and we shall be having our Legislature
a more perfect system of Lottery than ever. -
In the meantime, nothing goes off unless it has a Sweep to back it.
Our race-horses are ridden by Sweeps, our grocers, publicans, and
little haberdashers are all under the thumb of a Sweep-and you will
see the Pavilion at Brighton taken off the hands of the Commissioners
of the Woods and Forests by means of a good powerful Sweep, of the
strength of £1,000,000 in shares of £1 each. These Sweeps are
getting quite a crying nuisance, and we hope a sweeping, measure will
soon be devised to, brush them indiscriminately from all the large, and
especially the small shops of the metropolis where they have got a foot-
ing. They are universal gay deceivers. They make the finest promises,
get your money, and then laugh in your face. ...They carry off all the
booty they can, and leave nothing but a dreary “blank” behind. The
poor people who trust their shillings to them, should be warned against
their winning, practices. The old law should be enforced, and every
shopkeeper who cries “Sweep!” should be immediately taken up.
THE HOUSE-KEEPING CLUB,
LUBs' Clubs'! This is the
age of Clubs; and one Club,
in these days, knocks another
Club on the head, until it is
a wonder how so many con-
trive to prolong their exist-
ences. The latest new scheme
is a House-Keeping Club, the
members of which are to
have access to a common
larder, and club together for
the provisions of all the mem-
bers and their families. This
might answer very well if the
families were all of a size,
and the appetites of the
members about upon a par;
but it will certainly never
pay for the very small eaters
to contribute the same sum
of *: as those who are given to gormandise. It will be awkward,
too, if the tastes of the members should agree to such an extent that
all should be eager for the same joint at the same time, and there
should one day be such a run upon º of mutton, and another day
such a cut into chops, that there should be a quarrelling amongst the
members for the tit-bits of the establishment. We fear the House-
Keeping Club will end in that monstrum...horrendum, “a house
divided;” for the proverb concerning a multiplicity of cooks, must
equally apply to a multiplicity of housekeepers.

PITY THE POOR INDEX-WRITER
ONLY consider the everlasting industry, the indomitable patience, the curious
talent it requires to constitute a great Index-writer. Oblivion is his fate—
silent contempt his only reward. His work is referred to probably more than
any other in the book; he is always a friend in need when you are in search of
a good article; he is ready at a moment's notice to point out some particular
subject you long to cry or laugh over, and still his work is uncared for, his
serried columns of interesting figures are looked over with dry indifference, and
not one person in a hundred thousand who takes a valuable volume, such as the
Encyclopædia Britannica, or Punch, is actually aware there is such a person
employed ". it as the Index-writer.
t is too bad. Talents like his deserve a higher recognition. Think of the
coolness of head, the firmness of hand, which his work requires! Consider the
mischief he might, cause if he inadvertently put a 9 instead of a 6. The
Index-writer gets blamed, and many are the #: denunciations vented some-
times upon his anonymous head—but he never gets, praised. He is thought
nothing of when he is right—and, yet when, by the strangest accident, he
happens to be wrong, Gracious! what an outcry there is, and nothing is too
bad for him.
Man is allowed to err at times, and is forgiven; but an Index-writer must be
without a fault—he must be perfection, itself. He is the virtual President
of the Republic of Letters, and universal sufferage is the only return he gets.
But “Wait a little longer.”. The position of the Index-writer must one day
be appreciated; the contempt has lasted too long. The brilliant merits of
the Index-Writer must shine through the fog that for ages has enveloped
them, and the World, will, with its future adoration, repair its past neglect.
Mankind is not naturally ungrateful.
We are proud to announce that the first step will immediately be taken
towards this mighty vindication. ...A young man of great talent, who has long
...ſº imself in the difficult walks, of Index-writing, is about to
republish a large collection of them! They will comprise 163 indexes, selected
from all styles of literature, including both the light and the heavy; and the
mass of learning they will exhibit will º astonish the
most contemptuous. This work cannot fail to be incalculably
valuable to our collection of belles lettres. The Index in
the present Number may be taken as a fair specimen.
WHAT CUPID SAW IN THE MISTLETOE BOUGH.
YoUNG Love has a fancy inclined to vagaries,
Which could we with form and with colour endow,
The show might resemble a mask of the Fairies
Which CUPID beheld in the Mistletoe Bough.
All under the leaves tiny couples were wooing;
What beating of bosoms, what heaving of sighs!
What kneeling and suing—what blling and cooing!
What breathing of vows, and what making of eyes!
With bride-cakes each spray thick as berries was cover’d,
And studded with rings, shedding flashes and sparks;
And legions of elves in the foliage there hover'd,
That bore a resemblance to parsons and clerks.
And jewels were gleaming, and satins were glistening,
And orange-flowers blooming the branches between;
And many a marriage, and many a christening,
Appear'd going on in the Mistletoe green.
There shone a bright planet, beatitudes raining,
To gladden the union of husbands and wives;
The honey-moon there, at the full, never waning,
Transported each pair for their natural lives.
And Forty and Fifty, reclined in the gloaming,
Were gazing aloft on Love's beautiful star; .
And Sixty and Seventy by streamlets were roaming,
And Eighty to Ninety-five twang'd the guitar.
A matron of three-score and upwards was shopping:
Her elderly spouse held her shawl by her side;
An octogenarian the polka was hopping, .
As brisk as a bee, with his agile old bride.
And husbands, unlike egotistical gluttons, -
Were helping their wives to the prime of the joint;
And wives were attentively sewing on buttons—
Of conjugal duty a capital point.
In short, the whole scene was supremely Elysian;
And haply, if wedlock were true to its vow,
There might be a shadow of truth in the vision
Which CUPID beheld in the Mistletoe Bough.
THE GALLIC (WEATHER) COCK.
A PARIs correspondent of the Times informs us that the
Council-General of the Gironde is urging the National Assembly
to retire, and that the Departmental press concurs in the
request. The République de Tarbes says, that “if the 900
members of the Assembly represented the opinion of France
in April, they nowise represent that of France in December.”
To paint the picture of the chameleon, or the dying dolphin,
or to take a daguerréotype of PROTEUs or Lord BROUGHAM,
would be an easy task in comparison with that of representing
French public opinion. France, for the faithful expression of
her sentiments, requires a fresh Parliament at least every five
minutes. The emblem of France is said to be the Cock; but
the French Cock never crew. There is no such bird in the
ultry-yard. The Gallic Cock exists nowhere but on the
H.; or summit of the steeple. It is a weather-cock.
Time's Up.
Why should the good time that’s coming be only for the
“boys?” Why should the “girls” be excluded? Or why
should men and women not be allowed to have a share in, the
good time that is so long in coming By the bye, there
was no particular date fixed for the coming of this good time;
but unless it makes a little more haste, very few of the Boys
will live to see it... The portrait of the rare old Boy who sees
the “Good Time” (when it does come) will be a fine antique a
hundred years hence. He will be the Oldest Waiter on record.

Calculating Cubes. These
cubes, says the Times, are
intended
“To teach children the rudi-
ments of arithmetic, and to
avoid, whilst they are in pro-
gress of being taught, the
creation of that distaste for
the science of figures which
so frequently prevents the
proficiency of the pupil, and
makes so many adults inca-
pable of comprehending the
combinations and the results
i. the combinations of num-
ers.”
During the present
vacation, , these Calcu-
lating Cubes may afford
agreeable amusement,
blended with useful in-
struction,to the Ministers,
now home for the holidays.
They would furnish Lord
John Russell and his colleagues with a good game, with which to
play the old year out and the new year in. This pastime would be an
excellent preliminary to the preparation of the Budget. Let the
CHANCELLoR of THE ExchEQUER take a hand in it.
The Calculating Cubes would perhaps enable Government to apply
Addition to the rewards of literary and scientific men, Subtraction to
sinecures and to the excessive salaries of ex-Chancellors and other
over-paid officials, Simple Division to ecclesiastical property, and Reduc-
tion to the Estimates generally. They might also teach it to adjust
taxation, and especially the Income-tax, according to the rule of Pro-
ortion. They would thus remove that ignorance of the science of
gures which incapacitates so many adult statesmen from making, calcu-
lations which present no difficulty to any schoolboy who is a tolerable
accountant. Assuredly, the Calculating Cubes would afford the Cabinet
a much more seasonable recreation just now than the old-fashioned
sport of Blind-man's Buff, by which they are pleased to amuse them-
selves and the nation.
THE GRAVITY OF A JUDGE.
DURING the late Liverpool Assizes, on the trial of the prisoners
charged with riot at Manchester, one of the witnesses, an approver,
having been hissed, MR. BARON ALDERSON is reported to have made
the following speech:-
“Where is the man that hissed ? Let me see any one who defies the law:
I sit here alone, and with the whole majesty of the kingdom of England upon me;
and let me see the man who dares to face it !”
We do believe that the worthy Baron is an upright judge; but how he
can remain so with the tremendous weight of the whole majesty of the
kingdom of England upon him is wonderful... Perhaps a sporting con-
temporary can tell us what is the weight of JUDGE ALDERSON ?. It
would be worth while to convert the seat of Justice into a weighing-
machine, to ascertain, when the learned judge sits in it, how many
stone the index marks off on the register. From the above statement,
it is evident that the gravity of his Lordship is inconceivable—by any
one who never saw LISTON.
The Garden of Eden.
THE Daily News contains the following announcement:—
“Within the last five years the Rev. J. P. EDEN has been presented to four bene-
fices in succession, by the Bishop or Dunham. The last is Bishop Wearmouth,
value ±2000 a year!”
All doubts as to the exact locality of the Garden of Eden are now, of
course, set at rest. It blooms in the County of Durham |
Too Bad to be True.
THE poet tells us that “Bright things can never die;” but the
worst of it, is, that the brightest thing, par, ercellence, of the present
day—the Electric Light—is found to die with most annoying rapidity.
You are one moment in a blaze of sunshine, and the next minute in the
dark, which causes some over-critical people to declare that the merits
of STAITE's patent have been a little over-stated.
THE BALANCE OF POWER.
THE following paragraph furnishes a curious illustration of the
amusements and occupations of Royalty at a fashionable watering-place.
The extract is from the Brighton Herald of Saturday, Dec. 2, 1848:—
“The DUKE and Duchess of CAMBRidge and the PRINCEss MARY, in the course
of their promenade on the Pier on Monday last, visited PENNY’s Royal Bazaar for
the purpose of being weighed. The result was most satisfactory, especially
as regards his Royal Highness, who weighed exactly 16 stone. At a later period
of the week, being again on the Pier, the thought struck the Royal visitors to try
what effect the air of Brighton had had upon them ; again they seated themselves
in the machine, and our readers may smile, but it is a fact, that their Royal -
Highnesses had all increased in weight since their first experiment. PRINCE
METTERNich was also weighed on the first occasion; he was little more than 10
stone, and we do not know if the like increase has taken place in his frame.”
We do not º see what there was so very “satisfactory” in a
“result” which showed that the Duke of CAMBRIDGE weighed 16
stone, unless we are to look at a Prize, Royal Duke, as we should upon
a Prize Ox at the Smithfield Cattle Show. His Royal Highness is a
warm admirer of living suet on the sides of over-fatted cattle, and has
frequently honoured a wheezing brute at Baker Street, as Iago would
have honoured old Brabantio, by “yerking him under, the ribs;” but
we were not aware that the †: devotion to fat had induced him to
force himself and family into a state of pinguidity. - -
The rate at which the royal party are gaining flesh, and their anxiety
to add to their bulk, may be judged by their having rushed to the pier,
and plumped themselves down in the weighing-machine, a second time
within the same week, when they found they had been “taking on so,”
that they all weighed more than they had done a few days previous.
We do not know whether the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE in agines that he
derives additional weight in the social scale from the extra ponderosity
he is encouraging; but if this is really the case, we sincerely pity poor
PRINCE METTERNICH, who weighs six stone less than his Royal High-
ness, and whose increase of frame remains a matter of painful uncer:
tainty. Considering that the Austrians have so recently weighed
PRINCE METTERNIGH, and found him wanting, we are surprised at his
venturing so soon into the scale, where his deficiency would be easily
ascertainable.
It must be very gratifying to the DUKE, OF QAMBRIDGE to find that,
notwithstanding the cessation of the Public Dinner Season, he still
keeps up his substance, and has even been increasing it, though he has
occupied no other public chair than the weighing-chair on the Brighton
Pier for the last four months. As his visits are frequent to PENNY’s
Bazaar, we think it would be a graceful compliment to elect his Royal
Highness to the post, of perpetual chairman of the weighing-chair,
which, we should think, there is no one in Brighton could fill more
efficiently.
THE OPERA. TELAKOUPHANON.
OUR attention has been directed to an article made of Gutta Percha,
called the Telakouphanon, or Speaking Trumpet, a contrivance by
which it is stated, that a clergyman having three livings might preach
the same sermon in three different churches at the same time. Thus
also it would be in the power of MR. LUMLEY, during the approaching
holiday time, to bring home the Opera to every lady's drawing-room in
London. Let him cause to be constructed, at the back of Her Majesty’s
Theatre, an apparatus on the principle of the Ear of DIONYSIUs, care
having been taken to render it a good ear for music. -
Next, having obtained an Act of Parliament for the purpose, let him lay
down, after the manner of pipes, a number of Telakouphana, connected
—the reader will excuse the apparent vulgarism-with this Ear, and
extended to the dwellings of alſ such as may be willing to pay for the
accommodation. In this way our domestic establishments might be
served with the liquid notes of JENNY LIND as easily as they are with
soft water, and could be supplied with music as readily as they can
with gas. Then, at a soirée or evening party, if a desire were expressed
for a little music, we should only have to turn on the Sonnambula or the
Puritani, as the case might be; an arrangement which would provide
us with a delightful substitute for a deal of execrable singing, besides
being in general highly conducive to the harmony of private families.
The Owl against the Railway.
The Kelso Mail says that the train on the Newcastle and Berwick
Railway was attacked, the other night, by a party of horned owls, one
of which severely pecked the fireman in the face, and displaced one of
his teeth. “Such an assault,” observes our contemporary, “at such a
lace, and during the dark, was rather alarming.” Yes, indeed. To a
liever in the transmigration of souls, an owl attacking a railway
would suggest a serious sº that something had happened to
the hon, and gallant Member for Lincoln.

WE ALL HAVE OUR HOBBIES.
If anybody were to set himself up for any-
thing, there would be sure to be somebody who
would think nobody could be fitter than this any-
body for the position he might aspire to. The
late election for the office of President in France,
proves our position at once; for WIDOCQ, who is
remarkable for his aptitude at catching, and
ABD-El-KADER, renowned for being caught, had
each an adherent, who wished to see his favourite
elected to the post now occupied by Louis
NAPOLEoN.
We should like to have seen the individual
who desired to see ABD-EL-KADER at the head
of the Republic, and the other individual who
was anxious to make WIDocQ the chief of the
Executive. These two objects of a literally sin-
gular, choice may congratulate themselves upon
enjoying the confidence of one Frenchman each,
as the celebrated HENRY HUNT fell in tears
upon the neck of JERoxie the sweep, for having
plumped alone, in the orator's favour, when he

A CASE FOR COUNSEL.
FIEFLEss has had the following case for
his opinion dropped into our letter-
box. The learned, gentleman is not
in the habit of . looking, at , papers
coming before him in this shape in
the light of anything better than
waste-papers; and he generally con-
verts them weekly into a small pat
of real Dorset, by a contract with
his buttelman. There was, however,
something so extremely inviting to
his ingenuity in the accompanying
case—something so tempting to his
legal acumen—that he could not
forbear from, writing upon it. The
following is the
CASE :-
If A, B, is swallowed by the Great
Sea Serpent, would A. B. become a tenant in tail after the possibility
of issue extinct” -
The following is the
OPINION:- • *,
The question submitted in the above case is rather mice, though the
position of A. B. is rather otherwise. Much depends upon the fact
whether A. B. is regularly in, or is merely in de son tort, or whether
he has suffered an entry in the usual manner. . It is true that if he is
tenant in tail and the tail remains by way of jointure, there will be so
far a joint tenancy., As, however, my opinion is required on the entire
case, I feel disposed to say conditionally, “No,” if the premises hold;
but if otherwise, positively “Yes.” J. BRIEFLEss.
THERE's no ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE.

THE MATRIMONIAL MARKET.
The House of Coburg held, last week, a meeting at Saxe-Weimar,
where the following resolutions were unaminously passed:-. .
“That the House of Coburg hails with the liveliest, satisfaction the
election of PRINCE Louis Buonaparte as President of France, inasmuch
as he is single : - -
“That it is highly probable the Prince will and must, at some future
period, marry:
“That it is a most important fact, that the Royal House of Coburg
has been in the habit, from time immemorial, of providing, at the shortest
notice, all the Courts of Europe with suitable spouses and brides-
; and queens—and that references of the said important fact can
easily be given: -
“That the Royal Hºuse of Coburg has not yet provided any Court
. a Presidentess, but it would feel the most ineffable pleasure in
S0 dolng: -
“That the earliest measures be taken to assure His REPUBLICAN
HIGHNEss PRINCE Louis NAPOLEQN of the above resolutions, and that
the utmost readiness be displayed by the House of Coburg in assisting
him in his matrimonial views.” -

The late constituents of MR. RoEBUCK are going to present him with
a large piece of broad-cloth as a token of respect. It seems rather
absurd to give him the Saxony after having given him the Sack.
MR. Roebuck did more honour to Bath, than Bath—remarkable for
its bricks, its buns, and its chaps—can ever do to him; and we regret
the degradation of the city in having turned out ROEBUCK, who, having
a due contempt for those who have turned their coats, will scarcely
thank them for their cloth.
