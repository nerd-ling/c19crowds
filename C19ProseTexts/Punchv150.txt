[JANUARY 5, 1916.
AN ILL-USED AUTHOR.
“I GATHER, Sir," remarked my fellow-traveller, after I
had put away the writing-block on which I had been
jotting down the outline of an article, “that you are a
literary man, like myself?”
We were the only occupants of a compartment in a
L. & N.W.R. carriage. I had been too absorbed till then
to notice his appearance, but I now observed that he had
rather unkempt hair, luminous eyes, and a soft hat. “Oh,
well,” I admitted, “I write.”
“But I take it that, whatever you write, it is not poetry,”
he said. What led him to this inference I cannot say, but
I had to confess that it was correct.
“Still, even though you are not a Poet yourself, I hope,”
he said, “you can feel some sympathy for one who has
been so infamously treated as I have.”
I replied that I hoped so too.
“Then, Sir,” said he, “I will tell you my unhappy story.
At the beginning of this War I was approached by certain
Railway magnates who shall be nameless. It appeared
that they had realised, very rightly, that their official
notices were couched in too cold and formal a style to
reach the heart of their public. So they commissioned me
to supply what I may term the human touch. As a poet,
I naturally felt that this could only be effectively done
through the medium of verse. Well, I rose to the occasion,
Sir ; I produced some lines which, printed as they were
written, must infallibly have placed me at the head of all
of my contemporaries. But they were not printed as they
were written. In proof of which I will trouble you to read
very carefully the opening paragraph of those ‘Defence of
the Realm Regulations' immediately above your head . . .
Only the opening paragraph at present, please!”
I was somewhat surprised, but, thinking it best to
humour him, I read the first sentence, which was: “In
view of possible attack by hostile aircraft, it is necessary
that the blinds of all trains should be kept down after
sunset,” and gave him my opinion of it.
“Whether,” he said, with some acerbity, “it is or is not
as lucidly expressed as you are pleased to consider, only the
beginning of it is mine. This is what I actually wrote:–
“‘In view of possible attack
By hostile aircraft overhead,
'Tis necessary now, alack
Soon as old Sol has sought his bed,
That those who next the window sit,
Though they'd prefer to watch the gloaming,
Should draw the blind, nor leave a slit,
Keeping it down until they're homing,
Else on the metals will be thrown
A glowing trail as from a comet,
And Huns to whom a train is shown
Will most indubitably bomb it !”
“That,” he observed complacently, “is not only verse of
the highest order, but clearly conveys the reason for such
precautions, which the official mind chose to cut out. And
now let me ask you to read the next paragraph.” I did so.
“At might-time when the blinds are drawn,” it ran, “pas-
sengers are requested before alighting to make sure when the
train stops that it is at the platform.”
“Which,” he cried fiercely, “is their mangled and muti-
lated version of this:—
“‘At night-time when the blinds are drawn
(As screens against those devils' spawn,
Which love the gloom, but dread the dawn),
A train may be at standstill,
Then we request 'twill not occur
That some impatient passenger,
Whose nerves are iſ a chronic stir,
And neither feet nor hands still,
Without preliminary peep
Will forth incontinently leap,
Alighting in a huddled heap
To lie, a limp or flat form,
In some inhospitable ditch,
If not on grittier ballast, which
(The darkness far surpassing pitch)
He took to be the platform ' '
“As to the next paragraph,” he continued, “I don't
complain so much, though, personally, I consider ‘Ertract
from Order made by the Secretary of State for the Home
Department ' a very poor paraphrase of the resounding
couplet in which I introduced him :-
“‘Now speaks in genial tones, from heart to heart meant,
The Secretary for the Home Department " '
“I could have overlooked that, Sir, if they had retained
the lines I had written for him. But they've only let him
speak the first four words—“Passengers in Railway Car-
riages'—and then drivel on thus: ' which are provided with
blinds must keep the blinds covered so as to cover the
windows"—a clumsy tautology, Sir, for which I am sure no
Home Secretary would care to be held responsible, and
from which I had been at some pains to save him, as you
may judge when I read you the original text:—
“‘Passengers in railway carriages
Possess a sense which none disparages;
So those who are not perverse or froward
May be trusted to see that the blinds are lowered,
To cover the windows so totally
That no one inside can be seen, or see.
Mem.—This need not be done, as lately decided,
If blinds for the windows have not been provided.”
“But,” he went on, “the deadliest injury those infernal
officials reserved for the last. If you read the concluding
sentence, Sir, you will observe that it begins: ‘The blinds
may be lifted in case of necessity ' ' (That, I need hardly
say, is entirely my own. There is a sort of inspired swing
in it, the true lyrical lilt with which even red-tape has not
dared to tamper! But mark how they go on): ' when the
train is at a standstill at a station, but, if lifted, they must
be lowered again before the train starts.' And this insuffer-
able bathos, forsooth, was substituted for lines like these:–
“‘The blinds may be lifted in case of necessity;
Thus, if the train at a station should halt,
And the traveller hears not its name, nor can guess it, he
Cannot be held to commit any fault,
Still farther be fined,
Should he pull up the blind
Out of mere curiosity ; had he not looked
He might miss the station for which he had booked ''
“Well,” he concluded, “that is my case. But I can
never put it before the public myself. My pride would not
permit me. Though, if someone—yourself, for instance–
would present my claims to redress * >
I couldn't help thinking that he had been hardly treated,
and so I undertook to do what I could for him. He gave
me his verses, also his name, which latter I have unfor-
tunately forgotten. However, I hope I have redeemed my
promise here in other respects.
There are times when I wonder uneasily whether he may
not have been pulling my leg. But, after all, he could have
had no possible object in doing that. Besides, if, the next
time you travel by the L. & N.-W., you will study the
printed instructions in your compartment, I fancy you will
agree with me that they corroborate his statements to a
rather remarkable extent. F. A.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
IT has come as an immense relief to
all true lovers of peace to learn that
such German soldiers as have been
taking part in the war on the Italian
frontier have previously resigned their
positions in the KAISER's army and
been re-enrolled under the Austrian
flag, so that no untoward incident
may disturb the profound peace which
exists between Germany and Italy.
All the same there are elements of
possible danger in the situation which
should be carefully watched. We look
forward to a time when our gallant
ally may be confidently expected to
advance on to German soil, and we
think it would be well for the author-
ities at Rome (unless the invading host
is provided with Montenegrin uniforms)
to serve out beforehand a large number
of tourist coupons, available over a
wide choice of different routes. This
might avert the terrible consequences
that are likely to follow a breach of
relations.
Of course it must be remembered
that Italy has now signed on not to
enter into a separate peace, and no
doubt the only true economy is to
make the present one go as far as
possible, as it cannot be replaced.
Still, since the sinking of the Ancona
by a German crew (partially white-
washed so as to look like Austrians),
Italy's neutrality has become of an
extremely virulent order.
We need hardly say that President
WILSON even on his honeymoon is
closely watching the situation and
thinking over it very deeply, very
slowly and very calmly, hoping to dis-
cover hints for his own future guidance.
It is said that he feels himself being
drawn more and more into the vortex,
and his attitude of passive belligerency
may be followed by one of aggressive
non-interference. It is common know-
ledge in Washington that if he can get
no satisfaction on the Ancoma question
he will either despatch a new note
(which will be almost an ultimatum)
or simply pass on and declare war on
Albania.
Portugal (as the ancient ally of
Great Britain), who has already been
involved in a scrap with German troops
in Angola, is naturally deeply exercised
as to what are her present relations
with Turkey. The matter is an urgent
one and might become crucial in the
event of a Turkish Zeppelin drifting in
a fog over Portuguese territory.
The King of GREECE is said to have
found a happy solution of his difficulty
about a Bulgarian invasion of Greece.
The incoming forces are to be provided

Juvenile War Lord. “’ERE! SoMEONE ELSE 'Ave A Go-I'M sick o' war. IT AIN'T IN REAsoN TER ExPECT A BLokE TER BE
THE KAISER THREE DAYS RUNNING ! ”
THE VINDICATION OF JIMMY.
IN one corner of the school play-
ground stood a small boy in deep
dejection, with his hands in his pockets,
his lower lip trembling slightly, whilst
he strove to kick a hole in the ground
with his right toe. It was Jimmy—
Jimmy in his hour of trial.
He wasn't going to blub, he wasn't
going to do anything.
Suddenly he stopped kicking at the
ground, as he remembered that his
mother had told him he must be
careful of his boots now that the War
was on.
He took out of his pocket a match-
box, the temporary home of a large
beetle—a buzzer, Jimmy called it—
which had hitherto refused to eat
either grass or bran or Indian corn.
His gaze then wandered to a hole in
his stockings, which he had mended
by applying ink to the exposed part
of his skin.
From the opposite side of the play-
ground came the tumultuous noise of
the calm deliberations of Form II.
Jimmy knew perfectly well that
they were discussing him, and that in
time one of their number would be
sent to inform him of the verdict and
sentence.
He expected that he would have to
fight them all, one by one, and he
wondered how many blows he would
be able to stand without returning
them, for to hit back was out of the
question under the unfortunate circum-
stances.
Jimmy wished they would get it
over, for he was quite willing to under-
go any form of punishment they might
decide upon, if only they would let him
know quickly. He hoped they wouldn't
make the Biffer fight him, not that
he was afraid of the Biffer, but because
it would be so hard to keep himself
from hitting back, and that he had
decided not to do. You see the Biffer
was a new boy, and, for another thing,
he wore a leather strap round his
wrist. On his very first day at school
the Biffer had volunteered the infor-
mation that he once gave a boy such a
biff on the nose that he had sprained
his wrist, and that ever since he had
worn a wrist strap, lest it should happen
again. It was Jimmy who had nick-
named him the Biffer, and from that
time the Biffer had sought Jimmy's
blood.
But Jimmy was not easy to quarrel
with.
He was the acknowledged champion
of Form II., and you had to commit
three offences before Jimmy would
seriously consider you. At the first
offence you got a note with the one
word “Beware!" written upon it; at
the second, another note with the word
“Blood" written underneath a skull
and crossbones; and at the third you
received a note with the word “Deth,”
and underneath was the drawing of a
coffin.
The Biffer had so far arrived at the
second note.
Jimmy did hope they wouldn't choose
the Biffer, for he could hear even now
the Biffer's yell when he had made that
awful mistake which had brought
about the present deplorable situation.
Jimmy couldn't think how he had
come to say what he did say; he could
have bitten off his tongue when he
realised it; but it was too late—he had
said it.
He tried to think how it had all
occurred, and the scene flashed again
before his mind. There was the master
with his pointer resting upon the
Dogger Bank on the map of Europe.
“Who can tell me the name of this
sea 2 " he had said, and Jimmy had
snapped his fingers and waved his
arm about in his anxiety to catch the
master's eye. You see, it was so
seldom, so very seldom, that Jimmy
felt he knew the right answer to any
question, and the new experience was
intoxicating. The master too seemed
to find it unusual, and he at once
turned to Jimmy and said, “Well, what
is this sea called, then 2" Jimmy, full

of the pride of knowledge, burst out
with “The North Sea, Sir.” Oh! if he
had only stopped at that; but in his
desire to show how much he knew he
added without thinking the fatal words,
“or German Ocean l''
In the shout of derision which had
followed, Jimmy realised what he had
said, and felt himself falling, falling,
falling . . .
Jimmy became aware that the noise
on the opposite side of the playground
was ceasing, and soon, from the corner
of his eye, he saw Jones minimus de-
tach himself from the crowd. “Half a
mo',” he heard Jones minimus say;
“I want to get a knotted handkerchief,”
and he saw him hurry into the school.
As he emerged he flourished the knotted
handkerchief, but when delivering the
verdict to Jimmy that he would have
to run the gauntlet three times to the
tune of the knotted handkerchiefs of
Form II., he tried to smuggle into
Jimmy's hands an exercise-book which
he said Jimmy could stuff up his back;
it would stick there if Jimmy buttoned
his jacket, he said, and it would take
the sting off a bit. Jimmy had to bite
his lip as he refused the exercise-book,
and then with head erect and lips no
longer trembling he went forth to face
the ordeal.
Form II. had arranged themselves
in two ranks, facing one another, and
the knots in the handkerchiefs were
firm and hard. “You have got to
bunk through and back again and
then down again,” said Jones minimus
in a hoarse whisper. -
The Biffer was at the head of one
rank, and had got his handkerchief
slung over his shoulder in happy readi-
ness for the first blow.
“Are you ready ? Go!”
Form II. in one voice.
At the word “Go!" Jimmy pulled
his hands out of his pockets—he was
glad his mother wasn't there to see
him—and with head still up and eyes
to the front he walked slowly up the
double lines and as slowly down them.
The Biffer got in a good one, he got in
two before Jimmy was out of reach,
and he then changed the handkerchief
to his left hand in readiness for the
return journey. Arrived at the end of
the lines, Jimmy turned on his heel
and began to walk even more slowly
than at first. -
But there was no sting in the blows
this time; all the zest seemed to have
gone out of the affair; and, but for the
whack the Biffer gave, Jimmy never
felt anything. The third time down
was a farce, for, after Jimmy had delib-
erately stopped opposite the Biffer in
order to let him have as many as his
injured soul required, no one touched
shouted
him. In fact they were all shaking
hands with Jimmy, who was now his
smiling self once more and ready to
play with the best of them, when sud-
denly the Biffer took it into his head
to make a joke.
“Perhaps he is a German,” said the
Biffer, and waited for the general
laugh to follow his sally.
But the laugh didn't come; instead
there was a dead silence. -
Who was the Biffer—a new boy at
that—to call anyone a German 2 In-
stinctively a ring was formed and the
Biffer found himself in the middle of it.
Jimmy took off his coat and gave it
to Jones minimus, who danced for sheer
delight.
Jimmy had only one regret: the
butcher-boy was not there to see him—
the butcher-boy who had expended so
much time over him, had taught him
the upper cut, the under cut, every cut
that the heart of a butcher-boy delights
in. The Biffer was very busy biffing the
air with a rapid circular motion of the
arms, for Jimmy's fixed scowl and set ||
of jaw troubled him.
Oh, why wasn't the butcher-boy there
to see that tremendous smack on the
nose the Biffer got? He would have
felt amply rewarded.
No one had ever seen Jimmy fight
like this, and Jones minimus shouted
in his joy, for the Biffer was outbiffed
in every direction.
In vain did he cry “Par,” for Jimmy
had not half relieved his feelings, and
there was no end to the dodges the
butcher-boy had taught him, each of
which, he had said, meant sudden death.
“He’s had enough, Jimmy,” whis-
pered Jones minimus. “I’m satisfied,”
he added as the Biffer, who was lying
on the ground, refused to get up and
have any more.
As the boys entered the class-room
the next day there was the map of
Europe still hanging up in front of the
class, and the very first question that
was asked by the master was, “Well,
Jimmy, what is this sea?”
“The North Sea or British Ocean,
Sir!” said Jimmy, a reply that was
greeted with a rousing cheer by the
whole of Form II.

A TURKISH TROPHY.
(A belated letter from Gallipoli.)
MY DEAR ,-By this week's post
I trust you will receive the long pro-
mised trophy, to wit one Turkish
headpiece procured by my own per-
sonal exertions. As the story of its
capture, though somewhat out of the
ordinary, has been passed over in stony
silence both by the official communiqués
and “Our Special Correspondent” I shall
endeavour to give you a brief impres-
sion of the difficulties overcome as truth-
fully as my sense of imagination will
allow me. First of all I must draw a
map :-
Cl
15
A B British trench, with traverses.
C D Turkish trench, without.
E F Ditch
G. British barricade.
H Turkish barricade.
This should give you an idea of the
English and Turkish lines at a point
where they are about eighty yards
apart. Without going into details you
will see the English trench is of the
superior pattern, as it has traverses.
I had to work in that technical term to
show I know all about it; I know
another, “the berm,” but I am not too
sure about what that is, and also I
don't suppose I could draw a “berm” if
I saw one. Anyway, I know it's quite
a good term connected with trenches,
as I heard a G.O.C. fairly strafe a
subaltern, the other day, because he
hadn't got a “berm.” Well, to refer
to the map, you will observe that there
is an old ditch running between the
two lines of trenches, and both sides
have advanced a certain distance along
this ditch and have built barricades
about ten yards apart. Every day it
is part of my job to take a constitu-
tional along our trenches, and after
discussing the European situation and
the latest Budget with the various
battalion commanders to ask them
whether there is any particularly ob-
noxious part of the opposition line they
would like me to salute with my bat-
tery. Usually they say, “No, there's
nothing in particular, but let's have a
shoot all the same; for example, there's

a dog that barks abominably every
night opposite L 57. Couldn't you
abolish him 2" Incidentally we no
longer give our trenches names, such
as Piccadilly, Rotten Row, but mere
letters and numbers; the reason being
that one of the staff was picked up in
a fainting condition, having strolled
down Park Lane and then found him-
self, to his horror, in Peckham High
Street. The shock—his own home
being in Ealing Broadway—had proved
too much for his constitution. How-
ever, to refer back to the map once
more, our barricade across the ditch
is a most convenient spot for observing
artillery fire and as such is frequently
used by me. Unfortunately my view
was always hasty and badly interrupted
by the attentions of a Turkish sniper
behind their barricade. This man's
name was Ibrahim, and he was a
Constantinople cab - driver, married,
with two children, both boys. You
may be surprised that we know so
much about the enemy, but we live in
such close proximity that opposite the
Lancashire Fusiliers a Turk named
Mahomet, who lives at No. 3, Golden
Horn Terrace, told the reporter of The
Worpington Headlight that for three
years he had been suffering from pains
in the back—but that's another story.
Incidentally Mahomet at present in-
habits a sniper's post surrounded by a
perfect thicket of barbed-wire, and I
had a bright scheme for its removal. I
got hold of a trench catapult, an in-
genious contrivance of elastic that
hurls a bomb some hundreds of yards,
and placed in it a harpoon attached to
a long coil of rope. The idea was that
on release of the catapult the harpoon
would be hurled in the air, the rope
would neatly pay out, and then, as soon
as the harpoon had grappled Mahomet,
all we would have to do would be to
haul on the rope and over would come
the whole bag of tricks. Unfortunately
something went wrong, and the rope,
instead of neatly uncoiling, flailed round
the trench like a young anaconda, and,
catching a harmless spectator by the
leg, hurled him twenty feet in the air.
Immediately the opposition lines re-
sounded like a rifle-booth at a country
fair. However our spectator descended
unpunctured, and the only damage done
was to our vanity, when Mahomet
threw over a message attached to a
stone to ask whether we would repeat
the performance as he and a pal had
a bet on as to who was the best
shot and wanted a human aeroplane
to judge. -
But we have got a long way from

The saddest part of the tale is yet to

Mr. Punch ventures to plead on be-

were interned in Holland (for want of
official information most people imagine
that all the missing were so interned),
they lack the necessities of life. Parcels
of food are sent to them, fortnightly
to each man, as well as clothing and
tobacco; and it is known that they
receive all that is sent. Mr. Punch
begs his readers to help the fund from

THE scene was the comfortable spa-

Palace. His lordship sat nearest to
the fire; the bishop's wife presided
over the fragrant coffee-pot, and the
curate, their dine-and-sleep guest, sat
opposite the bishop and farthest from
the warmth. As a curate this position
was his due. Some day he also would
be a bishop, and then he too would
know what it was to intercept the
glow.
The curate was looking dubiously
into the recesses of an egg. His fine
Anglican features underwent a series
of contortions.
“I am afraid,” said the bishop, “that
that egg is not a good one.”
“You are right, my lord,” said the
curate. “It is not only bad, it's alive.

The shadows were lengthening in
the beautiful garden. It was a warm
spring evening. The old sun-dial had
just struck seven.
The poet threw aside his book and
called his Airedale terrier; the dog, re-
sponding in time, eventually reached
his master's knee.
Seizing his opportunity, the repre-

The eminent publicist replaced his

mustard. I have made a vast fortune
out of it.”
“How very interesting,” the lady
replied absently; but the next moment,
inspired by a hidden thought, she added
with quickened interest, “Please don't
think me inquisitive, but how can a
fortune be made out of a thing like
mustard 2 People take so little of it.”
“Madam,” answered the mustard
magnate deliberately, “we do not
make our fortunes from the mustard

“Yes, yes?” cried the lady eagerly.

“So I am,” said the money-lender,

[JANUARy 5, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“PUSS IN BOOTs.”
IF Messrs. SIMs, DIx and Collins
did in fact, as they claim, make the
book of this year's pantomime at the
Lane, Mr. GEORGE GRAVES gagged and
bound it. This popular annual festival
indeed tends to become more and more
of a GRAVEs solo (with of course the
innumerable customary da capos) and
a bright sketchy Evans obbligato. As
a Grand Duchess and Duke respectively
the genial twain present themselves.
Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs, in a flounced skirt
of green tartan check, copper curls
and mahogany features, is a delectable
creation; says some strangely unlady-
like things (as is expected of him);
is still oddly preoccupied with “gear-
boxes” and other anatomical detail; and
generally indulges in a fine careless
rapture of reminiscence and improvisa-
tion—zealously assisted by Mr. WILL
Evans' familiar tip-tilted nose and
bland refusal to be perturbed by en-
tirely unrehearsed effects and obviously
irregular cues. A jovial and irreverent
pair of potentates, crowned by public
laughter.
There is, of course, a sort of back-
ground to all this audacious fooling,
more definitely directed virginibus
puerisque. The new principal boy,
Mr. ERIC MARSHALL, woos his princess
with a romantic air and a mellow
tenor, in which emotion somewhat
overshadows tone. Miss FLORENCE
SMITHSON, an accepted Drury Lane
favourite, looks very charming, makes
love in pretty kitten wise and still
indulges in those queer harmonics of
hers—virtuosity rather than artistry,
shall we call it?—but is altogether quite
a nice princess of pantomime. Little
RENEE MAYER is the Puss. Nothing
could well be daintier. But I hope
she will let me tell her (in a whisper,
so that the others won't hear), that she
doesn't quite realise what a jolly part
she has got. I would implore her to
spend an hour or two at serious play
with any decent young cat and study
the grace and variety of its beautiful,
imitable gestures. Then she will as-
suredly pounce on her magician turned
mouse, and fawn on her master and
friends, with a greater air of conviction.
And she will mightily please all the
other nice children in the house.
Of the great ensemble scenes un-
questionably the finest was the Fairy
Garden, with a quite beautiful back-
cloth by R. McCLEERY and a bewildering
(and, to tell truth, largely bewildered)
bevy of butterflies, decked by CoMELLI,
fluttering in a flowery pleasaunce. And
there was also a clever variation on
the now inevitable staircase motif as
a finale. But the Harlequinade of
happy memory has deplorably declined
to something like a mere display of
advertisements—a sad business.
“THE STARLIGHT ExPREss.”
It would be uncandid to pretend
that Mr. ALGERNoN BLAckwood gets
everything he has to say in The
Starlight Erpress safely across the
footlights—those fateful barriers that
trap so many excellent intentions. But
he so evidently has something to say,
and the saying is so gallantly attempted,
that he must emphatically be credited
with something done — something
rather well done really. The little
play has beautiful moments—and that
is to say a great deal.
This novelist turned playwright
wishes to make you see that “the
Princess Rosabel . Miss FLORENCE SMITHSON.
Florian . . Mr. ERIC MARSHALL.
Princess Rosabel and Florian, a young man
—though only a miller's son—of considerable
polish, especially about the hair and feet.
Earth's forgotten it's a Star.” In
plainer words he wants to present you
with a cure for “wumbledness.” People
who look at the black side of things,
who think chiefly of themselves—these
are the wumbled. The cure is star-
dust—which is sympathy. The treat-
ment was discovered by the children
of a poor author in a cheap Swiss pen-
sion and by “Cousinenry,” a successful
business man of a quite unusual sort.
You have to get out into the cave
where the starlight is stored, gather it
—with the help of the Organ Grinder,
who loves all children and sings his
cheery way to the stars; and the
Gardener, who makes good things grow
and plucks up all weeds; and the
Lamplighter, who lights up heads and
hearts and stars impartially; and the
Sweep, who sweeps away all blacks
and blues over the edge of the world,
and the Dustman, with his sack of
Dream-dust that is Star-dust (or isn't
it?), and so forth. Then you sprinkle
the precious stuff on people, and they
become miracles of content and unself-
ishness. (The fact that life isn't in
the very least like that is a thing you
have just got to make yourself forget
for three hours or so.)
The author was well served by his
associates. Sir Edward ELGAR wove
a delightfully patterned music of
mysterious import through the queer
tangle of the scenes and gave us
an atmosphere loaded with the finest
star-dust. Lighting and setting
were admirably contrived; and the
grouping of the little prologue scenes,
where that kindly handsome giant of
an organ-grinder (Mr. CHARLEs MoTT),
with the superbly cut corduroys, sang
so tunefully to as sweet a flock of little
maids as one could wish to see, was
particularly effective.
Of the players I would especially
commend the delicately sensitive per-
formance of Miss MERCIA CAMERON (a
name and talent quite new to me) as
Jane Anne, the chief opponent of wum-
bledom. She was, I think, responsible

“Well, what does it mean 2''
“It means,” I said, “that if your money is invested in

“Francesca,” I said, “your knowledge is very wonderful.
But if you suppose that that is the whole dividend, you are
much mistaken. It is the dividend minus the tax. The
company saves you trouble by deducting the tax and pays
it to the CHANCELLOR for you.”
“Bravo the company'.” said Francesca.
“And so say I. You see you never get that part of your

don't spend it.” -
“That,” she said, “sounds highly plausible.”
“Yes, but listen. Suppose you've got some little job at,
say, two hundred and fifty pounds a year—t
“Like the little job you were so pleased to get a few

“Yes,” I said, “more or less like that.”
“Not so honourable, of course,” said Francesca.
“No, of course not, but similar as to emoluments. Well,
in that case you get the whole amount, and you spend it in
perfectly useless things and forget all about it after you've
put it down in your return ; and then suddenly some
Surveyor of Taxes writes and demands Income Tax on
those two hundred and fifty pounds, actually demands
something like forty pounds. I tell you, it goes through
you like a knife.”
“Haven't you any remedy ?
“Of course I could chuck the job,” I said, “ or do it for
nothing. Yes, I think I'll chuck it. It'll be a lesson
to them.”
“Yes,” she said, “it would probably make the Govern-

“Go on,” I said, for she was hesitating. “Let us strip

Outraged victim of “Confidential Report” (being put to bed prematurely). “PLEASE, GoD, NURSE seized For HER soldier on

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If it should ever be your lot, which pray Heaven forbid,
to be stranded on the coast of Panama, seek out Miss
WINIFRED JAMEs as your hostess, for she can teach you
how to tolerate, and even in a way enjoy, an existence one
might have thought unendurable. She lives, I gather,
some two hundred miles or so from the Canal, in a town
that is going to be built some fine day on a site that has
to be prepared by filling up a marsh with clay and sand.
In the meantime, until the day and the town arrive, she
rightly describes herself as A Woman in the Wilderness
(CHAPMAN AND HALL). Civilisation is turned back to front
out there, for although such comforts as refrigerators and
electric light are a matter of course, there is still lacking
to Mrs. Henry de Jan and her rather shadowy William
anything, for instance, in the nature of a road on which to
walk, or indeed any approach to their own verandah except,
floating on the clay, a narrow plank gangway that has to
serve as a hustling high-road for a mixed and dusky
populace. Under the circumstances she has done nobly
well to arm herself with the twin defences of cheerfulness
and humour; and if the cheerfulness comes at times near
to being that of a martyr on the rack, while the fun is
perilously apt to swing from themes that are nice for a
lady's wit to others that are not so nice, and back to sheer
triviality, what, in the name of a population of sand-flies
and negroes, can you expect 2 It is much that so lifelike
a picture of a region so desolate should be presented on
the whole with sweetness and charm, when no better
material is available than the myriad misdeeds of her
coloured servants, the antics of her puppies and an occasional
reminiscence of home.
Certainly Violet HUNT and Ford MADox HUEFFER have
one achievement to their credit. They have evolved an
entirely new and original setting in which to bring together
a number of short stories. What is supposed to happen is
that sundry persons who did not feel exactly drawn towards
bed before 2 A.M. on those summer nights when Zeppelins
were about, meet for bridge and sandwiches and incident-
ally to listen to certain stories read aloud by their author.
In this way they are able to forget their apprehensions of
the gas-bags (dare I put it that they lose Count 2) and spend
a pleasant series of evenings with history. For the stories
in Zeppelin Nights (LANE) are all historical of a kind.
Mostly they deal with the byways of history, or rather with
the emotions of ordinary people who are just on the outer
edge of historical happenings. For example, the central
figure of the first is a slave whose basket of figs is upset by
PHEIDIPPIDEs running from Marathon; while the last con-

cerns an insignificant little anti-militarist who finds himself
cheering for the army on the outbreak of the Boer War.
That is the kind of tales they are, slight and momentary
things, with no plot but plenty of atmosphere, and in
their style remarkably well done. Whether they would
actually keep the nerve-ridden oblivious of bombs for the
thousand-and-one nights that might have seen raids and
didn't is a matter that need not concern us. For my part,
I liked as much as any the pages in which Miss HUNT or
Mr. HUEFFER folded up her or his manuscript and allowed
the other (whichever it was) to tell us about the very
pleasant and human audience. I had only one disappoint-
ment, but that was acute. I did want just once for them
to hear a distant bang, and see what happened. I rather
doubt whether the placid and literary charm of the tales
would have sufficed to keep them within doors had there
been anything to see outside.

keen sense of the beauty of nature and the beauty of
words. Children should love these Himalayan sketches,
for Mr. RUNDALL, from material which in some cases was
admittedly slight, could weave a tale full of magic and
charm. The story of the old brown bear in “The Scape-
goat" may not greatly stir the heart with the thrill of
adventure, but the hero has attractions that no child and
no man that has not forgotten his childhood could resist.
An inconspicuous notice in the book tells us that the
author fell in action towards the close of 1914. I salute
his memory. Rich as we are to-day in authors who can
write enchantingly of birds and animals, I feel a sense of
personal sorrow in the loss of one whose work gave so fair
a promise of high achievement.

and genial superstition.
You will be led from one
to the other, puzzled but,
I dare conjecture, highly

may take it, too, that a
certain healthy sort of
children will like to have
these queer stories read
aloud. The villainies of
the Bába Yagá, an old
witch of terrific resource-
fulness, and the oddly in-
consequent animal stories
should make particular ap-
peal. But you will be hard
put to it to answer the
way in which the story developed. And yet I think I could
have forgiven the absence of lurid sensationalism if the
book had been a good book of its kind. It is not. It is so
crude and amateurish that it is difficult to believe that a
professional writer could have written it. Mr. JEPsoN, like
most other authors, has had the idea of modernising the
story of the Prodigal Son. He adheres to the original story
closely in one respect, for Roland Penny's first meal in his
old home consists of roast veal, but he departs from it in
making Roland, so far from wasting his substance, amass
a large fortune among the husks and swine. I do not
know how to classify The Man Who Came Back. It is not
a novel of incident, for nothing happens in it. It is not a
novel of character, for there is no attempt at any but the
crudest character-drawing. It is just a six-shilling novel,
and I do not see what else one can say of it. Mr. JEPSON
must do one of two things. He must either brace up and
make his style less irritatingly slipshod, or he must give us
a few more murders. If we cannot have literary elegance
he must give us blood.

WHAT IT HAs DoNE IN 1915.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. ARCHIBAL.D HURD in “The
Daily Telegraph.”)
SUPERIORITY, and again Superiority In this one word
lies the secret of our success at sea. Yet it would be hard
to say how many careless civilians there are, taking all
things for granted, who fail to recognise that fact even
now. Not numbers nor organisation, nor men nor guns
nor ships—though these have counted for something—
have been responsible for our victory. It has been due
above all to superiority—sheer superiority.
Think what would have happened if there had been any
strategic fumbling at the opening of the War! It is not
pleasant to reflect upon what might have occurred (had
not superiority stepped in) at the very outset if, for in-
stance, we had sent several Dreadnoughts to catch the
Emden. It was strongly suspected, mind you, that there
were German armed vessels on the trade routes. As one
merchantman after another was sunk there could no longer
be any doubt about it. What if, in panic, we had suddenly
dispersed our naval force to every part of the globe 2
What then 2 But we didn't. What again if it had been
determined, in accordance with some fanciful scheme, to
concentrate our main striking force in the Mersey 2
Germany well might have captured the initiative. But
authority was not distracted from its primary purpose.
Was its policy a success? Come, now, was it?
The old year has gone. On January 4th the British
Fleet had been at war seventeen months—roughly seventy-
four weeks (anyone can count them up; there is nothing
abstruse about my statistics). In a word, it might almost
be said, with some approach to accuracy, that it has been in
the throes of the struggle for a year and a half. Very well.
The German Flag has been banished from the ocean.
Not since the War began has a German battleship steamed
down the Channel—nor a battle cruiser, nor yet an
armoured cruiser, nor even a light cruiser, nor a monitor,
nor a destroyer. None of them—not one. Why is that ?
Because (vide supra) the German Fleet has been banished
from the ocean. It still exists, but it is safely locked up
behind explosive agents (mines) and protected by submer-
sive factors (submarines). The German Fleet is in a zareba.
Let us recall the striking words of one of Germany's
leading naval strategists, written, mark you, before the
War: “England's strength is mainly in her Fleet.” I
wonder now if that is generally known.
He goes on to define the duties of a fleet in the following
words:—
(1) To avert invasion. -
(2) To keep the sea open for the arrival of imports;
(3) And the departure of exports;
(4) And for the exit of re-exports;
(5) Also the entrance of re-imports.
(6) To protect trade.
Has the British Fleet succeeded ?
The German Flag is banished from the seas. In Janu-
ary 1916 the German Fleet is still lurking in that zereba.
The Dreadnought embodied an offensive in excelsis, even
as the expansion of the Dreadnought policy embodies an
offensive in extenso and imposes upon the enemy a defensive
in extremis. - - -
It is perhaps hardly realised that the performance of the
British Navy in this War has no parallel in history. In
the past, enemy frigates always succeeded in getting out
of ports, however close the blockade. But none has broken
through this time—not a single frigate. On the other
hand enemy submarines may be said to have been more
formidable than in the Napoleonic wars.
But the German Fleet is strong. I am not one of the
sort of humourists who hold it up to contempt in its in-
activity. For that matter I am not any sort of humourist.
Perhaps you have found that out. But the German High
Seas Fleet is no fit subject for joke. That it has proved
harmless is due to one thing alone—superiority.
And so the War wags. All over the high seas our
merchantmen continue to inscribe their indelible furrows.
And where is the German Fleet? I think I have answered
that. .
Here then I conclude my synopsis of the work of the
Fleet in 1915. And if it be said that it might well have
stood almost word for word as the record of the work of the
Fleet in 1914, I may reply that I sometimes wistfully
wonder if I shall have to make any alterations in the text
before it goes to press again this time next year. BIs.

these days, for the process of corrugat-
ing the brow and groaning at the War
news must of necessity entail much
energy. For some time past it has
been patent to sympathetic observers
that what the pessimist to-day really
needs is a machine to do the work for
him.
To meet this want the Electrophobia
Syndicate have invented the Pessi-
phone — a mixture of gramophone
and pessimist—believing that he who
to-day can make two whimpers grow
where one grew before deserves well of
his country in war time. With the Pessi-
phone there is now absolutely no excuse
for cheerfulness. It is the marvel of
the age, and has very fittingly been
described as worth a guinea a groan.
With one pint of petrol the Pessi-
phone will disseminate more depression
throughout the household in ten
minutes than could be accomplished
in a day by thirty human pessimists.
As soon as people commence to be
cheerful all you have to do is to press
the button and hold on to something.
A child can start it but nobody can
stop it. Ten minutes is all that is

| GEORGE GRAVEs have already offered a
heavy reward for the body dead or alive
of the inventor—a fact which speaks
highly for the machine and its maker.
When the instrument was first tried
on a select party of confirmed opti-
mists two of them rushed out of the
office and have not been heard of since,
while the others clawed savagely at
the office mat.
No burglar will go near it. It will
drive away rate-collectors and poor
relations. One client has already used
it on his mother-in-law with favourable
results.
The Pessiphone is fitted with a little
oil-bath, all black fittings, self-start-
|ing lever, Stormy Arthur two-speed
gear, thus rendering it easy of change
from “Mildly Miserable” to “Devas-
tating," and the whole is packed com-
plete with accessories and delivered
carriage free to your back garden,
where it may be let loose.
The following letters from grateful
pessimists — all involuntary contri-
butions—speak for themselves:--

RULES FOR HERO-NA|LERS.
THE following notice appears daily

The statue to which it refers, known
as “The Trusty Look-Out,” represents
a seaman in oilskins looking out over
the North Sea. The face is that of

THE TRUSTY LOOK-OUT.
Nails may be driven into the statue on
week-days between 11 and 1, and on Sundays
between 10 and 5. The sale of tickets for
Nails and Shields takes place at the Treasury
of the Town Hall during office hours, and
also at the time for driving in Nails on
the spot.
Further, tickets for iron Nails may be
bought in the following shops: (here follows
a list of three booksellers, one general store and

(4) If any person offers resistance
to this procedure he or she will be
nailed to the statue by the Municipal
mail-driver as a warning to others.
A large iron nail will be used for this
purpose, the charge for which will
be added to the death-duties.
(5) It is unpatriotic and un-Ger-
man to use bad language when driv-
ing in nails. However, in view of
the well-known tenderness of the
human heart and the high state of
nervous tension in which many per-
sons of an ardent patriotic disposi-
tion may be expected to perform this
supreme act of symbolic devotion,
those who drive in iron nails will be
0.50 m. for an iron Nail. --
5.00 m. for a silver Nail.
10.00 m. for a small gold Nail.
20.00 m. for a larger gold Nail.
Anyone who buys 100, 200, 300
or 400 marks, worth of iron Nails
receives a silver Shield with a cor-
responding inscription ; similarly,

For the purpose of preparing

If clubs, societies, or other col-
lections of people wish to drive in
their Nails in private parties they
are requested to get into touch

Not in a spirit of carping criticism,
but as earnest admirers of German
forethought and thoroughness (Grind-
lichkeit), we feel it our duty to point
out that there are a few contingencies
for which these otherwise admirable
regulations fail to provide, and we beg
leave to suggest to the Municipal
Council of Wilhelmshaven the follow-
ing additions:—
(1) It is unpatriotic and un-Ger-
man to spend more time than neces-
sary in driving in nails, as standing-
room, the number of hammers and
the patience of the officials are all
limited.
(2) The limit of time allowed for
driving in one nail is one minute, for
a silver nail two minutes, for a small
gold mail two and a-half minutes and
for a large gold nail three minutes.
(3) If in any case the time-limit
is exceeded the Municipal nail-driver
will displace the person whose lack

“STORM or no storm,” said Charles,
“as a medical man I can't stick this
fug any longer.”
He disappeared behind the heavy
anti-Zepp curtains and opened the win-
dow. A piercing draught caught the
back of Bill's neck and he sat up.
“Look here,” he said crossly, “this
is no night for a poor Special to go out
in. Can't I send a medical certificate
instead 2"
“You cannot,” replied Charles. “I
will not be a party to such evasions.”
“It's pouring with rain and blowing
a gale. No Zepp ever hatched would
come over to-night.”
“That's not the point, Bill.” Kit
unexpectedly opened one eye. “How
are Charles and I to sleep soundly in
Tour warm beds unless we
know you're outside, guarding
us?”
“That's right,” growled Bill.
“Rub it in. Your turn to-mor-
row, anyway.”
The other two sang the
praises of bed in fervent anti-
strophe till at last Bill rose with
a groan and assumed his over-
coat, badge and truncheon. He
stopped at the door.
“Charles,” said he, “if after

sweetly. “Run away and

limit of bad language will be dealt
with by the Municipal nail-driver as
in (4).
(7) Classes of instruction in nail-
driving will be held in the Town-hall
daily between 10 and 11 A.M. (Sun-
days excepted).
(8) Persons who wish to be photo-
graphed in the act of nail-driving
must give notice to the Municipal
photographer two days in advance.
The cost of the photograph will nat-
urally be in inverse proportion to the
value of the nail which is driven in.

He disappeared to bed.
An hour later he was awakened by a
tremendous knocking at the front-door.
Resolutely turning on to his other side,
he tried to ignore it, but the fusillade
continued and swelled. Only when it
appeared likely to do permanent and
irreparable damage to the building did
he rush out on to the landing. There
he met Kit, half awake, with his eye-
lids tightly gummed together.
“That ass Bill,” he said peevishly.
“Forgotten his latchkey most likely.
Serve him right if we left him there!”
“My good man, one must sleep."
Charles ran downstairs, opened the
door and indignantly confronted the
glistening figure on the steps.
“It is my duty to warn you, Sir,"
said William's voice in an official but
triumphant tone, “that one of your
downstairs windows has been left open.

quickly, “that I am authorised to use

UNRuLY BRITANNIA.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I see that Canon
MASTERMAN, in his Presidential Address
to the Members of the Teachers' Guild
of Great Britain and Ireland, delivered
yesterday week, observed that the Ger-
man teacher had been the servant of
the State; his function had been to
foster love for the Fatherland. But,
he continued, “that love was degraded
by jealousy, distrust and arrogance.
The spirit that breathed through our
"Rule, Britannia!" was corrected in our
national life by our sense of humour
and self-criticism.” How true and how
necessary! It is indeed surprising to
me that no one has said it before. Why
should we dwell on the greatness of
our sea-power and proclaim our resolve
not to be slaves? I have always under-
stood, in spite of the view of Sir HENRY
NEwBolt, that DRAKE was nothing more
than a buccaneer. The public utterance
of such sentiments is surely prejudicial
to “moral uplift,” and, in the memor-
able words of Mr. Pecksniff, is “Pagan,
I regret to say.”
It seems to me that the time has now
come when, in the interests of reticence
and humanity, a serious attempt should
be made to revise our so-called patri-
otic songs, and, though fully conscious
of my own literary shortcomings, I
cannot refrain from suggesting, by the
following examples, the lines on which
such revision might be profitably car-
ried out. For instance, the refrain of
“Rule, Britannia!” would be shorn of
its thrasonical quality and rendered
suitable for use in elementary schools
if it took the following form:—
“Curb, Britannia, Britannia curb thy pride;
True Britons never, never, never PUT on
SIDE.”
Another song which clamours for
drastic revision is “The British Grena-
diers.” I cannot help thinking that it
would be greatly improved if it were
remodelled thus:—
“Some talk of ALEXANDER, and some of
HERCULEs,
Of HEctoR and LYsANDER, and warriors such
as these;
But infinitely greater than the stroke of any
sword
Is the pow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow of
WILSON and of Ford.”
There are many other standard songs
and poems which could be dealt with
in similar salutary fashion, but I am
content to leave the task to others, and
will content myself with the following
original lines, which, whatever may
be said of their form, have, at any rate,
the root of the matter in them :—
“The men who made our Empire great
Have long ago received their meed ;
Then why the tale reiterate?
Self-criticism now we need.

[JANUARY 12, 1916.
JOURNALISTIC ENTERPRISE.
ONCE upon a time a rash man, wish-
ing who knows for what?—possibly
a peerage, possibly to be relieved of
superfluous cash and so no longer have
to pay super-tax, possibly for the mere
joy of pulling wires—decided to start a
newspaper. -
After much consultation the plans
were complete in every particular save
one. The premises were taken, the
staff appointed, the paper, ink and so |
forth contracted for, the office girls and
lift girls were engaged, the usual gifted
and briefless barrister was installed
as editor, and the necessary Cabinet
Minister willing to reveal secrets was
obtained. Everything, in short, that a
successful newspaper at the present
time could possibly require was ready,
when it was suddenly remembered that
no provision had been made for a daily
supply of pictures. A popular paper
without pictures being such a crazy
anomaly, a pictorial editor was instantly
advertised for.
“Well,” said the editor to the appli-
cant for the post, “give me an idea of
your originality and resource in the
choice of topical photographs.”
“I think you can rely on me to be
original,” said the young man, “and
not only original but revolutionary. I
have thought about it all a lot, and I
have made some discoveries. My
notion is that the public wants to be
‘in' all that is happening. Nothing's
beneath their notice; their eyes want
food to feast on all the time.”
“Go on,” said the editor ;
interest me strangely.”
“The function of the camera, as I
conceive it,” the young man explained,
“is to serve as the handmaid of the
fountain-pen. Together they are terri-
fic—a combination beyond resistance.
That perhaps is the chief of the in-
spirations which much pondering
has brought me. One must always be
fortifying the other. People not only
want to read of a thing, they come to
see it, and very rightly. Here is an
example. We are gradually getting
shorter and shorter of messengers, so
much so that many shopkeepers no
longer are able to send purchases home.
That means that people must carry
them themselves. Now what more
interesting, valuable or timely picture
could you have than a photograph of
a customer carrying, say, a loaf of
st you
bread—a picture of , the unfortunate
victim of the KAISER in the very act of
having to do something for himself?
How that brings it home to us!”
“By Jove, yes,” said the editor,
deeply impressed.
“I could arrange for someone to be
taken just leaving the shop,” the appli-
cant went on; “and I would put under-
neath something about the straits to
which the War has brought shoppers.”
“Capital ' " said the editor. “Go
on.” -
“Then I have noticed,” said the
youth, “that people are interested in
photographs of musical-comedy and
revue actresses.”
“I believe you may be right,” the
editor remarked pensively. -
“So I would arrange for a steady
series of these ladies, which not only
would delight the public but might be
profitable to the advertisement revenue
of the paper if properly managed; for
I should state what plays they were
in, and where.”
“A great idea,” said the editor.
“But I should not,” the young man
continued, “merely give that informa-
tion beneath. I should add something
topical, such as ‘who has just received
an admiring letter from a stranger at
the Front'; 'who spends her spare time
knitting for our brave lads'; 'whose
latest song is whistled in trench and
camp '; ‘who confesses to a great ad-
miration for Khaki,’ and so on. In this
way you get a War interest, and every
one is the better for looking at some
pictures. Nothing is so elevating as
the constant spectacle of young women
with insufficient noses.”
“Marvellous!” exclaimed the editor.
“But what of the War itself 2 ''
“Ah, yes, I was coming to that,”
the young man went on. “I have a
strong conviction—I may be wrong,
but I think not—that war-pictures are
popular, and I have noticed that one
soldier astonishingly resembles another.
This is a priceless discovery, as I will
show. I would therefore get all the
groups of soldiers that I could take in
open country wherever it was most
convenient to my operator, and I would
label them according to recent events.
For example, I would call one group—
and understand that they would all
have non-committal backgrounds—“A
wayside chat near Salonica'; another,
‘A Tommy narrating the story of his
escape from a Jack Johnson '; a third,
‘A hurried lunch somewhere in France';
a fourth, “How the new group of Lord
DERBY's men will look after a few
weeks'; a fifth, “Our brave lads leav-
ing Flanders on short leave’; and so
on.” -
“But you are a genius!” exclaimed
the editor, surprised into enthusiasm.
“As for the rest of the pictures,” said
the applicant, “I have perhaps peculiar
views, but I hold that they ought to be
photographs of Members of Parliament
walking to or from the House of Com-
mons, a profoundly interesting phase
of modern life too little touched upon;
photographs of the fiancées of soldiers,
of whom it does not matter if no
one had ever heard before, engage-
ments being of the highest importance,
especially at a time when marriage is a
state duty. So much for the staple of
the picture-page, which I trust you do
not consider too daring.”
“Daring, perhaps,” said the editor,
“but not excessively so, and one must
be both nowadays. One must inno-
vate.” - - -
“And then,” pursued the youth, “for
padding—though padding of course
only to the experts, not to the great
hungry asinine public—anything can
be rendered serviceable provided that
the words beneath are adroit enough.
Thus, a view of Westminster Abbey
would be ‘The architectural jewel of
England which the Zeppelins have in
vain tried to bomb '; a view of Victoria
Station, ‘The terminus at which every
day and night, thousands of homing
Tommies are welcomed'; any picture
of a dog cr cat or canary or parrot
would bear a legend to the effect that
all our brave lads love pets and are
never so happy as when accompanied
by a favourite animal; while any
maritime scene would be certainly
related to a recent submarine outrage,
the Almighty in His infinite wisdom
and prevision having made all expanses
of ocean look alike.
“You are certainly,” said the editor,
“a very original and enterprising young
man and I have great pleasure in
engaging you to enrich our sheet.”
But when the paper came out the
picture page was found to differ in no
single respect from the other picture
pages in the other dailies.
LITERARY REPRISALS.
NEARLY three years ago Mr. E. C.
BENTLEY wrote an excellent detective
story called Trent's Last Case. We
now see amongst the latest literary
announcements, Bentley's Conscience,

A TALE OF HEADS.
AFTER nine o'clock parade on that
memorable morning the Sergeant-Major
spoke to this effect: Though he, the
Sergeant-Major, was new to the unit,
he could and would make it plain that
It Would Not Do. Had he taken up
his duties in a dashed glee club or in
a blanked choral society, he wanted
to know? Though he had tried hard
not to, he had been forced to admit
that It was d-d disgraceful. He
had never, he reflected aloud, seen any-
thing like it during an active army
existence that had provided many
shocking sights. And he opined that
there would be fatigues and C.B.s and
court-martials and shootings-at-dawn
if It continued. He was good, even for
a Sergeant-Major.
The trouble was the hairs of the
heads of the unit. And though he had
rightly got the unit by the hairs which
should have been short we felt it to be
exceeding the limit on his part to refer
to us as blanked musicians. More-
over, the band were most annoyed
about it.
The Sergeant-Major paused to reflect,
and to arrange matters with what he
imagined was a sense of justice.
Though, he continued bitterly, we
were more like a Spillikins Circle than
an Army unit, he would, from sheer
native kindness of heart, save us the
imminent gibbet or the burial by a
trench-digging party which awaited us.
He would merely illustrate our mani-
fold faults by taking the case of No. 3
in the rear rank.
“Please, Sir
outraged No. 3.
Silence must be observed. There
was no excuse for the state of No. 3's
hair. Here in camp (coldly), though
we were five miles from a town, we
had a barber, and by all report, though
he had been there but two days, an
excellent barber. No. 3, rear rank, did
not appear to know this.

Silence in the ranks. Not only was
the living presence of a most valuable
functionary stultified by No. 3, but he,
like all his slack kind, must babble on
parade. He, the S.M., would do all
the talking necessary. But even if
No. 3 thought he was back in his local
Debating Society even then he need
not wear his hair long. The others
might look at him to see what an un-
clipped man could come to, and after-
wards show him the Barber's Tent.
This from the
A ripple went along the ranks, and
No. 3's arms shot up despairingly.
There need be no demonstration, and
No. 3 should remember that he was on
parade and furthermore was standing
at attention. He had had no orders to
practise semaphore signalling.
Well, perhaps (grudgingly) he had
now given the unit some faint inkling
of his feelings on the matter. If at any
time in the future a long hair was found
on a man in his unit, etc., etc. (eleven
minutes).
He would now condescend to hear
any excuse that No. 3, rear rank, had
to offer, so that he would be able to

boys should dwell in a Garden of Eden, such
as that depicted by the poet.
During this decisive period a boy was an

AT THE PLAY.
“THE BASKER.”
I IMAGINE The Basker to be de-
signed by “CLIFFoRD MILLs” as a
Tract against Dukes. And certainly
her Duke of Cheviot is a miracle of
obtuseness, who, if he had not been
made a hero by his valet (an original
and happy creation), would have griev-
ously belied the proud old family motto,
“Je me sauvegarde.” George de Lacorfe,
fashionable, fainéant and forty, reader
of The Pink 'Un, ardent bachelor,
Basker in short, suddenly finds the
dukedom of Cheviot thrust upon him.
Quite unlike his egregious ancestors,
who went out and biffed their enemies
in the gate, especially the Gormáykes,
who were an unpleasant shifty kind of
raiders, George proposes to resign all
the Cheviot places, emoluments and
responsibilities to his cousin and heir,
Richard de Lacorfe, on the day the
said Richard shall marry. Now Richard
is a de Lacorfe with the hereditary
Gorndyke blood and nose acquired on
the distaff side. This conspicuous organ
inflames the anger of George's grand-
mother, the dowager, steeped as she is
in the history and prejudices of the
family, while other members of the
august circle harbour unkind thoughts
about their kinsman.
And well they might. If anyone had
“wrong 'un' written all over him it
was Richard. Indeed his Roman nose
was the straightest part of him.
The guileless George who, though
(or because) his grandmother pre-
sented him every birthday after
his majority with a copy of The
History of the de Lacorſes, knew
and cared nothing about their
glorious and stormy past, didn't
suspect the Gorndyke rat in the
de Lacorfe granary. Spendthrift
Richard, who is always getting
urgent blue envelopes from
Samuel & Samuel, is bent on
marrying for money the very
Diana that George loves for her
blue hyacinth eyes. There is a
misunderstanding between George
and Diana (of such a childlike
ingenuousness as to suggest that
really this too easy spot-stroke
should be barred to playwrights),
and the idiotic girl promptly en-
gages herself to Richard, who is
of course in love with a patently
naughty married woman. The
most reckless of lovers from the *
moment when in his ardour he
(apparently) bites this lady's
hand in the First Act, in full
view of the family, till he plans a
midnight flirtation by the Cheviot
his marriage to Diana, he is an obvi-
ously doomed villain. The lady is sur-
prised by George in the act of knocking
thrice on the said postern within.
When three knocks are heard without

together with the voice of Richard, the
Duke really begins to suspect some-
thing. Virtuous imbecility prevails over
villainous stupidity. The final blow is
dealt upon the Gorndyke nose. Diana
is retrieved by this last of the safe-
guarders, and we are left to a melan-
THE SOUL’S AWAKENING.
Nalet, the valet (Mr. LEoN QUARTERMAINE), having been
dismissed for not calling George de Lacorfe (Sir GEORGE
ALEXANDER) in the morning, makes good by waking his

choly calculation as to what the mental
capacity of their issue is likely to be.
A good deal of spontaneous and
honest laughter, the best of testi-
monials, greeted this rather ingenuous
extravaganza. I think Mrs. CLIFFord
MILLs would do well not to prolong
her mystifications beyond the point
when they are quite clear to her
audience. May I without boastfulness
record that I guessed all about what
Richard was going to do with the tiara
quite three minutes before a well-known
editor in front of me gave away the
secret in a hoarse whisper to his neigh-
bour? And that was some time before
the author had finished the “prepara-
tion" of the business. And may I ask
why Richard was forced to so fatuous
a contrivance as the pawning of the
tiara to make the exigent Samuels stay
their hands for a week? True he
couldn't tell them about the Cheviotdeal,
which was a secret between himself and
George; but he could surely have used
the fact of his coming marriage with
Diana's money? And why didn't
Diana write to her mother and ask her
what was the solemn warning about
Richard that she had on the tip of her
tongue when she was interrupted just
before going abroad 2 There is a mail
to Singapore, isn't there? And does a
George, succeeding to a dukedom, be-
come “Cheviot ” to his sister ?
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER was at his
excellent best in the lighter moods of
the Basker. But I did not like
to see him in pain (especially as
it all seemed so unnecessary).
Mr. LEoN QUARTERMAINE, in the
really engaging part of the Duke's
valet, who learned to think for
himself and read to such excellent
effect the history so carelessly
neglected by his master, was
quite admirable. But then he
always is. Mr. NoFMAN FoRBEs
had little to exercise his powers
in a churchwarden version of the
stage - parson with a tiresome
wife. Miss HILDA MooRE looked
charmingly wicked and acted
H with intelligence. The too serious
rôle tossed lightly by the author
into the broadest farce presents
an impossible problem. Miss
ELLEN O'MALLEY never mis-
handles a part. Sometimes, as
here, a part is not too kind to her.
As George's sister she could be
no more than a competent peg.
Miss MARIE HEMINGWAY had
merely to look perplexed and
pretty, which she did with com-
plete success. Everyone was
frankly delighted to welcome back
to the stage that great artist Miss

MY BIRTH DAY.
“My birthday,” I said, “is setting in with its usual
severity.” -
“What,” said Francesca, “ has driven you to this terrible
conclusion ?” -
“Little signs; straws showing how the wind blows.”
“I wonder,” she said, “how that came to be a proverb.
Personally I don't keep packets of straws to test the wind
by, and I never met anybody else who did. Handkerchiefs
are much more certain, and men's hats are best of all."
“Yes,” I said, “when I see my hat starting full tilt
on an excursion I always know which way the wind is
blowing right enough. Tell me, Francesca, why does a
man's hat, when it's blown off, always bring up in a
puddle?” º * - -
“And get run over by a butcher's cart?"
“And why does everybody laugh at the hat's owner” ”
“And why does the boy who brings it back to you
expect payment for the miserable and useless object 2"
“And where,” I said, “does the owner disappear to

never get that sentence right, but you know what I mean.
Anyhow I will put the dreadful vision by. What was I
talking about when this hat calamity broke in 2"
“You had made,” said Francesca, “a cold and distant
allusion to your birthday. It's coming to-morrow.”
“Well,” I said, “it can come if it likes, but I shall refuse
to receive it. I don't want it. I'm quite old enough
without it. At my age people don't have birthdays. They
just go on living, and other people say how wonderful they
are for their years, and they must be sixty if they're a day,
but nobody would think so, and * :
“And that it's all due to early rising and regular habits.”
“And smoking and partial abstemiousness.”

“Orders ?” she said.
absurdities like that.”
“Yes,” I said, “they do; but their orders are not obeyed.
There's Frederick, for instance. He's only eight, I know,
but he's got something up his sleeve. He asked me
yesterday if I could lend him threepence, and did I think
that a small notebook with a pencil would be a nice present
for a sort of uncle on his birthday—not a father, mind you,
There's a Machiavelli for you.”
“And what did you say?”
“I told him I had never met an uncle who didn't adore
notebooks, but that few fathers really appreciated them :
and then he countered me. He said he had noticed that
many fathers were uncles too.” +
“That child,” said Francesca, “will be a Lord Chancellor.
He'd look splendid on a woolsack.”
“Yes, later on. At present his legs would dangle a bit,
wouldn't they 2”
“They're very-well-shaped legs, anyhow.
Chancellor would be proud to possess them.”
“To resume,” I said, “about the birthday. There's
Alice too. She's engaged on some nefarious scheme with a
paint-box and a sheet of paper. It's directed at me, I
know, because, whenever I approach her, things have to
be hustled away or covered up. However, it's all useless.
My mind's made up. I will not have a birthday.”
“You can't prevent it, you know.”
“People don't give orders about
Any Lord
“Yes, I can," I said. “It’s mine, and if I decide not to
have it nobody can make me.”
“But isn't that rather selfish 2 ”
“It can't be selfish of me to deprive myself of a birthday.
“But you're depriving the children of it, and that's
worse than selfish. It's positively heartless.”
“Very well, then, I'm heartless. At any rate my orders
are that there shall be no birthday; and don't you forget it,
or, rather, forget it as hard as ever you can.”
“I can't hold out the least prospect that your sugges-
tion will meet with favourable consideration.”
The birthday duly arrived, and I went down to breakfast.
As I entered the room a shout of applause broke from the
already assembled family. “Look at your place,” said
Frederick. I did, and beheld on the table a collection of
unaccustomed articles. There was a box of chocolates
from Muriel and Nina; there was a note-book with an
appropriate pencil. “That,” said Frederick, ºf for Cousin
Herbert's uncle. Ha, ha!” And there was ºrom Alice,
a painted Calendar fit to hang on any wall. It represents
a Tartar nobleman haughtily walking in a green meadow,
with a background of snow-capped mountains. He has a
long pig-tail and a black velvet cap with a puce knob.
His trousers are blue striped with purple. He has a long
blue cloak decorated with red figures, and his carmine
train is borne by a juvenile page dressed in a short orange-
coloured robe. It is a very magnificent design, and on
the back of it is written :- -
“This is but a Birthday rhyme
Written in this dark War-time.
We can't afford to waste our ink,
And so I'll quickly stop, I think.”
Thus I was compelled to have a birthday after all.

PERUSING the epistles I devotedly indite
You long, I know, Lucasta dear, to see me as I write:
Your fancy paints my portrait framed in hectic scenes of
War-
I'll try to show you briefly what my circumstances are.
Your swain is now a troglodyte; as in a dungeon deep
He who so worshipped stars and you must write and eat
and sleep; -
Like some swart djinnee of the mine your sunshine-loving
slave -
Builds airy castles, meet for two, 'neath candles in a cave.
Above, the sky is very grey, the world is very damp,
His light the sun denies by day, the moon by night her
lamp :
Across the landscape soaked and sad the dull guns answer
back, -
And through the twilight's futile hush spasmodic rifles
crack.
The papers haven't come to-day to show how England
feels;
The hours go lame and languidly between our Spartan
meals;
We've written letters till we're tired, with not a thing to
tell
Except that nothing's doing, weather beastly, writer well.
So when you feel for us out here—as well I know you will—
Then sympathise with thousands for their country sitting
still ;
Don't picture battle pieces by the lurid Press adored,
But miles and miles of Britishers, in burrows, badly bored!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Narcissus (SECKER), by Miss Viola MEYNELL, is one of
those books for which I cannot help feeling that my appre-
ciation would have been keener two years ago than is
possible to-day. It is the story of the growth to manhood
of two brothers, Victor and Jimmy, who live with their
widowed mother in an outer suburb of London. That
there is art, very subtle and delicate art, in the telling of it
goes without saying. The characters of the brothers are
realized with exquisite care. Victor, the elder, uncertain,
violently sensitive and emotional, seeking always from life
what he is never destined (at least so far as the present
story carries him) to attain ; Jimmy, placid, shallow,
avoiding all emotion, attracting happiness like a magnet.
Nothing, I repeat, could be better done in its kind than
obvious. He, I take it, is Narcissus (though Narcissi would
have been a truer title for the book, as each of the brothers
is more in love with his own reflection than with anything
else), and, since he is left unmarried at the close of the
volume, I derived some quiet satisfaction from the thought
that modified conscription might yet make a man of him.
Why will the heroes of historical fiction persist in that
dangerous practice of leaving an angry and overmastered
villain bound to a tree to await death or rescue 2 The
result is rescue every time, and one way and another a
mort of trouble for the good characters. Still it may be
argued that if the protagonist of The Fortunes of Garin
(CoNSTABLE) had not followed this risky precedent those
fortunes would not have led him where they eventually
did, and we should have missed one of the best costume

high-stepping movement and a glow of colour that reminded
me of nothing more than that splendid pageant one follows
'round the walls of the Riccardi Palace in Florence. Of
course the journey ends in lovers' meeting and the teaching
of his place to the evil-minded. The fact that this latter
was called Jaufre, a name that I would wish kindlier
entreated, is almost my only complaint against a lively
and entertaining story which more than once rises to real
beauty.
Given a plot of the conventional order I dare say it is
best to make very little fuss or mystery about it. So, at
any rate, “KATHARINETYNAN” seems to think, for after about
page 32 of her latest book, Since First I Saw Your Face
(HUTCHINSON), there is really almost no guessing left to do,
the authoress seeming principally concerned to ensure a
smooth passage for one's prophecies. Thus, while the un-
It has no very obvious plan,
No movement, no connected story;
And yet I don't see how you can
Fail to enjoy The S.S. Glory.
You'll meet some men you're sure to like—
Men who would greet you as a brother;
One is that honest fellow, Mike,
And Cockney, possibly, another;
Unpolished, quick to wrath and slow,
When roused, to lay aside their choler,
Yet are they types you ought to know
As well as did the hero, Scholar.
In an eloquent foreword to The Queen's Gift Book,
(HopDER AND SToUGHToN), we are told by Mr. GALsworthy
that it is “in the nature of a hat passed round, into which,
known son of a secret marriage,
happening by good luck to
thrash the ostensible claimant
to the title and heroine, gets
that successful start in the early
pages that is so necessary to
his happiness in the last, and
the lady never really looks like
straying far into disconcerting
opinions of her own, even the
rival himself obliges us by
throwing up the sponge just
when the game should really
begin. All this is soothing
enough, but it is also very thin
stuff; and the addition of a
ghostly ancestress, who lures
her descendants to midnight
assignations by smiling at them
out of a LELY painting, does
not stiffen things much. The
fact is that away from such a
purely Irish subject as, say,
“Countrymen All,” Mrs. HINK-
soN really has not much to tell.
Sweeney's New York Stores do
not harmonise at all well with her
atmosphere of wistful tragedy.

lost, is a chance for us to pay a little of the unpayable debt
we owe to them. Mr. GALsworthy may rest assured that
his appeal to “our honour in this matter" will not be
made in vain.

While the battle-thunder rolls,
Hug your little party hobbies,
So to save your little souls,
Treating England's deadly peril like a topic for the polls;
Half of you—the record's written–
Lately strode to Downing Street
And for love of Little Britain
Wallowed at the PREMIER's feet,
Urging him to check the wanton waste of our superfluous

And the KAISER got his way,
Teuton crushers might be planted
On our hollow tums to-day,
And a grateful foe be asking what you want for traitors'

You in turn were keen about
Putting Thomas in the gravy,
Leaving Thomas up the spout,
Lest if adequately aided he should wipe the strafers out.

On the salvage of a fetish than the winning of the fight.

O. S.
WHITTLING THEM DOWN.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I know you must be longing to have
my analysis of the Derby figures. I hasten to comply, for
I may say that I have never, since the War began, had
finer scope for my individual talents. Never have I had
—not even in the great Copper Controversy—a bunch of
figures of which it may more truly be said that they are
not what they seem, that there is more in them than meets
the eye, and that they contain wheels within wheels.
And first of all, Sir, I hope you will allow me to explain
where I am in this matter; everybody's doing it; and you
will then see at once the moral grandeur of my attitude.
I am a convinced believer in the Voluntary System, always
have been—on principle. But I am willing to sacrifice
even that for victory. If it can be shown that by com-
pulsion one single man can be added to our forces who would
not have volunteered (even if he had been scientifically
bullied), I will be willing to adopt conscription. But, Sir,
it cannot be shown.
The crux of the situation admittedly lies with the figures
of the Single Men. (In case of misapprehension I should
make it clear that when I spoke above of “one single man"
I did not mean one unmarried man, but one sole man).
We have to begin our attack upon this figure of 651,160
unstarred single men unaccounted for. It seems a good
many. But wait a bit. We shall now proceed to concen-
trate a powerful succession of deductions. It only needs a
fearless and patriotic ingenuity.
Let us not disregard obvious facts. From this number
we must subtract.— . -
(1) Ministers of religion. 5 per cent.
(2) Mercantile Marine . . 5 ,,
(3) Medically unfit . 40 ,,
(4) Criminals . 1 # ,,
(5) Badged . . . 10 ,,
(6) Indispensables . 10 ,,
Total 71; per cent. You see we are already getting on.
But before going any further we had better consolidate the
ground already won by making certain additions, in case
any one man has been counted twice. These are—
(1) Ministers of religion who are also medically unfit.
(2) Criminals in the mercantile marine.
(3) Ministers of religion in the mercantile marine.
(4) Criminals who are medically unfit.
(5) Indispensable criminals.
(6) Badged criminal ministers of religion.
These categories taken together may be put at 74 per
cent. of our 713 per cent., and must be deducted from the
deductions. There are also the blind, halt and maimed,
deaf, dumb and inebriate, but I am willing to throw all
of them in so as to be on the safe side. -
So far we have to deduct, then, some 66% per cent. from
our total. We must do better than that if we are to get on
the right side of negligibility. So now we'come to examine
the canvass. A good many men were not canvassed, or at
least misunderstood the canvasser. I know of one man
in my constituency (unstarred, unbadged, fit, single and
of army age) who thought the fellow had come to collect
for Foreign Missions, to which he has a conscientious
objection.
Along with these I propose to deduct the great class of
what I shall call the Self-centred. These are they who
not only were never canvassed, but didn't even so much as
hear about it, who had probably given up newspapers as a
war economy and were living quiet virtuous lives in out-
of-the-way places. Add to them removals and conscientious
objectors (less allowance for conscientious removals) and
we have a total not short of 27; per cent.
Then again, as the supply of recruits becomes exhausted,
it must always be remembered that we are dealing with a
residuum. That is to say, those that remain are always
growing more conscientious, more criminal, more unfit,
more mercantile and so on. However, I count nothing for
that, for I haven't much of my total left to dispose of, and
I have still to deal with spoiled cards.
Everyone who has assisted at a contested election knows
very well that many mistakes cecur. I propose to allow 3
per cent. for illegible cards which prevented the canvasser
from tracking his prey, 4 per cent. for those who failed to
find the recruiting office owing to misdirection, but will be
sure to find it before long, and per cent, for sundries, such
as men who were temporarily confined to the house.
Our final result is thoroughly satisfactory, and one that
must give Compulsionists some food for thought, for how-
ever much they may wish to introduce the principle they
cannot desire to reduce our forces in the field in the middle
of a great war. In a word, we must deduct 101 per
cent. from 651,160. That gives us an adverse balance
of 9,767. This means that, if the present Bill is to go
through and compulsion is definitely adopted, nearly half a
division of our present army must be disbanded forthwith.
It is just as well that we should see clearly what we are
heading for. -
It has given me great pleasure to have the opportunity
of clearing up this vexed question. -
I am, Yours as usual,
STATISTICIAN. BIs.

[JANUARY 19, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW THEATRICAL VENTURE.
A FRIEND of mine has started as
manager of his first theatre these
holidays. It may seem to you an un-
propitious moment for such a beginning,
but in many ways this special theatre
is exceptionally well guaranteed against
failure. The proprietor was kind enough
to invite my presence at his opening
performance. As a matter of fact I
had myself put up the money for it.
Naturally I was anxious for the thing
to be a success. The theatre stands
on what you could truthfully call a dragged a little. Perhaps this was
commanding situation at one [.
end of the schoolroom table.
It is an elegant renaissance
edifice of wood and card-
board, with a seating accom-
modation only limited by the
dimensions of the schoolroom
itself, and varying with the
age of the audience. The
lighting effects are provided
in theory by a row of oil
foot-lamps, so powerful as to
be certain, if kindled, to con-
sume the entire building; in
practice, therefore, by a num-
ber of candle-ends, stuck in
the wings on their own
grease. These not only fur-
nish illumination, but, when
extinguished (as they con.
stantly are by falling scenery)
produce a penetrating aroma
which is specially dear to the
managerial nostrils.
The manager, to whom I
have already had the pleasure
of introducing you, is Peter.
I have been impatiently wait-
ing for the moment of Peter's
first theatre, these nine years.
Like marbles or Treasure
Island, it is at once a land-
mark and a milestone in the
Driver.
present-giving career of an T.
uncle. So I had devoted some con-
siderable care to its selection.
In one respect Peter's theatre re-
minds me of the old Court in the days
of the VEDRENNE-BARKER repertory.
You recall how one used to see the
same people at every performance, a
permanent nucleus of spectators that
never varied ? The difference is that
Peter's permanent nucleus are neither
so individually agreeable nor in any
true sense enthusiasts of the drama.
Indeed, being painted on the pro-
scenium, with their backs to the stage,
the effect they produce is one of studied
indifference. Nay more, a horrible sus-
picion about them refused to be banished
from my thoughts; it was based partly
upon the costumes of the ladies, partly
on the undeniably Teutonic suggestion
DRIVE CAREFULLY, PLEASE.
I said nothing about this to Peter.
Despite the presence of these un-
pleasing persons, the opening perform-
ance must be pronounced a real success.
Perhaps more as a spectacle than any-
thing else. Scenically the show was
a triumph; the memory of the Forest
Glade especially will remain with me
for weeks by reason of the stiff neck
I got from contorting myself under
Peter's guidance to the proper angle
for its appreciation. But histrionic-
ally it must be confessed that things
“THAT’S FUNNY |
due to a certain severity, not to say
baldness, in the dialogue as spoken.
Not having read the script, I have a
feeling that it might be unfair to judge
the unknown author by the lines as
rendered by Peter, who was often pre-
occupied with other anxieties. As, for
example, the scene in the Baronial
Castle between its noble but unscru-
pulous proprietor and a character intro-
duced by Peter with the simple notice:
“This is a murderer coming on now.”
Baron. Oh, are you a murderer?
Murderer. Yes.
Bar. Oh, well, you've got to murder
the Princess.
Murd. All right.
Bar. That's all of that scene.
Crisp, of course, and to the point;
but I feel sure that there must have
in the gentlemen's uniforms. However, been more in the interview as originally
written.
Perhaps, again, the cast was to blame
for whatever may have been disappoint-
ing in the performance. Individually
they were a fine company, passionate
and wiry of gesture, and full of energy.
Indeed their chief fault sprang from an
incapacity to remain motionless in
repose. This led to a notable lack of
balance. However sensational it may
be for the exit of every character to
bring down the house, its effect is
unfortunately to retard the action of

the piece.
– Personally I consider that
the women were the worst
offenders. Take the heroine,
for example. Lovely she may
have been, though in a style
more appreciated by the late
GEORGE CRUIKSHANK than by
myself; but looks are not
|everything. Art simply didn't
exist for her. Revue might
have been her real line; or,
ºr still, a strong-woman
turn on the Halls. There
was the episode, for instance,
where, having to prostrate
herself before the Baron, she
insisted upon a backward exit
(with the usual result) and
then made an acrobatic re-

impatient at the vagaries of
his company. Finally, when
the Executioner (a mere
walker-on of no importance
whatever) had twice brought
ridicule upon the ultimate
solemnities of the law by
his introduction of comic
dives off the scaffold, the
manager rang down the cur-
tain. Not before it was time.
“They're lovely to look
at,” he observed, surveying the supine
cast, “but awfully difficult to do any-
thing with.”
“Peter,” I answered gratefully, “as

proved upon.”
Of course he didn't understand; but,
being dramatist as well as uncle, I
enjoyed saying it.

BADGES.
My companion had the habit of
muttering to himself and I was re-
lieved when he leant over and spoke to
me. He was a dry little man of middle
age, with a nervous kindly face and
eyes that twinkled with the voluntary
spirit. I had seen him on summer
evenings clipping his hedge and pruning
his roses, for we lived nearly opposite
to each other. Suddenly he emerged
from his newspaper and said in a quick
determined way, “What this country
wants, Sir, is more buttonholes. The
best suits have only two buttonholes;
that is to say, only two that are
superfluous, the rest are all needed by
buttons. It's a scandal, Sir!”
“Isn't there one at the bottom of
the waistcoat?” I asked.
“Quite useless,” he said with much
energy, though smiling very kindly.
“Quite useless for the purpose. The
matter,” he added, “would not be so
urgent if we had more sleeves. Worse
even than the dearth of button-holes is
the lack of eligible sleeves. In peace
time two sleeves may have been suffi-
cient; to-day . . . Well, you can sym-
pathise.” He looked (still smiling) at
the khaki armlet that bound my arm
and the Special Constable's badge that
nestled in my overcoat.
He had the shy decisiveness of a man
who seldom spoke his mind. If neces-
sary I would have wrested his name
from him and pretended a relationship
with his wife. But he needed no
encouragement.
“At the beginning, when one was
just a special constable, it didn't matter
so much. I wore my badge and my
armlet when I was on duty and some-
times when I was not. Even when I
joined our Volunteer Corps I was not
seriously embarrassed. After all, one
could alternate the badges and the
armlets and, at a pinch, wear them all
together. Then I became an unskilled
munition worker, which meant three
badges and two armlets. At first I
wore two on my overcoat and three
inside. Then I would give some of
them a rest, generally to find that I was
wearing the wrong ones on the wrong
occasions. Altogether it was very con-
fusing.”
“So far,” I said with some sym-
pathy, “I can follow you. I am my-
self an unskilled War Office clerk; but
you have forgotten Lord DERby's
armlet, which at the moment has the
place of honour with me.”
“No,” he said, “I have that too.
And I have another badge. I earned
it on New Year's Day.”
He took off his spectacles and rubbed
them mechanically. It gave him a

THE WATCH DOGS.
xxxii.I.
MY DEARCHARLEs, You didn't catch
sight of anymention of mein despatches,
did you? I have been rather too busy
myself to read the list properly, but I
did just have time to cast a casual eye
over the “H's,” and I didn't notice the
name of “Henry" standing out in
heavy-leaded capitals. It must be an in-
advertence, of course. They must have
said something about me, as, for in-
stance: “Especially to be remarked is
the noble altruism of Lieut. Henry,
who on more than one march has been
observed to take his pack, containing
all his worldly goods, off his back and
to hand it without ostentation to some
lucky driver of a limber, saying, ‘Take
it, my lad; your need is greater than
mine.’ ” Or again, referring to my
later career: “The pen is mightier
than the sword, but Lieut. Henry's in-
delible pencil, when engaged on official
correspondence, is mightier than both.”
Or at least, at the very beginning of
things, I'm quite sure the Mentioner
devoted a passing phrase to me: “By
the way, I have just received a consign-
ment described on the Movement Order
as ‘Officer, one, Henry, Lieut.’ Speaking
frankly as between ourselves, what is
it exactly 2 In any case I would gladly
exchange for a dozen tins of bully beef.”
Talking of despatches, I see that our
old friend the Regimental Anarchist has
not escaped notice. I never thought
he would, for a less unnoticeable man I
don't remember meeting. He is one of
those big untidy fellows, very nice for
purposes of war and all that, whom not
the cleverest adjutant could manage to
conceal on a ceremonial parade. His
service equipment alone was notorious
in the division. While we were still in
England he and I used to share a
billet. Every night the last thing I
saw before going to sleep was the
Anarchist trying on a new piece of
personal furniture. He had at least a
hundred aunts, and each of them had
at least a hundred bright ideas; besides
which few days went by but he paid a
generous visit to the military outfitter.
Never in my life shall I forget the
sight of him during our last moments
at home. While others were stuffing
into themselves the last good meal
they expected to taste for three years or
the duration, he was putting on patent
waterproof after patent waterproof. He
stepped forth at last, sweating at every
pore, and it wasn't raining at the time
and didn't look like raining till next
winter. The 38-lb. limit prevented his
putting more than four coats into his
valise, and his method of packing
didn't economise space. If there had
been any limit, however generous, to
the amount of room an officer may
occupy in the column of route we'd
have had to go abroad without our
Anarchist, and a much quieter and
more respectable life we'd have had
that way.
Even in our earliest days in B.E.F.,
when we were well behind the firing
line, he started playing with fire.
Thinking that we shared his low tastes
he would gather us round him and
lecture us on the black arts. “This
little fellow,” he would say, fetching an
infernal machine out of his pocket—
“this little fellow is as safe as houses
provided he has no detonator in his
little head. But we will just make
sure.” A flutter of excitement would
pass round the audience as he started
unscrewing the top to make sure. “Of
course,” he'd continue, finding the
screw a bit stiff and getting absorbed
in his toy—“of course, if there should
happen to be a detonator inside, you
have only to tickle it and almost
anything may happen.” While he'd
be struggling with the screw, the front
row of the audience would be shifting
its ground to give the back rows a
better view. “You can't be too care-
ful,” he'd say, passing it lightly from
one hand to the other in order to search
for his well-known clasp-knife, “for
if you're not careful,” he'd explain,
tucking the bomb under his arm so
as to have both hands free to open
the knife—“if you're not careful,”
he'd say, suddenly letting go the knife
in order to catch the bomb as it slid
from his precarious hold—“if you're
not very careful” (getting to real busi-
ness with the murderous blade), “very
—very—careful . . .” But none of us
were ever near enough by that time
to hear what would happen if we
weren't (or even if he wasn't).
And then those strange nights in the
trenches, when he and I used to be on
duty together! I would be waiting in
our luxurious, brightly-lit gin-palace of
a dug-out for him to join me at our
midnight lunch. He'd come in at last,
clad in his fleece lining, the only sur-
vivor of his extensive collection of
overcoats, its absence of collar giving
him a peculiarly clerical look. He'd
sit down to his cocoa, but hardly be
started on the day before yesterday's
newspaper (just arrived with the
rations) before the private bombard-
ment would begin. I would spring to
attention; he would go on reading.
“Hush ' " I'd say. (Why “Hush ' "
I don't know.) “What's all that
for 2" “Me,” he'd say, turning to
the personal column. And then I'd
know that, seizing the opportunity of
being unobserved, he'd been out for
a nocturnal stroll with a handful of
bombs, seeking a little innocent plea-
sure. The gentlemen opposite, not
being cricketers themselves or knowing
anything about the slow bowler, had,
as usual, mistaken him for a trench
mortar and were making a belated reply.
Only his servant accompanied him
on these jaunts. He was a nice quiet
villain, whose lust for adventure had,
I always imagine, been long ago satis-
fied by a dozen or so gentle burglaries
in his civilian past. He didn't want
to kill people; his job in life was to
keep his master alive and well fed.
So when the latter went out bombing
he thought he might as well go out
with him, and occupy himself picking
turnips for to-morrow's stew.
When the Anarchist wasn't dis-
tributing bombs he was collecting
bullets. Being untidy by nature, he
didn't particularly care where they hit
him, provided they didn't damage his
pipe. That was all he cared about, his
lyddite and his tobacco. I often wonder
how it was he didn't get the two habits
of his life mixed up—fill a pipe with
H.E., light it and finish off that way.
But he didn't ; he has just gone on
collecting lead, letting it accumulate
about his person until it got too heavy
to be convenient and then resorting to
the nearest hospital to have it removed.
I hear he 's there now, the result, I
gather, of a bit of a show. It was his
servant who was walking about that
unhealthy field at that imprudent time
and found him. One would like to
paint a romantic picture of the meet-
ing, but I doubt if there was much
romance about it. I am quite sure all
the Anarchist cared about was his
tobacco pouch and all the servant was
interested in was the further collection
of vegetables, just in case.
I can see our Anarchist, lying in his
little white bed in the hospital, sur-
rounded by his sevenpenny racing
novels (with or without covers), his
tins of navy-cut (some empty, some
full), his fleece lining, his compass,
his socks, his field-glasses, his ties,
his revolver and his last month's
letters (some opened, some not), all
jumbled happily together, with his
ragged old shaving - brush reigning
proudly in the midst. I doubt if he
knows he's been “mentioned,” for one
could never get him to take interest in
any news which wasn't “sporting";
possibly he is made suspicious by the
uncomfortable presence of unopened
telegrams in all corners of his bed.
But one thing I do hope, and that is
that this bed is, at any rate, not
strewn, inside and out, with unexploded
hand-grenades.
Yours ever, HENRY.

Commissioner of Australia, took his

Bar from his native steed he was intro-
duced by BonAR LAw, Unionist Colonial
Secretary, and HARcourt, Colonial
Secretary in late Liberal Government.

testifying to universal esteem and ex-
ceptional personal popularity, unique

work of helping the Mother Country
to bring the War to triumphant con-
clusion.
GEORGE REID's career on a new stage
will be watched with keen interest in
his two antipodal homes. Since, six
years ago, he came to London, he has
acquired the reputation of being one of
the best after-dinner speakers of the
day. How will the qualities that ensure
success in that direction serve him at
Westminster? MACAULAY truly said,
“The House of Commons is the most
peculiar audience in the world. A place
in which I would not promise success
to any man.”

Second-Lieutenant. All might have
been well if the Second-Lieutenant had
not forgotten to fire the correct salute
of fourteen bombs (or whatever was the
correct salute). The G.O.C. investi-
gated. He searched the woods and
delved in the instructional trenches,
but never another officer came to light.
So he went home and, after a bad
lunch—we surmise—set himself to
abolish Alternative Necessary Duties
in a formal edict. No officer is to
absent himself from a parade except
by the express orders of an O.C. Base
Depôt.
This happened several days ago, and
the ruling is probably obsolete by now,
but I am wondering how I shall break
the news to the G.O.C. if I should
happen to meet him on one of my
morning walks into town; and in my
heart of heart I know that one fine
morning I shall be cowardly, and wake
before nine, and attend my first parade
at army Base. Some zealous despatch
rider will dash hot-foot to the G.O.C.
with the news, and he will come and
rub his hands and chuckle and gloat.
It will be a Black Day.
Here too there are minor points of
etiquette that vex one. Is it correct
for me, having bought half a kilo of
chocolates while waiting for a train, to
kill further time by eating them out of
a paper bag under the surveillance of
an A.S.C. sergeant 2 or ought I to offer
a few to the sergeant with some jeu
d'esprit—never coarse and never cruel
—about bully beef ? Of such are the
complexities with which a Base harasses
the soul of an officer nurtured in the
genial simplicity of trench life.
From an account of the Peace de-
monstration in Berlin :-
“The people simply turned up themselves,

It seems to have been a complete
revolution.
LITERARY LISPINGS.
THE “motive” of Mrs. Pumfrey Lord's
new novel is Christian Science, and
the hero, the Duke of Southminster, is
understood to be a composite portrait of
Lord Rose BERY and Mr. GLADSTONE.
The character of the evil genius of the
plot, Lord Rufus Doldrum, is partly
modelled on ALCIBIADEs, but in its main
lines is reminiscent of Mrs. EDDY
and Major WINstoN CHURCHILL. On
the other hand the eccentric Lord
Wymondham, who creates a sensation
by appearing at a Cabinet meeting in
accordion-pleated pyjamas, is under-
stood to be an entirely imaginary per-
sonage. The novel, which has been
running in Wanamaker's Weekly, will
shortly be published by the Strongmans.
A PoET who Counts.
Mr. , Ouseley Pampfield, who has
been recuperating at Buxton after
spraining his ankle while getting out
of his magnificent motor, is now seeing
his new volume of poems through the
press. Under the arresting title of
The Soul of a Passivist they will
shortly be published by the firm of
Coddler and Slack.
The JIMMISONS AGAIN.
The Long Lanes will shortly publish
a new “Jimmison '' novel, The Factota.
The heroine is a young lady enamoured
of the doctrine of the economic inde-
pendence of women. She enters a
Draper's Emporium in Manchester
and works her way up to the post of
manager, but heads a strike of the
work-girls. The claims of romance,
however, are not overlooked, for in the
long run Retta Carboy—for that is her
charming name—wins the hand and
heart of the junior partner's chauffeur,
who turns out to be son of the Earl
of Ancoats. The scene in which the
Rolls-Royce, frightened by the sight
of some Highland cattle, executes a
cross-cut counter-rocking skid, is one
of the finest things the Jimmisons have
ever done.
ARMAGEDDON IN THE MAKING.
Governesses, so long the butt of un-
kindly satire, have at last come by
their own. Miss Bertha Bowlong, who
was governess to the KAISER in the
late “sixties,” is shortly about to
publish her reminiscences of her now
all-too-notorious pupil. Strange to say
it never occurred to her to set them
down till quite recently, nearly fifty
years after the event. The book, which
is now announced by the Talboys, is
rich in illuminating anecdotes of the
future WAR Lord, as well as vivid
portraits of Moltke, BISMARCK, TREIT-
sch KE, MüNCHHAUSEN, Eulenspiegel,
Dudelsack and other luminaries of
the Prussian capital.
THE CHARM of CANNIBALISM.
Miss Ermyntrude Stuggy (Mrs. Ray-
mond Blott), whose extraordinary novel,
The Lurid Lady, was described by
Father BERNARD WAUGHAN as the
most “precipitous” book he had ever
preached on, has returned to England
after two years' residence among the
cannibals of the Solomon Islands.
Hence the title of her forthcoming
volume, The Adorable Anthropophagi,
which is already announced by Messrs.
Hybrow and Garbidge. The contents
explain why Mr. Blott has heroically
preferred to remain with the cannibals.
MAJOR FINCH's GREAT DIscovery.
Major Hector Finch, the famous
Nationalist M.P., philosopher, psycho-
logist and scholar, has made a remark-
able literary discovery. It is that
Johnson's Dictionary is not, as is
generally supposed, the work of BEN
JoNSON, but of SAMUEL Johnsox, the
son of a Lichfield bookseller. This
epoch-making revelation, briefly and
modestly outlined in a letter to The
Daily Chronicle, will be set forth in
detail in a massive volume of 1,000
pages, with a portrait of the author, to
be issued shortly by the House of
Swallow and Gull.
ODDS AND ENDs.
The Vegetarians, a novel with a
strong dietetic interest by Janet Melinda
Didham, is announced by the firm of
Gherkin Mark.
The Molly Monologues is the alluring
title of a volume of sketches by
Richard Turpin, shortly appearing with
Pincher and Steel.
Miss Loofah Windsor, who wrote
The Washpot, a successful story of last
summer, has just finished a new one of
a humorous type, called What—no
Soap 2 which the Dinwiddies will
publish in a month or two.
“A few lucky corps actually had geese to
pave the way for the Christmas pudding;
they were quartered in some place where a
whip round among the officers and a ride to
the nearest town or village secured enough
geese to feed a battalion.”

Somehow we feel that this might have
been more tactfully expressed.

quarters of an hour on militarism, The Daily
Mail, Suvla BaBy, and sundry other topics.”

ON THE CARDS.
To many people wholly free from
superstition, except that, after spilling
the salt, they are careful to throw a
little over the left shoulder, and do not
go out of their way to walk under
ladders, and are not improved in appe-
tite by sitting thirteen at table, and
much prefer that may should not be
brought into the house—to these
people, otherwise so free from supersti-
tion, it would perhaps be surprising to
know what great numbers of their
fellow-creatures resort daily to such
black arts as fortune-telling by the
cards.
Yet quite respectable, God-fearing,
church-going old ladies, and probably
old gentlementoo, treasure this practice,
to say nothing of younger and there-
fore naturally more frivolous folk; and
many make the consultation of the
two and fifty oracles a morning habit.
And particularly women. Those well-
thumbed packs of cards that we know
so well are not wholly dedicated to
“Patience,” I can assure you.
All want to be told the same thing:
what the day will bring forth. But
each searcher into the dim and danger-
ous future has, of course, individual
methods—some shuffling seven times
and some ten, and so forth, and all
intent upon placating the elfish god-
dess, Caprice. There is little Miss
Banks, for example, but I must tell
you about her.
Nothing would induce little Miss
Banks to leave the house in the morning
without seeing what the cards promised
her, and so open and impressionable
are her mind and heart that she is still
interested in the colour of the romantic
fellow whom the day, if kind, is to ſling
across her path. The cards, as you
know, are great on colours, all men
being divided into three groups: dark
(which has the preference), fair, and
middling. Similarly for you, if you can
get little Miss Banks to read your fate
(but you must of course shuffle the
pack yourself) there are but three kinds
of charmers: dark (again the most
fascinating and to be desired), fair, and
middling.
It is great fun to watch little Miss
Banks at her necromancy. She takes
it so earnestly, literally wrenching the
future's secrets from their lair.
“A letter is coming to you from some
one," she says. “An important letter.”
And again, “I see a voyage over
water.”
Or very seriously, “There's a death.”
You gasp.
“No, it's not yours. A fair woman's.”
You laugh. “Only a fair woman's' "
you say. “Go on.”

Tommy. “NEveR MIND, NURSE, PUT IT Down.
IT'LL PLEASE HER!”
But the cards have not only ambigui-
ties, but strange reticences.
“Oh,” little Miss Banks will say, her
eyes large with excitement, “there's a
payment of money and a dark man.”
“Good,” you say.
“But I can't tell,” she goes on,
“whether you pay it to him or he pays
it to you.”
“That's a nice state of things,”
you say, becoming indignant. “Surely
you can tell.”
“No, I can't.”
You begin to go over your dark
acquaintances who might owe you
money, and can think of none.
You then think of your dark acquaint-
ances to whom you owe money, and
are horrified at their number.
“Oh, well,” you say, “the whole
thing's rubbish, anyway.”
Little Miss Banks's eyes dilate with
pained astonishment. “Rubbish!"—
and she begins to shuffle again.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXXIII.
(From THEoDoRE RooseVELT, U.S.A.)
It's bully to live in a country where you can say what
you like about the bosses, and that, Sir, is what I've been
doing and mean to go on doing to you. There's no
manner of question about it, you're the biggest boss and
the most dangerous that we in this country have ever come
up against, and if our Government had only got a right
idea of its bounden duty we should have protested against
your conduct, yes, and backed our protest by our deeds
long before this; but the fact is there's too much milk and
water in the blood of some of our big fellows. They whine
when they ought to be up and denouncing, and they crouch
and crawl instead of standing upright like free and fearless
men, and giving the devil's agent the straightest eye-puncher
of which the human arm is capable. I thank Heaven, Sir,
that I'm not made on that plan. I'm out to fight humbug
and hypocrisy, even when they masquerade as friendship
and benevolence; and when I see a fellow coming along
with hundreds of pious texts in his mouth, and his hands
dripping with the blood of innocent women and children,
why, I've got to say what I think of him or die. For my
own part—
“On Bible stilts I don't affect to stalk,
Nor lard with Scripture my familiar talk;
For man may pious texts repeat
And yet religion have no inward seat.”
A man called Hood wrote that nearly eighty years ago, but
it's quite true still. I wonder what he would have written
if he'd had the bad luck to know about you and your dis-
gusting appeals to the Almighty, whom you treat as if He
were always waiting round the corner to be decorated with
the Iron Cross.
Now mind, I don't want you to deceive yourself. If I
dislike you and feel as if I’d sooner kick you than shake
hands with you, it isn't because I'm a peace-at-any-price
man. No man can say that about me without qualifying
for a place within easy reach of ANANIAs; but when I
decide to take part in a scrap—and there's few scraps
going that I don't butt into sooner or later—I like to feel
that I've got a bit of right on my side. But how can you
feel that when you over-run Belgium and burn down
Louvain—that 's the place that made your heart bleed,
bah!—and when you shoot down Belgian hostages and do
to death an English nurse? All that never seems to strike
you. You go on thinking of yourself as a holy, humble
man whom everybody wilfully mistakes for a bully and a
tyrant. Well, you can't fool everybody all the time, you
know, and in this case it happens that everybody has got
some sound horse-sense in his head. Who wanted to hurt
you? You'd put together a great army and your commer-
cial prosperity was a pretty good business proposition.
You'd got a navy and you'd got a very meek and sub-
missive people, which didn't prevent them from being
harsh and domineering and cruel so far as other peoples
were concerned. If you wanted to have folk afraid of you
there were plenty to humour you by pretending to tremble
when you frowned and shook your head. But you weren't
going to be satisfied. You must have a war so as to show
what a great general you were, and you shoved on the old
man FRANCIs Joseph and kept urging him from behind
until everyone got tired by the impossibility of making you
come out fair and square on the side of peace.
Well, you've got your war, and I hope you like it. This
isn't one of your military promenades. This is hard, long
fighting against men whose only wish was to be left alone.
You've forced them to form a trust for the purpose of trust-
busting, and in the end they'll wear you out and have you
beaten to a frazzle in spite of all you can do. You've lost
millions of men and millions of money, and you don't seem
to get on with your final and decisive victory, and you're
still the vainest and the loudest man on earth. Isn't it
just about time you saw yourself as the rest of us see you,
an irritable lime-light hero, whose favourite effort is to sink
a Lusitania and pretend he had to do it because he didn't
think she'd go down, or because there were too many
women and just enough children in the world 2 All I can
say is that I've had more than enough of you.

BEYOND THE LIMIT.
[The German General Staff declares that for air-warfare there
are still lacking international laws of any kind.]
WHEN Peace lured the Powers to her House at the Hague
With promises specious and welcome though vague
Of a time when the terrors of war should lie hid
And the leopard fall headlong in love with the kid,
She drew up a set of Utopian rules
For the guidance of all the best bellicose schools.
Among the more notable schemes that she planned
She fashioned them bounds to their methods on land,
Taught the whole of them, too, how humane they could be
If a scrap should occur, as it might, on the sea
In a word, pruned the pinions of war everywhere
Save the one place that war could fly into—the air.
But the Hun, he forswore what he vowed at her shrine,
And behaved like a fiend on the soil and the brine;
Then he turned to his Zepps, and remarked, “I can fly,
And she never laid down any law for the sky;
Here's a chance for some real dirty work to be done;”
And he did it by simply out-Hunning the Hun.
How to Save Your Teeth.
From the Soldiers and Sailors Dental Aid Fund (43,
Leicester Square), which has done exceptional service during
the War, comes the story of an old lady who applied for a
set of teeth for her soldier grandson. When asked if he
would know how to take care of them, she replied that
she would give him the benefit of her own experience,
having always made it a rule to remove her artificial teeth
at meal times.
Two cuttings from one issue of The Egyptian Mail:—
“TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN RECRUITING.

It certainly does want one; but for the sake of the gaiety
of nations we trust it won't get him.
“With regard to the expeditionary force, the unexampled heroism
and determination of our troops enabled them to establish a foothold
on the tip of the peninsula, but photographs confirm the reports of
eye-witnesses that they were literally holding on by their eyelids to
the positions they had occupied.”—Sunday Times.
And the subsequent abandonment was performed like
winking.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I Forget just how long it is since Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT
united Edwin Clayhanger and Hilda Lessways in the
bonds of matrimony. Time goes so fast these days that l
met them again, and Auntie Hamps, and Maggie, and
Clara, and the rest of the Three Towns company, as after
an enormous interval. They themselves however have
changed in nothing, except perhaps that the habit of
introspection and their phenomenal capacity for self-
astonishment have become more pronounced. “He thought,
‘I am I; this wife is my wife; and if I put one foot before
the other I shall go inevitably forward.' And it seemed to
him stupendous.” I do not say that this is a quotation,
but it represents a habit of mind that is in danger of
growing, upon Edwin especially. He seems never able to
share my own entire confidence in Mr. BENNETT's efficiency
as creator. Of course nothing very much happens in the
course of These Twain (METHUEN). It is simply a study
of conjugal existence in its effect upon character; briefly,
how to be happy though married. In the end Edwin
seems to hit upon a sort of solution with the discovery
that injustice is a natural condition to be accepted rather
than resented. So one leaves the two with some prospect,
a little insecure, of happiness. Needless to say the study
of both Edwin and Hilda is marvellously penetrating and
minute, almost to the point of defeating its own end. I
had, not for the first time with Mr. BENNETT's characters,
a feeling that I knew them too well to have complete belief
in them. They become not portraits but anatomical
diagrams. But for all that the accuracy of his observation
is undeniable. One sees it in those minor personalities of
the tale whom he is content to record from without.
Auntie Hamps, for example, and Clara are two masterpieces
of portraiture. You must read These Twain; but if possible
take time over it.
American improvements are the wonder of the world:
America seems to have the knack of taking hold of old
stuff and turning it into something full of pep and punch.
You remember a play called Hamlet 2 No? Well, there
is a scene in it, rather an impressive scene, where a man
chats with his father's ghost. Mr. Robert W. CHAMBERs,
America's brightest novelist, has taken much the same
idea and put a bit of zip in it. In his latest work, Athalie
(APPLEToN), the heroine, who is clairvoyant, sees the ghost
of the hero's mother, who prevented the hero from marry-
ing her, and cuts it. “A hot proud colour flared in her
cheeks as she drew quietly aside and stood with averted
head to let her pass.” In all my researches in modern
fiction I cannot recall a more dramatic and satisfying
situation. It is, I believe, the first instance on record of a
spectre being snubbed. SHAKSPEARE never thought of any-
thing like that. As regards the other aspects of Athalie,
the book, I cannot see what else a reviewer can say but
that it is written by Mr. CHAMBERs. The world is divided
into those who read every line Mr. CHAMBERs writes, irre-
spective of its merits, and those who would require to be
handsomely paid before reading a paragraph by him. A

`-
million eager shop-girls, school-girls, chorus-girls, factory-
girls and stenographers throughout America are probably
devouring Athalie at this moment. My personal opinion
that the book is a potboiler, turned out on a definite
formula, like all of Mr. CHAMBERs' recent work, to meet a
definite demand, cannot deter a single one of them from
sobbing over it. As for that section of the public which
remembers The King in Yellow and Cardigan, it has long
ago become resigned to Mr. CHAMBERs' decision to take the
cash and let the credit go, and has ceased to hope for a
return on his part to the artistic work of his earlier period,
when he wrote novels as opposed to Best Sellers.
Let me heartily commend to you a book of stories by
doughty penmen turned swordsmen for the period of the
War—A. E. W. MAsoN, of the Manchester Regiment;
A. A. M., of the Royal Warwicks; W. B. MAxwell, Royal
Fusilier; IAN HAY, A. and S. Highlander; CoMPTON MAC-
KENZIE, R.N.; “Q.,” of the T - -
Duke of Cornwall's L.I.;
OLIVER ONIONs, A.S.C.; BARRY
PAIN, R.N.A.S.; and just short
of a dozen others. Published
by Messrs. HoDDER AND
StoughTon, under title, The
Red Cross Story Book, to be
sold for the benefit of The
Times Fund. It's the sort of
book about which even the
most conscientious reviewer
feels he can honestly say
nice things without any too
thorough examination of the
contents. With that thought I
started turning over the pages
casually, but found myself dip-
ping deeper and deeper, until,
becoming entirely absorbed, I
abandoned all pretence of pro-
fessional detachment and had
a thoroughly good time. I
should like to be able to state
that the quality of these stories
of humour, adventure and sen-
timent was uniform, if only for

passages all the same, such as the account of the specially
favourable treatment of officers from Irish regiments,
accorded in all Teutonic seriousness as preparatory to an
invitation to serve in the ranks of Prussia; or the pathetic
incident of the white-haired French priest sent to the cells
for urging his congregation to pray pour nos (imes. No-
where outside the Fatherland, I should imagine, would
prisoners be forbidden to pray even pour nos armes, and
the stupidity of the misunderstanding is typical enough.
The cheerful dignity shown by prisoners under provocation
makes a fine contrast to such pitiful smallness, and of that
this little book is a notable record.
I suppose it would not be possible to travel in the Pacific
without a fountain-pen and a note-book. At all events this
seems a privation from which the staunchest of our literary
adventurers have hitherto shrunk. Do not however regard
this as anything more than a casual observation, certainly
- not as implying any complaint
against so agreeable a volume
as Voyaging in Wild Seas
(MILLS AND Boon). There
must be many among the
| countless admirers of Mr. JACK
LoNDoN who will be delighted
to read this intimate journal
of his travellings in remote
waters, written by the wife
who accompanied him, and
who is herself, as she proves
on many pages, one of the
most enthusiastic of those ad-
mirers. You may say there is
nothing very much in it all,
but just some pleasant sea-
prattle about interesting ports
and persons, and a number of
photographs rather more inti-
mate than those that generally
illustrate the published travel-
book. But the general impres-
sion is jolly. Stevensonians
will be especially curious over
the visit to Samoa, concerning
her first impressions of which

best are excellent, the average is high, and the tenor so
varied as to suit almost any age and taste.
Mr. B. G. O'RoRKE, Chaplain to the Forces, has written
a short account of his experiences in confinement—In The
Hands of the Enemy (LONG MANs). Seeing that he was
allowed, as a minister of religion, unique opportunities of
meeting our officers (though not men of the ranks) shut up
in different fortresses, and particularly because he has been
thoughtful enough to mention many of them by name, his
narrative is one which nobody with near friends now in
Germany can afford to miss. The general reader, on the
other hand, may have to confess to some disappointment,
since the foggy shadow of the Censor, German or English,
still looms over the pages here and there, blotting out the
sensational episodes which we felt we had reason, if
not right, to expect; and if their absence is really due to
Mr. O'RoRKE's steady refusal to indulge us by embellishing
his almost too unvarnished recital the effect is just the same.
Or perhaps the suggestion of flatness is to be ascribed to
the enemy's failure on the whole to treat certain of his
victims in any very extraordinary manner, and if so we
can accept it and be thankful. There are lots of interesting
Mrs. LoNDoN writes: “As the Snark slid along, we began
to exclaim at the magnificent condition of this German
province—the leagues of copra plantation, extending from
the shore up into the mountainous hinterland, thousands
of close-crowded acres of heavy green palms.” This was
in May, 1908. Wailima was at that time the residence of
the German Governor (a desecration since happily re-
moved); but the LONDONs were able to explore the gardens
and peep in at the rooms whose planning STEVENSoN had
so enjoyed. Later of course they climbed to the lonely
mountain grave of “the little great man"—a phrase oddly
reminiscent of one in an unpublished letter of RUPERT BRooKE
(about the same expedition) that I had just been reading.
Mrs. LoNDON deserves our thanks for letting us share so
interesting a holiday in these restricted days.

GET UP A HOLY WAR
(GERMAN STYLE).
[The Special Correspondent of The Times at Salonica states that
“among the documents examined at the Consulate of his Catholic
and Apostolic Majesty of Austria are 1,500 copies of a long proclama-
tion in Arabic to the Chiefs of the Senussis, inciting them to a Holy
War on non-Germanic Christendom.” The proclamation purports to
be composed by one of the Faithful, but “its pseudo-Oriental wording
clearly betrays its Germanic authorship.”]
IN Allah's name, Senussis! Allah's name!
Please note the Holy War that we proclaim
High at the main we hoist our sacred banner
(Forgive my pseudo-Oriental manner);
For now the psychologic Tag has come
To put the final lid on Christendom,
Always excepting that peculiar part
Which has the hopes of Musulmans at heart.
For lo! this noble race (its Chief has said it;
Else would it seem almost too good to credit),
Prompted by generous instincts, undertakes
To waive its scruples and for your sweet sakes,
Indifferent to private gain or loss,
To help the Crescent overthrow the Cross.
HOW TO
Christians they are, I own, this Teuton tribe,
Yet not too Christian. I could here inscribe
A tale of feats performed with pious hands
On those who crossed their path in Christian lands
Which, even where Armenia kissed his rod,
Would put to shame The Very Shadow of God.
You must not therefore feel a pained surprise
At having Christian dogs for your allies;
For there are dogs and dogs; and, though the base
Bull terrier irks you, 'tis a different case
When gentle dachshunds jump to your embrace.
If crudely you remark: “A holy win
May suit our friends, but where do we come in 2"
My answer is: “Apart from any boom
Islam secures by sealing England's doom,
We shall, if we survive the coming clash,
Collect papyrus notes in lieu of cash;
And, if we perish, as we may indeed,
We have a goodly future guaranteed,
With houris waiting in Valhalla's pile"
(Pardon my pseudo-Oriental style).
These are the joys, of which I give the gist,
Secured to those who trust the KAISER's fist,
Which to the infidel is hard as nails
Or eagles' claws whereat the coney quails,
But to the Faithful, such as you, Senussis,
Is softer than the velvet paws of pussies. O. S.
From a story in The Glasgow Herald:—
“‘He had his feathers ruffled that time, anyway,” laughed my
husband, as he followed me whistling into the house.”
It isn't every woman that has a husband who can talk
and laugh and whistle all at once. Was he the clever
man in the French tale, we wonder, who chanted a Scottish
air, accompanying himself on the bag-pipes?

NAUTICAL TERMS FOR ALL.
(By our Tame Naval Erpert.)
It is really surprising what confusion exists in the public
mind upon the exact significance of such elementary terms
as “Command of the Sea,” and “A Fleet in Being.” Only
yesterday evening I was asked by a fellow-traveller on the
top of a i. why, if we had command of the sea, we didn't
blow up the Kiel Canal'
It will be as well to begin at the beginning. What is
Naval Warfare? It is an endeavour by sea-going belligerent
units, impregnated (for the time being) with a measure of
animus pugmandi and furnished with offensive weapons, to
impose their will upon one another. In rather more techni-
cal language it may be described as fighting in ships.
Now in order to utilize the sea for one's own purposes
and at the same time to deny, proscribe, refuse and restrict
it to one's enemy it is essential to obtain comMAND. And
it must not be overlooked that Command of the Sea can
only be established in one way—by utilizing or threatening
to utilize sea-going belligerent units. But we must dis-
tinguish between Command of the Sea and Sea Supremacy,
and again between Potential Command, Putative Command
and Absolute Command. Finally let there be no confusion
between the expressions “Command of the Sea” and
“Control of the Sea,” which are entirely different things
—though both rest securely upon the doctrine of the
Fleet in Being, which is at the foundation of all true
strategy. -
This brings us to the question of what is meant by the
phrase “A Fleet in Being.” “To Be or Not to Be" (in Being)
is a phrase that has been woefully misinterpreted, especially
by those who insist on a distinction between Being and
Doing. There is no such distinction at sea. For a fleet
to exist as a recognisable instrument is not necessarily for
it to be in Being. Only by exhibiting a desire to dispute
Command at all costs can a fleet be said to come into
Being. On the other hand, by being in Being a fleet does not
necessarily obtain command or even partial control. This
is not simply a question of To Be or Not to Be (in Being).
In explaining these academic principles one always runs
the risk of being confronted with concrete instances. I
shall be asked, “Is the German Fleet in Being 2" I can
only reply that it is in a condition of strictly Limited
Control (I refer to the Kiel Canal), while the Baltic is in
Disputed Command so long as the Russian Fleet is
Strategically at Large.
This brings us to the question of the phrase “Strategic-
ally at Large,” which has been loosely rendered “On the
War-path.” Let us say rather that any fleet (in Being)
which is ready (even without Putative Control) to dispute
Command is said to be Strategically at Large, so long as it
is imbued with animus pugmandi.
Animus pugnandi is the root of the matter. A fleet is
in a state of disintegration without it. And so long as the
German Fleet's activities in the North Sea are confined to
peeping out of the Canal to see if the foe is in the neigh-
bourhood one must conclude that this ingredient has been
overlooked in its composition. BIs.

THE BATTLE OF JOBEY.
JANUARY, 1916, will ever be remem-
bered as the eventful month in which
the oldest men in England turned aside
from all their other pursuits and dis-
regarded the state of Europe in order
to take part in the Battle of Jobey.
Their battle-ground was the columns of
The Times, and no one was too proud
or venerable to fight. Peers, bishops,
deans, statesmen, baronets, knights—
all rushed in, and still no one quite
knows the result. How many Jobeys
were there? we still ask ourselves. Did
anyone really know the first Jobey, or
was there only an ancestral Jobey
back in the days of Edward VI. 2 How
old was the dynasty 2 Was Jobey Levi’
Was Jobey Powell? Was Jobey short
and fat? Was Jobey tall and thin 2
What did Jobey sell ? What did Jobey
do 2
To begin with, what was the casus
belli 2 No one can remember. But
some old Etonian, reminiscing, had the
effrontery to believe that the Jobey to
whom, in his anecdotage, he referred,
who sold oranges at the gate or blew up
footballs or performed other jobicular
functions, was the only Jobey. That
was enough. Instantly in poured
other inſuriated old Etonians, also in
anecdotage, to pit their memories
against his. Everything was forgotten
in the struggle: the KAISER's illness,
Sir IAN HAMILTON's despatch, the
Compulsion Bill, the Quakers and their
consciences, the deficiencies of the
Blockade. Nothing existed but Jobey.
All the letters, however, were not
printed, and some of those that escaped
The Times have fallen into our own
hand. We give one or two:-
SIR, - Your Correspondents are
wrong. Jobey was a fat red man,
with a purple nose and a wooden leg.
I am, Yours ſaithfully, NEston.
SIR,-My recollection of Jobey is
exact. He was a fat man with a hook
instead of a left hand, and he stood at
least six feet six inches high. No one
could mistake him.
I am, Obediently yours,
METHUSELAH PARR.
SIR,-Jow ETT, though not an Etonian
himself, was greatly interested in anec-
dotes of Jobey related to him by Eton-
ian undergraduates in the “sixties,”
and on one occasion, when he was the
guest of the Headmaster, he was intro-
duced to the famous factotum, who
instructed him in the art of blowing up
footballs, and presented him with a
was larger and far redder than that of
the Master's. I have given a fuller
account of the interview in my Balliol
Memories, Vol. iii., pp. 292-5, but may
content myself with saying here that
the two eminent men parted with
mutual respect.
I am, Sir, Yours faithfully,
LEMUEL LONG MIRE.
SIR,--I wish to point out that “My
Tutor's '' is hopelessly wrong in think-
ing that his Jobey is the real Jobey.
Looking through my diary for June,
1815, I find this entry:-
“News of Waterloo just received.
Jobey, who has charge of all the
cricket implements and is gener-
ally the custodian of the playing
fields, monstrously drunk, on the
ground of having won the battle.”
This conclusively proves that there
was a Jobey before the old fellow who
has just died aged 85. But how any-
one can be interested in people aged
only 85, I cannot conceive, My own
age is 118, and I am still in possession
of an exact memory and a deadly diary.
I remain, Sir, Yours truly,
JohN BARCHESTER.
SIR,-Although in my hundred-and-
fiftieth year I can still recollect my
school days with crystal clearness, and
it pains me to find a lot of young
Etonians claiming to have had dealings
with the original Jobey. The original
Jobey died in 1827, and I was at his
funeral. He was then a middle-aged
man of 93. When I was at Eton in
1776-1783, he stood with his basket
opposite “Grim's,” and if any of us
reſused to buy he gave us a black eye.
Discipline was lax in those days, but
we were all the better for it. On
Jobey's death a line of impostors no
doubt was established, trying to profit
by the great name; but none of these
can be called the original Jobey, except
under circumstances of the crassest
ignorance or folly.
I am, Yours, etc., SENEx.
SIR,--It is tolerably obvious that
your correspondent “Drury's " is
suffering from hallucinations of the
most virulent type. Marina debetur
pueris reverentia is all very well, but
facts are facts. There may have been
many pseudo-Jobeys, but the real
original was born in the year of the
Great Fire of London and died in 1745.
He was already installed in the reign
of WILLIAM III., and was the first to
introduce Blenheim oranges to the
Etonian palate. He was an under-
blood orange, which Jow ETT religiously sized man, about five feet, five inches
preserved for many years in a glass- high, with a pale face and hooked nose
case in his study.
In features they and always wore a woollen muffler,
were curiously alike, but Jobey's nose, which we called “Jobey's comforter.”
To represent him as belonging to the
Victorian age is an anachronism cal-
culated to make the angels weep.
I am, Sir, Yours everlastingly,
MELCHISEDER PoNToPPIDAN.
A MOTHER TO AN EMPEROR.
I MADE him mine in pain and fright,
The only little lad I’d got,
And woke up aching night by night
To mind him in his baby cot;
And, whiles, I jigged him on my
knee
And sang the way a mother sings,
Seeing him wondering up at me
Sewing his little things,
And never gave a thought to wars and
kings.
I heard his prayers or smacked him
good,
And watched him learning miles
ahead
Of all his mother ever could,
Roughing my hands to set him
bread;
And when he was a man I tried
Not to forget as he was grown,
And didn't keep him close beside
All for my very own—
And meanwhiles you was brooding on
your throne.
And now He wouldn't wait no
more,

Dear Old Lady. “HAve You Two MEN BEEN AT THE FRONT 2 ''

THE GRAND Tour.
I ALWAYS wished to see the world—I 'ad no chanst before,
Nor I don't suppose I should 'ave if there 'adn't been no war;
I used to read the tourist books, the shippin' news also,
An' I 'ad the chance o' goin', so I couldn't 'elp but go.
We 'ad a spell in Egypt first, before we moved along
Acrost the way to Suvla, where we got it 'ot an' strong;
We 'ad no drink when we was dry, no rest when we was
tired, -
But I’ve seen the Perramids an’ Spink, which I 'ad oft
desired.
I've what'll last me all my life to talk about an' think;
I've sampled various things to eat an' various more to drink;
I've strolled among them dark bazaars, which makes the
pay to fly -
(An' I 'ad my fortune told as well, but that was all my eye).
I've seen them little islands too—I couldn't say their
nannes—
An' towns as white as
flames; -
I've seen the sun come lonely up on miles an' miles o' sea:
Why, folks 'ave paid a 'undred pound an' seen no more
than me.

The sky is some'ow bluer there—in fact, I never knew
As any sun could be so 'ot or any sky so blue;
There's figs an’ dates an' suchlike things all 'angin' on the
trees,
An' black folks walkin' up an' down as natural as you please.

Why, it's worth the bloomin' bundle to be comin' 'ome

In delicate position, Bos AR

excellent taste, unerring tact.
He did not disguise fact that
as a Unionist his sympathies
were with the Amendment.
But he insisted that more
would be lost than gained
by trying to enforce Military
Service on country divided
upon the question.
“To anyone who knows the
history of Ireland,” he said,
“who knows the history in
our own lifetime, and the

one who recalls the state of

ing Ireland across floor of the House.

Once upon a time, not so far back,
there was an Irish Member who, on his
triumphant return to Westminster, took
the oath and his seat at 4 o'clock in

Ivor HERBERT had moved

“Not at all, Mrs. Flanagan, not at

mostly Irish. Ye see, th’Army has to
be fed, and the threnches has to be
claned and drained, and so on, and the
English does the cookin' and clanin'
for the Irish. But anny fightin' that's
done is done be th' Irish riginints, as
is well known to be the best fighters

'tis like this. Furst of all there was

me all about it. Over there, there was
no inlistin' as there was over here.
Shure, in Dublin alone we have three
recruitin' offices, to say nothin' of th’

isn't a sowl lift in the city, and what

thin' like a sling, so, whin a man was

look you here, ivery time a group was

rate of the rank and file I have acquaintance
with here in Gaul) that it est omnia in duo

Morning Paper.
CESAR's commentary on this would be
worth reading.
TRUTHFUL JAMEs. . .
THE Staff of The Muddleton Weekly
Gazette, having disguised himself as an
ordinary citizen, entered the local hos-
pital in quest of copy. His keen eye
immediately singled out a man of
solemn, careworn aspect, and to him
he directed his footsteps. Two clear
grey eyes, looked into his, and his
greeting was answered politely, though
without enthusiasm. Then, exerting
all the skill and adroitness which had
marked him out for forty years as a
coming man in the journalistic world,
the visitor put the soldier gradually at
his ease and tactfully induced him to
recount his experiences. . ;
“I could tell you lots of things what
would astonish you, Sir,” began the
convalescent. “Six months in the
trenches gives you plenty of time to
pick up tales—and invent them, too;
but I don't hold with that. A little
exaggeration helps things along, as old
Wolff says, but when he goes beyond
I'm not with him. No lies—not for
Truthful James. That's me, Sir. They
call me that in B Company; James
being the name what my godfathers
and godmothers give me, and Truthful
being as you might say an identification
mark.”
The other nodded and waited in
silence.
“Nothing much happened to me for
the first three months, but then we was
moved further South and a new Sub.
joined us. Name of Williamson. Do
you know him, Sir? Second-Lieuten-
ant J. J. C. de W. Williamson was his
full war paint. Ah, it's a pity you
don't. Quite a kid he was, but he
could tell you off as free and flowing as
a blooming General, and never repeat
himself for ten minutes. He stirred
things up considerable—specially the
enemy. Sniping was his game; two
hours regular every morning, with a
Sergeant to spot for him and a Corporal
to bring him drinks at intervals of ten
minutes to keep him cool. He kept
count of the Huns he had outed by
notches on the post of his dug-out.
Every time he rang the bell he'd cut
up a notch, and before he'd been with
us a month you could have used that
post as a four-foot saw.
“Naturally the Huns were riled.
You see, we was a salient and they was
a salient, and there wasn't more than a
hundred yards between us. We could
hear them eating quite plainly, when
they had anything to eat, and when
they hadn't they smoked cigars which
smelt worse than all the gas they ever
squirted. One day the Sub, strolls up
for his morning practice and sees a
huge sign above the enemy trench:
‘Don't shoot. We are Saxons.' They
had relieved the Prussians and they
was moving about above their trenches
as free as a Band of Hope Saturday
excursion. - .
“‘Until anyone proves the contrary,'
says our Sub., ‘I maintain that Saxons
is Germans. Moreover, says he, war
is war,’ and he had to cut up three
more notches on his post afore he could
make them understand that his attitude
was hostile. When they did grasp it
they began to strafe us, and they kep' it
up hard all day. When night come our
Sub. decided he'd had enough. ‘Boys,' he
says to us, ‘one hour before the crimson
sun shoots forth his flaming rays from
out of the glowing East them Germans
is going to be shifted from that trench.
We ain't a-going to make a frontal
attack,' he says, “because some of us
might have the misfortune to tear our
tunics on the enemy entanglements,
and housewives is scarce. We are
going to crawl along that hollow on the
flank and enfilade the blighters.”
“So we puts a final polish on our
bainets and waits. Bimeby we starts
out, Sergeant leading the way. We
wriggled through the mud like Wapping
eels at low tide for the best part of an
hour, and at last we got to their trench
and halted to listen. There wasn't a
sound to be heard; nobody snoring,
nobody babbling of beer in his sleep;
only absolute silence. Sergeant was
lying next to me and I distinctly heard
his heart miss several beats. Then all
at once we leaps into the air, gives a
yell fit to make any German wish he'd
never been born, and falls into their
trench, doing bainet drill like it would
have done your heart good to see. But
we stops it as quick as we begun, be-
cause there wasn't a single man in that
trench. Not one, Sir. -
“After a awkward pause, “The birds
have flown,' says our Sub., sorrowful
like, as if he'd asked some friends to
dinner and the cat had eat the meat.
“‘I think, Sir," says Sergeant, ‘that
they've abandoned this trench as being
untenable, and probably left a few
mines behind for us.' I didn't like that.
I thought our trench was a much
nicer trench in every way, and I felt it
was time to think of going back, when
suddenly we hears a norrible yell come
up from our trenck and sounds of
blokes jumping about. Yes, Sir, the
Germans had made an attack on our
trench at the same time, only they had
gone round by the other flank, where
there was some trees to help them.
“So there they was in our trench,
and we in theirs, and dawn just be-
ginning to break. There was only one
thing to do. We went back, hoping
they would wait for us; but they hopped

so we finished up just as we was when
we started, except for mud. Our Sub.

“DULCE ET DECORUM.”
O YouNG and brave, it is not sweet to die,
To fall and leave no record of the race,
A little dust trod by the passers-by,
Swift feet that press your lonely resting-place; ,
Your dreams unfinished, and your song unheard—
Who wronged your youth by such a careless word?
All life was sweet—veiled mystery in its smile;
High in your hands you held the brimming cup;
Love waited at your bidding for a while,
Not yet the time to take its challenge up;
Across the sunshine came no faintest breath
To whisper of the tragedy of death. .
And then, beneath the soft and shining blue,
Faintly you heard the drum's insistent beat;
The echo of its urgent note you knew,
The shaken earth that told of marching feet;
With quickened breath you heard your country's call,
And from your hands you let the goblet fall.
You snatched the sword, and answered as you went,
For fear your eager feet should be outrun,
And with the flame of your bright youth unspent
Went shouting up the pathway to the sun.
O valiant dead, take comfort where you lie.
So sweet to live? Magnificent to die!
THE LECTURE.
“Francesca,” I said, “will you do me—I mean, will you
accept a favour from me?”
“If,” she said, “your Majesty deigns to grant one there
can be no question of my accepting it. It will fall on me
and I shall have to submit to it.” -
“Well,” I said, “it’s this way. You know I'm going to
—a-hem —deliver a lecture at Faringham next Monday ?”
“I gathered,” she said, “that you were up to something
from the amount of books you were piling up on your
writing-table. Besides you've been complaining of the ink
a good deal, and that's always a bad sign.”
“Hadn't I mentioned Faringham and the lecture?”
“You had distantly alluded to something impending and
you had looked at the A.B.C. several times, but it stopped
at that.”
“How careless of me!” I said.
you all about it.”
“You didn't make your meaning clear. It's all part of
the secretiveness of men. They tell one nothing and
then they're offended if we don't anticipate all their
movements.”
“We will,” I said, “let that pass. It is an unjust
remark, but I will not retaliate. Anyhow, I now inform
you formally and officially that I am going to Faringham
on Monday in order to deliver a lecture on “Poetry in its
Relation to Life,' before the Faringham Literary Association.
It is one of the most famous Associations in the world and
has a large lecture-hall capable of seating one thousand
people comfortably.”
“But why,” she said, “did they ask you to lecture?”
“They must,” I said, “have heard of me somewhere and
guessed that I had wonderful latent capacities as a lecturer.
Some men have, you know.”
“Well,” she said, “let’s hope you're one of that sort,
and that you'll bring all your capacities out on Monday.
Aren't you nervous?”
“No,” I said, “not exactly nervous; but I shall be glad
when it's well over.”
“I know I meant to tell
“So shall I,” she said, “The ink will be gradually
getting better now, and there won't be so many troubles
about the A.B.C. being mislaid.”
“No book,” I said, “was ever so much mislaid as that.
I put it down on the sofa two minutes ago and it has now
vanished completely.”
“It has flown to the window-seat,” she said.
“Ah,” I said, “and if we give it two minutes more it
will fly into the dining-room.”
“Never mind,” she said; “there shall be A.B.C.'s in
every room till you depart for Faringham. That's poetry.”
“But it has no relation to life,” I said. “It is not
sincere, as all true poetry must be.”
“At this point,’” she said in a quoting voice, “‘the
lecturer was much affected, and his audience showed their
sympathy with him by loud cheers.' Will there be much
of that sort of thing 2"
“There will be a good deal of it,” I said with dignity.
“The lecture is to last for an hour exactly.”
“A whole hour?” she said. “Isn't that taking a mean
advantage of the Faringham people?”
“They,” I said, “can go out if they like, but I must go
on. Francesca, may I read the lecture to you, so as to see
if I've got it the right length 2"
“So that's what you've been driving at,” she said.
“Well, fire away—no, stop till I've fetched the children in.
You'll have a better audience with them.”
“Need those innocent ones suffer 2 ” I said.
“They are young,” she said, “and must learn to endure.”
The consequence was that all the four children, from
Muriel aged sixteen, to Frederick aged eight, were fetched
in and told they were going to have a treat such as few
children had ever had ; that they were going to hear a
lecture on “Poetry in its Relation to Life”; that they
must cheer loudly every now and then, but not interrupt
otherwise, and that there would be a chocolate for each of
them at the end. In addition Frederick was told that if
he felt he really couldn't stand any more of it he was to
leave the room very quietly, and that this wouldn't interfere
with the chocolate. Thereupon the lecture started. At the
end of the seventh minute Frederick rose, bent his body
double and tiptoed out of the room. He was a great loss,
for, as Muriel remarked afterwards, he represented two
hundred of the audience of a thousand. The rest, however,
stuck it out heroically, and danced for joy when it came to
an end in one hour exactly. Frederick was afterwards
discovered writing poetry on his own account in the school-
room. As an illustration of the far-reaching influence of
a lecture I may cite two of his stanzas:—
Summer is coming,
Then the bees will be humming,
Birds will be flying,
And girls will be buying,
And boys will be running;
Oh, hail Summer is coming.
Summer is coming,
Then the fox will be cunning,
And all will be glad,
And none will be sad,
And I hope none will be mad,
And I hope none will be bad;
Oh, hail Summer is coming !
This may be premature and, as to the fox, incorrect,
since he requires but little cunning in the summer; but
there is a good BRowNING flavour about it which redeems
all errors. . R. C. L.

[JANUARY 26, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I am like Mr. JAcobs' Night Watchman; it's very hard
to deceive me. I had read only a few pages of Miss UNA
SILBERRAD's The Mystery of Barnard Hanson (HUTCHINson)
when I guessed who had done the murder. Unfortunately,
when I had read a few pages more, I found that I had
picked the wrong person. Then I accused another charac-
ter on perfectly good circumstantial evidence, and he was
not the man. After that I decided to withdraw from the
detective business and let Miss SILBERRAD unravel her
mystery for herself. If you are of the opinion that a woman
cannot keep a secret read The Mystery of Barnard Hanson
and become convinced that Miss SILBERRAD at least is an
exception. If I have ever read a more perfectly sustained
mystery novel I cannot recall it. There is just a chance
that in the last few pages you may get on the right track,
but, if you are honest with yourself, you will have to admit
that you did it simply by a process of elimination, after
you had made an ass of your- | -
self and arrested every innocent
person in the book on suspicion.
I think it is Miss SILBERRAD's
manner that throws the de-
tective reader out of his stride.
She is so detached. She con-
veys the impression that she
herself is just as puzzled as you
are, and that, for all she knows,
Barnard Hanson may have been
murdered by somebody who is
not in the book at all. In other
words she gives her story just
that reality which a murder
mystery has when unfolded day
by day in the papers. I confess
that, when I unwrapped the
book and found that a polished
artist like Miss SILBERRAD had
written a detective story, I was
a little shocked; but I need
not have been. There are no 2 A.2.2
dummies in this novel. Each --- *_2

as if delineation of character

from which Great Britain emerged as a united kingdom.
Wales was a hot-bed of rebellion, Scotland the “plague-
spot of the North,” the Cinque Ports on the verge of going
over to France. Only a strong man, with strong men
under him, could have saved England then. Morlac of
Gascony is not the easy reading which many people insist
on in novels which deal with the past, and for this reason
it may not be so popular as some historical novels of far
less merit; but if you are prepared to make something of
an effort to carry the trenches of the earlier portion of the
story you will have your reward.
I suppose that what a CRAwFoRD doesn't know about
Roman society may fairly be dismissed as negligible.
Therefore the name of J. CRAWFoRD FRASER (in associa-
tion with Mrs. HUGH FRASER) on the title-page of Her
Italian Marriage (HUTCHINsoN) is a sufficient guarantee
-- - 2 that the local colour at least will
be the genuine article. And it
happens that the scheme of the
tale, the union between a Roman
of the old nobility and an Ameri-
can girl, makes the local colour
of special significance. It was
just this matter of doing as the
Romans do that Elsie Trant
found at first one of life's little
difficulties. There is a very
pleasant scene of the dinner-
party at which she was form-
ally presented to her husband's
family; the contrast in atmo-
spheres between that of the
new-risen West and that of the
|severely Papal circles to which
|Prince Pietro belonged being
suggested most happily. I wish,
though, the authors had been
content to leave it at that, as
a social comedy about pleasant
people getting to understand
one another. In an ill-inspired
moment, however, they decided
to have a dramatic plot, and
truth compels me to say that
of the cruder public which makes murder novels its staple
diet.
In her preface to Morlac of Gascony (HUTchissos) Mrs.
STEP.NEY RAwson apologizes for producing an historical
novel in these days when the present rather than the
past is occupying people's minds. But a good historical
novel is never really untimely, and Morlac of Gascony is
not only well written but deals with a period of English
history not often exploited by the historical novelist—the
days of Edward THE FIRST, when the future of England as
a naval power rested on the energy and determination of
the sailors of the Cinque Ports. Although Jehan Moriac,
the young Gascon, is the principal character in the story
the most arresting figure is that of Edward himself, as
dexterous a piece of character-drawing as I have come upon
in historical fiction for some time. The plot is cleverly
constructed to throw a high light on one of the most inter-
esting personalities in the history of the English monarchy.
We see Edward as a young man, wild, reckless and brutal;
then, grown to his full powers and sobered by responsi-
bility, making by sheer force of character something abiding
and coherent out of the strange welter of warring factions

- this is a dreary affair, tricked
out with such dust-laden devices as secret marriages,

person who alternately is and isn't the rightful Prince, as
we delve deeper into the revelations. Finally, if I followed
the intrigue correctly, the long arm of coincidence brought
it about that Elsie's mother was the eloping wife of Pietro's
uncle. Frankly, all this bored me, because we readers
could have been so much more profitably engaged in
renewing our Roman memories under such expert guidance.

may not share. =

[FEBRUARY 2, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS.
XXXIV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, We're having
a great time with our new arrival, one
of those confounded civilians, who are
only let into the business because the
business, in these modern and highly
complicated days, cannot be carried
on without them. He's a jolly old
Lieutenant of about fifty years; he
has a concentrated experience of the
world but doesn't remember having
been mixed up in a big European war
before. At first I kept on telling him
that business is one thing and war is
another, but he wouldn't see it and
persisted in doing and saying and
thinking things which were bound to
land us in a national disaster. He
had no respect whatever for the Pass
Memo., his central and sole idea being
to push along with the elimination of
the Bosch. When he wanted some-
thing done, he just went to the Top-
man of the department, called him “I
say,” and went straight to the point.
The Top-man had never been asked to
do business this way before.
He put up with it a dozen times or
so, but finally he had to take steps.
So he wrote a little note on a Buff
slip and addressed it, very rightly of
course, to the Top-man but one ; and
the Top-man but one read it and passed
it very carefully to the Top-man but
two ; and so, with that inevitability
which is the hall-mark of the system,
it was passed and passed and passed
until it came (in less than a week) to
the office of the ancient Lieutenant on
the opposite side of the street. And it
ran : “Lieutenant So-and-So should
be notified that it is neither necessary
nor desirable that he should call
personally at this office to transact
his business. Matters should be put
forward by him through the usual
course of correspondence.” The ancient
Lieutenant, who wouldn't hurt any-
body's feelings for the world, felt that
it was up to him to put the matter
right. So he stepped. across to the
Top-man's office, and when the Top-
man asked him, somewhat pointedly,
if he had received his note, the Ancient
very genially replied, “Yes, thank you,”
and explained that he had just looked
in personally to acknowledge receipt of
Sallic.
It sounds as if a dreadful quarrel
would be raging between the Ancient
on one side and on the other the Top-
man, the whole series of under-Top-
men and all persons in any way repre-
senting the military system You'd
expect to hear that the Ancient's con-
versation at mess is insubordinate,
rebellious, or at least bitterly sarcastic.
No such thing; the old gentleman
becomes a more ardent militarist every
day; wants to see once for all an end
of all lawyer-politicians, and all so-
called “business-men.” “We have
made a poor show of being civilians,”
is his point; “let’s try being soldiers
for a generation or two.”
On the whole he thinks we should
find it easier to carry on as a British
Empire in uniform than as a German
province in mufti. He says that
what's wrong with Prussian Mili-
tarism is that it is Prussian ; to
succeed, the thing has to be run by
gentlemen.
A Top-man honoured our mess the
other night. Under the mellowing in-
fluence of our Curried Bully he unbent
somewhat and encouraged the Ancient
on his pet subject. Under the influence
of the latter's theories he unbent still
further. He discoursed upon the true
inwardness of the military methcd of
running an office, pausing at last for
the Ancient to say a few words. “Oh,”
said he, “I don't allow myself to be
put off by a trifle like that. There's
many a kind heart behind a Buff slip,
and we all have our little weaknesses.”
The idea of having a little weakness
was so novel to the Top-man that it
caused him to choke and to be led
from the mess, eventually, in a state of
nervous exhaustion.
The latest information from the
trenches goes to support the maxim
that all one requires to wage war is a
bold face and a gas helmet. A very
distinguished O.C. went up the other
day to inspect the trenches of his com-
mand and to express such views of their
faults and the faults of their inmates
as might occur to him from time to
time. He had progressed some way
up the communication trench, when
it struck him that, whereas his recent
order had been particularly menacing
to everyone of whatever rank who was
discovered there or thereabouts without
a gas helmet, nevertheless he himself
was at that moment innocent of such
furniture. Fortunately there came from
the opposite direction an odds-and-end
private, with nothing in his favour
except the wearing of the well-known
satchel so much in vogue in Flanders
society for the carrying of gas helmets.
That was enough for the Commander;
this was essentially one of those pri-
vates to be called “My man,” and
treated as such. Politely but firmly
he was requested to part with his
satchel as a temporary loan to his
General. Firmly, if respectfully, le
refused to comply. Them was his
orders. The Commander congratulated
him on his very proper attitude, ex-
plained to him the nature of the higher
commands and demanded the satchel.
The man looked like being stony
about it, but the Commander became
irresistibly commanding and got the
satchel at last. He buckled it on, and
the party proceeded, characterising the
reluctance of the private to part with
his treasure as almost an exaggerated
sense of obedience to printed orders.
Gas helmets always exercise a pecu-
liar fascination for people who inspect
trenches, and the matter was now espec-
ially prominent in the mind of the Com-
mander as he marched along, outwardly
appearing to be at his happiest here,
inwardly thanking goodness that his
home was elsewhere. Conceive his
delight to discover a subaltern, fresh
from ablutions, with no satchel upon
him The subaltern, distinctly aware
of this amongst his many failings, was
all for being passed by as insignificant;
the Commander was all for a scene.
Everybody halted, and the air became
pregnant with possibilities . . . It was
a nicely calculated speech, leading up
gradually to the pointed contrast be-
tween (a) overworked Commander,
weighed down with responsibilities,
absorbed day and night in momentous
matters of large principle, nevertheless
infallible on smallest detail and now
in possession of gas helmet, one, and
(b) very junior subaltern, free to enjoy
the open-air irresponsible life of the
trenches, yet neglecting even the few
small matters entrusted to him, with-
out same.
“And what's more, Sir," he concluded,
“I doubt very much whether, if some-
one gave you a helmet now, you'd know |
what to do with it. Here, take mine.”
(The attendant Brass-hats liked the
“mine,” but very discreetly kept their
emotions to themselves.) -
It was not a peculiarly clean or re-
markably well-packed satchel which
the trembling hand of the disgraced
subaltern took from the Commander,
and the latter did not intend to let
attention dwell too long upon the grimy
details of its exterior. Fixing the steel
eye of conscicus rectitude on his victim,
he leant slightly towards him and very
unmistakably shouted at him the one
dread word, “GAs." ". . . Unfortunately
for the Commander the subaltern not
only knew what to do next, but also
had just the physical strength remain-
ing in his fingers to start doing it.
With the eyes of all upon him (and by
this time there had gathered round
quite a nice little crowd, thoroughly
conversant with the event in progress),
the subaltern opened the satchel alleged
to belong to the Commander and took
from it—no, Charles, not a gas helmet,
but a pair of sccks—and such socks too!
Yours ever, HENRY.

THE MISFIRE.
WHEN I entered the third smoker
there was, as there now always is, a
soldier in one corner.
Just as we were starting, another
soldier got in and sat in the opposite
corner. The freemasonry of Khaki

yet left England and was
stolid; the newcomer had
been in the trenches, had
been wounded in the leg,
had recovered, was shortly
going back, and was ani-
mated. His leg was all
right, except that in wet
weather it ached. In fact
he could even tell by it
when we were going to
have rain. His “blooming
barometer’’ he called it.
Here he laughed—a hearty
laugh, for he was a genial
blade and liked to hear him-
self talk. t
The first soldier did not
laugh, but was interested.
He thought it a convenient
thing to have a leg that
foretold the weather.
“Which one is it?” he
asked.
“The left.”
The first soldier was dis-
proportionately impressed.,
“The left, is it?” he said
heavily, as though he would
have understood the phe-
momenon in the right easily
enough. “The left.” |
Completely unconscious
of the danger-signals, the
second soldier now began
to unload his repertory of -
stories, and he started off with that excel-
lent one, very popular in the early days
of the War, about the wealthy private.
For the sake of verisimilitude he laid
the scene in his own barracks. “A
funny thing happened at our place the
other day,” he began. He had evi-
dently had great success with this story.

unsuspicious, wholly undeterred.
In the far corner I kept my eye on
my book but my ears open. I could
see that he was rushing to his doom.
“We were being paid,” he went on,
“and the quartermaster asked one of

“‘I don't think I'll send it. You see,
I allow her four thousand a year as it
is.'”
The raconteur laughed loudly and
leaned back with the satisfaction—or
at least some of it—of one who has
told a funny story and told it well.
But the other did not laugh at all.
His face remained the dull thing it was.
“You see,” said the story-teller,
explaining the point, “there are all
sorts in the Army now, and this man
was a toff. He was so rich that he
could afford to allow his wife four
thousand pounds a year. Four thou-

PUNCH,
THE FAUNA OF THE FRONT.
CHIEF among the fauna of the Front
is, of course, the Bosch, a subterranean
animal of unpleasant habits, which is
now classed as vermin. He has been
so thoroughly dealt with elsewhere
that I shall leave him on one side, and
confine my few observations to smaller
and pleasanter creatures. The remain-
ing fauna of the Front are (1) mice;
(2) rats; with a few interesting extras,
furred and feathered, which deserve
more serious treatment than I can give
them.
At home the mouse is regarded
with contemptuous annoyance as a
petty but persevering thief; while the
rat commits his grosser depredations
in an atmosphere tinged with horror.
Out here it is different, for we are
perforce neighbours. Indeed, we bipeds
are in a sense trespassers upon the
domain of the subterranean peoples.
At home one seldom sees a rat or
mouse save from above, and to look
down upon anything is invariably to
misjudge it. But here we share the
hospitality of the underground and
meet its freehold tenants on a level.
From the earth walls of the sanctuary
where this small tribute is written
mice look down upon our table with
its newspaper cover, diffidently waiting
for us to finish our meal and permit
them to dine. We regard them as shy
visitors—though are we not billeted on
them 2–not as sneaking thieves, and
by the light of our candles perceive
how sleek, bright-eyed, neat-handed
and agile they are. In one dug-out I
know a certain mouse who will drop
on your shoulder ard sit there a while
in the friendliest manner, trying in
his tiny modest way to play the host.
Up above, in the open air, they are to
be seen in swarms sharing our watch-
fulness. This gun-shaken valley is
honeycombed with their little round
funk-holes, into which they flash at
any sudden noise. It is merely going
downstairs where we are all at home.
The social instincts of the rat are
less highly developed. His visible visits
to the mess are rarer, but we overhear
his conversation in his tunnels that
open on our shelves, the patter of his
pink feet across the canvas overhead,
and the muscular squirming of his body
in some tight place about the sandbag
wainscot. Like a friendly dog he trots
about your dug-out by night, bumping
with trustful carelessness against the
fragile legs of your rustic bed. You
hear him crooning to himself or a pal,
in his content—a placid, complacent
little sound very different from the
#. squeak or squeal of the unhappy
shmaels you used to know. Certainly

he will help himself to a little cake, if
such a thing is to be had, for he feels
at home, as he doubtless wishes you to
do. If you do not care to share your
dainties, you can hang them from the
roof.
In the trenches themselves the rat
is almost a domestic animal. Town
rats are lean, persecuted and vicious;
nobody loves them. But those who
hobnob with us here are fed, like our
Army, on Army rations, together with
more than their share of private
luxuries, and consequently are stout
and contented-looking, and display
none of the ill-bred and disconcerting
haste of the hereditary fugitive of our
drains and cellars. If you happen to
stand still and silent for a few moments,
you will hear some cheery old rascal
come sniffing and grunting along the
as to enjoy the air—or so his manner
would indicate.
Between the Army and these other
dwellers in earths and burrows there
must henceforth be a bond of true
sympathy.

LAST THOUGHTS ON GALLIPOLI.
ONCE more sits Mahomet by Helles' marges
And smokes at ease among his cypress-trees,
Nor snipes from scrubberies at British targes
Nor views them wallowing in sacred seas, .
But cleans his side-arms and is pleased to prattle
Of that great morning when he woke and heard
That in his slumbers he had fought a battle,
A bloody battle, and a little bird
Piped (in the German) at his side, and said,
“The something infidels have been and fled.”
Cautious he crept from out his mountain-ditches,
Down the long gully, past the Water Towers;
By Backhouse Point he nosed among the niches,
But they were hushed, and innocent of Giaours;
Still fearful found the earthy homes we hauntcd,
Those thirsty stretches where the rest-camps were,
Then to the sea slunk on, a trifle daunted
By wreathéd wires and every sort of snare,
And came at last, incredulous, to find
The very beach all blasphemously mined.
Now on each hand he eyes our impious labels,
Bond STREET and REGENT STREET, those weary ways;
Here stands the PINK FARM, with the broken gables,
Here Oxford CIRCU's marks a winding maze;
But most, I ween, in scarred grave-ridden regions
O'er many a battle-scene he loves to brood,
How Allah here was gracious to his legions,
How here, again, he was not quite so good,
IIere by the BRowN House, when the bombs began,
And they–don't mention it—they turned and ran.
And we no more shall see the great ships gather,
Nor hear their thundering on days of state,
Nor toil from trenches in an honest lather
To magic swimmings in the perfect Strait;
Nor sip Greek wine and see the slow sun dropping
On gorgeous evenings over Imbros' Isle,
While up the hill that maxim will keep popping,
And the men sing, and camp-fires wink awhile,
And in the scrub the glow-worms glow like stars,
13ut (hopeless creatures) will not light cigars;
Nor daylong linger in our delvéd lodges,
And fight for food with fifty thousand flies,
Too sick and sore to be afraid of “proj's,”
Too dazed with dust to see the turquoise skies;
Nor walk at even by the busy beaches,
Or quiet cliff-paths where the Indians pray,
And see the sweepers in the sky-blue reaches
Of Troy's own water, where the Greek ships lay,
And touch the boat-hulks, where they float forlorn,
The wounded boats of that first April morn;
Nor wake unhappily to see the sun come
And stand to arms in some Cimmerian grot—
Dut I, in town, well rid of all that bunkum,
I like to think that Mahomet is not;
He must sit on, now sweltering, now frozen,
By many a draughty cliff and mountain holt,
And, when rude fears afflict the Prophet's chosen,
Gird on his arms and madly work his bolt,
While round the heights the awful whispers run,
“The hard of Prych is landing with his gun.”

UNWRITTEN LETTERS To THE KAISER.
No. XXXIV.
(From the Frau Professor TiNTENKLEcks.)
ALL-MIGHTIEST KAISER,-With the humblest assurance
of my everlasting respect I desire to lay bare to you, since
you are without doubt the Father of your People, my
inmost thoughts as to this terrible War in which we have
now for eighteen months been engaged. I have some right,
I think, for my husband is that same Professor Tintenklecks
whose opusculum on “International Law in Relation to
World Power" was received with special favour by your
Majesty, who summoned the beloved writer to your Palace,
and with your own gracious right hand were pleased to
beat him with some force on his back, saying that “this
Tintenklecks is a tremendous fellow, and there should be
more such in the world.” How well I remember that
evening—it was a year before the War—and how in honour
of the Professor we had a Poetry supper, at which each
guest recited some verses of praise, and at the end little
Amalie Siegeltisch, the daughter of our colleague, placed on
the brows of the Professor a laurel-wreath which, however,
pricked his with - much-hair-unadorned head, and had
therefore, after a great deal of pleasant witticisms, to be
taken off.
So when the War at last broke out my husband and I
were amongst the loudest Hosannah-shouters and singers
of true German patriotic songs, for we believed then that
the War would be a short one, and that after a few great
victories we should make a brilliant peace on our own
terms, having utterly smashed all our enemies and having
taken lºngland's war-ships and her colonies for our
own. “Long he cannot last,” said my Professor, speak-
ing of the War. “The French are a degenerate race, and
we shall be in Paris in a month. The English are given
up to games, and their mercenary army—I have it on
the highest authority—cannot for a moment stand against
our German heroes. The Russians are slow and dis-
organised and useless for war. For me you need not be
afraid, my dear. In this war a man of my age will not
be required.” So he spoke; and now where is he and
what has become of him 2 He has lost a leg, his right
hand has been shot through, and he is in a hospital in
Poland. Shall I ever see him again, I wonder.
Well, we have had victories in plenty, according to the
Generals. Every time we move from one place to another
we gain, it seems, an overwhelming triumph and cause to
fly every one who is opposed to us. Twice already your
Majesty has announced that before the leaves fell from the
trees there would be peace, and our brave soldiers would
return safely to their homes; but, alas, it has not so hap-
pened, and the dreadful fighting still goes on, and many
thousands of our women lose their fathers, their husbands,
and their sons. With every victory (as they call it) peace,
which should be nearer at hand, seems to retire further and
further away, and only sorrow and wretchedness come close
to us. And that is not all. Our food, like everything else
we have to buy, is so dear that we women find it above all
things difficult to provide ourselves with what we need for
our daily life, and the worst of it, they say, has not yet come.
I could understand that if we had been defeated; but we
have been ever victorious and yet we are in want. It is
useless for Pastor Hassmann to tell us on Sundays that we
must endure to the end. We are prepared to do what we can,
but we think, too, that since we have been so magnificently
victorious we should have peace quickly, so that we may
all once more try to have some happiness in this world.
I remain, in the deepest devotion,
Your loyal, IXUNEGUNDE TINTENKLECKs.

MEDITATIONS OF MARGUS O'REILLY.
LUCY.
WE called her Lucy because she came
from the country and “dwelt on a wide
moor.” We never knew her real name.
She came like a ray of sunlight into
our dull sordid town once a week with
immaculate white apron, wearing a
cap of an older, honester world, carry-
ing a basket of delicious country butter
made up in appetising rolls. On the
clean napkin which covered the top of
the basket always reposed a huge door-
key, “to keep,” she said, “the butter
from turning.” And the white hair
of her and those wonderful blue eyes
which looked you through and through
No wonder my wife was in love with
her and refused from that time to eat
the dull town-grocer's wares.
My wife often muses as to the real
cause of the general superiority of
dwellers in the country over the apolo-
gies for httmanity who live in towns.
She says it is moral fibre. She comes
from the country herself and is quite
unbiassed. For me I think it must be
living so much amongst sheep and
lambs and woolly things.
I shouldn't have said myself that our
town butter was without fibre, but this
is a matter of taste.
My wife would often close her eyes
when eating Lucy and conjure up
pictures of her own simple girlhood
days, of the country rectory, of the
rooks singing matins and vespers in
the trees. Country people often get like
this over an egg at breakfast. I didn't
eat Lucy myself, as my taste is ruined
by my vicious town breeding; besides,
Lucy was a luxury in war-time, and
Dossett's Genuine Creamery has for
me a meatier savour.
Cecilia always gave Lucy more than
the market value for her butter and
a cup of tea besides, while they chatted
occasionally over things dear to rural
hearts, accidents by flood and field,
turnips and parochial vestries. My
wife used to marvel at the superior
firmness of Lucy's butter, which was
ever the same, Lucy's explanation being
that she had a wonderfully cool hand.
Our local inspector, a man of the
latest and most scientific knowledge,
confirmed this statement. In intro-
ducing Lucy to our resident magistrate
he said she was the coolest hand he
had ever known. It was a bad case.
It had ten per cent. too much of this,
and fifteen per cent. too much of that,
and the rest was the cheapest mar-
garine and stirring. There wasn't a
cow within five miles of her place and
he didn't believe she had ever seen one.
- We haven't met Lucy since. My
wife says that Wordsworth was often
taken in, just like that. And she has
heard, anyhow, that Lucy was born in
Bradford. So that it proves nothing.

Government in the War between North and South—to apply those principles to modern conditions and to do our best to prevent trade

departure from neutrality.”—Sir Edirand Grey.]

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Janu-
ary 24th. — At Question time House
crowded in response to urgent Whip
issued in anticipation of division on
Third Reading of Military Service Bill.
Members ready to vote; disinclined to
remain to hear speeches, delivered on
Second Reading and Committee stages,
reiterated by small minority on Report.
Thus it came to pass that when on
stroke of half-past nine this milestone
passed, Benches were almost empty.
Filled up when Third Reading
moved, and debate lamely set on foot
again. WALTER LoNG, who has greatly
helped Box AR LAw in his successful
management of Bill, set good example by
moving Third Reading without addi-
tional word of comment or
argument. Example thrown
away. More last words
spoken under embarrassing
accompaniment of private
conversation and other signs
of impatience.
Shortly after eleven o'clock
division taken, revealing ex- +
istence of solid minority of
H=
three dozen. Oddly enough,
whilst rattling majority on
Second Reading was hailed '
with enthusiastic cheering,
that on Third Reading was
heard in silence, Members
hurrying off in search of
taxis.
Business done. —By maj-
ority of 347, in House of 419
Members, Military Service
Bill read a third time and
passed on to Lords.
IIouse of Lords, Tuesday.—Military
Service Bill turned up for Second Read-
ing. Full attendance and a gathering
of Commoners in their pen above Bar
seemed to indicate important debate.
Turned out to be only less dull than
that which slumbered round closing
stage in the Commons. LANSDown E
pluckily endeavoured to give note of
novelty to topic by saying “not what
the Bill was but what it was not.”
Even this ingenious device did not
succeed in investing proceedings with
anything approaching animation.
The WEARY WEARDALE, who through
long public life has tried in succession
both branches of the Legislature and
found them equally withered, was
doubtful whether the measure would
appreciably affect its avowed purpose
of increasing number of men with the
Colours. With instinct of good Liberal
—in his time PHILIP STANHoPE was
known in the Commons as an almost
dangerous Radical—he turned and rent
,
“certain leaders who have surrendered
a precious principle and in so doing
are undermining the authority and
existence of the whole Liberal Party.”
Still, though prospect was gloomy, he
would not despair.
“The Liberal Party,” he said, “will
rise again" (HALSBURY shook his head
doubtfully) “and will shed the leaders
who have deserted it.”
Having thus delivered his soul WEARY
ONE did not challenge a division.
Business done.—Military Service Bill
read second time without division.
House of Commons, Wednesday.—
Once more, the last time in history of
session of unparalleled length and im-
portance, House crowded. Peers' Gal-
lery full. From Diplomatic Gallery
the United States, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark and Holland, represented by
Is
their Ministers, looked on, eagerly list-
ening.
Resolution, moved by SHIRLEY BENN,
urged Government to enforce against
enemy a blockade as effective as pos-
|sible. In one of his comprehensive,
quietly delivered and powerful speeches
|Edward GREY showed that situation
is not so easily managed as amateur
diplomatists below the Gangway, be-
lieve, or as fractious newspapers, bent
on damaging the Government even if
the Empire falls, assert. Explained in
detail steps taken by Foreign Office to
deal with it. House listened critically
but approvingly. Took note of fact
that FiRST Lord of ADMIRALTY em-
phatically cheered denial of one of the
|malicious rumours current—that in the
task of preventing supplies, reaching
the enemy the Foreign Office spoils
the work of the Navy.
Sharp, almost angry burst of cheer-
ing greeted passage towards close of
speech in which Foreign SECRETARY |
declared that maximum effort in this
country, whether military, naval or
financial, is at the disposal of our
Allies in carrying on the War against
Prussian militarism.
“With them,” he confidently but
still quietly said, “we will see it
through to the end.”
Speeches following expressed general
satisfaction with this statement, supple-
mented by one addressed to neutrals.
Courteously assured them of desire not
to make things unnecessarily irksome.
But pointed out that in the matter of
preventing supplies reaching the enemy
by circuitous routes Great Britain has
her own work to do and means to do
it thoroughly.
Business done.—Resolution advocat-
ing effective blockade talked out.
Thursday.-- Parliament prorogued.
Reversing CHARLEs LAMB's conscien-
tious habit at the India Office,
where, having arrived late,
he made up for it by going
away early, Parliament, hav-
ing toiled through exception-
ally long Session, treats itself

AT THE PLAY.
“PLEASE HELP EMILY.”
THE date at which Emily needed
so much assistance was clearly ante
bellum, for there is no mention of
hostilities, no gun-fire is heard from
the direction of Westende, and Belgium
is still bathing. But it must have been
only just before the War, for the eman-
cipation which the female sex here en-
joys is marked by an extreme modernity.
A decade or two ago we might have
been shocked at the spectacle of a
young lady turning up at a bachelor's
flat at 9 A.M. on a Sunday in a ball-
frock, after a night out at a dancing-
club. Lately we have learnt to bear
such escapades without flinching. But
it was not so with Emily's guardian, Sir
Samuel Lethbridge, very Victorian in his
stuffy prejudice in favour of the decen-
cies; and it was necessary to put him
off with a tale of her sudden departure
to Brussels to render first aid to an
aunt stricken with mumps. In order
to give colour to this fabrication Emily
urges Dick Trotter, the bachelor of the
flat (as soon as he returns from his
own night out), to conduct her to
the alleged invalid. He consents, but
not without protest, for he is a roué of
the old school and cannot approve of
these platonic adventures; besides, he
is about to se ranger by marriage with
somebody else and (a matter of detail,
but most º is under con-
tract to take her to Brighton for the day.
A fairly preposterous start, you will
say; yet the delightful naturalness which
Miss GLADYs Cooper and Mr. CHARLEs
HAwTREY bring to the situation gives
it almost an air of possibility. But,
once we are at Ostend, and have been
introduced to Trotter's incredibly in-
appropriate fiancée (she is a niece of
the same aunt and has followed under
protection of a tame escort), we are
prepared to launch freely and fearlessly
into the rough and tumble of farce.
It is in vain that Miss GLADYS
Cooper, over her petit déjeuner, pre-
serves a natural demeanour, even to
the point of talking with her mouth
full; the light humour of the First Act
declines to the verge of buffoonery.
The devastating confusions which en-
sue in the matter of identity and re-
lationship (in our author's Ostend you
assume, till corrected, that all couples
are married); the intervention of the
local gendarmerie, headed by a British
detective; the arrest of half the party
(including the aunt, arrived in perfect
health and ignorance en route for
England) on a nameless charge in
connection with Emily's suspected
abduction — all this is in the best
Criterion manner.
In the Third Act, though we never
recover the rapture of the First, the
humour touches a higher level; but what
it gains in finesse it loses in spontaneity.
Here we meet Emily's father, returned
from lecturing in the States on social
ethics. The scandal of his daughter's
conduct leaves him indifferent, for a
long and varied experience of the morals
of many lands, in the course of which
he has married as many as eighteen
wives, having made a point of adopting
for the time being the system—poly-
gamous or other—of the country in
which he happens to find himself, has
taught him that nothing is right or
wrong except as local opinion makes
it so. We are allowed to gather that
heredity may have had some influence

in the moulding of Emily's character;
and if we may hope for its continuance
into the next generation there seems
every prospect that the children she
may bear to Trotter (now released from
Julia and free to marry the right
woman) will not have their develop-
ment hampered by excess of prudery.
Mr. CHARLEs HAWTREY as Trotter
played with his old easy skill and
seemed to take a more than usual
interest in the play. He was sup-
ported º they say) by a par-
ticularly brilliant cast, including Miss
LoTTIE WENNE as the aunt, Mr.
ERIC LEw Is as Emily's father, Mr.
FREDERICK KERR as Sir Samuel, Miss
HELEN HAYE in the thankless part of
Julia, and Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR as a
self-effacing phantom of a lover. All
were in great form ; but, next to
Miss GLADYs Cooper, whose natural
charm and ingenuous espièglerie were
a perpetual delight, I offer my pro-
foundest compliments to the short but
extraordinarily clever performance of
Mr. H. R. HIGNETT as Trotter's man
Francis. This is the day of stage
valets, but he was an exceptional
treasure. To a quiet taste for philo-
sophy he added an infinite tact; and by
the lies which he poured into the tele-
phone to cover his master's breach of
engagement to Julia he moved Emily,
herself a gifted artist, to admiration.
The author, Mr. H. M. HARwooD,
must be congratulated on a farce that
at its best was really excellent fun.
And he may take it for flattery, if he
likes, when I say that a good deal of
his dialogue might be adapted into the
French without offending our gallant
Allies on the ground of a too insular
squeamishness. O. S.

WHEN Hargrave Ladd, who was a solicitor in a very fair
way of business, with an agreeable but unemotional wife,
happened to be getting into an omnibus at the moment
when Stella Rayne fell off the top of it, he unconsciously
put himself in the way of a lot of bother. Naturally, as a
gentleman and the male protagonist of a novel—Let Be
(METHUEN)—he could do no less than pick the girl out of
the mud and see her home in a cab. Whether, quite
strictly speaking, he need have called next day to see how
she was getting over the accident is another matter.
Certainly his interfering aunt, Mrs. Dering, was of the
opinion that Hargrave, as a married man, was displaying
an excess of courtesy towards the pretty tumbler. As for
Miss SYBIL CAMPBELL LETHBRIDGE, who has written the
tale, she gives no indication of her views one way or the
other. Indeed this attitude of humorous tolerance for
humanity is Miss LETH BRIDGE's most striking characteristic.
It is at once a source of strength and weakness to the book,
making, on the one hand, for the reality of the characters,
and, on the other, for a certain non-conductiveness of at-
mosphere that robs their emotions of warmth. Anyhow,
the inevitable happens, and Hargrave falls in love with
Stella, who in turn reciprocates his passion up to almost
the last page in the book, when, having come to the edge
of the precipice and made every preparation for her leap
into the gulf of elopement, she does a mental quick-change
and walks away as the contented betrothed of Another. So
Hargrave, making the best of a good job, rejoins Mrs. H.;
and one may suppose that, if any more distressed damsels
fall off omnibuses in his presence, he will prudently “let
be." You may think with me that this abrupt finish
lessens the effect of an otherwise well-written and enter-
taining story.
Miss MURIEL HINE in The Individual (LANE), essaying a
problem novel, does not disdain the old-fashioned way of
the woven plot and the dramatic incident. Her hero, Orde
Tarerner, surgeon by trade and eugenist by profession, falls
in love with Elizma, a Cornish beauty and rare fiddler.
His inquiries as to her eugenical fitness having been
answered satisfactorily but inaccurately, he marries, to find
that Elizma's mother really died insane. His principles
conquer his desire for children, and his decision is com-
municated to the fiery Flizma, who, fierce maternalist
that she is and coming of a wild stock that never stuck
at anything, undertakes a desperate flirtation by way
of solving the difficulty in her own heroic way—at least you
will certainly make this kind of a guess, but on investigation
you may find that you've been wrong! Happily in the
end a deathbed confession proves the second version of her
birth as inaccurate as the first. She really comes of quite
untainted stock, so the eugenist is satisfied and husband
and wife reconciled. That is to say the author runs away
from her problem, which was perhaps, all things considered,
the wisest thing to do. She has some eye for character
and has made a good thing of her Elizma, but has let her-
self scatter her energies over a team too large to be driven
with a sure hand. And why, oh why did she drag in the
War? Or call her butler Puffles? But she keeps the
interest of her story going, and you mustn't skip or you
may be set off on a hopelessly wrong tack.

[FEBRUARY 2, 1916.
So great is my admiration for the humorous gifts of
Mr. WILLIAM CAINE and so strong my gratitude to him
for such books as Boom and Old Enough to Know Better,
that I have decided to erase from my memory with all
possible speed his latest effort, Bildad the Quill-Driver
(LANE). A man with so many bull's-eyes to his credit
may be forgiven an occasional miss; and, to be candid,
Bildad the Quill-Driver seems to me to come nowhere
near the target. Most of Mr. CAINE’s work would be the
better for a certain amount of condensation, but this is
the only occasion on which he has really lost control of
his pen. He has had the unfortunate idea of writing a
comic Arabian Nights in close imitation of the style of the
original translation, even to the insertion of short poems
at every possible opportunity. Now, this is one of those
ideas which at first blush would seem to contain all the
elements of delightful humour; but it has the deadly flaw
that it involves a monotony which becomes after a few
pages more than irritating. For a while the novelty is
entertaining, and then the reader becomes crushed by the
realisation that he has got to rely for his amusement on the
same sort of joke repeated T -----
over and over again for
more than three hundred
pages. And, once that
happens, the doom of the
book is sealed, for the
not in themselves divert-

them. But, as I say, I am – `. - -
not going to allow this book to shake my opinion that
Mr. CAINE is one of our most engaging humorists.
I recommend, absolutely without reserve, a war book
entitled Day by Day with the Russian Army (CoNSTABLE).
It is written by Professor BERNARD PAREs, the Official
British Observer with the Russian Armies in the Field,
and is the real thing. Although incidentally it is to be
praised as a modest and lucid piece of writing, well in
keeping with the character of an author whose habit of
viewing an action from the most dangerous, because the
most interesting, point can be discovered only by reading
between the lines, primarily it is to be prescribed as a
sovereign tonic against German-made depression. The
writer, after being present at the conquest of Galicia and
the triumphant advance to the top of the Carpathians, after
witnessing much of the historical Russian retreat under
pressure of overwhelming artillery superiority, and after
conversing freely with his friends of all ranks on different
sectors of the Front whilst offering greetings in the name
of their English comrades in arms, announces finally, in
a wholly satisfactory fashion, his unalterable conviction
as to the unqualified supremacy of our Allies when on
anything like equal terms with their opponents as regards
munitions of war. And that is a matter which, though
never in doubt, it is pleasant to hear again in tones of
authority at a time when we believe the Russian lack
ow A PRUSSIAN ST. GEORGE would HAVE Don E IT.
of supplies is at last being made good. The evidence is
the more complete because not only do we learn of the
interrogation of many prisoners, but because a long extract
from the diary of one of them, an Austrian officer, is
included, to point the difference in spirit between the two
armies. The demoralisation of the Austrian forces, even
when advancing, is so strikingly presented that one
cannot doubt their dependence on German domination
and German batteries to hold them together at all.
Although Professor PAREs attaches several excellent maps,
he is not really much concerned with questions of strategy,
but has devoted himself to just two points—moral and
munitions.
I am afraid that Mrs. Hodgson BURNETT is in a little
danger of overdoing it. She knows (who better?) the
briskness of the popular demand for long-lost heirs; and
she may well have argued that the longer he has been lost,
the more squalid his present environment, and the more
brilliant his heritage, the more assured would be the heir's
welcome. Perhaps indeed this may be so in America; but
- - - - - -------- for this side, as I say, I
have my doubts. I dare-
say your own intuition
will tell you that the hero
of The Lost Prince (Hod-
| DER AND Stoughton) is a
prince who has been lost.
In fact so effectually had
the branch of the regal
house to which Prince
Ivor belonged been mis-
laid that the story opens

Lºndºn slum with no
companions but a myste-
rious father and a crip-

terious things are con-

the dynastic intrigues of Mrs. BURNETT launch the two
boys upon a secret journey through Europe, to convey to a
number of pleasantly melodramatic conspirators the message
that “The Lamp is Lighted ' " As their object is expressly
stated to be protection for a small principality, the fact
that the interviews include one with the Emperor of
AUSTRIA has in these days a quaintly anachronistic effect,
and at least serves to emphasise the neutral origin of the
story. However, they are of course successful; and in
the last chapter Prince Ivor manages to be enormously
astonished at finding that the mysterious monarch of
Samavia, for whom he has been working, is none other than
his own father—an obvious fact that, with truly royal
tactfulness, he had contrived to ignore throughout the story.
My advice to the author is to write up her villains (at
present they haven't a chance) and make the whole thing
into a film play. The wanderings of the two boys offer a
fine opportunity for scenic variety; while the sentiment is
of precisely the nature to be stimulated by a pianoforte
accompaniment. As a three-reel exclusive, in short, I
can fancy The Lost Prince entering triumphantly into his
appropriate kingdom.

DIPLOMACY.
“TELL us,” said Phyllis laboriously, “about diploma
and there it stuck.
“Tistics,” added Lillah in a superior manner.
Being an uncle, I can never give my brain a rest. It is
the easiest thing in the world to be found out by a child of
Seven.
“You mean,” I said, “diplomatists?”
“Yes,” said Phyllis in a monotone. “Daddy said they-
weren't-any-earthly-blast-them' and—”
“Yes, yes!” I said hastily. I can imagine what George
said about diplomatists. He held a good deal of Balkan stock.
“Well, are they?" asked Lillah innocently.
“Diplomatists,” I said, “are people in spats and creased
trousers, and the truth is not in them.”
“What is spats 2" asked Phyllis.
“Spats,” I answered, “are what people wear when they
want to get a job and their boots are shabby.”
“Are diplomatists shabby 2” queried Lillah.
“Not a bit,” I answered rather bitterly.
“Do they want jobs?”
“They want to keep them,” I said.
“So they have spats,” said Phyllis, completely satisfied.
“Exactly,” I said. “Then they go into an extremely
grand room together and talk.”
“What about 2 " said Lillah.
“Oh, anything that turns up,” I answered—“the rise
in prices or the late thaw; or if everything fails they simply
make personal remarks.”
“Like clergymen,” said Phyllis vaguely.
“Exactly,” I said. “And all round the building are
secret police disguised as reporters, and reporters disguised
as secret police. And then each of the diplomatists goes
away and writes a white paper, or a black paper, or a
greeny-yellow paper, to show that he was right.”
“And then 2" Phyllis gaped with astonishment.
“Then everybody organises, and centralises, and frater-
nises, and defraternises, and, in the end, mobilises.”
Phyllis and Lillah simply stared.
“Why?" they both gasped.
“Oh, just to show the diplomatists were wrong,” I said
airily.
4 : Ånd then 2" said Lillah breathlessly.
“The ratepayers pay more.”
“What is a ratepayer 2 " asked Phyllis.
“A notorious geck and gull,” I said, borrowing from a
more distinguished writer.
Lillah stared at me with misgiving.
“But why don't the diplomists say what's true?” she
asked.
“Because,” I said, “they'd lose their money and nobody
would love them.”
“But,” said Phyllis, “ Mummie said if we were good
everyone would love us.”
“Your mother was quite right,” I answered, with a
distinct twinge of that thin-ice feeling.
“Well, but you said nobody would love diplomists if
they were good,” said Phyllis.
“So good people aren't loved,” added Lillah, “and
Mummie said what wasn't true.”
I fought desperately for a reply. This could not be
allowed to pass. It struck at the roots of nursery con-
stitutionalism.
“Ah,” I said, without any pretence at logic, “but the
poor diplomatists don't know any better.” -
“Like the heathen that Mummie tells us about on
Sunday?”
“Between the heathen and a diplomatist,” I said, “there
is nothing to choose.”
Phyllis sighed. “I wish I didn't know any better,” she
said yearningly. Lillah looked at me dangerously from the
corner of her eye.
“And got money for it,” she added.
“Would you like to play zoo 2 " I said hastily.
They were silent.
“I'll be a bear,” I said eagerly—“a polar one.”
No answer. I felt discouraged, but I made another effort.
“Or,” I said, “I can be a monkey and you can throw nuts
at me, or "-desperately—“a ring-tailed lemur, or an orang-
outang, or an ant-eater . . .” My voice tailed away and
there was silence. Then the small voice of Phyllis broke in.
“Uncle,” she said, “why aren't you a diplomist?”
At that point Nurse came in and I slid quietly off. As
I was going out of the door I heard the voice of Lillah.
“Nannie,” she said, “tell us about diplomists."
“You leave diplomatists alone, Miss Lillah,” said Nurse;
“they won't do you no harm if you don't talk about
them.”
Now why couldn't l have thought of that 2

JILLINGS.
I HAVE always been very fond and proud of my niece
Celia. With an exceptionally attractive appearance and a
personal fascination that is irresistible she combines the
sweetest and most unselfish nature it has ever been my
good fortune to meet. Indeed, she has so excessive a con-
sideration for the feelings of everybody but herself that she
drifts into difficulties which she might have avoided by a
little more firmness. As, for example, in the case of
Jillings.
self. Considered merely as an article of vertu it was about
on a par with the pincushions, but Celia accepted it in the
spirit with which it had been offered. And, warned by
experience, she did not lock it up in the obscurity of a
cabinet, nor contrive that some convenient accident should
befall it, wisely preferring “to bear those ills she had than
fly to others,” etc. And so it still remains a permanent
eyesore on her mantelshelf.
Then it seemed that Jillings, who, by the way, was not
uncomely, had established friendly relations with one of

fellow, though he is said to have rather a violent temper.
But he has never shown it with Celia—nobody could. Jack
had left the Army on his mar-T ----- - - - -
riage and settled down in a
pretty little place in Surrey, but
of course rejoined the Service
as soon as the War broke out.
So long as he was in training
with his regiment she took
rooms in the neighbourhood,
but when he was ordered to
the Front about a year ago she
and the children returned to the ºf
Surrey home, and it was then -
that Celia engaged Jillings as
parlourmaid. I saw her shortly
afterwards when I went down
to stay for a night, and was
struck by the exuberant enthu-
siasm with which she waited—
not over efficiently—at table.
Celia remarked afterwards that
Jillings was a little inexperienced
as yet, but so willing and warm-
hearted, and with such a sensi-
tively affectionate disposition
that the least hint of reproof
sufficed to send her into a flood
of tears.
I had no idea then—nor had
Celia—how much inconvenience
and embarrassment can be
produced by a warm-hearted
parlour-maid. Jillings' devotion
concrete form until Celia's
birthday, and the form it took - - ---
was that of an obese and unimaginably hideous pin-
cushion which mysteriously appeared on her dressing-table.
Old and attached servants are in the habit of presenting
their employers on certain occasions with some appropriate
gift, and no one would be churlish enough to discourage so
kindly a practice. But Jillings, it must be owned, was
beginning it a bit early. However, Celia thanked her as
charmingly as though she had been longing all her life for
exactly such a treasure. Still, it was not only unnecessary
but distinctly unwise to add that it should be placed in her
wardrobe for safety, as being much too gorgeous for every-
day use. Because all she gained by this consummate tact
was another pincushion, not quite so ornate perhaps, but
even cruder in colour, and this she was compelled to assign a
prominent position among her toilet accessories.
These successes naturally encouraged Jillings to further
efforts. Celia had the misfortune one day to break a piece
of valuable old porcelain which had stood on her drawing-
room mantelpiece, whereupon the faithful Jillings promptly
replaced the loss by a china ornament purchased by her-

|. As was only to be expected,
the other servants, being equally
devoted to their mistress, could
not allow Jillings to monopolize
the pride and glory of putting
her under an obligation. Very
soon a sort of competition
sprang up, each of them en-
deavouring to out-do the other
in giving Celia what they
termed, aptly enough, “little
surprises," till they hit upon
the happy solution of clubbing
together for the purpose. Thus
Celia, having, out of the kind-
ness of her heart, ordered an
- expensive lace hood for the
baby from a relation of the
nurse's at Honiton, was dis-
imayed to discover, when the
hood arrived, that it was
already paid for and was a joint
gift from the domestics. After
that she felt, being Celia, that
it would be too ungracious to
- - --- — insist on refunding the money.
It was not until I was staying with her last Spring that
I heard of all these excesses. But at breakfast on Easter
Sunday not only did Celia, Tony and the baby each receive
an enormous satin egg filled with chocolates, but I was
myself the recipient of one of these seasonable tokens, being
informed by the beaming Jillings that “we didn't want you,
Sir, to feel you'd been forgotten.” By lunch-time it
became clear that she had succeeded in animating at least
one of the local tradesmen with this spirit of reckless liber-
ality. For when Celia made a mild inquiry concerning a
sweetbread which she had no recollection of having ordered
Jillings explained, with what I fear I must describe as a
self-conscious smirk, that it was “a little Easter orfering
from the butcher, Madam.” I am bound to say that even
Celia was less scrupulous about hurting the butcher's feel-
ings—no doubt from an impression that his occupation
must have cured him of any over-sensitiveness. -
As soon as we were alone she told me all she had been
enduring, which it seemed she had been careful not to
mention in her letters to Jack. “I simply can't tell you,

Uncle,” she concluded pathetically, “how wearing it is to
be constantly thanking somebody for something I'd ever
so much rather be without. And yet—what else can I do?”
I suggested that she might strictly forbid all future
indulgence in these orgies of generosity, and she supposed
meekly that she should really have to do something of that
sort, though we both knew how extremely improbable it
was that she ever would.
This morning I had a letter from her. Jack had got
leave at last and she was expecting him home that very
afternoon, so I must come down and see him before his six
days expired. “I wish now,” she went on, “that I had
| taken your advice, but it was so difficult somehow. Be-
cause ever since I told Jillings and the others about Jack's
coming home they have been going about smiling so
importantly that I'm horribly afraid they're planning
some dreadful surprise, and I daren't ask them what.
Now I must break off, as I must get ready to go to the
station with Tony and meet dear Jack. . . .”
Then followed a frantic postscript. “I know now !

HOW I DINED WITH THE PRESIDENT.
THE TRUTH ABOUT WILSON.
[special. To 1't Neil.]
ON Saturday, January 22nd, I
arrived in Washington from Seattle.
The Seattle part is another story.
What I have to tell to-day, here,
now, and once for all, is what 1 saw of
the PRESIDENT at close quarters outside
and inside the White House and what
happened at the historic dinner-party,
at which I was the only representative
of a belligerent country present.
By a fortunate coincidence Mr.
Wilson arrived at the railway depôt
on his return from a game of golf
with his secretary, Mr. TUMULTY, as I
was loitering at the bookstall. I had
never seen either of them before, but
intuitively recognised them in a flash.
Mr. TUMULTY looked exactly as a man
with so momentous a name could only
look. The PRESIDENT was garbed in a
neutral-tinted lounge-suit and wore a
dark fawn overcoat and dove-coloured
spats. -
How did the PRESIDENT look? Well,
his face was obviously the face of a
changed man. Not that he is changed
for the worse. He seemed in the pink
of condition, and his clean-cut profile
and firm jaw radiated inflexible deter-
mination at every pore. No signs of
a moustache are yet visible on his
finely-chiselled upper lip.
I had no introduction, and no time
was to be lost, so without a moment's
hesitation I strode up to the PRESIDENT
and said, “Permit me, Sir, as the
accredited representative of a neutral
nation, to offer you this token of re-
spect,” and handed him a small Dutch
cheese, a dainty to which I had been
| informed he was especially partial. The
PRESIDENT smiled graciously, handed
the offering to his secretary, and said,
“I thank you, Sir. Won't you join
us at the White House at dinner to-
night?" I expressed my acceptance
in suitable terms, bowed and passed on.
The dinner took place in the famous
octagonal dining-room of the White
House, which was profusely decorated
with the flags of the Scandinavian
Kingdoms, Spain, Greece, China, Chile,
Peru, Brazil and the Argentine.
The band of the Washington Post
Office Rifles was ensconced behind a
trellis of olive branches and discoursed
a choice selection of soothing music.
Flagons of grape-juice and various light
and phosphorescent beverages stood
on the sideboard. It was a memorable
scene and every detail was indelibly
impressed on my mind. The PRESIDENT
greeted his guests with the calm dig-
nity proper to his high, office. He
does not affect the high handshake of
English smart society, but a firm yet
gentle clasp. In repose his features
reminded me of JULIUS CAESAR, but
when he smiles he recalls the more
genial lineaments of the great Pompey.
The general impression created on
my mind was one of refined simplicity.
As the PRESIDENT himself remarked,
quoting THUCYDIDEs to one of his
Greek guests, qixoxaMotuev per' streMetas.
It is quite untrue that the conversa-
tion was confined to the English tongue.
On the contrary all the neutral lan-
guages, except Chinese, were spoken,
the PRESIDENT showing an equal facility
point of never uttering two consecutive
sentences in the same tongue. War
topics were rigorously eschewed, and so
far as I could follow the conversation
—I only speak five of the neutral lan-
guages—the subjects ranged from golf
to hygienic clothing, from co-education
to coon-can.
I do not propose here and now to
state the circumstances in which, on
leaving the White House, I was kid-
napped by some emissaries of Count
BERNSTORFF, and ultimately consigned
to the Tombs in New York on a false
charge of manslaughter; how I nar-
rowly escaped being electrocuted, and
was subsequently deported to Bermuda
as an undesirable alien. What I saw
and endured in the Tombs is another
story. What really matters is the Bill
of Fare of the PRESIDENT's dinner,
which was printed in Esperanto and
ran as follows:–
Turtle Dove Soup.
Norwegian Salmon Cutlets.
Iceland Reindeer Steak.
Tipperusalem Artichokes and Spanish Onions.
Chaud froid a la Woodrow.
Irene Pudding.
Dutch Cheese Straws.
Brazil Nuts.
After dinner Greek cigarettes were
handed round with small cups of China
tea and, as an alternative, Peruvian
maté.
THE INVASION.
I thought—being very old indeed,
“older,” as a poem by Mr. STURGE
MooRE begins, “than most sheep"—I
thought, being so exceedingly mature
and disillusioned, that I knew all the
worries of life. Yet I did not; there
was still one that was waiting for me
round the corner, but I know that
too, now.
I will tell you about it.
To begin with, let me describe myself.
I am an ordinary quiet-living obscure
person, neither exalted nor lowly, who,
having tired of town, took a little
place in the country and there settled
down to a life of placidity, varied by
such inroads upon ease as all back-to-
in every one, and honourably making a
the-landers know : now a raid on the
chickens by a fox, whose humour it is
not to devour but merely to decapitate;
now the disappearance of the gardener
at Lord DERBY's coat-tails; now a
flood; and now and continually a desire
on the part of the cook to give a month's
notice, if you please, and the conse-
quent resumption of correspondence
with the registry office. There you
have the main lines of the existence
not only of myself, but of thousands
of other English rural recluses. But
for such little difficulties I have been
happy—a Cincinnatus ungrumbling.
The new fly entered the ointment
about three weeks ago, when a parcel
was brought to me by a footman from
the Priory, some three miles away, with
a message to the effect that it had been
delivered there and opened in error.
They were of course very sorry.
I asked how the mistake had
occurred.
“Same name,” he said. “The house
has just been let furnished to some
people of the same name as yourself.”
Now I have always rather prided
myself on the rarity of my name. I
don't go so far as to claim that it came
over with the CoNQUEROR, but it is an
old name and an uncommon one, and
hitherto I had been the only owner of
it in the district. To have it duplicated
was annoying.
Worse however was to come.
I do not expect to be believed, but
it is a solemn fact that within a fort-
night two more bearers of my name
moved into the village. One was a
cowman, and the other a maiden lady,
so that at the present moment there
are four of us all opening or reject-
ing each other's letters. The thing is
absurd. One might as well be named
Smith right away.
I don't mind the cowman, but the
maiden lady is a large order. I have,
as I say, lived in this place for some
time—at least six years—and she
moved into The Laurels only ten days
ago, but when she came round this
morning with an opened telegram that
was not meant for her, she had the
maiden - ladylikellood to remark how
awkward it was when other people
had the same name as herself. “There
should,” she said, “never be more than
one holder of a name in a small place."
I had no retort beyond the obvious
one that I got there first; but I hope
that the cowman henceforth gets all
her correspondence and delays it. He
is welcome to mine so long as he deals
faithfully with hers.

NEWS FROM KIEL.
(By our Naval Erpert.)
AN interesting little item of news in
the daily papers of last Wednesday
may have escaped notice. It appears
that the German Liners which have
been laid up in New York harbour for
the last eighteen months have dis-
covered that their magnetic deviation
has been affected. This is the explan-
ation of the recent movement in the
harbour, when all the German ships
were turned round so as to readjust
their compasses.
The special significance of this in-
formation is to be found by taking it in
conjunction with the recent puzzling
reports of movements of the German
High Seas Fleet. It will be remem-
bered that the Fleet was represented in
an enemy official report (with the cus-
tomary exaggeration) as sweeping out
into the North Sea. That was not
readily believed, but it was generally
felt that there must be something in it,
especially as all manner of rumours of
naval activity kept coming through
from Scandinavia about the same time.
Our naval experts in this country were
quite at a loss, but to-day the riddle
is solved. What was happening was
that the High Seas Fleet was turning
round.
I have had the good fortune to fall
in with a neutral traveller—of the usual
high standing and impartial sympathies
—who has supplied a few details. It
seems that great excitement prevailed
at this scene of unwonted bustle and
activity. The operation was carried
out under favourable weather condi-
tions practically without a hitch, the
casualties being quite negligible, and
the moral of the men, in spite of their
long period of enforced coma, being
absolutely unshaken. One and all have
now cheerfully accepted the discon-
certing changes involved in the new
orientation, and window - boxes have
been generally shifted to the sunny
side.

106 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 9, 1916.
AT THE FRONT.
THERE is one matter I have hitherto
not touched on, because it has not hither-
to touched on me, and that is Courses.
The ideal course works like this.
You are sitting up to the ears in mud
under a brisk howitzer, trench mortar
and rifle grenade fire, when a respect-
ful signaller crawls round a traverse,
remarking, “Message, Sir.”
You take the chit from him languidly,
wondering whether you have earned a
court-martial by omitting to report on
the trench sleeping-suits which some-
one in the Rearward Services has
omitted to forward, and you read, still
languidly at first; then you get up and
whoop, throw your primus stove into
the air and proceed to dance on the
parapet, if your trench has one. Then
you settle down and read your message
again to see if it still runs, “You are
detailed to attend three months' Staff
work course at Boulogne, commencing
to-morrow. A car will be at the dump
for you to-night. A month's leave on
completion, of course.”
But all courses are not like this; all
you can say is that some are less unlike
it than others. I was sitting in a warm
billet about twelve noon having break-
fast on the first day out of trenches
when the blow fell on me. I was, t
report about two days ago at a sº
of Instruction some two hundred yards
away. I gathered that the course
had started without me. I set some
leisurely inquiries in train, in the hope
that it might be over before I joined
up. I also asked the Adjutant whether
I couldn't have it put off till next time
in trenches, or have it debited to me
as half a machine-gun course payable
on demand, or exchange it for a guinea-
pig or a canary, or do anything con-
sistent with the honour of an officer to
stave it off. For to tell the truth, like
all people who know nothing and have
known it for a long time, I cherish a
deeply-rooted objection to being in-
structed.
Unfortunately the Adjutant is one of
those weak fellows who always tell you
that they are mere machines in the
grip of the powers that change great
nations. So on the third day I bought
a nice new slate and satchel and
joined up.
Even now, after some days of intense
instruction, I find my condition is a
little confused and foggy. Of course
it covers practically the whole field of
military interests, and I ought to be
able to win the War in about three-
quarters of an hour, given a reason-
able modicum of men, guns, indents,
physical training and bayonet exercise,
knowledge of military law, and ac-
quaintance with the approved methods
of conducting a casualty clearing station,
a mechanical transport column, and a
field kitchen. The confusion of mind
evident in this last sentence is a high
testimonial to the comprehensive nature
of our course.
Physical training made the strongest
appeal to me. I remember some of
the best words, not perhaps as they
are, but as I caught them from an
almost over-glib expert. Did you know
you had a strabismal vertebra 2 or,
given a strabismal vertebra, that it
could be developed to almost any
extent by simply 'eaving from the 'ips?
Take my tip and try it next time you're
under shell-fire.
To-morrow we break up, and I join
the army. The army has gone away
somewhere while. I wasn't looking, and
I shall have to make inquiries about
it. You never can tell what these
things will do when not kept under
the strictest observation. My bit may
have gone to Egypt or Nyassaland or
Nagri Sembilan. But I have a de-
pressing feeling that A 27 a y z iv. 9.8
will be nearer, the mark, and that I
shall find it meandering nightly to
Bk. 171 in large droves, there to insert
more, and more humps of soggy Bel-
gium into more and more sandbags. I
don't want to make myself unpleasant
to the War Office, but I really can't see
why we haven't once and for all built
trenches all done up in eight - inch
thick steel plates. They could easily
be brought up ready-made, and simply
sunk into position.
They would sink all right; you'd
just have to put them down anywhere
and look the other way for a minute.
The difficulty would be to stop the lift
before it got to the basement—if there
is a basement in Flanders.
There is a tragedy to report. We
were adopted recently by a magpie.
He was a gentle creature of impulsive
habits and strong woodpecking in-
stincts. Arsène we called him. For
some days he gladdened us with his
soft bright eye. But when we came to
know him well and I relied on him to
break the shells of my eggs every
morning at breakfast, to steal my pens
and spill my ink, to wake me by a
gentle nip on the nose from his firm
but courteous beak, a rough grenadier
came one day to explain a new type of
infernal machine, and, when we went
out, left a detonator on the table.
I never saw what actually followed,
but we buried Arsène with full military
honours.

BY way of a supplement to the

Mr. HARRY LAUDER, the illustrious

“Let those wha wull compile the nation's

And guide oor thochts in strict historic
channels;
Ma Muse prefers, far fra these dull morasses,
To laud the purrrple heather and the lassies.”
Mr. STEveNson, the incomparable
cueist, sends this pithy distich —
“Big gums are useful in their way, 'tis true,
But nursery cannons have their uses too.”
Miss CARRIE TUBB, the famous so-
prano, writes:—
“Butt me no butts. Though carping critics
flout us,
What would DioGENEs have done with-
out us?”
A distinguished actor gives as his
favourite quotation the couplet from
GoLDSMITH :—
“A man he was financially unique,
And passing poor on forty pounds a week.”
Mr. BERNARD SHAw contributes this
characteristic definition of genius:—
“Genius consists in an infinite capacity for
giving pain.”
The Air Candidate for Mile End
sends the following witty and topical
epigram —
“Mid war's alarms there is no time for cooing,
But BILLING may prevent our land's un-
doing.”
“We are all familiar with the poetic words:
‘There's many a gem that's born to blush
unseen, and waste its fragrance on the desert
air.’”—Kilmarnock Herald.
Our own ignorance of this gem makes
us blush (unseen, we hope).

“OH, dear,” said Francesca, “everything keeps going

in a tone of heartfelt despair.
“Well,” I said, “you've known all along how it would
be. Everybody's told you so.”
“Everybody? Who's everybody in this case?”
“I told you so for one, and Mr. Asquith mentioned it
several times, and so did Mr. McKENNA.”
“I have never,” she said proudly, “discussed my weekly
books with Messrs. Asquith and McKENNA. I should
scorn the action.”
“That's all very well,” I said. “Keep them away as
far as you can, but they'll still get hold of you. The

“He’s fair to middling, I fancy—something like me.”
“You !” she said, in a tone of ineffable contempt.
“You’re no good at addition.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you wrong me. I'm a great deal
of good. Of course I don't pretend to be able to run three
fingers up three columns of figures a yard long and to write
down the result as £7,956 17s. 8d., or whatever it may be,
without a moment's pause. I can't do that, but for the
ordinary rough-and-tumble work of domestic addition I'm
hard to beat. Only if I'm to do these books of yours there
must be perfect silence in the room. I mustn't be talked to
while I'm wrestling with the nineteens and the seventeens
in the shilling column.”
“In fact,” said Francesca, “you ought to be a deaf adder.”
“Francesca,” I said, “how could you? Give me the
butcher's book and let there be no more jeur de mots
between us.”
I took the book, which was a masterpiece of illegibility,
and added it up with my usual grace and felicity.
“Francesca,” I said as I finished my task, “my total
differs from the butcher's, but the difference is in his favour,
not in mine. He seems to have imparted variety to his
calculations by considering that it took twenty pence to
make a shilling, which is a generous error. Now let me
deal with the baker while you tackle the grocer, and then
we'll wind up by doing the washing-book together.”
The washing - book was a teaser, the items being
apparently entered in Chaldee, but we stumbled through
it at last.
“And now,” I said, “we can take up the subject of thrift.”
“I don't want to talk about it,” she said, “I’m thoroughly
tired of it. We've talked too much about it already.”
“You're wrong there; we haven't talked half enough.
If we had, the books wouldn't have gone up.”
“They haven't gone up,” she said. “They're about
the same, but we've been having less.”
“Noble creature,” I said, “do you mean to say that
you've docked me of one of my Sunday sausages and the
whole of my Thursday roly-poly pudding and never said
a word about it 2."
“Well, you didn't seem to notice it, so I left it alone.”
“Ah, but I did notice it,” I said, “but I determined to
suffer in silence in order to set an example to the children.”
“That was bravely done,” she said. “It encourages me
to cut down the Saturday sirloin.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“MRS. PRETTY AND THE PREMIER.”
I AM not sure that I didn't find Mr.
BourchIER's “Foreword " or Apologia
(kindly given away with the programme)
rather more entertaining than the play
itself. As long as the dramatist (a New
Zealander) concerned himself with the
delightfully unconventional atmosphere
of Antipodean politics he was illumi-
nating and very possibly veracious.
But the relations between the Premier
and the widow Pretty, which promised,
as the title hinted, to be the main attrac-
tion, were such as never could have
occurred on land or sea. It was impos-
sible, with this farcical element always
obtruding itself, to take the political
features of the play seriously, as I
gather that we were intended to do;
and we got very little help from Mr.
Bou RCHIER's own performance, which
was frankly humorous. In his brochure
he tells us with great solemnity that he
is “more than pleased to think that
the play may help to demonstrate to
those of an older civilisation how truly
the best of the so-called Labour poli-
ticians strive to serve their country and
their fellow men. . . . Premier ‘Bill'
demonstrates vividly enough that, heart
and soul, the Australian politician de-
votes himself to the uplifting of the
great Commonwealth.” Mr. Bour-
CHIER's tongue may or may not have
been in his cheek when he penned
these lofty sentiments, but anyhow it
seemed to be there during most of the
play.
He is on safer ground when he tells
us that “in curiously vivid and pun-
gent fashion this little play outlines
the breezy freshness and the originality
of outlook which almost invariably
characterise the politicians and states-
men of the Prairie, the Veldt and the
Bush, and which more than anything
else perhaps differentiates them from
the men of an older land, hampered
as these latter often are by long and
stately traditions.” Certainly, in the
matter of addressing its Premier by
a familiar abbreviation of his Christian
name (an authority who has travelled
in these parts assures Mr. BourchIER
that he is “quite right:" that “people
would call this Premier ‘Bill' in
Australia”) the new world differs from
the old. I cannot so much as con-
template the thought of Mr. Asquith
being addressed by the MINISTER of
MUNITIONs as “Herb,” or even “Bert.”
But we have difficulties again with
the Foreword (for I cannot get away
from it) when we come to the question
of the hero's virility. In the play his
secretary says of him, “Bill's not a
man, he's a Premier. A kind of
dynamo running the country at top
speed.” Yet the Foreword, after citing
this passage, goes on to insist upon his
“tingling humanity” and hinting at
the need of such a type of manhood at
the present time. “After all,” concludes
Mr. BourchIER in a spasm of uplift
—“after all, what is the cry of the
moment here in the heart of the
Empire, but for ‘A MAN–Give us a
Man ' ' " But even if we reject the
secretary's estimate of his chief as a
dynamo we still find a certain defi-
ciency of manhood in the anaemic
indifference of the Premier's attitude
to women; an attitude, by the way,
not commonly associated with Mr.
BourchIER's impersonations on the

stage. Mrs. Pretty's tastes are, of course,
her own affair, and we were allowed
little insight into her heart (if any), but
I can only conclude that her choice
was governed by political rather than
emotional considerations (“Let us re-
member Wom EN HAVE THE Vote, IN
AUSTRALIA" is the finale of the Fore-
word) and that what she wanted was a
Premier rather than a Man.
Of the play itself one may at least
say that it kept fairly off the beaten
track. There was novelty in its local
colour, its unfamiliar types and the
episode, adroitly managed, of a pair
of gloves employed to muffle the
division bell at the moment of a crisis
on which the fate of the Government
depended. But the design was too
small to fill the stage of His Majesty's
and it left me a little disappointed. I
was content so long as Mr. BourcHIER
was in sight, but the part of Mrs.
Pretty needed something more than
the rather conscious graces and airy
drapery of Miss KYRIE BELLEw. The
rest of the performance was sound but
not very exhilarating; and altogether,
though I hope I am properly grate-
ful for any help towards the realisation
of “Colonial conditions,” I cannot
honestly say that Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier has done very much for me
(as Mr. Bou RCHIER hoped it would) by
way of supplementing the thrill of
Anzac.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE latest of our writers to contribute to the growing
literature of the War is Mr. HUGH WALPoLE. He has
written a book about it called The Dark Forest (SECKER),
but whether it is a good or a bad book I who have read
it carefully from cover to cover confess my inability to
decide. It is certainly a clever book, and violently unusual.
I doubt whether the War is likely to produce anything else
in the least resembling it. For one thing, it deals with a
phase of the struggle, the Russian retreat through Galicia,
about which we in England are still tragically ignorant.
Mr. WALPole writes of this as he himself has seen it in his
own experience as a worker with the Russian Red Cross.
The horrors, the compensations, the tragedy and happiness
of such work have come straight into the book from life.
But not content with this, he has peopled his mission with
fictitious characters and made a story about them. And
good as the story is, full of fine imagination and character,
the background is so tremendously more real that I was
constantly having to resist a feeling of impatience with the
false creations (in Macbeth's sense) who play out their un-
substantial drama before it. Yet I am far from denying
the beauty of Mr. WALPoLE's idea. The characters of
Trenchard, the self-doubting young Englishman, who finds
reality in his love for the nurse Marie Ivanovna, and of
the Russian doctor, Semyonov, who takes her from him,
are exquisitely realized. And the atmosphere of increasing
mental strain, in which, after Marie's death, the tragedy of
these three moves to its climax in the forest is the work of
an artist in emotion, such as by this time we know
Mr. WALPole to be. The trouble was that I had at the
moment no wish for artistry. To sum up, I am left with
the impression that an uncommonly good short story rather
tiresomely distracted my attention from some magnificent
war-pictures. -
As Field-Marshal Sir EvelyN Wood, V.C., in Our Fighting
Services (CAssELL), begins with the Battle of Hastings and
ends with the Boer War there is no gainsaying the fact
that his net has been widely spread. To assist him in the
compilation of this immense tome the author has a fluent
style and—to judge from the authorities consulted and
the results of these consultations—an inexhaustible in-
dustry. The one should make his book acceptable to the
amateur who reads history because he happens to love it,
and the other should make it invaluable to professionals
who handle books of reference, not lovingly, but of necessity.
And having said so much in praise of Sir EvelyN I am
also happy to add that he is, on the whole, that rare thing
—an historian without prejudices. Almost desperately, for
instance, he tries to express his admiration of OLIVER
CROMWELL as a soldier, although he quite obviously detests
him as a man. I find myself, however, wondering whether
Sir EvelyN, were he writing of CROMwFLL at this hour,
would say, “For a man over forty years of age to work
hard to acquire the rudiments of drill is in itself remark-

able.” Even when allowance is made for the differences
between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries there
would seem to be nothing very worthy of remark in such
energy if one may judge from the attitude of our War
Office to the Volunteers. Naturally one turns eagerly to
see what this distinguished soldier has to say about
campaigns in which he took a personal part, but, although
shrewd criticism is not *acking, Sir EVELYN's sword has
been more destructive than his pen. In these days of
tremendous events this volume may possibly be slow to
come to its own, but in due course it is bound to arrive.
I find, on referring to the “By the same Author” page of
The Lad With Wings (HUTCHINsoN), that other reviewers of
“BERTA RUck’s ” novels have been struck by the “charm"
of her work. I should like to be original, but I cannot
think of any better way of summing up the quality of her
was going to come of it. For my own part I suspected we
were in for yet another version of Cinderella, with Delia
snubbed by the smart guests, and eventually united, as
like as not, to young Lord Polwhele. However, Miss
DoRoth EA Townshend, who has written about all these
people in A Lion, A Mouse and a Motor Car (SIMPKIN),
had other and higher views for her heroine. True, the
house party was ultra-smart; true also that there was one
woman who spoke and behaved cattishly ; but it was a
refreshing novelty to find that throughout the tale the ugly
sisters, so to speak, were hopelessly outnumbered by the
fairy godmothers. Later, the visit led to Delia's going as
governess to the children of a Russian Princess, and find-
ing herself in circles that might be described as not only
fast but furious. Here we were in a fine atmosphere of
intrigue, with spies, and Grand Dukes, and explosive golf
balls and I don't know what beside. It is all capital
writing. Charm above every- - –
thing else is what The Lad --- ----, --
With Wings possesses. It is a
perfectly delightful book, mov-
ing at racing speed from the
first chapter to the last, and so . . . .
skilfully written that even the
technically unhappy ending
brings no gloom. When Gwenna
Williams and Paul Dampier,
the young airman she has mar-
ried only a few hours before the
breaking out of war, go down to
death together in mid-Channel
after the battle with the German
Taube, the reader feels with
, Leslie Long, Gwenna's friend,
“The best time to go out! No
growing old and growing dull. . .
No growing out of love with
each other, ever! They at least
have had something that noth-
ing can spoil.” I suppose that
when Mrs. OLIVER ONIONs is a gº,

fun ; and, though I am afraid
the political plots left me un-
convinced, the thing is told with
such ease and bonhomie that it
is saved from banality; even
when the amazing cat of the
house-party turns up as a female
bandit and tries to hold Delia
and her Princess to ransom.
And of course the fact that the
period of the tale is that of the
earliest motors gives it the
quaintest air of antiquity.
Somehow, talk of sedan chairs
would sound more modern than
these thrills of excitement about
six cylinders and “smelly
petrol.” In short, for many

provides a far brisker enter-
tainment than its cumbrous
title would indicate.

convey an impression of having written the whole story
at a sitting. The pace never flags for a moment, and
the characters are drawn with that apparently effortless
skill which generally involves anguish and the burning
of the midnight oil. I think I enjoyed the art of the
writing almost as much as the story itself. If you want
to see how a sense of touch can make all the difference,
you should study carefully the character of Leslie, a
genuine creation. But the book would be worth reading if
only for the pleasure of meeting Hugo Swayne, the intel-
lectual dilettante who, when he tried to enlist, was rejected
as not sufficiently intelligent and then set to painting
omnibuses in the Futurist mode, to render them invisible
at a distance. A few weeks from now I shall take down
The Lad With Wings from its shelf and read it all over
again. It is that sort of book.
When old Lady Polwhele asked the Reverend Dr. Gwyn
to let his daughter Delia go with her as companion to a
very smart house party, I doubt whether the excellent man
would have given so ready an assent had he known what
interpret Russian Christianity to the West. A pas-
sionate earnestness informs his discursive eloquence. I
cannot resist the conviction that he has the type of mind
that sees most easily what it wishes to see. He moves
cheerily along, incidentally raising difficulties which he
does not solve, ignoring conclusions which seem obvious,
throwing glorious generalisations and unharmonised contra-
dictions at the bewildered reader, too bent on his generous
purpose to glance aside for any explanations. Perhaps
this is the best method for an enthusiast to pursue. He
certainly creates a vivid picture of this strangely unknown
allied people, with its incredible otherworldliness, its broad
tolerant charity, its freedom from chilly conventions, its
joyous neglect of the hustle and fussiness of Western life,
its deep faith, its childish or childlike superstitions, the
glorious promise of its future. An interesting—even a
fascinating—rather than a conclusive book.

THE WORD OF A GERMAN.
You R troth was broken ere the trumpets blew ;
Into the fight with unclean hands you rode;
Your spurs were sullied and the sword you drew
Bore stain of outrage done to honour's code.
And you have played your game as you began.
Witness the white flag raised by shattered ranks,
The cry for mercy, answered, man to man—
And the swift stroke of traitor steel for thanks.
Once bitten we were twice a little shy,
And then forgot; but with the mounting score
Our old good-nature, tried a shade too high,
Stiffens its lip and means to stand no more.
So now, when you protest with bleating throat,
And broider round your wrongs a piteous tale,
Urging the Neutral Ones to take a note
That we have passed outside the human pale;
The world (no fool) will know where lies the blame
If England lets your pleadings go unheard;
To grace of chivalry you've lost your claim ;
We've grown too wise to trust a Bosch's word.

THE BILLETING CAPTAIN.
My job is to ride on ahead of the regiment, whenever we
leave the trenches, and secure accommodation for men and
horses in the place allotted to us. For billeting purposes
there are four kinds of villages behind our front: the good,
the indifferent, the positively bad, and the village of R -
It was to R that I was ordered on my first errand of
this kind. On the road I met a friend who holds the same
post in his regiment as I do in mine... I told him where I
was going, and he grinned. “You’ll find all the doors
locked when you arrive,” he said. “The Mayor is away
on service and you won't get any help from his wife.
She's the most disagreeable woman I ever met, and is
known for miles round as a holy terror.” When at length
I reached my destination I sent the rest of the party in
search of barns and stables, proceeding myself towards the
village pump, which I had been told was always a good
place to work from. But there was little sign of life here.
The place was deserted, except for one old man who was
supporting himself by the pump handle, while with a stick
in his other hand he tried to strafe a hen that had
inadvertently run between his legs.
“Bon jour, M'sieur,” I said by way of a start.
“Cigarette anglaise!” replied the patriarch. - -
I offered my case and was presently being entertained
with reminiscences of the war of soirante-dia. By the
time that he had finished his cigarette he had gone further
back into history and was vividly describing the retreat
from Moscow under the First Napoleon, on which occasion
I gathered that he had caught a severe cold. There was
evidently little help to be gained here, so leaving my vener-
able friend amid the Russian snows I went to the nearest
house and knocked. Presently a key turned and the door
was opened for about three inches by an old woman.
“Bon jour, Madame,” I said in my best French; “I seek
a bedroom, if possible one with a bed in it.”
She looked me up and down for a moment, then with
a “Pas compris” shut and locked the door again.
In the next house they were more obliging. A stout
gentleman opened the door and informed me that unfor-
tunately he possessed only one bed, which was shared by
himself and his family of six children. But as M'sieu was
a member of the entente, and if he could find no other
accommodation But here I fled. Thus it was from
house to house, and when later my N.C.O. reported his
arrangements for men and horses satisfactory I had only
managed to secure one miserable little room. So desperate
had I become by this time that I determined to face the
Mayor's wife, in spite of my friend's advice. Accordingly
I turned towards a house labelled Mairie, and entered the
garden, where a small child was playing. I think without
exception he was the ugliest little boy I have ever seen,
but I am a father when home on leave, and he smiled at
me in such a nice friendly way that I stopped and pecked
at his cheek as I passed.
When I looked up I saw a grim face regarding me over
a pot of geraniums in the window. “Now for it!” I
thought, and was presently face to face with the formidable
lady, who asked me in broken English what my business
might be. “Madame,” I said, “you see a ruined captain
before you, I have been sent to this village to find twelve
bedrooms for my Colonel and brother-officers. Also a
mess-room and an office. In one hour I have secured one
room, and even now the regiment is arriving,” for as I
spoke the O.C. and some of the others came riding up. On
seeing me they dismounted, and before Madame could say
anything she and I were the centre of a little group of
officers. -
“Well,” said the O.C., “what luck?
forward to real beds again, I can tell you!”
I felt myself growing red. “The men and horses are
arranged for, Sir,” I stammered, and then suddenly a
voice at my side took up the tale: “And if you will come
wiz me I shall 'elp ze Captain to show to you ze rocms 'e
'as found.” Unable to utter a word, I bowed, and we
followed Madame to the first house at which I had earlier
tried so unsuccessfully. She knocked at the door like a
fury, and no sooner was it opened than she went in with-
out more ado, and we after her. “I have come to show
M'sieu the Colonel the room that you have prepared for
him,” she said in her own language to the old woman, who
stood bowing and smiling as hard as she could. Then she
opened a door and took us into the nicest room imaginable.
“’Ere I 'ope you will be 'appy, my Colonel,” she con-
tinued. “Zis is ze best room ze Captain could find for
you. Also I 'ope you will find Madame aimable;" and
here she looked at the old woman, who started bowing
again harder than ever. It was the same at all the other
houses. Passing from one to another she commandeered
room after room, even managing to wrest a bed from the
father of six; and I verily believe that the inhabitants
would have burned their dwellings to warm us had the
little lady ordered it. All the while she maintained the
fiction that I had arranged things previously.
“I 'ave just come wiz ze Captain to see everyting ees
what you call spick,” she said on leaving us.
“And a very good business you have made of it," said
the O.C. to me approvingly. Still greatly puzzled, I
returned to thank my benefactress. After expressing my
gratitude I ventured to tell her that she had been much
kinder to me than I had been led to expect.
“But 'ave I not see you kees my little son 2" she
said gravely. -
“Ah,” I said to myself, “that's it!” and, stooping down
to where he was playing, I did it again with added warmth.

A propos, there's quite a good little

One of the literally burning questions
of the moment has been how to dispose

people have given their motors to the

where. Your Blanche has solved the
difficulty and at the same time set a
fashion. My evening boots (what a

what it once had, my Daphne !) have
darling little teeny-weeny lamps fixed
to their toes, so that one can see

And so Pegwell went on with his
drives, and one day they were out
so long that his mother was anxious,
and when at last they came back she
said, “Oh, Thompson, you've been
driving Lord Pegwell too far; he's not
strong enough for such long drives; it
was very inconsiderate of you, Thomp-
son.” And the chauffeuse tossed up
her chin and cried, “Not so much
“Thompson,' please!” And Pegwell
chipped in with, “This is Lady Pegwell,
mother, and in future she'll drive no
one but me!”
Popsy, Lady Ramsgate, is even more
furious about it than his parents.
“Ramsgate and Elizabeth have be-
haved like fools,” she said to me
yesterday; “they don't know their
world in the least, though they've lived
in it nearly half a century. What if
the minx wasn't particularly young and
pretty. A chauffeuse is a novelty,
and when you've said that you've said
everything.” -
Your Blanche is enormously busy
just now editing a book that's going
to be the sensation of the Spring crop
of volumes. You're aware, of course,
m'amie, that if a book's even to be
looked at now it must be either Some-
body's Memories of Everybody Else or
Somebody's Experiences in an Enemy
Country. Well, and so Stella Clack-
mannan and I, in the hostel we run for
poor dears who've lost their situations
abroad and have no friends to go to on
coming back here, found among our
guests a bright little Cockney who's
been what she calls an up-and-down
girl in the Royal Palace at Bashbang,
the capital of Rowdydaria. My dearest,
the things that girl has climbed over
and crawled under, and the weather
she's come through, in escaping from
the Rowdydarians and getting back
here! And the things she's seen and
heard in the Palace It will throw a
flood of light on all sorts of things, and
will certainly make our F.O. sit up.
With the help of a clever photogra-
pher and some imagination we've
reconstructed the up-and-down girl's
adventures quite nicely. There are
photos of the King of Rowdydaria as
head of his own army; in his uniform
as Colonel of the Hun Räuberund-
mörder Regiment; and in the Arab
burnous in which he is to lead an
attack on Egypt. There's a photo of
the up-and-down girl sweeping a pas-
sage and listening through a key-hole
to a wonderful conversation between
the King of R. and an Emperor who'd
come to see him (luckily it was in
English and she remembers every
word): “You’ve got to say you did

couldn't have done it.” “I’ll give you
the submarine that did it—or lend it
to you. There! now it's yours—for a
time. You don't depend on the Neu-
tralians for any supplies. So you can
afford to tell them you did it—and be
quick about it.” “But you can't ex-
pect even the Neutralians to swallow
that!” “Why, you fool, they'd swallow
anything! That's the meaning of their
phrase ‘rubber-neck.’”. There 's a
photo of the Queen of Rowdydaria
coming up at this point, snatching
the broom away, and beating the up-
and-down girl with it, and calling her

dear, it's positively enthralling! Order

XXXV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Things go on
here from day to day in a businesslike
and orderly fashion, the comic relief
being supplied by a temporary, very
temporary, man from overseas, who has
operated for a while at our telephone
exchange. Most people, myself included,
are overawed by the dignity and signi-
ficance of our environment here; not
so this Canadian. One of our very
greatest was having words with his in-
strument the other evening. He sup-
posed, wrongly, that his antagonist was
a hundred kilometres away, and he
adjusted his remarks and voice accord-
ingly. Imagine his pain on being in-
formed, from the exchange, in quite a
cheerful and friendly tone, “I guess
you're on the wrong string this time,
Mister.”
There is also, of course, that never-
failing source of satisfaction, the mili-
tary mess waiter. I think ours, the
other night, excelled all starters in the
art of ellipsis. Our meal was inter-
rupted by a loud bump, crash, cata-
clysm and bang. We took it that two
at least of the enemy's great offensives
had begun, centralising on us and open-
ing with the destruction of all our
mess machinery, personnel and platter.
Shortly afterwards Alfred, slightly
flushed, came into the room. We
asked him to let us know the worst.
All we could get out of him was, “I
must 'a' trod on a bit o' fat, Sir.”
You will be touched, I am sure, by
the pretty story now current concern-
ing the earnest young subaltern and the
Brigadier. The former was responsible
for the training of an expert section, in
no matter what particular black art;
the latter called in person one morning
to witness an experimental display.
The apparatus was produced, the Brig.
adier inspected it delicately, and the
section was fallen in, standing near by
in an attitude of modest pride. From
them the Brigadier eventually singled
out a private to do a star turn; silence
was enjoined while the subaltern should
give the private the necessary detail
orders. Now the subaltern was one of
the many of us civilians who have a
burning ambition not only to achieve
perfection always, but also to maintain
on all occasions a superlatively military
bearing. Confronted by the private
and expected to order him about, he
hesitated, blushed and at last made it
clear that he simply must, before be-
ginning, have a few words apart in the
General's private ear. With kindly
toleration the General eventually con-
ceded this, and it was then made more
than apparent to him why it was
that the earnest young subaltern was
reluctant to give his orders to the
private without some explanation in
advance to the Brigadier. “The man's
surname is Bhyll, Sir,” he whispered.
Red-hats may not always know
much about life in the trenches, but
they can tell you at first hand what
strafing was like when there were no
trenches to live in. You will perhaps
care to hear of an adventure of the
good old days, when men wandered
about Flanders on their own, sometimes
attaching themselves to English units,
sometimes to French, and sometimes
marching inadvertently with the Central
Powers. Maps in those days didn't
show you clearly which was your bit
and which was the other fellow's, and
many a time different parties, meeting
in the dark, would be quite affable in
passing, little knowing it was each
other's blood they were aſter. My
man, at the moment when we take up
the narrative, was walking about in a
wood, looking for a job. Half an hour
earlier he had been busily engaged in a
brisk battle, but, owing to his not keep-
ing his mind on it, he'd got detached
and now found himself in one of those
peculiarly peaceful solitudes which
only exist in the heart of the war zone.
Whether the battle was over and, if
so, who'd won it, he couldn't say. In
fact, those being the early confused
days, he didn't rightly know whether
it had been a battle at all or just a little
personal unpleasantness between him-
self and his private enemies. Every-
thing appeared to be exactly as it should
not be; he felt that he ought to be
exhilarated with victory or depressed
with defeat, exhausted or maimed, and
with mud.
along in a wood, just as he might do at
home, smoking a cigarette and thinking
that this would be a most convenient
moment for a wash and a cup of tea.
As he said, the very last thing he
seemed to be at was war, when sud-
denly, climbing over a small ridge, he
discovered himself face to face with a
hostile sentry, and near him were, at
repose, a knot of other equally repul-
sive Bosches.
It has struck everyone out here,
sooner or later, that it is easy enough
to do the thing if only one could know
at the moment what is the thing to do.
Here was a sentry whose whole recent
education had been devoted to learning
exactly how to deal with new and
unwelcome arrivals. He was furnished
for that very purpose with a rifle
having a carefully sharpened bayonet
at one end of it and a nice new bullet
at the other. There he was, all pre-
pared to deal with an emergency, and
not merely covered from top to toe
He found himself walking
there was the emergency confronting
him. Having had a good look at it, he
contented himself with saying “Halt 1
wer da 3" adding as an afterthought
a threatening move forward.
On the other hand, here was our
friend, young and vigorous, in full
possession of all his faculties, too sur-
prised to be even alarmed. His first
tendency was to pass haughtily on or,
at the most, to stop and tell the man
to be more respectful when addressing
an officer. His second was to call to
mind, in a confused mess, all the
brilliant and dashing things a hero
of fiction would, without a moment's
hesitation, havo done in the circum-
stances. Lastly, it was borne in on him
that this was indeed a German ; that
all Germans were, under the new ar-
rangement, sworn to do in all English-
men at sight, and that he himself was,
beneath his mud, one of the last-named.
Being rather the quicker-witted of the
two, he had put in three thoughts to
the other fellow's one; but the position
showed no improvement in the result,
and the enemy's second thought, slowly
dawning, was obviously of a more
practical and drastic nature. His un-
decided fidgeting with his rifle made
this abundantly clear. No time was
to be lost. Our friend realised dimly
that at all costs he must conceal his
nationality. This promised to be a
matter of languages, never his strong
point. But, there again, he was care-
fully prepared with a series of useful
phrases in various tongues, which he
had learnt up in small and inexpensive
hand-books. The difficulty was to get
on to the right one; his mind, having
got him thus far, refused further assist-
ance. Instead of furnishing him with
the appropriate remark, it merely sug-
gested to him a clearly defined picture
of the outside of the text-book, par-
ticularly emphasizing the elegant but
inept phrase, “One Shilling net at all
Booksellers.” And what was the use
of that with the sentry's bayonet
rapidly coming to the “On guard”
position ?
It's a long story, Charles, and it
ended by our friend ingenuously stating
by way of a seasonable ruse, “Pardon,
monsieur, je suis français.”
I'd prefer to leave it at that, but
you are one of those detestable people
who insist on going on after the climax.
So I may as well tell you that at this
point our friend's legs took to action
on their own, no doubt remarking to
themselves as they did so that this
was but another instance of damned
bad Staff work. I sometimes wonder
whether possibly it isn't easier to be
a limb than a brain.
Yours ever, HENRY.

LITERARY PITFALLS.
The Chronicle publishes a most inter-
esting letter received from Mr. G. B.
BURGIN, who lately, if our memory
serves us right, completed his fiftieth
novel. He writes:–
“A hitch has arisen about the publication
of my novel, The IRubber Princess. It deals
with an air raid on London, etc., and it has
been pointed out to me that if it appears before
the War is over it will probably be suppressed,
and that I shall be mulcted in pains and
penalties. I have therefore withdrawn it and
substituted (for the Spring), with Hutchinsons,
The Hut by the River, of which I have great
hopes. It is a Canadian romance, with a
pretty love story and a nice little mystery at
the end.”
It will, we are sure, be a consolation |
to Mr. BURGIN, to whose agility and
versatility we desire to render our
homage, to learn that he is not singular
in his experience.

It appears that Mr. Posh, a man of
a most scientific imagination, assigned
the rôle of hero in his story to a mar-
vellous automaton. Unfortunately for
him he was not content with general-
ities, but described the process by
which this artificial superman was pro-
duced in such minute detail that his
publishers realised that it might be
positively prejudicial to our safety to
make it known. The sequel had best
be told in Mr. Posh's own pathetic
words:–

a happy inspiration seized me as I was ascend-
ing the escalator at Charing Cross, and in
exactly a fortnight I had finished another
novel, entirely divorced from the present, en-
| titled, In Dear Old Daffy-land. It is an idyllic
story of Suffolk in the days of the Heptarchy,
founded on an ancestral tradition of the Posh
family. It runs to about 60,000 words, and
it the finest thing I have done.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted From THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
THE LAST CHAPTER.
House of Commons, Tuesday, 15th
February.—After, on nomination of my
revered master, Mr. Punch, represent-
ing Barkshire in the Commons during
three reigns, under nine Parliaments,
captained in succession by six Premiers,
come to conclusion that I have earned
the right to retire. Two ways of
voluntarily vacating a seat. One by a
call to the Lords. The other by applica-
tion for Chiltern Hundreds. Not having
heard anything about the Peerage, have
adopted latter course. The MEMBER
For SARK, loyal to the last, insists on
following my example.
Accordingly, when House meets to-
morrow, writs will be moved for elec-
tions to fill two vacancies. In ordinary
times this would lead to interesting
episode. Customary for the Chief
Party Whip to move for writ to fill
casual vacancies in his ranks. Would
the Ministerial Whip or the Opposi-
tion Whip come forward to take pre-
liminary step for elections consequent
on retirement of the MEMBER FOR
BARRs and the MEMBER For SARK ?
The closest observer of Parliamentary
procedure or comment is not sure
whether in Party politics they are
Liberals or Conservatives. Cannot
indeed say on which side of the House
they sit. As it happens there is at
this doubly memorable date no division
of parties, consequently no contending
Whips. Writs for Barks and Sark will
accordingly be appropriately moved by
Whip representing united House.
Thirty-five years ago Barks first
sent me to Westminster. Of Cabinet
Ministers then seated on Treasury
Bench none are alive to-day. GLAD-
stos E, just returned by overwhelming
majority, was Premier; GRANVILLE,
with consummate skill and dainty
humour, led minority supporting Gov-
ernment in House of Lords; HARcourt
was at the Home Office; HARTINGTON,
Secretary of State for War; CHILDERs
at the Treasury; KIMBERLEY at the
India Office; at the Irish Office ForstER,
with his rumpled hair, his rugged
speech and his gruff manner, “the
best Stage Yorkshireman of his time.”
Much history has been made since
that time. Procedure in the Commons
has been revolutionised, with the result
not only of accelerating ordinary busi-
ness and leading to final issue con-
troversies futilely raging for years, but
radically altering personal tone and
manner of Mother of Parliaments.
That is another story, too lengthy to
be told here. Glad to know I was
intimately acquainted with the House!
and, with rare exceptions, with the
principal personages in either political
camp through a long stretch of older,
more picturesque time. . .
I close the Diary here, not because I
am tired of writing it, nor, as continu-
ous testimony indicates, because a
generous public is tired of reading. But
I am not disposed to linger superfluous
on the stage. So I withdraw, carrying
with me my little bag of tricks, the
sententious Dog, the cynical SARK and
the rest of the contents.
Henceforward some new form will
be given to the “Essence of Parlia-
ment” which was created by SHIRLEY
BRooks, and enlivened by the hand of
ToM TAYLOR.
Business done.—Toby, M.P.'s.
A DIRTY NIGHT.
THE night is starless, with a darkness
so enveloping that it seems to possess
palpability. As we reel westward in a
smother of water the miracle of how
any human being equipped with but
five senses can find and keep his course
in the chartless void that envelops us
smites me afresh.
A longing for an atmosphere unim-
pregnated with petrol eventually sends
me stumbling up the companion-way
to the deck. Gripping the rail, I make
my way forward, and, peering through
the mirk, distinguish a huddled figure
in a sou'wester. Aloof, detached, he
steers the shrewdest, swiſtest path ever
carved through a wall of blackness on
behalf of dependent fellow-creatures.
“A wild night,” I shout.
IIe turns slightly and answers in a
hoarse bellow, “The better for us,
mister. Keeps the track clear. Ought
to get in allead o' time.”
The yellow glare from our lights
glances in broken splashes of colour
over the waters, as the squat craft
heaves and rolls with rhythmic regu-
larity. From somewhere below comes
the monotonous throb of the protesting
engines. A red light gleams suddenly
on our starboard, and I catch my breath.
AEons pass, it seems, before a panther-
like clutch at the wheel carries us aside
in time to let the offender plunge
drunkenly past. We were near enough
to throw a biscuit on her deck. A swift
exchange of badinage follows.
“Lost yer job o' puntin'
barges?”
“Yuss—they're usin' donkey-power
instead. I give in your name 'fore I
leſt, but they 'adn't a spare stable.”
After which, the immediate danger
past, we plough our way down a
blurred track on either side of which
lurks Peril in a hundred grim and
invisible shapes.
coal -
The temperature, already low, has
begun to drop steadily, and a fine
drizzle yields to a penetrating chilli-
ness which finds its way to one's
very marrow. I am glad of my heavy
wraps, and inclined, indeed, to envy
the huddled figure, whose coverings
are still heavier. Inwardly I wonder
what this clashing of the Nations has
meant to him : whether he has wife
and children; whether he keeps their
portraits in some deep-buried pocket
beneath that accumulation of clothing
which engulfs him to the ear-tips.
I am still speculating when a second
figure, moving with the easy gait of
one whose feet have trodden many
decks, climbs the companion-way and
comes forward in leisurely fashion. The
fellow is no stranger; already, as I
came on board, I had a glimpse of that
grizzled, masterful jaw and keen eyes.
IIe peers past me towards his mate.
“IElf l’’ -
“Yuss 2"
“Seed any fink o' young'Arry lately?’
“Not me!”
“Well, I 'ear'e done a bit in the lead-
slingin' line at a place called Wipeis,
an' they 've been an' stuck some sort
o' French medal on is chest.”
“Blighter owes me fourpence, any-
way,” roars Elf; and I infer that
neither of them has a high opinion
of 'Arry's character from the civilian
point of view.
Follows an interval filled with small
confused sounds—the staccato note of
a bell, the soft thud of a passenger's
body as he is jerked unexpectedly
against the rail, the picturesque ripple
of his expostulations with Providence.
A lamp, burning with unusual and
illegal garishness, gives me light enough
to examine my watch. It indicates
the proximity of midnight. I realize
that I am incredibly stiff and cold, and
am tormented by visions of unattain-
able comforts.
At last I am conscious of a line of
dimmed lights, of a distant roar of
escaping steam, of a violent quivering
motion that indicates the slackening
of speed. We come to a sudden halt.
The voice of Elf rises triumphant.
“Bill "
“Yuss 2'"
“Two minutes arter
“Knowed we'd do it !”
And as I stumble blindly forth it is
borne upon me that the last Ealing
motor-'bus has ended her journey with
five minutes to spare.

A CONTROVERSY.
(From Our Own Correspondent in America.)
I.
YESTERDAY President WILsoN addressed a monster
gathering of business men at Ponkapog. He said that it
was a cruel misconception to hold that Americans were
without ideals. As a matter of fact they cherished their
ideals far beyond any question of making money and would
die rather than submit to acts which were an outrage on
our common humanity. In declaring that there was such
a thing as being too proud to fight he had, of course, meant
that there was such a thing as being only too proud to
fight for what was just and right. This was the American
attitude, and he therefore advocated national preparedness
which might possibly imply -
such an increase in America's
naval and military forces as
few people except himself had
yet dreamt of. At this point
the audience rose en masse
and cheered for ten minutes.
Nothing could show more
clearly than this speech how
intensely critical are the rela-
tions between America and
Germany over the Lusitania
case. There has been a wild
panic on the New York Stock
Exchange. A prominent
banker has expressed the
opinion that Count BERN-
storFF will receive his pass-
ports to-morrow.

called on Mr. LANsiNg to-day.
This is considered a symp-
tom of the utmost gravity,

versy has been narrowed down to the use or omission of

At this vigorous denunciation the whole audience rose and
cheered for a quarter of an hour.
V.
The situation is easier. Count BERNstoRFF has declared
in an interview that the German Government is prepared
to accept the American formula if the word “legality” be
substituted for the word “illegality.” Germany would
thus admit the legality of the torpedoing of the Lusitania
and express regret at the death of American citizens.
Count BERNstorFF points out that Germany has thus gone
very far towards meeting the American demand. He hopes
and believes that two great civilised nations will not fall
out over so small a matter as the use or omission of the
two letters i, l, at the beginning of a long word.
VI.
Mr. LANsing has in a polite
note expressed himself un-
able to accept Count BERN-
storFF's offer as a full satis-
faction of America's demands.
The sands are evidently run-
ning out, and there is serious
danger of the negotiations
proving abortive. In the
meantime a sharp Note has

in regard to her interference
with American commerce.

though she is willing to make a formal expression of regret
at the death of American citizens, whom, she is ready to
declare, she did not intend to destroy. Colonel Roosevelt

Manufacturers. He said no touch of infamy or feebleness
had been omitted by the present Administration in their
conduct of negotiations with Germany. They had per-
formed the miracle of causing every true American to blush
for his country. When you met a rattlesnake you didn't
waste time in arguing with it or flattering it. Your duty
was to shoot it or knock it on the head, or, preferably, to
employ both methods in order to rid the world of a danger.

AT THE PLAY.
“CAROLINE.”
A BABY, did he but know it, is only
happy reaching out from the bath for
the soap. When he gets it, lo! it is
mere froth and bitterness. That,
roughly, is Mr. MAUGHAM's idea in
Caroline.
If you are to love a woman, for
heaven's sake, says he, take care that
she be safe bound beyond your reach.
All attainment is dead-sea fruit. But
how is anyone to believe this depressing
sort of doctrine when the woman in
question is such an engaging divinity
as his Caroline Ashley, interpreted by
Miss IRENE VANBRUGH at the very top
of her form 2 The doctrine,
indeed, may be hanged for
the nefarious half - truth it
is ; but this would still leave
you free to appreciate one
of the most brilliant and
finished pieces of work which
Mr. MAUGHAM has yet done
for the stage. True, it is
merely an airy trifle; but it
is almost perfect of its kind.
The action opens on the
morning of the announce-
ment in The Times of the
death of Caroline's extremely
difficult husband, who has
long been a wanderer seek-
ing spirituous consolations
in out-of-the-way places of
the earth. Robert Oldham, a
quite delightful barrister (Mr.
LEONARD BoyNE; so you
will understand the “delight-
ful”), has worshipped Caro-
line with an honourable
fidelity for ten years, waiting
patiently for the day on
which she shall be free.
Well, here is the long-desired day.
Affectionate, officious friends come to
congratulate each of the pair before
they meet, and each confesses to a
curious chilling sense of dread. When
the embarrassing moment of the tete-
d-téte arrives, Robert, obviously ill-at-
ease and apparently more as a matter
of duty than of eager conviction, sug-
gests that Caroline shall name the day.
She gives him a blank refusal. Both
affect dismay at this queer ending of
their long-deferred hopes, but event-
ually confess, mid peals of their own
happy laughter, their actual relief. So
ends the first chapter.
A later hour of the same day finds
our heroine on her sofa, languid from
the morning's emotions, and indulging
in the luxury of not feeling at all well.
Her world is crumbling. She cannot
do without a slave, and Robert can no
longer fill quite the old rôle. Clearly a
matter for counsel with her physician his accustomed part of loyal friend and
and friend, Dr. Cornish (Mr. DION |incense-bearer. She accordingly pro-
BoucICAULT), who pleasantly diagnoses |poses. Appreciating the difficulty of
middle-age and prescribes a young directly refusing without discourtesy,

more nicely calculated to restore her
lost feeling of queenly &omplicancy.
She sends for young Rex Cunningham
(Mr. MARTIN LEwis), a morbid egoist,
who nourishes a hopeless passion for
her (and others), being well aware of
the paramount claims of Robert. She
contrives to let him know that she is
free, and the youth, whose pet hobby
is hopeless passion, at once sheers off
in alarm. Caroline is learning—is be-
ginning to understand the dark philo-
sophy of Mr. SomeRSET MAUGHAM. In

despair she again turns to Robert. They
become engaged and promptly begin
quarrelling about their houses. He
objects to her Futurist bathroom ; she
to his, which is so like a tube station
that she would bathe in constant appre-
hension of the sudden appearance of a
young man demanding tickets. Robert
begins to assert his masculine rights to
control these and sundry matters. She
realises (oh, venerable gag of the
cynics!) that the fetters which would
unite their bodies would put a barrier
between their souls. The engagement
is by mutual consent declared off.
Realising, however, in Chapter III.,
that she needs Robert's devotion more
than anything else, she conceives a
plot. Dr. Cornish makes an opportune
call, not this time as a doctor, but as
a whole-hearted admirer. With just
such an one for my husband, thinks
Caroline, Robert could again assume

he temporises and appears to fall in
with her suggestion that he shall
announce their engagement to Robert
and her interfering friends, who are
promptly telephoned for to hear an
interesting statement. But Cornish
proves himself a Wolff in sheep's
clothing. Instead of announcing the
engagement he asserts that he has just
seen Stephen Ashley, the husband: a
lie which obtains credence with the
others because of the dead man's
amiable habit of occasionally putting
about a rumour of his decease. Caro-
line, with superb presence
of mind, seeing a glorious
way out of a dilemma, adopts
the lie, contrives a more or
less plausible explanation,
and thus establishes the
status quo ante—the grass
widow with the faithful and
contented adorer.
The play, whose only flaw
was a certain rather upset-
ting ambiguity (whether acci-
dental or designed I could not
quite gather) in the last few
sentences before the curtain
fell, was interpreted with a
very fine intelligence. Miss
IRENE VANBRUGH's superbly
trained talent showed itself
in an astonishing range of
moods tethered in a plausible
unity of conception. Mr.
BoyNE, who is just coming
into his own, scored bull
after bull. Perhaps he didn't
make Oldham quite the Eng-
lishman that the author (I
- should say) designed, but
rather an Irishman of that delightfully
faint flavour which is so entirely at-
tractive. Miss LILLAH MACARTHY, as
Maude Fulton, a well-preserved bachelor
in the most bizarre modern mode, also
a dexterous liar and officious match-
maker, played with her head in her
most accomplished manner and gave
full value in the general scheme to a
character which the author made a per-
son when he might have been content
with a peg. Mr. DION Boucicault's
physician was as bland a humbug as
ever coined guineas in Mayfair. Mr.
MARTIN LEwis, as a profoundly silly
ass, played a difficult hand without
fault. Miss NINA SEVENING, as a con-
soler of handsome men in trouble, and
Miss FLORENCE LLoyd, as Caroline's

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE evolution of the long novel appears to be following
that of the human race. Instead of the individual, the
family now threatens to become the central unit. I confess
that this prospect, as evidenced by Three Pretty Men
(METHUEN), fills me with some just apprehension. Mr.
GILBERT CANNAN has set out to tell how a Scotch family,
three brothers, a mother, and some sisters in the back-
ground, determines to make its fortune in a South Lanca-
shire city (very recognisable under the name of Thrigsby),
and how eventually all but one of them succeed. It is a
long book and a close; and the dialogue (which of its
kind is good dialogue, crisp and illuminating), being printed
without the usual spacing, produces an indigestible-looking
page that might well alarm a reader out for enjoyment.
The book, in its record of the progress of the three,
Jamie and Tom and John, is really more a study of social
conditions in mid-Victorian Manchester than a work of
imagination. But there is clever character-drawing in
it, especially in Jamie, who from a worldly point of view
is the failure of the group, making no money, and drift-
ing through journalism to emigration ; and in the finely
suggested figure of Tibby, the ill-favoured kitchen drudge,
who is his real centre of inspiration. But first and last
it remains a dull business, partly from an entire lack of
humour, partly from the absence of any settled plan that
might help one to endure the dreariness of the setting. Mr.
CANNAN certainly knows his subject, and few novels indeed
have given me, rightly or wrongly, a greater suggestion of
——
autobiography. But for once the art of being exhaustive
without being exhausting seems to have eluded him.
If you want really to get a picture of war as she is
waged by an obscure unit in the thick of the dirtiest,
dampest and most depressing part, read PATRICK MACGILL's
The Red Horizon (JENKINs). Here we meet the author of
The Children of the Dead End and The Rat Pit as Rifleman
3008 of the London Irish, involved in the grim routine of
the firing line—reliefs, diggings and repairs, sentry-go's,
stand-to's, reserves, working and covering parties, billets;
and so da capo. With a rare artistic intuition, instead of
diffusing his effects in a riot of general impressions, he has
confined himself to a record of the doings of his section,
and I have read nothing that gives anything near so
convincing an impression of the truth, at once splendid and
bitter. It is a privilege to be shown, through the medium
of an imaginative temperament, the fine comradeship of
the trenches, the heroism that shines through the haunting
fear of death, mostly conquered with a laugh, but some-
times frankly expressed in the pathetic desire for a
“blighty" wound—a wound just serious enough to send the
envied hero home. You won't get much of the Romance
of War out of this strong piece of work, except the jolly
sort of romance of the little Cockney, Bill, who, when the
regiment in reserve was crouching in the trench under
heavy shelling, cheered it by delivering himself character-
istically as follows: “If I kick the bucket don't put a
cross with ‘’E died for 'is King and Country' over me. A
bully beef tin at my 'ead will do, and—‘’E died doin'
fatigues on an empty stomach.’”

how he could have got much

ment of The Blows of Circum-
stance waned towards the end
and the book seemed to me to
lose grip, it was because the
sudden discovery on the part
of Quinn and Amalie Gayne
that they were soul-mates was
too sudden to convince me.
Up to the beginning of the
trial the story has vigour and
an air of probability, with its
careful building-up of Amalie's
curious character and the vivid

description of her life on the #

MY WAR STORIES.
Did you ever try to write War stories? I am not
alluding to Press telegrams from Athens, Amsterdam or
Copenhagen, but legitimate magazine fiction. Once I
was reasonably competent and could rake in my modest
share of War profits. But recently Clibbers, of the Inter-
national Fiction Syndicate, approached me and said, “Old
man, do me some War stuff. Anything you like, but it
must have a novel climax." -
“Not in a War story,” I protested.
“Can you deliver the goods?” said Clibbers sternly.
After that what could I do but alter the stories I had in
stock.
For example there was my fine story, “Retrieved.” The
innocent convict (would that I had the happy innocence
of the convict of fiction') emerges from Portmoor. In a few
well-chosen words the genial old prison governor (to avoid
libel actions I hasten to say that no allusion is made to
any living person) advises the released man to make a
new career. The convict marches to the recruiting office
and enlists. In a couple of paragraphs he is at the Front;
on the second page he saves the Colonel's life, captures a
German trench on page three, and in less time than it takes
to do it gains the V.C., discovers the villain dying repentant
with a full confession in his left puttee, and embraces the
girl who chanced to be Red-Crossing in the rear of the
German position—presumably having arrived there by
aeroplane. This seemed to me both probable and credible
in a magazine. Still a novel climax was needed. After the
few well-chosen words from the prison governor I took the
convict to the nearest public-house, let him discover tha;
the new restrictions were in force, and brought the sto
to a novel conclusion by making him say with oaths to the
recruiting officer that he would be jiggered if ever he
formed fours for such a rotten old country.
I thought that, at any rate, I had provided one surprise
for my readers. Then I turned to my psychological
study, entitled “The Funk.” There wasn't much story
in this, but a good deal about a man's sensations when in
danger. I could picture the horror of it from personal
experience, for my rear rank man has nearly brained me
a dozen times when the specials have bayonet drill (I
also have nearly brained—but I am wandering from the
subject). Well, the Funk at the critical moment ran away,
but, being muddled by German gas clouds, ran straight into
the German lines. He thought that people were trying
to intercept his flight. In panic he cut them down.
At the last moment he cut the CrowN PRINCE's smile in
twain. (In fiction, mark you, it is quite allowable to put
the CrowN PRINCE into the firing line). Then came glory,
the D.C.M. and a portrait of some one else with the
Funk's name attached in The Daily Snap. However,
novelty was needed. I concluded by leaving the Funk
hiding in a dug-out when the British charged and eating
the regiment's last pot of strawberry jam.
I turned to another romance, entitled “Secret Service,”
and found to my joy that this needed very little alteration.
The hero chanced to be in Germany at the outset cf the
war. He was imprisoned at Ruhleben, Potsdam, Dantzic,
Frankfort and Wilhelmshaven. He escaped from these
places by swimming the Rhine (thrice), the Danube, the
Meuse, the Elbe, the Vistula, the Bug, the Volga, the Kiel
Canal and Lake Geneva. He chloroformed, sandbagged,
choked and gagged sentinels throughout the length and
breadth of Germany. From under a railway carriage seat
he overheard a conversation between ENVER BEY and
BERNHARDI. Concealed beneath a pew at a Lutheran
church he heard Count ZEP. and voN TIRP. exchanging
deadly secrets. Finally he emerged from a grandfather's
clock as the KAIs ER was handing the CrowN PRINCE some
immensely important documents, snatched them, stole an
aeroplane, bombed a Zeppelin or two on his homeward
way, and landed exhausted at Lord KitchENER's feet.
Here came the change. Instead of opening the parcel to
discover the plans of the German staff, the WAR SECRETARY
found in his hand this document —
“Sausage Prices in Berlin: Pork Sausage, 3 marks 80 pſ.;
Horse Sausage, 3 marks 45 pf.; Dog Sausage, 2 marks 95 pf.
Gott mit uns.—WILHELM.”
I sent the three romances to Clibbers and waited his
reply with anxiety. It came promptly and as follows:–
“Are you mad?–CLIBBERs.”
Instantly I sent him the first versions of these mag-
nificent fictions. He phoned me at once, “That's the
kind of novelty I want. Send me some more.”
You will see “Retrieved,” “The Funk,” and “Secret
Service" in the magazines shortly. Don't trouble if the
titles differ. After all, there are only three genuine War
story plots.

ANOTHER AIR SCANDAL.
IF ever I write a Hymn of Hate, or,
at any rate, of resentment, it will not
be about the Germans, but about a
certain type of Englishman whom I
encounter far too often and shall never
understand.
beyond any hymning, however fervent;
they are, it is reassuring to think, a
class by themselves. But my man
should be hymned, not because it will
do him any good, but because it relieves
my feelings.
It is really rather a curious case, for
he might be quite a nice fellow and, I
have little doubt, often is; but he boasts
and flaunts an inhuman insensibility
that excites one's worst passions.
What would you say was the quality
or characteristic most to be desired in
every member of our social common-
wealth 2 Obviously there is only one
reply to this question: that he should
be decently susceptible to draughts. If
society is to go on, either we must all
be so pachydermatous as to be able
to disregard draughts, or we must
feel them and act accordingly. There
should not be here and there a strange
Ishmaelite creature whose delight it
is to be played upon by boreal blasts.
The Germans are now ||
But there is. I meet him in the train,
and the other day I hymned him.
O thou (my hymn of dislike, of annoy-
ance, of remonstrance began):-
O thou, the foe of comfort, heat,
O thou who hast the corner seat,
Facing the engine, as we say
(Although it is so far away,
And in between
So many coaches intervene,
The phrase partakes of foolishness);-
O thou who sittest there no less,
Keeping the window down
Though all the carriage frown,
Why dost thou so rejoice in air?
Not air that mourishes and braces,
Such as one finds in watering-places,
But air to chill a polar bear—
Malignant air at sixty miles an hour
That rakes the carriage fore and aft,
Wherein we cower;
Not air at all, but sheer revengeful
draught !
How canst thou like it? Say! How canst
thou do it 2
Thou even read'st a paper through it !
Know'st thou no pain?
Sciatica or rheumatism
Leading to balm or sinapism 2
Doth influenza pass thee by?
Hast never cold or bloodshot eye
Like ordinary Christian folk
Who sit in draughts against their will
And pray they'll not be ill?
Even in tunnels (this is past a joke)
Thou car'st no rap
Nor, as a decent man would, pull'st the
strap,
But lett'st the carriage fill with smoke
Till all but thou must choke.
Why art thou anti-social thus,
Why dost thou differ so from us?
Thou pig! thou hippopotamus !
I don't pretend to be satisfied with
these lines. They are not strong, not
complete. Mr. JoyNsoN-Hicks would
have done it more fittingly. Still
they might do a little good some-
where, and every little helps.
Overtime.
“The evidence was that defendants em-
ployed six young persons for more than seven
days a week.”—Provincial Paper.
“The organist played as opening volum-
taries the ‘Bridal March' from ‘Lohengrin,”

It was evidently BARNABY's. Still, we
think WAGNER might have been men-
tioned as his collaborator.

wealth Canon Scott Holland in his own

[FEBRUARY 23, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE FRONT.
OF recent days we have almost
stopped pretending to be soldiers and
owned up to being civilian labourers
lodged in the War zone. This is felt
so acutely that several leading privates
have quite discarded that absolute
attribute of the infantryman, the rifle.
They return from working parties
completely unarmed, discover the fact
with a mild and but half-regretful
astonishment and report the circum-
stance to section - commanders as if
they had lost one round of small arms
ammunition or the last cube from an
iron ration.
The hobby of the civilian labourer
is obstacle-racing. To do this you
require a dark night, the assistance of
some Royal Engineers, an appoint-
ment just behind the front line with
some supervisor of labour whom you
don't know and don't specially want
to, and a four-mile stretch across
country to the rendezvous.
You start out at nightfall and do
good time over the first hundred yards.
The field consists of forty to eighty
labourers, and one of the idle rich (for-
merly styled officers). At the hundred
yards' mark the Royal Engineers begin
to come in. Obstacle 1 is a model
trench, built for instructional pur-
poses and now being turned to
obstructional account. There's one
place where you can get on to the
parados without swimming, and if we
started by daylight we might strike
it. We do not start by daylight.
Beyond the trench is a wire entangle-
ment, also a fine specimen of early
1915 R.E. work. We may note in
passing the trip wire eight yards
beyond. We're getting pretty good
with it now, but in our early days the
R.E. used to get a lot of marks for it.
You go on towards a couple of moated
hedges, whimsically barbed in odd
spots, and emerge into a park or open
space leading into an unhealthy-look-
ing road. It seems all plain sailing to
the road—unless you know the R.E.,
in which case you will not be sur-
prised to find your neck nearly bisected
by a horizontal wire designed to en-
courage telephonic communication.
Eventually you all reach an area
known for some obscure reason—if for
any at all —as “The Brigade.” Here
the R.E. have a new game waiting for
you. We call it “Hunt the Shovels.”
You have been instructed to draw
shovels from the Brigade. The term
covers a space of some thousand square
metres intersected with hedges, bridges,
rivers, dugouts, horseponds (natural
and adventitious), any square metre of
which may contain your shovels.
If you are not behind time so far
this is where you drop a quarter of an
hour. Of course you may just get fed
up and go home. But in that case you
aren't allowed to play again, and as a
matter of fact the game is rather de
rigueur out here. So you hide your
party behind a sign-post, which tells
you—if it were not too dark to read—
INFANTRY MUST NoT HALT HERE,
and then a lance-corporal with a good
nose for shovels looks through the more
likely hiding-places. The search is
rendered pleasant as well as inter-
esting by the fact that all the Brigade
has been trodden into a morass by
months of shovel-hunting.
Beyond the Brigade the obstacles
really begin. But if you use a revolver
freely for wire-cutting and rope your
party together—this prevents anyone
sitting down by the wayside to take
his boots off “because they draws that
bad"—you will reach the rendezvous
assigned to you within an hour of the
time assigned to you. At this point you
will learn that no guide has been seen
or heard of there, and, subsequently,
that the guide was warned for another
square that certainly looks very simi-
lar on the map. But again, if you
know guides, you will guess that he
went straight to the spot where the
job was to be done without bothering
about anything so intricate or super-
fluous as a rendezvous. Anyhow you
will probably end by getting some sort
of casual labour somewhere, some time
or other, and no questions asked so
long as you don't inadvertently dig
through from a main drain into a
C.O.'s dugout.
There is a new joke too, a Red Book,
out of which we are gradually becom-
ing millionaires. It is full of comfort-
able claims and allowances for gentle-
men serving the KING overseas. The
only thing is it takes a bit of working
out. There are so many channels of
enrichment. Thus in June–I forget
the exact date—I spent a night in the
train. Although I had a bed and beer
in bottles all the way from England,
not to mention usual meals and part
use of doctor, I became entitled to one
franc ten centimes in lieu of something
which I have now forgotten. (Authority,
W. O. Letter 2719 |x p * 19 v 2:15).
Then a broken revolver is worth no
less than seventy-two shillings, but I
have to collect autographs to get that.
Unclaimed groom's allowance—I don't
think my groom has claimed it—comes
to nearly four-and-sixpence; and I find
I have been quite needlessly getting
my hair cut at my own expense these
many months.
And yet I am afraid that when I
have made it all out and got a char-
=S
tered accountant to account for it-
that ought to mean a few pounds
Chartered Accountant allowance—my
application will be returned to me
because the envelope is not that shade
of mauve officially ordained for the
enclosure of Overseas Officers' Claims.
TO “LIFE” OF NEW YORK.
(In acknowledgment of its “John Bull
Number.”)
IN earlier peaceful days your attitude
Was witty and satirical and shrewd,
But, * you were serious or skit-
tish,
Always a candid critic of things British,
Though, when you were unable to ad-
mlre us,
Life's “little ironies" were free from
Willus.
But since the War began your English
readers
Have welcomed MARTIN's admirable
leaders"—
Which prove that all that's honest,
clean and wise
In the United States is pro-Allies—
And learned to recognise in Life a friend
On whom to reckon to the bitter end.
But these good services you now have
crowned -
By something finer, braver, more pro-
found—
Your “John Bull Number,” where we
gladly trace
Pride in the common glories of our race,
Goodwill, good fellowship, kind words
of cheer,
So frank, so unmistakably sincere,
That we can find (in ARTEMUs's phrase)
No “slopping over" of the pap of praise,
But just the sort of message that one
brother
Would send in time of trial to another.
And thus, whatever comes of WILsoN's
Notes,
Of Neutral claims or of the tug for
votes,
Nothing that happens henceforth can
detract
From your fraternal and endearing act,
Which fills your cup of kindness brim-
ming full,
And signals Sursum corda to John Bull.

appeal to the good sense of the inhabitants

to take action in this matter only by per-

should be distributed by the lamplighters to

MUSICAL JUMBOMANIA.
“The piano with a thirty-foot keyboard,
forty-five octaves, and five hundred and
twenty-two keys, which Mr. Alfred Butt will
“present' in “Follow the Crowd' at the
Empire Theatre, is now in course of con-
struction. Six pianists will play it, and Mr.
Irving Berlin, the composer of “Watch Your
Step,' is composing some special melodies for
them.”—Sunday Paper.
THE new Bombastophone which the
Titanola Company are constructing for
Mr. Boomer, the famous War lecturer,
is approaching completion. This re-
markable instrument, which roughly
resembles a double-bassoon, stands
about 45 feet high, and has a compass
of 500 octaves, from the low B flat in
profundissimo to the high G on the
Doncaster St. Leger line. The use
that Mr. Boomer makes of the Bom-
bastophone is very original and effective.
Whenever he sees that the attention of
his audience is flagging he introduces
an interlude of “bombination,” which
renders lethargy impossible and exer-
cises an indescribably stimulating effect
on the tympanum. The current of air
is supplied by a bellows operated by an
eight-cylinder Brome engine, but Mr.
Boomer works the keys himself, climb-
ing up and down them with a rapidity
which must be seen to be appreciated.
Another instrument which is ex-
pected to work a revolution in the realm
of sonority is the Clumbungo Drum,
on which Mr. Wackford Bumpus
will shortly give a recital at the Albert
Hall. The drum, which is made of
teak and rhinoceros hide, is three
hundred feet in circumference, but only
twenty feet high, and the drumsticks
are of proportionate length. As Dr.
Blamphin, the eminent aurist, remarks,
“The merit of the notes of this momen-
tous instrument is their profound sin-
cerity. They cannot be disregarded even
by the most absent-minded auditor.”
HINTS FOR AIR RAIDS.
THE War Office have issued a notice
reminding the public that they are
greatly inconvenienced by persons who
telephone for information during the
progress of an air raid. To avoid a
repetition of the trouble the attention
of the public is called to the following
information :-
(1) Elderly ladies may deposit their
lap dogs in the bomb-proof shelter
erected for that purpose in the basement
of the War Office buildings at White-
hall, a charge of one penny per ſlog
per raid being made.
(2) Persons removed from the in-
terior of motor omnibuses by the
explosion of bombs dropped by airships
cannot claim from the Government a
refund of the fares paid by them.
(3) Persons having reason to believe
that an air raid is in progress are
requested to put on their hats before
leaving the house, as it has been
ascertained that a hard hat is a sub-
stantial protection against falling Zep-
pelins.
(4) For the benefit of editors and
others who are dissatisfied with the
precautions taken to cope with the
Zeppelin peril, Messrs. Selfgrove & Co.
announce that their new Strafing Room
will shortly be open to the public.
(5) As the force of a bomb explosion
is largely in an upward direction, those
in the immediate vicinity of a dropping
bomb are advised to assume a recum-
bent position, in which they will enjoy
the added advantage of being indisting-
uishable from the pavement.
(6) As theatre audiences are notori-
ously subject to panic, actor-managers
are earnestly requested to prepare
beforehand some suitable jest with
which, in the event of a bomb entering
the theatre, the attention of the audience
may be distracted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 23, 1916.
UNDERGROUND GAME.
It was four o'clock on a wet wintry
morning.
Captain Blank executed an inad-
vertent double - shuffle on a greasy
trench plank and wondered vaguely
why the rain should always come from
the north-east. Presently a figure
squelched up to him and halted.
“'Tis Sergeant O'Hagan, Sorr,” it
whispered hoarsely.
“Well, Sergeant, what is it?”
“'Tis the sintry at Fosse 19, Sorr.
He's reported quare noises in that
inimy sap beyant.”
“Been dreaming, I expect,” muttered
the Captain, and then added briskly,
“I think I'll have a listen myself. Go
ahead, Sergeant.”
They made their way slowly along
the uneven trench, past silent figures
reclining in various attitudes of ease or
discomfort; past emplacements where
machine - guns and trench - mortars
were innocently sleeping (with one eye
always open) or being overhauled by
an expert night-nurse. Eventually,
by that instinct common to trench-
dwellers and professional poachers,
they found themselves at Fosse 19,
and with superlative caution crept up
to the sentry.
“What's wrong?” whispered the
Captain tersely.
“Well, Sir,” replied Private Blobbs,
“I was standin' 'ere on listenin' duty,
when I 'ears somethink movin' very
contagious, so I pops up me 'ead to
'ave a peep. Didn't see nothink, but I
'ears a pecooliar noise like There
y'are, Sir.”
He broke off abruptly, and, borne
upon the wind, came a series of guttural
ld lull" in ur's.
“Now wouldn't ut give one a quare
shtart, that 2" remarked Sergeant
O'Hagan, sot to roce.
“ Um-m,” said the Captain thought-
fully. “I think Mr. Hamilton had
better have a look round.”
A few minutes later, having invaded
the privacy of “Whortleberry Villa,”
he was relentlessly prodding a bundle
of waterproofs.
“Come on, young fella!” he ex-
claimed when the bundle showed signs
of life; “bombin' party forward.
Brother Bosch is playin' the piccolo
just outside Fosse 19.”
The Subaltern scrambled out of his
wraps and, with incredible dispatch,
gathered together the Davids of his
section. “All guaranteed,” so he
boasted, “to hit the cocoanut every
time.”
Accoutred with their infernal
machines, the little band of hope
passed along the trench as silently as
a party of FENIMORE Cooper's North-
American Indians.
:: :: ::: :: ::
“Yes, they're at home right
enough,” muttered the Subaltern, after
a cramped interval of breathless atten-
tion, “and fairly asking for it.”
He proceeded to make his disposi-
tions with the skill and assurance of
an old hand. He was nearly nineteen.
“We’re going to stalk 'em this
time,” he whispered to the men; “you
keep on crawling till I say “Go ?"
Then drop it on them quick."
He slid over the parapet like an eel
and disappeared into the night. In a
few moments the sentry was alone in
the trench. His state of mind was,
from sheer excitement, almost insup-
portable.
After what seemed interminable
hours, at last he heard the clear word
of command, the clatter of things
falling and the immediate roar of the
explosions. In reply, rifle fire began
to break out along the German first
trenches, whilst, overhead, a star-shell
burst into blossom ; then the stutter of
machine-guns joined in the chorus.
The sentry flattened himself like a
poultice against the side of the trench.
Fosse 19 had, among other disadvan-
tages, the reputation of being open to
enfilading by machine-gun fire.
The disturbance died away as quickly
as it had arisen, but there were no
indications that the bombing party
was returning. Private Blobbs danced
with futile impatience and bent his
head to the approved angle of the
expert listener. Suddenly a heavy
body took him in the nape of the
neck.
“Ow!” he exclaimed, floundering in
mud and water with an unseen and
inconceivable presence. He clutched
the nightmare of an ear and kicked
violently.
“Look aht, Percy,”
hollow but reassuring
comes another l’’
Private Blobbs removed himself with
remarkable agility. . . . .
“Good ' ' exclaimed the Subaltern
when he finally slid into the trench.
“This expedition hasn't quite come up
to expectations, but it's the nicest
family of pigs I've seen for some
time.”
He flashed an electric torch on to
the disordered carcasses.
“Corporal Leary,” he added in-
cisively, “will you kindly see that the
officers' mess is served with fresh
pork 2"
He snapped out the torch and, com-
plete master of the situation, started
on the return journey to “Whortleberry
Villa.”

In the absence of HIS MAJESTY, the
LoRD CHANCELLOR delivered the brief
Speech from the Throne, expressing
the unalterable determination of the
British people and their Allies to defeat
the Power (name not given but possibly
conjecturable) “which mistakes force
for right and expediency for honour.”
To emphasise the unity of the nation
the Address was moved by the Unionist
Earl of CLARENDON and seconded by
the Liberal Lord MUIR-MACKENZIE. It
was agreed to in good time for dinner.
The Commons are not so economical
of time. Mr. IAN MACPHERSoN, who
moved the Address, made quite a long
speech. Like Hamlet, it was chiefly
composed of quotations, but they were
all quite apt, and as they ranged from
THUCYDIDEs to BURRE, with BoI.ING-
BROKE's Patriot King thrown in, they
pleased the House, which likes these
tributes to its erudition. The seconder,
in khaki, was Col. F. S. JACKSON, a new
Member, who, like the still-lamented

wicket not quite to his liking at first,
but afterwards scored freely. In con-
gratulating the outgoing batsman the
PRIME MINISTER discovered unexpected
knowledge of cricket. “The Hon. Mem-
ber,” he said, “was making his maiden
speech; but I doubt if he has ever
encountered a maiden over—except,
perhaps, when he was bowling.”
In the regretted absence of the Leader
of the Opposition, Mr. STUART-WoRTLEY
as Acting-CHAPLIN referred to the dis-
integration of parties under the stress
of war. Now they had only groups,
some designed to help the Government,
some to “ginger” them. Mr. Asquith
dwelt upon the growing unity of con-
trol among the Allies, which would
counteract the advantage in this re-
spect hitherto enjoyed by our foes; and
noted the amazing growth of the once
“contemptible little” British Army.
He further reminded us that we had
already incurred liabilities which it
would take us a generation to wipe out;
and it was the first duty of every pat-
riotic citizen to practise rigid economy.
All very well, said, in effect, Mr.
WARDLE, the new leader of the

well, said Sir MARK Sykes, but if we
are going to win the war we must co-
ordinate at home as well as abroad, and
abandon the idea of “muddling through.”
With experience of G. H. Q. and four
public departments, he asserted that
the men were all right, but the system
all wrong; and that the proper thing
was to adopt SULTAN OMAR's plan, and
give the supreme control of the War to
a Cabinet of not more than four mem-
bers, who with no administrative details
to distract them might be able to “teach
the doubtful battle where to rage.”
The PRIME MINISTER listened with
interest but without enthusiasm to this
suggestion. Probably he remembered
that an essential part of OMAR's scheme
was that if the Four failed to agree
they were to be promptly hanged, and
had himself no ambition to take part
in a String Quartett.

Mr. LULU HARcourt, himself a mem-
ber of the Government which is closing
their galleries, to present it.
Sir HENRY DALzie L is the leader of
one of the “ginger groups” above
referred to. His first exploit in this
capacity was to resist the proposal of
the Government to take all the time of
the House. In his demand that private
Members should still be allowed the
privilege of introducing Bills and hav-
ing them printed at the public expense,
he had the support of Mr. Hogg|E,
Mr. KING, Mr. PRINGLE, Mr. Booth,
Sir WILLIAM BYLEs, and other states-
men of similar eminence; but the PRIME
MINISTER was obdurate. He accused
the malcontents of lacking a sense of
perspective—and expressed the poorest
opinion of their efforts at legislation.
Some of the private Members got
their own back when the first amend-
ment to the Address was moved by
Mr. JoyNSoN-HICRs. The Member for
Brentford, who knows the alphabet of
aviation from Aeroplane to Zeppelin,
complained that the air-service, like his
own constituency in legendary times,
was under Dual Control, and urged
that it should be placed under a single
competent chief.
Neither the UNDER-SECRETARY FoR
WAR nor the FIRST Lord of the ADMIR-
resembled a couple of flying pilots who,
having gone up to attack a hostile air-
ship in the dark, search in vain for an
adequate landing-place. Heckled as to
the exact status of Sir PERCY Scott,
for example, Mr. TENNANT could only
say that he “is still in the position he
was in.” When Mr. ELLIS GRIFFITH
ventured the remark that a personal
knowledge of flying would be a useful
qualification for officers advising the
Government on this subject, Mr. BAL-
Four was as painfully surprised as if
he himself had been called upon to
navigate a t. b. d. in heavy weather.
In the absence of any definite sign of
repentance the critics of the Govern-
ment threatened a division, which
would have been awkward and might
have been disastrous. In similar cir-
cumstances Mr. GLADSTONE used to
“send for the sledge-hammer"—mean-
ing Mr. Asquith. The present PRIME
MINISTER, when hard pressed, sends
for BoxAR. Thus summoned to ride
the whirlwind the Colon IAL SECRETARY
executed a graceful volplane. In a few
frank sentences he admitted that the
Government were very far from being
satisfied with the Air Service, though it
had achieved great things. Further, they
were willing to give another day for its
discussion when they had got through

The pleasantest feature of Question
time was the tribute paid (with hint of
more substantial rewards to come after
the War) to the gallantry and self-
sacrifice of the officers and men of our
mercantile marine. This furnished an
appropriate prelude to the subject of
the ensuing debate. Mr. PETo and
others sought to press upon the
Government the more economical use
of our merchant shipping. Here they
were forcing an open door. Steps have
already been taken to restrict the im-
ports of luxuries. Ministers are unani-
mous, I believe, in regarding “ginger,”
for instance, as an article whose im-
portation might profitably be curtailed.

THE LONDON CHLA RIVAR;.
PUNCH, OR
HIGH LAND HOSPITALITY.
It happened in Scotland—it couldn't
have happened anywhere else.
I had been visiting the MacNeils.
They sympathised over my wound; they
rallied round with tea and toast; they
provided Scotch whisky. My one ob-
jection to the family was their supreme
confidence in these new-fledged lads
of the Home Defence, whom I–as a
Subaltern of the old school who had
done my time at Sandhurst before the
War—scorned with a dogged contempt
which no degree of argument could kill.
It was when I reached the street
that I realised that fervid fire in the
soul of Scotch hospitality—a fire which
brands it as unique in our island story.
In my coat pocket reposed a bottle of
Heather Dew.
The convalescent home where I was
being wooed back to brisk health was
situated along the sea-front. Chuckling
at the MacNeils' efforts to modify my
views of our Home Defenders and their
inefficiency, and brooding on the folks'
kind hearts, I paused to light a
cigarette. The wind blew out the
fluttering flame. It also set me sneez-
ing, for I had a bad cold in the head.
I struck another match.
“Hey!” said a voice suddenly behind
me. I swerved, choking back a sneeze.
| “Hey, hey, hey!” some broad Doric
tongue continued.
A heavy hand came plump on my
shoulder; a large Highland face was
pushed into mine ; a kilt flapped round
long bare shanks. I sneezed again.
“Got ye this time, lad!” announced
the son of the North, who now appeared
to be a brawny lance-corporal. “Sig-
nallin' ye are. Oot to sea. Ah saw ye

I sneezed again. “I was’d ' " I
declared as well as the cold in my
head would allow. “It was a batch.

conclusive tones. “Ah ken better
Ye're the second spy Ah 've cotched.
Come along, ma freend Fritz! Ye'll
hae the job o' explainin’ to the Colonel

Hunching his rifle over his shoulder,
he marched me back the way I had
Coline.
“Where are you takig be to ?” I
enquired thickly. “Take be to your

I was bundled into a draughty cattle-

sneezed. It was a bright prospect. I
changed my views on the inefficiency
of our Home Defenders. They now
appealed to me as violently efficient.
A night in a tumble-down cow-house!
Desolation Then I brightened up:
the MacNeils' whisky. The cork
popped in the silence of the night.
The door opened. A sentry's head
was poked round. Disregarding him,
I raised the bottle to my chattering
teeth. Then the lance - corporal
appeared. With a sudden thought I
offered him the bottle. A strange look
crept across his face. Gingerly he took
the bottle. Then there was a comfort-
able sound. He drew a hand across
his mouth.
“That's grrand,” he said. “Beg
pardon, Sir. It's been ma mistake.
Jock, the prisoner is a Scottish officer.
Let him gang. . Thank ye, Sir;

This indication that the normal strength
of a German company is now only 79
is welcome news.
“The air defence of London is now practic-

which Lord French is Commander-in-Chief,
and Admiral Lord French is Commander-in

So now we're all right.
“The spectacle of the snow-clad trees on the
London Road, and in other suburban districts,
was pleasant to the eye, although it made

ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE MIRACLE.
ONCE upon a time there was one
Herbert. The doctor being unwilling to
pass him so that there was no chance
that he, in the words of the great joke,
would “march too,” he had taken a
situation as a waiter.
Englishmen (it is an axiom) do not
make good waiters; nor was he an
exception. But he was conscientious
and painstaking, although clumsy and
minded of the error (little as such
reminding is to the taste of regular
customers); on the contrary, he had
never been known to visit the restaur-
ant before. You see, then, how un-
happily Herbert viewed life as he
lay awake in his attic that night,
and very heavy were his feet on his
way to work the next day, with an
overcoat buttoned up to his neck to
hide his evening dress. .
It was a cold rainy morning; the

To his followers' deep despair,

And MARKHAM is out of the hunt,
And eloquent BERNARD WAUGHAN

of short memory. Still, this
was war-time, and Hans had
gone to Germany and might
now be dead, and Fritz very
properly was interned, and Josef
had sought Vienna once more,
and Pasquale and Giuseppe had
rejoined the Italian flag, and the
only foreigners left were a few
nondescripts, very volubly, in-
deed almost passionately, of
Swiss nationality. In fact, if
this War has done nothing else
it has at least established the
fact that the male population of
Switzerland is far greater than
any one had supposed. Gallant

So you see this was Herbert's
chance, and the manager was
glad to get him; and Herbert, |
who, owing to the slump in || ||
games, had lost his job at an
athletic sports factory and had
certain financial liabilities which
he had long since abandoned |
any hope of meeting, was glad
to come. Only by infinite self-
denial and sacrifice did he get
together the necessary capital
for his clothes and the deposit
demanded from waiters against A
breakages, theft and so forth. %2
On his first day as one in º

Herbert made some very serious

Incidentally the unkindest thing
that has yet been said of the
Unionists who joined the late
Ministry. -
“There were further indications at
the meeting of the Salop County
Council on Saturday of the Council's
desire to economise where possible.
Dr. McCarthy drew attention to
figures given in the report of the
County Medical Officer of Health
showing a diminution in the birth-
rate of the county for the quarter to
a sauce-boat, he broke a glass, and
he forgot to charge for the cigar which
the portly gentleman in the corner had
taken after his lunch. And this cigar
was a half-crown Corona, for the portly
gentleman either had not yet grasped
the full meaning of War economy or
was enjoying one of those periodical
orgies to which even rigid economists
think themselves to be entitled.
Already Herbert had, like Alnaschar
in the Eastern tale, spent in imagination
far more than he could make all the
week, and this blow, with the manager's
abuse to serve as salt in the wound,
sent him home in misery. Nor was
it as if the portly gentleman was a
regular customer who could be re-

was against him. There was not a
gleam of hope in the future, not a ray
of light. His companions were surly,
the manager was venomous, the bitter
rain fell on. He was in debt and would
get the sack.
It was then that the miracle hap-
pened. Suddenly Herbert, who was
gazing forlornly through the window
at this disconsolate world, waiting,
napkin on his arm, to begin to wait,
heard a voice saying, “I’m afraid you
forgot to charge me for my cigar yester-
day.” It was the portly gentleman.

Economy of any kind is praiseworthy,
but we think they might have begun

typical three-roomed cottage near the docks
is at present £17 per week. Among the
recent purchases of the family, a pianoforte,
costing £50, may be enumerated, although
no one in the house can play a note. This
looks more wasteful than the common outlay
on gramophones, which at least give pleasure.

esting by reason of a wound; and, when this brought him
back to England, the passion also returned, stronger than
ever. This, of course, is why their story is called Love at
Second Sight (GRANT RICHARDs). I have now a small
surprise for you, namely that Edith was already married,
and owned a charming house, a valetudinarian husband
and two pleasant children. So I quite expected that
Aylmer, in the fulness of time, would either (1) be removed
by the enemy, or (2) marry a delightful little Red-Cross
nurse who adored him. But the author, Mrs. LEveRson,
had other views. Instead therefore of ending her heroine
in the expected mood of conventional reconciliation she
sends the objectionable husband off with somebody else,
and leaves us to a prospect of wedding-bells with the
divorce court as a preliminary. - - -
Which is at least original.
But throughout I had the feel-
ing that a great deal of bright
and clever writing was being
wasted on a poor theme. The
characters are brilliantly sug-
gested, but — with perhaps
one exception, forgetful Lady
Comroy, who is an entire de-
light — they seem altogether
unworthy of it. In fact I
came away from the book
with the impression of having
attended a gathering of some-
what shoddily smart people,
and sat next to a clever woman
who had been witty about
them. The worst of the
matter is that they are all so
real. This is a tribute to the
author, but a most unpleasant
reflection for everyone else.
AND HAPPY TO KNOW YOU
My attention was first
attracted to The New Dawn --
(LONG) by the fact that the plot starts at Euston Station.
That interesting, not to say romantic, line, the L. & N. W. R.,
is usually shunned by our novelists. But although
“GEORGE Wovil,” takes his characters to the furthest North,
even beyond Glasgow, their sympathies, like, I think, those
of their creator, remain behind in fair and false and fickle
Wimbledon. This at least was where Halvey Brown
wished himself as the train glided over the best laid track
in Europe towards dour Bartocher. And Brown, though
he knew the natural drabness of his destination already,
had at that time no information as to all the unpleasing
events that were to happen there; that, for example, the
minister's new wife would turn out to be a lady with a past
that he himself had shared, or that the fair-haired young
man in the same compartment was the assistant minister,
who would fall in love with the said wife and eventually
slay her, the minister, and himself. I find I have been led
into betraying for you the outline of the story. Perhaps, how-
ever, this does not greatly matter. The value of the book
lies in its very natural and human characters. All four
of them—there are only four who really matter—are admir-
ably drawn, so that the tragedy of their lives holds and
convinces you. My complaints against the author are, first,
the excess of emphasis that he gives to the physical unpleas-
each died of, and all that has happened since.

William. “I Air PRoud AND HAPPY, SIR, BUT THE old i
WOMAN SHE DO FRET somethIN' TERRIBLE BECAUSE NONE OF

Still, The
New Dawn remains an unconventional and strongly written
story, which will certainly interest though perhaps hardly
enliven you.
There is something very soothing in the peeps into dusty
family papers and the faint echoes of departed gossip which
Mrs. STIRLING provides in A Painter of Dreams (LANE).
These pleasantly amateurish historical studies go back a
century and a half. A commonplace book from which are
quoted many diverting and incredible things; a chapter in
which those queer Radicals, HoRNE TookE, CoBBETT, Sir
FRANCIs BURDETT and bluff Squire Bosville, are chiefly
concerned; a sketch of the fourth Earl of ALBEMARLE,
keen farmer and friend of CoRE of Norfolk, Master of the

of two artists, John HERRING,

an agreeable pot-pourri with

ought to be able to charm you out of the preposterous

see that the conscientious author thinks that DICKY Doyle,

who he was.

A CURE FOR DEPRESSION.
MoMENTs there are of transient gloom
When life for me appears to lose
Its rosy aspect and assume
The turnip's pessimistic hues;
As when o' mornings, gazing out
Across my patch of fog-grey river,
I feel a twinge of poor man's gout
Or else a touch of liver;
Or when, forgetting WATTs's rhymes
On puppy-dogs that bark and bite,
The Westminster attacks The Times,
Starting a most unseemly fight;
Or when I find some Labour sheet
Still left at large to boom rebellion,
Or hear the thin pacific bleat
Of “my hon. friend" TREvely.AN ;
When enemy craft career above,
Unchallenged (till they've had their fling);
Or LITTLE WILLIE's vernal shove
Anticipates the dawn of Spring;
When Neutrals want an open door
Kept wide for their commercial dealings,
And we must risk to lose the War
Rather than hurt their feelings.
Such moments, making Hope look bleak,
And Courage turn a little blue,
Even with hearts as tough as teak

No. XXXV.
(From ENFER PASH.A.)
SIRE,--Surely the course of human affairs is often
strange and perplexing. When we formed the Committee
of Union and Progress and deposed the wretched ABDUL
from the Sultanate no sane man can have thought that
you and I should ever be friends. ABDUL was your friend;
you and yours had lavished upon him and his creatures all
your arts for the purpose of obtaining influence and pro-
moting the interest—forgive me for saying it—not so much
of Turkey as of the German Empire. When therefore we
emerged, and ABDUL with his system retired, all your
beautiful schemes seemed to be shattered into pieces so
small that no human ingenuity could avail to pick them up
and fit them together again. . Yet lo and behold, the
impossible has happened. ABDUL remains in darkness, I
and my colleagues are in power, and you and I are even
more closely knit together than is altogether desirable for
me and those whom (indirectly, perhaps, but not the less
effectively) I help to govern. I am entitled therefore to
have a heart-to-heart talk with my bosom-friend, and, any-
how, whether I am entitled or not, that is what I propose
to have. You may tell me in your genial way that I am
only an upstart, but I answer that I occupy my position
not because my father and my grandfather were big men,
but because I myself, through my own plans and by my
own strength, did certain things which in my judgment
had to be done.
What I now feel, O my friend, is this: I am beginning
to doubt whether in all this tremendous confusion of fight-
ing I have made the right choice. It wasn't necessary for
us Turks to fight at all; it wasn't even desirable. We had
suffered a severe set-back in the first Balkan War, and in
the second we were only just able, owing to the consum-
mate folly of that silly knave, your friend, TsAR FERDINAND,
to snatch a brand or two from the burning. What we
wanted was rest, and had it not been for you we might
have had it—yes, and our wounds might have been healed
and our finances restored, while others endured privation
and loss.
All that, as I say, we might have had ; but from the
day when the Goeben arrived off Constantinople we were
doomed. That, indeed, was a master-stroke on your part,
but for us it has meant misery on an ever-increasing scale.
What were your promises? We were to have Egypt, but
you were to be there too, and you were to hold the Bagdad
railway and the regions through which it ran. We were to
help you in conquering India, but you were to keep it for
yourself when once it was conquered. We were to have a
free hand with the Armenians. Well, we have had it, and
the Armenians are fewer by half-a-million than they were.
Pleasant as it is to contemplate the destruction of those
restless and disloyal infidels, it cannot be said that we have
gained any advantage from it, for the Russians have taken
Erzerum and are sweeping through Armenia in a mighty
and irresistible torrent, while our Turkish armies are
scattered to the winds of heaven. Strong as you are and
prodigal of promises, here you have failed to make good
your pledges of help, and nowhere else do you seem able
to achieve anything, except the crushing of little nations.
I look back with loathing upon the day when I was
mad enough to listen to you and to become a partner in
your schemes. You flattered us, nay, you even fawned
upon us in order to secure your ends, and, now that our
forces have been joined with yours, ruin menaces my
country and my race. You, forsooth, allow yourself to
be held up as a great prophet of Islam and a Heaven-
sent protector of its faith; but we who see our nation
crumbling into dust owing to your selfish ambition may
be pardoned if at last we look to ourselves and attempt
to save what still remains to us. To work, as they say, for
the King of PRUssia has never been a profitable undertaking.
Yours, ICN VER.

active share in the game.
Howbeit he took over B116 and was
told by the Next Man Up to wire to his
heart's content. He asked the Next
Man Up just where he wanted the
wiring to be performed. The Next Man

of the Hun, and observed, “Out there,

The lace appeared to put quite a new
idea into their heads. The advance

that if I had some boots already I
might get the new pair by a process
known as exchange, which takes less
time and has the additional advantage
of not costing anything. This struck
them as an excellent new game for
several days while they were deciding
which was the right army form for an
officer desirous of exchanging boots.
At last all appeared fixed up. I came
back into billets with every confidence
of finding a couple of boots waiting for
me on the mat. Of course I didn't
really believe they would be there; I
only had every confidence. Anyhow
they were not.

HARD CASES.
AMoNG other applications which were
recently heard for exemption from the
new Compulsory Service Act for un-
married men we extract the following:—
Mr. Isaac Goldstein claimed exemp-
tion for his clerk, a stalwart youth of
twenty-two, on the ground that he was
indispensable to him in his business.
Asked what his business was the
applicant said he was a bookmaker.
The Chairman. I thought there was
no racing now.

chasing every week.
The Chairman. Do people still go to
races and bet 2
Mr. Goldstein. Of course they do.
Why not ?
The Chairman. I fancied they might
have found other things to do. Also I
fancied that money might be short.
The applicant said that there was
plenty of money about if you knew
where to look for it.
The Chairman. And who ride the
horses?
Mr. Goldstein. The jockeys, of course.
The Chairman. They prefer that to
doing anything more serious for their
country?
Mr. Goldstein. They are doing some-
thing very serious for their country.
They're preserving the breed of horses.
Where would old England's horseflesh
be without races and steeplechases?
The Chairman. You say this young
man is indispensable to you. How?
Mr. Goldstein. He is my clerk. He
writes down the bets. I haven't got
time to write down bets myself; I'm
too busy taking them. He's one of the
quickest clerks in England. I should
go broke if I hadn't got him.
Application refused.
Mr. Joe Tummilee applied for the
exemption of a comedian playing in his
revue, “Never mind the War.” This
young man, he said, who was twenty-
nine, was the life and soul of the piece,
and if he joined the Army the applicant
would be put both to inconvenience
and loss. -
The Chairman. Are there not older
or married actors that you could employ
for this great work? -
Mr. Tummilee. They're not so good.
The comedian in questicn was a very
agile dancer and was also good-looking.
Other men might not attract the
public.
The Chairman. Is the attraction of
the public essential?
Mr. Tummilee (surprised). Naturally.
How should we managers live other-
wise? Besides, when a great war is
going on it's a national duty to try
and make people forget. My theatre,
Steeple-
you perhaps are not aware, is a favourite
resort for wounded soldiers, who are
never so happy as when they are there.
The Chairman. Surely all that
happiness will not disappear because
this one performer is missing 2
Mr. Tummilee. Most of it. He's the
great draw. -
The Chairman. Has it not occurred
to you that the country ought to come
first 2
Mr. Tummilee. I consider I'm doing
a great deal for the country, and he too,
by making it laugh.
The Chairman. You must find an
older funny man or scon we may all
be weeping. -
Application refused.
TMr. Samuel Bland claimed exemption
on the ground that he disapproved of
war and physical force.
The Chairman. What would you do
if you caught a burglar in your house?
Applicant. I should lock him in and
call for the police,
The Chairman. Then you don't mind
relying on the physical force of others
for your own protection ?
Applicant. That is part of the ma-
chinery of civilisation.
The Chairman. So, I fear, is an army.
Do you pay your taxes?
Applicant. Yes. -
The Chairman. Why? .
The Applicant. Because there is
Scriptural warrant for it.
The Chairman. But you know that
a large part of them goes to maintain
our fighting men. Without money we
should have to give in. -
Applicant. I obey the law. I don't
necessarily know where the money is
going. -
The Chairman. Your position is very
illogical. Either you should take your
part in defending your country or obey
your conscience and either go to prison
for refusing to pay taxes for the carry-
ing-on of the War, or emigrate to some
place more like Utopia than this is. As
it is you take advantage of other men's
readiness to fight and even to die for
you, and actually pay them to do so, but
raise conscientious objections to doing
either for yourself. A conscience that is
so adaptable is not worth considering.
Application refused. -
Harry Cadgsmith, who said he was
a picture-palace proprietor, applied for
exemption for the commissionaire who
stood outside the building and invited
people in.
The Chairman. How old is he 2
Mr. Cadqsmith. Thirty-four.
The Chairman. Is he strong?
Mr. Cadysmith. Very. He is also
highly trained; he wears uniform and
calls out the attractions. The cinema
is one of the principal alleviations of
modern life and but for this man's
powerful voice many people might pass
by and never enter.
The Chairman. What kind of pictures
do you show 2
Mr. Cadgsmith. The best.
The Chairman. Are they English 2
Mr. Cadgsmith. Some are. But the
public prefer American ones. I always
pride myself on giving the public what
it has the sense to want.
The Chairman. Might it not be
better employed elsewhere 2 Making
munitions, for example 2
Mr. Cadgsmith. That is nothing to
do with me. My business is to supply
a demand.
The Chairman. What is your chief
film this week 2
Mr. Cadgsmith. It is a very fine
story entitled “The Prince of Crooks.”
The Chairman. Could not a woman
take this man's place?
Mr. Cadgsmith. Not to do it justice.

R.N. Cadet (during his first term at Osborne—where he has been told always to salute his superior officers of both services—meeting some
“temporary” subalterns who disregard his salute). “REALLY, MoTHER, IF THESE TEMPORARY subs of THE JUNIoR service cANNor
BEHAVE As GENTLEMEN AND RETURN MY SALUTE, I SHALL CERTAINLY GIVE UP TAKING ANY NOTICE of THEMI.”
GOOD OPENINGS FOR M.P.'s.
The Manchester Guardian complains
that there is a remarkable monotony
about the opening of speeches in the
House of Commons.
“On Wednesday forty-five speeches
(not counting brief efforts in the way
of interjections) were delivered, and in
thirty cases the speeches began with
the first person singular. Only fifteen
members could think of anything more
original.” It appears that four speeches
began with “I beg,” four with “I
should like,” three with “I wish,” and
three with “I am sure.”
It may be a little daring, perhaps, to
suggest that some originality should
be introduced into the methods of Par-
liamentary orators (writes a corre-
spondent); but as one whose courage
has never failed him in telling other
people how to go about their business
I venture to suggest a few openings
which possibly have never yet been
utilised.
As it is half the battle, to the speaker,
to grip interest at the very outset, the
following might be tried: “Drip, drip
drip—the blood fell from the ceiling."
This would cause departing Members
to drop sharply back into their seats.
Only a little ingenuity would be re-
quired to make these words the opening
of a speech on any timely topic.
Our aristocratic legislators could make
certain of arresting attention by begin-
ning, “In the words of a friend of mine,
a well-known Peckham butcher * >
another gambit that could be made to
suit any subject, from the shipping
problem to the Zeppelin nuisance.
Or again, “The missis woke me up
in the middle of last Tuesday night,
and said This is the kind of
homely touch that would ensure a
sympathetic hearing.
Members might also make a good
start with “'Twas '' and “Methinks,”
even at the risk of being accused of the
use of unparliamentary expressions.
If they would only study the poets
they would find plenty of bright and
original openings. What better could
be desired than BRowNING's
“So, at home, the sick tall yellow Duchess
Was left with the infant in her clutches,”
if occasion should arise in the House
for criticism of the heartless action of a
Local Tribunal in disallowing a Duke's
claim for exemption ?
Many a man possesses an undis-
covered knack of extempore rhyming,
a gift which has seldom or never been
exercised in the House of Commons.
That will be a bright day for legislators
when a Member rises in his place and
begins something like this: “Sir, if
the House wiii"bear with me"one
moment, I should like to say that I,
for one, cannot agree that we have
found the perfect way of dealing with
a gross neglect to which all honest
men object.” Any Member who could
keep up that sort of thing for half-an-
hour (and some, no doubt, could, if they
would only practise) would achieve
lasting fame, not only for his originality,
but because of the remarkable scenes
amid which his concluding lines would
almost certainly be uttered.

MY DuG-ouT.
(A Memory of Gallipoli.)
IT was my home, not ringed with roses blowing,
Nor set in meadows where cool waters croon;
Parched wastes were round it, and no shade was going,
Nor breath of violets nor song-birds' tune;
Only at times from the adjacent dwelling
Came down with Boreas the quaint, compelling
Scent of the Tenth Platoon.
And there not hermit-like alone I brooded,
But ant and lizard and all things that crawl
With great grasshoppers by brigades intruded;
Therein the tortoise had his homely stall;
Green flies and blue slept nightly in their notches,
Save when a serpent, in the middle watches,
Came and disturbed us all.
There, where the sun, the senseless sun, kept pouring,
And dust-clouds smothered one about the chest,
While secret waters filtered through the flooring
(In case the heat should leave one too oppressed),
Always I lay in those sad fevered seasons -
Which Red-Hat humourists, for mystic reasons,
Regarded as our “rest.”
For it was home; and when I was not in it,
But in the trenches, it was home indeed;
When mad foes fired at twenty rounds a minute
(Not, I may say, the regulation speed),
For me far more it harboured my Penates;
I missed my animals; I missed my gay teas
With Alf, the centipede.
And I am shocked to think that that same ceiling
Shields now some Mussulman of lowly strain;
Yet, though he knows me not, I can't help feeling
That something of my spirit must remain,
And if, in that rich air the man should mellow
In mind, in soul, and be a better fellow,
I have not lived in vain.
And it may be, when worlds have ceased to wrestle,
I shall go back across the Midland foam
At special rates in some large tourist vessel
To my late hollow in the SULTAN's loam,
And there clasp hands with that uplifted warrior,
Compare brief notes and wonder which was sorrier
To have to call it home.

154 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARCH 1, 1916.
A STRONG SOUTH-EASTER.
I HAVE been having further trouble
with my neighbour, Petherton, whose
place adjoins mine, being divided from
it by a hedge. Beyond the hedge lies
Petherton's small paddock, where his
poultry amuse themselves, and, beyond
that, Petherton's house and garden.
But, however good a fence may be, it
will not keep out, or keep in, smells.
Therefore when Petherton engaged in
apparently chemical operations giving
off the most noxious gases I was
rapidly forced to the conclusion that
he ought to have a different kind of
boundary between his property and
mine, and also that the air of our
neighbourhood no longer rivalled that
of Bexhill, especially when the wind
blew from the south-east.
Wishing to remedy this state of
affairs without recourse to unpleasant
measures, I sat down to write to
Petherton.
DEAR PETHERTON, These continual
south-easterly winds portend rain, I
fear, and so I hope you have wrapped
your parsnips up to protect them from
the probable excess of moisture which
is so injurious to all such plants.
My primary object in writing is not
so much anxiety about the health of
your vegetables, but to ask whether
you have noticed a most unpleasant
odour which seems to be heading north-
west; at any rate it is more unpleasant
if possible when the wind is from the
south-east than at any other time.
It does not appear likely that the
smell should have come from the
German lines, so we must look nearer
home for the cause of the trouble.
Don't you think we ought to take joint
action to get the nuisance ended ?
Yours, H. J. Fordyce.
Petherton's reply was a bulky packet
which, being opened, revealed a tin of
dog soap. I could only infer that he
wished to saddle Togo, our prize-bred
Airedale, with the blame. Coward
However, true to my determination
to be friendly if possible, I wrote:–
DEAR FRED,--Thanks for the Camem-
bert. Thomas our cat has not quite
completed the Moonlight Sonata which
he has spent several nights in com-
posing, but as soon as it is published I
will send you a copy of it in return.
My nephew, over from France on
short leave, came to see us yesterday
but left hurriedly. He said that the
air was too reminiscent of a place
where he was severely gassed. Don't
you notice anything 3
Yours as ever, H. J. Fordyce.
Within an hour of the delivery of
this letter another parcel arrived from
Petherton. It contained three ordinary
clothes-pegs and a brief note, which
ran –
SIR,--I thought even you would be
able to take the hint contained in my
previous parcel. As however it was
evidently lost on you, I am writing to
suggest to you more plainly that you
should wash your dog. I noticed its
deplorable condition when I passed it
in the road the other morning, and am
surprised that the simple explanation
of the trouble has not occurred to you
before. -
Should the course I recommend have
no good effect, I can only suggest your
| shooting, selling or otherwise disposing
of the malodorous pest, or else wearing
one of the protectors of which I enclose
three. They are somewhat archaic in
design, but should just suit you and
your household.
Yours faithfully,
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
I replied:—
Good old FREDDIE,-What a genius
you are! Of course the dog is the
culprit. I was offered fifteen pounds
for him the other day and refused it.
No doubt I should have received a
better offer but for the defect, which
you so readily noticed, in the animal's
condition. I have just had him sham-
pooed and when he is dry I will examine
him and report to you at once.
Many thanks for the charming nose-
protectors, which however I return, as
they are all too large. I wonder if you
would mind changing them for sevens;
these appear to be eight-and-a-halfs.
I am glad the wind has veered to
the north-east. Your parsnips will no
doubt share my joy. By the way was
it you I saw yesterday in your paddock
holding your nose just before the wind
shifted round 2 The man, whoever it
was, was looking at your poultry,
which appear to be drooping.
Yours till the wind changes,
H. J. Ford YCE.
P.S.–If I can get a good stamp-
album in town to-day I will send it to
you. A change of hobby is often very
beneficial. -
I followed this up with another
letter in the afternoon, couched in
more formal terms:—
SIR,-In fulfilment of the promise
contained in my previous letter of to-
day's date I have the honour to inform
you that my dog Togo is not the cause
of the trouble. As soon as he was dry
I fastened him up in the middle of my
drawing-room, and my household, my-
self included, sniffed at him from all
points of the compass. Then, leaving
him still chained up, we went into the
garden and nearly fainted from the
pestilential odours borne on the breeze,
which was again south-east.
If you have not suffered it seems
clear to me that either (a) you have a
curious taste in scents, or (b) you have
no sense of smell. I think you should
call in an expert, in the case of (a) a
brain specialist, or in the case of (b) a
nose - plumber. In the meantime I
intend to consult another sort of expert,
the Sanitary Inspector.
Yours obediently, except in such a
matter as this, H. J. For DYCE.
I wrote to the Inspector that night
and received the following within
twenty-four hours:—
DEAR SIR,-Yours of yesterday's date
to hand, and in reply I regret that I am
unable to assist you in the matter as
your neighbour, Mr. Petherton, is en-
gaged on important experimental work
for the Government in connection with
the manufacture of asphyxiating gases,
thus causing the unpleasant odours
about which I have received several
complaints recently. I have been in
communication with Mr. Petherton on
the matter, but he seems unable to
abate the nuisance. I am surprised
that he has not explained the position
to you himself.
I remain, Yours obediently,
M. TARBUTT.
pp. A. C.
On receiving the above I wrote to
Petherton —
DEAR FRED,--Only a few words to
say that I have just heard the great
news. Heartiest congratters. As a
strafe-scent-manufacturer you are IT.
A bas les Boches t
But why so close about it all this
time? If you had only let me know
about it sooner I would have dug a
trench in my garden and slept in it, in-
stead of complaining. Henceforth I
shall turn my nose (well respirated) to
the south-east every morning as an act
of homage.
Give it 'em hot, old man ; don't mind
us; we love it now. When you get
stuck for any fresh ingredients refer to
Macbeth, Act 4, Scene 1, though I
should be inclined to think you have
done this already.
Yours gratefully, H. J. Fordyce.
So far I have received no reply from
Petherton. In the circumstances I ex-
cuse his apparent hauteur.
“Ships that pass in the Night.”
“A large number of our kinsmen from over
the seas were unmarried, and he would like to
see for every shipload of them that came over
a shipload of women from this country sent

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 21st.—Although
de minimis mom curat lear, our law-
makers delight in very small jokes.
When Mr. CECIL BECK, as Vice-Cham-
berlain of the Household, delivered IIIs
MAJESTY's reply to the Address the
House of Commons was chiefly inter-
ested in watching how he would accom-
' plish the feat of walking backwards
from the Table to the Bar. More than
once in past history the task has proved
too much for the man who essayed it,
and the orderly retreat has degenerated
into a shambling rout. But there was
no such hitch to-day. Progressive
politician though he is, Mr. BECK re-
traced his steps with graceful ease,
and fully deserved the applause that
rewarded his effort.
Irreverent opponents of the PRIME
MINISTER have sometimes compared
him to Micawber, on the ground that
he was always waiting for something
to turn up. I found another link to-day
between these celebrated characters.
As Mr. Asquith unfolded the details of
the two new Votes of Credit, one of
120 millions to clear up the present
financial year, the other of 300 millions
to start the new one, he reminded me
of Micawber calculating his indebted-
ness to Traddles. While professing a
proper alarm at the colossal amount of
the expenditure—nearly two thousand
millions already, or twice the cost of
the twenty-two years' war against
NAPOLEoN — he rolled these gigantic
figures off his tongue as if he loved
them. You will remember Copperfield's
remark when the famous I.O.U. had
been handed over: “I am persuaded
not only that this was quite the same
to Mr. Micawber as paying the money,
but that Traddles himself hardly knew
the difference until he had had time
to think about it.” The
PRIME MINISTER’s financial
optimism left the House
under much the same im-
pression, and Mr. McKENNA
rather deepened it by the
declaration that with pru-
dence and statesmanship
our credit would survive the
War however long it might
last.
Tuesday, February 22nd.

out a break, Mr. George ('ºt

and to-day he seized the opportunity

railway station in his native Devon,
the Yeoman proceeded with other
counts of his indictment. The PRIME
MINISTER mentioned yesterday a new
plan by which an outside Committee,
composed of business men and headed
by a Cabinet Minister, was checking
the expenditure of the Service Depart-
ments. (The cost of shells, we were
told to-day by Dr. ADDISON, has been
brought down to a figure which means

future production.)

of his long official experience he laid
down the dictum that one Cabinet
Minister could not supervise another.
Next he attacked the new Order in
Council, which makes the Chief of the
Staff responsible for the orders given to
the Army, declaring that it reduced
Lord KITCHENER to the level of a
civilian; and finally he denounced the
Government for not making more use
of Lord FISHER. Under the stress of
these terrific blows the Government
ought to have reeled, if it did not fall.
But nothing happened, except that the
Votes on Account for four hundred and
twenty millions were by half-past seven
duly passed.
In the Lords meanwhile the Govern-
ment was sustaining a heavier attack,
arising out of their failure to stop all
supplies from reaching Germany. Lord
SYDENHAM attributed it to the Declara-
tion of London, which had crippled the
Navy; Lord BERESFORD thought it
was the result of trying to run a war
with a Cabinet that included twenty-
one amateurs. Lord LANsDown E, a
master of the quip modest, thereupon
stated the Government's intention to
add a twenty-second to the twenty-one
by appointing a Minister of Blockade.
Wednesday, February 23rd. — At
Question-time, Mr. Asquith announced
that the new Minister was Lord Robert
CECIL. It is close upon fifty years since
another Lord Robert CECIL (who had
just become Lord CRANBoRNE) entered
the Cabinet of Lord DERBY.
In consequence of the recent decision
that no Member shall in future receive
two salaries it had been rumoured
that Parliamentary salaries would be
abolished altogether. There were signs
of heartfelt relief from
various quarters of the
House when the PREMIER
met the suggestion with an
uncompromising “No."
Captain J. S. RANKINE,
the khaki-clad giant who
took his seat for East Tox-
teth to-day, had a warm
reception, all the more
grateful in view of the bliz-
zard that raged without.
The temperature of the
House fell rapidly, however,
__ when Mr. S.Now DEN pro-
's ceeded to outline his views
on the subject of peace. In
vain he attempted to show
that there was a consider-
able party in Germany
ready to come to terms if
only they knew what our

terms were. Members listened in chilly
silence. They thawed into laughter
when the Hon. Member with some
lack of humour quoted the German
CHANCELLOR's declaration, “We do not
threaten small nations; ” and they
cheered when he quoted, with intent
to condemn, Lord RoseBERY's state-
ment that Germany must be utterly
crushed. Nor was the House more
impressed by Mr. TREvELYAN's pro-
posal that as there might be a peace-
party in Germany it was our duty to
“state our full terms and find out.”
Thé PRIME MINISTER's reply was,
I fear, very painful to the pacificists.
The German CHANCELLOR's statement
he found to be one of “colossal and
shameless audacity.” German Social-
ists might prate of peace, but only
twenty out of five times that number in
the Reichstag had the courage to vote
against the War Credit. Our terms
were already on record in the speech
which he made at the Lord MAYor's
Banquet in 1914. Until Belgium—
“and I will add Serbia "- has been
fully reinstated, until France is secured
against aggression, until the smaller
nationalities are safeguarded, until
the military domination of Prussia is
destroyed, “not until then shall we or
any of our gallant Allies abate by one
jot our prosecution of this War.” The
cheers that greeted this declaration
lasted almost as long as the speech
itself. In the ensuing debate Mr.
PoNson BY, Sir W. BYLEs, and one or
two others emitted what Mr. STANTON
picturesquely described as “the croak-
ings and bleatings of the fatted lambs
who had besmirched their own country.”
But they created no effect. Mr S.Now-
DEN's early peace had been nipped by
the frost. -
Thursday, February 24th.-In both
Houses the administration of the Mili-
tary Service Act was again the subject
of criticism. From the explanations
given by Lord NEwton and Mr.
TENNANT it appears, that most of the
complaints against the recruiting offi-
cers for over-pressure have come from
men who were applying for armlets,
not for exemption. As Lord NEWTON
put it, a man, if he wants to obtain
an armlet, must run the risk of being
taken for some kind of service. Mr.
TENNANT reminded some of his critics,
not superfluously, that the object of
this Act was to get men to serve.
Lord DERBY, fresh from his triumph
as Director of Recruiting, is to act as
Chairman of the new Joint Committee
which will supervise and co-ordinate
naval and military aviation. For him,
as for that other Ariel, “there's more
work.” The same is now true of Colonel
Lockwood who, since the opening of
the Session, has been in a condition
of suspended animation. The Kitchen
Committee, in the opinion of man
Members the most important of all the
Committees, had not been set up, and
consequently could not elect a Chair-
man. How Members have lived
through more than a week without
any visible means of securing subsist-
ence it is not for me to reveal. Suffice
it to say that no case of absolute
starvation has come to my notice. To-
day all is well. The Kitchen Com-
mittee is again in being, and “Uncle
Mark" has once more been appointed
Minister of the Interior (unpaid, except
by the gratitude and affection of his
fellow-Members). Fresh responsibili-
ties have now been thrust upon him.
This afternoon it fell to him, as tempo-
rary Leader of the Opposition, to ask
the customary question as to next
week's business. Having heard the
PRIME MINISTER's reply, he sat for a
few moments as if lost in thought, cal-
culating, no doubt, by a rapid process
of mental arithmetic what the Consoli-
dated Fund Bill, Supplementary Esti-
mates and the Civil Service Vote would
amount to in terms of dinners, teas
and other light refreshments.

ON THE SPY-TRAIL.
Jimmy says his bloodhound is always
very glad to get loose after being tied
up all night, and it's because HARVEY
discovered the circulation of the blood.
Jimmy says Faithful doesn't know he
has got the circulation of the blood,
but he always has a little run round
when he gets free. It only takes him
about five minutes to do his round,
and an hour and a-half afterwards you
would never believe he had been round
at all, things are so quiet again.
Jimmy says the man next door told
him he didn't mind so much about
the circulation of the blood as the
circulation of the bloodhound. Jimmy
says it's because his chickens all begin
shouting Hooray! as soon as Faithful
starts, and they get up trees to watch
him instead of being busy laying eggs
at twopence each. Faithful doesn't
want them to go up trees, Jimmy says,
and tries to make them come down,
but they won't—not on any account—
and he has to leave them for other
things that require his attention.
Mistress. “Iss'T IT DREADFUL, JANE, About THESE ZEPPELINs?
MUNITION WORKS.’’
BUT THEY 'ADN'T ought To Do THAT NEITHER.
Jimmy says there's a charwoman in
one of the houses on Faithful's beat,
and sometimes you can hear her trying
to char him, and then lots of things
come out through the front door, with
Faithful in the middle of them. Some-
times you don't know which is Faithful
and which is a scrubbing-brush, and
it's because of the revolution. Jimmy
says if Faithful notices that anything
wants doing on his way round he
always tries to do it, even though
nobody knew that it wanted doing.
Faithful got a sparrow out of a green-
house like that, Jimmy says. It was a
cheeky sparrow and kept flying about
at Faithful and hiding behind the pots
on the stage. Jimmy says bloodhounds
don't stand any nonsense of that sort,
and the sparrow ought to have known
it. But it kept looking round flower-
pots at Faithful and chirruping at
him sideways, and didn't realise that
its life hung by a thread.
IT wouldN'T BE so wicked IF THEY only DESTROYED
THEY KNows PUFFICKLY WELL As we wants ALL THE
know that, Jimmy says, and when
Faithful got on the stage and began
clearing the decks for action it actually
had the face to go and pick up a worm
that came out of one of the pots that
fell on the ground. Jimmy says when-
ever a pot rolled off the stage Faithful
always looked over the edge to see if it
had arrived safely. He is always care-
ful like that.
Jimmy says the sparrow only escaped
by the skin of its teeth, because just as
Faithful had got everything out of the
way and was going to set to work in
earnest, the sparrow flew out and went
and sat up in a tree chirruping like
anything. Faithful was absolutely dis-
gusted with it, Jimmy says.
Jimmy took his bloodhound out to
the Hill Farm one morning. The
farmer was very glad to see Faithful
again, Jimmy says; he told Jimmy that
they were going to cut corn and there
would be a main of rabbits in them for

it seemed very curious to hear the deep
baying of a bloodhound in a peaceful
cornfield. Jimmy says it made the
men stop work and look at each other,
and the man who was driving the reap-
ing-machine got down to see where it
wanted oiling. You see he hadn't heard
a bloodhound before.
There was another dog there, Jimmy
says, in case the rabbits came out too
quickly for Faithful to catch them all.
The first rabbit that came out didn't
have any chance, Jimmy says. It bolted
out as hard as it could, and there was
a splendid race between the rabbit and
Faithful. You see the rabbit was
making for a burrow in the hedge, but
old Faithful got there first and tried to
get his head down it, to cut off the
rabbit's retreat. Jimmy says
the rabbit was nonplussed, and
the other dog caught it easily.
It is beautiful to see two dogs
work together like that, Jimmy
says.
Jimmy says Faithful didn't
require the help of the other
dog with the next rabbit that
came his way, but the other
dog was very impulsive. You
see Faithful was lying down
with his mouth open trying to
look like a rabbit hole, and he
did it so well that the rabbit
came straight at him. Jimmy
says Faithful swerved about
ten yards to one side in order
to hurl himself bodily at the
rabbit, and he would have done
it if the other dog hadn't poked
his nose in. - - -
Jimmy says the other dog
killed the rabbit, but Faithful
The man noticed something was

Jimmy to have his neck wrung: he
offered to do it himself.
Jimmy says the man seemed very

T.B. (you know : Totally Bulged); but
Jimmy took up Faithful and shook
him for the man to hear, and there
wasn't any sound of broken crockery
at all.
The other man who had lost his din-
ner didn't bother to look for it; he was
busy cutting a stick out of the hedge,
and when he had done it he bor-
rowed a piece of bacon from another
man to present to Faithful. Jimmy
says you do it by saying, “Dear little

to the police. The policeman told
Jimmy that they had just taken the
German governess away to the police-
station. -
Jimmy says that when he got home
he sat down and looked at Faithful for
half-an-hour—just looked at him. To
think that Faithful had been on the
Spy Trail all the time and Jimmy never
knew it!

went up and smelt at it like
anything. Faithful is a splendid smeller,
Jimmy says. He can retrieve rabbits
almost as well as he can catch them.
The farmer was surprised to see how
quickly Faithful got off the mark at
the sound of the gun. You see the
farmer was standing close by Faithful
and he had no sooner shot at a rabbit
than away went Faithful right across
two fields, retrieving as hard as he could.
Jimmy had to fetch him back from
doing it.
Jimmy says it was a new experience
for the men to have a trained blood-
hound in the harvest field, and they
could talk of nothing else whilst they
were having their dinners. You see
two of the men had mislaid their
dinners somehow, and every time they
looked at Faithful they kept wondering.
One man said his dinner was in a
pudding-basin, and he looked every-
where. Faithful did his best to help
him, Jimmy says, and kept just two
yards ahead of him, twisting in and out.
says bloodhounds don't like husky
voices, they get on their nerves. So
Faithful refused the bacon as hard as
he could. -
Jimmy says he knew Faithful would
follow him, and sure enough, when he
had got a mile on his way home, there
was Faithful waiting for him, holding
the pudding-basin in his mouth by the
cloth.
Jimmy says when he got home there
was quite a crowd round the house
where Faithful had removed the green-
house from off the sparrow. A police-
man told Jimmy all about it. It
appeared, so the policeman said, that
some person or persons unknown had
got to know that the people in the

[MARCH 1, 1916.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I THINK I never read a story that impressed me as more
untimely than this to which Mr. Ivor BRowN has given
the title of Security (SECKER). It is about an Oxford Don,
one John Grant, who became, as others have become, irked
by the placid routine of Senior Common-Room existence,
and yearned for adventure. So he came to London, and
got his first dose of it as a labour-agitator and backer of
strikes. I suppose that the atmosphere of labour-agitating
and strike-backing is skilfully conveyed (that of Oxford
donship undoubtedly is), but I can't tell you how antique
it all seems. These scornful quotations from an imaginary
Capitalist press and the fierce denial that industrial strife
was ever assisted by foreign agencies—it all sounds like a
voice from ancient history. One rubs one's ears at it.
Eventually militant Socialism wearies John as much as
academic torpor had done, and to escape from both he
marries a wife. More atmosphere, this time of a dreary
little seaside town and its so-called society. But John
fares no better here; and at last, on his return from a
walking holiday, he finds that -
Mrs. John, unable to put up =
with him any longer, is putting
up without him at a London
hotel in company with An-
other. That seems a situation
insecure enough to satisfy the .
most exacting. But even from -
this nothing results, and hus-
band and wife drift together =
again. I like to think that
nowadays, what with Zeps and
other things, poor old John
may grow really contented.
Meanwhile, clever as it is, the
tale seems oddly anaemic and
unreal. It is like those tragi-
cally trivial journals of 1914
that still survive in the dusty
waiting-rooms of dentists. I o
don't suggest that Mr. BRowN, -- - - - -
whose previous book I much admired, should write about
the War; but I could wish him a little more in tune with
the spirit it has produced.

TEUTON OVERTURES.
As SEEN THROUGH TEUTON EYEs.
These English—who can know their ways?
When, flushed with triumphs large and many,
We condescend with tactful signs
To hint of peace on generous lines
They answer in a flippant phrase
That they're “not taking any.”
When from our conquering High-Seas Ark
(Detained at home by stress of weather)
We loosed the emblematic dove,
Conveying overtures of love,
Back came the bird with that remark,
Minus its best tail feather.
They said they never wanted war;
Yet, when we talk of war's abating,
And name the price for them to pay,
They have the curious nerve to say
That, when they please, and not before,
They'll do their own dictating.
How can you deal with minds so slow,
With men who give no indication
That we by any further shock
Into their heads can hope to knock
Enough intelligence to know
That they're a beaten nation?
Odd that we cannot make it clear
That we have won; and even odder
That other markets seem to jump,
While our exchange is on the slump,
And everything's starvation-dear

RECONSTRUCTION.
IN that dim happy past, the Summer of 1913, I first saw
him idly seated in a deck-chair on the firm sands of
, on the East Coast. A quiet detached figure amid a
crowd of joyous children. Hard by a boy and girl were
building a moated fortress, but, alas! the swiftly incoming
tide eroded its foundations until the frowning battlements
tottered to destruction.
Turning, the children faced him. He smiled.
“D’ you know this one, Jacky 2” he ventured.
“He’s Dick,” the little maid protested, “and I'm Betty.”
“Now we're introduced, do you know this one?” he
asked again.
Straightaway he plunged into the new game, moving
back to where a smooth stretch of sand lay invitingly.
Immediately two minute shapes were etched with his stick
on its surface.
“What's those 2"
“Hairpins, of course! You always start with hairpins.
And this,” indicating a narrow oblong, “why, this must
be that silver tray someone's always leaving her hairpins
lying about on. Now for the hair-brushes—two of those—"
(unerringly symmetrical)—“then the comb—” (equipped
with most effective sand-teeth)—“then a powder-box2
Well, a very little one—”
As fast as he thought of them, fresh articles (or their
symbols) came into being. There was no pause. “The
shoe-horn, the button-hook, oh! and a clothes-brush—”
Immediately following the last hair of the clothes-brush
a rectangle put in an appearance around these assorted
objects.
“Mummy's dressing-table,” asserted Master Dick autho-
ritatively.
“Sound man' What else do we want?”
The children suggested alternately and in chorus the
completion of the plan. An armchair with cushions
incredibly soft, a fire-place pokered and tonged, a wardrobe
(disproportionately enormous), two colossal hat-boxes, and
detail after detail, with finally the door, the key-hole and
the key.

The little hamlet somewhere in France had been
shelled spasmodically for months. Possibly there was
something faintly familiar in the seated figure of that
Captain of Engineers that caught my eye; one did not
often come across Captains of Engineers sitting on débris
in the village street. He squatted on a pile of granular
masonry before a rudely prepared space surrounded by
three small ragged children gazing round-eyed at some-
thing he was drawing with half a Nilgiri cane in the
powdered rubble. I paused to look, and there arose before
me the picture of a man with a boy and girl on a bygone
day in happy England.
“On commence avec le sel,” he was explaining as he
indicated the shape of a salt-cellar. “Eh b'en, après ca
quat' assiettes, des couteaux, des fourchettes ’’ All
the appurtenances of a homely table were quickly put
in. “Et puis la table, n'est-ce pas ? Et surtout faut pas
oublier quelqu'chose à manger, eh, Jeanne?”
“Non, monsieur.” But the little girl was busy pointing
to where a small brown bird pecked fruitlessly in the dust.
“Regardez, donc, le p"tit oiseau; il n'a pas mangé, c'lui là.”
“Y a pas grande chose à manger; les Boches, vous
savez, ont passé par ici,” added one of the two boys quite
impersonally.
The Captain of Engineers continued quickly, “Maintenant
il faut mettre le—” he paused for the word—“le—table-
cloth." The children grasped his meaning from the
comprehensive gesture. Rapidly he outlined chairs, a de-
lightful baby's cradle, a clock with cuckoo complete, a fire-
place, until at length a complete pictorial inventory had
been made of the contents of the living-room of just such
a cottage as had obviously been buried beneath the
rubbish heap upon which he sat. Those children of the
stricken country-side entered with keenness into the spirit of
the make-believe. The little girl, searching for an appro-
priate stone to place on the imaginary table for imaginary
bread, thrust her hand down among the débris and, with-
drawing it, exposed a relic. It was the faded remnant of
a baby's shoe, grotesque in the autumn sunshine.
“Oui, par exemple, les Boches ont passé par ici,”
said the little boy as impersonally as before.
In a Good Cause.
An auction of stamps will be held on the 13th and 14th
of March at 47, Leicester Square, in aid of the National
Philatelic War Fund, the proceeds to be given to the
Societies of the British Red Cross and St. John of Jerus-
alem. Collectors should seize this chance, as the Allies
may shortly be arranging to modify the map of the world.
“The year 1914 showed a drop of 441 million eggs in the year.”

Taking our population as 46 millions this means 9 eggs
dropped per head in the year. Under the influence of
the thrift campaign a great effort is being made to drop
only half an egg per head this year, but should there be
a General Election there may be a rise in the drop.

Visitor. “AND what DID You Do WHEN THE shell struck You?”
BED AIRED.”
THE GREAT MAN.
EveRY Saturday, about four P.M., I am
to be found worshipping at the Shrine
of the Open Mind. Once within its
portals I put off the subfusc vestments
of J. Watson, Esq., Barrister-at-Law,
and become simply Uncle James. This
alone is a tonic. To-day as I ascended
the steps of the temple there floated
down to me the voices of the priestesses
chanting, evidently in a kind of frenzy,
and to the air of a famous Scottish
reel, this rhyme—
“Daddy is a Sergeant, a Sergeant, a Sergeant
Daddy is a Sergeant, a Sergeant of Police.”
So I opened the nursery door and
went in. An uncle has no honour in his
own country, and my two small nieces
assaulted me immediately. Phyllis
dragged me to a chair, while Lillah
shrieked unrelentingly in my ear that
Daddy was a sergeant.
“So the special constables have seen
that your father is a born policeman 2"
I said as I sat down.
“The special ones,” nodded Phyllis
with profound pride.
“Magnificent,” I murmured. “He
has at last justified his choice of the
law as a profession.”
“Tell us,” said Lillah, “with the air
with which one speaks of a self-made
man who has just appeared in the
Honours List—“tell us how Daddy
started.”
“He went to the Bar,” I said.
“Bar 2" echoed Lillah.
“Why, yes,” I said; “it’s a place
where people wait.”
“Like a station ?”
“Only the trains don't always come
in. Anyway, on one side of the bar are
a lot of young men waiting for some-
thing to turn up, and on the other a lot
of old men writing autobiographies.”
“But aren't there any middling-
olders?” This is Phyllistian for men
of middle age. -
“Not allowed,” I said. “At the Bar
you are either a junior or a reminiscer.”
“What's that 2 ''
“It's an illness that attacks people
who aren't really famous.”
Phyllis stared. “Like measles?”
I nodded.
“Oh,” cried Lillah eagerly, “do the
reminiscers go all pink?"
|
“They ought to,” said I.
There was a silence. The round
eyes of Phyllis were full of suspicion.
“Daddy said,” she remarked slowly,
“that he did law.” -
“So he does,” I answered.
“Well, what 's that, then 2 ”
Small girls ask questions in two
words which wise men must write
books to answer.

reasons for things that are unreason-
able.”
“Like what?” said Phyllis.
I laughed a little uneasily.
was getting difficult.
“Oh—er—things like getting mar-
ried,” I said, “and refraining from
shooting little girls who ask questions.”
I admit that this sort of joke is the
last infirmity of an uncle's otherwise
noble mind. They regarded me sadly.
Then Lillah turned to Phyllis with a
detached air. “Uncle James is being
grand,” she said, “because he doesn't
know what law is.”
“Don’t you?” said Phyllis.
“Perhaps not,” I murmured feebly.

“You’ve told us wrong,” said Phyllis
sternly. “Daddy isn't ever wrong.”
“So he's risen from his bar to be a

one finishing a story with a moral.
I'm afraid I chuckled. It was in
very bad taste, of course, but I couldn't
help it. I suppose George is one of
the most egregious Micawbers of the

was her sergeant, the star part of the
piece. But the show was a frost,
though Lillah gave an excellent imita-

Hun inserting bacilli into the nation's
aqua pura. Yes, I'm afraid I was the
failure. I couldn't get to grips with
my part, and the whole thing was so
obviously a charity performance, with
Phyllis ordering herself sternly about
to try and help me through.
We were halfway through the second

166 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARCH 8, 1916.
AN EMBARGO ON INK.
GREAT PUBLIC MEETING.
MR. RUNCIMAN, President of the
Board of Trade, having stated that the
Government was following up its re-
strictions on the importation of paper
by drastic new rules concerning our
supplies of ink, a public meeting of
protest was immediately called. Mr.
T. P. O'Notor, M.P., took the chair,
and he was supported by many of the
most illustrious ink-men of the day.
The Chairman, having first read
a number of letters apologising for
absence, one of which was, of course,
from Lord Southbluff, who specialises
in this epistolary form, proceeded to
pour scorn on the Board of Trade's
decision. How can the Board of Trade,
he asked pointedly, know its business
as well as we do? If it hopes, by
curtailing the supplies of ink that
come to England, to make room for the
more important necessaries of life, it is
mistaken. There is nothing more im-
portant than ink. (Cheers.) Without
ink what are we ? (A voice: “Not
much.”) Without ink, how can adver-
tisements be written ? (Cries of
“Shame!") Among all forms of
human endeavour none was nobler
than putting one word after another.
(Applause.) That is what SHAKSPEARE
did. (Hear, hear.) Always with the
assistance of ink. (Cheers.) And
what would England be like without
SHARspEARE 2 (Renewed cheers.) Had
Mr. RUNCIMAN thought of that ? He
(the speaker) would venture to say he
had not. In any case ink must be
saved. (Loud applause.)
Mr. Harry Austinson, Editor of The
English Revue, rose to protest against
the Board of Trade action. To put an
embargo upon ink was, he held, nothing
less than an outrage. Ink was the
life-blood of British liberty, and he for
one would never hesitate to spill the
last drop, either in his own select
periodical or in a Sunday paper for
the masses. The mere fact that the
feeling against ink was inaugurated by
a Member of the Government automa-
tically proved it wrong. No good could
come from such a corrupt agglomera-
tion of salary-seekers as the Coalition
Ministry. Speaking as one who knew
Germany from within, he would say
that to put any obstacle in the way
of the public expression of opinion in
Ingland was to help the foe. (Hear,
hear.)
Mr. Bernold Pennit said that the
Government's action paralysed him.
For years he had been in the habit of
writing his ten thousand words a day.
It did not much matter what they
were about; the point was that they
were written. Otherwise he could not
keep in good health. Where another
man might do Swedish exercises, ride,
walk, eat or play golf, he, Mr. Pennit,
wrote. (Hear, hear.) It might be an
attack on British stupidity; it might
be a eulogy of Mr. Asquith ; it might
be a description of the arrival of a ton
of coal at an auctioneer's private resi-
dence in Handley and its transference
to the cellar and the discovery that
there was one hundredweight one stone
short. Whatever the theme, there
were ten thousand words in any case,
and unless he could write them daily
he was lost. The tragic thing was that
he could write only in ink and with
his own hand. (Sensation.) Before
meddling with ink there were all sorts
of things for the Government to forbid.
Golf balls, for one. He wished to
express his complete dissatisfaction
with Mr. RUNCIMAN's insane proposal.
(Cheers.)
Mr. Bolaire Hillock thought that a
great deal too much fuss was being
made about ink. The Board of Trade
was, of course, an ass; that goes with-
out saying (Ça va sans dire); but it is
childish of literary men to come there
and pretend to be nonplussed. Let
them rather show themselves superior
to such trumpery legislation. As an
old campaigner he could tell them what
to do. When he was an artilleryman
in France, and writing a series of
articles on the Reformation at the same
time, he mixed an excellent substitute
for ink out of the ashes of his pipe and
claret. There were countless things
that could be utilised, including black-
ing, seethed mushrooms, boiled ash-
buds, and the juice of the pickled walnut.
With such resources as these we in-
tended to go on writing and drawing
diagrams long after Mr. RUNCIMAN was
forgotten. (Loud cheers.)
Lord Penge said that one of the
purest pleasures of life was writing to
The Times, and how could that be done
if there was no ink? Some people
doubtless could use pencil ; but he
personally could not. Others had
typewriters or dictated to typists, but
that was beyond him. To him there
were few delights more complete than
to dip his pen in the forbidden fluid
and begin, “Sir.” (Applause.)
The Rev. R. Trampbell said that not
during his whole career as a clergy-
man of the Church of England could
he remember a more monstrous pro-
posal than this one to reduce the
supply of ink. To him ink was more
precious than radium, for it enabled
him to express his thoughts and thus
come into intimate relationship with
his fellow-beings. It might be within
the knowledge of the meeting that he
was in the habit of contributing every
week an article on the War to the
Sunday papers. It was not on tactics,
but on some subject of spiritual interest
connected with the War, and he had

for this article to be lightly disposed
of. He felt sure that he had the great
weight of his beloved Church of Eng-
land at the back of him when he
uttered this protest.
Mr. Chester Gilbertson said that
neither the restriction on ink or paper
would worry him. There was nothing
he couldn't write with, and nothing he
couldn't write on. He had written
many of his best articles with a piece
of chalk on one of his black coats, and
many of his worst on cab and railway-
carriage windows with a diamond ring
which he had compelled a commer-
cial traveller to relinquish. (Cheers.)
Rather than not express an opinion on
whatever was forward, he would carve
his views on a rock and himself carry
the rock to the printing office. (Loud
cheers.) The Runcimen of this world
were created purely in order to be
defied.
Mr. Bernard Jaw said that of course
for the Government to pretend that
the cargo space now occupied by ink
was needed for something else was
rubbish. The Government's real reason
was that they were terrified of the critics
and thought to muzzle them in this way.
But he for one—and he knew for a
fact that the Government dreaded his
genius acutely and would give much
if they could still the blistering accuracy
of his pen—he for one would not be
daunted.
At this point a special messenger
arrived bearing a letter for the Chair-
man, who, after reading it, asked leave
to put the meeting in possession of its
terms, as it somewhat altered the situ-
ation. It was, in fact, from the Board
of Trade, and stated that, owing to a
misprint, the recent decision concerning
ink had been misunderstood. It was
not ink that was to be restricted, but
zinc. (Cheers.) In the circumstances
perhaps they might adjourn.
The meeting then broke up peace-
ably, although Mr. Bernard Jaw did
his best to collect an audience for a
new speech on the monstrosity of in-
terfering with zinc.

ton Government has left him in the air.

I MET him near the entrance of the
Institute, where I was waiting to see
the Superintendent. He approached
with light, nervous steps, and his
haggard eyes met mine questioningly.
“A fine morning,” I remarked.
“It is,” he agreed; “and if you would

“It's Saturday,” I said, wondering
a little.
“I—I feared so,” he said and clutched
me by the arm. “Listen. This is the
day when I have to make up my five
columns—seven hundred lines, brevier
type. It is my destiny to give advice,
and you can have it without the asking.
Take, for example, the Rhode Island
Rabbit—a noble strain and rich in
phosphates. Plant out at the beginning
of April in a mixture consisting of two
parts road-grit, two parts table-scraps,
and a deed of assignment, and by the
end of October they will be throw-

also hardy and prolific, though pug-
nacious if reared under glass. In the
absence of a specified agreement a
dose of tartaric acid that has been
well stewed with the mutton left over
from Sunday will usually put matters
straight. Snip off shoots that show
signs of becoming broody, and give a
mash of middlings at quarter-day.
“We now come to the Light Sussex

kept in hutches, which may be obtained
at any oil-shop at about fivepence per
pint. Grasp firmly by the wings when
lifting, and explain the matter to your

be housed in kennels which have been
thoroughly disinfected with peat-moss,

rubbed well into the roots before break-

regard to the Squirrel-tailed Borzois,

volatile, one drachm; to be taken every
calendar month from date of contract.”
A large, genial man, with an official
manner—he was, I discovered, the
under - superintendent — approached,
and the haggard man moved rapidly
away.
“A painful case,” I observed.
“Very,” said the large man. “Journ-
alist of the name of Criddle—Jabez Wil-
berforce Criddle. He used to run the
Gardening section of The Sunday Helio.
Then the chap that was responsible for

Criddle got his column as well as his
own. Next, the “Poultry Gossip' man
went, and they gave Criddle that, and
when a week later the ‘Cookery Notes'
woman took up V.A.D. work he got
her share too. He struggled along
gamely enough until “Auntie Gladys,"
who ran ‘Our Baby' column, became
a tram-conductress; but, when they
passed him that, his mind went, and
the proprietors sent him here.”
I inquired as to the possibilities of
recovery.
“There is hope,” said the large man,
“that the trouble may not last beyond
the duration of the War. But we
shan't feel that we've made a fair start

AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE.
“WELL, I'M off To My DREssMAKER's. I can't sir HERE ANY LoNGER BEING EconoMISED AT BY THAT GIRL's clothes.”
THE WORLD sET FREE.
(An awful prospect.)
LoNg, long ago, when I had not attested,
I prized the liberties of this proud race,
The right of speech, from haughty rulers wrested,
The right to put one's neighbours in their place;
I liked to argue and I loved to pass
Slighting remarks on Robert, who's an ass,
To hint that Henry's manners were no class,
Or simply say I did not like his face.
But things are changed. To-day I had a tussle
With some low scion of an upstart line;
Meagre his intellect, absurd his muscle,
I should have strafed him in the days long syne;
I took a First, and he could hardly parse;
I have more eloquence but he more stars;
Yet (so insane the ordinance of Mars)
I must say “Yessir,” and salute the swine.
And it was hard when that abrupt Staff-Major
Up to the firing-line one evening came
(Unknown his motive, probably a wager),
And said quite rudely, “You are much to blame;
Those beggars yonder you should enfilade.”
I fingered longingly a nice grenade;
I said those beggars were our First Brigade,
But might not call him any kind of name.
Yet not for ever shall the bard be muted
By stars and stripes, but freely, as of yore,
When swords are sheathed and I'm civilian-suited,
I shall have speech with certain of my corps,
Speak them the insults which I now but brood:
“Pompous,” “incompetent,” “too fond of food,”
And fiercely taste the bliss of being rude
And unrestrained by Articles of War.
That will be great; but what if such intentions
Are likewise present in the Tenth Platoon?
What if some labourer of huge dimensions
Meet me defenceless in a Tube saloon,
And hiss his catalogue of unpaid scores,
How oft I criticised his forming fours,
Or prisoned him behind the Depôt doors,
Or kept him digging on the Fourth of June?
Painful. And then, when all these arméd millions
Unknot with zest the military noose,
Will the whole world be full of wroth civilians,
Each one exulting in a tongue let loose?
And who shall picture or what bard shall pen
The crowning horror which awaits us then—
That civil warfare of uncivil men
In one great Armageddon of abuse ?

FRANK.
IN my first formal introduction to
Frank he appeared, together with his
clothing and various belongings, as an
item in a list of things to be taken over.
I knew him already by reputation, and
I remembered some of the occasions
when he had appeared on parade. Also
I knew that two successive Company
Commanders had managed in turn to
exchange him with some unsuspecting
newly appointed O.C. Company for
something more tractable. This last
process, indeed, accounted for my
having to take him over instead of the
mild creature with the duck-waddle
action which my predecessor had
ridden or, let me say, sat.
It became then my lot to take over
Frank, or, to put it more correctly, I
was issued with him. That is part of
the military principle of fixing respon-
sibility. Things are not issued to you;
you are issued with them, and you
alone are accountable. I was issued
with Frank and all his harness and
appointments and, incidentally, his
parlour tricks. This was the formal
introduction. I didn't meet him at
close range until later. When I was
issued with him I didn't even know his
name. No previous owner had ever
thought of asking it, and had they
asked they would not have believed
that a horse could be called Frank. On
general principles it seems wrong, but
on nearer acquaintance I found that
Frank was exactly the name for him.
The great thing about him was that if
he thought a thing he said it.
For example, when I first mounted
him he thought he would prefer to
remain in the stable where he had been
for the best part of a week. He said
so quite candidly. I am nothing very
great as a handler of wild animals,
and he gave me three minutes made
up of every action in his repertoire—
no limited one. At the end of it I very
kindly dismounted. I didn't want him
to think I was not intelligent enough
to understand what he meant, and
moreover I hated the idea of marring
our first meeting by refusing so unmis-
takable a request. So he was led back
to his quarters and the incident closed,
if not with mutual goodwill at least
with some degree of satisfaction fairly
evenly distributed among the parties.
It was, I remember, on the next
morning that the Mess Sergeant noticed
a shortage of lump sugar in one of the
basins. I mention this merely because
it fixes in my mind the first day on
which I had a comfortable ride. Frank
started out in a good temper and came
home at his best pace, hoping to get
some more sugar. That, at least, is
how I read his meaning, and I pur-
sued my policy of not misunderstand-
ing him. After this he developed a
parlour trick which made me quite
fond of him. When I went to the
stable he would put his nose round to
the side pocket where I kept the sugar.
He always got some, and he knew
there would always be some more when
he got home.
Thus it became necessary to instruct
him in topography. He quickly learned
that certain turnings led to the camp,
and I was reduced to subterfuges to
prove to him that they did not. It
was essential to go over every road
at various times in opposite directions.
That confused him, and though I dis-
liked the deception I had to resort to
it, with the result that Frank finally
accepted me at my own fictitious valua-
tion as a person who did not properly
know his own mind.
But it took him some time to get
into my ways. Once we spent twenty
minutes on a small stretch of road
leading from the parade ground to a
railway bridge. I wanted to cross the
bridge and Frank did not. I took him
towards the bridge and he took me
back towards the camp. This happened
thirteen times. At the fourteenth
there was a variation; he changed his
mind and we crossed the bridge. Dur-
ing the twenty minutes, I remember,
we had a further slight disagreement
about a stick. I was glad I had brought
it, and he was not. But on the other
side of the bridge we let bygones be
bygones. Frank had his moods, but
he was always a gentleman.
He was also a soldier. His strong
point really was that he was excellent
on parade. He would look round,
grasp the formation at a glance, and
drop into his place. He was never
more happy than when route-marching;
never more unhappy than when com-
pelled to break out of the line. Indeed,
so much did he enjoy column of route
that when off duty with two or three
other horses he would play at route-
marching, taking up a position in
Indian file and avoiding any sort of
arrangement which brought him
abreast of his companions.
At last we had to part. I don't
know the right way to express this.
Possibly I was reissued without him;
I am not sure what the process was.
At any rate we separated, he remaining
at the camp and I proceeding on duty
to the Depôt. I said good-bye to him
and he nuzzled for the last time at
my side pocket. Having munched the
sugar, he turned to the more serious
business of his manger. I think this
must have been his way of concealing
his emotion. -

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, February 29th.-Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE announced to-day that the
Members of the Cabinet had decided to
take one - fourth of their salaries in
Exchequer Bonds. Murmurs of ap-
plause followed, and before they had
died away Mr. Hogg|E launched his
great joke. Leading up to it with the
remark that Exchequer Bonds can be
sold the next day, he asked, “Would it
not be a good idea to call them the
Laughing Stock 2" Mr. Hogg|E is not
one of the chartered jesters of the House
so his jeu d'esprit just
caused “a laugh,” as the
reporters say, and nothing
in Ore.
On the Third Reading
of the Consolidated Fund
Bill Sir John SIMON re-
newed his attack upon
the Military Service Bill.
The tribunals, he de-
clared, were disregarding
the appeal of the widow's
only son; the Yellow
Form, of which the late
Home Secretary takes the
same jaundiced view as he
did of the Yellow Press,
was being sent out indis-
criminately to all whom it
did not concern : the War
Office had issued a mis-
leading poster; and every-
where men were being
“bluffed" into the Army.
He himself would have
been inundated with cor-
respondence if he had not -
had the happy inspiration Y \
of diverting the flood into
Mr. TENNANT's letter-box.
Passionately he called up-
on the Government not
to imitate Germany's
brutality.
Mr. LONG, suave as usual, deprecated
Sir John SIMON's ferocity, reminded
him that all cases of hardship could be
considered by the Appeal Tribunals,
and promised to investigate the cases
that had been mentioned. “May I
send in my list too?” asked Mr. WATT.
But Mr. LoNG, unwilling to share the
fate of Mr. TENNANT, suggested that
the SECRETARY FoR Scotland would
form a more appropriate dumping-
ground for Mr. WATT's dossier.
After Mr. SNow DEN, Sir THoMAs
WHITTAKER and Mr. Lough had rein-
forced Sir John SIMON's case with
added instances the Government found
an unexpected champion in Mr. HEALY.
He was amazed to hear the late Home
Secretary—“one of the Ministers who
made the War"—gloating over the in-

when round Verdun was raging a battle
in which the fate of Paris, and perhaps
of London, was involved. Why had
he not imitated the monumental silence
of Mr. BURNs 2 Instead, he, the sup-
pressor of obscure Irish newspapers,
had done more to injure recruiting
than any Connemara editor.
I never expected to live to hear the
Bank of England described in the
House of Commons as a useless insti-
tution. In Mr. HEALY's opinion, “The
Old Lady of Threadneedle Street,” like
the other who lived in a shoe, has too

PRINGLE subsequently described it, to
say the rudest things about her finan-
cial capacity.
Wednesday, March 1st.—Sir OweN
PHILIPPs, once Liberal Member for
Pembroke, returned to the House to-

To signalise the capture of so gigantic
a prize—he is 6ft. 6in. in his stockinged
feet—Lord EDMUND TALBOT and Sir
G. YoUNGER, Unionist Whips, con-
ducted him to the Table; and as they
are both of moderate height the pro-
cession gave the effect of a Mauretania
going to her moorings in charge of a
couple of tugs.
When Dr. MACNAMARA moved a
Supplementary Estimate of £10 for the
Navy, I was reminded of PRAED's lines
“On seeing the SPEAKER asleep in his
chair '':
“Hume, no doubt, will be taking the sense
Of the House on a saving of thirteen
pence.”
But there were differences. The £10
was not an ordinary “ten-pun' note”
but was a “token" representing some-
thing like four and a half millions re-
ceived by the Fleet for services rendered
to Foreign Powers and others; and
Mr. WHITLEY, who was in the Chair,
so far from being asleep, was intensely
wide - awake. : Members
who sought to discuss
Naval policy generally
were promptly pulled up,

ing such a reduction of the
Fleet as unpatriotic even

A vote for £37,000 to
extend the British Con-
sulate buildings at Cairo
united both sides of the
House in criticism. Mr.
AsHLEY thought what was
good enough for Lord
CROMER should be good
enough for his successor.
Mr. Hogge, by a some-
what obscure process of
reasoning, now understood
why the Germans were so
anxious to get to Egypt.
In vain Mr. LEwis HAR-
court, usually so per-
suasive, explained that
they were now buying for £3 10s. a
metre land for which the owner wanted
£12 a metre not long ago. Sir F. BAN-
BURY, shaking his pince-nez at the
Treasury Bench, retorted that he might
ask £5 for this pair of glasses, for
which he had paid half-a-crown (more
war economy), but he would not expect
to get it. -
A vote for £50,000, to complete the
purchase of the estate of Colonel HALL-
WALKER, who has presented his racing
stud to the Government, evoked some
opposition and much facetiousness.
Mr. AcLAND, who proposed it, did
not help his case by remarking that
personally he regarded racing as a low
form of sport. The fact that some of
the horses have been leased by the War
Department to Lord LONSDALE for
racing purposes “on sharing terms"

By boyhood's scrutiny unsparing;
Where ev'ry trick of gait or speech
Is most inexorably noted,
And masters, more than what they teach,
Are studied, criticised and quoted.
His idols mostly left them cold—
BAGEHOT, MATT. ARNOLD, Scott and
MILTON ;
But they were quick in taking hold
Of PRAED and J. K. S. and HILTON;
And once undoubtedly he scored
When, on a day of happy omen,
He introduced them to A. WARD,
The wisest of the tribe of showmen.
But still his fervours left them calm—
Emotion they considered freakish;-
He felt with many an inward qualm
That he was thoroughly un-beakish ;
His mood perplexed them; he was half
Provocative, half deferential,
Too anxious to provoke a laugh,
Too vague where logic was essential.
So, struggling on to bridge the gaps
That seventeen from sixty sunder,
And causing at his best, perhaps,
A mild and intermittent wonder,
At least he recognised the truth
That there are other ways of earning
The sympathy of clear-eyed youth
Than by a mere parade of learning.
And yet I think his pupils may
In after years, at camp or college,
Admit that in his rambling way
He added to their stock of knowledge;
And, as they ruefully recall
His “jaws” on CLAUSEwitz and
JoMINI,
On BALZAC, HEINE and JEAN PAUL,
Think kindly of their dug-out dominie.

ordinary unreinforced variety.
A Happy Family.
“A milk deliverer 31 years of age, who ap-
plied for exemption, said his father was an
Atheist, his mother was “all the other way
about,’ and his brother was a Socialist, and if
he went away there would be war at home.
He considered that he should stay at home to
keep the peace.”—Western Evening Herald.
But a merciful tribunal, thinking that
he was more likely to find it in the

My companion had come into the compartment hurriedly
just as the train started. He was a small, middle-aged,
sandy-haired man with a straggling tufted beard, the sort
of beard that looks as if it owed its origin rather to forget-
fulness than to any settled design. The expression on his
face and, indeed, over his whole body was a deprecating
one. He reminded me of a dog who has transgressed and
begs humbly for forgiveness. He had no newspaper, and
accepted the offer of one of mine with a deference of grati-
tude that struck me as excessive. Soon after that we slid
into a conversation about the War and made most of the
usual remarks.
“It's wonderful,” he said, “how the country maintains
its financial stability. Five millions a day, you know. It's
a pretty big sum, and yet nobody seems to feel it. Here
we are, for instance, you and I, travelling first-class.”

prefer writing to kicking, you can write to me as if I’d
written the anonymous letter or article or whatever it may

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. MAURICE HEWLETT's latest volume, Frey and His
Wife (WARD, Lock), suffers from the defect of being in
reality a long short story puffed out to the dimensions of a
short novel; and in consequence, even with large type—
most grateful to the reviewing eye; Heaven forbid I should
complain of that l—and a blank page between each chapter,
it has considerable difficulty in filling its volume. It is a
tale of antique Iceland and Norway. The first part, which
is really padding and has nothing whatever to do with
Frey or his matrimonial affairs, treats of one Ogmund, who
was called Ogmund Dint, for the very good reason that he
had been literally dinted as to the skull. It was done by a
gentleman named Halward. Everybody naturally expected
Ogmund to dint back; but he was something of a conscien-
tious objector in the matter of face-to-face dinting, and
being too proud for vulgar conflict he bided his time till he
could cut Halward's throat with the minimum of personal
inconvenience. End of padding and appearance of Frey.
There is a picture of Frey on the cover by Mr. MAURICE
GREIFFENHAGEN. You know already what the GREIFFEN-
HAGEN vikings are like—high-coloured, well developed and
(if I dare say it) sometimes a trifle wooden. Frey indeed
looked so very wooden that in my foolish ignorance I was
tempted to protest. But the astonishing fact is that Frey
was not only wooden in appearance, but in actuality. How
then could he have for wife a slip of a sixteen-year-old
maid that you may have met before in Mr HEWLETT's
romances? This however is the real story, which (pardon
me) I do not mean to tell. If it is no tremendous matter,
it will at least please an idle hour, which will be almost
time enough for you to enjoy every word of it.
These Lynnekers (CASSELL) is yet another example of
the “family” novel whose increasing popularity I have
lately noticed. It is a clever and interesting story—the
name of Mr. J. D. BERESFORD assured me in advance that
it would be—and, when it is finished, the characters go on
living and speaking in one's mind, which is, I suppose, a
sound proof of their vitality. Yet in a sense vitality was
just what most of the Lynneker tribe chiefly lacked. They
were an ancient and honourable house, country-born to the
third and fourth generation, and all of them far too con-
ventional and apathetic and fuss-hating ever to follow any
but the line of least resistance. All of them, that is, except
progeny, and in more senses than one a sport. How Dickie
released himself from the shackles of family tradition, how
he grew up and bustled things about, and generally made
a real instead of a conventional success—this is the matter
of the tale. All the characters are well-drawn, and about
Dickie himself there is a compelling virility that rushes you
along in his rather tempestuous wake. I am not sure that
I altogether believe in his attitude towards the question of
sex. He appeared to think generally too little, and on
occasions remarkably too much, about it. Also the painful
detail with which the author lingers over the death of old
Canon Lynneker (that attractive and human figure of
ecclesiastical gentility) roused me to resentment. When will
our novelists learn that, as regards the physical side of
mortality, reticence is by far the better part of realism?
This marred a little my pleasure in a story for whose
quality and workmanship I should else have nothing but
praise.

In A Frenchwoman's Notes on the War (CoNSTABLE)
Mademoiselle CLAIRE DE PRATz discourses pleasantly and
patriotically of sundry effects of the War on French life
and character. She is excusably proud of the part which
her fellow-countrywomen have played. The women of
France seem to have accomplished to admiration what we
in England are only beginning to understand. Quietly,
almost automatically, Frenchwomen have slipped into the
men's vacant places and carried on the work of the country.
The industry and resourcefulness of the average French-
woman are proverbial, but the author ascribes the peculiar
readiness they have displayed at the present time largely
to compulsory military service, as well as to the French-
man's habit of discussing his work with his wife and
daughters and awakening their interest in it. Thus,
when the local paperhanger was called to the colours his
wife repapered the author's country cottage “quite as
efficiently"; and thrilling indeed is the account of the
gallantry of one intrepid woman who, when the German
Staff entered an important town (from which the Mayor
and Municipal Council had fled), resisted their demand for
a large war ransom. Widow of a former Senator of the
Department, she “alone remained, the sole representative
behaving with a total lack of what the Americans call
horse-sense. But if you can get by this difficulty you will
admire, as I did, the reticence with which the troubles of
the much misunderstood heroine are told, and also admit
that the colour of Java has been vividly conveyed.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“HoRSE MARINE.”—You say you are
intrigued about The Evening News
poster, which announced
“Asquitit on A MoRATORIUM,”
and you are curious to know more
about this animal. We have pleasure
in informing you that it is distantly re-
lated to the megatherium, and, since
the extinction of the latter, has been
very generally used for hack purposes.
The PREMIER may be seen any morning
in the Park taking a canter on one of
these superb mammals.
“WINSTONIAN.”—The rumour that
Colonel the late First Lord of the
Admiralty has offered himself the
command of a mine-sweeper or, alter-
natively, of a platoon in the 1/100
battalion of the Chilterns, lacks con-
firmation.
“PEER or THE REALM.”—We agree
with you in regretting that Lord FISHER
was unable to accept [ord BERESFORD's
invitation to come and hear him speak
in your House about the Downing
Street sandwichmen and other collateral
subjects arising out of the Air Service
debate. You will be glad however to
know that Lord Fish ER's absence was
not due to indisposition, but to a pre-
vious engagement to take tea on the
Terrace with Mr. BALFour R.
“A LovER of THE ANTIQUE.”—Your
idea of making a collection of ante-
bellum fetishes is a happy one. Ex-
amples of the Little Navy and Voluntary
System fetishes are now rather rare, but
you should have no difficulty in securing
a well-preserved specimen of the Free
Trade fetish at the old emporium of
antiquities kept by the firm of John
Simon and Co.
“A SINGLE MAN.”—When you say
that you are forty years old, that you
have practically built up a business
which will be ruined if you leave it,
that you are the sole support of a step-
mother and a family of young half-
brothers and sisters, but that you have
felt it your duty to attest without
appealing for exemption, we applaud
your patriotism. But, when you go on
to complain that your neighbour, aged
twenty-two, living in idleness on an
allowance, and married to a chorus-girl
still in her teens and childless, should
be free to decline service if he chooses
(as he does), we cannot but disapprove
of your irreverent and almost immoral
attitude towards the holy condition of
matrimony. If the tie of wedlock is
not to take precedence of Cvery other
tie, including that of country, where
are we ?
“A Clt Y
FROM MACEDONIA.” — In
answer to your question as to when we
think it likely that the KAISER will
take advantage of his recently-conferred
commission in the Bulgarian Army and
lead his regiment against Salonika, we
are unable to fix a date for this move-
ment. Our private information is that
he is detained elsewhere by a previous
engagement which is taking up more
time than was anticipated.
“BUL.GAR.” — We sympathise with
you in your natural desire to have
your TsAR FERDINAND home again,
and we share your sanguine belief that
the tonic air of Sofia (never more
bracing than at the present moment)
ought speedily to cure him of his malig-
nant catarrh. His Austrian physicians
however advise him to remain away,
and he himself holds the view, coloured
a little by superstition, that his return
should be at least postponed till after
the Ides of March, a day that was fatal
to the health of an earlier Caesar.
“You Ng TURK.” — Your anxiety
about ENVER PASHA is groundless. The
news that he has been recently seen at
the PROPHET's Tomb at Medina con-
veyed no indication that the object of
his visit was to select a neighbouring
site for his own burial. Indeed, our
information is that since his recent
assassination (as reported from Athens)
he has been going on quite as well as
could be expected. O. S.
BUILDING WITHOUT TEARS.
THE enthralling correspondence in
the columns of our contemporary, The
Spectator, on the subject of cheap cot-
tages and how to build them, has
evoked a vast amount of correspondence
addressed directly to us. We select a
few specimens which are recommended
by their practical and businesslike
character: —
THE MERITS OF “POSII.”
DEAR SIR,--The question of Land
Settlement after the War resolves itself
in the last resort into the employment
of cheaper methods of cottage building.
Will you allow me to put in a word for
the revival, in the neighbourhood of the
sea, of the old Suffolk plan of building
with what is locally known as “posh,”
aſter the name of the original inventor,
who was an ancestor of FITZGERALD's
friend. “Posh" is a mixture of old
boots—of which a practically unlimited
supply can be found on the beaches of
seaside resorts—and seaweed, boiled
into a jelly, allowed to solidify, and then
frozen hard in cold storage. “Posh"
is not only (1) impenetrable but also
(2) hygienic, the iodine in the seaweed
lending it a peculiarly antiseptic quality,
and (3) picturesque, the colour of the
compound being a dark purple, which
is exceedingly pleasing to the eye.
Lastly, the cost of production is slight,
as the raw material can be obtained for
nothing, and the compound can be
sawn into blocks or bricks to suit the
taste of the tenant. I am convinced
that cottages of “posh" could be built
for less than a hundred pounds a-piece;
and at that figure cheap housing be-
comes a practical proposition.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
DECIMUs DEXTER.
“STOOTING " AND “MARMASH.”
DEAR SIR,--The choice of material
matters little so long as it is properly
treated. Any sort of earth will do, or,
failing earth, a mixture of ashes with
a little mustard and marmalade, the
waste of which in most households is
prodigious. But it must be properly
pounded and allowed to set in a frame.
For the former process there is no better
implement than the old Gloucestershire
stoot, or stooting-mallet, or in the alter-
native a disused niblick. The earth,
or the “marmash " mixture, as I have
christened it, should be poured into a
bantle-frame—which can be made by
any village carpenter—and vigorously
pounded for about three hours. Then
another bantle-frame is placed on the
first, and the process is repeated. No
foundation is required for walls erected
by the plan of stooting, but a damp-
course of mulpin is advisable, and
it is always best to pingle the door-
jambs, and binge up the rafters with
a crumping-block.
I am, Sir, yours obediently,
MUNGO STALLIBRASS.
THE BEAUTY OF “BAP."
DEAR SIR,-When I was an under-
graduate at Balliol more years ago
than I care to remember, I not only
took part in the road-making experi-
ment carried out under RUSKIN's super-
vision, but assisted in the erection of a
model cottage, the walls of which were
made of “bap,” a compound which is
still used in parts of Worcestershire.
The receipt is very simple. You mix
clinkers, wanpum and spelf in equal
quantities and condense the com-
pound by hydraulic pressure. I have
a well-trained hydraulic ram who is
| capable of condensing enough “bap"
in twenty-four hours to provide the
materials for building six four-roomed
cottages. I am sorry to say that the
“bap" cottage at Hinksey was washed
away by a flood a few years ago, and
the spot where it stood is no longer
identifiable. But the facts are as I
have stated them.
Truly yours,
Roſ, AND PHIBSON.

and a covey of aeroplanes
bombing the local cabbageries.
This again is all right in its
way, but in the meantime the
mutual noise further up the
line has become so loud that
Someone very far back and
high up catches the echo of it,
and a bare hour later we re-
eive the order to stand-to at

minutes ago.
Within three minutes of our

military uses owing to absence of
ammunition), Russian Picture Tales,
and a tooth-brush. I find a general
opinion prevalent in the company that

Our position seemed a little problem-

was in a class by itself. We demanded
an investigatcr, somebody with wide
mine-sweeping experience preferred.
About 2 A.M. on our first day in,
a figure loomed up through a snow-
storm from the back of the central
trench and asked forlornly if there
might be any mines hereabouts. We
admitted there might be, or again there
might not. He questioned us pre-
cisely where it was suspected, and we
told him “underneath.” He scratched
his head and announced that he was
sent to look for it. His qualifications
consisted apparently in his having
coal-mined. But he seemed confident
of detecting the quicker combustion
sort, until he asked for necessary im-
a hole about 2,000 feet deep, and a
pulley, and a rope ladder and a brat-
ting-slat.
It's true we had some good holes
in parts of the trench, where you
probably go down 2,000 feet if you
step off the footboards, and the rest of
the stuff we might have contrived to
improvise. But for the moment we
had somehow run clean out of brat-
ting-slats.
| So we had to return the
poor fellow with a request
that all experts should be
completed with bratting-slats
before being sent to the front
line. This request only pro-
duced the senseless interrog-
ation, “What is a bratting-
slat?” to which we have not
yet bothered to reply. In the

along, looking to right and left
for some seat of authority

where some fortunate fellow
had ejected an ammunition

TO THE KING OF SPAIN.
YoUR MAJESTY,There is a little village
in England nestling among wooded
hills. It has sent forth its bravest and
best from cottage and farm and manor-
house to fight for truth and liberty and
justice. The news of grievous wounds
and still more grievous deaths, of men
missing and captured, comes often to
that quiet hamlet, and the roll of
honour in the little grey stone church
grows longer and longer. In the big
house on the hill, at sunrise and at
sunset, the young Lady of the Manor
stands at the bedside of her little son,
and hears him lisp his simple prayers
to God, and they always end like
this:—
“And God bless Father and Mother
and Nurse, and send Father back soon
from his how wid prison in Germany.
And God bless 'specially the dear King
of SPAIN, who found out about Father.
Amen.”
The kings of the earth have many
priceless possessions; they are able to
confer upon each other various glitter-
ing orders of merit and distinction;
but we doubt if any one of them has a
dearer possession or a more genuine
order of merit than this simple prayer
of faith and gratitude offered at sunrise
and at sunset on behalf of Your Majesty
by the bedside of a little English child.
THE OLD SOLDIER.
By A “TEMPORARY " SUB.
THERE are some men—and such is
Jones—
Who love to vent their antique spleens
On any subaltern that owns
He's not a soldier in his bones
(I'm not, by any means);
Who fiercely watch us drill our men
And tell us things were different when
(In, I imagine, 1810)
They joined the Blue Marines.
I like them mot, yet I affect
That air of awed humility
Which I should certainly expect,
If I were old and medal-deck'd,
From young men under me;
But when they hint their wondrous
wit
Is what has made them feel so fit
To do their military bit,
I simply can't agree.
I said to Jones—or should have said
But feared the Articles of War—
“You must not think you have a head
Because you know from A to Z
This military lore,
By years of study slowly gat
(And somewhat out-of-date at that),
When lo, I had the whole thing pat
In six small months—not more.”
Maybe the mystic art appals
Unlearned souls of low degrees,
But men to whom the high Muse
calls,
Men who are good enough for Smalls,
Imbibe it all with ease;
While where would Jones, I wonder,
be
If someone took the man for me
And asked him for some jeu d'esprit,
A few bright lines (like these)?
Possibly Jones will one day tire
Of fours and fights and iron shards,
Will seize his pencil and aspire
To court the Muse and match the fire
Of us poetic cards;
Then I shall mock his meagre strain
And gaily make the moral plain,
How barren is the soldier's brain
Compared with any bard's.

182 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARCH 15, 1916.
A QUESTION OF THE NUDE.
THEY scrambled into the carriage in
a tremendous hurry, all talking at
once at the tops of their voices, all very
excited and very dirty. They had mud
on their boots which had evidently
come from France, and their overcoats
had that rumpled appearance which
distinguishes overcoats from the Front
from those merely in training.
There seemed to be about ten of
them as they got into the train, but
when they had deposited various objects
on the rack, such as rifles, haversacks,
and kit-bags like partially deflated air-
ships, the number resolved itself into
three.
The compartment already contained
—besides myself—a naval warrant
officer, reading Freckles with a
sentimental expression, and a large
leading seaman with hands like small
hams and a peaceful smile like a jade
Buddha. It said “H.M.S. Hedgehog."
round his cap, but when I ventured to
remark that I once in peace-time saw
and visited that vessel he observed with
indifference that “cap - ribbons was
nothin' to go by these days; point o'
fact, he never see that there ship in
his puff.” Otherwise they maintained
that deep and significant silence which
we have learned to associate with our
Navy. -
The Tommies, however, were in very
talkative vein. “Now,” I thought, “I
shall doubtless hear some real soldiers'
stories of the War, even as the news-
paper men hear them and reproduce
them in the daily prints: the crash of
the artillery, the wild excitement of
battle—in short, the Real Thing. . . .”
A momentous question had evidently
been under discussion when they en-
tered the train, and as soon as they were
settled in their seats they resumed it.
“Wot I want to know is,” said the
largest of the three, a big man with a
very square face and blue eyes, “wot
I want to know is is that there feller
to go walkin' about naked ”’’ The
last word was pronounced as a mono-
syllable.
He set his fists squarely on his
knees and glared around him with a
challenging expression.
“No, it 's agin the law,” said a small
man with a very hoarse voice.
“Course it is," rejoined the other.
“Well, wot's the feller to do 2 That's
wot I ast you. If 'e walks about
naked, well, 'e gets took up for bein’
naked ; if 'e doesn't, why, 'e gets 'ad
for not returnin' is uniform."
He looked round again and decided
to take the rest of us into consultation.
“This 'ere 's 'ow it stands—see 2
'Ere.'s a feller got the mitten along o'
not bein’ able to march, through gettin'
shot in the leg. "E goes 'ome pendin'
'is discharge, an o' course 'e walks
about in is uniform. Then 'e gets 'is
discharge, an' they tells 'im to return
'is kar-kee an' small kit * -
“An' small kit 2 " burst out the third
member of the party indignantly—a
sprightly youth with a very short tunic
and a pert expression. “Do they want
you to return your small kit when you
get the mitten ? Watch me returnin'
mine, that 's all !”
“You’ll 'ave to,'
Discipline.
“'Ave to, I don't think ' " said the
rebel ironically; “I couldn't if I'd
lorst it.”
“I ain't got no small kit, any 'ow,”
said the small and husky one; “I put
my 'aversack down when we was
diggin' one of our chaps out of a Jack
Johnson 'ole, and some bloomin' blighter
pinched it ! Now that's a thing as I
don't 'old with. Rotten, I call it. I
wouldn't say nothing about it, mind
you, if I was dead; I like to 'ave some-
thing as belonged to a comrade, my-
self, an' I know as 'e'd feel the same,
seein' as 'e couldn't want it 'imself.
But, if you take a feller's things wen
'e's alive, why, you don't know 'ow
bad 'e might want 'em some day.”
“Corporal 'e ses to me, las' kit in-
spection,” broke in the fresh-faced
youth, disregarding this nice point of
ethics, “‘W'ere's your tooth-brush 2'
'e ses. ‘Where you won't find it,' I
ses. ‘’Oo're you talkin' to ?' 'e ses.
“Dunno,' I ses; ‘the ticket's fell
off' . . . Wot d'yer call yourself, any-
'ow,' I ses, ‘you an' yer stripe?' I ses.
‘Funny bundle,' I ses, ‘that's what I
call you!'”
“Well, I don't see wot a feller's got
to do,” said the propounder of the prob-
lem, returning to the charge. “Granted
as 'e can't walk about naked ; granted
as 'e 'asn't got a suit o' civvies of 'is
own—wot is 'e to do?”
“’Ang on to 'is kar-kee,” said the
hoarse-voiced man. The setter-down
of corporals retired within himself,
probably to compose some humorous
repartee.
The warrant officer came out of
Freckles and suggested writing a letter.
“’E 'as done. 'E's wrote an' told
'em as 'e can't send is kar-kee back
until 'e gets a suit o' Martin 'Enry's or
thirty bob in loo of same. An all as
they done was to write again an'
demand 'is uniform at once."
The warrant officer sighed and
opined that orders were orders.
“Yes, but 'e'd 'ave to carry 'em to
the Post Office naked, wouldn't 'e 2 An'
'ow about goin' to buy new ones?
That's if 'e'd drawed 'is pay, which 'e

said the voice of
'asn't.
calls it.”
“’Asn't 'e got no civvies at all 2"
said the small man, beginning to look
sceptical. “’Asn't 'e got no one as 'd
lend 'im a soot 2 Anyways, 'e could get
some one to post 'em for 'im, an' then
stop in bed till 'is others come.”
“'E's a very lonely feller,” said the
champion of the unclad ; “'e lives in
lodgin's, an 'e 'asn't got no friends. If
'e 'adn't got no clothes for to fetch is
pay in, wot then 2"
A gloomy silence, a silence fraught
with the inevitability of destiny, set-
tled on the party.
The warrant officer, who had been
pretending to resume Freckles, pre-
sently looked up and suggested that he
could go in his uniform to a tailor,
explain the position and obtain clothes
on credit.
The originator of the problem thought
hard for a minute.
“'E isn't a man as I'd care to trust
myself," he said rather unexpectedly,
“an' I don't think no one else would
neither.”
It was at this point that the man
from H.M.S. Hedgehog (or, to be pre-
cise, H.M.S. Something Else) fell into
the conversation suddenly, like a bomb.
“'E wouldn't be naked,” he said
earnestly: “'e'd 'ave 'is shirt.”
This was a staggerer. One of those
great simple truths sometimes over-
looked by more abstruse thinkers. But
the owner of the problem made one
more stand.
“'Oo 'd walk about in a shirt 2" he
said scornfully.
“Me," said the large seaman. “Last
time I was torpedoed . . .”
He didn't say another word; but the
problem was irretrievably lost. There
had been something magnificently
daring about the idea of a man walking
about like a lost cherub: partly clothed,
nobody cared very much what became
of him.
Besides, we all wanted to hear Ad-
miralty secrets. We sat there in
respectful silence while the train
rattled on its way; but the large sea-
man only went on smiling peacefully
to himself, as if he were ruminating in
immense satisfaction upon unprece-
dented bags of submarines.
Unreasonable, that 's wot I

Which makes things simpler. Now we can get on.

Or “od the left” (or right) to “forb platood.”

there was fun brewing. Mr.
BALFou R was to introduce
the Naval Estimates, and his
dear friend and ex-colleague,
Colonel WINSTON CHURCHILL,
was announced to follow him.
The conjunction of these
highly-electrified bodies is
always apt to produce sparks.
The House was well filled,
and over the clock could be n
seen Lord FISHER, like “a
sweet little cherub that sits up
aloft to keep watch for the
life of poor Jacky.” The
last time Mr. CHURCHILL
spoke of Naval affairs in the
House he was not quite nice
to Lord Fish ER. Would he
be nicer this time?
I think Mr. BALFour must
be something of a thought-
reader. Intermingled with
his narration of the varied
and wonderful achievements
of the Fleet, past and present,
his description of the con-
stant efforts to increase it

It must have been a little embarrass-

hear his praises thus chanted. But it
is difficult to escape from the seat over
the Clock without treading upon other
people's toes, and this Lord FISHER
is notoriously averse from
doing. The moment, how-
ever, that Colonel CHURCHILL
had finished he left the

wholly emerge he had to
suffer the further shock of
being cheered by some over-
enthusiastic admirers behind
him. It was a pity he left

Fisher was totally inconsistent with
the ground, and that the only effective
that which he had expressed a few way of opposing them was to meet
months ago: possibly they were both
remote from the truth. But it was an
amazing proposition that the Govern-
ment should be asked to dismiss Sir
HENRY JACKsoN, an officer who was
everything that Lord Fisher according
to Colonel CHURCHILI, was not. He
himself would not yield an inch to such
a demand.
Spontaneous debate has never been
the Colonel's strong point. His ora-
torical engines are driven by mid-
night oil. Wisely, therefore, he did
not attempt an elaborate réplique to
Mr. BALFour's “sword-play,” but con-
tented himself with a brief restatement
of his case.
Thursday, March 9th. – Prophets
swarm in both Houses of Parliament,
but the House of Lords is unique in
possessing one who confines himself to
subjects which he has at his fingers'
ends and whose prophecies have a habit
of coming true. What Lord MonTAGU
of BEAULIEU does not know of the
petrol engine, and its use on land or
sea or in the air, is not worth knowing.
Seven years ago he warned his country-
men of the bomb-dropping possibilities
of the new German air-ships. A little
later he pointed out that it was very
doubtful if dirigible balloons could be
successfully attacked by gunfire from
like with like. Again in 1913 he dwelt
upon the inadequacy of our aerial
defences.
His object to-day was not to extol
his own merits as a prophet, but to
get the Government to act on the motto
“One Element One Service ’’ and
establish a single Ministry of the Air.
Lord HALDANE thought we ought to do
some “violent thinking" before adopt-
ing the proposal, but quite agreed (with
a reminiscent glance at the Woolsack)
that we had not made sufficient use of
lighter-than-air machines. That was
Lord BERESFORD's view, too; we must
oppose Zeps to Zeps. Then, having
evidently done some violent think-
ing over the recent debate in the
Commons he launched out into a
wholly irrelevant attack upon Colonel
CHURCHILL for trying to create anxiety
about the Fleet, and appealed to Lord
FishBR (who was not present though
Lord BERESFORD had particularly in-
vited him) to repudiate the agitation con-
ducted by the honourable Member for
DUNDEE, a few newspapers and twenty
sandwichmen. Lord LANSDown E sub-
sequently noted that this most irregular
digression appeared to be “not wholly
distasteful" to the peers assembled.
Turning to Lord MonTAGU's proposal
he pointed out that the Government
had gone some way to meet it by
setting up Lord DERBY's Committee,
But, though prepared to see the Cabinet
increased to a round couple of dozen,
he was not convinced that the only way
to remove imperfections was to appoint
a new Minister to deal with them.
It seems probable therefore that
there is no truth in the report that
Colonel CHURCHILL has been asked to
join the Government as Minister of
Admonitions.
Painful Accident to a Clergyman.

out one of his calves was attacked and stung

Sir Thomas MACKENziE, as reported
by The East Anglian Daily Times : —
“I now think it is time you intermingled
with your affairs a little of the wisdom of the

you have showed to the Germans in the past.”
There is a strong feeling among our
N.C.O.'s that this is sound advice.

in the negative, as, owing to the activity

in the home-grown supplies.

THE RECONCILIATION.
[It is thought that the following story
may have been intended for the “Organ
of Organs” (R.A.M.C.)].
Charles, the young Army Medical,
went down on one patella. His heart
(a hollow muscular pump) was driving
blood from its ventricles as it had
never yet driven it in all its twenty-five
years of incessant labour. Further, by
flattening the arch of his diaphragm
and elevating his ribs and sternum,
Charles was increasing the cavity of
his thorax and taking in air. Immedi-
ately the diaphragm and the sternum
and costal cartilages relaxed again the
air escaped. The lungs of Charles
were doing their work. Fast and yet
faster became his breathing.
“Mabel,” he murmured, “Mabel !”
The girl made no movement. Her
respiration continued, but no impulse
to action reached her nerve-centres.
Yet, without an effort on her part, her
tissues in one minute produced enough
heat to boil one twenty-fourth of a pint
of water.
“Wonderful!” he whispered hoarsely,
probably thinking of this, “you are
wonderful.”
You will not marvel that his voice
was gruff when I tell you that the
membrane of the larynx was inflamed.
Greater men than Charles have become
hoarse in such circumstances.
Immediately the blood rushed to the
capillaries of Mabel's cheeks and her
colour deepened. She trembled slightly.
“There, that's it!” he cried, gazing
rapturously.
“What?” she gasped, startled by
his passion.
“Again that artery below your ear
is throbbing, throbbing, and "– his
voice rose in despair—“I can never
remember the namel Can you?”
“Alas,” she moaned, “I do not
know it ! Oh, Charles, there is some-
thing I must tell you at once.”
“What is it 2" he cried with sudden
fear. “What is it 2 ”
“Why, I–I Oh, I do not know
how to say it. Charles, you will never
forgive me!”
“What is it, dearest ? Tell me—
you can trust me. The medical pro-
fession --
“Well, then, I tried to bandage
little Johnny's foot yesterday, and—
and --
“Calm yourself, dear. And—?”
“I tied a 'granny'knot. Oh, Charles,
don't be angry. I know it ought to
have been a ‘reef ' ' "
He looked about him dully, like
a man stunned.
“Charles,” she moaned, “listen
After all, I put it on the wrong
foot.”
He started violently.
“Mabel,” he cried, “you are sure?
Then I will not let you go. Had you
tied that “granny' knot on the right
foot, I–we—as an R.A.M.C. man,
I—”
Householder (with the Zeppelin obsession).
“AH, I LIKE THE S.Now. IT REDUCES THE
MENACE FROM ABOVE.”
She clung to him sobbingly.
“Charles, oh Charles,” she panted,
“you have proved it to me. You love
me! (Is my heart throbbing now?)
You love me and it will break for
joy!”
The phalanges and the metacarpal
bones of her left hand clicked together
as if in sympathy as she flung it to her
side.
Again her cerebrum flashed its joyful
message, so that she repeated, “My
heart " ''
At the word Charles, the R.A.M.C.
man, rose from his patella and placed
his hands firmly on his femur bones.
His whole bearing had changed.
“This,” he said slowly and ring-
ingly, “is the end. When I entered
this room I loved you—I admit it.
But—you have deceived me! Look at
that hand It is covering—what? The
floating costae' Your heart is not
where you would have me believe.
It is fully three inches higher and
more to the right. That is not a small
matter, or one with which you should
trifle as you do. But you have deceived
me in a greater than that.”
“Oh, what is it 2 What have I
done?” sobbed Mabel hysterically.
“The greater matter,” continued
Charles in trumpet tones, “is that the
heart is not the seat of the emotions at
all. I can only conclude that your
agitation was feigned. I wish you
good-day, Madam.”
He had reached the door when she
cried aloud.
“Charles' "
An urgent message from Charles's
cerebellum, delivered to certain motor
nerves by way of the spinal cord, dis-
posed him to turn on his heel.
He waited in silence.
“Charles dearest, if it was the wrong
place, and I didn't cover my heart after
all, why, Charles, remember Johnny's
foot and be logical!”
She was there before him, glorious,
and Charles stood dazzled.
“You are right!” he cried. “Mabel !
If you had covered your heart!!”
“Charles ' ' ' "

To foster a laxer array,

A SOLDIER POLITICIAN.
A BIOGRAPHICAI, NoTE.
CoNSIDERABLE promise was shown
in the speech delivered before the House
of Commons last week by Colonel
CHURCHILL. His utterance had the
effect of instantly lifting that gallant
gentleman from the obscurity of life
“somewhere in France” to something
approaching notoriety. Surely few
soldiers have discovered such a gift of
dialectical skill; and the Army must
feel proud to learn that it possesses
an officer who shows himself to be as
able in the realm of politics as in the
profession of arms.
Colonel CHURCHILL's sensational tour
de force has aroused a natural interest
in his personality. He is still a
young man, being only just on the
wrong side of forty. In choosing a
military career he responded to here-
ditary impulse, for he is a direct de-
scendant of that great military genius,
the Duke of MARLBoRough. He en-
tered the army in 1895, when little
more than a boy. After seeing service
in Cuba and India he fought in the
Egyptian Campaign of 1898, and in a
journalistic capacity took part in the
South African War, the news of his
capture being received in this country
with much feeling. To his skill as a
soldier Colonel CHURCHILL adds no
small ability as a writer, and has
published more than one book that has
attracted favourable notice.
Following upon his remarkable
speech of the other night, there has
been some discussion as to whether
Colonel CHURCHILL will definitely take
up a political career, or return to the
trenches. We have it on good autho-
rity that an old friend, Sir HEdworth
MEUx, strongly advises him not to
sacrifice his military prospects. On the
other hand, his colleagues at the Front
feel that in the national interest they
are prepared to do their best without
him, in view of the benefit likely to
accrue from his remaining at home.
In any case it is confidently asserted
by those who know him that Colonel
CHURCHILL has gone far towards
making a name for himself, and that he
is likely to go further still if the oppor-
tunity is given to him. His future is
certain to be watched with interest.

the long unsparing struggle takes somehow the dignity of

his volcanic temperament. If Miss DELL, who seems to
have a penchant for tempestuous heroes, would devote
Some of her superfluous energy to a study of men, so as
to get to understand them as well as she understands her
own sex, it would be a good thing for the quality both of
her work and of her public.
In her latest little volume of verse, modestly entitled
Simple Rhymes for Stirring Times (PEARson), Miss JEssIE
Pope shows that she has not only the right spirit, but a
sense of form beyond the common. She does not pretend
to heroics and she seldom allows herself to touch a note of
pathos; her mission is just to inspire other hearts with
the infectious gay courage of her own. It finds a natural
expression in the easy lilt of her measures. She is fluent
rather than polished and never overlays her designs with
- - - - - -- - - - - - excess of embroidery.
| Long practice has made
her familiar with a craft
which is not so easy as
it looks; and in parti-
cular she has learnt the
art of the final line. Miss
PoPE may possibly run
the risk of over-writing
herself; but so long as
she brings a discriminat:
|ing eye to the choice of
what is worth preserv-
ing—and she has been
quite reasonably self-
critical in her present
selection — the matter
that she jettisons is no
affair of mine. Judging
only by what I see here,
I recognise that, in what-
ever other way she may
|
__ be helping the cause,
through her gift of light-heart verse she is doing—and none
more bravely—her share of woman's work.

THE KAISER ON KILIMANJARO.
ſCorrespondence in The Times has recalled the fact that Kilimanjaro,
from whose neighbourhood the enemy has just been expelled, was in-
cluded in German East Africa at the special desire of the KAIs EIR (then
PRINCE WILLIAM of Pitt'ssi A). It appears that he took a peculiar
interest in the fauna and flora of that district. Incidentally, the
higheſt peak of Kilimanjaro (19,000 feet) is named Kaiser Wilhelm
Spitze. The author of these lines does not claim a close acquaintance
with the natural history and botany of this region, and cannot there-
fore vouch for the accuracy of his details.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXXVI.
(From Herr Iſol, FG4NG OFFENAſ. CL, an actor).
Most GRAcious MAJESTY, How strangely and uncom-
fortably the Fates sport with us! It is but two years ago,
I remember, that it came into my head to look forward to
the far-off day when I should shake off the stage and all
its agitations, its triumphs, its disappointments and even
its jealousies and its quarrels, and should be able to live
ny own life in the pleasant and happy world cf reality.
But I put the thought by, for much still remained to me
to be endured and achieved in my profession, and I thought
that some day, if matters turned cut favourably, I might
have the supreme glory of impersonating Hamlet or Macbeth
under the very eye of your Imperial Majesty and of noting
that you were not displeased with the performance of ore
of the most devoted of your subjects. This hope, springing
up in my breast, gave me new strength and a fresh joy in
the often dull round of my daily task, for in matters of the
stage your Majesty, being, as we often say among ourselves,
the greatest actor of us all and having from the earliest
years in.bibed the love cf the footlights and the limelight,
is an incomparable judge of the true histrionic art, and a
word of praise from you is worth columns and columns in
the newspapers. It is to us as when a cobbler's boots are
praised by a rival cobbler.
And there is another point which then kept me fron:
giving way any further to my dreams of leirement from
the theatre. Real life, so calm for the most part and so
regular, is but a dull thing to those who live a fictitious life
on the boards, in the midst of excitements and honour and
crimes, with murder and sudden death a waiting them, as it
were, round the corner. After Hamlet has seen his mother's
death, has killed Laertes and the Kinſ and has himself
6xpired, what is it to him to come to life again and to sit
down without his royal trappings to a supper of sausage
and potatoes, while his wife sits by and darns his stockings
and the baby begins to cry in its cot? So thought I, and
resolved to continue my career of acting, though I acknow-
ledged that some day, perhaps, in the very distant future,
retirement might have its attractions.
All this was before the War broke out. When that
happened I, like the rest, was seized and thrust into a
uniform and made to remember my drill and was presented
with a rifle and a bayonet. Finally, with my regiment I
was marched off to the Front in France, where I still
linger in daily expectation of death. Dreadful things have
I seen, men blown into nothingness by shells, men pierced
through and through by the steel, women murdered and
worse than murdered, and children crushel under fallen
walls—sights I cannot bear to think of, though they force
themselves upon me and murder sleep. I was, perhaps,
unduly contemptuous of real life, but now I abhor it and try
in vain to put it away from me. I desire with a ſull-hearted
longing to return to that life of imagination where the
most dreadful bloodshed ends at about eleven o'clock every
evening, without leaving any impression on those who take
part. Yes, give me again the life of the theatre and remove
far away this brutal scenery of trenches and shells and
bombs and quick-firers and men summoned from peace
and ease to cut one another's throats because a histrion
KAIs ºn has so willed it and none of his subjects dared to
say him nay. To get away from this and never to return
to it I would willingly consent to play the First Murderer in
Macbeth for the remainder of my life. It would be an
innocent and an honourable occupation compared with
what I am forced day by day and night by night to endure.
Yours, in respectful despair, Wolfo ANG OFFENMAUL.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. JOHN'S PORTRAIT OF MR. GEORGE.
THE generally favourable opinion of
Mr. Augustus John's striking portrait
of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE is not shared by
everybody. The following criticism of
the picture has reached us, and as it
represents a point of view which, so far
as we know, has not found sympathy
in the Press opinions which have
already appeared, we print it for the
edification of the artist, the sitter and
any others who may have a few mo-
ments to devote to the subject.
I should like to say (writes our cor-
respondent) on behalf of myself and of
many worthy members of my congre-
gation that Mr. AUGUSTUs JoHN has
missed a great opportunity in painting
his portrait of our greatest Welshman.
In the first place, surely it lacks
dignity. In it Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
who is pre-eminently a man capable
of looking you straight in the eye,
is depicted as looking someone else
obliquely in the eye. I would that his
strong features had been accompanied
by a direct and thoughtful gaze, instead
of that petulant side-glance, which to
all of us who know the smiling candour
of the MINISTER of MUNITIONs is so
foreign an expression.
I cannot speak with authority about
the sitter's raiment. At the same time
I must register my dislike of these
clothes, which appear to have the mud
of the golf-links still fresh upon them.
Surely the artist should have persuaded
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE to wear his black
coat and vest for the occasion.
Hanging from a cord is something in
the nature of an aid to vision. I can-
not determine whether it is a pince-
nez or a monocle. The uncertainty is
irritating. Is it possible that the
MINISTER has taken to wearing a single
eye-glass? If so, why has not the artist
put it in the sitter's eye 2 And as to
the hair—Heaven forbid that I should
cast any reflection upon any man of
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's age possessing
abundant locks; on the contrary, I con-
gratulate him; but in all my experi-
ence I have never yet known a portrait
to be taken without the sitter being
requested first of all to brush his
hair. Why has Mr. AUGUSTU's John
flown in the face of all precedent by
neglecting this simple yet desirable
precaution ?
I feel very strongly that nothing in
the portrait indicates the sitter's nation.

[MARCH 22, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW PATRIOTISM.
LPoch-MARING AssBMBLY.
A PUBLIC meeting, summoned under
the auspices of the Candid Friends of
England, has just been held at the Hall
of the Grousers' Company, in Little
Britain. The chair was taken by Mr.
OUTH waiti.
The Chairman, opening the meeting,
said that the inception of the League
was due to a number of public-spirited
men who had come to the conclusion,
very unwillingly, that the country was
still insufficiently instructed as to the
inherent and abysmal incapacity of
every member of the Government.
(Cheers.) It was true that certain
sections of the Press did what they
could to point this out, and there was
also the noble, patriotic and self-sacri-
ficing work carried on in the House at
Question-time. (Loud cheers.) But
he was sorry to say that there still
remained a considerable and, alas !
not wholly negligible number of per-
sons in the country who hugged the
quaint superstition that a Cabinet
Minister could be earnest, capable
and diligent. It was these benighted
folk whom they desired to reach and
convert. Not till every Englishman
had been convinced that England was
rotten could he (the speaker) and his
friends rest content. (Frantic applause.)
They were met to-day to listen to the
views of various eminent gentlemen as
to how best to spread this gospel.
Sir ARTHUR MARKHAM, who was
received with cheers, said that no cm2
who had followed his recent speeches
could be in any doubt as to the tur-
pitude and sloth of the men whom
a mischievous caprice had set at the
head of this country's affairs. He for
one should never cease to clamour for
their dismissal. He begged to move a
resolution that in the opinion of that
important and representative meeting
a complete change of Government was
instantly necessary. (A Voice: “Not
only now, but always.") No doubt
there was something in what that
gentleman said, but for the present per-
haps “always” had better be omitted.
The essence of the truest patriotism was
distrust of one's rulers and dissatisfac-
tion with one's country. (Hear! Hear!).
Mr. AUSTIN HARRIsoN, in seconding,
said that the finest heritage of an
Englishman was freedom of speech, and
the more that freedom became licence
the finer the Englishman. (Cheers.) By
freedom of speech he meant the right to
say instantly whatever came into one's
head, particularly if it appeared to be-
little one's own country. Because one
could not belittle England really. Eng-
land was too great for that. But it
was salutary to try. It was also valu-
able to our Allies, because it tended to
prove to them how much in earnest
and how united we must be.
A great sensation was now caused
by the appearance of “An Englishman"
from Carmelite Street. This gentle-
man, who, like the man who dined with
the KAISER, desiring his anonymity to
be respected, wore a John Bull mask
and brandished an ebony cane, made
the PRIME MINISTER the special mark
of his attack. What, he asked, could
be expected of a politician so crafty
and lost to shame as to bid the House
wait and see? Was it not the very
essence of good statesmanship to blurt
out everything at once? Only a craven
time-server would say wait and see.
Waiting was a contemptuous proceeding
wherever practised, and seeing required
eyes, which Heaven knows the PREMIER
woefully lacked. (Cheers.) What right
had an incorrigible hoodwinker such as
Mr. AsquitH to advise anyone to see?
It was monstrous. Let the people get
rid of this impostor without a twinge of
compunction, and the sooner the better.
As to swapping horses in mid-stream
being unwise, perhaps it was, but it
was not unwise in the way that waiting
to see was. (Applause.)
Another masked gentleman, who
was understood to be “Callisthenes"
of Oxford Street, now rose to make
a few useful suggestions. He said
that as the only journalist who wrote
what was practically the leading article
in four evening papers overy day, he
surely was entitled to speak with some
authority. The question was how to
get it into the country's head that
England's only chance for recovering
her self-respect and winning the War
was to cry stinking fish 2 (Loud
cheers.) Well, the best way was to
keep on saying it in and out of season,
His experience had taught him that
everything will bear saying not merely
tº times, but three thousand times
and three.
Mr. AMERY said it was ridiculous to
suppose that any Cabinet Minister
wished the War to end or England to
be victorious. The contrary was an
axiom on which the whole future of
his political creed was based. One had
but to look at them to see how flabby
and vacillating threy were and how
devoted to the pickings of office.
Mr. Hog GE said that the Chairman
in his opening remarks had disregarded
one of the most valuable media for
spreading the blessed news that Eng-
land was at her last gasp, throttled by
place-hunters and parasites. That was
the variety stage. It was wonderful
what a good comic song could do. He
had heard one only the night before, in
which its singer had been vociferously
applauded at the end of a verse which
stated that there were now no German
spies in England because they had all
been naturalised and given War Office
clerkships. That was the kind of
home truth which the public appre-
ciated and even paid their money to
hear. There could not be too many
songs of that kind.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw said that an-
other way was to induce publishers to
issue new and amended editions of those
popular writers who had been betrayed
by impulsiveness or short-sight into
eulogies of England. He remembered
several such unfortunate outbursts in
the works of the national poet. There
was, for example, that ill-balanced
utterance of the dying John of GAUNT
in praise of our little isle; but of course
one could not expect the intellect to
be at its best just before dissolution.
Still, they would all agree that SHAK-
sPEARE would be the wholesomer with-
out that passage. (Cheers.)
The Chairman then put the resolu-
tion to the meeting and it was carried
unanimously. In bidding the gathering
farewell the Chairman impressed upon
them that their rule of life should be a
onstant and voluble mistrust of our
leaders. It should be a point of honour
with them to deny that the FIRST LORD
of THE ADMIRALTY could possibly know
anything about the Navy, or wish it to
succeed ; that the CHANCELLOR OF THE
Exchequeſt could possibly know any-

DRESS “AS USUAL.”
(A Protest from Mr. Punch.)
[The National Organising Committee for
War Savings has issued an appeal against
extravagance in women's dress.]
CERTAIN ladies—just a section
Of our spindle side—
Swerving in a wrong direction,
Dress have deified;
And, as incomes grow more slender,
Bring discredit on their gender
By refusing to surrender
Fashion for their guide.
Most of England's wives and daughters
Play a noble part,
In the very deepest waters
Never losing heart;
Danger and privation braving,
Nursing, helping, toiling, slaving,
Thinking vastly more of saving
Than of looking smart.
Highly-paid officials slate us,
Dwelling on the ills
Which infallibly await us
In our empty tills;
But these frenzied fair ones, furious
In the quest of the luxurious,
Still pursue a most injurious
Cult of frocks and frills.
True, our Ministerial teachers
Fail us in the fight,
For the practice of the preachers
Sins against the light;
Still “Two Wrongs”—for so the sages
Crystallize the lore of ages
Gathered at successive stages—
“Do not make a Right.”
Birds of Paradise are grateful
Under skies serene;
But the human type is hateful
On a tragic scene;
When the outlook's drear and cloudy
Punch would rather see you dowdy
Than extravagant and rowdy
In your dress and mien.
True simplicity is tasteful;
Think before you spend;
Woeful want attends the wasteful
In the bitter end;
You who, when the world is mourning,
All remonstrance lightly scorning,
Only think of self-adorning,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, March 14th.-Ministers as
they passed through Palace Yard on
their way to the House shuddered as
they observed a long, black, wicked-
looking motor-car, shaped like a tor-
pedo. In this machine Mr. PEMBERTON-
BILLING, the new Air - Member for
East Herts, had done most of his elec-
tioneering. Now he had arrived, to
take his seat and, rumour said, to make
his maiden speech. Would the Front
Bench survive it 2
If the new Member could have
jumped straight from the steering-wheel
into the Chamber, and
with his eloquence still at
white-heat have got his
fulminating message off
his chest, strange things
might have happened.
But fortunately or un-
fortunately the procedure
of the House discourages
these dramatic effects.
For nearly an hour he
had to wait and listen to
Ministerial replies to ques-
tions which he must have
found painfully trivial.
Even when the weary
catechism was at last over
there was a further delay.
With great lack of con-
sideration for the dignity
of East Herts the PRIME
MINISTER had been so
careless as to catch a bad
cold, and was not in his
place. On his behalf,
therefore, Sir EDw A R D
GREY made a statement
regarding the entry of
Portugal into the War.
The gist of it was that
the most ancient of our
Allies has acquired a good- AIR, BALFoun.
sized Fleet at no expense to herself,
and that Germany is confronted by a
new enemy in Africa.
At last the new Member was called
upon to take his seat. Belonging to no
party he could not, of course, enjoy the
usual official escort to the Table. But,
like another young man in a hurry
who in somewhat similar circumstances
preferred scorpions to whips, Mr. PEM-
BERTON-BILLING seemed quite satisfied
with the ministrations of Mr. RoNALD
McNEILL and Sir HENRY DALzi E.L.
Dispensing with the usual period of
rest and refreshment, he assumed his
seat immediately after shaking hands
with the SPEAKER. Who knew but
that Mr. LowthER, recognising the
anxiety of Members to hear the latest
War news from East Herts, might call
him at once 2
Routine, however, was too much for
romance. For an hour or more Mr.
TENNANT rambled over the wide field
provided for him, but without stumbling
upon anything very fresh or startling,
unless indeed it was the discovery that
“Intelligence is a very delicate matter.”
This occurred in the course of a
protracted description of what was
being done to protect the country
against air raids. The organisation of
the anti-aircraft defences was now
complete for London and was approach-
ing completion for the country. But—
Mr. TENNANT hastened to add for Mr.
BILLING's benefit—the standard would

be still further raised when more
material was available.
When he was in the Government
Mr. HobHouse was not less economical
of information in his official utterances
than any of his Ministerial colleagues.
Now that he is out of it he is all for
full disclosure. Why had Mr. TENNANT
said nothing of Gallipoli or Salonika,
Loos and Neuve Chapelle? Why, if
we were allowed to know that three
million goatskins had been provided for
the Army, might we not know how
many men were going to wear them 2
In his view the result of the East Herts
election was due to the Government
having kept Parliament in the dark.
At last the stage was clear for Mr.
PEMBERTON-BILLING, who, considering
how long he had been kept waiting,
made a creditable début. He had, it is
true, no startling revelations to make,
or, at any rate, did not make them. His
principal point was that we must ex-
terminate the Zeppelins, and that we
had aeroplanesenough and pilots enough
to do it now. He would be delighted to
introduce Mr. TENNANT to the men and
was prepared to lay them on the Table
of the House. For a first performance
it was quite good, even if not entirely
equal to the advance-billing.
Wednesday, March 15.-I am rather
surprised that none of the evening
papers had the enterprise to come out
to-night with a contents bill bearing
the words—
“GREAT ATTACK on
I’ortsMoUTH,”
for the legend would have
been not only startling but
unusually accurate. The
House of Lords assembled
this afternoon in the ex-
pectation of hearing im-
portant statements from
the Earl of DERBY and
Farl KITCHENER on the
recruiting crisis. What
it was at first compelled
to listen to was the Earl
of PortsMoUTH giving his
views on the Anglo-Danish
Agreement. With dog-
matic ponderosity he de-
clared that the Agreement
was losing us the friend-
ship of the other Scandi-
navian countries, that it
was not preventing goods
getting into Germany, and
that it ought to be abro-
gated forthwith.
I doubt if any of the
Peers present had ever
TENNANT AND heard anything like the
castigation which the
Marquis of LANsdown E administered.
Where did the noble Earl collect the
kind of information that he had seen fit
to pour forth 2 He seemed to have
swallowed a lot of stories purveyed
by people who were no friends to
this country. There was not a word
of truth in the suggestions he had
made, and the Government, far from
abrogating the Agreement, intended to
maintain and develop the policy on
which it was based. It was a great
pity that the noble earl should have
identified himself with an agitation
that was neither wise nor patriotic.
Lord PortsMoUTH's family name is

to it.

perhaps the most prominent man in the
country next to the PRIME MINIstER.

Officer (handing despatches). “Now, MIND. IF You 'RE CAPTURED witH THIs You MUsT EAT IT."
Yet he is not a member of the Govern-
ment. When to-day he rose from the
Opposition benches to defend his con-
duct as Director-General, of Recruiting
and inspirer of the PRIME MINISTER's
famous pledge to married men, he il-
lustrated the anomaly by the remark
that, while he was doing his best to get
that pledge fulfilled, Lord SELBoRNE,
who was a member of the Govern-
ment, had been telling the farmers that
he (Lord DERBY) did not speak with
authority.
Later he did a second turn—this
time in his capacity as Chairman of
the Joint Air Committee. Quite the
most satisfactory part of his reply was
the announcement that Lord MoN-
TAGU himself had consented to become
a member of the Committee. It is, of
course, contrary to all the traditions of
the British Government to give a man
a job which he understands already.
But in war-time even the most sen-
sational experiments must not be
ruled out.
Thursday, March 16th-The House
of Commons is so constructed that no
matter how often the party-system is
expelled it will always return. In spite
of the Coalition, or perhaps because of
it, the old strife of Whigs and Tories
has revived, though the lines of cleav-
age are quite different from what they
Were.
The new Tories are the men who have done more to raise the tone of
believe that the War is going to be
North Sea, and would sacrifice every-
thing for victory, even the privilege of
abusing the Government. The new
Whigs are the men who consider that
the House of Commons is the decisive
arena, and that even the defeat of the
Germans would be dearly purchased at
the cost of the individual's right to say
and do what he pleased.
Naturally these latter object to the
shortening of the Parliamentary week,
and to-day they took a division on the
subject. Into the “No” Lobby flocked
a motley crew—the champions of the
single men who don't want to fight at
all, the upholders of the married men
who protest against being called upon
to fulfil their engagement until every
single “embusqué" has been dragged
out of his lair, and, paradoxically
enough, the universal conscriptionists
who would force everyone to serve, but
are opposed to piecemeal compulsion.
The Government carried their point
easily enough by 128 votes to 67, but
evidently have to reckon with a new
concentration of forces which may be
more dangerous in the future.
When the House of Commons passed
the Bill prohibiting duelling it ought
to have made an exception in favour
of its own members. Nothing would
debate, for offenders against decorum
decided by battles in Flanders and the
would gradually have eliminated one
another. This afternoon, for example,
Sir HAMAR GREEN wood twitted Mr.
Hogg E with sheltering himself under
the patriotism of a soldier stepson, and
Mr. Hogg E. retaliated with the sug-
gestion that Sir HAMAR ought to be
with his regiment. A hundred years
ago this would have meant a meeting in
Hyde Park and a possible vacancy at
Sunderland or East Edinburgh. To-day
it merely brought a rebuke from the
CHAIRMAN of CoMMITTEEs.
Again, in the days of our rude fore-
fathers Sir John SIMON would have felt
constrained to send a challenge to Mr.
WALTER LONG. The late Hoxie SECRE-
TARY had delivered an attack upon the
Government which Mr. LoNG declared
would be heartily welcomed in Berlin.
For a much less serious accusation than
that the Duke of WELLINGTON called
out Lord WINCHILSEA. Sir Johs SIMoS
has no such resource, and must con-
tinue to suffer under the imputation—a
little consoled, no doubt, by the com-
panionship of Mr. Hogg E.

AT THE PLAY.
“KULTUR AT HOME.”
EACH of the authors—Mr. RUDolf
BESIER and Mrs. John SpottiswooDE
—has personal knowledge of the home-
life of the Bosch; and their excellent
sketch of Prussian manners might have
served usefully as a warning to us if we
could have seen it a few years ago.
But at this time of day, after nineteen
months' experience of the enemy, I
doubt its utility as a source of illumin-
ation.
It would be futile to represent the
Prussian officer as an angel in the
house, for we have long since learned to
know him as a devil in the field. And
it is almost as futile to picture his pro-
digious self-conceit, his vile taste in
dress and furniture, his conjugal infi-
delity, his habit of treating his women-
folk as menials, since these vices are
human and venial in comparison with,
| what the War has revealed. Anyone
might easily hazard the conjecture that
the murderers of Belgium had never
entertained too fastidious a respect
for womanhood; and after the destruc-
tion of Louvain and Ypres it is mere
bathos to insist that the perpetrators
of these outrages against art had pre-
viously cherished a Philistine affection
for antimaeassars and plush sofas.
A common difficulty with me when
I witness stage tragedies arising out of
a marriage of uncongenial types is to
understand how the couple ever came
together. And so here, when the
English girl, Margaret Tinworth, in
face of poverty and parental disap-
proval, marries a Prussian officer in
a small garrison town, and then finds
all sorts of unbearable conditions in her
surroundings, one asks oneself, and
fails to discover, what kind of glamour
he had cast over her that most of these
conditions, already patent enough in
the society in which she had moved,
had contrived either to escape her
notice or to appear tolerable. True,
she had gone to Germany to find
release from the solitude of a mother-
less home, where an ur sympathetic
father had no attention to spare from
his art treasures; but, with so admirable
an aunt as Lady Lushington to chaperon
her in her own country, it was not easy
to see why she must needs resort to
exotic consolation.
However, I do not propose to set my
judgment up against that of the
authors, male and female, in regard to
the credibility of her taste in men,
since, after all, the heart of a woman
is a thing past finding out. But I do
venture to dispute the reasonableness
of her ultimate attitude in conditions
where this enigmatic organ was not
directly concerned. For you are to
understand that in the Third Act the
brutality of her husband and the in-
sults hurled at England, which she
was expected, as a Prussianised wife,
to approve, had become more than she
could bear; and in the last Act we find
her in a Luxembourg hotel on her way
home to England under the care of
Lord and Lady Lushington. It is the
4th of August, 1914; Germany has
declared war; German regiments are
marching through the town; England
has not yet spoken. The girl is in
grievous doubt as to whether she ought

not, in the changed circumstances, to
return to her Prussian home. One
could easily appreciate her attitude if
she had argued, “I am German by
marriage; though I have lost my love
for my husband it is my duty, when he
is risking his life for his country, the
country of my adoption, to go back
and watch over his home for him.”
But that was not her argument; her
argument was that England — the
England that she had so stoutly de-
fended against German ridicule and
contempt—had been false to her honour
as the sworn friend of France, and that
it was her business to go back to
Germany and eat humble pie. What-
ever the audience may have felt about
these reflections on the conduct of
England, they must at least have been
irritated by the fantastic improbability
of the girl's motive. Very fortunately
at this juncture the voice of the paper-
boy is heard in the street conveying
the thrilling news of our tardy entry
into the quarrel; and a glad Margaret,
having recovered her respect for her
native land, consents to return home
to it.
Miss Rosalie TolleR played the
part with great charm and sympathy,
and with a lightly-worn grace and dig-
nity that were pure English. Serving
as a foil to her in taste and deportment
and social tradition, the Elsa Kolbeck
of Miss DoI.LY Holm Es - GoRE was
extraordinarily German—a quite re-
markable performance.
Miss MARIANNE CALDwell as Frau
Major Kolbeck, the hostess of Margaret,
made a most lovable drudge; and Miss
DoRA GREGoRY had no difficulty in
showing how the wife of a Prussian
Colonel, though in her husband's eyes
her main purpose in life may be to
minister to his inner man, can wield
an authority little less than that of
the All-Highest over the wives of the
regiment. Female society in the little
garrison town was further represented
by Miss MAY HAYsACK and Miss UNA
WENNING, who played, with more than
enough vivacity, a brace of giggling
flappers, very curious about the more
private portion of the bride's trousseau.
Miss WANE FEATHERStoN, as Lady
Lushington, had too little to do, and
did it most humanly; and Mr. OTHo
STUART illustrated with a very natural
ease the kind of simple friendship, as
between a man and a woman, which it
takes an Anglo-Saxon intelligence to
understand.
The officers, though there might have
been more of the blond beast about
them, were sufficiently Prussian, and
Mr. MALcot.M CHERRY, as Margaret's
husband, indicated with much precision
the change in the behaviour of a
German gentleman, after marriage,
towards the lady he has consented to
honour with the thing he calls his
heart.
Apart from the one or two doubtful
points which I have referred to, the
play went well, though it seems a pity
that so much insistence should have
been laid upon the lack of culture
(English sense) in households where
the strictest economy was essential.
One was conscious of a rather painful
note of vulgarity in the attitude of
Margaret's father, where he sniffs at
the sordid environment of her German
home. Impecuniosity is of course a
prevalent trouble among German offi-
cers in small garrison towns; but one
would have preferred that if bad taste
in dress and furniture had to be ridi-
culed the laugh should have been at
the expense of a richer society. Finally,

No well-fed person need ever quite
expect to understand one of Sir J. M.
BARRIE’s mystery plays at a single
sitting. That's one of his best trumps,
of course. But it always seems to me
that, like so many writers of genius, he
never quite knows what are his best
and what his poorest things, and just
tosses them to us to sort out for our-
selves. In this new instance, to work
off a piece of strictly professional
criticism, it is clear that both prologue
and epilogue are much too protracted.
It is a sound dramatic canon, which
not even our most brilliant chartered
libertine of stage-land can flout with
impunity, not to keep your audience
in too long a suspense while preparing
our salient theme, nor, after quicken-

distract with the irrelevant.

increased cost of living, an extra week's holiday
is to be given in the Easter vacation so that
boarding-house masters should not feel the

“The Head,” said Chapman major,
“may be a beast, but he's a bally
patriot. He swishes twice as hard on

that a corresponding sacrifice on our
part is necessary, and respectfully pray
that we may be permitted to give up
two weeks of the Easter term, thus
allowing ourselves more time for war-
work in our respective homes and
relieving our house-masters from an
overwhelming burden.”
The petition was formally handed to
the Head.
For two days he gave no sign. Then
on the morning of the third day he
arcse to address the school:—
“In the dark days through which
we are passing, when the liberties of

It pleases me to see that
the financial responsibili-
ties of the house-masters
are appreciated by their
charges. Would that our
Government had the
same patriotic horror of
extravagance! However
we must consider the
post - bellum conditions.
All the intellect of Eng-
land will be needed after
the War (“Double holi-
day task,” prophesied
Dyson). Yet I feel that
steps must be taken on
the lines of your petition
(an enthusiastic friend
here patted Chapman on
the back). So, after
consultation with the
house - masters, I have
a day when the War news is bad. I
felt the fall of Namur more than any-
one in England. What do you chaps
say to getting up a petition to him
stating that under the distressing cir-
cumstances we are ready to make
sacrifices and give up two weeks'
school?”
“Rot,” cried Dyson. “Hundred-and-
seventy more to do before call-over.
I'd rather go on ruining Dabs.”
But even Dyson, when once his lines
were finished, caught the infectious
spirit of patriotism, and, like the rest,
appended his signature to the following
prose composition from the laborious
pen of Chapman major:—
“To the REv. THE HEAD MASTER,-
Whereas the Great War for the liberties
of Europe involves sacrifices from all,
and the rise in prices must cause con-
siderable difficulties, hitherto endured
with noble self-effacement, to house-
masters, We, the undersigned, feel
arranged that in future only two courses
will be served at dinner, and that there
will be a reduction in the number of
breakfast dishes. Thus without your
being handicapped in the intellectual
contest your laudable and patriotic
desire to reduce expenses will be met.
I may repeat that your consideration
for your house-masters, who perform
useful and necessary functions, has
gratified me.”
Number 11 study that night was
barricaded against all comers. A howl-
ing crowd in the corridor was demand-
ing the blood of Chapman major.
“Didn't I tell you to keep on ruining

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Even those who have overloaded their shelves with books
about the War must, I think, find a place for From Mons
to Ypres with French, by FREDERIC Col.BMAN (SAMPson
Low). It is a most remarkably vivid and varied record of
the writer's experiences, set down in a very simple and
direct style, without the least effort at flummery and high-
falutin. I can speak for one reader at any rate on whom
it made a very deep impression. Mr. Col.BMAN is, by his
own account, an American and an automobilist. Those
who get his book will judge him, by the unadorned
account of what he did, to be a man of great courage and
modesty, with an imperturbable shrewdness and a humour
proof against all dangers and disappointments. Driving,
as he did, a motor-car for the British Headquarters, and
in particular for General DE LISLE, he saw as much fight-
ing as any man need wish for and had magnificent
opportunities of forming a judgment on the effects of
German shell-fire. There is a pathetic photograph of his
car hit by a shell outside Messines. I have spoken of the
simplicity and directness of Mr. Coll:MAN's style; he him-
self describes his book as a plain tale. It has, indeed,
that kind of plainness which in dealing with enterprises of
great pith and moment has a peculiar brilliancy of its own.
The account, for instance, of the Cambrai–Le Cateau battle,
with all its vicissitudes, is extraordinarily graphic and
interesting, and the story of the charge of some fifty men,
of the 9th Lancers against more than twice their number
of German Dragoons of the Guard stirs the blocd as with
the sound of a trumpet. Delightful too is the narrative
of how Major BRIDGEs found two hundred completely
exhausted stragglers seated despairingly upon the pave-
ment of the square at St. Quentin, and how by means of a
penny whistle and a toy drum he got them to move and
brought them eventually to Roye and safety. Altogether
a capital book.
A Great Success (SMITH, ELDER) is about a new-risen
literary star, Arthur Meadows, his loving, unbrilliant wife,
and a coruscating society lion-huntress, Lady Dunstable.
Having heard this much, you will hardly need to be told
that Lady D. takes up the author violently, that he is
dazzled by the glitter of her conversational snares, and that
the story resolves itself into a duel between her ladyship
and (I quote the publishers) “the wife whom she despises
and tries to set down.” Nor are you likely to be in any
uncertainty about the final victory. This is brought about,
with the assistance of the long arm of coincidence, by
Doris, the neglected wife, finding herself in a position to
prevent her rival's unsatisfactory son from contracting
matrimony with a very undesirable alien. Doris indeed,
and another female victim of Lady Dunstable (also de-
posited on the scene by the same obliging arm), get busy
unearthing so various a past for the undesirable one that
she retires baffled, epigrammatic brilliance bites the dust,
and domesticity is left triumphant. It is a jolly little story,
very short, refreshingly simple, and constructed throughout
on the most approved library lines. If the writer's name
were not Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, I should say that she
ought to be encouraged to persevere, and even recom-
mended to try her hand next time at something a little
more substantial.

[MARCH 22, 1916.
Let me recommend Mr. Rothay REYNolds' My Slav
Friends (MILLs AND BooN) as a corrective to Mr. STEPHEN
GRAHAM's Holy Russia, which I prescribed some while ago
with faint reservations. Both writers set out to interpret our
mysterious ally to us. Mr. GRAHAM always looks through
a rosy-tinted monocle. Mr. REYNoLDs takes the road of
balanced appreciations, candour and kindly humour—un-
questionably more effective in the matter of making sincere
proselytes. He has produced a fascinating book, discreetly
discursive—a book that seems to let you into the real secrets
of a people's soul. He believes in the sincerity of Russian
promises to Poland, and claims that the Poles share his
belief, but he does not pretend that this most unfortunate
of nations has no grievances against its suzerain. I wonder
whether our perverse Intelligences are capable of making
the deduction that, if the progressives in Russia can forget
their quarrel with reaction for sake of our great common
cause, they themselves might mitigate some of the severity
of their anti-tsarism. Mr. REYNoLDs has much that is
to the point to say about the good ord British legends of
darkest Russia now chiefly T. - --

novelists and unscrupulous
journalists. He makes it
clear that, though there is

with all three. Then there came on the scene one
Judith Ruddiger, a widow, with red lips, who drove a
great touring-car with abandon, played masculine golf and
generally appealed in Frensham to the elemental what-d'-
you-call-'ems. So these two decided to plunge into the
freer life by the process of elopement. I was a little dis-
appointed here. There had been so much chat about the
Big Things that I had expected a rather more expansive
setting to their adventure than Monte Carlo, followed by a
round of first-class hotels. Moreover Judith had a way of
addressing her companion as “partner,” which emphasised
her wild Western personality to a degree that must have
been almost painful at a winter-sports' resort full of school-
masters. So I was hardly at all astonished when before
long Frensham grew more bored than ever. Meanwhile
the adoring wife (whom the author has sketched very
sympathetically and well) had refused to divorce him; and
so in the long run—well, you can see from the start where
the long-run is destined to end. But you will probably not
like a pleasant tale the less for this. Mr. DEEPING cer.
tainly has courage. There is a scene or two in which he
takes his amazonian Judith to the very edge of bathos.

I should have been more impressed with this hero's feats
in the first few tales of As it Chanced if they had been in
the very ſaintest degree plausible. Never surely were such
preposterous fights, in which the whole action of a score
of desperate opponents is completely suspended while the
redoubtable one brings off his splendid stunts. I gratefully
remember once having been helped through a dull day by
The House on the Downs. Unless memory gilds my judg-
ment the author put some reasonable amount of invention
into that. But these collected tales are rather indifferent
pot-boiling if you are to take any other standard but that
of the gallery's formula for yarns of adventure. Perhaps,
“as it chanced,” my war lunch did not agree with me. But
anyway I really cannot quite honestly commend this
volume to any but the most stalwart of Mr. MARRiott
WATson's many loyal friends.

Who go aloof on philosophic quests,
Sucking the fruit of knowledge from the Hun-tree
And spiritual milk from alien breasts;

Of a great cause, with gallant hearts and gay,
Of youth and youth's high promise made surrender,
Because their courage knew the nobler way;
I envy not your chance on their returning;

There should be trouble in those Seats of Learning
Where you sat tight and took your pedants' ease.

PHILOGAMU.S.
(A Socratic Fragment.)
“. . . It is plain, therefore,” said Socrates, “that the
man whose soul is afflicted with illness will desire above
all things to have it cured as quickly as possible, and for
this purpose he will submit himself to one who understands
the curing of souls. So far, I think, we are agreed, are
we not ?”
“Yes, indeed,” said Agathon, “that would appear to be
the wisest course.”
“Then why,” said Socrates, “do we find that men who
are generally eager to be cured of an ague are indisposed to
take care of their soul when it is manifestly suffering 2
You yourself have declared that your soul is sick within
you, yet you consult nobody and take no steps.”
“Nay, nay, Socrates, I cannot allow you to catch me
like this. Perhaps I spoke thoughtlessly when I mentioned
my soul just now. Certainly I had not intended that you
should tie me up with your questions and draw conclusions
which it was impossible for me to foresee.”
“Then I suppose the fault must be mine, for in truth I
had not designed to catch anyone, least of all yourself, my
dear Agathon. But we will defer the consideration of the
matter to a more favourable time, for I see Philogamus
approaching and, if we may judge by the outward signs, he
seems to be, as one might say, in a terrible state.”
Hereupon we turned to observe Philogamus, to whom
indeed something painful and calamitous must have hap-
pened, for his garments were disarrayed and his hair was
unkempt, and anger was seated upon his frowning brow,
and he was muttering to himself and calling the gods to
witness that he was unjustly treated and that no such mis-
fortune had ever before happened to any other man; and
he was beating his hands wildly together and was forget-
ting to salute his friends. Seeing him thus distraught
Socrates plucked him by the sleeve as he passéd and
addressed him.
“Hail, Philogamus,” he said, “what great misfortune
do you announce to us? Have the Barbarians at last
seized upon the Piræus, and are they even now marching
irresistibly on the Acropolis 2 Are you sent out to summon
us to arms ? Here are a few of us who will join with you,
laying aside even their most pressing private business, and
will help to defend the State and themselves to the last
gasp. Only do you deliver your message and let us know.”
“This,” said Philogamus, “is no moment for laughing,
though in laughter, O Socrates, you are always easily first,
as they say, and the rest nowhere. But have you not
heard what has happened?”
“No,” said Socrates, “and we much desire to know.
I can speak confidently for myself, and Agathon here is,
I am sure, in a fever of impatience.”
“Listen, then, and, by the gods, you shall be made aware
of an injustice that calls for immediate redress. They are
even now on the point of calling up the married men to go
to the War.”
“That is very interesting; and what do the married men
say to it?”
“What do they say?" shouted Philogamus. “They
say they will not go unless, according to the promises of
Darbius and Ascuthius, all the unmarried men are taken
first;" and he began once more beating his breast and
| glaring with his eyes like a dog who has been for long
without water.
“Softly, my good friend,” said Socrates, “softly. As to
the promise, I know it is being rigidly kept. All the willing
single men are gone or going, and the unwilling are being
compelled to join as quickly as is possible. What more
can be done 2''
“Something ought to be done.”
“That is very true,” said Socrates; “something ought
always to be getting itself done, and the something at this
moment is that the Barbarians ought to be beaten. But
tell me, with regard to the married men, are they not
concerned in the safety and welfare of the State?”
“That, indeed, they are,” said Philogamus; “none more
so.”
“In that case why do they hang back and complain
when the State declares that its safety and welfare demand
that they should be ready to go? Because one here and
there has concealed himself, is it for you, a married man, to
retire when by going you might help to thrust back the
Barbarians? Are you one of those that are called the
attested ones 2"
“Yes, that I am,” said Philogamus, proudly displaying
his brown armlet with the red crown.
“Then it is you, as it appears to me, who have given a
pledge and made a promise, and that promise, I am sure,
you will fulfil to the best of your ability. When the time
comes it is for you to go at once and not to weary the
market-place with empty noise and murmurs of complaint.
For remember this: the man who has taken a wife and has
brought up children under the State's protection owes more,
if it be possible . . . .”
(Here the fragment ends.)

dents. Last night, for instance, two
men were proceeding (by the way the
great point about being a soldier is that
you never walk, run or otherwise ambu-
late—you proceed, or proceed at the
double, which of course is much nicer
for you)—yes, were proceeding, one at
each end of an entanglement, along the
top of a slope, when the leader missed
his footing altogether and rolled down
to the morass below. The second, after
a brief struggle, followed with the en-
tanglement. This movement involved
not only the man behind, who was
bearing a footboard, but also the re-
mainder of the section. The entire
avalanche was precipitated on to the
leaders, and remained there struggling
like the population of a fly-paper until
a squad arrived with wire-cutters,
When the R.E. heard of it they wanted
the episode published in Corps Orders
as a testimonial. But what the men
wanted done about the R.E.. I dare not
tell you.
THE TRUTH ABOUT CINEMALAND.
A DISTINGUISHED neutral observer,
who has just returned from a visit to
Cinemaland, has furnished our repre-
sentative with the following interesting
account of his experiences and con-
clusions.
One of the first things (he says)
that impressed me was that in the
great cities of Cinemaland there is,
outwardly at least, little or no sign
of scarcity. On the contrary, at the
various hotels and restaurants, as well
as several private entertainments that
came under my observation, a note of
almost wanton luxury appeared to be
aimed at. Evening dress is worn when-
ever possible, and the costumes of the
ladies are invariably the last word in
ultra-fashionable extravagance. Food
is as yet chviously plentiful; what is
not consumed being frequently flung
about, especially by the humorous
elements of the population, and wasted
with reckless prodigality.
In spite however of this ostentation
signs are not wanting that the true
condition of the country is increas-
ingly precarious. Crime of all sorts is
rampant. Judging even by what I
myself witnessed within a short period,
the detectives of Cinemaland must all
be working overtime. Quite recently
a gang, under the leadership of a ruffian
who elected to be known as The Clutch-
ing Hand, made large sums of money by
working upon the terrors of its victims.
Another significant symptom is that
respect for law and authority as such
appears to be almost non-existent. The
police force of Cinemaland is a body
of men who are most of them of con-
spicuously full habit. I can vouch for
it that the appearance of these officials
is almost invariably greeted with de-
rision; and should they (as frequently
happens) incur physical maltreatment
or other misfortune in the exercise
of their duties popular sympathy is
almost always on the side of their
opponents.
A notable exception to this feeling
is found in the attitude of the populace
towards their chosen ruler, the Emperor,
or Film-Lord, Charlemagne-Chaplin. It
is only fair to record that recent spec-
tacular (and carefully stage-managed)
appearances of the monarch have been
greeted with every demonstration of
unswerving loyalty and affection.
More significant perhaps to an out-
side spectator is the undeniable fact
that the Wild Western portions of
Cinemaland are to-day in a state of tur-
bulence bordering upon anarchy. The
Cowboys, who are its chief denizens,
would seem, so far as my experience
goes, to spend their entire time in ex-
ploits of murderous violence; though
here (as elsewhere among this remark-
able people) the influence of sentiment
is often unexpectedly potent. It can
hardly be doubted that a populace so
emotional and ill-balanced as that of
Cinemaland will have little power to
withstand the strain of disaster.
Despite my apparent freedom from
restraint I am persuaded that I was
kept under the observation of a number
of uniformed officials during the whole
course of my stay in Cinemaland; and
I am bound to confess that my de-
parture, which was made under cover
of darkness, was not unattended with
a sense of personal relief.

PARABLES FOR BOSCHES.
ONCE upon a time there was a Father
who was devoted to his child. He fed
it and nursed it and watched it grow
and gave it toys to play with—both
soldiers and boats. Also he made it
promises that some day he would ex-
tend their house and garden until no
house and garden were bigger. Every
year he took it to the top of a high
precipice and showed it beautiful lands
and water which should some day be
theirs.
The child had heard this promise so
often that it used to ask, “When 2
when 2" And always the answer
was, “Some day, some day.” -
And then at last the day came, and
the Father took the child to the high
precipice yet once more, but behold it
chanced that they both fell over and
were smashed, the Father hopelessly
and the child very, very badly, so that
it would for long years or perhaps for
evermore be a cripple.
ONE OF OUR ALLIES.
SoMEWHERE in France—no, let me
be bold and say in Paris—there is a
young French soldier named Charles.
Less than two years ago he was a
plumber and whole; to-day he has but
one arm, his left; the other and a piece
of his shoulder with it having gone in
saving his country from the foe.
Charles is shy and very modest, and
no bigger than so many French youths
—he is only twenty-two—with dark-
brown hair and blue eyes with very
black centres, and a moustache that
never succeeds in looking more than
three weeks old. Being, however, brave,
he does not let his maimed condition
unduly trouble him, but runs his
errands (all that he can now do) and
whistles as he runs, and is glad to be
alive at all, instead of dead, as so many
of his comrades are and as his Colonel
is, as I shall tell.
At the Front Charles's duties were
these. A despatch—a pli, as they call
it—would be given him either back of
the lines to deliver in the trenches, or
in the trenches to deliver back of the
lines, and in order to get there, if fight-
ing was in progress, it was necessary
for him to crawl for perhaps one or two
kilometres on his stomach. On a cer-
tain day of intense activity, Charles in
his trench was handed one of these
critical missives for the commanding
officer, who was a kilometre or so
behind, and this he placed in his satchel
and then began the hazardous journey.
No one ever knows when the supreme
moment of his life is coming; nor did
Charles, but it was then.
This being a terrific day—as a
matter of fact it was during the famous
battle for the Maison du Passeur,
when the French and Germans were
losing and retaking trenches for hours
—he had to crawl all the way, only to
come suddenly upon the body of the
commanding officer himself stretched
dead in a carrot field.
To Charles's mind there was then
but one thing to do, and that was, as he
had been unable to deliver the message,
to take it back to the sender. He
therefore started on the return jour-
ney, and was only a few yards from
his trench, and still un-hit, when he
found a wounded officer on the ground.
Here was a new problem, but neces-
sarily having to stand up and throw
aside all precautions, Charles got him
as well as he could on his back and,
still un-hit, half carried, half supported,
him to the trench, and was at once
away again with his despatch. It
was at this moment that an explod-
ing shell hurled the satchel from his
hands and flung it on the open ground

i between the French trenches and the
enemy's, which were here separated
only by a few yards. At any cost the
despatch must not fall into German
hands, and Charles, who miraculously
had not been injured by the explosion,
began instantly to climb out of the
trench to recover it, and this in spite of
a sergeant, who called to him to keep
under cover. But Charles, having one
idea and one only, and that was to save
from the foe the despatch that had
been entrusted to him, succeeded in
reaching it and securing it; and then
came another shell that shattered his
arril.
That is all he remembers; but he
must have rolled back to the bottom of
the trench, where he was found, two
days later, still clutching the satchel.
And after that, although he remembers
the coffee he was given to drink, all is a
haze until he came fully to himself in
hospital and found that no longer had
he a right arm.
Such is the story of Charles's effort
for his country.
Now I do not claim for Charles that
he is any braver or has a finer sense
of duty than many another French
soldier; but this I know, that when he
recovered he was summoned to the
Invalides to receive not only the Croic
de Guerre but the Médaille Militaire
with the palm, which corresponds to
our Victoria Cross, and that now,
although, having left the Army, he no
longer wears uniform but merely such
poor civilian clothes as he can afford
as a messenger, when he walks along
the Boulevards — which he does as
seldom as he can, so shy is he—
there is not an officer, seeing the
ribbons on his coat, who does not
salute this little plumber with as much
punctilio as though he were General
JoFFRE himself; and, blushing crimson,
Charles returns the salute.

Nor in my home can quite escape the spell
But freeze with horror at the front-door bell,
For fear the parlour-maid may speak my knell,
May knock and say that he is in the hall.

FUNK-HOLES FOR MINISTERS.
DESIGNED FOR PROTECTION AGAINST RAIDS BY OUR AIR-ExPERTs.
Tuesday, March 21st. — Returning
from Westminster this afternoon 1
stumbled in Whitehall upon a Member
whom I had not seen in his place this
Session. “Going down to the House?”
I asked. “What, is it sitting” he
replied; and then it appeared that he
was just home on short leave after
working hard “somewhere on the Con-
timent,” and had no present interest in
political controversy. As I reflected
on a speech I had just listened to, it
occurred to me that the attitude of
some of the stay-at-home Members
towards the War is much the same as
that of my hon, friend towards the
House. “What, is it still going on ?”
If the Germans were in occupation
of the Black Country, if Oxford were
being daily shelled, as Rheims is, and if
with a favouring breeze London could
hear the dull rumble of the bombard-
ment, as Paris can, I wonder if Mem-
bers would still be encumbering the
Order-paper with the sort of trivialities
that now find place there.
An exception may be made in favour
of Mr. Joe KING. He has discovered
a little late in the day that a war
is going on in Europe, and that it
affects a little country called Belgium,
whose neutrality was guaranteed by
the Powers. He was anxious to know
whether Belgium had formally re-
nounced her neutrality, and was no
doubt greatly surprised to learn from
Sir Edward GREY that, owing to one
of the guaranteeing Powers having
invaded her, Belgium had become a
belligerent.
I do not know whether Mr. PRINGLE
was in the House when this announce-
ment was made. But if so it evidently
created no impression on his mind. In
the debate on the Army Estimates he
followed Captain TRYon, who had de-
livered an urgent appeal to the Govern-
ment from the text, “A strong Army
and a shorter War.” Mr. PRINGLE's
ideal is just the reverse. In his view
the Army is too big already, and
is taking too great a toll from our
industrial and commercial population.
The great men who won the Napoleonic
War—after twenty-three years—had
not a big army; and the consequence
was that, while it was going on, British
trade expanded by leaps and bounds.
To-day, owing to our disastrous mili-
tary policy the demands upon our
tonnage were so heavy that people
had to go short of sugar and tobacco.
Let us conserve our resources and be
ready to dictate terms when Germany
has been financially ruined. When
Mr. PRINGLE at last sat down aſter
three-quarters of an hour of this sort
of thing I longed for ten minutes of
Mr. BALFour at his best. But he was
not present, and Mr. LoNG was so much
occupied in defending the Government
against the charge of having broken
faith with the married men that Mr.
PRINGLE never got the trouncing he
deserved.
Wednesday, March 22nd.— One of
the most cherished beliefs of the House
of Commons is that upon the Second
Reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill
anything under the sun may be dis-
cussed. Colonel YATE was justly sur-
prised, therefore, when the SPEAKER
ruled that he was out of order in criti-
cising the Indian Government for its
conduct of the Mesopotamian Expedi-
tion, and advised him to reserve his
remarks for the Indian Budget dis-
cussion—equivalent in these times to
the Greek Kalends.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was surprised too,
but, regardless of the ruling, proceeded
to make a carefully-prepared reply to
the speech which the hon. and gallant
Member had not been allowed to
deliver. He frankly admitted that
there had been a lamentable break-
down of the hospital arrangements,
but steps had been taken to improve
them, and a telegram from General
LARE showed that the treatment of
the men wounded in the recent engage-
ment was satisfactory.

OR THE LONDON
PUNCH,
Parliamentary friends ought to have
warned him that the House does not
care to listen to a man reading extracts
from his own leading articles, however
prophetic they may have been: that
the constant reiteration of a phrase
such as “I would like to suggest,
Mr. SPEAKER,” soon becomes tiresome,
and that to call somebody else “the
De Rougemont of the air" is to invite
the tu quoque. Members became more
and more impatient as the orator
became more and more dogmatic ;
and when he rhetorically demanded
the name of “one man to whom
we could turn to solve the prob-
lem” they derisively chorused, “BILL-
ING!”. Mr. TENNANT, recognising the
feeling of the House, did not spend
much time in refuting Mr. BILLING's
wild assertions, but devoted most of
his speech to replying to Mr. JoyNSON-
Hicks, who had pleaded that the East-
Coast towns should be more promptly
warned of approaching air-raids. He
had personally investigated the arrange-
ments and was positively “staggered"
at “the wonderful network that had
been set up,” and he invited Mr.
Joy Nson - Hicks to come with him
privately and share his amazement.
Mr. ELLIS GRIFFITH was not convinced.
He thought that there were still too
many strands of red tape in the net-
work, and reiterated the hope that the
DERBY Committee would soon develop
into a Ministry of the Air.
Thursday, March 23rd.—A distress-
ing report in the papers this morning,
that the Galloper had been blown up
by the Germans, made the friends of
Sir FREDERICK SMITH anxious. Had
he, on one of his periodical visits to
the trenches to see Friend WINSTON,
stumbled across an enemy mine?
Happily the report was grossly exagger-
ated. The Galloper was only a light-
ship, and had not been destroyed by
the enemy but merely withdrawn by
the Trinity House; and on the Treasury
Bench this afternoon there was the
ATToRNEY-GENERAL very much alive.
Mr. TREveLYAN had a motion on the
paper condemning the administration
of the Defence of the Realm Act, and
in support of it produced a sheaf of
cases, in which he said the Govern-
ment had abused its powers. Among
other acts of vile oppression they had
ravished from her home, on Septem-
ber 1st, while her father was away
shooting partridges, and had subse-
quently interned without trial, a young
lady against whom no charge had been
formulated. It sounded very dreadful,
and someone called out, “Is this a
Russian case?”
Then arose Sir F. E. SMITH, and
with a few forensic gestures demolished
Veteran (instructing “Bantam” in his duties as sentry). “You Look overt THERE-
THERE's THE GERMANs.

had so laboriously erected. Most of his
cases were out of court because they
had already been in court, the deci-
sions he impugned being those of the
magistrates. As for the daughter of
the partridge-slayer she was an asso-
ciate of a notorious German spy, and
had come back from Switzerland with
a message for one of his agents. As
her case had been fully considered by
the late HoME SECRETARY he suggested
that Mr. TREvelyAN should talk to him
about it. -
This was the most pungent speech
of the afternoon.
the House in fits of laughter for ten
minutes while in his most rasping
tones he jerked out epigrams against
“this thing calling itself a Govern-
ment.” The Coalition was described
as “two poisons blended, which could
not make a wholesome drink.” Never
before has he had such a success. I
only hope it will not turn his head
and encourage him to attempt consci-
ous humour.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE BARTON MYSTERY.”
ONE of the most difficult feats of
- juggling is, I understand, the deft toss-
ing up and catching of a heavy weight
(say a dumb-bell), a very light weight,
such as a champagne cork, together
with any old thing of irregular shape,
a bedroom candlestick, for instance.
Mr. WALTER HACKETT's The Barton
Mystery is a most ingenious turn of
this sort.
The fiancé of the sister of the wife of
Richard Standish, M.P., is under sen-
tence of death for the murder of Mr.
Barton. He happens to be innocent,
though he admits at the trial that he
quarrelled violently with and even
threatened Barton on the night of the
murder, and his revolver has been found
by the dead man's side. That vindictive
relict, Mrs. Barton, is holding back some
material evidence which could save the
condemned man, or so Standish thinks,
and she is adamant. Now Barton was
unquestionably a bad egg, but the
widow doesn't want the whole world
to know it—at least not till she finds
the woman. Some woman, who had
incidentally written some, shall we say,
very impetuous love letters, is being
shielded. Who is she? Is it Standish's
wife, for instance? Ah . . . This is
the dumb-bell.
A Lady Marshall, the wife of a Sir
Everard Marshall, a comic scientist in
perpetual flight from his overwhelming
spouse, is one of the sort that finds a
new religion every few months and is
now in the first fast furious throes of
her latest, which is some form of psycho-
mania, whereof the high priest is one
Beverley, a plausible ringletted charla-
tan of alcoholic tendencies (Sludge the
Medium, without his cringe and snarl),
who ekes out his spasmodic visitations
of genuine psychic illumination with
the most shameless spoof. This is
the cork. .
The candlestick is the dream motif,
always a ticklish business to handle,
and in this particular case—well, no, I
won't be such a spoil-sport as to go into
that, for the chief pleasure of this kind
of an entertainment is the succession
of pleasant unexpected shocks which
are deftly administered to the audience
by the author.
There were times indeed when the
latter nearly dropped his dumb-bell—
times when it was in imminent peril
of barging into the cork; and most
certainly the candlestick very nearly
slipped out of his hand. But it just
didn't, so you will see that it was really
a most exceptional piece of jugglery.
Of course I will admit you have to
swallow the robust assumption that
into a household over which the shadow
of death in its ugliest form hovers so
threateningly two fatuous people, to
wit the scientist and his wife, can
come and babble about their own
trivial domestic troubles or their latest
philosophy of life. But then mystery
plays always are like that, and this is a
jolly good one of its kind—a kind which
it pains me, as a superior person, to
confess that I liked enormously.
Mr. H. B. IRVING as the preposterous
Beverley was in his very best form.
Beverley is really a creation. How

player's it would be an impertinence

to inquire. This imperturbable trickster
with his thin streak of genuine sen-
sitiveness, to psychic influence; his
grotesquely florid style—the man cer-
tainly has style; his frank reliance on
apt alcohol's artful aid; his cadging
epicureanism; his keen eye for supple-
mentary data for his inductions and
prophecies; his cynical candour when
detected, is presented to us with Mr.
IRVING's rich-flavoured and most whim-
sical sense of comedy, with all his
exuberant abundance of gracious or
fantastic gesture and resourceful busi-
ness. In the trances, sometimes real,
sometimes simulated, he gives you a
plausible sketch of how a modicum of
psychic power (whatever that may be),
laced with whisky neat, might colour
a séance. Mr. HACKETT, by way of
showing that he has not ignored the
literature of his subject, has adapted
from the admirable, but, I regret to
say, entirely untrustworthy, because
incurably original, MAETERLINck an en-
tirely new definition of psychometry.
But we certainly will not go into that.
Mr. HolMAN CLARK as the sceptical
Sir Everard, completely spoofed by
Beverley in the end, with an elaborate
make-up ruthlessly reminding us of
our simian ancestry, potters cleverly
about the stage with that admirable
and amiable craft which he has at such
easy command. Miss MARIE ILLINGTON
as Lady Marshall, the seeker after
light, kept the burlesquerie of her part
skilfully within bounds—indeed this
matter of key was extraordinarily well
handled by the three players entrusted
with what I have ventured to call the
cork motif.
As to the more serious business, Mr.
H. W. Esmond seemed to behave very
much as one would imagine a decent
M.P. behaving in such embarrassing
circumstances. He suspected his wife
with all the ardour which public
men on the stage always exhibit. His
little turn of desperate tragedy carried
conviction—almost too much convic-
tion, as you will find—but I won't
explain.
Miss JEssIE WINTER, as his wife,
very adroitly contrived an ambiguous
effect of likely guilt but possible inno-
cence.
theatre, but she must (may I tell her?)
arrest the development of “the Fatal
Caesura,” that exasperating histrionic
device whereby every salient phrase
is broken up for no conceivable reason
into two halves. In the secondary
stages there is but slender hope of a
cure; in the tertiary there is none.
Miss DARRAGH was, as required, the
vindictive widow to the life (this kind
of life, you understand), and Miss HILDA
BAYLEY played very charmingly the
little wilful fiancée who—but no, I must
keep my promise.
With much less evidence than the
applause and generally keyed-up atti-
tude of the Savoy audience afforded me,
I could risk a psychic communication
in the authentic manner of a Beverley
séance. “All is dark . . . It is getting
light . . . I see a man . . . He leans
eagerly to a telephone . . . He thrusts
something into envelopes. He goes on
thrusting things into envelopes. The
telephone keeps ringing . . . It is . . .

In an account of a BURNs' celebration
given by the North Battleford News

absence of any kind of spirituous liquors
around the festive board and the fact
that the ladies were present” were
unique features of the entertainment.

was yet another: “‘The Immoral

Mr. Orguly Bolp's large painting, en-
titled “Embrocation,” is an interesting
experiment in the handling of aplanatic
surfaces, in which the toxic determin-
ants are harmonized by a sort of plastic
meiosis with syncopated
rhythms. His other large
picture, “Interior of a
| Dumbbell by Night,” has
the same basic idea with-
out the appearance of it,
and gives a very vital sense
of the elimination of nou-
menal perceptivity. M.
Paparrigopoulo, the Greek
Paraphrast, calls one of his
pictures “The Antecedent,”
another “The Relative,”
and a third “The Correla-

TRUTH FUL JAMES
ON DOCTORS.
“You’re not looking well,” said the
staff of The Muddleton Weekly Gazette
sympathetically.
“No, Sir. Can't sleep, Sir. Haven't
done for days till last night. I went
off beautiful quite early, and then the
new nurse come and woke me to give
me my sleeping draught. That finished
it for the night. Strange thing, sleep.
There 's no sense about it. Take Bill
Company. He was hit and took to
hospital. Not serious at all. “Me for
a rest cure,' he says. But he was in
that hospital for weeks and weeks,
getting worse and worse; he couldn't
sleep a wink. The more they drugged
him, and the more sheep he counted,
the more wide-awake he was. The
doctors got angry and called him an
obstinate case. He said it wasn't
poisons but noise he needed, so they
fetched an orderly and set him banging
one of them frying-pan baths with a
ram-rod. In five minutes Bill falls
asleep as peaceful as a lamb, and the
orderly, being tired, stops. Up leaps
Bill, wide awake as ever, asking what's
wrong. Naturally they couldn't bang
a bath for him all night every night,
and the house surgeon was just think-
ing about getting ready a slab in the
mortuary, when Bill's brother, an
engine-driver, comes along. He took
Bill to his box just outside Charing
Cross station and made up a bed for
him there. Bill slept for three days
solid and was about again in a week.”
“Very fortunate,” murmured the
Gazette.
“So that time, you see, the doctors
was done. But that don't often happen.
There was a doctor I knew out there,
name of Gordon. Young fellow he was,
too, and very keen ; seemed to think
the War was started specially to give
him surgical practice, and he loved his
lancets more than his mother. He
used to welcome cases with open arms,
so to speak, do his very best to heal
'em quick, and weep when he suc-
ceeded. Well, he happened to be in
our trench one day, showing our Sub
a new case of knives, when Charlie
Black was carried in on a stretcher
in an awful mess.
“‘I must operate at once to save
your life,' he says.
“Charlie smiled as best he could and
said he was agreeable.
he says, “and I can't do it without.
Couldn't you do a faint for me 2'
“Charlie says he's sorry, but he's
never practised fetching a ſaint at will,
like a woman can.

“But there's no anaesthetic here,' .
“‘Well, then,' he says, ‘you’ll have
to be stunned.' And he fetches a small
sandbag and gives it to the stretcher-
bearer. -
“‘Chap here, he explains to Charlie,
‘will count up slowly, and when he
gets to fifty he'll hit you on the head
with the sandbag and knock you out.'
“Charlie grins, and the stretcher-
bearer begins to count. When he gets
to ten he rolls up his sleeves; when he
gets to twenty he takes a good grip of
the sandbag; at thirty he rolls his
eyes and sticks out his jaw; at forty,
he lifts the bag over his shoulder and
draws one foot back, Charlie watching
him all the time. “For-ty-six,’ he
says slowly, ‘for-ty seven, for-ty-eight,
for-ty-nine,' and then y -
“You’re not going to tell me that
he really * * -
“No, he didn't,” said Truthful James.
“Charlie fainted.” -
“That was their intention, I pre-
sume 2" - -
“Your presumption is correct, Sir.
The doctor finished the job before
Charlie come to again. Smart, wasn't
it 2 ”
“Very smart indeed.”
“But that's nothing. Nothing at
all to what he could do. He once cut
a fellow open, took out his liver, ex-
tracted twenty-three shrapnel bullets
from it, bounced it on the floor to see
it was all right, and put it back, all
inside of three minutes. And the
fellow what owns the liver hasn't had
a to-morrow morning head-ache once
since.”
“He must be a very clever doctor,”
suggested the other, to fill in a pause.
“Talking of doctors,” James went on,
“reminds me of a man I saw out there
who wasn't a doctor, leastways not one
of ours. We was in the fire-trenches
one night when a voice hails us from
the other side of the entanglements.
After the usual questions we brings him
over the parapet, and he explains to
our Sub that he's been in front attend-
ing to some wounded men in a listening
post what was blown up. All perfectly
correct and proper; gives his name and
rank, too, and is wearing an R.A.M.C.
uniform—rank, Captain. As he passes
me on his way to the Sub's dug-out I
happens to catch sight of his face, and
it give me quite a shock. I was took
ill immediate. I manages to stagger
to the dug-out, and I mutters hoarsely,
'Sir, I'm sick. I think I'm going to
die.’
“‘Sick 2' says the Sub. "You don't
look sick.’
“‘I'm sorry, Sir,' I says.
“‘Well,' says he, turning to the
other man, “the Captain here will soon
put you right.'
“‘Certainly, says the Doc very sharp.
‘Where do you feel pain—stomach,
heart, head 2'
“‘No, Sir," says I, ‘I got a nawful
pain in me inn'erds.'
“‘What did you say?' he asks.
“In me inn'erds, Sir," I says,
“spreading from me gizzard to me
probossis,' them being the only out-
of-the-way words I could think of
off-hand. - -
“‘H’m,' says he, pretending to under-
stand perfectly, “it is probably nothing
serious. You must diet yourself; take
nothing but light food and
“Here the Sub interrupts him,
thinking there's something mighty
queer about a doctor what is so ready
to prescribe diet for a probossis, and
asks him a lot more questions. Of
course the beer was in the sawdust
then, and very soon a guard was called
up to take our German Captain Doctor
Spy away to a safe place.
“It was lucky I knew his face. Before
perfidjus Albion forced this war on the
poor KAYSER I'd seen him often in
London. He was boss of a firm above
the place where I worked, and he used
to order his Huns about in their own
language, and chuck his empty lager
bottles out of his window into our
yard. I'm glad I got my own back
for that.”
“Jim,” cried an orderly, “you're
wanted for your dressing.”
James rose languidly. “That m ans
na-poo, then, Sir," he said.
“Na-poo 2" echoed the Gazette.
“Where's your learning, Sir 2"
asked James. “That's French for
“no more.’”
“I hope your dressing will not be
painful,” ventured the other.
“How would you like to have a probe
rammed through your hand twice a
day?" demanded James with a smile.
“But it's all part of the game.

THE DOVE.
I was at first inclined to look upon this dove as being
largely symbolical. So far as I could gather it had never
had seen it here or in the neighbourhood, and it seemed
obvious that its sudden emergence, as it were, out of
Probably before the end
of the week the KAISER
would sue for peace and

however, Verdun has
happened and von
TIRPITZ has gone, and
nobody seems in the
least disposed to stop
the crash of arms. That
being so, and the dove
being still with us, I
am forced, in spite of
myself, to look upon it
as an entirely real bird
and to keep on won-
dering what strange
freak brought it to us
and made it an hon-
oured member of this
household.
|
It arrived about ten
weeks ago quite unex-
pectedly and suddenly.
One morning there was
no dove; on the fol-
lowing morning, having
fluttered hither from I
know not what remote
and solitary region, it
had perched on the
branch of a poplar set
close to the house.
There it remained while
we breakfasted, and
from that point of
yantage it broke out
into a long series of
loud and melodious
cooings that sounded
like nothing so mºn
been here before—at any rate no one could be found who
nothing must have some high and dove-like signification.o
~
in the looking-glass and at once began to parade up and
down before it, swelling itself out and bobbing its head in
evident admiration of the beautiful being so fortunately
offered to its view. Soon it attempted to approach this
vision, but was surprised to find itself foiled by the cold im-
permeable surface of the glass. Puzzled, but not, I think,
definitely hopeless—it performs the same antics in one or
ther of the bedrooms every day—it left the toilet-table,
- - - circled round the room
and perched confidingly
on the shoulder of one
of the little girls who
were admiring it, and
began once more to
coo in a very ecstasy
of enjoyment.
Later cn, food was
provided for it, which it
pecked up without the
least shyness. Since
then it has established
itself on a very firm
clawing, if I may use
the term, as a necessary
inmate of the house.
Fluttering through the
passages it follows the
maids from room to
room in the morning
and shows the most
lively interest in their
work while beds are
being made or tables
dusted. It has the
most perfect trustful-
ness, not merely allow-
ing itself to be handled,
but coming to perch
on a wrist or shoulder
as if it had belonged
there from time im-
memorial. It really is
a pretty thing to have
about the house, an
embodiment of gentle-
ness and kindness, and,
so far as a mere human
being can judge, of an
almost dog-like grati-
tude and affection. I

agitation of love when
from its cage it beheld
its dear mistress enter

guest. It was wonderful to hear it.
From the branch this persistent and pleasing bird
shortly removed itself to the window-sill of one of the
bedrooms, and into this room, when breakfast was over,
the children trooped. The dove was pecking eagerly at the
window-pane. “Let's open the window for it,” said one
of the girls, “and see what happens.” Very gently, then,
the window was opened, and what immediately happened
was that, without the least sign of alarm, nay rather with
the air of one repeating a customary action, the dove
walked in, took a short flight, and settled on the toilet-
table. There it caught sight of its soft grey reflection
- - never occurred to me
before this to attribute such a feeling to a dove. I ought,
I suppose, to have known better, as I now do. At this
very moment it is cooing away like mad at its declaration
of undying love from its favourite haunt on the mantel-
piece of one of the bedrooms.
But it has another utterance which it employs at rare
intervals. This is a sort of high-pitched laugh thoroughly
unsuited to its softness, a most cynical and derisive sound
which in so kind a beak seems to have neither meaning
nor purpose. But I overlook its rare laugh in consideration
of the cooing with which it blesses us and the general
friendship which it has vowed to this house.

said he had met you in Shanghai.”
“Not really ' " I exclaimed.
“Yes. He met you in Shanghai.”
“That's frightfully interesting,” I
said. “What did he say about me?”
“That's what I couldn't hear,” she
replied. “You see I had to pay some
attention to my own crowd. I only
caught the word ‘delightful.'”
Ever since she told me this I have
been turning it over in my mind; and
it is particularly vexing not to know
more. “Delightful” can be such jargon
and mean nothing—or, at any rate,
nothing more than amiability. Still,
that is something, for one is not al-
ways amiable, even when meeting
strangers. On the other hand it
r
might be, from this man, the highest
praise.
The whole thing naturally leads to
thought, because I have never been
farther east than Athens in my life.
Yet here is a man who met me in
Shanghai. What does it mean? Can
we possibly visit other cities in our
sleep? Has each of us an alter ego,
who can really behave, elsewhere?
Whether we have or not, I know that
this information about my Shanghai
double is going to be a great nuisance
to me. It is going to change my char-
acter. In fact it has already begun to
do so. Let me give you an example.
Only yesterday I was about to be
very angry with a telegraph boy who
brought back a telegram I had de-
spatched about two hours earlier,
saying that it could not be delivered
because it was insufficiently addressed.
Obviously it was not the boy's fault,
for he belonged to our country post-
office and the telegram had been sent
to London and was returned from there;
and yet I started to abuse that boy as
though he were not only the Post-
MASTER-GENERAL himself but the in-
ventor of red-tape into the bargain.
And all for a piece of carelessness of
my own.
And then suddenly I remembered
Shanghai and how delightful I was
there. And I shut up instantly and
apologised and rewrote the message
and gave the boy a shilling for him-
self. If one could be delightful in
Shanghai one must be delightful at
home too.
And so it is going to be. There is
very little fun for me in the future,
and all because of that nice-mannered
man in Shanghai whom I must not
disgrace. For it would be horrible if
one day a lady told him that she
had overheard someone who had met
him in London and found him to be
a bear.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, March 28th.-Sir Edward
CARson was back on the Front Opposi-
tion Bench to-day, so much the better
for his recent rest-cure that he is
credited with the desire to prescribe
similar treatment for other jaded poli-
ticians. Three of the potential patients
—the PRIME MINISTER, the ForLIGN
SECRETARY and the MINISTER of MUNI-
TIONs — have anticipated his kindly
suggestion by going for a little
trip on the Seine, and are
making arrangements with
their Continental friends for
another on the Spree at a
| later date.
Before his departure Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE, ever thought-
ful for the welfare of others,
arranged with the Military
authorities to give a change
of scene to six membots of
the Clyde Workers' Committee,
who have been recently over-
straining their vocal chords.
This was the impression I got
from Dr. ADDIsoN, who, like
his great namesake, is a master
of the bland style; but Sir
Edward CARson thrust aside
official euphemism and bluntly
inquired whether these men
were not in fact assisting the
KING's enemies, and ought not
to be indicted for high treason.
The suppression of a number
of Sinn Fein papers in Ireland

concoction of a Question about

almost entirely of a catalogue of fatal
accidents to aviators, due, he declared,
to the faulty engines and machines

caution he was disappointed,
for, owing to the storm, Mr.

authorities, who tried to allay public
anxiety by mounting a dummy gun,
was shared by the House.
Mr. TENNANT did not attempt to deny
or palliate this imposture, but he made
a fairly adequate reply to other counts
of the indictment, and promised a
judicial inquiry into the casualties
enumerated by Mr. BILLING. The
revelation that he himself has a son
in the Flying Corps was perhaps the
most effective point in a speech which
did not wholly remove the
impression that the Govern-
ment has its head in the air
rather than its heart.
Wednesday, March 29th.-
There are more ways than one
of getting into the House of
Commons. Mr. PERCY HARRIs,
the new Member for the Mar-
ket Harborough division, who
took his seat to-day, arrived by
the old-fashioned route of a
contested election. He was
just about to shake hands with
the SPEAKER when a khaki-
clad stranger took a short cut
from the Gallery and reached
the floor per saltum. Not only
so, but before he could be
arrested this Messenger from
Mars succeeded in delivering
his maiden speech, to the
effect that British soldiers'
heads should be protected
against shrapnel - fire. The
SERJEANT-AT-ARMs, who had
had a narrow escape, goes
further, holding the view that
his own head should be pro-
tected from acrobatic British
soldiers.
To-day Mr. LoNG had the
difficult task of convincing the
House that the married men
had no grievance, and that
the Government were doing
their best to remove it. Only

taining that those who had voted
against the Military Service Bill were
the truest friends of the PRIME MIN-
ISTER, he promised again to give him
his invaluable support “if he would
only lead us to our accustomed pas-
ture.” There is no justification, how-
ever, for the theory that the worthy

Thursday, March 30th.-In the Lords
to-day Wiscount TEMPLETown moved
that London should be declared a pro-
hibited area, with a view to removing
the eight or nine thousand Germans
still carrying on business there. His
argument was a little difficult to follow,
for it included a complaint that in East-
bourne, which is a prohibited area, a
number of aliens are residing in comfort
and affluence. The Marquis of LANs-
Down E, usually so logical, on this
occasion answered inconsequence by
inconsequence. In one breath he
asserted that to declare the whole of
the Metropolis a prohibited area would
throw too much work on the police;
and in the next that it would have the
effect of driving away large numbers of
aliens to places not so well policed as
London is.
Lord BERESFORD caught the infection.
In the course of a long question designed
to clear General Townshend of the re-
sponsibility for the advance upon Bag-
dad, he remarked with startling irrele-
vance that if his (Lord BERESFORD's)
advice had been taken by the PRIME
MINISTER the Lusitania would still
be afloat and we should have lost no
battleships in the Dardanelles. He did
not appear to attach undue importance
to this claim, and Lord IsIINGTON, who
replied for the Government, did not
think it necessary to make any refer-
ence to it, but contented himself with
stating that the Bagdad advance was
authorised on the advice of General
NIxoN and the Indian Government,
and professing official ignorance of any
representations on the part of General
Townshen D.
In the Commons the trouble on the
Clyde was the pièce de résistance.
At Question time Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
fresh from the Paris Conference, had
to deal with a number of inquiries
put by the little group of Scottish
malcontents whose notion of patriot-
ism is to embarrass the Government
on each and every occasion. Mr.
Hogg E wanted to know when the
MINISTER of MUNITIONs was going to
give the other side of the case—“the
German side,” as an interrupter perti-
nently put it; and Mr. PRINGLE inti-
mated that a settlement could have been
reached but for the unreasonableness of
the Government.
This gave Dr. ADDIsoN, usually the
mildest-mannered man that ever lanced
a gumboil, an opportunity of adminis-
tering to his accuser a much-needed
lesson in deportment. The hon. Mem-
ber had first forced himself, without
invitation, into a private conversation
in the Minister's room, and had then
given a totally misleading account of
what took place. He had made himself
the spokesman of a body which had
displayed “a treacherous disregard of
the highest national interests.”
Mr. PRINGLE was as much surprised
as if he had been bitten by a rabbit,
and wound up an unconvincing defence
of himself with the remark that he
would rather keep silence than say
anything to exacerbate feeling. It is a
pity that his friend Mr. Hogge did not
imitate this wise if rather tardy reti-
cence. He gave Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
the lie when he was describing how
the disputes had interfered with the
supply of guns urgently needed by the
Army, and provoked the retort that,
instead of encouraging the strikers by
unfounded suggestions, he would be
better employed if “with what credit
is left to him " he went down to tho
Clyde and tried to get them to work.

A LETTER TO THE FRONT.
“KIN yer write a letter?”
“More or less,” I said. I did not
rate myself with Madame DE STAEL nor
with Edward FitzGERALD, but I fore-
bore to mention these names because
I thought that they would not be
familiar to my questioner. If you hap-
pen to know Paradise Rents, Fulham,
you will realise that neither Madame
DE STAñL nor FitzGERALD is much
read there. . Moreover, the type that
addressed me had not the aspect of a
literary man.
He was a man of some seven years,
maybe, in company with a younger
man, perhaps of five. He was hatless,
coatless, waistcoatless, but he had a pair
of trousers, short in the leg, precari-
He nodded his head vehemently.
“Well,” I began, “it rather depends,
you know, on what there is to say.” I
saw dissatisfaction cloud his face, and
hastened to add, “Oh, well, about ten
minutes.”
At that his expression cleared to
astonishment. Passing that emotion,
it went to incredulity. It was a beau-
tifully legible face, though everything
but clean. He made up his mind.
“Will yer come,” he asked, “and
write a letter for my granmother 2"
We were on the heels of adventure
now ; no one could say what new
country this might lead to.

is the fashion in Paradise
Rents. I had come upon these
two young men about Fulham
as they were staring with ab-
sorbed interest into the under-
taker's shop advantageously
corner of the Rents and the º
main street. Certainly it was
a pleasant window. Besides
the legends and texts, the arti-
ficial wreaths and the pictures
of tombs and tombstones, there
was a number of model coffins
in miniature. It was these
that had fascinated the atten-
tion of the two young men.
“I should like one o' them
to ply with,” said the elder
covetously.
“What would yer do with
it, Bill?” the younger asked.
“I'd put the old KAYSER in it, along
wi' Farver.”
It is rude to laugh at other people's
conversation, particularly if you have
not been introduced to them, but I
caught myself in an audible chuckle
over this fine blend of patriotic and
filial sentiment. Then I pulled myself
up, but not in time; I had been
detected.
If you wish to know what it is to be
stared at, you should interrupt, as I
had, a conversation between two
young men of about this age in
Fulham or elsewhere. They stared in
unison and in silence until the tension
became unbearable, and one of them,
the elder, whose name was Bill, relieved
it with the above quest on, “Kin yer
write a letter 2 ''
Perhaps my answer was a little
modest. He regarded me doubtfully,
then asked—
“'Ow soon kin yer write a letter?”

“Oh,” I said, scribbling briskly, “am
I to write all that?” It occupied, even
with much compression, space far into
the second side of the restricted paper.
“An' my only relative surviving,”
she resumed, “being brother George,

I hardly knew what answer to make
after the “cut everlasting" with which
George had threatened his sister, but
I had an idea that I was beginning to
understand Mrs. Watt's tastes. “Well,"
I said weakly, “I don't know—funerals
are very pleasant things.”
It was the right note and Mrs. Watt
took it up keenly. “That's what I

AT THE PLAY.
“STAND AND I)ELIVER,”
THE Merry Monarch's world is too
much with us. I can't imagine what
it is in that period that our actor-
managers find so peculiarly appropriate
to present conditions, when we need all
the inspiration we can get out of our
country's annals. It seems only the
other day that in the same theatre,
His Majesty's—the play was Mavour-
meen—I was assisting at a rout (is
that the word?) of Restoration society.
And here we have it all over again
with the same scheme of a pretty débu-
tante near to being compromised by
the Royal favour; with the old galaxy
| of Court ladies inexplicably gay; the
same old Duke of BUCKINGHAM ; the
old dull sport of improvisations; the
old pathetic lack of wit; a réchauffé
only tempered by slight variations,
such as the substitution of LELY for
PEPYs, and the failure of the Monarch
himself to put in an appearance.
For the rest, a generous allowance
of swashbuckling, of kidnapping, of
standing and delivering, of interludes
for dancing and gallantry—in a word
all the approved features of the High
Toby. Nothing, you will guess, that
threatened to overstrain our intelli-
gence, but enough for the moderate
excitation of those sympathies which
we always concede to heroic villainy.
The clou of the evening was the
scene of the waylaying of his lover's
coach by Claude Duval on the New-
market road. Animals on the stage (as
distinct from the circus-ring) always
make me nervous. Mr. Bou RCHIER
seemed to have anticipated my appre-
hension. On the approach of the
travellers, having hitherto, with his
horse's consent, sat motionless at the
cross-roads, he retired with it into the
wings and there dismounted and con-
tinued the scene on foot. But the
memory of those few moments of
superb equitation remained with the
audience, and when, at the fall of the
curtain, he led his steed forward by the
bridle (a just tribute to its connivance)
the pair of them brought down the
house—and not the scenery, as I had
feared.
I am no pedant that I should cavil
at Mr. JUSTIN HuxTLY McCARTHY's re-
adjustment of history. It was all for
our delight that Claude Duval, instead
of perishing on the scaffold, should
escape from prison, have his freedom
confirmed by the KING's pardon, con-
found everybody else's knavish tricks
and marry the lady of his heart. Nor
do I complain that the historic high-
wayman (as I am credibly informed—
for I got the facts from another critic)
was only twenty-nine when they hanged
him, and that Mr. Bourch IER is—
well, let me say, past the military age,
or he wouldn't have been there at all.
At the same time he will not mind my
saying that, though he brought a very
gallant spirit to his work, he lacked
something of that resilience which is
so desirable a quality in a Chevalier of
the Road. Perhaps I liked best in
him the quiet restraint with which he
met the assaults of Orange Moll upon
his loyalty to his lady. He was not
given very many good things to say, but
he made up for this defect by dropping
his aspirates and talking in what I
took to be a Serbian accent.

Berinthia ; but she seemed to have
learned a little more sincerity and to
depend less upon the prettiness of her
face and her frocks. Of Miss MIRIAM
LEWEs as Orange Moll something
more was demanded, and I should have
enjoyed without reservation her very
picturesque performance but for a
certain stage - quality in her voice
which was out of all consonance with
the part she had to play. Mr JERRoDD
RobertsHAw as Justice Hogben was
a most attractive old reprobate; Mr.
CHARLEs Rock as a strolling mummer
played like the sound actor he is; and
indeed the whole cast—and not least
in the smallest parts, such as Mr.
HARTFoRD's drunken Gaoler and Mr.
PEAse's Dognose, with his delightfully
unemotional “Ay! ay!” – did very
well indeed.
If the play opens rather deliberately
there is no lack of action when once it
gets moving; but it was an exercise of
bodies rather than of minds. Swords
flashed ; barkers were flourished
(though they never went off); feet
twinkled in the dance, and Mr. MURRAY
CARRINGTON took several astounding
falls; but wits remained stationary. I
do not wish to appear exigent, but as
one who likes to be amused as well as
entertained I could easily have done
with a little more scintillation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A LITERATURE of Antarcticana is gradually growing up,
and the last volume, With Scott : The Silver Lining (SMITH,
ELDER), is a notable addition to it. Let me say at once
that I opened Mr. GRIFFITH TAYLoR's book with some
trembling because I saw the difficulties in the way of its
success. In the first place I recalled the simple dignity with
which Scott wrote of his exploits, and I felt that to fall
away from this high standard would be to fail; secondly,
anyone writing now of this expedition must to a certain
extent travel over ground already covered. These are the
main difficulties which Mr. TAYLOR had to fight against,
and he has overcome them. To a writer of his fluency and
particular vein of humour it could not have been an easy
task to put a right restraint upon his pen. The only
criticism I have to pass on his style is that it could quite
comfortably have done with- T - - - -
out the cloud of notes of
exclamation in which it is
enveloped. Apart from its
great scientific value the
main interest of the book
is found in the light that it
casts upon the characters of
the author's companions.
His observation is always
shrewd and always kindly;
you are left to guess his
dislikes from his omissions.
Mr. TAYLOR was himself in
command, during Sco'IT's
last expedition, of two par-
ties, and of the work done
on these journeys he writes
with the modesty charac-
teristic of men who speak
of dangers and adventures
in which they have per-
sonally taken part. One
opinion of his I cannot re-
frain from quoting; it is
that the tragedy of Scott's
expedition was caused by
Seaman Ev.ANs's illness.
“I believe that, short of
abandonment, the party had
no hope with a sick man on their hands.” No tale of
heroism that the War has given us can obscure the noble
loyalty of this sacrifice. And to-day, when some of us
have neither the time nor the taste for lighter things, there
should be a grateful welcome for a book that deals with
men whose courage and endurance remain the imperishable
possession of our race.

supposed Mr. E. goes to a station to buy an evening paper,
is fallen upon by the real one, and thrust into a train to
attend the deathbed of his ducal relative. Essendine him-
self, entering the hotel to explain matters to the lady, finds
(1) that she is the wife who divorced him before marrying
Greville; (2) that she has just died of heart disease. Next,
being of a placidity aimost inhuman, he decides to bury the
corpse as that of his wife, and not worry anyone with
explanations. What he didn't know then, or I either,
was that another lady was at the moment gadding about
London in one of Mrs. Greville's cast-off frocks, and pre-
tending to be that much-married female. And when in
due course she is murdered, and the strangely apathetic
widower, Mr. Greville, who never set eyes upon her, is
arrested for the crime—well, you may begin to think that
the judge's remark was an understatement. What I should
like to ask Mr. J. W. BRODIE-INNEs is, if this is his notion
of an “indiscretion,” what would he have to say of a real

had made her the joint ward of two young men, one an
Italian prince, and one a semi-insane Welshman. Cherry
accepted this provision with a promising placidity. She, and
I, anticipated marriage with one or other of the guardians.
But that was before we had seen them. The Italian turned
out to be silly, while the Welshman recalled the gloomier
imaginings of the BRoNTÉs, and in the event came by an
appropriately violent end. However there was a third

ANOTHER SCRAP OF PAPER.
I Look all right, and I feel all right, but the doctor said
the Army was no place for me. IIaving given me a piece
of paper which said so, he looked over my head and called
out, “Next, please.” It was with this document I was
going to produce a delicious thrill—what I might call an
“electric" moment. I carefully rehearsed what should
happen, though I was not quite sure what attitude to adopt
—whether to give the impression that I was a member of a
pacific society, look elaborately unconcerned or truculently
youthful. This, I decided, had better be left to the psycho-
logical moment.
I would take my seat or strap in the crowded tram or
train. Observing that I wore neither khaki nor armlet
someone would want to know why “a big, strong, healthy-
looking fellow like you was not in the Army.” I should
then try to look pacific or elaborately—see above again.
But I should say nothing. My studied silence would annoy
everybody. I was quite sure of this, because I really can
do that sort of silence very well. The inevitable old woman
with a bundle would ſix me with her watery eye. “The
man in the street,” who, of course, would now be in the
tram or train, would give a brief history of his three sons
and one brother-in-law at the Front. The armleted con-
ductor (we are now in the tram) would give my ticket a
very rude punch and my penny a vcry angry stare. When
I was quite sure I had been set down as a slacker, I should

one brother-in-law had evidently been writing for more
cigarettes. I would then say, “I know you can talk. It
is possible you can read. Would you be good enough to

handed back to me. I would fold it carefully and place it
in my inside pocket. Looking very tenderly at the long row
of rebuked countenances, I should get up and make for the
door. This would be the delicious thrill, the electric moment.

tense strain that first might, my men
standing to arms through the long
hours, with their rifles pointing into
the darkness beyond. But not a shot
was fired, and when dawn broke all
was well. True, the first light revealed
the fact that I had got us all with our
backs to the enemy, so that if there
had been a battle it would have been
between ourselves and Mr. Jones's pla-

and sense of direction never was my

it. We were informed that, as far as
we were concerned, the War stood

we stood in the street trying to think

From the words of RoHERT WALLACE,
Who's a scientific Edinboro' don.
Cats as lissome merry minxes,
Or impenetrable Sphinxes—
Leonine, aloof, impassive, topaz-
eyed—
Leave our staid professor chilly,
For he clearly thinks it silly
To regard them from the decorative
side.
It is not their grace, now serious,
Now malicious, now mysterious,
That appeals to his utilitarian mind;
But, when viewed as extirpators
Of disease-disseminators,
Then he looks with admiration on
their kind.
For if cats should ever shun us
Rats with plague would overrun us,
And they're bad enough on economic
grounds;
For their annual depredation
On the food-stuffs of the nation
He would estimate at twenty million
pounds.
True, O Puss, romance is lacking
In your latest champion's backing,
But at least he isn't talking through
his hat;
And if, after all, what matters
Is to have “superior ratters"—
Well, he pays the highest homage
to the Cat.
HEROISM.
THERE are heroes and heroes. All
heroes are heroes: that is certain. But
there are some heroes whose heroism
involves more thought (shall I say?),
more material, than that of others, who
are heroic in a kind of rush, without
any premeditation—heroic by instinct.
Now it seems to me that the rewards
of the more complex heroes ought—
but let me illustrate.
I have a friend who is a hero. The
other day in France he did one of the
most desperate things, and did it ap-
parently as a matter of course; and he
is to have the V.C. for it. But is the
W.C. enough 2 If it's enough for the
instinctive heroes, is it enough for him 2
That is my question. The secret his-
tory of his deed is known only to me
and to himself, and when I give you
an idea of it you will be able to answer.
I will tell you. -
Never mind what the deed was. All
I will say is that it is comparable to
the glorious feat of Lieutenant WARNE-
Ford, who bombed the Zeppelin from
above and sent it crashing down. My
friend is an aviator too, and since I am
not allowed to describe his great per-
formance in detail let us pretend that
it was an exact replica of the WARNE-
Ford triumph. Armed with his bombs
he saw the approaching Zepp and flew
high, six or seven thousand feet, to get
above it. So far he had merely obeyed
the dictates of his brave impulsive
nature. He had given no thought to
the chances of danger or death, but
had flown direct to his duty. So far
he was instinctive. But my friend,
as well as being unusually brave, is
a singularly retiring kind of man. He
hates publicity, ostentation. Very shy
and very quiet, he moves about the
world unperceived, and has all the
reluctances of the anchorite.
but his deep feeling about the War
could have got him to do anything as
prominent as aviation, so that it is not
unnatural that, as he mounted higher
and higher and came nearer and nearer
to the desired point over the Zepp,
he should suddenly realise what it
would mean for him if he succeeded
in bringing it down.
Not that he had too much time for
such reflections, for until the envelope
intervened between him and the Zepp's
marksmen he was being blazed at
steadily. Bullets whistled about him.
But one thinks swiftly, and in a flash
he saw the extremely distasteful conse-
quences to humility, and the dislocation
of his secluded way of life if, dropping
his bombs accurately, he earned (as he
was bound to do) the Victoria Cross.
All this he saw, and was properly
furious at his bad luck—at the trick
that destiny had played on him. He
then dropped the bombs, the envelope
ignited, and the Zepp, with its crew
and its deadly cargo, fell to earth and
was blown to atoms. . -
Now my point is that for such a
hero as my friend, whose whole soul is
to be outraged by publicity and réclame,
and much of whose dearly loved privacy
is to be lost for ever, there ought to be
a W.C. above and beyond the ordinary
W.C.—a super V.C.; for he performed
not one deed, but two: he not only
destroyed the Zepp but he surrendered
his sanctuary. -

“The German people fully recognises the

The Allies are confident that it will
receive further recognition before long.
In an article entitled “The Superiority

“The road before us is, however, long and
calls for great achievements. We are not

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, April 4th.--When intro-
ducing a Budget designed to raise a
revenue of seventy or eighty millions,
fronted with the task of
raising over five hundred
millions, polished off the
job in exactly seventy-five
minutes. Mr. GLADSTONE
used to consider it neces-
sary to prepare the way
for each new impost by
an elaborate argument.
That was all very well in
peace-time. But we are
at war, when more than
ever time is money, and
so Mr. McKENNA was con-
tent to rely upon the im-
perative formula of the
gentlemen of the road,
“Stand and deliver.”
For a moment, it is true,
he reverted to the old tra-
ditions of Budget-night.

Not much criticism was however to

Ireland ought to be omitted from the

Mr. TIMOTHY HEALY, whose principal
complaint was that the tax on railway
tickets would put a pre-
mium on foreign travel.
People would go to Paris
instead of Dublin, and
Switzerland instead of

body tactlessly reminded
him that a war was going

For fifteen years he has
been trying to convince
the British Government
that there is an institu-

They were quickly disillusionised.

super-tax) close on half their incomes;
the comparatively well-to-do a fourth ;

such pathetic allusion will have to pay
an additional sixpence in the pound.
If in the circumstances some of them
feel inclined to echo Sir Peter Teazle's
remark to Joseph, “Oh, damn your
sentiment,” I think they may be
excused.
That, however, was Mr. McKENNA's
only lapse. The rest of his speech was
ruthlessly and refreshingly practical.
The millions were ticked off as rapidly,
and almost as mechanically, as the
two-pences in the other taxis. Five
millions from cinemas, horse-races, and
other amusements, three from railway

the suggestion that the public offices
should be similarly adorned the Govern-
ment, under the erroneous belief that
patriotism and militarism were iden-
tical, has hitherto maintained an un-
flagging opposition. But to-day Lord
REWE admitted that the proposal
was reasonable.
Sir GEorge REID has made the
surprising discovery that there are a
number of excellent speakers in the
House of Commons who do not speak,
but concentrate themselves upon the
despatch of business. Perhaps this
was his genial way of indicating the
more obvious fact that there are others
of a precisely opposite kind. He him-
self is an excellent speaker who speaks;
|but concentration is perhaps hardly
his strongest point, and he wandered
to-day over so many fields that the
CHAIRMAN had more than once, with
obvious regret, to recall him to the
strict path of the Finance Bill, which
ultimately passed its first reading,
amid cheers that it would have done
the KAISER good to hear.
Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING, having
been prevented by the Budget from
making his usual Tuesday speech,
delivered it to-day, and had a success
which was, I trust, as gratifying to
him as it was surprising to the House.

AT THE PLAY.
“DISRAELI.”
OUR early-Victorian oligarchs dis-
dained their DISRAELI as a mountebank
because he wore the wrong waistcoats
and had genius instead of common-
sense. If he had grown to be the least
like Mr. Louis NAPoleoN PARKER's
Disraeli, if he had taken to standing
over Governors of the Bank of England
and forcing them to sign documents
under threat of smashing up their
silly old bank, if he had been such a
judge of men as to have made that
prize ass, Lord Deeford, his secretary,
or conducted his ménage at Downing
Street in the highly diverting manner
exhibited in Mr. PARKER's second
Act, one trembles to think what
they would have called him—and
done to him. And whether, if
the Bank had ever had such a
Governor as Sir Michael Probert,
England would have ever been in
a position to buy a single share
in the Suez Canal or any other
and to lay booby traps, into which
not his enemies but his incomparable
secretary promptly blundered—it was
then that things went crooked.
It is perhaps not to be regretted.
Nothing is more diverting to the per-
ceptive playgoer than these little
dramatic simplicities; as when, the
great Suez deal having been completed
—a fact that it was enormously im-
portant to conceal from the Press and
the country (and the adventuress)—
a telegram with full details in the
plainest of plain English is despatched
from the local post-office to the great
financier who had made the deal
possible. The charming naïveté of the
family gathering at the Foreign Office
venture, is a question for the ///#
curious to consider. -
No wonder the Americans \\
enjoyed Disraeli / REINHARDt
should pirate it for Berlin, as it
would lend some colour to the
imaginative Dr. HELLFERICH's
airy dissertations on English
finance. Can it be that our au-
thor is a hyphenated patriot in
disguise and that this is merely
a ramification of the so thorough
German Press Bureau's activities?
Perish the thought !
At the opening of the play,
with Mr. Disraeli and his wife
as guests at Glastonbury Towers,
all went well. The almost un-
canny lifelikeness of Mr. DENNIs
EADIE's make-up, the steady flow of
the great man's good things, which
had been discerningly culled and quite
skilfully put together, his swift parries
and kindly thrusts, his charming ten-
derness towards that best of wives,
the shining heroine of the crushed
thumb, all this was admirable, was

and the adorable ingenuousness of the
ideº of bringing down a great inter-
national financier by holding up his
cargo of bullion in a foreign port,
should lead no one to complain that
high politics are dull.
I wouldn't have missed Mr. DENNIs
imaginary portrait. It was beautiful
and convincing. As a stage adven-
turess Mlle. DoRziAT was most attrac-
tive, if only she had been credible. She
had no business to be in any of the situ-
ations in which she found herself, and
must have needed all her skill to con-
ceal the fact from herself. Miss MARY
GLYNNE as The Lady Clarissa, the por-
tentous Duchess of Glastonbury's pretty
daughter and the doomed bride of the
egregious Deeford, was quite charming
to watch and hear. Mr. CYRIL RAY-
Mond should, I am sure, mitigate the
asinine priggishness of the young vis-
count's bearing in the First Act. His
conversion from this to the merely crass
stupidity of the second was too much
for us to bear. Mr. VINCENT
STERNRoyd as Mr. Hugh Meyers
looked quite as if he might have
been able to put his hand on
two million; Mr. HARBEN as Sir
Michael Probert just as if he
would sign any document which
was put before him under threat
or suggestion. Mr. CAMPBELL
GULLAN, as the adventuress's hus-
band, made himself the kind of
clerk that no one would have
trusted for a moment with even
the petty cash. These things I
know are necessary and I acquit
him of any artistic impropriety.
But you will go to see this piece
chiefly for the sake of Mr. EADIE's
tour de force, for the thrill of the
rather pleasant sensation (mingled
with a slightly horrified suspicion
of sacrilege) of seeing a queer
resurrection, and for the fragrance
of a touching little idyll of mar-
ried friendship—one of the most
enduring of Disraeliana. T.
A Special Matinée, at which the
QUEEN will be present, is to be given

“CONKY'S ’’ UNCLE.
THERE are some men whose patro-
nymics are swallowed up in their
nicknames, and my friend “Conky" is
surname of his own, but
counted. For the rest he is the pos-
sessor of a big booming bass voice,
which he uses with more gusto than
art. He is, apart from a certain pride
in his musical accomplishments, a very
good fellow; and so is Mrs. “Conky"—
an amiable and agreeable woman, whose
only fault is an excessive anxiety for
the comfort of her guests, leading her
at times to forget, in the words of the
Chinese proverb, that “inattention is
often the highest form of civility.”
They are a devoted couple, and the
only cloud on their happiness was
caused by Conky's expectations from
a mysterious and eccentric uncle. For
a long time I was inclined to disbelieve
in his existence, as he never “material-
ised.” But I was converted from my
scepticism, some three years ago, when,
on meeting Conky, I was informed that
Uncle Joseph had invited himself on
one of these. He has quite a decorative
it never
a short visit. My friend betrayed a
certain agitation. “You know,” he said,
“it is twenty years since I saw him
last, when he came to look me up at
school, and rather frightened me.”
“Frightened you! But how 2"
“Well, you see, he's got a way of
thinking aloud, and it 's lather em-
barrassing: I don't mind being called
Conky,' as you know, but it was
rather trying to hear him say, ‘I hope
his nose has stopped growing." How-
ever, I couldn't very well put him
off now. I'm his only nephew ; he's
an old man, and said to be very
rich.” Conky sighed, but added more
hopefully, “Anyhow, I'm sure Marjorie
will rise to the occasion.” Personally
I was by no means so sure. I felt
that Marjorie might overdo it: also
that Conky, who loved the sound of
his voice, might be tempted to soothe
the old man with intempestive gusts
of song.
Unhappily my misgivings were real-
ised. A few weeks later, on my way
home from the club, I called in late one
aſternoon ºn the Conkys. They greeted
me cordially as usual, but I could see be said.
something was amiss, and soon it all
came out. The visit had been a fiasco.
Uncle Joseph had been very friendly and
even courteous, but at intervals he
thought aloud with devastating frank-
ness. Marjorie had exhausted herself
in the labours of hospitality, but all in
vain. Conky had sung, but the voice
of the charmer had failed. And just as
Uncle Joseph was going he observed
in a final burst of candour, “Goo-ood
people, very goo-ood people ; but she's
a second-rate Martha, and he sings
like a bank-holiday trombone-player on
Blackpool sands.”
From that day till a week ago I
never heard Conky or his wife allude
to Uncle Joseph. The memory was too
painful. And yet it is impossible to
deny that the experience was salutary.
Marjorie is certainly less overwhelming
in her hospitality, and Conky less
prodigal of song. And when Conky told
me last week that Uncle Joseph had
died and leſt him £10,000, I felt that
the old man had atoned handsomely for
his unconscious indulgence in a habit

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXXVII.
(From Dr. LiebkNEcht.)
IF such trifling matters as the meeting of the Reichstag
now occupy any portion of your Majesty's attention, it
may please you to learn that my membership of that
august body has been temporarily suspended. At the same
time I should be sorry that your Majesty should labour under
any misapprehension as to what happened. No doubt I
was forbidden to speak, though I am the representative of
people whose voices have a right to be heard even in the
unhappy Parliament which is all that the German Empire
is allowed to provide for the subjects of the German
KAISER. But I wish you to understand that I was not
silenced before I had said aloud nearly everything that
I had in my mind to say. It is true that I did not make
any formal speech. The bellowing blockheads who now
arrogate to themselves the name of patriots and all the
virtues of patriotism were easily able to prevent me from
doing this, and I was forced, therefore, to confine myself to
short and sharp interjections thrown in at appropriate
moments while BETH MANN-Hollweg, that arch-impostor,
was proving to the whole world that even if Germany
had a good case he is the last man who would be able to
place it in a convincing manner before the judgment of
the world.
Your Majesty has had a long practice in the use of words.
You pride yourself on the glorious and beneficial effect of
such speeches as that in which you condescendingly praised
the Almighty for having allied Himself with you, very
much, as it appeared, to His own advantage, or that other
speech in which you announced to your conscripts their
duty to shoot down their parents if in some momentary
whim you ordered them to do it, or even that other brave
and Imperial harangue in which you declared your humane
and merciful designs on the Chinese people. I have no
doubt, then, that if you could be induced to speak your
opinion fairly and openly you would admit that, though you
yourself could, of course, have done better, I did not do so
very badly in my little bout with poor BETHMANN. At any
rate I spoke the truth, which is an inconvenient course of
conduct, and made BETHMANN look the fool that everybody
(except, perhaps, your Majesty) knows him to be.
Indeed, your Majesty, a fool who is also arrogant is a
very terrible thing. When BETHMANN, for instance, spoke
of Germany's love for her neighbours, and in particular for
the small nations, he delivered himself into my hands. All
I had to do—and I did it—was to remind him that he
proved his love by jumping upon them and strangling
them. In a moment the whole fabric of his stupid argu-
ment was shattered and he was left gaping open-mouthed
and without an answer before the whole world. The
incident showed the man's mind and his disposition in a
lightning flash, and from all countries, even from wretched
Belgium and from ruined Serbia, there came a laugh of
hatred and contempt. Why are we so hated 2 Not because
we are great and powerful and prosperous, but because we
make our greatness an incubus, our power a tyranny and
our prosperity an offence.
Fools like BETHMANN do not see this. They and their
fellow-fools, some of them quite brilliant men, with high
notions on literature and music and the drama, are for ever
in a state of jealous fear. They have the mania of persecu-
tion and imagine that all other countries are leagued against
them for the purpose of wiping Germany off the map. Then
they lose their unfortunate heads and strike out blindly to
right and left. The other nations have no course open to
them except to defend themselves as best they may, and
then Herr BETHMANN and his superior fools shout out that
this wicked defensive proves up to the hilt that when they
spoke of conspiracies they were fully justified and that
Germany for her own safety must smash and in the end
control every other country under the sun. -
And yet, your Majesty, the time will come when we
must have peace. This pouring out of blood, this tremendous
waste of money and lives must some day have an end.
Those are the best patriots who would put a stop to it as
soon as possible, for the longer you defer peace the more
difficult it becomes to make it. We have been told of
great victories, but they profit us not at all. All is desola-
tion and cruelty and confusion. And those who think most
of Germany know best how bitterly she needs peace.
Your truth-telling but suspended subject,

SAINT GEORGE OF ENGLAND.
His Day, April 23rd.
SAINT GEORGE he was a fighting man, as all the tales do tell;
He fought a battle long ago, and fought it wondrous well;
With his helmet and his hauberk and his good cross-hilted
sword,
Oh, he rode a-slaying Dragons to the glory of the Lord.
And when his time on earth was done he found he could
not rest
Where the year is always Summer in the Islands of the Blest,
So back he came to earth again to see what he could do,
And they cradled him in England—
In England, April England—
Oh, they cradled him in England where the golden willows
blew
SAINT GEORGE he was a fighting man and loved a fighting
breed, - -
And whenever England wants him now he's ready to her
need;
From Crecy field to Neuve Chapelle, he's there with hand
and sword,
And he sailed with DRAKE from Devon to the glory of the
Lord.
His arm is strong to smite the wrong and break the tyrant's
pride;
He was there when NELSON triumphed, he was there when
GoRDON died ; -
He sees his Red-Cross ensign float on all the winds that
blow,
But ah! his heart's in England—
In England, April England—
His heart it dreams of England where the golden willows
grow.
SAINT GEORGE he was a fighting man; he's here and
fighting still,
While any wrong is yet to right or Dragon yet to kill;
And faith ! he's finding work this day to suit his war-worn
sword,
For he's strafing Huns in Flanders to the glory of the Lord!
SAINT GEORGE he is a fighting man, but, when the fighting's
past, -
And dead amid the trampled fields the fiercest and the last
Of all the Dragons earth has known beneath his feet lies low,
Ah, his heart will turn to England—
To England, April England— -
He'll come home to rest in England where the golden
willows blow.

“Times be changin' fast; nigh time

“I did think as our lads was doin'

“Be it too much to ask ye, then,

THE ROLLING STONE.
At Cambridge, where on field or flood -
He shone like a GoLDIE or a STUDD,
He was an intellectual “blood.”
He made the grimmest dons unbend,
And missed his First, right at the end,
For he cut his Tripos—to nurse a friend.
Then he wrote a novel. The weekly
press -
Declared it was worthy of R.L.S.;
But it wasn't a great financial success. |
So, after a spell at the Bar, he flew
To the rubber-fields in remote Peru,
But stayed there only a month or two.
For he suddenly conceived a plan
Of studying music at Milan,
Where he sang in the style of the great
god Pan.
I heard him sing in the Albert Hall
In the chorus of MENDELssohn's
St. Paul,
And his voice was the loudest of them
all.
Next he leased a Colorado mine,
And dealt in Californian wine,
And rented a ranche in the Argentine.
But whatever the job and whatever
the pay
I certainly never knew him to stay
Anywhere as long as a year and a
day— -
Except one job, which is not yet done,
Though twenty months ago begun,
Of holding and hammering the Hun.
His horoscope I have never scanned,
But as long as there's any fighting on
hand
The rolling stone has come to a stand.
Irreplaceable.

candid objector:—
“I am sure the Rector could not get anyone
to take my place, as Cowley is now empty, and
there are no loafers about.”

“The first cases to come before the tribunal
were appeals from three Thirsk butchers, for
the exemption of their respective slaughter-
men. Mr. Johnson said he killed himself
about 20 years ago. He thought he would
start again.”—Darlington and Stockton Times.
Very difficult to repeat the first fine
careless rapture of a successful suicide.
“No, while it is a crime to spend money
extravagantly on dress, it is just as emphatic-
ally one to abstain from it altogether.”

the moving of the writ for the
Wimbledon Division. The
House is pleased that Mr.
HENRY CHAPLIN's long services
to the State should have re-
ceived the customary reward
of a peerage, but it will miss
his genial and majestic pres-
ence. Though an unfortunate
accident in 1906 (a year pro-
lific in electoral casualties) de-
barred him from becoming the
titular Father of the House,
his venerable appearance, his
courtly and old-world bearing,
and his full-bodied eloquence
gave him an uncontested
claim to be regarded as its
| Grandfather. Lord CLAUD
HAMILTON, the only other sur-
vivor of the Parliament of
1868, will now feel very lonely.
The best things said at
a public meeting are often
uttered by an anonymous
“Voice.” Mr. WILL THORNE
is the “Voice” of the House
of Commons. Endowed with
a fine pair of lungs and a style
of delivery that resembles the
cork coming out of a ginger-
beer bottle he frequently ex-
presses in his explosive style

On the Second Reading of the Budget
Mr. THoMAs O'Connor, as the SPEAKER
punctiliously calls him, led off with a
vigorous attack upon the match-tax.
The discovery, made many years ago,
that match-making as then conducted
caused a painful disease of the jaw first
aroused T.P.'s sympathetic interest.
He now displayed an intimate acquaint-
ance with the details of the industry
and discoursed learnedly on the short-
age of muriate of potash for the heads
and of aspen for the splints. His argu-
ment briefly amounted to this—that
the manufacturers of matches, like those
of mustard, depended for their profits
upon the amount wasted, and that to
check public extravagance would de-
stroy the trade.

Tuesday, April 11th.-One
of the French Deputies visit-
ing Westminster thinks us a
queer people. He had heard
last night the PRIME MINIs-
TER's stout declaration of the
| Allies' resolve to bring Prus-
sia's military domination to
an end. Again this afternoon
he had been told on the same
high authority that the late
Conference in Paris had re-
affirmed the entire solidarity
of the Allies and established
the complete identity of their
views. Then he had walked
across the corridor to the
House of Lords, expecting, no
doubt, to hear the same senti-
ments expressed in even loftier
language. Instead, he had to
listen to Lord CourTNEY, in
the traditional yellow waist-
coat, declaiming with all the
vigour of his première jaunesse
against the notion that we
should enter into any fiscal
relations with our Allies that
might imperil the sacred prin-
ciples of Free Trade.
Lord Court.NEY believes that
there is in Germany a large
and powerful peace - party,
which must not be frightened
by any threats of reprisals,
and he commends to the Allies
in 1916 the example of BISMARCK in
letting the Austrians off easily in 1866.
Our visitor was a little relieved by the
explanation that the orator was an
interesting survival of a school of
thought now passed away, and repre-
sented no one but himself. But he was
again puzzled when Lord BRYCE, who
knows as much about the manners of
the gentle Hun as anybody (witness his
report on the atrocities in Belgium),
joined in the appeal that we should be
nice to Germany after the War.
He was, however, somewhat com-
forted when Lord CREWE made it
plain that the Government did not
share Lord Court.NEY's illusions about
the strength of the German peace-
party, and, having regard to the man-
ner in which Germany had in the past
combined commercial expansion with
political intrigue, could not hold out
hopes that after the War we should do
business with her in the same old easy-
going way. But if our French friend
is still not quite convinced that British

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NIGHT OUT WITH A ZEPPELIN.
BY KARI, von WEEKEND
(HYPHENATED NECTRAL).
PART I.
Somewhere in Germany,
April 1st, 1916.
I HAD just partaken of the frugal
breakfast to which I had been invited at
General Headquarters and was in the act
of helping my distinguished host, Feld-
marschall von und zu Grosskopf-Esel,
to remove some fragments of sauer-
kraut from his ears, when a superbly-
mounted orderly dashed up
and handed me a missive bear-
ing the significant superscrip-
tion, “General Staff.” I must
confess that to me the mes-
senger's manner seemed suffi-
ciently deferential. Not to my
friend the Major-General, who,
with a sudden and well-placed
kick in the stomach, sent the
unfortunate despatch - bearer
hurtling down the steps. It
was not for me to inquire what, ſº
the trouble was, and I mention | |&
the incident as one more illus-
tration of the iron discipline In
that has driven the gallant
troops of the Fatherland to
victory on all fronts. |
Imagine my gratification on
finding that the letter was an
invitation to inspect on the
following morning the latest
Zeppelin sheds at — and
to be a passenger on board one
of the new airships that wº
scheduled to pay a surprise
visit to the fortress of London
that same evening, weather
permitting.
Punctually at seven on the
following morning I found von
und zu Grosskopf-Esel waiting
for me in the huge twenty-
cylinder roadster which the General
Staff customarily places at the dis-
posal of American newspaper corre-
spondents. Within the hour we were
at , where I was turned over to
the good offices of Herr Ober-Leutnant
von Dachswurst, of the Imperial Fly.
ing Corps, who immediately conducted
me to the shed from which (when the
weather is propitious) the aerial mon-
sters depart upon their errands of
doom.
I had expected to see two, or at
most three, Zeppelins in the great
shed. Imagine my astonishment on
beholding no fewer than a hundred
huge engines of destruction tugging
impatiently at their moorings. I was
speechless. But the Ober-Leutnant
read my thoughts. “What would you
You !
IN FOR
'say," he asked, smiling drily, “if I were
to tell you that Germany to-day pos-
sesses no fewer than one hundred such
fleets of airships as you see before
you?” So overcome was I that I
scarcely had the strength to ask him
why, up to that time, attacks had
been usually carried out with two or
three ships only. He smiled still more
enigmatically. “You must not ask me
that,” he said, “ or at least you must
first ask the Grand Admiral why his
five hundred submersible battle cruisers
are still at anchor in Kiel Harbour, or
the General Staff why five million of

material losses have so far been con-
fined to three field guns left over from
the Franco-German War and five dozen
cases of collapsible sausage rolls?”
It was incredible, yet I could not but
accept the statement as true, and have
in fact had ample opportunity since of
verifying the assertions of the gallant
officer.
“But come,” he said ; “it is time we
were on board.”
The Zeppelins that were actually
selected to conduct the proposed opera-
tions were housed in another shed, and
thither we repaired. We were greeted
TT at the gangway by the famous
Captain Sigismund von Münch:
hausen, a gruff but hearty
old mariner, who immediately
escorted me into his cabin
and insisted on my enjoying a
cigar and a glass of schnapps
with him. Once again I was
struck with that almost Ori-
ental charm of manner which
seems to lift the German
Higher Command above the
* plane occupied by the rest of
the Occidental world.
It was no doubt my im-
patience that caused me to
interrupt the gallant Captain's
delightful flow of racy anec:
dote to ask when we should
start. My host smiled enigma-
|tically.” By now,” he aid,
| “we should be somewhere
| over the Dogger Bank.”
It was true. So perfectly
had all things been appointed
that while I had been consum-
|ing a single glass of schnapps
the huge airship had com-
pleted half the journey.
| We now emerged from the
|cabin. As we approached the
rail a sailor stepped up to the
| Captain, saluted and asked
permission to speak. As far

tion of the ten thousand billion marks
that lie in the Imperial treasury at
|Spandau Be patient,” he added. “Our
perfidious enemies will bite the dust
whenever it suits our glorious leaders
to say the word.” .
I muttered something about the
enormous German casualty lists. The
Ober-Leutnant smiled more enigmati-
cally than ever. “A ruse to deceive
our enemies,” he said. “Would it
surprise you to know that up to date
the total German losses on all fronts
amount to seventeen killed and ninety-
one wounded and missing, while our

as I could gather, the wretched man
complained of seasickness and asked
to be put ashore. There was no mis-
taking the Captain's answer. “Ja
wohl' " he roared, and with a mighty
kick sent the luckless seaman hurtling
over the rail and into the abyss below.
A momentary sense of pity seized me,
but it quickly occurred to me that only
by such drastic means could be kept
alive the splendid spirit of chivalry
that has made the German airman
victorious throughout the firmament.
It was now quite dark, but far
beneath us could be seen with the aid
of a telescope little points of light.
Perfidious England, the author of
all Germany's troubles, lay helpless
beneath us.

[APRIL 19, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN UNRECORDED ENGAGEMENT.
THE following interesting letter has
been forwarded to us by the relatives
of one of our wounded heroes. It gives
a vivid idea of his impressions during
a severe engagement, particulars of
which have not so far appeared in the
Press.
“Red Cross Hospital,
Somewhere in England.
“. . . And now I must tell you of a
very hot time that our lot here had
recently. The attack was due to open
at 5.30 in the afternoon. We had been
warned to expect it, and the appointed
hour found us ready in our positions.
We were five deep, strongly posted on
deck chairs; moreover, the warning
had given us opportunity to construct
a defensive rampart of evergreens and
pot-plants before the front line.
“The engagement opened fairly
punctually with a furious pianoforte
bombardment, accompanied by asphyxi-
ating footlights. Owing to the close-
ness of the range and the weight of
metal employed, our first rank gave
way a little, but subsequently rallied
smartly. The attack now became
general, the enemy advancing first in
detached units, subsequently in column
or quartette formation. A stuborn re-
sistance was put up, but we were
nearly forced to recoil before a desperate
charge by The Men of Harlech.
“Hardly had we contrived to with-
stand these, when, with blood-curdling
cries, the Funny Men dashed forward
and fell upon us. The engagement
was at this point so fierce that it was
impossible to obtain more than a con-
fused impression of it. I saw several of
my brave comrades doubled up. Puns
and lachrymatory wheezes darkened the
air. At last, after a specially violent
offensive, in which he was supported by
the full strength of his piano, the enemy
retired, followed by salvoes from our
ranks, and left us, at least temporarily,
masters of the situation.
“A lull ensued, during which, how-
ever, in spite of the curtain behind
which the enemy endeavoured to mask
his preparations, we were convinced,
from certain unmistakable signs, that
a fresh and possibly more violent attack
was shortly to develop. Nor was this
view wrong; for, when the curtain
lifted, we at once saw that our worst
fears were justified. Confronting us
were the 1st Amateur Thespians, the
most dreaded battalion in the enemy's
Volunteer forces, and one reputed to
have decimated more British classics
than any two professional regiments.
“The methods of this body have
changed very little during the last
half-century. They still employ for
choice the old Bor-and-Cor attack,
which has proved so effective in the
past, followed frequently by A Case for
Eviction or else Gentlemen Boarders.
Bold to the point of rashness, no diffi-
culties are found to daunt them ; and
the stoutest hearts might well quail
at being exposed to the fury of their
onslaught. Indeed how any of us sur-
vived the half-hour that followed I
hardly know. It was a nightmare of
smashed china, dropped cups, shouts
of ‘Bouncer, Bouncer' and general
confusion.
“But time was on our side; and
when, towards seven o'clock, the cur-
tain fell again, we knew that, holding
as we did almost our original positions,
we were victorious. Our exact casualties
I have not yet heard, but they are
certain to have been heavy. The
ground lately held by the enemy pre-
sented a spectacle of appalling con-
fusion; and everything pointed to the
struggle having been most determined.
Restoratives were administered to our
men, and we turned in, exhausted but
happy."

DEAR SIR (or MADAM), -Looking

the past twelve months as you used
to be; and the more we looked at that
record the more we wondered what we
had done that caused you to practically
stop dealing with us.
Finally we decided to drop you a
line and ask you whether you will kindly
tell us, personally, frankly, whether
there is anything we have not done
that we should have done.
Unfortunately accidents will happen
at times, and if one has happened in
this case we hope you will tell us

DEAR SIRs, I regret to say there
is a reason for discontinuing my seed
order, and I am pleased to hear you
will do your best to make the trouble
good; but I am half afraid you will not
be able to “put it right the day you
get my letter.”
The fact is there is a lăuropean War
going on just now, and it has sadly
upset our gardening plans. Instead
of having eight men (counting a hus-
band) about the place, I am now
reduced to one gardener, and he will
shortly be called up in a married

ously cultivating softens the heart of

I am sorry I have no time to tell
you more about this War, but I must
now go and dig the vegetables.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Miss Pandora (HEINEMANN) is proclaimed by its publishers
to be a first novel. Probably, however, it will not also be
a last, as the author, M. E. NorMAN, has a considerable
gift for tale-telling. Perhaps I may be permitted to hope
that he (or she) will use it next time to illuminate a rather
| more attractive set of characters. I don't think that the
circle in which Pandora moved contains a single person
whom I should wish to meet twice. There was Pandora
herself, who was dark and Spanish-looking, with an origin
wrapped in mild mystery. There was her friend, a futile
lady-novelist; there were three quite disagreeable men, a
spoilt child and an old lady suffering from senile dementia.
Oh, and I nearly forgot the sniffy neighbour, who, having
cut Pandora dead for half the book, was revealed in the
second half as her mother. Add to this that Pandora had
a past (and a present too, for that matter) with the husband
of the lady novelist, and you will, I think, agree with me
that they were a queer lot. Also I have seldom read a novel
with such an unsatis- - -
factory ending. It almost
seemed as though M. E.
NoRMAN, having got the - -
affair into a tangle, was
too bored to unravel it.
I am by no means sure, "s:
for example, that he (or "Tºº!

about Pandora's paternity
than I have. The de:
pressing conclusionis that,' '
while I readily admit that .
the writing of it shows "º
originality and promise,
Miss Pandora is hardly the
novel I should have ex-
pected to be produced in
a paper famine.

Before I began to un-
weave The Web of Fºn.
lein (HopDER AND STough-
ToN) a dreadful and, as it turned out, an unnecessary
fear seized me that Miss KATHARINE TYNAN had written
a spy-novel of the present day. Imagine then my relief
when I found that the story dates back some thirty or
forty years, and that, although Fräulein was really as
pestilential a woman as ever became governess to a respect-
able British family, espionage was not part of her game.
With uncanny skill Miss TYNAN relates the influence that
this flat-footed German woman gained in the Allanson
household; but I must protest, in justice to our race, that
we have not many families so lacking in enterprise as to
allow themselves to be enmeshed in such a web as this.
In short I can dislike this German product very cordially
but without for a moment understanding the source of the
devastating power she had over others. You must not,
however, imagine that the web casts a gloom over the
whole book, for when Fräulein is not on the scene—and
we do have some holidays from her—those Allansons
whom she had not marked down could be attractively
natural and gay; and the younger Allanson girl is as delight-
ful a portrait as any in Miss TYNAN's generous gallery.
I think I never met a writer who splashed language
about with a greater recklessness than Miss MARION HILL.
I see that one of the reviews of that previous best seller of
At the Siege of Carthage.
“Look ouT, Boys! HERE comes ANOTHER SAUCY SCIPIo !”
hers, The Lure of Crooning Water, speaks of its literary
charm. Well, there are, of course, many varieties of charm,
but “literary” is hardly the epithet that I should myself
apply to the undoubted attractions of A Slack Wire (LoNG).
This very bustling story of the marriage between a variety
artist and a quiet, not to say somewhat prigsome, young
engineer is told for the most part in the purest American,
an engaging and vivid medium with which I am but
imperfectly acquainted. Further, Miss HILL's command of
words seems to be gloriously unhampered by tradition.
“It was with a supercargo of relief even heavier than usual
that he found it" is a sample that I select at random.
No, I certainly do not think that “literary” would be the
epithet. But I am far from saying that there is no charm
in the tale, of a sort. Not specially original perhaps the
situation of the Bohemian wife brought to an ultra-Philis-
tine home; but Miss HILL manages to keep it going briskly
enough. And, as I have hinted, you never know what she
will say next, or how. The whole thing would make such
an admirable film-play that I can hardly believe this idea
to have been absent from the intention of its author. The
- T final sensation-scene, in
which Violet uses her old
wire-walking agility to
| prevent a catastrophe
!...Lº (never ask me how !),
ºf would make a fortune on
º line screen. Poor Violet,
ſº I may tell you, had been
*: born in England, and, on
the death of her rightful
º, guardians, was “farmed
ſº off to peasants, who
º, boarded her because it
would cancel their poor-
º tax." I feel somehow that
º if I could grasp this re-
ference it would make
* much in Violet clear. But
* so far it eludes me.
If powers of absorption
are still left to you for any
"— battles save those of to-
day, you will find a vivid account of Flodden in The Crimson
Field (WARD, Lock). I won't believe it is Mr. HALLIwÉLL
SUTCLIFFE's fault that the fighting scenes of his story left
me cold; the blame lies rather with the Hunnish times
in which we live. While describing the beauty of the
Yorkshire dales and the lives of their inhabitants, Mr.
SUTCLIFFE held me in the hollow of his hand. But when
he started to tell of the valiant deeds of the yeoman-hero,
Sylvester Demain, who was knighted on the field of battle
and won the maiden of high degree, I was released from
that bondage. Indeed, I think Mr. SUTCLIFFE was no more
anxious to leave the dales than I was, for, when the march
to Flodden begins, his style becomes almost bewilderingly
jumpy, so often does he look over his shoulder to see—and
let us know—what is happening to those who were left
behind. The fight, however, when it does come, is strenuous
enough, and in the midst of it. KING JAMEs—German papers
please copy—stands out as a pattern of chivalry.

THE JOY TAX.
By one who is prepared to accept it like a patriot without
further protest.
Now Spring comes laughing down the sky
To see her buds all busy hatching;
With tender green the woods are gay,
And birds, as is their April way,
Chirp merrily on the bough, and I
Chirp, too, because it's catching.
Full many a joy I must eschew
And to the tempter's voice “No | No ' " say:
With taxes laid on all delights
Must miss, with other mirthful sights,
On Monday next my annual view
Of England's Art Exposé.
I must forgo (and bear the worst
With what I can of noble calm) a
Pure bliss from which I only part
With horrid pain about the heart—
I mean the humour unrehearsed
Of serious British drama.
13ut, thank the Lord, I need not miss
The birds that in their leafy nook coo;
Young Spring is mine to taste at large,
The Ministry has made no charge
For earth that warms to April's kiss;
They haven't taxed the cuckoo! (). S.
A VOLUNTEER CASUALTY.
WE were “standing easy” prior to the assault on the
undefended heights of Spanker's Hill when the voice of
the platoon-commander disturbed our thoughts of home
and loved ones, and particularly of our Sunday dinners,
which would be very much out of season before we could
get at them.
“Number 4,” he said, in a tone that thrilled us to the
bottom twist of our puttees, “these Body - Snatchers
(thus coarsely he alluded to the Ambulance Section) have
been following us all day and haven't had a single casualty
so far. That is why, in the coming advance, I shall be
wounded. Sergeant, you will take over the command,
should the worst befall. Smith and Williams, as you are
both big and heavy, you'd better be knocked out too.”
It was with mingled feelings that I heard my name
mentioned. In the first place, a feeling of annoyance was
engendered at having my proportions thus publicly re-
ferred to. But other, and I trust worthier, thoughts came
to me, and, turning to my neighbour, I gave him a few
last messages of a suitably moving nature to be delivered
to my friends. The kind-hearted fellow was deeply affected,
and in a voice broken by emotion offered to take charge of
my loose change, and asked for my watch as a keepsake.
I thanked him with tears in my eyes, but said that
the burial party would forward all my valuables to my
relations.
Our conversation was interrupted by the command
“Platoon—'s HUN. To the left, to six paces, ex-TENI)."
By an oversight the preliminary formation usually adopted
as a precaution against artillery had been omitted, and in a
moment we were advancing up the hill in open order.
Scarcely had we started when our officer, the pride of
the platoon, threw up his hands and fell. A moment later,
chancing on a piece of tempting grass, I decided to lie
down, and with a choking gurgle collapsed. As I lay on
my back in an appropriate attitude (copied from the
cinema) I wondered when the stretcher-party would appear,
for the grass was damp and the April wind was chilly;
but it was not long before a bright boy, rather over than
under military age, ran up and, after a brief glance at me,
began to signal with great vigour. He meant well, and out
of consideration for his feelings I restrained a desire to tell
him that he was creating a beastly draught. However, I
asked him if he had any brandy, and, on receiving an
answer in the negative, groaned deeply.
“Are you very bad?” he asked.
“No,” I replied; “but if I lie here much longer I'll
catch cold. Tell your people to hurry up.”
When the stretcher-party arrived they decided that
I had been shot in the chest, and, to get at the wound,
began to remove my garments, till arrested by some
virile language thrown off from the part affected. Then
they began to carry me towards the gate of the park,
despite the fact that the stretcher had been meant to
hold someone about six inches shorter than I. Almost
immediately the rear man, tripping on a root, fell on top
of me, and the front man, being brought to a sudden stop,
sat on my feet. When we had sorted ourselves out, and
i had stopped talking, more from lack of breath than of
matter, we resumed our journey.
After a matter of some three hundred yards the bearers
began to feel tired, and, suddenly rolling me off the
stretcher, they informed me that I was discharged as cured.
Thus rapidly does a soldier of the Volunteers recover. It
speaks volumes not only for their high state of physical
condition but for the resilience of their moral.

THE WATCH DOGS.
XXXVIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, One of these
days I will tell you the more intimate
history of the Corps to which I have
the honour to belong, and this will give
you some cause for mirth. Its members
are of all sorts, ages and origins, and
they have had between them some odd
experiences since that first day when,
parading hastily in Kensington Gardens,
they wished they hadn't been quite
so glib, in their anxiety to get to war,
about professing full knowledge of the
ways and wiles of the motor bicycle.
One at least of them paid the price of
inexactitude then and there ; he still
shudders to think how, - -
put to the test, he unin-
tentionally left the Park
for a no less fashionable
but much more crowded
thoroughfare, to arrive
eventually, in the prone
position, in a byway of
Piccadilly, where small
fragments of the machine
may still be collected by
industrious seekers of
curios.
Another, whom the low
cunning of the Criminal
Bar enabled to avoid the
immediate test, paid the
full price, with compound
interest, later on. Casual
observers of the retreat, \
had there been any, would /* ºf .
have become familiar with vs "h
the sight of him bringing
up the rear—a very poor
last. To see him arrive,
perspiring, over the brow
of a hill, with his faith-
ful motor at his side, was to know
that the Huns were at the bottom of
it. On one occasion they even beat
him in the day's march, but were too
kind or too blind to seize their advan-
tage. As usual he was taking his
obsession along with him, though, if he
had but known, he might have got it to
do the work by the simple formality of
turning the petrol tap from of F to on.
His was ever a curious life, from the
first moment of his joining the Army
in tails, a bowler hat, and a large sword
wrapped in a homely newspaper. But
the inward fun of it all is not for the
present, Charles; our dear old friends,
the Exigencies, forbidding.
I am reminded of it all by having
just crossed with one of the later-joined
members. He came fresh from the line
to a Head-quarters, and he was walk-
ing about in a lane, working off some
of his awe of his new surroundings,
when he was overtaken by a car con-
—--→
taining a General, who stopped and
asked him what he was. So imposing
was the account he gave of himself
that it was said to him, “No doubt,
then, you'll know the way to ——,” a
village at the back of beyond, where a
division was lying at rest. In the
Army, at any rate at a Head-quarters,
we all know everything. So he said,
“No doubt, Sir," hoping, if the worst
came to the worst, to give some vague
directions and not to be present when
they were found wanting. But it was
his bad luck to have struck one of the
more affable Generals. Could he spare
the time to come along and direct the
driver ?
So on to the box he got (it was a
THE TRENCH TOUCH.

closed car) and, with the General's eye
always upon his back, he did his best
as guide, a task for which his previous
career of stockbroker had ill qualified priate one than this. No, he wouldn't
him. The first thing to happen was
that the car, proceeding down a narrow
|
lane, got well into the middle of a
battalion on the march, which, when
the car was firmly jammed amongst
the transport, ceased to be on the
march, and took a generous ten
minutes' halt . . . The second thing
to happen was a level crossing, which,
as they approached it, changed its mind
about being a road and became a rail-
way. A nice long train duly arrived,
and (this needs no exaggeration) stayed
there, with a few restless movements,
for twenty minutes by the clock. .
The third thing to happen was that
he lost himself (and the General); the
fourth was the falling of dusk, and
the fifth a ploughed field, with which
my friend, alighting, had to confess was just edging the conversation lound
make
that he was not so intimately acquainted
as he could have wished.
Had there been a scene, he could, he
says, have endured the worst bravely,
standing to attention and taking it as
it came. Not so, however; his was
the wrong sort of General for the
purpose. As does the partner at the
dance, over whose priceless gown you
have upset the indelible ice, he said it
didn't matter. He said he'd give the
division a miss, and return whence
they had come. This they began to
do, when they had got the car out of
the ploughed field, and this they went
on doing until the sixth thing hap-
pened, which was a burst tyre.
Again, had there been a scene, my
man could have explained
that this wasn't his fault;
but no one said it was
his fault. Equally it was
never openly alleged that
he was to blame for the
driver's not being pre-
pared with a spare wheel
ready for use. But his em-
barrassment was such that
my man was grateful to
heaven for reminding him
at this juncture of the
existence of R.F.C. Head-
quartels, about a kilo-
metre away. He said
he'd run and borrow a
wheel off them, and before
the General could say him
nay he'd started. . . . He
ran all the way, and burst,
panting, into the officers'
mess, where he had the
misfortune to sºrike an-
other itinerant General.
It never rains but it
- pours, and the area seemed
to be infested with Generals of quite the
wrong sort. He couldn't have hit upon
a more kind and genial and inappro-
allow a word of apology or explanation
from this exhausted lieutenant until the
latter had rested and refreshed himself
with a cup of tea. No, not out of that
pot; it had been standing too long.
Tea which had stood should not be
drunk, for reasons detailed at length.
No doubt the Colonel, whose guest he
was, would order some more to be
made. It would take two minutes—it
did take twenty. No, no; there was
nothing to say and nothing need be
said. It was this General's particular
wish that he should be at peace and
himself at home. Let him
make his explanations and apologies
later.
Whatever you would have done, my
overwhelmed friend temporized. He

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NIGHT OUT WITH A ZEPPELIN.
BY KARI, vox WEEKEND
(HYPHENATED NEUTRAL).
(Concluded.)
BENEATH us—beneath, in a manner
of speaking, the iron heel of the all-
conquering Fatherland—lay perfidious
England. I, as a mere layman, had,
of course, not the vaguest idea as to
precisely what vital portion of the
doomed island was immediately be-
low us. Not so my host, the Captain
Sigismund von Münchhausen, who sud-
denly snapped together the stetho-
scope through which he had been
gazing and rapped out a monosyllabic
order down the speaking tube at his
right hand.
“We are now,” he said, turning
courteously to me, “ diametrically above
the entrenched camp of Little Tilling-
ham - under - Hill.” A fearful crash
sounded from the depths below and a
voice muttered something through the
speaking tube. “A hit!” cried the
Captain without emotion. “Ober-Leut-
nant von Dachswurst reports that the
Arsenal, three munitions factories and
two infant schools are in flames. Ah !
Now we have reached Birmingham ' "
Another crash rent the abysm. “Now
Glasgow !” A third terrific explosion
was audible.
“But,” I cried, “we can't have got
from Birmingham to Glasgow in thirty-
five seconds.” For a moment the
Captain's eyes flashed angrily. He
clenched his feet, and, remembering
the horrible fate of the seasick sailor,
I crouched against the bulwark. With
an effort, however, the man mastered
himself. I was relieved to see an
enigmatic smile overspread his coun-
tenance.
“It is plain,” he said, in the voice
of one patiently rebuking a child, “that
you do not know what a German air-
ship can do. Ah! haſ There goes
Bristol " " he added, as further detona-
tions smote upon our ears.
And so the hideous carnage pro-
ceeded. Grasmere, Aberystwith, Strat-
ford-on-Avon, Freshwater Bay and
the Lizard–with dreadful precision
these teeming hives of English indus-
try were laid waste, incinerated,
scattered to the winds in fine im-
palpable dust. I thought sadly of the
brave men in khaki that were being
cut off by the thousand in their prime
(for the gallant Captain had taken the
utmost precaution not to drop any of
his bombs in the neighbourhood of
non-combatants). But, after all, I
mused, they will soon be replaced by
intelligent Germans, a blessing that
civilization will not be slow to appre-
ciate.
At this moment the Captain ap-
proached me with an object in his
hand. “You neutrals,” he said, “have
been deceived before now by the ridi-
culous reports disseminated by our
enemies as to the results of these raids.
But here is the proof.” He then
explained to me that to every Zeppelin
was attached a large sinker or plum-
met, which was covered with grease and
lowered from a drum to a few yards
above the spot where the bomb was
destined. to fall. To this plummet
adhered fragments of various objects,
animate or other, which the explosion
of the missile hurled into the air. Such
a fragment the Captain was now ex-
tending for my observation. I admitted
that to my uninitiated eye it closely
resembled a portion of the outer sur-
face of a cow or some kindred animal.
“You are indeed ignorant,” said my
host, smiling in the same enigmatic
way. “The object is undoubtedly a
fragment of the propeller shaft of a
large vessel, which satisfies me that at
Swanage, where our last bomb was
dropped, a portion of the High Seas
Fleet was anchored. And as a matter of
fact,” he added, producing a small dark
object from his pocket, “here is a part
of Sir John JELLICoE's necktie. Notice
how precisely it tallies with the descrip-
tions furnished by our secret agents,
one of whom is actually engaged about
the Admiral's person disguised as a
pastry-cook.” -
Here, then, was the proof. One could
not doubt the evidence of one's senses.
But mine had been subjected to an
unusual test that night, and when the
Captain, well satisfied with his night's
work, courteously invited me to have
another glass of schnapps with him I
accepted with alacrity. The glass was
hardly at my lips when an orderly an-
nounced that we were at anchor in the
shed. Thanking the brave Captain for
the most wonderful experience of a not
uninteresting lifetime, I hurried away
to my hotel and fell into a deep slumber.
When I awoke late that afternoon my
manservant placed in my hand the last
edition of the London Times. It stated
that there had been a Zeppelin raid,
and that 19 civilians, three cows, four
churches, two rows of cottages, one
º and no soldiers had been
destroyed.
I smiled—enigmatically.

PREMIER'S STATEMENT 2''
Monday, April 17th. — The hon.
Member who described the present
Parliamentary situation as “a cabal
every afternoon and a crisis every
second day" is justified of his epigram.
The lobbies this afternoon were full of
agitated whisperers, with much talk of
a divided Cabinet and this and that
Minister on the brink of resignation,
or the best method of obtaining them.
All of which must be very comforting
to our enemies. -
Some anxiety is felt on the Treasury
Bench owing to the marked shortage
of Members from Ireland. Hitherto,
whenever the Government has seemed
to be in danger, Mr. REDMOND's fol-
lowers have trooped over from Dublin
to the rescue. But to-day most of
them are absent. Some attribute their
defection to chagrin at their short-
sightedness in resisting the appoint-
ment of Mr. CAMPBELL as Lord Chan-
cellor of Ireland. As Attorney-General
they fear he will exert a much more
potent influence in Irish affairs.
Faithful among the faithless, Mr.
GINNELL was in his place. He is not
interested in the troubles of the British
Government. His present obsession
is the alleged over-taxation of his own
beloved country.

patiate upon that grievance he pressed

Constable. “ON THE contRARY, SIR, YOU ’RE A DAY Too EARLY.”
He should have said a
the PRIME MINISTER to arrange an
early sitting on Wednesday and also to
suspend the eleven o'clock rule. At this
naïve suggestion the House relieved
its tension with a hearty laugh.
How much truth there may be in the
stories of Ministerial dissension I do
not know; but there is undoubtedly a
CAve on the Treasury Bench. In the
absence of the CHANCELLoR he took
charge of the Report Stage of the
Finance Bill, and very well he ac-
quitted himself. Incidentally the Soli-
citor - GENERAL had the honour of
bringing about a notable reconcilia-
tion. Among the few occupants of the
Nationalist benches were Mr. DILLON
and Mr. TIMOTHY IHEALY, who for some
years past have rarely met without a
collision. Accordingly when Mr. DILLON
had resisted a proposal to fine any
visitor to an entertainment who did not
pay the Amusements-tax, it was confi-
dently expected that Mr. HEALY would
find excellent reasons for asserting that
this was the best clause in the whole
Bill, and that only a melancholy hum-
bug would oppose it. Instead he vigor-
ously supported his former foe with an
argument that I am sure Mr. DiLLON
would never have thought of. “Was it
not a weird proposal,” he asked, “that
a child who had unwittingly walked
become a convict and lose its Old-Age
Pension ?”

Tuesday, April 18th. – When one
has at last screwed up one's courage to
have a tooth out, there is nothing more
unnerving than to be told by the dentist
that he cannot operate to-day and that
one must come again to-morrow. The
House of Commons felt like that this
afternoon. Members had flocked from
all parts of the kingdom—Nationalist
Ireland excepted—to hear the PRIME
MINISTER’s promised statement. Col.
CHURCHILL, Lord HUGH CECIL (with a
patch on his lofty brow denoting a
recent casualty), and other warrior-
statesmen had reluctantly torn them-
selves from the attractions of the
trenches to do their duty at West-
minster. The Ladies' Gallery was filled
to overflowing. -
Then the ominous word went round,
“No statement to-day.” Sure enough,
when the PRIME MINISTER rose and
hushed the buzz of conversation that
had rendered Questions inaudible, it
was merely to observe that there were
still some points outstanding, that no
statement would be adequate without
their adjustment, and that he would
therefore postpone his motion for the
Easter adjournment until to-morrow.

ing compulsory service for all men of

crisis and to speculate as to what were
the points outstanding, and whether the
MINISTER OF MUNITIONS was or was not
the prickliest of them. To the noise
and flurry created by their exit Mr.
McKENNA owes it that his Finance
Bill will appear in the Journals of the
House as having been passed without
a dissenting voice. Mr. WHITLEY, who
was in the Chair, has not the com-
manding tones of Mr. LowTHER, and
when he put the question, “That this
Bill be now read a Third time,”
nobody rose to speak. Accordingly he
declared that the “Ays” had it, and
though several Members then protested
that they had not heard the question
put, and urged that it should be put
again, he politely but firmly declined
to oblige them. -
In an incautious moment yesterday
Mr. TENNANT advised Mr. SNow DEN to
use his imagination. I should have
thought the advice was superfluous, for,
to judge by some of the stories that the
Member for Blackburn is in the habit
of retailing to the House regarding
the persecution of conscientious ob-
jectors by callous N.C.O.'s, his imag-
ination is working overtime. On the
motion for the adjournment Mr. TEN-
-NANT had to listen to several more of
them. He was rewarded for his patience
by obtaining an unexpected testimonial
from Mr. KING, who in his most patron-
ising tones declared that he was sorry
for the UNDER SECRETARY, who was
really “a great deal better than the
average man in the street.”
In readiness for the PRIME MINISTER's
anticipated statement, Lord MILNER
had put down a motion in the House of
Lords in favour of compulsory service
for all men of military age; and, despite
the changed circumstances, he persisted
in moving it, and made an admirable
speech in its support. Lord CREWE,
indeed, found it unanswerable for the
time being, as Downing Street was
“still thinking.” He could not say
when its thoughts would be resolved
into decision, but hoped it might be
to-morrow — or, if not to - morrow,
Thursday–or, if not Thursday, then
perhaps Monday. Lord CREwe has
not sat at Mr. Asquith's feet all these
years without catching something of
his methods.
Wednesday, April 19th.-The House
was even more crowded and anxious
than yesterday. In the Peers' Gallery
a dim figure, carrying a bunch of prim-
roses and looking astonishingly like
Mr. DENNIS EADIE, was heard to mur-
mur, “I wonder whether England loves
Coalitions any more than she did in my
time.” The present PRIME MINISTER
appears to think that she does, for, after

on material points threatened a break-

describe that contingency as a national
disaster. The Liberals thought so too,
and cheered loudly; the Unionists were
not quite so sure, and Sir Edward CAR-

looking as if he had never heard of
Ulster, indicated that, while he would
be the last man to refuse the Govern-
ment time for repentance and reforma-
tion, he would in the meantime keep

AGAIN.”
DIDN'T HEAR THE GONG.”
THE PHILATELIST.
THIS was the day appointed, after considerable dis-
cussion, for our visit to London, and at an early hour
Frederick and I were ready for the journey. Frederick,
who is tending slowly, as it seems to me, towards an as
yet sufficiently remote ninth birthday, had been vigorously
and successfully scrubbed till he shone with an unwonted
absence of grime; his hair had been temporarily battened
down; his Eton collar was speckless, and his knickerbocker
suit, while not aggressively new, was appropriate and free
from visible rents. I cannot say he was impressed with
the solemnity of the occasion, but he was eager and fully
determined to purchase as many stamps as could be
secured for the generous prize of money bestowed upon
him by a lady who had observed his progress in the study
of Nature—beetles, moths, tadpoles and the like—and had
noted his ever-growing passion for postage-stamps.
London he looked upon as one gigantic repository of
stamps. I spoke to him of Trafalgar Square and the
Nelson Column and the Landseer Lions. He replied by
informing me that there was a certain issue of Mauritius
which was valued at £1,200. “If,” he said, “I could get
that some day I shouldn't want to collect any more.”
“It seems,” I said, “a lot of money to pay for a small
piece of paper."
“Yes,” he agreed, “it is; but perhaps I could get it
cheap in some old shop which didn't know much about
it.”
I then tried to divert his attention to the prospect of
having luncheon with me at the Rhadamanthus Club,
but he begged me not to interrupt him, as he was
endeavouring to calculate how many years it would take
him to get together the sum if he could manage to save
two-pence a week out of his pocket-money. After a short
mental struggle, however, he gave it up and banished the
blue Mauritius, or whatever it is, from his ambitions
and his conversation. -
Before we started Francesca addressed a few earnest
words to me about the proper care of a boy in London.
“Be sure,” she said, “to see that he keeps his hands
clean. I should hate to think that he was wāndering
about Piccadilly and Pall Mall with dirty hands.”
“He’ll have to wander,” I said, “with such hands as
Nature provides for him. No little boy can ever keep his
hands clean anywhere for more than half a minute at a
stretch.”
“But you might give him an occasional wash, you know.”
“I will do everything,” I said, “that may become a
father, short of carrying about a wash-hand basin and a
jug of water and a piece of soap and a towel through
Piccadilly and Pall Mall.”
“And his hair,” she said, “you'll not let it get too
untidy, will you?” -
“I’ll brush it when I can,” I said ; “but you must
remember that a little boy without a Catherine-wheel of
hair on the back of his head is only fit for a museum. ... I
must insist on his keeping his Catherine-wheel substantially
intact.”
Well, at last we got off in the train on our adventure, I
with a morning paper, and Frederick deep in a stamp-
catalogue, from which he occasionally brought forth things
old and new. In due time we reached our destination and
stood triumphant in the stamp-shop. It was not a large
shop, but it was a rich shop, owning countless, valuable
varieties, and Frederick, whose hands were now of the sub-
fusc hue which Cambridge insists on for the garments of her
candidates, was soon engaged in an animated discussion with

the affable and amused proprietor. At last the five shillings
were exhausted and the deal was complete, the last item
consisting of a perfectly terrific set of Gaboon stamps, each
decorated with the fuzzy head of a spear-bearing native
warrior. It speaks volumes for the power and courage of
our French allies that they should have been able to over-
come these savage and formidable tribesmen, and reduce
them to the order that is implied by the existence of a post-
office and the possession of stamps.
We now found that we had about forty minutes to spare.
It is hardly necessary to say that, being in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Strand, we devoted the time to a
Cinema. The change from the Gaboon and its truculent
inhabitants to a highly sentimentalised fishing-village was
something of a wrench, but Frederick, clutching his
purchases and his catalogue as if his life depended on
stamps, was equal to it. He bore without flinching the
storms and the wrecks, and the bodies of drowned men
tossed upon the shore. Nor did he audibly disapprove
when one fisherman, rescued from death, lost his memory
for many years, and eventually regained it in extreme old
age amid the rejoicings of his relatives and neighbours.
Thence we passed by a happy change to the detached and
melancholy malice of Mr. CHARLEs CHAPLIN, of whom I
can now say, Vidi tantum. Mr. CHAPLIN's victim on this
occasion was a well-dressed foreign gentleman of perfect
manners but fiery temper, who was compelled to suffer a
series of dreadful indignities. We left him struggling
We now went on to the Rhadamanthus. Here the rite
of washing and brushing was duly performed, Frederick
remarking with obvious regret that if it had only been on
the Cinema he would have had to throw the soap at me
and splash the water in my face. “But,” he added, “I
shall be able to do it to Alice when I get home.” He was
not at all overwhelmed by the marble and gilded splendours
of our palace, but sat himself down to luncheon as if he
had an immemorial right to be there. General Wilbraham
(in khaki), Mr. Justice Black, and Mr. Trevor, the eminent
publisher, kind old gentlemen, my friends and contem-
poraries, came up to us and were introduced to the little
boy and smiled at him and patted his head, where the
indomitable Catherine-wheel still whirled in triumph, and
all declared that it was hardly tolerable in another to be so
young, and asked him what it felt like, and said that
growing up was the great mistake.
And then a strange thing happened. The luncheon-room
suddenly became a hall filled with boys. The General and
the Judge and the Publisher dwindled and changed. The
long-lost hair came back to their heads in great untidy
tufts; they put on Eton jackets and collars and grubby
hands. In fact, they were little boys again ; and Master
Wilbraham said he was keeping Cave, and Master Black
said something was a regular chouse, and Master Trevor
declared violently that somebody was a sneak and that
somebody else must have tweaks for new clothes. It lasted
for a moment, and then, as with a puff of air, it all changed
silently but furiously against an adhesive lobster salad back, and we were again in the luncheon-room of the club,
which Mr. CHAPLIN had, in an absent-minded moment, four time-worn, veterans and one eager little boy tightly
plastered over his face. grasping a catalogue of stamps. R. C. L.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE SHOW SHOP.”
THE drama is almost the only religion
I know that can expose the mysteries
of its ritual to the vulgar gaze and yet
retain the devotion of its worshippers.
There is nothing a British audience so
loves as to be taken behind the scenes
and shown how it is done—or not done;
and then it will attend the next play
and go on adoring with the blindest
infatuation. Were it not for this as-
tounding gift of resilience one might
deplore the prurient curiosity that
wants to peep into the hollow image
of Isis and get at the machinery of
the priesthood.
More human and wholesome is the
satisfaction derived from the revelation
of amateur foibles, for here we are
laughing at ourselves, as in A Panto-
mime Rehearsal. In The Show Shop
this element was supplied by a young
plutocrat who took a small part with
a travelling company in order to be
near his fiancée, the leading lady; and
continued in it as jeune premier because
she refused to be made love to on the
stage by anybody else. In assuming
a rôle for which he was incredibly ill-
qualified he seemed likely to facilitate
the achievement of his purpose, namely
to make the play a hopeless failure
and so secure the deliverance of his
lady from the thraldom of her mother's
ambitions and set her free to marry
him.
However, the failure failed to
come off, and although he forgot to
remove his overcoat (containing the
stolen bonds) at a critical juncture on
which the Great Situation turned—
the error was so deadly that the
mother, who had stage-managed the
thing and was witnessing the first
performance from a box, actually rose
in her seat to correct it—the play was
a roaring success; and there was
nothing for it but a secret marriage,
marred by the prospect of a two years'
run “on Broadway.” -
Mr. A. E. MATTHEws, as the amateur,
made extraordinarily good fun for us;
and there was something fresh in the
idea of following up the dress rehearsal
with a first night. It not only gave
the amateur his chance of making the
big mistake against which he had been
thoroughly warned, but our own ap-
plause allowed the company to put
into practice the lessons they had
learned in those sacred conventions
which regulate the taking of a call.
There are those who say that Trans-
atlantic humour should be interpreted
exclusively by a native cast, and that
an Anglo-American alliance is a mis-
take. I trust President Wilson's
recent policy will not be affected by
this view. Certainly, though the com-
bination was responsible for the noisiest
fun of the farce, the purely American per-
formance of Miss MARGARET MoEFATT
at the opening of the First Act was
as good as anything in the play. But
happily this is not one of those im-
ported creations that overwhelm my
uninstructed intelligence with exotic
colour and exotic slang.
Mr. EDMUND GwBNN, as Mar
Rosenbaum, impresario, was in irresis-
tible form. Miss MARIE LöHR, in the
part of the leading lady, was at her
lightest and therefore her best ; but
Lady TREE (her designing mother),
though she played very hard and in-
cisively, could scarcely have satisfied
her own very nice sense of humour with
what was to be got out of a character
that resembled nothing on earth (or
the Eastern hemisphere anyhow).
In the midst of all the mirth there was
a pathetic passage between a couple of
impecunious players, Johnny Brinkley
(played by Mr. GEORGE ELTON, who had
many good things to say and said them
well) and Effie, his wife, on the theme
of the precariousness of their career.
It must have melted the cynical heart
of many a critic in the audience, and I
for one was almost persuaded to confine
myself for the future to encomium in
these columns. . -
However, there is no flattery in
the compliments I beg to offer to
Mr. JAMES FoRBEs for a very diverting
evening. Perhaps the last Act dragged
a little, but in any case after the orgy he
had given us we were ripe for reaction.
With most imported plays one is apt
to doubt whether the humour is novel
in its essence or merely a matter of
unfamiliar form, common enough in
its place of origin. But the humour
of Mr. For BEs, or at least the best of
it, is something more than American.
. t O. S.
“She heard him blowing his nose on the
hall mat, and she understood the major
sufficiently to know that this portended some-
thing.”—Home Chat.
We have always regarded this be-
haviour as ominous, even in the case
of civilians. i
“Once you have a wife and are tied down
to the world, she creates the necessity of a
house and saves you from being a wanderer on
the face of the earth. No wife, no house.
Hence, say our Shastras, it is not the building
called the house that is the wife, it is the wife
who is the house. And even now, both among
the high and the low, it is usual for a Hindu
to speak of his wife as his house.”

AN ECCENTRIC.
HAVING alighted on strange ground
at Chiswick Park Station, I was lost.
My destination was Hog ARTH's House—
one of the few homes of the illustrious
which are preserved for pious pilgrims,
but whether to go this way or that I
had no notion, nor was there anyone
to ask. I therefore turned to the left
and, just after being half-blinded by a
dusty whirlwind, stopped an errand-
boy and was told by him I had done
right, and had but to keep on.
I therefore continued, but with so
little confidence that a hundred yards
further on I stopped another wayfarer,
who, however, had no knowledge of
any Hogarth but a local laundry of that
name, and could not say where it was.
It was then that I fell into the arms
of as admirable although peculiar a
man as I ever hope to meet, and com-
municative too. He was one of those
elderly men who keep their youth,
largely by virtue of cheerful spirits.
He was short and active and he wore
a cap. He had sandy-grey hair and a
touch of sandy-grey whisker; his eye
was bright and his cheeks were ruddy.
He beamed with contentment. He
may not have been, as the diverting
‘Mr. BERRY says in Tina, “fearfully
crisp,” but he was crisp enough.
Did he know Chiswick? Why, he
had known it for nearly sixty years.
Then he knew Hog ARTH's House? No,
he couldn't say he did, but, anyhow,
it must be in the other direction, be-
cause this, strictly speaking, was Acton
Green and not Chiswick at all. To get
to Chiswick I ought to have gone the
other way. “But a depraved errand-
boy " I began to say, and then
realising that the recapitulation of other
people's errors is perhaps the idlest
form of speech, where nearly all lack
necessity, I said instead that the natives
did not seem to specialise much in know-
ledge of their locality; to which he re-
plied that they ought to, for there was
no more beautiful place in the world.
“I’m going in the direction you
want, myself,” he added. “The fact is
we're moving, and I've got to get
some new blinds, and the shop's on
your way.” -
So we fell into step, I with great
difficulty keeping up with his happy
buoyancy.
Yes, he admitted, moving was a trial,
but his new house was far more com-
fortable than the old one, and, after all,
what's a little trouble 2
This was a revolutionary enough
remark, but when he went on to ask,
Wasn't it a lovely spring morning?

From the list of books already
published by Mr. CECIL HEADLAM
it is easy to see that he is by
choice a topographer rather than
a novelist. Indeed the fact is
made sufficiently obvious to the
reader of Red Screes (SMITH,
ELDER). Its sub-title is A Ro-
mance of Lakeland, and so strongly
developed is the place-spirit in its
author that he is constantly break-
ing the rather tenuous thread of
his story to introduce long descrip-
tions of Cumberland scenery and
people, and as this is most easily
done by sending his chief characters
for walks in the districts that Mr.
HEADLAM wishes to talk about the
result is that I seldom read a
novel in which the protagonists were kept SO sternly on the the inevitable had ha

Perhaps Fauvette, the heroine
of The Green Orchard (CAssell),
was too modern to have much
acquaintance with the works of
the late WILLIAM BLACK. Which
was a pity, as a recollection of A

withheld her from her impulsive
marriage with Martin Wilderspin,

less for the resulting shipwreck.
A bride who comes down late for
a most critical little dinner to her

No. XXXVIII.
(From General row FALKENH4+N.) ,
ALMIGHTIEST WAR-LoRD,-See how the Fates make sport
with us! We began in February to make our great attack
upon the fortified position at Verdun. In ten days, so we
thought, our massed artillery, firing a ceaseless torrent of
projectiles, would have shattered beyond recovery the lines
of the enemy, and our irresistible infantry, breaking through
like a flood, would have swept away all opposition, and
would without doubt have taken the fol tress and cleared.
our way to Paris and to decisive victory. So we believed,
having, as it appeared, every reason for our belief, and
having taken into account in our careful planning all the
chances and vicissitudes to which men and battles are
exposed. And now May is come with her buds and blooms,
May, when, as your Majesty knows, the heart of every
good honest German turns to thoughts of beer-gardens and
draughts of foaming liquid, and so far as the capture of
Verdun and the opening of the road to Paris ale concerned
we have done nothing that has any value except for our
foes, who have had the satisfaction of seeing us beat our-
selves to fragments against the steel wall of their defence.
It must be confessed that German blood and German
courage have been miserably wasted, and not even our
resources, great as they are, can much longer stand the
strain which has been imposed upon them.
Your Majesty asks me what under these circumstances
it is best to do. Shall we break off our attacks at Verdun
and direct our hammer-blows at some other part of the
front ? Theoretically there is much to be said from the
purely military standpoint for such a course; but can your
Majesty foresee what the moral effect would be upon our
troops in the field and upon the Germans still left behind
us in Germany 2 We might, of course, announce that we
had now gained everything we had set out to gain, that
the French had lost immense numbers of killed and
wounded, that we had taken in unwounded prisoners the
equivalent of an army corps, that our booty was incalculable,
and that, in fact, the victory was definitely ours. But
would Germany believe this statement—REVENTLow, of
course, would believe it, but then he would believe any-
thing—and above all would the French believe it 2 I can
promise your Majesty that they would believe nothing of
the sort, and that they would give some excellent reasons
for their disbelief. And the result would be that we should
be held not only to have acknowledged our failure, but
also to have made ourselves ridiculous in the sight of the
whole world. That, I am certain, would be intolerable
for your Majesty and for the German people, who have
been fed upon a diet of victory, and would be beyond
measure disquieted by such an admission of failure as I
have mentioned. No, the only thing to do, now that we
have been so deeply involved, is to persist in the struggle
and hope that we may in the end wear out enemies who
have hitherto shown no signs of fatigue.
Fortunately it cannot be said that your Majesty is in-
volved in this lack of the success we all hoped for. Though
you are nominally the chief Commander of our Armies
it is known that in the actual operations your Majesty
has played the modest part of an onlooker rather than a
director. Formerly, that is before the breaking out of the
War, you were a great planner of plans, and it was under-
stood that, in case of war, you would lead your armies in
the field and prove that a Hohenzollern can do anything.
But now you have recognised your limitations, and no
Emperor can well do more than that. You do not now
thrust your advice upon your generals, whatever you may
have done at the outset of the War, and, though you may
once have dreamed of leading your hosts in a thundering
charge upon the foe, you have long since abandoned such
visions and have begun to realise that an Emperor is
but a man and cannot know everything. This, at least, is
my conviction, and I testify it to your Majesty with all the
bluntness that befits a soldier who has been honourel by
his Sovereign with a high command. - -
Most dutifully yours, Vox FALKENHAYN.

A You Ng lady typist was overheard
remarking in a City teashop the other

Guy Beverley had scaled the summit
of art; but art has no summit. We
thought he had plumbed the depths
of psychology; but psychology defies
the plumber. I date a new epoch in
my life from that day in 19– when I
picked up my Daily Reflector and read
the opening chapter of a new serial,
Her Soldier Sweethcart, by Ruby L.
Binns. That was on a Monday. By
Wednesday of that week this unknown
writer had revealed to me a New Idea
and a New Style. The idea is familiar
to most of you now, but in those days
the daring conception that a common
soldier might turn out to be the
missing heir of a baronet rang like a
challenge in the ears of the older ro-
manticism. It is her style, however,
that is Ruby Binns's most enduring
gift to English prose literature. Lean,
restrained, economical, it holds (for me)
the very spirit of the English race and
tongue. Listen:-
She went to the door, thinking she heard
something. There was nobody there, so she
went back to her work, thinking sadly of her
soldier boy. “ Cheer up,” said Clarice;
As I recall it even
“ perhaps he'll come back soon.” “Per-
haps,” answered Yvonne wanly, “but it does
not seem very likely, does it, dear?” The
next moment the door opened and a tall
soldierly figure entered the room.

ing on Tooting Common. Beverley
would have handled that situation well,
no doubt. But could he-could ally-
one—have achieved the poignancy of
that unaffected phrase, “It does not
seem very likely " ? I said that the
depths of Art were unplumbable. True,
but Ruby Binns has at least got lower
than most.
Next week I want to speak of a new
man and a new book, Stott Mackenzie

THE BEAUTIFUL THING.
YoU sce ugly things in London now-
a days. Oh, yes, but you see beautiful
things as well. I saw one yesterday—
one of the beautiful things.
It was a cold wet evening, not
actually raining but very, very nearly.
I stood at the place in Piccadilly where
the 'buses stop. There was quite a little
crowd waiting, as there always is at this
time of day—women with parcels, work.
girls going home, a few men. All of
them looked tired, and many of them
looked cross.
When a 'bus drew up at the curb
all these people made a simultaneous
plunge for it. Before it had finally
stopped they were clinging like a swarm
of bees to the steps and rails. It is an
arduous game this 'bus-catching, though
for those who are young and strong it
should perhaps have a certain attraction,
combining as it does the allurement of
a lottery gamble with the charm of a
football scrimmage.
There were only three vacant places,
and these, after a desperate struggle,
were secured by two athletic-looking
girls and a red-haired schoolboy. The
conductor waved back the disappointed
boarders, and they dropped off sulkily.
I watched them a moment and then
turned my eyes toward two soldiers,
who were crossing the street. Fine,
well-set-up men they were, and they
carried themselves with the indescrib-
able air of those who have crossed
swords with Death and left their
opponent, for the time at least, de-
feated. One of them had a green
shade over his left eye. The other
carried a stick and walked with a slight
limp.
They took up their position a little
to the side of the expectant crowd that
was already beginning to sway and
jostle at the sight of a fresh 'bus, which
had just rounded the corner. Small
chance for the new-comers, however
slightly wounded, in such a mêlée,
thought I.
The 'bus came rocking along, reeled
to the left, staggered to the right, and
came uncertainly to a shuddering rest
beside the pavement.
And then it was that I saw the
Beautiful Thing.
For of that little crowd, some twenty
people in all, not a soul moved. Not
a man, woman or child took so much
as a step forward. They looked at the
half-filled 'bus, they looked at the two
soldiers, and waited, motionless.
Those two had pressed forward briskly
enough, but as they mounted the steps,
the man with the green shade giving
a helping hand to his companion, the
attitude of the crowd seemed suddenly
to strike them. The lame man glanced
over his shoulder, smiled and murmured
something to his friend. His friend |
turned likewise and stared. He pushed .
his comrade through the doorway,
turned again, and very solemnly raised
his hand to his cap in salute. A second
later he too vanished within the interior
of the 'bus.
And then the rush began.
THE TRUMP CARD.
“Gold lace has a charm for the fair.”
WHEN William first became a Lieut.
R.N.V.R., in blue and gold,
Belinda smiled upon his suit
(Which formerly had found her cold);
His manly form and honest face,
She really liked them, I believe;
But, most of all, she loved the lace
Upon his sleeve. -
Yet soon a rival courtier came—
A dashing dapper Lieut. R.N. ;
And, as this paragon pressed his claim,
Oh, what could William hope for then?
How could a wobbly-braided swain
Vie with the actual Royal Navy,
Whose stripes were half as broad again
And straight, not wavy 2
Then William swore (ah, Envy, ah!)
“Belinda shall be mine, she shALL!”
And wrote a note to his papa,
Who'd just been made an Admiral:—
“Father, now that you'll fly at sea
A two-balled flag in place of pennant,
What do you say to taking me
As flag-lieutenant 2"
::: ::: : ::: sk
When William next waylaid his fair,
He had his glittering “aiglets” on ;
Rope upon rope of gold was there,
And now his rival's look was wan;
He tried a bitter sneer, to greet
This “peacock preening in the sun”;
But Miss Belinda thought them
“sweet" . . .
And William won.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, April 25th.--The Govern-
ment, which has sometimes been
accused of not having sufficient con-
fidence in the House of Commons, has
made ample amends. Information
about the Army, too grave to be im-
parted to the people who provide the
men and the means for maintaining it,
is to be freely given to four
or five hundred Members of
Parliament (not to mention a
similar number of Peers).
The PRIME MINISTER opened
the Secret Session in one of
his briefest speeches. “Mr.
Speaker,” he said, “I beg,
Sir, to call your attention to
the fact that strangers are
present.” The historic form
of this advertisement, “I spy
strangers,” is briefer still, but
inadmissible in these ticklish
times. One does not want
to see, in the enemy Press,
“British Prime Minister con-
fesses to spying.”
Then the Press Gallery
was cleared, and the Great
Inquest of the Nation became
a Vehmgericht. The wretched
scribe who should attempt to
peer behind the veil that
shrouds its proceedings has
been warned in advance of
the unnamed pains and penal-
ties that await him if he should
venture to describe or even
“refer to " the proceedings of
the Secret Session. I am un-
able to say, therefore, whether
it is true that the occupants

a brief and, so far as it went,
rosy-coloured report of the
situation in Dublin. Some
Nationalist Volunteers were
helping the Government. The
forces of the Crown were to
be further strengthened by a
party of American journalists,
armed to the teeth with quick-
firing pencils, who were going
over to deal with “this most
recent German campaign.”
This may have reminded
Mr. Asquith that there were
British journalists in the
Press Gallery. The DEPUTY

been called to this fact, the

to do so; and that altogether the

of this rebellion and hoped that the

reviving political dissension on Irish

pressing his extreme distaste for the
task of coercing them. The whole

“But suppose the old man is too

And so the epoch-making talk goes

take part in it.
Next, as a guide to the paper's
enterprise we are admitted to a
meeting of the Cabinet, and are
assisted at last to unravel the
mystery as to which Minister it
is who gives away the secrets of
that assembly, for we watch him
in his various disguises on his way
to the dark cellar where he meets
the political representative of the
paper, makes his report and re-
ceives the promise of his future
reward. It is, we feel confident,
this particular section of the film
which will secure for it an amazing
popularity, though all reference in
the Press to Cabinet proceedings
has now been made illegal for the
duration of the War. -
“The Birth of a Fluence,” it will
be seen, does not confine its ener-
gies to the office of the paper.
5. thorough is the scheme that
various pictures have been taken
—always, of course, at the usual
enormous expense—at even distant
plº, where its activities, or the
result of them, can be studied. For
example, we are shown a section of
the Front and the delight of the English
soldier as he unfolds the paper and dis-
covers that his country is still being
goaded towards that healthy disinte-
gration which must necessarily accel-
erate our victory. And we are even
shown one of the paper's defeated can-
didates seeking the railway-station
after the election; for it is notorious
that, vast as are the paper's other influ-
ences, it is often unable to persuade an
electorate to follow it.
The last picture, which also should
be of particular interest to the public
as proving how sacred the Fourth
Estate holds the duty of providing it
with accurate reports, shows the whole
of the building draped with the habili-
ments of woe and the staff in deep

said Bertha. “I know her knock.”
“Don’t always look on the dark side
of things,” I counselled; “be an op-

that she has come to pay back what

A minute later Bertha returned. “I

that an act is not a chapter of a

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I would heartily commend to all good English women
and men The Book of Italy (UNwiN), first because it will
help the families of those Italians who have left England
to join their ships and regiments and will make possible
the works of mercy of the Italian Red Cross, and secondly
because it is in itself an admirable book—the most dis-
tinguished, I think, of any of its kind published here during
the War. It tells us something of the great Italian creators
and liberators, DANTE, LEONARDO, Michel,ANGELO, MAz-
ZINI, GARIBALDI, CAvou R—too little perhaps of MAZZINI,
than whom no movement for liberty ever had a nobler or
a saner prophet. Of the good things, besides the contri-
butions of distinguished. Italians (a particularly interesting
noſe on the Italian Red Cross by Signor GALANTE claims
a Neapolitan, FERDINANDo PALASCIANo, as the pioneer,
in 1848, of the Red Cross idea), let me specially commend
the spirited introduction of Lord BRYcE, the eloquent
letter of SABATIER, the memories of FREDERIC HARRIsoN,
the quiet wisdom of CLUTToN-BRock, the learning (decently
veiled for normal eyes) of FRAzER, of The Golden Bough;
the inspired prejudices, fringed with epigram, of G. K. C.
A mere catalogue of a few of the well-known writers
represented, of SYMoNs, GALsworthy, GILBERT MURRAY,
BAGoT, Hich ENs, BARRY PAIN, PHILLPotts ; and of artists
such as BRANGwyN, SARGENT, SHANNoN, John, LAVERY,
RICHMOND, Poynter, FRAMPtox, RICKETTs, ANNING BELL,
CAYLEY Robinson, makes its best testimonial. England
has never been other than the friend of modern Italy, for
the Triple Alliance was merely a freak of desperate diplo-
macy and was broken by the popular will when Germany (be
it remembered) was giving fair promise of ultimate victory.
We don't need conversion to the cause of Italy, but every-
thing that helps to foster and develop the comradeship of
the new Risorgimento of the Allied Nations is welcome.
And The Book of Italy will serve this purpose excellently
well.
More than once before now I have commented upon
that almost unique gift that Mr. JACK LoNDON has of
transferring physical energy to fiction. His characters
must always be about some sinew-straining business that
makes the reader ache in sympathy. However in The
Little Lady of the Big House (MILLS AND Boos) the author
seems to have allowed himself and his creations an un-
wonted holiday. Here is no fierce struggle for existence,
but the fruits of it upon a millionaire ranche in California.
Dick Forrest was the millionaire, by heritage and his own
success; a great farmer and a breeder of shires. He had a
wife, the Little Lady of the title, and a Big House that was
one of the most eligible dwellings in fiction. A plain recital
of the arrangements (“tweaks" we should have called them
at school) in Dick's open-air bedroom makes the ordinary
home look like ten cents. Mr. LoNDON certainly knows
how to luxuriate when he gives his mind to it. Moreover
there was a wonderful swimming-bath, with a concealed
submarine chamber in which the Little Lady used to hide
for the terror of uninstructed guests (she was rather that

really all the tale. Eventually the flirtation becomes serious DAMPIER might very justly retort that this is but fidelity
and the Little Lady is driven to suicide, with a death scene to life. When in the early chapters we see the first hero
of rather unconvincing sentiment. The fact is, I am afraid, turned from home by an unsympathetic parent, and
that Capuan ease does not altogether suit the super-faring forth to seek romance in a new world, it was
strenuous beings whom Mr. JACK LoNDoN designs. They are surely reasonable to suppose that he would eventually be
too energetic for it, and, lacking an outlet, tend to become rewarded by the pretty lady of the wrapper, especially as
melodramatic. I hope that next time he will take us back
to the muscle-grinding.
When the War broke out Mr. F. W. WILE, an American
gentleman, was living in Berlin as the correspondent of
The Daily Mail. Having read his book, The Assault
(HEINEMANN), I may say that I judge him to be singularly
alert and wide-awake and admirably fitted for the position
he occupied. He has no scintilla ſt
of hatred or animosity for the
German people as individuals,
but he wishes to see Germany
beaten. “I wish her beaten.”
he says, “for the Allies' sake
and for my own country's sake.
A victorious Germany would be
a menace to international liberty
and become automatically a
threat to the happiness and
freedom of the United States.”
He saw the furious transports
of patriotism and hatred to
which the Berlin mob gave
way; he witnessed the brutal
attack on the British Embassy,
and he was himself denounced
as an English spy, was arrested
and was lodged in jail, º
he was rescued only by the
direct interposition of the Ame-
rican Ambassador. All these
incidents he relates in a very
vivid way and with a certain
dry humour that adds to the
effect. His description of the
manner in which, on his way
to prison in a taxi with two
German policemen, he managed

Savile Brand (though his name inevitably suggests tobacco)
is a eharacter drawn with understanding and skill. But
Mr. SMITH-DAMPIER is good at lovers. He has another,
even better, up his sleeve. This is Peter, the forty-year-
old American cousin, who cherishes a tender regard for
Mistress Cordelia. I should explain that all this happened
in the time of powder, lace coats, and witches. This last
is important. Those were the days when Cherchez la
Tº sorcière was the unfailing re-
medy in New England for every
ill, material or emotional. It is
from this, coupled with the mis-
taken jealousy of her sister, that
Cordelia's troubles come, and so
nearly turn her story to tragedy.
The main motive may remind
you a little of that grim play
of witchcraft that we saw at
the St. James's Theatre some
years ago. But fortunately
the end is more comfortable.
Cordelia, in short, is a
nicely-flavoured romance of old
America, with at least three
unusually well-drawn characters
to give it substance. I have no
doubt at all of its success.

captors with rage and suspicion. Certainly a delightful
people. Finally he was allowed to leave Berlin and travel
to England as a member of Sir Edward GoschEN's party.'
In the later portion of this book Mr. WILE castigates us, not
too unkindly, but, perhaps, a little too insistently, for not
being ready, for not realising what war means and for being
too self-complacent. Since his criticisms are based on affec-
tion for us we can make an effort to kiss the rod, especially
as he discerns signs of improvement in us. Incidentally
I may add that he is, perhaps, not altogether fair to Lord
HALDANE, but, per contra, he gives Lord NorthcLIFFE a
high testimonial to character and behaviour.
Cordelia (MELRose) is a story as agreeable as its name,
or as the pretty, if rather chocolate-box-school, picture on
its wrapper. One small defect I find in the dissipation of its
interest. Beginning with one hero, it goes on with another;
" _ _ ___i was to arrive at a sympathetic
understanding of the people with whom she had to deal, and,
without a hint of patronage, to be of service to them. It is
impossible to read of the work she did and helped to do
during the last dozen years or so without recognising how
possible it is to be official and still remain very human. In
spite of little outbursts of opinion which refuse to be sup-
pressed, Lady Poone is as discreet as the most censorious
of censors could desire. One of her anecdotes—for the
most part well told and fresh—is as funny a tale as I have
ever encountered; but I will leave you to find it for yourself.
Altogether a book to thank the gods for.
“On the way to Berea, Mr. Lloyd George met the Rector of the
parish, and both cordially shook hands.”—Scotsman.
Are we to infer that as a rule, when these two gentlemen
meet, only one of them shakes hands?

MY DEAR CHARLEs, There comes a
time in the life of the military motor
when, owing to one thing or another
(but mostly another), it becomes a
casualty and retires, on the ground of
ill-health, to the Base. As such it is
towed into the nearest workshops; but,
before it departs to the Base there
arrive, from all corners of the Army
area, drivers of other similar motors,
coming, as you might say, “for a pur-
pose.” These are the vultures who
have got to hear of the affair, are sorry
indeed that such mishaps should occur,
but, stifling their sorrow, see their way
to snaffle some little benefit for them-
selves.
One vulture will come to exchange
old lamps for new, another to IT
do a deal in magnetos, and a
third, may be, to better him-
self in the matter of wheels.
There will be some squabbling,
and, when the work is done,
the last state of that casualty
will be worse than the first, -
and it will proceed to the
| Base a melancholy collection
of all the most dilapidated
parts in the area, for which
even the most optimistic
authority at the back of be-
yond will see no useful future.
Yesterday the following in-
terview took place at my i.
office, which is also my little
home and is very handsomely
and elaborately furnished with
a system of boxes, some to sit
on, some to write on and some
to go to sleep in. t
“An officer to see you, Sir,” said
the orderly, and in there came a
representative from Signals who was
pleased to meet me. I put aside my
work in order to deal with him politely,
firmly and once and for all.
“If,” I said haughtily, “you are the
gentleman who rings me up on the
telephone every morning at 7 A.M., goes
on ringing me up till I creep to the
instrument and murmur “Hello!” and
then tells me that is all and will I
please ring off, then I too am glad we
have met at last."
He denied the suggestion so hotly
that I unbent a little. I asked him to
be seated, and offered him a part of my
bed for the purpose. -
“It's like this,” he began.
“Is it 2" said I. “Then no doubt
you want me to sign an Army Form
and take all the responsibility?”
“For what ?” he asked.
“I’m sure I don't know,” I an-
swered ; “and it doesn’t much matter,
for I shall only pass it on to someone
else, please.”
For once it wasn't an Army Form.
Was I not, he ventured to ask, the
proprietor of a small car 2
“What was once a small car before
it met what was once a large telegraph
pole,” I said thoughtlessly.
He was glad to hear this, as he too
was the owner of a small car. We
shook hands on that, though we knew
all the time that H.M. Government
was the owner of both. H.M. Govern-
ment not being present, however, to
insist on its rights, we were able to
do a quiet swank. In the course of it
he mentioned, quite by the way, the
matter of shock-absorbers. He had rea-
son to believe that my car could spare
his car a couple of these.
I saw the need for hedging. “That

HIS HAVING RASHLY SUNK THE ENTIRE BRITISH FLEET AT AN
EARLY STAGE OF THE WAR.
telegraph pole I mentioned just now
wasn't really very large,” I explained,
“and it came away quietly, offering no
resistance.” -
He smiled knowingly at that.
“Were you,” I continued, fixing a cold
and relentless eye upon him—“were
you equally lucky with your—your—?”
“Small lorry,” he said, with a faint
blush. “A tiny lorry, in fact.”
“Not more than a dozen tons or so?”
I suggested. “No doubt it passed
quite gradually over you, frightening
more than hurting you, and you were
able to walk home with remainder
of small motor in pocket of great-
coat 2"
He didn't go into that subject. “By
the way,” he said, “I happened to be
round at the workshops just now—”
“Did you, indeed 2 " I took him up.
“Then let me tell you at once that the
wreckage in the workshop's yard was
not my small car, so you may abandon
any hopes you had built upon that.”
. . . TB Roc Hº - ... :
He appeared to be surprised at the
attitude I adopted.
“No,” he said slowly—“no, I knew
that wasn't your car.”
I thought rapidly. “It was yours,”
I hazarded, “and your idea was to
re-equip that battered wreck at the
expense of my very slightly injured
property?”
He smiled shamelessly.
“You are a most unscrupulous
officer,” I said, “and I'm beginning
to think you are the voice which gets
me out of bed—I mean, interrupts my
work—every morning at dawn.”
“No, really,” he replied, glad to have
something to be honest about. “At
that hour I am always in—at work
myself.”
We shook hands again on that and I
offered him a cigarette.
“Have one of mine,” said he.
“No, no,” I pressed; “you
have one of mine.”
Again, if the truth had been
admitted, H.M. Government
was the rightful owner of
both. :
“Of course,” he explained,
“you saw my little 'bus from
quite its worst aspect in that
yard.”
I was for getting to busi-
|ness. “I want,” said I, “a
back axle-shaft, a head-light,
a wind-screen and some mud-
guards. What's yours?”
“I could do with a spare
wheel-holder, a horn, a couple
of yards of foot-board,” he
said. “Two shock-absorbers
an. at least one wheel I must
have.”
A little discussion proved
that between us we could put up a
very decent car. The only difficulty
arose from a doubt as to what was to
happen when we went out in it. It
would still be a two-seater, and neither
of our chauffeurs was small enough to
be carried in the tool-box. Who was
going to drive, who was going to sit by
and, when occasion demanded, step out
and do the dirty work 2 Neither of
us seeing his way to give in on these
points, we had to think of some other
solution.
“You mentioned the workshops just
now,” I said. “Were you going on to
say that the officer in charge told you
of another small car which was in
trouble 2."
“He did,” said Signals.
“Same here,” said I. “Did he then
recommend you to get what you
wanted off that other car 2"
“He did,” said Signals.
“Same here,” said I. “And did
you also ascertain that this officer in

“I did,” said Signals.
“Same here,” said I.
out and look for that—”
“Officer in charge,” said Signals.
“No,” said I, “his car.” I felt that
we were justified, in the circumstances,
in dividing it between us.
But there is no limit to these officers
in charge of workshops. We had the
greatest difficulty in finding his car at
all, and, when we did, it had the
appearance of being deliberately con-
cealed. Worse still ; when we found
the car we found also a sentry standing
over it, with rifle and fixed bayonet.
Though we took this to be a direct
insult to ourselves, we were too proud
to go and expostulate with the officer
himself about it.
Yours ever,

HENRY.
A LETTER.
(From Captain Claude Seaforth to a
novelist friend.)
MY DEAR MAN, You asked me to
tell you if anything very remarkable
came my way. I think I have a story
for you at last. If I could only write
I would make something of it myself,
but not being of Kitchener's Army I
can't.
The other day, while I was clearing
up papers and accounts and all over
ink, as I always get, the Sergeant came
to me, looking very rum. “Two young
fellows want to see you,” he said.
Of course I said I was too busy and
that he must deal with them.
“I think you'd rather see them your-
self,” he said, with another odd look.
“What do they want?” I asked.
“They want to enlist,” he said; “but
they don't want to see the doctor.”
We’ve had some of these before—
consumptives of the bull-dog breed, you
know. Full of pluck but no mortal use;
“done in ’’ on the first route march.
“Why don't you tell them that they
must see the doctor and have done
with it?” I asked the Sergeant.
Again he smiled queerly. “I made
sure you'd rather do it yourself,” he
said. “Shall I send them in 2''
So I wished them further and said
“Yes;” and in they came.
They were the prettiest boys you
ever saw in your life—too pretty. One
had red hair and the other black, and
they were dressed like navvies. They
held their caps in their hands.
“What's this rubbish about not
seeing a doctor 2 " I asked. You know
my brutal way.
“We thought perhaps it could be
dispensed with,” Red Hair said, draw-
ing nearer to Black Hair.

“Only what?”
“Only- Here they looked at
each other, and Red Hair said, “Shall

and they both came closer to me.
“Will you promise,” said Red Hair,
“that you will treat as confidential

“So long as it is nothing dangerous

“We want to fight for our country,”
Red Hair began.
“No one wants to fight more,” Black

continued.
“I won a cup for lawn-tennis at
Devonshire Park,” Black Hair added.
“But,” said Red Hair.
“Yes?” I replied.
“Don’t you believe in some women
being as strong as men?”
“Certainly,” I said.
“Well then,” said Red Hair, “that's

like us. We are as strong as lots of
men and much keener, and we want
you to be kind to us and let us enlist.”
“We'll never do anything to give
ourselves away,” said Black fair; ut,
bless her innocent heart, she was
giving herself away all , the time.
Every moment was feminine.
“My dear young ladies,” I said at
last, “I think you are splendid and an
example to the world but what you
ask is impossible. Have you thought
for a moment what it would be like
to find yourselves in barracks with the
ordinary British soldier 2 He is a
brave man and, when you meet him
alone, he is nearly always a nice man;
but collectively he might not do as
company for you."
“But look at this,” said Red Hair,
showing me a newspaper-cutting about
a group of Russian girls known as
“The Twelve Friends,” who have been
through the campaign and were treated
with the utmost respect by the soldiers.
“And there's a woman buried at
Brighton,” said Black Hair, “who
fought as a man for years and lived to
be a hundred.”
“And think of JoAN of ARC," said
Red Hair.
“And BoADICEA,” said Black Hair.
“Well,” I said, “leaving JoAN of
ARC and BoADICEA aside, possibly those
Russians and that Brighton woman
looked like men, which it is certain
you don't. But any way we must be
serious. What would your people
say?”
“We left word,” said Red Hair,
“that we were going off to do some-
thing for our country. They won't
worry. Oh, please be kind and help
us !” -
Here all four of their beautiful eyes
grew moist.
I could have hugged both of them,
but I kept an iron hand on myself.
“You nice absurd creatures,” I said,
“do be reasonable. To begin with,
passing the doctor is an absolute
necessity. That shuts you out. But
even if you got through how do
you think you would be helping your
country 2 All the men would be fall-
ing in love with you ; and that's bad
enough as it is after working hours;
it would be the ruin of discipline. And
you could not bear the fatigue. No,
go back and learn to be nurses and let
your lovely hair grow again.”
They were very obstinate and very
unwilling to entertain the thought of
drudgery such as nursing after all their
dreams of excitement ; but at last they
came to reason, and I sent for a cab
and packed them off in it (I simply
could not bear the idea of other people
seeing them in that masquerade), and
told them that the sooner they changed
the better.
After they had gone the Sergeant
came in about something.
I said nothing, and he said nothing,
each of us waiting for the other.
He moved about absolutely silently,
and I dared not meet his glance because
I knew I should give myself away.
The rascal has not been running his
eye over young women all these years
without being able to spot them in a
moment, even in navvy's clothes.
At last I could stand it no longer.
“Damn it,” I said, “what are you
doing? Why don't you go? I didn't
send for you.” But still I didn't dare
look up. .
“I thought perhaps you had some-
thing to say to me, Sir," he said.
“No, I haven't,” I replied. “Why
should I? What about 2."
“Only about those two young men,
Sir,” he replied.
“Get out,” I said ; but before he
could go I had burst into laughter.
“Better not mention it,” I managed
to say.
He promised.
There—won't you find that useful?
Yours, C. S.
A VERY RARE BIRD.
Brown lives next door but one to
me. His speciality is birds, and he
must be a frightful nuisance to them.
I shouldn't care to be a bird if Brown
knew where my nest was. It isn't
that he takes their eggs. If he would
merely rob them and go away it
wouldn't matter so much. They could
always begin again after a decent in-
terval. But a naturalist of the modern
school doesn't want a bird's eggs; he
wants to watch her sitting on them.
Now sitting is a business that demands
concentration, a strong effort of the
will and an undistracted mind. How
on earth is a bird to concentrate when
she knows perfectly well that Brown,
disguised as a tree or a sheep or a
haycock, is watching her day after
day for hours at a stretch and snap-
shotting her every five minutes or so
for some confounded magazine 2 In
nine cases out of ten she lets her
thoughts wander and ends half un-
consciously by posing, with the result
that most of her eggs don't hatch out.
Brown has a highly-trained sense of
hearing. You and I, of course, possess
pretty good ears for ordinary purposes.
We can catch as soon as anyone else
that muffled midnight hum, as of a
distant threshing-machine beneath a
blanket, which advertises the approach
of the roaming Zepp. From constant
practice, too, we have learnt, sitting in
our drawing-room or study, to dis-
tinguish the crash of the overturned
nursery table upstairs from the duller,
less resonant thud of baby's head as
it strikes the floor. But can we posi-
tively state from the note of the black-
bird at the bottom of the garden
whether it has three, four or five eggs
in its nest, or indeed if it is a house-
holder at all ? No, we cannot ; but
Brown can.
Even specialists, however, occasion-
ally make mistakes. A day or two
ago, just as dusk was falling, Brown
entered my house in a state of con-
siderable excitement and informed me
that a pair of reed-warblers were build-
ing in my orchard. *
“Are you sure?” I asked.
“Quite,” he replied. “I have not
actually seen the birds yet, but I have
heard them from my own garden, and
of course the note of the nesting reed-
warbler is unmistakable.”
“Of course,” I agreed.
“It is a most extraordinary occur-
rence,” he continued, “most extra-
ordinary.”
“You mean because there are no
reeds there 2 ”
“Exactly.”
I was quite certain in my own mind
that there were no reed-warblers either,
but I felt it would be impertinent for
a layman like myself to argue with
Brown. -
“There!” he exclaimed, darting to
the open window. “Can't you hear it?"
I listened. “Oh, that,” I said;
“that's—” -
“The mating song of the male reed-
warbler,” interrupted Brown ecstati-
cally. “Now, whatever happens, don't
let them be disturbed. Don't even try
to find the nest, or you may alarm
them. Leave it all to me. I shan't
have a free morning till Saturday,
but there's no hurry. I'll bring my
camera round then, and when I've
located the spot they're building in
I'll rig up a hiding-place and take
some photos. Don't let anybody go
near them ; the great thing is to make
them feel quite at home.” He was
gone before I could explain.
It is rather an awkward situation,
because, when Brown comes on Satur-
day morning, I am afraid that if he
secures any really successful photos
they will prove a disappointment to
him. They will represent my gardener,
Williams, trundling a barrow, the wheel
of which is badly in need of oil.

Whom anxious folk sent forth to spy the foe,
But he came back and cried, “The lilac's out !

And whether I'm in touch with whom ;

Tuesday, May 2nd.—The House of

this afternoon. Members filled the
benches and overflowed into the galler.
ies, and many Peers looked down upon
the scene, among them Lord GRENFELL,
formerly Commander-in-Chief in Ire-
land, and Lord MAcDoNNELL, once
Under-Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant.
All were curious to learn what the PRIME
MINISTER would have to say about
the painful events of the past week.
Would he announce that the Govern-
ment, conscious of failure, had decided
to resign en bloc & Or would it be
merely pruned and strengthened by
the lopping of a few of the obviously
weaker branches 2 -
Nothing of the sort. Mr. Asquith
made the barest allusion to the sur-
render of Kut—an inci-
dent which was “not one
of serious military signifi-
cance.” As for the in-
surrection in Dublin, there
would be a debate upon
it as soon as the Govern-
ment had completed its
enquiries. The main pur-
pose of his speech was
to announce that the
Government had decided
to introduce a Bill for
general compulsion, and
to get rid of the piece-
meal treatment of recruit-
ing to which the House
had objected. Members
were, I think, hardly pre-
pared for the vigour with
which the PRIME MINISTER
turned upon his critics, reminding them
that just the same denunciation of
from considerations of political expedi-
ency rather than military necessity, no
one seemed to be convinced that the
Government even now quite knew its
own mind. -
The House of Lords, after listening
to a moving tribute to the memory
of Lord St. ALDwyN from his old col-
league, Lord LANSDown E, settled down
to a debate on the new Order in Coun-
cil prohibiting references to Cabinet
secrets. It met with equal condem-

BURNHAM as a practical journalist.
The Ministers who “blabbed ” were the
real criminals. Lord BURNHAM recom-

retain his self-control.

to him : “I do not know whether to con-

I think it is the latter.”
It was an easy guess, but its con-
firmation took an unusually long time.
Indeed, at one moment it looked as if
Mr. BIRRELL would escape the almost
invariable fate of Irish Secretaries, and
leave Dublin with his political repu-
tation enhanced. When he had placed

that had baffled his predecessors since
the Union, he might have sung his
Nunc Dimittis in a halo.
Perhaps he was not sufficiently am-
bitious to demand release; perhaps
mone of his colleagues was anxious to
take his job ; perhaps the Nation-
alist leader insisted on keeping him
in the silken fetters of office as a host-
age for Home Rule. Anyhow, the
|opportunity was missed; and thence-
forward Nemesis dogged his track.
Two years ago it seemed that Ulster
would be his stumbling-block. The
War saved him from that, but only to
bring him down through more sinister
instruments. In his pathetic apology
this aſternoon he con-
fessed that he had failed
to estimate accurately the
strength of the Sinn Fein
movement. He might
have been wrong in not
suppressing it before, but
his omission to do so was
due to a consuming desire
to keep Ireland's front
united in face of the com-
mon foe.
This frank admission of
error would in any case
have disarmed hostile criti-
cism; but its effect was
strengthened by the un-
seemly interjections with
which Mr. GINNELL ac-
companied it. If the
Member for Westmeath
is a sample of the sort of persons with
whom the CHIEF SECRETARY had to deal,
no wonder that he failed to understand
the lengths to which they would go.
Mr. REDMoND, obviously disgusted
by the pranks of his nominal sup-
porter, chivalrously shouldered part of
the blame that Mr. BIRRELL had taken
upon himself; and even Sir Edward
CARson, though a life-long and bitter
opponent of his policy, was ready to
admit that he had been well-intentioned
and had done his best.
Later on, when the PRIME MINISTER
had introduced the new Military Ser-
vice Bill, establishing compulsion for
all men married or single, Colonel CRAIG
made a vain appeal to Mr. REDMoND
to get the measure extended to Ireland.
Nothing would do more to show the
world that the recent rebellion was
only the work of an insignificant
section of the Irish people.

ready a week ago to impart secrets of
State with which the Press was not
deemed fit to be trusted, I gather that
he has other sources of information
which he considers much more trust-
worthy. Among various tit-bits with
which he regaled the House this after-
noon was a suggested reason why
British aircraft have not yet bombarded
Essen. He has his suspicions that it is
because members of the British Cabinet
have shares in some of Frau KRUPP's
subsidiary companies.
Most people know that all leave from
the Front was stopped just before
Easter, and have hitherto assumed
that the stoppage was due to the
exigencies of the military situation.
To Mr. PETo, an earnest seeker after
truth, as befits his name, Mr. TENNANT
admitted that there was another reason.
Last year, it seems, some returning
warriors got so much mixed up in the
congested Easter traffic that they never
reached home at all, so this year the
authorities resolved to keep them out
of the danger-zone.
The Government welcomes any sug-
gestion that may help to win the War.
Mr. EUGENE WAsoN's latest idea is
that if the War Office and the Admiralty
of the Labour Party. Altogether, Sir
John SIMON and his friends mustered
were to put their heads together they just three dozen, and the Second Read-
might make it easier for outdoor artists
in Cornwall to obtain permits to pur-
sue their studies, at present restricted,
in military areas; and Mr. TENNANT
assured him that this important matter
was still “under consideration.”
The Second Reading of the Military
Service Bill brought forth some rather
trite arguments from Mr. Holt and
other opponents of compulsion, and a for we fear we shall not look upon his like
lively defence from Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
who thoroughly enjoyed the oppor-
tunity, after a long silence, of being
able to speak his mind without fear of
complications with his colleagues.
With examples drawn from France and
the American Civil War he argued that
compulsory service was an essential
incident of true democracy. But an
even more effective backing for the Bill
came from Mr. ARTHUR HENDERSON.
Hitherto, according to his own descrip-
tion, “the heaviest drag-weight of the
Cabinet,” he now lent it increased
momentum, and carried with him into
the Lobby all but nine of his colleagues

majority of 292.

upbraid -

When you hear the defence of the fashion-plate maid
I'm perfectly certain you'll pardon us;
Though our heels and our hose and our frills and our

Regardless of taste and expense,
Your notion of war-time economy shocks;
We're doing our bit, in a sense.
Now take, for example, Irene and me;
She's thin and I’m rather—voluminous;
Our skirts, full and frilly, just cover the knee,
And our hose-play discourages gloominess;
We've a bent for a i. with a soul-stirring spat,
Gilt-buttoned and stubbily toed,
And a top-gallant plume on a tip-tilted hat
When we're ripe for the Park and the road.
The public each week, Mr. Punch, you impress
With your cool-headed wit and ability,
So I wonder you've not had the gumption to guess
There's method in our imbecility;
Read on, and your premature chiding deplore,
For our merciful mission, in brief,
Is to brighten the tragical drama of war
By providing the comic relief.

IF I were like a man I know and BILLING were my name,
I wouldn't waste my precious time in striving after fame;
I'd let it come to me unsought, unstruggled for, and then
I'd just go on existing as a perfect specimen.
No care would line my marble brow; I'd take no thought
of pelf;
I'd lie the long day through at ease a-thinking of myself;
For when a man's mere presence lends to any scene delight
He needn't worry what he does—whate'er he does is right.
If I could bloom as blooms the rose, and BILLING were a bee,
With all my pink and petalled force I'd coax him unto me;
I'd open out my honeyed store, and he might linger on,
Or cut and cut and come again until the whole were gone.
Such heaps of charm our BILLING has, such tons of savoir

It irks me much to see him spend his treasures on the air;
And, still to hint a further fault, he cultivates the pose
Of knowing all of everything, and lets you know he knows.

THE LUCKIEST MAN.
WE were talking, the other night,
about lucky people. Barmer declared
that he knew the man (of whom we
had all of us heard) who was left a
large fortune by an eccentric old gentle-
man whose hat he had picked up on
a windy day at Brighton. A better
and more original contribution to
the discussion was that of Bastable,
a retired Anglo-Indian. I give it as
nearly as I can in his own words.
“The luckiest man I ever met,” he
said, “is my groom-gardener, Andrews.
I don't mean to say in respect of pros-
perity or health, for he is a delicate
man, and I can only afford to give
him a modest wage. But he has a
charmed life, as you will admit when
you hear of his three escapes.
“Number 1 was when he was em-
ployed in repairing the roof of one of
the big London stations. He was
slung up in a cradle when he lost
his balance and fell to the ground—a
distance of about 80 feet. The odds
were about a million to one that he
would be killed, but he managed to
light on precisely the one spot in the
whole station area which secured him
a soft fall—a barrel of butter which
was standing on the platform, and from
which, for some reason or other, the
lid had been removed. The butter
was ruined, but Andrews escaped with
a bad shaking. I believe the butter-
merchant brought an action against
the Company, but I forget what hap-
ned.
“Number 2 grew out of Andrews's
weakness for parrots. He had bought
a parrot from a sailor, who told him
that the best way to teach it to speak
was to hang the cage in a well and
repeat the words or phrases to it at
3 A.M. in the morning, so as to secure
the greatest freedom from disturbance.
Andrews was then employed in a brew-
ery at Watford, and lived in a cottage
with a strip of garden at the back.
There was also a well, so that he could
carry out the sailor's instructions on
the spot. The cage, which was a large
one and nearly filled the well, was
made fast to the bucket apparatus, and
the first two lessons passed off without
any incident. But on the third night,
when Andrews was hard at work, he
was hailed by a policeman, who came
along the lane at the side of the garden
—it was an end house—and asked him
what he was doing. When Andrews said
that he was teaching his parrot to talk,
the policeman, naturally suspecting that
he was there for some felonious pur-
pose, climbed over the wall and made
a grab at him. It was a dark night,
and, in trying to dodge the policeman,

WE do want AN AIR MINISTER, AND No Mistake, witH
THINGS LIKE YOU FLOATIN’ ABAHT IN THE SKY.”
Andrews stepped into the well, which,
according to his account, was ninety
feet deep. But, as good luck would
have it, he got jammed between the
cage and the side of the well, and re-
mained hung up until the policeman
hauled him out with the aid of the
bucket rope. He was badly bruised,
but got all right in a few days.
“Andrews's third and last escape
was in the War. He was a reservist,
went out early, saw a lot of fighting
and came through without a scratch
till last November, when his trench
was rushed and he was taken prisoner.
The front trenches at that point were
only about forty yards apart, and before
he was removed to the rear a British
shell lit close to him and blew him
back into his own lines. He was badly
hurt and, after some months in hos-
pital, was invalided out of the Army,
but manages to do the light work I
want all right.” -
We all subscribed to Bastable's view
of Andrews's luck—all at least except
Barmer, who was a little nettled at
having his story eclipsed. “I can be-
lieve the yarn about the shell,” he said,
“but the butter story is a bit thick, and
all tales about parrots are suspect.”

THERE were four on each side. At
the last moment a short round man
came running up and got in. Hurry
had not improved his mood, and one
glance of his eye was enough to make
me move along two inches to give him
room. He stood arranging his luggage
on the rack, pulled his coat straight,
and sat down—on the other side. The
suddenness of his assault was terrific.
I quickly recovered my two inches, and
the journey to the next station was
quite pleasant, so far as I was con-
cerned.
He and I were then left alone.
“I am much obliged to you for
moving to make room for me, Sir,” he
said politely. “But when I get into

In O.W.
AT THE PLAY.
“PEN.”
DURING one of the intervals which
served so well to eke out the brief two
hours of Mr. VACHELL's new “comedy,”
and were quite as good as many things
in the play, I allowed my mind—an
absolute blank—to dwell upon certain
arresting features in the stage curtain
of the St. James's Theatre. In the
centre, imposed upon a design whose
significance I do not pretend to pene-
trate, is a gigantic wreath encircling a
monogram of the magic initials, G. A.,
which are surmounted by something
which I took to be an heraldic top-hat.
This headpiece is in turn surmounted
by an heraldic eagle—the ordinary
arrangement by which the helmet ap-
pears above the coat-of-arms being thus
reversed. The central design is flanked
on each side by two other wreaths,
massive but subordinate. Within the
sinister wreath is enshrined in Greek
capitals the letters ALEX, and within
the dexter wreath the letters ANDROS.
“Reading from left to right” we have
here the historic name of the Mace-
donian monarch. •.
I cannot account for the Greek form
of the name on the ground that the
St. James's Theatre is the home of the
Classical Drama, for the themes of its
plays seldom go back beyond the later
decades of the 19th century A.D., and
I can only conclude that it is meant
to indicate that the conquests of Sir
GEORGE ALEXANDER's company resem-
ble those of the famous phalanx of his
namesake, the Great.
Most theatres have an atmosphere
of their own, and it would be hard to
recall any play at the St. James's that
has been less in keeping with the local
climate than this comedy, so described,
of Mr. VACHELL’s. On the score of im-
propriety and improbability it might
in the old days have appealed to the
Criterion management; but its lack of
broad humour must havenegatived these
advantages. . In any case Sir GEORGE
ALEXANDER's house was no place for a
farce so out of harmony with Mace-
donian methods.
Almost its solitary interest lay in
the doubt, maintained to the last
moment, as to which of its many
fatuous males would turn out to be
the hero—meaning by hero the chosen
husband of the heroine, for none of
them had any personal claim to the
title. Indeed, the choice ultimately
fell upon the one that had the least
distinctive personality of all, his dis-
guise being kept up by a kind of
protective colourlessness.
But for Miss ELLIs JEFFREYs, who
played the aunt of the preposterous
Lady Pen with a courage worthy of a
better cause, and extracted from the
play such humour as it held for her,
matters would have gone badly for
those of us who have been accustomed
to look to Mr. VACHELL for entertain-
ment. Mr. ALLAN AYNEsworth, as the
heroine's guardian, had no difficulty in
transmitting pleasantly enough his mild
share of the fun. Miss MARIE HEMING-
wAY needed all her prettiness to make
up for the futility of her part. And I
was really sorry that so sound an
actor as Mr. DAwson MILWARD should
have had such ineffective stuff put into
his mouth. -
Far the funniest thing about the play
was the fact that so clever and experi-
enced a writer should have made it.
Perhaps the compliments I have paid
to my friend Mr. WACHELL in these
columns have given me the right to
beg him not to take advantage of his
many recent successes and palm off on
the public just any kind of banality.
For these are days when pens (with or
without a big P) must be pretty good if
they are to compete with the sword.
With this appeal (and with a silent
prayer that the play may not come by
a natural death in time for my homily
to serve as a funeral appreciation) I
hasten to conclude, hoping that it will
find him in the pink (as they say)
of a blushful remorse; and, anyhow, I

are both atmospheric and, for their length, astonishingly
full of character. Also she has an engaging habit of avoid-

book, called “John,” for instance. It is the slightest possible

shallow cruel-brained girl eight years older than himself,
who is in process of getting engaged to an eligible bachelor.
But every figure in the little group lives. And the second

refreshing originality. I doubt if there are many writers
who would have finished off the story in her very satis-

of the tales—a feeling for middle-age in men and women;
many of them seem to be variations upon the same theme
of a love that comes by waiting. Mrs. DUDENEY can
handle this situation with unfailing charm. Her confessed

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXXIX.
(From JAMEs J. S 11 to NT.I.E, of New York City.)
KAIs ER WILLIAM, I guess you 'll remember who I am
when I tell you that the Jay-Jay Lecture Agency and the
Pushalong Dramatic Show Company were invented by me
and that I'm the sole possessor of these two world-wide
organisations. I wasn't always in with the high-brow
crowd of the lecturing business. To tell you the truth I
spell out the word “pork" by touching the letters with his
snout on a big cardboard alphabet. He didn't last long.
Times were hard during his second winter, and—well, I
never knew till then how much bacon there is to a pig, even
when it's a learned one with six legs to it. It was always
some trouble tying on them two extra legs, and it was
nervous work watching them while the show was open to
see they didn't work loose. So on the whole I wasn't
altogether put into mourning when old six-legs joined the
dear departed and left me free to speculate in Mexican under which on the first day (new style) the actual number
dwarfs and a Bolivian giantess with a rich contralto voice.
After that we rose to lions and tigers and a very massive
elephant and a few comic bears and a gorilla from Africa.
It was profitable but tiring, and aſter I'd saved a dollar or
two I was able to retire from the Mammoth Antediluvian
Menagerie and devote myself to Lectures and the Pushalong
stunt, which is living pictures of an historic and improving
sort. So now you remember me, don't you ?
Well, the fact is, Kaiser, that a notion's come into my
head, and it's this. When peace comes with all its
horrors, you won't want to go on every day explaining to
the German people how you lost the War by being too
kind or by not having prepared yourself enough. And
you won't want to keep telling them why you spent so
much time over Verdun and why the British Fleet didn't
make things as easy and comfortable for you as you
reckoned it ought to have done. The German people won't
want to listen to talk of that kind. They've been there
ańd they'll know all about it without being told. No,
what you'll want to do will be to get into a new atmo-
sphere, with people all round you listening to you just as
if you were the only man in the world. You'll find all that
in the United States if you'll only put yourself in the
hands of the Jay-Jay Lecturing Agency and the Pushalong
Dramatic Show Company. We shall engage the halls and
get together the audiences by our unique system of adver-
tisements, and all you've got to do is to appear at the time
fixed and address the meeting for an hour to an hour and
a-half on such subjects as “Why Belgium started the
War,” and “How Serbia used Poison Gas,” and “A Dozen
Proofs that the Lusitania was Sunk by the British out of
Spite,” and “Turkey, the Saviour of the Armenians.”
There'll be plenty of others, but these four will do as a
good working basis, and we can fill out the list later on,
not forgetting the Monroe Doctrine and how Germany is
going to knock everyone who attacks it into pie.
Then, there can be living pictures of yourself, in all kinds
of uniforms, deciding reluctantly to issue an ultimatum, or
packing yout valise for the Front, or leading two millions
of men in a charge and bringing back four millions of
prisoners or setting an example to your people by eating
War-bread by the crumb. And then you can wind up the
evening's entertainment by showing yourself making a
speech in which you bring in that bit about the good old
German God who has always been your ally. And then
the audience will stream out very devoutly, and all of them
will shake you by the hand and say they're pleased to
meet you. I tell you, WILLIAM Hohi:NzoLLERN, it will
be great, and the dollars will come pouring in. Leave it all
to me, and I'll guarantee a success that 'll make you grate-
ful to me for ever. If we could only get Uncle FRANcis
Joseph to join—but no ; that might distract attention from
you, and it's you I'm banking on. All I ask is a miserable
twenty per cent. on the profits. Is it a bargain 2 -
Yours, JAMEs J. S.

[MAY 17, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
XIII.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Since landing
in India about 200 years ago we have
had many novel and remarkable ex-
periences, but I think in my case none
has been more strange and discon-
certing than my transformation into
a civilian or a dufter wallah (as we
who sit at desks are contemptuously
termed by the fighting men).
Table manners are a great trial to
me in my new employ. In barracks,
if you want bread, you merely shout
in the queer jargon of the British
soldier in India, “IIao up the roti
there !” You then duck quickly, brush
the crumbs out of your hair and get on
with the meal. As a civilian I have to
count ten, take myself firmly in hand,
prepare a courteous little speech and
deliver it with care and precision,
trying hard to avoid glancing over my
shoulder to see if a lump is likely to
catch me under the ear.
And every night, though it is now
over two months since I left the
regiment, I carefully feel the legs of
my bedstead before retiring to rest.
For in barrack life, when you lie down
unsuspectingly on a bed which has
been “set,” it instantly collapses into
a shapeless mass of wreckage and
shoots you out violently on the floor.
In the office itself my new life is
full of difficulties. Soon after my ar-
rival I thoughtlessly celebrated the
completion of a rather troublesome
task by bursting into song, as we
always did in barracks. Shortly
afterwards I received a frigidly polite
message from my superior officer,
saying, if I had any complaint to
make, would I be so good as to put
it into writing and to refrain from
any vocal advertisement of my griev-
anceS.
But even office life has its com-
pensations. There are moments of
pure delight, such as that in which
I discovered “Cemeteries " classified
under the general heading of “Ac-
commodation for Troops.”
And the Babu is always with us
to make our days joyful. Babu
Inglish is perhaps rather vieur jeu
at this time of day; nevertheless it
is a privilege to read on the spot
a supplication for permission to “pros-
tute myself daily to your holy feet
this time without fail whereby to
beseech to Heaven to send to your
Honour many posthumous olive
branches"; or a request that “your
Highness will not cause to nip in the
Bud my unworthy yet fragrant hopes
by the December cold snap of your
august displeasure.”
In conversation, excellent fellow as
he usually is, the Babu is easily mis-
understood. It was only yesterday
that one of them was giving me an
account of an old Sikh monk he had
come upon during a walk in the woods.
I had not known before that there
were monks among the Sikhs, but then
there are quite a number of facts
about India that I have yet to learn.
I had no difficulty in picturing the
aged hermit sitting at the foot of a tree
in a religious trance. But it seemed
strange that when the Babu ap-
proached he should have shown his
teeth and gibbered. This, however,
might be due to the eccentricity of
a recluse or to some caste difficulty.
I could not share the Babu's surprise
that he refused the acorns proffered
to him, but it did seem odd that when
the Babu callously shook his stick at
the old man and said “Huh !” he
swarmed with great agility up the tree
and made faces.
It was only when the limpness of
his tail was mentioned that I suddenly
realised we were talking about a sick
monkey.
Letters from the Battalion, 7000 feet
below, drift up to me occasionally, but
they contain little beyond the old sen-
timent, expressed hundreds of times
daily by Territorials from the Hima-
layas to the Nilghiris. India is a
marvellous and unique country; to
have lived in it is an education and a
joy; to have guarded it a proud
Imperial privilege. ' But most of us
would give something to get out of it
and into Europe. Yours ever,
ONE OF THE PUNCH BRIGADE.

LIEUTENANT ALEC J0 HNSTON.
A BROTHER-of-FICER attached to the
King's Shropshire Light Infantry writes
from the Front:-"I thought you would
like to hear some details of the death
in action of Lieutenant ALEC Johnston,
who used to write “At the Front' in
I’unch. I knew him well and we were
rather especial friends.
“On the night of the 21st of April
the Battalion, which was resting at
the time, was suddenly ordered to
attack some six hundred yards of
trenches which the enemy had taken
two nights previously. JohsstoN's
Company was in the centre, and, after
the O.C. had been severely wounded
just before we attacked, Johnstos led
the Company and captured the position
most gallantly with the bayonet. He
then went on himself and personally
reconnoitred the ground up to the
German line. He found them massing
for a counter-attack and came back
and gave warning. When the enemy
attacked they were driven off with
heavy loss. He was indefatigable all
night consolidating the recaptured
position, exposing himself on top all
the time in order to move about more
quickly.
“At dawn, he sent the only other
officer then remaining unwounded to
the safest part of the trench, saying
that when it got too light to stay on
top he himself would get into ‘the
first old crump hole.’
too long, and was shot through the
heart by a German sniper.
He stayed up
“He was a general favourite and
loved by his men. He had done more
dangerous patrol work than any two
other officers in the battalion, and the
hotter the situation the cooler he got.
“The way he used to write his
articles was very characteristic of the
man. I have seen him lying flat on his
face in a tiny dug-out no bigger or higher
than the underneath of a small dinner-
table, in the front line trench, dashing
off the first half of one of his quaint
articles to Punch. He would have to
stop in the middle and crawl out on
patrol up to the German wire, have a
scrap out there with a Bosch patrol at
a few }. range, stay out for two or ||
three hours, and crawl back, soaked to
the skin and covered with mud, to
finish his article in time for the post.
“His name had already gone in for
distinction, and if he had lived he cer-
tainly would have had a decoration con-
ferred for his work in this last show.
“As you probably know, his articles
were awfully appreciated by every one
out here, and in his quaintly witty
way he caught perfectly the spirit “at
the Front.' "

Monday, May 8th.--It was a relief
to pass from the sombre theme of
judgment passed on Irish rebels to the
quiet humours of Daylight - Saving.
Sir HENRY NorMAN was perhaps a
little over-anxious to be playful; and
some of his rather ancient jokes gave
obvious pain to Mr. PEARCE, who once
carried a Daylight-Saving Bill through
its second reading without any such
frivolous aids.
There was little opposition. Sir
FREDERICK BANBURY once more ap-
peared in his favourite character of the
conscientious objector. He was not
on this occasion “the champion of the
suffering rich,” as Mr. DURE called him
the other day, but the defender of the
humble milkman, who already had to
rise before dawn for the greater part of
the year, and might, I gathered, be
subject to unworthy suspicions if he
performed his functions before the
dew was off the grass. Lord HUGH
CECII, who thought the proposal to
put on the clock smacked of “the
tricks of the lowest class of journal-
ism,” is understood to have been refer-
ring to those remarkable examples of
advanced literature, the “6.30 Newt’s ”
and “7.0 Star.”
The INFANT SAMUEL, as my esteemed
predecessor used to call him, disclaimed
the idea that he had become “a pre-
sumptuous Joshua.” The Government
only supported the proposal because it
would help us during the War by saving
coal.
Sir HENRY DALzier, is the proprietor
of a newspaper, one of whose most
piquant features is a column entitled
“Secret IIistory of To-day,” in which
one may read dark hints of Society
scandals and political intrigues. Natu-
rally enough he objects to the new
regulation forbidding reference to the
proceedings of the Cabinet. He had
effective backing on this occasion from
Mr. WALTER Roch, who in a speech
admirable alike in tone and substance
appealed to the Government in their
own interests to withdraw a ukase,
under which, if strictly applied,
Ministers themselves would be the first
REPAIR, ETC., ETC., ETC.’’
to suffer. The Government lived too
much in a balloon (have they not just
appointed a quartette of lawyers to over-
haul the Royal Flying Corps ?), and
would be the better for anything that
brought them into closer touch with
their fellow-citizens.
After an excited protest by Mr.
O'BRIEN against the executions in
Ireland it was not, perhaps, a fortunate
moment for Sir John LoNSDALE to
suggest that the Military Service Bill
should be extended to Ireland. Mr.
Asquith was sympathetic in principle
to the idea, but made it plain that in
practice it was impossible, since Mr.
REDMoND was opposed to it. Sir
Edward CARson thought the fact de-
plorable while recognising its cogency;
but he suggested that if the Nationalist
leader was the indirect Governor of
Ireland he should be given the respon-
sibility instead of exercising it second-
hand. Mr. REDMoND promptly denied
that he had either power or responsi-
bility; otherwise the recent occurrences
in Ireland would, he alleged, not have

happened. Mr. CHURCHILL, now home
from the Front on unlimited leave,
drew from these two speeches the
inference that the future of Ireland
depended upon their authors sinking
their differences and acting together,
and expressed the sanguine view that
the Irish Question was nearing a settle-
ment. Members, recalling similarly
sanguine prophecies from the same
source about Gallipoli and the German
Navy, were not so much impressed as
they were meant to be.
Wednesday, May 10th.-Among the
Distinguished Strangers in the Gallery
was a deputation from the Russian
Duma, led by its Vice-President. Un-
fortunately M. ProtopopoRE and his
colleagues did not see our Parliament
at its best. In the Commons the
Nationalist factions were noisily
assailing the PRIME MINISTER with
protests against the executions of the
rebel leaders, and ultimately succeeded
in inducing him to give them a day
for what must in the circumstances be
a premature discussion.
Then our Russian friends went to the
Lords, where they found a discussion
on Ireland actually in progress. It
was started by Lord LoREBURN, who
accused the Government of having
neglected the elementary duty of pro-
tecting the law-abiding population, and
urged upon them collectively the
necessity of being as candid as Mr.
BIRRELL had been individually. The
|DILLON developed a savage attack on
War had furnished many instances of
the danger to national interests of
silence carried to excess. Then Lord
MIDLEToN rehearsed a grim catalogue
of cases in which the Irish police had
been instructed to shut their eyes to
seditious offences.
Happily the Russian visitors had
left before Lord CREwe rose to make the
Government's defence, for I am afraid
that they would not have carried away
a high impression of Ministerial elo-
quence or Ministerial statesmanship.
Thursday, May 11th. — To Mr.
REDMoND's obvious annoyance Mr.
the military authorities. They, one
gº; were brutal murderers; the
Sinn Feiners, on the contrary, were
gallant if misguided patriots of whom
he was proud. The PRIME MINISTER,
mildly observing that Mr. DILLON had
forgotten some of the elementary rules
of justice, brought the debate back
to the level of common sense by
contrasting the small number of ex-
ecutions with the heavy toll of mili-
tary and civilian life that the rebels
had taken. Repeating his coup of two
years ago, when he went to the War
Office after the Curragh incident, he
now announced his immediate inten;
tion to go to Ireland, in the hope of
discovering some arrangement for the
future which would commend itself to
all parties. Some of the difficulties
that Mr. Asquith will encounter in his

laudable enterprise were indicated by
Mr. HEALY, who hoped that he would
put an end to Dublin Castle and the
jobbery that had been carried on there
by Mr. REDMOND and his friends.
In the Lords the Government's Irish
policy was again assailed from all sides;
but more damaging even than the
attacks was Lord LANSDown E's defence.
He actually blamed Lord MIDLETON for
having contented himself with warning
the CHIEF SECRETARY and the PRIME
MINISTER of the dangerous happenings
in Ireland, and not having come
to him (Lord LANsdowsE), or to Mr.
BALFour, or to Mr. LoNG. This new
doctrine of collective irresponsibility
seems fairly to justify the definition,
“A Coalition is something that does
not coalesce.”
“Imports in truth have been so small that
the run on home produce has been more or
less forced.”—Eastern Daily Press.
The Press Bureau will have to be more
economical with it than ever.

lco was won upon the cricket fields of England.

and seeking vainly to follow the poet's logic.”

PETHERTON'S PARROT.
MATTERs are getting worse between
Petherton and myself; in fact if any
friendship had ever existed between us
I am afraid one would say that we are
now in a state of complete estrange-
ment, resulting from the invasion of my
premises by his parrot, and the ensuing
correspondence. My opening gambit
was as follows:–
DEAR MR. PETHERTON, - My im-
mediate object in addressing you is
to ask whether by any chance you
have lost a parrot, because a bird of
that species flew through an open
bedroom window of my house this
morning without invitation or encour-
agement from us.
I am inclined to think that the bird
is yours, but have nothing but what I
might term the synthetic process of
reasoning for arriving at this conclu-
sion. If you have lost anything of a
parroty nature, and will write me a
description of it, I will see whether it
tallies with the bird in whose possession
we are. I describe the situation in this
way because it more truly expresses it
than the converse would do.
Yours faithfully, H. J. Fordyce.
Petherton countered with the follow-
ing:—
SIR,-In reply to your absurdly
worded letter I have lost a parrot, a
grey one. I do not know why you
should have inferred that the bird at
your place belongs to me, unless you
had already heard that mine is missing,
in which case I should have thought
the proper course would have been to
return it.
I suppose, however, that to a person
of your nature such a simple procedure
would have been impossible. The writ-
ing of unnecessary, stupid and rather
annoying letters seems to be an obses-
sion with you. -
I shall be obliged by your giving the
bird to the bearer of this note.
Yours truly,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
The yeast of controversy was evi-
dently beginning to work, and I kept
it going with :—
DEAR PETHERTON, What a noble
literary effort is yours, but, if I may be
allowed to criticise it, it seems to me
that while your technique is almost
faultless there is lack of a sense of
values in the composition. Word-paint-
|ing is a delightful art, but surely in this
case the most important feature should
have been a telling description of your
missing bird. The mere outward hue
of the parrot is not sufficient; I wanted
you to describe its habits, accomplish-
ments and the colour of its language;
and in face of your meagre description
I should not feel justified in handing
ºv. this bird to you, in spite of its
being a grey one.
Mind you, I believe you belong to
this parrot, but I should like further
proof. I have made no other inquiries
in Surbury, but possibly someone else
in the neighbourhood may have a grey
parrot on the loose.
Trusting to have a satisfactory reply
at your leisure,
I am,
Yours faithfully,
H. J. Fordyce.
Petherton by this time was up on his
hind legs. He wrote:–
Confound you, Sir! The bird is un-
doubtedly mine. It is grey, talks a
little, and puts its head on one side
after the manner of its kind. I need
not give you a fuller description of it;
you know perfectly well the bird is mine,
and if you do not return it at once I

shall take legal steps for the recovery
of my property.
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
DEAR FRED,--I am sorry you should
be so upset by the loss of a bird that
must have been a cause of considerable
embarrassment to you at times, that is
if the bird which at present conducts
our ménage is yours.
If you would only provide me with a
list of the phrases most favoured by
your parrot I should be able to come
to a definite conclusion on the point of
ownership. In a general way the bird
here tallies with your description.
As you practically ask for their name,
my solicitors are Messrs. Smith, Smith,
Smith & Jones, which may be alge-
braically expressed (though not on the
envelope) as 3 (Smith) + Jones.
In the event of your going on the
service of any billets-doux on my behalf.
Yours, HARRY J. Fordyce.
P.S.–If you have any sort of book
explaining how to subpoena a parrot, do
lend it me like a good chap. If I find
it necessary to call it (the parrot), its
evidence will have to be heard in
camerd, I fancy.
This elicited from Petherton –
SIR,-As my parrot has now been in
more than possible that it has acquired
a taste for strong language. It cer-
tainly was a model of propriety before
it strayed on to your premises.
Unless the bird is back in my pos-
session before the 29th inst. I shall
instruct my solicitors to serve a writ
upon yours, without further warn-
ing or intimation of any kind, as
I consider your behaviour most un-
warrantable, though characteristic.
Fflly, yours, FREDK. PETHERTON.
I sent the bird back the next morning,
the 28th, with a note:–
DEAR FREDDY, The bird itself has at
last provided me with the proof which
you were unable or unwilling to supply.
Among a string of other rather fruity
remarks which it made while we were
at breakfast this morning it indulged—
vicariously, one assumes—in a hope as
to my future which has removed any
traces of doubt lingering in my mind
as to the bird's ownership.
My wife and maid-servant were pre-
sent, and as the remark was a very
comprehensive one and indicated me by
name I am not sure that an action for
libel would not lie against you.
But I am not vindictive, so return
the bird to a more fitting milieu.
Yours, HARRY.
I am still waiting for Petherton's
letter of thanks.

AT THE PLAY.
“HAMLET.”
Mr. MARTIN HARVEY has evidently
approached this high matter of the
SHARspeARE Tercentenary celebration
with the sincerity and thoughtfulness
which have so often laid us under debt
to him. He makes you feel that his
heart is more with his “darling" author
It is
only an implacable public that has
attached him so persistently to the
steps of a guillotine against a blood-red
sky.
It shows a considerable virtue in him
to have adopted, without straining after
a perversely original and disquieting
effect, the very sensible simplifications
of our modernist school. To play sub-
stantially the whole of Hamlet in under
three and a -half hours is a highly
creditable feat of stage direction.
IBut
the curtain method does more than
give speed. Its rich simplicity pro-
vides an excellent foil for the jewel of
this wonderful stage play. Of course
it has its disadvantages. It tends to
muffle the voice. On the other hand it
lets through a certain amount of un-
rehearsed effect. I noted, for instance,
even as Polonius was being pinked
behind the arras, the voice of a stage
carpenter complaining to his mate.
It showed wisdom, too, to confine
the curtains to the interiors. The
built-up crenellations of the battle-
ment scenes, with the series of broad
steps in front of them, was admir-
able for grouping and for movement,
though it may be doubted whether the
parapet would have provided adequate
cover against the slings and arrows of
a tough enemy; or even if it would
have sufficed to prevent the Danes,
when under the influence of wassail,
from toppling into the moat. In the
play scene the setting of the “Mouse
Trap" against the “fourth wall,”
whereby the audience had a fuller
view of the principals, entirely justified
itself. The lighting was effective with-
out being fussy.
The costumes call for little comment,
which is as it should be. I fell to
wondering in the last Act about what
I took to be a team of local base-ball
players—the four stout fellows with
sweaters.
And most distinctly would I counsel
Mr. HARVEY, at his entrance in the
graveyard scene, to show a leg. In the
murky gloom, with his inky cloak and
proudly feathered bonnet, he was dan-
gerously near giving the impression of
a very smart young widow walking
out with Horatio.
Mr. HARVEY seemed at his very best
in the earlier phases of the play. The
reflective passages were excellent; the
homelier bouts of dialogue were easy
and varied; and his fine voice often
enriched the splendid text. As the
plot thickened and the eternally un-
solvable in the reading and rendering of
Hamlet's malady became more pressing,
he seemed a little to lose grip. As,
certainly, he lost the essential pace—
the death scene unquestionably limped.
His slurs, his impetuous accelerandos,
his rather violent sforzandos, perhaps
challenge criticism. Butlet us acknow-
ledge them to be trifles. Mr. HARVEY
filled three short hours with the glory
of a great name, and that should be
reward enough for him.
I see no reason to protest against
Mr. RUTLAND BARRINGTON's unusually |g
whimsical Polonius. True it did not
fit that noblest of purple passages, the
homily to Laertes. But then neither
does the I’olonius of the rest of the
text—our WILL is like that. Mr. Ross's
notable bass and admirable elocution
lent mystery and majesty to the Ghost.
A full audience applauded long and
heartily at the curtain's fall. No one
would be less inclined than Mr. MARTIN
HARVEY to keep back grudgingly any
share of that applause which was
meant as a tribute to the memory of
the exalted dead. T.

MORE PEACE-TALK IN BERLIN.
- To THE WAR-Lord.
“How beautiful upon the mountain-tops
Their feet would sound, the messengers of Peace!”
So into neutral ears your unction drops,
Hinting a pious hope that War may cease—
War, with its dreadful waste,
Which never suited your pacific taste.
Strange you should turn so suddenly humane,
So sick of ravage and the reek of gore
Dare we assume that Verdun's long-drawn strain
Makes you perspire at each Imperial pore?
Or that your nerve's mislaid
Through cardiac trouble caused by our Blockade 2
You thought to finish on the high wave's crest;
To say, “These lands that 'neath our sceptre lie–
Such as we want we'll keep, and chuck the rest,
And to the vanquished, having drained 'em dry,
We will consent to give,
Out of our clemency, the right to live.”
Then you came down a long, long way, and said,
“For pure desire of Peace, and that alone,
We'll deem the dead past buried with its dead,
Taking, in triumph's hour, a generous tone;
Uplift the fallen foe
And affably restore the status quo.”
Fool's talk and idle. In this Dance of Death
The man who called the piper's tune must pay,
Nor can he stop at will for want of breath.
Though War you chose, and chose its opening day,
It lies not in your power
To stay its course or fix its final hour. O. S.

April 20, 1940.-Liberia, in a moment of Ministerial
exuberance, sends a Note to China alleging the death of
a Krooboy subject who had been forced to study the Chinese
language. An indemnity of £100,000,000 is asked.
April 22.—China, mildly surprised, promises investi-
gation. Owing to an oversight, however, the reply is sent
in Chinese characters, which gives the Liberians a just
casus belli.
April 23.-Liberia despatches her one airship to China
vid Tibet. Many bombs are dropped on the Chinese Empire
and several rice-fields are quite spoilt. The Chinese Am-
bassador, whom the airship conveyed from Liberia, is also
dropped—and spoilt. -
April 24.—China sends four airships to bomb Liberia.
These, however, are unable to locate the Black Republic
and return, after dispensing with the company of the
Liberian Ambassador while over Lake Chad.
April 26.-China addresses a curt Note to Liberia, re-
questing her to be good enough to state her exact where-
abouts.
May 1.-The Grand Lama directs a plaintive Note to
Liberia, alleging that on April 23 a Liberian airship violated
the neutrality of Tibet.
May 3.—Liberia, never having heard of Tibet, but
believing the G.L. to be a species of camel and a great
fetish, publishes an apology in The Liberian Times (and
Advertiser), which, however, does not circulate in Tibet.
May 4.—China, after exhaustive inquiries, despatches
another air-fleet, but again fails to locate her quarry.

May 5.-Liberia again raids China by air. Some stones
in the Great Wall are badly chipped.
May 7.—Liberia issues her first official communiqué
through the medium of The Liberian Times (and Adver-
tiser):—“On the night of May 5–6 our Naval and Military
airship attacked the Chinese cities of Pekin, Hankow and
others too intricate of pronunciation to be mentioned here.
Incendiary and explosive bombs were dropped on the fortifi-
cations, gun emplacements, waterworks and waxworks at
Pekin. A battery and many hens were silenced at Hankow.
Our entire air-fleet returned safely and hurriedly.”
May 9.-The G.L. of Tibet sends another Note to
Liberia, protesting against a further grave infringement
of neutrality, several eggs of dubious quality and the
remnants of an unsavoury stew having been dropped from
a Liberian airship on Tibetan territory on the night of
May 5–6. - - -
May 11.—Liberia publishes another apology and sacks
her air chef. -
May 13.−Two squadrons of Chinese airships scour the
globe but cannot find Liberia. Several are forced to land
in the Arctic Circle and are interned by the Esquimaux.

City, the commander having been rather careless with his
cigar in one of the gas chambers.
May 25.-The G.L. of Tibet buys a typewriter and
some carbon sheets, and begins a campaign of daily Notes
to Liberia.
May 26–June 5.—Liberia lies low.
June 7.-China, after fifteen futile attempts to locate
Liberia, sues for peace, asking Liberia to send an envoy
who will be able to guide airships carrying Peace delegates
and the first instalment of indemnity to Liberia.
July 12.-Ten Chinese airships, loaded with Peace dele-
gates and money, and piloted by the Liberian envoy, travel
to the Black Republic. Arrived over the much-sought
country, the Peace delegates drop their pilot and aid the
airships' crews in wiping Liberia off the face of the earth.

a considerable loss.

been angrily contradicted by the Eng-
lish Press, always under some heading
attributing habitual mendacity and
wilful and continuous dishonesty to
the German headquarters.
Germans do not lie. There is no
need. Their deeds are so terrific and
sweeping as it is that the slightest em-
broidery or exaggeration would produce
an effect to stagger humanity. Hence
when our reports said on one occasion
that our Zeppelins had irretrievably
damaged the fortified town of Margate,
and on another occasion that our Zep-
pelins had practically destroyed the
formidable garrison of Ramsgate, and
on a third occasion that our Zeppelins
had almost eliminated that English
Kronstadt, Yarmouth, and on a fourth
occasion that the menacing citadel of

Cromer had been reduced to ruins, and
on a fifth occasion that the hitherto
impregnable fortress of Lowestoſt had
become pregnable owing to the wonder-
ful science of the revered Count ZEPPE-
LIN–when our reports said these things
they recorded facts, although the rep-
tile English Press instantly hissed out
denials and attacks.
But justice will prevail, even in
England, although cne may have to
wait long for it. And now, some while
after these magnificently successful
raids, the admission is made that our
official reports, so suspect and derided,
were right all the time. In one of the
leading English papers we find the fol-
lowing words in an article entitled,
“Prospects for the Summer Holidays.”
For it seems that, in spite of the famine
and other hardships which the im-
mortal German army and supreme
German navy are inflicting upon Eng-
land, some of these trivial islanders are
proposing to go to the seaside as usual
this year—either out of a paltry bravado
or by arrangement with the Government
to create an illusion of prosperity and
composure. But, whereas normally
the watering-places of the whole coun-
try are open to them for their obscene
and brutish frolics, this year they are
not expected to patronise the East
coast—that is to say the English shores
of the German Ocean. And why?
The reason is not without its flattery
to us; and it also carries with it the
damning admission of the absolute ex-
actitude, the minute veracity of the
German official reports of the Zeppelin
raids which previously the English
papers had conspired to impugn. We
give the precise words:—
“There is, we fear, every reason
to anticipate a barren season for the
East Coast resorts, usually so popular.
From Margate and Ramsgate, right
up through Lowestoft, Yarmouth,
Cromer and Cleethorpes to Scarbor-
ough and Whitby, they have, it can-
not be denied, been badly hit by the
Zeppelin raids.”
The italics are ours. Note them
well, for they are the measure of Eng-
lish turpitude. When, after our shat-
tering and comprehensive raids had
occurred, one by one, always with such
devastating fury and precision, our re-
ports announced that these very towns
had been “badly hit” (mark the phrase!),
the English Press once more accused
us of perversion and dissimulation.
How right we were is now proved. In
fact it seems that we understated the
case, for we gather that a very large
number of East Coast towns have been
badly hit by our irresistible machines of
retribution—far more than we knew.
If we wait long enough we shall
doubtless find somewhere in an English
paper the verification of other of our
claims, which at the time were treated
with contempt—such, for example, as
the glorious destruction of Liverpool
and Manchester by bombs from the sky.
All that we need is a little patience.
CHERCHEZ LES TABLEAUX;
OR, THE CULPRIT A LA MoDE.
DURING the trial of George Smith
for obtaining the sum of five hundred
pounds by means of a forged cheque, it
was proved that the prisoner spent a
portion of the money in the purchase of
a ninepenny admission to a local cinema.
The learned judge, speaking with con-
siderable warmth, observed that he
hoped the Press would make a careful
note of that fact. It entirely confirmed
a belief he himself had long held,
namely, that the existence of such
places afforded a temptation to wrong-
doing that was nothing short of a
public menace. He only wished that
he had power to sentence the pro-
prietor. (Applause.)
During the hearing of a petition for
breach of promise of marriage, evidence
was given that the behaviour of de-
fendant had changed since he witnessed
the performance of a certain film en-
titled, “Mr. Quiverful keeps House.”
Mr. Dodge, K.C. (for the plaintiff)
put in a scenario of the film, showing
that it represented the troubles of a
paterfamilias forced to look after a
crowd of children, pacify indignant
servants, and the like. It was unques-
tionable that such an exhibition might
produce a very serious effect upon a
timid and impressionable bachelor.
His Lordship. It is perfectly mon-
strous that such things should be
tolerated.
Counsel, continuing, said he believed
that there was also introduced a mother-
in-law. At this point the jury stopped
the case, and awarded the plaintiff
three thousand pounds damages.
Arrested on a charge of severely
wounding a neighbour with a shot-
gun, a prisoner at Birmingham pleaded
that he had been led astray by a visit
paid to a picture-house, where films of
cowboy life were being exhibited. It
was true that his parents were both
doing time, and he had two uncles
in an asylum, but he attributed his
own downfall entirely to the pernicious
influence of the cinema. -
The Judge. I am glad you appreciate
that fact.
Counsel for the defence here stated
that the victim was now ascertained to
have been a writer of picture-plays.
The Judge. Why didn't you say so
before ? That entirely alters the com-
plexion of the case. I am not sure
that the prisoner has not rendered a
public service.
By direction of his Lordship the
charge was subsequently amended to
one of using firearms without a licence,
and, a nominal fine having been im-
posed, the accused left the dock amid
general congratulations.

Erpert in Military Matters. “HE SAID HE was AN or FICER: BUT I RNEw HE wasN'T, cos HE HADN'T A BUSTER BRowN BELT on.”
THE WATCH DOGS.
XL.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, The weather
has changed and War has resumed a
less uncomfortable aspect. The last I
heard of our friend Persius Adolphus
(now promoted to the giddy heights of
Second-Lieutenant, but still referred
to, in the privacy of the traverse, as
“Perse") he was living al fresco in his
little bit of trench, leading the sinful
life with a pot of pâté de foie gras
in the one hand and the latest number
of La Vie Parisienne in the other. It
takes a lot of H.E. to distract a man’s
attention from these luxuries, which
goes to show that, if at times it is a
short life, it is in spring a merry one,
and a twenty-franc note will in these
parts provide a man with all the most
extravagant pleasures of the idle rich
for a month.
To the officer in the trench, Battalion
Headquarters, a few hundred yards to
the rear, is a veritable pleasaunce far
removed from the din and worry of
battle. To the C.O. and his satellites,
putting up with their dangers and
discomforts for a noble cause, Brigade
Headquarters, a mile down the road, is
a palace of safety and ease, where any
man but a fool of a Brigadier would
remain. To the Brigade Staff, grimly
holding on in its rough and perilous
fortress, the Divisional villa is the
ideal of quiet residences. To the Divi-
sional Staff, suffering silently, the
Corps Château is all that a man could
ask in the way of handsome furnished
apartments. And to the Corps Staff it
is ever a matter of surprise that its
miserable hovel can be contemplated
without a blush by the Army Staff,
revelling, as the latter does, in every
modern convenience. The Army Staff
says nothing but thinks bitterly of
those at G.H.Q., and by the time it
gets to the War Office I couldn't tell
you what the grouse is or whose the
envied lot. The real wallower out
here is, if we all did but know it, some
little known and unobtrusive C.O. of
some special company, with a village
to himself, half-a-dozen châteaux to
choose from, more motors than he
knows what to do with, and, wickedest
and worst, a real bath to wash in.
Be that as it may, the eyes of all rest
upon the same unwarlike pictures torn
from the same least bellicose journal.
From dug-out to palace, faded walls are
decorated with the same three-colour
process divinities, whose expressions
are as arch as arch and whose clothing
is typical of the wonderful economy of
the French. Through the clamour of
bursting shells or the din of the
military typewriter, turning out its
thousand “Pass Memos.” to the hour,
these fair Parisiennes continue to smile
unperturbed, until some officer, callous
rather than modest, hides their bright
blue eyes and bright red cheeks under
a pile of official telegrams relating to
picks and shovels, gas protectors and
other sordid and unromantic matter.
Meanwhile the motor lorries creep
demurely along the country lanes,
coming nobody knows whence, going
nobody knows whither. Now and
then they will pause in a convenient
ditch, rubbing their wheels briskly in
the mud to restore the circulation. A
less restful sight is the military car,
proceeding at a pace never exceeding
twenty kilometres per hour, the occu-
pants of which have also, these days,
adopted the three-colour process, a
sure sign that we are winning. For-
tune favours the brave, and the light-
ning despatch-rider as often as not
will pass through the lot, with the loss

so, he will not omit to salute you, as
you stand off the road, a sight which

You cannot help appreciating his

He will tell you, if you ask him, the
story of the sacred civilian automobile
which he once ventured to stop in
order to satisfy himself as to its con-
tents. He did not recognise any sig-
nificant halo surrounding it, though
this should have been discernible even
in the cloud of dust accompanying it.
He had his written instructions to see
that the credentials of all who drove
through his zone should be en régle.
Simple and ingenuous as he then was,
written instructions were enough for
him. The car approached him menac-
ingly, but he stood his horse in the
middle of the road and signed to it to
stop. The car hooted with hoarse and
defiant anger, and a sinister bowler hat
was seen and angry words were heard
at the window. None the less he

his best manner (always a nice one)

PARLIAMENTARY PILADEX –THE LATEST GAME AT WESTMINSTER.
INTRODUCED TO MEssrs. BALFour AND TENNANT BY MEssrs. CHURCHILL, JoyNsoN-Hicks AND PEMBERTON-BILLING.

BEAconsfield from Berlin, bringing
peace with honour in his pack? Or will
he, as so many British statesmen have
done before, find the inherited hostility
of Irishmen to one another an insuper-
able obstacle? An hon. and learned Na-
tionalist was not encouraging. “When,”
he was asked, “were the seeds of this
trouble sown 2 ” “When STHRONGBow
came to Ireland,” was the answer.
“And when do you think it will
be over ?” persisted the questioner.
“When the world's at an end.”
Last Session Mr. KING was easily
the champion of Question-time. But
this year, thanks to the Sinn Feiners,
Mr. GINNELL is coming up with a rush.
Mr. KING has however one consola-
tion. Mr. GINNELI, rarely extracts
much information from Ministers;
often it is nothing more than “There
is no foundation for the allegation con-
tained in the question.” Whereas his
rival, whose queries cover a much
wider field, frequently elicits important
facts. Like the rest of the world he
has been puzzled by the coloured tabs
now so commonly seen on officers'
tunics. What did they mean? Mr.
tary age; the green badge would just
suit his mental complexion.
Ever since the Military Service Bill
came under discussion the public gº
leries have been full of men in khaki.
As it seems difficult to believe that
their presence is due to the intrinsic
fascination of debates, which have been
for the most part insufferably dull, an-
other theory has been started. Should
the opponents of the Bill become too
obstructive and threaten its passage,
will these doughty warriors leap over
the barriers, drop down on to the floor
of the House (in the manner already
made historic this Session) and execute
a new “PRIDE's Purge"?
A rather unkind trick was played
upon the Simonites by Mr. BARNEs.
He has a good deal of influence with
the Government nowadays, and when
he delivered an eloquent defence of con-
scientious objectors, describing them
as the men who kept the spiritual fires
burning, there were high hopes that
he was going to secure an enlargement
of the loopholes in the Bill. But as
he went on to explain that his remarks

No matter what the importance of the

invariably manage to conclude its dis-
cussion before the dinner-hour.
Some of Lord LANsdown E's friends
are beginning to fear that association
with wicked Radicals like Lord CREwe
is having a deteriorating effect upon his
political faith. They were shocked to
hear him allude almost disparagingly to

In the Commons the Simonites made
a determined effort to get the minimum
age raised from 18 to 19. But Mr. LoNG
was obdurate, though he promised that,
subject to exceptional military neces-
sity, no conscript should be sent abroad
till he was 19. Eventually the Bill
passed its Third Reading by 250 to 35.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A characteristically bitter speech
from Mr. SNow DEN evoked an appro-
priate retort from Sir ARTHUR MARKHAM.
Observing that the Hon. Member had
been against the War throughout, he
charged him with “making vitriolic
speeches and dropping acid drops in
every direction.” Mr. SNowDEN (re-
membering the case of Mr. John BURNs)
may think himself lucky if he is not
known as “The Acid Drop" for the
rest of his political career.
Wednesday, May 17th.-The Sum-
mer Time Bill passed into law to-day, in
spite of the gloomy prognostications of
Lord BALFour of BURLEIGH. He fore-
saw the time when the Committee of
Privileges might be called upon to pro-
nounce a new judgment of SolomoN on
the question whether a peerage should
go to a boy born at 2.50 A.M. on
October 1st or to his twin-brother,
born actually half-an-hour later, but
according to statutory time half-an-hour
before.
While the Lords were illuminating
the daylight the Commons were en-
gaged in ventilating the air. The pre-
sent administration of the Flying
Services was severely criticised by Mr.
JoyNson-Hicks, who wanted an Air
Minister—not Lord CURzoN, but “some-
one with a reputation to lose.” Mr.
TENNANT promptly announced that the
ex-Viceroy of India would be President
of the new Air Board.
Colonel CHURCHILL launched into a
lengthy history of the Air Services,

of the Royal Flying Corps, that criti-
cism no longer applies. In a severely
practical speech he flatly contradicted |
the accusations that had been made
against our Air Service, and boldly
claimed that it was the most efficient
in the world.
After that, Mr. BoSAR LAw had a
comparatively easy task in persuading
the House to give the new Air Board
a fair trial. In reference to the fears
that had been expressed as to the
powers to be accorded to its President

think Lord CURzoN would be found
lacking in personality.
All through the afternoon Mr. PEM-
|BERTON-BILLING had been popping up
with questions, interjections and points
of order. Now he rose to continue the
debate, but Members had apparently
had enough of him for one day. After
a few minutes he suffered the most
inglorious fate that can befall a Parlia-
mentary crusader. One by one his
audience melted away, until there was
not enough left to make a House.
“P. B.” was counted out.

he drily remarked that from his
a friend that “his children are always
fighting with my children and frighten-
ing our children.” That, he implied,
was what went on in the Coalition.
The Commons enjoyed a pretty little
duel between two old friends. Ex-
Professor HEWINs delivered a long
lecture on elementary economics, lead-
ing up to the conclusion that we could
not beat the Germans without an im-
mediate dose of Tariff Reform. The
House, expecting an equally solemn
defence of Free Trade from the CHAN-
CELLOR of THE ExchEQUER, was
at once surprised and delighted when
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN rose to reply.
Though tied to the Tariff movement
“by my heart-strings as well as by my
head,” he thought it would be impru-
dent to embark on it at this moment.
After the War it would very likely meet
with general consent. Mr. HEwins
must have felt like Alice with “jam
yesterday, and jam to-morrow, but
never jam to-day.”

LAST Sunday morning an hour was
lost. The children had been discussing
the question beforehand.
“Where will it go?” asked one.
“I suppose the fairies will take it,”
said Joyce.
“Perhaps it will go behind the
clock,” said another.

“Well, why do they want to lose it?”
asked Joyce, realising that the last
argument was unanswerable and so
darting off on to a new train of
thought altogether.
“Because they'll save a lot of other
hours that way. And then, you see, if we
get up earlier we shan't have to pay the
pennies for gas and electric light, and
all those pennies can go to help Daddy
win the War.”
“Yes, but where will the hour be
gone?”
And so we came back to the beginning
again.
There was a long pause.
“Well,” concluded Joyce, on a note
of finality, “it’s a very good plan
anyway.”
That settled it.

Be careful, then, and court the man's compassion;
Note how the gods, in old Olympian years,
Would woo Hephaestus's, that used to fashion
Stout shields and suchlike for his godly peers;
How upstart deities, who feared not Zeus
And gave Poseidon something like abuse,
Approached him sweetly and were quite profuse,
Lest he be cross and serve them out no spears.
Nor in the trenches should your tact diminish,
For there, still stern with casual issue notes,
He will determine when the food must finish,
And stint his rum to undeserving throats;
And what if in some struggle he should say,
“Look here, this battle can't go on to-day;
You'll get no hand-grenades, no S.A.A.,
Till Simpson signs for all those overcoats" 2

FROM THE FRONT.
“HURRAH !” I said, “I’ve got a letter from the Front.”
“Well done !” said Francesca. “Who's it from ?”
“From Walter. It's not a very long one.”
“That doesn't matter a bit. The great thing is to have
one from the Front, even if it's only to thank you for a
pair of socks.”
“Mine's better than that,” I said. “It runs into nearly
two pages.”
“Yes,” she said, “but it doesn't tell you much, now
does it 2"
“No, to tell you the truth it doesn't. They're under an
honourable obligation, you know, not to reveal things.”
“Poor boys! It isn't much a Second-Lieutenant could
reveal, is it. There's nothing said in your letter about
Sir Doug LAs HAIG having called Walter up to Head-
quarters * * -
“You mustn't say Headquarters; you must say G.H.Q.
if you want to impress people."
“I’m not talking to people; I'm talking to you. There's
nothing said in your letter, is there, about Walter having
been asked by Sir Doug LAs HAIG to draw up a plan for
the Big Push 2"
“No, there isn't; but Walter would draw up a dozen if
he were asked. He's that sort.”
“Don’t talk about my first cousin once removed in that
flippant way.”
“I’m not.”
“You are, and it's most ungrateful of you.”
“Ungrateful ?”
“Yes, ungrateful. He's written you a letter that you'll
be able to chat about for a fortnight. I can hear you
mentioning it to your train-friends, Major Boger and
Dr. Apthorpe. You'll bring it in in a careless kind of
way. “I’ve had a letter,' you'll say, ‘from a chap at the
Front, a cousin of my wife's, and he tells me they're ex-
pecting a move now at any moment.' Then they'll both
say, 'Ah,' as if they didn't think much of your chap, and
each of them will produce a chap of his own with some
highly private information about the CRowN PRINCE having
been taken to a lunatic asylum in a motor-car so heavily
iron-clad that nobody could see who was inside, but he
was recognised by his shrieks; and Dr. Apthorpe will cap
it all with some cock-and-bull story about German ships
having bombarded one another in the Canal last week. And
so you'll get to London.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you are a holy terror. How do
you know all these things? You have never travelled to
London with Major Boger and Dr. Apthorpe, and yet
you're able to misrepresent them as if you'd heard them
speak every day of your life. It's wonderful.”
“Clever fellow,” said Francesca; “we won't pursue the
question of your boastings. They're innocent enough, I
dare say. Let me hear what Walter actually does say in
his letter.”
“Well,” I said, “he doesn't actually say very much.
The weather is fine, he says, and his particular lot have
been having rather a slack time lately. There was a
stampede of horses last week, but his Battery was not
involved in it, and would I mind sending him a packet or
two of chocolate, some strong brown boot-laces and a briar-
root pipe, he having broken his last one, and he's never
felt fitter in his life, and anybody who wants to know
what health is had better come out to France at once.
That's about all; but you can read it for yourself.” I
handed it over to her and she skimmed through it.
“I’ll tell you what,” she said, “I strongly advise you
not to show this letter about."
“I certainly shall show it,” I said, “but only to friends.”
“Well,” she said, “I wouldn't even do that, unless you
want to get Walter into trouble.”
“What nonsensel ” I said. “It's the most discreet and
honourable letter I ever received.”
“Yes,” she said, “but it's so cleerful. If certain news-
papers got hold of it there wouldn't be any peace for
Second-Lieutenant Walter Carlyon. He'd be told he was
like all other Englishmen—he didn't take a serious view of
the War. Then they'd say that he was one of the men
who were responsible for the French not understanding us,
and for the Russians ſailing to appreciate our efforts, which,
indeed, could hardly be called efforts at all, and for the
Italians despising us as we deserved to be despised for
tolerating such a Government as we were afflicted with—
and lots more of the same sort, all because poor Walter
doesn't go about in a state of perpetual gloom, as if he
expected the whole of Great Britain to be sunk into the
sea the next minute.”
“Francesca,” I said, “your warmth is excusable, and
there's a good deal in what you say, but I shall show
Walter's letter all the same.”
“Well,” she said, “when the storm bursts I shall let him
know whom he's got to thank for it.”
“I shall write to him,” I said, “and warn him to write
a really pessimistic letter next time, so that I may show it
to influential people and get his name up."
“It'll be no good,” she said. “Walter isn't one of that
sort. He's cursed with a profound and unreasoning belief
in his country, and, being an Englishman, he'll go to his
grave if necessary believing that England is bound to win
the War.” - -
“And, by Jove,” I said, “I thoroughly agree with him.”
“Yes,” she said, “and so do I, but it doesn't do to say so
to everybody nowadays.” R. C. L.
SPEED THE PLOUGH: A COUNTRY SONG.
As I was a-walking on Chilbolton Down
I saw an old farmer there driving to town,
A-jogging to market behind his old grey,
So I jumped up beside him, and thus he did say:—
“My boy he be fightin', a fine strappin' lad,
I gave he to England, the one boy I had ;
My boy he be fightin' out over the foam,
An' here be I frettin'an' mopin' at home.
“But if there be times when 'tis just about hard
Wi'out his strong arm in the field an' the yard,
Why, I plucks my old heart up an' flicks the old grey,
An' this is the tune that her heels seem to say:—
“Oh the hoof an' the horn, the roots an' the corn,
The flock in the fold an' the pigs in the pen,
Rye-grass an' clover an' barns brimmin' over,
They feed the KING's horses an' feed the KING's men l'
“Then I looks at my furrows to see the corn spring
Like little green sword-blades all drawn for the KING;
An' 'tis “Get up, old Bess, there be plenty to do
For old chaps like me an' old horses like you.
“‘My boy be in Flanders, he's young an' he's bold,
But they will not have we, lass, for we be too old,
So step it out lively an' kip up your heart,
For you an' me, Bess, be a-doin' our part—
“‘Wi' the shocks an' the sheaves, the lambs an' the
beeves,
The ducks an' the geese an' the good speckled hen,
The cattle all lowin', the crops all a-growin',
To feed the KING's horses and feed the KING's men.'"

ExcEPT by keen politicians the fourth volume of Mr.
BUCKLE's Life of Benjamin Disraeli (MURRAY) may be
found a little dull in comparison with its predecessors.
That is not the fault of the biographer, who has done his
best with a vast mass of somewhat dry material, but
could not make this portion of his record so enthralling as
that which preceded it or—wo may confidently hope—that
which will follow it. In 1855 DISRAELI had arrived at
respectability, but had not yet attained power. The Con-
servative Party recognised that he was indispensable, but
continued to withhold its full confidence, with the result
that, although his brain still teemed with the great schemes
formed in his hot youth, he had to defer their practical
accomplishment and to devote himself to educating his
party and its titular leader, Lord DERBY, for the day when
the swing of the pendulum might give it a majority in the
House of Commons. Only one great triumph came to him
during these years in the wilderness. DISRAELI had never
visited India, but, owing perhaps to his Eastern ancestry,
he had a trućr intuition of Oriental needs than most
contemporary statesmen; and it was fortunate that it
fell to him in 1858, during one of the brief periods
when the Conservatives held office on sufferance, to carry
the Bill which transferred the government of India
from “John Company” to the Crown. The principles
which he then laid down, and which eighteen years later
he carried a stage further in the Imperial Titles Act, justify
Mr. BUCKLE in claiming the Coronation Durbar of 1911 as
* >
“the logical conclusion of Disraeli's policy.” Apart from
this one episode the volume is mainly concerned with the
reconstruction of the Conservative party—“at about the
pace of a Tertiary formation"—with which DISRAELI's
voluminous correspondence with Lord DERBY was mainly
concerned. Happily he had other correspondents, and,
though too self-conscious to be a perfect letter-writer, he
could be playful enough when writing to his wife or to
Mrs. BRYDGEs-WILLIAMs. In this volume Mr. BUCKLE
has given us a careful portrait of the Politician DISRAELI;
in his next we look to see a little more of the Man.
It is probable, I think, that you will not have turned
many pages of Brenda Walks On (HUTchINsoN) before
being struck by a certain pleasing incongruity between its
matter and style. Sir FREDERICK WEDMoRE is such an
artist in words, so punctilious in the niceties of their
employment, that to find him writing a story of modern
stage-life, and using for it—with, as it were, a certain
delicate deliberation—phrases peculiar to the jargon of
the class of which it treats, gives one a series of small
shocks. It is like hearing slang from a Dean. As a matter
of fact, though, I was wrong in calling Brenda Walks On
a story. It is rather a disquisition about stage people,
stage art and life, and anything else whatever upon which
Sir FREDERICK wishes to talk at the moment, from the
beauties of the North-Eastern coast (the Scarborough part
of the book carried me back to the far-off days of Iłenuncia-
tions) to the treasures of Hertford House. Even Brenda's
chief suitor is capable of breaking off the avowal of his
love to deliver a few well-chosen remarks about theatrical

rents and the hazards of management. This suitor, Penfold,
is perhaps the nearest approach to an actual character
that the book contains. He was a writer of papers upon
the drama of whom the author observes, “With a ready
pen, indeed, Heaven forbid that he should have been cursed
It was better to have a careful one, faithfully ordered,
allowing him to make sensible utterance of some part of
the knowledge and thought that were in him.” Which,
by a happy coincidence, is exactly my verdict upon the
author's method in this graceful causerie.
Christina's Son (WELLs GARDNER) is a disarming book.
It overcomes criticism by the direct simplicity of its attack,
in which only later do you begin to suspect a concealed art.
Miss W. M. LEtts tells a tale that (you might say) has
nothing in it; nothing certainly at all sensational or
strikingly original. But this story of a middle-class North-
country woman grips the attention, and holds it, by some
done well. Although her characters play their part in the
War, she resists the temptation to smother them with
W.C.'s and other decorations, and for this abstinence and
for Miss Chetwynd, a middle-aged spinster of shrewd sense
and humour, I warmly commend her. I confess myself in
love with Miss Chetwynd and should dearly like to hear
her candid opinion of The Secret Sympathy. But I feel
sure that, if she smiled a little at the wonderfulness of it
all, her final verdict would be as benevolent as mine.
Mr. Rich ARD MAHER's The Shepherd of the North
(MACMILLAN) looks a little like one of those rather elaborate
Catholic tracts in form of a novel of which we have so
many classic examples. Mgr. Winthrop, the Bishop of
Alden, way up in the Adirondacks, was indeed a noble old
fellow, somewhat given to long speeches, but with a great
heart in the right place, and wise and tolerant withal.
He was known and loved by the small farmers and
quality hard to define. Christina, as wife of a man whom lumber-men as The White Horse Chaplain for a deed of
she can never greatly love,
and, later, as mother of º _-º-º-Tº-
a son whom she adores
but only half understands,
becomes, for all her com- ºr
monplace environment, a
figure that dwells in the
memory because of what
you feel to be its absolute
truth. The atmosphere of
the story is so crystal clear
that every detail of its º
chief characters stands &
out with the distinctness
of a landscape after rain. “, |
And because, by all the
rules, these characters' wº
should be so little inter-lº-'
esting, and the very pro- º
vincial society in which -ºº:
the thirty or so years of
the book pass is so en-
tirely undistinguished, you
are faintly astonished all
the way through (at least
I was) at not being bored.
I see that one critic has - -
praised a previous story by Miss LETTs for its humour. I
should not have picked this out as a characteristic of
Christina's Son. Rather has it a certain gravity and sobriety
of aim, which in part explains its appeal; if there is humour
it is generally below the surface and never insisted upon.
There is a moment when its rather restrained style rises
suddenly to rare beauty, where the theme is old age; and
throughout there is a maturity of judgment in the writ-
ing that will make it perhaps less attractive to the young
than to those whose outlook has reached the same stage.

If I were to give away the plot of Miss MARY L.
PENDERED's The Secret Sympathy (CHAPMAN AND HALL) I
think that you would sniff. It is not likely to cause ani-
mated discussion in intellectual circles. We are introduced
to a girl who, finding herself reduced from affluence to
poverty, takes a garage and runs it with success, and we
become acquainted with a chauffeur and a peer, and the
former turns out to be—but that is just what I am not
going to tell you. If you want a book in which the hero is
a very perfect gentleman indeed and the villain really is a
villain, then here you are. Miss PENDERED's scheme is not
too subtle, but what she has set out to do she has done, and
--- ---
valour done in his youth
in the Civil War. And he
carried that high quality
of courage into his work
of defending his people
against the machinations
of the U. & M. Railroad,
which swept down upon
them and stuck at nothing,
not arson on a Teuton
scale or judicial murder,
to get the prize it was
after—valuable iron ore
in the hills through which
its track ran. However,
it was the Bishop's oar,
dexterously thrust in,
which finally won the
victory. There is a point
which puzzles me consi-
derably. The crisis of the
story turns on the secret
of the Confessional. A
young man is accused of
murder, and the Bishop,
his friend, has heard the
- ------ confession of the real mur-
derer, so that his lips are sealed. But his fiancée also un-
wittingly overheard the essential of the confession screamed
by the dying man. Mr. MAHER seems to think her bound by
the same sacred ties as the Bishop, even to the point of allow-
ing her lover to go to the chair because of her silence. But
is that sound moral theology? I should doubt it. I ought
to add that there's nothing to shock the most sensitive
evangelical conscience, and quite a good deal to edify,
instruct and entertain.

A land that flowed with beer and chops;

Remarked our taste for keeping shops;
...And WILLIAM, in his humorous way,

Pecause we joined so large a fray
With so absurdly small an army.

Under our outer rind, or peel,
Deep at the core of England's schemes

We call our mates and ring her round
With other dragons just as awful.

(From a German.)
YEs, and for the very reason that I am a German I am
speaking to you, so that you may know what one German
at least thinks of you and your deeds. For I know that
even where you sit walled about by your flatterers, ram-
parted against the intrusion of any fresh breath of criticism,
and protected by entanglements of barbed wire against any
hint of doubt as to your god-like attributes—even there I
know that my voice shall in time reach you, and you shall
become aware that there is a German who dares to say of
you what millions of Germans think and soon will dare
to SaV. -
You are the man, Sir, who by a word spoken in a season-
able moment might have forbidden the War, and this word
you refused to speak because, knowing your own prepara:
tions for war and those of the nations whom you ſº
to be your enemies, you anticipated an easy and a swift
triumph. You believed that, after spending a few thou-
sands of men and a few millions of marks, victory would
be yours, and you would be able, as an unquestioned
|
conqueror, to dictate peace to those who had dared to
oppose you. And thus in a few months at the most you
would return to Berlin and prance along the flower-
strewn streets at the head of your victorious and but
little-injured regiments. It is told of you that lately, when
you visited a great hospital crowded with maimed and
shattered men, your vain and shallow mind was for a
moment startled by the terrible sight, and you murmured,
“It was not I who willed this.” In part you were right.
You did not consciously will to bring upon your country
the suffering and the misery you have caused, because
you were willing to take the gambler's chance; but in the
sight of God, to whom you often appeal, you will not
escape the responsibility, for having steadily thrust peace
and conciliation aside when, as I say, by one word you
might have avoided war. -
Germany, you will say, is a great nation and cannot
brook being insulted and defied. Great Heaven, Sir, who
denied that Germany was great? Who wished to insult
or defy her? Not France, whose one desire was to live in
peace; not Russia, still bleeding from wounds suffered at
the hands of Japan; not England, still, as of old, intent on
her commercial development, though anxious, naturally
enough, for her Fleet; not Italy, bound to you by a treaty
designed to guard against aggression. It is true that all
nations were becoming weary of a violent and hectoring
diplomacy, of a restless and jealous punctilio seeking out
occasions for misunderstandings and quarrels, and rushing
wildly from one crisis to another; but under your direction
this intolerable system had been patented and put in opera-
tion by Germany and by no other nation. It was as though
a parvent, uncertain of his manners and doubtful as to his
reception, should burst violently into a salom filled with
quiet people and, having upset the furniture and thrown
the china ornaments about, should accuse all the rest of
treading on his toes and insulting him. So did Germany
act, and for such actions you, who had autocratic power
—you, at whose nod Chancellors trembled—you loved their
tremors—and Generals quaked with fear—must be held
responsible. What low strain of vulgarity was it, what
coarse desire to bluster and rant yourself into fame and
honour, rather than to deserve them by a magnanimous
patience and a gentleness beyond reproach, that drove you
on your perilous way? It was your pettiness that at the
last plunged you into the War.
And now that you have been in it for little short of two
years, how stands the Fatherland, and where are the visions
of easy and all but immediate victory 2 Germany is bleed-
ing at every pore. Her soldiers are brave; but to confirm
you on your throne you force them day by day to a slaughter
in which millions have already been laid low. That other
nations are suffering too is for me no consolation. My
thoughts are centred on Germany, once so nobly great,
and now forced by a restless and jealous lunatic into a war
to which there seems no end.
I sign myself in deep sorrow, A GERMAN.

occasion, or did the great novelist make a practice of this
engaging form of self-effacement 2"

in a low voice, “news came that Ruri-

“Monstrous,” I cried. “Most mon-

“So we all came back, and Lady
Rogerson was so splendid and looked
so brave in her sombrero and brass
buttons. She explained how it was all

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THOUGHTS ON NEWSPAPERS.
I swear that this article is not written
in the interests of the newspaper trade.
If it bears fruit the newspaper trade
will score, but that I cannot help. It
is written in the larger interests of
humanity and the sweeter life.
The situation briefly is this. One
paper is not enough for any house, and
some houses or families require many.
In the house in which I write, situate
in a foreign country, there are many
exiles from England and only one
paper, which arrives on the fourth day
after publication (thus making Wednes-
day a terrible blank), and sometimes
does not complete the round of readers
until to-morrow. The result is that a
bad spirit prevails. Normally open and
candid persons are found concealing
the paper against a later and freer
hour ; terminological inexactitude is
even resorted to in order to cover such
jackdaw-hoardings; glances become
covetous and suspicious.
All this could be obviated.
I remember hearing of a distin-
guished and original and masterful
lady (SARGENT has painted her) in the
great days, or rather the high-spirited
days, of The Pall Mall Gazette—when
verse was called Occ, and it was more
important that a leading article should
have a comic caption than internal
sagacity, and six different Autolyci
vended their wares every week—who
had fifteen copies of the paper delivered
at her house every afternoon, and fif-
teen copies of The Times every morning,
so that each one of her family or guests
might have a private reading; and she
was right.
A newspaper should be as personal
as a toothbrush or a pipe, otherwise
how can we tear a paragraph out of it
if we want to ?—as my friend, Mr.
Blank, the historian, always does, for
that great sociological essay on which
he is engaged, entitled The Limit.
But the idea of having enough papers
for all has gained no ground. Even
clubs don't have enough. And as for
dentists !
Givers of theatre parties have been
divided into those who buy a pro-
gramme for each guest and those who
buy one programme for all; and pro-
grammes, for some occult reason which
seems to satisfy the British ass, cost
sixpence each. Yet the enlightened
hosts of the first group will cheerfully
pack their houses with week-enders
and supply but one Observer for the lot.
Why?
The suggestion, even with war-time
economy as an ideal before us, is not
so mad as it sounds. Most of us
smoke more cigarettes than we need,

[MAY 31, 1916.
ABDUL: AN APPRECIATION.
I HEARD the shriek of an approach-
ing shell, something hit the ground
beneath my feet, and I went sailing
through the ether, to land softly on an
iron hospital cot in a small white-
walled room. There was no doubt
that it was a most extraordinary hap-
pening. On the wall beside me was a
temperature chart, on a table by my
bed was a goolah of water, and in
the air was that subtle Cairene smell.
Yes, I was undoubtedly back in Cairo.
Obviously I must have arrived by that
shell.
Then, as I was thinking it all out,
appeared to me a vision in a long white
galabieh. It smiled, or rather its
mouth opened, and disclosed a row of
teeth like hailstones on black garden
mould. -
“Me Abdul,” it said coyly; “gotter
givit you one wash.”
I was washed in sections, and Abdul
did it thoroughly. There came a halt
after some more than usually strenuous
scrubbing at my knees. Mutterings of
“mushquais” (no good) and a wrinkled
brow showed me that Abdul was puz-
zled. Then it dawned on me. I had
been wearing shorts at Anzac, and
Abdul was trying to wash the sunburn
off my knees | By dint of bad French,
worse Arabic, and much sign language
I explained. Abdul went to the door
and jodelled down the corridor, “Mo-
haaaaamed, Achmed." Two other
slaves of the wash-bowl appeared,
and to them Abdul disclosed my maho-
gany knees with much the same air
as the gentleman who tells one the
fine points of the living skeleton on
IIampstead Heath. They gazed in
wonder. At last Achmed put his hand
on my knee. “This called 2" he asked.
“Knee,” I told him.
“Yes,” he said thoughtfully, “this
neece–Arabic; this '' (pointing to an
unsunburnt part of my leg)—“Een-
gleesh.”
Then the washing proceeded unin-
terruptedly. “You feelin' very quais
(good)?” Abdul asked. I told him I
was pretty quais, but that I had been
quaiser. “Gin ral comin' safternoon
and Missus,” he informed me, and I
gathered that no less a person than
the Commander-in-Chief (one of them)
was to visit the hospital. And so it
happened, for about five o'clock there
was a clinking of spurs in the passage,
and the matron ushered in an affable
brass hat and a very charming lady.
In the background hovered several staff
officers. Suddenly their ranks were
burst asunder and Abdul appeared
breathless.
He had nearly missed the show.
He stood over me with an air of
ownership and suddenly whipped off
my bed clothes, displaying my nether
limbs. He saw he had made an im-
pression. “Neece is Arabic,” he said
proudly. It was Abdul's best turn, and
he brought the house down. The vis-
itors departed, but for ten minutes I
heard loud laughter from down the
corridor. Abdul had departed in their
wake, doubtless to tell Achmed and
Mohammed of the success of his
coup.
I had been smoking cigarettes, but
found the habit extravagant, as Abdul
appreciated them even more than I
did. One morning I woke up to see
him making a cache in his round
cotton cap. I kept quiet until he came
nearer, and then I grabbed his hat. It
was as I thought, and about ten cig-
arettes rolled on the floor. I looked
sternly at Abdul. He was due to
wither up and confess. Instead he
broke first into a seraphic grin and
then roared with laughter. “Oh, very
funny, very, very funny,” he said be-
tween his paroxysms. Now what could
I say after that 2 I was beaten and I
had to admit it, but I decided that
I would smoke a pipe. To this end I
gave Abdul ten piastres and sent him
out to buy me some tobacco. He
arrived back in about an hour with
two tins worth each eight piastres.
“Me quais ?” he asked expectantly.
“Well, you are pretty hot stuff,” I
admitted, “but how did you do it?”
Abdul held up one tin.
“Me buy this one,” he said solemnly;
“this one" (holding up the other one)
“got it!”
“What do you mean, “got it’?”
“Jus' got it,” was all the answer I
could get. Then to crown the per-
formance he produced two piastres
change. Could the genii of the
Arabian Nights have done better?
I was in that hospital for three
months, and I verily believe that if it
had not been for Abdul I should have
been in three months more. He had his
own way of doing things and people,
but he modelled himself unconsciously
on some personality half-way between
FLORENCE NIGHTING ALE and Fagin's
most promising pupil. The day I was
to go he cleaned my tunic buttons and
helmet badge with my tooth-brush and
paste and brought them proudly to me
for thanks. And I thanked him.
The last I saw of Abdul was as I
drove away in the ambulance. A
pathetic figure in a white robe stood
out on the balcony and mopped his
eyes with his cotton cap, and as he
took it off his head there fell to the
ground half-a-dozen crushed cigarettes.
It was a typical finale.
THE DYSPEPTIc's DILEMMA.
[Maté, an infusion of the prepared leaves of
the Iler paraguayensis, or Brazilian holly,
long familiar in South America, is coming
into fashion in London.]
IN happy ante-bellum days,
To quote a memorable phrase,
“Whisky and beer, or even wine,
Were good enough for me"—and mine.
But now, in view of heightened taxes
And all that grim McKENNA axes,
I have religiously tabooed
All alcohol—distilled or brewed.
But “minerals” are now expensive,
And, though the choice may be ex-
tensive,
I find them, as my strength is waning,
More effervescent than sustaining.
At cocoa's bland nutritious nibs
My palate obstinately jibs;
And coffee, when I like it best,
Plays utter havoc with my rest.
Tea is a tipple that I love
All non-intoxicants above;
But on its road to lip from cup
All sorts of obstacles crop up.
On patriotic grounds I curb
My preference for the Chinese herb,
But for eupeptic reasons think
The Indian leaf unsafe to drink.
Hence am I driven to essay
Maté, the “tea of Paraguay,”
As quaffed by the remote Brazilians,
Peruvians, Argentinians, Chilians.
My doctor, Parry Gorwick, who
Believes in this salubrious brew,
Has promised from its use renewal
Of my depleted vital fuel.
And so I'm bound to try it—still
I wasn't born in far Brazil,
And find it hard on leaves of holly
To grow exuberantly jolly.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHIARIVARI.
Colonel CHURCHILL's supporters are
still not quite sure whether he has
yet found his own exact place in the
national jigsaw.
Wednesday, May 24th.-The House
of Lords was well attended this after-
noon, in the expectation of hearing
Lord CURzoN unfold the programme of
the new Air Board. But it had to
exercise a noble patience. Lord GAL-
wAY gave an account of a trip in a Zep-
pelin; Lord BERESFORD (who, strange
to say, is much better heard in the
Lords than he was in the Commons)
told how the Government were still
awaiting from America a large consign-
ment of aeroplanes which as soon as
they were delivered would be “obsolete
six months ago"; and Lord HALDANE
(less impressive in mufti than when he
wore the Lord Chancellor's wig) de-
livered once again his celebrated dis-
course on the importance of “thinking
clearly.”
Lord CURzoN at least did not seem
to require the admonition, for his
speech indicated that he had carefully
considered the possibilities of the Air
Board. He did not agree with Colonel
CHURCHILL that its future would be one
of harmless impotence or of first-class
rows. At any rate the second alterna-
tive had been rendered less probable by
the disappearance from the Govern-
ment of his critic's own “vivid per-
sonality."
Mr. ARTHUR PONsox BY and Mr.
RAMSAY MAcDoNALD have inadvert-
ently done signal service to their
country's cause. By raising—on Em-
pire Day, too!—the question of peace,
and urging the Government to initiate
negotiations with Germany, they fur-
nished Sir Edward GREY with an
opportunity of dealing faithfully with
the recent insidious manoeuvres of
Herr voN BETHMANN-Hollweg. The
only terms of peace that the German
Government had ever put forward were
terms of victory for Germany, and we
could not reason with the German
people so long as they were fed with
lies. The Foreign SECRETARY spoke
without a note, and carried away the
House by his spontaneous indignation.
The House had previously passed the
Lords' amendments, strengthening the
Military Service Bill. Altogether it
was a bad day for the pro-Bosches.

big attendance in the House of Com-

[MAY 31, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
LATE October and a grey morning
tinging to gold through the warming
mist. A large comfortable dining-
room smelling faintly of chrysanthe-
mums and more strongly of coffee and
breakfast dishes. In the hearth a
great fire, throwing its flames about as
with joy of life. The table-cloth, the
silver, the dishes, the carpet on the
floor, the side-board, the pictures, the
wall-paper told of wealth and ease,
the fruits of peace, and the arrange-
ment of these things told of the good
taste which is so essentially the fruit of
long peace.
The room was empty, and the first to
enter it that morning was the Mother.
She was a tall imposing woman, and
her bearing and her little mannerisms
were of the kind that the latter-day
novelists have delighted to use as
matter for their irony. It was the
Boy's birthday—his eighteenth birth-
day, the first he had spent at home
since he had been going to his prepara-
tory and his public school. So she
departed from the usual routine to
place by the side of his napkin the
neat little parcels she had brought
down with her. Two of them were
from her other sons fighting in France.
They were a very affectionate and
united family—father and mother and
the three sons.
After that she went to her husband's
end of the table and looked through the
heap of letters placed there as usual by
the admirable butler. It was understood
of old that she opened no letters but
those addressed to her, not even the
letters from the fighting sons when
they happened to write to their father
instead of to her.
This time, however, her eye caught at
once, between the edges of the others,
an official envelope and, lower yet,
another. She became rigid and stood
for a minute by the table, her mind
running vaguely into endless depths.
Then she put her hand out and picked
the envelopes from the heap and saw
that her fears might not be groundless.
But they were addressed to her hus-
band, and at that moment she heard
his tread and his slight cough as he
came slowly down the stairs. Hastily
she pushed them back among the
others and went to her place. When
he came into the room she was busy
with the urn.
As usual he was just putting his
handkerchief back; as usual he looked
out of the window, then walked over
to the fire and warmed his hands
automatically. All this business of
coming down to breakfast had been to
him for so many years a leisurely
pleasant business in a world free from
serious worlies, that even the War, with
its terrible disturbances, with its break-
ing up of the family circle, had not
succeeded in altering his habits. Every-
thing waited for him—for he was not
unpunctual—the letters, the newspaper
and the breakfast. But this day was
the Boy's birthday and the Father
took from his pocket an envelope and
placed it with a smile by the side of
the little parcels.
Would he never look at his letters ?
The Mother was on the point of speak-
ing, but long habit, the old habit of
obedience to her lord, restrained her.
Even now, when she was cold with
anxiety, those old concealed forces of
habit restrained her. Might she not
offend him 2
The Father sat down, put on his
glasses and began to look at the pile
by his side. She noticed the slight
start he gave and her eyes met his as
he looked up suddenly at her. Delib-
erately braving Fate, he put those two
envelopes aside. It was evident that
he meant to read through all the others
first, but he was not so strong as he
thought. His fingers went again to the
official envelopes and he took up the
letter-opener placed ready for his use
by the admirable butler and slit along
the top of one envelope and took the
thin paper from it and read.
His head drooped a little, and the
Mother came round to his side. Then
he opened the other and suddenly sat
very still, with his great strong fine
hand open on the paper, gazing straight
in front of him. His wife bent over
him and tried to speak, but her voice
had died to a whisper, a hoarse strain-
ing sound.
“Dead 2 " she said at last.
IHer husband dropped his head in
affirmation.
“Which 2"
He did not answer and the Mother
understood. “Oh, Harry, not both 2"
Again his head drooped and he
fumbled for the papers and gave them
to her, and as he did so a tear rolled
suddenly down his cheek and splashed
on a spoon. It seemed to be a sign to
him, he felt his courage giving way and
visibly pulled himself together. Then
he turned to take the Mother's hand,
rising from his seat. They stood a
little while thus, the Mother looking
away, as he had done, into unfathom-
able distances of time and space. Then
she too pulled herself together and
went to her place at the other end of
the table. They heard steps on the
staircase, a voice singing. The door
opened and the Boy came in late and
expecting a comment from his father,
His eyes travelled to the parcels beside
his plate, then he felt the silence and
saw the strained expressions of his
mother and father and lastly the official
papers. He came forward and spoke
bravely.
“Bad news, Dad 2 ''
There was no answer. He had not
expected one, for he read the truth on
the face that had never lied. He stood
very still for a brief moment, his head
up—characteristically—his face a little
pale. Both brothers! Then he breathed
deeply and turned to his father in ex-
pectation. The latter knew what was
wanted. -
“You are eighteen to-day, Boy. You
may apply for your commission.”
There was a cry, quickly stifled, from
the Mother, and the Boy said very
quietly, “Thank you, Dad; of course I
must go now.” Then he went to his
mother and kissed her and was not
ashamed to cry.
It was his father who broke the
silence.
“May God grant you many returns,
many happy returns of the day!”

HERR HERMANN FERNAU's Because I am a German
(CoNSTABLE) is a sort of postscript to the widely-outside-
Germany-circulated J'accuse !, that vigorous indictment
by an anonymous German of the Prussian clique as the
criminal authors of the War. Herr FERNAU summarises
the argument of J'accuse ! and if anyone cares to have at
his finger-tips the essential case against the enemy he
could not do better than absorb the six pages in which
twenty-four questions put by the anonymous author to the
directors of his unhappy country's destiny are most skil-
fully compressed. Four attempted German answers are
shown by our author to have in common an amazing
reluctance to deal with any single definite point at issue;
and a most unjudicial appeal to popular hatred of the traitor
critic. Of course it is a cheap line to welcome as a miracle
of wisdom every German who takes a pro-Ally view.
But I honestly detect no shadow of pro-Ally bias in this
book, and it is certainly no tirade against Germany. What
bias there is is that of the extreme republican against his
autocratic government. “I have read,” says Herr FERNAU
in effect, “this perfectly serious and definite indictment
lucidly drawn in legal form. I hope as a German (not
afraid to sign my name) there is an answer. But whereas
the Entente Powers have supported their official case by
documentary evidence we are asked to accept mere assever-
ation in the case of Germany. That is the less allowable
the facts is against her. Silence and vigorous suppression
of the indictment look rather like signs of guilt.” Yes,
emphatically a book for members of the Independent
Labour Party.
Beatrice Lovelace belonged to a family that had come
down in the world, and were now Reduced County. So
far reduced, indeed, that Beatrice lived with her cross aunt
Anastasia and one little maid-of-all-work in a tiny house
in a very dull suburb, where the aunt would not allow her
to be friends with the neighbours. However, one fine day |
two things happened. Beatrice got to know the young
man next door, and the little servant (whose name, by a
silly coincidence which vexed me, happened to be Million)
was left a million dollars. So, as the house was already
uncomfortable by reason of a row about the young man,
Beatrice determined to shake the suburban dust from her
shapely feet and take service as maid to her ex-domestic.
That is why the story of it is called Miss Million's Maid
(HUTCHINsoN). An excellent story, too, told with great
verve by Mrs. OLIVER ONIONs. I could never attempt to
detail the complicated adventures to which their fantastic
situation exposes Beatrice and Million. Of course they
have each a lover; indeed, the supply of suitors is soon in
excess of the demand. Also there is an apparent abduction
of the heiress (which turns out to be no abduction at all,
but a very pleasant and kindly episode, which I won't
spoil for you), and a complicated affair of a stolen ruby
that brings both heroines into the dock. It is all great fun
as the obvious (though not necessarily the true) reading of and as unreal as a fairy-tale. For which reason may I

suggest that it was an error to date it 1914 2. Such non-
sensical and dream-like imaginings are so happily out of
key with the world-tragedy that its introduction strikes a
note of discord.
I have just finished reading a distinguished book, One
of Our Grandmothers (CHAPMAN AND HALL), by ETHEL
Col.BURN MAYNE–a book full of a delicate insight and
very shrewd characterisation. It probes to the heart of the
mystery of girlhood–Irish girlhood in this case. I cer-
tainly think that Millicent, who was a sort of prig, yet
splendidly alive, with her gift of music (which, contrary to
custom in these matters, the author makes you really
believe in), her temperament, her temper and her limitless
demands on life, would have given young Maryon, of the
Royal Irish Constabulary, a trying time of it; but it would
have been worth it. That, by the way, was Jerry's opinion,
common, horsey, true-hearted, clean-minded little Jerry,
who was the father of Millicent's coarse and something
cruel stepmother. I have rarely read a more fragrant
chapter than that in which this queer, sensitive, loyal little
man tries to cut away - –
the girl's ignorance while
healing the hurt that a
rougher hand (a woman's),
making the same attempt,
had caused. Perhaps Miss
MAYNE was really trying
to trace to its source the
stream of modern femin-
ism. She is a rare explorer
and cartographer.
A Rich Man's Table
(MILLS AND BooN) is one
of those stories that I find
slightly irritating, because
they appear to - lead no-
where. Perhaps this atti-
tude is unreasonable, and
mere fiction should be all
that I have a right to
look for. But in that - - --
case I confess to wishing a little more body to it. Miss
ELLA MACMAHON's latest novel is somehow a little
flat ; not even the splintered infinitive on the first page
could impart any real snap to it. The rich man was
Mr. Bentley Broke, a pompous person, who had one child,
a son of literary leanings named Otho. Perhaps I was
intended to sympathise with Otho. It looked like it at
first ; but later, when he left home and married, without
paternal blessing, the daughter of his father's great rival,
he developed into such a fool—and objectionable at that—
that I became uncertain on the matter. Especially as the
pompous parent, lacking nerve to carry out a matrimonial
venture on his own account, relented and behaved quite
decently to the rebellious pair. So the rich man's table
would have, as all tables should, more than one pair of
legs under it again. Nothing very fresh or thrilling in all
this, you may observe. But the characters, for what they
are, live, and are drawn briskly enough. And there is
some skill in the contrast between a dinner of herbs in
Fulham, and a stalled ox, with fatted calf, at the rich
man's table in Portman Square.

L'ALSE ECONOMY.
| Mrs.
Penton's Captain (CHAPMAN AND HALL) has not added to
my debt. And the cause of the trouble—as of so many
other troubles—is the War. In her own line Mrs. BLUNDELL
is inimitable, but here she is just one of a hundred or a
thousand whose fiction seems trivial beside the facts of life
and death. Apart from this defect, her story is absolutely
without offence, a simple tale of love and misunderstandings
and war and heroism, and the curtain falls upon a scene
of complete happiness. Her only fault is that she has been
tempted, excusably enough in these days of upheaval, to
wander from her element, and I am looking forward to the
day when she returns to it and I can again thank her with
the old zest and sincerity.
As a painstaking study of lower middle-class life The
Progress of Kay (ConstaBLE) is to be remarked and remem-
bered. That is not, however, to say that it is exciting, for
Kay's progress consisted so much in just getting older that
I suspect Mr. G. W. BULLETT's title to be ironical. As a
child Kay had some imagination and a sense of mischief;
as an adult he would have been all the better for a little
- __ military training, and
there is no disguising the
fact that as a married man
and a father he was a
dreary creature. I can
well believe, from the air
of truth which these pages
wear, that there are plenty
of Kays in the world to-
day; and to confess that I
was not greatly intrigued
by this particular sample
when he grew to man's
estate is in its way a com-
pliment to his creator.

may like or dislike the
mark at which Mr. BUL-

“Na, na,” he said, “ah'm pleasin'
masel just.”
He paused and emitted a fierce
chuckle.
“Ah 'm gettin' even,” he announced;
“they wantit me to gang oot wi' a
wumman.”
“But whatever made them want you
to do that, McPhee ?”
“One o' thae nurses,” continued the
patient smoulderingly. “Ah fought at
Mons, an' Ah fought at New Chapelle,
an' Ah fought at Wipers, that's what
ignorant pairsons ca'Eepers; and they
wantit me to gang oot wi' a wumman.
Why for did they no send me oot to
fight the Jairmans in a peerambu-
lator 2 ”
“Oh,” I said, at last enlightened.
“But surely, McPhee, the nurses are
very nice. And think how hurt they
will be if you won't go out with them.”
“Ah 'm no denyin' some o' them are
a' recht,” said McPhee grudgingly,
“but it's a maitter o' preenciple. An'
I'm gettin' even wi' them the noo!”
He chuckled again.
“But how are you getting even 2"
“Ah 'm no dressin' up for them,”
said the vengeful one; “ye ken thae
nurses are havin' a kin' of a bairthday
pairty or the like, an' a' the men's
dressed up to please them. An’ if Ah
canna gang oot to please masel, Ah
canna dress oop like a monkeyback to

At this point the door opened and a
dejected apparition in a ruff and petti-
coats, like a rumpled remnant of a pre-
war pageant, drifted in and sat down
on a bed.
“Ah weel, Queen Elizabeth, hae
they dune wi' ye yet 2" inquired
McPhee sardonically.
Gloriana shook his head. “They're
playin' musical chairs,” he said gloomily,
“so I thought as I wouldn't be missed
for a bit. This thing round my neck
does tickle, but my nurse 'd be awful
'urt if I took it off.”
McPhee emitted an ejaculation—
Gaelic, I believe—usually expressed in
writing “Mphm.”
“Sma' things,” he said, “please sma'
minds. . . . Wha won the prize 2"
“Number Two Ward,” said Queen
Elizabeth indifferently, “sweets.
They're eatin' 'em. They'll have
stummick-aches to-morrer. . But
there—it's the least as we can do to
let the nurses 'ave their bit o' fun.”

Nurse Robinson hurried up to me on
my way out. I thought her looking a
trifle anxious.
“I’m feeling rather worried about
one of my men,” she began, “Private
McPhee. I wonder if you saw him just
now 2 " .
“Oh, yes,” I said, “we had quite a
long chat.”
“Oh, I'm so glad,” she exclaimed,
“I was really quite afraid he was
wrong in his head. Do you know, he
simply refused to dress up for the
party . . . and you know how they
love dressing up ! Such a good dress,
too—CHARLIE CHAPLIN. And I
couldn't get a word out of him Wasn't
it strange 2"
“Very,” I said; “convalescents get
all kinds of fancies, don't they 2 And
was the party a success?”
“Splendid ' " she said, brightening
up. “Of course it's meant a lot of
work. We've been toiling early and
late at the costumes. But I'm sure
it's worth it. It does please the poor
fellows. Draws them out of them-
selves, don't you know.”
From a Company notice-board at
the Front:—
“Men must again be warned about matter
they are putting in their letters. No places
where we are or where we are going to are
not to be divulged. Those having done so in
their letters have been obliterated.”
We had no notion that the Military
Censorship was so drastic as that.

IF you were a white rose Columbine
And I were a Harlequin,
I'd leap and sway on my spangled hips
And blow you a kiss with my finger
tips -
To woo a smile to your petal lips
At every glittering spin.
If I were a pig-tailed Buccaneer
And you were a Bristol Girl,
A-rolling home from over the sea
I'd give you a hug on the landing quay,
A hook-nosed parrot that swore like me,
And a brooch of mother-o'-pearl.
If you were a Donna of old Castile
And a Troubadour were I,
I'd sing at night beneath your room
And weave you dreams in a minstrel's
loom
With rainbow tears and the roses'
bloom
And star-shine out of the sky.
If I were a powdered Exquisite
And you were a fair Bellairs,
I'd press your hand in the gay pavane
And whisper under your painted fan
As I bowed you into your blue sedan
At the old Assembly stairs.
If you were a WATTEAU Shepherdess
And I were a gipsy lad,
I'd teach you tunes that the blackbird
trills -
And show you the dance of the daffo-
dils,
The white moon rising over the hills,
And Night in her jewels clad.
If you were the Queen of Make-believe
And I were a Prince o' Dream,
We'd dress the world in a rich romance
With Pans a-piping and Queens that
dance, -
With plume and mantle and rapier
glance
And Beauty's eyes a-gleam.
If I were a Poet, sweet, my own,
And you were my Lady true, -
I'd hymn your praise by night and
In Orn
With golden notes through a silver horn
That unborn men in an age unborn
Might glow with a dream of you!

his habit to part with other
people's money entrusted to
his keeping.
I have a sergeant, an honest
upright man with no compli-
cations in his past, except that
he is a Scot by birth and,
happening to be there at the
outbreak, enlisted in Canada.'
By reason of his uncertain
movements he is unable to
draw his food in the usual
way, and yet insists, tire-
somely, on being fed. So I
said he'd better feed himself,
and I claimed an authority for
him to draw ration money | -
in lieu of rations. Having ||
weathered all the storms of
an administrative correspond-
ence, we eventually came by
the authority itself. This was
a great and happy day in the 2.
lives of myself and the forty-
nine other officers who had by
this time become involved in
the affair. “Sgt. Blank is
authorised to draw ration
money in lieu of rations as
from March 1st, 1916,” I read "
to him, and sighed with relief. But it
was a premature sigh. The trouble
was only just beginning.
“One-and-eightpence a day, no less,
you get, Sergeant,” I said.
He was by now an old hand. “One-
and-eightpence a day I am authorized
to get, Sir," he corrected me.
A man not easily depressed, he took
a cheerful view of the preliminary
condition that he was paid monthly, in
arrear. He proposed to spend his
meal-times, during the rationless and
moneyless days of March, reading the
correspondence: quite enough to engage
a man's whole attention during at least
that period.
April 1st, 1916, duly arrived, and
with it the renewal of the Sergeant's
food question. “What, again?" I
asked, irritably.

374 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 7, 1916.
A PARTIAL PAT ON THE BACK.
Another Little Lecture on the War,
after the style of “The Spectator”
(abbreviated).
IT is no time to waste words in
praise of anybody. We want to give
and mean to give—we may perhaps
even say that we hope to give—the
Cabinet our countenance and some
measure of our approval, but neither
adulation nor encomium. The Editor
of this journal is quite ready to allot the
laurels when they have been earned;
he will be found at his post handing
them out when the time arrives. But
not now. -
It will be said, no doubt . . . (Dele-
tion of what will no doubt be said).
You may ask a man to put his whole
strength into drawing a cork, but un-
less you are a fool you do not, while
the operation is going forward, keep
nagging at him because the cork is too
firmly jammed, nor do you jeer at him
for his lack of prescience in not having
selected a bottle with a wider neck.
You do not ask him strings of useless
questions as to why he doesn't grip
the bottle between his feet or get a
purchase on it with his teeth. Above
all you do not keep handing him tools,
such as a pair of scissors or a button-
hook or a crowbar. No. You concen-
trate earnestly upon the provision of an
efficient corkscrew, if you ever hope to
taste the imprisoned liquor. And mean-
while, “Don’t trip him up" should be
the order of the day; “Don't catch
his eye” should be your watchword;
“Don’t get into the bowler's arm"
should be your motto.
We shall be told, of course . . .
(Deletion of what we shall of course
be told). -
But to discountenance nagging is
not to encourage laudation, adulation,
or encomium, or even praise. These
can wait. The cow, to change the
metaphor, will generally give her milk
all the better if she is not in the act of
being stroked or patted or wreathed
with buttercups.
We shall perhaps evoke the retort
. . . (Deletion of the retort, which will
perhaps be evoked).
So much for the exact attitude which
the Public ought to maintain toward
the Government during the War. Un-
fortunately the Public, or rather a
section of them, have done nothing of
the sort. And that is the reason why,
in spite of good intentions about
adulation and all that, it has become
absolutely necessary for us to step
forward and present the Ministry
with this unsolicited testimonial. The
Government is not what it appears
to be to cross-grained critics seeking
for a rotation of suitable scapegoats.
Ministers are full of glaring faults.
Most of them before the War were
wickedly engaged in doing all sorts of
damage to the country, appalling to
contemplate. But since the War began
they are doing what they can to retrieve
a lurid past, and we believe that His-
tory (our intimate colleague who waits
to endorse at a later stage the views
expressed in these columns) will pro-
nounce that they have displayed great
qualities.
But stay! We are in danger of adula-
tion after all. Let us freely admit that
they are a sorry lot. We have never
been blind to the fact. All the same,
they have shown the greatest of all
qualities in a crisis—dispassion almost
amounting to torpor. There has never
been about them the slightest trace of
hustle or helter-skelter. They have
steered with the greatest deliberation a
course which they thought was the
right one for the ship of state to take.
To change the metaphor, having fixed
the route of the national 'bus they have
refrained from diving down side-streets.
(But there we go again, running off
into laudation. This will not do at all.)
To speak frankly, all the political
tenets of the majority of the Cabinet
are such as can never receive anything
but bitter hostility from this publica-
tion. We can't help it. There is a
gulf fixed, that is how it comes about.
But on the other hand we must not
let this view prevent us—even though,
after all, we are guilty of eulogy—from
recognising their sterling worth. They
are indispensable to the navigation of
the ship of state. To change the
metaphor, we must be content to let
the train be driven by the engine-driver
and not insist upon interference by the
dining-car attendant.
We are well aware that we lay our-
selves open to the charge . . . (Dele-
tion of the charge to which we lay
ourselves open).
Let us then trust the Government,
even blindly. Let our motto be the
immortal words in the “Hunting of the
Snark”; “They had often, the Bellman
said, saved them from wreck : though
none of the sailors knew how.”
THE HAPPY ERROR.
As a rule I am not one to peer over
shoulders and read other people's letters
or papers. But when one is in a queue
waiting for one's passport to be viséd,
and when one has been there for an
hour and still seems no nearer to the
promised land, and when it is the
second time in the day that one has
been in a queue for the same purpose—
once in France and once in England—
years younger than myself.
why, some little deflection from the
narrow path of perfect propriety may
be forgiven.
Moreover in other ways I behaved
better than many of my fellow-trav-
ellers, for I stood loyally behind the
man in front of me in my due place,
and did not, as others did, insinuate
myself from the side into positions
to which, by all the laws of precedence
and decency, they were disentitled.
Indeed I even caught myself wondering
whether, had I any preferential oppor-
tunities of getting through first, as some
Red Cross and otherwise influential
people had, I should make use of them.
To take any advantage of this weary
waiting line of suspects, of which I
was one, would have been almost
monstrous.
So, standing there all patiently and
dejected, moving forward a foot or so
every four or five minutes, no wonder
that I found myself reading the em-
barkation paper which the gentleman
in front of me had filled up and was
holding so legibly before him.
He was tall and solid and calm and
French, with a better cut coat than
most Frenchmen, even the aristocrats,
trouble about. He was broad-should-
ered and erect, and I was piqued to find
him, for all his iron-grey hair, five
His name
was never mind; but I know it. His
profession was given as publicist—as
though he were Mr. ARNOLD WHITE or
Sir HENRY NorMAN, although, for all I
know, Sir HENRY NoFMAN may by now
be a Brigadier-General. His reasons
for visiting England, given in English,
were in connection with his profession.
But after that his English broke down;
for when it came to the question what
was his sex, how do you think he had
answered it 2 I consider that his solu-
tion of the difficulty was an ample
reward to me—and to you, if you too
have any taste in terminological ex-
actitude—for my fracture of a social
convention. The word he had wanted
was either “male" or “masculine";
but they had evaded him. He had
then cast about for English terminology
associated with men, and had thought
vaguely of master and mister. The
result was that the line ran thus:–
“Sex: Masterly.”
And, looking at the publicist's soigné
moustache and firm jaw and broad
hands, I could believe it. But what an
inspiration 1 And, dear me! what will

IDENTIFICATION.
How often the kind of thing occurs
that I am about to describe'
Four or five summers ago, before
the world went mad, I was on one of
DAVID MACBRAYNE's steamers on the
way to a Scotch island. Among the
few passengers was an interesting man,
with whom I fell into conversation.
He was a vigorous, bulky, very tall
man, with a pointed grey beard and a
mass of grey hair under a panama, and
he was bound, he told me, for a well-
known fishing-lodge, whither he went
every August. He had been a great
traveller and knew Persia well; he had
also been in Parliament, and one of his
sons was in the siege of Mafeking. So
much I remember of his affairs; but
his name I did not learn. We talked
much about books, and I put him on
to Doug HTY's Arabia Deserta.
I have often thought of him since
and wondered who he was, and when-
ever I have met fishermen or others
likely to be acquainted with this attrac-
tive and outstanding personality I have
asked about him; but never with success.
And then last week I seemed really to be
on the track, for I found that my new
neighbour in the country has also had
the annual custom of spending a fort-
night or so in the same Scotch island,
and he claims to know everyone who
ever visits that retired spot.
So this is what happened.
“If you're so old an islander as
that,” I said, “you're the very person
to solve the problem that I have carried
about for four or five years. There's
a man who fishes regularly up there”
—and then I described my fellow-pas-
senger. “Tell me,” I said, “who he is.”
He considered, knitting his brows.
“You're sure you're right in saying
he is unusually tall?” he inquired at
last.
“Absolutely,” I replied.
“That's a pity,” he said, “because
otherwise it might be Sir Gerald Orp-
ington. Only he's short. Still, he was
in Parliament right enough. But, of
course, if it was a tall man it's not
Orpington.”
He considered again.
“You say,” he remarked, “that he
had been in Persia? Now old Jack
Beresford is tall enough and has
plenty of hair, but I swear he's never
been to Persia, and of course he hasn't
a son at all. It's very odd. Describe
him again.”
I described my man again, and he
followed every point on his fingers.
“Well,” he said, “I could have sworn
I knew every man who ever fished at
Blank, but this fellow Oh, wait a
minute! You say he is tall and bulky
and had travelled, and his son was in
the Boer War, and he has been in
Parliament? Why, it must be old
Carstairs. And yet it can't be. Car-
stairs was never married and was never
in Parliament.”
He pondered again.
Then he said, “You're sure it wasn't
a clean-shaven bald man with a single
eyeglass 2"
“Quite,” I said.
“Because,” he went on, “if he had
been it would have been old Peterson
to the life.”
“He wasn't bald or clean-shaven,” I
said.
“You’re sure he said Blank?” he
inquired after another interval of pro-
found thought.
“Absolutely,” I replied.
“Tell me again what he was like.
Tell me exactly. I know every one up
there; I must know him.”
“He was a vigorous, bulky, very tall
man,” I said, “with a pointed beard
and a mass of grey hair under a
panama; and he went to Blank every
August. He had been a great traveller
and knew Persia; he had been in
Parliament, and one of his sons was
in the siege of Mafeking.”
“I don't know him,” he said.
“Foreign gentleman desires English lady
to correct him, during one hour every morn-
ing, from 9 to 10.”—Bournemouth Daily Echo. -
There is one foreigner whom innumer-
able English ladies would be delighted
to correct; but he is no gentleman.

the very interesting letter which ap-
peared in your issue of May 29th under
the heading, “Biology at the Front,”
and dealt with the habit acquired by
French poultry of imitating the sound
of flying shells, to relate an experience
which recently befell me. I was seated
at breakfast “Somewhere in France,”
and had ordered, as is my custom, a
boiled egg. When it was brought to
me I proceeded to open it by giving it
a smart tap. The egg immediately
exploded with a loud report, and the
contents were scattered in all directions.
Those at table with me at once threw
themselves prostrate on the ground,
and one, whose olfactory nerves were
excessively developed, exhibited every
symptom of being gassed. On ques-
tioning the innkeeper we learnt that
the egg had been laid some weeks
before by a hen in the neighbourhood
of the Front. I had previously noticed
that it was elongated in shape, the
small end being pointed and the base
end nearly flat, while the whole was
cased in a shell.
The continuance of this imitative
habit would be a strange perpetual
memorial of the Great War—particu-
larly for Pacificist politicians.
Yours, &c., DARWINIAN.
The Ashpit, Egham.

HAs LoRD KITCHENER, IN, HIS PASSIONATE DESIRE To ENcouBAGE THE VolunTEERs, EveR THoughT of THE UNTAPPEn
REsources oF THE ToweR of LoNDON ?
Monday, May 29th. — When Mr.
ANDERSON alleged that a certain firm,
has that right, endorsed Mr. SAMUEL's
appeal, Mr. McKENNA took refuge un-
desirous of getting its employés ex- der a point of order—rather an exiguous
empted, had “hospitably entertained"

mon and champagne rose before the
mind's eye. But when we learned from
the Ministerial reply that the refresh-
ment alluded to consisted of “tea and
bread - and - butter" the vision faded
away. Those innocent viands could not
connote corruption.
propos of tribunals, the House
learned with delight that the military
representative at Middlesbrough is Mr.
HUSTLER HUSTLER. Obviously the
Government have at last discovered
“the man of push and go” for whom
they were looking a year ago.
Mr. McKENNA was a little short-
tempered this afternoon. He first
descended heavily upon Mr. SAMUEL
SAMUEL, who had suggested that it
was time to issue another War Loan,
instead of borrowing so heavily upon
Treasury Bills. The hon. member, he
declared, had no right to speak for
that mysterious entity, “the City.”
When Sir F. BANBURY, who indubitably
A pic-
ture of the tribunal replete with sal-
of the Volunteers as to whether they
are regarded by the War Office as a
very present help in time of trouble or
as a confounded nuisance will hardly
be removed by Lord KITCHENER's
speech. True he said many nice things
about them, and particularly about the
behaviour of the Dublin corps during
the insurrection, but when it came to a
tangible recognition of their usefulness
he had very little to offer. All the
money available was required for the
Army. The Volunteers must be con-
tent with such part-worn equipment
and old-fashioned weapons as he could
find them.
On the Consolidated Fund Bill
Mr. FELL and other Members for East
Anglia represented very poignantly the
woes inflicted upon their constituencies
by the air and sea raids. Fishermen
and lodging-house keepers were alike
deprived of their livelihood. Could not
the Government do something for them,
either by billeting soldiers or by direct
grants-in-aid 2
Mr. HAYEs Fisher in reply exuded
sympathy at every pore. The previous
speakers had, as he said, painted “a
deplorable picture of gloom,” and he
laid on the colours from an even more
opulent palette. But on the question
of actual relief he was painfully in-
definite. Billeting—that was a ques-
tion for the War Office; grants—they
were a matter for the Treasury. The
East Anglers who thought their fish
safely hooked had to go away empty.
Wednesday, May 31st.—Not content
with having laid sacrilegious hands on
the clock, the Government have now
deranged the calendar and kicked Whit-
Monday into August. But it is all in
the good cause of piling up shells
against the Bosches, so the House
cheerfully approved the PRIME MINIs-
TER's announcement.
For some days there have been
rumours of an impending attack upon
Lord KitchENER, to be led by Colonel
CHURCHILL. Perhaps that was why
Mr. TENNANT, who moved the Vote
for the War Office, decided to get his
blow in first. His short speech began
with a jibe at his critic's strategical
omniscience, though it is not true
that he referred to him as “the right
hon. and recently gallant gentleman";

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
proceeded with a denial of most of his
assumptions, and ended with a high
tribute to Lord KITCHENER's prevision
in raising a great army to cope with a
long war.
Colonel CHURCHILL did not pick up
the gage thus ostentatiously thrown
down, but some of his friends were less
discreet, and developed a close-range
assault upon Lord KITCHENER. The
PRIME MINISTER is never seen to greater
advantage than when he is defending a
colleague, and he declared that the
WAR SECRETARY was personally entitled
to the credit for the amazing expansion
of the army.
Unofficial tributes were not wanting.
Sir MARK SYKEs asserted that in Ger-
many the WAR SECRETARY was feared
as a great organiser, while in the East
his name was one to conjure with ;
and Sir GEORGE REID declared that
his chief fault was that he was “not
clever at circulating the cheap coin of
calculated civilities which enable in-
ferior men to rise to positions to which
they are not entitled.”
Thursday, June 1st.—In moving that
the House should at its rising adjourn
until June 20th, the PRIME MINISTER
felt it necessary to remove any impres-
sion that the Government, while asking
everybody else to sacrifice their Whit-
sun holiday, were themselves going
junketing.
Like Old ToM MoRRIs, who rebuked
a would-be Sunday golfer by saying
“if you don't want your Sabbath rest
the links do,” he pointed out that the
continuous sittings of the House threw
a double burden not only upon Ministers
—one of whom, Mr. RUNCIMAN, has
unhappily broken down—but also upon
the permanent officials. Even Mem-
bers of Parliament, he slily added,
might be under a misapprehension in
supposing that constant attendance at
the House was the best way in which
they could discharge their duty to their
country in time of war.
The Nationalist Members are doing
their best to “give LLOYD GEORGE a
chance.” True, they ask an inordinate
number of questions arising out of the
hot Easter week in Dublin—when, ac-
cording to the local wit, it was “'98 in
the shade"—but otherwise they have
sternly repressed any tendency to fac-
tiousness. Yesterday, when a free-
lance sought to move the adjournment
of the House in order to denounce the
continuance of martial law in Ireland,
not a single other Member rose to sup-
port him; and to - day, though Mr.
DILLON could not resist the temptation
to make a speech on the same subject,
he showed a refreshing restraint.
Only once—when he declared that

more humane in their own interests
not to bring them to trial at once, for
that would mean a crop of convictions
and sentences which would increase

Mr. AsquitH in reply was sympa-
thetic but firm. The Government were
not deaf to the plea for leniency which
had been addressed to them by all Irish
representatives, by Sir EDWARD CARson
as well as by Mr. REDMOND. But they
could not give an undertaking that
there should be an end of the courts-
martial. As for the persons deported
from Ireland, for whom Mr. DILLON

Mr. JoHN O'Connor developed a
really ingenious argument. To show
that martial law ought now to be
dropped he mentioned that if he at-

Members who were thinking of spend-
ing the recess in Ireland were greatly
impressed.

AT THE PLAY.
“FISHPINGLE."
Sir Geoffrey Pomfret, “that almighty
man, the county god,” claimed to exer-
cise the same divine right over the
souls of his village that he exercised, in
the matter of breeding, over the bodies
of his cattle and pigs. Nothing, I
think, has brought the present War
more closely home to my bosom than
the humours of this feudal relic—
taken in all seriousness by everyone,
including the author. It seems almost
inconceivable that Mr. VACHELL's play
deals with conditions that still survived
only a few years ago. Yet the Squire's
devotion to the science of eugenics.
establishes its date as quite recent. It
was his sole taint of modernity; and
indeed where his own son's marriage
was concerned he omitted to apply his
scientific principles, and made a choice
for him in which no regard was paid to
eugenics, but only to established social
traditions.
At first the play opened up prospects
of a pleasant gaiety. A love scene,
conducted in a rich Western brogue,
between the Squire's footman and his
still-room maid, and the embarrassment
caused by her eagerness to learn the
philosophy of “eujanics,” were full of
promise. It was confirmed by the ap-
pearance of Mr. AINLEY, whose manner
reminded us of his many triumphs in
the art of eccentric detachment. His
part—the title-rôle—was that of Sir
Geoffrey's faithful butler, on such
familiar, though respectful, terms with
his master that the two sipped port
together in the former's room in broad
daylight while discussing family mat-
ters. They took an unconscionable
time about it, but, as I said, it promised
well. However, Mr. VACHELL had
other designs than our mere amuse-
ment. We were not to have our comedy
without paying for it with our heart's
blood. Very soon the shadow of melo-
dramatic pathos and mystery crept
over the sunny scene. Fishpingle takes
a box from a cupboard and glances at
a miniature and a bundle of letters.
There is illegitimacy in the air, and a
lady near me in the stalls confides to
her neighbour that “he's the Squire's
half-brother.” I can't think where she
got her information, for the rest of us
never learned the facts of the mystery
till the very end of the evening, and
even then the details of Fishpingle's
origin only transpired (as they say)
under extreme pressure arising out of
his dismissal by his master on the
strength of a violent disagreement
about fundamentals.
Sir Geoffrey's father, it seems, had
before his marriage run away with a
girl not of his own rank, who had
generously refused to spoil the family
tree by marrying him; and Fishpingle
was the result. You might judge from
the peculiarity of his surname that
the matter was taken lightly by his
parents. But you would be wrong.
His mother died when he was born,
and his first name (for I cannot call it a
Christian name) was Benoni, which,
being interpreted, means “the child of
sorrow.” Sir Geoffrey's grandmother,
who had discouraged the legal adjust-
ment of the relationship between the
lovers, had tried to repair matters by
educating Fishpingle above the ob-
scurity of his irregular birth ; hence
his comparative erudition, rare in a
butler. -
Now the opening of the play had

put me into a mood which was not
the right one for the reception of this
extract from a deplorable past. Some
comedies would be all the better for a
little tragic relief; but this was too
much. Mr. VACHELL had no business
to give his play a title like Fishpingle.
He should have called it “Nature's
Nobleman, or The Tragical Romance
of a Faithful Butler's Birth,” and then
I might have known what to expect.
As it was I felt aggrieved. It was not,
of course, a question of asking for my
money back at the doors (critics, to be
just to them, never do this in the case
of a complimentary seat), but I felt I
had a right to protest against this
attempt to harrow my heart-strings,
attuned as they were to the key of
comedy, with a painful drama dating
back to more than half a century before
the rise of the curtain, and with its
chief actors all dead. And the irri-
tating mystery in which it was
wrapped only made things worse. Fur-
ther, I suffered a considerable strain
on both my head and my heart in con-
sequence of obscure hints (vaguely in-
volving a photograph on his mantel-
piece) as to the reason why Fishpingle
remained a bachelor to the bitter end.
But I am ashamed to appear flippant,
for Mr. AINLEY played with exquisite
feeling and a fine sincerity. And I
have to thank Mr. VACHELL for giving
us some excellent studies of character
—not character developed before our
eyes by circumstance (except perhaps
a little at the last), but admirably ob-
served as a kind of fixture to be taken
with the house.
And if the play is not quite on the
high level of Mr. GALsworthy's The
Eldest Son, which it faintly recalls, it is
much more worthy of Mr. WACHELL's
gifts than the poor thing, Penn, which
died so young. Also he is very much
more fortunate this time in his cast.
Miss MARIoN TERRY, as Lady Pomfret,
was a pattern of sweet graciousness;
and Mr. ALLAN AYNEsworth was at his
happiest as Sir Geoffrey. And the two
pairs of lovers, Mr. CYRIL RAYMond
and Miss MAUD BELL above stairs, and
Mr. REGINALD BACH and Miss Doris
Lytton below (they were really all of
them on the ground floor, the butler's
room being the common trysting-place),
served as delightful examples of natural
selection—both on their own part and
that of the management—and were as
fresh and healthy as the most eugenical
could desire. O. S
“DADDY LONG-LEGs.”
Daddy Long - Legs is a pleasant
American sentimental comedy made by
JEAN WEBstER out of her very jolly
book, and not so sticky as some of our
importations of the same general type.
The four Acts are phases in the deve-
lopment of Judy (or Jerusha) Abbott,
orphan; and, as normally happens in
book-plays, development is extremely
abrupt. Act I. shows us Judy as the
drudge of the orphanage breaking into
flame of rebellion on the day of the
visit of the trustees. Naturally the
trustees are all trustees pour rine, ex-
cept one real good rich man, Jervis
Pendleton, who admires the orphan's
spirit, and decides that she is to have
her chance at his charges; but is on
no account to know her benefactor.
In Act II., a year later, Judy is not
merely the most popular but the best
dressed girl in her college. She still
dreams about her unknown benefactor,
whom she calls Daddy Long-Legs,

MUSINGS ON MILK-CANS.
WHEN I travel up to London by an early morning train
Or return into the country when the day is on the wane,
At the smallest railway station
There's a dreadful demonstration
Which causes me unmitigated pain.
I'm aware that milk is needed for our infant girls and boys;
That it aids adult dyspeptics to regain “digestive poise";
But I've never comprehended
Why its transport is attended
By the maximum of diabolic noise.
I admit the railway porter who can deftly twirl a can
In each hand along the platform is no ordinary man;
But what kills me is the banging
And the clashing and the clanging
As he hurls them in or hauls them from the van.
Now if some new material for these vessels could be found—
Non-metallic and in consequence a silencer of sound—
There would be within our borders
Fewer nerve and brain disorders
And more of moral uplift to go round.
I know a dashing journalist, a credit to his trade,
Who's always in the thick of it whenever there's a raid.
Bombs of various sorts and sizes
He describes and analyses,
But he can't endure a long milk-cannonade.
I've written to our Member, Dr. Philadelphus Snell,
To ask a question in the House—I think he'd do it well—
If our cows' nerves should be mangled
By the way their milk is jangled;
And, if he doesn't play, I'll try GINNELL.

“We give these things long words. We talk of the ‘triumph
of organisation.' Is it not simpler to say—that when a man knows
exactly what, he wants done, exactly how every part of it should be
done, and can pick a man for each task, and apportion his require-
ments to what is possible; and then, by far the most important thing
of all, can so deal with the many under his command that each is
most furiously anxious to do what the leader wants — why then,
things go right.”—Westminster Gazette.
The answer is in the negative.
“There is much matter for thinking over in the observations of

Press, and then sit down with smiling
face and begin an article for Germany:
“I sit in a hovel amongst the ruins of
Fleet Street, with the wreck of the
armoured fort of St. Paul's in view. I
hear a stir outside. A wild mob of
conscientious objectors is beating a re-
cruiting officer to death. Such things
happen hourly in defeated Albion.”
My series of London, Liverpool, Man-
chester and Birmingham—all in ashes
—has proved so successful that I pro-
pose to cover all the large towns and
construct a Baedeker of ruins.
Yet I pride myself more on my work
for England's Press. My German
articles have all to be in the same
vein. Only the Boom Press exists in
Germany. But in England one can
vary one's view and do artistic work.
You must have read my story of the
struggle for the last sausage in a Frank-
fort butcher's shop—how the troops in-
tervened and the crowd attacked them,
and how ultimately 1,400 civilians
were mown down with machine guns
—and the sausage was eaten by the
General Officer commanding the Army
Corps that suppressed the rising. You
must also have seen my description
of the KAISER—his white hair, bent
shoulders, deathlike look as he passed,
protected by his Guards from the wild
fury of the Berlin mob. Of course I
have another KAISER, the bright smiling
man whose youth seems to have been
renewed by the War, who waves his
hand to the madly enthusiastic crowds
waiting round the Palace for a glimpse
of their divinity.
You must have read my secret inter-
views with distinguished Germans, who
whispered to me that HINDENBURG had
thrown down his sword and declared
that if the useless slaughter did not
cease he would march on Berlin. I
have told you their promises of bloody
revolutions and fierce risings. Also I
have given you interviews with other
distinguished Germans, who confided
to me that now Germany could turn
out one submarine and one Zeppelin
every week-day and two on Sundays,
and I have thrilled you with the details
of the great trade war which will come
directly peace is declared, when Ger-
many will win back all her wealth
by selling everything fifty per cent.
below cost.
How my dinners vary in that strange
Teutonic land I pay twenty marks
for two tiny slices of fish, a thin piece
of indigestible potato bread, and a
section of rancid sausage. At other
times I spend two marks and get a
delightful meal which could not be
procured in a London restaurant for
five shillings. I walk through Berlin
and see scarcely a cripple or a wounded
man. I let you know that ninety-
five per cent. of German wounded,
owing to the skill of German doctors,
go back to the Front in a week. To
other English readers I confide that
all the maimed, wounded and blind
are sent into the very centre of Ger-
many. There are huge districts without
a whole man in them.
Did you ask for the actual facts 2 I
will give you one—and it is this: the
only persons in Germany whose waist-
measurements have increased in the
War are the neutral journalists.

[JUNE 7, 1916.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Is Hearts of Alsace (SMITH, ELDER) your interest will be
held less by the actual story than by the profoundly moving
and poignant picture that Miss BETHAM-EDwards has
drawn of life in the Reichsland under the increasing burden
of Prussian tyranny. It is a picture that one feels to be
absolutely true. The author writes of what she knows.
This Alsatian family—old Jean Barthélemy, the city father,
crushed and embittered by the fate of his loved Mulhouse;
his two daughters and the circle of their friends within the
town—all live and move and look longingly towards the
West, as so many others must have done these forty and
odd years past. The plot, what there is of it, concerns the
clandestine love of Claire, the petted younger daughter of
the Gley house, for an officer in the conqueror's host, whom
she had met during a visit to Strasburg. Claire marries
her Kurt, a shady worth- - - - - -
less knave, and, as the
book ends with the out-
break of war, is left to an
unknown fate. Very stir-
ring are the chapters that ||
tell of the tumultofemotion
that broke loose when the
French guns were heard in
Mulhouse; though here—
as in all those war stories
whose only satisfactory
end is the final confusion
of Kaiserdom—one feels
that there is a chapter
yet to be added. Miss
BETHAM-EDwARDs writes
with all the vigour (I
might add all the garrulity)
of intense personal feeling.
Her book, as a race study,
is a real contribution to
the literature of the War.

me less patience with the preposterous kind, which, as
a motive in fiction, usually consists in the hero inviting
all and sundry to trample upon his prospects and reputa-
tion. This is what the chief character in Proud Peter
(HUTCHINsoN) did. He began by allowing it to be supposed
that he was the father of his brother's illegitimate child,
the bright peculiar fatuousness of which pretence was that
thereby the said brother was enabled to marry, and break
the heart of, the heroine, whom, of course, Peter himself
adored. Also, many years after, when the child, now an
objectionable young man, may more, an actor, was pursuing
another heroine with his unwelcome attentions, he very
nearly spiked Peter's guns, on being threatened, by exclaim-
ing, “I am thy son”—or words to that effect. Fortunately,
however, there existed, as I had somehow known would be
the case, a signed photograph that put all that right.
Why, I wonder, is Mr. W. E. Norris always so sharp
with the dramatic profession ? Was it not in one of his
earlier stories that somebody quite seriously questions

ARTHUR GREEN's The Story of a Prisoner of War
(CHATTo AND WINDUs) can be recommended to all who
can still digest the uncooked facts. “I can swear,” he
says, “that all that is written is Gospel truth,” but
without any such assurance it would be impossible for
even the most sceptical to doubt the writer's honesty.
Wounded and taken prisoner in August, 1914, he suffered
severely at the hands of the Germans, and his account of
the camp at Wittenburg does nothing to decrease one's
loathing for that pestilential spot. For many reasons it
is a sad tale, and not the least of them is the evidence
it gives that a civilized race can sink to such depths of
cruelty and cowardice. Perhaps the only people to whom
it will give any comfort are those who have sent food and

the sea in ships—the Cockroach, the Mosquito, the Rat,
the Biscuit-Weevil and others. Of each Dr. SHIPLEY has
some pleasant word of instruction or comment to say, in
his own highly entertaining manner. I like, for example,
his remark about the mosquito (whose infinite variety is
recognised in no fewer than five chapters), that, if he could
talk, the burden of his song would be that of the guests at
the dinner-party in David Copperfield—“Give us blood ' " |

worth its modest eighteen-pence to those on land who may

ones who are defending them upon the sea.

According to the German official an-
nouncement, the sinking of the Lützow
was concealed for “military reasons.”
It is only reasonable to assume that
other and larger prevarications con-
cerning the North Sea battle may be
ascribed to “naval reasons.”
:: :
A remarkable omission from the
German account of the Naval battle
off Jutland is observed. There is no
mention of the destruction of H.M.S.
Blockade. . .
According to the Croy-

mittee, “readers are turn-
ing to Thackeray, Dickens,
George Eliot, and Jane
Austen for relief from war

Reports from all the agricultural
districts refer in glowing terms to
the cheerful manner in which women

The popularity of police
passes is due to the fact
that they can often be
kept and used as a testi-

received the following:
“Mr. is known to all

Who saw your work accomplished ere at length

Had bent your stature or resolved the strength

Great was your life, and great the end you made,
As through the plunging seas that whelmed your

Your spirit passed, unconquered, unafraid,
To join the gallant dead.
But not by death that spell could pass away
That fixed our gaze upon the far-off goal,
Who, by your magic, stand in arms to-day

He. Oh, please do not worry me, my dear Martha.
After what I have been forced to go through it is a wonder
that I am here at all.
She. What—have you been seeing him again? I thought
he was away with one of the armies and you would be
having a holiday. -
He. So did I think; but it was not to be. Holiday,
indeed! When do I ever get even a moment in which to
think my own thoughts? .
She. At any rate I hope he acknowledged what Germany
owes to you. Where would he have been, I wonder, if it
had not been for your constant devotion to his service
throughout this terrible time? Does he realise what that
has meant for him and his?
He. Kaisers never realise anything. That's my experi-
ence of one of them, at any rate. If you flatter them they
smile on you and take all the credit of your work. But I
am not cut out of that sort of wood, and the result is that
he looks at me as if he had bitten into a lemon by mistake.
You know that look, don't you?
She. Yes, my poor Theobald, I know that look. It
makes everything black and uncomfortable. But if he is
like that and does not consider your feelings, why do you
continue to serve him 2 You should assert yourself, and if
he does not improve you should send in your resignation.
After all there are better things in the world than to be
Chancellor to a man who does not appreciate your work.
He. Of course I have thought of that, but I have put
the idea aside. If I were to resign now it would only give
joy to my enemies, and they are the last people in the world
to whom I wish to give joy. He won't get rid of me just
yet, for he finds me too useful as a lightning-conductor.
Still, I know that some day, he'll give me a push by
sending me a letter condoling with me on the state of my
health, and then good-bye to the office of Chancellor.
She. And, for my part, Theobald, I hope that time will
come soon, though I shudder to think what will become of
the country when you go. However, we won't talk of
that any more. Tell me rather what he has been saying to
you to-day.
He. Oh, to-day he was displeased with my speech in the
Reichstag.
She. Displeased with that beautiful speech so sun-clear
and patriotic ' Why, the man must be mad. Never in all
my life, have I read anything so patriotic and convincing.
What does he complain of 2
He, What does he not complain of 2 First, he is angry
that I defend myself against attacks made in an anony-
mous pamphlet.
She. Then I am sure he wrote it himself or inspired it.
He. I have not the evidence to prove that, but it is, of
course, possible. It would be just like him to play me a
trick like that. But what chiefly provoked his anger was
what I said about the naval battle.
She. Yes, I remember you said that England was not
thereby defeated. If you will pardon me, Theobald, I my-
self thought that this was a rash statement.
He. So you're going to turn against me too, are you?
It was a true statement, whatever he or you may say.
They lost ships, yes, and we lost ships too, and we can
afford to lose ships much less that the English can. What
is the use of pretending that we've won the War and
beaten down England because our sailors shot straight and
fought bravely? So did the English, and they've got more
ships left than we have, more's the pity.
She. But he has made a glorification speech about it,
hasn't he 2 -
He. Yes, he has. In another day or two he will have
worked himself up to the point of believing that he com-
manded our ships in the battle. I know him; but he
needn't think I'm going to encourage him in this laugh-
able pretension.
She. Do not think about him any more, but go to bed
and have a good sleep.
He. I will try, but the telephone will ring, I am sure,
and he will command me to come and see him. (The tele-
phone rings.) There, I told you so.

Never mind about the rest of it. “De mortibus" is enough,
thank you.
“Deep down in the ship I came across a strange sight. Some
twenty or thirty boys, seated at desks, were being taught the mys-
teries of compound fractures by a petty officer.”—Liverpool Daily Post.

out, and the porter had heard them.
The porter knows German, Jimmy
says; he learned it before the War
began from a German whose luggage
he had put into the wrong train.
When the German spy was searched
it was found that he hadn't much
money, and the policeman said he must
have bought the concertina and label
to try to get people to give him money
and so work his way to the coast.
It turned out afterwards that he had
escaped from a concentrated camp,
Jimmy says. When Jimmy told the
milkman about it, the milkman said
that it was “Ha, ha, one more feather
plucked from the horde of German rats
that pollute the air with their diabolical
designs.”
He was just telling Jimmy that the
KAISER was standing on the brink of
a deep abscess, when he heard Jimmy's
bloodhound taking his horse home to
put it to bed, and this disturbed his
flow of thought.

THE SUPER-LUTHERAN CHURCH.
[The Tägliche Rundschau has published an
article by Judge voN ZASTRow, of Berlin, on
the Future National Church. It is to unite
religion and love of the Fatherland; to recon-
cile the Sermon on the Mount with war; to
make room for Pietists, Materialists, and
Laodiceans; and to remove all sectional and
sectarian differences. In short, the Church
will bathe itself in “the new streams of German
power, it will drink from the water which will
make our German Will strong and healthy
for battle. Our German piety, our German
Christianity will assume an heroic colouring,
in place of the sentimental tone which has
hitherto characterised it.”]
WHEN the fighting is finally over,
And victory smiles on our land,
And we're living in comfort and clover,
We must take our religion in hand;
We must make it heroic and German,
With “Fatherland-love” as its fount;
We must reconcile War with the Ser-
Innon
Once preached on the Mount.
"Twill embrace the disciples of
HAECKEL's
Monistic material creed,
The Mammonite worship of shekels,
The gospel of hunger and greed;
And the layman, so Laodicean,
No more his devotions will shirk,
But will kneel with the mild Manichean,
The amiable Turk.
In fine, there'll be nothing sectarian
In Germany's National Church;
And the pedants, Pelagian and Arian,
Will be knocked from their petulant
perch;
All paltry divisions 'twill level
That tend to enfeeble the Hun,
And the worship of God and the Devil
Will merge into one.

UNCHARTED SEAS.
HE boarded the 'bus just as it
was leaving Piccadilly Circus. “Full
ahtside,” chanted the conductor, so
the A.B. squeezed into a totally in-
adequate space between a girl of
sixteen and an elderly and benevolent-
looking lady. Squaring himself forward,
he placed a hand like a boxing-glove
on either knee and glanced genially
up and down the 'bus. He was a
large man, dark and hairy, and it was
quite easy to associate him with pig-
tails, tar and cutlasses. After the first
impression there came to one a sense
of something odd and un-nautical.
Then one became suddenly aware that,
instead of the regulation Navy cap, he
was wearing a rough woollen tam-
o'-shanter, which hung coyly over one
ear.
A thin man in a top-hat was the
first to notice it.
“Still pretty cold in the North Sea?”
he ventured, with an eye upon the
tam-o'-shanter.
“So I've 'eard,” the sailor replied
guardedly; “but this 'ere,” he touched
his headgear, “ain't an Arctic brow-
mitten. I got this from a friend, 'avin'
lost me own little 'at jest after the
second torpedo was fired.”
“Gracious !” ejaculated the elderly
lady, and the occupants of the 'bus
became magnetised to attention.
“Now that's extremely interesting,”
exclaimed the thin man with a nervous
movement of his hand; “could you
tell us the name of the ship 2"
“Can't say as I can, Sir,” was the
discouraging reply.
“Of course not, of course not,”
spluttered a testy old gentleman in
white spats; “a very injudicious ques-
tion in a public conveyance.” He glared
at the thin man with intention.
“Sort o' fancy name she 'ad,” the
sailor continued, quite unmoved by this
outburst : “fact she was a bit fancy
all round.”
“Ha! disguised, I presume?” ex-
claimed the old gentleman, his discretion
for a moment overcome.
“Did she float for any length of
time after being torpedoed?” The
thin man put the question with a
legal incisiveness.
“Went to pieces like a paymaster's
digestion as soon as the second mouldy
ot 'er. Most unnatural.”
He rubbed his forehead with the back
of his hand and ruminated on the
peculiarity of it.
“I suppose you got dreadfully wet?”
the elderly lady asked feelingly.
“Well, Mum,” he said gravely, “I
wasn't exactly dry. Yer see, after the
show sharp squalls set in from the
Sou’-west, an’ me 'avin' made fast to
my mate's bow awnin', I 'adn't no
claim to the umbereller. So I did get
a bit soused round the superstructure,
but not, so to speak, flooded right down
to my propeller casins.”
“Dear ! dear! How truly terrible.”
She relapsed into silence convulsively,
while the old gentleman wheezed with
great ferocity and muttered something
about a good answer to a d d silly
question.
“A submarine, of course 2" The
thin man pursued his examination
relentlessly. -
“So we presoomed from events which
'appened later.” -
“Artful them blinkin'—beg pardon,
ladies—pirits is,” vouchsafed a man of
toil from the far end of the 'bus; “my
brother wot's— ”
“All this occurred at night, I assume?”
the old gentleman interrupted snappily.
“Yes, Sir, it was an evenin' perform-
ance.” He glanced out into the murky
night. “Put me down at Sydney
Terrace,” he said to the conductor.
“Wy, ye're there nah,” grumbled that
caustic individual as he jerked sharply
at the bell-cord.
“Well,” exclaimed the thin man as
the sailor rose to go, “I congratulate
you very heartily on your good luck—
very heartily indeed . "
For the first time the hero of the
incident seemed to exhibit signs of
impatience. -
“Good luck!” he repeated sarcastic-
ally. “Call it good luck to 'ave your

QUESTION AND ANSWER.
I. - -
“A GENTLEMAN seeking information
for forthcoming book about the recent
developments and inventions in Glass
and Pottery manufacture, also Bottle-
making, would be pleased to hear from
anyone capable of furnishing such in-
formation.”—The Times.
II.
DEAR SIR,--It is very fortunate that
I caught sight of your advertisement,
for I am just the man you need. You
want to know all about bottles and
things. I can tell you.
Let us begin with pottery.
Pottery is made in the Five Towns,
a district in the Midlands to which
references may be found by the indus-
trious, using a microscope, in the works
of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, the famous
Caledonian Market salesman. How it
is made I have not room here to indi-
cate, but its effect on those who make
it is to fill their lives with romance and
excitement. Thus, if they don't become
Town Councillors for Hanbridge they
join the School Board at Hanley; and
if they are not taking the new tram to
Burslem they are catching the fast ||
train to Manchester at Knype.
And now for glass.
Glass is an invisible substance made ||
in some mysterious way. It is used
for a multiplicity of things, but prin-
cipally for windows and bottles. It is
when used for windows that its special
quality of transparency comes in so
happily, for it enables you to see
through. This, when it is the window
of a hat shop and you are out with your
wife or fiancée, is not an unmixed
blessing, but at other times it can be
very convenient. Thus, when looking
through the window, oneself being
carefully concealed behind the blind,
one can see undesirable callers ap-
proaching and beat a safe retreat.
Windows can also be shut, both in
houses and railway carriages, and thus
keep the place warm and pleasantly
insanitary and comfortable. It has
been said that the pure air of many
German towns is due to the fact that
the Germans keep their windows shut.
Glass is also used for the chimneys of
lamps, which, when the wick is turned
up too high, as it usually is, break.
It is employed furthermore in the
manufacture of glass eyes, which, as
all who have visited A Kiss for
Cinderella know, do not always match
the real ones.
But the best thing that glass does is
to become bottles. Bottles are of two
kinds : one kind for medicine, and the
less said about those the better; and

the other for wine. It was a happy
thought which substituted glass for
the skin and leather of which earlier
bottles were made, for one can now
see, by holding it to the light, how
little the bottle contains, and order
another. The principal fault of bottles
is that they are rarely big enough. A
half-bottle does not contain sufficient
for one, and a whole bottle rarely satis-
fies two. Some men are so lost to
shame as to set only one bottle of wine
before three or even four persons.
Before the War old bottles were
used chiefly as targets in rifle saloons.
Now that they have become scarce, and
targets are made in Germany, they are
worth money and should be carefully
saved.
Glass is useful also for making
glasses — the receptacles from which
wine is drunk. Without glasses we
should be hard put to it to consume
our liquor and should have to resort
to half-cocoanuts, cups, the hollow of
the hand, or even sponges.
Just at the moment bottles—I mean
the more genial variety—are under a
cloud. It is a penal offence to sell a
bottle before noon, between half-past
two and half-past six, and after half-past
nine at night. But they are expected
to come to their own again when Peace
is celebrated.
I think that is all.

“'Ave You FETCHEd Down MANY ZEPPERLEANs THIs MoRNING”
D.A.
IT is very odd how suddenly and
completely a new idea gets about.
Yesterday you had never heard of it, or
not in any way to take notice of it;
to-day. you hear about it consciously
for the first time, and to-morrow it is a
commonplace of conversation.
It is so with U.A.
I had, of course, heard of U.A. as a
menace, a hidden terror, the old man's
dread, the 'bon vivant's heritage, and so
forth. But only vaguely. No one had
talked about it; I had seen the words
in advertisements and had forgotten
them again. I had never associated
myself with them. Whatever might
happen to me, U.A. would be unrepre-
sented. -
And then the blow fell. Suddenly
U.A. became omnipresent. I met a
friend who only last week I had found
doing himself with his customary thor-
oughness at dinner. This evening he
was dining again, but his sole com-
panion was a chilly and depressing
bottle of French natural water.
“What is this 2 " I asked.
economy?”
“No,” he said; “merely U.A.”
I should have thought little of that
were it not that half-an-hour later I
overheard two men talking about the
difficulty of getting rid of U.A. once it
had established itself.
“War
Another man, to whom I complained
of some trifling discomfort, said it was
probably U.A. . . . . .
An hour later I was sitting at a farce
which, like all the farces in London at
the present moment, is the funniest
thing ever staged—only this, if the
management is to be believed, is more
so; and the only thing I was able to
laugh at was a joke about U.A.,
The next morning I received a letter
from a solicitous relation warning me
to be more careful or I should be at the
mercy of U.A.
And to crown all I went to see a
doctor about something really quite
negligible, and, after beginning by con-
jecturing that it was due to U.A., he
ended by feeling certain of it.
He asked me a hundred questions
about myself, and after every reply he
said eithér, “That's U.A.,” or, “U.A.
again.” - - - -
“Almost everything that is wrong
with people,” he said finally, “is caused
by U.A.” - -
I came away feeling thoroughly
fashionable, but also dejected beyond
words, for he had condemned me to a
régime from which every spark of
happiness was excluded. -
I have since become a source of
embarrassment to my friends, for more
than half the nice things that everyone
else eats and all the nice things that
they drink are denied me. U.A. forbids.
Wine—oh no. Spirits—not on your life.

very unwise. And so forth. . . .
As for my own kitchen, which does
not think very quickly, it considers me
mad; and after one of the melancholy
meals that are now my lot I am dis-
posed to agree.
The question I ask myself is, Which
is it to be—a long life of joyless food and
no U.A., or a shorter but merrier life
with U.A. thrown in 2 And “What's
the harm in a little U.A. anyway?” I
say as I light a forbidden cigar.
However I answer the great problem,
of one thing I am certain, and that is
that with all this U.A. about there
ought to be a restaurant with enough
intelligence to provide an anti Uric
Acid menu.

BEEN MOST UNPLEASANT FOR ME sonſ ETIMEs when I HAVE SPokEN TO LIKELY - LookING MEN, ORLY TO FIND THEY HAVE
ALREADY SERVED.’’
IT REALLY HAs
THE SAFETY-VALVE.
THE trouble started a week ago,
when the eagle eye of a Very Great
Man chanced on a piece of paper lying
in the neighbourhood of our camp. On
being hastily summoned, I could not
offhand give any reasonable explana-
tion of its presence. To any lesser
personage I should undoubtedly have
proved it to belong to one of the A.S.C.
people who live next door; but as it
was I could only agree that it was a
piece of paper, and as such was serving
no useful purpose.
Two days later the blow fell. The
W.G.M. would inspect the camp, and
us in full marching order, the follow-
ing day.
In the meantime we had learnt that
several neighbouring camps had been
tried thus, found wanting, and soundly
strafed. From them we gleaned some
useful hints:—
(1) That any unnecessary oddments,
human or other, left lying about in
caustic comment;
(2) That tired or dissipated-looking
animals, soiled harness or lustre-
less buttons would probably bring
about atmospheric changes on
parade; and
(3) That pieces of paper would mean
indefinite home leave for somebody.
It was still moonlight when our
cloud of skirmishers was abroad. The
camp is entirely on soft sand, so that
burying is a beautifully simple opera-
tion. In every tent parties could be
seen rapidly putting home-made chairs,
beds, boxes, tins and cooking utensils
below ground. Personally I was
fastening my less sleek mules to a
somewhat soiled waggon, collecting
odd men who wouldn't be nice for the
great to see, and despatching the lot
behind a neighbouring wood. They
looked very like a troupe of roving
gipsies. A sentry was posted in case
the W.G.M. should come round the wood,
when the troupe would, with infinite
stealth, track round in his wake.
Eventually the camp was an absolute
picture—not a superfluous article in
view; kits dressed with mathematical
exactitute; cookhouse spotless, with a
faultlessly attired cook fingering his
|implements in the manner indicated in
the camp would be certain to elicit
the text-book. On the horse-lines were
stablemen, assiduously raking away at
wisps of straw previously laid down
for the purpose.
He arrived about five minutes early,
but the last tin of sardines was safely
concealed, and we felt almost confident.
We were inspected very minutely and
asked seemingly ingenuous questions,
each doubtless with a subtle trap for
the unwary. I shivered when his
horse pawed the ground and unearthed
a bottle of Bass. I was also horrified
to perceive the faces of several particu-
larly grimy cook's mates continually
popping round the edge of the wood.
However, the inspection of the wagons
concluded without untoward incident,
and when the camp's turn came we
felt we were on safe ground. We had
that rare and comfortable feeling that
nothing had been forgotten. I saw
the Great Man start as his eye
encountered the spotless scene. Then
a look of grim determination was
apparent as he began his tour, his
glance, trained to an extraordinary
pitch of perception, seeking its wonted
prey. But no prey was forthcoming.
Up and down the lines he went,
peering into tents, digging at kits and
deputing members of his retinue to
test them for tooth-brushes. Exaspera-
tion gradually took the place of
determination on his countenance. As
he neared the end of his tour he was
swelling very visibly and muttering to
himself. We saw that some terrible
eruption was about to occur, and we
played our last card. At a sign from

me a stealthy figure emerged from
behind a bush, dropped a piece of
orange peel and disappeared again.
As the procession turned the last
corner a wild light broke upon the
face of the Central Figure. His step
quickened as he approached the orange
peel. He turned and cleared his throat.
“This piece of orange peel,” he began,
addressing our C.O., and rapidly de-
flating the while. The situation was
saved.

BEST SELLERS.
I HAVE seen many flag-days and met
many flag-sellers. Some were false
(they had flags with rusty pins and
jabbed them treacherously into my
best blouse), and many were frivolous
(that sort doesn't trouble about old-
maid customers); but of those who
were neither false nor frivolous Jack
and Jill stand easily first.
I saw them coming up the garden
path very early in the morning, Jack
in a sailor suit and Jill in a minute
whitefrock. Their combined ages might
have totalled nine — at a generous
guess. -
There was a furious ring at the door,
and when I opened it a small brown
hand was thrust in, full of flags, whose
pins must have been very prickly to
hold, while he of the sailor suit ad-
dressed me eagerly.
“Look! This sort's a penny. It's
paper. And this sort's thruppence.
It's real silk. Which 'll you have?”
The hand held two silk and four
paper flags. I took a silk one, and the
girl nodded approval. “I think,” said
she, “the silk ones will wear better.”
While I found my purse the boy had
a sudden idea, which he instantly com-
municated with the sincere intention
of doing the best he could for me.
Said he, “You’d better have the bofe.
You'll want one for your—for the
father.” And then he had a brighter
thought still. “And the childrens.
This paper kind would do for them.
It's no use buying good ones for them,

“No, they're sure to lose them,”
agreed Jill. “You see, they're rather
loose on their pins,” she added with
commercial candour.
“Else they wouldn't waggle pro-
perly," put in the boy hastily, in case
I might be thinking this a defect.

“I’ll take the lot,” said I, “if you
can tell me what it's all for.”
“You c'n see,” said Jack, “it’s on
the back of them,” and he poked one
round. “‘For Woun-ded He-roes,’ ” he
read out with pride and great delibera-
tion.
“He can't read very well,” said Jill,
who was a wee bit jealous. “It doesn't
mean dead. It only means wounded.”
But Jack smiled at me understand-
ingly, refusing to argue with anything
so small as Jill, and they departed,
counting the spoil.
At the gate Jack turned and came
back. “If you have more than four
children,” he said earnestly, “I could
bring you some more paper ones.”
I think they must have had a success-
ful day.

WAR RISKS OF AN UNCLE.
I HAVE been made a fool of by the
Government. No, you needn't all hold
up your hands at once. Mine was
different from yours. I have always
looked upon myself as an efficient uncle,
but now—well, one more incident of this
kind and I shall be definitely passé.
The technique of being an uncle I
mastered quite early. For instance, at
stated seasons in the year I choose with
some concentration two toys and two
improving books. The toys I give to
my nieces, Lillah and Phyllis; the
books I send to a hospital. In the same
spirit, when I take them for a treat
and they over-eat themselves, I simply
finance the operation and at the same
time buy a large bottle of castor oil
and send it anonymously to St. Bar-
tholomew's. You see the idea 2 It is
simply technique. I have explained
this system to Margaret, their mother.
But she is not one who sees reason
very easily.
In spite of opposition, however, I
continue to do my duty.
In this spirit I dashed into the nursery
the other day and declared my after-
noon and my finances at the service of
Lillah and Phyllis. Margaret definitely
forbade a cinema, from a curious notion
that their patrons consisted exclusively
of bacilli. So Lillah and Phyllis de-
clared at once for CHARLIE CHAPLIN or
nothing. This was only natural, so I
bought two tickets for the latest exhi-
| bition of War cartoons and sent them to
my Aunt Julia at Harpenden. Then I
took the children to the Pictures.
This is just to show you that I know
my job. But mark now how Fate
rushed me on to destruction. . -
“Uncle James,” said Lillah, “I love
you!”
I braced myself up.
“So do I,” said Phyllis.
It looked like trouble. : - - -
“Can we go and see the tin soldiers
before they go to bed 2" said Lillah. .
“The horseback ones,” added Phyllis.
Oh, this was too simple: a nice quiet
look at the guardians of Whitehall, with
perhaps a glimpse for the infant mind
of the vast resources of the British
Empire; a word in season, perhaps,
from Uncle James; and a detailed
report to Margaret of instruction com-
bined with amusement.
Of course we went.
“This,” I said, as Phyllis gazed
round-eyed at one of the motionless
warriors—“this is but a symbol of the
dignity of that great Empire upon
which the sun * >
“Soldiers,” said Phyllis with a wis-
dom beyond her years, “like girls to
look at them ever so long.”
Then she went away to Lillah, and I
saw them with their heads close to-
gether. A wonderful thing, the child-
mind. Only beginning perhaps, but
they were learning doubtless to think
imperially. The foundation of that
pride of race I broke the thread
of thought and looked up. Instantly I
was gibbering with horror.
Phyllis, standing on tiptoe and cling-
ing precariously to his saddle-cloth, was
dropping a roll of paper neatly into the
jackboot of Hercules.
“Phyllis' " I gasped.
you doing?”
She turned to me happily.
“That's what Nannie does,” she
said, without a blush for her sex. “I
put “I love you.-PHYLLIs.' Do you
think he'll be pleased ?”
I seized both girls and hurried into
the Park. My soul cried out for the
open spaces. I stole a look at Hercules
over my shoulder, but he was granite.
On Olympus the Olympians are
above shame.
“Phyllis,” I said gravely, “don't you
think that was very naughty of you?”
“No,” said that small Delilah firmly;
“soldiers like it.”
The even voice of Lillah broke in.
“And soldiers ought to have what
they like, oughtn't they 2”
“Certainly,” I answered patriotically.
“Well, then,” said Phyllis crushingly.
“If I had done that I should feel
very much ashamed of myself,” I said.
“Well, you didn't,” said Lillah, and
that finished it. . - - - - -
They evidently had an offensive and
defensive alliance against this sort of
thing. -
“If your mother,” I began.
“Sand! Sand!” shrieked Phyllis.
“Sand,” echoed Lillah, and both
children were gone. - -
They had just noticed the present
possibilities of the empty lake as a
substitute for Margate. Two best
frocks! Essentially a moment for
efficiency. - -
I stepped firmly across the railings.
And there the British Government
stepped in. I turned to regard a
policeman (out-size). - -
“May I call your attention to this,
Sir 2" he said. - - - -
I gazed at the notice like a fish :-
“ONLY CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED
ON THE BED OF THE LAKE...”
It is still there; you can go and see
it for yourself. I argued, I entreated.
Either the constable had a sense of
humour (and should be reported) or
else a perverted sense of duty.
A crowd collected. Out of the corner
of my eye I could see those two best
frocks.
“As usual,” I said bitterly but with
“What are
dignity, “the British Government is
too late.”
By the time I had persuaded the
children that tea was superior to sand
castles their clothes—but no, why re-
peat what Margaret said 2 I'm sure
she regretted it when I had gone.
But my reputation as an uncle of
any technical knowledge is finished.
I was so moved that I even forgot
my gift to St. Bartholomew's after tea
—and now I am writing a personal
letter to Mr. SAMUEL about that notice
in the Park.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If you only like listening to a talker with whom you
agree, who is of your type and school, then don't bother
with What is Coming 2 (CASSELL), which purports to
be H. G. WELLs's forecasts of things after the War. It's
perhaps hardly so serious as that, but just good speculative
talk, the kind that offers the first thing that is signalled to
the lips from a quick reflective brain without pauses to
consider objections by the way. Yet perhaps, after all, the
author cannot be dismissed too lightly as a prophet. He
did see further into the air than most, at the time when the
experts were blandly proving all sorts of impossibilities;
and, as he recalls, he made a lucky shot in foretelling the
immobility of trench warfare. He still believes in the
BLoch deadlock, and gives victory to the Allies merely for
better staying power. For British training and method he
naturally has nothing but scorn, which takes him further
than most of us can follow him. At least when he says
that the university-trained class has been found “under the
fiery test of war an evasive, temporising class of people,
individualistic, ungenerous and unable either to produce or
obey vigorous leadership,” he badly needs to justify the
confining of that diagnosis to that particular class. And
when he further says of British administration of subject
territories that “the British are a race coldly aloof. They
have nothing to give a black people and no disposition to
give"—well, it isn't an obvious truth. These are blemishes
of a kind to which a quick-thinking man, a little too anxious
to set everybody right by wholesale methods, is naturally
subject. But you will miss a good deal of fresh-air sanity,
of illumination (for the man can see and find the vivid
phrase to express his vision) on war and peace and education
and feminism and internationalism and citizenship, if you
let yourself be alienated by such lapses. So please don't.
“If only those old things could speak, what stories, etc.,
etc.' " Most of us, at one time or another, have endured
or inflicted that well-intentioned banality. And here is
Miss MARJoRIE BowFN, most skilful of historical romancers,
setting out to tell us precisely what stories. She calls her
volume Shadows of Yesterday (SMITH, ELDER), explaining
in a preface that is by no means the least attractive chapter
that they are supposed to be the histories attached to a
collection of antique oddments in a little Italian museum.
No one who remembers with what persuasive charm
Miss Bowen has handled her long costume novels will be
astonished at the atmosphere with which she manages to
invest these little episodes; a ring, a jewel, a CHARLES II.jug
—these are the materials out of which by aid of fancy she
recreates the past. Of the lot, I myself should give the
palm to the jug's story, a spirited little thing enough, in
which a country maid, awaiting in a cottage the coming of
a lover, whom she knows as “Lord Anthony,” meets
instead my Lady CASTLEMAINE, who tells her that the
defaulting swain is really His Majesty, and explains that
there exist (to put it tactfully) certain prior engagements
of the royal affection. The end is a brilliant comedy
stroke, which I will not spoil by anticipation for you. It
is this capacity for the unexpected that saves Miss BowFN
from the danger, obviously inherent in her plan, of being

too tightly bound down by the need of forcing her catalogue

nothing more agreeable.
..I could not, if I would, apply quite the customary
severities of criticism to Twilight (HUTCHINSoN). It is too
personal, and the death of its author, the clever woman
who elected to be known as FRANK DANBY, is too fresh in
memory for me to regard it with detachment. It is one of
the tragedies of literature that only in her last two books,
this and the one that preceded it, did the author give the
world a taste of her true quality. There is evidence in
Twilight of gifts that might well have raised its writer to
a place among the greatest. But frankly it is not possible
to consider it apart from the circumstances of its origin.
Two stories there are in it: one personal, autobiography at
its most intimate; the other a work of imagination. It is
supposed that the writer, a woman novelist, wrecked with

father, a cheap house-furnisher by trade, was a terribly
blighting person of peculiar religious views. By rod and
rote he tried to instil his narrow creed into his son, and
the latter's suffering during this process is revealed all the
more forcibly because it is not unduly insisted upon.
Though Raymond has his quiverful of virtues, one's
powers of belief in them, though taxed heavily enough, are
not super-taxed. It may seem curious that this young
man, whose vocation it was during some of the best years
of his life to handle and sell uninspiring things like lino-
leum, should have had artistic tastes; but as the reason for
this endowment is not given away until the very end of
the story I prefer not to give it away at all. In contrast

of which Raymond's parents were members, the Church of

HAMILTON writes as one having authority. He tells the
facts as he knows them—facts in many cases hitherto
undisclosed, and given here with adequate detail and just
enough of explanation to make the account clear even to the
most unmilitary reader. There has been no attempt by the
writer to embellish his theme. It remains a simple story
of sheer heroism, told in a straightforward soldierly manner
—and the reading of it must make the most unemotional
Briton feel the thrill of pride and pity and gratitude.
“Nothing,” says the writer, “can ever surpass, as a story
of simple sublime pluck, the history of the first three
months of England's participation in the Great War.” This
is what you can follow day by day in these pages. There
are many new maps in the present edition, which greatly
help to explain the situation, as it developed from Mons,
through the battle of the Marne, to the trenches before
Ypres. I can only say that I hope there will soon be few

snapshots of an artistic amateur, such as often convey a
far better impression of places and people than the more
ambitious products of expert science. Not all the pictures,
however, are from the writer's own camera. Two, which,
with a grim sense of drama, are placed next to each other,
represent the Coronation of King PETER of Serbia, and the
tragic ride of the Monarch from his invaded country. There
is a whole tremendous chapter of European history in the
contrasted pictures. Small wonder if books about the
Balkans should make “a wide appeal.”

hearsing it before a looking-glass. Whatever might have
happened, the speech would have been the same, even if we
had returned into harbour with only one ship—and there
was a time when I thought we should hardly be able to do
even that.

THE ONLY WAY.
Judkins was the last man in the world one would have
expected to meet in the fashionable costume of the day.
To begin with, he was well over age. And then he was on
the quiet side, usually looking for some odd, old thought
which had gone astray, and possessed of one of those
travelling mentalities which take note of all sides of a sub-
ject. Yet there he stood in khaki.
“The very last man in the world I expected to see like
this,” I said. It was quite true. Judkins was the sort
who would have attempted dreamy analyses with the drill-
instructor.
“Don’t blame me, old thing,” he said with a shade of
melancholy. “I know I am stiff and over age and all that,
but the recruiting fellow said he would willingly overlook
a decade. There was nothing else for it. It was the only
way.
“How do you mean, “the only way'?" I asked.
Judkins sighed. - -

truth ever since I was seven and told a lie, and felt that
I was lost. But I gave in at last. If Lord DERBY
looks at my papers he will think I am forty. So I am,
and a bit more. I meant to deceive his lordship, though
it went against the grain. I am sure I don't know what

done. I can picture him exclaiming, ‘Here's this man,
Private Judkins, declaring he is only forty, when to my

“I am risking all that because life became insupportable.
There was hardly anybody left I cared about. The one
waiter at my favourite restaurant who didn't breathe down
one's neck when he was holding the vegetables—he had
joined ; and the person who understood cigars at the corner
shop, he is in it too. The new man doesn't know the dif-
ference between a Murias and a Manilla. It was the same
all round. There was nobody to cut my hair. My barber
was forming fours. It is a wonder to me why the War
people have had to hunt the slippers, the chaps who have
held back, for there is very little to tempt one to keep out
of the crowd now. I've joined so as to be with the fellows
I know. Don't go and put it all down to patriotism; it
was just sheer loneliness. The man who sold me my even-
ing paper—you remember him 2 he had a squint and used
to invest in Spanish lotteries and get me to translate the
letters he received—he is a soldier now ; and so is the
bootblack who asked for tips for the races, and the door-
keeper at the offices. They're all wearing khaki, all in ; and
it wasn't the same world without them, only a dreary
make-believe, and so I decided to deceive the War Office
and join my friends. Every day I am finding the folk I'd
lost. The Corporal with whom I do most business was
checktaker at a theatre I used to frequent—always told
me whether the show was worth the money before I parted.

MY DEAR CHARLEs, No “Tourists'
Guide to Northern France” would be
complete without some mention of the
picturesque town of A., a point at
which even the most progressive trav-
eller is likely to say that he's had a
very pleasant journey so far, but now
thinks of turning back. It boasts a
small but exceedingly well-ventilated
cathedral, many an eligible residence to
let, and the relics of what was once a
busy factory, on the few remaining bricks
of which you are particularly requested
to “afficher” no “affiches.” It is ap-
proached by a railway, prettily over-
grown with tall grasses and -
wild - flowers, and never T.
made hideous these days by
the presence of hustling,
smoky trains. Entering
daintily from the back, the
tourist will soon find him-
self in its main street, devoid
of ladies out shopping, but
not without its curious col-
lection of exuberant drain- ||
pipes and recumbent lamp- ||
posts. It lies, pleasantly |
dishevelled, in the sun,
having the appearance of
the bed of a restless sleeper
who has shifted about some-
what in the night and made ||
many abortive efforts to
get up in the morning. Its
streets are decorated with a
series of dew ponds, dotted
about with no apparent re-
the less actively quarrelsome life, they
nevertheless preſer to live in this sort
of place. When a man gets to their
age he has apparently grown too fond
of his old friends, the shells, to be
parted from them altogether till he ab-
solutely must ; also he likes a row of
houses to himself to live in. A street
cannot be so quickly demolished as to
give him no time to select another one,
and business can always be carried on
at the one end while structural alter-
ations are taking place at the other.
This fluctuation of town property is a
thing to be reckoned with in his life; and

of billets occupied by units, and where

True, it was a standing door at the

a passage which had ceased to exist. But

tried to comfort her, being limited to
the methods of personal magnetism, in
the absence of his interpreter and the
scarcity of his French. She refused to
take comfort; it was not sorrow for

atrocious living which moved her. She
was mortally afraid, she to whom
salvoes of big guns were now matters
of passing inconvenience. The English
Navy had taken a knock; the War was
therefore over and we had lost. There
was no hope for any of us, and any

DEAR Betty, in the good old days,
Before this Armageddon stunt,

Ensconced within a cushioned punt;

I felt the toils around me closing,
Until one starry moonlit night,
Discreetly veiled from vulgar sight,
I found myself proposing.
You heard my ravings with a smile,
And then confessed you liked my
cheek,
But thought my nose denoted guile
And feared my chin was rather weak;
My character with fiendish glee
You treated to a grim dissection,
Then as a final jeu d'esprit
You cynically offered me
A sisterly affection.
But now within my faithful heart
New hope has sprung to sudden life;
In fancy (somewhat à la carte)
I see you more or less my wife;
The way is found, the path is clear,
The resolution moved and carried—
If you have pluck enough, my dear,
To risk a rather new career . . .
We might be slightly married.*

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I cordially wel-

I readily acknowledge its importance,

helpful. Hence, to make a beginning,
I venture to submit the following speci-

Dining-room Rhymes. Should they
meet with approval I propose to deal
with other apartments in the same
spirit, excepting perhaps the Box-room,
which does not seem to me to offer
facilities for lyrical treatment.

ARCHIBILL.
His name was, so to speak, the fine
flower of Delia's imagination, and of
mine. Mrs. Mutimer-Sympson gave
him to Delia as a war-time birthday-
present, and he was at once acclaimed
as “fascinating,” which he may have
been, and “lovely,” which he certainly
His usual abiding-place was
the kitchen, in comfortable proximity to
the range, which he shared with one of
his kind or of a lower order; but there
were occasions when he honoured the
dining-room with a visit.
“Though he mustn't come in when
we've callers,” said Delia: this was in
the early days, when his title and
status were as yet nebulous.
“But why not ?” I protested.
“William's all right, so long as he's
reasonably clean.”
Delia raised her eyebrows d la fran-
Cause.
“William 2 ''
“William,” I repeated firmly. “What
else would you call him 2"
“I should have thought,” said Delia
coldly, “that it would have been plain,
even to the meanest intelligence, that
he was Archibald.”
“On the contrary,” I retorted, “no
sentient being can gaze upon him with-
out recognizing him as William.”
At this moment the treasure in
question, who had been making con-
tented little purring noises near the
fire, was apparently startled by a falling
coal, for he raised his voice in a high
note of appeal.
“Did a nasty man call him out of
his name, then ' " said Delia, snatching
him up.
“If you're not careful,” I reminded
her, “William will ruin your new
blouse.”
“Of course,” said Delia, with an air
of trying to be reasonable with an
utterly unreasonable person, “there 'd
be no objection to his having a second
nanne.
“None whatever.
bald 'goes quite well.”
“‘Archibald William goes better.
And it's going to be that, or just plain
‘Archibald.’” Delia added defiantly
that she wasn't going to argue, be-
cause she wanted her tea, and so did he.
‘William Archi-
For the next three days we refrained
from argument accordingly, sometimes
calling him one name, sometimes
another. The thing ended, perhaps
inevitably, in a compromise. He be-
came “Archibill.”
It was curious how the charms of
Archibill grew upon us—how his per-
sonality developed under Delia's care.
She insisted that he recognized her
step, and that the piercingly shrill cry
he gave was for her ear alone. Perhaps
it was so—women have more subtle
powers of perception than men. There
was real pathos in their first parting,
which came when an inconsiderate
grand - aunt in Scotland, knowing
nothing of Archibill's claims, made
Delia promise to pay her a ten-days'
visit.
“You mustn't mind Missis being
away, old boy,” Delia told him, “be-
cause she'll be coming back soon.
And, although Master's going to stay
with his sister, you won't be lonely.
There's a nice kind charlady who'll
look in every day to make sure that you
haven't been stolen by horrid tramps,
and that the silver spoons are safe."
Yet, from what she has told me since,
I know that her spirits were heavy with
foreboding when she left by the 11.23
from Euston.
We returned, later than we expected,
together. The nice kind charlady had
done her work for the day, and left, but
a fire burned cheerfully in the dining-
room and the table was laid for tea.
“And where,” demanded Delia, “is
Archibill?”
|
Even as she spoke she sped into the
kitchen. A moment later I heard a
cry, and followed.
“Look!” said Delia.
He lay near the range, a wrecked and
worn-out shadow of his former self, in-
capable of even a sigh. Tenderly she
lifted him.
“It's just neglect,” she said. “Why
did I leave him Something always
happens when one leaves such treasures
as Archibill.”
“It mayn't be too late to do some-
thing,” I said; “I’ll run down with
him to Gramshaw's after tea.”
“After tea!" echoed Delia reproach-
fully. I went at once.
A fortnight has passed since then.
Once more Archibill makes cheerful
murmuring noises on the hearth. He
looks, I fancy, older; otherwise there
is little change to record.
Yesterday morning I received Gram-
shaw's bill: “To putting new Bottom
to patent Whistling Kettle, and repair-
ing Spout—£0 2s. 9d.”
Delia says it's worth twenty two-
and-ninepences to listen to Archibill
calling her when he boils.

THE FAR-REACHING EFFECT OF THE RUSSIAN PUSH.
CONSOLATIONS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-In order to guard
against the snares of a too facile op-
timism I have made a point ever since
the War began of taking all my infor-
mation solely from German sources, as
I have a feeling somehow that they
may be confidently relied upon not to
err upon the side of underrating their
own success. But, having started with
this handicap, I consider that I am the
more justified in looking upon the bright
side of things whenever possible. I
am writing to you to-day to point out
a very important aspect of the many
recent German victories which seems
to have been overlooked. It is full of
promise of an early termination of the
War.
I wish to analyse the ingredients of
the German Celebration Days, which
have followed each other with such
bewildering rapidity of late. As far as
I can gather, the whole nation has
turned out to celebrate the fall 3.
Verdun (in the first week of March),
which was the key to Paris; the ad-
vance in the Trentino, which was the
key to Rome; and the destruction of
the British Fleet, which was the key
to London, along with the going out of
the electric spark of the British nimbus
and all that. Meanwhile certain cities
and districts—the thing seems to move
round from one to another—have cele-
brated in force the various times that
the Mort Homme was captured (while
it was still held by the French), the
great diplomatic victory over America,
the success of the last War Loan and
countless other triumphs.
has been going on ever since the sink-
ing of the Tiger eighteen months ago.
Now, Sir, there are five main ingre-
dients in these celebrations—flags, the
ringing of bells, the distribution of iron
crosses, fireworks, and school holidays.
The efficient organisation of civilian
morale demands them all. Let us look
into these.
First, let us take the widest view and
look forward to the contest for supre-

told us so. Yet the very magnitude of
their present successes is robbing their
chief weapon of its edge. It is not too
much to say that, should the summer
campaign follow the lines expected of

education will come to a standstill

holidays. Already parents are com-
plaining that their children think it
hardly worth while to turn up at school
until they have had a look at the paper
to see if there is anything much going
on, and patriotic truants are always
able to point to the capture of a battery
or the sinking of a ship as justification
for taking the day off. Should the
War be prolonged we have to face the
fact that we may have to do with a
Germany in which the rising generation
can neither read nor write.
But in a far more immediate sense
the great number of German victories
is sapping the very sources of German
power. I ask you, first of all, what are
these flags made of 2 They are made
of cotton; and more than that, they are
rapidly wearing out. Much flapping in
all weathers—victories have too often
been allowed to occur in bad weather
—has torn them to ribbons. The situa-
tion is serious: reserves are exhausted,
and an attempt to introduce flag-cards
has met with no support.
Then let us consider fireworks. Is
it not clear that the supply cannot be
maintained without a steady munition-
ment of high explosives, more especially
in the case of rockets?
I need not labour the fact, which

is sufficiently ominous, that iron crosses
are made of iron, but I may point out
that this expenditure cannot be made
good by drawing upon the belfries, as
the necessity for periodical bell-ringing
has immobilized the bells.
These facts should be more widely

comfort. Even the deplorable loss of

A SOLUTION.
AMONG the many Government changes
that are imminent it is to be hoped that
the PRIME MINISTER will appoint some-
one to an office of the highest import-
ance for the well-being of the Cabinet
in the public eye. Far too long has
the man-in-the-street been encouraged
in an attitude of scorn for the efforts
of the Twenty-three. It is not sug-
gested that the new official shall be
added to that mystic number and bring
it up to twice-times-twelve, or four-
times-six, or even three-times-eight.
There is no need for him to have Cabinet
rank, but he must be permitted some
inside knowledge or his labours will
not be fully fruitful. Only by such
labours can the Twenty-three really
expect a fair reputation. As it is, every-
one is more or less suspicious of them,
led by the papers in their self-imposed
sacred task of leaders or leader-writers
of the Opposition; while the music-
halls are of course frankly against
in which Mr. Asquith is still taunted
with his inability to come to a decision
about conscription. The fact that the
conscription problem was long since
settled is immaterial to these loud-
lunged patriots. Any stick is good for
such a dog. True there has of late been
rather less venom in certain of the anti-
Premier papers, which now substitute
for their ancient scoldings a bland
omniscience and kindliness in their
reminders of the obvious, but none the
less contrive still to insert the knife
and even to give it a furtive twist.
The fact then remains that what the
Government need is a friend, a trum-
peter, a fugle - man, a pointer-out of
merits, a signaller of This-way-to-the-
virtues—in short, a Callisthenes. They
should take a lesson from the self-
sacrificing zeal of that other Callis-
thenes who serves a certain London
emporium so faithfully, awaking every
morning to a new and rapturous vision
of its excellence, which nothing can
stop the discoverer at once putting
any but a purely Tory Government, as into words for the evening papers.

Such trouvailles must not be kept

complacent in printing these rhap-
sodies, which, truth to tell, are some-
times very like each other, no one
knows; but there it is. They see the
light, and everyone rejoices to think
that in a country which has been a
good deal blown upon there is, at any
rate, one perfect thing.

ready to print the present-day eulogies

One can see the new Callisthenes in-

sible, be modelled on the old—it might |
even be (daring thought !) the same:—

become, in time, almost automatic,
thought need never lose its volition.
And it is one's thought or attitude of
mind that counts.
The service at the Firm of Asquith
& Co., is, I think, so good because
Ministers are encouraged tremend-
ously to give their work the personal
touch. They are not afraid to give
their individuality full rein, to let it
inform their particular jobs, so that
each one is enlivened thereby.
If you knew the Cabinet as well as
I do, you would appreciate the fact
that it is remarkable for the number
of distinct personalities among its
members—men of marked character
and distinction, who are known not
only throughout the House, but to a
great many members of the London
Public as well.
They stand out among their fellow-
workers because their service is dis-
tinguished. It is not necessarily that
their abilities are so especially su-
perior, excellent though they may be.
It is that all they do is infused with
character. Their voices have timbre;
they don't drawl. Their manners are
good. They carry out the smallest
transaction as though it held infinite
interest for themselves as well as you.
They never for a moment allow their
intelligence to sag. They give to
their least varying work that personal
touch which is so transforming.
The Firm of Asquith thoroughly
appreciates their worth, and openly
rejoices in the prestige these star
workers attach to themselves. It
would have every member of the
Staff do likewise—act not merely as
a minister, but as a very definite and
valued personality.
For that is service as it should be
in a modern Government, as spon-
taneous to-day as it was servile yes-
terday—intelligent, forceful and gay.
Example is the greatest factor in
its fine development. The Cabinet
Minister, however young, who can
answer every query with a pretty
deference, put off an Irish Member
with good effect, who in checking
your ill-advised inquisitiveness seems
to welcome you—such a one receives
as much and more, every time, as he
gives. He gets smiles, thanks, even
deference in return, and very often
friendship. His companions notice
that. They see how his buoyancy
never flags, because it is all the while
met with response, stimulated, liked.
And the habit of success is very
catching. Voilà tout !

This attempt to shove Alexandra Day

to say, been unsuccessful; and to-day,

way as usual. - *

The Scratch Pack (HUTCHINson) is another of those
jovial, out-door stories, for which Miss Dorothea CoNYERs
has already endeared herself to a considerable public. As
before, her scene is Ireland. It is somewhere on the south
coast of that emotional island that a maiden called Gheena
Freyne determines, in the war-absence of the local M.F.H.,
to do her bit by dealing faithfully with the foxes, who are
rather above themselves through neglect. So she, and one
Darby Dillon, who is crippled and unable to do anything but
ride (and adore Gheema), get together a very scratch pack
of the farmers' foot-dogs. What sport results, and how
buoyantly it is told, those with experience of Miss CoNYERs'
vigorous gifts can easily imagine. There is however another
thread to the story. A second suitor pervades the scene,
one Basil Stafford, who, though hale and vigorous, persists,
even under white-feather provocation, in an attitude of

enough perhaps to save us
from abject shame when,

As viewed by FRANz Jose F, Junior Partner.
I HATE the horrid roller used by our offensive foe,
Which goes so very much more fast than most steam-

Just now it's got us in a hole particularly tight,
But HINDENBURG, brave HINDENBURG, is sure to put us

Some time ago it snorted up Carpathia's rugged steeps,
It tooted through Przemysl Town and Cracow had the

Our stout Ally's behaviour may contain a touch of swank,
But, when we leave a vacuum upon his dexter flank,
Although with simulated grief he'd chuck us if he could,

good.

painful spot,
And HINDENBURG, old HINDENBURG, is sent to stop the
rot. O. S
whAT THE PREssMEN SAw.
(By our NAVAL ExPERT).
I HAVE passed a week rich in experiences. The things
I've seen As one of a party of journalists accorded the
privilege of a visit to the Trawler Fleet I am able to-day
at last to lift the curtain and tell the public what is going
on. It is true that there are some restrictions as to what
may be published, but I think you will find that I am free
to relate the best bits.
The Trawler Fleet ! The Trawler Fleet is a power of
great and diverse capabilities. But my visit was paid not
so much to estimate its fighting value as to plumb its
spiritual depths (which are not so likely to be interfered
with by the Censor). The very heart of British sea power,
the epitome of modern naval war, is to be found in a little
port somewhere on the Coast. Here cluster just
ordinary little one-funnelled trawlers, grimy little every-day
vessels. These are the real thing. They come and go,
these trawlers, in and out, back and forth, up and down,
round and round; but they are being wrought into the
weſt and woof of history, every one of them.
I contemplated them. On one I found an old tar cleaning
his shore-going boots. We entered into conversation, the
ice being broken by a friendly query of his as to whether
the adoption of Summer Time had affected the prohibited
hours. And I–with intention—asked him if he had been
fishing.
“Fishing?” said he, and he looked at me and winked.
There was heroism in his wink with a dash of humour, as
is the way with men of our race.
On another I found a mere boy. His job, I gathered,
was to help the cook and wash up. “The War,” he
considered, “’adn't made no sort o' difference to 'im. His
job went on much the same.”
Well, I took off my hat to him—I couldn't resist it.
Never have I been more thrilled at the thought of the
indomitable spirit of our race. No difference 1
I questioned him further, but he evinced all the
admirable and impenetrable reticence of the Service in
war-time.
Deeply moved by these experiences I next accosted a
brawny stoker covered with the grime of his calling. “The
life seems to suit you all right,” I cried, and slapped him on
the back. The result was noteworthy. He made absolutely
no reply of any sort but spat over the side.
And finally I must tell the story of the trawler and the
mine. We all heard it, and most of the best people are
telling it. It reveals better than anything perhaps the
spiritual depths. It was related by an officer who had
taken charge of our party and who actually showed us
a photograph of the mine in question in a little museum of
relics he had established on the quay, which contained
also a part of a chronometer, said to be German, and a loaf
of potato bread, captured and brought home under con-
ditions that will make a stirring story after the War. The
mine had been towed in by a fisherman who had flung a
rope round its horns. “Cool hand, that fisherman,” the
narrator concluded. (It is only fair to say that in some
versions given to the public the expression is set down
as “Offhand chap" or “Careless old card,” but I believe
these to be incorrect.) “He said it must be safe enough
for he had towed it for fourteen miles.” (There has been
some little discrepancy as to the mileage also, one sen-
sational writer in the Yellow Press even putting it as high
as nineteen.)
A wonderful week!. It is folly to draw great conclusions
from a hasty visit. All the same this is my considered
message to the British Public—Trust the Trawlers.

the eight months that this solitary
and silent man had been in Flanders
he had not received so much as a

him a letter:—

night Grimes was again working on

Grimes by a jerk of the head. “Dear

Three weeks later he went home on

object, more moral than humane, and
more histrionic than either, was to
confound the wretched woman, to ex-
pose her identity and so, by a sudden
disillusionment, to restore her lamb to
the fold. The end, as it turned out for
the general good, did actually seem to
justify the means; but at the time it
was not a very edifying exhibition.
“One likes to show the truth for the truth;
That the woman was light is very true;
But suppose she says, Never mind that
youth !
What wrong have I done to you?”
“Well, anyhow” (as BRowNING also
said) it was an effective piece of stage-
work, and the result tallied with the
best conventions by which youth is re-
claimed from the snares of a baffled and
repentant vampire.
The staginess of things infected or
seemed to infect even Miss IRENE
WANBRUgh. In the first Act I found
her a little spasmodic. And all through
the play the authors were most arbi-
trary about the way in which they
made her meet the various attacks that
were sprung upon her. Thus, at a
small shock, she would suddenly start
and drop something; but when you ex-
pected her at least to swoon on finding
that her true name had been discovered,
she bore the blow with superb aplomb.
And after enduring the K.C.’s inter-
minable recitation with only here and
there a sign of personal interest, she
finally gave herself away in a loud and
voluble protest against the idea that
any woman purposing to administer
poison to her husband could have been
callous enough to try it first on a
favourite dog.
There was inconsistency too in the
pace at which the performance was
conducted. All obvious things were
taken quite leisurely; but the speed at
which really difficult and complex details
were rushed was simply torrential.
Miss IRENE WANBRUGH had her own
reputation to compete with in the kind
of part in which we know her so well,
and to say that she was equal to it is
praise enough. She was best, per-
haps, because most womanly and least
wolfish, in the scene of her confession.
As for Mr. DION Boucic AULT I would
not go so far as to say that his manner
deceived me into supposing that he was
a real K.C.. I have mixed with many
real K.C.’s on the parade-ground or in
the trenches (home defence), but even
in the disguise of a uniform, and under
conditions that might tend to obscure
the outward signs of legal distinction,
I have always observed a certain man-
ner which betrayed their high calling.
That manner was not very saliently
marked in Mr. Dion BoucICAULT. But
he had an exceptional chance as an
actor and grasped it firmly.
The part of Mr. Ifigg, blackmailer,
the mystery of whose personality,
aggravated by a penchant for “hover-
ing” with intent, constituted a darker
“Riddle" than that of “Mrs. Lytton,”
was played by Mr. Oswald MARSHALL
with admirable ease and reserve; and
Mr. STANLEY DREwiTT's Professor Bev-
eridge, an antique lamb who confided
to the wolf his views on “discontinuous
variations,” and by way of reprisal was
touched by her for a couple of ten-
pound notes, had a pleasant air of
naïve sincerity. The others were

IT IS WHISPERED THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SARTORIAL PRESS IS TRYING TO INDUCE THE SPEARER TO REcoSSIDER HIS
sTATEMENT THAT HE (THE SPEAKER) “HAs NoTHING To Do witH THE cloth Es THAT MEMBERs choose to we AR.” -
Tuesday, June 20th-Once again the
House of Lords has forestalled the
Commons by its elastic procedure.
During the brief recess the Empire has
been stirred to its depths by the tragic
death of Lord KITCHENER. Almost his
last official act was to meet his critics
of the House of Commons face to face,
reply to their questions, and leave them
silenced and admiring. Yet to-day the
Commons could do no more than listen
to the sympathetic messages from
foreign Parliaments read out to them
by the SPEAKER, and learn from the
PRIME MINISTER that to-morrow he
would endeavour to give expression to
their feelings upon this “irreparable
loss.” The Lords, less fettered by for-
mality, were able at once to pay their
tribute to the great dead and to hear
his praises sounded by a Statesman, a
Soldier and a Friend. -
The SPEAKER is no ALEXANDER seek-
ing fresh worlds to conquer. Invited
to rebuke an Irish Member for wear-
ing a Sinn Fein badge he flatly de-
clined, with the remark that he had
nothing to do with the clothes Mem-
bers chose to wear. In refusing to set
up as an arbiter elegantiarum I think
Mr. LowTHER is wise, for the post in
these days would be no sinecure. Time
was when the House was the best-spicuous humanity which he displayed

Lough thought he would try to get rid
of the tax on sugar. But here Mr.
McKENNA was obdurate. We used far
more sugar than any other European
nation, and must be forced to reduce
our consumption. Someone, remem-
bering, perhaps, how a month ago Mr.
McKENNA had smiled approval while
his colleague, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, de-
fended Prohibition against Tariffs as a
means of lessening consumption, sug-
gested that sugar-consumers should be
rationed instead of being taxed. But
Mr. McKENNA, without turning a hair,
maintained that in war-time to raise
the price by taxation was the only way.
Political economy, once relegated by
Mr. GLADSTONE to Jupiter and Saturn,
is now, it seems, a permanent dweller
in Mars.
Thursday, June 22nd.—The House
of Lords welcomed a notable recruit in
the person of Lord CHAPLIN. To his
many remarkable performances in the
field and the forum the newcomer has
added another by gaining a step in the
peerage before taking his seat. Last
April it was announced that the KING
had been pleased to confer upon him a
barony, but it was Wiscount CHAPLIN,
of St. Oswald's, Blankney, who sub-
scribed the roll this afternoon.
Out of 173 questions on the Paper of
the House of Commons a large number
related to Ireland; but Ministers were
extremely economical of information.
The anticipated settlement still hangs
fire, and there are increasing fears that
it will not hold water. Almost the only
fact revealed was that Lord WIMBORNE
is no longer Lord Lieutenant of Ire-
| land. His resignation has been definitely
accepted. By Ireland, where he was
by no means an unwelcome GUEST, he
will be more regretted than some other
Viceroys.
The extra income - tax on American
securities again led to some lively ex-
changes. Sir FREDERICK BANBURY
found himself in the unwonted com-
pany of Mr. D. M. MAsoN in resisting
the Government proposals. These “Old
|Tories” were told by Mr. G. FABER
that the world was upside down, and
that the sooner they realised it the
better. But even he thought the Gov-
ernment were using up these dollar
| securities rather fast. They ought to
treat them as “pearls of great price "
and not cast them away for American
bacon.
Mr. McKENNA was not at all in a
conciliatory mood, and startled some of
his opponents by reminding them that
under the Defence of the Realm Act
the Government could take any kind
of property at prices far below the
market value. When other men had
given up their lives for their country
why all this boggling over shares?—
an argument that the House as usual
found unanswerable. -
“At Colmar a merchant has been sentenced
to a fine of £5 by a German court-martial
for repeating in a public restaurant the well-
known joke about ordering a sandwich at a

Anyhow, he deserved his punishment
for spoiling the only Teuton joke.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks)
I AM a little puzzled as to the authorship of Action Front
(SMITH, ELDER), which is stated to be written by Boyd
CABLE, author of Between the Lines. First of all there was
a Mr. Boyd CABLE, but he didn't last, for he soon turned
into “Boyd CABLE" without the Mr., the inverted commas
indicating, I suppose, that this was a mere nom de guerre.
At or about the same time there was an author known as
“Action FRONT,” whose writings were hardly to be dis-
tinguished from those of “Boyd CABLE.” And now Action
Front becomes the title of a book by Boyd CABLE. For
my own part I can only say that, whoever he may be,
Boyd CABLE–let us try him without the inverts—has a
most remarkable gift for the writing of vivid and exciting
war-stories. He takes a phrase from the communiqués and
shows you with a seemingly careless art, of which he holds
the secret, what moving incidents, what heroism, what
self-sacrifice and glorious endurance are concealed behind
the bald official announce- TT
ment. Moreover, he has a
true appreciation of the
reckless and humorous
courage that characterises
the British fighting man,
the splendid human ma-
terial out of which great
events are fashioned. If
you add to these high
qualities a talent for mak-
ing you visualise the
scenes and the sequence
of incidents which he
describes you will obtain
teresting writer. He holds
you in his grip from the
moment he starts, and
there is no relaxation from
then to the finish. Each
| little story is an admirable
piece of literary architec-
-zº-ºº:

And he has made an interesting book of it, intelligently
packed with admirable photographs. He still keeps to his
fine theme, the interpretation of Russia and the plea for
friendliness, trust and a large co-operation with her on our
part over the problems of peace and power. Among such
problems he drifts about with a disarming naïveté, a little
out of depth and more than a little sagacious. An excellent
specimen of the converted Radical-Imperialist.
There used, I believe, to be an old controversy as to how
many angels could dance on the point of a needle. Somehow,
this antique problem is always brought to my mind by the
short stories of Mr. BARRY PAIN, perhaps because he seems
to have the power of marshalling more angels of pity and
fear and laughter in the restricted area of a few printed
pages than almost any other writer. How true this is you
have now a fine opportunity of judging, since the first volume
of his Collected Tales (SECKER) contains a baker's dozen of
samples selected by himself. Of these the most consider-
able (in point of length) is “Wilmay,” which might
almost be considered a
very short novel. It is
also to my mind the
weakest thing in the
|j not even Mr.
BARRY PAIN can impart
much freshness to the
middle-aged guardian who
remains, till the final
chapter, blind to the
obvious devotion of his
attractive ward. Else-
where, by way of com-
pensation, we have sev-
eral little studies of rare
quality: “Ellen Rider,”
exquisite in its restraint
and genuine feeling; “The
Undying Thing,” that
small masterpiece of the
unpleasant, and “The
Night of Glory,” a savage
and utterly merciless piece

ture. If I had to class them I should place “Drill” and
“The Signallers ” by themselves in the first division of the
first class.” I will hint only one fault: it is too great a tax
on one's credulity to be asked to believe that a French
officer could have addressed an English private as mon
beau Anglaise. Otherwise I have nothing but praise for
Action Front, though I am still as far as ever from knowing
who wrote it.
I feel I am beginning to know something of romantic
Russia and the Russians from the perpetual and jolly spate
of Mr. STEPHEN GRAHAM's books. Through Russian Central
Asia (CAssell) is the very latest to hand. I like his easy
pace, his gentle universal friendliness, his fearlessness, his
untidy but interesting mind. He is a tramp of tramps.
| With a thin wallet of notes and no weapon but a fountain-
pen he travels a couple of thousand miles or so and back,
faring on his own feet, steaming down stretches of navigable
river, taking the rail for a space, begging a liſt in some pre:
historic conveyance, right from the Caspian, by magical

added itself to the collection. Anyhow, I am glad it
eluded him, as it is one of the happiest things in a most
attractive volume.
Miss MARGUERITE BRYANT, the author of Felicity Crofton
(HEINEMANN), can thank the gods for two gifts which lift any
novel of hers well above the ruck of fiction. One is a sense
of style (let me beg her not to play careless pranks with it);
the other such a knowledge of men as is vouchsafed to
very few contemporary women-novelists. You will have
to go far and get very tired before you find a more lovable
heroine than Felicity. Even after you have begun to
suspect that the bearing of her own and other people's
burdens had grown to be a hobby with her, you never
lose faith in her delightfully vivid and radiant personality.
The danger of drawing so fascinating a character is that
when she is off the stage one's attention is apt to wander
to the wings; but Miss BRYANT, though she cannot quite
defeat this peril, has not been overwhelmed by it. With
one exception the minor parts in her story are excellently
handled, and in the end I have to be grateful for more

WOMEN IN WAR-TIME.
WHEREVER he has wandered of late, Mr. Punch has been struck by the sight of a new and capable type of
citizen, always in some responsible position and always alert and efficient.
He has found her, in various incarnations, everywhere. If he goes by the railway she sells him his ticket.
When he passes through the gate she clips his ticket. When he leaves the station she collects his ticket.
When he goes by Tube she takes him down in the lift and up in it again. If he boards a tram or an
omnibus it is she, this new citizen, in a trim businesslike uniform, who collects his fare.
|
At his club she brings him his lunch. At many a restaurant she handles plates once sacred to Fritz and Karl.
He has seen her collecting letters from the pillar-boxes and manfully shouldering the sack.
When he shops she opens his cab door and receives him, and if it is wet she holds an umbrella over him.
In countless Banks and Offices she does the work of clerks, released for the army. -
Often he sees her driving a motor-car; often a waggon; often a motor-tricycle delivering goods. In smart
leggings, tunic and cap she runs errands.
Qn flag-days (and they occur now and then) she collects money in the streets hour after hour, no matter
how cold or tired she is. At charity matinées (and they, too, have been known to happen) she extracts vast
sums of money from the audience for programmes and souvenirs. She sits on a thousand committees connected
with War charities and alleviations.
At the canteens, which never shut, day or night, she serves soldiers with hot drinks, cheerfully welcoming
them back to old England, or speeding them with equal cheer on their way to the War, Dressed in khaki, she
meets soldiers home on leave, leading them to comfortable shelters. Never does she look so masterful as then,
for she marches at their head like a real commander.
In Regent's Park you may see her guiding blind soldiers, and on Hampstead Heath Mr. Punch has found
her pulling or pushing crippled soldiers in bath-chairs. Elsewhere she reads to them and writes their letters
for them, thus helping to beguile the long inactive hours.
In the hospital depôts she makes swabs and bandages by the million, quilts pneumonia jackets, pads the
tops of crutches and sandpapers splints.

She has hardened her soft hands, through all weathers and seasons, in the labour of farm and field;
grooming horses, tending cattle, guiding the plough, gathering the harvest.
And all over the country she is continually busy making munitions. -
As for the myriad nurses in the hospitals here and abroad, who guard the precarious flame of life and
dress wounds and cheer the sick—they do nothing new. . That has always been woman's mission. But
of course there are countless more nurses than there were two years ago, before the cataclysm.
Wherever he sees one of the new citizens; or whenever he hears fresh stories of their address and ability,
Mr. Punch is proud and delighted. “It's almost worth having a war,” he will say, “to prove what stuff our
women are made of." But, always the most chivalrous of men, “Not that it wanted proof,” he will add.
And then, the other day, finding several representatives of the new citizenship resting in their luncheon hour,
Mr. Punch, taking all his courage into his venerable hands, ventured to chat a little with them (for of course he
would not dare to interrupt them when they were at work), in order to find out how they would be now filling
their time were there none of these novel and pressing War duties.
But the remarkable thing is that none of them quite knew. They could not remember. All they were
certain of amid the haze was the very distinct conviction that, whatever it was, they would not then have been
so happy as they now were. - •
“Well, my dears,” said Mr. Punch, laughing, “never mind about what you might have been doing. The
important thing is what you are doing, and when I think of that it makes my eyes glisten, I am so proud of
you. Perhaps now and then in the past I may have been a little chaffing about some of your foibles, and even
about some of your aspirations; but I never doubted how splendid you were at heart; I never for a moment
supposed you would be anything but ready and keen when the hour of need struck. And I was right, bless
your spirited hearts! I was right. For here you are, filling the men's places, so that they can be the more free
to go and fight for us, and doing it all smilingly and cleverly as though you'd never, done anything else. I
think it's magnificent. I'm an old man and I've seen a great many things in my time, but I've never seen
anything better or anything that gave me more pleasure.” - . . ;- - ..
“Oh, no, Mr. Punch," said one of the new citizens—rather a pretty one, too—“you're not really old."
“No! no!" cried the others. . . .” º º
“You're very kind and sweet,” said Mr. Punch, “but you're wrong. I am old, very old—in fact just
three quarters of a century old; and in proof of that let me hand you my
One jumbrº and fiftieth tolume."
