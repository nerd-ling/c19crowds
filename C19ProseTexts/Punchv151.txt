HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(Professor BRUMMBERGER and his daughter AMALIE.)
The Professor. Where is your mother?
Amalie. She has gone out with her bread-ticket and her
meat-ticket and her butter-ticket, so that there may be
something to eat in the house. There is always a great
crowd waiting, and one has often to fight for a good place.
The Professor. Well, let us hope your mother will prove
herself a good true-German fighter.
Amalie. Oh, yes, she will do what is necessary better
than most others; but, as for me, I cannot understand
why it is allowed that such things should be necessary.
What is the All-Highest doing with all these victories if
mamma has to stand like this for hours in the cold and
rain 2 - -
The Professor. Hush, Amalie. You must not speak of
the KAISER in that irresponsible way. If somebody should
hear you, what do you think would happen to us?
Amalie. I do not care. Sometimes one must say what
is in one's mind. I am tired of all this shouting about
victories that never come to anything. What is the use of
victories that never seem to win for us what we want?
The Professor. Silence, Amalie. -
Amalie. Well, I have said what I wanted to say and I
can now leave it alone. Only I know that the words of
the KAISER have brought us nothing so far but bitter dis-
appointments. Why does he keep on making speeches?
If I am to be silent why should he not set me an example?
The Professor. Once for all, will you obey me and hold
your tongue? .
Amalie. Yes, Papa. I have already said that I would
say no more. But it is too hard to have matters going on
like this for months and months, with thousands and
thousands of our soldiers killed and wounded every day,
and peace no nearer than it was at the beginning. The
KAISER and the generals ought to have known better.
That I will affirm, whatever may happen. You yourself,
Papa, told us, two years ago, that the War would be short,
that the enemy-nations would be defeated because, being
degenerate, they could not withstand for more than a few
weeks the hero-attacks of our brave soldiers, and that
peace would come quickly. Well, here are nearly two
years gone and where is your beautiful peace?
The Professor. Yes, I must admit it. I did not rightly
judge the fighting power of those who are leagued against
us, and sometimes even I am discouraged. The KAISER,
perhaps, has not been well advised -
Amalie. No, that is true: the KAISER has not been well
advised; he has been very ill advised; and when he says
that he has not willed this War he speaks more truly than
he thinks. It was a very different war that he willed—he
and that poor old Austrian puppet whose strings he pulled
so successfully. Now that they are in the War I hope they
both like it. -
The Professor. Let us have no more of this. I must
now read through the lecture I have to deliver to-morrow.
Amalie. But will there be anybody to listen to it?
The Professor. There will be the one-armed Pechstein
and his lame brother, and the blind Kugelfass—that makes
only three; but the goodness of the lecture and the amount
of my salary do not depend, thank Heaven, on the size of
the audience. I shall prove to demonstration that Germany

The Professor. No, I will not leave that out. I do not

will take pleasure in it.

to give pleasure to the KAISER at such a time. But what

MUCH relief is being felt in Athens,
says a despatch, at the cessation of the
recent heat wave, which on one day
|
reached the unprecedented figure of
109° in the shade. It is only reasonable
to add that the relief is partially due to
the fact that a good deal less is now
being done in the shade.

As a result of recent experiments the

that coffee - grounds, when dried and

CoNSIDERABLE comment has been
made in the Press and elsewhere on
women's adoption of men's work, but
a reference to the Book of Ruth will
convince any unlettered penman that
there is nothing new in the idea.
Women, in fact, often did the work of
men in olden days. REBEccA surely was
the forerunner of the modern turncock,
and BoADICEA would have had no diffi-
culty in obtaining a licence from a Tram
or Motor Bus Company. Nerissa made
an excellent clerk (if we may believe

A recent speech in the House con-
tained the word “the " no fewer than
783 times. This has long been a
favourite word with orators and poets.
In JoHNSON's Rasselas it occurs on
725,487 occasions, and it is made
frequent use of in the works of
Mr. BRIDGEs and Sir ARTHUR ConAN
Doyle. OTwAY fell under its spell in
1661, and as far back as the Plantage-
net era the word was in constant use.
Tarnopol, which has been mentioned
a good deal in recent Russian and Aus-
trian communiqués, is a quaint town
with a quaint history. It is no less
than 567 miles from Paris and 389
miles from Constantinople. PLINY
refers to it in his Natural History, and
Mr. GEORGE R. SIMs tells of a jolly
little luncheon he had there in his old
Bohemian days. The town is so called
because of the hundreds of tiny lakes
in the neighbourhood. As our readers
well know, a small lake is known in
Galicia as a “tarn.”

a lapwing with a blue-and-white tail.
Any schoolboy knows that the lap-
wing's tail is invariably brown. We
are grateful to our correspondent, not
only for his interesting ornithological
discovery, but mainly for the fact that
he has supplied us with a gratuitous
paragraph. We often wonder what we
should do without our alert and generous
correspondents.

Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING,whose vigor-
ous speeches on the Air menace have
caused so much delight and chagrin
(according to the political view), is
happily named. There is a je me sais
quoi about his Christian name, sug-
gestive of the novel and sensational, and
his surname always arouses tender
reminiscences. Mr. BILLING has been
unusually honoured in having a well-
known district named after him—a
tribute to his forceful oratory—and at
Billingsgate to-day the phrase, “There's
Air,” is always associated with his life-
work. Mr. BILLING is said to be very
fond of winkles, which he eats with a
gold pin that matches his wrist-watch.
At lunch-time yesterday an interesting
discussion was raised as to which were
the widest and narrowest thorough-
fares in London. This writer plumped

Sword Alley respectively, but many

WAR'S SURPRISES.
THE SENSATIONAL SCIENTIST.
(By an Obscurantist.) i.
ALTHOUGH the teachers of my youth consistently decried
The usefulness of science and of the “modern side,”
My faith in Greek and Latin—for I have an open mind—
As an engine of efficiency had latterly declined. -
In promoting the conversion of an ancient humanist
No person played a larger part than Ebenezer Grist,
Whose eminence in science is admitted ev'rywhere,
While his works on solar physics have created quite a scare.
Of Ebenezer's intellect I always stood in awe,
Backed as it was by wonderful activity of jaw;
And in view of all the letters that accreted to his name
His diatribes inspired me with a consciousness of shame.
Now Grist is full of physics as an egg is full of meat;
In the higher mathematics he is very hard to beat;
He is deeply versed in chemistry, and at the British Ass.
He satisfies the expert and electrifies the mass.
The sense of my shortcomings, educationally viewed,
Used to plunge me very often in a suicidal mood;
But the War has turned the tables in an unexpected way
And the diatribes of Grist no longer fill me with dismay.
For ever since the fateful hour when WILHELM ran amok,
Grist's mental equilibrium has reeled beneath the shock;
One day he's wildly optimist; the next he's in the blues;
But always ready to endorse extreme or hectic views.
He swallows with avidity the marvellous reports
From ladies—all anonymous—of life in German Courts,
And still believes the Russians sent, from distant Arctic
shores, - -
Through England to the Western Front, at least six army
corps. -
Three writers in particular he's given to applaud.
For strategy and tactics he relies on Colonel MAUDE:
For prophecy he draws on WELLs; but far above these two
He places the impeccable and accurate LE QUEUX.
O Science, you've provided us with benefits galore;
You've multiplied a hundred-fold the frightfulness of War;
But as a school for character or judging other men
I'd back the old curriculum ten times in ev'ry ten.
I know it's wrong to frame a rule upon a single case;
| And I'll admit that science may regenerate the race;
I only wish to state that in these times of storm and stress
The greatest gobe-mouche that I know is Grist, an F.R.S.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 26th.-Mr. TENNANT
is growing weary of the constant
badgering to which he is sub-
jected by the champions of the
so-called conscientious objector.
Would Members, he plaintively
asked, remember that we are in
the middle of a great war and
make some kind of inquiries before
putting down their questions?
This revolutionary suggestion
dumbfounded the House. Almost
the only privilege left to private
Members is that of heckling the
Treasury Bench. If that too is
to be withdrawn, or so seriously
interfered with as the acceptance
of Mr. TENNANT's condition would
imply, how are they to earn their
salaries 2 Think, moreover, of the
difficulties it would entail. If the
Irish Member who has lately
charged himself with the task of
exposing the iniquities of British Wº
rule in Ceylon is not to be allowed Wºº
to present the affidavits that he
receives from the aggrieved Cinga-
lese — an agreeable but imagina- \\
tive race—until he has voyaged to \\
Colombo to verify them, he might \
as well go back to Ireland at once.
Besides, a dull adherence to
facts would take away much of
the gaiety of the proceedings. Last
week, for instance, the sprightly Mr.
PRINGLE and his jocular friends made
great play with a story that the Welsh
authorities had seized, with other ques-
tionable documents, a pamphlet by the
Bishop of OxFord on The Sermon on
the Mount and had refused to give it
back until its blameless character should
be established by the local constabu-
lary. Had they made the preliminary
inquiries suggested by Mr. TENNANT
they would have learned—so the HoME
SECRETARY said to-day—that the pam-
phlet had been handed to the police-
inspector for didactic purposes, with a
request that he would read it. But
then there would have been no ques-
tion, and no report interspersed with
“laughter” and “much laughter.”
If the German Government con-
tinues to starve the British prisoners
at Ruhleben the British Government
will have to “consider" the rationing
of the Germans interned in this country
—that was the gist of a long statement
by Lord Robert CECIL, which evoked
great cheering. Nobody doubts the
justice of such reprisals. The only
question is whether they would be
effective. I am afraid the German
Government's attitude is very like that
of the absentee landlord who wrote to
his agent, “Don’t let the tenants

- his reasons for resigning his post

stated them, overwhelmingly con-

of giving Home Rule a chance,
and he was a party to sending
out the MINISTER of MUNITIONs
as the Dove of Peace. But he
Nº never understood—being, I take
it, the only man in England in
this position—that a compromise
would involve the immediate set-
ting-up of an Irish Government,
and when he did understand it he
resigned. Mr. LLOYD GEORGE,
having a lot of spare time on his
hands, is said to be contemplating
a new edition of “The Natural
History of SELBoRNE,” with up-
to-date annotations.

1906, which was responsible for so
many innovations, the strictness of the
convention was relaxed, and “friend"
and “gentleman " began to be used in-
discriminately; and since the Coalition
came the distinction has almost entirely
disappeared, though I notice that Sir
FREDERICK BANBURY discourages undue
familiarity on the part of a Radical ex-
Minister who sits alongside of him on

I DISAPPROVE OF SLACKERs.
-
i-Tºrº, §."
MY DEAR GIRI,
him to-day in this form : “May I ask
my right honourable enemy?”
I remember the late Lord GoschEN
saying of Lord BEAconsPIELD's oratory,
“There is no doubt that Dizzy potted
his epigrams,” by which he meant, of
course, that when he hit upon a happy
turn of phrase he stored it away in a
mental pigeon-hole for use on an appro-
priate occasion. I wondered to-day
whether Mr. TENNANT is a student of
DISRAELI's method. Mr. BYRNE was
complaining of interference with the
correspondence of Irish “prisoners of
war" at Frongoch camp, and in proof
of his complaint offered to show him
an envelope which had been found
open. “Well,” said Mr. TENNANT,
without a moment's hesitation, “that
is not the only thing that has come
ungummed in this war.” It had all
the spontaneity of an impromptu-but
was it, I wonder 2
Thursday, June 29th.-Some of the
questions regarding the sufferings of
conscientious objectors here and in
France possibly have a real foundation
in the natural antipathy between
C.O.'s and “N.C.O.'s,” but I sus-
pect that the motive inspiring most
of them is hatred of the Military
Service Act rather than any particular
regard for its victims.
As temporary head of the War Office
and as author of the pledges alleged
to have been broken, the PRIME MINIs-
TER has a double responsibility. He
shouldered it manfully to-day. The
utmost pains, he said, would be used
to sift out from the Army those men
who had a really conscientious objec-
tion to military service, and on their
undertaking to perform other work of
national importance they would be
transferred to the Reserve. The mal-
contents were visibly delighted at this
apparent concession to their complaints.
But when Mr. Asquith, amid general
cheers, went on to say that the others
—the men who added hypocrisy to
their cowardice—would be treated with
the utmost rigour their faces fell.
While Mr. WALTER LONG has been
absent from the Treasury Bench during
the whole week, Lord LANSDown E, an-
other Minister whom rumour credited
with impending resignation, has given
no outward sign of disagreement with his
colleagues. To-day he strongly backed
Lord CREwB in deprecating the prema-
ture discussion of Irish affairs. Those
who supposed that Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's
scheme represented the official policy
of the Government were quite wrong,
it seems. His consultations with the
Irish leaders were authorised, of course,
but the results are still under discus-
sion, and have not been finally accepted
or rejected. Lord SELBoRNE, sitting
below the Gangway, was left wondering
why he had resigned.
Mr. JoyNson-Hicks and Sir RICHARD
CoopFR seized the opportunity fur-
nished by the Home Office Vote to go
“on the spy-trail,” and accused the
Government of allowing large numbers
of dangerous enemy aliens to be at
large in our midst. Mr. SAMUEL ridi-
culed the exaggerated fears indulged in
by a section of the Press. In one case
an alleged Austrian taxi-driver had
turned out to be a harmless Scotsman
with an impediment in his speech.
Still he admitted that it might be
advisable to re-examine the credentials
of uninterned aliens. Having failed,
we understand, to secure Mr. Punch's
Jimmy and his bloodhound for this
purpose he has enlisted the services of
Col. SYKEs, M.P., and his Great DANE.
“The British pursuing fleet left behind
them another German battle-cruiser, the
‘Hors-de-Combat,’ and when they returned
she was missing and must have sunk.”

Her identity is still in doubt. There
is reason to believe that the Germans
possess several warships of the same
description. -

PUSH.
“THE bells are not ringing,” said
Petunia, as I was struggling into
my greatcoat. “Will you send the
plumber 2"
The front door was open. The tonic
sharpness of the morning sun flooded
the hall. I had been doing rhythmic
breathing—five in and five out. I was
feeling fine.
“Plumber ' " I cried in derision.
“That's the sort of job a man does
for himself in war-time. All you have
to do is to get some There, I
must hurry.”
“Perhaps you will bring some home
with you ?” said Petunia, in her
smallest voice and with a look of pride.
I was half-way to the station before
the exhilaration passed off and I recog-
nised what I had let myself in for.
On the platform I saw Thompson.
Thompson is a practical man. He
has a workshop in his garden and is
in the way of making bookcases and
things for the fun of it. He even cuts
his boy's hair. I travelled to town
with him. Leaning towards me and
tapping my knee at intervals, he told
me all about it—where to buy the sal
ammoniac, how to cleanse the jars,
how to scrape the tongues. I took
careful notes. -
It may have been a fortnight later
that I brought home the sal ammoniac
in a brown paper bag, which I laid on
the hall table. After dinner I had
read the evening paper and was filling
my third pipe when Petunia, who had
left the room, re-entered, bearing the
goodly parcel, somewhat ostentatiously,
I thought.
“I was turning that little job over
in my mind,” I said calmly, but I hope
with a touch of hauteur.
“I was anxious to help,” she rejoined
sweetly. -
Then Winter came in with his wife
from next door and we played bridge.
It seemed to me that the brown paper
bag on the sideboard looked something
less than hospitable, and it took my
mind off my game. I put it back on
the hall table.
It was getting on towards midnight
when I stood on the doorstep, calling
out directions to Winter, who was
piloting his wife down the garden path
towards the gate with the help of an
electric torch. -
When I returned to the dining-room
I started winding up my watch. :
“What about getting upstairs?” I
said cheerily, through a candid yawn.
“Oh, it's early yet,” said Petunia,
also cheerily but without looking up.
My eyes were roaming idly about
the room. Suddenly I started. The
bag of sal ammoniac was ensconced
again on the sideboard. I hastily with-
held sight. A loud silence ensued.
“I meant to put these bells right
to-night,” I said.
I should have stopped there.
“You see, I must have hot water,”
I continued.
“I have lots,” cried Petunia, still
cheerily, leaping to her feet and seizing
the parcel.
“Oh, well,” I muttered, following
her with dignity to the kitchen.
After a time I began to enjoy the
job. The Leyden jars I made to shine
as they had not shone since they left
the factory. The solution was clear as
water. I replaced the cleansed tongues.
The porous pots glimmered whitely in
their appointed places.
. In my shirt sleeves, high on the steps
behind the kitchen door, I called to
Petunia—“Will you kindly depress the
bell-push in the dining-room?”
I called this in even tones.
I waited to hear the birr that would
ring down the curtain on my labours.
After a time I called again, this time
not so evenly.
“I'm pushing hard,” cried Petunia.
No further sound broke the silence.
“Try in the parlour,” I commanded.
The silence seemed more profound.
“Would you mind trying at the front-
door 2 " I asked coldly.
All the earth held its breath. -
I grew suddenly tired. The row of
gleaming pots was a noisome thing.
The silly indicator below with its fat
red stars made me sick. -
“Let's get to bed,” I was saying
when my fingers were caught in the
loathly steps. . . .
I had kicked off my slippers and
turned out the gas when the black still
air was stabbed by the shrieking of a
bell, a giant bell run amok. You realise
that it was past midnight in a house
loyally darkened in terms of the Light-
ing Regulations. With the first jarring
of the bell there percolated through
from the nursery the fractious whimper
of my heir, and there was I, without
slippers and in my pyjamas, searching
feverishly for a match. This was War.
Bearing a lighted taper, I made the
round of the house, depressing ivory
discs. The bell shrieked on. I returned
for consolation to Petunia. I found
her in the nursery, singing silly songs
to a robust child who moaned of
Zeppelins. I found her unsympathetic
to me. More in anger than in sorrow I
jabbed the bell-push by the cot. A
blissful silence fell on all the house.
“This is a man's job,” I said.

Next morning I saw Thompson stalk-
ing up and down the platform in his
four-square, arrogant way that so gets
on my nerves. In aloof tones, some-
what marred, it may be, by that appear-
ance of intimacy which a recurrent
sneeze imparts, I told him precisely
what had occurred.
“Ah!" said Thompson. It was one
of those long-drawn, cock-sure “ah's"
that are accompanied by a pointing
forefinger. “Ah!” he repeated, en-
deavouring to look like the picture in
the advertisement of a Memory Train-
ing School, “I can explain it. When
the bells were still out of operation
someone in the nursery (possibly your
son) depressed the bell-push which did
not release itself. So when the sal
ammoniac had had time to warm to
its work, of course the bell rang.”
I assured him coldly that I laid no
blame to his charge.

WHEN the great Duke MARLBoRough
took the field
The ladies waved and the belfries pealed,
The cottars shouted from roofs and ricks,
The drum-boys flourished their polished
sticks,
The cymbals clashed and the trumpets
played
A brazen, clarion fanfarade.
Behind the lumbering cannon paced
The scarlet infantry, frogged and laced;
In velvets, ruffles and crimped perukes
The noble gentlemen of the DUKE's
Terrible cavalry jingled by,
With banners splendid against the sky.
War is not what it was of yore;
Our trumpets lie in the Depôt store,
Our colours hang in the Depôt mess,
We're not conspicuous in our dress.
Leather and khaki, drab and tan
Is the dernier cri for a fighting man;
But we like our noise, and we make a
band
Of any old thing that comes to hand,
And we throw our chests and we shift
our shins
To penny-whistles and biscuit tins.
Though we drum to War on a biscuit lid
We'll do as the great Duke MARL-
Borough did. -

“Boris GoudoNov.”
SIR THoMAS BEECHAM is a good
sportsman to brave comparison with
the superb company of Russians who,
with the incomparable CHALLAPIN at
their head, carried our imagination by
assault with their epic, Boris Goudonov,
at Drury Lane in that far-away era
known as before the War. An English
chorus, with its characteristic reticence
(shall we say?), and singing in French
at that, is not really likely to be able
to give us the fire, the colour, the
movement of those born (or admirably
made) actors and musicians we were
But
there was nothing to be ashamed of in
the Aldwych excerpts and much to de-
serve applause and gratitude. - .
This work of two of the illustrious
Five of the Russian musical Renais-
sance, besides containing much that
those who “know what they like”
can appreciate at a first hearing—pass- |
ages of exquisite melody, hauntingly
sad or spirited old folk-song motives
and the vividly suggestive orchestra-
tion of RIMSKY - KoRSAKov—does need
frequent rehearsal and study by the
audience before the intricacies of the
long dramatic recitative can be mas-
tered. I think Sir Thomas is artist
enough to take as a compliment, not as
a reproach, the assumption that he is
generously preparing us for another ||
hearing of an authentic national per-
formance when in the great day of a
victorious peace we shall put some of
the gratitude and friendliness we feel
towards our indomitable comrades-in-
arms into an appreciation of the art
they love so well.
As to the performance, the rich grave.
voice of M. AUGUSTE Bouilliez won ||
the applause, long continued, of a dis-
creet house. If his acting was not on
the plane of his singing it certainly
was adequate, preserving throughout
the atmosphere of doom and suffering
which less skill would have dissipated;
Mr. RADFord, in the part of Varlaam,
a disreputable padre, showed his fine
bass to great advantage, and with his
reverend partner in insobriety, Missail
(Mr. ALFRED HEATHER), put up a really
first-rate bit of playing. Miss EDIth
CLEGG was particularly happy in the
Nurse's song, and Mr. MAURICE D'OIsLY
sang bravely as a courtier, movingly as
the idiot. The Chorus was a little impas-
sive and unlikely. Largesse of roubles,
for instance, showered on its head left
it quite unmoved. The pageantry of the
whole was beyond praise, the scenery
and dress of the Drury Lane perform-
ance being adapted with conspicuous
Success.
There is a pathos, a passion, a gran-
deur in MoUssorgsky's Boris Goudomov,
the soul of a people crying from the
depths, that puts it into the category of
very big things. Many thanks, Sir

Couldn't ever decide which had killed

THERE's ALWAYS A REAsoN.
IT is odd how one little grievance, if
well nourished, can darken all within
and without. - . . /
I was sitting recently in one of those
temples of promiscuous conversationand
momentary acquaintanceship, a third-
class railway compartment, listening to
three men-laying down the law as
regards Ireland and managing, with far
more skill than Sir John JELLIcoe or
Sir Dougi,As HAIG, the Jutland battle
and our task on the Western Front.
After having settled those things,
they turned to other less important
matters, and one of them, who, in spite
of the unwonted seasonableness of the
day, wore a look of profound dejec-
tion, which only increased with each
glance at the sunshine flooding the
landscape, remarked, apparently d propos |
of nothing, that what he for one could
not stand was calling things out of
their right name. • *
Neither of the others replying to
this, he repeated it. He might, he said,
be peculiar. No doubt he was. No
doubt he was different from other
people, who were all wiser than he.
But one thing he couldn't do with was
calling things out of their right name.
If ever there was a conversational
opening, it was here; but neither of
the other men was interested enough
to pick up the gauntlet; and that duty
therefore, urged by his dejected eye, fell
to me.
I asked him what in particular was
his trouble.
“This daylight-saving,” he said, with
immense scorn in his voice and a wither-
ing glance outside. “Why is it called
daylight-saving when it's not daylight-
saving at all?”
“How 2 " I asked.
“Why, it's daylight-spºnding, of
course. There's more daylight to spend,
and we spend it.” He scowled again
at the sun. “People use it to their
hearts' content, and directly it begins to
fail them they go to bed. How can
that be called saving?” \
It is the kind of question that requires
only a corroborative look, and I suppose
I gave it. -
“But do you know what the thing
ought to be called 2" he went on.
“Not daylight - saving, but artificial
light-saving. Lamp-oil-saving. Can-
dle-saving.”
“Well,” said one of the other men,
“it doesn't matter, does it? What's
in a name 2"
“What's in a name?” the angry man
—for he was now quite angry—replied.
“Truth's in a name. Why not be
truthful? Why pretend you're saving
daylight when you're really spending
it? Why pretend you're saving day-
light when you're really saving lamp-
oil and candles and electric light and
gas” I call it sickening.”
Behind such acrimony there must,
I thought, be some hidden motive; but
I did not guess it.
The second of the other men, how-
ever, did. -
“What is your line of business, may
I ask?” he inquired overtly.
“That's nothing to do with it,” said
the angry man.
“Still, I suppose you have no objec-
tion to making it public,” the second
other man persisted.
“None at all,” said the angry man.
“I travel in lamps and candles.”

THE WEATHER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-May I ask you to
make public a suggestion which, if it
were followed, would save a great deal
of disappointment and annoyance to all
classes of people 2. It is that, as all
clocks have been put forward one hour
for Summer Time, so all barometers
should be set back one inch for Summer
Weather. The usual readings would
then range from “Stormy” and “Rain.”
to “Change,”and so would be much more
appropriate to ordinary weather con-
ditions during the Summer than “Fair”
and “Very Dry,” and other misleading
indications.
I am, Yours obediently,

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks)
IN the great days to which the prophets point us, when
a man ignorant of what an ama'ba has a right to require
of its stomach shall be looked upon as irremediably dis-
graced, when Eton shall be a College of Engineering and
Winchester shall shine as a Natural History Museum—in
that bright future it may occur to some bold investigator
to examine and, perhaps, to defend our ancient Public
School system and the grand old fortifying classical curri-
culum on which it was based. Much he will doubtless
find to reprehend, but he will be able at least to say that
the men produced by that system did as a matter of fact
show themselves equal to high emergencies, and that they
did this because they had acquired the great gift of cha-
racter. And if he wants an example to prove his point he
may choose Letters from Flanders (SMITH, ELDER), a
memorial to the brothers A. D. and T. C. GILLESPIE, who
without a murmur gave up their lives for their country in
the war now proceeding. With one exception the Letters
are written by Douglas GILLESPIE. They are such letters
as any parents might be proud to have received, direct,
if the country-side were singing gently to itself in the
midst of all our noise and confusion and muddy work; so
that you felt that the nightingale's song was the only real
thing which would remain when all the rest was long past
and forgotten. . . . So I stood there and thought of all
the men and women who had listened to that song, just as
for the first few weeks after Tom [his brother] was killed I
found myself thinking perpetually of all the men who had
been killed in battle—Hector and Achilles and all the
heroes of long ago, who were once so strong and active
and now are so quiet. . . . Then I gathered my platoon
together and marched back past the silent farms to our
billets.” Such is the stuff of these delightful letters. By
way of preface there is a touching tribute to the two
brothers by the Bishop of SouthwARK.
Originality of title counts for something in a novel. The
fantastic inconsequence of Mrs. BARNES-GRUNDY's last
achievement, Candytuft—I mean Veronica, was undeni-
ably arresting; and now, when she reappears with a title as
brisk and artless as An Undressed Heroine (HUTCHINSON),
one must admit, however bashfully, that it clings to the
memory. Some may say that any trick for catching a

straightforward, and simple accounts of the daily life of reader is legitimate, and, whatever the ethics of the situa-

a nightingale sing “sweetly and clearly in the quiet
intervals between the bursts of firing. There was some-
thing infinitely sweet and sad about it,” he continues, “as

by which the author, having first caught her reader, soon

that he did not correspond to General MAxwell's idea of
“a tactful thruster.” Readers of this racy record may form
their own judgment as to his qualifications for the title.
Anyhow he seems always to have known what he wanted,

THE TEST OF BATTLE.
WE are not good at shouting in the street,
At waving flags or tossing caps in air;
We take our triumphs as we take defeat
With scarce a hint of having turned a hair;
And so our pride to-day
Declines to boom itself the German way.
Yet we are proud because at last, at last
We look upon the dawn of our desire;
Because the weary waiting-time is passed
And we have tried our temper in the fire;
And, proving word by deed,
Have kept the faith we pledged to France at need.
But most because, from mine and desk and mart,
Springing to face a task undreamed before,
Our men, inspired to play their prentice part
Like soldiers lessoned in the school of war,
True to their breed and name
Went flawless through the fierce baptismal flame.
And he who brought these armies into life,
And on them set the impress of his will—
Could he be moved by sound of mortal strife

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(Dr. OHNEsong and Major KIESE.L.)
Dr. O. And now, I suppose, I must begin my round,
though it fills my heart with disgust to have to deal with
these English prisoners. A more insolent and discontented
lot it would be impossible to find.
Major K. If that is your feeling, what do you think mine
must be? You run through your round and then you're
done with it. A little brimstone to one and a pot of oint-
ment to another, and away you go. But I'm the com-
mandant of this accursed prison, and I have to stay on the
spot and expose myself to all their complaints. They seem
to believe that they have a right to be fed. Right, indeed!
There's no such thing. They're prisoners, and they must
be made to understand that if they get a crust of bread or
half-a-pint of bone soup it is only by the exercise of that
true-German clemency of , which the scoundrels make a
mockery.
Dr. O. And then these English pigs expose themselves
voluntarily to every kind of horribly infectious disease, so
that perhaps an American may come to visit the prison and
ask why they are in such a condition. Do the English and
the Americans imagine that for their sakes an honest
German doctor is going to expose himself and his family
and his friends to the ravages of typhus, for instance?
Major K. Bravo. I think as you do. And whenever I
hear of one of the prisoners lamenting himself because he
is starving I immediately sentence him to a week's pun-
ishment on half-rations just to make him appreciate the
blessings of being under the control of the Imperial Govern-
ment. Bah! I have no pity for such miserable cattle.
Dr. O. No, nor I, and that is the opinion of every good
German. Have they not made war on us and delayed our
final and complete victory? Nothing can be bad enough
for these mercenaries who seek to enslave the whole
world.
Major K. Well, as commandant of the prison it is my
duty to see that they have no luxuries.
Dr. O. And it is my duty to see that they do not pretend
to be ill in order to escape what is due to their wickedness.
For them it is a sufficient favour that they are allowed to
breathe German air and to walk about on German soil.
Major K. And if they have the bad taste to die, that is
not our affair. -
Dr. Q. Certainly not. We need not interfere to prevent
it. It is a riddance of bad rubbish, and it is not for us to
protest against it.
[A pause, during which they look hard at one another.
Finally the Major breaks silence. He is much agitated
and his words come quickly.]
Major K. No, it is useless. I cannot keep it back any
longer. My service hitherto has been honourable. Why
should I now be condemned to this dreadful duty 2 And it
is useless to attempt to soften the lot of the unhappy
wretches who are entrusted to one's care. A report is
made to one's superiors and in the end it comes under the
eyes of the All-Highest, who, as is well known, disapproves
of leniency. And then the office and the miserable salary.
attached to it will be taken away from me, and how shall
I and my family live? What is to be done?
Dr. O. You have said what I feel. I too am ashamed
of what I do and I am pursued by the horrible visions that
I see when I make my round. But one must obey superior
orders and one cannot do what is displeasing to the
authorities. You, at any rate, have your Iron Cross, but I
have not even that.
Major K. Willingly would I hand mine over to you, if
that were possible. No matter, it is good to have spoken
one's mind for once and to have relieved one's conscience
of a heavy load.
Dr. O. But we shall have to reload it, I am afraid, and
then some day when we least expect it the American

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SELF-MADE STATUE.
Not the least of the Zoological Gar-
dens' many attractions is their inex-
haustibility. There is always something
new, and—what is not less satisfactory
—there is always something old that
you had previously missed. How is
that ? How is it that one may go to
the Zoo, which to-day is chiefly re-
markable for the iº. of wounded
soldiers who visit it, in their blue suits
and white facings, and the red ties that
once proclaimed the Socialist but will
evermore have a martial connotation—
how is it that one may go to the Zoo a
thousand times (as I have done) and
consistently overlook one of its
most ingratiating denizens, and
then on the thousand-and-first
visit come upon this creature as
though he was the latest arrival,
although he has known Regent's
Park for years? How is that?
There the quaint little ab-
surdity was, all that long while,
as ready to be seen as to-day,
but you never saw him, or, at
any rate, you never noticed him.
The time was not yet. It is as
though a Zoo animal's hour has
to strike just as certainly as a
General's.
Yesterday, for me, the hour of
the Prairie Marmot struck.
Countless are the times that
I have passed the enclosure
which, though the P.M. shares it
with the grey squirrel, its North
American compatriot, really be-
longs to neither of them, but
to pigeons and sparrows. No
doubt you know this enclosure.
With great injustice to the
Prairie Marmots, it is called
“The Squirrels' Trees,” and it
is one of the least clever things
spectacle that excites no wonder; and
reflecting thus I left my usual beat
and took unconsciously the path to
“The Squirrels' Trees,” and was there
suddenly conscious of the oddest little
statuette I ever saw. Pigeons, squir-
rels, and sparrows were moving rest-
lessly about the enclosure in an
eternal quest for food, and in their
midst, obviously made of stone, although
coloured to resemble fur, was the rigid
effigy, some ten inches high, of as
comic a creature as a human artist
ever designed—indeed an absolute gift
to the Royal Zoological Society, from
the fancy of Miss BEATRIx Potter.
There this figure stood, without a flicker.

elephants and the water-beetles, the
avadavats and the hartebeests, “and,
by-the-way, how is the Cynomys Ludo-
vicianus & Does he seem to thrive?
Does he prosper and multiply, or is the
competition of the Columba Londinien-
sis” (meaning the Metropolitan pigeon)
“too much for him?” But, whatever
you call him, the Prairie Marmot re-
mains a most ingratiating creature, and
when you see him with his two tiny
hands holding a monkey-nut and con-
suming it with eager bites you feel that
it must have been of him that the well-
worn phrase, “to sit up and take
nourishment,” was first used.
In the unimportant intervals between
these two actions—this vertical
eating and the sudden trans-
formation of himself into stone,
which is his greatest gift and
which he does so often that he
has worn his poor tail into a
threadbare stump-the Prairie
Marmot is of no particular in-
terest. He just creeps about or
disappears into his crater in the
bank. But as his own statue
—so perfect as not only to be
the despair but the bankruptcy
of our sculptors—he is terrific.
And the change is so sudden.
One moment he is on all-fours,
and the next he is a rock, as
though a magician had waved
his wand. DE MATTos' marble
negro close by is not more still.
Henceforth no visit to the
Zoo will be, to me, complete
without a few minutes' con-
templation of the Cymomys Lu-
doviciants in his quick-change
turn.
War Time Extravagance.
“Along the escarpment of the Chil-
tern Hills the deadly nightshade is a
fairly common plant, the henbane
in these Gardens, so clever as a
whole, because the heavy coping of the
wire fence comes at precisely the height
of an ordinary person's line of vision, so
that to see the occupants one has to
creep about with bent head. The en-
closure is near the melancholy eagles,
and it has on one side of it the aquarium
where the diving-birds pursue their live
prey with such merciless zest and punc-
tuality every day at 12 and 5, and on
the other is the statue of the giant
negro in conflict with the angry mother
of cubs.
I had been watching a tender fare-
well between two soldiers and two girls
(for there are other things to see at the
Zoo besides its cages), and was medi-
tating upon the change that has come
over London, so that Mr. Atkins publicly
embracing a quite recent acquaintance,
with no little resonance, is now a
LoT's wife was not more motionless.
And then, a small girl with a bag
approaching the railings, he came to
life in a flash, the perpendicular sud-
denly gave way to the horizontal, and
he trotted down to meet her much as
any other rodent would do.
The Prairie Marmot is a rat-like
creature, but blunter, stockier and twice
as big, and light-brown in colour. The
learned, of course, after their wont,
know him by a lengthier and more im-
osing name. Dr. CHALMERSMITCHELL,
F. example, who controls the Zoo so
ably and with such imagination, would
never say Prairie Marmot on those
occasions when he has questions to
ask as to its well-being in captivity.
Nothing so commonplace. “And by-
the-way,” he would add, having been
satisfied as to the good health of the
comparatively rare, but the foxglove
quite luxurious.”

TEACHING PLAY WEIGHTS TO
WRITE PLAYS.
WE learn that, following American
example, a school has lately been started
in London for the encouragement, or
extinction, of would - be dramatists.
Classes are held, suitable to beginners
or more advanced students. With an
eye to the correct placing of aspirants,
we beg to offer to the authorities some
suggestions for an “Entrance Paper”
on the approved lines of those employed
at similar institutions.
A.
(STAGE DomesTIC ARCHITECTURE, AND
Use of THE TELEPHoNE.)
1. Why should the bedroom of a
domestic-comedy-flat invariably open
out of the drawing-room ?
2. In farce, the riskiness increases
in the direct ratio of the number of
doors. Discuss this statement.
3. Estimate the comparative delay
in getting a telephone call put through
(a) in real life ; (b) in emotional
drama.
4. Under what circumstances may a
character on the stage repeat aloud all
that the person at the other end of the
wire is supposed to be saying?
5. “The stage-telephone is the child
of Soliloquy by Science.” What does
this mean—if anything?
B.
(PLOT.)
1. Having laid your first Act in Bel-
gravia, bring all your characters, male
and female, into a second Act, of which
the scene is (a) a Mercury Mine; (b) a
South Sea Island; (c) a Dug-out in
Russian Poland.
2. Dare you introduce a Bank into a
play and allow it to remain solvent
throughout? Why not ?
3. Explain why burglars on the stage
are so often mentally deficient.
4. Construct a curtain-raiser, the plot
of which shall be so obvious that it can
be grasped by an overfed occupant of
the stalls entering when seven-ninths
of it have been performed.
C.
(DIALOGUE.)
1. “Let me tell you a little story.”
Write a speech for the actor-manager,
by which he shall reconcile the young
lovers, in the form of an anecdote
about (a) a French Cook; (b) a Tiger
Shoot.
2. What would happen to anyone in
real life who talked like this?
D.
(FLEXIBILITY.)
1. Adapt the Third Act of Hamlet so
as to render it a suitable medium for
the personalities of:—
Mr. We EDON GROSSMITH.
Mr. THESIGER.
Miss WESTATILLEY.
2. Re-write Macbeth, giving the fat to
Banquo.
E.
(GENERAL, UTILITY.)
1. Compose a covering note of not
more than twelve lines, to go with a
five-act comedy submitted to a manager.
2. Why do you consider the failures
of the past season failed? (N.B.-All
answers treated as strictly confidential.)
3. What is your private income?
“I opened my mouth to speak, I swallowed
twice—and I closed it.”—Morning Paper.
This is not so easy as it sounds. Our
own simple habit is to close the mouth
before swallowing.
“Though Parisian chic at the present time
consists in being dressed with the utmost
simplicity, it is no longer considered correct
to ignore clothes entirely.”

THE LANES LEADING DOWN TO THE TEIAMES.
There are beautiful lanes leading down to the Thames
By the meadows all studded with buttercup gems,
Where the thrush and the blackbird and cuckoo all day
Waft their songs on the incense of roses and may.
But the lanes here in London, near warehouse and mart,
Are as winding and steep and as dear to my heart;
Their mansions all mildewed in tenderest tones,
With priceless old doorways by INIGo Jones.
Though the roadway is rough and the cobbles are hard,
There are plane-trees in leaf in St. Dunstan's churchyard,
And the twittering sparrows their parliament keep
In the peaceful demesne where the citizens sleep.
Oh! the sights and the sounds of those wonderful lanes,
The tramp of the horses, the creak of the cranes,
Men fresh from the perils that lurk in the seas,
The balm of the Indies that spices the breeze.
Crude critics find fault with the fish-porters' yells,
The strength of the briny and orangey smells,
But they're part of the charm of the lanes I hold dear,
“Harp,” “Pudding” and “Idol,” “Love,” “Water” and
“Beer.”

OUT ON THE WAR-PATH.
THE NEW SECRETARY FOR WAR (MR. LLOYD GEORGE) AND HIs TRUSTY HENCHMAN (Lord DERBY).
Monday, July 3rd. — Mr. McCALLUM
Scott is seriously perturbed about an
impending shortage of sausage-skins,
and, in spite of Mr. HARcourt's assur-
ance that supplies are ample, he is said
to be planning a fresh campaign, with
the assistance of Mr. Hogg|E, of the
apposite name.
Mr. Hogg|E, however, is at present
occupied with the refusal of the War
Office to allow bag-pipes to the third
line of Highland regiments. Perhaps
this too is due to a shortage of the raw
material; if so America might once again
come to our assistance, for it is notori-
ous that up to the present the Chicago
pork-packers have found a use for every
part of the pig except the squeal.
The PostMASTER-GENERAL could not
boast to-day that his department was
enjoying the piping times of PEASE, for
the War has taken away a very large pro-
portion of its employés and halved its
contribution to the Exchequer. But he
justly claimed that it was doing splendid
work in ministering to the comfort of
our soldiers and sailors abroad.
After this the House enjoyed the
refreshing experience of “a nicht wi'
BURNs.” It is nearly two years since
the late President of the Board of Trade
resigned his office, and from that day
to this, although cherishing no consti-
tutional objection to the sound of his
own voice, he has never opened his
mouth in public. But to-day he could
refrain no longer. The South-Eastern
Railway sought powers to strengthen
that appalling monstrosity, the Charing
Cross railway-bridge. “Honest John's”
asthetic instincts revolted at the pros-
pect, and inspired his tongue to pic-
turesque denunciation, concluding with
the promise that, if the House would
throw out the proposal, he would guar-
antee, with the assistance of the public
authorities, to build a bridge which
should be a credit to London. This
pontifical assurance brought down the
House, and with it the Bill.
Tuesday, July 4th-So far as resign-
ation is concerned the late Minister of
Agriculture is still ploughing a lonely
furrow, but, to vary the metaphor,
he shows no disposition to sulk in his
tent. On the contrary, whenever his
last legislative offspring, the Small
Holding Colonies Bill, is under discus-
sion Lord SELBoRNE is in his place to
help it. To-day he stated that the
number of soldiers who had definitely
announced their intention of settling on
the land when they left the colours was
far larger than he had ever anticipated.
Lord RUSSELL invited the Peers to
assent to the apparently otiose motion
that it is undesirable to subject military
prisoners to punishments unauthorised
by law. The PRIMATE and several
temporal Peers supported it; no one
opposed it; and yet the House as a
whole showed a strange indisposition
to vote for it. When the division was
called noble Lords left the body of the
House and “rallied round the Throne,”
in the belief, apparently, that if there
were no tellers on the other side the
motion would fall to the ground; but
the LoRD CHANCELLOR declared the
motion carried.
Mr. OUTHWAITE asked to-day how
many Germans had been killed since
August, 1914, and how many Germans
reached the age of eighteen last year. His
object, as he subsequently explained,
was to show the futility of the War.
But Mr. TENNANT, to the joy of the
House, pretended to assume that the
question was prompted by the hon.
Member's craving for bloodshed.
Not so long ago a measure entitled
Output of Beer (Restriction) Bill would
have caused consternation in the Whips'
Office, where any proposal to “rob a
poor man of his beer” was regarded as
spelling electoral ruin for the party
responsible. But under the Coalition
the House has had so many similar
shocks that it passed the Bill with very
little amendment or discussion. Even
less opposition was excited by a mea-
sure authorising gas establishments to
substitute a standard of calorific power
for a standard of illuminating power.
Indeed there is reason to believe that
some Members instinctively prefer the
gas which engenders heat to that which
produces light.
Wednesday, July 5th.-Sir John REEs
must sometimes regret his early days
in Parliament, when he sat upon the
Liberal side and devoted himself with
much success to ridiculing the so-
called “friends of India” who worried
the Treasury Bench with exaggerated
stories of police brutality. He was
always sure of a cheer from the Tories,
and sometimes earned the gratitude of
an Under-Secretary. Since his change
of heart and party he has not had
nearly such a good time, and has
himself been the butt of Ministerial
humour. To-day, for example, when he

put an apparently harmless question
about the lack of information regard-
ing the exploits of individual regiments

many thousands of people—Mr. TEN-

remark that the War Office could not

gentleman to innumerable questions
concerning the interests of slackers
and shirkers he was reprimanded by
the SPEAKER, with, as it seemed to me,
quite unnecessary severity.
The Acquisition of Land Bill, by
which the Government sought powers
to acquire permanently, by compulsory
purchase, land on which they had
erected buildings for the purposes of
the War, had an unusually rough re-
ception. “Proputty” was, of course, up
in arms against it, and was joined on
this occasion by land-nationalizers, who
thought the land - owners were being
treated too well, and by spokesmen
of the Commons Preservation Society,
rightly jealous for the open spaces
of posterity. Though the SoDICITOR-
GENERAL, bowing before the storm,
promised ample amendment in Com-
mittee, some of the malcontents insisted
on taking a division, and the unique
spectacle was witnessed of Sir F. BAN-
BURY and Mr. OuthwAITE blowing into
the same Lobby from diametrically
oppositeFº of the compass.
Thursday, July 6th.-Thirteen years
ago, when Mr. WYNDHAM's great Land
Purchase Act had ended the age-long
strife between landlords and tenants, an
Irishman complained that there was
no longer any diversion in his country
“since the peace broke out.” Whether
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's proposals will have
the same effect is at present doubtful;
but already they have produced some
strange anomalies. Mr. HEALY has
taken fright at the REDMOND-CARson
alliance, and daily snipes at Mr. SAMUEL
for his treatment of the Irish “prisoners
of war.” The HoME SECRETARY is not,
however, as cruel as Mr. HEALY makes
out, for he has stoutly refused to allow
the said prisoners to be interviewed by
Mr. GINNELL.
Meanwhile Sir EDwARD CARSoN,
whose political career until 1914 was
entirely devoted to resisting Home
Rule, now spends much of his time in

Some noble lords breathed an almost
audible sigh of relief when Lord BEREs-
FoRD announced that he would postpone
his inquiries regarding the loss of H.M.S.
Hampshire, for he has been so indus-
trious lately that he, to say nothing of
themselves, must require a rest. It is,
I think, a pity that Sir RICHARD Cooper
did not follow Lord BERESFORD's ex-
ample. Sir RICHARD is one of those
ingenuous souls to whom people delight
to impart startling information, know-
ing that he will give it a hospitable wel-
come. But when he redistributes it
indiscriminately to the world at large
he is too generous. So at least Dr. MAC-
NAMARA seems to have thought, for he
declined to put official labels on the col-
lection of canards let loose by the Hon.
Baronet.

IN ante-Armageddon days,
When Parliament had gone its ways
And the manoeuvres had begun,
You loved to march, in rain or sun,
With Tommies—so at least I’ve read,
Nor ever heard the tale gainsaid.
But when the War broke out you lent
Your colleagues no encouragement,
And, though pugnaciously inclined,
Most unaccountably resigned.
At previous crises such an exit
Might well have spelt a resurrezit,
But, as it was, our stars we thank
That you without a ripple sank.
Since then close on two years have come
And gone, and yet you still are dumb.
No word of comfort or of cheer
Have you vouchsafed, or made it clear
You wish to see the cause succeed
For which your friends in khaki bleed.
Dumb, did I say? Nay, I was wrong;
Last week your silence, strangely long,
Was broken and you spoke at last
A veritable trumpet-blast,
Not on the progress of the War,
Not on the fight off Jutland's shore,
Not on the exploits writ in flame
Upon the golden book of fame—
No, no, a more inspiring theme
Let loose the long-imprisoned stream,
To wit, the site where you have planned
The Thames should once again be
spanned.
Well, while it don't amount to much
Or emulate the “Nelson touch,”
This speech, though limited in range,
May herald further wholesome change,
And in another year, perhaps,
We'll find you cheering on our chaps.
At worst, the silent Pacifists
Are better than the vocalists
Who, like TREVELYAN and SHAw,
Comfort the foe with pen and jaw;
And for this reticence, I suppose,
Some thanks to you the public owes;

throat,
With Ponsonby you sit and vote,

MORE BENEWOLENT NEUTRALITY.
I KNow a man who was ten months
at the Front dodging coal-boxes and
“Black Marias.” He came home last
month and broke his leg trying to
dodge a perambulator at Hyde Park
Corner. My case is somewhat similar.
At Gallipoli I dodged dysentery, jaun-
dice and kindred ills, but at last I met
my fate. A few days ago, I was
vaguely conscious of a nagging pain
under the two back buttons of my
trousers and in my left knee and foot.
I told the Adjutant and found him
interested but not sympathetic.
“You’ve got sciatica,” he said ex-
ultingly. “Do you feel tired in the
small of your back? Have you pains
in your hip and down your legs, and
aches in your feet?”
I confessed to all these symptoms.
“Ah!” he said, “shocking thing
that. Had an aunt who died of it
once. Plays the deuce with a man
of your age. You had better see the
Doc. right away. He'll get a board
fixed up for you.”
He pushed the bell and the mess
corporal appeared.
“Bring me a long whiskey,” he said.
“Me too,” I murmured.
The Adjutant looked aghast. “Whis-
key with sciatical” he exclaimed.
“No, with soda,” I said.
“All right,” said he, “it’s your
funeral.”
The next day the doctor came and
gloated over me. “Does that hurt?”
he asked, sticking a stubby thumb into
the small of my back.
He looked resentfully at me as he
picked himself p from the floor.
“I'm sorry,” I told him, “but I was
scarcely ready for that.”
“You can be boarded to-morrow,”
he said as he left hurriedly.
I was boarded, and got a month's
leave and some advice. I was told to
go to one Friedenborg for massage, and
I went. - - -
Friedenborg proved to be a pleasant-
faced Swede, É. his looks belied him.
The Grand Inquisitors of Spain were
novices to him. He ushered me into
a small room and in an unguarded
moment I allowed myself to be divested
of all clothing and laid face downwards
on a velvet couch. I hate velvet at any
time. The touch of velvet or peach-
skins is enough to make my teeth go
on edge all down my back.
The Swede stood over me with the
expression of JACK JoHNSON just before
he hit up the Bowery Pet at Bashville,
Illinois.
“I think this is the place,” he said
as he made a savage jab at the back of
my thigh.
“I can feel it,” I said as I came
down on the sofa again. I made up
my mind not to let him see my true
feelings and composed myself to die as
an English gentleman should, although
it hurt my pride to meet my end at the
hands of a neutral.
Presently he brought out a table with
an instrument upon it like an over-
grown dentist's drill. At the end of a
cable were two hard rubber balls.
These he put on the middle of my
back and then turned over a switch.
“It is a vibrator,” he hissed between
his teeth. I had almost guessed it
myself, but I did not argue.
Shutting my eyes I could easily
imagine myself in a London bus, and
if anyone had called, “Fares, please,”
I'd have felt for my pocket, which
wasn't there. Just when I was getting
used to the thing he stopped. “Marble
Arch 2 " I hazarded, but he was in no
mood for humour. He got to work
with his hands.
First of all he kneaded my hip-joint
into a soft dough, which he pulled out
into strings like an American shop-girl
with her chewing-gum. Then he let
them go again like loosened pieces of
siastić. He burrowed in amongst my
joints like a terrier at a rabbit-hole, all
the time giving little grunts of satis-
faction when I jumped. Soon I got
wiser, and when he hurt most I lay
still, and jumped when he got on to a
comparatively painless spot. By this
simple stratagem I contrived to keep
him busy without disappointing him
or depriving him of his exercise. I
rather wished he had been a real in-
quisitor, for I would have become a
Brahmin or even a Buff Orpington to
have him stop. Any old creed would
have done me if he would only have
left me alone.
Then a galling thought crossed my
mind. I was paying him to do all this,
and only the week before I had sworn
off theatres because I considered them
extravagant in war-time.
Presently he transferred his atten-
tions to my spine. He played at being
a devout monk, using my vertebrae as
a rosary. He took each of them
separately and ran them along my
spinal cord like beads on a Chinese
abacus, clicking them together.
In between the more strenuous
efforts he discoursed on the War.
“The Germans will soon begin to feel
the pinch,” he said suddenly as he
grabbed a handful of flesh from my
back.
“If it's a pinch like that I almost
feel sorry for them,” I thought.
“But is this blockade stopping their
food 2" he demanded, as he ran a row
of horny knuckles up my back.
“Ah,” I said, “there's the rub.”
He discoursed on the Western offen-
sive, and gave an imitation of trench-
digging on my hip-joint. Then he
talked about mining and ran out a
whole series of deep saps from my
ankle to my knee, counter-mining on
the other leg until he ended with an
explosive burst that would have de-
stroyed a whole battalion. I bit hard
into the wooden head-rail of the sofa
for the rest of the séance, and at last
he finished.
Before I knew what was happening
he had booked another appointment
for the next day. -
Since then I have been again many
times, and all my pains have fled. The
little devils in charge of the sciatica
department gave it best, and realized
that the Swede was their master. My
mental outlook has changed also, for
at first I prayed nightly that England
would declare war on Sweden. Now
I am grateful, and fully recognize the
meaning of a benevolent neutrality.

“I’M NOT AsKING TO BE LET OFF–I'M ASKING FOR MORE TIME.
“How LoNG WILL THEY TAKE?”
“OH, ABOUT THREE YEARs—or THE DURATION OF THE WAR.”
I've GOT A LOT of contRACTS TO FINISH.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Books of good short stories, I rejoice to see, multiply
apace. The latest to come my way is a volume collected
by Mr. W. J. LocKE, and called by him Far-away Stories
(LANE), because, as he explains in his preface, they were
written in days and about conditions of life that now seem
incredibly remote. Perhaps this is not the least part of
their attraction. For the rest, though I will not deny that
some flavour of the frankly popular magazine pervades
them, there remains also a great deal of that delicate charm
that I have learnt to associate with any writing over
Mr. LocKE's name. In particular I might distinguish two
of the stories. The first is a very pleasant fancy about an
old musician who wrote a Song of Life, and his pupil who
unwittingly stole the theme and made a work of genius
from it. The other is called “A Christmas Mystery,” and,
though I have a strong suspicion that it was written to the
order of one of those early-November annuals, it certainly
goes to prove that even pot-boiling can be made a process
of real beauty. By the way, in that same agreeable little
preface of his Mr. LocKE speaks of “the two stories that I
love the best.” I should have been interested to see if his
choice coincided with my own; but, perhaps discreetly,
he leaves this a matter of speculation. Anyhow, I am glad
that he cared enough for the lot of them to rescue them from
premature burial in the rayless obscurity of back numbers.
None of the many war books now appearing can have
been written with a purpose that commands more hearty
sympathy than the little volume to which Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD has given the title England's Effort (SMITH, ELDER).
It contains a series of letters written to an American friend,
real or imaginary, with the object of instructing Trans-
atlantic opinion upon the work that this country has done
and is doing for the common cause of civilisation. There
could be few writers better fitted for this most important
duty. Mrs. WARD speaks not only with the authority of a
great reputation, but her position, even her sex, as an out-
side non-military spectator, lends an added weight to her
words. How urgently needed some such report has been
we all know. The thought of those Teutonic lie-factories,
working overtime (and wholly unrestricted by quality of
output) to pervert neutral sympathies, has long been one
to sting and irritate. As you turn Mrs. WARD's instructive
and moving pages you will share with me the satisfaction
of feeling, “Well, at any rate they know that 1.” And not
only will the book be of value to American readers; often
as we on this side have read about England at war, each
fresh writer who has the power to transfer a true impres-
sion of it to paper opens for us a new aspect of the most
heart-stirring spectacle in our national history. It is a
task to which the ablest of English pens may be fittingly
addressed.
In The Human Boy and the War (METHUEN), it is
clear that Mr. EDEN PHILLPoTTs was occasionally hard
put to it to establish the connection, and consequently
these stories lack the spontaneity which made The Human
Boy, without any war attached to him, such a delightful
study. Though I cannot precisely visualize the school in
which the heroes of these exploits are harboured, many of
the boy-portraits are very lifelike, and this is the more
creditable to the author's creative imagination, for some of
his types—notably the fist-fighters—are out of date. I

wish that we had been spared the German boy, because
the Bosch in fiction is apt to appear an anaemic creature
when compared with the Bosch in being. But on the
whole I can say that I am as much amazed by Mr. PHILL-
Potts' ingenuity as I am by his industry, which is very
warm praise.
It is a curious paradox that Americans, while priding
themselves on a national hardheadedness and insisting
that those who want to succeed in the United States must
“deliver the goods,” are beyond all other peoples susceptible
to the influence of Talk. America is the land of “silver-
tongued” talkers. This is the burden of MARY S. WATTs's
new novel, The Rudder (MACMILLAN), the story of T.
Chauncey Devitt, Labour Leader (till his boss had no
further use for him) and, later, Temperance Orator. Mrs.
WATTs has drawn Chauncey's character subtly and at con-
siderable length, but we get the man's portrait complete
It's bright with many a gay conceit
And stuck with gems of sparkling wit:
Its dialogue is crisp and neat;
Et-cetera's the name of it.
Old fairy-tales in modern dress,
Short dainty sketches, little plays
Writ in the vein of happiness
Before the world was set ablaze—
The book can hardly do as well
As to my thinking it deserves;
But, even though it may not sell,
It's very soothing to the nerves.

Chauncey expostulated. To
which the Boss replies with
great pertinence, “Say, don't
you think you've done enough
talking?” Chauncey was what
is known in America as a “spell-
binder,” and, without saying
anything that would not have
been laughed at by an intelligent
man, he created strikes, domin-
ated his fellow-citizens, and in
a word acquired the influence
which a thousand other Ameri-
cans of exactly the same gifts
are acquiring every day in the
United States. It is a bitter
piece of portraiture, which only
a writer as capable as Mrs.
WATTS could havo saved from
being caricature. Excellent as
all her novels have been, I think
that I enjoyed this one most.
In The Rudder her humour finds
greater scope. The book is full
of laughter, for all that it is
a serious examination into the
sores of the American body poli-
tic. Much of the story is seen
through the eyes of Marshall
Cook, a whimsical novelist, one

ings in the Royal Automobile

(in the Turkish baths of that

kind of thing in about five
minutes), clumsily fell on the
knife and passed. The Bad

at Jim and was unmercifully
thrashed by same, fell off his
yacht in a storm, but had
enough breath to classify Jim
at last as his lawful son and
legal heir before he went out.

DECLINE OF THE FAvourite.
[The German-American, KARL voN WIEGAND, has sent from Berlin
to The New York World a despatch—nobody knows how it got past the
Censor–containing some very painful reflections on the enemy's loss
of initiative and other signs of declension.]
WHAT ails our hyphenated friend ?
What is the trouble with our Yank-Bosch,
That tempts him in his newest tract
To deviate into naked fact
Who used to write such rank bosh 2
He that for neutral ears would rend
The well-in with his faked recitals
Now undergoes a change of lip
And talks about a “vice-like grip."
Squeezing the Teuton's vitals.
A sad, sad falling-off in tone
Upon the Eastern Front he's noted ;
, Mentions the “thin anaemic line"
Once ruddy with the flesh of swine
And beautifully bloated.
When troops from West to East are thrown,
And back from Russia into France, it
Appears to him great rot to go
Shoving your warriors to and fro
By locomotive transit.
He finds the Allies, who of old
Followed the Fatherland's dictating,
Now do—just when and where they chocºe,
Without consulting German views—
Their own initiating.
O why has KARI, become so cold
And dropped the faith he kept on pledging?
Because, for fear his fancied horse
Might fail to stay the sticky course,
He 's had to do some hedging. O. S.

(The GERMAN CRowN PRINCE and his ELDEST SoN.)
The Son. Papa.
The Crown Prince. Yes, my boy, what is it?
The Son. May I ask you something about Grandpapa?
The C. P. Yes, certainly. Ask away. -
The Son. Is Grandpapa a very great man?
The C. P. Of course he is. What a very strange question
The Son. I'm sorry, Papa, that you should think it
strange. I only wanted to know, you know.
The C. P. But you must have known for yourself without
asking any questions that Grandpapa was the German ||
Kaiser, and that therefore unquestionably he must be a
very great man indeed. -
The Son. Then is he a great man because he is a Kaiser,
or is he a Kaiser because he is a great man 2
The C. P. Understand me, he is a great man because he
is a Kaiser, but that does not mean that he wouldn't have
been a great man if he hadn't been a Kaiser. I am far
from saying that.
The Som. Yes, Papa, I think I understand. A man who
is Kaiser must be greater than when he wasn't a Kaiser.
The C. P. Y-e-s, that 's about it.
The Son. Oh, Papa, isn't it delightful to think that you
will some day, when you are Kaiser, be a really great man!
The C. P. I forbid you to speak of things like that.
The Son. And afterwards I shall be Kaiser, too, and then
I shall be a really great man.
The C. P. (to himself). Who has been putting ideas into
this child's head 2 (Aloud) You had better run away and
play now. I can't stop here all day answering your foolish
questions.
The Son. No, Papa, of course you can't, and I don't
expect it, but just a question here and there can't do any
harm, and I have done my drilling for to-day.
The C. P. There must be more of that drilling to keep
you from idleness. It's absurd to have a great boy like
you kicking your heels about the Palace. (A pause.)
The Son. Papa.
The C. P. Well ? -
The Son. I didn't know that great men are ever angry |
—at least I didn't know it till this morning.
... The C. P. Oh, didn't you? You can't know everything
all at once. . -
The Son. No, Papa, I'm afraid I can't. But this morning
Grandpapa was very angry with the Generals.
The C. P. Was he ” And you were listening, I suppose.
The Son. He spoke so loud I couldn't help hearing him.
And he said some terrible words, too—oh, yes, terrible. I
thought the Generals were going to cry.
The C. P. You must remember that Grandpapa has a
great many enemies.
The Son. Then that is all right for him, because he can
love them all, and the more he has the more he can love.
The C. P. Who has been stuffing your mind with all this
nonsense? -
The Son. Oh, Papa, you mustn't talk like that. It was
Dr. Dryander who preached a sermon and told us that
good men must learn to love their enemies, otherwise
things would not go well with them. -
. The C. P. (to himself). If this sort of thing goes on I
shall have to put old Dryander in his place. I can't have
him poisoning the boy's mind. (Aloud) I'm sure Dr.
Dryander could not have said that. You have not remem-
bered rightly.
The Son. Oh, yes, I have remembered rightly. I was
very much surprised to hear him say such things. But
perhaps if Grandpapa does not love his enemies it is because
he is so great a man. Great men needn't be good.
The C. P. Who said that 2
The Son. I said it myself, Papa.
The C. P. Then such a clever boy must have an hour of
extra drill. So run away and report yourself to the drill-
instructor.
The Son. Yes, Papa. But I shan't love him, you know.
The C. P. Who wants you to? All you need do is to
obey his orders.
The Son. But he is my enemy.
The C. P. Rubbish. Be off with you.

XLIV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, You will be
breathlessly awaiting the narrative of
your special correspondent at or very
near the Front. I will give you in the
approved manner of special correspon-
| -
dents the pen-picture of what I saw,
trying to select such words and phrases
as will convey to you the tremendous-
ness, the vast size, the enormous pro-
portions and the gigantic dimensions
of the fateful conflict which I myself
was privileged to watch. In describ-
ing it as I saw it I hope I shall strike
the fashionable note, even if I leave
you in some doubt as to whether it
was I who was privileged to see the
battle or the battle which was privi-
leged to be seen by me.
Picture to yourself the Department
of the Somme as you once knew it,
with its wide, open rolling stretches of
country and all its habitations and
buildings gathered into the little vil-
lages. It was upon a ridge of that
country (quantum mutatus ab illo!) that
I took my stand shortly after midnight
and waited for what was about to be.
I felt isolated from the civilised world
and solitary ; I could have wished that
there had been more people about to
occurring in the less fateful West.

It was a unique dawn which we wit-
nessed, the fateful sun rising in the
fateful East, and nothing particular
All
was quiet, only an occasional small
bird stepping forth to sing its morning
ditty and not taking such care with its
technique as it would have done if it
had been aware that I (amongst others)
was listening and making a note of it.
Suddenly the appointed hour arrived;
the great guns spoke. I do not mean
that I and my fellow-correspondents said
anything; it was the actual guns that
spoke, some with a bang, some with a
crash and others with a loud detonation.
I had the sensation of a tremendous roar-
ing in my ears, of a huge mass of rest-
less turbulence all about me. Phrases at
once suggested themselves. “Thunder
of battle " I dismissed as hackneyed.
“Cataclysm of human fury” I reserved
for a later phase. “Din of doom" has a
Staff Officer. “No 1"
Staff Officer. “NO!”
A gun is a wonderful thing. One sees
a huge metal tube on wheels managed
by small human beings on legs. One
day it sits idle on its emplacement, like
some great monster stretching its vari-
coloured trunk in the sun. So innocent
and amenable is it then that the gunner
will prop his shaving-mirror upon it
and place his lather-brush temporarily
in the muzzle as he manipulates the
razor over his simple, resolute, cheerful
face. Anon it will be a thing of fiery
action, vibrant with hate, ruthlessly,
relentlessly destructive, spitting fire and
belching death, two habits which are
quite permissible in a gun. From that
muzzle, where the lather-brush once so
peacefully reposed now pour shells,
shells, shells. How they barked, those
guns! How the guns spoke' Nay
more, they shouted at the top of their
voices. However, we had been supplied
with cotton-wool to put into our ears,
so no great harm was done.
And so the battle went on, and so
snap to it. I might quote the words of the fate of nations was put in the

was the difference of course that the

Heaven, and our fellows made their

There were times when they were

[JULY 19, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS.
I ought to preface this story by say-
ing that I am a very innocent person.
My nature is an unsuspicious one—or,
at any rate, it used to be.
Whether it will be so in future is a
question, for I have had a baptism of
cynicism. But let me tell you about it.
I had dropped into the great Green
Cross Sale at Gristie's when D'Arcy
Williams came up and stood beside me.
D'Arcy Williams is a man about town
who knows all. -
While we were talking a signed photo-
graph of a Royal Personage was put up
for sale, and almost immediately a voice
rang out, “One hundred pounds!"
A rustle ran round the room, and all
eyes were turned towards the bidder.
“Hullo!” said D'Arcy Williams,
“that's Sir Gorgius Midas.”
“One hundred and five,” said another
voice.
“One hundred and ten,” said Sir
Gorgius instantly.
“One hundred and fifteen,” said the
other.
“Hullo!” said D'Arcy Williams," now
there'll be some fun.”
“Why?” I asked.
“Because,” he replied, “the other
bidder is Sir Jacobus Thruster, and he
and Midas are horribly jealous of each
other. Now that they've begun they'll
never leave it. It'll be as good as a play,
mark my words. Why go to the theatre
when one can see two mouveaua riches
getting to grips?"
The bidding rose steadily.
“One hundred and forty pounds,”
said Sir Gorgius.
“And five,” said Sir Jacobus.
“One hundred and fifty,” said Sir
Gorgius.
“And five,” said Sir Jacobus.
Interest was centred in the two
protagonists. They were very much
alike. Each had a grey suit, with a
white slip and white spats and a tall
hat. It is, I suppose, a kind of finan-
ciers' uniform, and I always wonder
who thought of it first. Each looked
over-nourished; the hall - marks of
heavy lunches were stamped on their
plethoric features. Each had long
passed the roaring forties and was ap-
proaching the uric sixties. They paid
no attention to each other, but bid quite
automatically, in perfect detachment
but full also of purpose.
“Two hundred,” said Sir Gorgius.
“And ten,” said Sir Jacobus.
The thing had become intensely
dramatic, as, of course, a sale by auction
can be. STEvenson knew this, and so
did GABor1AU. The whole room was
merely a background for the two rivals.
It was, in fact, a duel.
The bidding rose to four hundred
and ninety when, instead of saying
five hundred, Sir Gorgius, by a master
stroke of daring, shouted, “A thou-
sand.”
“And fifty,” said Sir Jacobus, with-
out moving any muscle but those of
his lips.
“Eleven hundred,” said Sir Gorgius.
“And fifty,” said Sir Jacobus.
We drew nearer to them. Not a
sound was heard but the bids. And so
for a tense hour it went on, during
which five figures were reached.
And then suddenly—so suddenly
that a number of persons were seriously
upset and one lady fainted—Sir Jacobus
had a fit. Sir Gorgius had just bid
twenty thousand pounds, when, without
any warning, Sir Jacobus fell gurgling
to the ground. It sounded almost as if
his gurgles were an effort to pronounce
another bid, but to that neither I nor
any one else present can swear. The
facts are that Sir Gorgius had just bid
twenty thousand and that Sir Jacobus
collapsed. He was at once borne from
the room.
The auctioneer was concerned but
professional. “Any advance on twenty
thousand 2 " he asked.
“Ought we not to postpone the
sale until Sir Jacobus recovers ?" Sir
Gorgius asked. “I should not like to
take advantage of his indisposition.”
“I don't think so,” said the
auctioneer.
“But he made an attempt to bid,”
Sir Gorgius, who, it seemed to me,
was a little anxious, insisted.
“I think yours may fairly be con-
sidered the last bid, Sir Gorgius,”
said the auctioneer, dropping his
hammer. “I congratulate you, Sir,
on your public spirit,” and then all
applauded.
And that is how the Greon Cross
benefited to the extent of twenty
thousand pounds by the sale of a
signed photograph.
A few days later I met D'Arcy Wil-
liams in a restaurant.
“Well,” I said, “that was a very
thrilling experience that we had at
Gristie's. I hope Sir Jacobus has
recovered.” -
“Recovered ?” he said. “From what?”
“From his fit.”
“Bless your soul, he didn't have a
fit. He saw that the pace was getting
too hot and he retired gracefully.”
“Do you mean to say ?” I began.
“Of course I do. Sir Jacobus Thrus-
ter wasn't born yesterday. The thing
was getting beyond a joke.”
“Do you mean to tell me—?” I
began again.
“Of course I do,” he repeated. “What
else could be done? It was just a
question of who thought of it first.
Sir Jacobus did, because he is a newer
knight than Sir Gorgius; he hasn't
had so long to become old and crusted.
And he's full of resources too—made
his money in South Africa, you know.”
For the third time I began, “Do you
mean to 2 ”
“Oh, do please be sensible. When the
irresistible force meets the immovable
object—what then 2 Well, obviously,
as I say, there had to be a diversion.
Otherwise one or the other must have
become bankrupt. No doubt Sir Gorgius
is pretty sick that he hadn't the pres-
ence of mind that Sir Jacobus had ; but
he ought to be very glad, too, to have
got off so cheaply.” -
“Good heavens!” I said. And though
a week and more has passed it is still
my only comment.
So now you see why I am less inno-
cent than I was before the Sale.
In a Good Cause.
By the kindness of Sir Thomas
BEECHAM, the proceeds of the first
performance of the Russian National
Opera, A Life for the Tsar, to be given
at the Aldwych Theatre on Monday,
July 24th, will be devoted to the assist-
ance of the six orphan children of Señor
GRANADos, who, with his wife, was
drowned when the passenger steamer,
Susser, was torpedoed by a German
submarine. This act of murder, which
the German Admiralty at first denied
and then were compelled to admit,
caused a strong outburst of anti-Ger-
man feeling in Spain. Señor GRANADos
was at the time returning from New
York, where the brilliant success of
his opera, Las Goyescas, had seemed to
assure his artistic future.

We understand from those present at

of the young aviator who brought down
IMMELMANN was a little too “official'; in
tone, but I suspect it will be appreciated
by the officer in question, who belongs
to a corps “which does not advertise.”
Wednesday, July 12th.-Hardly had
Lord HALDANE opened his mouth to
call attention to the training of the
nation when the Duke of BUCCLEUCH
jumped up with the suggestion that the
Noble Wiscount should begin by ex-
plaining how he came to mislead Great
Britain on the German danger. In
the strict sense of the word this was
impertinent, yet I fear it expressed the
opinion of more than one of the attend-
ant peers.
It takes more than a duke, however,
to knock Lord HALDANE off his ora-
torical perch, and he proceeded, very
little perturbed, to deliver his famous
lecture on the defects of British edu-
cation. Patience rather than enthusi-
asm marked the demeanour of the
audience, and though Lord CROMER and
Lord BRYCE gave a general support
to the lecturer neither of them was
prepared to admit, in the face of what
this country had accomplished, that
British education was so far behind
that of Germany as he had suggested.
In the course of yesterday's debate
Lord PEEL let fall the remark that in
the Irish negotiations Sir Edward
CARSoN had acted rather as an Ulster
leader than as a British statesman.
Whether Sir Edward took this as a
compliment or otherwise I do not
know; but at any rate, although on
the 12th of July he might have been
expected to emphasize the Ulster side
of his dual personality, he was very
much the British statesman, and quite
took charge of the Opposition.
First he attacked the PRIME MIN-
ISTER for his reticence in regard to
the Mesopotamian operations, and
announced his intention of bringing
the Government to book next week if
they did not make full disclosure.
Next he accused them of dilatoriness
in tackling the question of Parlia-
mentary registration. Then, changing
his tone, he chaffed them genially
over the blunder which had necessi-
tated the introduction of a Bill to save
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE (and, as it turns out,
the ATToRNEY-GENERAL as well) from
the pains and penalties of the Statute
of ANNE. Finally, with the help of
Mr. CHURCHILL (who was taking a
brief respite from his journalistic
labours) he succeeded in inducing the
CHANCELLOR of the ExchEQUER to
re-consider his proposal to tax insur-
ance-premiums.
Thursday, July 13th.-Mr. REDMOND
is not among those Members who com-
plain that the PRIME MINISTER's state-
ment on Ireland was not clear enough.
He greatly prefers the nebulous ob-
scurity of Mr. Asquith's original sketch
to the sharp outlines of Lord LANs-
Down E's more finished drawing.
In the absence of the PRIME MINISTER,
Mr. BonAR LAw made no attempt to
dispose of Mr. REDMOND's bombshell;
and Mr. Asquith, when at last he
arrived, explained that he had been busy
with missiles of a more urgent kind,
and announced that munition-workers
would be asked to defer their promised
holidays in August in order that their
brothers at the Front might continue
to batter the Hun.
The Re-election of Ministers Bill
passed through all its remaining stages,
though not without a good deal of
opposition from below the Gangway,
where the prospect of the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL being mulcted in penalties of
£130,000 appeared to give unholy joy.
When the division was taken, however,
the friends of the common informer
mysteriously melted away, and Mr.
Hogg|E and Mr. WATT, self-named as
their tellers, found that the “Noes"
were left in a minority of nought.

IN tranquil mid-Victorian days, the days when I was young,
With meritorious landscapes the drawing-room was hung;
There were Landseers in abundance, in all his moods and

And photographic albums and gift-books richly bound
In calf upon the tables were generally found.
The furniture was massive; there was a Broadwood grand,
And BEETHoveN's sonatas upon the music-stand.
It was, in fine, a serious place, our fathers' drawing-room,
Decorous and impressive, but not devoid of gloom;
And no one was admitted till day was on the wane,
Except my schoolgirl sisters, Amelia and Jane;
They went there in the morning to practise at their scales,
Instructed by a mistress who rapped their finger-nails.
Tea was a solemn function, when visitors were there,
And we were sometimes summoned, dressed with especial
Care,
For we were not entirely forbidden to intrude
Upon those sacred precincts or utterly tabooed.
Here too on great occasions, when guests were entertained,
While at their port and walnuts the gentlemen remained,
The ladies talked of babies, and each extolled her brood
Until their lords rejoined them, mellowed by wine and food.
And then some hapless damsel would warble to the harp,
But, whether she was tuneful or sang a trifle sharp,
It really didn't matter, for everybody talked
And only talked the louder the louder that she squawked.
But oh! what wondrous changes in fashion's curious code
Are seen in mid-Victorian sobriety's abode
The meritorious landscapes and portraits all have gone,
And LANDSEER's stags and gillies yield to AUGUSTU's JoHN.

There's still a grand piano, but it isn't played by hand,
And only rag-time records adorn the music-stand.
The chairs, unlike the pictures, don't ask you to sit up,
And they're fitted with attachments for ash-tray or for cup.
In short, the old apartment, once as cheerless as a tomb,
Is changed into a mixture of lounge and smoking-room.

Roy wandered slowly down the
village street, ginger-coloured and dis-
consolate. Some curious thing called
“War” had snatched away his jolly
young master to a place called Egypt.
Opposite the Village Institute, which
was now called a “Hospital,” he stood
still to ponder. Suddenly a voice hailed
him, “Hullo, old sport, what's up with
you?" and he saw a group of men en-
tering the gateway. Roy was surprised
to see so many men so tired, and they
walked so slowly; perhaps they were
lonely too.
He followed them. At the door he
was met by a smell of aggressive cleanli-

If the authors of The Wind's Will (CAssELL) had been
able to keep up the captivating charm of its opening pages,
I think I should have put it among the most delight-
ful romances that ever I read. And even though there
happened inevitably some little decline from the first
buoyancy, it remains a most fragrant and happy tale, the
best thing certainly, to my mind, that AGNEs and EGERTON
CASTLE have yet given us. The scene of it is Paris, after
Waterloo, and the protagonists are Captain Geoffrey Swifte
(later, through unlooked for bereavements, my Lord Maldon),
his proud and calculating cousin, Augusta, and Colinette, the
peasant daughter of a flower farm at St. Cloud. Add to
these Augusta's chosen suitor, Sir John Armeston, and a
delightful young-hearted old lady, the Dowager Lady Maldon,
and you have not only the entire cast, but also, to an experi-
enced reader, the plot as well. At first I thought to myself
what a jolly costume-comedy the book would make. But
then again I thought no, seeing that the material of it is
not so new but that, removed from the fresh breeze that
blows through the telling, it might show a considerable
deal of dust. But that wind, and the scent and movement
and frolic of it, constitute nothing less than a triumph for
the clever authors, upon which (holding on to my hat the
while) I make them my best congratulatory bow.
Of the European publicists whom the War has made
familiar to English readers, the name of no one carries
more authority than that of Dr. E. J. DILLON. Therefore
such a volume as he has just issued, Ourselves and Germany
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), is certain beforehand of a large and
attentive audience. Moreover, Dr. DILLON has had the
good wit to secure for his book an introduction by the Man
of the Moment—need I explain that this means Mr. W. M.
HUGHES 2 Short, trenchant and admirably expressed, this
brief appreciation by the Prime Minister of Australia is by
no means the least valuable part of a remarkable book.
Dr. DILLON, of course, writes about the affairs of Europe
with the authority of intimate and personal contact. As
Mr. HUGHEs well says, he “knows those who lead the
warring nations in this titanic conflict very much better
than ordinary men know their own townsmen.” And
because of this knowledge he has many things to say that
will perhaps startle some of us, even now, to hear. He is
no prophet of smooth things. In particular, the craft of
the enemy, his strength and his tremendous driving power
towards a long-planned end, are all fully understood by the
writer. Read his story of the years of German foundation-
laying. Read the chapters upon past and present Italian
policy. It may be—indeed it is inevitable—that not every-
one will agree with all the writer's deductions; but no one
can deny that his book is a profoundly stimulating one, if
only (again to quote Mr. HUGHES) as “keying all men to a
sense of the great events in which we are taking part.”
It is rare enough to meet in a modern novel a group
consisting entirely of quiet pleasant people; much rarer,
it would seem, than in real life, which is nothing like so
drab as it is now commonly painted; rare enough indeed
to be something of a treat. Contrary Mary (DUCKworTH),
by TEMPLE BAILEY, contrives this air of general goodwill
without being too dull. Mary is a nice young thing of

Having done his duty in these matters the candid friend
could then begin to refer to the characterisation of the
author's people, not one of whom is the least bit a peg on
which to hang an atmosphere, and to the easy simplicity
with which she contrives to create that satisfying im-
pression of a South Africa as it really is which one has
always associated with her work. One feels of all her
characters, not only the Bywommer himself, the “poor-
white ” no-good Englishman, but of his son and ill-fated
daughter and of everybody in the little circle whose lives
they touch, that a real person is being renewed, not
manufactured, in these pages; and this in a setting of

THE ARCH-PRIEST.
THRICE welcome, KAISER, to the battle's rear,
Where, from a shell-proof distance, you propose
With clarion lungs to breathe celestial cheer
Into an army battered by its foes; .
For we have proved that, just when you expect
To duplicate the weary Hun's endeavour,
Your presence has the opposite effect
And things go worse than ever.
Nor do we fear your fancy's latest flight,
When, with a travelling pulpit for a perch,
You teach your chaplains (dressing by the right)
The doctrines of a Prusso-Christian Church ;
Showing, by your own pure ideal of war
Where love alone must triumph, how the Sermon
Preached on the Mount might well be taken for
The utterance of a German.
“The devil was sick; the devil a monk would be ;”
But till he felt that horrid ache inside
He took no interest in the rosary
Or knotted cords to corrugate his hide;
So, while in Belgium's innocent blood you trod
And of her temples made a heap of rubble,
The need to make your peace some day with God
Gave you no sort of trouble.
Now you repent and take a pious dope,
And give your bands a rest from hymns of hate,
And bid your priests renew their faith and hope,
And all in saintly language—two years late;
For God, remembering, turns His face away
From lips that with their high vows loosely palter,
Nor takes from unclean hands the gift they lay
Upon His holy altar, O. S
HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.

TURKEY.) -
Ferdinand. Yes, there's no doubt of it, MEHMED, old
man, things are looking very queer.
The Sultan. Oh, don't say that, FERDINAND. You can't
have a notion how uncomfortable you make me feel.
Ferdinand. Well, you can figure it out for yourself. It
isn't my saying so that makes things queer; it's the things
themselves that are queer, and you and I may just as well
realise it while there's time.
The Sultan. Oh dear, oh dear, what shall we do 2 Do
you think it's any good having a word with FRANCIs Joseph
or the German All-Highest ? They might be able to sug-
gest something. - -
Ferdinand. Not they. They've got their hands as full
as they can hold. As for FRANCIs Joseph, he's absolutely
dead to the world, and everybody except himself knows it.
You can't keep on losing I don't know how many thousands
of prisoners and hundreds of guns and miles and miles of
territory, and then ask people to believe that you're doing
it all because you want to, and because that's the new
patent way of winning battles. People are mostly fools,
but they're not such fools as all that, you know.
The Sultan. But there's our friend WILLIAM. He might
help. Certainly he was full of promises when he got us to
join in. Turkey was to have all her ancient splendour;
the Russians were to be smashed into pulp; and Turkey
and Germany were to be the arbiters of the world.
Ferdinand. Funny, isn't it? That's exactly what he
said to me, changing the word “Turkey" for the word
“Bulgaria.” - -
The Sultan. And what have I got out of it? Not a thing
except hard knocks everywhere and the privilege of looking
after those two rotten German ships, the Goeben and the
Breslau. I could have built a new palace for the money
they've cost me in repairs alone. Every time they put
out they get a smashing. I'm getting tired of the whole
business.
Ferdinand. So am I, but I don't see any way out of it
just yet. Do you ?
The Sultan. No, I don't—unless I could manage to get rid
of ENVER. Of course I might order him off to Armenia, but
I doubt if he'd go. He doesn't seem to like the Russians.
Ferdinand. Well, we've all got our dislikes. I myself
don't much like the French and English.
The Sultan. And I don't like the Germans.
Ferdinand. Oh, as for them, nobody likes them.
The Sultan. No; some of us were afraid of them, that's all.
Ferdimand. And now we're not even afraid of them,
are we?
The Sultan. Not a bit.
Ferdinand. Well then, if we both feel like that, let's get
out of it. Let's tell old FRANCIs Joseph and WILLIAM
that we've changed our minds.
The Sultan. Yes, let's. *
Ferdinand. Very well. There's no time like the present.
The Sultan. No, none. Will you write?
Ferdinand. I think on the whole it would come better
from you. It wouldn't sound so harsh in Turkish.
The Sultan. I rather thought they'd take it more kindly
if it came in Bulgarian. WILLIAM 's a very angry man,
anyhow.
Ferdinand. Yes, doesn't he try to shout people down. I
can't bear these blustering fellows; and he's always so
religious, too.
The Sultan. That's no good with me, and he knows it.
Ferdinand. Why should we write at all? Let's just
gradually do it.
The Sultan. Do what ?
Ferdinand. Get out of our alliance with him. We can't
be worse off with the other lot, can we ?
The Sultan. No, and we might be much better.
Ferdinand. It'll make things highly unpleasant for
WILLIAM, but he's only got himself to thank for that.
The Sultan. Yes; he oughtn't to have tried to deceive us.
“Dr. Ohnesorg'': an Explanation.
This name, which recently appeared in one of Mr.
Punch's “Heart-to-Heart Talks,” was a pure invention
of the author. The contents of the article abundantly
prove that the Ohnesorg who appears there—a brutal
German inspector of prisoners' camps—could not possibly
be intended for the American doctor of the same name who
has done notable service in the cause of British prisoners.
But in case there has been among Americans any misappre-
hension as to the author's intentions, Mr. Punch desires
to express his regret for this strange coincidence, and to
hope that the real Dr. OHNESORG has treated it with the
insouciance which is indicated by his name.
“The recent cool weather is attributed largely to the excellent
bill of health of the city.”—Birmingham Daily Mail.
Still, it seems a little hard that London should freeze in
order that Birmingham may flourish.
“The Danish story of German naval activity in the Baltic is likely
enough; let us hope that British submarines are at the bottom of it.”

We hope so too; but not permanently.

“I THINK it's so wonderful,” said
Mrs. Mincingham ecstatically, “to find

but you see what I mean, don't you?—
such—such love of art and all that,

Mrs. Mincingham's men, I must
explain, were hers temporarily,
like commissions, because she had
invited them to tea from the neigh-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HALFPENNY IN THE BASIN.
MY khaki was new and the sun
shone. In the heart of the country
town where I am stationed there was to
be a garden fête in aid of an hitherto
overlooked charity. Obviously it was
my duty—part of my “bit” as it were—
to shave, shine and polish and take my
swagger cane out for a treat.
I am a new soldier and have hitherto
been just a dramatist—a poor sort for
discipline at any time. Hence my
earnestness overleaps my knowledge
of rules. I am all for the right thing,
but lamentably apt in the execution of
military howlers. Isalute bandmasters,
deceived by their mackintoshes; I have
actually raised my forage - cap to a
padre; and I forget to take my pipe
from my mouth when this row with
the Germans necessitates that the pipe
should be taken from the mouth. I
shall improve, but it is necessary for
the proper appreciation of this story
that my rawness should be propounded.
The locale of the fête was a deanery
garden. Trees that shed leaves on the
leathern clothing of ALFRED THE GREAT
and lawns that suggested the first game
of cricket formed the foreground to a
long house that shone with bright age.
Near the end of the long house was a
little gate. Inside the little gate was
the fête—cocoanuts, a string band, a
palmist and a game called “Halfpenny
in the basin.” I did not go in. It
was not one of my “halfpenny in the
basin" days. -
Under the oldest tree, with the most
ugly faces upon it, I sat and pretended
to ponder upon plots for plays. Now
and then people passed me by and
went into the fête, and as each one
came I wagered with myself as to their
capacity for throwing a halfpenny into
a basin. Then came a Colonel on a
charger.
“I say, you chap,” he began, “do
you mind holding my horse for me for
a few minutes ?”
“With pleasure, Sir.”
“I promised to go to this beastly
fête, so I suppose I must look in.
Thank you very much.”
I took hold of the thing that goes
through the horse's mouth and round
the top, and tried to look like a pro-
| fessional horse-holder. The Colonel
assured me that he wouldn't be long,
that his name was Tommy—i.e. the
| horse's name—that he was quite docile
and fond of grass. He winked as he
| said this and indicated the lawn, but
| with a don't-say-I-Said-so manner. I
| winked back as I imagine horse-holders
| wink, and in a moment Tommy and I
| were alone.
When I look back I see no reason
to reproach myself. The Colonel had
said in the horse's hearing that the
horse was to be allowed to have grass,
and that seemed to settle the matter.
Lawns may be lawns but the army is
something more. It is the Army.
So on to the lawn did Tommy go.
I don't think he could have had any-
thing to eat before, and the animal's
simple enjoyment of his novelexperience
was most infectious. When he rooted
up the divots, if I may so express
myself, swallowed the bits he wanted
and chucked the rest away, I laughed
in sheer lightness of spirit. I would
have lit my pipe too, if I had not been
in honour bound to hold on to the
thing you hold horses with.
I got Tommy at 3 P.M. At 4.30 the
Dean came out. His face was like a
bonfire that won't light.
“Must you really take your horse
on my lawn, Sir?” Here was I, bless
you, taken for a Cavalryman. “Must
you, Sir? Is it absolutely necessary?”
I said that he wasn't my horse, that
I had only met him that afternoon,
that I didn't know who he belonged to,
that he was fond of grass, but I wasn't
to say anybody said so.
The Dean shook. I nearly offered
him my swagger cane for the purpose
of getting a grip on something.
“Tell me whose horse this is, if you
please.”
“I will do my best,” I replied with
a little asperity.
His appearance is likeable. He would
look very well on a bride's left. A
heavyish man with a light smile and
the kind of hair that you can't stop
elderly actors from wearing.”
“Where is he now 2"
“He is in your back garden, probably
throwing half-pennies in a basin.”
The Dean wheeled away, not on the
right heel and left toe, as I somewhat
regretfully noticed.
Certainly the lawn had been roughly
savaged by the insatiable Tommy.
About one-third of it wasn't a lawn at
all now. I felt dimly that I was
blameworthy, but not for long. Sud-
denly there arrived the consciousness
that all this pleasaunce should now
be potatoes. Tommy and I had been
doing the work of the War Economy
poster
Still, Deans are Deans, and I took
Tommy to the borders where the grass
was long. He ate more enthusiastically
than ever.
At five o'clock Tommy went down
on his knees.
I had never seen a horse do this before,
and made up my mind to buy heaps
of grass after the War and give it to
hungry chargers. Probably if the
Colonel knew how much his spirited

All out of sheer gratitude, I know, but
it is terrible that these animals should
have to lie on their backs and put their
feet in the air to express their thanks.
Couldn't they be trained to cross their
feet or paw the lawn or something
simple in such circumstances 2
Considerable disturbance was caused
to the animal's equipment. The saddle
came round, doubtless thinking that
its place was on top, and relying on
its owner's sense of justice to recog-
nise that it was the horse that was
out of position. Things started to
hang down which looked as if they
ought not to hang down, and I had
a sense of impending objurgations.
They came. The Colonel, looking
more than ever like a father-in-law,
came from the gate in the company of
the Dean and told me what he thought
of me as a horse-holder, little appre-
ciating that I thoroughly agreed with
him. He then made queer noises with
his mouth, which I’m sure I shall
never learn, and Tommy stood up.
The Dean tried hard to look as if he
could have done it himself. I was
meek and did up the straps. This
I can do splendidly, in view of long
training as a husband. When I'd
finished with my side the horse couldn't
possibly become undone.

I was given twopence for a drink,
four half-pennies. Each one missed
the basin—largely because the Dean
was looking on. But perhaps there's
a one-Act play in it.
About there he went over,

THE FIGURE-HEAD.
A SALT SEA YARN.
THERE was an ancient carver that carved of a saint,
But the parson wouldn't have it, so he took a pot of paint
And changed its angel garment for a dashing soldier rig,
And said it was a figure-head and sold it to a brig.
The brig hauled her mainsail to an off-shore draught,
Then she shook her snowy royals and the Scillies went
abaft ;
And cloudy with her canvas she ran before the Trade
Till she got to the Equator, where she struck a merry-
maid.
A string of pearls and conches were all of her togs,
But the flying-fish and porpoises they followed her like
dogs;
She had a voice of silver and lips of coral red,
She climbed the dolphin-striker and kissed the figure-head.
Then every starry evening she'd swim in the foam
About the bows, a-singing like a nightingale at Home;
She'd call to him and sing to him as sweetly as a bird,
But the wooden-headed effigy he never said a word.
And every starry evening in the Doldrum calms
She'd wriggle up the bobstay and throw her tender arms
About his scarlet shoulders and fondle him and cry
And stroke his curly whiskers, but he never winked an eye.
She couldn't get an answer to her tears or moans,
So she went and told her daddy, told the ancient Davy
Jones; -
Old Davy damned his eyesight and puzzled of his wits,
Then whistled up his hurricanes and tore the brig to bits.
Down on the ocean-bed, green fathoms deep,
Where the wrecks lie rotting and great sea-serpents creep,
In a gleaming grotto all built of sailors' bones,
Sits the handsome figure-head, listening to Miss Jones.
Songs o' love she sings him the livelong day,
And she hangs upon his bosom and sobs the night away,
But he never, never answers, for beneath his soldier paint
The wooden-headed lunatic still thinks that he's a saint.
Mr. Weedon Grossmith’s Hamlet.
In a recent issue of Punch an examination paper was set
to budding playwrights, and one of the problems was :
“Adapt the Third Act of Hamlet so as to render it a suit-
able medium for the personality of Mr. WEEDON GRossMITH.”
And now we remark in an evening paper, among notices of
Estates to be Sold, an advertisement which speaks (perhaps
a little too familiarly) of “The Lilies,’ forming part of the
Hamlet of Weedon.”
Mr. Punch does not want to seem captious about the
appropriation of his idea, but he is bound to say that
“The Lilies,” as a stage property, would be better adapted
to Ophelia's mad scene.

Monday, July 17th.-The gaiety of

sembled in some respects the statement
that he made last week about Ireland;
the information imparted being in in-
verse ratio to its length. One thing
was clear. The House was not to get
the papers that had been promised it
by Mr. BonAR LAw six weeks ago. So
As a rule he sits in one of the seats
under the Gallery, whence he occa-
sionally makes inarticulate interjections
in a voice “like a hairpin,” as it has
been described. But this week he has
descended at Question-time from his
remote perch and annexed one of the
of Messrs. DEVLIN and REDMONd. We many excisions had been necessary for corner seats above the Gangway. There,
still have with us the conscientious
military reasons that the documents

humourist who represents North Som-' would be, like the Irishman's coat, “a lists, not altogether shared, perhaps, by
lot of holes tied together.”

erset, and have lately regained the
services of Mr. Joseph MARTIN, who
for the last two years had left
Westminster severely alone,
and was understood to be giv-
ing the Dominion of Canada
the benefit of his statesman-
ship.
Mr. MARTIN did not, like
an even more famous “Joey,”
announce his rentrée in the
time-honoured phrase, “Here
we are again l’” but adopted
the less spectacular method of
asking a question. It was,
however, a question going
deep down to the roots of our
Imperial life. Would the PRIME

Mr. MACMASTER, also a
Canadian, furnished an answer
to the question by putting an-
other: “Was the PRIME MIN-
IsTER aware of any circum-
stances likely to put those
happy relations in any peril
whatever ?” The PRIME MIN-
IsTER was not ; so Mr. MARTIN
can, if he chooses, return to
Vancouver, B.C., with an easy
mind.
A very common Ministerial
method of disposing of inconvenient
questioners is to refer them to the reply
given to the hon. Member for So-and-so
on such-and-such a date. It is seldom
carried to so a great a length as by the
FIRST CoMMIssion ER of Works. Mr.
LYNCH wanted to know why he and
other critics of the Air-Service were
not invited to an official luncheon
recently given to the French Direction
of Aeronautics. Mr. HARcourt's re-
sponse was to read out the statement
which he made when the National
Hospitality Fund was first established,
and which deprecated, eight years in
advance, all such cavilling inquiries as
that of the hon. Member.

few dignified sentences announced that
the Government fully recognised the
feeling of the House and would bow to
its decision.
Meanwhile the House of Lords had
resumed the debate on Lord HALDANE's
motion regarding the Training of the
Nation. The Archbishop of CANTER-
BURY combatted the theory that the
older Universities did not train admin-
istrators with the remark that seven-
teen out of twenty-two members of the
Cabinet came from Oxford and Cam-
bridge. Somehow, after to-day's ex-
periences in the Commons, it did not
seem an overwhelmingly convincing
argument.
Thursday, July 20th.-Geographers
are said to have some difficulty in de-
fining the exact boundaries of Mesopo-
tamia; but the Government are quite
convinced that it is situate between the
Devil and the Deep Sea. Originally
they had intended to oppose the motion
for a Select Committee and to let the
House blow off its pent-up steam in a
fruitless debate; but at the last moment
they changed their minds and decided
to surrender at discretion.
The PRIME MINISTER announced to-
day that two Special Commissions
would be set up to inquire into the
Mesopotamian and Dardanelles Expe-
ditions. At first he proposed that to
save time these bodies should have
no compulsory powers, but he was
speedily driven from this position also,
and agreed to introduce a Bill arming
them with those powers forthwith.
Mr. CHURCHILL–his old friend, Lord
FISHER, keeping an eye on him from
over the Clock—again urged the pub-
lication of the Dardanelles papers and
received the unexpected support of Mr.
McCALLUM Scott. A wondering House
heard how the hon. Member has been
devoting all the time he could spare
from the grievances of conscientious
objectors to the study of the Dardan-
elles campaign, and has arrived at the
deliberate conclusion that CHURCHILL
was right and KITCHENER was wrong.

A REVENANT.
SoME one writing about JEREMY
BENTHAM in The New Statesman has
revived his quaint theory of the “auto-
icon" (as he calls it), or preservation
of personality after death. JEREMY's
notion was that if the features were
fixed with varnish and the body em-
balmed and re-dressed in its familiar
clothes, treated with a rubber solu-
tion, posterity would have a truer idea
of what the dead man had looked like
than any painter or sculptor could give;
while such figures, set up in a gentle-
man's grounds, would add not only to
their interest but their beauty. That
was JEREMY BENTHAM's notion, and he,
the great jurisprudentist and philoso-
pher, was, consistently, himself thus
preserved, although, according to The
New Statesman writer, his “auto-icon,”
which is one of the glories of University
College in Gower Street, is to-day in a
state of decay, and the assistance of the
wax-modeller has had to be called in.
But by a piece of odd chance I had
no sooner finished reading this article
in a club than, strolling down Picca-
dilly, I came upon an “auto-icon" so
he was, precisely as in life, in Row1AND
WARD's window. Thanks to the accu-
racy of his auto-icon he was himself.
Though dead he persisted. Old JEREMY
BENTHAM's counsels had been followed
minutely as regards that wonderful
countenance. With lavish and exotic
pigmentation the perpetuating hand of
the taxidermist had made the features
as sinister, as unwieldy and as gor-
geous as they had ever been of old in
his fearsome cage; and each individual
hair bristled as in life. The philoso-

THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND BANK.
A SEMI-FINAL VERSION.
(Being the seventh detailed Official Ac-
count issued by the German Admiralty.)
THE apparent inactivity of the Ger-
man Fleet for nearly two years—and
it is quite possible that it may again
remain apparently inactive during the
remainder of the summer—is to be ex-
plained by the extraordinary reluctance
of the enemy and by the nature of sea-
warfare, which limits the aggressive
liberty of the belligerents to occasions
when they come in contact. To find
and engage the enemy's fighting forces
has been, the first thought and final
purpose of the German Fleet. But in
this they have been thwarted, baffled
massive nineteen-inch super-guns. To
equalize this superiority Admiral voN
HIPPER (who had turned South at
4.17 P.M.) ordered an attack by five de-
stroyers. A bitter close-range battle
ensued, in which two enemy ships of
the line fell victims to our torpedoes,
and a third was seen to be appreciably
on fire. One of our destroyers was hit
and had to be abandoned by her crew
(after blowing her up). It is difficult
to say how it happened, but we must
pay without flinching the cost of offen-
sive action. The enemy was now re-
tiring at extreme speed, while our lighter
craft laboriously picked up his sur-
vivors. On the arrival of the German
Battleship Fleet Admiral BEATTY's
remaining two ships retired from the
and frustrated beyond belief. And at

this gallant onslaught against over:
whelmingly superior numbers. A small
German torpedo boat blew up. It is
thought possible that she had been hit
by something. In the haze, shortly
after 8. P.M. the enemy fleet turned in
all directions. German officers had
ample evidence of their good shooting
in the rapid destruction of enemy light

The last phase of the

dark, when the enemy,
flying at top speed in a

with our whole Fleet in

– final torpedo attack against
the West, consisting of nine ships of
the Lion class, a number of light
cruisers and some thirty modern de-
stroyers. It must be said that the
battle was fought out in an area extend-
ing over fifty nautical miles, in the
centre of the North Sea. The English
version endeavours without justification
to locate the engagement off the Jutland
coast. The reason for this deception
is clear. - - - -
Admiral voN HIPPER, approaching for
a running fight, formed line ahead and
opened fire (astern) at 2.37 P.M., at a
range of 27,000 metres, against a vastly
superior enemy. Repeated damaging
hits were at once observed on every
ship in the enemy line, and two of them
blew up and disappeared. Admiral
voN HIPPER turned North at 3.15 P.M.
About 4.5 P.M. eleven ships of the Queen
Elizabeth class, coming from the South-
East, joined Admiral BEATTY's line,
powerfully reinforcing it with their
Admiral von HIPPER turned West at
5.1 P.M. and South-East at 5.10.
About 7. P.M., with the advent of seven
squadrons of British Battleships with
their massive armament and colossal
guns, began the combat of the main
forces. At 7.2. P.M. Admiral von HIP-
PER turned round and round in circles.
It was now recognised that the British
Grand Fleet was fully assembled, and
Admiral von ScHEER determined to
attack at once against enormously
superior strength with the utmost ruth-
lessness. The Lützow had been slightly
damaged in the previous encounter,
owing to the inadvertent leaving open
of a port-hole, which had flooded the
magazine, so Admiral von HIPPER (who
began cutting figure 8's at 8.15 P.M.)
transferred his flag under a heavy fire
to the Goeben, while the Blücher tem-
porarily took the head of the line.
Three ships of the Iron Duke class
were observed to sink, heavily hit in
our ships, which were then steaming in
line ahead due South. Some hundreds
of torpedoes were fired without any re-
sult whatever, as Admiral von HIPPER
had turned sideways at 10.5 P.M. After
continuing his homeward course for
five hours Admiral von SchEER found,
when the mist lifted, that the enemy
was no longer before him. An un-
fortunate accident, due to the un-
favourable strategic position, occurred
just off Heligoland, where the Frauenlob
was seriously damaged by collision
with the Emden. A third destroyer
was found (to everyone's regret) to be
in an appreciably sinking condition.
We sustained yet another serious loss
in the old superannuated battleship,
Pommern. It was not that there was
anything the matter with her. But
she failed to return to port. Nothing
more was seen of enemy forces and
our victorious Fleet returned quietly to
its base. BIs.

life is the revolt from tradition. She has in her “a strain
of iron,” coupled with a disconcerting contempt alike for
her mother's busy futility and her sister Jane's glaring
virtues. Fortunately (or how could Miss GLAsgow have
written the book?) Gabriella, when spurred on to achieve-
ment, comes a more decisive cropper than all the rest of
her family put together. She marries a drunkard who
does not even support her, and is instantly numbered
among the unfortunates above whose prostrate bodies
: Mrs. Carr is wont to shake her head. That is galling
enough, but, when he leaves Gabriella and later succumbs
to drink, what is really a splendid and blessed thing only
appears to the home circle as an added humiliation.
Towards the end of the book Miss GLAsgow achieves a
master stroke in contrasts by depicting the return home
of Gabriella after eighteen years in New York. From
the vantage-ground of long spiritual conflict, she looks
with open eyes upon the unchanged apathy of her contem-
Northern Italy, note-book (so to say) on back. Seven of
the eleven chapters are studies of persons and places
about that most lovely of waters, the Lago di Garda. Mr.
LAwRENCE has an almost passionate sympathy with the old
Italy—you can mark it on every page—and an equally
passionate detestation of its modern commercialism, a
feeling to which we have all surrendered, more or less, in
the past; though perhaps recent history has made us some-
what modify our views upon this as upon certain other
points. Thus he is at his happiest in dealing with the
antique types, old inns and their keepers, and peasant
survivals from an earlier world. Witness that delightfully
observant study of the old padrone in the chapter called
“The Lemon Gardens.” If I have a criticism, it is that the
author is inclined to build too much moralising upon slight

TO CERTAIN GENTLEMEN OF MIDDLE AGE.
(With acknowledgments to the author of an historic
Irish Bull.)
WHEN England, roused to warrior rage,
Shook off her dreams of sloth and ease,
Forth went her men of fighting age
To do her service overseas;
But you, whom mellow years protect,
Leaving you free to take your pleasure,
Decline to let this change affect
Either your business or your leisure.
'Tis true your shoulders have to share
The burdens incident to war;
Strange extra taxes you must bear;
Your motor joy-rides cost you more;
True, Armageddon claims its price
In drinks curtailed by early closure,
But no appeal for sacrifice
Has yet impinged on your composure.
Let others work at splints and swabs,
Or guard a bridge on sentry-go;
Let such as care for navvy jobs
Entrench to fend a raiding foe;
But you—you hold yourselves excused
From chivalry that earns no wages,
Nor want your middle age confused
With manners of the Middle Ages.
So we have shirkers with us still
Who, being over forty-one,
Are eligible, if they will,
To take no part against the Hun;
And if they cannot else be moved
Save by a very sharp convulsion,
I hope a case is fairly proved
For volunteering by compulsion.
O. S.
OUR WAR-WEDDING PRESENT.
My wife's niece, Adeline, has been engaged for nearly a
year, but, her soldier-fiancé being away at the Front ever
since, their marriage seemed so remote that we had never
given a thought to the problem of what we were to give
them as a wedding present. Last week we heard that he
was coming over almost immediately for a fortnight, and
that they were to be married the day after his arrival.
This was rather short notice, but fortunately, as we then
thought, we discovered in our Stores catalogue an illus-
tration of a “Food-warmer for Table Use. Hammered
copper top. One lamp. Price 26s. 6d.,” which we decided
was as suitable an offering for a young couple as we could
reasonably afford in these times. It might, to be sure, be
a long while before they would be able to enjoy the benefit
of it; but then any gift for their joint use was open to
that objection.
As, according to my wife, it was not so very much out of
my way to Whitehall, I was deputed to go to the Stores
myself, purchase the food-warmer and order it to be for-
warded to the Rectory at once, with one of our cards, on
which she had written, “With fondest love and best wishes.”
Considering that I had faithfully executed both this
commission and another with which I had been entrusted,
I own I found it a little hard to be received by her, on
my return home that evening, with the complaint that I
really was the most hopeless person to ask to do anything.
It appeared that the food-warmer had just been delivered
at our own house, and without the card of good wishes that
should have accompanied it.
“My dear Julia,” I said, “I did all I could. I gave them
Adeline's address at the Rectory as plainly as possible. But,
after all, you've only to send the food-warmer on to her.”
“And pay the carriage myself!" she said. “But that's
not all, Peter. You forgot about ordering those things on
the list I gave you. I thought that, as there was such a
lot of them, there might be mistakes if I ordered them on
the telephone. But even that would have been better than
not getting them at all.” -
“There again,” I remonstrated, “you are too hasty,
Julia. I did not forget anything. I was rather in a hurry
to get to the office, so I handed your list to the assistant in
charge of the food-warmers, and he promised to see that it
was attended to.”
“I am sure you must have made some muddle,” she
insisted, “because they've sent the food-warmer to us—even
you can't deny that, Peter. And I shouldn't be in the least
surprised if all those articles I wanted for the home have
gone to that poor girl, with our card of best wishes!”
I pointed out that such a double mistake was highly
improbable, though the Stores were no doubt short-handed
owing to the War—which was enough to account for any
slight delay.
However, on the following evening the last post brought
a letter for Julia, which, after reading, she passed on to me
in significant silence. It was from Adeline, and as follows:
“DEAREST AUNT JULIA,-How perfectly ripping of you
and Uncle Peter to send us such loads of things, and all of
them exactly what I was longing for 1 I simply adore the
ducky little white rug, with “Bath Mat' on it in heavenly
blue letters; and so will dear Jack when he is here to see it.
And I know he will love, as I do, that most ingenious
mouse-trap and insist on taking it back with him to his
dug-out, where the rats have been such a nuisance to him,
poor darling. I daresay he sometimes has time for after-
noon tea in the trenches, and then the charming ‘anti-
incrustator' for collecting “fur' in kettles will be a real
boon and blessing. So, when he is in billets away from
the firing-line, will be the pretty little packets of bath-
mustard. It was too dear and clever of you to have
thought of all that. The dainty kitchen-shovel, the egg-
whisk and artistic scullery tidy have set me longing for the
day when I shall have a kitchen of my own to do honour
to them. As for your other delightful gifts—the tins of
powder-monkey and Harebell polish, the bars of household
soap, the box of soup squares, the divine jar of pickled
walnuts, those sweet little blacklead cubes, the bag of
tapioca-flakes, and, above all, that fascinating bottle of
horse-radish cream, they are all set out on one of the
shelves in my den, and every now and then I absolutely
have to rush upstairs to gloat over them. Altogether, I
really can't find words to express my gratitude to you and
dear Uncle Peter. If only our other wedding-presents were
as refreshingly original and unconventional as yours a e!
Would you believe it? We have already been given no
fewer than four food-warmers. All of them in hammered
copper, too !"
“Well,” I said, as I finished the letter, “Adeline seems
satisfied, anyhow" (though I couldn't help thinking she had
laid it on just a trifle thick). “So that's all right. And
all those years we've been married we've never, had a
food-warmer. Now we can keep this one, and I shall no
longer come down to breakfast and find my eggs-and-bacon
stone-cold.”
“I'm afraid,” said Julia grimly, “you will continue to
find them so, Peter, because I sent that food-warmer off
to Adeline this afternoon.”
We have not heard again from Adeline as yet. F. A.

DEAREST MAUD,-Just a line to say
I'm going down to Westbourne this
afternoon for a week or so. My ad-
dress will be Marina House, The Espla-
nade. I mean to get in some tennis.
George, who of course is over age and
still very lame from his accident last
year, is going to-night to Killarney for a
fortnight, and Baby and Nurse left early
this morning for Newquay. So much
jollier than all going to the seaside to-
gether, as people used to do in the

duck. George is positively cracked about
him and buys him the most absurdly

birthday ones. Do write to me next
week. I shall probably be feeling rather
lonely, and wondering whether my little
lamb is quite safe, though Jane is very
trustworthy. She's a great treasure.

DEAR OLD Boy, I have just heard
from Nurse again. Our darling has not
been found yet and I'm nearly demented.
It has put me so much off my game
that Alice Robinson, who is down here
too, beat me in a single this morning
6-1, 6-3, and you know that she hardly
knows one end of a racquet from the
other.
Nurse says she has proof who did it,
and says it is just like him, which
shows it was someone she knows pretty
well. And from the way she put it in
her first letter I can't be certain whether
it was the young man or Baby who was
sitting on her knee at the time. I for-
got to mention this before, through
being so upset. In fact, beyond a game
or two of tennis in the morning, listen-
ing to the band in the afternoon, and a
quiet rubber or two of bridge in the
evening, if we can get a four together,
I do nothing but mope. I do hope
your flu is better and that you will be
able to do something in the matter
soon. I would run down to Newquay
if I thought I should be of any use, but

can't, could I?

[AUGUST 2, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A REGITATION IN REST-BILLETS.
IN a way the C.O. was to blame. His
constant desire to amuse the men while
in rest-billets greatly taxed the re-
sources of the officer whose duty it
was to arrange the concerts. Briggs,
being the “Intelligence " Officer and
erroneously credited with a certain
allowance of this quality, had been en-
trusted with the re-shuffling of the
items we all knew so well. As in the
trenches the men bore the attack
bravely. They would let their pent-
up feelings burst forth in joining in the
choruses, and then applaud their own
efforts vigorously; further, should the
Chaplain not be present, a Scottish Ser-
geant would amuse them considerably,
while the officers looked up at the
ceiling. It happened that Briggs's
difficulty over the lack of fresh talent
reached the ears of our latest arrival,
one Captain Knibb, who was small
and had trouble with his eyeglass.
Approaching our little group before
luncheon on the day of the concert, he
casually observed to Briggs that if
he were short of turns he wouldn't
mind reciting something. For a
moment Briggs looked dubious; but,
after all, a cadaverous subaltern named
Byson had recited “Gunga Din" at
every concert held, and it was quite
good fun to prompt him from the
“stalls" when he broke down.
“What will you recite?”
Briggs cautiously.
“Oh! I've written a little topical
thing for the men,” replied Knibb
modestly, and we all looked grave.
On reflection I hold the opinion that
Briggs should have put his foot down
then and there, but, failing to realize
the possibilities of the situation, he
weakly said, “Good,” and was led away
to hear “the little topical thing.”
When Briggs returned we knew by
his face that the worst could be anti-
cipated.
“It's simply ghastly " he muttered
when the mess-waiter had tended him
into a state of coherence. “The men
will never stand it. It begins like an
election address, something about—
asked
‘Colonel Blankney and the boys he leads,
Ye who have fought because Belgium
bleeds'—
and yards of similar piffle.” We shud-
dered, knowing the men's sense of
humour. Still, you can't tella Captain
he's going to make an ass of himself, so
with dismal forebodings Briggs wrote,
“Captain Knibb—recitation—selected,”
on the programme, and hardly touched
his food. -
The concert began at six. It was,
as usual, packed, being held on a pay-
day, which may have accounted for the
battalion conjurer's total incompetence
and the officers' lack of enthusiasm when
he wanted to borrow a watch ; however,
since we knew that he could do the
tricks when he was all right, his exit
was triumphant. When “Gunga Din"
had been duly rendered according to
custom and B Co.'s Sergeant-Major
had illustrated with a cornet that
“Where my caravan has rested" was a
place to be avoided, and the Scottish
Sergeant had been dragged off the stage
owing to the presence of the Chaplain—
when, in fact, everything was proceed-
ing with customary smoothness, the
audience received the pleasant shock of
Briggs's announcement that a new item
would begiven: “Captain Knibb—recita-
tion—selected.” For a moment the C.O.
seemed pleased that one of his captains
should help in the entertainment, but
when Captain Knibb strolled drama-
tically on to the four-by-two stage and
bowed unctuously to his Colonel, the
latter stiffened visibly. You could have
heard the habitual pin drop, the men
seemed so determined to give him a
respectful and sporting chance. Slowly
and heavily he began—
“Colonel Blankney and the boys he leads,
Ye who have fought because Belgium
bleeds.”
This was followed by a slight pause,
during which the Captain's servant
hastily applauded, the Q.M.S. shouted,
“Order please!” and several subs
turned their profiles on the C.O. The
Chaplain seemed to scent competition.
“I speak of the “Battling Seventh's' name !
Men of imperishable fame !” .
At this point “Defaulters” sounded
jarringly outside, and several “men of
imperishable fame" left the building
hurriedly; and amidst the general dis-
order the “Battling Seventh "choked
audibly.
Growing more and more impressive
our White Hope and KIPLING's Despair
unburdened himself still further of the
result of a late supper, and louder and
louder grew the gurgling, until, as he
ended the first stanza with the terrific
climax-
“Men of the “Battling Seventh,’ charge "–
a thin voice cried, “As you were !”
and even the C.O. swung on his
moustache with both hands and rocked
helplessly.
What would have happened then
Heaven and the Staff alone know, but
in the midst of the unrestrained emotion
which now pervaded the audience an
orderly flew in and whispered, “Test
gas alarm, Sir!” to the C.O., who turned
purple and in a choked voice repeated
the order to the assembly. Never have
I seen the men so reluctant to get
into their gas-helmets, and it was with
strangled splutterings of protest that
they hurried away to “stand to.”

Indisposition has robbed us of

Photographer Lloyd George. “NicE DAY FOR A chARMING GROUP Photo, SIR, witH THIs other GENTLEMAN–A waR-TIME
study—PEACE IN THE HOME-CIRCLE-AND so FORTH.”
Monday, July 24th.-Sir Edward
CARSoN is apparently the only Irish-
man who wants Mr. LLOYD GEORGE's
scheme to go through. He is ready to
make any sacrifice—even to embrace
Mr. REDMoND on the floor of the House
—to secure Home Rule for the rest of
Ireland, provided that his own six
counties are not forced to come under
it. On the contrary, the Nationalist
leaders, though they protested with
great vigour that, as usual, Ireland had
been betrayed, are perhaps not sorry
to be relieved of the responsibility of
governing their beloved country in its
present condition.
Somehow I fancy that Mr. DILLON,
for example, much prefers the ex-
citement of denouncing with adjectival
ferocity the misdeeds of British admin-
istrators to the drudgery of correcting
those misdeeds as President of the
Irish Local Government Board. And
I am sure that LABRAs UASAL MAG
FionngAIL (né GINNELL) would feel
(like his famous countryman O'Thello)
that his occupation was gone if he
could no longer run atilt against the
windmills of the Treasury Bench.
In such brief moments as could be
spared from Irish affairs the PRIME
MINISTER proposed a Vote of Credit for
£450,000,000, and the new MINISTER
For WAR, in a cheerful survey of the
situation, paid a well-deserved tribute
to the labours of the late MINISTER of
MUNITIONS.
A fragment from Question-time:–
Mr. Hogg E.: “On what authority
does the right hon. gentleman say that
pensions are terminable?”
Mr. McKENNA (triumphantly): “Be-
cause persons are mortal.”
Mr. Hogg|E (after an interval for re-
flection): “Does that apply to the
Cabinet 2'
Tuesday, July 25th.-Lord CREwB
gave an example this afternoon of the
noble self-sacrifice of British statesmen.
Lord TEMPLETown had suggested that
Mr. HUGHES should be invited to
return from Australia in order to help
the Government in conducting the
War. Lord CREWE was most sympa-
thetic. No one knew better than him-
self how active Mr. HUGHEs had been
during his visit here. But he was
sure that the Australians wanted him
even more than we did, and therefore
he could not think of pressing him to
return.
Mr. REDMOND having intimated last
night that the Nationalists would now
feel it their duty to resume independent
criticism of the Government, there was
renewed activity, quite reminiscent of
old times, on the Irish benches to-day.
Mr. SAMUEL bore the brunt of most of
the questioning, and remained unper-
turbed even when Mr. HEALY reverted
to an impertinence worthy of his worst
days.
Not long ago Mr. Swift MAcNEILL
demanded that the Duke of CUMBER-
LAND, now in arms against us, should
be deprived of his British titles, on
the ground, inter alia, that he ought
no longer to be associated with the
county represented by MR. SPEAKER.
He now revealed the further fact that
this traitorous person takes precedence
of the Archbishop of CANTERBURY.
Unmoved by this shocking revelation
Mr. AsquitH replied that the matter
required legislation, and was not urgent;
but later on, finding the House for
once in sympathy with Mr. MAcNEILL,
he promised to purge the Peerage of
its enemy Dukes.
Wednesday, July 26th.-Royal Com-
missions, said Lord CREwe this after-
noon, resemble the River Nile, which,
after flowing with a strong and steady
current for most of its course, is dissi-
pated into a thousand channels before
it reaches the sea.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
However true this disparaging de-
scription may be it is hardly tactful
towards the PRIME MINISTER, who,
having already set up a hundred or
so of Commissions, Committees and
Courts of Inquiry, had just announced
the appointment of two more.
The Right Hon. Sir HENRY DALziel
objected to Lord GEORGE HAMILTON as
Chairman of the Mesopotamian Com-
mission, on the ground that he was in
receipt of a political pension. “We
want no Government hacks,” was the
elegant form which his objection
took. Mr. Asquith contented him-
self with rehearsing Lord GEORGE's
long and varied public services, but I
think he must begin to wonder whether
his recommendations for Privy Coun-
cillorships have been always quite
judicious.
Mr. DILLON dilated on the dilatori-
ness of Commissions, and made the
sensible suggestion that the Mesopo-
tamian Commissioners should be in-
structed to report on the medical
arrangements within two months. Mr.
Holt, fresh from championing the
cause of the conscientious objectors,
urged that the indemnity to witnesses
ought not to save incompetent officers
from sharing the fate of Admiral BYNG.
He has no objection, it would seem, to
the shedding of blood, provided that it
is not German.
Thursday, July 27th. – Until this
afternoon Sir Colin KEPPEL has had a
comparatively easy time since he be-
came Serjeant-at-Arms. But he was evi-
dently nonplussed when the SPEAKER
called upon him to remove Mr. GINNELL.
The traditional procedure on these oc-
casions is for the culprit to wait until
the Sergeant has touched him lightly
on the shoulder and then, yielding to
this technical display of force, to depart
without more ado.
Mr.GINNELL, always original, showed
no disposition to move, and Sir Colin
found his varied naval and military ex-
perience, eventhough it included shifting
“fuzzy-wuzzies" in the Soudan, of no
use to him in this emergency. If for a
moment he thought of prodding this
human hedgehog into activity with his
pretty little sword of office he quickly
abandoned the idea, and at last returned
to the SPEAKER with the intimation that
the hon. Member declined to obey his
ruling.
Here, I think, Mr. FLAVIN missed a
great chance. On a famous occasion,
in the far-off old unhappy days when
the suspension of an Irish Member was
an almost daily occurrence, he was in
the position occupied by Mr. GINNELL.
He too refused to submit to the symbol-
ical violence of the Serjeant-at-Arms
and had to be carried out kicking by six

amende for his conduct on that occa-
sion it would have been if he had now
stooped down, picked up his obstinate
colleague in his gigantic arms and
borne him forth from the House like
the naughty baby that he is.
If one gallant Admiral had to admit
defeat another scored a notable success.
In a plea for the appointment of naval
and military representatives to the new
Commissions Sir HEDworTH MEUX
pleasantly reminded Mr. Asquith that
BYNG was shot because the Prime
Minister of the day ought to have
been hanged. Mr. Asquith, with great
discretion, thereupon conceded the
point.

RUNNING REPAIRS.
As the car swerved up the drive of
“The Holmes” a small party appeared
in the doorway. Some of them wore
splints, some had crutches, and the re-
mainder were more or less restricted
in their activities by skilfully wound
bandages; but their cheerfulness was
unfailing.
“Got ‘Bunny agin,” exclaimed
one of them, indicating the small and
weedy chauffeur.
“You be careful, Swish, or 'e'll go
an' eat yer,” commented another. The
chauffeur smiled upon them as one
who knew and appreciated their idio-
syncrasies.
“Any'ow,” said a gigantic sapper,
“I shouldn't care to take on ‘Bunny'
with me left 'and tied be'ind me.” He
laughed boisterously at his own joke,
but he was the only one who did. His
right arm had been amputated at the
shoulder.
“Come on, let's git into the 'utch,”
said “Swish,” who, being a cavalry
man, entertained an extreme objection
to marking time.
They climbed in, clamouring with
the chauffeur to drive them to places
ranging from Hammersmith Broadway
to Berlin.
“Somethink like, this,” remarked
Gunner Toady as the car sped along a
green-boughed lane. His neighbour, a
monosyllabic Highlander with crutches,
did not waste even a monosyllable on
such an obvious statement, but instead
sniffed appreciatively the smell of the
raw fresh earth and made an instinctive
movement which thrust his crutches
further from him.
For some miles they drove in the
silent bliss (if you except an occasional
exchange of badinage with other way-
farers) which can only be diffused by a
summer day and six perfectly working
cylinders. Then, in a deep and nar-
row Somerset lane, the machinery, in
its usual arbitrary manner, suddenly
revolted.
The chauffeur climbed down, lifted
up the bonnet and irritated the mech-
anism with the assurance of one who
can make all things right. But the
minutes passed and nothing happened,
so “Swish" poked a splinted leg over
the footboard and cautiously descended
from the front seat.
“’Ere, you git back,” exclaimed the
diminutive chauffeur, trying to look
fierce. “You know you ain't allowed
out 'ere.”
“Swish " patted him affectionately
on the back and dipped his hands into
the machinery.
“Wonderful what a knowledge of
machinery one gits 'anging round the
º waggons."
The one-armed sapper spoke to the
blue heavens, and “Swish " breathed
deeply and hit something with a span-
ner. The chauffeur danced with ap-
prehension.
“’Ere, take 'im away, some of you,”
he cried.
It was a rash invitation and was
answered with unexpected celerity.
Everybody except the Highlander va-
cated the car and proceeded to relieve
“Swish” of his command by the simple
expedient of taking it over himself. In
a few minutes a varied assortment of
caps and blue jackets were scattered
about and every available tool was
either in use or about to be. The
Highlander could endure it no longer;
casting his crutches into the road he
“joined up,” asserting that “his brither
Donal’ drove a trolley-car in Dundee.”
The rightful chauffeur of the car
threw a despairing glance at his

exuberant charges and the raffle lying
round about. He wondered vaguely
whether he ought to fetch a policeman,
and if, when fetched, he would turn
out to be another expert in machinery.
Then a car slid slowly round the
corner and came to a standstill because
it had no choice in the matter.
And behold a miracle happened
The sapper snatched up his coat
and leapt for the footboard; “Swish”
hopped valiantly and regardless of pain
into the front seat; the remainder
downed tools and made a combined
rush; only the Highlander was left
behind, groping frantically for his
crutches. The chauffeur handed them
to him in mute astonishment. Then
he turned and became aware that
a small alert-looking woman haſ
descended from the other car. She
advanced fearlessly and pointed an ac-
cusing finger at what might have been
a band of children caught raiding the
store-cupboard. Her words were few
and simple, and, to the further astonish-
ment of the chauffeur, did not draw
forth a single retort. It was entirely
contrary to his own experience.
With the aid of the other driver the
car was at last successfully readjusted,
but it was not until the accursed spot
had been left far behind that the deep
and enduring silence of the party was
broken by “Swish,” who remarked
thoughtfully to no one in particular,
“Fancy meetin' Sister in that there
blighted wilderness!” and then, ad-
dressing himself solely to the still
indignant man at the wheel, added,
“Next time you pulls the wrong'andle
you’ll 'ave to mend the 'ole tin can
yourself. We ain't goin' to 'elp yer.”
The chauffeur opened his mouth to
reply, but closed it again for want of
an adequate repartee.
THE REVUE FORMUL.A.
SoME day, said a philosopher, all
things will be made clear to us. That
is good news. Among the questions I
shall then ask is this—Why is it that
the Press is unanimous in the decision
that the present craze for revue is
detrimental to the best interests both
of the stage and the music-hall, and
yet it hails each new revue as an
addition to the gaiety and delight of
the multitudes?
Most forms of journalism can be an-
ticipated with accuracy by the intelli-
gent student of the papers, but none
with such certainty as the notice of a
new revue. Thus:—
Last night saw the opening per-
formance, more than once postponed,
of the much-talked-of revue at the
Blank. We may say at once that it

PROBLEMS.
was worth waiting for, and that Mr.
Dash has again done well by his many
patrons. For several hours the eye
was amazed and fascinated by won-
derful schemes of prismatic har-
mony or contrast. Novelty having
long since been voted vieuw jeu by
our most successful producers, it
need hardly be said that the scenes
include a representation of a revue
during rehearsal, and a wild glimpse
of a night club in full swing. Such
plot as there is is soon disposed of;
but that is of no consequence, for the
succession of beautiful dresses and
tuneful numbers is continuous. If
we were so ungrateful as to be in the
mood to be critical, which we are not,
we might hint that the raison d'être
of a revue is possibly to review some-
thing, and that the many authors
who have laid their heads together
to produce this agreeable medley
might be wittier; but no doubt in the
eourse of a week or so redundancies
will go and jokes will come in. Mean-
while everyone is to be congratulated
on a remarkable performance, and
we never saw a better drilled chorus.
We venture to prophesy that it will
be a long time before Mr. Dash need
concern himself about a successor to
last night's triumph.
Any editor who wishes to employ his
dramatic critic on other tasks than a
visit to the next new revue is at liberty
to use the foregoing notice without fee
or even acknowledgment. It will be
found adequate.

[AUGUST 2, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN THE BLACK KITTEN'S WAKE.
THE following facts must be taken
for what they are worth. I merely
premise that they are facts.
I was recently playing lawn tennis,
when, just as I was about to serve, a
black kitten suddenly appeared from
nowhere and walked slowly towards
me across the court. Looking neither
to the right nor the left, it came close
to me and began to rub its cheek, its
side and its bushy tail against my skirt
and boots. Meanwhile the game was
suspended.
Being a woman I knew enough of
beneficent portents and mascots to re-
main perfectly still, even if I had not
been adjured to do so by the other
players, one of whom was my hostess.
“Don’t drive it away!" they said.
“That's a bit of luck, if you likel”
they said. -
“Well, you are fortunate to be
singled out like that l” said they.
And so on.
I needed no such counsel, for I was
myself by no means insensible to the
compliment or to the beatitudes ob-
viously before me.
After a minute or so the black kitten
retreated into the limbo from which it
had emerged and the game proceeded.
That no one there had ever seen it
before did not in any way lessen the
aura of distinction which its preference
had set about me.
A little later, twisting my ankle, I
had to stop playing.
The next day I merely had one of
my worst headaches. -
The day after, I left my house, car-
rying, as usual, a bag, since women
have not yet progressed so far on the
road to all-round efficiency as to have
sensible pockets. In this bag were a
number of Treasury notes to the amount
of about twenty pounds, and a cheque
for a like amount, and a child's bank
deposit book, all of which I was taking
to a place of safety. The bag, which,
with various predecessors, I have car-
ried safely for years, never left my
hand; but when I reached my desti-
nation the valuables were not in it.
I then remembered that in the Tube
a man had sat closer to me than there
was any need. That is more than
a week ago, and every effort to trace
the property has failed.
Since then one of my closest friends
has been taken ill, and I have sustained
two bereavements.
These are major ills. I have also
suffered from a number of trifling but
irritating minor troubles, every one of
which has afflicted me since that black
kitten so carefully picked me out among
women to be lucky.
It is therefore that I here with enter
into a solemn undertaking hence-
forward to lose no opportunity of
walking under ladders, spilling salt,
sitting down thirteen at table, seeing
single magpies, crossing my spoon and
fork, cutting my nails on Sunday, break-
ing mirrors, and sailing on a Friday;
and if ever a strange black kitten dares
to approach me again, it will do so
at the risk of its life.
REVERSION TO TYPE.
WITH bombs, bullets, mortars and
whizz-bangs
We continue to harry the Hun,
Each sportsman, wherever he is, bangs
Away with his rifle or gun;
No day but we snipe at his loopholes,
No night but we sever his wire,
Or with dummy heads stuck on a few
poles -
Encourage his ire.
We have learnt the philosopher's motto
That for man the best study is man,
And to study we find we have got to
Annihilate all that we can ;
Alternately hunter and quarry,
Successively sniper and snipe,
We have suffered a sudden and sorry
Reversion to type. -
We crawl with green paint on our faces
And ivy leaves stuck in our hair,
Imitating in suitable places
The centipede, walrus, or bear;
With feverish underground spade-work
We emulate crapulous moles,
Like beavers the dams we have made
work
Relief for our souls. . -
We slay with the joy of the leopard,
We stalk with the craft of the fox ;
Our food is the pie of the shepherd
Or a section of Argentine ox;
We shall try, when on leave, to be
sane, but
We're sure to be gauche and aloof,
Apt to plunge like a rat in the rain-butt,
Or sleep on the roof.
There are joys in the animal kingdom
Unknown to the prudent and prim,
Joy in counting the slain when you've
winged 'em,
Joy in safely retaining a limb;
So kindly excuse if, instead o' tea,
We worry a bone on the mat;
Read DARwIN's remarks on Heredity,
And leave it at that.

tion at Buxton, on Thursday, a resolution was

LoRD CHARN wood is to be congratulated on having had
the opportunity of writing the biography of so great a man
as ABRAHAM LINcoLN. He is not less to be congratulated
on the manner in which, in Abraham Lincoln (CoNSTABLE),
he has achieved his task. The book is well and attractively
put together, for Lord CHARNwood—how indeed, could he
help it?—has a genuine affection and reverence for the
man whose life he relates. He has mastered the details
of his career and he is able to unravel the tangled skein
of American politics in the period immediately preceding
the Civil War. He has realized, as few Englishmen,
perhaps, have realized, that the Southern States seceded not
so much by way of protest against the alleged tyranny
of a Northern majority typified by ABRAHAM LINcoLN,
as in order to maintain untouched the institution of
slavery. ALEXANDER STEPHENs, the Vice-President of the
Southern Confederacy, declared that, whereas the leading
statesmen of the old Constitution had thought that the
enslavement of the African was wrong in principle socially,
morally and politically, the new Government was founded
upon exactly the opposite idea; and he hailed slavery as
“the great physical, philosophical and moral truth" upon
which the new Government was based. If the Union
perished slavery must triumph; if the Union survived
slavery was doomed. The election of LINcolN to the
Presidency proved the determination of the large body
of the American democracy to wash out the great blot
upon their civilisation. To all this movement, slow at
first and often foiled, but at last gloriously triumphant,
and to ABRAHAM LINCOLN as its unconquerable leader,
Lord CHARNwood does full justice. It is a story from
which we, at such a moment as this, may draw comfort
and inspiration.
It was my misfortune that I approached Backwater
(DUckworth) with no knowledge of the previous book by
Miss DoRoth Y RICHARDsoN to which it is a sequel. Or,
perhaps I should rather say, without having read the first
instalment of the very long story of which Backwater is the
second, but not the last, portion. I confess that my chief
emotion was a mild surprise at finding so flourishing an
example of just the style of writing that we were assured
the War had killed. For this is detail in excelsis. Through-
out the two hundred-and-eighty pages of Backwater nothing
whatsoever happens, except that the heroine, whom, if you
have the advantage of me, you left returning from her term
as an assistant teacher at a German school, takes a similar
post at an establishment for young ladies in South London.
Don't imagine though that you are going to have any
topical contrasts between English and Teutonic systems of
education. Nothing so sensational. Poor Miriam simply
exists through her time at Miss Perne's, mildly hating it;
and at the end the girls subscribe to give her an umbrella.
Voilà tout ! And if you object that it is somewhat little I
will not contradict you. What there is about the book
that gives it value is a quite unusually intimate style, and
the sense it conveys of youth as a time when the trivialities
of life have not lost their tremendous and almost overpower-
ing significance. There is real art in this. Whether it is the

kind of art over which you wish to linger is a matter for
individual taste.
It was no doubt right that ‘there should be some
account of a man so ingenious and so unorthodox as
SAMUEL BUTLER, but I am not quite certain that Mr. John
F. HARRIs has set about it in the right way in his Samuel
Butler, Author of Erewhon (GRANT RICHARDs). Mr. HARRIs
is too easily diverted from his path. He starts to write
an introduction, and in a moment he is off after WALTER
BAGEHOT, “that alert critic of the mid-Victorians,” and in
another flash he has tackled WoRDsworth (whom he
patronises), FIELDING, Mrs. SHERwood, BENTHAM, Individ-
ualism, Victorian complacency, GEORGE ELIOT (whose tea-
parties he denounces) and Mr. CHESTERTON. There are
others, but these will do as a sample. The result is
a general feeling of having got things mixed up and
a particular impression that Mr. HARRIs is violently scorn-
ful and not a little angry, and that the Victorian age has
in some mysterious way done him a mortal injury. SAMUEL
BUTLER was a serious man, but he disguised his seriousness
stories that I am bound to say I found Joan and the Babies
and I (HURST AND BLACKETT) a little below expectation.
Apparently the author wrote it with a purpose, to show
that divorce should be made easier. But I hardly think he
has quite brought it off. John Mainwaring was a novelist
who made the acquaintance, at an American “coastal resort,”
of two attractive small children. Learning from them that
they lived with “Mudder and Nannie,” he traced them to
their house, and promptly fell in love with their female
parent. The father was at this time in New York, and
forgetting to send cheques. So John said, “I love you,”
and Joan (the mother) said, “Same here; ” and in an in-
credibly short time he had paid the overdue bills and
established himself, on strictly platonic lines, at the villa.
Then the de jure proprietor arrives on the scene—and you
wouldn't believe the scorn with which John and Mr.
HAMILTON overwhelm him. Whenever the poor wretch
opens his lips in protest—and really the position did make de-
mands upon his patience—he is called hypocritical, theatri-
cal, and I don't know what. Even his relations join in the
outcry; the uncle from whom he hopes to inherit saying in
in jest and could laugh at him-
self as well as at his fellow-
creatures. It must have given
him keen pleasure to write
The Fair Haven, but that plea- -
sure must have been trebled
when The Record accepted
the author of that book as a
valuable supporter of orthodox
views. Now Mr. HARRIs, like
BUTLER, is a serious man, but
he never permits himself any
disguise. He is always to be | ||
observed fuming away at the ||
very top notch of seriousness;
and the mood is not, I think,
that which serves best for the
discussion of the life and works
of such a man as BUTLER, a
gay philosopher if ever there
was one. In this last sentence
I feel that I have fallen into
UNPLEASANT ExPERIENCE OF A SMALL BOY WHO TOOK HIS
FATHER's chERISHED souvKNIR TO PLAY WITH.
I cut you out of my will!”
Eventually, of course, he does
give her up, and leaves me
marvelling at his reluctance
to do so earlier. There are
pleasant things in the book,
notably the neighbours of
John's English home; but
otherwise I should not call
it worthy of its witty author.

Mr. HARRIs's style, and I
therefore conclude lest I should become more deeply in
volved in it. -
The heroine of Helen in Love (HURST AND BLACKETT)
was a determined, almost a pugnacious, kisser. “It was
some weeks before anyone else kissed Helen,” are the
opening words of Chapter XVI., and I read them with a
sigh of relief, as if I had been given a well-earned holiday.
But the holiday was all too short, for Helen was at it again
on the very next page. Not that there was any harm in
her; she just kissed when she was “in the mood for it”;
I think she must have done it for exercise. With meticu-
lous care and no little insight AMBER REEVEs draws this
osculatory maiden as she kissed her way up the social
ladder, and if you are not impressed by the process the
reason cannot be that her feelings are not fully described.
I am a little surprised that a novelist of AMBER REEVEs’
ability should have condescended to analyse such a char-
acter as Helen's. She was scarcely worth the trouble or
the skill expended on her. However, as the War breaks
out before she has shed her last kiss, I shall hope that she
is now making munitions like a man.
I have before now owed and gratefully acknowledged so
much entertainment to Mr. Cosmo HAMILTON's amusing
LAXDALE is a tactful regret that
his next novel was not his first in publication. To put the
same idea more frankly, I hardly think he (or she, more
probably) has quite got the hang of writing a long story so
that its reading shall be a pleasure. The Dim Bourne
staggers and reels like the schooner Hesperus, chiefly, I
think, because the characters are allowed to develop the
let-me-tell-you-the-story-of-my-life habit till the baffled
reader is utterly fogged as to the point of time and place
that he is actually supposed to have reached. It is a
North-country tale, set chiefly in Lancashire and the Lake
District; and the crux of the whole matter is that a gentle-
man about to be married broke off his engagement because
his fiancée confessed that, against her will, another man had
kissed her. Frankly, I don't believe it even of the Lake
District, any more than I can accept the author's quaint
comparison of Cairo and Southport, towns which I should
have supposed to possess in common only a superfluity of
sand. So that's that. Sorry.
“Fortified by this concensus of opinion, the British Government
sanctioned the advance. Was ever tragic blunder supported by so
great a weight of authority?”—Daily Chronicle.
We agree that “concensus” is a blunder, but think that
our contemporary takes an exaggerated view in describing
it as tragic.

The dining-room on guest-night. The
Colonel of the Nth has brought some
of his officers. Next to one of these—
a quiet-looking subaltern—Capt. Win-
stanley, as Mess President, has placed
Capt. Mansell. Mansell is already
deep in conversation on his favourite
topic. The Subaltern has a listening
part only.
Capt. M. In fact, no man who can
even tolerate ragtime has any claim in
my opinion to be called a true musician.
The Subaltern (unexpectedly and with
heat). I disagree entirely. There is no
place in the arts for stiffnecked Toryism
of that kind. To my mind, “You made
me love you” marks a big musical and
rhythmical advance—almost a revolu-
tion. Nobody who underrates it can be
much of a judge.
Capt. M. (thunderstruck, turning to
Second-Lieut. Johnson on his left).

THIS is the theory we advance:

If you're out for loneliness, here's your

To be chosen to go,
And we others got stuck
On the edge of the show,
We have tried to believe ourselves
soldiers
And not altogether de trop.
Camp and caravan, march and halt,
|Works and Revenue, Forests and Salt,
If we aren't in Flanders it's not our
fault.
We would like to be there
As we need not discuss,
And we do not compare
Their position with us;
But we think we're sufficiently lonely |
If anyone's making a fuss.
Khond and Bhagata, Gond and Bhil ;
Jungle to-day and to-morrow a jhil— |
A season among 'em and how do you feel? |
We are free to admit
That the country is good;
We have excellent kit
And we’ve excellent food;
But we heard you were fond of the
lonely,
So we thought you should know
how we stood. - * * -
Bison drink where the madi bends,
Deer come out where the jungle ends,
And they give us the sport, but they
don't make friends. I.
We've been out three-score
Clear days on the run,
And there's as many more
Ere the camp gets done;
And the wind and the rain to con-
verse with, -
And the moon and the stars and
the sun.
Coolie and orderly, cook and clerk, ...
One long worry from dawn till dark;
Thank heaven for dogs—but they only
bark.
So we wake in the night
And we wonder again
If you'd bother to write
To poor devils of men
Who've got stuck at the ends of the
Empire
And are utterly out of your ken.
We shan't see Flanders, we shan't see
France—
Bound to have wallflowers at every
dance—
And our folk have forgotten us . . .
Now's your chance.

XLV. -
MR DEAR CHARLEs, And what do
you suppose it is really like being
along with the B.E.F. when it is in its
pushful mood 2 Exciting? No. De.
pressing 2 Hardly. Just ordinary—
rather more ordinary than usual. Up
to the last moment I cherished the
fond belief that we should be able to
climb up ridges and watch each other
doing it. It would have been so nice
and convincing to watch the other side,
with beads of perspiration on -
their brow, sticking it out as
long as they could, half turning
to go, being prodded on from
behind, smiling wanly at the
pushers, suggesting a half-time
interval, giving a little in the
centre and fraying a little at
the edges, finally breaking, run-
ning back some kilometres and
then having another try. But
no, there is no Grand Stand and
there is even no Tape Machine.
The men from behind eagerly
accost the men returning from
the front : the latter are most
pleased to be accosted, because
they want to be told all about
it. Neither lot knows anything,
but both might have said any-
thing. For a time everybody
was quite prepared to believe
what everybody else said. A
rumour or two did try to float
about in the first days, but it
got drowned.
Many of us were apt, at first,
to discover at convenient inter-
vals that we had pressing busi-
ness with the Powers that
Be in the Central Information
Bureau. We just dropped in
to test their lighting arrange-
ask if their food suited them,
and whether there were any -
complaints. They are an unsociable
lot, but that didn't stop us staying on a
bit to talk about one thing and another,
incidentally the War. Sometimes one
did discover them so sweating with
suppressed excitement that they had
to speak out.
I think there is universally prevalent
a strong touchwood feeling. All you
get from asking direct questions of the
people who ought to know is the very
distinct impression either that there is
no push at all, or else it is a SECRET AND
confidBNTIAL one. Even when my
people at home had written and told
me about Pozières, and I begged an
authoritative friend to divulge, he took
me round a corner, assured himself
it's all right . . . Sh! .

only question is, how long is it going
to take to complete? But, for heaven's
sake, don't let anybody know that I
have gone even as far as that. If you
do I shall be court-martialled as a
marplot, in that I did speak, utter and
allege certain boastful sentiments and
did tempt Providence to be wroth with
the Allied Powers, thus imperilling a
certain enterprise upon which His Ma-
jesty's Forces are at present engaged.
A reason of this attitude may be that
it was always known the fighting would
be done all right, and so there is no
cause to be surprised or to comment
on it. To mention the word success,

I have a curious longing to
lean back in my chair and make
the most costly rings for the
mere pleasure of blowing the
expense. This time last year,
my lad, Germany was just
finishing off Russia, and we
were waiting behind the parapet
for the arrival of the phalanx
which was to finish us off.
Whereas now you may have
noticed that . . . but let me
|talk of something else.
| Soda - water is the subject
chosen for the purpose by the
man in the ranks. “Wonder-
ful,” he declares to the persist-
ent seekers after the thrilling
descriptions of war. “You
never see the like. Across in
them trenches there was real-
soda-water in bottles.”
“Yes,” they say, humouring
him and leading him gradually
to the point.
“And what about the battle?”
“The bottle 2" he asks.
“No, the battle—what you've
just been through.”
Tº “Ah, yes,” he says, “I’ve
been through it, and so has all
our chaps. And when we came to
their trenches we could 'ardly believe
it. 'Appened 1 came across old George
there, and 'e was the same as me.
Amazed, like. As 'e remarked to me,
‘Did you ever see the like?' 'e says.
‘Soda-water in bottles.' And there it
was bottles of it.”
You get no further than that, except
perhaps to learn that the soda-water,
as well as being bottled, was also
“aireated.”
I have only one picture for you: a
dusty man arriving at a cage with a
dozen prisoners, who, contrasted with
their warder, are comparatively cheer-
ful. You would think a man who had
never before commanded so much as one

small boy would be proud of his position.
There is nothing of that. It is merely,
“Where shall I put them, Major 2" to
the warrant-officer in charge of the
cage. “There's a corporal behind
with more. The officer gave him the
papers.” He takes a war-worn cigar-
ette from behind his ear and lights it.
“If I had my way,” he says, “there
wouldn't be no prisoners and there
wouldn't be no papers.” He spits on
the ground and casts a gloomy eye
round the enclosure. It dwells for a
moment on the catch of the season.
“And him a Colonel, too,” he says
almost angrily as he departs.
The Corporal arrived later and ex-
plained. The man was a poor walker
and disliked that kind of exercise,
unless it was for an essential purpose.
Without in any way wishing to be
vindictive he had felt, upon being told
off for escort, that this was a purpose
which might have been avoided.
I saw this same Colonel later, pro-
ceeding. It was intended every time
to be a fine performance, but it had a
pathetic end. His bearing was the truly
dignified, his expression the stonily
impersonal and the magnificently in-
scrutable. Always and above all he was
anofficer and agentleman; other officers,
however nationally deficient, were, at
any rate, officers and to be saluted as
such. It was unfortunate that my large
and not too reputable friend, Georges
Lefebvre, was in the street at this
moment wearing his most special and
glaring uniform. Whatever he may
seem to be, Georges is really a fonction-
maire, who plays about with the tickets
and the signals and the luggage, twice
a day, at the somewhat degenerate
railway station. We all got our recog-
nition in turn from the captured
Colonel, but the salute of the day went
to Georges Lefebvre.
There are very many remarkable men
in these parts nowadays, but one con-
tingent in particular catches the eye.
I am told it is the deuce to keep quiet
even when it is supposed to be lying
down and taking a little rest. When I
think what it must be like when it is
officially on the loose ... Well, Charles,
I simply can't help being a little sorry
for the Bosch now that his wild oats
are coming home to roost.
I think perhaps I'll have a cigar
with two bands round it, please.

the happy effect of inspiring a compe-

the biggest Sporpot, the contents of
all competing Sporpots to be made into
a fund for helping to build up again
the homes of Belgian exiles when they
return to their country. The compe-
tition extended over the October and
Easter terms, and Mr. Punch has the
honour to announce that the champion-

best compliments to the winners and
his blessing to all who shared in this

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MIXED STATISTICS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-A few days ago
there appeared in The Star a letter
from a gentleman who claimed to have
established a new record—as that of
the most rejected man in England.
To quote his own words:—
“This is my record in round num-
bers —
Rejected by theatrical managers,
100 times.
Rejected by publishers and editors,
50 times. -
Rejected by the Army medical officer,
twice.
Rejected by girls, twice.
Rejected by dramatic pioneers like
Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. J. T.
Grein, 10 times.
Failed in 100 prize competitions.
*Total: 264 failures.
Many men have committed suicide
for far less than this, but I intend to
live for England as long as possible.
Still, I do get a bit downhearted when
I reflect that a man with imagination,
intellect, originality and humour should
be doomed to the ‘blind cave of eter-
nal night,' intellectually, while Charlie
Chaplin gets £130,000 per annum for
wearing an inane smile and baggy
trousers. -
I'm afraid there is something wrong
with England's soul.”
Of course there is. Has there ever
been a time when there wasn't 2 But
that is no reason why the writer should
endeavour to claim especial distinction
for his personal statistics. Anybody
can establish some sort of a record.
My father, for example, ate more green
peas at a sitting than any man of his
time, but our family never attained
eminence until I became available for
obloquy and adulation. Here are a
few of my figures, all carefully compiled
from records kept in my diaries for the
last thirty years:–
Hissed in the theatre or public places,
290 times.
Photographed at my own expense,
twice; ditto gratuitously (including
the nude), 2,940 times.
Interviewed in the public prints,
3,762 times; by self, 3,760 times; with
portrait, 3,680 times.
Proposals of marriage received, 390.
Challenges to fight duels, 410.
Criminals whose cause I have
espoused, 213.
Number of occasions on which I
have sided with the majority—Nil.
Epithets, eulogistic, bestowed on
self, 2,379,666. -
Ditto, ditto bestowed on other
authors and playwrights, 3.
Appreciations, testimonials and in-
vitations received from hostile Powers,
1071.
Ditto, ditto from Allies—Nil.
It is a wonderful record. Ordinary
men, by a judicious selection of facts
and figures, can assume a spurious
importance, but only genius is extra-
ordinary in the true sense of the word.
And I feel that in the third year of the
War nobody of British name and
parentage has a more remarkable in-
ternational reputation—not even Mr.

THE REVUE KING'S COURIER.
THE Revue King begs to state that
he has taken steps to communicate
periodically information of a vital
character concerning his numerous
theatrical devices for parting the public
from their money.
The New Offensive.
At the risk—but it's a very slight
one—of wearying you with minute
details of the lives and genius of the
better revue artists, I propose, at my
own expense, to contribute a column
of such chatter to the papers every
week. But this will not, I trust, have
the effect of diverting the eyes of the
Mr. Gossips and Mr. Ramblers and all
the other camp-followers of the revue
from also noticing the members of my
various companies. In spite of my
poor efforts these will still be, as before,
on view both in town, principally at
lunch, and, on Sundays, on the river,
and therefore available for paragraphic
attention. Now and then I may be
visible too. .

should plump for one of the songs
sung by actors in my employ. It is a
question whether it is “All the Fun
of the Front” at the Remedy, or
“Where's the War?” at the Dip-
lomats'.
A Coincidence.
Some people collect coincidences.
Here is one for them. The other
day at lunch at Dearo's I overheard
someone ask a Cabinet Minister who
was the most beautiful woman in
London. At dinner at the Fritz the
same night I overheard someone
ask an ex-Cabinet Minister the saune
question. The remarkable part of the
coincidence is that both made the
same reply. Both named Madame
Exquisia.
Cur Real Heroes.
Who are the people who are making
history to-day 2 The artists in revue.

“Laughter holding both its sides.”
I suppose all managers have heavy
correspondence. I know that I do. I
have received to date one hundred and
forty-three letters, all imploring me
not to make my forthcoming revue so
funny as the others. My correspon-
dents say that they can't stand it. I
have handed over the missives to my
various authors, who are certainly
among the wittiest men in London.
It is up to them, as our American
cousins say. But there is no doubt
as to the laughter which my revues
cause. I think I never saw anyone
laugh so heartily as Lord BRYCE did
at little Able Bustle at the Remedy
the other night.
comedian and Warrior Too.
Some people might be so mistaken
as not to expect much patriotic en-
thusiasm from revue actors, but they
would be wrong. I can point to one
of my men who has joined up. The
military authorities, however, knowing
when to temper justice with mercy,
allow him not to miss any perform-
ance, not even the Saturday matinée.
Esprit de Corps.
I suppose every one has noticed
that the programmes on sale both at
the Diplomats' and the Remedy are
made of paper. This is because no
other material is so serviceable. Our
stage is lighted by electricity for the
same reason. The comfort and happi-
ness of our patrons is the first thought
of every member of the personnel,
from myself to that very original and
remarkable character, the call-boy.
Quaint Behaviour of a U-boat.
From a description of the capture of
U C 5:— -
“There remained scarcely time to appreciate
the quaintness of the encounter, for, after the
submarine jumped into the sea and swam for
dear life from the vessel, there followed a series
of explosions.”—Dublin Evening Mail.
You should see it treading water off the
Temple Pier.
Under the heading, “The Lion's
Bite,” The Evening News quotes the
following passage from The Times'
Paris correspondent — -
“The whole offensive is mathematical, in-
exorable. What has been taken will not be
lost. It is not so much ‘nibbling' as chewing
the cud.”
This lion must be a kind of heraldic
beast, first rampant, then rodent, and
finally ruminant.

HORROCKS! PRIDE.
WHEN the spring came there was
every indication of a long stay for our
battery in the ruins of , and
naturally enough, with the first buds,
our thoughts turned to the home gar-
dens overseas. I think most of us found
ourselves longing to be back pottering
about the old beds with a trowel in one
hand and a packet of seeds in the other.
It was the Doctor who first gave us any
ideas in this direction. One day at tea
he produced some mustard and cress
which he had grown on the Adjutant's
sponge. He said it would go very well
with bread-and-butter, but we pointed
out that it was the Adjutant's property
and he had the right to eat it. Not
long after, some of the men started to
dig a piece of land behind the gun-pits.
Seeds were sent out to them from home
and soon nearly half the battery had
secured plots of earth, where they gar-
dened in their spells off duty. The
C.O. thoroughly approved of this and
offered a prize to the one who could
put up the best show by Midsummer
Day.
The scheme was hailed with enthu-
siasm. So far as I could see there was
only one drawback to it, and that lay
in the bitter feud which existed between
Drivers McVie and Horrocks. Taken
alone, better men or gunners never lived,
but each exhibited the most extraordin-
ary antipathy towards the other. No-
body knew how it started, although the
Sergeant-Major professed to trace, it
back to an evening when Horrocks had
compared the Trossachs with Hamp-
stead ponds, to the overwhelming
advantage of the latter. As it was, the
men worked in their gardens, each with
a savage determination to outdo the
other. Each had made up his mind to
win the Colonel's prize, and as the great
day drew near it became increasingly
evident that the award would have to
be made to one of the two. Their gar-
dens were wonderful to see. McVie
favoured a border made of empty shell
cases, Horrocks preferring a more con-
ventional arrangement of broken bricks,
which he brought from the village.
The Scotchman's seeds came from his
native farm in the glens of Perthshire,
while Horrocks had been content with
penny packets culled from the window
of a Mile End sweet-shop. And the
wonder was that the Cockney had
succeeded. Never was such an array
of phloxes, stocks and poppies, and,
although his garden could not boast
the goodly collection of carrots and
radishes that his rival had raised, I
had little doubt as to who would be
the winner.

at the patch which the rest of the bat-
tery had long ago dubbed “Horrocks'
Pride.” To our great astonishment he
was standing dejectedly beside a mass
of uprooted flowers, while at his feet
yawned a tremendous hole with a shell
fragment lying conspicuously at the
bottom.
“Well, I'm hanged 1" said the C.O.,
looking at him for an explanation.
“One o' them sixty-punders must ha'
dropped on it in the night, Sir,” said
Horrocks. “I thought I 'eard some-

it was, or it might 'ave been 'alf-past.
This 'ere little garding weren't never
meant to be planted with German 'igh

“Well, it's hard luck, Horrocks, be-
cause it rather alters things,” said the
C.O., moving away to the next garden.
“McVie, I think, wins the prize,” he
went on after some minutes' deliber-
ation. I nodded agreement and walked
away thoughtfully. -
That night after dinner the letters
were brought to me for censoring. In
one envelope, which had apparently
seen service as a receptacle for tobacco,
I found a well-thumbed note:–

the Colonel said to me, “Horrocks,

Later on I strolled down to the field,
where I found him trying to repair the
damage which his beloved garden had
sustained. For a minute or two neither
of us spoke, and then I looked him

“what clean holes some of these shells
make. This, for instance, might almost
have been done with a spade.”
Horrocks stood stiffly to attention,

“It was far and away the best piece

why some of the Radicals below the
Gangway were so rude when Mr.
AsquitH proceeded to expound the
and to state—in
somewhat vague outline—how we and
Paris resolutions,
our Allies proposed to prevent Germany
from renewing after the War the policy
of peaceful penetration which has cost
us all so dearly during the campaign.
In vain he protested that the resolu-
tions were drafted by Mr. RUNCIMAN, an
orthodox Cobdenite if ever there was
one, and that he himself was as good
a Free-Trader as ever. The little knot
of malcontents received nearly all his
statements with derisive cheers. Sir
John SIMON declared with super-feline
amenity that the Liberal Members of
the Cabinet were evidently as devoted
to Free Trade as they were to volun-
tary service and to self-government for
Ireland ; and Mr. SNowDEN acidly
asserted that the only thing the PRIME
MINISTER now had to surrender was
his office, and the sooner he did so the
better.
It was refreshing to turn from these
reminders of prehistoric controversies
(as Mr. BonAR LAw described them) to
the common-sense of Mr. HoDGE, who
did not want our men returning from
the trenches to find themselves unem-
ployed through German dumping, and
advocated Lord KITCHENER's plan of
subjecting Germany to a twenty-one
years' penance.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE SISTER-IN-LAw.”
For most of us the problem of the
deceased wife's sister never had any
but an academic interest, and even that
has passed with the Edwardian age.
But there remains, and must ever
remain, the far more poignant problem
of the living wife's sister. And now that
mothers-in-law as a theme for easy
ribaldry have become discredited, Brit-
ish drama, ever seeking for new foun-
tains of inspiration, has discovered the
sister-in-law. She has this advantage,
that whereas there can never be more
than two mothers-in-law in any ménage,
there is practically no limit (within
nature and reason) to the number of
possible sisters-in-law.
Mr. CYRIL HALLwARD, however, does
not exercise his full option. Though
each of his female characters (I except
the parlour-maid, about whose family
relations we were left in ignorance) is a
sister-in-law, they only total three. I
think he ought to have had more, for
some of us got rather tired before the
end and wanted a change.
From the very moment of the Bawtreys'
return from their honeymoon—indeed
Mrs. Bawtrey would have welcomed
her at an even earlier stage — Dolly
Marston, her sister, had planted her.
self upon this pair, and ruled the do-.
mestic hearth. Two years had already
elapsed, and it was only the interven-
tion of Bawtrey's sister that forced him
to recognise that it was time for Dolly
to go. Strongly supported by her sister,
she declines to move, and Bawtrey's
only way to freedom is to push her into
a marriage with Lawrence Hill, stock-
broker. At the same time he has the
misfortune (though I personally did not
regard it as such) to quarrel with his
wife, who goes off to stay indefinitely
with the newly-married Dolly.
We have now, at the Hills', an almost
perfect replica of the first state of things
—a sister-in-law firmly established in a
household where she is not wanted by
the husband. There might have been
a pleasant irony in this if it had satis-
fied (as far as comedy may) the con-
ditions of Greek tragedy—if, that is to
say, the stockbroker had in some way
been responsible for the original ar-
rangement d trois, and was now, in
his own case, paying the penalty that
best fitted his offence. Unhappily the
author was innocent of any such design.
To be candid, his own scheme was
not handled as well as it might have
een, and though it had its very pleas-
ant spasms of fun it never achieved
the boisterous gaiety which excuses a
lack of technique. We suffered a good
deal of tedious repetition before we got
our first chance of amusing ourselves;
and what should have been the best
character in the cast—the critic who
had always abused Bawtrey's plays and
ended by marrying his sister and turn-
ing eulogist—was never mentioned till
the last Act and put in no appearance
at all.
Mr. HALLWARD calls his play a light
comedy. I will not quarrel with his
epithet, though what is light to him
may be heavy to me, but I must
make one more protest against the
employment, in a comedy, of the license
of farce. In a farce nobody has any
right to object if a character enters upon
a full stage and turns detached somer-
saults without considering their ethical
relationship to the other characters or
to the matter in hand. In a comedy
one resents this behaviour. Yet that,
in effect, is what Mr. HALLwaRD per-
mits in his characters. Somebody
comes on and takes the stage to him-
self for his own purpose, leaving the
rest of the figures in an equipoise of
suspended animation. Among them
may be the wife from whom he has been
severed for months, but he is not to be
put out of his stride by that or any
other distraction. Even in a light
comedy thé disregard of probabilities
in small things may be just as annoying
as any defiance, in a serious play, of
the larger laws of human nature. -
An excellent cast, including Miss
MARIE ILLINGTON, Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR,
Mr. SAM SoTHERN, Miss CHRISTINE
SILVER and Mr. HIGNETT (the applause
accorded to Mr. HIGNETT on his first
entry was a tribute rarely accorded
to a man-servant), made the most of
a rather undistinguished play. Miss
MARY O'FARRELL, who was the original
sister-in-law, showed well when she
was angry, but was not very effective
with the lighter side of her part. Cer-
tainly she failed to convey to me the
piquancy which she herself appeared
to discover in it.
I should like to think that it was my
fault, and that The Sister-in-Law found
me in an unappreciative mood. At the
close the general verdict of the audience
was favourable to her. Let us hope
they were right and that she is in for
a long run, if that is a kind wish for
her. I myself should not like to run
very far in this weather. O. S

THE FUTURE OF BOOKS.
THE interesting symposium recently
published in The Weekly Dispatch on
the future of the book-world had only
one drawback. It was not complete,
and Mr. Punch is glad to be able to
remedy this defect by adding the views
of some leading publishers who were
unaccountably omitted from the record.
Sir John Odder, Bart., of the firm of
Odder and Odder, declines to prophesy,
justifying himself by the refusal of the
Grand Duke Nicholas to indulge in.
prognostications, but he is certain that
the shilling novel has come to stay.
“People no longer buy books singly,
but in handfuls. They are indis-
pensable not merely as mental pab-
ulum but as upholstery. Look at the
number of shelves in bedrooms nowa-
days as compared with twenty years
ago, and remember that, as some poet
remarks somewhere, “Shelves without
books are like kitchens without cooks.’”
Mr. Thicker, of the house of Thicker
and Steep, expresses a fervent hope
that the anaemic six-shilling novel will
die, and that its place will be taken by
the cheap robust novel, “full of the
red corpuscles of realism.” He is of
opinion that the circulating libraries
have been the great stumbling-block in
the way of strong and live literature.
Mr. Blessing declares that the shilling
novel is the greatest boon to humanity
since the days of CAxton. “The
'shocker' is only the logical corollary
of shock-tactics in war, and is abso-
lutely indispensable as a means of
counteracting the lethargy of a sophis-
ticated generation.” Mr. Blessing notes
as an interesting fact that one of the
twenty-seven variants in the spelling of
SHAKSPEARE's name is “Shockspear.”
Per contra Mr. Goethemann thinks
that the shilling novel has not come to
stay, because he anticipates that the
Government will find it necessary to
lay an embargo on it, as on cocaine,
because of its demoralising and disinte-
grating influence. In fine, he thinks
it not improbable that the old 31s. 6d.
three-volume novel will be reintroduced
with a statutory sanction, the price to
be net, in order to prevent the dissem-
ination of cheap literary garbage.
Mr. Cuthbert Simpson thinks that
the shilling is not the enemy but the
ally of the six shilling novel, since the
result of a too prolonged immersion in
sensational fiction is to promote an
inevitable reaction towards sobriety.
Besides, novelists cannot live on the
profits of shilling books. Even pub-
lishers, Mr. Simpson added in a moment
of heroic expansion, find it difficult,
and he himself has sold twenty million
copies of The Young Blood's Library.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Uncensored Letters from the Dardanelles (HEINEMANN),
written by a French Doctor and translated by his English
wife, has not been too happily named, for part of this
correspondence, and not by any means the least interesting,
was written after the author had left Gallipoli for Serbia.
But one cannot quarrel with the title of so absorbing
a book. Time after time, in most revealing flashes, the
writer brings before our eyes the insuperable difficulties
which the Allies had to face; but, although the story of these
heroic ventures is pathetic enough, we are saved here from
any depression by a wonderfully infectious spirit of cheer-
fulness and courage. The tighter the place the more our
Doctor (he will forgive the proprietary epithet) braced
himself to deal with it. Fortunately, like most brave men,
he is also modest; but, from the mere facts which he tells
without laying any stress on them, it is impossible not to
think of him as a very capable person. He gives us not
only a clear account of determined fighting against over-
whelming odds, but a very distinct and vivid impression
that nothing can ever break or beat an army which has
stood the supremest of tests and still retained its moral.
It is a gallant book, not only in its pictures of the War, but
also in its attitude towards the lady to whom these letters
were written. If no Bosches had broken loose over Europe
the Doctor could have written love-letters which would have
fluttered the feminine world. But, as it is, his mingling of
Love with War will please countless people who cannot
face an undiluted draught of either.
It is possible that, if you share my own most pleasant
recollections of Mrs. Barnet—Robes, and The Hat Shop,
you may agree with me that in A Mrs. Jones (LANE) that
clever writer, Mrs. C. S. PEEL, has done herself something
less than justice. It is not that the book lacks humour or
character or charm; it abounds in them all; but somehow
these gifts never seem to come by their due effect. Perhaps.
the reason of this is the absence of form in the story.
Mrs. PEEL appears to have become a convert to the theory
that if you conduct a central character from infancy to
middle-age you have done all that is required to make a
novel. Nothing very much happens to Dorothy, her pre-
sent protagonist, though the reader is kept in a constant
expectation of events on the next page. After being wooed
by various more-or-less romantic suitors, she marries a
placid man named Jones, and bears him a daughter in
whom placidity degenerates into vacuity. Towards the
dangerous age of forty poor Mrs. Jones gets so deadly
bored with the pair of them that she sets off alone for the
other side of the world. Here for a moment romance

touches her, but having got it over she returns calmed to
the life of domestic affluence. Not much of a story; but
fortunately this is the least part of the book. The best of
it are the chapters in which financial stringency drives
Mrs. Jones into supporting the family income by journalism
on a ladies' paper. And there are many happy touches,
such as Dorothy's very human outburst against her placid
husband for not getting angry at bad food. Clearly
Mrs. PEEL appreciates the drawbacks of living with the
equably-tempered. I hope next time that she will put her
good things into a more artistic setting.
Very few novelists succeed nowadays in evading the War,
but were it not for her dedication Miss KATE HORN, in Love's
Law (STANLEY PAUL), would be of their slender company.
Her story is of a young woman possessed of two qualities
that are meat and drink to traffickers in fiction, (a) beauty
discussed question of games is absolutely sound, and to a
certain extent he appreciates the changes which War has
brought about in the thoughts and ambitions of public-
school boys. That a man who has such strong opinions
and also the courage of them should be attacked in his turn
is only to be expected, but when opponents talk of his
“upsetting, irrational, nonsensical notions,” he could quite
easily afford to smile instead of being at times “dispirited,”
as he tells us he is.
One does not want to discourage versatility and experi-
mentalisation in authors; but it is a question whether their
attempts at new departures should necessarily find their
way into print. Artists (at any rate most artists: I except in
this connection Mr. AUGUSTU's JoHN) do not hang all their
sketches, so why should authors publish all their tentative
efforts? These remarks occur to me after reading The
and (b) a determination to have
nothing to do with marriage or
men. Given such material the
end is, of course, always in
sight, and it is merely a matter
of pages before the triumphant
wooer—in this case the suave,
tactful and middle-aged Major
Dawne—wins his bride. There
are en route some not very con-
vincing pictures of a suburban
pair of love-birds whose bliss is
ruined (as it never would have ||
been in real life) by the wife's
instant readiness, after years of
married trust and felicity, to
believe the first anonymous
story of her husband's infide-
lity; and the author's later draft
upon the bank of melodrama to
discredit her heroine is not much
better. That a writer with Miss
HoRN's gift for making direct
transcripts from life should dip
into the reservoir of cliches at
all is a mystery. But she is
evidently more fond of conven-
tion, even when it is hollow,
than originality, or she would
have also resisted the tempta-
tion, which now besets every
LADY'S MAID ON THE LAND.
| Captain's Furniture (MILLs AND
Boon), by Jo HN TRE v ENA.
Hitherto Mr. TREvenA has been
known to me as the writer of
stern and uncompromising
novels of a dour and passionate
peasantry. One of these was
called Furze the Cruel, and
another Granite, and they in-
dicated (as has indeed been
|ion, before) what fierce emo-
tions can smoulder beneath the
simple exteriors of the dwellers
in Devon. But in The Captain's
Furniture, where Devon is still
the background, there is nothing
but farce, and farce long drawn
|out and, alas! not funny. There
is hardly a creature in the book
in whom one can believe, which
of course matters nothing in a
|farce so long as we are bustled
into laughter, but matters very
much if (as in the present case)
! We are not.
It is not every day that you
can watch folk-lore in the mak-
in. Yet that was the agreeable
feeling that I derived from a
little volume written by Mr.
young novelist, to lay some of her scenes in Cornwall, a
sadly overworked county.
Mr. S. P. B. MAIs is a tilter, and in the sketches of which
A Public School in War-Time (MURRAY) is comprised, he
delivers many, a hefty thrust, and has, I should guess,
thoroughly enjoyed his bout. While sympathising with
his aims, especially where he urges the cultivation of a taste
for good literature in boys, I cannot repose a complete con-
fidence in him. On page 66 he writes, “Boys are born actors;
let them act, encourage them at all times to act; boys
have a far finer imagination than most adults.” Agreeing
cordially with this sentiment, it was a shock to me to find,
a few pages later, “Remember, please, boys have no imagin-
ation.” What does Mr. MAIs really mean? If a boy has
no imagination and yet a far finer one than most adults,
where do the unfortunate majority of us come in 2 I can-
not help resenting this confusion, because it has shaken my
faith in the tilter, if not in the tilt. Still, much can be for-
given to such an enthusiast as Mr. MAIs. He shows here
a real affection for boys; his attitude towards the much
NorMAN Doug LAs, under the title of London Street Games
(St. CATHERINE's Press). Perhaps you know already Mr.
Douglas's gift of racy humour, as shown in his Italian
journey-books. This time he has wandered no further than
the pavements of various London districts, watching the
children at play there, and noting down I could not count
how many different games. The result is interesting,
amusing, and at times not a little pathetic—though perhaps
this last feeling is an unjustified sentimentalism, since
children at play, whether among lamp-posts or orchards,
are always in their proper kingdom. More genuinely sad
is the conclusion to which Mr. Dougi,As's observations
have led him, that modern conditions, and especially the
ubiquitous flicker-palace, are tending to destroy in London
children the power of imagination by which these street
games have been evolved. Therefore he hastens to take
note of them for future historians. This is a grim saying.
But one may at least be glad that some of the only gold
with which London streets were ever paved, the make-
believe of childhood, has been stored so sympathetically, if
only for a museum.

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(The EMPEROR FRANCIs Joseph and the GERMAN KAISE.R.)
Francis Joseph. You may say what you please, but I
shall maintain my opinion. Things are not going well,
and your Germans are no better off than my Austrians.
Thousands of your men are taken prisoners; you lose guns
and are forced to retire by the French, the British, and the
Russians, and then you choose such a moment to come to
me and ask me to put my forces under the command of
your voN HINDENBURG. Really it is a little too much.
Heaven knows I'm not short-tempered as a rule, but this
proposal is enough to make even the most patient and
amiable man in the world flare up.
The German Kaiser (aside). The old man's peevish. I
must attempt to humour him. (Aloud) My dear Emperor,
how you mistake me. Can you possibly think that I am
capable of inflicting a slight upon the glorious Austrian
army and its beloved chief ? No, no. Put the idea out of
your mind at once. All I suggest is that at this critical
time it would be a convenience for both of us that the
commands of the armies should be to some extent united,
so that there may be no conflicts of authority and no waste
of time. That is all.
Francis Joseph. And you suggest that voN HINDENBURG
should command in chief ?
The German Kaiser. It was merely an idea of mine put
forward for your consideration. I'm not wedded to it;
but, if we don't fix on voN HINDENBURG, whom else do you
suggest ?
Francis Joseph. To tell you the truth, I'm not particularly
favourable to voN HINDENBURG. There's something about
him that I can't say I care for—something overbearing and
harsh. Isn't he just a little too Prussian even for your
taste 2
The German Kaiser. Really, I must ask your Majesty to
remember in whose presence you are speaking.
Francis Joseph. Do you think I'm likely to forget it 2 I
know well enough who you are and from whom you
descend. Fatal, indeed, have your ancestors been to the
Austrian Empire, and fatal must you be with your rash-
ness, your ambition, and—since I must say it—your
impetuous desire to offend by your want of tact and your
bad manners those whom you cannot otherwise control.
The German Kaiser. Upon my soul, this is too much.
Rashness you may charge me with in having bound myself
to take up your cause, and ambition is no dishonourable
quality, but that I should live to be accused of bad
manners and want of tact—that is beyond all belief. I
leave you and shall leave your shattered armies to the
punishment you and they deserve (he makes for the door).
You'll be sorry for this, you know.
Francis Joseph. Oh, come away from that door, do. I
take back what I said and acknowledge you to be the best
mannered and the most tactful of men.
The German Kaiser. Well, I'll forgive you just this once,
but you must listen to reason. There's something in the
air at the Eastern Front which doesn't seem to suit the
Austrian soldiers quite so well as it suits the Russians, and
all I propose is
Francis Joseph. Yes, I know what you propose. You
needn't rub it in more than is absolutely necessary. I
submit, and consent that my armies should be placed under
the command of voN HINDENBURG.
The German Kaiser. Your Majesty will have no reason to
regret it. Henceforth our front will be truly united, and we
shall swiftly defeat those who have set themselves to
destroy the German nation and its arts and sciences.
Francis Joseph. But that is just what is worrying me.
I can see no signs of this swift victory for our arms any-
where. Come, you know, you will have to put on that
shining armour I used to hear you talk about.
The German Kaiser. And you, for your part, will perhaps
say a word or two to your Archdukes. After all, you may
as well remember that it was you who began the War.
Francis Joseph. Nonsense, it was you. All I blame
myself for is that I didn't check you in time.
(Left disagreeing.)
MULES.
I NEVER would 'ave done it if I'd known what it would be.
I thought it meant promotion an' some extra pay for me;
I thought I'd miss a drill or two with packs an' trenchin'
tools,
So I said I'd 'andled 'orses—an' they set me 'andlin' mules.
Now 'orses they are 'orses, but a mule 'e is a mule

If I'd been Father NoAH when the cargo walked aboard,
I'd 'ave let the bears an' tigers in, an’ never spoke a word;
But I'd 'ave shoved a placard out to say the 'ouse was full,
An' shut the Ark up suddent when I saw the Army mule.
They buck you off when ridden, they squish your leg
when led ; -
They're mostly sittin' on their tail or standin' on their 'ead;
They reach their yellow grinders out an' gently chew your
ear,
An' their necks is indiarubber for attackin' in the rear.
They're as mincin' when they're 'appy as a ladies' ridin'-
school, -
But when the fancy takes 'em they're like nothin' but a
mule—
With the off wheels in the gutter an' the near wheels in
the air,
An' a leg across the traces, an' the driver Lord knows where.
They're 'orrid in the stable, they're worse upon the road;
They'll bolt with any rider, they'll jib with any load;
But soon we're bound beyond the seas, an' when we cross
the foam
I don't care where we go to if we leave the mules at 'ome.
For 'orses they are 'orses, but a mule 'e is a mule
(Bit o' devil, bit o' monkey, bit o' bloomin' boundin' fool!)
Oh, I’m usin' all the adjectives I never learnt at school

HE was sick of the tyranny of mar-

country. A “Pathriot” could no
longer shoot a policeman without in-
terference from the brutal British
soldiery. Ireland was no sort of a
place for a man any more. She was
oppressed, ground down, but England
was the favoured country—always had
been. So he made up his mind to go that London was a dismal place and to be taken suddenly ill. He did it
there and enjoy the freedom
denied him at home.
On arrival in London he was
asked for his registration card.

he was sorry, and explained,

The exile was sad as it neared
the ridiculously early closing
time. Well, he would take a
drop home against the night,
so he called for a bottle. The
busy barmaid was sorry he
could not have it and told him
to come again next week. It
was Friday night. He did not
understand, and at throwing-
out time, when the day had just
gone, he sought a bus to take
him to his lodging. No bus.
He asked a policeman — the
Spirit of London, who knows
all things. “Sorry Sir, Route

but after a few hundred yards
the taxi-man explained. “Sorry,

On the morrow he looked
round and was pleased to find
the little harbour full of strange

his camera with him, but he
had not carried it far when a
Naval policeman was sorry but
he had to confiscate it. He
was asked for a registration card
again several times and to ex-
plain why, being apparently

unregistered and not in uniform.
So he gave it up. He hit off
the right day and time at last,
and purchased three of the most

Then he bought a time-table
and looked up a train and a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHARITABLE INTERPRE-
TATIONS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-How little do
we yet understand of the habits of our
enemies! It is not by bandying reck-
less accusations that we shall bring
about the equitable peace which we
hope for. For this reason I have been
very thankful to read the following in
a recent issue of the Cologne Gazette,
which disposes once and for all of the
dreadful calumny that the German
officers are capable of using the cat-o'-
nine-tails to encourage and inspire
their men —
“The glorious citizen army of Herr Asquith
is apparently not accustomed to thoroughly
cleansing its uniforms. Otherwise the object
of the nine-tailed whip could not be so com-
pletely unknown.”
(The slight note of asperity will be
gladly overlooked in the circumstances).
This effectively disposes of the stories,
related by prisoners, of Prussian officers
belabouring their men with the cat.
Even the uniforms of privates in so
punctilious an army must need dust-
ing, and there could be no more con-
venient method.
Would it be too much to say that
cleanliness is the leading passion of the
German Army, whether in the field or
in the houses in which they are billeted?
Had that fact been borne in mind we
should not have fallen into another
similar error with regard to what have
been termed (even in official messages)
“Flame-projectors.” The simplest ex-
planation is generally the best. One
has only to ask how the Turkish
carpets and costly tapestries that
furnish the front-line dug-outs of the
enemy are to be kept in decent order
without a liberal use of vacuum-k
cleaners.
And, again, may we not assume that
the bludgeons, studded with projecting
nails, of which we have read as being
used in hand-to-hand conflict by the
Germans, and which a Paris newspaper
has rashly termed “the weapon of the
apache rather than the soldier,” are
entirely innocent in intention ? It
would be idle to deny that they may
be snatched up absent-mindedly in the
heat of battle, but is it not clear that
their proper office is to be used at
physical drill as Indian clubs? The
presence of the projecting nails is
easily explained and shows the usual
Teutonic thoroughness. It would tend
to correct slipshod work and render the
performer less likely to hit himself
carelessly about the head.
I think it will be found, if we can
get rid of this terrible atmosphere of
suspicion, that other simple explana-
tions will be forthcoming. I do not

wish to dogmatize. I have no sufficient
knowledge. But let us consider the
German use of poisons in many forms.
It will be found, l think, that their
raison-d'étre is horticultural, though I
again admit that in the heat of battle
they may be diverted to combative
purposes. It cannot be easy to grow
either primroses or mustard and cress
in the trenches without the use of
weed-killers. And surely the horrible
suggestion that Germans have been
found chained to their machine-guns
is wide of the mark. I am not closely
acquainted with the machine-gun (far
from it), but I understand it to be a
complicated piece of mechanism. May
they not have become inadvertently
involved in it 2 -

amiable the War would soon be over.

[AUGUST 16, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PINCH OF WAR.
I CAME across him on the rim of the
bog. He stood before a whitewashed
cabin glaring fiercely over the brown
world. ' -
A coal-black dudeen hung empty and
bottom up from his puckered mouth,
a rumpled frieze cap was perilously
balanced a-top of a fringe of white hair.
His full figure, upholstered in a worn
velvet waistcoat, was thrust well for-
ward as if daring Fate to hit it another
blow.
At the moment he was acting as a
scratching-post to a large white billy-
goat, which chafed itself luxuriously to
and fro against his straddled legs. At
the sound of my horse's hoofs he turned
his head. At the sight of my uniform
his eyes brightened, he withdrew a
smutty hand from a corduroy pocket
and made a travesty of a salute to-
wards his cap, which almost lost its
balance.
“Hey! Good day to ye, Captain ' "
(I am a second-lieutenant, but in Ire-
land every lance-corporal has visionary
batons on his shoulder-straps.)
I replied suitably, agreed that the
weather was fine for the second and
trusted, if we were good, we might have
an hour of it.
“How is it wid the War this mornin',
yer honour?”
I replied that, as far as I knew, it
was still there, had passed a quiet night
and was doing nicely, thanks.
“Was you ever at the Front, Cap-
tain 2"
I nodded, and at that his eyes
gleamed.
“Begob l—then 'tis yerself has the
luck. Wait till I tell you a minute.
I'm afther wishin' be all the Blessed

meself would be the first afther them
German Daygoes—I would so, the
dirthy, desthroyin' blagyards ! Tell
me now, Captain dear, did you ever

He hung on my answer to such an
extent that the white billy tore a tatter
from his canvas coat and ate it un-
rebuked.
I wagged my head.

“Och, shure, no ! What would a
grand gentleman like yourself be
wantin' wid such dirthy work—'tis a
common private's job, so it is. But
was meself twinty year younger 'twould
be a job I would take great delight in
the doin' of it. I would take great
delight in landin' wan o' them blag-
yards a puck wid a bay'net that would
let the daylight through him. I would
have great courage an' delight in a war
wid such as they be, that's the blessed
“Don’t know.—
truth, the dirthy, desthroyin', mur-
dherin' divils' Arragh. I hate them "
He shook a grimy fist in the general
direction of America, and the billy,
undisturbed, reached up and ate an-
other ribbon off his coat.
“Beggin' yer pardon, but will yer
honour be goin' back to the War?”
I said I hoped so some day.
“Listen, then—I'm wishin'ye would
kill a German, two Germans, d'ye hear
me now 2 Two Germans I'm afther
wishin' ye.”
Again he brandished a trembling fist
aloft and again the billy, fearing naught,
grazed its way up his back.
“Thanks, very good of you,” said I.
“I’ll remember. Good day.”
“Good day it is, an' God save yer
honour!”
Then with an overwhelming burst of
generosity he promoted me two ranks
at once and wished again.
“Colonel,” he said solemnly, though
shaking with passion, “I'm afther
wishin', ye three — ten — fifteen Ger-
mans !”
“Thanks,” I said again, and picked
up the reins, wondering if tragedy had
shadowed the bogside that morning, if
some grey-eyed, black-haired boy would
come home no more from Flanders to
that whitewashed cabin.
As I turned a beshawled girl poked
her head round the door lintel and
smiled at me.
“Och, faith, don't be noticin' the
granda', yer honour; himself was be-
yond to the town this mornin', an'
they've riz the price o' porther on him

Up from the marshes where the mill

The High Street clambers, looking down
On willows, weirs, and water-lilies.
What goblin homes those gradients
bear,
Doors that for all their new deface-
ments -
Date darkly, windows that out-wear
The centuries shining on their case-
ments'
When Simkin shows you up the street
To pay a bill or post a letter,
Your urgency infects his feet,
He speeds as well as you, or better;
Moulding his Lilliputian stride
To your swift footfall's emulation
He walks unwavering by your side
Until you reach your destination.
Simkin, the urchin with the shock
Of curls rush-hatted, plainly preaches
The Age of Reason in a smock
And Liberty in holland breeches,
Yet all obediently he'll ramp
Against the counter, pressing closer
To watch you lick a ha'penny stamp
Or see you settle with the grocer.
But once your steps retrace the town
And “Home's " the goal your folly
mentions -
A thousand projects of his own
Engage the sum of his attentions—
As when, precariously superb,
He mounts with two-year-old ac-
tivity
The great stone horse-block by the curb
Time-worn to glacial declivity.
Then debonair and undebarred
By the old hound, its casual sentry,
He dallies in “The Old George" yard
And greets the jackdaw in the entry;
Retracted to the street, he gains
A sombre door no sunshine mellows,
The smithy, where there glows and
WanoS
Fire, at the bidding of the bellows.
A-tip-toe at the infrequent shops
Toys or tin kettles he appraises,
Seeds in bright packets, lollipops,
Through the dim oriels' greenish
lazes;
Then with two sturdy hands he shakes
The stripling sycamore that dapples
With shade the side-walk and awakes
Some ancient memory of apples.
Next he rejoins, beneath a sky
With willow-leaves and gnats a-
quiver,
The dapper martins where they ply
A clayey traffic by the river;
Watches the minnows in the warm
Near shallows with a smile per-
suading—
He could not come to any harm
On such a heaven-sent day for wading!
Home's gained at last. At last they
cease,
Coaxes, entreaties, threats, coercions;
An old gate's iron fleurs-de-lis
Shut upon Simkin's last diversions.
The garden crossed, the door stands
wide,
And, pouting like a wronged immortal,
But passive as a Roman bride,
Simkin is lifted through the portal.
“The Misses — gained great praise for
their Russian dance in approximate costume.”

[AUGUST 16, 1916.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 7th.--The House
of Commons has been saddened by the
untimely death of Sir ARTHUR MARKHAM.
During his tempestuous career he had
come into collision with nearly every
prominent Member of the IHouse. Yet
the kindliness that underlay his cut-
ward ferocity was universally recog-
mised, and there was complete sincerity
in the tributes paid to his memory by
representatives of every party.
I see that one of his friends has
described him as “the Greek Chorus
of the House of Commons.” A simile
less apt could hardly be imagined. The
Chorus—I quote from a dictionary de-
finition—“acted the part of a dispas-
sionate and right-minded spectator,
inculcating the lessons of morality and
resignation.” MARKHAM was never dis-
passionate and he was often wrong-
headed. Furthermore, he was never
lugubrious, as the Chorus generally
was, and he rarely waited to deliver
his remarks until the principal actor
had delivered his speech, but blurted
out immediately whatever came into
his mind. Some of his popularity was
probably owing to this habit, for he
often said about bores and humbugs
what his more timid colleagues thought
but were afraid to say.
By a strange coincidence the principal
business of the day was the Army Act
(Amendment) Bill, of which MARKHAM
was, in a sense, the begetter. Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE has rarely displayed
to more advantage his talent for
steering an awkward craft through
the Parliamentary quicksands. He
proposed to dilute a Military Court of
Inquiry with two civilian members,
preferably Members of Parliament or
Peers; he wanted to get the Bill
through all its stages that day; and
he was particularly anxious to avoid
stating the circumstances that made
this haste desirable.
At first his task, appeared hopeless.
Army Members did not see why a
purely military court should not suf-
fice; rigid Constitutionalists like Mr.
HEALY objected to the House placing
any of its members at the disposal of
a military tribunal; and there seemed
to be a general desire to worm out the
details of the scandal, if scandal there
was, before the Bill was allowed to
pass. With infinite patience and tact
the WAR SECRETARY managed to placate
the objectors without liſting more than
a very small corner of the curtain.
Tuesday, August 8th.-Before party-
politics died the death, it was no un-
common sight to see a batch of House
of Commons messengers advancing to
the Table bearing huge packages of
paper containing the signatures of
a petition praying “this honourable
House” to do something or other,
which in most cases there was precious
little chance of its doing. I hope the

During Question-time mention was
made of the Australian Common-
wealth's intention to spend twenty
millions sterling in settling ex-soldiers
on the land. Thoughts of this munifi-
cent scheme kept intruding on the mind
as I listened to the prolonged discussion
of the British Government's proposals
for Naval and Military pensions. It
may be quite true, as Mr. HAYEs-FISHER
said, that the scale proposed is more
generous than that of any country after
any war. But there has never been a
war like this, and, but for the millions of
men who have sacrificed everything to
go and fight, there would be no country
left. The House is not often in sym-
pathy with Mr. Hogg|E, but I think he
expressed the general opinion when
he said that the State should provide
all the money that the soldier or his
dependants ought to have.
Mr. McKENNA, who has already un-
dertaken to provide seven and a half
millions for supplementary pensions,
undertook that more would be forth-
coming if necessary. His only object,
he declared, was to get a working
scheme established while the House
was in a generous mood, and before the
inevitable “cold fit" had set in aſter
the War.
Wednesday, August 9th.-Mr. BIRRELL
had one great merit as Chief Secretary
for Ireland. His answers to the numer-
ous questions addressed to him were
invariably audible all over the House.
Mr. DUKE would perhaps not be well ad-
vised to imitate his predecessor in every
respect, but in this at least he should
strive to emulate him. At present he
is a little inclined to mumble his replies.
There was no hesitation, however, in his
warning to the Dublin Metropolitan
Police—some of the members of which
admirable body have recently shown a
tendency to get out of hand—that they
must lay their grievances before the
constituted authorities, and not seek
the aid of politicians, however eminent.
Mr. BILLING seized the occasion fur-
nished by the Zeppelin raid to take the
air again, but his flight was not con-
spicuously successful. Major BAIRD,
who answers for the Air Board, quietly
remarked that these unfortunate inci-
dents could not be avoided, and that no
one knew better than the Germans how
greatly we had improved our defences.
But this was not enough for Mr. BIL-
LING, who then sought to move the
adjournment of the House, and was
evidently chagrined when only four or
five Members, instead of the necessary
forty, rose to support him.
Although, as Mr. Bon AR LAw told
his Unionist supporters (and critics)
this afternoon, the Coalition still holds
the field it no longer exercises an un-

restricted initiative. The Opposition is
much more active and critical than it
was. To-day the Government pro-
posed to suspend the eleven o'clock
rule, with a view to proceeding, after
the House had had its fill of Scottish
Estimates, with a trio of Irish Bills.
Sir Edward CARsoN (with him Mr.
HEALY) flatly declined to have the
affairs of his country discussed in the
small hours. He would sooner sit upon
a Friday—a prospect little relished by
his fellow-members, most of whom
have come to look upon Friday as a
statutory holiday. Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
was so perturbed by this threat that he
forthwith abandoned the motion.
Thanks to the Duke of SUTHERLAND,
Mr. TENNANT made a promising début
as Secretary for Scotland. He an-
nounced this evening that His Grace
had presented to the Government an
estate of 12,000 acres for the settlement
of soldiers and sailors who had done
good service to the State. All that is
now wanted is that the DUKE should
take a tour round the British Isles and
bite all the other great landlords.
Thursday, August 10th.-The House
of Commons is a curiously imitative
assembly. There is hardly a Member
on one side who has not his double on
the other; and any little innovation in
costume is promptly received with the
sincerest form of flattery, There has
been a perfect epidemic of grey tall hats
with broad black bands since Mr. WATT
and Mr. Hogg|E appeared one day in
this headgear.
The latest victim of the sartorial
plagiarist is Mr. T. P. O'Connor. A
few days ago he signalized the return
of the hot weather by appeariñg in a
hat of unusual appearance—a sort of
straw “wide-awake,” as our fathers
used to call that particular shape.
This afternoon Mr. Booth arrived in a
hat precisely similar in shape, material
and colour. As Mr. Booth occupied
the corner seat on the third bench be-
low the Gangway on the Ministerial
side, while Mr. O'Connor sat in the
exactly corresponding position on the
Opposition side, the House for a few
moments presented a charming sym-
metry—until “T. P.,” resenting, per-
haps, Mr. Booth's duplicity, walked
out and spoiled it.
The apparent ease with which the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER finds
the money for the enormous outgoings
of the War is a weekly wonder. Still
he has his critics, who assert that
there are too many “floaters” about.
Sir CHARLEs HENRY, indeed, artlessly
suggested that the CHANCELLOR should
at once indicate his intention to issue
another loan. Needless to say Mr.
McKENNA declined the invitation. He
might have to resort to a loan later,
but meanwhile he was quite content
with his Treasury Bills. In fact he
spoke with as much affection of his
“yearlings” as if he were a breeder of
thoroughbred stock.

You know, I say, these wayward folk
(Whether they're birds or babes or
what not),
Who love to have their little joke,
The point of which their victims
spot not.
Well, that's the kind I was in youth—
Branded a “brat, by all that's
cussèd ' ". . .
And now I feel there may be truth
In what, so oft, my ancient nuss said.
For still the same old game goes on ;
The world has changed and times
are stirring;
My editor, guessing where I've gone,
Waits for a hint of warplanes whir-
ring,
Of guns that bellow, shells that whizz,
And all the thrills he thinks I've
penned him;
These are the hopes I know are his—
And here's the sort of stuff Isend him
A WRONG 'UN.
I FIND myself in the market-place
of , Saturday night, on a journal-
istic mission to see if the working
classes are spending extravagantly.
A stout lady says to a cheesemonger,
“It's no good asking me tenpence-
'apenny, me lad. I can get it better
and stronger for tenpence.”
“I’ll eat all the tenpenny cheese
you can bring 'ere, Mother.”
“Cut me 'arf-a-pound at tenpence
and 'old your noise.”
The cheesemonger holds his noise
and cuts the half-pound. Not much
proof of extravagance here. However,
I see a cheap-jack get up on a chair.
He is flanked by rolls of linoleum.
Perhaps the people's money is being
wasted on household furnishing. The
cheap-jack looks up through a roll of
linoleum at the sky. “Orl right, ladies,”
he calls. “Safe from the Zeps 'ere.
Look at my anti-aircraft-gun. Now
rally round the ole flag, all you 'oo 're
on munitions or over military age. I
don't lower myself by selling my lino
to anyone 'oo's got to be conscripted.”
“He’s right,” confides a lady, who
is embracing a large haddock, to me.
“I’ve four at the Front meself.”
I am not quite sure that he is right.
From the quality of the linoleum I
think it ought to be confined to con-
script homes.
“Before I starts selling,” says the
cheap-jack, “I’ll give you a free tip
'oo's goin' to win the War. It's the
British Army, because they're stickers.
They'll last as long as my lino.”
The crowd murmurs approval. I can't
help hoping that the Army will last just
a trifle longer than the linoleum.
“Now 'ere,” holding up a roll of
which pink peonies seem to form the
pattern, “oo'll brighten up the dear
old kitch for Pa when 'e comes 'ome
from munitions 2 "
A lady announces that she is dis-
posed to spend ninepence in this estim-
able work. A rash rival mounts to
one-and-three, and the roll is thrust
into her arms. -
“You see, friends, I can sell cheap
because I pinch all my stuff. That's
'ow I do it at the price.”
This sally is received with much joy,
especially by a genial policeman in the
background.
“Now 'oo'll bid for this fine roll—all
of ten yards. Cover the 'ouse cheap.
Make the 'ome 'appy.”
“'Arf a dollar,” says a muzzy gentle-
man amiably.
The roll is knocked down to him
before his mouth has properly closed.
He produces the money, shoulders the
roll, turns round to say, “Good night,
all,” and the roll, sweeping round as he
turns, works devastation among hats.
Mine, of course, has gone. I trace his
progress by expostulations. Finally
there is a scrimmage in the distance.
I gather that the muzzy gentleman
has added a policeman's helmet to his
collection. - -
“This is the chance of a lifetime,”
says the cheap-jack, fixing me with
his eye. “Ten yards of best painted
lino guaranteed to last for ever. 'Oo
says two bob” ”
Someone does; two-and-three follows.
The auctioneer's eye bores into me like
a gimlet. I lower my eyes so that I
shall not be hypnotised into buying.
“Two-and-nine, gent in front,” says
the auctioneer, pointing to me.
“I say,” I protest, “I didn't—”
“It's yours, Sir, all right,” says the
auctioneer. “I brought my 'ammer
down jus' as you winked. The lady
bid three bob jus’ after it 'd fallen. But
I'm not the man to sell my honour for
thrippence.”
What am I to do with the hideous
roll 2 I have a great idea.
“Here,” I say, “put it up for auction
for the Red Cross.”
“Right-O. Now 'oo'll bid a bob for
this for the wounded soldiers? You,
Ma, an' you'll give it back to be sold
again. Good ole Mal "
The roll is sold a dozen times in five
minutes. Finally a very worn old lady
buys it.
“That'll do. No, Mother, you don't
give it back. You've got a sick 'usband
and a wounded son. You deserves the
bargain of the century. Thirteen bob,
friends all. Wot's it to be spent in 2"
There is a general murmur of “Fags.”
“'Ere,” whispers the cheap-jack to
me, “you take it, Mister.”
“No, you buy the cigarettes,” I said.
“You’d best, Mister,” he whispered.
“You see that sale's done in my crowd's
brass a bit an' I shall be short to-mor-
rer. I've a awful thirst of a Sunday.
It'd be six to four on me blueing it in.”
I have entitled my tale “A Wrong
'Un,” and he certainly did do me out
of two-and-nine. But the next time
I tell it I think I shall call it “A
Right 'Un.”
MEETING THE FOOD PROBLEM.
A NUMBER of experiments are being
made at our suburban tables for check-
ing the ardour of the hungry. One
clever woman contrives once or twice
a week to introduce the evening meal
with something which completely takes
away her husband's appetite — the
butcher's bill for the month, or an hors
d'ouvre in which a penny egg has been
concealed, or an accidental application
of cod-liver oil to the soup, or some
other little thing. She saves on his
breakfasts by deferring them until a
time when it is impossible for him both
to eat his food and to catch his train.
An elderly bank-clerk of iron will,
while continuing to devote not less
than twelve minutes to his breakfast
each morning, has formed a war-time
habit of masticating each mouthful
thirty-seven times, to the beat of a
slow-moving metronome.
Shops are now showing inexpensive
appliances which will help materially
to reduce the consumption of food.
One of the neatest inventions for this
purpose is the revolving carving-knife,
with a blade that is loose in the handle
and slips round when pressure is brought
to bear upon it.
There is sure to be a steady sale for
a series of neat little ivorine tablets,
fitted with skewers and clips, for attach-
ing to joints or dishes. These bear
inscriptions, such as:—
“Carver, be careful with each slice;
This joint was an appalling price."
“Spread the sugar gently, pray;
Think how dear it is to-day.”
“Steady with the cheese,
If you please.”
A new line in “war-time dishes"
consists of imitation cakes, jellies, gal-
antines, etc. Being washable they can
be used again and again.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Though you may have lately been somewhat overfed
with War books, I must urge upon you to spare the shilling
which is the modest price of yet one more, a slender volume
called From Dartmouth to the Dardanelles (HEINEMANN).
It is, as the sub-title explains, the log of a midshipman,
edited by his mother; impressions of life on active service
by a boy serving “in His Majesty's Fleet, with a real live
enemy close at hand.” It would be hard to over-praise the
charm of them or their astonishing vitality—astonishing
most of all when one remembers that the writer was barely
sixteen. At times indeed some reminder of this youthful-
ness (among such manly work!) will assail the reader with
a kind of shock, as for example when a thrilling story of
a bombardment is followed by that of a “ripping tea,"
given to the writer by a lady in Durban who had a son at
Osborne. I fancy that must have been a pleasant meal for
the lady, if her guest talks as he writes. One gets the
happiest, most heartening picture of him and his fellows
from this record, which for its unaffected simplicity deserves
to be widely welcomed. Now and then perhaps the com-
ments of the editor seem a little sentimental; but what
mother in the world wouldn't be sentimental under like
circumstances ! She tells us that she has left her son's
manuscript practically untouched; it is clear therefore that
he has a gift of words that may in the future provide us
with other writing by the same hand. For the present,
however, and for what it has already done, Mr. Punch
would like, metaphorically, to take that very capable young

hand in his own, and proudly, a little enviously, and with
the suspicion of a lump in his throat, to shake it in gratitude
and appreciation.
Priests in the Firing Line, by RéNÉ GAELL (LoNGMANs),
gives an interesting glimpse of the life of the poilu-padre
in the armies of France. It is written from the material of
a priest's letters by a brother priest left at the base. The
former, DUROY, who died from wounds after receiving the
much coveted decoration for valour, writes simply and
sincerely of the faith and hope that are in him, and inform-
ingly of the fine men and the dread things about him.
Perhaps his friend rhapsodises overmuch for our self-
conscious taste, but neither this nor the excess of zeal with
which the translators have Englished the slang of the gay
piou-piou need baulk the reader. The French padre, often
detailed for ambulance work, has been in very many cases
an actual combatant and escapes none of the hard routine
of the ranks, adding to it the duties of his spiritual office.
One can well imagine the momentary hesitation of a priest
who found his opportunity to creep forward and silently
strangle a German sentry. France in the hour of danger
has been served by her priests better than she served them
in the time of peace. They have taken a great revenge
which will win more reverence for the black soutane when
the fighting men come home.
It isn't perhaps unfair to guess that Mr. R. Scotland

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
On the Russian Front (SIMPKIN), just as he had contrived
to get On the Track of the War in Belgium in the capacity
of a quite casual and unattached hospital orderly in the
early unorganised days of the Red Cross service. Well, it
is always pleasant to hear a gallant and sufficiently modest
man talk interestingly about big events. His biggest was
the Russian retreat last summer and the fall of Warsaw.
It is indeed an encouraging narrative. If the Russians,
desperately ill-equipped as they were, could stand such
awful hammering without being broken, there is little they
won't be able to do in these days of their recovery, when
fairly matched in material with their enemy. Mr. LIDDELL
saw in a certain hospital eight hundred wounded German
prisoners, all wounded with the bayonet alone. Their
captors, who had lost immeasurably more heavily, had
fought up to the enemy trenches practically without ammu-
nition. Constantly he testifies to the fine fighting qualities
of the Russian infantryman. T ~ T
Also he records his soldierly
kindness of heart and deed, es-
pecially to his prisoners, and
(to make the picture complete)
he mentions some of his little
foibles. He photographed the
man PILUGIN, whose tongue
the Germans slit because he
would not betray the Russian
dispositions to his captors, from
whom he afterwards escaped.
It isn't a pleasant picture,
but it is evidence. There are
throughout the book excellent
illustrations, the work of a
man who knows how to use
his camera.

words, she seems to have fulfilled the great object of life
and outlived her disillusions. Under such headings as
“The Cost of Modern Sentiment,” “Our Loss of Nerve,”
and “The Repeal of Reticence,” you find her dealing
shrewdly with tendencies of thought and sentiment as she
observes them in present-day America: especially senti-
ment, which indeed appears to be her special bugbear.
The idea that everyone must be happy at any cost, that it
is a sad thing to be compelled to earn one's living by the
sweat of one's brow, and that nobody should be punished
for anything—these are some of the sentimental theories
(“revolts from the despotism of facts”) that come under
her lash. One may not always agree, but that is another
matter. At times Dr. REPPLIER has been betrayed by her
own earnestness into unconscious humour, as, for example,
when, urging the dignity of domestic service, she speaks of
“visions of a trim and white-capped parlourmaid dancing
-- - before her eyes,” which I do
not think that parlourmaids are
expected to do even in New

book to present to some elderly
relative, who will rejoice at such

Counter Currents (CoNSTABLE) is an odd and unexpected lit-

REPPLIER. I call it unexpected, because of the attitude
of the writer, who is so far advanced that with regard
to most debated problems of the day she has (so to
speak) come out on the other side, and passionately urges
views that twenty years ago were old-fashioned. In other
wards directly the War is over, but all the same it cannot

just now I suggest that you purloin two or three hours

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(HERR roN BETHMANN-HollyEG and BARON BURIAN.)
Baron Burian. The fact is, my dear Chancellor, that we
were perhaps just a little too precipitate in our declarations
and our actions. War isn't a picnic, you know.
Bethmann-Hollweg. I know exactly what you are going
to say. You think my august one took the bit in his teeth
and ran away down-hill at top speed.
Baron B. Your Imperial master certainly was in a most
tremendous hurry. Our conversations with Russia were
getting on quite nicely, thank you, when suddenly he begins
to fling ultimatums about as if they were birthday-wishes
or something of that sort, instead of being the deadly and
irrevocable things they are. What was the use of it? That
is a question I have been asking for some time, and as yet
I have had no answer to it. -
B.-H. Oh, come, come! Really that isn't quite fair.
You were yourselves not so very backward with your
ultimatum to the Serbians. A very stiff document that
was, with its violent demands and its short time-limit.
Baron B. Well, you knew all about it before it was sent
in. You told me yourself it was a masterpiece, and your
august one, as you call him, was just as enthusiastic as you
about it. Didn't he say it would bring the Russians to their
senses to see so manly and vigorous a declaration ?
B.-H. Oh, I don't know what he said at the time. He
says so many things and gets so angry when affairs go
wrong that it's no more use talking to him than to a spoilt
child. He insisted, for instance, on going through Belgium,
as the Generals desired, though I assured him that such a
step would mean war with England. “Pooh,” he said,
“England is played out. She is on the brink of civil war
in Ireland; her navy is over-rated; she has no army worth
mentioning. She will make a little fuss and then resign
herself. We shall be able to bluff her; and you,” he added,
pointing his finger at me, “are the man to do it.” Well, I
did my best, but I knew it was wasted labour before I
started. Then, when the English decided not to be bluffed
and insisted on making the invasion of Belgium a casus
belli, you should have seen his fury. He destroyed three
Dresden-china vases and a marble bust of BISMARCK–threw
them at me, you know, one after another; but I ducked,
not, I fear, very gracefully, and they broke in pieces on the
wall behind. The EMPRESs came running in in a high state
of alarm to see what had happened, and then he calmed
down somewhat. You're a lucky man BURIAN, not to have
to deal at first hand with such a crack-brained, impetuous,
violent fellow as this Imperial master of mine. You are on
velvet with your old man.
Baron B. So far as that goes I haven't much to com-
plain of. The old man in nine cases out of ten is quite
manageable, but in the tenth case the devil and all his
legions couldn't move him. Still, he's a kind old party
and it grieves me to see him so broken down by the mis-
fortunes of the War and the jealousies of the Archdukes.
I wish the whole gang of them could be shipped off to
a desert island—KARL, Joseph, FERDINAND, SALVATOR,
FRANCIs and all the rest of them.
B.-H. Oh, you're not so badly off as you imagine. At
any rate you may think yourself lucky that you're not
cursed with my whipper-snapper of a Crown Prince. For
downright undiluted nothingness and immeasurable con-
ceit you couldn't find his equal in the whole world.
Baron B. Ah, I daresay he's a tough customer.

million good Germans at the very least; he has gained no
military object of the least importance, and he's as proud

Baron B. Certainly the War altogether is not going
very well. -
B.-H. Alas, I agree with you. The Russians are still
alive and the Italians are moving.

peace. Personally I'm thinking of retiring and cutting the

WHEN fiery youth innerved my frame with vigour
I worshipped Mars, our good old tribal god,
And pushed his cult with unrelenting rigour:
In all his ways I trod.
All owned my strength, my skill, my erudition,
My godlike wisdom and my sterling worth; |
Clear to probation was my heavenly mission,
Namely, to rule the earth.
Yet earth was stubborn, and each purblind neighbour
Prayed hard to Peace—prayed morning, noon and night,
And looked astonished when l waved the sabre :
He did not want to fight.
All very well; but who has had his innings -
Must yield his place whilst others smite the ball;
Only the strong may hope to hold their winnings—
The weak go to the wall.
Die Zeit bringt Rosen. In a splendid quarrel,
Handled superbly and with all despatch,
I forced a war on those who took all war ill,
And started off at scratch.
And West and East I marched in triumph, dealing
Tremendous blows that echoed to the skies, -
And smashed the hostile hordes, or sent them reeling
And filling earth with lies. :
Well, I have won. My gains are great and glorious,
And now I would this bitter strife might cease;
Mars having served my turn, I, the Victorious,
Loathe war and yearn for Peace.
But—curséd spite l—these foes who used to whimper,
Nay, fight for Peace but two short years agone,
Knowing, I fear, my arm is growing limper,
Still keep on keeping on.
O lovely Peace, my soul thou hast converted
Now that I love thee, grant, oh grant this boon—
Convert the rest, that Mars may be deserted,
And oh, let it be soon |
In an article on War Economy The Daily Chronicle
refers to—
“The unquestioned fact that in the world of provisions, at all

before the war.”

[AUGUST 23, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ONE TOUCH OF NATURE.
DINNER being over at the Royal
Bellevue we were seated in The Lounge,
singly or in little compact isolated
groups, lolling as becomes respectable
English holiday makers on Sunday
evening, sipping coffee and smoking.
The groups murmured in the usual cau-
tious whispers; the solitary Loungers
either read or contemplated infinity.
There was no camaraderic. We did
| not know each other; we were islets in
the estranging sea, and the TT
majority of us were glad to
be so. Most of the men were
dressed; most of the women
were in confections; but here
and there was a man in a
light suit of tweed or flannel,
who was tacitly but unani-
mously voted poor form, and
here and there was an officer
in khaki, as he was entitled
to be, with his head close to
that of a Super Beauty. For
officers now have all the luck.
I do not say that here and
there a member of one group
might not harbour the wish
to join another, or that the
solitary Loungers never cast
eyes in each others' direction;
for even in Loungers hearts
beat. But so far there had
been no blending; we were
all on our dignity, or our
guard, as the case may be ;
all very English and aloof.
By-and-by we should get up
and move carefully and self-
consciously from the room,
winding our way among the
little tables and the big chairs
and the palm-trees, and either
go for another walk on the
promenade or soar upwards
in the lift to bed. The ladies
in confections would leave
The Lounge in couples, talk-
ing brightly together; the
gentlemen in evening dress would have
their hands in their pockets. But no
strangers would have become acquaint-
ances — that is certain. Not at the
Royal Bellevue. It would need some-
thing very untoward to effect that.
(I don't pretend that we were ignor-
ant of each other because so pinnacled.
That would be going too far, even at
the Royal Bellevue. We knew in fact
a good deal, thanks to the head waiter,
the hall porter, the manager, and our
trusty auriculars. But that is a side
issue.)
Two of the flannel-clad men, I should
add, were further outraging us by talk-
ing above a whisper and laughing loudly
in the tone that indicates to the trained
ear that something stronger than Aqua laughed, the whole Lounge laughed ;
Pura, 1916, excellent as that vintage then the members of the various groups
might be, had accompanied their tale cºught each other's eyes and, instead

ner, and we were relieved when they The two contiguous groups nearest me
rose and went upstairs, for they made moved their chairs closer, and the bald
us nervous. The stairs, I should say, man in the dinner-jacket, who had been
mounted upwards from the corner of longing to have a word with the young
The Lounge and were visible for some wife of an officer in Mesopotamia, re-
twenty steps.
Upon their departure peace and re-

finement again reigned. We returned
to our discreet exchange of remarks,
our reading, or our contemplative
meditations. Even more securely we
wrapped ourselves in our frigid and
superior segregation.
And then suddenly the something
untoward happened. One of the noisy
men, returning from the upper regions,
slipped as he descended the stairs, and
in full view of The Lounge fell three or
four steps with resonant and ignomini-
ous bumps. He gave us one hurried
glance, realised that he had cut a very
poor figure, and scrambled away bruised
and humiliated.
But he had served his purpose. The
effect was magical. First of all we
marked to her that the slipperiness of
the stairs would no doubt be the scape-
T goat, and, on her agreeing
with a laugh adequate to the
jest, he said that it was a
comfortable hotel—take it all
round as comfortable a hotel
as there was in the town, and
she agreed again. Then he
said that in past years he had
always stayed either at the
Grand or the Suffolk, but now
and henceforward this was
his seaside home. That is, of
course, so long as he came to
the South Coast. When the
War was over no doubt he
should go to Cromer again.
By this time he was launched,
and we may leave him in his
long-desired bliss.
| The elderly lady in a toupee
or transformation, who was
known to be the widow of a
South African magnate and
was always in the company
of two daughters-in-law and
one Pekinese, laughed in the
direction of the single lady
with the many diamond rings
who always read The Morn-
ing Post in the same chair,
and hoped that she had had
a pleasant ride this morning;
and the lady, who regularly
wore a habit at breakfast and
mounted a sedate hack at
ten-thirty, said that it was
quite good because she had
found a new-strip of turf for
a gallop; and so they passed genially
to the discussion of what a delightful
thing it is to come upon anything new
and thus vary routine.
And suddenly at my ear I was con-
scious of a fluffy voice remarking that
that was a nasty fall. A man, it went
on, could be injured for life in that
way. In fact it had once known a man,
an Oxford Blue, who had been perma-
nently crippled by falling on the stairs
just like that. It hurried on to ask me
if I had been on the links to-day. The
speaker was the solitary grey gentle-
man who had a table near mine.
replied that I was not a golfer. There
are good links here, he continued. Not
that he was a great performer himself,

but a round did one good. One got the
exercise and the fresh air. For him-
self he preferred the links at Littleton,
and so forth.
And everywhere else among the
palm-trees and the big chairs and the
little tables voices were buzzing and
barriers breaking.
Now, had a gentleman not taken just
enough stimulant to render his feet a
little independent of perfect muscular
control, we should still be the poorer
by all these confidences. So let the
good work go on 1
A FANTASY OF NEW FRUITS.
[The author of a recent book on fruit culture
describes successful experiments in producing
new varieties, amongst which he mentions the
plum-cot, a blend of the plum and apricot.]
TIRED of the everlasting round
Of too familiar fruits,
Long have I sought but never found
Efficient substitutes.
The loganberry caused a small
And transitory thrill,
But rapidly began to pall:
It never filled my bill.
But now I hear, with ear alert,
Of graftings rich and strange
Designed to vary my dessert
With unexpected change—
Of plums with apricots allied,
And other cunning blends,
Which show Mendelian laws applied
To gustatory ends.
Already with prophetic eye
I see myself at lunch
Partaking of the damsify,
The pluffle or the plunch :
The luscious cherrypine I hail,
The sleek pomangosteen,
The mulbricot, the melokale,
The melting medlarine.
Science is great; I do not ask
She should abate her claims;
But Art is needed for the task
Of coining compound names.
And if Pomona, heavenly maid,
Is to be honoured duly
Our gardeners might invoke the aid
And culture of Yours truly.
Warm Welcome for a Hero.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
* FOR THIS RELIEF—”
SELDOM in these troublous days
Parliament wins any praise
From the folk outside it.
Rather as a monkey-house,
Or a place where people grouse,
Or a home for freaks and cranks,
Charlatans and mountebanks,
One and all deride it.
Still, to give the deuce his due,
Once in a blue month or two
Parliament quits fooling,
And the sober voice of sense,
Purged of all inconsequence,
Rises clear above the ructions,
All fanatical obstructions
Sternly overruling.
Thus, to take the latest case
Of a brief return to grace,
Parliament has set its face
Hard against the sinners—
Taxi-whistling folk, who keep
Wounded Tommies from their sleep,
And exasperate their neighbours
Who are resting from their labours
After frugal dinners.
True, 'tis nothing much to boast of,
Still, we're bound to make the most of
Evidence that clearly
Proves a House which often tingles
With the screams of HoggEs and
PRINGLES
To be capable of dealing
With another form of squealing
Promptly and severely.
THE GRIST HOUSE.
[With acknowledgments for suggestions
received at the The Gift House,
48 Pall Mall.]
Evelyn has got some steady con-
genial work at last. She is helping at
the Grist House, where they receive and
sell gifts for the benefit of a great and
deserving charity. She is engaged in
selling other people's property at prices
that draw even the dealers. In the
Grist House you can buy anything from
a Great Dane dog to a lock of hair from
the head of MARIE ANToINETTE's maid-
in-waiting. . All these things are given,
or one might almost say extorted, from
citizens who have spent long years in
collecting. Evelyn has taken her de-
gree in the art of extortion. She goes
to a friend's house to dinner in London,
or in the country for a week-end, and
comes away with perhaps a hundred
pounds' worth of pictures, plate, postage-
stamps, pottery, old prints. She takes
these to the Grist House and tickets
them. Every time she is asked out she
brings grist to the Grist House; so
beware.
The men and women who hand over
these things in their generous after-
dinner moods often relent when they
come down to breakfast and look the
matter over in the light of day. Then
they come to the Grist House and buy
them back. They come up from their
country-houses disguised and wearing
false whiskers and false sangfroid. At
the end of the street they remove the
former, and the latter falls from them
automatically. If they are lucky they
strike a day when Evelyn is not on duty
and they are able to buy back their
treasures at a rate that would seem im-
possible if they had time to think about
it at all. If she is there, they come
in with a air of charity, and end up by
buying a great many things that they
have no use for. This is the essence of
the business. It is a great thing to
consolidate the supply and demand
in one person. If you can persuade a
man to give a piece of tapestry worth
£200 and buy it back at double that
price, you are exactly £400 to the good.
I went into the Grist House the other
day and found Evelyn attired in a
holland overall and a disarming smile.
She started on me before I had decided
whether to take off my hat or remain
covered. She tried to sell me a donkey,
a Murillo, a Spanish scarf, a Roman
coin, an autograph letter of Louis XV.
and a pair of boots worn by GEORGE R.
SIMs at the coronation of QUEEN ANNE.
I feigned deafness.
Then a man came in who was ob-
viously a purchaser. He sauntered
down the length of the room and looked
all about him. Evelyn was on to him
like a seagull on to a piece of fish.
“Have you seen this old glass?” she
asked, and dragged him across the
floor. He did not seem interested in
old glass and tried to tell her so, but
she was in no mood to listen. “This
carpet is beautiful, isn't it?” she purred
as she turned over a many-coloured
rug. Still nothing doing. Then she
tried him with a sauce-boat, a Castilian
wedding canopy, a meerschaum pipe
and a pair of jet earrings. All this
time he was trying to speak, but he
had as much chance of getting out
three syllables as a Democratic candi-
date at a Republican meeting in Lame
Dog City, Cal. At last Evelyn stopped
and the man got a word or two in thin-
wise. “I've come about the electric
light,” he said.
Presently she did get a real pur-
chaser. He had picked up a Dresden
group. “That is most interesting,”
said Evelyn impressively; “it is an
ancient piece of Ming chinaware, about
three hundred years before Yuan Shi
Kai. Its price is only thirty guineas.
Shall I wrap it up for you?” “I’m
afraid not,” said the man. “You see I
presented it myself last week. I didn't
know it was Chinese, though,” he said
pleasantly. Again Evelyn was stumped.
They have got to such a state of
perfection in the Grist House that they
can tell what a man's income is to ten
pounds before he has been in a minute.
If the visitor is really well off and runs
into five figures per annum the whole
staff of lady-helpers rises as one woman
and hems him in. For every thousand
you come down one less assistant gets
up. When I go in there is never a
move, and that is as it should be. Two
days ago a man came in wearing an
anxious look and a Harris tweed suit.
He looked a three-figure man at the
most, and Evelyn got up from her seat
and then sat down again languidly.
The man glanced round the various
exhibits, and at last looked rather
inquiringly at Evelyn. She dropped
her book and her blasé look and said
sweetly, “Have you come to look
round 2'' The man said he had, and
asked the price of a diamond necklace.
He was told it was two hundred-and-
fifty pounds, and Evelyn and I watched
to see him faint. Instead he drew out ||
his cheque-book and said, “Who shall |
I make out the cheque to?”
In five minutes he had the whole ||
staff round him. In five more he had
bought an Irish terrier, some Irish lace ||
and an Irish glass dessert-bowl. Then |
he was shown a fly-whisk, a Maori ||
axe, an amethyst intaglio and a Rem- |
brandt. He signed cheques for all |
these. Then Evelyn tried to sell him
his own walking-stick, which he had
put down in a corner. When he left
finally he had come to the last cheque
in his book, and the floor was littered
with his purchases.
Then every now and then there are
quiet immaculately dressed men who
stroll in and pick up the different
articles and put them down again
without a word. They are obviously
dealers in these things, and they wear
the air of a Sergeant of Grenadiers
escorting a batch of “Group 49's " |
past Wellington Barracks. Sometimes
they see something that pleases them
and they allow a little animation to
creep into their sad faces. Then they
take out magnifying-glasses and gaze
long and intently at hall-marks and
initials. Sometimes they sign cheques,
too; but when they do the Grist House
people know that the sale is not one to
be proud of.
One of the greatest works of the
War is being carried on at the Grist
House, and I have yet to meet a man
who was not satisfied with a purchase
made there. Its chief merit to me is
that it keeps Evelyn busy, and now
she need not cut her hair and her
skirts short and don khaki and a Sam

Browne belt. Evelyn always does
things thoroughly, and I am pleased
to say that she is just now going
through her visiting list, putting a
mark against all those people who
have still got some old china or prized
antiques hidden away. If she has her
way all her friends will have exchanged
their collections amongst themselves
before the War finishes. Perhaps,
when peace is declared, they will be
able to sort them out again.

SUBSTITUTES.
THE art of finding substitutes is being
more and more successfully practised
in Germany. By the end of the War
appearances will be very deceptive over
there, because everything will be some-
thing else. Substitutes for leather and
rubber and butter and bread have been
an enormous success. They have found
a substitute for veracity. They are
said to have found a substitute for
International Law. It is an open
secret that they are even now in search
of a substitute for victory. So that it
is no surprise to learn that they are
building substitute submarines. We
read in a Paris paper that—
A third submarine has been bap-
tised the Bremen and is said to
have left for the American coast.
Reliance is being placed on this
faked exploit to give Neutrals a
high opinion of the German Navy.
The original Bremen being now many
weeks overdue, this seems a suitable
way out of an awkward dilemma.
Indeed if the “Submarine Passenger
Service" to America is to continue, as
advertised, to break the blockade, and
if it is true that the submarine liners for
this purpose are now all ready to start,
we think it would be a wise precaution
to call them all the Bremen. In this
way she may perhaps arrive some time
and give Neutrals a high opinion of the
German Navy. It must be clear now
to the German Admiralty that a blun-
der has becn made in differentiating
the units of the Fleet by foolishly
iving to each a name of its own. Had
all the battle cruisers, for instance, been
called the Lutzow there would have
been no need to announce that the
Lutzow had been lost in the Jutland
fight, and thus give Neutrals a low
opinion of the German Navy. Ques-
tions might arise if the same ship was
seen in three different places on the
same day, but either an explanation or
a substitute could be found.
We might perhaps suggest a few
more substitutes which have not yet,
so far as we know, been utilized:—
1. A substitute for Verdun (with the
German Flag flying over it).
2. Substitutes for several German
Colonies.
3. Substitutes for Contalmaison,
Pozières and Delville Wood (badly
needed).
4. A substitute for a new German
offensive to recover the initiative.
5. A substitute for Austria as an ally.
6. Substitutes for Kultur and Organ-
ization and Efficiency and World Power
and the Mailed Fist and the CRowN
PRINCE and the War and the KAISER
and all the things that haven't come
off.

[August 23, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 14th.--The PRIME
MINISTER introduced one Bill to-day
and talked about another. The Bill he
introduced is to extend the life of this
Parliament, due to expire in little more
than a month, until May 31st next.
The Bill he talked about is to establish
a new register in case a General Election
should become necessary on or before
that date.
Taught by Mr. SAMUEL's unhappy
experience a few weeks ago, he did not
attempt to be jocose. He has a knack
of turning stumbling-blocks into step-
ping-stones, and on this occasion laid
so much stress upon the difficulty of
making any alteration in the franchise
without raising the spectre of “Votes
for Women” that the Suffragists behind
the grille made bold to claim him as a
convert.
Although not quite convinced that
the policy of “one gun one vote,” as
Mr. WILL THoRNE put it, was imprac-
ticable, Sir EDward CARSoN was much
more conciliatory than usual, and, in-
fringing the PRIME MINISTER's copy-
right, declared that he would “wait
and see” the Bill before finally con-
demning it.
During Question-time an unseemly
altercation was observed on the Ministe-
rial side below the Gangway. Old Mem-
bers remember the Homeric contest
between Mr. Bowl Es and Mr. GEDGE,
when the latter endeavoured to insinu-
ate “the thick end of the Gedge” into
ToMMY's pet corner-seat. A similar
scuffle now took place between two
Scottish Radicals who skilfully dissem-
ble their affection for one another. Mr.
CowAN's card was in the back of the
seat, Mr. Hogge's person was in the
seat itself. According to the SPEAKER
neither Member had any right to the
seat, for Mr. CowAN had left the pre-
cincts of the House after leaving his
card and Mr. Hogg|E had omitted the
essential condition of attendance at
prayers. Eventually Mr. Hogge re-
tired, murmuring a stanza from the
old comic song—
“’E knocked corners off me this morning,
But I'm waiting for 'im ter-night.”
Colonel YATE is not usually recog-
nised as a humourist, perhaps because
he does not, like Mr. KING and Mr.
PRINGLE, take the precaution of laugh-
ing at his own (alleged) jokes; but he
quite brought down the House to-day
when, jam for the troops being men-
tioned, he quietly asked whether the
contract for plum jam contained a
stipulation that any portion of it.
should be made of plums.
Tuesday, August 15.--Mr. SAMUEL's
Parliamentary vocabulary is notorious
for the superabundance of its sibilants.
This little characteristic was particu-
larly marked to-day when he was re-
quested to suppress the taxi-whistling
nuisance. His reply was a series of
hisses. Otherwise it was quite satis-
factory, for henceforward wounded
soldiers and other sufferers will not
have their night's rest spoiled by the

JAM QUESTION.
ear-splitting and quite unnecessary
shrieks of hotel-porters and page-boys.
Mr. Montagu has been only a month
at the Ministry of Munitions and was
therefore able to review the work of the
Department without laying himself
open to the charge of blowing his own
trumpet. A wonderful record it is.
The Committee was almost stunned by
the tremendous bombardment of figures
that Mr. Montagu poured forth, show-
ing the extraordinay increase in the
output of shells, rifles, machine-guns
and heavy artillery since this time last
year. One fact will suffice as a sample.
HERBERT SAMUEL PUTS THE STOPPER ON.
The weekly consumption of high ex-
plosives by the Army is now between
eleven and twelve thousand times as
much as it was in September, 1914.
Wednesday, August 16th.-Admiral
of the Fleet Sir HEdworth MEUx has
specially requested that his speeches
should not be described as “breezy.”
There is no difficulty in obeying his
injunction in respect of his latest utter-
ance. It was not breezy; it was tem-
pestuous. While Mr. CHURCHILL was
inveighing against the timidity of the
Government in not extending the fran-
chise to sailors and soldiers on service,
and had been explaining to his own
satisfaction how easy it would be to
collect their votes on a battleship or in
the trenches, Sir HEDworth repeatedly
held up his hands in amazement. The
gesture did not escape the House, and
as soon as Mr. CHURCHILL sat down
there were loud cries—one might almost
say catcalls—of “MEUx,” “MEUx.”
The SPEAKER obligingly called on
the hon. and gallant Member, who
thereupon poured salvo after salvo into
poor Mr. CHURCHILL. He finished up
by declaring that half the House wanted
to get rid of the PRIME MINISTER, who
was the cleverest man in it, but for his
part he did not want SoLoMon to be
deposed in favour of a REHoboAM who
would break up the Empire.
came home to roost.
The New Register Bill received
a second reading, after being unmerci-
fully belaboured throughout the debate.
Even the PRIME MINISTER had nothing
better to say of it than that it was
“a halting, lopsided, temporary make-
shift,” and was perhaps not altogether
sorry that the House so readily agreed
with him. It was only in response to
Sir Edward CARson's insistent demand

BoAM, on the Front Opposition Bench,
was visibly uneasy as his scorpions
that the Bill was introduced. The
Government have no desire for a Gen-

—and cannot be expected to enthuse
over any project which makes it easier
to hold one.
Sailors and Soldiers can very well
wait for their votes, but not for their
money. Nearly all the Members pre-
sent, whatever their political labels,
supported Mr. BARNEs when he moved
the adjournment to call attention to
the delays in providing pensions for
the men discharged from public service.
The Government might have found
itself in the same position if a less
tactful Minister than Mr. ForsTER had
been charged with the defence. But
he was so frank in admitting the
delays, so earnest in his promise to

Chelsea Hospital machine, that the
House readily accepted his apology.
Thursday, August 17th.-An Irish
day opened with the presentation of
a petition by the LoRD MAYOR OF
DUBLIN. Mr. HENRY CAMPBELL, the
Town Clerk, who read the document,
must have found the Parliamentary
scene very different from what it was
thirty years ago, when PARNELL was
at his zenith and he one of his most
faithful satellites. To-day barely twenty
Nationalists were present, though three
Bills intimately concerning the welfare
of their country were up for discussion.
Mr. DUKE, when he likes, can be as
lively as anybody—witness his terrific
trouncing of Sir FREDERICK BANBURY
a few months ago. Either the cares
of office have already begun to tell on
him, or he thinks it wise, having regard
to the fate of his predecessor, to avoid
any suspicion of levity. No charge of
that sort could be brought against his
speech commending the Dublin Recon-
struction Bill, which was grave almost
to the point of boredom.
|Under its sedative influence even Mr.
HEALY felt himself in danger of being
dull, and tried without much success to
lash himself into liveliness by the use of
absurdly strong language. Neither he
nor any other Irishman had much good
to say of the Bill, perhaps because the
Dublin Corporation and not the British
Treasury is to find most of the money for
repairing the ruin of Sackville Street.
Yet when it came to a division only five
Members were found to oppose this
much-abused measure. Two other Irish
Bills were also passed. So Mr. DUKE's
soporific method was justified after all.
Much discussion arose over the exact
date to which the life of this Parliament
should be extended. The Government
proposed May 31st, Sir Edward CARSON
preferred March 31st, and, when in-
formed that that date was inconvenient
for financial reasons, suggested “Feb-
ruary 31st.” The PRIME MINISTER
would doubtless have jumped at this
handsome offer, but that some tactless
back-bencher sniggered and caused
Sir Edward to revise his date.
A little lecture on modesty from Mr.
CHURCHILL was suitably acknowledged
by Mr. BonAR LAw, who, unlike his
critic, thought it not unreasonable
that the Government Whips should be
put on for a Government Bill. Mr.
CHURCHILL, who has not had a good
week, shortly afterwards beat a re-
treat, gloomily muttering, “Every puny
whipster gets my sword.”

his puttees were an anxiety to him, and
he thought he detected curious glances

He was on the sands, and in an
unguarded moment he forgot himself.
Two small children playing near had
asked him for the right time, and this
led to an offer on his part to lend a

Two days later he was still an

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE second instalment of The Diary of an English Resident
in Paris (SIMPKIN), which covers the year 1915, has a certain
interest—the interest mainly of imprudent and ill-natured
gossip. There is a good deal that it might be excusable to say
to a crony, less excusable to write, quite inexcusable (and fatu-
ous) to print and publish. Mr. RowLAND STRONG seems in
these queer wild pages that least desirable type, the ponti-
fical clubman posturing before an imaginary fire, explaining
just how imbecile, how traitorous or how cowardly is every-
one, or nearly everyone, responsible for the conduct of the
War on the side of the Allies, particularly England. This
imputation of base motives or conduct extends to quite
obscure folk—so little is our amiable diarist a respecter of
persons. Nor do I find this assumption of superior wisdom
justified by any notable signs of judgment or discretion in
the treatment of preposterous canards. It is fair to say
that his spleen is impartial; the Bosches receive the most
unmitigated gruelling, and if words were halters the Ger-
man resistance would have crumbled for sheer lack of leaders.
Our author wields a ready pen . . . and of course I may be
quite wrong, and it might have been better to put the direc-
tion of the War in the hands of a certain English resident
in Paris.
I have not for some time read a story with so quaintly
old-world a flavour as The Sheltered Sez (LANE). Indeed,
looking back upon it, I am driven to one of two conclusions
—Miss MADGE MEARS, whose former work I considerably
liked, has either been tempted by success to disinter an
early effort from her desk, or she has the gift of sublime
detachment to an extent that might rouse envy in a con-
scientious objector. Here, anyway, she presents to us a
sizable novel, all about a young woman who, being bored
with the restraints and unsympathies of life in the home
circle, runs away and actually earns her own living !
Amazing ! I am far from suggesting that the book is not
well written. All the first part, for instance, is full of those
smartly satiric jibes at the expense of middle-aged relatives
which clever people were making twenty years ago and
have since discarded. But now-a-days Ruth's dash for
freedom, through a door that has so long been wide open
(which indeed the last two years seem to have lifted off its
hinges), has an oddly unreal effect, so that not all Miss
MEARs' genuine abilities are able to give it a more than
antiquarian interest. I can only hope that by this time she
is writing rather more topically about the sex that no one
any longer presumes to shelter.
Books about the EMPRESS EUGENIE still continue, as is
but natural, seeing that the lonely figure at Farnborough
embodies more of the romance and tragedy of history than
any other on the world's stage to-day. The latest of these
is The Empress Eugénie and Her Son (GRANT RICHARDs),
written by Mr. Edward LEGGE, whose name is already
well known to students of the Second Empire. The book
appears at a moment that makes it a kind of celebration of
the ninetieth birthday of Her Majesty, which took place
on May 5th. It is a review of her life and personality,
written by one who knows both intimately. In his preface
Mr. LEGGE disclaims any intention of writing a biography
in “the commonplace method, with dates following each

other in chronological precision.” Before the end, indeed,
you may perhaps feel that his manner reaches the permiss-
ible limits of the discursive. But without doubt he has
included in his volume a vast quantity of interesting infor-
mation. There is just now an especial significance in his
detailed account of how the Germans treated their Emperor-
prisoner. Apparently the Hun idea of duty towards
compulsory guests has deteriorated sadly during the past
half-century. I should not forget to mention that the
volume is illustrated with a large number of photographs.
Despite its deliberately haphazard style, Mr. LEGGE's book
is one that the curious student of the greatest drama of
European history should certainly read, though he may
have to arrange the resulting information for himself.
It may possibly be that the directness and cheerful
mundane receptivity of the stories of O. HENRY in which I
have been revelling have spoiled me for more roundabout
American methods; but I found The Long Divorce (ALLEN
knows more about lepidoptera than I do. Peggy began
life by being perfectly beastly to Billy, who loved her. She
continued by marrying a very obvious rotter, who promptly
—and perhaps not wholly without excuse—took to drink,
and beat her so much that one evening she fluttered round
to Billy's flat with the intention of saying, “Take me; I
am yours.” But unfortunately she found not Billy but
Stella. This was a good and promising situation, which I
scarcely think the author handled for quite all it was worth."
Anyhow there was a vast lot of talk, and at the end of it
Billy went to the War, Stella was left sitting, and butterfly
Peggy took her draggled wings to the service of the kind of
tea-shop that figures in city police-courts. But as there
had to be a happy ending she eventually escaped thence
comparatively unharmed and became a nurse at a base
hospital. And if from this point you can't see the precise
nature of the happy ending I shall be astonished. Perhaps

AND UNwiN), by GEORGE |
AGNEw CHAMBERLAIN,
very unreal and rather
foolishly tiresome. It is
the history of a young man
named John Bogardus,
whose father is a professor
of Romance languages at
an American university.
The boy was intended to
be the same, but his won-
derful sense of comedy
(which, however, is more
talked of than seen) causes
him to resign after a term
or two. He then becomes
a sentimental vagabond,
and has intimate emo-
tional passages with a
farmer's daughter named
Joan, a missionary's
daughter named Pauline
and an actress named
Dora, being always very
careful to be off with the
old love before he is on
with the new. Dora he marries, being under the impres-
sion that she may, all the time, be the child Janice, now
grown up, whom he bought at Lewes for ten pounds and
adopted, when he was only a youth, on a walking tour
along our South Coast, and impulsively handed over to a
South African lady who had lost her own small daughter.
Whether or not Dora was this Janice I am not certain ;
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN wraps it up in mystery—the odds, how-
ever, seem to be that she is—but her moods and her past
are too much for John, who, in despair of reconciling his
idealism and his tangential nature with the hard riddle of
life, separates and resumes his professorship. Meanwhile
his father burns the essay on the philosophy of Poker on
which he has been working for half a century or so. A
fairly mad book.

My first difficulty with Butterfly Wings (HURST AND
BLACKETT) came from the pictorial wrapper, which repre-
sents the bust of a red-haired young woman garnished with
an enormous pair of spotted wings, and is frankly hideous.
But the contents of the book, if nothing to make a fuss
about, are at least more agreeable than this. The Butterfly
of the title is one Peggy; and all I can say is that, if the
application of the title is justified, Miss MARGARET PETERson
live down to its cover.
It is not every political
novelist who has the luck
to find that even while his
work was in the press
History has stepped in to
F. give it free advertisement;
but this, so Messrs. MEL-
Rose say, is what has
happened in the case of
ELIZABETH HART's Irish
study, Irreconcilables, to
which the tragic incidence
of the Dublin rising adds
a sombre endorsement.
One has to admit that
history has patronised
wisely, for undoubtedly
the book is one that can
be very heartily recom-
mended for its own sake,
being blessed with some
dialogue that really does
sparkle and some charac-
- ters that really do live and
breathe, while one scene—you cannot miss it—has in
perfection the tender and exquisite pathos of Ireland of
the Fairies. You may feel with me that there is some
falling off in the later chapters, but the responsibility
for that may, at least in part, be ascribed to one's own
human weakness in desiring a happy ending which the
subject, as the authoress realises it, can never allow.
Briefly, she takes some Protestant English and some Irish
Nationalists and, treating them quite frankly and fairly,
arranges for a mutual falling in love. Such a thing is
possible, she says, but, though her people may continue to
live in friendship and try with commendable patience to
bridge their differences, they can, as the title suggests, find
no final basis for the completer union of marriage. And so
there is nothing for it but to finish them off or leave them
in some sort of fashion that is necessarily unsatisfactory.
You will notice that the writer presents a problem only to
declare it insoluble, and unfortunately she intends to imply
that the two countries which her characters represent are
in a like position. A miserable enough conclusion, with
which, of course, you need not agree; but the way in
which the case is stated has so much charm and vivacity
that in the enjoyment of reading it you may almost forget
the verdict.

[AUGUST 30, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM THE FIJI ISLANDS.
It happened that some time in April last I wrote an
article which, on the 26th of that month, duly (or shall we
say unduly 2) appeared in Punch. Now, when an article
appears in Punch several things must have happened to it.
The Editor will have seen it and will perhaps have sighed
as he murmured to himself or to his Assistant Editor,
“There's a column and a-half from poor old So-and-so; I
suppose we shall have to find room for it somehow ; ” and
thereupon he will have ticked it and sent it along to the
printer. Then the printer will have seized upon it and,
disregarding entirely its beauty as a piece of prose and all
the other merits with which its writer has invested it—the
printer, I say, will have seized upon it and converted it
from a piece of bad handwriting into a skilfully and
accurately printed galley-proof, and eventually, after many
meticulous inspections and corrections, it will have become
part of the page-proofs, and so it will have been “put to
bed ” with the rest of the paper, to wake up as a bit of a
new number in the full blaze of publicity. Then, on the
appointed day, with a rush and flutter of paper, the examples
of Mr. Punch's benevolent handiwork set forth each to its
own place to do the kindly business of the Sage who
devised it. Some go to railway-stations and are eagerly
snapped up; some appear at clubs, where Jones doubts if
Punch is what it was, while Smith, who is the man for my
money, asserts that it is better than ever; some to the
trenches, where not even the imminence of a crump can
spoil the Punchian cheerfulness of our men; and others,
in spite of war, to all known parts of the habitable globe,
save only the regions where the Hohenzollerns and the
Hapsburgs hold sway. And on this particular 26th of
April of which I have already spoken one copy of Punch
took unto itself wings, like those of Mercury the Messenger,
and started on a long flight for the Lau Islands, which are
a part of the group known to us as the Fiji Islands.
Now in this article of my writing I had described a visit
to London in company with a small boy who happens to
be my own. He was then, and is still, passing through
the phase in which postage-stamps assume a wonderful
value and desirability, and together he and I had deter-
mined to see how many of these rapture-producing pieces
of coloured paper could be purchased for a money-prize
presented to Frederick by a lady who had noted and
admired his devotion to Nature Study as exemplified by the
possession of silk-worms. London being, in Frederick's
opinion, one vast repository of stamps, there had been at
first a slight sense of disappointment when, in a by-street
not far from Charing Cross, we entered the stamp-shop and
noted that its size was small. This feeling, however, had
been swallowed up in the satisfaction caused by a bargain
which included one or two bold and rakish-looking tri-
angular stamps; and we had subsequently witnessed a
cinema show and had lunched at the Rhadamanthus Club,
where the small boy, though not yet past his ninth birth-
day, had looked round him and sat down to his food
without the least sign of being daunted by the splendour
of the rooms or the age of their frequenters. So the visit
ended and we returned home with our postal spoils.
Well, off went the article with the rest of Punch to the
Fiji Islands, and in due course—on July 6th, to be strictly
accurate—it landed at its destination, and there it fell under
the eyes of a reader whose work of administration in the
Colonial Civil Service has not, as I judge, dulled in the very
least his memory of his own young days or his desire to do
a kind action when the chance is offered. First he reads
my article, and that action is not without its spice of kind-
ness, for at the Rhadamanthus and elsewhere at home
many are content to skim through Punch's pictures and to
neglect the printed words that eke them out in the number.
Be that as it may, it is certain that in Fiji at least one
gentleman read an article in Punch. Thereupon it struck
him that a few Fijian stamps, coming, as it were, hot and
hot from their place of origin, could not fail to give immense
pleasure to the youthful philatelist whose literary acquaint-
ance he had just made. No sooner thought than done. He
made up the parcel of stamps and away he sent it on its long
voyage of kindness. On August 22nd, having been addressed
to the care of Punch, it came to hand, and on that morning
at breakfast one small boy flushed red and sparkled with
joy, while some older folk were not ungrateful for this
pleasant thought so promptly translated into a kindly act,
and sent to us over many leagues of stormy water. To
Mr. Punch's influence we owe it that we here and an
administrator in Fiji are now bound together with invisible
links of friendship. R. C. L.

By St. Anthony in Roseland, where the fern and fuchsia
grow,
Safe-sheltered in a wayward, winding creek,
Rides a pinnace at her moorings, whom I loved—oh, years
ago
And there she waits to greet me week by week.
It is twenty months or over since I braved the salt-sea spray,
And watched her foam-flecked fo'c'sle rock and reel;
But her rudder now is forrard and her sails are stowed away,
And barnacles are growing on her keel.
To St. Anthony in Roseland, which is hard by Falmouth
Town, -
Along the twisty path that flanks the stream,
No more the kindly Cornish folk to me come trapezing down ||
With cranberries and golden-crusted cream ; . . ;
No longer through the silence of the star-hung summer night,
My pinnace, sweet and fleet as any fawn, -
Shall steal in 'neath the black cliffs to the winking Lizard
Light,
And smell the clean, sweet-scented thyme at dawn.
From St. Anthony in Roseland (where good cruises all
begin),
When * last war-weary troops are ordered home,
When the harbours all are opened and the mines are all
towed in, -
And all the changeful sea is mine to roam,
I will slip your reed-grown moorings and beat westward
from the creek—
Land-weary make once more the open seas—
And with flying jib and top-sail once again set sail to seek
The Islands of the New Hesperides.

[AUGUST 30, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PLEA FOR A SILLY SEASON.
WE should now, in ordinary times,
be well in the Silly Season — the
term applied to that time of the year
when Parliament has its summer holi-
days and London omnibuses between
Piccadilly Circus and Knightsbridge go
by way of Jermyn Street and St. James's
Place and return by way of Shepherd's
Market and Hay Hill. But this year,
it is rumoured, there is to be no Silly
Season ; the War has seen to that.
There is only the perpetual Willy
Season.
None the less it is to be hoped that
our editors will not be unenterprising
just because there is so much Williness
about. They can compromise. Their
columns can still be turned as of old
into a summer forum, -
and matters of no im-
port be debated; only
...those matters must
have a war flavour.
Because September
would not be Sept-
ember without discus-
sions of this kind. Be-
sides, we ought not to
let Germany think that
the War is affecting us
to such an extent that
we have foregone this
annual custom. We
never quitedropped rac-
ing ; let us be similarly
tenacious about our
silliness. The men in
the trenches will fight
all the better if they
realise that we are
carrying on here in the
same old way. And it
would not be fair to - -
Englishmen to deprive them of their
fun. (Nor, to be quite fair, have they
been entirely deprived, for already one
paper's readers are being asked, “Should
women preach 2" and apparently there
are a few persons hardy enough to
reply in the affirmative. “Should any-
one preach 2" would be a better ques-
tion during war-time, and would have
a war flavour.)
The war flavour is imperative. In
the happy past, for example, no sooner
had the family left for Margate or
Littlehampton or Ilfracombe, with the
perambulator on the top of the cab,
than the biggest type in the composing-
rooms would be employed in setting
before the world some such question as,
“Who said rats?” A tremendous prob-
lem needing all the brains of the closer
and dustier summer months to reply
to it. Who said rats? Who?

interest in this inquiry cease. Ob- fluctuations—one morning Mr. PEM-
viously ADAM said it first, when he was BERTON-BILLING easily heading the

on board. But the investigators would
take a broader and more modern view
than that.
But to-day such a theme is too pacific.
We should leave it to the paragraphist,
such, say, as “The Londoner” in The
Evening News, whose column is a kind
of daily Notes and Queries and reaches a
slightly larger public than that minute
inquisitive weekly does. To-day there
must, in any big discussion, be a war
interest.
Or the question might be varied, to get
a little popular malice into it, to Who is
the most deplorable M.P.” Then that
great eloquent public whose life-blocd
is depreciation and suspicion would
have its chance, and not one of them

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS.
XLVI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, The military
machine appears to me to have failed
dismally in the most important respect.
For every material demand there is an
officer supplied; for the smoke barrage
there is the O.C. thunder-clouds; for
the official correspondence, the O.C.
nibs; for everything somebody, graded,
for purposes of pay, as somebody else,
but no poet-in-chief, and, with the
lower formations, no D.A.A.P.C. The
battle called for an epic, from the
start:—
The French have been and taken Frise
(This for your information, please);
Mametz is ours and Fricourt too
(Seen, noted, filed and passed to you).
Seeking to put this matter right I
ought, of course, to have proceeded by
“the usual channels,” but I was afraid
that by the time we had sailed the
length of them, got our man made
“supernumerary to the establishment”
(which expression indicates, I fancy,
some menial position), and thoroughly
appointed him, we should probably dis-
cover that, everything else being in
perfect order, the appointee didn't
happen to be a poet. So I first got
into touch with such poets as I knew
of with the B.E.F., and called for a
return of samples.
The name of Bernard Forsyth, once
so familiar on soft leather covers in
art shades, was the first to occur to
me. I found that it had practically
ceased to be, but that No. 17625514
had come into existence, and repre-
sented much the same thing, if slightly
browner in appearance. His instruc-
tions from me were:—
1. You will record your feelings, as
you lean over the parapet at midnight,
while engaged on sentry duty.
2. Having eased the tiigger of your
rifle, thus causing an explosion in the
chamber and a hurried exit of a bullet
from the muzzle, you will address your
thoughts, in soliloquy, to the unseen
enemy in opposite trenches.
3. Record of feelings will reach this
office not later than noon to-morrow.
Recalling Bernard Forsyth as I knew
him by his works in peace time, I sup-
posed that the first thousand lines of
our epic were now as good as written.
This, however, is all that No. 17625514
had to say to his adversary over the
way:—
I shot a bullet into the air,
And where it fell was your affair.
“Have one of ours?” I hear you shout—
Don't worry, thanks. I'll do without.
I sent this back, with a “Returned
to you” chit (we have these in the
Army, too) and told him to try again
in the simple narrative form, taking
some incident of the aftermath of
battle, as showing the confusion and
horror which then prevail. He com-
plied with :—
The night was dark, there was no moon,
I'd had a tiring afternoon
And lost my bearings . . .
A most officious bayonet.
Its movements showed the man behind
To be of the inquiring kind;
But, ere he questioned me or fired,
I gave the answers he required,
And, with a view to whet his thirst
For knowledge, gave the second first:
“You wonder, ‘Am I friend or foe?'
Upon my word I do not know;
That all depends, it seems to me,
On what your sympathies may be.
And ‘Who goes there?' you wish to say,
Not I . . . I'll go the other way.”
This I felt to be lacking in the inde-
finable something; it did not at once
strike the true martial note. Upon my
suggestion he next tried a domestic
picture of quiet life in billets, but his
“Soldier's Letter to his Infant Son.”
got held up abruptly by the intrusion
of a sordid reality:—
I wrote a letter to my son,
Whom I have known ore he was one ;
It seems I wrote the Censor, too,
Though that's a man I never knew.
I told him to get right away from
his material surroundings and to ver-
sify, immortally, the Attributes of
the Enemy, showing the spirit of the
Germanic peoples and the development
of their national destiny. “This is
your last chance,” I told him, “of
being THE Soldier-Poet.” This is how
he took it :—
We know what sort of man the Bosch is :
He always eats but never washes.
In his conceit of Number One
He is extremely like the Hun.
If Bosches laughed and Huns were gents
They'd own their share of continents;
There'd be no fuss, and, what is more,
There wouldn't even be a war.
Whereas the ond of all this tosh
Can only be there'll be no Bosch.
But then I doubt if anyone
Will mind that much, except the Hun.
I told No. 17625514 that he was
returned to duty, and he saluted and
withdrew.
Clitheroe Ponsonby you will recall
as a bard of the more prosperous, better
dressed type. I found him amongst the
Commissioned, but only just; rich and
forty though he is, he is, temporarily,
the merest subaltern. I invited him to
express himself in the now regulation
metre (things so soon become regulated
in military life) upon the subject of the
commands under which he found him-
self serving. I asked him to close his
eyes, visualize his subject and carry
on. He did so :—
Between the fights Ilie in peace
In bed (or, rather, in valise),
when I met
And, in my matutinal doze,
I deal with Adjutants, C.O.'s,
And Brigadiers, who daren't refuse
(Imaginary) interviews.
I do not shout or make a stink,
Imerely tell them what I think:
My mien is just, my tone restrained,
Extremely kind if slightly pained:
Though they may bluster for a bit
I always force them to admit . . .
They always end by giving in,
If there are arguments I win.
(Though on parade they seem to be
Deficient in humanity,
I must confess I find them then
The most subdued, attentive men.)
I told Ponsonby that this was a
licence which might be poetic but was
most unmilitary. Always ready to
oblige, he mentioned that he had a
friend in the Cavalry who was a very
good soldier. “Write him up,” I said;
“it won't be the first time you have
used your friends for the purpose.” I
hoped for a pen-picture of the gallant
gallop through, but I only got —
I heard a peevish Lancer say,
“I wish they wouldn't run away,
For, though one soon acquires the knack
Of lancing Germans in the back,
It makes one's point so much less blunt
To stick them properly in front.”
I told him that it was a case of what
is technically known as “Na Poo” with
Second Lieutenant Ponsonby, and left
him entirely unrepentant.
Do you remember those two parti-
cularly young, young men who used to
blow in at our residential chambers in
the Temple, at odd times of the late
night and the early morning, to tell us
all about their souls? One of them is
in the Artillery, the other in the Royal
Flying Corps, and what has become
of their souls I'm sure I don't know.
“The Message of the Gunner,” surely
a promising subject, shows that one of
these is missing, doesn't it? Anyhow,
this is the first young man's sub-
in 1ssion :-
We sent a message to the Hun
To ask what business might be done,
And giving him to understand
Our Season's stock was now to hand,
Which stock, we ventured to advise,
Included shells of every size
And, what the German most enjoys,
Combining usefulness with noise.
In every way we guaranteed
To cater for his utmost need.
(We put a postscript at the end:
“No need to call for goods. We send.”)

Yours ever, HENRY.
THE FATALIST.
WHEN after a twelve-mile march we
arrived at rest-billets, Private Horrocks
was not the least cheerful member of
the regiment. Tired and footsore though
he was, he limped into the village with
a smile on his face and his chum's rifle
as well as his own on his shoulder.
Occasionally I could hear him, far in
the rear, demanding in stentorian tones
if we were down-hearted, and immedi-
ately there would be a roar of “No” all
along that dusty line of some five hun-
dred marching men. Were they down-
hearted? Of course not And weary
though they were the men could still
smile and wave to the children who
formed up in front of the village school,
shouting as we passed, “Tommee,
Tommee, souvenir Ingleesh '"
Later in the day I saw Horrocks in
an estaminet fraternising with two
French soldiers who had been invalided
home from Verdun. As I went by he
was pointing to his blistered feet and
shouting his favourite question with the ling fowl, while in front of her was

[AUGUST 30, 1916.
Monday, August 21st.—Every year,
at this time, the Peers complain
because, having been kept idle for the
best part of the Session, they are sud-
denly called upon to deal post-haste
with a batch of half - baked Bills
shovelled at them by the Commons.
And this is the more galling because
they are conscious that, given time, they
are much more competent legislators
than the fellows in the “other place.”
The Commons, for example, have been
unable to solve the problem of enabling
the soldiers in the trenches to exercise
the franchise. Lord SALISBURY sees no
difficulty in it at all. The soldier can
vote as easily as he writes to his sweet-
heart. All he need do is to mark a
card with a cross, put it in an envelope,
and hand it to his officer. I am afraid,
however, there will be a lot of spoiled
ballot-papers if his lordship's simple
plan is adopted. At least I never heard
of a Tommy who, when writing to his
best girl, was content with a single cross.
A good many members of the House
of Commons showed their wisdom by
anticipating the holidays and staying
away. The Nationalist Benches were
particularly empty. “Why should
LUNDoN wait?” I asked myself on
seeing that shockheaded and usually
incollerent youth in his customary
place. Perhaps he had a notion of
imitating his lamented colleague, Mr.
GINNELL, and getting himself sus-
pended, so as to return to his constitu-
ents in a blaze of glory. If so he was
disappointed, for though he made an
offensive attack upon Sir John MAx-

SHUTTING UP THE SHOP.
Lowth ER, knowing his man, did not
give him the martyrdom he sought.
The War Office, which has often
been accused of wool-gathering, is now
guilty on its own confession. Mr. Forts-
TER is daily called upon to explain the
methods by which he proposes to ac-
quire the national clip without fleecing
the farmers. Sir F. BANBURY, who is
an agriculturist in his spare time, com-
plained to-day that his wool had not yet
been commandeered, and was politely
informed that there was no need for
him to lose it.
Everyone was glad to welcome back
Mr. RUNCIMAN, who was in strong voice
and looked all the better for his en-
forced holiday. He had an excellent
account to give of his visit to Italy,
which, though not yet formally at war
with Germany (as Mr. Hogge, with
characteristic tactfulness, insisted), has
taken steps to cut off all commercial
intercourse with that country.
Tuesday, August 22nd.—A Scottish
Member called attention at Question-
time to the alleged unpopularity of Trea-
sury notes in his native country, and
the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
took him seriously.
The PRIME MINISTER announced
that after all the Cabinet is not to
be cinematographed. Various theories
are put forward in explanation of this
momentous change in policy: that
which finds most favour below the
Gangway being that the operator cried
off at the last moment on the ground
that he had not a slow enough machine
to take a really lifelike picture.
Several Members are convinced that

Mr. Asquith's faculty for gauging the
feeling of the House of Commons is
leaving him. Though Mr. Hogge,
Mr. PRINGLE, Mr. KEATING, Mr. LYNCH,
Mr. ELLIS GRIFFITH and Sir W. BYLES
joined in urging him to give an extra
day for the discussion on the adjourn-
ment, in order that they might have
more scope for their eloquence, he
declared, in face of this evidence, that
the country was quite ready to see
Parliament put up its shutters. And,
strange to say, it appeared, on a division,
that most of the other Members agreed
with him.
Mr. CHURCHILL led off the debate
with one of his carefully prepared and
stridently delivered essays on the War.
There was much good sense in it, yet
somehow it failed to grip. Even the
Socialists viewed with suspicion his
suddenly awakened interest in food-
prices, and especially his suggestion
that the Government should issue
bread-cards and meat-cards, as in the
Happy Fatherland.
The new WAR SECRETARY did not
waste much breath on his pessimistic
ex-colleague, but without any bombast
gave an encouraging survey of the
general situation. The ultimate vic-
tory of the Allies was certain, though
he would not pretend to give even an
approximate date for it.
Later on the Irishmen made another
concerted attack on Sir John MAxwell,
and martial law. Mr. DUKE was not
put out of his carefully measured stride.
He still hopes to reach a settlement of
the vexed question of Irish government,
but it will not be achieved by giving

ideal is anarchy.
Wednesday, August 23rd.— Parlia-
ment adjourned to-day without any
visible signs of public mourning. Few
Members attended the last scene. Even
Sir John LoNSDALE, usually so assidu-
ous, was on this occasion an absentee,
much to my disappointment, for I
longed to know the answer to his in-
triguing question, “What goods are
included in the term duck?”
In spite of the Parliament Act the
House of Lords still has a kick left in
it. When the Bill for extending the
life of this Parliament was before the
Commons an amendment was proposed
to limit the life of any Parliament
elected on the present stale register to
two years. The Government were
ready to accept it, but the Chairman
ruled it out of order.
went upstairs, however, the Peers in-
sisted on inserting a similar proviso,
and to-day the Commons meekly yielded
to their decision.
After all, the Government gave the
chatterers below the Gangway another
innings, and there was much further
talk of food-prices, which furnished
Mr. PRETYMAN with an opportunity of
explaining the practical difficulties in
the way of regulating them. After-
wards Mr. LUNDON made the amende
honorable for his attack upon Sir John
MAxwell; and Mr. DUKE, for his part,
declared that he was most anxious to
withdraw the stigma of martial law
from Ireland.
Shortly before six o'clock Mr. KING
rose to address the House. But by
this time there was no House to ad-
dress, and his speech was ended before
it began by an ignominious “count.”

THE TRAVELLER.
ANYBoDY could tell that the pink-
faced round gentleman with his feet up
was an experienced traveller. His own
person, his baggage, his coat, his stick,
and all that he had with him filled
nine and a half of the ten places which,
according to the Railway Company, the
compartment provided.
The careworn-looking man in a cheap
suit who shyly entered and occupied
the vacant half-seat folded his arms
and turned his face towards the land-
scape. Something in the man's appear-
ance suggested that he might be a
submissive listener, and the pink gentle-
man, yearning for some of the music
that he loved so well, cleared his throat
and began to speak.
He talked of the great advantages of
travel. He had been eleven times to
the United States, to say nothing of
the Continent before the War. But,
bless you, even the War could not hinder
his journeyings—within the last six
months he had been to Spain, and it
wasn't everybody who could say that.
No good, of course, for a timid person
to travel, for risks had to be taken (as
for instance in his trip to Spain) and
discomforts to be borne (New York on
a really hot day was terrible). But
travel was an education; it promoted
not only breadth of mind but patriot-
ism. He would strongly recommend
his listener to travel, if he ever had the
good fortune to get the chance. It
was not so expensive as some people
thought.
“War didn' stop me travellin'
neither,” said the other man. “Before
the war I 'adn' been further than Mar-
gate; but then I went all over the shop
—Yorkshire, Durby, Ireland ->
“Ah, but foreign travel's what I am
referring to,” said the experienced one,
waving his cigar and smiling with
amusement.
“Talk about discomforts,” said the
man presently; “some says France
ain't all 'oney, and some says the Bay
of Biscay's the limit. But France was
a bloomin' picnic, and the Bay was
nothing at all, and Egypt was Paradise

WHEN IT WON'T END.
It is a wonderful thing that every
other man you meet tells you that the
War will be over in October. Now I
am the one person who doesn't know
when it will be over. All I can say is
“This year—next year—some time.”
Yet I must admit with shame that I
am in some measure responsible for
the popular belief.
It all came about through that
fatuous ass, Robinson. He came up to
me in the club with some insane story
that if you added together the date of
the KAISER's birth, the date of the
“I turned her out and went on with
my work. I glanced at my great-uncle,
who was sleeping peacefully—not that
I believed anything, mind.
“‘No, no, I quite understand,' cried
Robinson.
“A minute later someone called to
see me. I left the garden for about
half an hour. When I came back I
could not see my great - uncle. I
thought he had gone in and went to
pick up the paper he had left on the
ground. To my infinite horror I found
that in his sleep he had fallen into the
fountain and had been drowned in
barely two feet of water. You need
a gipsy's prophecy. Queer variants of
the story began to spread. A friend in
Cornwall wrote to me about the great-
aunt of an intimate friend of his who
fell on a mountain.
I almost began to believe that the
War was certain to end in October
myself. However, let me state that
my considered opinion is that no mor-
tality amongst my apocryphal relatives
throws any light on the duration of
the War.
Now if only our common friend
WILHELM would fall on his head in a
fountain
CRowN PRINCE's marriage and
deducted from them the nu-
merical value of the letters in
the KAISER's name and the date
of the foundation of the German
Empire you got the result 1916
—obviously, therefore, the Ger-
man Empire was to end in 1916.
I am not quite sure of the dates
or events, but his calculation
ran on those lines. He took
about twenty minutes to work it
out and I became exasperated.
When he had finished I fixed
him with my glittering eye and
said, “Robinson, I am going to
tell you a very remarkable
thing, an incredible thing. I
do not expect you to believe it.
I shall not be hurt if you don't
believe it. I should not believe
it myself if you told it me.”
“Go on, go on,” said Robin-
son with greedy interest.
“Last week I was mowing my
tennis lawn in the evening.
My great-uncle Samuel was
sitting by the fountain, sleeping
over The Westminster Gazette.
You have heard me speak of my
great-uncle Samuel?”

Boy. “I wasn't working, SIR; only whistlisg.”
“Yes, yes,” said that liar, Robinson.
Yet how could I have spoken of a great-
uncle Samuel before, when I had only
just evolved him out of my imagination?
“Well, all at once I noticed that a
gipsy selling brooms had come into the
garden. Now it says distinctly on the
back gate, “No hawkers—no circulars.'
She came towards me and said, “Can
I tell you your fortune, Sir?'
“‘No, but you can clear out,' I
replied.
“I’ll tell you,' she persisted, ‘when
the War will end, for sixpence.'
“I became angry, and said, “Get out.
I'm not a maidservant to be fooled
with your nonsense.'
“‘Fool, you!' she snapped; “it will
end in October.' Then, looking at me
steadily, she added, “As sure as that
old gentleman will die in an hour, it
will end in October.'
not believe this, Robinson. I do not
expect you to. You had better not
mention it to anybody else. I have
just told you the tale."
With that I rose and left him, think-
ing that my last words would explain
to Robinson that he had been fooled.
Surely “I have just told you the tale”
was enough to enlighten anyone out of
an asylum.
The next day a man in the train told
me a story about a gipsy and the
great-uncle of an intimate friend of his.
This great-uncle fell in a fountain and
died in an hour. The next day I met,
conversationally, another great-uncle
who had taken the fatal plunge. The
mortality amongst great-uncles became
frightful. The fountains were choked
with them. Everyone knew some-
body else whose great-uncle's life had
been summarily snuffed out to prove

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FRIEND THE READER, as Mr. KEBLE HowARD is so fond of
saying, if you were a K.C. and were interviewing a female
client in your chambers and heard a knock at the outer
door, what would you do? You would open the door and
ask the visitor to take a seat for a moment while you
finished your interview 2 Nonsense. You would do
nothing of the sort. You would pursue the only natural
and sensible course open to a hard-headed barrister. You
would hide your client in the bedroom and stoutly deny
that there was anyone there. Why? Use your intelli-
gence. How otherwise could you create any situations and
suspense? A pretty state the plot of Forked Lightning
(The Bodley Head) would have been in if Sir Hugh Brand-
reth, K.C., had not had the presence of mind to hide Janet
Grierson when Lady Milverdale called at his chambers.
It would have died squashily, like a punctured tyre. As
it was, however, Sir Hugh did the right thing, and the
story was enabled to reach full six-shilling book-length.
In a long experience as a reviewer I think I have
never come across a tale so irritatingly told. There is
scarcely a page on which one does not stub one's mental
toe on the intrusive person of Mr. HowARD, as he pops up
to thrust himself between the reader and the characters
of the story. When it comes to describing Sir Hugh's
chambers in London he shelves the story for four solid
pages while he indulges in a bitter attack on some imagin-
ary caviller who may possibly object to the bedroom hav-
ing two doors. Surely no critic is going to be brutal
enough to object to two doors in a story of this kind when
the whole plot depends on it.
Do not be put off by the somewhat solid appearance of
The Slavs of the War-Zone (CHAPMAN AND HALL). You
will find it much lighter reading than it looks at first sight.
Mr. W. F. BAILEY wields a facile and picturesque pen, and
gives us an immense amount of information about the
various peoples–Poles, Ruthenes, Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes,
Croats, Serbs and Bulgars—who make up the Slav popu-
lation of the Dual Monarchy and the Balkan Peninsula,
and who, to most of us, I am afraid, are at present little
more than names. The author does not say so, but I fancy
he must have been attracted to the Slavs by their likeness
to the people of Western Ireland, with whom, in his capacity
as an Irish Estates Commissioner, he is constantly brought
into contact. In their shrewdness and simplicity, their
religious devotion (a good deal flavoured with paganism),
their capacity for suffering, and yet their generally easy-
going outlook on life, they constantly recall “the finest
peasantry in the world.” There is very little about the
War in these pages, though here and there the author
heightens the effect of his vivid pictures of peace-time
festivities in a Slav village by adding a little vignette of
their altered condition when the war-storm burst upon
them. If I have a fault to find with him it is that he
sometimes lays on the colours from a too-opulent palette,
and hardly gives us time to absorb one brilliant impression
before dazzling us with another. But this drawback the
reader can easily cure for himself by taking the book in
small doses, and not trying (as the hurried reviewer must)
to gallop through it at a single sitting.
Mr. STANLEY WASHBURN possesses the essential qualities
that go to make the complete war-correspondent, and
readers of Victory in Defeat (CoNSTABLE) cannot fail to be

he consumed three plates of beef

for our home-made trifle, though
he did not allow the jelly to pass

THE PROFITEERS.
“Go away, Uncle James;
wicked.”
“Two of a crowd,” I murmured
politely as I slid into the one comfort-
able chair the nursery possesses and
regarded the two white-muslin backs of
my small nieces, each stationed in a
separate corner of the room.
There was complete silence. Both
children were evidently overwhelmed
with the idea of doing time.
“And what were you,” I hazarded,
“before you fell to this?”
A heavy sigh escaped from Lillah in
the N.E. corner.
“We were a Food Ring,” she said.
“And now we aren't to talk till tea-
time,” said Phyllis from the N.W.
It seemed to me that, for a Food
Ring, they had escaped lightly.
“And we aren't to have any cake,”
added Lillah.
“Nor sweets,” said Phyllis with the
suspicion of a groan.
The Food Ring was indeed broken.
“This is nothing short of disaster,” I
said. “Tell me . . ... "
But Lillah cut in.
“We aren't to talk,” she said sternly,
determined, like so many of her sex, to
be a martyr. -
“In that case,” I said, rising “it
doesn't seem much use my staying,
though I should have liked to hear how
they broke the Food Ring.”
There was no sound. I went to the
door.
“Perhaps,” said Phyllis a little
hesitatingly—“perhaps Uncle James
could be the man who pulls people
out.”
A new réle. I turned.
“Where lots of people sign things,”
added Lillah from her corner—“per-
haps Uncle James might be.”
An uncle that knows his job has got
to be a smart man. But I've been at
it for some years now. I realized that
I was the Home Secretary.
“You are pardoned,” I said, with a
wave of the arm.
I felt the lust of power. “But on
one condition,” I added, “that I hear
the whole history of your crime.”
Lillah bore softly down from the
North-East. She stood listening at the
door.
“Is Nannie still doing the washing?”
said Phyllis from her corner.
Lillah nodded. I realized I wasn't
such a power in the land after all. That
is the worst of not being a permanent
official—like Nurse.
Both children bore down upon me
like Sioux on the trail.
“Tell us,” said Lillah, “about Food
Rings.”

“But I thought you were going to
tell me?”
“Ours went wrong,” said Phyllis.
“We heard Daddy reading about it,”
said Lillah; “but he put in bits of his
own, and Mummie told him not to, and
it muddled us.”
“When you have told me about your
Ring I will expound the whole thing to
you,” I said.
“We took,” said Lillah slowly, “all
the lumpy sugar.”
“Because there wasn't much,” added
Phyllis.
“Your first business principles are
quite sound,” I said.
“And we hid it in . . . .” -
“Don’t tell Uncle James where !”
broke in Lillah excitedly.
“No, that would be a mistake,” I
said gravely.
“Then they wanted it for the draw-
ing-room and there wasn't any.”
“Supply unequal to the demand,” I
murmured.
“And they hunted and hunted and
then Lillah said we'd got it, and they
could have it if they gave us two bits
of drawing-room cake.” -
“Consequent rise in price,” I said.
“This is all sound economics.”
“But they didn't,” said Lillah.
“Didn't what ?” I said.
“Give us the cake,” answered
Phyllis.
“Even the consumer finally jibs,” I
Said. “Well ?”
“So we just didn't do anything.”

Lillah. -

“Then,” said Phyllis, “when the
visitors had gone Mummie came up-
stairs." -
“Ah,” I said, “the Government
makes a move at last.”
“I wish,” said Lillah, “Uncle James
wouldn't be so grand when we're tell-
ing him.”
“I'm sorry,” I said.
Mummie do?”
“She laughed.”
“That's quite true to Westminster,
also. I'm sorry I'm being grand

grown-ups, Lillah; I'll fight against
it.”

it was Daddy's fault for putting ideas
into us . . . and she gave us a choco-
late.”
“You desperate profiteers,” I cried.
There was a long silence.
“Well,” I said, “I can see there is
nothing I can teach you about food-
rings; but why ?” I indicated the
recently-evacuated corners.
“You see,” said Phyllis slowly,
“that's where it began to be all
wrong.”
“When we'd had the chocolate
Mummie said we must give back the
sugar,” said Lillah.
“Well?” I asked. “That sounds just;
you'd made your bit.”
“Well, we couldn't,” said Phyllis.
“You see,” murmured Lillah, pulling
at my watch-chain, “we’d eat it.”
“Ah,” I said, “that was what broke
the Food Ring 2"
She nodded.
“An' now,” said Phyllis, “no cake
or sweets. . . . .”
At that moment Nurse came in. I
explained.
“Very well, Mr. James,” said she
with a sigh, “if you gave them leave.
They'd both be in bed this minute if I
had my way, but their mother . . .
“Ah, Nurse,” I said as I rose, “it’s
always the way when one tries to
deal with these scandals; there's a
power even above that of a permanent
official. Wested interest, you know.”
She looked at me blankly.
“H'm,” she said, with a glance at
the children, “I call it silly foolish-
ness.”
She is a wise woman, is Nurse, but

I'd write a poem if I could,
Would dry your eyes of tears;
I'd launch a flashing word which

Be heard adown the years;

Until he lost his crown;
I'd weave a laurel wreath of fame
Would ne'er go sere and brown:
And so I take my pencil up and
lay my knitting down.
Alas! your tears will not be stayed
By little words in rhyme;
My puny thoughts are all afraid
To trust themselves to Time;
I think perhaps the KAISER too
Would scarcely heed my frown,
And some might say my claims are
few
To weave the laurel crown :
And so I take my knitting up and
lay my pencil down.
I'll shape the toe and turn the heel,
And vary ribs and plains,
And hope some soldier-man may feel
The warmer for my pains;
I'll fashion mitten, sock and glove
In navy-blue and brown,
And finish with a touch of love
May call a blessing down :
When I shall take my knitting up
and lay my pencil down.

[SEPTEMBER 6, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR.
OUR original intention had been to
take no holiday. Not that either of us,
making munitions, respected the wishes
of Lord DERBY or whoever it is whose
appeals for a postponement of the
holidays usually have advertisements of
seaside resorts next them on the hoard-
ings. It simply was that money was
tight and we felt that we should and
could do without our ordinary month
away from London. The little margin
(and how little it is!) which we usually
manage to save for this purpose had
been so completely removed by what I
am wont humorously to refer to as
denial was more necessity than
virtue. The next thing was to
make the best of it.
“And why not London in
August?” I asked. “Person-
ally I like London when
there's no one in it. I like
the empty streets and the
closed roadways. I like the
hot nights. I like long rides
on the tops of 'buses to strange
places.” |
On my wife here pointing
out that she was hardly active
or robust enough for that, I
became lyrical about Ken-
sington Gardens. “Finer,” I
said, “than many a nobleman's
park, and particularly the park
at Tilworth,” I added, for that
is where we should have taken
a furnished house this year.
“Far finer. ‘How thick the
tremulous sheep-cries come!’”
I quoted. ->
“And then,” I said, “if we
stay in town and are bored
we can go to a theatre now
and again, which we never could at
Tilworth.”
“Have we ever yet been bored in the
evening during our country months?"
she asked.
I admitted that we had not. But
we might be. Everything is different
In O.W.
“And if it rains—as it seems likely
to do for ever,” I went on (this was in
June), “how much more comfortable is
London " "
And so on.
Anyway it was settled that we could
not go away, and we gradually became
reconciled to the sacrifice. -
And then in the dead of one dark
night a strange thing happened.
Thieves entered the house, made them-
selves comfortable with my spirits and
cigarettes, and left at their leisure,
carrying with them all the silver they
could find.
I rang up the police. Discreet and
massive men arrived and examined the
room, the tantalus, the window-sill, the
garden and the servants. They took
my name and everyone else's name in
the house and set all down in a pocket-
book. Then, remarking that they had
not much hope of ever tracking the
parties, they marched away.
It was old family silver and not bad
of its kind, and we were distressed to
lose it. It had been in my possession
for more years than I care to record.
Being, however, insured against bur-
glary, we should, even if we did not get
the silver back, receive compensation.
I sat down and wrote to the company
“McKennacal devices” that our self-'—not without a certain satisfaction,

for though I have always been insured
against most things—fire, accidents,
burglars, death, and, latterly, against
Count ZEPPELIN's merry little visitors
—this was the first time I had ever
made a claim.
For a few days nothing happened.
|
Then two things happened. First
the police again called and said they
had no clue, and despaired of any; and
then I received a visitor from the
insurance company—a charming man
—who expressed the deepest concern
at our loss, asked a few questions
about the silver, and suggested a sum
in recompense which startled me by
its generosity. I accepted it with, I
hope, not too much alacrity beaming
through my diplomatic composure, and
he took his leave.
It was on my way upstairs to tell
my wife that the great idea came to
me. She had not been too well, I
reflected. She was evidently not
flourishing in London this July. The
weather, though still bad, would doubt-
less mend. What, after all, at our time
of life was silver ? Good electro-plate
was the thing. London in August was
no great catch ; the days were often
heavy and dusty; the nights unbearably
close. The roads were up. Kensington
Gardens were parched and overcrowded
by noisy children. How much better
to accept this money so providentially
sent to us and take the house at Til-
worth (which I happened to know was
still available) and so lay up a store
of health for the winter 2 Silver,
indeed! Fingers were made before
forks. We might get a few new

but for ourselves plate would
do admirably. When the

wife's room.

upshot was that we secured
the house and made our pre-
parations to leave London

passed, during which the

(With humble acknowledgments to

THE other day I was admiring the
extraordinary lustre of the boots worn
by Sir “Tabbie” Dashforth, and by a
i stroke of great good luck I was fortunate
enough to elicit the secret from his
valet by the judicious gift of a choice
cigar. It appears that Sir “Tabbie”
has his boots blacked at intervals
throughout the day, and always with a
new brush and a new bottle of blacking.
| While his boots are being blacked Sir
“Tabbie” always has a bath, for he is
a great believer in frequent washing—
that is, every couple of hours. A special
feature of his baths is the admixture of
an infusion of eucalyptus leaves, lyco-
podium and salsify. This is quite easy
to make. The ingredients are put into
a silver jug, hot milk is poured over
them, and the resultant succedaneum
is then whipped smartly into a cream
and poured into the bath.
The complexion of the children of
Lady Loofah Pulborough has always
struck me with admiration. Such a
ruddy glow as they always present
seemed to me almost too good to
be true, until I met a lady whose
second cousin actually witnessed the
operation which is responsible for this
phenomenon. Three times a day the
children's faces are scrubbed with a
strigil, accurately copied from an an-
tique Roman model discovered at Pom-
peii by Lady Loofah's father, the Earl
of Sopington. After being scrubbed
for half an hour the children's faces are
anointed with an unguent compounded
of the best salad oil, Brazilian nut-
butter and guava jelly. Then the
strigilis applied for another ten minutes,
and the treatment is complete.
The Cheshire-Cattleys have always
been renowned for the expansiveness of
their smile, and Miss Lalage Cheshire-
Cattley, one of the prettiest of this year's
débutantes, shows the family character-
istic to its full extent in the snapshot
taken of her while playing tennis with
the King of Madagascar, for the benefit
of the Serbian relief fund. Yet, strange
to say, her smile, radiant as it is, is an
acquired and not an inherited charm,
It is only by the persistent use of facial
gymnastics that she has developed it
to its present perfection. I heard only
the other day of the rigorous methods by
which the desired result was obtained—
viz., the use four times a day of a mouth-
stretcher, the invention of an Argen-
tine beauty-doctor. A more striking
example of the application of the
maxim noblesse oblige it would be diffi-
cult to find.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SCENES FROM AN OUT FORT.
INCLUDING THE HUMOURS OF
TERENCE O'LEARY.
I.
How TERENCE O'LEARY won HIS
STRIPE.
WHEN a far-seeing Providence des-
patched Gunner Terence O'Leary to
Fort Mornington in the Sea, its
commanding officer, Major Tusher, R.A.,
was in no mood for trifling.
Rabbit-warrens were all very well for
rabbits, Sergeant Elihu Gonville had
been heard passionately to declare that
morning before he burst into hot weep-
ing over the fact that he had been
compelled to salute Lieutenant Tipping
sixteen times in the course of one short
hour's work about the Fort. The Major
being called in to advise had attempted
to stiffen the backbone of Elihu Gon-
ville. “Come, come, Sergeant—men
must work and women must weep,
you know.”
“I have no women here to do the
weeping,” returned the Sergeant hys-
terically. “If there was they'd weep
fast enough at being shut up in an ants'
nest. I call this life potterin'—simply
potterin', Sir.”
Clearly the Major had drifted behind
the times. The antique quotation had
long ago lost any sense that it might
once have had for him.
And Major Tusher withdrew to con-
template with some dismay the fact
that unless some strong-minded person
with a leaning towards the humorous
side of existence should intervene, Fort
Mornington would become a network
of nerves. He was therefore seriously
annoyed when young Warberry slunk
sideways into the mess-room to avoid
Corporal Jobbett, whose salute he had
already returned forty-five times be-
tween reveillé and one o'clock.
“Don’t tell me that this dashed
nervy business is catching,” cried Major
Tusher irritably. “Can't you pretend
you don't see the men? I look at the
sky a good deal in my own walks.”
“I wish something would happen,”
said Warberry despondently. “A good
fight would be better than nothing. I
should like to see someone's nose bleed
—not a senior officer's, of course, Sir,"
he hastened to add, as Major Tusher
looked up with a brow of thunder.
At this point, mercifully for young
Warberry, the telephone bell began to
be insistent, and the C.O. attached
himself passionately to the receiver.
“Yes, yes; is that the Headquarter
Office 2 I can't hear what you say—is
that the Adjutant?”
Thin as a thread, elusive as a voice
heard in a dream, came the reply, and
Major Tusher spoke again.
“Yes, yes, this is Fort Mornington:
sending me a man by the ration boat
this morning, are you? Gunner Terence
O'Leary. Rather a difficulty on shore?
What sort of a difficulty is he? We
have plenty of them here just at present.
Oh, unconscious humourist, is he ”
Rather too funny for shore life? Mess
waiter too and apt to do conjuring
tricks with the wine-glasses? H'm—
why don't you send him to France?
Lost his trigger finger and one eye in
the trenches already, has he? Well, if a
man can be humorous after that it must
be a complaint, and perhaps Fort
Mornington will do him good. Yes, we
do take our position very seriously out
here. Oh, you thought so, did you?”
The C.O. added “Good morning” and
rang off before relieving his feelings on
the subject of the Headquarter Office;
then he returned to finish his breakfast.
“The new mess waiter is called Ter-
ence O'Leary,” he said casually. “You
can make what you like of him, Tipping;
I believe you are mess secretary.”
“Perhaps he is an Irishman,” said
Tipping.
“With a name like that, I expect he
is a Hindu,” returned Major Tusher.
“Is that the Sergeant-Major singing
again?” -
“Says there is nothing else to do,
Sir,” said Warberry. “I’ve asked him
to try comic opera, int he says his mind
revolts at the thought of comedy. He
was a revival preacher before he re-
joined, Sir.”
“It strikes me,” said Tipping, after
a moment's enforced attention to a
mission hymn sung at the top of a
voice that had lost its first freshness,
“that we're all better adapted for situa-
tions that we're not at present occupy-
ing. Now, I—”
“I think,” said the C.O. frostily,
“that it is time for parade. If I have
to warn you again about your tardy
habits But Tipping had with-
drawn, and Major Tusher found him-
self gazing for audience at an empty
jam-pot.
When Gunner Terence O'Leary left
the ration boat and mounted the slip-
pery sea-washed steps of Fort Morning-
ton, it was evident that he was making
a violent effort to prevent another young
man who had left the vessel at the same
instant from assuming his own right of
entry. The situation presented to the
awe-stricken gaze of the little garrison
showed the unequal struggle of mind
against matter, for the head of the
young man, whose black hair and
foreign power of invective suggested
alien birth, was under O'Leary's arm,
and his body was being slowly but
surely pressed back into the ration boat
with irresistible force.
“'Tis a strange thing, Sergeant,” said
Gunner O'Leary cheerfully to an investi-
gating N.C.O., “that an unsuspectin'
Government will be afther sendin'
aliens out to important forts like this
onel The young fellow come on board
wid me, Sergeant, that was the way of
it, and may the blessed Saints preserve
us, but he had the excuse of a letter
for one of the orficers! Don't you be
having nothin' to do with him, Ser-
geant, for he has a bomb hid in the
pocket of his trousers, it's myself that
saw the same. An important fort like
this can't be too careful over a man
that says his name is Fritz Kahn.”
“I never said such a thing,” gasped
Mr. Ferdinand Cohen feebly, but the
words were choked back into his throat.
“You’ve too much tongue on you,
Gunner O'Leary,” said the Sergeant
sternly. “A nice thing to come aboard
this fort struggling with another luna-
tic.”
Terence O'Leary sat down on the
steps of Fort Mornington, and the alien
was compelled to sit down with him,
while the crew of the ration boat un-
loaded boxes of groceries and loaves of
bread with amazing swiftness and with
one eye on events.
“I want the Commanding Officer; I
must see Major Tusher,” gasped Mr.
Ferdinand Cohen; and Major Tusher,
attracted by the noise, came out to
investigate.
The sight of a gunner with one eye
engaged in a struggle upon the sacred
steps of Fort Mornington roused his
worst passions, until a closer glance
at the man in civilian clothes sent him
back into safety like a tortoise into his
shell.
“Sergeant-Major,” he said sternly
from behind the platform of the anti-
aircraft gun, “no strangers are ad-
mitted into this fort.”
“Very good, Sir,” said the Sergeant-
Major with the dawning protoplasm of
a smile. And, the tug steaming off at
that moment with unexpected sud-
deness, Mr. Ferdinand Cohen and his
blue paper became part of a tangled
heap of profanity and empty biscuit
boxes at the bottom of the ration boat.
Later, Gunner O'Leary faced Major
Tusher in his little C.O.'s quarters at
the top of the fort, and stood to atten-
tion with extreme propriety.
“I — er — I consider your treatment
of a suspicious alien as remarkably in-
telligent, O'Leary,” said Major Tusher
pompously.
“Beg pardon, Sorr. I have seen
them sort of aliens before,” said Terence
O'Leary. “In Ireland we call 'em
bumbailiffs. I was odd man to Captain
Mike O'Sullivan at Tipperary, Sorr–
God rest his soul for a gallant gentle-

Major Tusher waved a hand that held

was no glossing over of matters where
O'Leary was concerned, and he said
majestically:-
“It was a small account that had

AT THE PLAY.
“HIGH-JINKs.”
I Do not know to which of the
numerous authors and composers of
the musical comedy now running (and
likely to run till Christmas) at the
Adelphi Theatre is due the root-idea,
but anyhow I take my hat off to him.
The love-philtre has often done duty
MR. W. H. BERLY IN “HIGH JINRs.”
as a basis for comedy—even GILBERT
did not disdain to invoke its aid in
The Sorcerer—but it required to
be carefully administered even to the
persons of the drama, and it had no
effect upon the audience. High-Jinks,
the marvellous perfume that Dick
Mayne, explorer, discovered somewhere
in the mystic East, requires no elaborate
administration, yet exerts a far more
potent influence. He simply pours a
few drops upon a handkerchief, and
flirts it round the stage; and imme-
diately everyone within range becomes
subject to its joyous spell. As the
orchestra on these occasions simul-
taneously breaks into a peculiarly
attractive and haunting melody the
audience, too, catches the infection,
and in a moment everyone behind the
footlights is dancing, and everyone in
front of them laughing.
That is the simple secret of High-
Jinks' success. Whenever the plot has
got itself into an apparently inextricable
tangle, or the stream of humour is run-
ning a trifle thin, out comes the hand-
kerchief, “ting-a-ling" goes the orches-
tra, and all difficulties are removed, all
banalities forgotten. Not that there
is much that wants ‘forgetting. Mr.
W. H. BERRY as Dr. Wilkie Bard,
the American quack who through the
influence of High-Jinks finds himself
the embarrassed possessor of two wives
in addition to his légitime, keeps the
fun going with SEYMoUR HICKS-like
vivacity. Excellent, too, is Mr. W. H.
RAwlins, as the American lumber-king
in search of a long-lost wife. In bulk
and manner he reminded me greatly of
spell of the perfume he turned a couple
of elephantine cart - wheels — a feat
Mr. HILL, I am sure, could never have
performed. As the runaway wife Miss
MAISIE GAY sang and acted with much
spirit—she has a capital song, “My
Old Jim,” reminiscent of BRET HARTE
—though she was, perhaps, a little
inclined to underline the humour of her
part. As the real Mrs. Wilkie Miss
MARIE BLANCHE had little to do, but
did that little well; while as one of the
the late W. J. HILL, until under the
to be preferred to the striving after
pseudo-Asiatic effects (with tiresome
iteration of clashing cymbals and be-
laboured tom-toms) of the conscientious
and self-conscious local colourist. It
is in fact no more than modest operetta
music of a more or less old-fashioned
school, and sufficiently entertaining at
that.
But Chu Chin Chow is primarily a
spectacle—a splendid spectacle. If one
detects a certain crudity, the effect,
one would judge, of over lighting, and
registers a conviction that the whole
would be even more beautiful seen
through a gossamer veil to give it an
atmosphere which it lacks—well, that
is hypercriticism. Nothing could well
have excelled the opening scene, a har-
mony of azure, gold, black and greys;
pseudo-wives Miss NELLIE TAYLOR or the cave scene with its flashing
made the most of an unusually good tumbled treasure; or those two notable
singing-voice, and Mdlle. JEANNE ST. exteriors, the slave-market and the
BosNET as the other acted and sang orchard of the forty oil-jars. These and
with great gusto; her French-English
ditty, “When Tommy sang the Mar-
seillaise,” being one of the best of many
attractive numbers. A word of praise
is due, too, to Mr. ANDRE RANDALL as
a fire-eating Spaniard, and to
Mr. ToM WALLs as a gouty but
amorous soldier. When I add
that the scene is laid in Paris
and “Beauville"—before the
War, of course—and that the
chorus is composed of ineligible
gentlemen and extremely elig-
ible ladies, who seem to enjoy
themselves as much as the
audience does, I think I have
said enough to indicate that I
too am under the influence of
High-Jinks. L.
“CHU CHIN CHOw.”
Mr. OscAR AschE's operetta-
pantomime, a variation on a
theme from the Arabian Nights,
is an excellent piece of work.
Unreserved praise is due to
the stage decoration. Mr.
Asche is no mere pilferer of
other people's ideas. He has
always been a bold experi-
menter with colour, as for in-
stance in his Taming of the
Shrew more than a decade ago, before
we had been taught by the Russians
and the rebellious painters of the new
schools how to use that excellent gift
drab monotonies.
The unabashedly tuneful, pleasantly
unsophisticated music of Mr. FREDERIck
Norton makes an agreeable undercur-
rent. It is Occidental in the frankest
possible way (without, on the other
hand, being transatlantic and boister-
ously syncopated). It is a way much
of the gods to light up our national
the brilliant miniatures set in the centre
of the black curtain—the serenade, the
cave-mouth, the silk - stall and the
harem—remain with astonishing vivid-
|ness in the memory. The whole is in

key. There is courage and imagination
throughout, and I fancy that Mr. Asch E
himself can claim a share of the credit
for the decoration which the programme
attributes to that capable stage-crafts-
man, Mr. PERCY ANDERSON.
Mr. AschE’s version of the good old
tale runs as follows. Kasim Baba (Mr.
FRANK Cochi ANE), a rich, lean, mean
merchant, has a plump and none too
faithful wife, Alcolom (Miss AILEEN
d'ORME). Ali, his brother, a well-nour-
ished, pleasantly disreputable toper, is

mated with the thin, shrewish and, to
his thinking, altogether too faithful
Mahbubah (Miss SYDNEY FAIRBROTHER
in her best fantastic vein). There is
much (too much, a good imperialist may
think) irreverent invocation of Allah
to remedy this unsymmetrical arrange-
ment. Ali's son (Mr. J. W. BRYANT) is
wooing one of Kasim's slaves, Mar-
jamah (Miss Violet Essex). Zahrat
Al-Kulub (Miss LILY BRAYTON) another
of his slaves, with a serious private
grudge against Chu Chin Chow, alleged
Chinese merchant, in fact Abu Hasan
(Mr. OscAR Asche), “shayk” of our
old friends the Forty Thieves, is the
instrument of destiny in eliminating
the robbers and their chief, in bring-
ing the young lovers together, and in
uniting that charming old reprobate
Ali to the wife of his conveniently
removed brother.
A highly immoralending no doubt, but
I should like to assure the CoMMANDER-
IN-CHIEF that the entertainment would
not disturb the most sensitive subaltern
or confuse his maiden aunt.
It is full of excellent fun. In general
it may be said that the more closely it
follows the comic opera mood the more
successful it is. Mr. CourTICE Pounds
not only charmed with his still delight-
ful tenor, but threw in a rich setting of
broad humour that made Ali the true
hero of the adventure. Thus is tradi-
tion justified of itself. Mr. Asche was
more diverting in his comic opera ca-
pacity of Chinese mandarin merchant
than convincing in the rôle of horrific
desperado. There was enough by way
of serious relief in the little love idyll,
and a charming drawing-room love-
song in the first Act set the audience
humming. I was not so much im-
pressed by the theme of the passion-
ate desert-bred slaves led by Zahrat
Al-Kulub, chafing under the artificial
restraints of conventional Baghdad.
Handsome Miss LILY BRAYTON had
the art to put some conviction into this
business, but nothing could have been
more hopelessly respectable than the
bevy of wholesome young English misses
trying to be frightfully passionate in
the Oriental manner. The dancing in-
deed, it has to be confessed, was with-
out distinction, and less in the picture
than one had a right to expect.
There were a few pleasant incongru-
ities to delight the flippant stallite. I
cannot recall the precise rules of Bagh-
dad wrestling, but the match in Kasim's

Miss de Maie greeted our representa-

Tears dimmed the pansy eyes of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHY GO TO GERMANY :
OUR spa has come into its own since
the War. The Secretary told me so
the first morning as I was coyly sip-
ping it out of a yellow glass. He said
there was no water in Germany like it.
I wished there was. If I had my
way I would make the brutes drink
it. I hastened to agree with him, as
I ºtully chewed the second
spoonful.
“Oh,” said he, “you will like it in
“Was he cured ?” I asked.
“He must have been,” said the Sec-
retary, “for he has not come near us
since. But really that's nothing to
some of the cases we get here. It's
simply marvellous !”
I forget how, after my walk, I man-
aged to get down the second tumbler.
I think with the aid of a shoe-horn;
but my memory is not good.
“You have your Dietary Card?”
asked the Secretary, “and your Treat-
ment Card? Let me see—yes. After
I almost enjoyed them. The dietary
card was liberal except that it forbade
all drink and most kinds of food.
In the sixth week of my enforced
stay I could skip up the steps leading
to the pump-room. The Secretary
caught me at it. “Aha!” said he,
“didn't I tell you that Harrington
Wells would make a new man of you?
Then, as I say and always have said,
why go to Germany?”
“Because, my dear Mr. Secretary, I
am going. Thanks to you, the doctor
time. The odour at first is a
little against it, but you will
find it grows on you.” d
I hoped it wouldn't. It re- |
minded me at times of a W.
cabbage I once met in a state
of senile decay in the company
of some eggs who had not
died young. The cabbage was
old enough to know isetter,
but this fresh young innocent
water came gushing to meet
you from a marble basin where
an attendant nymph pressed
an unobtrusive button on the
floor. I wrestled with another
spoonful. -
“It has a taste of its own,”
I said. “I feel better already.
Perhaps I have had enough

“Tut, tut,” said he, “that
will never do. Your prescrip-
tion, if you remember, dis-
tinctly specifies two tumblers,
with a short walk in between.
Dr. Abernethy Galen is very
strict and is annoyed if his
patients do not follow his
orders to the letter.”
“You are right,” I said. “I

had prescribed two walks with
a short tumbler in between.

more of the stuff with my teeth. My
memory then seemed to go altogether
with part of my palate.
“There was a man here only last
month,” the Secretary was saying as I
came to, “who was far worse than you.
He used to drag one foot after the
other, if you follow me, and sometimes
just the opposite. He came up to that
counter and drank off one glass boiling
hot without thinking. I never saw
such a change in a man's face. Was

glass on the counter and his two feet
simply raced away with him to the door

And so the merry time went gaily on.
No gout in the world, and this was
really my grandfather's, could possibly
stand those two morning drinks, those
boilings, that dietary card. The drinks,
even as the Secretary said, I got used
to in time. If I did not forget to brace

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Alice-alone was one of six children of an English country-
gentleman, and in The Park Wall (CASSELL) her history has
been written for us by ELINoR MoRDAUNT. Alice in her
childhood started on the great adventure by running away
from home in order to join a travelling circus. Foiled in
this aspiration after the ideal, this strange delightful girl
was thrown back upon the prosaic details of every-day
life, until one morning she saw Ralph Towers riding by in
company with her father, and let him in through the postern
in the park wall. Hence the title of the book and hence
also the unhappiness of Alice. Ralph was a coarse, impetu-
ous bounder, and villain, but Alice noticed only his high
colour and his good looks, and, unfortunately for herself, fell
in love with him and married him. He took her out with
him to Terracine, which is a British possession in the
Indian Ocean. Its inhabitants are half English and half
French, partly white and partly brown, with all the varying
shades that come between. In such an atmosphere Ralph's
bounderism and his rascality developed rapidly. He ill-used
Alice in every possible way, and finally concocted a success-
ful plot to ruin her by luring her on to a steamer bound for
home, and then pretending she had run away from him.
The subsequent developments must be read in the story
itself, which, I must add, is an excellent piece of literary
work admirably put together. Nothing in it is more
remarkable than the power and restraint of the writer in
her description of a crisis. Equally good is her portrayal
of character, especially of the infamous character of Ralph
and of the beautiful but ineffective character of Alice, with its
mixture of calm strength and emotional weakness. I have
no hesitation in commending this book to those who read
novels and like to deal with real live people. I give Miss
MoRDAUNT an alpha plus, although she permits herself
occasionally to use the word “sense" as a verb.
Mr. John HERON LEPPER's name is unfamiliar to me, but
whether I am right or wrong in supposing A Tory in Arms
(GRANT RICHARDs) to be a “first book,” it is both in style
and substance a most valiant effort. The scenes of this
intriguing story are laid in Antrim in (and after) 1715—two
hundred years ago, you will perceive, though I, at any rate,
had sometimes a difficulty in remembering it, for things
happened in Ireland in those days much as they do to-day.
But with Mr. LEPPER to chronicle them and throw about
them something of the glamour of Robert Louis STEVEN-
sox's romanticism, their picturesque side is so vividly
presented that one's sympathies are with the men who
defied the law. In 1715, I may remind you, a Tory was
not a thorough-paced Conservative, but “an outlawed
robber,” and you will be hard to please if Neeshy Hockon,
both in the quality and quantity of his crimes, does not fill
the part to your complete satisfaction.
I can well understand that the writing of The End of a
Chapter (CoNSTABLE) must have given great pleasure to
Mr. SHANE LESLIE, just as I can fancy that, being a
member of a great and ancient Irish family, he took no
small delight in outraging the susceptibilities of his rela-
tions when in 1910 he came forward as a candidate for

Derry City in the Nationalist interest. He appears to
have all the marks that prove a man a rebel against
conventional stupidity. This book of his, written while he
was invalided in hospital during the War, cannot fail to
amuse and interest. It is a little volume of reminiscences
of family life, of Eton and Cambridge and society, put
together when the writer has but lately turned the great
age of thirty. “People,” he says, “who are old enough to
write memoirs have usually lost their memory. Fresh
Mr. LESLIE, at any rate,
though fresh, has plenty of memoirs, and rarely fails to do
justice to them. His style is crisp and sparkling, and his
sentences, although they are short (like the sentences
formerly used by Mr. HERBERT PAUL), have an explosive
quality which is distinctly attractive. For instance, he
says that “In winning the Derby during his premiership
Lord RosBBERY experienced a moral grandeur that pre-
vented his taking any serious part in politics again,” and “a
general result [of a consideration of the religion of England]
the persons of the story are alive, though the subdued
circumstances in which they move prevent them (and their
creator) from the engaging wit that I recall in her former
work. But if you want an artistic and truthful story, and
don't mind having your sympathies somewhat harrowed,
House Room should certainly figure on your next library
list.
In a preliminary paragraph to The Winged Victory
(HEINEMANN) its author, Madame SARAH GRAND, is care-
ful to assure us that though her story contains the person-
ages of Adnam's Orchard it is “an entirely independent
composition, with a central interest dependent on nothing
that has preceded or may succeed it.” In other words, as
they say of the less exalted serials, you can start now.
The trouble is that, having started, you may find, with me,
that the interest of the story is not only independent of the
past and future, but not very securely held in the present.
To put my complaint briefly, The Winged Victory seemed
makes English Christianity sentimental rather than theo- to me intolerably long-winded. It takes more than six
logical. It tends to save
appearances rather than
souls.” I should not feel lº
that I had done my duty
by Mr. LESLIE unless I
pointed out to him some
mistakes. Here are three.
Berwick - on - Tweed, he
says, is neither English
nor Scotch. As a matter
of fact it is English. He
tells us that there was an
old teacher of ºathematics
at Cambridge who used to
counsel “a little low cun-
ning” in meeting problems.
Was it not rather a
classical scholar who de-
nounced the low cunning
of algebra? And finally,
Mr. LESLIE must learn º
that the British won the ºzº
battle of Bunker Hill—a
fact which, as sº
often point out, has not "“” ” - - -
prevented America from keeping the hill. Altogether
I heartily recommend this book for its sparkle, its com-
prehensiveness and its total lack of respect.
I do not know whether Miss IDA WILD hails from the
further side of the Atlantic; but once or twice in the course
of House Room (LANE) I have detected her in certain free-
doms with the English language that suggested an origin
not only wild, but Western. Having yielded to the temp-
tation of saying this, I hasten to add that the point is of
very slight importance compared with the fact that the
author has once again, as in the earlier Zoe the Dancer,
proved herself mistress both of originality in plot and a
strangely attractive style. Nothing very much happens in
House Room. It is the story of a girl married to a quite
pleasant man, who subsequently loses his reason. Thence-
forward, the plot concerns her unhappy position as a wife
only in law. The end is both original and convincing. If
I have a criticism it is that Miss WILD’s restraint of
manner, conspicuous elsewhere in the tale, seems rather to
desert her when dealing with the domestic horror produced
by Arnold's increasing mania. There is too much detail
here, and it is inexcusably painful. As before, Miss WILD

the real solution was that the heroine, in the Gilbertian
manner, had been changed in infancy, and consequently
was not what she seemed. In point of fact she was—but
perhaps you may like to ascertain this for yourself. For
my own part I confess I was by that time too jaded to
greet the disclosure with any very lively emotion.

OFFICIAL TEUTON TRIUMPHS.
WILLIAM To HIS PEoPLE.
[According to the Vossische Zeitung the KAISER has issued an order
to secure uniformity in “the celebration of victories.” . In future the
Prussian Minister of War will decide what is and what is not
“a victory,” and, when a victory is official, orders will be issued for the
hoisting of flags on public buildings and the firing of salutes, while
the ecclesiastical authorities will send out telegrams ordering the
ringing of church bells.] - - -
WHEN may you boom a Victory, and why?
Who gives you leave to let the bunting fly
And loud carillons rock the staggered steeples?
Official lips alone can state
Whether the facts demand a fête,
And not the common people's.
A private citizen should never cheer,
Or drink delight of battle with his beer,
Or touch-off cannon at his own volition. -
True sons of Germany will not
Do anything until they've got
Authority's permission.
So don't expand the individual chest
Over our fine offensive in the West
For joy of some obscure affair of pickets;
But rather stand in silent queues
Till we announce the sort of news
That warrants Victory-tickets.
Nor yet indulge in desultory shouts
Based on the view that our intrepid scouts
Are busy ravaging Rumania's borders;
Wait for a real official scoop,
Then let the total nation whoop
By military orders.
Trust us, ere long, to organise a show
Where in the wind all flags at once shall blow
With general salvos uniformly flashing;
As, when the Lusitania sank,
With one accord we danced and drank
And had the joy-bells clashing.
When we have flattened London's final street,
And for a second time our glorious fleet
Sets ocean from the tyrant's cruel spell free,
Wave, flags! and, cannon, belch your fire
And to your flocks, ye bishops, wire, -
Saying, “Bring down the belfry !” O. S.
THE ZEPPELIN-PROOF LANDLADY.
I chose my present abode simply and solely because
my landlady is a comfortable person to have in the house
when, as she herself phrases it, “the Zepps is about.”
In the world of “Apartments" by some curious law of
equilibrium the higher one ascends financially and socially
the lower one descends physically, till the bed-rock of the
drawing-room floor is reached; and the lower one descends
financially and socially, the higher one ascends physically,
till one's head almost touches the roof and the stars are
one's close companions. My lot was with the stars.
“A good target for Zeppelins,” I remarked when my
landlady showed me the room. This was more by way of
conversation than anything else.
She stiffened slightly, as people stiffen when the names
of people they do not like are mentioned.
“We don't take no notice of no Zeppelins in this 'ouse,”
she said.
She was a big buxom woman of the type usually
described as “motherly.” Her bald statement in its
Spartan simplicity, its calm ignoring of all the malefic
powers of darkness, filled me with silent admiration, and a
great peace stole over me in her ample presence.
“The last time the Zepps was 'ere,” she continued,
“Maudie—that's my youngest—came '9me from her work
with her ſyce as white as a bit of pyper. “Mother,' she
says to me, “they say the Zepps is coming to-night.”
“‘Well, child,’ says I to her, “if they is, they is, and
there's an end of it. It's no use myking a song or looking
white about it. That don't do nobody no good.'
“But, if you'll believe me, that child could not rest. She
kept going to the winder every 'arf-hour. Before she
went to bed she had one more look, and just when her 'and
was on the blind there came a crash. Lor! you'd think
twenty ton of coal had been dropped just outside the winder.
“‘’Ark, mother ' ' she says, ‘’ark, 'ark I Do you 'ear?'
“‘If you don't stop that 'arking,' I says, ‘you’ll give us
all the creeps, and your pore father in bed this hour and
more trying to get a bit of sleep." -
“The words was 'ardly out of my mouth when there was
another big bang, you'd think the whole street was bust
up, and the sky as red as a bit of beetroot. Between you
and me"—and she lowered her voice as if ashamed of this
confession of weakness—“I don't mind seeing 'em again,
but I never want to 'ear 'em no more.
“The lydy who 'ad this very room we are standing in
now (she's in a nursing-home now, pore thing!) came
running down the stairs in her nightgown, with her 'air
down. , ‘Oh, Mrs. Bloggs,’ says she all trembling, ‘the
Zepps is come ! Whatever shall we do 2'
“‘I'm afraid we can't do nothink, Miss,' I says to her,
“but stay where we are and see what will 'appen."
“And nothink did 'appen. As I says to my 'usband,
“you tyke no notice of the Zepps and the Zepps will tyke
no notice of you.’
“Yes, that will be ten-and-sixpence, baths and light
extra, and one week's notice when you leave.”
But I don't intend to leave—not till the War is over.
TO FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT ROBINSON, V.C.
YoU with the hawk's eyes and the nerves of steel,
How was it with you when the hurried word
Roused you and sent you swiftly forth to deal
A blow for justice 2 Sure your pulses stirred,
And all your being leapt to meet the call
Which bade you strike nor spare
Where poised in air
Murder and ravening flame were hid intent to fall.
Alone upon your fearful task you flew,
Where in the vault of heaven the high stars swing,
Alone and upward, lost to mortal view,
Winding about the assassin craft a ring
Of fateful motion, till at last you sped
Through the far tracts of gloom
- The bolt of doom,
Shattering the dastard foe to earth with all his dead.
For this we thank you, and we bid you know
That henceforth in the air, by day or night,
A myriad hopes of ours, where'er you go,
Rise as companions of your soaring flight;
And well we know that when there comes the need
A host of men like you,
As staunch, as true,
Will rush to prove the daring of the island breed.

I was describing, the other week, the

lounge by the fall of a festive gentle-
In all.
But there are other ways of promot-
ing sudden friendliness less drastic than
this. I do not, of course, refer to the
presence of a Zepp in the zenith, for
that would not be proper: the Press
Bureau could hardly, even at this date,
be expected to stand that. But what
about a chameleon on the blue serge
sleeve of a purser? That may sound a
little far-fetched, but none the less I
once saw this tiny newt-like animal

ever it caught mine, to rise upwards in
the direction of the hat-rack immedi-
ately above her head, on which I had
placed my second bag. No bag was
ever deposited with more care and was
less likely to fall; but its presence was
a steady grievance to her. Another
passenger was in trouble over the win-
dows—if one of them, he said, was not
shut he would get such a neuralgia as
would probably do him in. And so forth.
It was, in short, too hot, and the train
was too slow, and there were too many
of us. -
And then the young man in blue
serge in the corner produced a dark-
green lizardy creature from a little
card-board box, and, placing it on his
sleeve, invited us to watch it assuming
a similar dark-blue colour. The won-
derful thing is that it did. I had heard
of this parlour trick of chameleons all
my life, but never had seen it done.
And neither, apparently, had anyone
else, for we all pressed round the young
man and his gifted reptile, and the next
time the woman opposite caught my
eye she smiled. -
That was some years ago, and last
week I was travelling on the L. & S. W.

in a compartment not, at any rate, con-
spicuous for camaraderie, when there

THE SONG OF THE BOMBARD.
OUR fathers rode to battle,
Our fathers did prevail,
With breastplate, greave and solleret,
|With hauberk and camail.
They broke a lance with the Knights
of France,
And flashed a five-foot blade,
All in the days of chivalry,
Before the guns were made.
Close in his flaming smithy
A ...; churl stooped and
wrought,
Hewed, hammered, pared and
measured
A wizard's life of thought . . .
Our fathers laughed, “Is the varlet
daft,
That he deems a knightly crest
Shall quake when he vomits smoke
and noise ?”
And the bombard heard them jest.
Deep in his throat he answered
(His voice was passing strong):
“Squire, Baron, Earl and Princeling,
Ye shall feel my stroke ere long !
Never a Knight in his mail so bright
But the bolts I cast can slay;”
The Knights charged home as the
bombard spoke;
And where are the Knights to-day?
List to the song of the bombard
(His voice is passing clear):
“Here in the ranks of England 1
The Red Cross Knights are here !
While still they call on the Lord of all
And die for a Knightly King,
In the souls of English gentlemen
The old white spark shall spring !”

We no longer boil our potatoes, we

THE PERSONAL NOTE.
IT seems scarcely credible, but it is
a fact that I slept through it.
I reproached myself most bitterly at
the time, and was prepared humbly to
suffer the scorn of the supercilious and
garrulous eye-witness. But I begin to
think that there were many thrilling
incidents I should have missed had I
actually observed the affair instead of
merely hearing of it.
I feel now that I have seen it with
many pairs of eyes and from many
points of view, whereas you—over
whose house I have no doubt it hovered
for twenty minutes—you, who turn a
most impatient ear to other witnesses,
have only your own imagination to fall
back upon.
My cousin Adela was the first to
discover my welcome ignorance. With
a willing tongue she tried to make me
feel the thrill of that wonderful night.
She had been reading late in her
room. She had had a headache, she
told me, and couldn't sleep. She so
seldom has a headache, and puts it
down to the sudden change in the
weather, though there certainly is a
possibility that it may be due to eye-
strain. Well, she had just shut her
book and was in the very act of switch-
ing off the light when—there it was.
She found it simply impossible to
describe her feelings—under three
thousand words, that is. She dressed
hastily, hurried downstairs, and calling
to her dog, who, poor little mite, didn't
realise Well, Adela really is ridicu-
lous! I never for a moment supposed
that her little dog would understand
what was happening.
Charles who, though anxious to be
dramatic, is not a sufficiently experi-
enced eyewitness to observe that sus-
pense is merging into boredom, had
been to a theatre. That thing at the
So-and-So's. I really ought to see it.
Yes, he'd been to the theatre. Doesn't
often go these days, you know, but any-
how, there he was. And coming home
rather late, after quite a jolly little
supper, and walking, by the way—
couldn't get a taxi. (No use trying to
persuade me it was war economy, eh
Knew him too well he supposed.)
Well, walking home—it was rather a
nice night, you know, though a trifle
misty—he was just saying to himself
that he shouldn't be surprised—when
he distinctly heard
The next morning in the train Jones
told me that, although he hadn't taken
any notice of it at the time—these
things are very strange without a doubt
—probably coincidence—he was not
a superstitious man—but there it was
for what it was worth—he had some-
how felt there was something in the
air. He awoke at five minutes to one
—he remembered the exact time be-
cause the clock downstairs— Poor
Jones! The train came to the ter-
minus before he came to the point.
So you see I know what everyone
was doing at the critical moment, what
had led up to their doing that particu-
lar thing at that particular time, and
in what psychological state they then
were and have since remained.
The only thing I am not very clear
about is what actually happened.
When Smith comes home from Wales
next week I mean to tell him all about it.

With the tall wand he waves about,

It will be windy out to-day;

THE EDUCATIONIST.
(To AGNES REPPLIER.)
THE War has silenced many bores, and brought a few to
light,
Whose versatile activities in peace were hid from sight;
But of all phese public nuisances, except the Pacifist,
The most egregious idiot is the Educationist,
He views the English Public Schools with infinite disdain:
They make a fetish of “good form” and still uphold the cane.
Classics he holds in horror—why worship what is dead?
And he's longing to establish Esperanto in their stead.
He listens with religious awe to all the chat of WELLs,
And all his letters to the Press phonetically spells;
He has a bust of FROEBEL in his library enshrined,
With MoRTEssoRI's portrait by the dottoressa signed.
He writes unending essays in the Neo-Humanist,
And also in the Pestalozzian Infantologist;
And the volume of pure “uplift” that he generates each
week -
Robs the Notes of WooDRow WILSON of their character
unique.
Armed with a fearful jargon, best described as Greco-Yank,
Stuffed full of pseudo-science and of psychologic swank,
He loves to test and calibrate the infantile machine,
And show its inner workings on the moving-picture screen.
He's great on teaching children the effects of alcohol,
And the superfine significance implicit in the doll;
The cult of bare-foot dancing he applauds, and bids us aim
At turning each scholastic task into a cheerful game. -
In his prophetic vision the wondrous modern child,
Into the paths of knowledge by the cinema beguiled,
And girt with ethical restraints, will issue from the fog
Of old-world superstition that enshrouds the Decalogue.
He has never read Isai AH or a line of SHAKSPEARE's plays–
Why should he, when they lived in ante-Paedologic days?
But he's studied ev'ry sort of book on ev'ry sort of school,
And synthesized CoNFUCIUs and the code of Mrs. Boole.
He's an expert in eliciting the dim subconscious soul
And in shaping “child-material” to a complex rhythmic
whole;
But one great elemental truth he never yet has known,
That children sometimes benefit from being left alone.
He's not a fool, I grant you, and he can't be called a knave,
He's earnest and well-meaning, and he's Duty's strenuous
slave;
But I'm sometimes driven to believe he wants to win the
War
To promote the sole survival of the pedant and the bore.
Journalistic Modesty.

siding, however, and main points of
agreement being taken for granted, the
time duly arrived in which Angéline
began to see in her Edwin certain
tiresome little habits, requiring to be
corrected; and Edwin came to compare
his Angéline with the ideal of his
dreams, to the disadvantage of the
former, in certain minor particulars.
There were even times at which
momentary temper got the better of
tactful intentions, and these details
were referred to frankly, perhaps even
too frankly. There were little cold-
nesses, some heartburnings and, at
heart, some gloomy thoughts of break-
ing off engagements and committing
suicides.
The reconciliations were punctual to
schedule and true to type, extravagant
and delightful; the aftermath was of
the orthodox character. Edwin and
Angéline, having placed beyond dis-
pute their mutual affection and loy-
alty, next proceeded to criticize each
other's people. “For your boldness
and strength, my dear Edwin,” said
Angéline, “my admiration is profound

to criticise his own people but was

are the occasional moments when
Angéline says, “Edwin, how many
times have I told you not to do that ?”
Edwin will also venture, “Angéline, -
my dear, for once you must permit me
to know best.” Am I encouraging the
enemy in saying this? I trust not,
indeed. I should never forgive myself
if I raised hopes in the bosom of the
poor dear Bosch destined to so dismal
a disappointment.
Picture to yourself a narrow country
lane. - First goes an empty lorry, pro-
ceeding at ten miles an hour; second,
running to catch it up and get a lift, a
French permissionaire; third, my little
'bus, capable of holding two, but, at
the moment, containing myself only.
I blow my horn violently, but in vain;
the F.P. considers it more important
that he should overtake the lorry than
that I should overtake him. My right
wing actually touching his left leg, he
steps aside at last, and the lorry has
departed without him. I, too, am past
him, but I cannot leave the matter at
that. A sharp rebuke to the man is
necessary. Hot with angry words, I
pull up and wait for him to come
along and be admonished. He observes
that I have something to say to him,
and runs up to hear what it may be.
He arrives before I have my bitter
speech completely prepared. He
stands, smiling, as if to say, “You wish
to speak to me?” My answering look
indicates clearly that I do, but I am at a
loss for the proper words. He guesses
what it is. “Merci, m'sieu,” he says,
opens the door, gets in, and sits down
beside me. “Merci, m'sieu,” he re-
peats, and I am so overcome that I
accept his point of view, and him.
Naturally of a simple mind, he was
on this occasion not quite master of
himself.
He had only been on leave

six hours; he was what the phrase
bien élevé does not, but should, in my
opinion, mean. As we proceed, he
insists upon conversation, but has little
faith in my powers. “Bons cama-
rades,” he says, very distinctly. No
reply appearing to be called for I make
none. “Bons,” he tries again, “cama-
rades. Nous,” he taps his chest and mine,
“nous—bons—camarades.” I assure
him that this is understood. He doesn't
believe me, and makes sure, some twenty
times. There follows a period for silent
thought. Then he starts again, roused
by the sound of distant guns. “Com-
pris?” he begins. “Bons . . . canons.”
Being distracted by many things, and
more especially by his tendency to put
his hand on the steering wheel in order
to emphasise his points, I do not listen
as carefully as I should. “Oui, oui,
oui,” I shout in my wrath. “C'est

“Oui,” says I, and he has hopes.
“Bons canons” ” he continues
anxiously.
“Oui,” say I. “Bons camarades.

Perfectly delighted, he now takes
both my hands in his, and comes to
the point to which he has been leading
all the time. .
“Victoire ' " he shouts, and we are
firm friends for life.

(Suggested by Professor KEITH's Paper
at the British Ass.) .
I've been reading in the Press
Great Professor KEITH's address
On the facial alteration
Of our somewhat complex nation
Since Duke WILLIAM's Norman bow-
Innen
Overthrew the English yeomen,
And I find that his conclusion
Only tends to my confusion.
First he tells us that our faces
Grew a lot more round in places,
Till our cheek-bones' prominence
Was no longer so intense.
But research, it seems, discloses
We developed sharper noses,
And, according to our KEITH,
Shrunken jaws and weaker teeth.
Finally this truth he culls
From comparison of skulls
That, although we're taller, stronger,
Facially we're narrower, longer.
Hence, for bettering of the breed
He insists upon the need
Of a census to inquire
Why our fitness is not higher.
Possibly the Press report
Is imperfect or too short
Adequately to present
The Professor's argument.
Anyhow, relief one draws
From the fact that weaker jaws
And a “decadence of cheek"
Have not made us slack or weak;
Though our nostrils may be smaller,
Than the men who did their bits
When the Normans gave us Fitz.
An Ambiguous Compliment.
From a Parish Magazine:—
“Everyone will be glad to feel that the
Vicar is taking a longer holiday this year by
the doctor's orders.”
“Pekin duck eggs (American), excellent for
laying and table; grow quickly.”
Irish Paper.
With prices so high the expanding egg
should be popular.
“Every ship is boarded by the medical
officer on reaching this country, and careful
injuries are made.”—Evening Paper.
Hitherto we were under the impression
that it was only the plumber who
manufactured jobs for his professional
brethren.
“Following announcement is substituted

AFTER the 53rd Lancers had been in
the trenches for seven days—during
which period the Bosch hated them
ceaselessly with whizz-bangs, tear-
shells, snipers, coal-boxes, hand and
rifle grenades, spring guns, rifle bat-
teries, machine guns, gas and liquid
fire; and something celestial leaked
badly so that the front-line gave a
muddy imitation of the Grand Canal,
Venice—the Infantry relieved them and
they came out looking like nothing on
earth.
They were marched into an ex-dye-
factory, boiled, fourteen in a vat, issued
with a change of under-clothes and
marched on to billets.
The 53rd being a smart regiment,
they were given twenty-four hours to
lick and polish themselves like unto
the stars of the firmament for bright-
ness, or never hear the last of it.
In twenty-four hours they paraded
again, according unto orders, and the
stars of the firmament also ran.
At noon the same day the party pro-
ceeding on Blighty leave was paraded
for inspection by the Orderly Officer.
Pending the arrival of the O.O. the
Regimental Sergeant-Major gave them
a preliminary look-over.

effect and with effect. If unlikely ro-
mantic comedies are still to be written
––and why not ?—this is the way to
write them: really adroit stage-craft,
humour kept well in the key, plausible
characterisation—plausible, not “con-
vincing,” as the saying is. And all
interpreted by a capable cast.
James Lane Fountain (Mr. DU MAU-
RIER) is coming back to his native
village of Dormer St. Nicholas with a
long memory and a long purse. The
memory is of a wrong done to his mother
by some man (whose name has never
crossed his mother's lips) and by the
squire - and - parson-led village which
hounded her overseas with her brat
into an institoot. The purse is the
carefully loaded weapon of his revenge.
J. L. F., the brat who has made good,
returns in the name of a dead remit-
tance-man, whose two aunts keep his
memory green and live only for his
homecoming. It is J. L. F.'s little
plot to buy up Dormer St. Nicholas, to
turn out squire, parson, doctor and any
other who had a hand in his mother's
exile, and make the village bow down
before his little momma, who is to be
mistress (who had been maid) in Par-
ramer Hall. He loads the village with
gifts, cricket grounds and unwanted
bath-rooms; he takes in and is taken
in by his aunts; and when everybody
loves him he springs his mine, and you
who know your stage can guess the
rest—the long-lost father, the mag-
nanimous mother, the course of true
love needlessly corrugated and so forth.
But why guess? Why not go and see
a first-rate team of players and listen
to a charmingly impossible little story?
And if you don't wipe away a furtive
tear occasionally or swallow hard
(between the laughs) I shall be mighty
surprised. -
| The artist in Mr. DU MAURIER always
rises to the occasion which he so rela-
tively seldom allows himself. This
marvellous rectangular suit, this arched
footgear, this pearl fedora, is filled out
with a real American citizen (Seattle,
Wash.). Certainly our DU MAURIER of
the pleasant if too familiar business
has disappeared; and what was so dex-
terous was the restraint of it and the
little flames of tenderness, anger and
passion. Mr. A. E. GEORGE's more

The Misleading Lady depends largely
on whether you do or don't find the
antics of a lunatic amusing. Finding
them myself about as mirth-provoking
as the sight of a blind man falling over
a chair I missed a good deal of the
point of this disjointed farce.
Helen Steele, engaged to an unpleas-
ant American strong man, Tracey, the
kind that empties automatics into
stickers when they annoy him, makes
a bet that she will induce Jack
Craigem, a traveller among the Pata-
gonians, to propose to her. If she
What two charming old dears of aunts | wins she is to be leading lady in a
forthcoming play. Of course she does,
and of course in the five days' hunt
she learns to love her quarry, but
won't admit it. Craigen, his heart
in splints, draws himself up very proud
and points out that she is a real dan-
ger to society, that her dress is much
too pretty and deliberately designed
to ensnare the helpless male. Helen
ups, and says, Why not 2 That is
what it's for. And why shouldn't it
be 2—in a spirited defence. And I'm
bound to say I'm all for Helen in
the matter, not so much on the merits
of her case as in reaction from the ap-
palling priggishness of Craigen's point
of view. -
Craigen, not really a bad sort, ap-
proves her spirit. Taking up her chal-
lenge that he knows nothing about
women, and remembering a Patagonian
tip, he stuffs her head in his motor-coat
and carries her off in his car to his
shooting-lodge in the Adirondacks—to
study her. After suitable back-chat
between the pair (the only chaperon is
an unexpected lunatic in the loft who
has wandered in and imagines himself
to be NAPOLEoN) she fetches him one
on the head with the telephone receiver.
Then in an ecstasy of remorse she
renders him first-aid and goes out into
| the night without her slippers. And all
ends as it should.
There was a queer lack of coherence
in this tragi-farce. I suspect Mr.
GoDDARD to have invented the mis-
leading lady; Mr. DICKEY, the lunatic.
Then they just pooled their assets
and hoped for the best. Neither of
them seemed to be interested in the
First Act, which, I suppose, is why
nearly everybody said everything four
times.
Mr. MALcol M. CHERRY was quite
good fun in the lighter passages of his
part. Mr. WEEDON GRossMITH as the
unfortunate Boney gave a no doubt
excellent performance of its kind—but
a bad kind. Miss GLADYs CoopFR
throws more than her beauty into her
work and is becoming very skilful,
notably increasing the emotional range
of her voice. Mr. CECIL SULLY and
Mr. LAMBERT TERRY gave a really droll
representation of the two jovial students
who had lost their way (and no wonder)
and were looking for an island. Mr.
ARTHUR FINN was a plausible (but not
very necessary) journalist. By the
way, no lover of dogs cares to see such
a dispirited performance as that put up
by the wolf-hound. T.

Brown (who is trying to let his furnished house). “THINK IT's RATHER BARE For A DINING-Room ? WELL, PERHAPs IT Is A LITTLE.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN How WE'VE FURNISHED THE CELLAR.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE population of the United States is at present divided
into two schools of thought. One holds that the country
is in a state of lamentable unpreparedness, which should be
remedied at once, before Luxemburg or Monaco or some
other powerful invader happens along. The other, while
admitting the unpreparedness, denies that America needs
any other defences than its mosquitoes and President WIL-
soN's typewriter. Mr. CLEVELAND MoFFETT belongs to the
former school. He thinks that the United States should
possess at least one aeroplane that can fly, and at any rate
a handful of men whose mothers have not raised them not
to be soldiers. In pursuance of this dream he has written
The Conquest of America (HopDER AND Stoughton), a book
of the kind that used to be eagerly read in this country in
the nineties. Designed to make the national flesh creep,
it tells of the invasion of the United States by Germany
in 1921, and is a powerful piece of work, marred of course
by the impossible happy ending which the authors of these
books always throw in by way of consolation. There are
several significant passages, notably that describing the
Battle of the Susquehanna, where the entire German army
is burned alive in oil supplied by Mr. John D. RocKEFELLER.
This is significant because Mr. RocKEFELLER apparently
supplied the oil free, a marked deviation from his usual
practice. It is lucky for America that the invasion did not
take place in 1916, before the great financier's heart became
softened and patriotic. Another passage shows that there
is a bright side even to invasion, where Mr. Moff ETT tells
of a visit of a German officer to the premises of The New
York Evening Journal. “If the paper continues to appear,”
he tells the editor, “you will be shot, and William Ran-
dolph Hearst will be shot.” No one who knows The New
York Evening Journal can read a thing like that without a
wistful sigh.
Publication in these days is nothing if not contempora-
neous. Hardly has an event happened before the impetuous
bookmakers are upon it, consolidating the position with
their quills and ink-horns. So I ought really not to be
surprised that already a couple of volumes dealing with
the Irish Rising have reached my table. Considering that
the theme of each is the same, they are about as unlike as
any two books could be. One is The Irish Rebellion of
1916 (CoNSTABLE), an unemotional history of the move-
ment, written for the benefit of neutrals and posterity, by
Mr. John E. Boyle. The other, much slighter, is called
The Sinn Fein Rebellion as I saw It (SMITH, ELDER), and is
made up of letters written to a friend by Mrs. HAMILTON
Norway, the wife of the Secretary for the Post Office in
Ireland. Roughly speaking, the difference between the two
books is that between a technical treatise on bee-keeping,
and a lively account of falling into a hive. I have sufficiently
indicated the nature of Mr. Boy LE's work; of Mrs. Norway
it may be said that she wields a sprightly pen, and that her
four letters supply a story of adventure that is amazingly
full of human interest. They are written from the Royal
Hibernian Hotel, and describe the hazards to which the
writer, her husband and son were exposed during the grim
days that followed Easter Monday. Frankly personal and
intimate in style, and at times (one fancies) verging upon
indiscretion, this little book is just the kind that will one

persuade the young lady at the library to get for you A
Broken Toy (CoNSTABLE), by K. KEITH. Poppy Mainwaring
was the daughter of an aimless gentleman of independent
but quite inadequate means, who jilted Lady Olga Harnault
(she had “thousands” and belonged to the odd end of the
smart set) for a girl from the Sappho, which light-hearted
and light-footed one duly left him and came to a bad end.
Lady Olga conceives the paltry idea of punishing Main-
waring through his daughter. She waits patiently eighteen
years or so with this queer dirk in her stocking, becomes
Poppy's fast friend, loads her with jewels, and when the
heaven-sent occasion serves contrives that Anton Duval
should take the fair Poppy on the river. Given heredity
operating at its baldest, and a man with a name like that,
and the deplorable Marlow atmosphere—and the toy is as
good as broken, Lady Olga, who alone had the courage of
her convictions, smiles her sinister smile and goes on smok-
ing too many cigarettes. Poppy's little loyal friend, Marie-
José, and the vague kindly Mrs. Mannering, her incompetent
chaperon, and the pleasantly rude Galton, knight-in-attend-
ance on Mrs. Morecombe, are skilfully sketched in. If Poppy
and Lady Olga need a faith which is denied me, there's no
reason why you should share my scepticism.

is as unlovely a specimen of a villain as you can, even

noxious way he is not the outstanding character of the

and virtue, Mr. STAcPoolE has given us someone who
will linger in the memory long after Macquart, for all his

There is much diversity of opinion as to the safest place

TO A HUN FEEDING.
[The Lokalanzeiger comments upon the changes which the War has
brought about in German manners at table.]
WHEN for our sins we 've fed with you for neighbour,
Seen in your bloated neck the napkin tucked,
Flinched at the toothpick brandished like a sabre
And lips that slobbered as the soup was sucked;
When we observed you mopping up the gravy or
Gargling your gutturals in the finger-bowl,
It seemed improbable that this behaviour
Reflected Culture's soul.
Still less we thought that any fresh conditions
Could cause your table manners to decline;
Yet Fate has amplified those exhibitions,
Making you even nastier when you dine;
For now, like naked niggers out in Fiji,
You gnaw your meat-bones up against your nose,
Swabbing your plate with bread as with a squeegee
Until the polish glows.
Well, this is War, and War means famine prices
(As Paris learnt within your leaguer's lines);
And Culture's self must make her sacrifices
Undreamed in her original designs; -
What then 2 Of ruth and truth you've kept no traces;
Your honour you have lightly blown in air;
Surely a little loss of meal-time graces
Should not be hard to bear ! O. S.
THEIR HOLIDAY BIT.
It was Mrs. Montmorency who thought of it. She is so
clever and original. Wentworth Montmorency and m
little Fabian are home for the holidays, and Mrs. Mont-
morency said why shouldn't they go out as errand-boys?
I call it a splendid idea. The darlings are delighted and
mad to begin work at once. We have got them lovely
situations at a fishmonger's. They are to have three-and-
sixpence a week each for wages and put it in a Red Cross
money-box every Saturday night. We have bought them
new mackintoshes and goloshes. They start to-morrow
morning, and Wentworth is going to call for Fabian at nine
o'clock.
::: ::: ::: :: x:
They have just gone off together in the highest spirits.
I have waved them good-bye from the window. It is so
nice for Fabian to have a companion like Wentworth, such
an honest manly boy, so thoroughly English. They have
just turned the corner at the end of the street, their arms
are linked together, they are marching like soldiers—dear
boys! Fabian has an apricot tart in his pocket for lunch.
I wonder what Wentworth has.
::: ::: ::: :: ::
Fabian has come in for dinner. He says it is topping
being an errand-boy. He says will I give him two tarts
to-morrow, because Wentworth asked for half his to-day ?
Of course I don't in the least mind giving Wentworth
Montmorency a tart, but one has to look at everything
now, particularly at jam. Fabian says he can't stop to
finish his dinner because he has a barrel of oysters to
deliver. Dear little industrious man
sk ::: :: :: :::
Mrs. Montmorency and I have been for a walk together.
We met Fabian and Wentworth. Fabian had the oysters
on his head—such an enormous cask; the poor child
was positively weighed down. Wentworth was lounging
along with a couple of whiting dangling on his arm.
Y never known Wentworth tell a lie.
Mrs. Montmorency clasped me in a stupid sort of way and
said, “Oh, don't you feel proud of our boys 2 " I am
afraid I should have said something sharp in reply, but
at the moment Fabian dropped the oysters. Mrs. Mont-
morency laughed. She seemed to find a poor little weak
child overburdened with great heavy oysters amusing.
I was surprised. -
::: ::: × × - :k
Fabian has finished his day's work. He is dead beat;
I have put him to bed. I have been down to the fish-
monger to ask why my boy is given all the heavy work to
do. The man had no excuse to make. I told him the
boys were to carry a basket between them in future.
:: ::: :: x: xk
Mrs. Montmorency has called to ask me not to let
Fabian give Wentworth pastry again, as it gives him a
pain. She says that Fabian has let the tail of a codfish
flap against the sleeve of Wentworth's mackintosh and the
scales won't come off. She says she has been to the fish-
monger and told him to wrap up the codfishes' tails in
paper in future.
::: ::: ::: ::: :
I have been to the fishmonger and forbidden him to
give Fabian any more codfishes to carry, whether their tails
are wrapped up or not. My child is not a Hercules.

Mrs. Montmorency has sent round to say Wentworth
has lost one of his goloshes, and has Fabian taken it by
mistake? I asked Fabian, and he says he has lost one of
his, and he believes it is the one Wentworth is wearing. I
spoke to Wentworth about it, and he says he has lost the
other one now and he thinks Fabian must have both. I
have been round to Mrs. Montmorency about it, and she
says one of the boys isn't telling the truth, and she has
I have been to the
fishmonger and demanded to know where the goloshes are.
He stared like a fool and said perhaps they had been boiled
with the lobsters. This is the result of allowing Fabian to
associate with a boy like young Montmorency, a mischief-
making priggish boy, a thorough German.

Mrs. Montmorency has been to the fishmonger and

Fabian has just come in to dinner. He is very flushed

threw a crab at him. Fabian had nothing to defend

neck, and this aſternoon he will be able to take it out of
him with some scallops.

TERENCE O'LEARY.
III.
THE ELUSIVE SUBMARINE.
“IT is absolutely essential that the
men should be amused,” said Major
Tusher, walking into the little mess-
room one day and finding his subalterns
absorbed in a comparatively recent
back number of a local paper, The
Pudlington Echo and Visitors' Guide.
Lieutenant Tipping was blind to the
fact that across Gunner Donkin's broad
chest blazed a new fancy waistcoat of
his own, presented to him recently by
a maiden aunt with the pious wish
that he might “wear it of an evening
when he slipped into plain clothes
after working hours.”
The concert party looked unique
under the stars. Bombardier O'Leary,
as the right-hand-corner man, was the
success of the evening, and his song,
“Where are you going to, my pretty
Tipping was reading the news
page, and Warberry studying
the advertisement sheet, with
the misplaced zeal of men who
have nothing much to do and
a great deal of time to do it in.
“Indeed, Sir-yes, Sir,” said
Tipping, springing to his feet.
“How do you propose to
amuse them 2"
“They have not the same
advantages as ourselves, Tip-
ping,” said Major Tusher,
gravely, “although of course
they have The Pudlington Echo
when we have finished with it.
Still, I found Corporal Benny-
mede in a very depressed con-
dition this morning, weeping
because his baby had got a
tooth and he had never seen
it.”
“I consider Corporal Benny-
mede very weak-minded,” said
Warberry hotly. “He might
have been upset if his child had
failed to produce any teeth at
all, but the fact of such produc-
tion argues perfect health on
the part of his absent family.”
“Quiteso,"said Major Tusher.
“What is it, O'Leary?” -
“Corporal Bennymede was
enquirin' as to whether I would
lay the bones to-night, Sorr,
in this little bit of a gaff they
are talking about among the
men.” “I
“Play what you like, when you like
and how you like,” said Major Tusher
impatiently. “Why are you fidgeting
at the door, O'Leary 2”
“It was this way, Sorr,” said Terence.
“I have it all planned out, but there is
a dress and a black face that goes wid
the bones, Sorr.”
“I have no objection to a fancy-
dress entertainment, within limits, of
course,” said the Major, waving O'Leary
from the room.
The splendid equipment of the nigger
troupe was due in a great measure to
the generosity cf the officers' servants.
Major Tusher made no remark when
he recognised his scarlet - and - blue
dressing-gown on O'Leary's back, and

Huns?” with its encore, “The Wearin'
of the Iron Cross,” was applauded to
the echo. Even the backs of the
watch behind the gun emplacements
showed appreciation and something
more, for the voices carried a long
way in the quiet night.
Corporal Bennymede displayed a nice
taste in his Shakspearean recitation, for
it was felt that “Oh, sharper than a
serpent's thanks to have a toothless
child” was singularly appropriate to
his position. But the audience began to
exhibit signs of impatience as the even-
ing wore on, and Gunner Nankivell was
heard to enquire persistently at the end
of every song as to the reason of his own
exclusion from the troupe.
ººſºº
“I should hev been the star of the
evening,” he confided to the audience.
“With my song, “Put me among the
Girls,' I'd hev knocked spots out of
them figged-up niggers.”
It was Terence O'Leary who silenced
every objection during the short inter-
val for refreshments, when the officers
were temporarily absent.
“Sure, thin, Tim Nankivell,” he said
grimly from the edge of the platform,
“if you can answer me this question
you shall come up here and sing every
song that your grandmother
taught you wid the end of the
broom-handle.”
“And what may the ques-
tion be 2 "said Tim Nankivell
º º defiantly.
º º “Why is my headlike a fool's
% head 2" returned the right-
& % hand-corner - man with the
Ž bland innocence of a child.
& “And for why is it?” re-
W turned Gunner Nankivell un-
:ſº
wisely.
“Because it is the spit and
image of your own,” said
Terence O'Leary, and the con-
cert party pursued their well-
ordered way, while Nankivell
spent the remainder of the
evening in considering whether
it would be advisable to de-
ſ mand an explanation from
O'Leary later in the evening.
The state of the tide had
only been called twice from
the walls before an orderly was
observed to approach Major

shore during thirty-six hours' leave.

Harrington at the four-point-seven, and
may the Saints preserve us, but whether
he looked the greater judy than me I will

“and hwat became of the submarine”

O'Leary whistled a few bars of “The

“It was what the Brigade Office said

“That's a good tune,” said Bom-
bardier Molloy, “and you have the

“The Brigade Office is a black-

said Molloy.
Terence O'Leary's eyes shone with
suppressed feeling.
“They wished the garrison of Fort
Mornington had been buried along with
the biscuit box in the blackest pit of
all,” he said slowly. “My cousin
would be set up, sending that word
along.” --
“I don't care a thraneen about your.
cousin,” said Molloy from the bed,
“but hwat did the Ould Man say about
it all 2 ”
“I could not repate his language,”
said O'Leary, busy with the grease-pot;
“but it was all shpoke afther he was
parted from the tallyphone, and most
of it was shpoke to Gunner Huggins,
who gave the alarm.”
“Glory be to God,” said Molloy
piously, “for John Huggins was niver
a friend to me and I was niver a friend
to him.”
“If you guessed the half of your life,”
continued Terence O'Leary impres-
sively, “you could never set your
mind to the answer that Gunner
Huggins gave to the Ould Man when he
had finished shpakin.”
“And hwat might the answer be?”
said Molloy breathlessly.
“I was behind the door, mind you,
Patrick, and heard it all before iver I
could walk away,” replied O'Leary very
slowly. “Gunner Huggins, salutin'

THE LITTLE SHIPS.

Who to the deep in ships go down
Great marvels do behold,
But comes the day when some must

In the grey sea and cold.
For galleons lost great bells do toll,
But now must we implore
God's ear for sunken Little Ships
Who are not heard of more.
When ships of war put out to sea
They go with guns and mail,
That so the chance may equal be
Should foemen them assail;
But Little Ships men's errands run
And are not clad for strife;
God's mercy then on Little Ships
Who cannot fight for life.
To warm and cure, to clothe and feed
They stoutly put to sea,
And since that men of them had need
Made light of jeopardy;
Each in her hour her fate did meet
Nor flinched nor made outcry;
God's love be with these Little Ships
Who could not choose but die.
To friar and nun, and every one
Who lives to save and tend,
Sisters were these whose work is
done
And cometh thus to end ;
Full well they knew what risk they

But still were strong to give;

Who died that men might live.

From a list of “Books Received ’’:—
“FORTY YEARS AT THE WAR. By
J. H. Balfour Browne, K.C.”
Glasgow Herald.
If the learned gentleman's participation
is going to prolong the War like this,
we trust he will return to his briefs.
From “Gossip of the Day”:—
“It has been a great year for the re-mar-
riage of widows, as witness the cases of Lord
Euston, the late Lord Mexborough, Lord
Savile, Lord Westmorland, Lord St. Davids,
Lord Muskerry, Lord Cottenham, Sir Charles
Wyndham, Canon Carnegie, and Dr. Percy
Dearmer. And now comes news of the engage-
ment of Col. McCalmont.”—Sunday Paper.
Here is yet another example of the
danger of gossip. There is good auth-
ority for stating that not one of the
gentlemen mentioned has ever been a
widow.
THE CORN FIELD.
OLD George is just the colour of the
good brown earth. There is a slouchy
bend in every bit of him, and he
looks at you with a mysterious smile
of feigned simplicity while he speaks
in a high thin voice and sharpens his
scythe for further efforts. He is cutting
our field of oats, which is high and
golden and fully ripe. About the end
of August we get fussy and anxious
about our harvest. It was only last
year that we started growing corn in
the unprofitable little field where only
a rank poor grass had grown before.
It is just an acre. A neighbouring
farmer came to plough and sow it. In
the late summer a party of convales-
cent soldiers, the keenest of them an
ex-poacher, came for an afternoon of
sport, with an attendant crowd of men
and boys with dogs and ferrets, and
helped to thin the predatory rabbits;
then, early in September, the harvest
of oats was reaped.
After the threshing we found we had
forty-five bushels of good oats with
which to face the winter and provide
for our ponies and fowls. Thus en-
couraged, in the following spring we
sowed again, and the second reaping
has now come round.
But this year the shortage of hands
is grievously felt, so old George is
single handed at the mowing, and there
is only the Belgian boy, Gust, to bind.
We lend a hand ourselves — three
mature ladies in eye-glasses, followed
by the cook and housemaid—and the
old man “larns” us how to make a
bind or “been " as he calls it ; also
how to stack the sheaves one against
the other, leaving space for the wind

attempts to mow a swathe, but George'
finds that he “canna larn.” us that—
the result is a gallant failure and a
tousled bunch of corn laid low. He
takes the scythe away with his usual
mystic smile, remarking, “There's a
good edge on en — 'tis a wonder ye
couldn't do better.”
He knows all there is to know of
the harvest field, and at the end of the
mowing he plaits a curious little device
in corn, called “the neck,” and presents
it to the house, receiving in acknow-
ledgment a shilling with which to
drink to our prosperity. It hangs in
the hall for a year, this neck of corn,
till replaced by that of the next harvest.
The second day old George comes
sloping down the back road, followed
at a respectful distance by what he
calls a “rambler"—not a cascade of
rosy flowers, however, but a rather
discoloured gentleman of the road, less
prettily designated a tramp by the
the partridges.
world in general, or “strag” in this
articular locality.
“Ah 'll bind,” says old George.
“Certainly,” we say, and they attack
the field together. A man of strength,
he does excellent work for a time.
When we next visit the field, however,
he has disappeared.
“Ah said ah must goo to town and
have a shave,” says old George drily,
continuing to mow. The rambler is
evidently a person of impulse.
Later in the day he returns.
“A pity to waste so much time in
doubtful weather,” remarks one of us
coldly. -
“I had business to attend to,” re-
plies he imperturbably and with an
improved appearance. He only works
the one day, and then rambles out of
our ken. Walking is evidently his
hobby.
“Did he really get to the town in
the time 2" we ask.
“Ah did,” says old George, “and ah
sin a man there, drinking a glass of
beer.” He smiles again inscrutably.
Our harvest is on teetotal principles,
and these pleasing visions are not to be
found here. But the corn is gathered
up into golden stacks, ready to be
carted away for the threshing, and our
harvesting is finished. Old George and
his smile vanish in the wake of the
thirsty rambler, and leave the field to
September, and the
birds fly up still untroubled, for the
shooters come not again this way.

Sir HERBERT TREE in his American Impressions in “The Times."]
My name from China to Peru is loud on ev'ry lip;
I've millions more admirers than HALL CAINE or
RUDDY KIP,
And yet amari aliquid with all my sweets Isip.
In private life I don't indulge in idiotic games,
I am a serious thoughtful man with high artistic aims,
And a strenuous disciple of the late Professor JAMEs.
I long to burst the fetters of my lucrative routine,
To quit the ceaseless folly of the moving picture scene
And blossom forth into a Judge, a Statesman or a Dean.
Unsympathetic critics harp upon my princely screw,
They little know how joyfully I'd see it cut in two
If a could write like MEREDITH or even EUGENE SUE.
I'd love to be a singer or a preacher, and to feel
That I influenced my hearers by a flesh-and-blood appeal,
Not by the speechless antics of a ghost upon a reel.
I long to solve the laws of mind, like Mr. OswalD STOLL'
I long to be a diplomat and draft a protocol; -
I long to write a symphony like BRAHMs's in C moll.
I'd love to play Othello or enact the noble Dane,
Or indite a new philippic in the Ciceronian vein,
Or ascend the Orinoco in a crystal hydroplane.
Anon I long to be a bard and sling prodigious rhymes,
Or contemplate a life enriched by most colossal crimes—
Such as forcibly abducting the Dictator of The T: ; # 8.
But then I am so sensitive, as TREE acutely saw,
I hold that even genius should be subject to the law;
I have no use for culture that is red in tooth and claw.
Men label me a jester, a mummer, a buffoon ;
They rank me in mentality no higher than a coon;
They lamentably fail to read my spirit's tragic rune.
Under the motley that I wear, the clothes that fit me ill,
Under that silly bowler hat, those features never still,
Napoleonic passions surge of which the world knows nil.
And yet I draw some comfort from the fact that

THE FOOD-STRATEGIST.
I DoN'T like Vegetarians. I have a
horror of Fruitarians. I loathe Nut-
arians. And I cherish a concentrated
splenetic hatred for combined Nutto-
Tutti - Frutti-Vegetarians that would
make the author of the Hymn of Hate
confess with shame that he had only
succeeded in being slightly petulant.
Squidgly is a hyphenated Vegetarian.
He rushes into battle (metaphorically
speaking) with a caulifloweremblazoned
on his oriflamme, and smites down
opposition with a vegetable-marrow.
Fluellen himself was not more valiant
in defence of the leek. But Squidgly
goes further. He defends not only
leeks but celery and cabbages, beetroot
and broccoli, and would be ready to die
in defence of a stick of rhubarb. A
cucumber is to him a microcosm of all
the virtues, comparable only for honesty
and square dealing with a Brazil nut.
I, for my part, am a carnivorous
animal. I ruin my constitution with
succulent steaks and have for many
years been committing slow but deter-
mined suicide with mutton-chops. I
eat meat for breakfast, for lunch, for
dinner and at any old time when the
craving seizes me.
My dislike of Squidgy and his fellow-
ruminants, who flaunt the green leaf of
a blameless vegetarian life, is due to
their persistent efforts to rescue me
from my slough of digestive iniquity.
Nevertheless I am now cultivating
Squidgly. Our relations at present are
those of benevolent neutrality, which
I hope will ripen in time to an entente.
I implore him by all he holds dear, by
the recollection of his kitchen garden,
by the remembrance of his early toma-
toes, to hold true to his principles. I
make hypocritical protestations that
my deep regard for the circumstances
of our family butcher alone prevents
me from following his example.
You see, if the Government adopt
the threatened plan of issuing meat-
tickets and my daily chop is reduced
to the dimensions of a sardine cutlet,
Squidgly might be induced to grant me
the reversion of his ticket, thereby
enabling me to pander to my vice un-
checked. One has to be a strategist
in war-time.

THE EVADERS OF CONSCRIPTION.
By Wolf'F BUREAU WIRELESS.
Berlin, September 16th.-Already
the English in countless myriads are
seeking means by which to evade
their Military Service Act. An in-
quiry has just been held at the fortified
city of Margate into the disappearance
of T. Smith, Greengrocer. This typical
sample of a nation of shopkeepers had
frequently expressed a desire to quit
the country. Three days ago he was
seen quitting—by way of the pier,
having announced his intention of
swimming the Channel. Was last re-
ported, in an exhausted state, in the
vicinity of one of our gallant Under-sea
boats. A Margate jury of fellow-shop-
keepers returned verdict: “Torpedoed
while of unsound wind.”
From the London Daily Looking-
Glass.-‘‘MoDERN SIMEON STYLITES :
An amazing discovery was made last
evening in Trafalgar Square, a middle-
aged man (said to be a piano-tuner)
being found on the pinnacle of Nelson's
Column. By some means, at present
unknown, he had conveyed himself
and a small store of food to the top
of the monument. Here, but for the
happy chance of a wide-awake American
pausing to glance up at England's
national hero, this representative of
English music would in all probability
have perished, for when rescued by the
fire brigade he was in a state of pitiable
emaciation due to continual attacks of
mountain sickness.”
Another London newspaper says:—
“Charged with masquerading as a
woman, Claude Duval Browne was
yesterday, at the Marlborough Police
Court, handed over to a military escort.
His capture was in great measure due
to the intelligence of P.C. Robinson,
who became suspicious on noticing that
prisoner wore yellow plaid trousers
beneath his skirt, spoke in a deep bass
voice, and was smoking a pipe of strong
shag.”
It is now definitely known that the re-
cruiting officenearthebastion of Tooting
Bec has been partially wrecked by a
mysterious explosion. It appears that
J. Jones (a Grouper), who was due to
report for service that day, had been
taking small doses of cordite with a
view to impairing his heart's action.
A Sergeant, it is alleged, spoke heatedly
to J. Jones, who at once vanished with
a terrific report. The Sergeant is ex-
pected to recover, but very little of
Jones is worth recovering.

NICHOLAs of RUSSIA, when challenged
by the police to produce his exemption
card, was stated of a prisoner at the
Street of Bow Station. The magis-
trate, in handing over prisoner to the
military doctor for examination, hinted
his grave doubts as to the sanity of a
man who willingly shouldered all the
burdens of such aliases.
Other instances of English panic
have reached our notice. In the Lon-
don Tubes lurk scores of cravens, who
travel ceaselessly between the Piccadilly
Broadway and the Shepherd's Bush
Circus, not daring to emerge into day-
light. In the Hall of Tussaud, Groupers
have even taken the places of wax-
works; but, since the introduction
of a system of pricking every figure
with a pin before the establishment is
closed at night, this custom has be-
come unpopular. Others are simulat-
ing madness, epilepsy, rabies, sleeping
sickness, and even death. It is doubtful
whether England's stupendous sacri-
fice of principle will bring a hundred
recruits to her colours.
“The Government propose the granting of
a national holiday of about four days during
the period extending from the end of September
until October 1st, to munition workers.”
Sheffield Daily Telegraph.
A tight squeeze, but we'll back the
Government to do it.
“What a marvel this man was for when
fast approaching a centenarian he might still
be seen in the saddle.”—Country Life.
But would it not have been more con-
siderate of him to dismount, for fear of
alarming the old gentleman?

We doubt if she really pronounced it

women themselves about it, and they
said, Yes, in case of invasion, they'd
be the third line of defence; and then
I asked them what they'd do, and
they said they didn't know. Some
of us look immensely snappy in our
khaki; I don't say Stella does, be-
cause (this is very, very much entre

we should never have known it but
for her devotion to her country) the
dear thing is knock-kneed 1
Still, she makes a simply splendid
General (she's had lessons from a
N.C.O. and has all the military terms
at the tip of her tongue), and to see
her on horseback, commanding, on
a field day or a parade day is really
thrilling. She hardly ever calls out
“Advance” when she means “Retire,”
or “Stand at ease” when she means
“Charge,” though of course such tiny
slips would be quite excusable.
The Yeowomen have got a machine
gun. They don't know yet how to
make it go off, and they're too proud
to ask any of the men, qui se moquent

severing with it. I've made one or

PROTECTING THE PUBLIC.
A PARAGRAPH in the Press states
that “in response to a request from
the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, the Manage-
ment of Ye Gods have withdrawn the
grotesque masks worn by the sand-
wichboardmen advertising this farce
at the Aldwych Theatre.” The above
is, however, only one instance of the fine
work being performed by various soci-
eties on the same lines, unobtrusively
and without adequate recognition.
Thus, recent innovations in the gags
employed by one of our best known revue
comedians having been brought to the
notice of the Society for the Preserva-
tion of Historic Landmarks, that body
at once protested to the Management
concerned, and was successful in getting
all the more venerable wheezes rever-
ently replaced.
It will be noticed that the new
revue at our leading West End variety
house will be marked by several novel
features, amongst them the disappear-
ance of the joy-way down the centre
of the stalls. This change has been
effected by the Management at the
urgent request of the Anthropological
Section of the Royal Society, which
has found that the strain of sitting for
two hours with the neck screwed at
an acute angle was having deleteri-
ous consequences among the younger
generations of British playgoers, the
chief sufferers being males of military
age.
A Speak-the-Truth Society is being
formed in London and the provinces
with the primary object of discourag-
ing inexactitude in Theatrical Press
agencies. Among other results it is
hoped to secure the entire abolition of
such preliminary boom-paragraphs as
can only be described as Whoppers.
“They [the German newspapers] clamour
for peace, and renounce any ambitions of
annexation. A veritable disease of truth-kill-
ing has broken out among them.”
Provincial Paper.

“Defendant [a motor-cyclist] said the road
was tarred and wet, and his machine skidded.
He put his hand accidentally upon the throstle,
in consequence of which he went upon the

Motorists ought not to take their birds
about with them. We saw a joy-rider
the other day with a whole clutch.
From a book review:—
“Although originally addressed to a Scottish
audience, the author in the selection and
arrangement of his subject-matter has been
guided by other considerations than the purely
utilitarian.”—Nature.
On behalf of our Scottish readers we
protest against the “although.”
“Experienced gentleman required . . . .
Write particulars of previous experience and
age.”—Daily Telegraph.
A cynical correspondent (female) ob-
serves upon this that “an experienced
lady gives her previous age as a matter
of course.”

“PotAsh AND PERLMUTTER IN SocIETY.”
This queer money trouble in three
Acts with a happy ending finds itself
outside criticism by its charming
maiveté. Mr. Montagu E G LAss, be-
sides creating, with the skilled assist-
ance of Mr. AUGUSTUs Yonke and
Mr. Robert LEONARD, the immortal
Abe and Mawruss, has got the smell
of dollars across the footlights more
completely than any other of his enter-
prising countrymen. And it is some
smell !
As to the general business back-
ground, I can imagine the nightmare
of a respectable Wood Street merchant
after a gastronomic indiscretion at
PIMM's might be something like it.
That is, if it were not for Abe and
Mawruss. That's not nightmare. That's
the human comedy—that's life, odd
but real. And not many authors could
string together so many sentences
which induce the loud guffaw that
speaks the well-contented mind. Which
is the abundant justification of Potash
and Perlmutter in Society, as of its
predecessor.
The two worthy costumiers have
prospered. Mawruss, newly married,
has a pretentious flat in Fifth Avenue.
Some financiers who are on the look-
out for pretentious flats find it. The
upshot is that Potash and Perlmutter
are “incorporated.” Abe breaks away
aghast at the dishonest watering of the
capital. Mawruss is engulfed, and it is
Abe who comes to the rescue, and the
broken partnership is renewed in a
fresh start in honest business on the
old lines. Queer how lovable these
two fellows are with all their prepos-
terous meanness and ridiculous pre-
occupation with money-getting.
I amused myself by trying to catch
Mr. YorkE and Mr. LEONARD off
their guard. Not on your life, not for
a single instant; not by a quiver of an
eyelid did they give themselves away
as the two robust gentlemen whose
photographs graced the foyer. A really
wonderful performance.
I don't suppose anyone who has
made acquaintance with Abe or Maw-
russ will hesitate to renew it. But to
the others I say: Go and laugh. The
kaleidoscopic crowd of secondary cha-
racters hasn't much chance. Pretty
Miss LAURA CowIE, who has some very
good things to her credit, didn't seem
quite the simple loyal little wife that
| Mr. GLAss meant her to be. But this
isn't quite her galley, is it? Miss MILLIE
HYLTON makes an excellent grotesque of
Mrs. Potash. Mr. GEOFFREY WILMER
gives a good smooth performance as a
well-mannered optimistic crook; and
Mr. PETER WISER's insurance agent was
a good study of canvass by barrage and
battery. The wicked business - man,
swindler and sensualist, of Mr. FRANK
PETLEY was effective. Many others
also ran—in and out of the general
medley. T.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THIs Mr. E. F. BENsoN is becoming a prodigy. The
rapidity with which he turns out books that (for all their
facility) never seem in the least slipshod entitles him to
rank among the marvels of literature. Speaking as a
reviewer, my complaint is especially concerned with that
easy dialogue of his, which, while seeming to be about
nothing at all (as is the talk of most people), is really so
artfully getting the story told that I am prevented from
skipping a word of it, and driven forward as with goads.
This is notably the case with Mike (CAssell), which, though
I don't call it quite Mr. BENSON's best, is certainly among
the most human romances that have been written about the
War. It is courageous, too; it must have taken some nerve
to create such very attractive Germans as Hermann and
Sylvia. I don't intend to spoil the tale for you by telling
it beforehand; but I will say that you will certainly not put
it down before the last page is turned. As usual with
Mr. BENsoN, the plot is I -
rather less important than
the characters, some of
whom are as good as
anything that he has done
— Lady Ashbridge, for
example, who at first
seemed only another of
those clever studies of
feminine futility of which
the author has already
such a gallery, but after-
wards developed into
something vastly different
(her later appearances in-
deed are almost intolerably
poignant); Michael him-
self, the shy egoist; his
pompous father and his
delightful aunt. All these
are admirably drawn; and
not less striking is the
treatment of another
minor character, none

would have to include me in the same charge. To speak
quite frankly, as a polemic the thing is conspicuously
ill-timed. There are some fairly well-drawn sketches of
modern London scenes, and some clever wit that I would
gladly have seen better employed. Otherwise the effect of
the whole is irritatingly artificial, and so feminist that it
reminds me of nothing more than a play at a ladies' sem-
inary, with all the characters, of both sexes, impersonated
by precocious and rather conceited young women.
Non-Combatants is, so Messrs. HopDER AND STOUGHToN
tell us, “a story of the War as it reacts on the people at
home,” and for my part I will say at once that it is a gloomily
didactic tale. Miss Rose MACAULAY has strong views about
war, and now that she has expressed them I hope she will
return to subjects more in harmony with her natural
talent. Under ordinary conditions I do not believe that
she would have created a family genteel to the point of
vulgarity for the joy of heaping ridicule upon them ; nor
introduced us to a heroine who in moments of strong
- - emotion was physically
sick. I forget how often
Alia: Sandomir suffered
from nausea, but more
%: than once I found my-
* self wondering whether
: attacks of nose-bleeding,
sneezing, or even hic-
coughs would not have
emphasized sufficiently
her internal emotions.
There is, however, a lot
of clever writing in this
“story of the War,” and,
in spite of the fact that
the present example of |
Miss MACAULAY's art pro-
vides abundant proof of
the pitfalls which lie in
wait for an ambitious
"|novelist, I still pin my
faith to her.

you were not prepared to find him in the cast. But at all
events you will now have to read the book if only to see
how so sensational an appearance is brought about.
Fictional variations upon the war-theme continue, as I
knew they would, to engage our novelists. But I own that
I was unprepared for anything quite like Dead Yesterday
(DUCKworTH), which, so far as I have been able to grasp
its meaning, appears to be a pacificist tract thinly disguised
as a story. Of course it is always possible that I may be
wronging Miss MARY AGNEs HAMILTON, and that the
eace-at-any-price views of her heroine are not to be
identified with her own; but in that case she should cer-
tainly have copied the newspaper editors and disclaimed
responsibility. Besides, not only the heroine but all the
“sympathetic characters” adopt the same attitude; and
for further evidence there is the recruiting meeting in
Chapter 22, at which the arguments of the speaker, one
Nigel, are indicated with superior scorn, and implied to be
at the mercy of the quiet man in a flannel collar who is not
allowed to question them. After this the plot is of secondary
importance. The matter of it is how the heroine heroically
breaks her engagement to this Nigel on the ground that
he is unable to “understand her.” I am afraid that she
Probably (MILLS AND Boon) is the attractive title that Mr.
I. A. R. WYLIE has given to a collection of short tales.
My only comment upon it shall be to suggest that you
should place your armchair within easy reach of a salt-
cellar, since the demands that the stories will make upon it
are likely to exceed an occasional pinch. Take for example
the first half-dozen, which concern a common hero, one
Sandy McGrab. This gentleman (I will not hide it from you)
was a native Scot. When not engaged in pursuits more pro-
per to the Highlands, he was reciting passages from SHAK-
SPEARE to the surrounding heather. These recitals having
been overheard by a real leading lady—oh these actresses!—
she encouraged him to such an extent that, on the night of
her London début as Juliet, the braw laddie knocked on the
head the mime who was cast for Romeo, and took his place
with triumphant success. This interesting sidelight on life
behind the scenes should be welcomed by those who, like
myself, imagined that not only the speeches but the related
movements of the players require some practice before the
rising of the curtain. After it I was incapable of surprise
when a dramatic critic, tempted for vile ends to write a bad
notice, replied hoarsely, “I can't! I should be perjuring my
own soul!” But after that I rose from my armchair
and turned for relief to the verisimilitudes of the BARON
voN MüNCHHAUSEN. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS.
XLVIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, You will, I
fancy, agree with me that War is
assuming a serious aspect when a
crowd of armour - plated monsters
(under the command, it is rumoured,
of General HEATH RobiNsoN) clamber
laboriously out of our trenches and
plod slowly but surely across to
theirs, apparently to serve some useful
purpose.
I see that they are officially de-
scribed in the communiqué as “heavy
armoured motor cars,” but this does
little justice to their buxom figures
and autumnal tints, and is not too
flattering to the modern automobile.
The Echo de Paris, hovering between
the words “battleship" and “cater-
pillar,” gets nearer to the mark. If
your imagination can conceive a cross
between these two species you will
have some idea of what happened to
the Bosch in the early morning of
September 16th, 1916.
I am told that, in one case, some of
the more optimistic mistook the appari-
tion, in the dim light of dawn, for a
lost field-kitchen, and ran up to it
with mess tins and an immediate
request for hot coffee; but I do not
believe that. I am at a loss to con-
ceive the real feelings of those who
were, so to speak, being approached in
the matter; they cannot have dared to
hope that this was a novel, if extra-
ordinarily cautious, method of desertion
to their side of the invisible English-
men within. There can have been no
doubt that they came on business; I
know them by sight and they have that
look. But what manner of business
was theirs and what reception should
be accorded them 2 These are ques-
tions which must have sorely puzzled
many a thoughtful Bosch that morning.
No good firing at them ; the bullets
would only bounce off and hit you in
the face. No good staying where you
were; the things would only run over
you. No good running away and climb-
ing up a tree; they would only follow
you. It was even no good running to a
house and crouching on the other side
of it; the unlovely but painstaking
monster, coming across a building,
merely leans up against the wall till it
collapses, and then proceeds. It can-
not be disputed that the whole idea
was distinctly unkind; very funny, no
doubt, but not quite nice.
When the matter was still in re-
hearsal I am told that the authorities
had some knotty problems to solve.
Should they be treated as motors and
given horns, or as engines and given
whistles 2 In the matter of drill disci-
pline, was it up to the driver to give
notice of his intention of turning a
corner by thrusting his arm out
through a loophole? Only one mis-
giving was felt. The crew, carried
away by excitement, might go too far
and find themselves stranded with all
ammunition and motive power spent.
Besieged and forced by hunger and
lapse of time to surrender, they might
have to open the window and come out.
“Mark my words,” a Disembarcation
Officer is reported to have said as he
piloted a platoon of these animals down
the gangway, “one of these days we
shall find one of them back here
again ; not till we have gone up to it
to stroke it and offer it a lump of sugar
shall we find that its insides have be-
come German and it has turned against
us.” This may concern YoU, Charles.
The animals look so dreadfully com-
petent, I am quite sure they can swim.
Thus, any day now, as you go to your
business in the City, you may meet
one of them trundling up Ludgate Hill,
looking like nothing on earth and not
behaving like a gentleman. I suppose
you have by this time heard the first
report we received of the progress of
any member of the party, on that
hilarious morning: “Have just seen
‘The Hedgehog' walking up High
Street, Flers, followed by crowd of
cheering Tommies.”
Earlier operations round Ginchy, I
believe, produced a smaller but not
insignificant incident. It concerned a
special system of sending reports from
the battle. This may or may not be a
regular practice; I don't know. In
any case it was to be something very
rapid, very effective and very, very
special. Great preparations were made
and everything was provided for except
the comfort of the man who had to
carry the apparatus into the battle.
Any man in the Army who goes for
a walk starts off with some hundred-
weights of luggage attached to him.
Up to the moment the powers that be
haven't taken to hanging odd knick-
knacks to one's ears, but otherwise
there is no space to let. If in addition
to the packs and pouches, arms, side-
arms, water-bottles, haversacks, gas
helmets, emergency rations, ammuni-
tion and spare parts of everyday life a
man has also to carry the apparatus of
a special idea with him, be sets forth
with little spring in his step, and after
he has got some miles his enthusiasm
for the special idea does not increase.
I have no doubt that the man in this
case besides his own luggage had also
some pounds of patent stationery for
writing his messages on, and many
other contraptions in some way con-
nected with his business. However
that may be, he was started off all
right, in good time for the battle.
By the time the message was expected
a distinguished crowd had become
interested in the affair and had fore-
gathered at the receiving-station to
witness the working of the special idea.
I am informed there was a General
among the waiting assembly, and that
there was plenty of waiting to be done.
It was bad enough when much time
elapsed and no news of the battle ar-
rived; it was worse when more time
elapsed and news of the battle did
arrive, but by other channels. Feel-
ings were suppressed but intense; there
was, in fact, some impatience. Great
things were expected of the apparatus;
there must be some very important
event it had been waiting all this time
to bring the news of. I don't know
how many of the distinguished crowd
at this moment gave a thought to the
man who'd set out in the early morn-
ing with the apparatus. I can only pic-
ture them all there, gathering round the
General as the message was handed to
him, listening in an expectant hush as
he opened it and read: “I think I've
carried this damned apparatus long
enough now.” -
Lastly, let me tell you of the name-
less battalion which, about this period
of operations, had managed to capture
five German prisoners, and with great
zest and pride wired the great news to
the Division, and intimated that the
five were being sent forthwith to the
Divisional cage. The officer who was
detailed to meet and deal with them
was a little disappointed to find that
on their arrival there were only four.
The escort most indignantly denied
the accusation of having lost one on
the way, and very strongly deprecated
the other suggestion. Where then,
said the officer, was the fifth 2 Reluc-
tantly the truth was made known. It
appeared that, after the wire had been
sent, but before the prisoners had been
started on their way, the captors had
met another nameless battalion, and
had been so melted by the latter's
piteous tale of two months' toil and
troubke, but never a single prisoner
taken, that a bargain had been com-
pleted. The second battalion had in
fact become owners of the prisoner, the
missing fifth, by right of purchase.
And at what price? Five hundred
nd-bags.

F. Yes; isn't he the most kindly of Kaisers?
T. And the most considerate.
F'. And the most tactful.
T. Upon my word, it's a privilege merely to serve such
a, ] r] all.
F. Merely to look at him is enough for me, and even of
that I sometimes think I've had too much lately.
T. Has he been interfering in his usual way?
F. Interfering, indeed! Why, he never left me alone.
No sooner was any movement decided than he must come
and put his fist in the pie and stir it all up again. If it
went well, of course he took all the credit.
T. Ah, that is the way with all these imperial big-wigs.
F. But if things go badly, then I have not noticed that
he is very eager to take any share of the blame.
T. Of course not. To offer any blame to so skilful and
foreseeing an All-Highest would be lèse-majesté of the
worst description.
I'. In the end I got tired of it and broke out. “Your
Majesty,” I said, “has forgotten to take a few facts into
account. First, that the French and the English can also
fight, and are not yet by any means all killed ; secondly,
that the Russians do not consider that they are all dead;
and thirdly, that, if we are to win, we must have more
men and, above all, more guns and ammunition, and of a
better quality. I am not useful for making bricks without
straw.”
T. That was very bold of you. What did he say?
F. He didn't say much—just turned on his heel and
snorted—you know that way he has. And two days after-
wards I got that letter that seems to amuse you so much.
T. Well, well, I don't congratulate HINDENBURG.
I'. Nor I; his job is not like walking in a rose-garden.
Things really are not going well. There is no use in
disguising the situation.
T. Not the least. I own I never thought it would come
even to this.
F. Ah, you hadn't reckoned on the All-Highest's capacity
for mischief. Besides, there is that little jackanapes of a
CRow N PRINCE with his crown of oak-leaves. He can
spoil most things.
T. Too true.
I've been expect-

GRIEVANCES.
DENTIST8. -
NExt to golf there is perhaps no
pleasure greater, between men, than
pointing out what is wrong—wrong
not only in the Government, which of
can enjoy his oysters this year, and at
course is perpetually vulnerable, but in
social life too.
Oysters, for example. Here we are in
the first month of a new oyster season
—and to many right-minded men life
is a blank between April 30 and Sept-
ember 1–and the papers tell us, with
dismal iteration, that there never was
such a good crop, and oysters are among
the few things which the War has not
made dearer, and even the poor man
Billingsgate they are so cheap that
twenty a shilling can be obtained retail
and every one with a pearl in it, and a
lot more besides; but none the less the
West-End restaurants are still asking
three-and-six a dozen, as though nothing
had occurred to bring the price down.
Surely that's a subject for discus-
sion Threepence-halfpenny each for
oysters just because there is a selfish
—or shall I say?—yes, I will chance
it—a shell-fish—ring which is deter-
mined that the public, at any rate the
richer public, shall not participate in
cheap rates' It is of course a scandal,
and I should like to hear that new
Cato, Mr. Justice Low, who has such
a sliort, sharp way with dishonest
Army contractors, on the matter.
No wonder that that little band of
true patriots, censors and friends of
man and equity (of whom I am one)
which assembles in the corner of a
smoking-room of one of the few clubs
that have not yet been commandeered by
the War Office or Munitions Office, had
something to say about it. But of our
remarks on the delicious bivalve, as the
stylists call it, and inflated prices, I
shall say nothing here. It is of our
decisions with regard to another un-
satisfactory affair that I wish to call
attention. -
Somebody—I think it was Masters—
began it by informing us that he had a
story of medical turpitude to unfold to
yº. But he had no chance, for old
Colonel Blythe was all over him in an
instant. -
“Don’t say anything against doctors,”
he said. “I won't listen to it. Doctors
are all right. They do their best. It's
dentists that want reforming.”
A murmur of support indicated how
widespread was this feeling.
“Yes, Sir,” the Colonel went on,
“there may be a doctor here and there
who is deficient. But take them as a
whole they're wonderful. They're
fine fellows. They work. They con-
sider their patients. If you're ill your
doctor comes to you; he doesn't com-
mand you to go to him. If you need
half a day's attention he gives it to
you. If you're bad in the night you
can send for him and he'll get up.
You know the address and his home
telephone number; and he'll come the
next day too, and every day, and some-
times twice a day—till you're well, or
dead. But what does a dentist do?”
The Colonel glared at us as furiously
as though we too were dentists.
“What does a dentist do 2 " he re-
peated. “I’ll tell you. The dentist
does as little as he can. To begin
with, he doesn't come to us at all, but
sends for us: chucks us half-an-hour
here, on Monday, say, at 11.30, and then
half-an-hour on Friday at 4.15, just
as if he were an employer of labour
and we were starving applicants. And
when we get there he is never ready,
and then when we reach his room he
is in a hurry because he is late, and
most of the time he is leaving us to go
to the telephone; and if, when we go
away and have pain, we want to get
at him again, we can't, because he
never lives at his business address. A

doctor does, but a dentist never does.
Dentists practise in Welbeck Street and
live at Great Missenden. Yes, Sir,
Great Missenden ; that 's what dentists
do. I tell you they're clever fellows,
and we're their dupes. You can't ring
spoiled a dentist's rest yet. And as
for Saturdays and Sundays, they never
show up at all either day. -
“And that's not all,” the Colonel
continued. “They're always too busy.
However busy a doctor is he can always
come to-day. A dentist can't find a
minute till Thursday, and then you
must be squeezed in between other
patients.
“And then their bills. Anyone else
tells you what you are paying for.
A dentist says ‘Attendance -- thirty
guineas.' On consulting the dictionary
I find that “attendance ' means ‘wait-
ing on.' Now who does the waiting
at the dentist's—you or he ” Why,
you do, of course. It's all waiting, and
under dashed uncomfortable conditions
too, with back numbers of The Graphic,
and a lot of frowsy people who it is
ten to one are to be called before you
are. Attendance, indeed ' Why, we
ought to be paid for our lost time.
“But it will all have to be changed.
There's a fortune for the dentist who
does not take on more than he can
properly accomplish, who keeps his
appointments, who realises that teeth
don't adhere to office hours and ache
only between 10 and 5, and who, living
in London, is accessible at odd times.
Dentists have been bullying us too
long. They've got to come into line.”

THE FUTURE OF BELGIUM. .
I'M feeling quite cheerful about the future of Belgium.
This is how it came about.
The lunch at my Belgian Refugee hostel was over.
The babies and very small children were sitting round
the tables while their mothers cleared away. At one table
in the far corner of the room, Georges, aged two and a
half, was sitting opposite to Elizabeth, aged one and a
half, who was born here, and rather takes a pride in being
thought English. Georges always has been a trial to us
ever since he came.
If it wasn't one thing it was another,
and his latest habit of handing me his half-finished saucer
of potato and gravy upside down at lunch is distracting
in the extreme. Also he frequently struggles out of his
chair and crawls across the table if, he sees a pudding
he likes better than his on the other side.
At this particular moment his mother was out of the
room, and I, knowing his past, kept my eye upon him.
He gazed at Elizabeth approvingly. -
Then, with an ease acquired by, long practice, he got out
of his chair and walked across the table and knelt down
in front of her. . . . . .
He patted her head hard on, the top. Elizabeth looked
far from pleased, so I thought it was time to interfere.
I walked across the room and said, “Georges!” in a
reproving voice. - -
He looked up at me, and then, with an engaging smile,
he flung his arms round Elizabeth and said, “"Lis'beth
pour moi.”
“It was rough-and-tumble comedy, but quite the best of its sort.
Certainly Mr. Glenville can sweedle smiles from you in a way all
his own.”—Daily Paper.
And, no doubt, in tragedy he could tweedle tears.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
HoMEs of outworn and fossilized traditions,
Tending to cramp and sterilize our sons,
Checking the growth of generous ambitions—
So the impeachment confidently runs.
Thus do we see the glib suburban Rousseau
Tilt at the system, ridicule its rules,
And, by adroitly mingling false and true, sow
Envious distrust of British Public Schools.
Let the Roll answer, not alone in losses,
Not in the lists that daily make us mourn,
Rather in deeds beyond the meed of Crosses,
Signs of a race regenerate, reborn.
Cherished at home and delicately bred up,
These were the first to lend their country aid,
Only impatient, saying they were “fed up,”
When to the Front their journey was delayed.
Spite of the anti-Classicists' arraigning,
Spite of the ink so petulantly spilt,
Not by exact laboratory training,
Not by the test-tube character is built.
Only in fields of emulous endeavour,
Fired by the teaching of the famous dead,
Public-school boys, who play the game for ever,
Grow into leaders and inspire the led.
“All the civil and religious liberties we enjoy to - day spring
from the seed sown by our forefathers, and in their defence we went
voluntarily into the Great War, so that those liberties, and the spirit
of live and let live, may be handed down unimpaired to our ancestors.”
Bournemouth Visitors' Directory.

SCENES FROM AN OUT FORT.
INCLUDING THE HUMoURS OF
TERENCE O' LEARY.
IV.
THE STRATAGEM.
“Bombardier O'Leary,” thundered
Major Tusher, “the Brigade office re-
ports that your wife is coming off to
identify you this afternoon in the
ration boat. Why did you not report
yourself as a married man when you
joined 2"
“Because I was niver a liar, Sorr,
and what is wrong wid the Brigade
office this morning that they'd be
fixin' wives on men as niver had them
in their lives before, Sorr 2 ''
“But there can be no mistake about
this wife, O'Leary,” said the C.O.
angrily. “She claims to be the wedded
wife of Terence O'Leary of H
Ballycudder, and she has
been round the whole gar-
rison trying to identify her
husband till the General
is distracted.”
“He must be disthracted
at the sight of her,” said
O'Leary, handling the tea-
spoons nervously. “Least-
ways if she's resolved to
find a husband onyway— |
the General bein’ a single
man himself, Sorr. She's

lowance—the way they
call it that, though divil a

band of red flannel round his head and
pinned it with a huge cairngorm brooch,
ſhe property of Patrick Molloy. The
mess secretary devoted the better part
of an hour to searching through Army
Regulations as to the procedure in the
case of a disfigured mess waiter, but,
since such a contingency was unpro-
vided for by military law, the officers
submitted to their degralation in si-
lence.
There was the flutter of a skirt in the
ration boat when it reached Fort
Mornington, and every available man
was on the parapet, ready to witness
the confounding of Terence O'Leary,
since ill news flies apace.
“'Tis a female,” said Patrick Molloy
in an awed tone. “Sure she has a way
| wid her, Terence, and a fut on her
besides 1’’ -
“Is this woman your wife?” he said
irritably as Terence came in.
But without waiting for an answer
Mrs. O'Leary flounced to her feet indig-
nantly. “And what good would a man
like that be to me, your honour? There
isn't a child he wouldn't fright the life
out of wid a face on him like that. Let
me go, Colonel dear, for there's two
other forts I have to visit yet, and two
more O'Learys in them, and when I
find the right one I'll take the skin
from his back; but sure it's worse I'd
be wid that creature there than wid-
out him.”
“That's a terrible woman, O'Leary,”
said Major Tusher, wiping his forehead
as the ration boat withdrew back to the
mainland.
“She is that, Sorr,” said O'Leary
thoughtfully, “and the tongue av her
- when she would set and
talk by the hour was like
the sea for clatter.”
Major Tusher looked
sharply at him, but the
expression of his left eye
was as innocent as that
of a little child, and the
C.O. turned away.
In the quiet of his
room that night, O'Leary
removed the sodden re- ||
mains of a potato from
his cheek and unbuckled
the cairngorm brooch.
“It was a sthratagem,”
he said in answer to a con-
cise question on the part of
his friend. “There's many
me that has never been
nigh to Ballycudder these r
seven year !”
“I can't help that,”
Tusher, waving away an inquisitive
wasp. “You should have thought
things over before you deserted her,
O'Leary.”
“It'll be the bad day for me when
the woman comes here, Sorr,” said
O'Leary gloomily, “and me wid the
face-ache terrible bad this morning,
Sorr; it's growin' on me; me gum is
the size of a pullet's egg and you'd
feel it leppin' when you’d put your
hand upon it, as it might be a frog
under a glass.”
“Then go and get something to put
on it, for I particularly dislike being
waited on by a man in pain,” said
Major Tusher impatiently.
By lunch-time the face of Terence
O'Leary had swollen to the size and
shape of a small football. His right
eye, being bunged up, lent him the air
of a dissipated Silenus, and his voice,
harsh as the whistle of the approaching
ration boat, increased the strange hor-
rol of his personality. He had tied a

“I'd be ashamed of my life to be
seen wid her, then,” said O'Leary hotly.
“Why, she's old enough for me grand-
mother ' "
“Truth and she is that,” said Molloy,
as a staid elderly woman set a square
determined foot upon the steps of the
Fort and looked up with an unflinch-
ing eye at the line of men on the
parapet. -
“She knows you, Terence,” said his
friend.
“Then it's mad she is,” said O'Leary,
adjusting the flannel, “for me own
mother would not recognise me at this
minute, and that's the thruth if it's my
last word.” -
When Terence O'Leary entered the
Major's office Mrs. O'Leary was still
talking. She had already given the
confidential history of her birth and
vaccination, her marriage with her de-
faulting husband, his personal appear-
ance and the position of two identifying
moles upon his body; and Major
Tusher was stunned by her volubility.

“There are them as might call that
a lie,” said Molloy thoughtfully.
“Sthratagems and lies is first

said Terence O'Leary as he flung the
potato far out to sea.

“I’M told there's 'appenings at the

began the landlord invitingly, with a
glance at Corporal McGlusky, home on
short leave.
“Not 'alf there ain't,” agreed
McGlusky. “Got mixed up with an

“In a manner o’ speaking. The old

let us down something cruel. And we

Irishman named O'Hara, with a tem-

suis going to get un morceau of my

“Grannie 'erself stood a little way
off, watching 'im. But when the
Lieutenant comes towards 'er she gives
a squeak of terror and bolts. In a jiffy
O'Hara was after 'er. She was fat
and old, but a fair miracle for speed
and quicker at dodging corners than
'e was. Presently, when they'd been
round the barn a dozen times, the
Lieutenant slips on a stone and goes
'eadlong, and Grannie disappears
through the open door of the scullery.
We all thought that was the end of it,
but it wasn't. O'Hara, fair beside
'isself, scrambles up and begins un-
buckling 'is revolver-case.
“‘For 'Eaven's sake go slow, Sir!'
says the Company-Sergeant. But 'e
might as well 'ave spoke to the fence

“We saw the Lieutenant dash into

The Company-Sergeant was the first
to pull 'isself together.

[SEPTEMBER 27, 1916.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE HAWK.”
I should not myself have said that,
as a bird of prey, the eagle's methods
are so much superior to those of the
hawk. But George de Dasetta (of the
Hungarian nobility) thought they were.
As the eagle to the hawk, so, in his
opinion, were the manners of his an-
cestors, who preyed on their neighbours
from their castles on the mountain-tops,
compared with his own, who did his
preying at the poker-table. But I
was altogether with him in his frank
recognition of his state of decadence.
Indeed it was a depraved life that he
and his female lived in light-taloned
collusion. Let me briefly unfold
the sorry facts.
It all began on the day when
he discovered his wife (Slavonic
temperament with a touch of
Tartar) improving her hand by
the adoption of a discarded ace.
Till then an innocent gambler, he [
at once perceived his chance of
utilising her gift for their mutual
benefit. Even so his motives were
fairly sound, for he only wanted
money in order to buy jewellery
for his adored partner, with a view
to retaining her affections. Then
there came into her life an English
lover, Richard Phillimore — “so
different from the others”—who
inspired her with a yearning for
spiritual betterment (though you
might not have guessed this from
the cut of her evening gown), and
cheating became so distasteful to
her that she only continued it at
her husband's urgent desire. Un-
him from the error of his ways,
she was detected in the act of
passing him a fourth king. . . .
Her lover, who had seen her doing it,
denounces her for a thief, but condones
her offence so far as to propose elope-
ment with her. Dasetta himself, a little
embarrassed by the fear of exposure,
but much more concerned about his
wife's fidelity, makes to throttle the
lover, but eventually hands her over to
him in disgust and goes forth into the
lonely wilderness of Continental casinos.
But gambling has lost its charm now
that its motive has been lost; and he
takes to morphia. After six months
of unconsecrated union the lovers, in
train for a divorce, track him down in
London, a hopeless wreck. Moved by
pity for his deplorable state and the
passionate devotion to which he attri-
butes it, she sacrifices Phillimore and
consolation elsewhere. “Elsewhere," we were singularly lacking in racial simi-
assume, will be in the arms of a certain larity. Except for a solitary explosion

and seldom free from the strain upon
one's powers of credence. It was un-
believable that Phillimore, whose influ-
ence upon the Countess de Dasetta was
represented as tending to her moral
improvement, should have selected the
very moment of her conviction as a
cheat to urge upon her the merits of
elopement. It was unbelievable that
the hard-headed Canadian, Drayton,
who, though he was free enough with
his money and by way of good fellow-
ship would write you a cheque for
six thousand pounds as soon as look at
you, knew better than to mix up phil-
anthropy with a business proposition,
should have offered the control of a
big financial undertaking to a gibbering
victim of drugs. Yet I would have
swallowed all this like milk if I had
cared about anybody in the play; but
I didn't care.
For a pair of Hungarians the Dasettas
sphere. The picture of a country-
house in the second Act was per-
functory and cramped; there was
barely room in it for the excep-
tionally bad manners of the very
stout Canadian. The humorous
relief was of the thinnest, and even
Mr. ERIC LEWIs found almost as
much solemnity as fun in his part
of a lonely old bachelor.
I took a note of one remark
that seemed worth remembering
in connection with card games.
Somebody, comparing the sexes
in respect of their power of de-
tached concentration, says, “A
woman never forgets the man she
loves.” This throws light upon
what I have often failed to un-
derstand at the time, namely the
play of various ladies with whom
I have had the misfortune to be
partnered at bridge. I know
now. Their minds were wander-
ing. They were thinking of the
“THE LIGHT BLUES.”
I remember once telling the late
Captain MARSHALL how clever it was
of him, knowing the Army upside down
as he did, not to put real soldiers
on the stage, but types out of the illus-
trated magazines. Though he had the
courage of his own humour, Captain
MARSHALL did not take my remark for
a compliment. But I am sure that
Messrs. MARK AMBIENT and JACK HUL-
BERT, the authors of The Light Blues
and both Cambridge men, will not mind
my saying that they know their busi-
ness far too well to think of reproducing
the actual thing, when the audience is
looking for something quite different.
They don't, of course, put their rowing
men into football gear; for, though 1
think I never met Mr. AMBIENT on the
river, I understand that his collaborator
rowed in the Caius boat; but even here

from the Spartan flannel of my time,

is a concession to the ideals of the
gallery. For the rest there is very
little that is light blue in the play,
except the trimming of the “ St.
Stephen's "blazer. - -
I should not have worried if there
had just been one scene at Cambridge,
sandwiched in between episodes at
Trouville and Baghdad; but, with the
whole play in a Cambridge setting (and
my own college bridge on the cover of
the programme), I confess that I wish
the authors could have allowed one or
two details—in addition to the bed-
maker (Miss MANsfield) and the row-
ing shorts, both very lifelike—to bear
some faint resemblance to the facts. .
Curiously enough I didn't so much
mind the more preposterous features—
the renting, for instance, of a cottage
on the Cam by a ducal undergraduate;
or the antics of Gundy, the college gyp,
who mistook himself throughout, and
very funnily, for a drunken Irish waiter;
but when he announced to a party in
a man's rooms, “Coffee is served in the
study ?" I admit that I nearly swooned.
Still, in the words of one of the char-
acters, “You mustn't be surprised at
anything in May Week." Que voolez-voo,
as Private Horrocks learnt to say in the
Punch story—que woolez-voo £ c'est la
guerre / - - - -
Talking of the War, I found internal
evidence, connected with certain mous-
taches in the WILLIAM II. manner; that
the time of the play is the present
War-time. This perhaps excuses the
fabulous picture of May Week, since,
of course, there isn't any such thing
at all, with the river deserted, these
fighting days. - -
I was sorry for that most admirable
actor, Mr. ALBERT CHEvaLIER, that he
should have had to play the part of a
senile roysterer, and I think the authors
must have been sorry for him too, for
they gave him, by way of solace, some-
thing to sing in his own particular
vein—a song of sentiment about Rose.
coloured Glasses, altogether alien from
the vulgarian character he was playing.
Mr. SHAUN GLENVILLE, who seems cap-
able of almost anything, might have
made an excellent gyp, if they had let
him forgo his remarkable gift for rotund
buffoonery and knockabout business.
Mr. HULBERT as an undergraduate was
quite near to being probable, and I
very much liked his manner of pro-
posing to Cynthia Petrie (Miss CICELY
Court.NEIDGE, who also showed a nice
sense of humour); this was the best
thing of the play.
I liked, too, Mr. STANLEY LoGAN as
the Duke of Dorchester, whose air of
polite boredom recalled Mr. CHARLEs
HAwTREY. The rest were sufficiently
exuberant.
Altogether, with the assistance of
yet a third Cantab, Mr. ADRIAN Ross,
who supplied some pleasant trifles for
the lyre, the play went with that
boisterous and resolute gaiety which
musical comedy demands. There was
good fun in it, though there might
have been more. And after all, even
if it was a travesty of Cambridge life, it
was the creation of her own faithful
alumni. No one can say “An Oxford
man hath done this thing.” O. S.
VIVA VOCE.
“GREEDY!” said my sister, as a slip
of the carving-knife shot the chicken
bodily on to my plate.
I handed over the knife.
“Here you are, then. I told you
what would happen. And if ever 1
marry she will have to carve.”
“Poor Paragon ' " sighed Mary.
“That's the seventh Deadly Virtue
she's to have.”
“You’re not keeping a list 2"
She ran to her desk and produced a
paper.
“Specification,” she read out, “ of
Jimmy's future bride (if any).
1. She must be beautiful.
2. Must have nice hair.
3. Must dress well. .
4. Also very cheaply.
5. Must read and appreciate Jim-
my's articles.
6. Must be able to carve.
7. Must have had her tonsils cut . . .”
“I never . . . ,” I began hotly.
“You did. When Charles got the
bill for his wife's operation you said
you'd be . . . ' -
“I remember. Go on.”
“That's all.” -
“Thanks. Nice girl, my wife' "
Two years later, when I broke the
news of my engagement to Mary, she
fished out the specification again.
“Does she conform 2 " she asked.
“I've no idea. But she's ripping.”
“Well, I've never seen your Phyllis,
but I expect she's all she shouldn't be.
I'm asking her to tea, and I'll find
out all about her for myself—tact-
fully, of course.”
At teatime I found Mary arranging
seven lumps of sugar in a row before her,
while Mick, the family hound, watched
her with pleased and astonished antici-
pation. His usual allowance was two
lumps.
“What's this orgy for 2 " I asked.
“It's for your benefit. Each lump
stands for one of the Deadly Virtues,
counting from this end. When I con-
sider the young person to have passed
in any of the seven, Mick gets the cor-
responding lump. And if after tea one
single lump remains . . . "
“Yes?” I said breathlessly.
“You'll have to give her a month's
notice and try again.”
Then Phyllis arrived.
“What a jolly dog!” she said after
preliminaries.
“Yes, isn't he? But terribly weak
about sugar—aren't you, Mickie”"
And with a side glance at me Mary
gave him the first three lumps. Out-
wardly, at any rate, my choice was
approved.
“Excuse my being personal,” went
on my sister, “but your frock turns me ||
bright green with envy. Where did
you get it?”
“I made it.” -
“You didn't ' Heavens ! I wish I
could. My allowance simply melts.”
I watched Mick masticating the
fourth lump. Henceforth, he seemed
to say, the world could hold no further
surprises for him.
“Just as well you can make your
own things,” went on Mary, “because
you can hardly expect much income
out of the appalling rubbish Jimmy
writes.”
“Poor old Jimmy!" said Phyllis.
“It's not so bad as all that. He 's
quite funny sometimes, you know.”
“Thank you,” I said meekly.
Mary looked doubtfully at lump
number five. “I’m not quite sure
whether you ought to have this bit,
Mick. However—catch ' " He did.
“Aren't you spoiling that dog?" re-
marked Phyllis.
“I can't help it; he's as fond of
food as a man. Which reminds me—
can you carve?” -
“No. Why?"
“One of you will have to, and
Jimmy's carving is simply awful.”
“I’ll take lessons,” she promised.
I leant quickly forward, and Mick
got his sixth. -
There remained only the last lump,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THROUGHOUT the ages, poets have chronicled the great
deeds of heroes. It is good therefore to find one of ours
to-day, Mr. John MASEFIELD, upon the same noble task.
| Not that I would have you suppose his little book, Gallipoli
(HEINEMANN), to be a poem in the narrower sense of the
word. It is a prose record of facts, illustrated for our
better understanding with many photographs and maps—
a work in which there is no room for embellishment or
make-believe ; but still a poem, partly because it is written
by one who has a poet's feeling for beautiful and significant
words, more because of the spirit of the deeds that it
records. No paragraph of mine could do anything like
justice to the effect of this small volume, its nobility and
restraint, and above all the story of magnificent un-
rewarded heroism that it reveals. I can only say that
for my own part there were times when, as I read, the
sweat of pity and grief stood upon my face. It is perhaps
knowledge of the end that makes this tale of superhuman
obstacles overcome, and stark courage fighting its way to
within sight of victory, a thing almost not to be borne.
Yet, as Mr. MASEFIELD shows, in some passages of
temperate criticism, that end was not altogether defeat.
The hero-band of Gallipoli accomplished, in containing
vast forces of the enemy, some part at least of the im-
possible task set before it. Of the quality of that achieve-
ment no better witness could be found than a passage in
a letter taken from the body of a dead Turk officer. “These
British are the finest fighters in the world,” he wrote.
“We have chosen the wrong friends.” Till the hour comes
for apportioning praise and blame, we may with reverence
and pride leave the matter at that. In the meanwhile
Mr. MASEFIELD has deserved all our thanks for a record so
moving and so finely touched.
I am wondering if, without Mr. E. TEMPLE THURSTON's
own confession in dedicating The Five - Barred Gate
(Hodder AND STOUGHTON) to GERALD and MURIEL
DU MAURIER, I should have guessed that it was really a
play turned into a story. Knowing it, one's impulse is of
course to re-transpose the affair mentally into its original
Acts. It must have been a play with a very short cast.
Beyond the hero and heroine, Jim and Beatrice, a brace of
friends for them to flirt with, and three servants whose
philanderings reproduce the matrimonial tangle above-stairs
in slightly broader comedy, there is not, I think, another
character so much as mentioned. One sees, of course,
Mr. DU MAURIER as Jin–indeed that much is given away
in the dedication. And I am pretty sure about the love-
scene in the garden, where he kisses the pretty visitor and
is pulled up short by a violent attack of jealousy concerning
her brother and his own wife. I can see the delightful
grimace with which he would show us that, towards (I
suppose) the end of the second Act. The third would
obviously be the reconciliation. In short a pleasant little
comedy and, played as it would be at Wyndham's Theatre,
no doubt a very agreeable entertainment, even if you did
reflect afterwards that it had been much ado about nothing.
The trouble is that in its present form the story provokes
this reflection so often that not all Mr. THURSTON's

danger of a premature collapse.
Let me commend to you very highly a shocker by
EDGAR WALLACE, The Tomb of Ts’in (WARD, Lock).
Nothing so good of its kind has come my way for months.
It is the tale of the quest for a priceless treasure hid in the
tomb of a dead emperor, with murder by fire and cord and
knife and pistol; sleuthery and counter-sleuthery; and a
jolly hurried sketchy little love-story intertwined. The
thing goes at a hurricane pace all through, without paren-
thesis or tedious preparation. You can't safely miss a
word, and won't want to. Ingenuity of contrivance is
here allied with a keen sense of situation, and the author
takes pains to produce an atmosphere that shall make his
manifold impossibilities plausible. A sound piece of work.

ation with a manner of originality. We have had plenty of
stories about husband and wife whom the law has made
two. Nor is there anything strikingly novel about the
introduction of the Roman Catholic dogma on the subject
piness to an unhappily mated heroine. But it does, I think,
strike a new note in after-the-divorce tales that the heroine
should have married somebody else, who irritates her, and
have given him three detestable children, before a providen-
tial recalling of her religious convictions enables her to elope
cheerfully with husband number one. Somehow Peggy's
adaptably conscientious attitude towards marriage reminds
me of HENRY THE EIGHTH. But of course her second
husband, Mr. Barber, whom she had wedded more to please
her invalid mother than for his own charms, did turn out
most disagreeable. The writer describes his car as having
a hooter “like the choking gurgle of a sick rhinoceros.”
So now you know the type that Mr. Barber belonged
- to. As for the title of the
tale, that really has not
much relevance, except that

worthy of a writer with far less than Richard DEHAN's objectionable but human
acknowledged gifts. It is all about the smartest, and
most unreal set of people imaginable, who are rich as
rich, and use the longest words in the dictionary by way of
demonstrating their exalted station. Contrasted with them
(in everything save impossibility) is the suitor who, being
passing poor on £700 a year, takes the whole length of the
book to persuade the heroine to share his humble crust,
though, to do her justice, he had by the finish pulled his
income up to £1,400. Sometimes the dialogue is little better
than mere farce, and throughout it is of a quality not often
found in human speech. I could quote, but it would be
unkind. It comes to this, that Gilded Vanity is a novel
that might well have been content with its amazing good
luck in getting published once. To repeat the process
savours of provocation.

course it all “comes right in the end "; and through
mutual misunderstandings and dangerous moments the
couple reach a prospect of comparative security. The
author, I am glad to say, avoided the obvious solution,
of which at one time I began to entertain a little dread.
It would have been unworthy of a very brightly told and
engaging study of the matrimonial problem. I don't think
I should suggest it as honeymoon reading for your friends;
but at an earlier stage you might manage tactfully to bring
it to the notice of whichever party stands in greater need

May not approve your present fate,
Or clearly recognise the fun
Of being given a place too near the sun;

That not in vain the seed was sown, -
That half the recent havoc we have wrought
Was based on methods all your own;
And smile to hear our heavy batteries
Pound you with imitation's purest flatteries. O.S.
ALL ABOUT TANKS.
(By our own Erpert Correspondent.)
A FULL description of one of these land leviathians has
been given to your representative, who is a member of the
| National Constitutional Club, by the Rt. Hon. WINSTON
CHURCHILL, M.P. (Telegraphic address: “Sunday Papers,
London”), the inventor of the blonde beast's béte-noire and
a constant member of this Club through all the vicissitudes
of his political career.
Ichthyosaurus irritans—to get to business—has no obvious
material spy-hole, but concealed within the dim recesses of
its vast bulk there lurks a wireless eye, which transposes the
impinging radiations (received in all azimuths) and transmits
them through a model human eye (from the pigmentation
of which all trace of green has been carefully removed) to
display on a sheet of white samite a picture of the whole of
the vicinage displayed in all the glowing colours of the
rainbow. The Professor and his little boy—the sole occu-
pants, the only Jonahs in the maw of this earth-walking
whale—study the picture, and from the results of their study
sight the guns and maxims at their disposal. Crouched in
their camera obscura they stand, seeming in their gas masks
like some foul creatures of a lobster-generated dream in that
hermetically-sealed atmosphere.
And now let us look at the armoury of the Pleistocene
prodigy. The 20-in. guns are of ordinary make, but they
appear to be pointed straight at the walls of their chamber
Ah! Just opposite the gaping muzzle of each is a
plate of Nitchevite so set as to direct the shell downwards
to another plate, from which it rebounds to the outer air–
passing through a trap-door on its way—and once there
two further plates restore it to its original direction, so
that, except for a slight loss of velocity and a few dents,
the shell arrives at the target as though it had been undis-
turbed throughout its trajectory. Similarly for the machine
guns, or Emma Gees. But in addition the barrels of these
are of quaint and indeed bizarre patterns. Here is one
with merely a bent barrel to fire round curves, and here
another with a configuration more like that of a Yale key
and guaranteed to explore every traverse and communi-
cation adit in the most complicated trench. For anti-
aircraft work the barrels curve upwards, for dug-outs they
have a downward tendency. In this latter case of course
heavier bullets are used, but of great resiliency, so that they
have been known to hop down all the steps into a dug-out
de lure and, turning round the corner at the bottom, lay out
a sub-lieutenant hiding under the bed in the corner.
Naturally all the improvements did not occur in the first
design. For instance the first discharge of the big gun the
Professor found rather disturbing to the calm detachment
required for such a job, although Egbert, the son, rather
enjoyed it. Now, however, both are provided with a device,
the invention of the well-known French expert, M.Tirejambe,
which effectually protects them from such disturbance. This
device consists essentially of two tubes attached to the
patient's eardrums and reaching through the skin of the
monster to the free air. This in itself was not sufficient, as
one result was that there was no noise to indicate that the
gun had been discharged. In the case of a missfire it is
highly dangerous to unload, so that it was found necessary
to provide a special stethoscope for the Professor, who,
standing some eighteen inches behind the breach, feels
more than hears, at the moment of discharge, a noise like
that made by an earthworm when dragged out of its nest
by the early bird.
Egbert with his right foot operates the smoke-box, which
causes a cloud of vapour to appear on all sides of the
malevolent mastodon. This smoke not only serves to hide
the mighty Moloch from the enemy, but also acts as a
screen on which is projected, by means of a most ingenious
optical system, a kinematograph display. On the side
nearest the Hun the movies show sausages, beer, sauerkraut,
visits to my spiritual home and other blessings of peace;
while at the hinder end our men are inspired by seeing
the CRowN PRINCE's portrait encircled with his favourite
motto, “Actresses will happen in the best regulated
families.” -
It is not the intention to take many prisoners by means
of the tanks, but large magnets protrude from the sides
which, when energised, will sort out and attract to them
all heroes wearing an Iron Cross and tow them along.
As the mammoths proceed, their lids liſt intermittently to
discharge blood curdling and panic-compelling noises. The
explanation is simple; we have managed to procure gramo-
phone records of Colonel Roosevel.T giving an election
address and of Miss Getta Moveon (U.S.A.) singing a patri-
otic song. Such is American neutrality.
But one of our greatest successes was made at a point
where the daring tanksman had put on a film showing
Lady acting at a charity matinée. The Huns at this
spot were found helpless with laughter and incapable of
resistance, except for one stout Landsturmer, who raved
about the Hague Convention.
But every detail has been thought out, even to making
the mechanical legs hollow, so that, if the machine should
ever come across ice, molten glue can be poured down to
enable it to grip the slippery surface.
“A dispatch from Kieff states that a German aeroplane landed in a
field near Lutsk. A terrified cow charged the propeller with its horns
and smashed it up. The airmen and the machine were captured.”
Not “bad for the coo’’ this time.
“Dr. Röchling, a Prussian Deputy, poured contempt on the talk
about “an honourable peace.' He declared that what Germany
wanted was a German peace.”—Evening Paper.
A very proper distinction.

RIVALRY.
WHEN I sat down on the seat facing
the Row there was already on it a
soldier in the familiar blue clothes. He
had the red moustache which inevitably
leads to the nickname of “Ginger,” or
possibly “Carrots,” and was smoking
a cigarette. By his side were his
crutches. After a minute or so a
very tall figure, also in blue, hobbled
towards us and took the space between
Red Moustache and myself.
The freemasonry of arms has, I
suppose, always, among the rank and
file, made any introduction needless;
but there is now a new and a super
freemasonry which goes beyond any-
thing that uniform could do. I mean
the freemasonry of mutilation. By

“I must look you up again,” said

“Do,” said Six-foot-two. “When do

“There's no knowing. You see mine's

complacently.

“How many did you have?” Red

“So did I,” said Red Moustache,
“and one of my bullets isn't out yet.
It's right in the bone. They're going

covered his good-humour.
“What about your patella 2 " Six-
foot-two inquired after a pause.
“My what?”
“Your patella. Do you mean to say

“I daresay they may have done, but
I don't remember. Still, our doctors
don't talk much—they act.”
“Well, so do ours. There aren't

“I’ve always understood,” said Six-
foot-two, “that Sir Rashleigh is at the

say so.”
“He may be for some things,” Red
Moustache conceded. “But not the

would have been enough for you.”
“Enough 2 What rot! How could

“Yes, it may be. But what I'm

Flight-Lieut. Polyneux stopped his
engine and volplaned silently to earth.
He alighted behind a thick box hedge
in the Imperial gardens at Potsdam.
He was the shyest and most modest
youth that ever wore the uniform of
the R.F.C. Brave to a fault, there was
only one thing he feared, the publicity
of being made a hero. Even while
steering his machine through a hurri-
cane of enemy shell-fire he would not
turn a hair until suddenly the thought
of a headline in The Daily Stunt would
chill his soul and he would tremble like
an aspen leaf. Only his stern sense of
Duty prevented his throwing up work
which might at any moment make him
the theme of heroics. Only his determ-
ination to serve his country had brought
him here. In the discharge of his Duty
he would face a world in acclamation.
Polyneux slipped quietly from his
aeroplane and, taking with him a large
sack, concealed himself in a bush near
one of the main walks, a walk often
trodden by Imperial feet. He had not
long to wait before he saw the well-
known figure of the EMPEROR WILLIAM
|goose-stepping down the path. Poly-
neux had practised his lure, and just as
the KAISER passed he yapped shrilly
like a tender young sausage.
WILLIAM II., thrilled at the sound
and without pausing to think, sprang
into the bush. In an instant the sack
was over his head; he was given no
time to shriek. Five minutes later
Polyneux was flying at full speed for
G.H.Q. with a bulky sack on the
observer's seat.
When he arrived the whole Staff was
at mess. Into the room walked Poly-
neux, and, throwing the sack on the
floor, saluted smartly. The Staff won-
dered, and they wondered still more
when Polyneux, before explaining his
action, implored them on no account
to let his name appear in the papers.
They promised. Polyneux undid the
sack and the well-known features
appeared, somewhat dishevelled after
the journey. In an instant all promises
were forgotten, and the army saw the
whole Staff marching down the street
cheering, while an unhappy young air-
man, hoisted on their shoulders, tried in
vain to hide his face in his R.F.C. cap.
The truth was out. The Daily Stunt
brought out five separate editions with
five photographs of different men, each
labelled “The man who caught the
KAISER.”
Polyneux tried to resume his duties
with the R.F.C. He was offered a
month's leave, but refused. He would
not go to England. The Daily Stunt
was most indignant; it grew furious;
the Ministry was in danger. At last the
Commander-in-Chief summoned Poly-
neux before him, explained how the
whole course of the War was endan-
gered by his obstinacy, and showed him
it was his Duty to return to England,
and by aeroplane.
The word Duty aroused Polyneux; he
set his teeth, mounted his machine and
steered for home.
Around the aerodrome a vast con-
course had assembled, barely kept from
invading the landing space by a cordon
of police all unfit for military service.
The crowd had waited for forty-eight
hours, and it might be seen that the
first thousand rows of people were
entirely formed of women of all ages,
each with a written proposal of mar-
riage in her hand.
A humming sound was heard; the
aeroplane arrived; it lit in the middle
of the vacant space. In an instant the
cordon of police was swept away like
chaff before a gale.

careful search of the ground was made

THE GREAT SET-BACK.
[When True Time commences, the task of
setting the clock back will demand a steady
hand and a cool head. . . . The majority of
clocks will not stand being set back.”—Daily
Paper.] - -
LEAves from the diary of an elderly
bachelor undergoing a rest cure in an
isolated farm-house. Nearest village
or railway—five miles:–
October 1st, 1916.-Afternoon.
I write the word “aſternoon " under
great reserve. Since my man Judson
put the clocks back, time, for us, does
not exist. -
I had warned Judson of the danger
of tampering with timepieces. But he
knew all about it—was an expert.
I awoke this “morning" to find him
at my bedside. He seemed troubled.
Could I tell him the right time 2
Referred him to my watch, the hands
of which I myself had altered.
“It's stopped, Sir," he replied gravely.
“All the clocks has stopped too or gone
wrong.” , -
Subsequent examination on my part
verified this statement. Whilst some
timepieces had succumbed an hour or
so after Judson's ministrations, others
offered us a choice which ranged be-
tween three and ten o'clock.
After studying the sun and consulting
the solitary farm-hand (a stone-deaf
myopic nonagenarian who could neither
read nor write) we came to the conclu-
sion that the hour was approximately
11 A.M., and began our great offensive
on the grandfather clock, which had
stopped at four minutes past four.
Scarcely had Judson laid finger on
the timepiece when it uttered a hoarse
groan, experienced a violent convulsion
within its vitals and fell forward on its
face. When restored to the perpen-
dicular it was found to have suffered
severe casualties to hands, countenance
and body.
Next we advanced to the marble-
encrusted horror in the dining-room.
This clock, to judge from the pace at
which the hands were moving, now
registered 11.57 P.M. For a space we
watched its feverish antics, and when
its hands recorded midnight the monster
chimed forty-seven times in whirlwind
fashion and stopped dead. We re-
wound it, whereupon the hands moved
majestically to the quarter, which it
chimed fifteen times, and then detached
themselves from the face, tumbling off
the mantelpiece into the grate.
Simultaneously I was aware of a
hideous shrieking from a distant part
of the house. Judson, uttering re-
grettable words, dashed from the room.
I followed, and in the kitchen found
my retainer clutching to his bosom,
perches.
beneath the folds of his coat, an alarum
clock.
“It's a repeater, Sir," gasped Judson,
“and I can't stop it nohow. Shams
dead for an hour, then off again.”
“Bury it somewhere,” I suggested,
feeling that I could not tolerate a clock
whose voice was a cross between a
steam siren and a machine saw in full
blast.
Judson blushed; explained that it was
a treasured gift; hinted at a promise
made to the donor that it should ever
be before his eyes. It was a delicate
situation, and we left it, hoping for the
best.
With feelings akin to consternation
we now approached the horological
terror in the parlour. This clock, instead
of chiming decently and soberly, lows
like a cow. Simultaneously two pup-
pets emerge suddenly, bow several times
to each other and then return to their
dug-outs.
This chef d'oeuvre had stopped.
Judson managed to get it going and
advanced the hands to 11.25. Without
the least excuse the thing began to low
like a herd of Jersey kine. Then the
figures dashed out. As far as I could
see the feminine puppet upper-cut her
vis-à-vis while he strove to turn a back
somersault ; both then vanished with a
crash and the lowing ceased.
We gaped at the mystery.
“What'll it do at the 'arf-hour?”
whispered Judson hoarsely. “It chimes
then—proper.” - -
It did. Again the Jersey kine were
amongst us. The puppets shot forth,
crashed together, sought to throttle
one another, recoiled and fell off their
An inward spasm seized on
the clock; it shook as if tormented by
an evil spirit; one could hear the works
falling to pieces; amid a groaning and
grinding it came to a standstill. It was
dead.
“Thank 'evins !” said Judson, wip-
ing his brow.
“We've still got my watch,” I con-
soled him, pulling our sheet-anchor
from my pocket.
It had stopped. But not without ||
achieving what I had hitherto regarded
as impossible. For since the hands
now registered 10.45, and I had set
them at 11 o'clock, the watch apparently
had gone backwards.
Despair settled upon us, to be parti-
ally lifted upon Judson's reminding me
of the cuckoo clock in the spare bed-
room. We ascended, and as we went
Judson's well-beloved reminded us of
her strident presence (by deputy) in the
kitchen.
We got the cuckoo clock to go. Five
minutes later it struck, and with deli-
berate intent I did the mainspring
irreparable injury. As I explained to
Judson, I could not keep that kind of
aviary.
:: : :: :: :k
Night is here. More precise I can-
not be. That siren still shrieks at us
from the kitchen, and with each shriek
I note the growth of a grim purpose
on Judson's face. A romance is in
deadly peril.
Judson, who alleges the possession
of a rough knowledge of navigation and
an out-of-date sextant, now talks of
“shooting the sun "to-morrow.
The nonagenarian farm - hand has
just dropped in to tell us that it is
“past fower of the clock” (though he
does not say which clock). As it has
been pitch dark for some hours he is
probably the victim of an optical hallu-
cination. - -
In my mind lurks one great regret
—that I am not a clockmaker. For it
seems to me, if my own experience
counts for anything, that these me-
chanicians should rank among the most
bloated of war-profiteers.
A GOOD BEGINNING.

THE APOLOGY OF A FAUN.
IT should have happened at Grant-
chester years ago, when we made a cult
of such matters. He would have come
so naturally from the big coppice down
to the river and sat under the willows
there, and we would have welcomed
him courteously and with understand-
ing, and shown him by our own elabor-
ate simplicity how in tune we were
with that archaic period of his.
It should, I say, have happened on
the river above Cambridge, but the
gods for a whim sent him to me in
Sanctuary Wood. I thought it was a
rat scratching his way into my dug-
out, but when I flashed on my torch I
found it was a little faun.
For a moment I thought the day's
shelling had fuddled me, but, as the
little creature crept up and with a
pathetic gesture touched my arm, I
was content to carry on.
“What do you want?” I asked.
“I want the old days,” he replied,
and then I knew this was a real faun.
No faun in history had ever answered
otherwise.
sit and tell me wistful stories of the
dear dead ages, and together we would
mourn their decay. And so it was.
Mother. “CoME Away, JIMMY MAYBE IT AIN'T PROPERLY STUFF::D.’’
He had come, centuries ago, with a
Roman soldier from the South. The
soldier had found him in the Sabine
Hills bewailing the Golden Age, and
had been very nice about it. , PyRRHUs
in the first place had brought him to
Italy, for even PYRI:HUs had a sympa-
thetic vein. The passing of the naiads
moved him deeply.
His Roman friend had been killed
in that very wood, and the faun had
settled there. “He was a good fellow,
like a child, and very fond of stories.
How he laughed I like soldiers, and
here I always had plenty.”
Of the old Flemish burgher-war.
riors (PHILIP vAN ARTEVELDE was his
favourite) and of a bottle-nosed corporal
of MARLBoRough's called Ben he had
many tales.
“I was well known in the city” (he
meant Ypres) “in the good old days—
the good old days when gallants rode
into battle with a laugh and women
waved to them as they clattered past
their windows. These things made
battle a theme for poets—the flash of
gay colours. The earth was fair and
men fought among the scent of flowers
and rich hay. Oh the fine sounds of
battle, the ring of steel, and horses
whinnying as they charged, the cries
of leaders, and the hush of victory at
evening. Did you ever know such
things? You did not. The glory of
war has gone.”
“It has,” I said.
“You live in the earth like rats,”
said the faun, “and your dress is the
colour of mud. You never see your foe
and fight man to man, but blast the
earth, and perchance the foe in it. The
earth is hideous, torn and dead; the
trees are stripped and shrivelled. The
birds are gone, and the air is quick
with the tumult of shells and laden
with the smell of bodies and foul smoke.
You have no love of beauty or of dig-
nity. St. GEORGE is dead, St. GEORGE
of Merrie England.”
I felt this was unjust to me, who
neither made this War nor had any-
thing but the liveliest scorn for the
spoilers of nature. I felt too that if I
could not show our worth to the faun
no one could, but just then a “John-
son " came creaking over, fell and burst,
while the faun huddled by me for pro-
arms, tossing plumes, standards and tection.
I knew too that he would
“Nerves shaky?” I asked, and at his
inquiry explained what nerves were.
At that he was very angry and said
fauns had no nerves. But he had a

soul, and a very sensitive soul, and the
War lacerated it. The world was a
rank vile place, and we were rank vile
people. The old divinity of man had
passed, and Romance was as dead and
desecrated as HECTOR.
I agreed with him, and learnt that it
is unwise to agree with an angry faun.
He danced with rage and said I was as
uncouth as a Boeotian. Some Boeotian
must have insulted him once, and in
the intervening ages he had thought of
suitable retorts. They were certainly
most uncalled-for. With that he de-
parted, but, bethinking him of a perora-
tion, returned with little nervous—no,
sensitive—hops and said that since the
spirit of beauty, honour and gallantry
had left the human race he too would
leave it, and see if perchance in the
wide universe an echo of the old
romance somewhere lingered.
He disappeared and I turned to
sleep. As I slept I dreamed of the faun
sitting in some happy wood, piping to
his nymphs and naiads. And when
they tired of dancing he sang to them
in a quick-set metre of his own. It
was a joyous song in honour of Ares
and Aphrodite, and he told of all the
gallant things that he had seen in the
days when men shone like flashing
stars and their hearts were debonair.
::: ::: ::: ::: ::
It was Mr. Larkins who scrambled
over the parapet to rescue the faun
from the barbed wire. Mr. Larkins is
the most disreputable soldier in the
British Army, but nothing can ever pre-
vent him from speaking of himself with
great respect and in the third person.
He hauled the faun into the trench
amid a hail of bullets, and, having
never seen a faun before, spat to show
his surprise. He then instructed the
faun in the amenities of trench life.
“Now then, young ugly, wotcher
shove yer dial over that parapet for?
You'll get na-poohed if you do it again.
Where d'you come from, anyway?”
The faun sighed and began his tale
of woe; but Mr. Larkins caught the
word “Greece” and became apoplectic.
“Well, what d'you want?” he asked,
“you 'opeless nootral, you!”
“The old days,” murmured the faun,
“Romance.”
“Now cut that out, or Mr. Lar-
kins’ll shove you over the blooming
parapet again. You're like a wonk-
eyed barber in So'o, all talk and
whiskers. What can you do?”
“I can play the pipes of Pan,” sug-
gested the faun,
“Can you?” said the other. “Well,
give us 'Irish Eyes' on the mouth-
organ. Don't know it? 'Spose Mr.
Larkins 'll have to teach you.” And
so until Stand-to they made night
hideous with their unhallowed music.
The next day the faun was adopted
as platoon mascot. The day after, I
found him sitting on the fire-step, clad
in a shrapnel helmet and a tunic the
men had cut down, and playing the
mouth-organ more vilely than I had
ever heard it played before. And he
cut me, the only person who under-
stood his longings.
By the third day his vocabulary
mangled French, English and Hindos-
tanee without prejudice.
On the fourth day Mr. Larkins was
hit, and the little faun sang Homerically
that night. He sang the glories of a man
“in whom there lay no guile nor any
hope of glory; who with harsh words
gave to every man the best he had, for
every man was his friend, his bread to
those who needed it, his courage to all.
“I, the singer, have seen many great heroes,
In all the ages many gallant men,
But none the peers of Larkins and his
friends.
They have sorely wounded him, the hero;
A sudden agony has laid hold of him;
But no complaint has passed the barrier of
his teeth.
Only he laughs and says as how he's bound
for Blighty.
Instead of strafe, the Allyman has given
him a free pass home,
Long leave, and Duchesses to wait on him,
Pommes frites, beaucoup beer. Roll on.”

PROFoundLY impressed by the splen-
did public spirit shown by The Times
in issuing its “Advice on putting back
the clock,” Mr. Punch has commis-
sioned a distinguished nobleman, who
desires to remain anonymous, to write
a series of similarly instructive papers
for the benefit and enlightenment of
the mentally deficient, and he has the
liveliest satisfaction in printing here-
with the first instalment of these edu-
cational contributions.
How To PUT ON Boots.-If boot-trees
are used, first remove and lay them on
one side. The habit of putting on boots
before taking out the trees is strongly
to be deprecated, as leading to dis-
comfort and disappointment. Next
make sure that your socks are a pair,
as the opportunity of remedying such
an irregularity may not occur if your
business should keep you away from
home or the vicinity of a hosier's shop.
Unlace the boots and insert the feet,
not both together, but one at a time,
toe foremost, using the tag as a lever,
or, in case this is not sufficient, employ-
|ing a shoe-horn. When the foot is
inserted in the boot, but not before,
plement. The gum on postage-stamps
lace up the boot if it is a laced boot, is believed to be made of potato-starch,
but not if it is a button or elastic-sided and, speaking roughly, not to produce
boot. In the former case it is best to any deleterious results on normal con-
use a button-hook; in the latter this stitutions. But the licking of a large
implement will not be required. When number of stamps, often necessary in
the lacing is completed bring the ends business houses, is bound to have a

they should be put on after and not doubtedly undesirable. . To avoid this
before the boots.
of a button-hook is optional, but on the
whole is preferred by experts. Shoes
are put on much in the same manner
as boots, but with rather less exertion.
Finally, be careful not to put a left
boot (or shoe) on a right foot, and vice-
versä. The practice, again, of wearing
two left boots or two right boots savours
of eccentricity and creates an unfavour-
able impression.
How To STAMP A LETTER.—The
complete adhesion of the stamp can
be achieved in several ways. The
simplest way, perhaps, is to lick the
back of the stamp with the tongue and
then press the licked side to the en-
velope or postcard. But people of
delicate digestions, or who suffer from
dry tongues, prefer to use a damping im-
Here again the use it is safer, instead of licking the stamp,
to lick the envelope; but here it is neces-
sary (1) to lick the place where the
stamp is affixed; (2) to place the back
and not the front of the stamp in con-
tact with the place licked. If, however,
a damping implement is used in order
to produce the necessary liquefaction
of the gum prior to contact with the
envelope, great care should be taken
not to overdo the moistening of the pad
of the damper, as an excess of liquid is
apt to impair the adhesive quality of
the gum and to cause the detachment
of the stamp in transit, thereby leading
to the payment of a double postal fee
by the recipient.
How To Post A LETTER.—Hold the
letter firmly between the finger and
thumb, proceed to the nearest post-

office or pillar-box, and drop it into
the slit or mouth prepared for the
reception of mails. Before introducing
the letter into the cavity look and see
whether you have addressed it, as this
omission cannot be rectified once it
has been dropped in the box.
How To WIND UP A WATCH.-Before
winding up, be careful to insert the
key, and continue winding until a check
is encountered. Then stop winding.
It is not necessary to use a key in
winding-up keyless watches, though
there is no statutory penalty for its use. .
How To SEARCH For A MISSING SHIRT-
STUD.—Assuming, as we may, that the
missing stud is somewhere on the
floor of your bed- or dressing-room,
we may note at the outset that the
search should not be conducted in
shooting-boots but in stockinged feet.
Some experts recommend the use of a
powerful magnet, but this is of no
avail in recovering studs made of ivory,
mother-o'-pearl, gold or silver, but only
those made of soft iron, nickel, cobalt,
chromium and manganese. On the
whole the best method is to rely on
the use of the eye, supplemented, when
necessary, by spectacles and artificial
illuminants. In looking under a bed
the practice of striking matches is to
be discouraged, owing to the danger of
setting fire to the bedclothes. An elec-
tric torch is greatly to be preferred.
Should the stud have rolled under a
chest-of-drawers, wardrobe or other
article of furniture, which, owing to its
weight, cannot easily be moved, the use
of a stick, golf-club or even a paper-knife
is often helpful. But such aids should be
employed with discretion, otherwise they
may only result in moving the missing
article into a more inaccessible position.
In all cases the use of violent language
by the searcher is to be avoided. It
makes no impression on the stud, and
for the rest neither generates kindness
nor consolidates society. Finally, when
the stud has been observed it is essen-
...tial to seize it firmly and place it
carefully in a secure position on the
dressing-table. Instances are not want-
ing in which studs have been dropped
again in the very moment of recovery,
thus leading to a renewal of the irksome
process of search, which, with its at-
tendant stooping, is often apt to induce
vertigo and other untoward conse-
quences in persons of infirm health or
advanced years.
We greatly regret that, owing to the
demands on our space, we have been
able to hold over Lord 's hints on
“How to get on and get off a motor-
bus,” “How to obtain matches and
sweetmeats from an automatic ma-

FIVE months have passed since you
took leave of me. And ah! how long
the days have been since then.
For some weeks you had had your
marching orders, and so your departure
was no surprise; but it all seemed so
strange and horrible, taking place as it
did at dead of night; and perhaps that
was why the hands that waved you off
were as cold as steel, the face you said
Good-bye to, white and set.
It was the first break in that circle
of ours, and, though I thought that I
had been wound up to face the ordeal,
when it came to the point it was impos-
sible for me to see you go, unmoved.
Then as I began the daily round next
morning, after a night robbed of its
due time of rest, and feeling as though
nothing would ever go right again in
this world of ours, it came over me with
confident certainty that I had not said
Good-bye to you for always, and that
in the fulness of time you would be
restored to me.
And on Sunday last, in the peaceful
stillness of the early October morn-
ing, you came back to me, my long-
lost hour; you came back to your

SUPPOSE YOU TRY A. GLASS OF PORT IN THE FORENOON, AND SAY
BUT I'LL TRY AND
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THAT truly amazing man, Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, has
chosen to present a fantasy of every-day life, life as it very
well might be, but normally isn't ; especially isn't for us
who haven't The Lion's Share (CASSELL) that fell to Audrey
Moze, who (chap. i.) is prisoner on parole in the house of
that tyrannical and reactionary squire her father, and
(chap. iii.) is an orphan with an immense patrimony, out for
a glorious time and (the better to get it) masquerading
(chap. ix.) in Paris as a young widow to escape the desperate
ennui of chaperonage. Bohemianism of set choice in the
Quarter gives place to silken journeyings in resplendent
limousines on the Right Bank and star-lit voyages in
exquisitely-appointed yachts. A little love throws a soft
light on all this magnificence; a little political hooliganism
gives it tone. If Rosamund, the Suffragette refugee in
Paris (an easily recognisable portrait—or travesty), ever
had such back-talk from a youthful follower as Audrey
offered her out of the abundance of a heart swelled with
the splendid life, it would have done her and her cause
much good. A most notable book. What in other less
dexterous hands would have shaped as a mere pot-boiler is
a gay and imaginative piece of work as well done as it
could be. We know our Grand Babylon BENNETT, our
BENNETT of The Five Towns : BENNETT, The Card, and
that superb artist above and apart, the BENNETT of the
incomparable Old Wives' Tale. Here is a brand-new trick
from the repertory of this resourceful prestidigitateur.
The Retreat from Mons (CASSELL) will, I think, take a
place apart from other books that may be written about
that terrible episode by reason of two qualities, its humanity
and its cheeriness. Major A. CoRBETT-SMITH, R.F.A.,
describes himself on the title-page as one who shared in it.
Of the wounds and honour that it brought to himself he is
modestly silent. The charm of his book is that it somehow
leaves the impression, even in its blackest passages, that all
the bewilderment and strain and horror were but part of
the day's work, to be endured with the unfaltering convic-
tion that everything would come right in the end. That
certainly was the spirit in which the 80,000 contemptibles,
outnumbered and all but overwhelmed, carried on, and saved
Europe. And never once does the eye of Major CoRBETT-
SMITH seem to lose its reassuring twinkle; he has always
some queerly humorous aspect in which to regard the most
apparently hopeless moments. I can imagine no sensation
more grimly satisfactory than to turn from this record of
crushing odds boldly faced to the hysteric wails with
which, twenty-five months later, the scribes of the Father-
land are lamenting our superiority of force, a superiority
only remotely comparable with that which they prepared for
others. And, because I know of men, not home-keeping
cranks, but even gallant gentlemen who have not hesitated
to risk all for the cause, who still to-day cling to a philoso-
phic and superior detachment from the recognition of
German methods as being hideous beyond the natural
ugliness of war, I am glad that in this little book a
practical soldier (and therefore the least prejudiced of
observers) has stated again the case against “the obscene

Horror which has plunged Europe into this carnival of
blood and misery.” A book certainly to keep.
Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts, in The Green Alleys (HEINEMANN),
has travelled from his wonted Devon to the hop-gardens of
Kent, a trip which he may well have taken by way of a
holiday both for himself and his readers. Anyhow, I con-
gratulate him upon his excursion, for, although our French
friends tell us that we are always just returning from a
change or are on the point of going for one, I think if they
knew how tenaciously Mr. PHILLPoTTs has clung to Devon
they would be inclined to qualify their opinion. The
native of the green alleys expresses himself less quaintly
than the author's West Country folk, but he is a match
for them in the old Phillpottsian—and to me most engag-
ing—characteristics. This is not, however, primarily a
romance of labourers, but gives us the love-story of two
farmer-brothers, one of whom was born before his parents
were married—a theme that is here handled with a right
restraint and delicacy of touch. In the end the War comes,
and Nicholas, unlucky in - T - T -
love, is compensated with t|M||
the D.S.O. Personally I !-
think to be mentioned in --
despatches would have been
ample solace for him ; but
Mr. PHILLPotts wisely does
not enter into details of the
fighting, and so long as
novelists refrain from de-
scribing the gallant deeds of
their heroes I am content
for them to distribute V.C.’s,
D.S.O.'s, and Military
Crosses at their pleasure.

Costume-novels have been somewhat to seek of late,
which may in part explain the zest with which I approached
The Inheritance (HUTCHINsoN). In part only, however;
the remaining two-thirds being due to my respect for the
artistry of Miss UNA L. SILBERRAD. I may say at once
that I was not to be disappointed. There are, to my taste,
both good and bad qualities in The Inheritance; among the
former being a brisk and adventurous atmosphere and an
attractive heroine; while I should count it on the wrong
side that the plot is made to depend upon some complicated
genealogy troublesome to untangle. Though the date is
the seventeenth century, the worries of that unquiet time
leave the characters singularly unmoved; their chief con-
cern being who is to possess the estate and crumbling
mansion of Scarstones. When I tell you that this is
wrongfully held by a wicked lawyer, and that the rightful
owners are the heroine and the man who loves her, I sup-
pose I need hardly say which party gets it in the end.

tale to an end that had

it provides, in the opening
door—I say no more than
that, the opening door —a
thrill that not even the
very similar climax to Little
Dorrit can outcreep.
In The Golden Arrow
(CoNSTABLE) MARY WEBB
has set out to write a tale
of peasant-life, and in sober
truth she has done it. Not a
person of any social distinc-
tion whatsoever obtrudes
between her and her rustics,
and, if you are anxious to
know how tillers of the soil
really speak and think, here
is the very book to serve
-
even to no story at all. Well, she has done it again in Petunia
(CoNSTAPLE). On the third page of her history I learned that
the heroine “made a practice of being nice to people”; and
so assiduously did she do it that she “often hadn't time to see
that people were being just as nice to her, and that they
were quite as pleased with themselves for being nice to her
as she was with herself for being nice to them.” At first,
then, Petunia was a little baffling to me; I did not know
whether to see her as simply amiable and obvious, or to
suspect the concealed feline. But it turned out all right;
indeed there isn't a really unpleasant character in the
whole book. That in spite of this handicap it so trium-
phantly escapes dulness is a rare tribute to the writer.
What slender plot there is turns upon a will, by which
Petunia's father leaves her that most desirable property
known as the Big House, and a lot of money, so long as
she remains single. The fact consequent that her brothers
and their wives would benefit very largely by Petunia's
marriage leads to some highly entertaining comedy.
Especially is there a Sunday afternoon tea, to which each
of the sisters-in-law brings an eligible male guest to hurl
at the wholly unperturbed head of the hostess, that kept
me chuckling aloud in a fashion unusual for a hardened
reviewer. Petunia is certainly one of the flowers of the

your curiosity. Before tackling her task the author may, for
all I know, have given herself up to a long and arduous study
of these Welsh peasants, but no amount of application could
have produced such a happy result if she had not by nature
possessed an intimate sympathy with their point of view.
Frankly as the characters express themselves, no one who
is not resolutely determined to be shocked can possibly
object to their habit of thought or manner of speaking. So
often have I read novels of this kind in which the peasants
think like philosophers and talk in bewildering streams of
vernacular, that I am grateful for a book which is at once
obviously true to nature and well within the scope of my
intelligence.

BLEATINGS OF AN IMPERIAL
LAMB.
[The CRowN PRINCE has given a further
interview to the American Press, this time in
the person of Mr. HALE, ex-clergyman, the
representative of HEARST, who owns a number
of anti-British newspapers.]
YE who thought that LITTLE WILLIE
Would be sick if war should cease;
Who supposed his chest was chilly
Toward the pink-eyed bird of Peace;
Listen to the soft endearing
Language, as of Love inspired,
Which he uttered in the hearing
Of a clergyman (retired).
“Will this dreadful conflict never end ?
O to see its final Day!”
So he bleated to the reverend
Journalist from U.S.A.
“Tell them,there in New York City
How this butchery rends my heart ;
What a pity! What a pity!
Such a waste of life and art?
“Art, I say. By careful study
We create, to kill or maim,
Tools of torture, strange and bloody,
Poisoned gas and liquid flame;
“Yet (for we are kind as gallant
And with all would fain be friends)
We would sooner see our talent
Turned to philanthropic ends.
“How I wish your free-born nation,
Fed too long on English lies,
Could by heavenly revelation
Probe the facts with Prussian eyes!
“Ah, but Truth and Truth's corollaries
Will not thrive on neutral ground;
Where your treasure (that's the dollar)
is
There your Yankee hearts are found.
“No such motive pricks the German;
Not in loot is our delight;
Love and Mercy and the Sermon
On the Mount—for these we fight.
“O how often I have sat, O
Sat and cursed this wicked strife,"
Musing in some lonely chateau
On my poor neglected wife.
“For from time to time I rather
Miss the old domestic touch ;
As a husband and a father
I am absent far too much.
“Yes, in many an alien show-place,
Though the vintage wine flowed free,
I have told myself there's no place
Tantamount to Home for me.
“Say all this to New York City,
Mention it to Mr. HEARST,
How I cried, “O what a pity!'
Till you thought my heart would
burst.” O. S.
OPONOKA SHOWS THE WAY.
[A contribution that arrived from U.S.A.
too late for “The Manchester Guar-
dian's "American Supplement.]
THE sympathy of the United States
has been freely accorded to the Allies.
We have, generally speaking, approved.
As our Mr. Sirius P. Veckenbilter, one
of our leading ethical munition mag-
nates, said at Rappahannock last week,
“My firm feels it to be no moral
degradation to work for them.” We
have freely recognised that the Allies,
in spite of their high-handed interfer-
ence with American interests, are
arrayed on the side of civilisation—
as understood in Europe. We propose
no interference at this stage on our
part. We know we can't stop the
War at present because Europe has
got out of hand. We must look on
and wait, and calmly occupy the
interval with commercial activities.
We don't mean to lose our heads even
though the whole world should go
mad. But you are authorised to give
this message to the people of Great
Britain—it will put new heart into
them—“We hope to see you win.
There now.”
At the same time it is only right
that you should know that the public
of the United States is both hurt and
disappointed by the cold reception that
has been given on your side to the
proposals of Mr. Hiram P. Doop (one
of our most high-minded citizens and
an acknowledged religious leader in
the machine-gun merger), enunciated
by him at the great Rally of Progres-
sive Bankers held in September at
Poughkeepsie, on the Hudson, and
cabled to you in extenso. These pro-
posals have suffered neglect in your
Press, and yet you could not look
for a more authoritative spokesman
than Senator Doop, who has set his
whole battery of mentality to solute
the most urgent problem of our time—
How to prevent Europe from fighting.
And his considered scheme of the
World Guild of Linked Brotherhood
has received endorsement from many
of our leading financiers and others.
In the words of Mr. Moody Ibsittart, of
Hannahaha, Wis. : “We too often have
fallen into error in the past. There
are those still living among us who can
remember the day when we too pushed

Europe also must learn that when
passion pulls the trigger dividends go
down.” (This passage was enthusias-
tically encored.)
The plain elements of the European
proposition are well understood over
here, better understood by far than they
can be in countries blinded by belli-
gerency. The problem confronting the
States of Europe is precisely the same
as that which exercised the minds of
the statesmen of the frontier district of
Oponoka at the beginning of last cen-
tury. It may be true, as is so often
asserted, that the highest levels of
statesmanship and scope-covering in-
sight have been confined for the last
hundred years to this country, and that
no other nation can point to such a
torch-bearing succession of world-
framers. Still, as General Doop was
careful to admit, there are capable
statesmen in Europe. The question
can be soluted.
In Oponoka (we are quoting from
Judge Doop's own exposition), at the
close of the war of 1812, there were a
number of conflicting powers regarding
each other with jealous animosity.
All the difficulties were there that are
present to-day in Europe. And yet by
the sheer dazzling mentality of her
statesmen Oponoka settled once and
for all her many differences, and for the
whole period until she was annexed,
twelve years later, by the State of Texas,
warfare was almost unknown. How
was it done? By the creation of a
Guild of Brotherhood.
There is only one possible solution
of the mediaeval impasse of the Old
World—the formation of a European
Constitution of Brotherhood on the
Oponoka pattern. As Governor Doop
has put it, “You have all just got to
get under the umbrella, and we can
show you how.”
That is our final message to your
people. Look to us to show you how.

FLUFFY, A CAT.
So now your tale of years is done,
Old Fluff, my friend, and you have won,
Beyond our land of mist and rain,
Your way to the Elysian plain,
Where through the shining hours of
heat
A cat may bask and lap and eat;
Where goldfish glitter in the streams,
And mice refresh your waking dreams,
And all, in fact, is planned—and that's
Its great delight—to please the cats.
Yet sometimes, too, your placid mind
Will turn to those you've left behind,
And most to one who sheds her tears,
The mistress of your later years,
Who sheds her tears to summon back
Her faithful cat, the white-and-black.
Fluffy, full well you understood
The frequent joys of motherhood—
To lick, from pointed tail to nape,
The mewing litter into shape;
To show, with pride that condescends,
Your offspring to your human friends,
And all our sympathy to win
For every kit tucked snugly in.
In your familiar garden ground
We've raised a tributary mound,
And passing by it we recite
Your merits and your praise aright.

“Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,” I replied

I was ready for her this time.
“The coat-frock,” I said easily.
“Right !” said Helen, and then
instructively, “I am wearing one. It

I eyed it. It was, quite.

dreds will be turned away daily, being
informed that for the remaining period
of the War they must continue, willy
nilly, as the free subjects of His
Almighty and All-Conquering Majesty,
KAISER BILL. I sometimes wonder
how long that august person himself
would resist the tempting offer, if only
it could be conveyed to him, of a road-
repairing job on this side of Albert.
In this instance I for one should be
inclined to believe him if he said he
was anxious to share the hardships of
his own dear soldiers. It would be
pleasant, would it not, to see him at
the wheel of a steam-roller? Probably
he would be little use at steam-rolling,
but I feel sure he would make the pro-
cess a dignified and impressive one.
This War has ceased to become an
occupation befitting a gentleman —
gentleman, that is, of the true Prussian
breed. It was a happy and honourable
task so long as it consisted of civilizing
the world at large with high explosive,
poisonous gas and burning oil, and the
world at large was not too ready to
answer back. To persist in this stern
business, in face of the foolish and
ignoble obstinacy of the adversary,
required great courage and strength of
mind; but the Prussian is essentially
courageous and strong. Things came
to a pretty pass, however, when the
wicked adversary made himself some
guns and shells and took to being stern
on his own. People who behave like
that, especially after they have been
conquered, are not to be mixed with—
anything to keep aloof from such. One
had to leave Combles, one had to leave
Thiepval, one may even have to leave
Bapaume to avoid the pest; these nasty
French and English persons, with their
disgusting tanks, intrude everywhere
nowadays, and who can say how long
the soil of Germany is going to remain
sacred 2
I have an incident, which I suppose
I oughtn't to mention, of our “brutal
and licentious soldiery.” It concerns
a man whose conduct on the battlefield
had left nothing to be desired, but
whose behaviour in the short peace
afterwards did not attain the highest
standards of perfection. To be exact,
he found himself in a guard-room, in
the care of calmer and more sober men.
Asked to give some account of himself,
he realized the truth of the maxim that
when explanations become necessary
they are impossible. So he thought of
a new way out of an old quandary.
Pressed for some statement, he made
it clear by signs and gesticulations that
he was a deaf mute. He hoped that
would finish it, but, even if assumed to
be true, that was only the beginning
of what military routine required.
Before the Army will do anything for
or to you, it simply must know what
your religion is, a piece of information
it is very difficult to convey by signs
or gesticulations. The man having
already intimated, in order to consoli-
date his position, that he could neither
read nor write, it was left to the in-
ventive genius of the chief warder to
fill in this particular. Of many attrac-
tive suggestions, a certain fancy religion,
which it would be invidious to name,
was selected, and, within the sight of
the man, was inscribed on the sheet.
He was a deaf mute; he was able neither
to read nor to write; but the strength
of his religious fervour overcame all
these deficiencies. “No blinkin' fear,”
he shouted; “you put me down R.C.”
Does this narrative horrify you, or
can you face with equanimity the truth
that some of our diamonds are not
smooth? For myself, I welcome every
touch of nature in these our warriors.
It is good to be in the midst of them,
for they thrive as never before, and
their comforts are few enough these
wet bloody days. As I go about my
business in the little 'bus, bouncing up
and down on the broken roads, I can
very often give a couple of them a lift
on their way. This serves a double pur-
pose, for if they think politely what a
good fellow I am I also think privately
what good ballast they are.
Yours ever, HENRY.

THE STRANGE SERVANT.
TALL she is, and straight and slender,
With soft hair beneath a cap
Pent and pinned; within her lap
Weepher lily hands, for work too tender.
She's a fairy, through transgression
Doomed to doff her webby smock,
Doomed to rise at six o'clock,
Doomed to bear a mistress's repression.
Once she romped in fairy revels
Down the dim moon-dappled glades,
Rode on thrilling honey-raids,
Danced the glow-lamps out on lawny
levels.
Ere her trouble she was tiny:
'Tis her doom to be so tall;
Thus her hair no more will fall
To her feet, all shimmering and sun-
shiny.
O her eyes—like pools at twilight,
Mournful, whence pale radiance peers!
O her voice, that throbs with tears
In the attic 'neath the staring skylight !
Daylong does she household labour,
Lights the fires and scrubs the floors,
Washes up and answers doors,
Ushers in the dread suburban neigh-
bour.
Then at night she seeks her attic,
Parts her clothes with those pale
hands,
Slips at last her shift, and stands
Moon-caressed, most yearningly ec-
static,
Arms out pleads her condonation—
Hapless one ! she gains no grace;
- They whom fairy laws abase
Serve the utter term of tribulation.
Yet (though far her happy wood is)
Oft her folk fly in at night,
Pour sweet pity on her plight,
Comfort her with gossipry and goodies.

Good old Tanks!

It was truly an historic occasion, and
none the less so for having a merry
music-hall as its setting. To many of our
French visitors, fresh from their own
city of gloom and tragedy, the capital,
of a distressed country under the con-
stant shadow of the invader, this was
their first glimpse of London, their
first sight of the man at the head of
that War office without whose co.
operation France would be—where?
There are doubtless more ways than
was done. Hence these visitors from
France, coming to the land of those
Allies on whose strenuousness they
count so poignantly, were instantly
enabled, had they wished it, even
while the bloody battles of Verdun
and the Somme were still raging, to
join in our favourite game of self-
depreciation and the suggestion that
there is nothing but incompetence and
imposture among our leaders. Surely
that is the height of hospitality—to take
the visitors even into the laundry. It
is to make them one with the family
indeed, and especially when they may
hear and witness the delight of a
Minister for War and one of the heads
of English Law.
I quote the description of the even-
fishy devices.
“A partner is sought to work up and take
entire charge of a girls' school on the Derbyshire
coast. No capital is required, but a lady who
could introduce boarders would be preferred.”
The Lady.

not be amiss either.

Better so, perhaps, in view of the diffi-
culty of extracting humour from these

FA CILIS DESCENSUS.
ONE word is so often used now
I can safely repeat it;
No editor, lifting his brow,
Will stay to delete it;
Each reticence dear to the past
Had died with its brothers,
Till nothing was left but this last,
And it follows the others.
We suppress thee no longer, O Hell,
We have broken our trammels,
Thou art used for tornadoes of shell
Or the temper of camels;
And the need for expression has lent
Such a licence to ladies
That the welter of this world has sent

SEDENTARY.
Jarge tried to enlist at the very
beginning of the War, but they
wouldn't have him.
For one thing, as Jarge himself ex-
plains it, he have a-got a girt dumble-
dore inside his head that nobody in
the world can't get out, and he do kip
a-hummen and a-buzzen so that 'teant
no manner of use, Jarge can't hear
what folks be a-sayen. -
“Nobody do sim to have patience
to talk to I, only the little uns,” Jarge
says, “an' they do put their lil mouths
right again my ear, an' I do hear they
beautiful.”
As well as the dumbledore difficulty,
Jarge's elder brother says his arms
and legs “be perfectly rediclous wi'out
any clo'es.”
For the time being, then, Jarge's
military ambitions were crushed.
In the village, however, Jarge is by
no means a negligible quantity. It
is astonishing how much work those
“rediclous” arms and legs of his can
get through, and how much out-of-
the-way wisdom, not found in books,
regarding weather, crops and beasts
has found its way into his head despite
the dumbledore.
He can make a rick (and thatch it)
as well as any man in the village. He
cuts great bundles of sedges, standing
up to his waist in the river the while,
and carries them on his back fifty
yards to the solid ground where the
cart is standing. Incidentally he brings
on these occasions magnificent “king-
staffs,” or bulrushes, which he presents

Horses, cows, sheep, pigs, dogs—all
like Jarge, and there are few things
that he does not know about them,
including how to terminate their mortal
careers with the least possible trouble,
though it is a thing he never likes
doing. As to kittens—his wife always
has to drown them herself.
He can tell you all sorts of extra-
ordinary yarns, both fact and tradition.
Gnats and harvest-bugs never bite him.
He is an almost infallible weather pro-
phet, and can pick out the pullets un-
erringly among your early chickens.
But Jarge has had to go to the bar-
racks to be examined again. He re-
turned beaming, and announced, to the
consternation of his farmer brother,
that he had “a-got in.” “They do say
I be se-dentary,” he added, not without
ride.
I think that is the last expression I
should have hit upon to describe Jarge.
Except when perched atop of a load of
hay or sedges, I should think sitting
must occupy a very small proportion
of Jarge's existence. Up to work with
the dawn, home to bed with the dusk,
leaves little time for being “sedentary.”
However, Jarge and the dumbledore
seem to have argued the point out
somehow. I found him in the cow-
shed the other day busy milking the
kicking cow—which doesn't kick him—
and he looked round with a slow smile.
“They do tell I se-dentary be sitten
down,” he said, “so I reckon I be just
about se-dentary now, ben't I?”

PETHERTON'S DOG.
I'M as fond of dogs as anyone, but
Petherton's newly-acquired one is, or
rather was, an unmitigated outrage.
In fact it wasn't really a dog at all,
it was simply a barking machine. At
night it barked at the moon, when the
moon was visible, and when it wasn't
the dog barked at it for not being
there, I suppose. In the daytime it
barked at anything, or nothing.
I wrote to him about it—to Pether-
ton, I mean: —
DEAR MR. PETHERTON.—I am sorry
to have to write to you again. I shall
be extremely obliged if you will keep
your dog quiet, and shall institute no
inquiries as to the method you employ
to attain that end. I speak of it as
a dog, because as there is one long
continuous uproar proceeding from the
direction of your garden I presume
that there is some kind of dog attached
to the bark. Neither my wife nor I can
sleep properly owing to the disturb-
ance, but, as I have heard no protests
from your windows at night I imagine
that you can sleep through it. I won-
der how your charming hens like it.
Please convey to them my sympathy.
Yours distractedly,
HENRY J. Fordyce.
Petherton's reply, dated simply
“Glasgow,” did not reach me for three
days. It was as follows:—
SIR,-You seem to spend most of
your time making trivial complaints
about me and my belongings.
I am away from home, as you will
observe by the address, taking a few
days' enforced rest after a long spell
of very hard work, though, judging by
the way you appear to occupy your
time, this will probably not appeal to
you as a sufficient reason for abstain-
ing from worrying me.
I purchased the dog—a valuable one,
by the way—just before leaving home,
so that it might guard my premises in
my absence. I am delighted to gather
from your letter that it is living up to
the guarantee I had with it as a good
house-dog.
I shall not be returning home till
the 13th inst.
A quiet conscience is the finest sopor-
ific I know. Try it.
Faithfully yours,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.

P.S. Don't bother about the dog. It
didn't bark last night. From informa-
tion received I fancy it has broken
loose and sought fresh barking ground.
I'm not surprised. All the air in this
neighbourhood has been thoroughly
barked over.
We had peaceful nights from the 7th
to the 10th, though not inclusive, as
either the dog returned of its own
accord on the latter date or was forci-
bly recruited for Home Defence. The
wretched brute barked incessantly from
the moment of its return, and I read
Petherton's reply to my last letter under
fire as it were. It was short but affec-
tionate:—
SIR, your impertinence' If, as I
suspect, you have been tampering with
my dog I shall know how to deal with
you on my return, which will be on the
13th, though it may be an unlucky day

Faithfully yours,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
By the evening of the 12th my reason
was pushed so close to the edge that it
nearly fell off its perch. I was fully
determined to shoot or otherwise slay
that miserable dog on the 14th if
Petherton should fail to return on the

About noon on the 13th the barking
ceased, and at three o'clock I heard the
station fly, rattling past my window.
I went to the front-door in time to see
the old ramshackle turn in at Pether-
ton's gate. A few moments afterwards
I heard two or three savage barks,
followed by some violent language and
a loud yelping.
Later in the day I heard through the
medium of our maid that Petherton's
dog, having again broken loose shortly
before its master's arrival, had per-
formed what it conceived to be its duty

I wrote a note to Petherton —

If you had come home on the 12th the
dog would not have been loose, and if
you had waited till the 14th it would
have been dead. Yrs., F.
I consider this letter a very mild one
under the circumstances.
There has been no barking since, for
a reason that I can only guess at, and

Out of children's lips again

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ELIZABETH ROBINS PENNELL's new book of random
memories has been called Nights (HEINEMANN) because, as
she says, the record of her laborious days already stands in
print. So now she is to tell us something of her play
times, of the hours when work was over and she and her
husband were at liberty to meet and eat with and talk to
the varied circles of friends who gathered round them in
Rome and Paris and Venice and London. Mostly these
ambrosial nights seem to have been spent in talking, or
rather, on Mrs. PENNELL's own part, in listening. But
perhaps this is only her sly way of putting it. Anyhow it
must have been good talk; as they say in the advertise-
ments the makers' names are sufficient guarantee of quality,
for they include such experts as BoB STEvenson, HENLEY,
BEARDSLEY, HARLAND, and indeed everyone who was worth
hearing in the wonderful nineties. The book gives you a
happy insight into the artistic life of that age, at once so
near to us and so strangely, almost incredibly, remote. It
was the London nights in Buckingham Street that saw the
birth of The Yellow Book and the rise of BEARDSLEY, of
whom there is a new and very striking photograph. The
illustrations, by the way, are a rare joy, and include not
only several portraits that, as far as I know, have never
previously been made public, but three exquisite little
etchings by Joseph PENNELL (throughout called J. in the
letter-press) that are alone worth the half-sovereign charged
for a delightful record, of which it might be said, notwith-
standing its title, Horas mom numerat misi Serenas.
I must say that Miss BEATRICE HARRADEN's The Guid-
ing Thread (METHUEN) seems to me singularly ill-named,
because if ever a story lacked one . . . . However, you
shall hear, to the best of my ability. Horace Holbrook was
a scholar who had married a blacksmith's daughter and
trained her to be an echo of his own learning and opinions.
More especially had poor Joan imbibed quite a lot of facts
about the Renaissance, so that the names of SAVONAROLA
and JoHN ADDINGTON Symonds came trippingly from her
tongue. But one day, loitering near a bird-fancier's, she
realised (with an introspection rare in her sex) that she was
really no more than what the old gentleman in Bleak House
used to call a Brimstone Poll-parrot. So she burnt her
note-books, and after a strenuous interview with her tutor-
husband—during which he most regrettably hit her in the
face—wandered out to cultivate originality. But, as far
as I could see, the only gift she really acquired was a
Napoleonic habit of going to sleep at odd moments. You
would hardly credit the queer places she used as dormi-
tories—a barn, the garden of a total stranger, and so on.
Everybody was very nice about it; perhaps indeed there
were occasions—for example when the old Renaissance
habit got her again, and she would poll-parrot mediaevalism
by the yard—when they envied her this capacity for som-
nolence. Mixed up in the affair was a Dark Lady, whom
Joan called “Ravenhair,” and who called her “Little Wild
Bird.” Do people really talk like that ? With a genuine re-
spect for Miss BEATRICE HARRADEN I take leave to doubt it.

I am thinking, How am I to endure living without him;
without the inspiration of his splendid courage; without
the visible example of his unselfish devotion to his fellows?”
That is the key-note of Kitchener's Mob (CoNSTABLE), the
little epic of J. NorMAN HALL, the American who enlisted
in the Royal Fusiliers and served nine months in the
trenches; and I have no doubt that if Mr. Thomas Atkins,
to whom the above extract refers, could express himself as
well as he fights he would say something equally graceful
about Mr. HALL. Nothing more fine and stirring has yet
emerged from the horrors of the last two years than this
plain unaffected little book. It is a straightforward ac-
count of what life in the trenches really means, written by
a man who combined the courage to live that life and the
imagination to get outside it and analyse it. It is as vivid
as a moving-picture and as stimulating as a novel. With-
out reprinting its two hundred pages in their entirety, it
is impossible to quote from the book, for there is no page
that will make April Folly rank as certainly the best work
Mr. LUCAS has yet given us. But I don't think he has
chosen quite the right name for it, since April somehow
suggests a more madcap humour than any by which so
introspective a lover as Denis would ever be swayed.
However, I hope June, or perhaps August, may bring
wisdom—which in this case would certainly mean Rosalind.
My idea, speaking from deduction only, is that the adven-
tures that make up the volume now called The Smiler Bunn
Brigade (Hodder AND STOUGHTON) have probably appeared
before in magazine form. There is a rotundity about them
that suggests rather the each-instalment-a-separate-story
of monthly fiction than the inter-related circumstances com-
mon both to real life and novels. But I have no prejudice
against it for that. Mr. Bumn and his companions are a
band of very cosmopolitan adventurers, surprised in Ger-
many by the War; and the book recounts their exploits
that is without some flash of
humour or some illuminating ſº
descriptive passage. It is a |
book to read and re-read and
to be everlastingly thankful -
for. War, as read about in
the papers, is a dull and tedi-
ous business. In Kitchener's ~\
Mob we realise that even on | \,
those days when “there is ſº
nothing to report” and “the º
situation is unchanged" mira-
cles of heroism and unselfish-
ness have been happening.
And also, though he keeps it
hidden as much as he can,
we can realise, reading be- -
tween the lines, what a per-
fectly splendid fellow Mr. º
HALL is. And it is agreeable
to reflect that, in spite of
Presidential catch-phrases to
the contrary, America is full
of his like.

friends in April Folly (METHUEN), to refresh your memory
of their former history. Not that you will need any
previous knowledge to fall at once under the spell of such
agreeable company. Anyhow, here they all are again—
Denis himself, and Amory, Rosalind (too little of her), Noel
and the rest. Of course they are all a little older; and the
scene of their activities is now moved to London, where
they are following the arts. Here we see Denis definitely
embarked upon the musical career which, at the end of
the former book, he seemed to have abandoned. The
matter of the present volume concerns the influence upon
that career of a very remarkable young woman. I have
no space to tell you anything adequate about Yvonne. Hers
is a tragic and haunting figure, which seems to me extra-
ordinarily well drawn. There is real art in the manner in
which, from being only a baffling and even irritating inter-
loper who “played her part in life with a complete disregard
of other people's cues,” she comes gradually to dominate
the book; so much so that, looking back, I seem to have
been seeing the story through her eyes, though actually
it is always Denis who is the medium. Yvonne is a creation

TO TINO.
IF to have browsed upon Parnassus' mount
Through years and years and years of school
and college,
Watered my larynx at Castalia's fount
(Neglecting all utilitarian knowledge),
And blown my youth in one long classic beano
Gives me the right to talk with you, O TINo;
Let me awhile resume my pedant's gown
And speak as one in Greekish wisdom grounded,
Who knows your city of the olive crown,
Up to your ancient Parthenon has pounded,
Sampled the antiques in your State Museum
And is a member of the Athenæum.
O TINo, what a fall from that great feat
When Hellas knocked the barbarous hordes of
XERXEs, -
Biffed him at Marathon and sent his fleet
Off Salamis to drown beneath the murk seas |
O TINo, you have read your ByRoN ? Yes?
What would he think of you? I dare not guess.
For you who call yourself a loyal Greek,
You whom with signal favour Fortune beckoned,
Saying, “Young fellow, here's your chance (unique)
To figure as THEMISTocLES THE SEcoSD "-
“Thanks, I'm not taking any,” you replied ;
I'm a Pro-Persian ; l'm the Other Side l’’
Hellone by hyphenation, and attached
By marriage bonds to W. DARIUs,
For him you leave your gates all lightly latched,
(Thus diff'ring from LEONIDAs, the pious),
And tell your people, as you pouch your foe,
“None of your old Thermopylaes for me.”
TINo, if some day Hellas should arise
A phoenix soaring from her present cinders,
Think not to share her passage to the skies
Or furnish purple copy for her Pindars;
You'll be in exile, if you don't take care,
Along with brother WILLIAM, Lord knows where !
O. S.
INTENSIVE cul-TURE OF THE UPPER LIP.
WHEN I joined the Army first they gave me a suit of
khaki, which fitted me perfectly in one or two places, a
Swedish razor which had several sharp spots, a toothbrush,
a pot of blacking to polish my buttons with, and a papier-
máché pendant stamped with my name and religion, in
case I found myself answering to the name of Rockefeller
at any time, or in the wrong church. -
“Got all you want?” said the Army.
I made noises in the negative, and asked them for a
suit of underclothes, to sort of bolster up the khaki, a
shaving-brush as company for the razor, and a sword or
something to keep the small boys away.
“You can't have the underclothes and the shaving-
brush,” said the Army; “we’re keeping them for the next
man. You've got the razor and the khaki—don't be
greedy. No doubt the next man and yourself will be able
to fix things up between you; he can lend you the under-
clothes on cold evenings and you can lend him your khaki
when he goes out to have his photo took—be reasonable.”
“Oh, very well then,” said I, “I’ll waive the under-
clothes and go away quietly if you'll give me a moustache.”
“A what?” said the Army. -
“A moustache," I repeated. “According to Army
Order X.Y.Z. I've got to have one.”
“Quite right, me lad," said the Army. “You have; but
| they aren't on issue; the trooper has to find one out of his
pay of one shilling and tuppence—one shilling for the
upkeep of the trooper, tuppence for the upkeep of his
moustache—see 2 Andnowgotoblazesſorifvehaveanymore-
ofyourlipyoungmanintotheguardroomyougo!”
I saluted in a brisk and soldierlike manner and went
away to start the moustache culture.
- Here and there I was very successful, there and here I
wasn't. My superiors would come up and make funny
remarks about it, inquire who my barber was and did he
shave poodles, or was the effect obtained by training the
hair on a trellis 2 I would salute in a manner cheerful
but subdued, tell them how much I enjoyed their superior
humour, and carry steadfastly on with my moustache
according to Army Order X.Y.Z.. I sought to fertilize the
desert spots with rifle-oil, dubbin, gall-cure, egg and
marmalade; tried dry farming and French gardening—all
to no avail. On the other hand, the oases grew so
luxuriantly that I had to keep felling them to maintain
the average. They were not many in number, and I got
to know them personally: Jane, Gwendoline, Hubert and
Algernon on the near side; Eileen, Harold and dear little
Emily—a slim auburn sapling—on the off. I grew to love
the sound of the morning breeze singing through their
stems, the turtling of the ringdoves among their foliage,
and so on. I wondered if some shy dryad lurked in Harold's
hollow core, if some prick-eared Pan piped on Algernon's
mossy roots, etc.
And now my old friend, Army Order X.Y.Z., has handed
in his papers and retired, I suppose, to those havens of old
Army things, Cheltenham or Bedford, supplanted by Army
Order P.T.O., a cynic, who hints broadly that “mous-
taches consisting of only a few hairs” had best go into the
waste-paper basket. It would be useless to quote to him:-
- “Woodman, spare that tree
Touch not a single bough
In youth it sheltered me,
And I'll protect it now.” -
I know his sort—they get you shot at dawn, in your
pyjamas, for insubordination. .
And so to - morrow the trunks of Gwendoline, Jane,
Algernon, Hubert, Eileen, Harold and dear little Emily
will ring to the strokes of the Swedish razor, and I shall
catch cold in my upper lip and never smile again.

LONDONERS. ANSWERED.
BY JAck o’ LANTERN.
| With apologies to Mr. WILFRED WHIT-
TEN's informative columns in “The
Evening News."
The Storied Past.
K. L. (Twickenham).-Your memories
of London when it was lighted at night
are very valuable. My memory also goes
back some distance, and I can recall
cricket being once played at Lord's.
A City Church. .
C. M. H. (Upper Holloway).-You
say that you remember as a boy being
taken to a big church somewhere near
Ludgate Hill, with an enormous dome,
and on the top of that a ball and
cross, and that you believe there was
a whispering gallery; but you cannot
recollect its name. The City of London
is of course full of churches, and the
TANK on THE BRAIN. ExcITING DREAM of BREADw1NNER Jones.
Toy Late.
A. B. (Bermondsey)–There is only
one golden rule for success in London,
and that is to be born elsewhere and
enter the City as a boy with exactly
half-a-crown in your pocket. Since
you tell me that you are London-bred,
and earn a hundred pounds a year, and
are fifty-three, you will see how poor
your chances are.
The Siege of London.
Canny (Aberdeen). —By a strange
coincidence this correspondent also asks
a question bearing upon the half-crown
rule. At which station, he wishes to
know, do the boys with the half-crown
arrive? The answer is King's Cross,
Euston or St. Pancras.
London’s Fauna.
D. L. G. (Whitehall).-In pre-historic
|times the most likely place in which
“Turn Again, Whittington.”
G. N. R. (Kew).-The authorities
differ as to the place from which Dick
WHITTINGtoN heard the bells which
condemned him to a surfeit of turtle
soup. According to some he was in
Bunhill Fields. According to others,
who are uniformly followed by the
|author. of pantomime, he was on
Highgate Hill. In either case he wore
| tights, carried a bundle and was accom-
panied by a feline friend.
Hampton of Hampton Court.
T. G. (Bayswater).-The original
Hampton who gave the Court his name
was a worthy brewer in Tudor times.
His son, a dwarf, settled on the Sussex
coast, at a point between Worthing and
|Bognor, now known as Littlehampton.
The Thames.
Young Poet (Kensington).-The great
exact identification of the shrine of to see a National Liberal was in good luck of London in having a river

easy; but I rather think it must be

ever care to renew your old impres-
S. Ons.
Where to Shop.
F. M. T. (Little Sidlington). It is
hardly part of my scheme to recom-
mend business-houses, but I may so
far depart from custom as to say that,
for newspapers, guaranteed fresh, the
bookstall at Charing Cross is not bad,
the neighbourhood of Northumberland
Avenue. Quite a number have been
observed there now and then. The
naturalist wishing to study this inter-
|esting creature to-day should hope for
the best in Victoria Street, near the
Westminster Palace Hotel.
|A Confusion Cleared Up.
J. T. S. (Bricton).-The figure on
the top of the column in Trafalgar
Square is Lord NELsoN, the great Naval
Commander, it has nothing to do
Funning through it has before now
been commented upon. I cannot tell
you how many fire policies Father
|Thames has taken out, but he has
never yet had to claim on any.

| Inquirer (Tooting).-I cannot say
who Sally in “Sally in our Alley” was
or where the alley was situated. But
the song was written by HENRY CAREy,
whose mother kept chickens. The sug-
gestion that Sally was SARAH JENNINGs,

THE OFFICIAL REPORT.
“ALL HAS BEEN QUIET ON THE REST
OF THE FRONT."
“WELL, they've made a pretty fair
mess of things, haven't they 2" said
the Company Commander, looking
ruefully round the battered trench.
“Parapet breached in three places,
thirty yards of the wire gone to blazes,
and two dug-outs smashed in.”
“Yes, Sir, and a direct hit on the
refuse pit, which has thrown the rub-
bish all over the place, and it only dug
yesterday,” replied his Sergeant-Major,
lifting his helmet a few inches to wipe
away the beads of perspiration on his
forehead. - -
“It'll take us all our time to repair
the damage to-night. Let's see; we'll
have No. 11 Platcon on to mending the
wire, and No. 12 to -— ”
Whi-z-z-z-z bang! Whi-z-z-z-z
bang ! Whi -z-z-z-z bang !
The two picked themselves up from
the bo' tom of the trench and began to
shake the earth from their clothes.
Suddenly the officer laughed. “Good
Lord, that reminds me. Hiſ Sig-
naller | " he cried.
An unshaven face peered out of an
adjacent hole. -
“Yes, Sir.” . . . .
“Message form, please.”
“Very good, Sir.” -
On the pink slip he wrote: “Situa-
tion report. All quiet acac ac O.C.D.
4 P.M.”
An orderly entered the Battalion
Headquarters' dug-out, saluted, and
handed the Adjutant a message.
“That makes all the Situation re-
ports in,” said the latter, “and, as
usual, all the companies report nothing
doing. D Company's daily hate doesn't ||
seem to worry them. I believe they'd
feel neglected if the Bosches forgot
to wipe their trench out. Can't we
possibly fire in something interesting
to the Brigade for once 2"
“Well,” chimed in the youthful
Bombing Officer, always ready to help,
“last night I fired seventy-nine rifle
grenades at the German trenches,
and * *
The Machine Gun Officer broke in.
“And, as usual, every single shot fell
into the enemy's lines. Groans were
heard and a whistle was blown. This
was thought to be the signal for
stretcher-bearers. We've heard the
same thing often before. Now last
night my guns fired half a-dozen pans
into a party which was spotted at
work on the Bosch parapet, and in n
It was the Bomber's turn : “And,
of course, the party was wiped out.
The enemy's parapet was searched this
morning with a telescope for signs of
the blood, but owing to the mist none
could be seen. Even the Brigade could
hardly swallow that telegram.”
“If you've quite finished,” said the
Adjutant, “one of you might run along
and report “Situation normal,' as
usual.” º -
The Machine Gunner turned to the
Bomber. “Bombs,” he exclaimed, and
his voice quivered with emotion, “I
cannot report “Situation normal.' I
saw a member of the Army Staff in the
trenches to-day. I cannot tell a lie.”
“I understand, I understand,” replied
the Bomber, with an answering quiver
in his voice. “Noble fellow, I will
make the report.”
Among the trees was a white chateau
with a blue roof and a musty smell.
This was Brigade Headquarters.
Around it an “ornamental lake " of
stagnant green water. On the lake a
very dilapidated boat; in the boat two
officers. The elder was lying back in as
comfortable a position as the boat per-
mitted, smoking and listening to the
idle chatter of his companion, who was
propelling the boat with two spades in
place of oars. The elder of the two was
the Brigade-Major, who had been out
from dawn till late in the afternoon,
and was taking a well-earned rest. The
younger was the Signal Officer.
“Anything happened while I was
away?" asked the Brigade-Major.
“Nothing much that I can remember.
Oh! yes there was, though. We were
rather late for breakfast this morning,
in fact it was about eight-thirty that
the Brig. came down, and was just
going to begin to feed when in stalked
no less a person than the Arch
Hun -

Brigade-Major. - .
“The Divisional Commander, of

looked at the table with a sort of
‘Why hasn't the breakfast been cleared
away' look.
“Had your breakfast 2' said the
Arch Hun. . .
“‘Yes, Sir," replied the Brig. with-
out a moment's hesitation.
“Then you might come along with
me," said the Arch Hun, and off he had
to go. The old man returned from the
trenches about an hour ago very fed up
and horribly empty. The Staff Captain
scored rather heavily, though. He
wasn't even down when the General
came in, but he got wind of his arrival
and went out by the back-door with his
tin hat, splashed his boots and puttees
with mud, and sauntered in with a
‘Pretty quiet up in the P sector early
this morning.'"
“And yet they complain of the lack
of brains of the Staff. Hullo! there's
the telephone bell.” - -- *
Hurriedly the boat was brought to
the edge and the Brigade-Major jumped
out and entered the office.
“Hullo! Hullo! who's that ?—who 2
Oh, for heaven's sake speak up, can't
you? Who? Oh, is that you, Sir?

are you ready? Nothing unusual to

Brigade. Yes, that's all, Sir. Yes, good
afternoon, Sir.”
Divisional Headquarters, village of X. |
Outside, the confused roar of lorries and
'buses, limbers and waggons. Inside,
peace and the aroma of cigars. The
kindly-looking gentleman at the tele-
phone laid down the receiver, sat him- |
self in a chair, a real chair, before his
desk, a real desk, and started to write a
message: “The past twenty-four hours

Bang! bang! bang! The whole house
shook with the explosions.
The kindly-looking gentleman ducked
at the first two or three, but recover- |
ing himself went on writing: “Except
that Divisional Headquarters were
heavily shelled towards evening." He
handed the completed message to an
orderly, rose and walked to the window
to see what damage had been done.
Just as he looked out there was another
deafening explosion. One of the motor-
'buses had misfired again.
The message had gone.

AN aching glare, a heat that kills,
Skies hard and pitiless overhead,
And, ever mastering lesser ills,

Fever and dust and smiting sun,
In sooth a land of little ease;
Yet now my service here is done
I think on other things than these.
Dawn on the desert's shortlived dew,
Blue shadows on the silver sand,
Grey shimmering mists that still renew
The magic of the hinterland;
Sunsets ablaze with crimson fire,
Pale moons like plates of beaten gold,
Soft nights that fevered limbs desire,
And stars whereto our stars are cold;
Sharp rattling fights at peep of day,
Machine-guns scarching scrub and
plain,
Red lances questing for the prey,
And shrapnel puffs that melt again;
Swift shifting stroke and counterstroke,
Advance unhurrying and sure,
Until the stubborn foeman broke—
These are the memories that endure.
Heigh-ho! I would not stay—and yet,
Now that the trooper's fairly in,
With vain unreasoning regret
I turn my journey to begin;
For through the haze of dust and heat
That veils the desert and the town,
Still glimmers something strange and

The afterglow of old renown.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, October 10th.-Members re-
turned in good spirits after their seven
weeks' holiday. Mr. REDMOND has
been recruiting his energies—but, un-
fortunately, little else—in Ire-
land. Having promised to do
nothing that shall interfere with
the vigorous prosecution of the
War, he proposes to invite the
House to declare that the present
administration of Ireland is in-
consistent with the principles for
which the Allies are fighting in
Europe. Helpful, isn't it?
The PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD
of TRADE has been loafing—big-
loafing. Remembering what a
young Minister called Joseph did
in Egypt some time ago he has
determined to follow his example
and corner the whole of the wheat
supplies of that country. “The
paper which gets things done"
will assuredly claim another tri-
umph, though in point of fact
Mr. RUNCIMAN's move is only the
last of a long series of steps in
the same direction taken since
the War began. He will not
guarantee, however, that bread
will be cheaper as the result,
and has been reminded that his
great exemplar's success was not
achieved until a Chief Baker had
been hanged.
Curious how the spell of Westminster
holds some men. Of the three new
Members who took their seats to-day
two are old Parliamentary hands. Sir
CHARLEs SEELY and Mr. A. K. LOYD
MR
had both had ten years' experience of
the House of Commons before they
were engulfed in the whirlpool of 1906.
Now they have popped up again—on
different sides of the House this time—
looking none the worse for their spell
in the wilderness, and eager for the
fray.
The first great joke of the new sitting
is the SPEAKER's Conference on Elec-
toral Reform. Whoever selected the
members of it seems to have thought
that the way to secure a satisfactory
machine was to have as many cranks
as possible. The Labour Party has
fared all right, but, with a few excep-
tions, the representatives of the others
seem to have been mainly chosen for
their self-advertising ability.
Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING is the latest
victim of the postal vagaries to which
we are all subject nowadays. He had
three important questions to put to
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, and despatched
copies of them by registered letter to
the WAR SECRETARY and the SPEAKER.
Mr. Lowth ER got his all right, but Mr.
George's “missed stays" somewhere
between St. Martin's-le-Grand and
Whitehall. If the PostMASTER-GEN-
ERAL should receive a wigsing from his
militant colleague it will not be in the
cha: acter of a “premature PEASE.”

Wednesday, October 11th.-A further
development of the Nationalist revolt
against the Government was witnessed
to-day when Mr. LUNDoN (born 1883),
supported by Mr. Hazleton (born 1880),
attacked the CHIEF SECRETARY for per-

deeply, particularly the vulgar expres-

ought to welcome anyone who came to
us with a message of peace, and not
accuse him of “squealing.”
That Mr. LLoyd GEORGE had not
entirely exhausted his vocabulary in
that interview was shown by the man-
ner in which he set about his critic.
What he had said he had said, and
his language was very little stronger
than that which the PRIME MINISTER
had used that very afternoon. Besides,
some latitude was permissible in an
interview, which was “a public re-
port of a private conversation.” Even
Mr. Holt, he trusted, did not talk to
his friends as he did in that House.

He did not withdraw a syllable of what
he had said at a moment, he hinted,
when such a declaration of our fighting
policy was most timely.
This trumpet-note was sympathetic-
ally echoed by Mr. Tootill, who,
speaking on behalf of the working-
classes, said the language of the inter-
view was just what they relished. “It
was brief, brotherly and bright, and
went to the root of the matter.”
Thursday, October 12th. — Hanley
earned an unenviable reputation, two
| generations ago, as the scene of a
man-and-dog fight. It is now chiefly
known as the borough which returns
Mr. OUTHWAITE to Parliament. Most of
Mr. OUTHWAITE's pugnacity is reserved
for British landlords. He has little
to spare even for the enemies of his
country, if we may judge by his re-
cent behaviour. His notion of doing
his bit is to ask the Foreign Office
questions calculated to embarrass our
Allies. They are not answered, of
course, but their mere appearance on
the Order Paper is mischievous. I
confess to sympathy with Mr. STANToN,
the curly-locked Boanerges of Merthyr
Tydvil, when he shouted, “Why don't
you choke these pacifists down 2"
The peace-at-any-price eccentrics are
fortunately few. More numerous and
more obnoxious are the Members who,
while professing their ardent desire to
win the War, nevertheless resist every
measure proposed by the Government
counter to their own ante-bellum pre-
judices.
Mr. DILLON, for example, sees nothing
inconsistent in urging the Government
to make every effort to assist Roumania,
while doing nothing to increase the
supply of fighting-men from his own
country. Mr. LLEw ELLYN WILLIAMs
is another of the half-and-half patriots
whose inconsistency earned a pungent
rebuke from his old friend, Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE. -
The veil enshrouding the origin of
the new war-engines on the Western
Front, whose advent has enhanced the
gaiety of every nation but the German,
was further lifted to-day. Sir MAURICE
HANKEY, Mr. CHURCHILL, Colonel
Sw1NTON and Colonel STERN, all had a
voice in the matter, but as regards the
actual design it is to Mr. D'EYNcourt,
Chief Naval Constructor of the Admir-
alty, that we chiefly owe our tanks.

through the very mild October air, I
was conscious of a new sound. Hitherto
this had been an abode of peace: noth-
‘ing ordinarily to be heard but birds, the
wind or distant traffic on the high road.
But this evening there came to my ear
the steady quick puff-puff, puff-puff of
an exhaust-pipe. Every step brought
me nearer, and at last it seemed be-
yond question—but that was of course
an impossibility—that it came from
Jepson's backyard.
Jepson, I should say, is a handy man,
ready to turn his hand to most things.
He does a little jobbing gardening and
a little window-cleaning; he can sweep
a chimney; he can supply a fowl a
thought I never saw so much felicitous
rural England in so small a compass.
In a word, such peace.
Just to the right of the cottage the
great molten sun, immense through the
October haze, was hanging over the
horizon. Not a breath stirred the
Autumn leaves. A spiral of blue smoke
crept from the chimney; there was a
faint scent of decay in the air; a robin
sang near the wood pile. Peacefulness
in essence; and yet all the while the
new sound was pulsating. It must be
investigated.
I liſted the latch of the little white
gate and walked up the path between
the flowers. At the back of the cottage,
week and a limited number of eggs; where Jepson has his pig-sty and stable,
he is an intermediary for firewood; he I found a new shed, from whose roof
will collect a box from the station; and protruded the pipe which was emitting
so forth. Every village has someone
of the kind. His own garden is a
model of care and luxuriance, and just

score and more of chickens, which were
pecking at windfalls from the apple-
tree that spread over the yard, was

inches in diameter, and the worm of its
screw shone brightly as he moved it
from side to side. * *
The far too fat spaniel by the door
lifted one eyelid as I came into view
and immediately fell asleep again.
“I came to see if you could come
up to-morrow sometime,” I said, “and
give us a hand with the lawn.”
“Sorry,” he said, “I can't. I've
got a new job now and no chance of
leaving it. Munitions. I've put in an
oil engine and a lathe. Look.”
He handed me the brass object and
explained its fell purpose. “You know,” |
he said, “I used to be a bit of a me-
chanic. I turn out a score and more of
these shell-fuses every day. I wonder
how many Germans this one is going
to do in,” he remarked meditatively.
The robin still sang on. The sun
was lower now and the sky a more
lovely tint.

But the first thing the reinforcement
did was to put out its tongue at the
sentry behind the gate. It wasn't
much of a tongue, and yet it showed
what Oswald was up against for the
afternoon. With great promptitude he
put her under arrest and started a
court-martial, and then he made his
mistake. If he had given her C.B. he
could have gone on with a properly
conducted and dignified war, but he

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MRs. HUMPHRY WARD has worked the minor miracle of
restoring to me, in my hoar and post-military antiquity,
that almost apologetic sensition of callow youth from
which I had believed myself for ever divorced. She has
done this by writing, in Lady Connie (SMITH, ELDER), a
story all about the Oxford that was “before my time"; to
be precise, in the late seventies, a period known to my
generation only from photographic groups, already mori-
bund, on the walls of club rooms or J.C.R.'s. But here it
is all living again, as fresh and brilliant as a sympathetic
and knowledgable pen and an engaging story can make
it. Briefly, this story tells of a girl, Lady Connie, the
orphaned child of noble and wealthy parents, who comes
to spend a year with some not too rich or attractive
relations, a struggling Reader and his family, in a small
house in Oxford; and how she sets the whole place by
its academic ears. The tale is certainly the best that
Mrs. WARD has yet given us in what we might call
her new popular manner. And, for those who know,
it provides an added joy in the recognition of some
quite unmistakable Varsity portraits. Above all, Mrs.
WARD has succeeded in the difficult task of putting the
real atmosphere of Oxford into her pages. For this we
must, I suppose, forgive her some obvious slips, as where

years ago.
I am tired of standing cap in hand before Mr. WELLs,
and assuring him that each novel as it comes from his
hands is better than the last. The merest worm of a critic
wants to turn and put up a case against him to “save face.”
But honestly I can't do it. I am bound to testify that of
some three-score War-books I have read Mr. Britling Sºes
1t Through (CASSELL) comes nearest to being a big book.
Certainly no work of War fiction can compare with it. Mr.
Britling is a writer, thinker, visionary and internationalist;
author of And Now War Ends ; a man of forty-five; one
to whom war is only the most palpable insanity in a mad
world. And when the bomb which seemed to well-meaning
folk impossible actually explodes under him it heaves
him up, with many others of his school, on to a different
platform in another world. He retains his faith in a sane
future, but turns to deal with the mad present; and finds
that he is helpless. His thoughts whirl wildly round him.
There is a premium on men of action, even stupid men.
And then he is struck through his son and his friends, as
so many of us cheerfully assume we shall not be struck.
I find the later-developed method of the author exceedingly

episodes, his going straight to the heart of the matter and
never boring you with details which imagination, craftily
stimulated, can supply. The “preparation” of his tragedy
is admirable—“Matchings Easy” with its charming, irre-
sponsible, comfortable household, including young Heinrich,
the tutor, and that excellent dazed visitor from Boston,
Mr. Direck. It is Mr. WELLs's triumph that his perpetual
apologia, his thinking aloud with such obvious personal
reference, is not resented as an impertinence but valued as
a privilege. And in certain passages of tenderness and
grief and imaginative forecast he reaches a level of nobility
which makes his book stand worthy of its sublime theme.

of Mr. CLoDD himself, very plea-

have been endowed with a natural
genius for friendship. “If they

and they brag so over their work"—a fairly concise state-
ment of a truth since universally accepted. In my capacity
of guide I might suggest that, if you lack time for the whole
volume, you should certainly not miss its two most inter-
esting chapters, those about MEREDITH and GIssiNg. The
former especially is a biography and appreciation in little.
PENDING DISASTER.
Of course the value of Salt and Savour (METHUEN)
depends on how real Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick's opportunities
have been of studying the Teuton in his native lair. I must
say that the picture—very far from pleasant—seems to fit
the original, though no doubt one has to make some allow-
|ance for war-prejudice. But the behaviour of Captain
Erdmann, who married Brenda, an Englishwoman of Ger-
man extraction (an unhappy class these bitter days), and of
Professor Zorn the disgruntled Anglophobe, offers, even in
their pre-war life, such a wonderful forecast of the arro-
gance, the fatuous boastfulness, and the hysteria that we
have seen in the official conduct and utterances of Germany
during this War; and particularly in these days when we are

so gloriously getting back our own, that the presumption is
all in favour of Mrs. SIDG wick; even where the incredible in
the way of ill-temper, malice, grotesque manners, lack of
chivalry and lack of humour is indicated by her ruthless
pen. War breaks out during the second year of Brenda's
marriage, and the author uses competently and fairly the
incidents we all know of but even now can scarce believe. To
anyone who is in danger of good-natured or apathetic for-
getfulness this book may be commended as a tonic reminder.

There was a BERNARD CAPEs to whom I have owed
some pleasant half-hours in the past. He is apparently
deceased. At least I am impelled to that conclusion when
I find a man of the same name declining upon such inade-
quate variations on the hoary theme of the bored and
middle-aged guardian and the aggressively beautiful and
rapid ward as are offered in If Age Could (DUCKworth).
Even the introduction of a wonderful elixir of life (with an
unearthly smell) found in a bottle behind a stained-glass
window concealed in a wardrobe, and the dragging in of a
Zeppelin bomb which wiped out both ward and guardian
in the house of the secondary heroine, who was saved to
live happily ever after with the peer-chauffeur, left me cold.
Perhaps there was some extreme subtlety of conception
which I missed, but I doubt it. The whole thing, not
redeemed even by the practised craftsmanship which this
new Mr. CAPEs still commands, strikes me as but another
of the minor tragedies of the War.

Staking his all on the German stunt,

W. Eternal battle? Why, you ought to rejoice in it.
Let the enemy beat with all his force against the steel
rampart of our German bodies till he realises that all his
efforts are in vain. That's the principle I went on in the
Verdun fighting, and it's quite infallible.

to lose. That's what they're there for, isn't it?
R. Oh, yes, that's right enough if only you win. Then
you get the laurel wreath, and your old man comes along
and makes one of his patent speeches. But if you don't
win it's the devil. Everybody blames you, and it's not
a bit of good saying you did your best, for nobody be-

R. Now their guns are as big as ours, and they've got
plenty of stuff for them, and they've got masses and masses
of men, and they can fight like the devil, and they will keep
coming on; and the French, whom we thought degenerate,
are every bit as bad as the English. I'm simply fed up
with having them on the top of me every day and every
minute of it. .
W. My poor dear RUPPREcht, you have got it badly.
R. Yes, and I'm almost forced to think that we should
have done better if we hadn't had this infernal war.
W. RUPPRECHT, I'm astonished at you. How can you
bring yourself to say such deplorable things? Look at me.
I don't feel like that. It's true we're not winning many
victories, but I'm having the time of my life. When all's

R. That's precisely what I'm beginning to doubt.
W. My poor friend, you want a pick-me-up.
R. Pick-me-ups are no good. I've tried them.
W. Well then, do what I did : give an interview to an
American journalist. There are plenty about, and you can
always get a tame one. I did. And I pulled a long face
and looked as pious as I could, and told him how deeply I
felt the miseries of this War, and how I longed day and night
for peace, and how terrible it was to realise the sadness of
the struggle and the dreadful nature of our engines of
destruction, and so forth and so forth. The old gentle-
man beamed at me through his spectacles and swallowed
it. all—yards, and yards of it. It was enough to make
a cat laugh. I tell you, RUPPRECHT, I'm the champion
impersonator of the angel of peace. Can't you see my
wings?
R. I daresay it was a good joke, but I don't feel inclined
for it somehow.
W. I'm afraid yours is a difficult case.
R. What a helpful fellow you are. But you're out of the
turmoil just at present, so you have time for jokes. I
haven't.

George Fokus, who knows everybody,
indicated a luncher at a neighbouring
table. “That's an interesting man,”
he said.
“Which one 2 " I asked, in the un-
certainty that always follows such
remarks—“the one with the spectacles
or the one with the buttonhole 2"
“The one with the buttonhole,” he
explained. “His is one of the oddest
professions in London. He makes
revues succeed.”
“I thought that was automatic,” I
replied.
“Far from it,” said Fokus. “Most
of them would fail but for that little
man's attentions. But I'll ask him to
join us over our coffee and you shall
hear. He's a great card.”
In due course Fokus fetched him
over to our table and we T. -
settled down to talk. |
“I hear you're a great &
revue-producer,” I said by
way of opening.
“Oh, no,” he replied, ".
“nothing of the kind. I
don't produce; I reduce.' '
I never see a revue till the
last rehearsal or so, and
then my work begins.” -
“Would you mind tell-
ing me?” I asked.
“Certainly. |
-
You see,
even now, after all these
years of frenzied compe-
tition and triumphant in-
anity, there are still re-
vue authors who try after
ideas, who think that a
revue should review something, should
show a sense of what is going on in
the world. Possibly they once went
to a French cabaret; possibly they are
merely dense. Anyway there it is,
and when I arrive at one of the last
rehearsals I often find signs of such
aberration still in the dialogue. Part
of my work is to cut it out.”
“But why,” I asked, “does not the
manager do that 2"
“Manager?” he replied with a stare
of surprise. “What does a manager
ever know about his pieces? Why, he
never even knows how long they will
play. Anyway, my first duty is to cut
out whatever bears upon actuality.”
“But surely,” I remarked, “I have
heard politics mentioned—or, at any
rate, politicians.”
“Tell me,” he said.
“Well,” I replied... I can swear I've
heard references to WINSTON.” -
He nodded.
“And LLoyd GEORGE.”

the songs so that the patriotic ones are
always sung by aliens, usually Ameri-
cans. For some reason or other the
public doesn't resent this—even likes
it; but I assure you that again and
again I find a manager forgetting it.
But by the first performance I have
that all right too.”
“Well,” I said, “I don't understand,
after what you have told me, how any
revue can fail.”
“Because,” he replied, “there are
still one or two managers who neglect
to call me in.” -
“Wait and see' sooner or later, and
thinks he is being humorous about the
PREMIER.”
“Yes, that's so. You're right,” he
said. “But that's as much as I per-
mit. No one else in political life must
ever be placed before revue audiences
if they are to be pleased and satisfied.
Any other references I cut out. That
is one of my chief functions. When it
comes to public life generally all I allow
is one mention of The Daily Mail and
one of John Bull. The mere words get
the desired laugh. I am now relaxing
just enough to let SMITH-DoRRIEN be
named and, since he has been doing

but frankly confess that I have at

Colonial, too, and a horseman, the last
man you would have expected to com-
mit such a disgraceful act. Sure enough,
however, when his regiment came to
count itself over, on leaving the front
for the back, he was missing. What
made it all the worse was that, although
they had come up to fight, they hadn't,
as things turned out, had their oppor-
tunity of doing it. Nevertheless the
man wasn't there and, therefore, had
run away. The search was started
and trace of the absentee was found at
last. Being of an original turn of
mind, he had run East instead of West;
he had changed his distinguishing
marks and had tacked himself on to the
Infantry Regiment. The first this
regiment had seen of him was when
he turned up to fight with them in the
trenches; but they, too, when they
came out of the line to rest, were
unable to produce him. He had, in
fact, deserted a second time, seizing
the opportunity of a relief to go over
to the relieving battalion. In the
trenches they found him at last, utterly
oblivious to the gravity of his mis-
conduct and thoroughly enjoying the
battle . .
There was once, not so very long
ago, an adjutant, a most virtuous and
industrious adjutant, who left nothing
undone which he ought to do, did
nothing which he ought not to do, and
in whom there was much health. All
the vexatious matters which may arise
from below or, more especially, descend
from on high to plague the life of his
kind failed to upset him or to cause
him to step aside from the straight
and narrow path. Moreover, he was
himself a model of that strict discipline
which he preached to others. Tiresome
telegrams and malicious memos he en-
dured without end, but at last came the
straw which broke the camel's back.
For the good of his regiment and for
the speedier defeat of the Bosch he in-
dented for I don't know what battle
material, and he addressed his indent
to Ordnance. Slowly but surely his in-
dent climbed the ladder of departments,
until it arrived upon the table of some
Assistant Director of Ordnance Supplies
at a base. Whether it was that the
digestion of this A.D.O.S. was at fault
or that the indent, lying at the bottom
of his IN box had caught his eye many
times and, notwithstanding its mute
reproach, had been neglected so long
that at last it became hateful to him,
this A.D.O.S. was very angry with it
when at last he came to handle it.
Being angry, he supposed himself
aggrieved, wrote across it, “Why is
this indent submitted to this office?”
and threw it into his out box. Thus it
made the return journey, every lower
department repeating the query," Please
say why this indent is submitted 2"
It reached the Adjutant, in a frail
dug-out, under fire, at a wet, cold and
unpromising hour. He had waited
a patient fortnight for the goods, and
all he got was the question, “Why was
this indent submitted ?” So he took
his indelible pencil and very slowly and
very clearly he wrote the answer:-
“Owing to the great European War
now raging.”
Another deserving case for a little
leave, you think? Perhaps you will
go so far, if you can screw up any
sympathy for an A.D.O.S. at a base,
as to see two deserving cases 2 And if
they got it, and met and recognised
each other in London, do you suppose
the feathers would fly? Not a bit of
it. You'd find them tumbling over
each other to pay for each other's sole.
Yours ever, HENRY.
THE ZEPPELIN EXCUSE.
[Three dairymen who were summoned for
selling milk below the legal standard pleaded
that since the Zeppelin raids the cows had
become very nervous and did not yield the
usual quality of milk.]
IF you are sued on quarter-day
And lack the where withal to pay,
Just smile upon the judge and say,
“Last week the Zeppelins came our
way,
Since when the hen declines to lay;
The rabbit, once so blithe and gay,
Turns from his matutinal hay ;
The horse that used to draw the dray
I rather think is going fey ;
While Anne, the cow, a dappled bay,
Roams like a wraith upon the brae,
Dancing the two-step and Strathspey;
But as for what the French call ‘lait ’
The creature ceases to betray
The habit dear to bovine clay
(Including goats and such as they)
Of giving nourishment away.
The cauliflowers that used to sway
Beneath the breeze in blithe array
(I bought the seed in early May
From Smithers of St. Mary Cray)
Show every symptom of decay;
And, though with nitrates and a spray
I down the nascent grub and slay
Innumerous slugs both black and gray
That through my early rhubarb stray,
They have, to my extreme dismay,
Rather the better of the fray.
Briefly, the rent has gone ‘agley'ſ
It serves no purpose to bewray
The situation or inveigh
Or wear a face as sour as whey
When of misfortune you're the prey.
And so I simply ask a stay
Of execution. Say not 'nay' "
THE SERVANT OF A SERVANT.
I MAY say at once that the unfor-
tunate situation that has arisen in my
aunt's household is not entirely owing
to the War. As long ago as 1911
(Meek went to her in 1910) the ground
was being prepared, the seed sown.
The atmosphere created by the War
has only ripened it more quickly. But
I speak in riddles; I will tell you the
whole story as simply as I can.
In 1910, as I say, Aunt Agatha
engaged the services of Millicent Meek
as maid. I suppose you would call it
“confidential maid,” for there seems
to have been unlimited confidence.
Confidence in Meek, I mean, both on
the part of Aunt Agatha and also on
the part of Meek herself. For my
aunt soon found that Meek was an
invaluable servant. Meek had known
it from the first.
As time went on the confidence
steadily increased. Meek became more
and more valuable.
Then War broke out. You may
remember that it was in August 1914.
In November came the first bomb—
or rather bombs. For in that month
work began at the new Munitions Fac-
tory just outside the town.
“A great many girls are leaving
their situations to go and work at
munitions,” said Meek.
She said this very quietly—Meek
was always very quiet. She did not
dance a war dance round the room ;
she was not that sort of person, you
understand. But her remark was some-
thing of a challenge for all that. At
any rate, Aunt Agatha must have taken
it as such, for she had the morning-
room re-decorated and turned into a
sewing-room for Meek. The old sewing-
room had a North aspect and Meek
had a weak chest. Or so Aunt Agatha
told me.
Things went on all right for a while,
until that unfortunate article in Home
Twitter about women on the land.
The idea of Meek on the land was
too silly, of course. She would have
been off the land in half an hour. But
the day after she had read the article
she said very quietly to Aunt Agatha,
“A great many girls are leaving their
situations to go and work on the
farms.”
Aunt Agatha bought a gramophone
for the sewing-room and a more com-
fortable chair. She also ordered The
Daily Scale for the sewing-room. As
she had never had any paper except The
Morning Host herself you can see how
far things had gone.
Then came the fruit-picking season.
Aunt Agatha will never forgive Aunt
Janet for talking about woman fruit-

for that evening Meek said, “A great

Aunt Agatha might have retorted that
Meek was quite knocked up through

º affair—the year
efore. But instead of that she bought
| Meek a parrot—she is fond of parrots.
I mean Meek is, of course; Aunt Agatha
| dislikes them intensely. And she gave
| her a gramophone record which she had
resolutely refused her up till then. It
was “Keep the Home Fires Burning.”
Aunt Agatha's is a badly built house
and the walls are thin, and “Keep the
Home Fires Burning,” with parrot obbli-
gato, necessitates a temporary evacua-
tion of the drawing-room.
That is the position up to date.
Aunt Janet prophesies that one of
these days a great many girls will be
leaving their situations to go as post-
men, and that Meek will then have a
pony-trap and an ermine stole. But
then Aunt Janet is still smarting under
the rebuke she suffered for the fruit-
picking indiscretion.

AT THE TOMB OF ELIZABETH.
THERE lies a queen in Westminster's cool shade,
A mighty queen who ruled us long ago,
Who by repute could call a spade a spade
In ways to set our modern hearts aglow;
Who lived her life, supremely unafraid
Of anything on earth or down below,
- And generally put the fear of death
In those whom she disliked—ELIZABETH.
She had her failings, be it not denied,
But she had royal virtues not a few;
The knave who thought to get on her blind side
Might think and think again till all was blue;
The foe that rose against her in his pride -
Bit off a good deal more than he could chew;
And more especially the current Boschi; : -
Found that his little systems didn't wash.
For at that spacious time, as in our days,
His gentle race came spreading o'er the land
To try in peace his penetrating ways
And teach us culture—his peculiar brand;
And ORIANA 'twas whose prescient gaze .
Saw that the time had come to take a hand.
She did not haver, showed no sign of doubt
As to her views, but turned the whole lot out.
And her own land rose up and called her great.
And now above her kingly dust she lies,
Sculptured in stone, in robe of regal state,
Grim-jawed and with a nose of eagle size.
And there to-day I turned to meditate,
To think how frank she could be and how wise,
And how emphatically she was one
Too many for the enterprising Hun.
But ah, how great a wonder came to light!
Vainly to-day one seeks that marble queen.
Men have erected, 'twixt her and the sight,
A monstrous pile of sandbags for a screen
Against the clumsy Teuton of the night
Who drops his bombs upon a world unseen,
And, could he reach her with a lucky toss,
Would earn, for old times' sake, his Iron Cross.
One hopes that she may own the good intent,
Confess the prudence and accept the zeal;
It may be that the age-long compliment
Will in some fashion make its due appeal;
Yet oh, great Mistress, 'neath thy sandbags pent,
Thinking of what thou wast, one can but feel
What wealth of phrase, what turnings of disgust
Are stirred in thine indomitable dust DUM-DUM.

ing refreshment “oft in the stilly
night.”
I am afraid that along with their
taste for whisky the Nationalists have
lost something more valuable—their
sense of humour. Otherwise they
would hardly have invited the House
of Commons to declare “that the
system of government at present main-
tained in Ireland is inconsistent with
the principles for which the Allies are
fighting in Europe.” -
In its literal sense this is a platitude.
The system of administration in Ireland
is, and always has been, inconsistent
with any settled principles whatsoever.
But to propose such a motion at the
present time is equivalent to affirming
that Ireland is being treated by Great
Britain as Belgium and Poland and
Serbia have been treated by Germany.
Mr. REDMoND wisely made little or
no attempt to prove this absurd thesis.
Most of his speech was devoted to a
catalogue of the blunders committed
by the War Office in its dealings with
Irish recruiting—blunders which Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE freely admitted and
promised as far as possible to amend.
So far the Nationalist leader had the
House with him. But when, with the
embers of the rebellion which he had
failed to prevent still dangerously
smouldering, he went on to demand
that martial law should be withdrawn
and the interned rebels be let loose in
a Home-Ruled Ireland, he asked too
much even of that amiable and trust-
ful beast, the British Lion.
Mr. DUKE is not exactly a sparkling
orator, but he said one thing which
needed saying, namely, that Irishmen
ought to work out a scheme of Home
Rule for themselves, and lay it be-
fore Parliament, instead of expecting
Englishmen to do their work for them
and then complaining of the result.
In the division-lobby the Nationalists
received the assistance of some forty
or fifty British Members of the SIMON
and TREVELYAN type, who supported
the motion, I suspect, more out of
hatred for the Coalition than of love
for Ireland. But they were easily out-
voted by British Home Rulers alone.
I don't think that Mr. REDMoND will
congratulate himself on having done
a good day's work. The impression
left by the debate was that the Nation-
alist Members had a good deal more
sympathy with the Sinn Feiners than
they had with the innocent victims of
the rebellion. That may or may not
help to revive their own popularity in
Ireland; but it is hardly calculated to
help the Home Rule cause in Great
Britain or to fill the depleted ranks of
the gallant Irish regiments with volun-
tary recruits.

MY OLE BILL's A GLUTTON WHEN
To-night, the Rhodes Estate Bill
came up for second reading. Under
the will of the South African Colossus
fifteen of the scholarships established
at Oxford University were reserved for
German students nominated by the
KAISER. The testator appears to have
made this extension of his munificence
in the childlike belief that it would
render war between England and Ger-
many impossible.
Some trouble on the Continent of
Europe having made it inconvenient
to fulfil this part of the trust, the
trustees sought power to vary it, and
divert the money from Germany to the
British Empire. This seemed reasonable
enough to everybody but Mr. Joseph
KING, who saw in it only a mean
attempt to defraud the University that
he formerly adorned. Lord HUGH
CECIL, Oxford's Parliamentary burgess,
approved the Bill in principle, but
thought that power should be given to
the trustees to allocate the new scholar-
ships to foreign countries, such as our
present Allies. So it is possible that
in the near future most roads will lead
to Oxford, as in the Middle Ages.

According to Mr. Roosevel.T, as
quoted by The Glasgow Evening News :
“. . . the danger of war is ever creeping
nearer because of the Pontius Pilot construc-
tion Mr. Wilson has put on the word neu-
trality.”
We gather that the ex-PRESIDENT is in
favour of “dropping the Pilot.”

SIR,-When I was visit-
ing the Andaman Islands
in the early “nineties”
the Zoological Gardens
had lately been enriched
by the acquisition of a
magnificent Bombay duck,
the gift of the Begum of
Bhopal. One morning
this splendid creature un-
fortunately escaped from
its cage and, frustrating
all the attempts of the
attendants to capture it,
flew into a large com-
pound tenanted by a covey
of yaks. . The results were
disastrous, for the yaks
the porpoise emitted loud squeals like
those of a pig. It was a terrifying
spectacle, and we were greatly relieved
when the albatross, wearying of its
pastime, majestically soared up into
the empyrean. A full report of the
incident subsequently appeared in The
Scilly Gazette.

BABooN AND GoRILLA.
Rougemont, Lunéville.
SIR,-When I was an undergraduate
at Balliol in the late “sixties,” I spent
part of one long vacation in Ross-shire
with my great friend—now, alas! no
more—Hector Annan Nyass, a brilliant
Scotsman whose ancestors had been
pioneers in Nyassaland, with which
he kept up a close connection. After
one of his visits to Central Africa he
brought back a large baboon, the most
gifted member of this species with
which I have ever been acquainted.
Baboons, it is well known,
act as railway porters in
South Africa, and a move-
ment is, I believe, now on
foot to confer on them a
limited franchise. Cer-
tainly Pong Cham Binny
—for,that was the name
of Annan's friend — de-
served the rights of full
citizenship. He used to
wait at table and was an
expert gillie and beater.
It was in this latter capa-
city that he was engaged
at the time of the inci-
dent of which I was a
witness in October, 1867.
We were stalking caper-
cailzie, when an enormous
gorilla, which had escaped

intruder, and fell an easy prey to its
powerful beak and claws. Seven per:
ished in the mélée, and it was only
by the heroism of one of the atten-
dants, who succeeded in throwing a
large sheet covered with glue over
the infuriated bird, that the remainder
were rescued from annihilation. I
am told that the Begum never quite
got over the news, and fell into a
state of melancholia from which she
could only be aroused by injections of
lycopodium.
I am, Sir, yours duly,

TALEs of A GRANDFATHER.
Horse Marine Parade, Yarmmouth.
SIR,-My grandfather, a man of the
most scrupulous veracity, used often
to tell us of an extraordinary occur-
rence which he witnessed when serving
as a ship's surgeon on a Dundee whaler
off the coast of Greenland. A semi-
extinct mammoth, which was basking
in the sun on the beach, was suddenly
attacked by a gigantic porbeagle, and
before it could rally its forces was
dragged into the sea and devoured.
The porbeagle was afterwards, har-
pooned by the crew of the whaler, and
its skeleton, with the mammoth's inside
it, is one of the choicest heirlooms in
our family. I may mention as a strange
coincidence that my grandfather was
himself partially devoured by a huge
land-crab in the Ozokerit Islands, where
he held the post of Fisheries Inspector
until the locality was submerged by a
tidal wave.
There is, as all naturalists are aware,
an hereditary feud between baboons
and gorillas, and before any of us
could intervene the two had grap-
pled in a deadly conflict. As a
last resource Annan fired his rifle
at the gorilla, but the bullet unhappily
penetrated both combatants and both
succumbed to their wounds. What
made the tragedy doubly distressing
was the fact that Jowett had that very
day written to Annan to say that he
was prepared to accept Pong Cham
Binny as a candidate for matriculation
next term.
I am, Sir, etc., yours truthfully,

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MRs. BELLoc LowNDEs, still seizing occasion as it flies,
has now followed up her success in Good Old Anna with
another War-story, called Lilla : A Part of Her Life
(HUTCHINSON). Amongst other attractions, it is notable as
presenting the first employment of Count ZEPPELIN as a
matrimonial agent. Certainly, if one of his gasbags had
not come and brooded over the train in which Lilla and
Carteret were travelling as entire strangers, they would
never have climbed out of it together and enjoyed a heart-
to-heart talk in the darkness of a midnight hayfield, or
followed up this introduction by friendship and eventual
marriage. Not that in the long run they had any real
cause for gratitude towards the frightful Count, since,
unfortunately, their union had been effected in defiance of
that great law of fiction which ordains that a husband
reported missing in the first chapter shall inevitably turn
up before the last. I am bound to add, however, that when
this happens Mrs. LowNDEs manages the resulting triangle
with great sincerity and truth. Perhaps I felt that the
national disaster that she uses (how, I need not say) to
resolve the situation was still too fresh and poignant to be
altogether suitable for such employment; but it is only
fair to admit that her handling of it is reticent and free
from melodrama. So Lilla is left free to return to
her de jure husband (though we are not told whether she
exercises the option), and for her own sake I can only
hope that the remainder of her life will be less emotionally
crowded. - -
Sclaier and Dramatist (LANE) is a volume of War-letters
whose interest depends less on their matter than on the
personality of the writer. Their sub-title is, “The Letters
of Harold Chapin, American Citizen, who died for England
at Loos on September 26th, 1915.” Prefixed to them are
two short appreciations of HARold CHAPIN; as himself by
SIDNEY DARK, and as dramatist by WILLIAM ARCHER. From
the whole one gathers an impression, at once sad and
stimulating, of a brave gentleman whom some remember as
a friend of extraordinary personal charm, and all who are
concerned with the art of the theatre regret as one from
whom they looked to see work of increasing power and
beauty. The letters themselves, almost all of them to his
wife and little son, are just what those who knew the
writer would expect—graceful and humorous notes filled
with courage and tenderness. It must, one thinks, have
asked for some sacrifice on the part of her to whom they
are chiefly addressed thus to share them with the world.
Her reward is that no one will read them without an
increased regard for one whom Mr. DARK calls “a splendid
friend because of his gift of understanding,” and Mr. ARCHER
“a spirit bounteously endowed with thought, observation,
humour, craftsmanship.” These two sayings serve as a
measure of our loss, public and private.
Mr. ARTHUR RUHL, after having seen many aspects of
the War in the exercise of his prerogative as an American
journalist, presents his preconsidered judgment in From
Antwerp to Gallipoli (ALLEN AND UNwiN), a title that
suggests the extent of his wanderings. Not that he would
have his transatlantic readers conclude that he is delivering

any verdict at all; but, having been at or near the Front
with the armies of five nations, he makes, so he would
have them believe, an impartial statement in respect of the
things he has seen. His impartiality is, in fact, so great
that he has little but praise to offer, and as most of his
experience was with the German, Austrian and Turkish
forces the bulk of his good opinion is naturally awarded to
them. The British and Russian authorities do not appear
to have offered him much hospitality, but he was in Belgium
and France long enough to be able to create, he hopes, in
his first few chapters an impression of fairness towards
our Allies that shall lend weight to his later praise of our
enemies. His vividly-written descriptive pages would
gently persuade one to the belief that, while all soldiers
are brave, this is truest perhaps of the Austrians; that,
while alrarmies are well organised, certainly the Turks are
second to none in this respect; that, whereas all countries

Mr. HERBERT, JENRINs, author and publisher of Bindle,
is also, on broad lines, a humourist. The only complaint
I have really to make against his book is its title. Bindle
might apply to anything from a Tank to a pet poodle, and I
feel that the queer old ruffian whose efforts to amuse the
world are here set forth deserved a more distinctive name.
In private life Bindle was a furniture-remover when he
was anything, but as far as we are concerned he spent most
of his time in the execution of colossal practical jokes. These
are in their way diverting enough, for if Mr. JENRINs is not
very fertile in inventing novel tortures for troublesome
people he certainly works the old ones for all they are
worth. When Bindle was bindling he never allowed his
victims a dull moment, but it was rather in his leisure
hours that I personally felt on terms of intimate friendship
with him. Then he had a most pungently humorous way
of expressing himself, and his conversations both with his

AS YOU WERE I
[LITTLE WILLIE writes to FATHER from a remote suburb of Verdun.]
FATHER, it seems but yesterday
That I was talking through my hat
Of how I loathed this wicked fray
(You know the kind of hot-air chat;
One poignant phrase—“O, what a pity!"—
Greatly impressed the New York Peace Committee).
Well, certain things have since occurred
Which make my spoof of Peace and Love
eem like the utterance of a bird
Of evil omen, not a dove;
One lets the truth at times escape,
By inadvertence, in a humorous shape.
For now, to my complete surprise,
These Frenchmen by a sudden swoop
(Father, I know you'll sympathise)
Have put your WILLIE in the soup;
It took them just a day to spoil
The fruit of months and months of steady toil.
My cannon-fodder fell like grain;
That's nothing; what I cannot stand
Is this, that I, with all my brain,
Must needs obey the foe's command,
“Huns / As you were !” and here I am
Just where I was last Spring. O, Father, !
O. S.
HoRRocks AND HéLÉNE.
SoME day, when Tommy picks up his kit and says good-
bye to France, many hearts will be the sadder, but nobody,
I think, will miss him so much as the children. Tommy,
with his mouth-organ, his cheery songs and his droll
efforts at French, has won a sure place in the affection of
France's boys and girls, and none more than Private
Horrocks, R.H.A., who is as fond of a romp with them
as he is of a hand-to-hand scrap with a brace of Huns,
which is saying a lot. Go into an estaminet any night
of the week when he is back from the line and you will
probably find him sitting at a table with a youngster on
his knee, the pair of them executing the Marseillaise with
marvellous accuracy on a massed band of two mouth-organs.
Little eight-year-old Hélène of the Coq d'Or is his prime
favourite. A never-ageing joke between the two is for
Horrocks to pick her up under his arm and inquire of her
mother in stentorian tones, “Combien pour cette enfant,
madame?” whereupon that smiling lady invariably replies,
“Cinq francs—peut-être,” which latter word, he explains to
a friend less acquainted with the language than himself,
may be roughly represented by the English “I don't think.”
Once when he was whiling away a few minutes in the
Coq d'Or a batch of German prisoners was marched by
en route for road-mending at the other end of the village.
Madame was the first to see them outside and immedi-
ately became an altered woman. Rushing to the window,
she leaned out and shook her fist at them. “Regardez,”
she cried angrily—“regardez les Boches qui passent
basle KAISER! A basles sales Boches!" Horrocks picked
up his ally and strolled to the window with her. “Oui,
regardez les 'Uns,” he said, smiling amiably, and threw
out a cigarette to an especially dejected-looking member of
the party. Madame turned on him like lightning. “Vous
Tommees étes beaucoup trop sympathiques,” she said
severely; whereupon Hélène, wishing to re-establish the
entente between them, murmured sadly, “Oh, regardez les
pauvres sales Boches!”
On Sundays, Hélène and her mother don the big black
hats and crêpe veils so beloved by the country women of
France, and go to church. At these times Horrocks re-
fuses to enter the estaminet until his hostess and her
daughter are once more dressed in their simple print again.
“Pourquoi n'allez-vous jamais à la messe?” I heard
Hélène ask him once on her return from church. “Moi,
non bon,” replied Horrocks. “Wous allez à la messe pour
vous et pour moi aussi.”
One day she fell very ill. The regimental doctor, taken
to the Coq d'Or by the almost frantic gunner, could give
small comfort. Hélène was suffering from pneumonia, said
the M.O.; it would be some time before the crisis, and he
was quite unable to say if she would recover. During the
next few days I think everyone went out of his way to be
kind to Horrocks. From the C.O. downwards they all
liked him, and they all knew of the attachment existing
between the big fellow and the little girl. And so every-
body was pleased when one afterncon the M.O. met him
in the place and said that Hélène was going to live and
that she wanted to see him. Later on I passed him groom-
ing his horse at evening stables. He was rather more red
in the face than usual and, contrary to his usual custom,
had not a word to say to anyone. After dinner that night,
on my way back from the mess I noticed that the church
windows were lit up with unwonted brilliance, and as I
passed the door an English soldier came hurriedly out.
It was Horrocks. “Whatever are you doing here?” I
asked, considerably astonished, for I well knew how loth
he always was to attend even a compulsory Church parade.
For just a moment Horrocks looked a trifle uncomfortable,
then, “In these 'ere parts, Sir," he began earnestly, “when
a bloke's got somethink to be 'appy about 'e goes and
lights a candle in the church. They all does it. I seen
Hélène done it when 'er brother come back safe from
Verdun, and she done it agin when their cow got over
the noomonia. I ain't a church-goin' cove, but I reckon
when a fellow feels as 'appy as me 'e's got to do somethink
or 'e'll bust.”
“So you've been lighting a candle in the church 2" I
ventured.
“Candle?” he said scornfully. “Three 'ole packets from
the épicerie, to say nothink of six stumps out of the
orderly-room. It's a rum way of showin' 'ow pleased a
bloke feels, ain't it, Sir? But they all does it out 'ere, and
me 'eart was that warm I 'ad to go and do the same.”
And although next day the village curé, kindly old
man, very mildly remonstrated with him I could not help
feeling that in his own particular way Private Horrocks
had done well.
Les Grands Esprits se Rencontrent.
Mr. BLATCHFord in The Sunday Chronicle:–
“Our Army at Mons, consisting of less than 80,000 men with less
than 300 guns, did hold its position and repulse with heavy losses
a German army of 187,000 men with 600 guns.
Sir John French's 80,000 contemptibles were attacked on the left by
62,000 men with 250 guns, on the right by 250,000 men with 920
guns, and in front by 250,000 men with 920 guns, besides being
exposed to attack on the right rear from another army of 250,000
men with 920 guns.
The Government and the bulk of the British people expected
that handful of British soldiers to defeat the German army of ten
millions.”
As Falstaff said:—
“Four rogues in buckram let drive at me. I made no more ado,
but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
These nine in buckram that I told thee of began to give me ground;
but I followed close, came in foot and hand; and with a thought
seven of the eleven I paid.”

| KING CoNSTANTINE’s most interesting
| departure in making up a Cabinet of
University Professors has been hailed
by those in the inner circles here as a
master-stroke. It is pointed out that
this is a war of attrition. Some of the
belligerents are already on the verge of
exhaustion in regard to men or guns or
petrol or some other necessity. Greece
alone (although not exactly a belliger-
ent—rather to be regarded perhaps as
a belligeree) is faced with a shortage
of Ministers. And now at one stroke
CoNSTANTINE has tapped a whole field
of new reserves—enough, it is hoped,
to keep the Government at full strength
(allowing for the normal rate of wastage)
for many months to come.
The thing is simply a judicious ex-
tension of the process of combing-out,

MY BIT.
WHEN William Smithers (yet to be)
Climbs lightly to his granddad's knee
And grasps my whiskers white and
oary,
Demanding to be told a story,
He'll ask me, “Grandpa, were you one
Of those who bravely fought the Hun?
And did they run away from you?
And were you frightened? Tell me, do!”
“My child,” I’ll say, “although this
chest,
In martial panoply compressed,
Yearned like the hungry tiger's for
Unmeasured gouts of German gore;
Though hour by hour I stood “on
guard ” -
Till every limb was iron hard,
And staff instructors came in cabs
To gloat upon my points and jabs,
And mark the marrow-freezing glare
With which I whistled through the air;
Though with long practice I became
An expert at the killing game,
Destined to wade, or so they said,
Through driven heaps of German dead,
And, briefly, see the Big Push through
With private deeds of derring-do;
I never, strange enough to say,
Was present at the actual fray.”
“Not fight?” the captious child will
pout ; -
“Why, what can you have been about?”
And I shall have my answer pat:
“Dividing first from third class fat;
Presiding at the clothing store
And scrubbing down the washhouse
floor;
Watching a thousand rations drawn
And mowing on the Colonel's lawn.
I was the man who baked and boiled
And kept the charger-loaders oiled,
Who swept the roads and sold the
stamps
And lit the fires and cleaned the
lamps,
Who taught the new recruits to drill
And drove to market with the swill,
Tended the sick, removed the dead
And made the Sergeant-Major's bed.
Who kept the Quartermaster's books
And combed the whiskers of the cooks?
Who typed the Colonel's businessletters
And fed the Major's Gordon setters?
Who drove the transport to the trains
And sprinkled Condy in the drains?
Who paid T. A. his toll of bobs
And did a thousand other jobs,
All necessary, as you know,
To keep an army on the go?
'Twas I, my child, and though a zest
For wholesaleslaughter filled my breast,
Though I was ripe with fire and sword
To decimate the Prussian horde,
And do the coarse Bavarian in
By thrusting bayonets through his skin,
And plaster many a well-timed biff
Upon the Saxon's midmost riff,
They said that I was much too old
And bade me do as I was told.
And, when there came an end of strife,
And I retired to private life,
Unknown to fame I passed among
The cohorts of the Great Unsung,
Well pleased that I had done my bit
And thankful for the end of it.”
CONRAD.
Conrad, musician, has for the last
several months lived just opposite me
—about two hundred and fifty yards
away, I generally reckon, but what
with one thing and another I have
never actually stepped the distance.
The road between us is very rough and
unfinished, full of holes, and the traffic
cn it is almost exclusively confined to
the night hours. It is at night, too,
that Conrad generally plays. For the
truth is—I'm afraid you must have
guessed it—that the road we live on
is called “No Man's Land.” Yes,
Conrad is a German, and the instru-
ment on which he plays a machine-gun.
Ours is a very musical street at
nights, but Conrad's touch is unmis-
takable. His repertoire may be small
but his technique is masterly. True, I
remember a rather breathless, shaken
sentry suggesting, as he picked himself
up, that the Master's methods were
stereotyped; but even then there was
more admiration than criticism in his
tone.
It is rare, however, to find a sentry
so detached in his attitude as to permit
of an academic appreciation of Conrad.
Sentries, you see, have to look over the
top at night, and the top of our own
particular little bit of parapet is Conrad's
especial care. During the day, from
his snug emplacement somewhere (but
where, exactly 2) in France, he trains
his gun on to the top of our parapet,
along a length of two or three hundred
yards. As soon as darkness falls and
the sentries are up, Conrad begins. He
fires a little burst of fifteen shots or so,
traversing—that is to say, sweeping—
as he fires, and
“Di-da-da-da-DAP.”
There ! That was Conrad How
do I know? Well, it is not easy to
say, but we are all willing to stake our
shirts on our ability to pick out Conrad's
touch. And there is, of course, his
method. Stereotyped, perhaps, as the
jaded sentry said, but, after all, why
alter what is perfect 2 He does not
roam far afield—no, he is very faithful
to “B” Company. He uses but little
ammunition, seldom more than twenty
rounds at a time. He does not fire
very often—once in ten minutes, or
fifteen. Sometimes he will even lie
“doggo" for thirty or forty. Then
will come another little burst. That
one just now, for instance, started
about forty yards to our right and
came towards us. The next one
may—
“Di-da-da-da-DAP-DAP-DAP-da-
da-da.” -
There! That was Conrad again, only
this time he started a little to our left
and passed over our heads in the
middle of the cadenza, finishing up on
our right. Impossible to say when the
next burst will come, or which way it
will travel. The only certain things
are that it will not come till the fine
edge of anticipation is a little blunted,
and that the shots will be an inch
above the parapet. That is all. Now
you know Conrad's methods. You
don't think there's anything very won-
derful about them? My dear Sir, oblige
me by stepping along to the right. We
will visit “A” Company, and you shall
hear Hustling Hans pouring his unin-
terrupted stream of lead over his
favourite Bay No. 29. Or let us go to
the left, right down to “D” Company,
and listen to Wilhelm the Wasteful as
his bullets plug the parapet or fly
screaming and cracking three feet above
it. Then you will perhaps begin to
understand why the men of “B”
Company regard themselves as the
asthetes of the battalion. They are
accustomed to studying nightly with a
great artist.
It was Lance-Corporal Coventry who
first gave me an inkling of the pride
with which Conrad is regarded by the
Company. One evening this Corporal
and I were engaged on a small task
which required our presence on the
more romantic side of the parapet. We
were already as close to Mother Earth
as dignity and the work we were doing
permitted, when we were surprised by an
unusually long movement from Conrad.
Backwards and forwards he swept, dip-
dapping, dip-dapping, “doing," as the
Corporal afterwards put it, “doing the
knife-trick something beautiful” above
and around our now motionless and
prostrate forms. Presently there was
a lull. I cocked an eye at Lance-
Corporal Coventry and saw his lips
working. I heard a hoarse whisper.
“He’s a very clever man, Sir.”
But it is the early morning that I
| like, for it is then that one seems to get
nearer to Conrad the man. Things, it
may be, have quieted down a little
between two and four A.M. Conrad
is sleeping. I like to think of his
gun-team jealously contesting for the
honour of oiling and caring for the
Master's gun against the time when he
will need it again. Happy boys, hand-
servants of Art | And then, about four
o'clock, there comes, or is infused, a

feeling of alertness. It is the hour
before the dawn, the hour when every-
body attacks. (All the books are agreed
on the point, with the result that
nobody ever dares attack at this mo-
ment. However.) The desultory rifle-
fire swells to a rattle; arms are grasped;
eyes strain out into the blackness, which
is turning to a hardly less opaque grey.
And still Conrad is quiet. Yes, he has
been called, and he has gone to sleep
again. They will be calling him again
presently and he will come out—I have
pictured the scene so often l—grousing
and swearing like a spoilt favourite of
the concert-halls compelled to give an
encore at a charity matinée. Very well,
he will play just this once, but not

I introduced Conrad as a German,
As to his exact nationality there are,
of course, different schools of thought.
Some believe him to be a Prussian, but
it is so rare to find a man at once Prus-
sian and an artist that I think we may
ignore this opinion. Then there are
those who hold him Saxon. I remem-
ber sharing this view myself one June
evening when, rising heavily from the
remains of a lovingly-chosen hamper
arrived that afternoon, I waddled out
of my dug-out into the serene and silver
night. Murmuring a few lines from
the “Songs of Innocence.” I raised my
eyes to the smiling, indulgent moon.
How beautiful it was, how still ! How
petty the War ! There, almost within
a stone's-throw, were the enemy—men
like myself, armed with ugly and expen-
sive toys, beneath the same quiet sky,
thinking the same gentle thoughts.
How harmless they seemed, what good
fellows — Saxons, yes, they must be
peaceable Saxons, loving their wives
and homes and children. Only Saxons.
Miles of Saxons. The whole German
army was Saxon. And then, were we
not all brothers? I blew my nose. I
seem to remember bending down to
stroke a rat. . . . But the mass of
evidence goes to show that Conrad is
Bavarian, and thus it is we remember
him, not as a brutal close-cropped
Prussian nor as a blond phlegmatic
Saxon, but as a well, a Bavarian-
looking kind of man. You know.
For, alas! he is only a memory.
silent, and feeble élèves hold his place.
I cannot think him dead. Although I
do not wish to add to the difficulties of
our great offensive, I feel sure Conrad
has gone to the Somme. For—yes, I
must confess it—we are not on the
Somme. Of what use to feel ashamed,
to expect hourly a raid by the Metro-
politan Police and a demand for exemp-
tion papers? The fact remains that
troops such as we are still required to
hold long stretches of the line now
deservedly forgotten beside the great
battle further south. But I ask my
fellow-soldiers on the Somme—has
anybody there seen (or heard) Conrad?

Important firms—they are
not named, but easily identified
—have been accused of undue
hut in the West, and provid-
ing him with the wherewithal
for strafing the Bosch. The
firms in question, fitting on
the cap, complained that they
had not been called by the
Committee and had therefore
had no chance of putting their
side of the case. This, on
behalf of one of them, Mr.
SAMUEL RoBERTs now pro-
ceeded to do, but the UNDER
SECRETARY For MUNITIONs,
after paying a few Addisonian
compliments to the contractors
in general, stated that the
Government was now paying
only twelve shillings and six-
pence for shell bodies for which
this firm had demanded one
pound apiece. The House
seemed to think that the
proof of the pudding was in
the eating.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE very
nearly, if not quite, accom-
plished a task which before
the War would have been
deemed impossible. In the
eyes of a Member of the House of
Commons nothing is so sacred as a
Ministerial pledge given in all solem-
nity from the Front Bench. That is
why wise Ministers so seldom give
one. Mr. TENNANT, when Under Sec-
retary for War, was taken off his
guard one day last March, and pro-
mised that no man who had reached
the age of forty-one should be called
up for service “unless the age of mil-
itary service is in future extended.”
Now the War Office wants these men,
and has given them notice to join up
on the first of November.
The Government was assailed from
all sides—by the opponents of Compul-
sory Service, like Mr. S.Nowden, and
by those who are entirely in favour of it,
like Mr. G. TERRELL, but think that the
Prussian doctrine’’;
SERGEANT LLoyd GEORGE's NEW RECRUITING SONG—
“HE's FAT, FAIR AND ForTY-oxE.”
CARsoN brought the House back to
a sense of reality by sarcastically inter-
jecting, “Let us lose the War.”
The Germans, by the way, appear to
be arriving at a just conception of their
relative value. Lord NEwton to-day
informed the Peers that the enemy is
prepared to release six hundred English
civilian prisoners in return for some four
to seven thousand Germans.
Mond had the unusual and gratifying
experience of finding the whole House
with him when he urged that the
regulation permitting the posthumous
award of the Victoria Cross should be
extended to the Distinguished Service
Order and Military Cross. Mr. ForsTER
said the question was a very difficult
one (why, one wonders), but it was

The CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER declined the sug-
gestion that he should dis-
pense with all the clerks under
twenty - six years of age at
Somerset House, pleading
that the revenue had to be col-
lected. “Get women,” shouted
several Members; but the
CHANCELLOR shook his head.
If this negative nod indicated
any doubt on his part as to
Woman's gift for extracting
money, it is plain that he stops
at home on Flag-days.
The House of Commons'
printer is evidently a patriot.
A Nationalist Member who
handed in a question relating
to a munitions factory found
to his surprise that the name
of a famous town in Ireland
had been altered to that of an
equally famous river in Scot-
land. Won't the Zepps be

Two topics which appear to
have an almost equal attraction for the
peace-mongers below the Gangway are
the refusal of cocaine to non-registered
dentists, and the muzzling of the Hon.
BERTRAND RUSSELL. A suggestion
that the Government should get rid of
both troubles at one blow, by supplying
the dental artists with the anaesthetic
on condition that they undertook to
draw Mr. RUssFLL's teeth, has not up
to the present been accepted.
To the great joy of the inquisitive
section the Government proposed that
Question-time should be extended by
a quarter of an hour each day. Mr.

they were about it Ministers might in-

Thursday, October 26th.-In the bad
old days it was not infrequent for an
Irish Member to take his seat, deliver
his maiden speech and be suspended
from the service of the House, all in
one day. Captain BARNETT, the new
Member for West St. Pancras, is a bit
of a hustler, too. He has not been
thirty years in the Irish Eight, at
Wimbledon and Bisley for nothing.
To-day he fired his sighting shot on
the Westminster Range by moving the
adjournment as a protest against the
new Early Closing Order for shops. It
was a bullseye, too, for the HoME
SECRETARY, finding the general feeling
of the House against an ukase which
would prevent one from even purchas-
ing a cigar in a hotel after 7 P.M.,
consented to an hour's extension.

From “The Mustershire Herald and

“THE new volume of The Mustershire
Archaeological Society's Records is, as
usual, full of varied fare . . . But for
good Oldcastrians the most interesting
article is a minute account of the
Puttenham family, so well known in
the town for many generations, from
its earliest traceable date in the seven-
teenth century. It is remarkable for
how long the Puttenhams were content
to be merely small traders and so forth,
until quite recently the latent genius
of the blood declared itself simultane-
ously in the constructive ability of
our own millionaire ex-townsman, Sir
Jonathan Puttenham (who married a
daughter of Lord Hammerton), and in
the world-famous skill of the great
chemist, Sir Victor Puttenham, the
discoverer of the W-rays, who still has
his country home on our borders. The
simile of the oak and the acorn at once
springs to mind.”

Miss Enid Daubeney, who is staying at

MY DEAR FLUFFETY, There are wigs
on the green here, I can tell you.
Aunt Virginia is furious about a genea-
logy of the Puttenham family which
has appeared in the county's archaeo-
logical records. It goes back ever so
far, and derives our revered if some-
what stodgy and not-too-generous uncle
by marriage from one of the poorest
bunches of ancestors a knight of in-
dustry ever had. Aunt Virginia won't
see that the humbler the origin from
which you spring the greater is your
honour, and the poor man has had no
peace and the article is to be suppressed.
But since these Records are published
only for subscribers and the volume is
now out-of course nothing can be done.
Please telegraph that you can't spare
me any longer, for the meals here
are getting impossible. Not even the
peaches compensate.
Your devoted ENID.

DEAR SIR,--I wish to utter a protest

of etiquette. In the new volume of
your Records you print an article deal-
ing with the history from remote times
of the family of which I am a member,
possibly the best-known member at

the present day. The fact that that
family is of humble origin is nothing
to me. What I object to is the circum-
stance that you should publish this
material, most of which is of very
little interest to the outside world, with-
out first ascertaining my views on the
subject. I may now tell you that I
object so strongly to the publication
that I count on you to secure its with-
drawal.

DEAR MoRRIs, --It's a good volume,
take it all round. But what has given
me, in my unregeneracy, the greatest
pleasure is the article on the Putten-
hams. For years the Puttenhams here
have been putting on airs T.
and holding their noses
higher than the highest,
and it is grateful and com- a
forting (as they say of nibs) ;
to find that one of their not
too remote ancestors kept
a public-house, and another -
was a tinsmith. And I º
fancy I am not alone in my .
satisfaction.

DEAR SIR,-As pº
the most widely - known
member of the Puttenham
family at the present mo
ment, may I thank you for the generous
space which you have accorded to our
history? To what extent it will be found
readable by strangers I cannot say,
but to me it is intensely interesting,
and if you can arrange for a few dozen
reprints in paper wrappers I should be
glad to have them. I had, of course,
some knowledge of my ancestors, but I
had no idea that we were quite such a
rabble of groundlings for so long. That

ticularly delights me.

logical Records' article on the Putten-
hams. It is not that it lays emphasis
on the humble origin of that family.
That is nothing to me. But I am at the
moment engaged in a correspondence
with the Editor of the Records on the
propriety of publishing private or semi-
private records of this character with-
out first asking permission, and as he
will possibly see the advisability of
withdrawing the article in question
there should be as little reference to
it in the Press as possible.

The Rev. Stacey Morris to Sir Jonathan
Puttenham.
The Editor of The Mustershire Archaeo-
logical Society's Records begs to ac-
letter of the 15th inst. He regrets
that the publication of the Puttenham
genealogy should have so offended
Sir Jonathan, but would point out,
firstly, that it has for years been a
custom of our Records to include such
articles; secondly, that the volume
has now been delivered to all the
Society's members; thirdly, that there
are members of the Puttenham family
who do not at all share Sir Jonathan's
views; and, fourthly, that if such views
were widely held the valuable and
interesting pursuit of genealogy, of
which our President, Lord Hammer-
ton, to name no others, is so ardent
a patron, would cease to be practised.

DEAR Cousix MILDRED,--I wonder
if Sir Victor has seen the article on
knowledge Sir Jonathan Puttenham's
our family in The Archaeological Records.
I am so vexed about it, not only for
myself and all of us, but particularly
for him and you. It is not right that
a busy man working for humanity, as
he is doing, should be worried like
that. Indeed I feel so strongly about
it that I have sent in my resignation
as a member of the Society. Why
such things should be printed at all
I cannot see. It is most unfair and
unnecessary to go into such details,
nor can there be the slightest reason
for doing so, for the result is the
dullest reading. Perhaps Sir Victor
could get it stopped. Again expressing
my sympathy, - -
I am, Yours affectionately,

THE TRIALS OF TINO.
(To ELEUTHERIos VENIZELos.)
WISER far than ancient ZENO, -
And, as War-Lord and Commander,
Quite a super-ALEXANDER,
So his courtiers said, was TINo.
Germany had giv'n him schooling,
And a wife, a Royal lady
(Not a gracious Grecian Haidee)
Versed in all the arts of ruling.
France his army renovated;
And, though wedded to a Prussian,
He was by descent half-Russian–
Denmark too was implicated.
So, when War's dread trumpets sounded,
TINo by his obligations
To some half-a-dozen nations
Found his high ambitions bounded.
And there were,though somewhat faded,
Scraps of paper in existence
Pledging Greece to lend assistance
To the Serbians, if invaded.
There was, too, a Constitution
Which, to make it duly plastic,
Needed measures highly drastic
And resort to Dissolution.
So it came about that TINo,
By his fetters hampered direly,
Found that life was not entirely
Baccarat and maraschino.
Gains that promised to outweigh loss
Strengthened him in his intention
To proceed to intervention,
Only—there was VENIzELos.
This exasperating Cretan
Wrote a nasty memorandum
Quite a monstr' horrend' infandum,
And, though shunted, was unbeaten.
Premier after Premier followed,
Who, 'twixt deep sea and the devil,
Tried in vain to keep their level,
And in ignominy wallowed.
Wearied of all Coalitions,
TINo, waxing autocratic,
In his very choicest Attic
Bade farewell to politicians—
Sent for LAMBRos, who, though un-
trained
And a perfect ignoramus
In affairs, was still a famous
Archaeologist, and Hun-trained.
Heeding not his predecessors,
LAMBRos the proposal greeted,
And a Cabinet completed
Made of 'ologist professors.
O it was a wondrous gleaning
Of economists, zoologists,
Of philosophers, psychologists—
All Germanophile in leaning !

“What on earth are you hurrahing about?”
“Well,” I said, “if you don't like Hurrah I'll say Huzzay.

firmly resolved to save a considerable sum of money to-day.”
“Huzzay! How are you going to do it?”
“It's this way. You know I've got a season-ticket?”
“Yes,” she said, “I’ve heard you mention it.”
“Well then, I find I've got my money's worth out of it.”
“How do you mean?” -
“I mean,” I said, “that if I hadn't bought a season-
ticket I should to-day have spent as much money on rail-
way journeys to and from London as I spent on buying the
season-ticket. Is that clear 2"
“Crystal,” she said. -
“Then there you are,” I said. “Henceforth, whenever I
travel to London and back by train, instead of paying seven
shillings and sixpence I pay nothing at all. In other
words I save seven shillings and sixpence.”
“Yes,” she said; “but you'll save it just as much by
staying at home.” -
“No, I shan't,” I said, “for I shan't have got a railway
journey out of the Great Western for nothing.”
“Perhaps not,” she said; “but * >

seven-and-sixpence, all I can say is that you were never
more mistaken in your life. You ought to encourage me
instead of thwarting me ; but of course no woman ever did
understand political economy.”
“Oh,” she said, “have it your own way. What train are
you going by ?”
“I am going,” I said, “by the next, the 10.35, and I shall
lunch at the club.” - -
“Yes,” she said, “and have something nice and expensive
—something that costs seven-and-sixpence.”
“I shall lunch,” I said, “on cold beef and cheese.”
“No,” she said, “you'll have lobster mayonnaise.”
“What a ridiculous notion ''' -
I got off safely enough by the 10.35, but, instead of being
able to concentrate on the War news, I found myself think-
ing more and more—why, I don't know—of my luncheon.
Gradually my thoughts, if I may say so, boiled themselves
down to lobster mayonnaise, the dish that Francesca in a
heedless moment had suggested to me. After all, why
shouldn't I have it? I liked it; I hadn't been extravagant
recently; obviously lobster mayonnaise was the one dish in
the world for me.
At 12.30, filled with a great resolve, I dashed into the
club and approached the Steward.
“Have you,” I said, “a lobster mayonnaise?”
“Well, Sir," he said, “we haven't exactly got it ready.
You see, Sir, in these days members don't seem to run to
the fancy dishes. It's plain roast or boiled with most of
them. But we can make you one if you'll give us time.”
“You shall have,” I said, “all the time you can possibly

and I will have some cold tongue to follow, and some apple
tart and cream to finish up with.”
“Will one o'clock do for you, Sir?” said the Steward.
“One o'clock,” I said, “is the hour appointed by
LUCULLUs.”
“Yes, Sir,” said the Steward, “quite so.”
It was really an excellent luncheon, and the golden
memory of it was still pleasant when in due course I
got back to my home, where Francesca received me not
ungraciously.
“Hail,” she said, “my money-saving hero! I trust the
cold beef came up to your expectations.”
“Cold beef!” I said. “You're thinking of some one
else. I lunched off lobster mayonnaise.”
“You didn't. ” -
“Yes,” I said, “I did, and much enjoyed it.”
“Well, of all the senseless pieces of extravagance'
What made you do a thing like that ?” -
“You did,” I said. “It's your fault for putting it into
my head. You mentioned it first.”
“Next time you go to London,” she said, “I shall
mention a sardine and a piece of dry toast.”
“Make it two sardines,” I said, “and I'm your man.”

THE REAL ANZACs.
THERE are plenty of slouch-hatted soldiers in town,
Doughty and debonair, stalwart and brown;
Some are from Weymouth or Salisbury Plain,
Others have “pushed ” in the Western Campaign;
Call them “Overseas soldiers’’ or “Down-under" men,
Declare that each one is as daring as ten ;
Call them “Cornstalks” or “Fernleaves”—all out for
a fight— -
But don't call them Anzacs, for that isn't right.
The Anzacs—their ranks are but scanty all told—
Have a separate record illumined in gold.
Their blood on Gallipoli's ridges they poured,
Their souls with the scars of that struggle are scored ;
Not many are left, and not many are sound,
And thousands lie buried in Turkish ground.
These are the Anzacs; the others may claim
Their zeal and their spirit, but never their name.

IT is, to say the least, something of a shock for the critic
to be confronted with a new novel by CHARLEs KINGSLEY.
Yet this has just been my experience with The Tutor's Story
(SMITH, ELDER), which “LucAs MALET" lately found, in
unfinished manuscript, among her father's papers, and has
now revised and completed. The result seems to me very
delightful and quite astonishingly fresh and harmonious.
One had perhaps fallen into the way of thinking the KINGs-
LEY methcd a little heavy for modern taste, but certainly
the present book gives no support to this idea. It is a
simple dramatically told story, in which only two characters
are of great importance: young Lord Hartover, handsome
and spoilt, and the teller of the tale, a lame scholar from
Cambridge, who by his love for his very difficult pupil
eventually plucks him from the snares and plots by
which he is threatened. This and some spirited hunting-
scenes—muscular Christianity of the right KINGSLEY note
—make up the whole. It is only a deserved compliment to
say that the restorer has done her labour of love so skilfully
that no trace of joinery is apparent anywhere. To read it
may perhaps make you a little wistful for the simpler and
happier days in which it should have appeared; but that is
only another tribute to its vitality. I should be glad to think
that more of such finds were in store.
Love and Lucy (MACMILLAN) is a fantasia upon a kiss
and might well have been called Il Bacio, because Mr.
MAURICE HEWLETT loves little Italian words just like that.
Lucy has been led into matrimony by a lawyer, James
MacCartney, who looks out at life and on her through an
eye-glass. And then suddenly as she is resting before
dinner the light is turned out in her room and she is kissed
as she wants to be kissed. So James, her queer frigid
glass-eyed husband, has chosen to tell her that she is
really still loved. But—awful thought—perhaps it wasn't
James / And Mr. HEWLETT makes merry play with his
fantasy and goes on pretending for quite a long time that
we don't guess. And very capable pretence too. The
author's brilliant artificial manner has seldom been so
happily employed. A singular mastery of technique cuts
out every stroke that does not tell. The characters have
an astonishing vitality. Lucy is a darling, tame perhaps,
but adorable; boy Lancelot (her stepson) superb; ad-
venturer Urquhart, hero of the kiss, very wild and master-
ful and flamboyant. James of the eye-glass, who is stirred
by jealousy to an Indian summer warmth–well, James
isn't credible. Eye-glass defences are not so easily broken.

In Through the Serbian Campaign (HUTCHINsoN) Mr.
GoRDON GoRDON-SMITH, who as Correspondent of The New

indeed seem that in our negotiations with Bulgaria we
were outwitted by the astute M. RADosLAvoPF; but I con-
fess a wish to know both sides of the case before joining in
the author's condemnation. M. BoshkoviTCH in an excel-

that our Allies have given abundant proof of their will to warn Master Flood that the part of his adventures where

itself, and of the fortitude and endurance shown by KING -
PETER and his splendid army Mr. GoRDON-SMITH writes I suppose Mr. BASIL KING to be an American, chiefly
movingly and with graphic force. Photographs well; because the picture of American social conditions that, he
produced deal with well-chosen subjects, and an account of draws in The Side of the Angels (METHUEN) is one that
the work done by the various hospital units in fighting would be an impertinence without the authority of native-
typhus and relieving the wounded (a work carried on under
indescribable difficulties, and with a fine courage) adds
value to this frank contribution to the literature of the War.
Miss FLORA SANDEs, a good sportsman if ever there
was one, also took part in the Serbian retreat, and her
unique experiences were so thrilling that no one but a con-
tentious prig could quarrel . . ...,
with the peculiar style in N
which An English Woman-N
Sergeant in the Serbian Army
(HopDER AND SToughton) is
written. Miss SANDEs, who
had been at the Serbian hospi-
tal at Valjevo, returned after ||
a holiday to find the town
already occupied by the
Austrians, and so, though she
came to nurse, she stayed to
fight. “Lieut. Jovitch, the 3
commander, took me into his
company, and I was enrolled
on its books, and he seemed
to think I might be a corporal
pretty soon if I behaved my-
self.” After this she saw and
took her share in some very
real fighting, and, although
she lays but little stress upon - -
her own achievements, I am convinced that she earned pro-
motion not because she happened to be a woman but be-
cause she displayed qualities which would have deserved
recognition in a man. Of the courtesy of the Serbs under
circumstances which, to put it mildly, were unusual, she
expresses unqualified admiration, and her testimony is the
stronger because she knew them in days of disaster,
when the true character of men is put to the test.
In Spacious Times (HURST AND BLACKETT) is another of
those picturesque costume entertainments for which Mr.
J. HUNTLY McCARTHY has so agreeable a gift. The peculiar
spacious times here illustrated are those of QUEEN ELIZA-
BETH ; and having been told this you will perhaps not be
altogether astonished to learn that the scene is for the great
part laid in the county of Devon, or that the hero is a sea-
captain. But if the plot runs a somewhat expected course
there is at least one idea in it that I found entirely
fascinating—namely, the (literally) ship-shape house which
Master Hercules Flood built for himself to solace his
retirement to dry land. This is such a jolly motion that
I can only marvel that no novelist—to say nothing of sea-
captains—ever thought of it before. For the rest, this
Hercules is much as Elizabethan Devon is wont to model
in any detail.

born knowledge to warrant it. Certainly you could hardly
call the result enlivening. Money, the pride of it, the
marrying for it, and the hatred of those who have won in
the race for it—these are the background to every incident.
The plot is too long and closely knit for me to give it you
Briefly
it concerns the fortunes (a word
ºn you may take in two mean-
|ings) of a group of families in
a New England township,
whº starting in the dark
backward and abysm of time
with social positions that were
|fairly equal, have gradually
#|become separated as their re-
spective generations got on or
got off in the great dollar com-
petition. Thus when the spoilt
º heir of the Mastermans cast
. ºmorous eyes, upon the
daughter of old Fay, the
market gardener (whose blood
was every bit as blue as his
own), the affairled to tattle and
eventually to tragedy. But for
all its sordid atmosphere the
tale has power and a certain
distinction. Also it is only fair
- to add that the real hero and
heroine are of better stuff than their supporters in the
cast, and that the market-garden, with its glass-houses
and intensive-culture frames, supplies a setting that is at
least original. Still, it left me feeling that The Side of the
Angels was rather Cis- than Trans-Atlantic. Which of

THANKS DEFERRED.
[“Professor von Liszt, of the University of Berlin, is deeply moved."
(in the Frankfurter Zeitung) “by the 'unselfish Kultur labour' of the
German military authorities, conducted “silently and without hope of
earning gratitude.’”—The Times.]
IF, in the vulgar stress of War's distractions,
Whereby the love of beauty, gets mislaid,
We fail to recognise your noble actions,
Your bounty spread like butter with a spade;
If, while we concentrate, without a word, on
This rather urgent business of the sword,
Your virtue, pending more substantial guerdon,
Is, for the nonce, its own unique reward;
Believe us, we have hearts as warm as curry;
Not easily they cool, as you shall find;
There's no immediate warrant, then, to worry
If with our thanks we seem a bit behind.
Germania, most superb of Culture's daughters,
Can well forgo her present due of praise,
Content to cast her bread upon the waters,
And thence retrieve it after many days.
Let her allow us just a little latitude—
Our honour stands engaged ; we'll not forget—
A little grace for working off our gratitude.
And to the utmost ounce we'll pay our debt.
We'll even (this will probably surprise her)
Throw something in beyond the tallied weight;
We'll do him handsomely, your WILLIAM KAISER,
And give him compound interest to date.
O. S.
KIT CHAT.
BY THE MAJOR.
ONE of the most touching things about this War is the
way civilians have buckled to and are assisting our brave
soldiers. Tender girls manufacture high explosives re-
gardless of their complexions; seasoned topers guard
water-works with their lives; Government officials lick two
stamps where before they licked one; cinematograph com-
panies turn out cartridges; grocers make marching boots,
and so on ad infinitum.
TRENCH CoATs.
Strolling through Messrs. Wabash's well-known but-
cheries the other day I was greatly attracted by their
trench coat. The outer skin is constructed of Triple Triple
Duxbak material (rendered absolutely waterproof by patent
process). Inside this is a layer of oiled silk, rendering it
still more absolutely waterproof. Within this again is
a cuirass of toughened steel, which, though it will not
resist high-velocity rifle bullets, turns horse-pistol bullets
at four hundred yards, arrows at two hundred, and bayonet
thrusts at ten. The whole is lined with a lambs'-wool
dressing-gown which, combined with the effort entailed
in carrying the trench coat about, keeps the wearer in
a constant glow of warmth.
It is impossible to think of any garment more perfectly
suited to modern service conditions, water-proof, pistol-
proof, cold-proof. As Mr. Wabash humorously remarked
to me, “Wearing one of our trench coats every man is
his own tank.”
TRENCH HELMETs.
Messrs. Beckersniff and Co., the well-known bakers of
Watling Street, have on the market the best trench helmet
I have yet seen. It serves three purposes: it may be worn
as a helmet; it may be used as a wash-basin, or—the dome
being chastely scalloped—it may be employed in the shap-
ing of dainty jellies for the dug-out.
TRENCH Socks.
The most important part of the Infantryman is his feet;
he takes as much pride in them as an Arab does in his fiery
steed; yet the preservation of these indispensable members
has so far not been treated scientifically, the old-fashioned
wool sock, the kind that Aunty knits, being hopelessly out
of date. -
Messrs. Wimple and Walpole, the celebrated candlestick
makers of Broadacre, have been quick to spot what Mr.
Wimple, in his amusing way, calls “the Achillean Heel of
our Army,” and have hastened to fill the want.
The result is a beautiful “foot-glove" made of pliant
rhinoceros hide, dyed in the colours of the Allies and lined
with the finest camel fleece. -
It was not generally known before the War that the
camel—owing to the warm climates which it inhabits—had
a fleece, but such is the case, and the nation should con-
gratulate Messrs. Wimple and Walpole on their patriotic
acumen in securing the entire output of the Timbuctoo
shearing sheds for military needs.
“ DOMINE DIRIGE NOS.”
THE richest Corporation in the world was having a little
function. Some of the men who were helping to keep it
rich and safe were there to see. . Amongst them was a
handful of wounded men who had already paid for the
safety of that Corporation with their blood, They were
all waiting for the show, not quite knowing what to expect.
There came in the KING's Remembrancer, impressive
yet very human. He talked to the men in his master's
service, explaining that the sight they were to see had
been seen by men in the same service who had fought in
France at Crecy and Agincourt.
Then a representative of the great Corporation came
forward, and at the bidding of the Remembrancer “did
service.” He cut hazel faggots with an axe and a bill-hook,
and counted out six great horse-shoes and sixty-cne
nails. “Good service Good number 1" cried out the
Remembrancer.
The wood from the split faggots was quickly seized by
the fighting men as souvenirs; but what was to happen to
the nails and the horse-shoes?
“Let them be kept for the KING's plcasure,” decided his
Remembrancer.
Then I saw things in a dream.
A royal pursuivant came in haste straight from the
Palace. I saw each wounded man—there were only six of
them—carry off a horse-shoe. The KING's touch was in
them, and their wounds were healed as never wounds
before in the War. A great Highlander got the axe, and
with it he laid about in royal style in the Bosch trenches,
cracking skulls as if they were egg-shells. Whenever the
bill-hook was used, it cut through barbed wire as through
a band of straw. The hazel twigs helped to make palisades
which no Hun could cross, and each of the sixty-one men
who was given a nail carried it like a charm on his rifle,
and never missed his mark. “Good service!” I heard a
voice cry. “Good service! Good number 1"
More Journalistic Tact.

REWARD FOR LIFE-SAVING.
THE traffic in Piccadilly at last
thinned a little and the old gentleman,
seeing a gap, left the security of the
island, where we had been standing
together, and dashed for the further
pavement. Halfway across he slipped
and fell, just as a two-horse waggon
came rattling along. There were the
warning shouts which London can
always produce from nowhere at the
right moment; cries of alarm; a scream
or two; and then I rushed in and
literally forced the horses back on their
haunches. Something gave me super-
human strength, and I held them as
though they were kittens.
The old gentleman scrambled up and
stumbled into safety, where I joined
him ; the driver of the waggon (who
disliked interference with his steeds)
completed his last sarcasm; and the
usual crowd hemmed us in. Gradually
disentangling ourselves, we entered
a tea-shop, where the old gentleman
began to be grateful. What could
he do for me? I had saved his life
and he must mark the occasion. The
long struggle between his persistence
and my reluctance being omitted, let
it suffice that he won, and I agreed to
his whim of buying me something in
every shop in Bond Street.
I had often thought of such an ex-
perience as this, in the company of a
Croesus, as one of the summits of
human bliss. But to have it come
true !
And so with a bun at the corner
shop in Piccadilly we began.
Before going further, however, let
me say here, for the benefit of other
rewarded heroes, that the enterprise
should be carried through in stages—
serially—it should not be compressed
into one frenzied expedition. The mind
cannot adjust itself quickly enough to
retain sound taste and judgment where
there is such variety on the one
side, and on the other such a desire to
profit by the chance of a lifetime. It
is easy enough to take a hundred cigar-
ettes here and a box of chocolates
there, a couple of grouse and an invalid
chair, tickets for Chun Ling Soo and a
salmon; but when it comes to Old
Masters and the Barbizon School It
was there that I was at my wits' end
and conscious of not choosing well.
For my old gentleman, like all impul-
sive philanthropists, was easily tired,
and he had so little appreciation of art
that he could not understand a slower
decision in one shop than another.
None the less it was, for a while, a
wonderful joke. Everything was to be
sent home, and I gave the address of
my modest flat without misgiving
until a fine Sir Joshua followed hard
upon a cabinet of cigars and a gramo-
phone. Then I realised what I was in
for. It was a full-length and cost only
four thousand guineas. Saving life is
a serious matter.
“I want you to have what you
want,” the old boy said, seeing that
my eyes were on this, although I
was toying with a CoNSTABLE sketch.
“Money 's no object when one has
just been twitched from the tomb.”
Having acquired, shortly afterwards,
a silver slide for serving poached eggs
(I saw it in the window and decided
automatically), I remarked, “You !
meant only Old Bond Street, of
course 2" -
“Oh, no,” he said; “the whole
length, Old and New, both sides. Come
along !”
I followed him, entering still another
jeweller's. Already I had secured
enough rings, bangles and wrist
watches for all my friends; but there
was still auriferous trouble ahead. In
the next few minutes a gold card-case,
a ham, and a Nattier were mine.
I then became the possessor of a
garden-seat, having no garden.
My head ached. It was possible to
wish that those horses had been
stronger or I less strong.

I added to my responsibilities a clock,
a Corot, a Japanese screen, a coloured
engraving and a cup of tea.
“Come on,” said the old man, who
would have been much better in hos-
pital; “there's a puppy shop higher
up.” -
I acquired a tiny Pekinese.
By this time our errand was known,
and an increasing crowd of sightseers,
among whom, no doubt, were some
of the preceding shopkeepers, dogged
our steps. Now and then a boy would
assist me in my choice by pointing to
something in the window. The old
gentleman was beginning to repent ;
but he stuck manfully to it and would
not listen to any suggestion that we
should finish the job to-morrow.
It was now nothing to me whether I
bought Ming, a motor car, a bottle of
tonic, sealing-wax, furs, copper coffee-
pots, or brown boots. In less than
two minutes I had chosen a Chinese
rug, a barometer, and an evening gown.
I chose the gown from the window,
and the crowd howled with delight
as they saw it removed, most of them
having drawn my attention to it.
(“That's for his young lady!” a boy
said.) A little later I selected a hat
with a sweeping feather, also from a
window, another hundred cigarettes, a
melon, a dozen more socks, a heavily
Grangerised Boswell, a pork pie, and
my fourth pair of shoes. To my
intense relief I found that DoRE's
pictures were not for sale.
“Come on, come on l’’ the old
gentleman said. “We’re getting on.
The best shop of all is still waiting for
us.”
“Which is that ?” I asked.
“It's a new one,” he said, “just
opened, where they sell nothing but
live elephants.”
“Ridiculous !” I exclaimed. “Not
in Bond Street. All the animal shops
are near the Docks. Besides, they
don't specialise like that, even there.”
But it was true. Somehow or other,
somewhere between Conduit Street
and Clifford Street, a gigantic empo-
rium for elephants had sprung up all
unknown to me. There they were in
their scores, waving their trunks and
munching and waiting to be bought.
It was while I was trying to find a
white one to add to my collection that
I woke up.

LI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, The artist who
proposes later on to give trouble with
realistic pictures of WAR As IT Is will
begin with the brainworking of the
show and pass by stages to the battalion
in the line. Conceiving the office, he
will picture an Oriflux pocket lamp with
all but the working parts of it long
since departed to a better world, a
jaded French dictionary, a sketch map
of the Russian Front as it used to be in
1914, a shell case retired from business,
an apple or two, as many types of gas
helmet as the ingenuity of man has yet
been able to devise, a genuine old print
of General JoFFRE, a cigarette box con-
taining pencils, and a pencil box con-
taining cigarettes, envelopes of all sorts
and sizes prepared to go anywhere On
His Majesty's Service, a hanging fly-
paper which hopefully continues its
great offensive notwithstanding the in-
appropriateness cf the season, deal
tables suggesting school treats, a thou-
sand wants, but the never-failing pre-
sence of the only real necessity, a pipe.
Thus surrounded, we concentrate
upon the great business of defeating
the Bosch, the last and most important
step to which end is, at eventime, to
read, mark, learn, inwardly digest, sign
and lick up the letters of Pte. Baker
(the orderly) to his wife, his mother,
his sisters, his cousins, his friends, his
acquaintances and the acquaintances,
friends, cousins, sisters and mother of
his wife. This is not so formidable an
operation as you might suppose. When
you have read the first letter you know
the contents of the lot. If the obser-
vations of Private Baker appear to be
enjoying a dangerously wide publicity
you feel that they will convey little to
the enemy, since they convey nothing
to you but a general sense of bold and
cheerful inaccuracy.
This done, it only remains to have a
friendly chat with the telephone-ope-
rator on the subject of operating tele-
phones, to send out your daily greeting
to the minor formations, and to turn
your thoughts to the evening recreation.
Shall it be the advertisements in the
day before yesterday's Times, or shall
it be a little fancy-work on your blotting
pad with the red and blue pencil? For
those who prefer to get an appetite for
the evening meal by less sensational
means it is always open to go to their
billets, sit upon their beds and think.
No man can complain of the want of
things to think about, since each has
his higher authorities. The platoon
commander is exceptionally fortunate
in this respect; as objects for his
sweeping improvement schemes he
has the company, the battalion, the
brigade, the division, the corps, the
army, G.H.Q., the War Office, the
Council of the Allies, and Providence.
When he has finished amending them
all, he is in the right mood to go and
help himself to one more delicious slice
of good roast beef.
What pleasing memories that simple
dish recalls It reminds him of yes-
terday and of the day before yesterday.
It also reminds him of the day before
the day before yesterday and of all
the days before that, in one long un-
broken sequence. I wonder how many
cattle, frozen or pressed, I've eaten
since this war began. If I had to
meet them all, I cannot say whether I
should prefer them to come forward in
waves or in massed formation.
“The British Army in the Field"
has a pleasing sound about it, has it
not 2 Have you ever conceived what
the Field is 2 No? Then I will tell
you what the Field is. It is just a
field. You might have a good long
look at it and not recognise it as such,
but field it is, or was before they shaved
it and painted it brown. It constitutes
a messuage of the most eligible sort,
stable, garage, outhouses, reception
rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms com-
bined in the simplest possible taste.
When your Infantryman wants to turn
in he does not have to go trudging up
a tiresome lot of stairs. He spreads
himself luxuriously where he is and
tucks himself up in the mud. It may
seem to him that he has more than
his fair share of rain in his bed, but he
can see and hear for himself that the
supply is not yet exhausted and the
system of distribution is still efficient.
It is no affair of his, in this beneficent
form of socialism called military routine.
All the good things which Heaven and
the Hun throw at him he just takes
without a word of thanks or any offer
to pay. At all times he fills his pipe
with fresh wet tobacco, takes a mud
from his mud box, strikes a watery
light and inhales the soothing steam.
Mud, he finds, is a wonderful thing;
he can smoke it, eat it, drink it, wear
it and be it, and still there is plenty
left to play about in. -
The War has now lasted two years
and three months, and those who have
seen it through may now congratulate
themselves warmly on having drunk
upwards of a million pints of tea.
Sometimes it has been black, some-
times grey; sometimes it has been a
menacing crimson and sometimes a
deep and peaceful blue. It has tasted
of everything, from cheese to chloride
of lime—a good flavour which we shall
carry with us to the end of time. Any-
way, if you can't drink it you can eat
it, and as often as not there is milk
with it. For this last boon, however,
the cow should not take all the credit.
I doubt if she is entitled to any. I
fancy that every time the soldier at the
Front has milk in his tea the office-boy
at home has to go without his stickfast
paste. But are there now any office-
boys at home 2 I wonder. I incline
to believe that all that genius for
incidental naughtiness is now with
the B.E.F.
Let us gather round the old camp
fire and recall old memories. In other
words, let us to the incinerator and
smell at its source the one and only
smell. No doubt there was some deep
underlying cunning in the brain which
first thought of collecting all the cheap-
est and most pungent blotting-paper in
the world and leaving it to smoulder,
slowly and relentlessly, at points so
artfully chosen that never a corner of
the zone of the Armies should remain
unodorised. When peace, with all its
deprivations and defects, at length ar-
rives I propose to erect an incinerator
of my own in my back-garden. Religi-
ously throughout the year I shall accu-
mulate for it the food it loves, even if
my pigs have to starve. One day in
the year I shall have a great festival,
shall light it and keep it going the
whole twenty-four hours. This one
day in the three hundred and sixty-five
will not be wasted. It will serve to
keep me alive to the intense, if nega-
tive, pleasures of the other three hun-
dred and sixty-four.
If the glory of France really con-
sisted, as they used to tell me, in its
omelettes and coffee, I for one should
no longer remain to help defending
France. It may be that familiarity
breeds contempt ; anyhow, if it was a
mere matter of delicacies, I'd sooner
fight even for America, its canned
meats and pineapple chunks. What I
should really like to eat now would
be—but hush! you will be saying that I
think too much of my food. And no
doubt you'd be right. As says my old
and learned friend Ross, who three
years ago was shaping for no greater
a distinction than a seat on the Bench,
but has now, on his fifty-first birthday,
suddenly risen to the dizzy heights of
a full lieutenancy: “Nowadays I seem
to think in nothing but extremes. Only
two things really interest me–Europe
and my stomach. Nothing in between
matters.” Yours ever, HENRY.

Over London's topmost storey,
Lighting to the knightly fray
Pussies black and brown and gray,
Lovesick tenors young and gay,
Whiskered bassos old and hoary,
Shining from my attic room
Thou dost lure them to their doom.
How could I without thine aid
Greet their ill-timed serenade 2
How discover in the dark
If the hair-brush found its mark,
Or distinguish hits from misses
As the whistling soap-dish hisses,
Lifting like a bursting bomb
James, the next door neighbour's Tom?
Now by mailing half a kipper
Neath thy radiance I can down
(Aiming carefully at the brown
With a bootjack or a slipper)
Half the amorous cats in Town.
Now as I remove my boots
I can count the stricken brutes, |
Chalking as I pass to bed
On the wall above my head,
“Thirteen wounded, seven dead.”
I have strafed the surly Fritz
In the neighbourhood of “Wipers,”
Bombed the artless Turk to bits,
Potted his elusive snipers,
Blown his comfortable lair
Like a nest of stinging vipers.
Several hundred feet in air;
But the sport was tame, I wis,
In comparison with this,
When the bottle built for stout
Lays the chief soprano out,
And the heavy letter-weight
Drums on her astonished mate,
Ginger Bill, the bass, who falls
Uttering fearful caterwauls.

Blazing like a ruddy beacon,
Guiding through the starless night
Zeppelins that come to wreak on
Sleeping Londoners the might
Of Teutonic schrecklichkeit,
Tears bedev the pillow white
Which Ilay my blenching cheek on,
For the minion of the law,
Who in peace-time droops and
drowses,
From a point of vantage saw,
Gleaming high above the houses,
Thee, incriminating ray, -
And—there is a fine to pay.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, October 31st. — Ministers
were not in their best form to-day.
Mr. Asquith was away and his col-
leagues were perhaps depressed by
the 216 questions awaiting them. En-
couraged by the addition of a quarter-
of-an-hour to Question-time Members
have nearly doubled their output.
Lord Robert CECIL missed an oppor-
tunity in regard to Miss EMILY Hob-
House. The lady obtained a passport
to Italy on the plea of ill-health, and
thence into Germany. Lord Robert
could only protest that it was not the
fault of the Foreign Office, and that
hº should be no repetition. But
surely the proper course would be to
copy the procedure adopted in the case
of the notorious Boy-ED, to whom the
Government guilefully accorded a safe-
conduct on the ground that he was
likely to be less dangerous in Germany
than in America. Next time Miss
HobHouse wants a passport let her
have one marked “Not available for
return.”
The House was disappointed to
learn from Mr. BALFour that the Ger-
man destroyers which raided the
Channel last week escaped unscathed
from our gunfire. If any were sunk,
as the first Admiralty report indicated,
it was by running on to mines. For-
tunately for the Government, Mr.
PEMBERTON-BILLING interposed with
a suggestion that these raids were only
possible through the enemy's posses-
sion of Zeppelins. The FIRST Lord
quietly remarked that he did not think
Zeppelins would be much use on a
night which was exceptionally dark, and
in the ensuing laughter the main
question was forgotten. But there is
no truth in the report that, as a reward
for his kind assistance, Mr. BILLING is
to be appointed Flight-Commander of
Admiralty canards.
Some sixteen years ago the Govern-
ment of the day contemplated the intro-
duction of a measure for compelling
persons in trade to register their real
names. The War has revealed the
ramifications of enemy-trade in our
midst, and made the proposal much
more urgent. Yet even now the Board
of Trade has not grappled with the
matter itself, but has been content to
adopt a Bill of a wholly inadequate
kind sent down from the House of
Lords. Mr. PRETYMAN's description
of it might be summed up as “a poor
thing, not mine own,” and naturally
failed to commend the measure to
Sir Edward CARson and other critics
who wanted something with far more
“ginger” in it.

ment to explain our relations towards

of violence, Mr. McNEILL on this oc-
casion did his spiriting so gently as to
elicit a remonstrance from the fiery Mr.
LYNCH, who compared his speech to the
performance of a lady pianist. Mr.
LYNCH himself banged and thundered

AMUSEMENT.”
away in a style reminiscent of RUBIN-
STEIN at his noisiest. Lord Robert
CECIL, called upon at short notice to
execute a pas seul among the eggs of
Greece, was obviously somewhat em-
barrassed. He hotly disclaimed (with
a suspicion of a pun) the propping up of
German propaganda, paid some com-
pliments to M. VENIZELos, and declared
that wherever the majority of the Greek
population recognised him as their de
facto ruler the British Government
would recognise him too. Then with
a touch of the traditional Cecilian
hauteur he reprimanded the critics.
They might turn out the Coalition if
they liked, and the Coalition, we were
invited to believe, would welcome relief
from a task which really transcended
human powers. But until they did so
the Government must bear its own re-
sponsibility, and not be called upon to
share it with the House of Commons
or anybody else.
Wednesday, November 1st.—We are
given to understand that more men are
urgently required for the Army, but
to judge by the proceedings of some
Government Departments this must be
a mistake. Early in Question-time
Dr. MACNAMARA related at considerable
length the history of a conscientious
objector still employed by the Admiralty
at a high salary, despite the fact that
not only did he refuse to fight, but
had been prohibited by the military
authorities from remaining at Ports-
mouth.
with amazement that a junior clerk in
the office of an Irish Surveyor of Taxes
at Dundalk had been refused leave to
join the Army, and informed that if he
A little later Members heard
did so he could not have a promise of
reinstatement. “The duties are very
technical” was Mr. MACKINNoN WooD's
excuse for regarding this warlike young
Irishman as “indispensable.” Pre-
suming, I trust correctly, that the
SECRETARY of THE ADMIRALTY and the
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY are on
speaking terms, I suggest that they
might consider the possibility of turn-
ing the conscientious objector of
Portsmouth into a tax-collector at
Dundalk.
If there were a General Election
to-morrow no one would be entitled to
vote who acquired his qualification
later than 1914, and of those quali-
fied a large proportion, being in the
trenches or in distant munition-works,
would be unable to exercise the franchise,
and the election would consequently
be decided by slackers and stay-at-
homes. But when the Government
tried to meet the difficulty by intro-
ducing a Special Register Bill the
House showed little enthusiasm.
The Bill was down for Committee
to-day, but first a long list of proposed
Instructions, by which Members sought
to widen its scope, had to be disposed
of. It takes a very clever man to frame
an Instruction which will pass the
SPEAKER's scrutiny. In a pretty long

experience of Parliament I cannot re-
member half-a-dozen cases of success.
Mr. LowTHER's performance on the pre-
sent occasion might be described in the
old-fashioned phrase as “Combining
Instruction with Amusement,” so deftly
did he decapitate each carefully-nur-
tured blossom. One by one they fell
before his stroke, until he came to the
last one, by which it was proposed to
empower the Committee to enfranchise
soldiers and sailors, apart from any
other qualification. An obiter dictum
of Mr. LowTHER at an earlier stage of
the Bill had engendered hope that this
fine flower might be “left blooming
alone.” But it was not to be. With
a TARQUINIUS SUPERBUs - like gesture
Mr. LowTHER announced that he had
changed his mind, and off went its
head.
Deprived by this ruling of the oppor-
tunity of amending the measure to its
liking, the House, led by Sir EDwARD
CARson, declined to have anything more
to do with it. In vain the PRIME
MINISTER promised to give Members
a special opportunity of deciding the
larger question, and urged it meanwhile
to get on with the work before it.
“What was the use,” asked Sir John
SIMON and others, “ of considering the
machinery of registration until they
knew what sort of persons were to be
placed on the register?” Borne down
under the weight of opposition from
so many quarters Mr. AsquitH at
length agreed to “report progress"
—the quaint phrase that the House
employs to record the fact that no pro-
gress whatsoever has been made.
Thursday, November 2nd. — There
was much talk to-day of the shortage
of potatoes. Various reasons for it
were advanced by Mr. RUNCIMAN, but
it was left for Mr. Houston to provide
what is doubtless the real explanation.
“Is it not a fact,” he asked, “that
a large number of potatoes are used
to produce alcohol for the MINISTER of
MUNITIONs 2" No direct reply to this
charge was made by the Government,
but by a remarkable coincidence, to
which I trust no sinister significance
attaches, Mr. PRETYMAN immediately
afterwards brought in a Bill to amend
the Output of Beer (Restriction) Act.
Dr. Johnson once said that patriotism
was the last refuge of the scoundrel.
There are, of course, no scoundrels in
the House of Commons, but there are
one or two gentlemen whose chief con-
tribution to the task of winning the
War is to accuse the Ministers engaged
in conducting it of possessing sympa-
thies with the enemy. Their latest
victim is Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, whose
crime is that he has not discharged an
aged German Professor who has been
engaged since 1872 in cataloguing the
Persian manuscripts belonging to the
India Office. From the speeches of Sir
H. DALZIEL and Mr. HANDEL Booth I
rather gathered that this ancient dry-
as-dust must be “the hidden hand ”
we read so much about. And my
suspicions were strengthened when the
UNDER-SECRETARY FoR INDIA said that
he had never heard the old gentleman's
name before that day. Evidently the
secret of his existence is one that no-
body below the rank of a Cabinet
Minister can be trusted to share.
“It must not be forgotten that every lighted
street lamp has to be attended to individually.

SECOND SIGHT.
I SAT at one end of the garden bench,
Elizabeth at the other. We were wait-
ing to start for the station to meet the
12.55 from London.
We were ready much too soon, as
one always is for an untoward event,
and, as I pulled my watch out for the
third time in ten minutes, Elizabeth
looked at me wanly and suggested my
meeting the train alone.
“Perhaps it might make things
easier,” she said, “if you met him
alone; he has never seen me, and * x
She stopped abruptly, and with a fresh
pang I realised that my brother George,
my dear old brother, would never see
Elizabeth now, for he was coming to
us blind |
“No, not like the Bombardier and the
poor soldiers who have to walk with
crutches. Uncle George can walk if
we hold his hand, but his eyes were
hurt and he cannot see. He cannot
see at all.”
Betty was dumbfounded. “Not see
gerlaniums ? Not see Betty 2 ” she
asked incredulously. “Then,” after a
terrible pause—“then, Mummy, I can
walk him home from the station.”
For this Heaven-sent solution to our
immediate problem we were amazed
and thankful and, as Betty danced
before us on our way to the train,
courage and hope crept back to our
hearts for the first time that day.

Having satisfied herself that all were
in order and that each button fitted its
rightful button-hole, she gazed long
and thoughtfully at the face above her,
and found herself completely baffled by
the look in those still grey eyes. -
“Not a little bit can't you see?”
she coaxed at last, in a whisper. “Not
if I do that,” twinkling her tiny fingers
across his brow.
“Not a little bit,” he answered with
a patient smile. “That is—not the

and curiosity creeping into her voice.
“What then can you see?”

towards us. “Gerlaniums now

against her yellow curls, and
as she lay very still for his

Elizabeth took the watering - pot
away and wiped the little fingers care-
fully, then, in what she hoped was a
matter-of-fact voice, she reminded
Betty that Uncle George was ill; that
he had been wounded in the big War,
and that we were all going to be very
quiet and very careful of him.
Betty looked solemnly pleased. She
had been petted too often by wounded
soldiers to feel overawed by the pros-
pect of having one permanently in the
house. She saw herself handing in-
numerable plates of bread-and-butter,
at all hours of the day, to a sick soldier
who would be dressed in a blue suit
and a scarlet tie, and she was mani-
festly happy.
“But, darling,” said her mother
firmly, “I want you to listen. Uncle
George was not wounded in the arm
or the leg.”

rupted Betty, recalling her favourite of
the moment.

she would like to come and take you
home.”
“Why, that's first-rate,” answered
the dear fellow cheerfully, throwing
back his head and squaring his shoul-
ders in the old inimitable way. “Come
along, Betty,” as she took his big hand;
“tell me when we come to the ditches.
By Jove, I can smell blackberries"
I stayed behind to—well, to give
instructions to the orderly about bag-
gage, and when I caught up the three
figures by the garden gate Betty had
the situation entirely in hand. She
had reached the safe topic of clothes,
and was retailing her dislike of mackin-
toshes, “'cos they buttoned up your
legs and smelt,” and the shout of joy
from her new companion was good
to hear.
We left him in the garden with her,
and when we returned a little later she
was sitting on his knee under the old

THE FRANCHISE AT THE FRONT.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-We owe it to
our fighting men to hold a General Elec-
tion. We have justly recognised the
need for entertainment, relaxation and
distraction from the cares of war.
We provide concerts, sports, football
matches, picture-houses, newspapers,
books, mouth-organs. Are we so nig-
gardly as to refuse to provide a General
Election ? It is impossible to over-esti-
mate the happy effect of a performance
by Cabinet Ministers all down the back
of the front from the sea to the Somme.
I can well imagine that the chance of
leaving the trenches for the rear in the
lively hope of hearing a reasoned dis-
cussion of Land Values or Local Option
would prove a bright, sustaining pros- Saxon literature.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF any landsmen wish to know what is the daily round
of life of an ordinary seaman in peace and in war on one
of His Majesty's ships I can most heartily recommend
them to get and read Pincher Martin, O.D., by “Taffrail”
(CHAMBERs). I have myself read it with deep interest from
cover to cover, and in the course of my reading I have
acquired some curious and variegated knowledge. I now
know the meaning of the letters O.D. after Martin's name;
I have tracked the word “Duffos" to its etymological lair;
“Dusty Boy” is no longer a mystery to me; and, if
anyone should thwart me, I should be able to “part brass-
rags” with him in a moment in order to preserve my self-
respect. The book is admirably written, for “Taffrail” not
merely knows his subject perfectly, but he has a wonderful
power of vivid and exciting description and a humour
which is never forced and is therefore always agreeable.
The story begins in peace-time, but war breaks out soon
after Martin has joined his first ship, and he is plunged
thenceforth into one tremendous adventure after another.
He is on the pre-Dreadnought, the Belligerent, when she is
torpedoed, and, having been rescued, he is transferred to
the Mariner, a T.B.D., and in her he fights through the
battle of Jutland and is wounded. I have read nothing in
recent naval literature which is better done than the
account of this terrific battle, with all its catastrophes, its
heroisms and its triumphs. Only a genuine sailor with a
natural gift for writing could have done it. I congratulate
“Taffrail,” and most warmly commend his book to all who
love sailormen and admire the Navy.
The Girls at His Billet (HUTCHINsoN) is one of those
stories that aim at nothing beyond agreeable entertainment
and succeed excellently well in the attempt. Its pure in-
tent is all for your delight and I certainly pity any reader
who can resist its charm. Miss BERTA RUCK (or, if you
prefer it, Mrs. OLIVER ONIONs) has made the neatest little
comedy of courtships with three fascinating heroines, the
Girls of the title, and three eligible young officers to fall in love
with them. Indeed, the whole thing reminds me rather of
those jolly pages of little pictures that one used to see in
the Christmas Annuals, where almost always a trio of
swains and the same number of maidens wooed each other
through all kinds of diverting adventures. The book is really
very much like that; and from the moment that the red-
haired and freckled subaltern, Frank Lascelles, arrives with
his fellow-officers in the dreary East-Coast village called (here)
Mudflats, and himself becomes the guest of the three beauti-
ful Misses Verdeley and their nice aunt, you wouldn't believe
at what a pace the author hustles things. Three engage-

Conways have nearly everything that should make existence
agreeable. Their family has been in possession of Water-
meads for about three hundred years; their mansion is
beautiful and ancient, and they themselves, with the excep-

the nature of April's Lonely Soldier. Mr. MAIs, who wrote
he has chosen. There is a reality about the portraits of
the members of the staff which recalls Mr. Perrin and
Mr. Traill, a book, by the way, to which the author seems
greatly attached. My only quarrel with Mr. MAIs is that,
interesting as his book is, he has missed a great chance by
making April's attitude to Winchborough one of superior
aloofness. A woman introduced by magic into the interior
of the most masculine institution on earth, a public school,
should have had more absorbing things to write about than
the comparative merits as novelists of Mr. VICTOR BRIDGEs

It will, I am sure, be
welcome news to a great
circle of friends that the
clever WILLIAMson couple
have written another
motoring story. Its name,
The Lightning Conduc-
#|tress (METHUEN), plea-
santly recalls an earlier
triumph in the same
material; indeed the pre-
sent might be regarded as
a kind of sequel to the
former tale. It displays
again that blend of the
informal motoring guide
and exciting adventure
story of which C. N.
and A. M. hold the re-
cipe; so that, as before,

You
Conway son, effects a reconciliation between the family and
the rich and eccentric bachelor uncle, the Rt. Hon. Mark
Drake; and we are given to understand that the fortunes of
Watermeads, and, indeed, the house itself, will be amply
restored. I have only one complaint to make, and that is
that we are allowed to see too little of the pleasant old
cynic, Uncle Mark, who is a sort of Major Pendennis with
brains. And, by the way, Bobby and Billy, those promising
Conway boys, disappear too soon.
Used as I have become to the horrors incident upon a
world war in these past two years, I was not proof against
a shudder at learning from Mr. S. B. P. MAIs that the
Headmaster of Winchborough School was substituting
women for the male of the species on his staff. The third
schoolmistress to invade that shrine of learning was April
Treffry, who, in the intervals of her scholastic duties,
corresponded entertainingly with a lonely subaltern, one
Hugh Peters. Her letters and his replies and a deal of
matter written by various minor characters make up the
volume entitled April's Lonely Soldier (CHAPMAN AND HALL).
One of the numerous books discussed by her in her corre-
you are torn between a desire to go slow over the
delightful descriptive parts, and to hurry on towards the
sensational revelations that always seem to be impending
in the next chapter. Perhaps in the present volume the
landscape is a little too good for the intrigue. One of the
joint authors owns a wonderful gift for realizing what he
(or she) calls “the personality of places.” On the other
hand, the mystery about which the plot revolves is never
conspicuously opaque. This time the action passes in that
land flowing with petrol and prosperity, the proudly pacific
neutral, in short (as Mr. Micawber would put it), in America.
Thither come Molly Winston and her English husband, and
Patricia Moore, the heroine, and the Mystery Man who
calls himself Peter Storm, but of course really isn't. To
these, on the further side, are added a husband-hunting
widow, Patricia's easy but unreliable father, and a wicked
ex-Socialist who wants to marry her. So you see there is
plenty to keep the pota-boiling. The story is told by means |
of a series of letters—a rather needless device, which, how-
ever, the authors handle with much dexterity; though for
my own part a sense of the extreme bulkiness of these com-
munications always makes it a struggle to believe in them.

bitter malevolence against everything German. Even my
own name is not sacred to them.
Francis Joseph. Then there is Belgium too. It is true I
have not heard you suggest the restoration of Belgium. The
nearest you got to it was when you told the Americans that
your heart bled for LQuvain. But other people—the French,
for example, or the English, or even the Belgians them-
selves—might suggest this to us, and where shall we be

The Kaiser. I don't want to hear any more about Bel-
gium. I'm perfectly sick of the mere name of the place.
Never was there a more ungrateful people. Out of the
kindness of my heart I give the Belgians the opportunity
of doing some good honest work, and they refuse to stir a
finger on the ground that they must not work against the
lives of their fellow-countrymen. I give them a brand-new
University, filled with all the latest splendours of German
Kultur, and they refuse to take professorships in it or even
to study in it. If this kind of thing is to go on I shall end
by not troubling myself about Belgium at all. I shall
abandon Belgium to itself, of course keeping an army of
occupation there; and I shall have to leave off praying for
Belgium every day and endeavouring to forgive that stiff.

Had I known you were so sensitive on the matter I should

The Kaiser. Oh, do not mind me. I have long since given
up the hope that anyone will consider my feelings or even
attempt to understand them.
Francis Joseph. Let us return to this plan about Poland.
We are to set up Russian Poland as an independent kingdom
and make LEoPold of Bavaria king over it.
The Kaiser. Or my own son JoACHIM. You don't object
to that, do you ?
Francis Joseph. I can't say I'm enthusiastic about it.
It will mean perpetual enmity on the part of Russia.
The Kaiser. That's nothing to me.
Francis Joseph. I daresay not, because Austria will have
to bear the brunt of it. But you will be involved in it too,
and a time may come when it will not be so pleasant for you.

Russian Poles fight for us and thus we can get a few
hundred thousand more men into our armies.
Francis Joseph. Then Galicia, which belongs to me, is
to have—I forget what you call it.
The Kaiser. Autonomous institutions under Austria's
aegis.
Francis Joseph. And I tell you plainly I don't like these
autonomous institutions. They sound all right, but in
practice they do not work. However, have your own way
about it. - -

Poland so as to make a bigger Kingdom for the new King?

must remain Prussian to the end of time.
Francis Joseph. Very good. I say the same about MARIA
THERESA and Austria. But at least Posen might have
autonomous institutions just to balance Galicia.

and not to have their estates confiscated, and I couldn't

AUNT LUCY'S LAPSE.
THE milkman brought the rumour
on the Sunday morning. Then Susan
passed it on to Aunt Lucy. It seemed
there had been another raid during the
night, and Mill Hill had been damaged
by bombs.
Aunt Lucy's favourite married niece
lived at Mill Hill. Oh, dear! had any-
thing happened to her? Susan said
the milkman hadn't mentioned it.
“Such tales do get about,” said Aunt
Lucy, on the verge of tears, going up-
stairs to get ready for church; “very
likely it wasn't Mill Hill at all.”
“A signalman told the milkman,”
retorted Susan, “so it must be true.
Shall I get you a paper, ma'am—for
this once 2"
Aunt Lucy turned at the top of the
stairs and looked down upon her de-
generate maid with mingled sorrow and
anger. -
“Certainly not. I'm surprised at you,
Susan; you seem to forget it's Sunday.”
Susan blushed and humbly retreated
into the kitchen.
In a little while Aunt Lucy had pre-
pared herself outwardly for church.
But her mind was still full of the
rumoured Zeppelin raid at Mill Hill.
She finished buttoning up her gloves,
slipped a sixpence for the offertory
inside the palm of one of them and
took up her Prayer-Book.
Dear, what a noise that boy was
making ! He shouldn't be allowed to
disturb the Sabbath's peace in that
way !
“Sunday Trumpet ! Great Zepp
raid Sunday Trumpet !”
She looked out of her bedroom win-
dow. A man was buying a paper.
Was it at Mill Hill 2 Was it 2 The
man didn't seem greatly perturbed.
The boy was still shouting out his
papers. He left one at the white house
opposite; but they didn't go anywhere,
so it was what you might expect.
“Where at?” questioned a passer-by
of the boy.
“Buy a paper and find out,” came
the rude answer.
“Wicked little boy,” thought Aunt
Lucy. -
Another moment and he would be
out of sight, and Aunt Lucy would not
know if there had been a Zepp raid at
Mill Hill.
She opened the casement window
and put her bonnet and part of her
head outside.
* Boy! Boy!!”
The boy came running back.
“Trumpet, Miss?”
“No, no. I just wanted to know if
you'd heard rumours of a Zeppelin
raid last night?”
“Ain't I been singing it out all the
time 2 Shall I leave one 2"
Aunt Lucy waved him away.
“What did you call me for, then—
wasting my time?”
Aunt Lucy felt repentant. She had
done the boy a wrong. She fumbled
for the sixpence in her glove. Perhaps
whilst making restitution she might at
the same time hear if it was really
Mill Hill.
“Here's a little present for you.
Catch ' "
The boy took the coin with unerring
skill and spat on it for luck, too sur-
prised even to express thanks.
“Did I hear you mention Mill Hill?”
whispered Aunt Lucy, leaning out in a
guilty manner, her conscience stabbing
her terribly.
“No, Miss, that yarn’s contradicted.
It's all in here. Won't you have one?”
Aunt Lucy quickly closed the win-
dow, put a shilling in her glove and
sallied forth to confess her sins.
THE FAIRIES” NIGHT OFFENSIVE.
THEY left the moonbeam swinging free,
They left the cream-bowl brimmin',
They scared no folk with shrill “Hee-
hee!"
Nor salved the virtuous housemaid's
knee,
Nor scatted scolding women.
From wild-rose brakes, from lilied lakes,
From links whereon the harebell shakes,
From junketings on lawn and lea,
From dells and river-sources,
Packed on a pounding T.B.D.
(Specially lent by A. J. B.),
Madly across the narrow sea
Went Mab and all her forces.
Magicking submarines and mines,
They flitted to the British lines,
And through and through and all about
In hospital and billet
They sought the sleeping soldiers out;
They soothed them with a secret dram
Of waters of sweet marjoram,
Or bound a fairy fillet
Of rosemary or St. John's wort
On aching brow or bloody hurt,
And ever whispered in their ears
Sweet dreams of bitter English beers
In little pubs with crimson blind,
And mentioned girls they'd left be-
hind.
The straining soldier in the trench
Sniffed sudden the delirious drench
Of bean-flower scent, and with that
sniff
Was waſted home to his missis,
Or saw his mother sit and sew
'Twixt cabbage and potato row,
Or met his maid with kisses.
They say no wounds have done so
well -
As those which felt the fairy spell;
That on the perfect model
Laid down in Merlin's Art of War,
When Arthur gave his foes what for,
A great galumptious grimly plan
Upon that very night began
In DUGGIE HAIG his noddle.
Now the fairy bugles blew 1
Forth their sword-grass blades they
drew
Forth their bee-sting bayonets flew
Straight upon the Goths and Huns
Puff-balls poured from pith-blown guns;
Straight upon the Huns and Goths
Spurred the elves their tiger-moths;
Goblins hurled mephitic stenches;
Sylphs nipped in with newts and
slow-worms;
Will-o'-the wisps above the trenches
Dropped incendiary glow-worms;
Gnomes produced by excavations
Local seismic agitations.
Howled the Huns in wild affright,
Shot their rifles left and right;
In amongst them poured the elves,
More inhuman than themselves—
Downing every dummhopf (fathead),
Some they scatted, some they scratted,
Some they pricked and some they
kicked,
And the necks of some they cricked ;
Down their backs they shoved sharp
prickles,
Maddened them with ear-hole tickles
(Really, I should hardly say we'd
Any further scores to settle).
With the juice of Stinking May-weed,
With the wholesome Stinging-nettle,
They were rubbed until they swelled,
They were stung until they yelled.
With a fierce afflatus,
Every chapter, all the verses
Of the direst charms and curses
Mab pronounced. . . . (Hiatus.
Him who dared repeat such charms
Even before a babe in arms
'Twere the dole and dule of).
'Twill appear to England's joy,
When the next attacks deploy,
Whom the fairies would destroy
First they make a fool of.
Finely did they demoralize
The foe that threatens all they prize;
And then, an hour before sunrise,
Returning foot and horses,
Packed on a pounding T.B.D.
(Politely lent by A. J. B.),
Back to their beds in flower and
tree
Went Mab and all her forces.
“The Cairo Assize Court has tried by default
Omar Mohamed Higazi, on the charge of steal-
ing a pair of shoes the property of a worshipper
in the Husseini mosque, and sentenced him to
three years' imprisonment. The man is an

J|MMY ON NEM ESIS.
I was looking over Jimmy's report
not as a critic, but as a friend and
counsellor, and I asked him when he
expected that he would be moved up
into Form III.
Jimmy says whether you get moved
up or not depends upon the “voce vice”
examination, which is held at the end of
each term.
Jimmy doesn't think he did very well
in it.
Jimmy says he knows a lot of
answers really, but he keeps on for-
getting the questions they are the
answers to.
Answers are very funny things,
Jimmy says. One day his Form Master
gave him five marks because he re-
membered that mica, felspar and
quartz made up granite, and yet the
very same answer given the following
week to a question as to the names of
the Minor Prophets was not at all well
rewarded.
There is another answer you have to
be very careful about, Jimmy says. He
gave a boy two pen nibs for it. It is
“Change the “y” into ‘i’ and add ‘es.’”
The boy didn't tell Jimmy you had to
be careful about it, but you have to,
because there are two questions they
|try to catch you with, one about nouns
ending in ‘y and the other about
towns on the Wye, and they want a
different answer to one of them, Jimmy
says. -
Jimmy says that sometimes he is
very unlucky with his answers, and
you never can tell.
Jimmy says that his Form Master
told him that the reason he was not
| moved out of Form II. was because of
Nemesis. Jimmy says that Nemesis
has something to do with earwigs.
You see Jimmy had got two earwigs,
and he was training them very hard to
run a Marathon race along the groove
in his desk as far as the ink-well.
Jimmy says earwigs are very difficult
to train, because they keep making up
their minds to do something else, and
then you have to begin all over again.
Jimmy had removed the inkpot and
placed it in the pocket of the boy in
front of him, because it was full of ink
and he didn't want the earwigs to rush
to an inky grave in the excitement of
the contest.
One earwig was a splendid runner,
Jimmy says; it kept sprinting down
the course and showing off like any-
thing; but the other wasn't very good
its nose.
Jimmy says it was a much better
race, though, than he expected; but right
straight in the middle of it the Master
went and asked him what the Feudal
Cistern was.
Jimmy says he knew all about the
Feudal Cistern really, because they've
got one in the roof to catch the rain-
water in ; but anyone would forget if
he had got two earwigs to look after
and keep from bolting off the course.
Jimmy says the Master asked him
what he was fiddling about with, and
then it all came out about Nemesis and
not being moved into Form III.
Jones minimus told Jimmy that
Nemesis isn't about earwigs, because
you do it in Scripture lesson, and it is
the name of the prophet right at the
very beginning.
Jimmy wasn't sure if Jones minimus
was right, because another boy told him
it was the name of one of the Kings of
Egypt and they kept him in the British
Museum.
It turned out they were all wrong,
because Brown minor, who is in Form
IV., said the Kings of Egypt were
called Spinks, and that Nemesis was
the old name for the river Thames.
Jimmy says the other boy wanted to
because it kept on stopping to scratch argue with Brown minor about it, but
| Brown minor got hold of him and stuffed

and soon showed him who was right.
Now I am no schoolmaster, but I

him to a shop he knew of and regaled
him with buns, ginger beer and apples

thought something must have hap-

“Jimmy,” I said, “before to-morrow

day I asked him if he hadn't felt any

was beautiful to behold.
He pondered deeply for about a

Full fields of yellow corn;

The stars that guard the quiet night,
Pin-pricked against the blue;

Is mirrored in the dew.

Unconscious of the cost,

By all that they have lost.

Of keen and undimmed sight,

With some light-hearted jest.

No passionate regret,
No gift of sacrifice or tears
Can ever pay the debt.

THE CABINET DETERMINEs To con FIDE EveRYTHING TO THE PRESS.
Tuesday, November 7th.-Questions
were hung up for quite an appreciable
time to-day while Lord Robert CECIL
fumbled with the key of his official
despatch-box. Perhaps the incident
was taken as typical of the difficulty
which Members experience in extract-
ing information from Ministers. At
any rate complaints on this score ran
like a thread through the whole of the
subsequent proceedings.
Jealousy of the Press is no new
phenomenon in Parliamentary history.
Are not the reporters in the Gallery—
but for whose labours nine-tenths of
the Members would be unknown out-
side the limits of their constituencies—
still regarded as technically “strangers,”
not admitted to share the House's brief
devotions and liable to be turned out
altogether at a moment's notice? A
new cause of complaint has now arisen.
Ministers have taken to summoning
these newspaper-fellows to private con-
ferences, and there imparting to them
information withheld from the House
of Commons.
As one of the newspaper-fellows who
has been privileged to attend some of
these gatherings, I may say that so far
I have heard very little that might not
have been shouted from the housetops.

But I am looking forward to the time
when I shall learn who owns “The
Hidden Hand,” and why so much ten-
derness has been shown to TINo and
Miss HobHouse.
Both the PRIME MINISTER and Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE hinted to-day that if
the House insisted upon having fuller
information than at present it receives
another Secret Session might be held.
But surely one would be very little use.
Mr. OUTHwaits, for example, who is
so popular with his fellow-Members
that they howled with delight for
several minutes this afternoon when
he rose to put a question, could not
possibly find full scope for his patriotic
curiosity within the compass of a single
sitting. There should be a Secret
Session at least once a week. Indeed,
if the House were to sit permanently
with closed doors, unobserved and un-
reported, the country might be all the
better for it.
Yet, even under present conditions
Members occasionally receive valua-
ble information. It was comforting to
learn from Dr. MACNAMARA that on
the occasion of the recent Channel raid
Admiral BAcon had full authority,
without awaiting instructions from the

Mr. Houston, who put the question,
was apparently under the impression
that no gun could be fired without
Mr. BALFour's express permission,
duly minuted and wirelessed; and that
during the FIRST Lord's brief periods
of repose a notice-board was hung up
outside Dover Harbour, with the words,
“Enemy destroyers are requested to
keep away : Mr. BALFour is asleep.”
A proposal to set up a Woman-Power
Board received no countenance from *
the PRIME MINISTER, who thought it
quite unnecessary. But the suggestion
that his decision was in any way con-
nected with the fact that Mrs. PANK-
HURST was at that moment lying in
wait for the For EIGN SECRETARY in the
Outer Lobby is quite unfounded.
Wednesday, November 8th.-It ap-
pears from the newspapers that the
Americans are greatly exercised about
the tenancy of a certain White House.
If it would save our cousins any trouble
I am sure that the Commons would be
glad to let their WHITEHouse go cheap.

States at the present time, making
pacifist speeches, and representing that
he, and not his sometime chief, Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE, interprets the real
spirit of Britain, the transaction could

improper that foreigners should be

odd sequel. Mr. REDMOND's supporters

agin' the Government, and helped to

IF THE GovePNMENT TAKE over THE THEATRES FOR waR-work.
A WAY WE HAVE IN THE ARMY.
I HEARD the order for the first time
from the lips of a hardened-looking
old Troop-Sergeant-Major at the Cur-
ragh, but to the mere foot-slogger it
did not convey much.
“’ Pare to dismahnt
Muchyerorses!!!”
After which each trooper bestowed
a couple of perfunctory pats on the
neck of his horse.
Later I sought enlightenment from a
cavalry friend, and learnt from him that
the cabalistic command was intended
to represent—“Make much of your
horses!” Think of it. And yet some
people call us an unsentimental nation.
I have seen the horses of a German
battery, captured in Gallipoli, half of
them dead from exhaustion and ill-
treatment, with great gaping wounds
in their flanks and withers, caused, not
by our fire, but by goads used by their
own drivers. I have seen the horses
of some of our Allies ridden needlessly
into a bath of foam and perspiration,
their sides flaked with blood from the
spur. As for us, we “make much
of our horses.” Time and familiarity
have robbed the order of some of its
appealing significance, but it remains
the most beautiful command in use in
the Army—and it is a command.
It is somewhat harder to make much
of a mule. A mule is a self-sufficient
philosopher, with more independence
Dis-mahnt ' '
and less temperament than a horse.
Apparently oblivious of caresses, he
stands in rapt meditation, semaphoring
absently with his ears. The only other
sign of life he gives is an occasional
movement of his tail, which, shorn of
hair except at its lower end, looks ab-
surdly like an old-fashioned bell-pull. Of
course it must be understood that this
picture represents the mule at his best.
Nevertheless, in spite of his faults,
the mule gets his meed of affection.
At Suvla Bay, where the Indian Mule
Corps did such splendid work, I often
watched them, both men and mules,
with interest and curiosity. The men
were wonderfully cool and their atti-
tude in the face of death was extra-
ordinary. Many a shell plumped right
into that long line as it made its way
in single file along the ridge, and at
each explosion they laughed heartily
as at a really good joke.
mule, which had been hit by the nose-
cap of a shrapnel shell, and the callous
old fellow was sobbing bitterly. As I
approached he was trying to pour
water from his bottle down the mule's
throat; but he soon saw it was use-
less. The mule was dead.
In a dazed way he took off the pack-
saddle and harness, and, kissing the
dead animal, tottered feebly back.
“Make much of your horses—and
your mules.” -
ELECTION NOTES.
According to The Westminster
Gazette, “Mr. Hughes cast his vote
at a laundry receiving office on Sixth

or no damage was done, the washing of
dirty linen during the election being in
no way interrupted.

AT THE PLAY.
“WANITY FAIR.”
ONE advantage that the late JoHN
BUNYAN enjoyed over the present de-
lineators of Vanity Fair was that he
was not immediately concerned to de-
fend himself against the suspicion of
impropriety. Mr. ARTHUR WIMPERIs
and his collaborators found it necessary
to make great play with their Mrs.
Grundy and Chadband and the Stiggins
Brigade and a sketchily-dressed lady
rather crudely described as Innocent
Enjoyment. In the absence of counsel
on the other side the defence had things
pretty much its own way, but when it
came to illustrating what exactly
was meant by “Innocent Enjoy-
ment,” I confess that there was
certain dialogue which fell below
the standard of that ideal enter-
tainment to which “a girl of fifteen
may safely bring a soldier friend.”
One doesn't, of course, go to a
music-hall for lessons in logica
consistency; but it seemed a little
gratuitous for the defence to give
itself away for the sake of one or
two questionable passages, when
it had so much clean wit at com-
mand. For Vanity Fair has some
really excellent dialogue, and for
once (and that, is probably why
they took care not to call it a
revue) we were given an actual
review of the topics and movements
of the day—politics, the Stage, the
War, and the War's influence on
social conditions. -
Mr. A RTH U R PLAY FAIR was
quietly irresistible; and Mr. NEL-
soN KEYs (as a Killjoy, a Snotty,
a Hun, a Telephone-operator, Sir
WALTER RALEIGH, Mr. GEORGE
GROSSMITH and Miss LILY BRAY-
ToN — especially Miss LILY DRAY-
ToN) was a miracle of grotesque ver-
satility. He was even romantic as a
Beau in a very graceful pas de deur
with Mlle. REGINE FLORY. Mr. STANLEY
LoGAN, too, in his generous repertoire
had many good things to say; and Miss
MoyA MANNERING showed a nice quality
of humour as Mrs. Woolwich, wife of a
nouveau riche munitioneer.
Happily we had very little of the
patriotic sentiment which in the Halls

is apt to convey an air of hopeless ban-
ality. In the one episode in which
this motive occurred (for I assume
that the scene exclusively devoted to
the advertisement of an artist named
KIRCHNER was not intended to be
peculiarly British in its appeal) the
popular and light-hearted Miss Gwen-
DoDINE BROGDEN was not very success-
ful as an “Anzac.” Under this desig-
nation she apparently represented (with !
the smallest of singing voices) not
only all Australasians, whether or not
they have ever been near Gallipoli, but
any gallant warrior from any of our
Overseas Dominions.
The dancing was little more than
moderate, with the notable exception of
Mdlle. REGINE FLORY, who moved with
exquisite grace in the stately measure
of the Sugar Scene, and with a gay
abandon in the “Romance of a Dragon
Fly,” where she performed many feats
of acrobacy with the assistance of M.
JAN OYRA, who filled the part of an
unusually solid and muscular Grass-
hopper. As for the chorus of “Palace
Girls,” their business was largely con-

fined to the exhibition of some very
pretty colour-schemes and the perfunct-
ory waving of arms or legs in close-order
parade.
The Second Scene (with which the
play began “so as not to embarrass any
smart people who had inadvertently
arrived in time for the opening") con-
tained two excellent songs, “The Tory
and The Rad" and “The Poor Work-
ing Man”; but some of the “Musical
|Numbers” were frankly dull and the
soprano voices of the thinnest. On the
other hand the dialogue was very fresh
and piquant, and its author could well
have afforded to sacrifice the motor-joke
about "the quick and the dead" which
dates far back in the ante-bellum age.
Altogether an entertainment well
above the common, and catering (I
think that is the word) for the sense
of humour and the sense of beauty with
a very happy alternation. O. S.
DEREK.
I ALways knew that Derek was an
absolute rotter. He hadn't in the
least caught the idea of how an
Officer ought to behave. But my
sister could not see it. People are like
that sometimes with their own children.
She thought him the most wonder-
ful hero in all the world. I shall
never forget the ridiculous fuss she
made when she saw him off. She
would have gone all the way with him,
I believe, only I dissuaded her. I
pointed out that if she marched in with
him and said, “This is Derek,” it
(after Miss
would be almost certain to prejudice
the Staff against him.
Well, he was back again in less
than a month. They had kicked
him out. My sister was awfully
upset and surprised. I wasn't a
bit surprised.
“What can you expect?” I
said. “I knew they'd never stand
him, when they found he was
always making remarks like ‘Hon-
our is more to me than life,’ and
‘The voice of Duty calls and I can-
not disobey it.' When they found
that, if he wasn't drawing himself
up to his full height, his brow was
darkening or his eyes flashing, I
don't wonder they kicked him
out.” -
“At least you will admit that it
was a wonderful act of bravery that
won him his W.C.?” said my sister
indignantly.
“Yes,” I said, “but too won-
derful. When he carried seven
wounded men on his back at one
time he was overdoing it.”
We passed into the next room,
where we found Derek sitting on
the edge of the table looking
rather grubby, but otherwise the same
as he always had looked.
With a cry of rage and disappoint-
ment my sister seized him and flung
him into the fire. . .
“That's really the best thing you
could do with him,” I said complacently.
And indeed it was ; no editor of a decent
monthly magazine would have looked
twice at Derek. His full title was
“Derek Delancy, V.C.; the Darling of
the Regiment”; and he was my sister's
first (and I pray he may be her last)
contribution to the Fiction of the War.
Preferential Treatment.
“A guard of honour from the New Zealand
Imperial Force received Mr. Massey in the
Yard, where he was met by the City Lands
Committee, and conducted to the dais. Mrs.
Massey was presented with a banquet. . . .
Mr. Massey was afterwards the guest of the
Lord Mayor at lunch at the Mansion House.”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. JoHN BUCHAN, who rushed us all at such a breathless
pace up his Thirty-Nine Steps, now carries us in Green-
mantle (Hodder AND STOUGHTON) on a fairy carpet out to
Germany and down the Danube and so to Erzerum, in
company with our old friend, (now Major) Richard Hannay,
Sandy Arbuthnot, a prince of travellers and secret service
heroes, Peter Pienaar, an old Boer hunter and fighting
man, and John Scantlebury Blenkiron, a dyspeptic nootral
of Boston, Mass.-this last a creation of such gaiety and
tactful perception on the author's part that it ought to
produce an Anglo-American alliance right now. The four
are on a great quest, to find out the meaning of some
mysterious and fateful enemy move among the Mahomedan
races. I daren't spoil your pleasure by babbling of the
hustling details. It is a gallant book. Mr. BUCHAN makes
his soldiers and adventurers so confoundedly plausible that
you swallow them without any sense of the enormity of
the unlikeliness of it all. If the picture would have turned
out something widely different, had the eagle been the
artist instead of the lion, yet Mr. BUCHAN has a soldier's
tolerance for a tough enemy and real admiration when he
happens to be a sportsman. I will just say this, that it
was Peter who got through the lines to the Grand Duke's
army before Erzerum; and the noble horseman in the
turban and the emerald djibbah who rode triumphantly
into the city, to the confusion of the Turks, was the honour-
able Sandi, while the gallant Blenkiron found eupepsia
through the most gloriously improbable treatment.
Madame Prince (METHUEN) is much the kind of story
with which Mr. PETT RIDGE has already added to the
gaiety of the nation, but never more pleasantly. It is a
happy and good-humoured tale, setting forth the life of
a milliner “up Highgate village,” and her successful efforts
to bring up her not very difficult family of three girls and
a boy in the way they should go. You know what Mr.
PETT RIDGE can do with a theme like this: he makes it a
thing of constant chuckles, with just an undernote of senti-
ment discreetly sounded. All the characters live, from
Madame herself, shrewd and capable, to Richard the boy,
whose struggles in the pursuit of letters are so slightly
touched that I half suspect the author of holding them in
reserve for another book. Of the girls, certainly Phyllis
is, if not my only, my chief joy. She and her charm and
wit are all so delightful that the fact that by no possibility
could they have been the product of their environment
troubled me not an atom. And if she would not in real
life have married an amiable young baronet, amid the
felicitations of both houses—then real life is the loser. But
that, I fancy, is Mr. PETT RIDGE's little way; he disguises
his fairy-tales with such an aspect of the sternest realism
that we are tricked into believing them, and the happier
in consequence.
I expect you have already made up your mind whether
or not you like the formula to which Mrs. MARGARET
BAILLIE SAUNDERs works. As renewed in The Distaff
Dreamers (HUTCHINSON) it requires an austere and mightily
clerical hero to fall in love with a dainty and quite charm-
ing person of literary tastes. This is familiar ground to

the writer's friends and, although there is an unfortunate
attempt to take the story to the Front for a few stiff pages,
the setting in which it is placed is equally familiar. That,
of course, is mediaeval craftsmanship, WREN spires, City
ghosts and nice fusty parchments. There was an old
stump of a tower, all that was left by an encroaching
brewery of the church of St. Ursula of the Distaff, and in
this the hero and his secretary heroine used to meet,
nominally only to burrow among old records for a colla-
teral relative, but incidentally to climb into the belfry with
the pigeons, or get locked in after dark, or simply have tea
and toast over a brasier with solemn ancestors standing
round. In tracing the lost branch, which as a matter of
fact they did not want in the least, they gave themselves

cularly if you happen to know that the best of London is

other criticism to pass on Mr. BELL, except that he rather
overdoes the number of children who are under the eharge

A PAWN IN HINDENBURG'S GAME.
[The German CRowN PRINCE reflects upon a recent report that he
was to be given a command in Alsace.]
A RUMoUR ran the other day—
Sending a thrill all down my spine—
That I was being moved away
To keep a watch upon the Rhine;
With very willing zeal would I
Have taken on this softer burden,
For, to be frank, I'll not deny
That I am sick to death of Verdun.
Lord knows that I have shoved and hacked
Till I grew purple in the face,
And yet, for all my brains and tact,
I couldn't take the beastly place;
Yes, though in point of cannon-food
No one can say that I've been chary,
It stands precisely where it stood
When I began last February.
Father, of course, still shoots a lip
About the Hohenzollern stock,
Won't hear of failure in a chip
Of our superb ancestral block;
But vain is all this Potsdam talk
(That's not an oath, though I might well swear),
While HINDENBURG is free to walk
Off with my troops and plant 'em elsewhere.
The fault is his, this new War-Nob,
That I'm so wan about the gills
And hanker for a cushy job
Among the blue Alsatian hills;
With half my veterans gone to show
Old What's-his-name the way to Bukarest,
My general health has got so low
It's time that LITTLE WILLIE took a *; S.

By Our War-Cook.
TAKE any civilian story of known vintage—the episode
of the “curate's egg,” for instance. Dress all available
characters in khaki (e.g., substitute “Brigadier" for
“Bishop,” “Subaltern” for “Curate”).
Place scene of action as near to battlefield as possible,
and season with any martial terminology that you have at
command. -
Introduce phrase to convey impression of novelty (such
as “A few weeks ago,” “During the recent advance,”
“Talking of Tanks"), and serve as follows:–
“A certain Subaltern, who obtained his commission a
few weeks ago, was invited to breakfast at H.Q. (Head-
quarters) with his Brigadier, a soldier whose awe-inspiring
manner is a by-word throughout the Service.
The Subaltern was naturally very nervous throughout
the ordeal, but all went well until he had the misfortune
to be served by the batman (soldier-servant) with an egg
which was undoubtedly “na-poo” (i.e. too elderly for
consumption).
The General, noticing the troubled expression on his
junior's face as he discovered this fact, said, “I’m afraid
that egg you've got is bad, isn't it?”
“Oh no, I assure you, Sir,” said the unfortunate youth,
attempting to make the best of it; “in fact, some parts of
it are quite excellent.”
Further examples follow:—
1. During the recent fighting two privates belonging
to a certain North-Country Regiment which has lately
added considerably to its laurels met in a narrow com-
munication-trench.
“Hullo, Geordie,” said the first, “where be going?”
“Ah be going nowhere,” replied the other. “Ah be just

2. Through a little village in Flanders, situated a few
miles behind our front, there runs a little stream. Not-
withstanding the fact that but few fish have ever been seen
in it, the fishing rights are most zealously guarded, and
woe betide the luckless Tommy who is caught carrying
a rod and line in its vicinity. . . * *
One day recently, in defiance of orders, a stalwart
Kiltie was diligently flogging the water with a bent pin and
a worm, when suddenly from nowhere appeared a military
policeman.
“Hi, there!” shouted this latter. “Don’t you know the
regulations 2 ” -
“What regulations 2" queried the Highlander innocently.
“..Why, nobody's allowed to catch fish here without the
General's permission.”
“Och, awa’ wi'ye, man,” said Jock; “wha's catching fush?”

3. In one of our crack Cavalry regiments, now resting
behind the lines, eagerly awaiting the revival of the
“white arm,” there is a certain Subaltern well known
among his comrades as a wag. The following amusing
story is told of him — .
While walking one day with a brother-officer in the streets
of the town of X. (where they are at present quartered)
he espied one of the regimental cooks carrying a remark-
ably fine hare, a species of game in which the neigh-
bourhood abounds.
The Subaltern stepped across and placed himself in
front of the trooper, who at once halted and saluted.
“My man,” said the officer, fixing the cook with a
stern eye, “be good enough to inform me—is that your
own hare, or is it a wig 2"
The cook's answer is not recorded.

4. A certain Infantry Major, whom I will call A., is
noted as being somewhat of a misogynist.
A short time ago one of the officers of his battalion was
due for short leave, during which he hoped to take part in
an interesting ceremony.
Meeting the Major one day during the course of his
duties, he stopped him and said, “I say, A., I'm hoping
to get married when I go on leave. You know all about
these things—give me a little advice, like a good fellow.”
A. looked at him for a moment, and then said, “My boy,
the only advice I can give you is—don't l”
“The Labour Unions are quite aware that the plan of inclusion
is for the benefit of the Labour Exchange, and is designed to place all
the Labour Unions under the thumb of the tottering walls of that
institution.”—Shoe and Leather News.
Well, if walls have ears why not thumbs?
“The Army Order issued at the commencement of this month
directing the deletion of the words “but not the upper lip," in paragraph
1696 of the King's Regulations, will possibly come as a surprise to
the older, and as a relief to some of the younger, members of the ser-
vice. The paragraph originally read :-
The hair of the head will be kept short. The chin and under lip
will be chaird, but not ther other life whiskers, if worn, will be of
moderate length.”—Egyptian Mail. .
We are not surprised that this order was amended.

Mother.
TOBY.
IT will save trouble if I say at once
that I know nothing about horses.
This will be quite apparent to you, of
course, before I have finished, but I
don't want you to suppose that it is
not also quite apparent to me. I have
no illusions on the subject; neither, I
imagine, has Toby.
To me there are only two kinds of
horse; chestnuts, roans, bay rums—I
know nothing of all these; I can only
describe a horse simply as a nice horse
or a nasty horse. Toby is a nice horse.
Toby, of course, knows much more
about men than I do about horses, and
no doubt he describes me professionally
to his colleagues as a “flea-bitten fellow
standing about eighteen hoofs;” but
when he is not being technical I like
to think that he sums me up to him-
self as a nice man. At any rate I
don't wear spurs, and that must weigh
with a horse a good deal.
I have no real right to Toby. The
Signalling Officer's official mount is a bi-
cycle, but a bicycle in this weathe !
And there is Toby, and somebody must
ride him, and, as I point out to the other
subalterns, it would only cause jealousy
if one of them rode him, and
“ONLY ONE–FROM You R GRAND FATHER IN THE TRENCHEs.”
“Why would it create more jealousy
than if you do?” asked one of them.
“Well,” I said, “ you're the Officer
commanding platoon number * *
“Fifteen.”
“Fifteen. Now,why should the Officer
commanding the fifteenth platoon ride
a horse when the officer commanding
the nineteenth * 7
He reminded me that there were
only sixteen platoons in a battalion.
It's such a long time since I had any-
thing to do with platoons that I forget.
“All right, we'll say the sixteenth.
Why shouldn't he have a horse? Of
all the unjust Well, you see what
recriminations it would lead to. Now
I don't say I'm more valuable than a
platoon-commander or more effective
on a horse, but, at any rate, there aren't
sixteen of me. There's only one Sig-
nalling Officer, and if there is a spare
horse over * >
“What about the Bombing Officer 2"
said O.C. Platoon 15 carelessly.
I had quite forgotten the Bombing
Officer. Of course he is a specialist too.
“Yes, quite so, but if you would only
think a little,” I said, thinking hard all
the time, “you would—well, put it
this way. The range of a Mills bomb
is about fifty yards; the range of a
field telephone is several miles. Which
of us is more likely to require a horse?”
“And the Sniping Officer?” he went
on dreamily.
This annoyed me.
“You don't shoot snipe from horse-
back,” I said sharply. “You’re mixing
up shooting and hunting, my lad. And
in any case there are reasons, special
reasons, why I ride Toby—reasons of
which you know nothing.”
Here are the reasons:—
1. I think I have more claim to a
horse called Toby than has a contri-
butor to “Our Feathered Friends" or
whatever paper the Sniping Officer
writes for.
2. When I joined the Army Celia
was inconsolable. I begged her to
keep a stiff upper lip, to which she re-
plied that she could do it better if I
promised not to keep a bristly one. I
pointed out that the country wanted
bristles; and though, between ourselves,
we might regard it as a promising face
spoilt for a tradition, still discipline
was discipline. And so the bristles
came, and remained until the new
order, when they were uprooted.
Now the Colonel has only one fault
(I have been definitely promised my
second star in 1927, so he won't think

Pat (examining fare). “MAY THE DIVIL DESTHRoy THE GERMANs.”
Sub. “WELL, THEY DON'T Do You MUCH HARM, ANY way.
YoU DON'T GET NEAR ENouGH TO 'EM.”
Pat. “Do THEY NOT, THIN ? HAVE THEY Not KILT ALL THE HALF-cRow N off'cERs AND LEFT NOTHING BUT THE SHILLIN" on Es?”
I am flattering him with a purpose):
he likes moustaches. His own is ad-
mirable, and I have no wish for him
to remove it, but I think he should be
equally broad-minded about mine.
“You aren't really more beautiful
without it,” he said. “A moustache
suits you.”
“My wife doesn't think so,” I said
firmly. I had the War Office on my
side, so I could afford to be firm.
The Colonel looked at me, and then
he looked out of the window, and made
the following remarkable statement. .
“Toby,” he said gently to himself,
“doesn't like clean-shaven officers.”
This hadn't occurred to me; I let it
sink in.
“Of course,” I said at last, “one
must consider one's horse. I quite see
that.”
“With a bicycle,” he said, “it’s
different.”
And so there you have the second
reason. If the Bombing Officer rode
Toby, I should shave again to-morrow,
and then where would the Battalion
be 2 Ruined.
So Toby and I go off together. Up
till now he has been good to me. He
has bitten one Company Commander,
removed another, and led the Colonel a
three-mile chase across country after
him, so if any misunderstanding occurs
between us there will be good pre-
cedent for it. So far my only real
trouble has been once when billeting.
Billeting is delightful fun. You start
three hours in advance of the battalion,
which means that if the battalion
leaves at eight in the morning, you are
up in the fresh of the day, when the
birds are singing. You arrive at the
village and get from the Mayor or the
Town Major a list of possible host-
esses. Entering the first house (labelled
“Officers 5”) you say, “Vous avez un
lit pour un Officier ici, n'est-ce pas ?
Vive la France " " She answers, “Pas
wn lit,” and you go to the next house.
“Vous avez place pour cent hommes—
oui 2" “Non,” says she—and so on.
By-and-by the battalion arrives, and
everybody surrounds you. “Where
are my men going?” “Where is my
billet?” “Where’s ‘C’ Company's
mess?” “Have you found anything
for the Pioneers?” And then one knows
what it is to be popular. |
So the other day the Major thought
he'd come with me, just to give me an
idea how it ought to be done. I say
nothing of the result; but for reasons
connected with Toby I hope he won't
come again. For in the middle of a
narrow street crowded with lorries, he
jumped off his horse, flung (I think
that's the expression)—flung me the
reins and said, “Just wait here while I
see the Mayor a moment.”
The Major's horse I can describe
quite shortly—a nasty big black horse.
Toby I have already described as a
nice horse, but he had been knee-deep
in mud, inspecting huts, for nearly half-
an-hour, and was sick of billeting.
I need not describe two-hundred-
lorries-on-a-dark-evening to you.
And so, seeing that you know the
constituents, I must let you imagine
how they all mixed. . . .
This is a beastly war. But it has its
times; and when our own particular bit
| of the battle is over and the battalion is
marching back to rest, I doubt if, even
in England (which seems very far off),
you will find two people more con-
tented with the morning than Toby
and I, as we amble along together.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS,
LII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, In those far-
away days, when we used to fight about
such things as Education Bills and
Tariff Reform, do you remember meet-
ing a young bravo of the name of
McIver from time to time, but mostly
at election times? In that uncivilised
West Country borough, where you and
I thumped the Tory tub with such per-
sistence, you may recall his sudden
arrival from nowhere in particular, with
no excuse in particular, and how the
more active element among our sup-
porters at once loved him and made him
the willing leader of all their greatest
offensives on our behalf. He showed
himself an honest fellow, always paying
fully for all the windows he broke. He
was a rich young man and liked spend-
ing his money that way. Most of our
time was taken up in getting the local
police to look kindly upon the results
of his enthusiasm, and you will not
have forgotten how, when you and I
had got our man elected, McIver pre-
cious nearly got him burnt by way of
celebrating the event, Though he was
not the sort of right-hand man that
every tactful Candidate would choose,
never was a more ardent and sincere
believer in the Conservative cause. He
lived to down the Radicals, and it was
his great regret that he could not meet
them one by one in person. Even so,
electioneering did not entirely satisfy
his robust nature; he wanted some-
thing with loud explosions and burning
oil in it. He has found exactly what
he wanted in this War.
Rather, the War found him. Even
if England had kept out of it, he would
have gone in. As it was, the Nation and
McIver declared within about an hour
of each other. I wouldn't like to be
certain which was first. In the earli-
est moments, while others were getting
themselves used to the idea of war, he
was getting himself drilled in the arts of
it. Too keen to wait five minutes for
a commission, he went into the ranks;
and didn't jib at twelve months' delay
in getting his first stripe. The first time
I saw him out here was just before that
great event. We met and parted stealth-
ily, for I was an officer and he was
a man. I didn't see any more of him
for four or five months, strenuous and
precarious months for him. At the end
of them I fancy he was good for as
many stripes as he cared to ask for;
in fact, the powers, always keeping an
eye open for good material, determined
on their own to try him for a star.
So they had him out of the trenches
and sent him to a Cadet School.
I have read somewhere a beautifully
worded description of how they make
officers out of the ranks. The process
was depicted as a . gentle, almost a
homely one. You saw a gathering
of earnest young men sitting round
while a silvery-haired old gentleman
discoursed pleasantly of virtue and
ideals and traditions, passing round the
cigarettes from time to time. “You
must be brave, you must be unselfish ;
you must be human and just. But
above all you must be good. For as
it is by your kindness that you will
lead your men, so it is by your Christian
qualities that you will subdue the ruth-
less Hun.”
From what McIver told me it was
not quite like that. You arrive at the
School full to the brim of your own
future greatness; the first thing you
bump up against is your own despic-
able insignificance. During your course
ou have less cause to think of your
splendid future than of your miserable
past; less of coming successes than of
your one great mistake in ever having
been born. It is a hard-bitten, short-
spoken but entirely unmistakable Ser-
geant-Major, of quite the oldest and
firmest school, who tells you all about
it, and you don't loll about during the
conversation.
McIver, having for his future good
been put through it, came to the end of
his period of probation and instruction.
One day, as he was resting and recover-
ing during an easy, a message came
down along the wind to him that he
was wanted at orderly-room. He braced
himself up for some more of the worst,
and went at the double. Arrived at
the door, he stood to attention. The
Sergeant-Major looked at him in a
certain way. He stood to some more
attention. The Sergeant-Major ad-
dressed him, conveying in a few well-
chosen words what you and I could not
have made understood without the use
of a heavy axe. McIver became rigid
all over. In that condition, regarded
as miserably short of the standard, he
was admitted into the outer sanctum.
“Number 1234567 Lance-Corporal
McIver,” said the Sergeant-Major. -
“Here, Sir,” said he.
“Brrrrrrrr,” said the Sergeant-Major.
“Sir 2" said McIver.
“The Commandant wants you,” said
the Sergeant-Major.
“Yes, Sir,” said McIver.
The Sergeant-Major protested that
he had never in his whole career been
answered back in such an impertinent
manner. Moreover, why was McIver's
hair too long, his tunic too short, his
boots not properly blacked, his buttons
as unclean as his face, and everything
about him utterly improper? He was
undoubtedly a dirty scoundrel, but he
needn't look it.
himself right.
“Very good, Sir,” said McIver.
“Silence 1" shouted the Sergeant-
Major. “I don't want any of your
confounded approval.”
The refining process complete, “'Ten
—shun!” said the Sergeant-Major, very
much more in anger than in sorrow.
“Qck—mrch ”
McIver found himself in the Pre-
sence, with a sharp pain in the middle
of his back, by way of a reminder from
the Sergeant-Major. -
“Hlt ' " said the latter, and, with a
parting look of pity and contempt,
withdrew.
The Commandant, the kind gentle-
man of the picture, told him he had
his commission, wished him luck and
advised him to go round to the Officers'
Stores and get dressed for his new
part. Almost reduced to tears by such
kindness, McIver went out, and found
himself again confronting the Sergeant-
Major. - -
No sooner had the latter seen him
than there was a loud report. It was
the Sergeant - Major's heels coming
together. The whole atmosphere be-
came violently taut. It was the Ser-
geant-Major at attention, such attention
as had never before seemed possible.
There was a tense silence. It was the
Sergeant-Major waiting for the favour
of Second Lieutenant McIver's next re-
mark. McIver was too moved to speak;
he could only whisper something about
the Officers' Stores. The air became
moist with subservience. It was the
Sergeant-Major's anxiety to serve.
“May I come with you myself, Sir,
and show you the way ?” said he, as
a man hoping against hope for the last
and greatest privilege. . . .
I have a later tale to tell of McIver,
but that must wait.
Yours ever,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, November 14th. — For rea-
sons hitherto concealed the British
public has not yet been allowed to
enjoy pictures of the famous tanks,
although they have already been pub-
lished in American newspapers. “If
the Germans have seen them why can't
we ?” cried one hon. Member. The
House gathered from Mr. ForsTER's
reply that Sir Douglas HAIG would
consider this very important question,
but at the moment he was rather busy
giving a further free exhibition to the
pampered Huns.
Mr. KEATING complained of the harsh
treatment accorded to an Irish recruit
THE BATTLE OF CARDIFF.
CoLoREL CRAIG SEES THAT THE VICTOR
DOES NOT GO UNItEWARDED.
“with an imperfect knowledge of the
English language" for answering an
officer in Gaelic. As the culprit subse-
quently boasted that he had “pulled
the officer's leg” it looks as if both his
ignorance and his innocence had been
exaggerated. But Mr. DEVLIN thought
the incident required the issue of a
circular inculcating a sense of humour
in the Army. Copies might, I think,
be also presented to the Nationalist
Members—Mr. HEALY excepted.
The great battle of Cardiff was re-
enacted in the House to-day, with all
the principals specially engaged. Mr.
STANToN once more delivered his
Boanerges-like denunciation of the
Pacifists, and dared them to attack
him in his stronghold at Merthyr;
Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD again re-
butted the charge of Pro-Germanism
in a manner absolutely convincing to
himself; and the Home SECRETARY,
attacked by one side for not prohibiting
the demonstration and by the other
for not protecting the demonstrators,
adroitly combined a general defence of
the right of free speech with a par-
ticular condemnation of its employ-
ment by Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD and
his friends.
What are the precise functions of the
PAYMASTER-GENERAL, and whom, if any-
body, does he pay ? To give an exact
answer to these questions would puzzle
most students of our Constitution. But
if the Bill which Mr. HENDERson, the
present holder of the post, introduced
to-day becomes law we shall be able
to say that his function is to pay pen-
sions to the disabled soldiers to whom
the country owes so much. Not sailors,
be it noted. Sailors' pensions will still
be allocated by the Admiralty, for, as
Dr. MACNAMARA put it, “the Navy is a
little family, and the Lords Commis-
sioners are the little fathers of the
Fleet.” -
There are one or two other excep-
tions which will prevent the new Pen-
sions Board from exercising complete
“co-ordination" (a blessed word much
beloved by Ministers); and there is still
room for improvement in themachinery.
Is it really necessary to write on the

Thursday, November 16th.-It has
been said that there is no subject in
the world on which you will not find
an expert in the House of Commons.
I don't know about that, but there is
no doubt that all the Members are
experts on food. Perhaps that is why
no particular enthusiasm greeted Major
NEwMAN's suggestion that the economy
campaign should begin in the Members'
Dining-room. Mr. DILLON was so
much surprised at this proposed inva-
sion of individual rights that he
ejaculated, “Oh, my godfather " The
identity of this distinguished personage
was not revealed, but it is understood
that Mr. John REDMOND, for one, dis-
claims the honour.
The further debate on Mr. RUNCIMAN's
proposals was chiefly utilised as a
means of advertising Members' parti-
cular fads. Sir John SIMON was quite
convinced that the food shortage was
due to compulsory service. Mr. HolT
ascribed it to the mismanagement by
the Government of our mercantile
marine, and incidently remarked—
intrepid fellow !—that sailors were
much less afraid of submarines than
people who read about them in draw-
ing-rooms. -
For some time Mr. CHURCHILL has
been unaccountably silent. But now
he remembered that in the course of a
varied official career he had once been
President of the Board of Trade, and
proceeded to give a few hints to his
successor. Why had he not long ago
laid down a standard merchant-ship,
like the Ford Motor-car—no allusion,
of course, to the Oscar II.-and turned
them out by dozens? Mr. PRINGLE
gave Mr. CHURCHILL, as one might
say, “ton for ton,” reminding him that
as First Lord of the Admiralty he had
commandeered nearly all the slips
for naval construction, and had made
tremendous demands on merchant-
shipping for his overseas expeditions.
From this conflict of individual views
two conclusions emerged—first, that the
Government was at last moving on the
right lines, but ought to have started
earlier, and, secondly, that the Food-
Controller, whoever he may be, will
have a very invidious task. From

THE AGRICULTURAL CENSUS.
THERE has been a good deal of excitement in our house-
hold during the last day or two, and it has been entirely
due to a paper delivered to us by the local policeman. This
paper is of a buff colour and a foolscap size, and simply
clamours for particulars of an imaginary agricultural hold-
ing (or farm) which is supposed to belong to me. I am

ploughed (with a chair), they
harrowed (with a fire-fender), they
reaped (with the poker and the

orate harvest-home celebration of
bread - and - jam in the nursery.
This, however, though it afforded
them some relaxation, didn't help
me much to fill in the form. I had
tried to argue with the policeman
when he delivered it. “This is no
farm,” I had said. “Why leave an
‘Agricultural Census Paper (Eng-
land and Wales)” on me? I've got
no “sheep running on mountain or
hill pasturage,’ and no sows of any
kind. I ought, therefore, to have
been omitted. If it had been cab-
bages or Brussels-sprouts I might
have done something for you, but
cabbages and Brussels-sprouts are
not even mentioned. Take the .
paper away.” However, the police-
man had insisted. He knew, he
said, what his duty was. He had
to leave one of them papers on
everyone who had five acres or
more. He didn't want to disoblige
anyone if he could help it, but
he'd got to obey his orders. With
that he departed, leaving the in-

Mr. Punch ventures to appeal once more in a
cause that has always been nearest his heart the
cause of suffering children.

need of help. The economy of its management has
been commended by those who control the King
Edward's Hospital Fund, and further reduction in

unthinkable in these times when the care of the
children of our fighting men is an obligation laid
upon us all, and the health of the new generation
is more than ever of vital importance to the nation.
Mr. Punch begs his generous readers to help this
Children's Hospital that serves the needs of a very
poor district, isolated from the natural sources of
charity. Gifts of money, great or small, will be
gratefully received by The Secretary of “Punch,”

quite willing to do so, in which case
four plough-teams might be neces-

“No,” I said, “I shan't put that
down. Either it's too flippant, in
which case it’ll offend the perma-

suggestion, in which case I should
like a little more time to think
about it.”
“Have it your own way,” she
said. “Anything else?”
“Yes,” I said, “there's a lot

got a four-leaved clover in a crystal locket"and it's never

I got it I sprained my ankle at tennis.”

“No,” she said, “I never heard of them. I don't believe
they really exist.” -
“How like you! You've never heard of them, there-

“That means you don't want me any more,” she said.

THE PETULANT PoETASTER.
IN spite of education and police
Our fairy godmothers, compact of
mirth, t
Moved by the very spirit of caprice
Bestow on us all kinds of boons at
birth :
Some they design for indolence and
p3 ace ;
Others they spur to wander o'er the
earth ; -
On me, almost as soon as I could think,
They gave the deadly love of pens and
ink.
I blacked my fingers with the sable
tint
Before I reached the dignity of teens,
And made my first appearances in
print
In school and even parish magazines;
And fond relations thought they saw a
hint -
Of real genius in the Odes and Scenes
That placed me, like a versifying Horner,
In a provincial journal's Poet's Corner.
Henceforth the fatal passion of ink-
slingin
Beset me steadily from youth tillage;
Not that it meant a genuine gift of
singing
Or the authentic gadfly-bitten rage,
Nor that it ever did succeed in bringing
The satisfaction of a living wage;
It merely pleased my vanity and did
Earn now and then the “jingling ting-
ling quid.” -
But, since so few of modern poets thrive
Solely on their excursions into metre —
At least if they are anxious to arrive
At the possession of a seven-seater—
And though I feel when I am moved
to drive
The rhyming quill a pleasure vastly
Sweeter,
Whenever editorial doors were closed
To my poetical attempts, I prosed.
It didn't prove a gold or silver mine,
Or reach the splendour of a big bo-
Ilan Za. ,
But still a certain halfpenny a line
Is better than a casual bob a stanza;
And though I never could afford to
dine
Or lunch at the Hotel Extravaganza,
I managed, like some thousand other
men,
To make a modest living by my pen.
Unhappily, as strength and ſervour
flag -
And critics grow increasingly censor-
1OuS,
The chariot-wheels of poetasters drag,
Their humour grows distressingly
laborious;
ForFARD Away!
. THE REALITY.
To know you are an ineffectual wag—
Could any mental state be more in-
glorious?
Besides, when once with failure you're
infected,
Your confidence is seldom resurrected.
From verse to prose eternally to range
When nobody for either cares a but- |
ton, -
Because you offer nothing new or
strange, : -
And for new things the world is still
a glutton, -
Recalls the well-known craving for a
change -
Excited by eternal beef and mutton,
And makes me long for some new magic
medium
Some efficacious antidote to tedium.
'Tis hard a lifelong habit to forgo, -
Yet there is little virtue in surrender,
When age has evidently checked a flow
Of fancy that was always rather
slender.”
And since, as your confessions clearly
show, -
Your verse is neither witty, wise, nor
tender, . . .
O Rhymester, cease your plaintive ebul-
litions, • -
Seal up your stylograph and make mu-
mitions.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE WIDOW's MIGHT.”
I TAKE it that the authors of this
light comedy, Mr. LEONARD HUSKINSON
and Mr. CHRIstopher SANDEMAN, are
new to the difficult game of playmaking.
They may well be encouraged by their
friendly reception, and perhaps, if they
care to come and look at their amusing
show from our side of the curtain, our
side in mind and mood as well as in
body, they may pick up a hint or two.
The Widow's Might deals with the
connubial business of an oldish stock-
broker, a stupid and violent kind of ass,
preposterously jealous of the dull soldier
who is philandering with his wife. This
lady is of the kind that bores her cava-
lier to death, signs herself “love-lies-
bleeding,” and in postscripts makes as-
signations, innocent in fact but capable
of the most sinister interpretation in
Sir SAMUEL Evans's Court, especially
when several crosses are added—and
the letter is left in the blotter and stolen
from your bedroom by an unchivalrous
husband while you are in your bath,
Enter then the widow, “mellow but
not frumpish,” who saves the situation
by cutting out the Major for herself
under cover of an action for the defence
of the indiscreet one. Another married
couple, a bright little thing and a silly
ass, are the commère and compère
of this little revue; while a Balham
Jewess in the crystal-gazing business
(dropping over the edge of comedy
into extravaganza) wanders in and out
of the picture.
On which I note that three asses is
too large a dose for one play. The
only man with a vestige of a brain was
the widow's manservant. And next I
would implore the authors to observe
what a difficult, indeed impossible, task
they set their players by mixing the
credible people, like Lady Deborah and
the Major, and the amusing silly ass
and his wife, and the improbable but
amusing Mabel of the postscript, with
the frankly impossible stockbroker and
soothsayer. They will also see that a
joke about the dampness of water
(which was made by ADAM to Eve in
the days of her innocence, and repeated
by her to the Serpent in the small-talk
stages of their acquaintance) has lost
its freshness.
That said, and in the friendliest
mood, bouquets may now be handed.
There were plenty of really humorous
lines. The general idea was sound,
and certainly a ripple of spontaneous
laughter, the sincerest of all tributes,
punctuated the performance.
Miss ELLIS JEFFREYs, as the widow,
was dealt a really good hand by the
authors, and she played it very skilfully.
There was nothing crude in Lady De-
borah's method. She wouldn't neces-
sarily, but she might if you pressed her
—I take it that was the idea. I some-
times wonder what would happen if
this experienced and charming actress
had a part in which that delightful
silvery laughter of hers was barred.
But why go into this? - It never will
be the case.
Miss ATHENE SEYLER depends for
her success less than most of our act-
resses on her mannerisms. There is
an admirable variety in her character-
isations, and she can make the supreme
sacrifice on the altar of Art—can make
herself as plain as plain when, as
in this “love-lies-bleeding” instance,

it helps the play. I shouldn't dare to
say such a thing if I didn't think that
she looked as charming as anybody

can't be blamed for overdoing her necro-
manceress. The author had done that
already. And I didn't see how she
could have dealt with it better. Her
Hebrew Cockney was a delight. Miss
MARIE HEMINGWAY was, as always,
pretty and agreeable. Her part de-
manded little else. Mr. GoRDoN Ash
cleverly made a pleasant ass of him-
self, and I liked Mr. STUTFIELD's quiet
awkward Major. A nut behind me
assured his friends that the Major's
clothes were not really quite the latest
thing, and, as this is most frightfully
important, I hand on the tip to him.

leave them to certain destruction—well, what possible
embroidery of words can be of use for this? There will be
bright eyes and tight lips over that story; and for the
heroes of it their only adequate reward, deep down in many
generous young hearts. A most timely book.
In William by the Grace of God (METHUEN), that capable
romancer, Miss MARJoRIE Bowen, gives us a study of the
great WILLIAM who wrested the independence of the Nether-
lands from that prince of fanatics, PHILIP II. of Spain. As
to how closely she has followed her documents she is frankly
a better judge than I. It seems to me that her fidelity to
the letter has a little cramped her flamboyant spirit, which
is as great a proof of general honesty as could well be given.
Her William is a portrait of such a kind that it is not
ridiculous to call him a great man. The subsidiary love epi-
sodes are pleasantly done. Miss Bowen creates a plausible
atmosphere of battle and intrigue, save that perhaps the
manoeuvres of her princes, cardinals and Jesuits in the
matter of removing enemies are a little crude. By the
way, Jesuits never had a habit of furnishing their rooms
with tables of ebony and - -
malachite, nor are they tº
governed by “regents." ||
It's worth while getting
the local colour right,
however unconquerable
one's prejudices may
be. Miss Bowen gives
the impression of being
steeped in her subject,
but I can't sufficiently
admire her impenitently
modern habit of splitting
any stray infinitive at
sight without quarter.

panied by a Whiff and a Sound and two pairs of eyes, one
very sweet and the other very cruel. Two of the eyes were
the eyes of Lettice; the other two, blue and cruel, of Tony,
a philandering naturalist who came between the lovers, as,
many centuries ago in Egypt, a blue-eyed Theban General,
married to a former incarnation of Lettice, came between
his wife and her Syrian slave who couldn't keep his place.
Lettice also had her visions of a river of floating faces
which she apparently was destined to fish out of danger.
It seems all very confused, and the author when in difficulty
is always riding off on his three steeds, Somehow, Some-
what and Somewhere . . . What I do feel is that Mr.
BLAckwood needs as a mental discipline to write a straight-
forward story without pseudo-psychic manifestations and
keep it in one century—ours for choice.

assed General, but when a middle-aged man, with ample
experience both of India and matrimony, marries an under-
bred woman, I cannot help thinking that he is asking for
trouble and deserves to have his request granted. Mrs.
Bruce eventually decided to attach herself to a young cavalry
officer called Lord Marling, and freely discussed arrange-
ments for the flitting. There was indeed no situation
under heaven that she was not prepared to discuss, but
she amazed me—hardened though I was by now against
her garrulity—when she chose to discuss her future plans
with the General himself. This, for all I know, may be
the right way of embarking upon such adventures, but
here it was not a success. The General contrived to per-
suade her that a flight with Marling would end in disaster,
and so she is left as wife to a man who quite obviously
did not want her. It is fair to add that the dialogue is
natural and often amusing, and that the children are
- sympathetically treated.

“IT IS THE CAUSE.”
I Took a flat in Whitehall Land
Whence I could watch with native
ride
The bridge of Charing Cross that
spanned,
A thing of grace, the admiring tide;
Commanding also, from its rear,
The effigy of BARTLE FRERE.
And when above the trammy marge
My open casement wooed the breeze
And faint from many a seaward barge
Floated the gay and ribald wheeze,
Something—I can't say clearly what—
Recalled The Lady of Shalott.
Fair was the prospect (few, I ween,
So smile upon a Cockney's gaze),
And best at evening when the scene
Included Phoebus' final rays
Reflected in the wharves that flank
The mud upon the Surrey bank.
And now on my astonied eyes,
And flush with my protesting nose,
Behold a sudden street arise
Of Governmental bungalows,
Like to the gourd that in a night
Rose on the prophet's staggered sight.
Here, posted by the humorous Powers,
Masses of Transport Service scribes
Will dream away the laggard hours
And interchange familiar gibes,
Being paid—with my War-taxes, too—
To sit and block my river view.
With miles of local golfing links
And wastes of park in which to herd
The Great Uncombed, the flapper minx,
Official cussedness preferred
To waive all eligible sites
And intercopt my Ancient Lights.
But do I murmur 2 No, not I.
A sense of Transport in the air
Uplifts my patriot soul—I fly
To seek a less congested lair,
Proud of the Cause, and greatly cheered
To have my scenery commandeered.

l'd brought off the double event
three times before. Once I just stepped
over the frontier, remembered a press-
ing engagement in Sunnyville, Ohio,
and stepped back. Next time I'd put
in about five seconds in Hunland when
I got a hurry call to go to China to
see a man about a dog. And on the
third occasion I stayed nearly half-a-
minute, by which time I'd found the
local lager unpalatable. So I quit.
Then the Duke of Ludgate Circus
asked me to make a fourth sally to
study the flora and fauna.
“Duke,” said I, “these three trips
have made me a marked man. It 's a
tough proposition.”
Whereupon the Duke just handed
me a blank cheque, a loaf of standard
bread, and told me to get a move on.
Previously I had got into Germany
from , by way of , crossing
the frontier at , and recrossing it
at This time I was taking no
risks.
I booked a passage to San Francisco,
burnt the tickets, and booked to Shang-
hai. Arrived at Shanghai, I disguised
myself as a Mandarin of the Second
Class, took out a Chinese passport,
and sailed for Valparaiso. Next I
travelled up and down North and
South America, collecting passports,
letters of introduction and impenetrable
disguises. Finally I got into the Arctic
Circle, where I shipped in a whaler
for Leith. From Leith I walked
to Manchester, cycled to Potter's
Bar, and drove in a four-wheeler
into London. Here I lay perdu for
three days. . On the fourth I made a
dash for the nearest Underground
station and travelled continuously for
six hours over the entire system. At
times I crawled stealthily through sub-
ways, hid behind automatic machines,
or lurked in lifts. Late one night I
slipped down to the Embankment and
swam backwards and forwards across
the Thames for two hours, afterwards
taking train to Liverpool, whence I
sailed for New York. Here I stayed a
week, changing my residence and dis-
guise every three hours. Then I booked
a passage to Naples, boarded a tramp
bound for Holland, transhipped in
mid-ocean to a sailing vessel, landed
at º, and two nights later was on
the German frontier at
I had chosen the loneliest spot on
the whole boundary. It was so lonely
that you could pretty near hear your-
self think. For some hours I lay flat
on my stomach, peering through my
telescope, spectroscope, microscope,
periscope and kaleidoscope. I also
sounded myself with my stethoscope.
I saw and heard nothing. There was
as a matter of fact absolutely nothing
to see, for it was one of those nights
on which old Count ZEPP had not only
painted out the moon, but had also
pulled down the safety curtain over
the Milky Way.
I decided to dig myselſ in. Although
no sound broke that awful silence, I
knew that less than two hundred miles
away guns were roaring, shells burst-
ing, bullets flying. In that utter quiet,
where reither bird sang nor commis-
sionaire whistled for taxi-cab, I could
truly sense the meaning of war. All
that night I spent in making a dug-
out, in which I lay doggo throughout
the following day.
When dark fell I arrayed myself in
the costume of a peasant of the
Bolivian Andes, and swallowed a hunk
of my standard loaf. Then, carrying
a Japanese passport, a Mexican regis-
tration card and a Peruvian birth
certificate in one hand and the remains
of the standard loaf in the other—
this last alone, I felt certain, would
ensure me a warm welcome—I took
the great step. And even as I crawled
across the frontier I made my first
amazing discovery.
The whitewashed boundary line was
scarcely visible! -
I shook from head to foot with
excitement. A shortage of whitewash
in Germany Proof positive before
my eyes! Here was news for the
Duke '
After shaking with excitement for
a considerable time I resumed my
advance. Suddenly a dark mass loomed
up before me. Seizing my penknife, I
began to dig myself in, swiftly and
silently. Then a light gleamed through
the darkness and 1 saw before me a
small building.
In that building I was to find a man
whose knowledge of Germany, could it
be published throughout the Father-
land, would shake the nails out of
HINDENBURG's statue.

WARS OF THE PAST.
(As recorded in the Press of the period.)
I.
From “The Mycenaean Mirror.”
ON the ninth anniversary of the de-
claration of war we have received the
following special messages from the
chief leaders of the Allies:—
The Commander-in-Chief.
G.H.Q., Plain of Troy.
In response to your invitation to
send a message to your readers on this
the ninth anniversary of our declaration
of a just war, I write the following:—
The various Expeditionary Forces
and Punitive Expeditions, now enjoying
to the full the benefits of complete co-
ordination and co-operation, are more
than ever determined to push on to
that complete and final victory which
alone can vindicate the public law of
Hellas and the sanctity of marriage
treaties. (Signed) AGAMEMNON.
General Menelaus (G.O.C. the Spartan
Punitive Erpedition).
There is no surer sign of the ascend-
ancy which our arms have now obtained
than the internal dissensions which
begin to manifest themselves among
the enemy. Already there is a strong
anti-annexationist party in Troy, led by
the Chancellor, Antenor, who, forsee-
ing the fatal consequences of their act
of brigandage, advocates the offer of
peace on terms which comprise the
surrender of what they perceive they
will be unable to hold. Even the an-
nexationist party and the leader of the
annexationists, that firebrand Prince
Paris himself, are willing to offer con-
cessions of some sort. But I possess
the renewed assurance of the Allies
that they will be satisfied with nothing
less than the final overthrow of the
military and amatory power of Troy.
General Ulysses (Chief of Staff).
The skill and ingenuity which the
allied scheme of attacks displays is our
best guarantee for final victory. And
the enemy will find to his cost that we
have new weapons and new methods
of attack up our sleeve, of which—as
your correspondent would say—I may
at present tell you nothing. Mean-
while keep the home fires burning.
Ven. and Very Rev. Calchas (chaplain.
General to the Forces).
Notwithstanding the impious as-
sumptions of Divine patronage which
our enemies make, we are steadfastly
convinced that (at least) the majority
of the gods are with us in our just
quarrel. Chronos, at any rate, is on
the side of the Allies. “The boys" are
wonderful. -
Colonel Achilles (late of the War
Council).
As I am no longer associated with
the conduct of the campaign, I can
only express my opinion that the
present condition of affairs is deplor-
able and is going from bad to worse.
With regard to my own past policy I
would say that my critics are well
aware that the full tale cannot now be
told; but history will vindicate me....
From “The Mycenaean Mirror” (adver-
tisement columns):—
“NINE CHAPTERS OF THE WAR.”
Whatever your opinion of Colonel
Achilles' policy (which, however, has
just been warmly defended in our
pages by Lord Patroclus), there is no
doubt about his fascinating personality.
Whether you agree or disagree with
him, he commands your attention. The
above series of articles written (in his
tent) by this brilliant man, who appears
invulnerable to every attack which is
made upon him, includes the inner
history of the Briseis scandal and a
complete exposition of the Iphigenian
affair, rumours of which have so long
shocked the public. They commence
in next week's
MYCENAE PICTORIAL.
Order it at your nearest agora.
THE RIBBON.
UPoN fine mornings it is my habit
to walk at my elderly leisurely pace
upon a certain pathway in Kensington
Gardens.
Among the few frequenters of this
pleasant spot is Marjory, who is five
years old and my very good friend.
She is wonderfully patient when my
imagination fails to follow hers in all
its flights. She holds, I think, that
| much should be forgiven me on account
of my age.
Some months ago Marjory confided
to me that she was very dissatisfied
with her father's taste in dress.
“He will wear that stuffy old uni-
form,” she said, “and it's simply hidjus.
It's such a hidjus colour. If it wasn't
for the bright buttons he simply couldn't
wear it at all. I said to him, ‘Why
don't you have one of those dear little
bits of ribbon on it 2 It would look
much nicer.’”
“And what did he say to that 2." I
asked.
“Oh, he just laughed,” Marjory re-
plied. “He said, ‘If they gave me one
of those ribbons it would only be by
mistake.'''
That, as I say, was some months
ago, since when her father and his
“hidjus” coat have been somewhere
OverSeas.
This morning, as I was taking my
usual stroll, I became aware of small
but rapid footsteps behind me, and,
turning, found Marjory in hot pursuit.
“Daddy's come home,” she cried,
almost before she was within earshot,
and she proceeded to drag me to the
nearest seat. When Marjory has im-
portant news to impart she must be
dancing, first on one foot and then on
the other, but she prefers her audience
to be seated.
“Daddy's come home,” she repeated,
“and what do you think?” -
I said I couldn't think at all.
Marjory stopped dancing for a mo-
ment and spoke with tremendous em-
phasis. *
“You know what Daddy said about
that bit of ribbon 2 Well, they've made
that mistake '''
SEA FEWER.
If a Dreadnought's routine leaves you
sick of the sea,
Or you're threatened with submarine
cramp,
If you feel a sardine in a T.B.D.,
Don't “request" for a Naval Camp—
Not a draft-forming, leave-stopping
camp !
Take a spit of low sand swept by all
the best gales,
Add some tents of an obsolete stamp,
Find some work to keep Jack out of
harm till he sails,
There's your perfect Auxiliary Camp—
Quite a perfectly comfortless camp.
The motor-launch man needs the hide
of a duck,
The “controls” of a cruiser are damp,
But you'll never live wetter than when
you get stuck -
In the mud of an Admiralty Camp—
Inches deep in a slush-smothered
camp.
For the fly bites by day and the rat
gnaws by night,
After Lights-out the earywigs ramp;
When I get off to sea the best part
of me
Will be left in an R.N.R. Camp—
In a blood-sucking, gnat-breeding
camp. -
So whether you're broiling off Bar-
badoes
Or waltzing round mines in a tramp,
Be advised by a grouser—a grouser
“who knows"—
Steer clear of a Naval Camp—
Of a shore-loafing, land-lubber's
camp !

HINDENBURGITIs, on THE PRussian Hoxie MADE BEAUTIFUL.
WASTE. -
THE Lokalanzeiger, in announcing
to its readers the fall of Beaucourt,
employs as usual its well-known powers
of subtle strategical insight to put the
matter in its proper light. “It is the
old story.”—such is the conclusion—
“that no position is impregnable so
long as one is willing to incur sufficient
waste of material.”
That is a point that has never been
clearly understood in this country. It
explains many things; among others,
the failure of the Verdun offensive. It
was not that Verdun proved impreg-
nable. No position is. The attack
simply broke down under the burden
of the cheese-paring parsimony of the
CRowN º; taught to abhor the sin
of waste from his childhood up. It
was his iron economy alone that frus-
trated all his plans. It is the old story.
And again it can have been nothing
else than a stern refusal to incur suffi-
cient waste of material that took home
the High Sea Fleet prematurely from
Jutland Bank, before it had fully com-
pleted the destruction of the British
Navy.
We have been so lectured in this
country about the avoidance of waste
that we do not readily recognise the true
value of it. But they know all about
it in Germany. It is understood that
Count REVENTLow's Ginger Group in

But left thee standing, like a riven oak.

And some scant laurels might have

But lest this should be taken
as a proof that the House is

mention that cheers even
more vigorous greeted Lord
RoPERT CECIL's statement
that the only effective reply
to the abominable deporta-
tions in Belgium was to pro-
secute the War with all our
power. • * * *
MARK TwAIN, describing the
condition of the Southern
States after the Civil War, said
that in Charleston he threw
a stick at a dog and hit six
colonels. A somewhat similar
state of affairs exists in the
House of Commons just now.
Annoyed by a question as to
recruiting in Connaught, put
by a warrior-statesman who
hails from Ireland, Mr. DEVILIN
pointedly inquired “whether some
better occupation could be found for
Majors in the Army than asking
questions reflecting upon their own
country.”
In the ever-shifting morass of Irish
politics I was under the impression
that there was just one tiny little
piece of solid ground—the long-stand-
ing enmity between Mr. HEALY and
Mr. DILLoN. But even that is begin-
ning to slide from under me. The
latest injustice to Erin, according to
Mr. DILLON, is the application of
Greenwich time to Ireland, by which
that country has been compelled to
surrender its previous privilege of being
twenty-five minutes behind the times.
The HoME SECRETARY said the matter
had been decided by Parliament. Then
it was that Mr. HEALY came to Mr.
DILLON's assistance. Mr. SAMUEL,
observing the occasion of this renew-
ing of love between the old opponents,
was heard to murmur facetiously :
“Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur
in illis.” -
One of the most engaging features
of the Coalition is the air of detachment
which its members exhibit towards
their colleagues' measures, and even
their own. The theory of collective
responsibility, formerly regarded as the
chief pillar of the Constitution, has now
given way to a much more agreeable
doctrine—from the point of view of

to figure in scarlet and ermine at the
introduction of Lord SHAUGHNEssy in
the House of Peers; and later he was the
subject of a debate in the Commons.
It seems that his Lordship recently
had a secret session all to himself and
some five hundred other gentlemen at
a certain club-luncheon. Mr. OUTH-
waite does not appear to have received
an invitation, but being just the sort
of person to whom anyone would be
disposed to impart confidential in-
formation he knows all about what
happened there. According to his
story Lord NorthcLIFFE made a num-
ber of disclosures for which, if he had
been a poorer man, he would have been
prosecuted.
Mr. OUTHWAITE is not vindictive, how-
ever. , His desire is not that the noble
Lord should be clapped in jail, but that
he, the humble commoner, should be
accorded the right to talk with equal
freedom to his constituents at Hanley.
I think Mr. LLoyd GeoRGE made a
mistake in not closing with this offer at
once, for from what I have read about
the present feelings of Hanley towards
its representative I imagine that the
first speech of the kind foreshadowed by
Mr. OUTHWAITE would also be the last.
The anti-climax to this tale of mys-
tery was provided by Mr. Houston
who declared—faith of a teetotaler!—
that he was present at the iuncheon,
and never heard a word from Lord
NorthcLIFFE that might not have been
published broadcast. The rumour that
the editor of The Daily Mail declined
to print the report on the ground that
it was lacking in public interest is
probably untrue. But I notice that he
describes to-night's debate as a “gross
waste of time." Is this not almost a
case of lèse-majesté Ž

The long days dawn and wane;

to be in enemy country, and how delighted he

“Here's Miss Wilson,” snapped a small and rather
squeaky voice from the door.
“Oh, get out, Fifi, you little beast,” said Belle, “ or we'll
kick you out. We know perfectly well she's coming. She's
never late, I will say that; and she always attends to me
first.”
Daisy and Janet were engaged in an angry altercation,
apparently about something to do with their lunch, when
Miss Wilson entered.
“Oh, you silly pair,” she said. “If you don't stop
quarrelling one of you will have to change places with
Belle.”

THERE are various words much in need of a rest; -

They've been horribly hackneyed, remorselessly stressed;
And there's one that's so stale that it moves my disgust–
'Tis the sadly misused monosyllable “Must.”
It was worn pretty thin several seasons ago, - -
When the National shouted that “Balfour Must Go,”
But now there's no problem that's ever discussed
Without a profuse repetition of “Must.”
It's the slave of the headline, that curse of the Press,
Which forces the note to the vilest excess;
And there's never a day we're not fretted and ſussed . .
By some new and absurd and hysterical “Must.”
All the grousers and cavillers, leathern of lung; -
All the parrots that only can fight with their tongue;
All who want to win laurels without any dust—
Are at one in their cheap iteration of “Must.”
For the things that they tell us must promptly be done
As often as not are already begun, * .
And they know it, but afterwards blatantly thrust
In their claim to the credit, because they cried, “Must.”
Exhortations addressed by the sober and sane
Don't always appeal to the average brain,
But it makes my blood boil till I'm ready to bust
When the voice of sheer Blatherskite bellows, “We Must.”
The Censor's activities often excite
Words of animadversion more frank than polite;
But he'd earn our respect aid he'd cease to be cussed
If he strictly tabooed this provocative “Must.”

In this weather “de rigueur” is quite the right expression
for these sub Jove entertainments.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN With Cavalry in 1915 (SAMPsoN Low), Mr. FREDERIC
CoLEMAN continues the thrilling account of British warfare
which he began in From Mons to Ypres with French. I can
promise the numerous readers who took pleasure in the
first book that they will find this sequel not a whit less
exciting. Mr. Col.FMAN drove a motor car for General
DE LISLE and daily risked his life without hesitation in the
most perilous adventures. He is an American citizen and
was therefore under no compulsion to be in the firing line,
except the compulsion that danger exercises upon an
intrepid spirit. Wherever hard fighting was going on,
there was Mr. CoIEMAN with his battered car, shell-proof
and unperturbed in the midst of death and destruction.
And his account of what he did and what he saw is at the
same time vivid and modest, picturesque and restrained.
It must not be supposed from his title that he saw cavalry
doing work with which that arm has been associated in
other wars, the intoxicating charge, the cut and thrust
and the pursuit on horseback. That may come in good
time. Mr. CoI.EMAN saw horse-soldiers doing the work of
| foot-soldiers, and doing it splendidly. His book is the
prose epic of their deeds.
It is a sad fact that, though dogs and gardens are among
the richest of human delights, conversation about them
has a fatal tendency to grow tedious. The sagacities of
! * *
another person's terrier, like the dimensions of his sweet-
peas, need not only sympathy but tact in the telling. That
is why I call certain attractive dogs, who were so happy
as to own Mrs. T. P. O'Connor for a mistress, doubly
fortunate in having her engaging pen to chronicle their
virtues. She has embodied the tale of them in a volume
happily entitled Dog Stars (UNWIN). The greater part of it
is devoted to the history of Mar, the stately black-and-tan
collie, whom many persons about the House of Commons
no doubt remember as the constant companion of T.P.
When full allowance has been made for the writer's very
natural prejudice, the fact remains that here was a four-
footed gentleman of the first nobility and intelligence.
Just now and then, perhaps, Mrs. O'CoNNor's estimate of
his gifts (as a connoisseur of old furniture, for instance,)
may move you to a slight protest of incredulity... I should
hesitate to accuse her of telling tall stories; but let us
admit that there are moments when her enthusiasm rises
to a rather giddy height. Myself, I liked as well as any
part the account of poor Beau, the ill-treated cur whom
the author rescued and transferred to a life of enviable
felicity. I must not forget to mention the five spirited
and sympathetic pictures by Mr. WILL RANNELLs which
add grace to a very handsome volume.
In Denmark Klokke Roland, by the distinguished Danish
poet, JoHANNEs JöRGENSEN, has become justly famous. It
has run into some twenty editions, and is stated to have
had a greater success than any book ever produced in the

Danish language. It has now been translated into English
and published under the title of False Witness (Hodder
AND Stoughton). It is a most moving and remarkable
book, and should be sure of a very wide circle of readers.
In a white - heat of scorn and indignation the author
examines the origins of the German war-policy and the
shameful atrocities by which it was supported in Belgium.
He takes the Appeal to the Civilised World, composed by
the ninety-three German “intellectuals,” and The Truth
about the War, “published by ten distinguished Berlin
personages,” and subjects them, paragraph by paragraph,
to a close and merciless analysis in the course of which he
exposes to the contempt of all the world outside Germany
the falsehoods, the flatulent whining self-laudation and the
wretched prevarications which make up these characteristic
German brochures. The book is written with a passionate
vehemence of feeling, but every accusation is sustained by
carefully-marshalled evidence of foul deeds that cry to
Heaven for vengeance. “What TT -
right,” says the poet-author,
and we may echo his question
—“what right have the Ger-
mans to demand that they
should not be hated and des-
pised ?” The translation is done
in good English, which is mani-
festly inspired by the nervous
intensity of the original.
“LUcAs MALET's " heroine
Damaris (HUTCHINson) is a
child, very childlike and win-
ning. And I suppose it to be
the author's idea to show off
pretty Mrs. Jimmy Pereira
through the child's adoration
of her. A good device. Yet
Damaris fills little of the stage,
which is set, in the period fol-
lowing the Indian Mutiny, at
Bhutpur, in the old palace
which in former days had seen
orgies of lust and luxury, and
still harboured a lurking spirit

some slow sweet evolution, the systematic formation of
our character as a battalion.” Mr. RAE does not go out of
his way to excuse the lack of discipline of which we heard
so much when the Canadians first arrived in England, but
he does contrive to explain it. These men of the virgin
forest could not, for instance, understand how sacred a tree
was on Salisbury Plain; when firewood was short they
thought the best thing was to go out and cut down “the
nearest stick of timber.” Looking back we must acknowledge
that by the very nature of their free and self-dependent habit
of life they were bound to find strict rules and regulations
troublesome to assimilate. Mr. RAE has not the literary
gifts which stamp the circumstance of war indelibly upon
the mind, but without any fuss or flummery he writes of
things that actually happened, and for the time being at
any rate his gift of reality seems to be just the one quality

worth considering in the literature of the War. His char-

brave deeds, and this record

later inmates. So Mrs. Pereira, -
herself a virtuous flirt, seems to be carried into deep waters,
while her host, the Chief Commissioner, Colonel Charles
Verity, is like to throw prudence and ambition to the winds;
and one of his secretaries goes out of his head all for love
of charming Mrs. Pereira, whom he doesn't know from Eve,
while the other has to argue seriously with himself to
keep within due bounds.
in houses that are not haunted by spirits of desire—but
that is broadly the idea. War coming out of the North
carries the Colonel away from danger, and the beautiful
lady goes back to her too clubable Jimmy, and all ends
wholesomely. I don't know my India, but it all seems
very true and persuasive, which, at the worst, is more
amusing than dull accuracy. LUCAS MALET, almost pro-
fessedly, doesn't take her models from life (even in retro-
spect), but somehow they live. And they talk!
Mr. HERBERT RAE, in his Maple Leaves in Flanders Fields
(SMITH, ELDER), gives us a thoroughly robust account of the
first contingents of the Canadians from the moment War
was declared until they had proved their valour on the
battle-field. He is at his best when he describes their
translation from a crowd of independents into as fine a body

and full of superfluities, even at times a little boring, but
relieved by flashes of real dignity and tenderness. These are
in the few scenes where Olga, who is a musician and married
to a composer who lives in Hampstead, meets the painter,
Brayle, whom she knows to be the only real love of her life.
Though she is perfectly willing to act up to this conviction,
and count Hampstead well lost, circumstances are always
against her taking the plunge. Not till Olga has exasper-

soul-mates find union. Well, as I indicated above, you pay

LONDON CHIARIVARI.
A ROYAL REST-CURE.
TINo, my boy, I cannot, as I write
(Not being furnished with sufficient data),
I'lood with the journalist's authentic light
The issues of that brace of ultimata
Of which the first is due December 1,
Some days before this doggrel sees the sun.
But, since the dullest diplomatic worm
Is bound at last to turn and bite the offender,
And patience now has reached her limit's term,
I dare forecast that either you'll surrender
Or be conducted firmly to the door
. And Athens look upon your face no more.
You might, for choice, be given a change of scene
To one of those delightful watering-places
Where for a time the friends on whom you lean
Received facilities for U-boat bases;
Or you might like to join the little batch
Of Bosches we removed to Dedeagatch;
Or go to Potsdam, getting leave to hitch
On to the Balkan-Zug your special carriage,
And sponge a billet in the spare-room which,
WILLIAM reserves for relatives by marriage;
Or seek, by routes infected with malaria,
A home from home in neighbourly Bulgaria.
Or you might try Vienna, FERDIE's haunt,
Whose absence means a bitter, bitter loss for us;
Or else, as MEHMED's guest, enjoy a jaunt
To some seraglio on the balmy Bosphorus,
And muse upon your namesake's Christian sign
Within the city called of CoNSTANTINE.
Indeed, though you should now repent your sins,
Wallow in sackcloth and remark, “Peccavi / "
The Entente might be sniffy; it begins
To view your methods with a very grave eye;
So, lest you go too far and really vex it,
I recommend a voluntary exit.
You say your single aim is just to use
Your regal gifts for your belovéd nation;
Why, then, I see the obvious line to choose,
Meaning, of course, the path of abdication;
Make up your so-called mind—I frankly would—
To “leave your country for your country's good.”
THE BUN SLEUTH.
“Of course our work had been very arduous for a long
while,” said the Inspector of Police, “but when the order
prohibiting the consumption of pastry was first issued—
the Ban on Buns Act, we called it—it nearly drove us off
our crumpets, if you will excuse my little pleasantry. It
was so hard to prove a case. You see one of our men
might bring in a prisoner with his breath actually smelling
of vanilla and with flaky crumbs on his moustache, and
looking as if he had been living on cream-tarts for a month
—sort of pasty look, you know. A clear case, you'd say.
But no ' If we couldn't produce a section of unconsumed
cream-tart and show that the teeth-marks fitted, the man
would get off. Of course when they gave us power to
arrest on suspicion any person suffering from indigestion
it made it easier for us, but I'm speaking of when the Act
first came into force.
“We had to be pretty cute. For instance, one day I saw
a man coming out of a house in a suspicious manner, and I
noticed a brown stain on his cheek. So I made a note of
the house and walked the chap into the police-station to
have the stain analysed. It was as I thought. We raided
the house—nice respectable villa it looked—and captured
a whole nest of them eating chocolate cakes and coconut
macaroons as happy as you please. Another time it was a
fellow with a sprinkling of white powder on his shoulder.
Of course he might have been kissing the typist, but I
doubted it. I just damped my finger-tip and bumped into
him in a crowd. It tasted sweet—sugar-icing. But we
couldn't bring it home to him, although we discovered the
empty cake-box in the garden neatly buried.
“We had an annoying experience once. A man was
caught red-handed eating a Bath-bun in a railway refresh-
ment-room. We made quite a full-dress case of it: two
waitresses as witnesses, exhibit of a fragment of the
Bath-bun under glass, photographic enlargements of teeth-
prints and so on, and pressed for the maximum penalty.
But the fellow engaged a clever lawyer, who argued that
eating pastry made before the War did not constitute an
offence, and he actually secured an acquittal.
“You’ll notice all the cases I have quoted are men.
Men are ten times worse than women. A woman won't
risk a fine for the sake of a raspberry-tart, but I've known
men whose downfall has been due to nothing else but their
craving for cream buns and mince-pies. Look at that chap
they brought in just now. He was a J.P., wealthy, highly
respected and a regular terror to habitual drunkards. But
one day after the court rose I found some crumbs under the
magisterial bench. That roused my suspicions, and I got
the usher to keep a steady eye on him. We found out that
he was a secret nibbler. Used to smuggle jam-rolls into
the court and hide them behind the ink-wells. Of course
there was a terrible scandal and he got a thumping fine.
He's been here heaps of times since, not on the bench,
but in the dock, and he seems quite unable to pull himself
together and go straight. I expect he'll have to go to a
home eventually. -
“Do you remember the cake riots, when the munition-
makers paraded the town singing, “I do like a nice mince-pie'
and ‘Make me a cake like mother used to make '2' That
was a hot time. But I've got to go now to raid an illicit
bunnery, so I'll tell you about that another time. Good
morning.”
|N A GOOD CAUSE.
Mr. Punch begs leave to appeal once more in a cause that
has always been nearest his heart—the cause of suffering
children. The East London Hospital for Children at
Shadwell stands in urgent need of help. The economy of
its management has been commended by thcse who control
the King Edward's Hospital Fund, and further reduction
in current expenses is impossible. Therefore if no hel
comes it will have to close its doors. This is unthinkable
in these times when the care of the children of our fighting
men is an obligation laid upon us all, and the health of the
new generation is more than ever of vital importance to
the nation. Mr. Punch begs his generous readers to help
this Children's Hospital that serves the needs of a very
poor district, isolated from the natural sources of charity.
Gifts of money, great or small, will be gratefully received
by The Secretary of “Punch,” 10, Bouverie Street, E.C.
Up to last Saturday, donations ranging from sixpence
to £500, and amounting to £1,680, have been received
and acknowledged. Mr. Punch tenders his sincere thanks
to the generous friends who have responded to his appeal,
and ventures to hope that this sum may be at least
doubled before Christmas.

It will be seen from the above that
the odds are somewhat against us. But
we have every confidence in our leaders,

note that political considerations have
not been allowed to prejudice the ap-
appointment of MILTIADES to supreme
command. Deploring as we do the
civil control of the army by political
amateurs, we trust that Mr. CALLI-

leave the military machine in the hands
of those competent to direct it. . . .

[We regret to add that in delivering

well known for his brilliant work in
this connection and will be particularly
remembered for his extraordinary des-
patch from Sparta not more than a few
days ago, fell down dead. In another
column we give a short biographical
account of him. This is the first indi-
cation we have received of any casual-

victory just recorded, but we must warn
our readers that later information will
probably extend the list.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TEN MINUTES IN GERMANY.
THE CURTAIN LIFTED.
AMAZING REVELATIONs.
(With apologies to a certain neutral.)
II.-How I Got ON.
[In a previous article, “How I got in,” the
writer has described his arrival at the German
frontier and his passage across it in the dark.
Before his eyes looms up a small building
whence shines a light.]
HAVING rapidly filled in several in-
surance coupons against sudden death
and one against unlawful assembly, I
approached the building and peered
through the window. Apparently the
place was an inn. I could see a small
counter on which stood half-a-dozen
bottles. Behind the counter sat a man
with an absolutely expressionless face.
I have, in fact, seen more expression
on the back of a hansom cab than
appeared on that man's countenance.
He was eating a sausage. I resolved to
enter the inn.
I entered.
To be precise, I caught my foot in
the doorstep, looped the loop and nose-
dived into the counter. When I arose
the sausage-eater stared at me. Then
he spoke:–
“Wos you fallen or vos you pushed?”
In fluent German I rapidly explained
the situation, exhibiting my Chinese
passport, my Mexican registration card
and my Peruvian birth certificate. He
did not seem interested.
Feeling that at all costs I must make
a good impression, I produced six other
passports, forty-two letters of intro-
duction from high personages, and eight
judgment summonses. The inn-keeper
continued to assimilate his sausage.
Time was pressing. I had much to
learn. Good fortune had brought me
to the spot where I could obtain first-
hand information. I must not delay.
Shouting at the top of my voice in
order to make myself heard above the
din of the sausage-destruction, I fired
off a series of searching questions. For
the benefit of readers who have only a
moderate knowledge of the German
tongue I append a translation of the
replies received.
“Can you supply me,” I asked,
“with a poularde Haldane or a canard
Carmelite?”
“Nein (No),” he replied.
“Can you give me some curried
lobster, some caviare, two dozen best
Whitstable natives and a pèche Clara
Butt 2 ''
“Nein (No),” he said.
“Have you any mock turtle soup,
roast ortolans, pâté de foie gras,
plovers' eggs or freshly-caught Severn
salmon?”
“Neim (No),” he answered.
Good heavens ! I shook from head
to foot with excitement. The country
was starving ! If I could not procure
these trifles at an inn—an imm, mark
you--how should I fare in an ordinary
dwelling-house? I simply did not
attempt to think.
“Can you give me anything to eat?”
I demanded.
“Ja, ja (Yes, yes),” he replied, and,
putting his hand in his pocket, he pro-
duced another sausage.
I recoiled. Sausages I have known,
and again, sausages, but this—this was
akin to frightfulness. I hastily ad-
justed my gas mask and turned to the
question of drink.
“Have you any Imperial Tokay or
Waterloo port?" I bawled, raising my
mask.
“Nein (No),” he said.
I rapidly enumerated the best and
most exclusive wines. He had none of
them. Neither had he any of the more
expensive brands of tea, coffee or
cocoa. Obviously the land was dying
of thirst.
Then I showed him the remnants of
my standard loaf. The effect was
amazing. He shook all over like a
badly-set jelly, his head swelled visibly,
his collar burst open, and the seams of
his coat ripped up all down his back.
Snatching the bread from my hand he
swallowed about a quartern of it at one
gulp. By this time I too was shaking
like an aspen. In the space of four
minutes I had acquired information
which would stir Britain from Land's
End to John o'Groats. I could imag-
ine the national excitement at the pub-
lication of my revelations. In my
mind's eye I could picture Londoners
snatching the journals of the Duke of
Ludgate Circus from newsvendors'
hands and devouring the amazing news
where they stood (i.e., the Londoners),
regardless of the motor-buses and taxi-
cabs that ground them beneath their
wheels as they read. In the lonely
Highlands I could see hardy shepherds
scaling mountains, swimming lochs,
sliding down precipices and walking
scores of miles to secure a copy of
my incredible article. , Householders
would sell their all, beggars would
give their last copper, to buy a copy of
the journal. Crowds delirious with
excitement would besiege the offices of
the Duke's newspapers, raging, wrest-
ling and writhing for the printed sheets
until the street in which the building
stood became a shambles.
Then the voice of the inn-keeper
broke the silence of the room. Three
minutes later the secrets of the German
War Machine were mine.
(To be continued.)
VEGETABLE VERSE.
[It is hoped, now that flower-gardens are
being planted with vegetables and fruit, that
minor poets will do their bit in the interests
of National Economy by supporting the move-
ment and addressing their war-time lyrics to
wholesome foodstuffs in place of the usual
roses, pansies, lotus-buds, etc., etc. A few
suggestions are here appended.]
WHEN one is feeling agitato
How soothing is a ripe Tomato!
It calms the bosom's savage beat
And is most nourishing to eat.

Whose tender leaves could ne'er upset

Though epicures may scorn and flout

I'll write a poem all about you.
The sight of thee, O luscious Melon,
Inclines me to become a felon;
Oh, how I'd love to gulp and gulp
Vast slices of thy juicy pulp !
If I a weakness must confess
It is for sandwiches of Cress;
How often have I loudly blustered
When they have put me off with
Mustard.
In genteel circles all the rage is
For Nectarines and plump Greengages,
But vulgar persons in the slums
Have just to be content with Plums.
Slim and elegant Cucumber,
You among my friends I number;
Indeed I find it rather hard
Not to eat you by the yard
Sage, Mint, Marjoram and Parsley,
Though we patronise you sparsely,
Each of you deserves a rhyme
If one only had the Thyme !
Motto for Meatless Days: “The time
is out of joint.”
“A RochestER OctoGENARIAN.—Mrs. —,

A tactful heading. Some elderly ladies
are so touchy about their age.
“The Britannic was never on passenger
service. As soon as she was completed she
was taken over by the Admiralty as a hospital
ship, and had been

As so often happens it must have been
done without acknowledgment. This
is the first we have heard of the trans-
action.

Not to be confused with the “old salt "

Essence of PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 27th. – To-day
the great Coalition Tank, which has
lumbered along for a year and a-half,
resisting with equal imperturbability
the bombs of a CARson and the darts
of a CHURCHILL, was precious nearly
overturned by a Hogg|E.
To do the hon. Member justice he
fully deserved his tri-
umph. He is believed
— but this I doubt —
to know the exact point
at which the functions
of Chelsea Hospital
merge into those of the
Statutory Committee,
and the number of forms
(within a dozen or so)
that must be filled up,
and the amount of time
(allowing a margin of
not more than three
months) before a dis-
charged hero will be able
to draw his modest guer-
don in cash.
The reward for all his
labour came this after-
noon, when he moved
the first of a series of
amendments designed to
knock the bottom out of
the Board of Pensions
Bill and rebuild it on a
foundation of common-
sense. At first Mr. HEN-
DERson was inclined to
resist. But Member after
Member rose to support
the plan of having a sin-
gle Minister with nothing
else to do but to look
after pensions. Seeing
defeat looming in the
Division Lobbies, and
not altogether sorry, per-
haps, to be rid of a
compromise measure for
which he had never dis-
played any marked en-
thusiasm, Mr. HENDER-
son at last gave way and
consented to remodel the ...
Bill on the lines indicated *
in the Amendment.
An expansive smile spread over the
countenance of his conqueror, who
perhaps foresaw still greater triumphs
in store for him. If the country, as
some say, needs a Dictator, people
know now where to look for him.
Again we may hear in our streets the
ancient rhyme:–

notion of the objects of the Bill.
Contrary to experience they could not
see the trees for the WooD. Sir
EDWARD CARson, after a long and fruit-
less cross-examination, came to the con-
clusion that the House might as well
give the Government a blank cheque
for the remainder of the War. -
Thursday, November 30th.-Some-
one suggested that the Kitchen Com-
mittee should by way of example
institute a meatless day. Colonel Lock-
wood, who has no illusions with regard
to the tastes of his fellow-Members,
was sympathetic but not enthusiastic.
Hitherto, he pointed out, they had been
content with vicarious sacrifice, and
had acted on the principle, Qui facit
per alium facit per se. Up jumped
Mr. HEALY. “Did you not rule, Mr.
SPEAKER, that Irish should not be
spoken here?” The only Member who
did not seem to enjoy the joke was
Mr. GINNELL, who on his reappearance
yesterday had explained at great length
the iniquity of his being sent to prison
for nothing more heinous than writ-
ing his name “in the language used
throughout this country before the
arrival of the Romans.”
Time was when the neglect of the
British Government to attend to the
drainage of the Bann and the Barrow
was an almost daily subject of com-
plaint with the Irish Members. Barrow
has overflowed his banks again, it seems,
and Mr. MEEHAN, in the hope of soften-
ing the CHIEF SECRETARY's heart, men-
tioned that he knew a holding where
the only thing visible above the wild
waste of waters was a tree bearing a
placard calling upon farmers to “join
the British Army.” Mr. DUKE re-
gretted that he could do nothing. But
surely he might at least induce the
recruiting authorities to substitute
“Navy" for “Army.”
The Pensions Bill was again down for
Committee. It was decided to pass the
Government amendments en bloc and
then recommit the Bill. This neces-
sitated Members applying themselves
alternately to the white paper and the
blue paper, as if they were mixing a
seidlitz powder.

man, well done!” But our Bulgarians were always thus
—strong fighters, glorious in their courage, men whom no-
thing could restrain when hard knocks were to be given
or taken.
Ferdimand. Yes, we are all like that.
Peasant. All—except, perhaps, our CzAR FERDINAND.
They say of him that he is no great fighter; that his cheek
turns pale and his body trembles when the guns go off.
Strange, is it not ? But of course he is no true Bulgarian.
Ferdinand. Surely you wrong him. I have heard that
he is the bravest of the brave and is always to be found
where the danger is greatest. They tell me he is indeed a
noble fighter.
Peasant. It may be so. I have never seen him and
only repeat what I have heard. But when all say the
same thing you may be certain there is some ground for it.
All I know is that I should not like my two sons who are
now fighting to be like that; and I myself, in my fights
against the Turks, did not turn pale and tremble.
Ferdinand. Different people, you know, have different
ways of showing courage. Perhaps a King may not show
it as a peasant does. - - -
Peasant. No, no. ... Courage is the same everywhere, so
far at least as trembling goes. If a King runs away, would
you say he was a brave man 2 Of course not. -
Ferdinand. Well, I must be pressing on now.

liberated us from the Turks, and have always been our good
friends. And now we are defeated in battle.

Yes, it must have been he, and it may be that fear is
driving him so swiftly from the fight. If it be so he
knows now what one Bulgarian thinks of him.
THE creed of HAMBURG.
[German newspapers report a recent Conference of the clergy of
Hamburg to discuss “The Simplification of Religion in the Light of
the Experiences of the War.” Herr Pastor RIEssex BURG, the prin-
cipal orator at the Conference, who spoke exhaustively on earlier
“simplifications,” carried his hearers with him when he declared
that the time had come for another change. “After this war there
will be no longer room in the world for the battle of dogmas and
rites. Struggles about this or that usage in conducting religious
services will be unthinkable. The example of the front has made a
profound impression on the nation. Worship at the front is sim-
plicity itself.” In conclusion the speaker looked forward to a day,
immediately after the conclusion of peace, when the last remnants of
the religions of prophets and priests will be swept from the earth, and
when what is left will be so simple and pure and essential that no
further simplification will be necessary.]
THE pastors and theologians of Hamburg have lately held
A Conference in their city, by a laudable aim impelled;
For they recognise that religion is a disconcerting guide
And, to prove a national asset, must be thoroughly sim-
plified. -
The process of simplification at the Conference outlined
Is entirely characteristic of the genial German mind;
For it springs from the firm conviction that Fritz is always
right— - -
That whatever is done by the fighting Hun is good in “our
old Gott's" sight. - -
The words of the priests and prophets, which human nature
stunt, -
Will be swept away by the lessons derived from the men at
the Front, - * - -
And so splendid will be the product of the crucible of war
That no further simplifying will be needed any more.
The ineffectual Gospel of Love, long out of date, . .
Will be merged in the saner gospel of high and holy Hate,
For it's clear that a chosen people must 'stablish a world-
control, - -
Though it means the extermination of every alien soul.
All methods pursued by the Germans are pure and noble
and sweet, - -
For they are the favoured of Heaven, the universe's élite;
But the same identical methods pursued by another race
When tried by the New Religion are wicked and vile and
base. - - -
- From this comfortable doctrine quite logically flows
The need of a war not only against embattled foes,
But war on women and children, on the gray and stricken
head,
War on the sick and wounded, war on the dying and dead.
So it need not excite our wonder that the pastors of
Hamburg town
Should be so extremely anxious to cast the prophets down;
For never since ancient HERoD defiled the light of the sun
Has any man worshipped the Devil so well as the modern
Hun.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Dixon Scott, a gunner subaltern, died of dysentery in
Gallipoli. Men of Letters (Hodder AND STOUGHToN), a
volume of literary criticisms, is the best memorial his
friends could have raised to him, and no student or amateur
of modern literature should fail to read these perceptive
studies. Let it be granted that, writing as a journalist
(chiefly for two distinguished Northern papers which often
have made our Metropolitan sheets look provincial), he is
tempted towards a too lavish use of bright symmetrical
labels—“The guilt of Mr. Chesterton,” “The innocence of
Bernard Shaw,” “The meekness of Mr. Rudyard Kipling”
—and the like. But he always contrives to make good his
challenges, and has in an astonishing degree the qualities
of such defects as the forthright newspaper method en-
courages. I don't recall any other criticism as trenchant
º the least unfriendliness) of the Adelphi sage, and
think that even that case-hardened publicist would have
a queer thrill of the spine looking into this candid mirror.
Yet Dixox Scott had the critic's best gift of being able,
and evidently preferring, to find beauties instead of faults;
together with a sensitive power of analysis most rare in so
young a writer. An admirable note on Mr. GRANVILLE
BARKER's plays should do something to draw attention to
the deeper gifts of that enterprising actor-producer. Other
studies are as valuable: of Mrs. MEYNELL, of Mr. WELLs,
of Mr. BENNETT and of Mr. C. E. MoMTAGUE. Praise
from the discreet MAx–the “Beau Beerbohm " of one of
the labels--prefaces this volume. We have lost a critic of
letters who would have done finer work. But he “filled
his space” admirably; and could there be better epitaph
for a journalist—or a soldier? Hail, and farewell!
Yet another War book—a small one and unique amongst
its fellows in that it is devoted wholly to what one might
call after-effects; in other words to the experiences of an
officer, that same cheery and engaging young gentleman
whom you may already know by his pen-name of “Platoon
Commander," after the wound that ended With my Regi-
ment had brought him to Hospital Days (UNWIN). I hope
you will not be alarmed into thinking that a book with such
a title must be morbid or depressing. A greater error could
not be made. The picture on the cover, of a jovial soul in
khaki, with crutches, a cigarette, and an expansive smile,
is delightfully typical of the contents; and though, to be
sure, the author does inevitably and intentionally bring the
scent of iodine into his pages, he brings also, far more, the
atmosphere of good-humour and rest-after-toil that one
will always associate with the memory of war-hospitals and
convalescent homes. The high spirit of the little book is of
the most refreshing quality. You will hardly read a page
without a smile; while some of the author's stories (notably
the famous practical joke about the Bond Street shop and
the safety razors, which I fear is almost too good to be
true) must move to actual laughter. But of course behind
the laughter there is always another feeling: and it is
just because of this that I think “Platoon Commander”
has deserved well of English wives and mothers for his

I find it easier to sympathise with Helen Caniper, the
heroine of E. H. YoUNG's Moor Fires (MURRAY), than to
understand her. Under stress of circumstances (including
her sister, a minx of minxes) she gives up the right man,
Dr. Zebedee Mackenzie, and undertakes to marry the wrong
one. It is the old story of a craving for self-immolation,
indulged at the cost of everybody's comfort. Fortune cor-
rects the lady's error so far as to make her a widow, but by
this time her nerves are so shattered that Zebedee would
be well-advised to call in a specialist before returning to his
original idea of marrying her. The author's theme is com-
pact; we are never taken beyond the small circle of the
Canipers and the eerie atmosphere of the moor that hems
them in. Queer folk, but rather lovable.

ON A DISTANT VIEW OF THE PRESENT
CHANGE.
As IT STRIKEs CERTAIN PEOPLE SoMEwhere IN FRANCE.
[At this critical stage of the War, when there is talk, none too soon,
of organising the whole strength of the country, it may be well to note
the statement, made without adverse comment by the Liberal Press,
that certain Liberal ex-Ministers refused to place their services at the
disposal of the man whom the KING invited to take up the burden of
Government.] -
ALTHough this crisis which has just occurred -
Mere soldiers mayn't presume to understand,
It almost looks as if at last you'd heard
That we've a war on hand.
Thank God, we keep no politicians here;
Fighting's our game, not talking ; all we ask
Is men and means to face the coming year
And consummate our task.
Give us the strongest leaders you can find,

So they are swift to act and know their mind
Too well to wait and see.

High service to the State.
Such there have been in whom we held belief,
Thrice proven in the searching test they bore;
Loyal to England first; who loved their chief,
But loved their country more.
Yet are there ugly tales of trust abused;
Of some that, careless though the Cause were checked,
Pleading a lesser loyalty, refused
Aid to the KING's Elect.
Short shrift would these have had out here to-day,
For here with such as falter in the fight,
Or shirk at duty's post, we have a way
Sudden and not polite.

FOOD CONTROL.
Philberry Gedge had reached the dessert stage of an
excellent repast when the newcomer entered the restaurant.
Habitués of the Bonanza resent the intrusion of strangers,
and Philberry creased his brows into a frown of grave
displeasure.
The newcomer, a soberly dressed official-looking man,
was in no wise abashed. He glanced imperiously round the
tables, and, following his look, Philberry was surprised to
see a lady, in shell pink Georgette, furtively slip a portion
of pèche Melba under her chair, while her companion
“vanished " a half-consumed marron-glacé up the sleeve
of his faultlessly-cut evening coat.
Hippolyte, the head waiter, was arranging a food-poem
for a party of three elderly epicures. Hippolyte in the
throes of composition was always impressive, but as he
moved away the stranger beckoned him unceremoniously,
indicated his tablets with a gesture, and struck a vigorous
pencil mark through several of the items. -
“Anything saved from the wreck, Hippy?” anxiously
inquired one of the party as Hippolyte returned.
Hippolyte uplifted a tragic eyebrow and two despairing
palms. “De turtle soup ees gone, de venison ees demol-
ished, and de fruit compóte ees annihilated ' " But—” his
voice rose to a lyrical note of joy—“we haſ saved de
fried sole, de fricassee, de ices and de fromage.”
An expression of relief dawned on the faces of the party.
“Try and smuggle in a double portion of fried sole, Hippy,”
said one of the gentlemen hoarsely, behind his hand.
Hippolyte nodded like a conspirator. It was all very
strange to Philberry, who resumed the peeling of his apple
in a whirl of perplexity. Suddenly the stranger swooped
down on him and, producing a small measuring gauge
from his pocket, applied it to the pendant peel.
“Three-sixty-fourths of an inch thick ' " he said sharply.
“You are getting perilously near the limit. Oblige me by
using a sharper knife.”
“Why — what l” stammered Philberry.
deuce 9 "
“Kindly place your peel in the receptacle provided for
it,” he said. “It makes excellent apple jelly. Do you
mean to say you don't know who I am 2 "
“I've been away for some weeks,” said Philberry lamely.
“That accounts for it. Well, I'm the Food Waste
Inspector from the Economy Department. I have no end
of trouble limiting the meals in these smart restaurants.
The proprietors say that the customers order the food,
and they daren't offend 'em by refusing to serve 'em.
Expect we shall have to make an example of one or two
of them. Now, for instance, may I inquire what you
have had for dinner 2 ''
Philberry was suddenly aware that Hippolyte was
making violent gesticulations behind the Inspector's back.
“I had some clear soup,” he said.
Hippolyte's signals of distress grew painfully wild.
“And a little halibut.”
“And—” encouraged the Inspector.
“And nossings else ! ” broke in Hippolyte excitedly.
Recollections of a plump and tender chicken, crisp cutlets,
and seductive chocolate pudding with exquisite sauce
passed through Philberry's memory, but there was no
resisting Hippolyte's appeal.
“And nothing else,” he echoed. “Excepting, of course,”
he added magnanimously, “this apple.”
“Excellent!" said the Inspector. “I wish everyone was
as frugal. But I must be going.”
“Hippolyte,” said Philberry, “my bill.”
Hippolyte approached reluctantly. IIe tried to catch

Philberry's eye, but that gentleman was engaged in earnest
conversation with the Inspector.
“Soup, one shilling,” he wrote. “Fish, two shillings.”
A pause. “Dessert, sixpence.” A longer pause. “Total"—
he cast one last despairing look at Philberry—“three-and-
sixpence.” -
“And sixpence for yourself makes four shillings,” said
Philberry pleasantly. “An excellent and very reasonable
dinner. Good night.” And he walked out with the Inspector.
Hippolyte sank down in a chair and fanned himself
feebly with a dinner-napkin.

LIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, This weather
deserves a page to itself. I fancy that
the Clerk, or the Assistant or Deputy
Clerk as the case may be, has really
been stretching himself this time, just
to show what he can do. Men no
longer look at his production through
a window, say a few well-chosen words
about it and return to their armchairs
by the fire. They live with it and in
it and on it. From first thing in the
morning (a thing you've probably never
met, Charles) till the last thing at night
and from last thing at night till first
thing in the morning your modern
fighting man associates himself person-
ally and permanently with the cur-
rent weather. This has required some
adaptability and mobility on his part
lately, for the recent assortment can
only be described as “the rich mixed.”
Every taste is catered for, except that
of fanciful people who seek for summer
out of season. Would you be braced
by a nice fresh wind from the East,
hollow ground? Sunday is your day.
Would you have a dozen hours or so
cold douche, without the tiresome et-
cetera of soap and towels? Your tap
will run gratis all Monday. Would
you be stiffened by something racy
from the North with a smack º snow
about it? Tuesday will supply the
stiffening. Next, what about a nice
vapour bath?
that, and so that you needn't remove
your clothes to get the benefit of the
vapour. On Thursday you can be aſ the
North Pole, on Friday at the bottom of
the Dead Sea, and on Saturday you can
enjoy a complete résumé of the whole
week's weather, with a hailstorm and a
hurricane thrown in for bonus. And all
the while the fireworks go on, in case
you might feel neglected just for the
want of some thunder and lightning.
It has been said that words fail to
do justice to this business, but that is
only from the point of view of the de-
scriptive artist. For those who choose
and use their words for their own selfish
ends and immediate satisfaction, there
has not been an entire want. A word
has been provided for this War as a
comfort or a remedy for that tired
feeling. It has a thousand applications,
six letters and no meaning. It carries
weight. It is a word no gentleman
would lay his tongue to, though there
has been an occasion (at least, I think
so; I'm trying to remember) when
Wednesday will supply
it fell out of my own mouth. No,
|Charles, I'm sorry to say, it isn't even

this War simply couldn't have been
managed without it.
Not essentially a term of endearment
in itself, the degree of its use might
tempt the sentimental idealist to hope
that, once this struggle is finished, we
shall all combine to make an end for
ever of all persons and things military.
That would be a mistaken hope; I
note, in fact, ominous signs of a rap-
prochement between the born-military
and the born-civilian element out here;
a dangerous tendency to fraternize.
Old soldiers (of the “Established,
1867" type) have sunk so low as to
have a sneaking affection for young
Something-in-the-City; presumably
wise and practical men of business,
whom you would have thought old
enough to know better, admit in whis-
pers and with a blush that they see
some sense after all in the military
method. I have heard the most in-
dividualist section of the proletariat
wonder aloud if that once advertised
and cherished M.P. of theirs did, for
all his rich profusion of promises, take
as much real interest in the minutest
details of their personal welfare as does
Whatever it is, however,

now their grim and silent and six-letter
Brigadier? Suppose, Charles, for one
breathless moment just suppose, that
we elected our General Officers Com-
manding. I can hear our candidate
addressing us on the eve of the poll:
“Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers
and Men, I see before me the most
unruly, unkempt, untidy, and (will you
stop shuffling your feet?) altogether
inefficient collection of nondescripts
I ever remember to have set eyes on.
If, for my sins, I'm put at the head
of you, I can guarantee you a busy and
troublous time till you have changed.
For the future, I should advise you, if
you elect me, to get into my way of
thinking as quickly as you can and
act up to it. For the present I will
listen to no questions and give no
answers . . . You may dismiss.” And,
having saluted and dismissed and
labelled him with the right epithet, and
imputed to him every personal failing,
and prayed for him every conceivable
misfortune, we should vote for him
7te?n. CO71.
Talking of politicians and soldiers, I
promised you a later episode in the
career of Second-Lieutenant McIver,
that once riotous partisan of all Tory
causes. I told you how he learnt
discipline, but I did not mean you to
suppose that all the original sin had
gone out of him. The last time I
saw him his battalion was at rest and
he had had a day off, to go amongst
the civilised. Moreover he had the sole
use of a car, returning empty, for the
homeward journey. So he found him-
self, having fed like a lord and bathed
in hot water like a prince, trundling
home in a private motor like a king.
Never one of those giants who refresh
themselves with wine, he gets all the
stimulant he wants from life in general.
He found it at this moment quite
intoxicating, and the wildest part of his
inner soul called for an outlet. Heaven
smiled upon him; it was his day.
In the first place Heaven blessed
him with a chauffeur not unambitious
in the matter of speed, and in the
second place it put another car on his
road for him to overtake.
In the third place it so arranged that
the rival car was being driven by a real
red Olympian in person. Heaven was
indeed lavish that day, for this is a
phenomenon I have never yet seen,
much less dared to overtake.
In the fourth place it possessed the
Olympian with the spirit of competi-
tion, but in the fifth place it so smiled
upon McIver's carburetter, engine, igni-
tion, gears and all that was
that he left the Olympian standing.
cIver's,
In the sixth place it developed in the
Olympian an extreme wrath at being
himself surpassed by a mere subaltern;
and in the seventh place it selected for
its Olympian a man who was not only,
in the present, a temporary military
Olympian, but had also been in the past
a great Radical politician. Heaven
in fact appeared to be going right out
of its way to satisfy McIver's utmost
desires.
In the eighth place it so fulfilled the
Olympian with rage that when at last
he overtook McIver at his destination
he drew up alongside and embarked
upon an argument with him ; and in
the ninth and last and best place of all,
it put the Olympian in the wrong from
the start, because, by regulation, he
had no business to be driving his car
at all, as Heaven took care to inform
McIver by the mouth of his chauffeur
during the race.
It was at the point of contact that
I happened to be, and I watched the
argument. The Olympian, according
to his inner nature, spoke with heat
and for immediate effect, touching
upon a number of hitherto unknown

laws which made it a misdemeanour
for anybody to overtake anybody else
on the road, and a capital crime for a
Second Lieutenant to do it to an
Olympian. McIver said nothing, not
even with reference to the more definite
law about cars being driven only by
their chauffeurs. Only too plainly he
was reserving his defence for judicial
proceedings before such disciplinary
authority as the Olympian might care
to invoke, knowing full well, and well
knowing that the Olympian knew full
well, that there weren't going to be
any judicial proceedings, and no dis-
ciplinary authority in this world was
ever going to hear of the matter. In
a word, McIver did in fact what we
all pretend from time to time to have
done; he just looked at his adversary.
If you ever come to doubt the real
existence out here of our happy war-
riors, get hold of McIver and hear him
tell how first he fought, and then he
bathed, fed, travelled speedily, raced
an Olympian and left him nowhere,
downed all Radical dialectics with a
look, and then went on fighting.

CRUSHING DEFEAT AT THERMOPYLE.
HELLENE ARMY ANNIHILATED.
“A Disor DERLY TABBLE.”
(Special to “The Sparta Spalchcock.")
Wouſ.D to Zeus I had never seen
this day ! The Army has been annihi-
lated. It is now—as I believe I am
the first to inform you—a mere dis-
orderly rabble.
It is impossible to glean any details
of the tragedy. Apparently—as was
naturally to be expected—we encount-
ered the overwhelmingly superior forces
of the enemy and suffered the inevitable
consequences. Incredibly deluded by
the effete superstition of the invinci-
bility of Hellene arms, in face of the
whole science of modern war, which
shows that nowadays numbers, and
numbers only, count, we have had at
the first shock a tragic awakening.
As the rumours of the débâcle spread,
and as later I watched the first broken
remnants of our miserable force strag-
gling South, I thought bitterly of the
disregarded warnings of the last ten
years, during which Persia has been
making the most immense military
preparations, plainly destined for use
against the Hellenes, and merely wait-
ing for the most favourable moment to
attack us. Meanwhile we have done
nothing. Those who pleaded for an
army of defence on the continental
scale have been shouted down, while
even in Sparta itself we have allowed
—and apparently still allow—nothing
to interfere with our sacred Games.
And this is the result. The huge
Persian war-machine, magnificently
organized and equipped, is pounding in
pursuit and everywhere sweeping irre-
sistibly onwards. Nothing that we can
bring into the field for many months
can hope to stand against them. Athens
must fall. And afterwards . . . . .
From “The Lacedaemon Leader.”
Now that we have at last received
the official report of what will, no doubt,
be known as the Battle of Thermopylae
and the subsequent successful retire-
ment of the Hellenes southwards, we are
able—supplementing our still scanty
information with details from the letters
of combatants which have appeared in
our columns—to put a definite value
on the deliberately scaremongering ac-
count with which the special corre-
spondent of a contemporary was per-
mitted to shock the country.
What was it that we were told in
that infamous “Would to Zeus” article?
The army of the Hellenes had been
annihilated; nothing but “a disorderly
rabble" was left ; the Persians had
carried all before them, etc., etc. And
the writer concluded, of course, with
his usual admiration of the methods
of the enemy and insults to his country-
men, concerning which we are content
to say at the moment that we are still
unregenerate enough to prefer small
highly trained contingents like those of
the Hellenes, every man of which has
his heart in the business, to the pressed
hordes of the Persians, who have to be
driven into battle with the whip.
The whole truth is—in his haste to
vilify his countrymen even the possi-
bility of it seems never to have occurred
to the writer of the Spatchcock article
—that Thermopylae was not, rightly
considered, a defeat at all. It was a
long and desperate defensive against
enormous odds, during which the “con-
temptible little army” of the Hellenes
(which, in the opening stages of the
engagement, XERXES scornfully deputed
his Guards—the so-called “Immortals”
—to wipe out) for three days kept the
entire force of the Persians at bay, and
then only retired because, as the report
says, “the enemy had worked round
our flank and it became necessary to
safeguard the retreat of the army.”
The majority got clean away in good
order, covered by the devoted Spartan
remnant, which, in accordance with
our proud traditions, remained to die
gloriously on the field of battle.
“Surrender be d–d ' " LEoNIDAs is
reported to have said in reply to a
Persian offer. “The Spartans die but
never surrender.” And, not content
merely to stave off the enemy attack
to the last possible moment, he even
led his men in a desperate counter-
offensive, as gallant and devoted as
any of which we have record.
We quote but one sample of the
magnificent spirit displayed by our
men throughout this trying operation.
One of them—a typical hoplite—was
told (no doubt by a gentleman of the
same kidney as the writer of the
Spatchcock article) that the Persians
were so numerous that their arrows
would conceal the sun. “Swelp me,
Zeus,” was the ready if somewhat
irreverent retort, “I’m glad to 'ear it.
We can do without ole Apollo in a 'ot
scrap like this 'ere.”
Not only is the Hellene army not
annihilated, it has fought what is
at least a drawn battle, extricated itself
from a peculiarly difficult situation,
and remains intact, ready to give battle
at its own time, on its own ground.
The l’ersians are as far off as ever
from that crushing victory which is

necessitated both by the personal pride
of XERXES and the exigencies of their
strategical position.
For the rest we beg leave to think
that public opinion will do justice to
the brilliant achievement of LEoNIDAs
and his men, and will not permit it
lightly to be forgotten.

clean ; • . -
Doubtless the Germans, who got there
first, -
Looted the best and left the worst.
For the cider's sour and the wine is bad,
And of good clean water there's none
to be had ; -
And as for the beer, 'tis a mixture pale
Of nine parts water and one part ale.
But I know an inn of the good old kind,
Where a creaking signboard swings in
the wind,
With a littlelow doorway upon the quay
And a crazy ladder right down to the sea.
There's a crimson curtain abaft the door
And clean sweet sawdust along the floor,
A broad - shelved mantel of smoke-
stained oak,
And pewter tankards for thirsty folk.
And many a skipper has raised to his lip
The foaming cup of “The Silver Ship,”
And many a weather-defying salt
Has blessed the maltster who watted
the malt.
And if you enter and pay your score
(As I mean to do when I'm back once
more)
And sit and listen and drink your beer
Many marvellous tales you'll hear.
And when the telling at last is done,
And homeward the guests steal one by
one,
You'll thank the Lord for the men that
sail,
But most you'll thank Him for English
ale.
You will seize your stick with a steady
grip,
For no one is drunk at “The Silver
Ship,”
And be in your bed by half-past ten,
Like all good sailors and Christian men.
Of beautiful France the poets sing,
But were I Prince of Everything,
And Lord High Admiral of the Sea,
“The Silver Ship” were enough for me.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, December 4th.-Proceedings
in the House of Commons were over-
shadowed by the announcement in the
Press that the Government was under-
going the process of “alterations and
repairs.”
Question-time passed amid a buzz of
conversation, Members hardly noticing
what took place. Still a faint laugh
rewarded Mr. LYNCH's sarcastic request
for an assurance that whatever hap-
pened in Greece the dynasty would be
preserved; and an equally faint
cheer followed Mr. HARcourt's
refusal, on economic grounds, to
plant potatoes in Hyde Park.
When at last the time arrived
for the PRIME MINISTER to make
his statement he led up to it with
his customary skill. Mr. DILLON
had asked for the name of the
“Food Dictator.” Mr. Asquith
replied, somewhat sharply, that
no such person existed, and added,
“I do not like the word “Dicta-
tor.” The KING, he went on to
say, had approved of the recon-
struction of the Government, but
questions of personnel had better
be deferred “until that process is
—if it is—completed,” and pro-
ceeded to move that the House
should adjourn till Thursday. Mr.
DILLoN preferred Monday, in
order that Irish Members might ~~~~
be able to seek inspiration from
their native soil; and was sup-
ported by Mr. DEVLIN, who
plaintively asked, “What is the
good of keeping us hanging round
London?” but did not specify
whereabouts in Ireland he would
like to hang.
Replying to these objections
Mr. Asquith said he was ready
to leave the date of the ad-
journment to the sense of the
House, but took occasion to observe
that whatever changes were made in
the Government there would be “no
departure in any shape or form
from the policy we have announced
and pursued since the beginning of
the War.” Few, if any, of the Mem-
bers who cheered this pronouncement
foresaw that twenty-four hours later
Mr. Asquith would have ceased to
be Prime Minister.
Before retiring for its little holiday
the House accomplished two or three
useful pieces of work. It passed the
Pensions Bill for one thing, in spite of
an eleventh-hour attempt by a few
Members to turn it upside-down again
by establishing a non-political Board
in place of the proposed Ministry.
Mr. HENDERSON successfully pointed
out that the House had deliberately
decided for the appointment of a single
Minister, who could be hanged, drawn
and quartered if things went wrong.
His complacency in reciting these penal
terrors may have been due to a con-
sciousness that, owing to the new turn
of events, he himself was unlikely to
be the victim.
Tuesday, December 5th-Except on
rare occasions I have not noticed any
overwhelming desire on the part of the
general public to listen to the delibera-
tions of the House of Lords; nor have
THE MAN WITH A PUNCH.
I observed that the presence of a few
reporters has prevented noble orators
on occasion from speaking their minds
with embarrassing frankness. Still,
there are some peers who desire even
greater privacy and freedom than they
enjoy at present, and on their behalf
Lord MIDLEToN inquired whether there
would be any difficulties in the way of
holding a secret session on Thursday.
Lord CREwe intimated that he would
have been delighted in the ordinary
course to take part in such a debate.
The only drawback to it was that for
the moment Ministers were in a state
of suspended animation, and could not
therefore tell the House any secrets.
At the invitation of Lord SALISBURY,
however, he then and there imparted
such information as he possessed regard-
ing the outrages in Athens. Persons
on the brink of dissolution are some-
times gifted with exceptionally acute
perception. The Government, said Lord
CREWE, now feel that the whole question
“must be considered with regard to
naval and military considerations.” It
seems almost a pity that they did not
arrive at that rather obvious conclusion
long ago. -
Thursday, December 7th-Economy,
like charity, should begin at home.
|Although it was announced yesterday
by the Press Bureau that no questions
would be answered and no busi-
ness transacted in the House of
Commons to - day, it does not
seem to have occurred to any-
body in authority that in that
case no order - papers would be
necessary. There they were, just
as usual, forty pages of beauti-
ful and costly paper, comprising
Questions—267 of them—notices

for the adjournment. But even
Mr. GINNELL and Mr. OUTHwalTE
restrained themselves; and in
less than two minutes from Mr.

Members rushed to the Lobby to

AMAZING REVELATIONs.
(With apologies to a certain neutral.)
III.—How I Got ouT.
[The writer has spent five minutes in
Germany, and has obtained unmistakable
evidence from an innkeeper that the country is
perishing of hunger and thirst.]
“I Too in America haf been,” said
the innkeeper. “I will ze language

to do nothing to justify me in advising

it into fluent English):— i
“Listen,” he said, tearing
savagely at an unruly morsel of
sausage. “What are we doing

are we doing there 2"
I played havoc with my
brains for a few seconds, then
resigned. , -
He got up from his seat and
came round the counter. For
the first time I noticed that he
was wearing a brown coat, yel-
low knickerbockers and green
stockings. If the British block-
ade had put an innkeeper to this
shame in just over two years,
how long would it take to make
Germany clothesless 2
Then he made a mystic sign.
Then he hissed the following - sº

“It's your conundrum, old son,” I
retorted. “You solve it.”
“I will tell you. Because, hidden
in a lonely spot near the port of Calais,
lies the entrance to a Channel Tunnel
which, unknown to the world, we built
before the War !”
I bought up the greater part of his
stock of lager.
Then was made known to me the
secret of the German dash for Calais.
“Pouf It was simple,” said the
innkeeper. “We leased some land,

will burst out everywhere 1. On the coast,
and again far inland. While our heroic
warriors erupt in thousands at some
deserted spot on the beach of Margate,
thousands more will be pouring up from
the earth on the grass of the Hyde
Park, or through the floor of their Par-
liament House, at the very feet of Sir
Asquith, perhaps, even as he is telling
the assembled company that Germany
is vanquished. England that day will
find herself without a Parliament. Con-
template it !”
I hid my face in my hands. There
are some things one cannot contem-
plate. -
“Yet another vision,” cried
the innkeeper. “One morning,
as the inhuman Lord GEORGE
sits in the banqueting-hall of his
Welsh castle, toying with the
costly London egg before him "
(a spasm of envy passed across
the speaker's face), “there will
come a crash, the floor will go
up in splinters, and behold ! our
§ soldiers will be binding the King
§ of Wales hand and foot and
sharing his egg among them ' "
Time was flying. Already I had
spent eight and-a-half minutes
in Germany. All the lager was
gone. To remain longer was to
| court disaster—possibly death
from thirst. Accordingly I gave
the mystic sign of departure.
The innkeeper countered, stamp-
|ing four times with his right
foot and mewing like a kitten.
; Opening the door, I stole into
the night, and as I went I heard
the innkeeper get to work on
the second sausage.
Outside I lay flat on my face,
and in the space of a minute
“Give the countersign,” he said.
Instantly I turned a double somer-
sault and hooted like an owl.
“Ach! I can trust you,” he remarked,
and, leaning forward, he whispered in
my ear:—
“We are building an under-sea
tunnel 1 ''
I was aghast. “Give me a lager,” I
moaned. He sold me a lager.
“Think of it !” he went on, brandish-
ing a remnant of sausage in my face.
“A tunnel from Zeebrugge to England
And what a tunnel ! In it are railway
lines, shops, hotels, beer halls, picture
houses, automatic sweet machines, free
libraries. . . . Kolossall ”
I bought two lagers.
“We shall have dozens of these
tunnels,” pursued the innkeeper.
“Some—” his voice sank to an awful
gurgling whisper (this was largely due
to the sausage)—“some are already
‘What do you there?' asked the French.
“We dig for gold,' we replied. ‘Our
scientists have demonstrated beyond
|dispute that gold is here.’ ‘Good,' said
the French. ‘Let us know if you find
any.' We laboured, hiding away our
real purpose behind walls and vast
hoardings. Came a day when the giant
work was done. “We can find no
gold,' we told the French. ‘That is a
pity,' said they. “But never mind.
Better luck next time. Please be good
enough to clear away the mess you've
made.” Gladly we did as they asked,
and soon there remained only a dreary
piece of waste ground. But the tunnel
is there, and three men alone in Ger-
many can find it.
“That is only part of the secret.

traitor. For even if the English know

stepped across the once whitewashed

I do not propose to pass an opinion
on the amazing information I have ob-
tained. Most of it speaks for itself.
Of the economic conditions of Germany
I had practical (and painful) experience

mockery of an inn. My health, indeed,
suffered greatly from my privations in
the country, and I am still unable to

changed man. It will be long before I
recover from the strain of that conver-

carry to my grave.

tinuous meetings without any definite results.
MINISTER, it is officially stated, has arranged to spend the
week-end in the country.
THE NEXT CRISIS.
Monday.—Attended great meeting. Splendid enthusiasm
and complete unanimity. Lord Finsbury, in the Chair,
said, whatever else the War had done it had had at least
one good effect: it had made us one nation. The voice of
faction was hushed and nobody now thought of party. All
individual opinions were now merged in a passionate deter-
mination to win the War. The Government could count
on the united support of a loyal and resolute people. There
were loud cheers, and we all sang “God Save the King.”
Tuesday.—Strange leading article in The Shunter on the
failure of the Government to maintain adequate supply
of bananas. One banana, it seems, is equivalent as food to
a leg of mutton, and the by-products (the skin, etc.) are
quite invaluable for the manufacture of high explosives
and shoe-leather. “The Government,” says The Shunter,
“have dallied with this question far too long. In view of
the critical condition of affairs we declare that no further
delay can be tolerated. We press for the immediate ap-
pºintment of a Banana Board.” The Twilight backs up
The Shunter. It asks what confidence can be placed in a
Government which has neglected so vital a matter? I
quite agree; it is shameful.
Wednesday.—The Daily Hail has a poster, “BANANAs
AND BRAINs.” It says nearly all the present Ministers
must go, so that we may have a Government that will
really do things. It asserts that, owing to the miserable
dilatoriness of Ministers, who have forbidden the Navy to
act, the whole available supply of bananas has been col-
lared by the Germans. Strong letter in The Shunter from
Admiral Petrel. He says he has submitted to the Govern-
ment an infallible plan for smashing the German fleet,
... and, beyond a bare acknowledgment, he has heard no-
thing further. “Quousque tandem,” says The Shunter in a
powerful leading article.
Thursday.-It is announced that two Banana groups
have been formed in the House of Commons, one Con-
servative and the other Liberal. Both have appointed
deputations to interview the PRIME MINISTER. The Daily
Hail comes out with a poster, “CoALITION or CoALHoLE,”
and publishes ten strong letters from Clergymen and
Justices of the Peace attacking the Government. Ministers,
it says, are used up and had better make up their minds
to go.

Gazette deprecates this. The essence of a Coalition, it

Friday. There is a political crisis of the first magnitude.
All the Ministers, it seems, have threatened at one time or
another to resign and affairs are in a state of high tension.
The Coalition is said to be doomed. The last Cabinet
Council broke up in dreadful disorder, and Ministers were ||
with difficulty prevented from flying at one another's
throats. The Banana groups have been holding con-

There is a rumour that he has
in reality been captured and confined in the Tower.
Saturday.—The Ministry has been entirely reconstructed
from top to bottom, and a Banana Dictator has at last
been appointed. We all breathe again and the War can
now go on with the assistance of a completely united nation.

THE IRREGULAR READER.
[A writer in The Westminster Gazette recalls the protest of John
HILL BURTON, the Scots historian, against regular courses of reading,
his belief being that better results were attained by the simultaneous
study of serious and entertaining authors.]
AN eminent author, while earnestly pleading
For all that could fruitfully widen our range,
Denounces a course of continuous reading
And favours the plan of precipitous change;
Recommending, e.g., as a means of digesting
Great GIBBox's profuse and voluminous tomes,
Concurrent perusal of BYRON's arresting
Don Juan, the gayest of pomes.
Though my wits are not great—they incline to be
muddy—
They jump with the wits of this eminent man,
For I've always endeavoured to lighten the study
Of solid and strenuous works by his plan;
And even at school, when preparing my Caesar
I found I could seldom or never say no,
When that arduous author had set me a teaser,
To the lure of the stories of PoE.
The course that from youth I've consistently followed
Cannot be commended to every mind,”
For the strange sort of sandwich I've frequently
swallowed
Might possibly jar on the ultra refined;
For instance, some people who like bread and stilton
Would shy in disgust at the head of a sheep;
And to alternate MARIE CoRELLI and MILTON
Is a step that is rather too steep.
Still there's much to be said for resolving to take on
The lurid along with the sober and sane,
For I never thought more of the Essays of BAcos
Than when I concurrently studied HALL CAINE :
And there's no better method to test the assertions
Of those who pronounce Mrs. GAsKELL effete
Than that of conducting alternate excursions
To Cranford and Sinister Street.
So again when I listen to critics who starkly
Declare that Sir WALTER and DickFNs are “rot,”
I “synthesize.” Boz with the good Mrs. BARCLAY,
The bountiful Baroness ORCzY with Scott;
Still I think that the spiciest olla podrida,
The most temerarious mental mixed grill
I ever consumed was the passion of OUIDA
Combined with the Logic of MILL.
The sedulous student, intent on perusing
One book at a time with the fewest of stops,
Is patently blind to the value of choosing
A method allowing of changes and chops;
Let him hold, an he will, that it's always essential
To march to the goal by a uniform way;
I prefer to advance by the method tangential
Of mixing the grave with the gay.
More Scandal about Queen Elizabeth.
From an article in The Hibbert Journal entitled, “Are
we Better or Happier than our Fathers?”:—
“Are not the very paupers in the workhouses—refuges unknown
to our forefathers—provided, as a matter of course, with appliances
such as Queen Elizabeth on her throne could not command? It is
improbable that this great lady, in the whole course of her long and
healthy life, ever had a bath.”

—-º-Brantºsell
IN THE TRANSPORT.
ARE THE MULES HURT 2 ''
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE many readers who remember with pleasure KATHARINE
TYNAN's former book of memories, Twenty-Five Years, will
be glad to know that its deserved success has encouraged her
to a sequel, which she calls The Middle Years (Constable).
It is full of just the same happily haphazard recollections
of persons and events in the literary, political and social
worlds that made the charm of the earlier volume.
This
covers the twenty years from 1891 to 1911, and deals there-
fore with much that in point of actual time is not so far
from us to-day, only indeed round the last corner (but
how sharp the turning since') and still clear in memory.
Naturally, it is before all else an Irish book. YEATs, A. E.,
John O'MAHONY, and the WYNDHAMs are the chief char-
acters to fill its vivacious chapters; very present too is
a Celtic spirit that shows itself now in a vividly pictur-
esque turn of phrase, now in an almost disconcertingly
calm acceptance of what the Saxon would call the super-
natural. Good stories abound, and many happy little
character-portraits, amongst which I liked as well as any
a casual mention of the cook's husband who was “so
travelled that he never would call France abroad.” One
hopes that he has lived to see this refusal become the
common use. A most companionable book.
Only a deep conviction about a great wrong to be set
right could have carried Mr. MAURICE HEwlett through
his epic, The Song of the Plow (HEINEMANN). Hodge, dis-
possessed and ignored since the Conquest even to this day,
is his theme, based on the generalisation that the governed
classes and the governing have been and still are of different
blood; the latter “even now preponderatingly Latin-
French with Scandinavian admixture,” the former British
with Saxon. I wonder if it is quite as simple as that.
A suggestive hypothesis anyway. The workmanship of
this rhymed history is a tour de force of technical skill.
Adroitly varied rhythms and an ingenious and not too rigid
rhyme scheme, which demands throughout the difficult
feat of the triple rhyme, give a singular effect of movement
to the whole. Passages of a rich colour and a passionate
eloquence ennoble a worthy theme. There is not a dull
canto in it. Please take it from me that it is a literary
event by no means to be missed by any of the discerning.
In a review of a recent light book of Mr. HEwleTT's I
allowed myself a foolish gibe at the detachment in war-time
of writers of delicate trifles. I regretted too late, and now
feel still more repentant under this complete rebuke of six
thousand fine and serious lines.
Has it ever given you a queer upside-down feeling to
look at a book for children, at the illustrations especially,
and to reflect in how many minds some confused impression
of them is destined to remain as the dim background to
memory, so that, years afterwards perhaps, a chance echo
of their colour will have power mysteriously to pierce the
grown-up heart? One thinks the artists who fashion
nursery pictures should set about it with prayer and fast-
‘ing, so great is their responsibility. Some such idea as
this came to me over the very delightful illustrations to
Pilot and Other Stories (MACMILLAN). These are the work
of Mr. H. J. Ford, and in my opinion are models for their
kind, with lots of satisfactory colour and plenty of people
actively engaged in understandable pursuits. As for the
tales (which by rights I should of course have mentioned

first) they prove their author, Mr. HARRY PLUNKET GREENE,
to have a real sympathy both with children and animals,
and to know exactly how the former would wish the latter
to talk. Pilot himself is a rare dog at dialogue. Moreover
(a great point) the comedy note is agreeably sustained
throughout. Recalling the anguish wrung from my own
youthful sympathies by that quite intolerable tale of Gelert,
I am always a little apprehensive about dog-fiction for the
young. But fortunately Pilot neither rescues anyone nor
is he in any way misunderstood. So a place for him on
your Christmas list may be reserved with safety.
It was an unfortunate trait in the otherwise estimable
character of the (technically) “good "fairy Malvina that
she had a passion for change—as Mr. JEROME. K. JEROME
puts it—“in other people.” In the days of King ARTHUR
and the Round Table she not only converted an elderly
tin-mine owner into a nightingale, “necessitating a change
of habits which must have T. —-
been singularly irritating to a 2
business man,” but played the
*—º
same trick on Prince Gerbot, º -
a man with powerful friends,

suffers from comparison, which -
it can hardly help inviting, E=
with Mr. WELLs's Wonderful

stories in the volume, added as
makeweights. Even in those
distant days when he broke
like a young colt—or like a
male Malvina—into the quiet
field of English humour, shock-
. and disturbing the more
sober and conservative with his -
rollickings, there ran through Mr. JEROME's farcical out-
bursts a certain vein of wistful dreaminess which his public
valued almost as much as his fun. It is this sort of thing
which nowadays, when Time has mellowed him, he does
best, and the short stories in his latest book are excellent
samples of his serious manner. One of them, indeed, The
Fawn Gloves, a little tragic episode with its roots deep down
in human nature, is a masterpiece. Mr. WELLs—to drag
him in again—might, if given the same theme, have handled
it as well, but no one writing to-day could have done it
better. Almost equally good is The Street of the Blank
Wall. All these short stories are of the past, recalling, as
Mr. JERoME's best work generally does, the brave days of
the nineties, of the Idler and hansom cabs and reputations
in the making. -

simply and modestly described as “a tale of uncommon
things.” To which let me add that it would be difficult
to find, even among the gallant deeds of this War, a finer
courage in the face of constant danger than has been
shown by these brave women. After various and thrilling
experiences they eventually established themselves in their
cellar-house at Pervyse, and such splendid work did they
accomplish there that when in March, 1915, a decree was
passed that no women should be allowed in the firing-line
an exception was made in their favour. When at length
they were shelled out of their original home they only
moved to the other end of the village and continued to
attend to the wounded, sick and hungry Belgian soldiers.
But there was no rest for them, and soon they had again to
move further afield, and so the extraordinary story goes on.
No place, however, appealed to them so strongly as Pervyse,
and towards the end of last year they returned there to
continue their work, the usefulness of which the KING of
THE BELGIANs has recognised

| There was just a moment
when I wondered if Mr. H.

in the Field (1915-16),” was
going to indulge in more abuse
of the Huns than is necessary
in such a book as The Unbroken
Line (SMITH, ELDER). We all
know our Bosch by this time,
and most of us have the same
opinion of him, but to express
there are simply no adequate
words left to apply to him. Mr.
- ALLEN, however, quickly pulled
himself together. In a series of vivid chapters he has dealt
with each section of the line held by the French, and has
given us an heroic account of the courage, cheerfulness and
camaraderie of our invincible Allies, and their gifts, not
less admirable, of organisation and resource. Mr. ALLEN
seems to have enjoyed the most generous facilities. When
soldiers give you a description of a fight on the spot
where it actually took place, half of your own battle as a
correspondent is won. The other half of the victory is
Mr. ALLEN's own, the fruit of a sound style. I felicitate
him on his success and at the same time make my bow to
the courteous French officers who helped him to achieve it.
THAT IS THE

BETH MANN-Holl, WEG talks very privately to himself.
(The author of the following lines assumes that the German peace
proposals did not emanate from the CHANCELLOR, but from another
and more august brain less gifted with psychological intelligence and
a dawning sense of humour.]
WELL, I have done the bidding of my Master
And it has proved a frost; I knew it would.
I told him, if we posed as saints in plaster,
That sort of silly game would do no good;
I said his patent bluff
Would be regarded as a bit too tough.
I knew the hemispheres would rock with laughter
At unction which recalls the crocodile,
Who takes a human meal and, shortly after,
Turns on the tap and slobbers down the Nile;
We spread it on so thick
That even neutrals saw right through the trick.
With blood upon our hands of little nations
Butchered to make our German joy-bells peal,
How could we hope by pious protestations
To get humanity to do a deal”
I said the damnéd spot
Would need some washing first; but he thought not.
I am not squeamish, no, nor yet pale-blooded,
Nor trained upon humanitarian tracts;
I trust that I'm a true Hun; yet I've studied
Sufficient history to know some facts;
And England, I should say,
Won't take her toll in words; that's not her way.
And, then, our conquering air—that crowning error;
Our noisy talk of being topmost dog;
The KAISER painted as a holy terror;
I (Hollweg) masking as a Golliwog —
Was this a likely touch
To move a proud and gallant foe 2 Not much.
Nobody brags except to hide his weakness;
And, when we boast about our bulging fat,
Our booty (corn and oil) that makes for sleekness,
Is any fool imposed upon by that 2
Men judge, from talk so thin,
A corresponding void beneath the skin.
And, even though our words were not mere vapour,
How should the enemy, knowing all about .
Our penchant in regard to scraps of paper,
Be taking any 2 Till we're down and out,
Our chance to strike a treaty
Seems, like our commissariat, far from meaty.
As for the faith our people to the State owes

If Peace ignores his nod,

DISCIPLINE.
WE were sitting round the fire, my two sisters, my brother
Ernest with his damaged leg on a rest, and myself with
my arm in a sling. It was all very cosy and pleasant.
“At the beginning of the War,” Ernest began, “when I
was a humble private soldier . . .”
“No, Ernest,” I said firmly, “not humble. A private
soldier, yes; but humble, very emphatically no. Your
attitude was one of amused condescension, not of humility.
Never that.”
“At the beginning of the War,” Ernest repeated, “when
I was a private soldier, and I still hold that I was, com-
pared with Victor"—I am Victor—“a very humble one
indeed, no incident so impressed me with the discipline
of the Regiment as the incident of the newsvendor.”
“You speak like a book, my dear Ernest,” I said.
“Like an instructive and rather uninteresting book. But
let us have the incident of the newsvendor.” -
“Among the recruits who arrived at the Depôt at that
time,” he continued, “was a fine big chap—he had to be,
of course, to pass into the Regiment—who had made a
living by selling papers in the London streets. That
peculiar throaty cry of ‘All the winners,' which is affected
by the best newsvendors, had been brought by him to a
high state of perfection. Other qualities are required in
the Regiment, however, besides physique and the throaty
cry, and in these the newsvendor was somewhat to seek.
For the career of a newsvendor does not instil those
rigid ideas of discipline which are the life-blood of the
Regiment.” -
“Not quite so much about the Regiment,” I put in.
I'm in another Regiment myself. “Get on with the in-
cident.” -
“Discipline," Ernest went on unmoved, “is not, as I
say, the strong point of newsvendors. That is what
brought him up against the Master Cook.”
Ernest paused for effect.
“You Jºnow the sort of person the Regimental Master
Cook is,” he said. “Well, the newsvendor spoke to him.”
“He didn't ' " I said.
“He did,” said Ernest. “It was like this. The recruits
on arrival were served out with a blanket and a small basin
for their food. The newsvendor came along with his, and
saw the Master Cook standing in the middle of the yard.
“‘Hi, guv'nor,’ he called out cheerily, “what do I do with
these 'ere?' -
“The Master Cook ran a sort of machine-gun eye over him.
Then very solemnly he called up a Tommy standing near.
“With a jerk of the head towards the newsvendor,
| who at length was beginning to grasp that he must have
done something unusual, the Master Cook said:
“‘Tell him who I am."
“‘The Master Cook.’
“‘Now tell him what he is /'"
Ernest paused for so long that my younger sister said,
“Well ?”
“That's all,” said Ernest.
“Aren't you going to finish it 2 " she said.
But I thought Ernest was wise. Expurgated editions
are always unsatisfactory.

SEATED in your comfortable club,

drawing-room, Madam, you may smile
pityingly at the idea of a mascot saving
anybody's life. “What will be, will be,”
you say to yourself (or in Italian to your
friends), “and to suppose that a charm
round the neck of a soldier will divert a
German shell is ridiculous.” But out
there, through the crumps, things look
otherwise. -
Common had sat on the mantelpiece
at home. An ugly little ginger dog,
with a bit of red tape for his tongue
and two black beads for his eyes, he
viewed his limited world with an air of
innocent impertinence very attractive
to visitors. Common he looked and
Common he was called, with the Chris-
tian name of Howard for registration.
For six months he sat there, and no
doubt he thought that he had seen all
that there was to see of the world when
the summons came which was to give
him so different an outlook on life.
For that summons meant the break-
ing-up of his home. Master was going
wandering from trench to trench, Mis-
tress from one person's house to an-
other person's house. She no doubt
would take Common with her; or per-
haps she couldn't be bothered with an
ugly little ginger dog, and he would
be stored in some repository, boarded
out in some Olympic kennel. “Or do
He looked very wistful that last
morning, so wistful that Mistress
couldn't bear it, and she slipped him
in hastily between the revolver and the
boracic powder, “Just to look after
you,” she said. So Common came
with me to France.
His first view of the country was at
Rouen, when he sat at the entrance to
my tent and hooshed the early morn-
ing flies away. His next at a village
behind the lines, where he met stout
fellows of “D” Company and took the
centre of the table at mess in the apple
orchard; and moreover was introduced
to a French maiden of two, with whom,
at the instigation of the seconds in the
business—her mother and myself—a
prolonged but monotonous conversa-
tion in the French tongue ensued, Com-
mon, under suitable pressure, barking
idiomatically, and the maiden, carefully
prompted, replying with the native
for “Bow-wow.” A pretty greenwood
scene beneath the apple-trees, and in
any decent civilisation the great adven-
ture would have ended there. But
Common knew that it was not only
for this that he had been brought out,
and that there was more arduous work
to come. -
Once more he retired to the valise,
for we were making now for a vill—
for a heap of bricks near the river;
you may guess the river. It was about
this time that I made a little rhyme
for him :—
“There was a young puppy called Howard,
Who at fighting was rather a coward;
He never quite ran
When the battle began,
But he started at once to bow-wow hard.”
A good poet is supposed to be superior
to the exigencies of rhyme, but I am
afraid that in my case Common's repu-
tation had to be sacrificed to them.
To be lyrical over anybody called
Howard Common without hinting that ||
he—well, try for yourself. Anyhow it
was a lie, as so much good poetry is.
There came a time when valises
were left behind and life for a fort-
night had to be sustained on a pack.
One seems to want very many things,
but there was no hesitation about
Common's right to a place. So he
came to see his first German dug-out
and to get a proper understanding of
this dead bleached land and the great
work which awaited him there. It
was to blow away shells and bullets

when they came too near the master
in whose pocket he sat.
That he was successful you see; but
I think that the feat in which he takes
most pride was performed one very
early summer morning. A telephone
line had to be laid, and, for reasons
obvious to Common, rather rapidly. It
was laid safely—a mere nothing to him
by this time. But when it was joined
up to the telephone in the front line
then he realised that he was called
upon to be not only a personal mascot,
but a mascot to the battalion, and he
sat himself upon the telephone and
called down a blessing on that cable, so
that it remained whole for two days and
a night when by all the rules it should
have been in a thousand pieces. “And
even if I didn't really do it all myself,”
he said, “anyhow I did make some of
the men in the trench smile a little
that morning, and there wasn't so very
much smiling going on just then, you
know.”
After that morning he lived in my
pocket, sometimes sniffing at an empty
pipe, sometimes trying to read letters
from Mistress which joined him every
day. We had gone North to a more
gentlemanly part of the line, and his
duties took but little of his time, so
that anything novel, like a pair of
pliers or an order from the Director
of Army Signals, was always welcome.
To begin with he took up rather more
than his fair share of the pocket, but
he rapidly thinned down. Alas! in
the rigours of the campaign he also
lost his voice; and his little black collar,
his only kit, disappeared.
Then, just when we seemed settled
for the winter, we were ordered South
again. Common knew what that meant;
a busy time for him. We moved down
slowly, and he sampled billet after billet,
but we arrived at last and sat down to
wait for the day.
And then he began to get nervous.
Always he was present when the opera-
tions were discussed; he had seen all
the maps; he knew exactly what was
expected of us. And he didn't like it.
“It's more than a fellow can do,”
he said; “at least to be certain of.
I can blow away the shells in front
and the shells from the right, but if
Master's map is correct we're going
to get enfiladed from the left as well,
and one can't be everywhere. This
wants thinking about.”
So he dived head downwards into
the deepest recesses of my pocket and
abandoned himself to thought. A little
later he came up with a smile. . . .
Next morning I stayed in bed and the
doctor came. Common looked over his
shoulder as he read the thermometer.

SHIELD-GLINTS ON SALAMIs.
By Rudiardos Kipliggos.
(Copyright in Peloponnesus.)
OUT of the many-oared heart of things
certain plain details emerge. . .
It appears that one of our triremes
—whom we will call Strepitos—had a
spare moment or so wherein to give
herself a shake and a lick-over and to
make quite, quite sure that the benches
being awash was a slight inconvenience
in no wise impairing her fighting effi-
ciency, and therefore not to be worried
about. Wherefore she bethought her-
self and argued thus:–
“Biffing straight ahead, as per and
in accordance with the text-book,” said
Strepitos, “doesn't always pay—not by
a long javelin-cast. For why? Be-
cause a nose-to-nose encounter, with
laudable intent to shear neatly through
three banks of, say, port-side oars
with one fine keen-coppered fight-
ing beak, too often means that your
three banks of port-side oars are like-
wise and in the same rasping, splinter-
ing fraction of a minute sheared through
with equal efficiency by the fighting
beak of the enemy. Which was not
included in the original scheme of
action. But,” murmured Strepitos,
turning tentatively on her tail, “sup-
posin' I approach this happy Barbarian
bilge-gargler and take my chance of
either getting him amidships at a fair-
an’-healthy right-angle or of being side-
stepped and flank-smitten myself in
passing, as it were 2"
Now “approach " implied a heart-
tearing half-minute bucket at sixty or
so, and “bilge - gargler” one of His
Median-and-Persian Majesty's ships of
the line, no less. But in that tight
squelching mass of grape-skins in a
wine-press which was Salamis even so
sniffable a chance as this rarely offered
itself, and—Strepitos took it. (They
make up their minds quickly in the
Oar-and-Cushion Service.)
“And what,” I asked, throwing my
arm affectionately round the neck of
the bright beardless Hupo, who was
my informant, “what—precisely—hap-
pened—then *"
“Oh,” he replied, as he disengaged
himself (quite carelessly), “we went

And that was all. The Oar-and-

razoring beak, the hideous broadside
heave and heel of the aforesaid bilge-
gargler, the perfectly effective smashing,
smothering, crunching and creaming
of everything and all things as Strepitos
bumped generously over what may
have been the Barbarian's garboard
strake, and the exact word which the
enemy's third bank 'midships starboard
benches said when they suddenly feath-
ered-under and the wet sea walked in at
them—of all this they tell you nothing.
They leave you to paint your perfectly
futile word picture of it in your own
particular way. And one does.
The deeper onechisels into the various
inscriptions and records, the more one
finds one's own pet theories proven
before one's eyes. As thus:—
Strapha-let us call her Strapha-
she was a highly obsolete old pente-
conter who had no business in the show
at all, only—well, when the odds are
three to one against you, you are apt to
scrape together everything that floats,
with a prayer to Poss that when it
punctually ceases so to do it will at least
sink handsomely in the fairway and
take the keel out of something big on
the other side. Now there is one and
the same boon and blessing in burning
your boats and in swallowing the fact
that your boat is about to be quite in-
evitably put down under you. You
know just exactly how you stand and
where you have no intention of stand-
ing. So this is that which is inscribed
concerning Strapha :-
“I hung about looking for a suitable
trireme to which I might transfer.
Having noted one, I at once attacked,
and, as my ship went down in accord-
ance with ea pectations, boarded and
captured the enemy, and was thus in a
condition to join the general attack.”
I have mentioned Poss. Now Poss
(who may be merely Poseidon to people
attending comfortable temples ashore)
is the great god to whom the triremes
pray. He is not mentioned in the
original edition of naval orders, but the
recipients of these add him thereto
personally and unofficially, saying, “I
am to go such-and-such and do thus-
and-thus—if Poss.”
Throughout this perfectly plain ex-
position of certain of the less obvious
phases of the Big Scrap, I have en-
deavoured to strike one particular note,
inimitable, peculiar, clear as caste. We
are so compassed about in these days
with special articles and impressions
that it is well to emphasize this.
Another Impending Apology.
“In view of rumours, published and un-
published, associating his name with the Gov-
ernment now in process of formation by Mr.
Lloyd George, Lord Northcliffe was last night
asked if he would fake a statement on the
subject.”—Worcester Daily Times.

Mr. Punch had always supposed this
excellent establishment was intended
for the Buffs. -
From the rules of football as pub-
lished by an Indian firm —
“If a goalkeeper has been hanged without
the referee being notified, and the new goal-
keeper handles the ball within the penalty
area, a penalty kick must be awarded.”
Even so the new goal-keeper gets off
more lightly than his predecessor.

CHRISTMAS IN WAR-TIME.
TIME was I bade the youngsters gather round me,
When Christmas snows lay thick on bough and bole,
| And infants, who at other seasons found me
Rather a bore, now voted me top-hole;
The willing slave of Childhood's sweet dominion
I called a truce to all the cares that vex,
Till even babies gurgled their opinion
That there were points to Uncle Pontifex.
Largely I flung the doors of friendship open ;
“Enter, my buds,” I cried, “the place is yours.”
They did; and when they broke my priceless Copen-
hagen and brought their guinea-pigs indoors
And tore the drawing-room carpet to a tatter
And scratched the grand piano's rosewood lid,
I simply said, “My dears, it doesn't matter,"
And, strange enough to say, it never did.
I spread my board with every toothsome viand,

fusion all over the House, the Brothers | Member himself to go and cheer them | Lord CREwB, whose funereal mien sug-
seats to accommodate his gigantic
bulk, provided a typical contrast.
While Brother CATHCART (Orkney and
Shetland) occupied his usual acre-
age on the Ministerial side,
Brother EUGENE (Clack-
mannan and Kinross) had
pegged out a claim on the
opposite benches. Find-
ing, however, that the
adjacent plots were still
in the possession of his
hereditary political foes he
suddenly decided that he
would be happier in his
old home, and re-migrated
amid hearty cheers.
There being 326 Ques.
tions on the Paper and
very few Ministers to an-
swer them, the SPEAKER
wisely decided to postpone
the whole lot. Mr. BonAR
LAw, the new Leader of
the House, proposed an adjournment
till Thursday, when Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
would be able to state the policy he in-
tended to pursue. - -
Mr. McKENNA hoped “my right hon.
friend, if he will allow me to call him
so,” would consent to put off the state-
ment until Tuesday, in order that his
other right hon. friend, “the Leader
of the Liberal Party,” now down with
influenza, might be in his place.
The House was quick to note the
challenge conveyed in these carefully
chosen phrases. “But, oh, beware my
country when my country grows polite.”
The attitude of “the Liberal Party”
towards the new Administration may
be one of benevolent neutrality, but that
is an expression which at Westminster,
as at Athens, is capable of more than
a single interpretation.
The only section in the House that
preserves its ancient landmarks is the
Nationalist. But even the Irishmen
have been thrown a little off their
balance by recent events. Mr. DILLON,
appearing in the unexpected rôle of
guardian of the British Constitution,
demanded an explanation of the
“wholly revolutionary system "set up
by the new PRIME MINISTER, under
which Ireland had for the first time no
representative in the Cabinet.
For this he was sternly rebuked by
Mr. GINNELL, who vehemently asserted
that Ireland never had and did not want
a representative in the British Govern-
ment. What she did want was a Home

on that account. On the contrary he
was kind enough to give Mr. BonAR
LAw some good advice on the elimina-
tion of enemy influence from our midst.
Thereby he earned a trouncing from
Mr. PRINGLE, whose claims have also
been overlooked, but who bears dis-
appointment less equably. His sar-
casms at the expense of the new Min-
istry were listened to with some im-
patience, but the House was delighted
with his unpremeditated description
of it as “an automatic Government,”
a phrase conjuring up visions of a

since the day when he left
Mr. GLADSTONE's Govern-
ment in 1881, sat below
the Gangway on the Min-
isterial side. On the
Woolsack was Sir Robert
FINLAY, not yet ennobled,
but a dignified figure none
the less. He had the
unique experience of shak-
ing hands with no fewer
than four of his prede-
cessors. It is reported that
Lord HALSBURY would
have been quite willing,
despite his ninety - one
years, to bury the hatchet
of 1909 and join Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE in his old
capacity, but decided on
reflection to “give young FINLAY a
chance.”
Thursday, December 14th. — Again
the House had to meet without the
presence of either the new or the
late PRIME MINISTER. There is nothing
“diplomatic" about the illness which
has laid them aside. It has, indeed, a
military flavour, being a variety of
“trench fever.”
In moving a Vote of Credit for four
hundred millions Mr. BonAR LAw made
a successful début as Chancellor of the
Exchequer. In concision and clearness
and courage his speech rivalled those
delivered by Mr. AsquitH on similar
occasions. Though the figures of the
War-expenditure are increasingly gi-
gantic — £5,700,000 a day—and will
by the end of March have reached a
total of four thousand millions, he
described them as “colossal but not
appalling,” and was confident that,
financially, this country could last the
COUlrse.
The barest allusion was made to the
German peace-proposals. As they had
not yet reached the British Government,
Mr. LAw thought the less said about
them the better. Still he permitted
himself to quote the recent statement
of the late PRIME MINISTER, that the
Allies would require “adequate repara-
tion for the past and adequate security
for the future.” That, he added amid
loud cheers, was still the determination
of His Majesty's Government. -
This tactful allusion completely molli-

fied Mr. McKENNA. He had nothing
but praise for his successor's speech,
though he hoped that his picture of the
financial position was a little darker
than was necessary. His own estimate
of the present cost of the War was five
and a-half millions a day.
The ensuing debate was notable for a
strangely popular speech by Mr. OUTH-
waite, who briefly announced that he
would postpone his remarks on the
peace-negotiations till next week. Mr.
LYNCH would have done well to follow
his example, and refrain from making
an attack upon the British Commander-
in-Chief in France. His ineffectual
fires were extinguished, appropriately,
by Captain SHAw, who declared that
the outstanding feature at the Front
was mud, and implied that, to throw
more of it at Sir Doug LAs HAIG, who
was trusted by every soldier in France,
from the highest to the lowest, was
both impertinent and superfluous.
Mr. KENNEDY Jox Es, the elect of
Hornsey, took his seat to-day. So
much has been said in certain journals
regarding the importance of his return
that it was half expected that he
would make a triumphal entry on Mr.
PEMBERTON IBILLING's broken- kneed
charger. But modesty prevailed, and
he walked up the floor just like any

He started briskly across the road.
I saw the driver who had fouled bearing

He glanced back and then ran for it.
There was a demoniacal chuckle from
the driver and a yell, “’E's not looking

HE closed the door. They were alone.
She drifted languorously across the little
intime room and wilted into a chair.
He bent towards her, proudly, eagerly,
fingering the instrument with his slim
dexterous hands. -
“What would you like most?” he mur-
mured. “Something of KREISLER's 2"
And almost before she could speak
he had begun, and she was listening in
a rapture of attention—listening with
her soul, with her eyes, with her heart,
with her muff, with everything. Then
abruptly she stopped him.
“No,” she cried hoarsely, “not that.
It is too much.”
In a moment he was all sympathy
and the intricate harmonies jerked into
silence. Silence. The room ached with
it. She could hear his wrist-watch
ticking and the soles of her American
shoes warping in the tense atmosphere.
Then with a low moan the music began
again. “Pale Hands I Loved beside
the Shalimar,” it sobbed as he bent
passionately to his instrument. Vaguely
in a dream she drew off her gloves
and clasped her hands before her, work-
ing back the cuticles in a transport of
ecstasy . . .
It was over. But swiftly, imperi-
ously, she spoke of another melody
and in a moment the room was ringing
with it. Here was one born to com-
mand, and gladly he obeyed, standing
beside her chair, tall and impending,
while she drooped and listened.
At last the instrument ceased to speak.
Her brain was a chaos of familiar airs,
tingling with associations. She swam
to the door; he side-stroked after her.
He was there, opening it for her, stand-
ing aside; he was wonderful.
Together they passed out into a
world of buying and selling, of Christ-
mas bargains and economies. People
looked at them, and some smiled, but
she saw nothing, only it seemed that in
a trance she was murmuring the names
of melodies—“Pale Hands,” “Parted,”
“The Bing Boys.”
She languished towards him: “You
may send me those; and a box of
needles for the records.”

“WELL,” said Francesca, “we’ve discussed everything.”
“Yes,” I said, “we’ve set everybody right. We've won
the War. We've planned out at least two alternative
Governments—one to suit. The Times and the other to be
smiled upon by The Morning Post; and now there's
nothing more left to do except to go to bed.”
“Have we really got as far as that?” said Francesca.
“What's the time by the clock?”
“Clocks,” I said, “don’t matter in the country—at least
not so far as bed-going is concerned. One goes to bed
when one feels inclined to without looking at the clock.”
“Well then,” she said, “I don't feel inclined to for a
minute or two. I've got a notion there was something I
wanted to say to you and that I haven't managed to say
it vet.”
*You don't often feel like that, do you?
generally manage, don't you?”
“You needn't,” she said, “be anxious about it. It won't
sap my health. Still, I should like to remember it.” .
“How can you expect to remember if you don't do the
things that abolish forgetfulness? Come, come ! Lean

hard as you can and tap it three or four times with the

“And I shall follow you,” I said, “with Rufus; and we
must carry with us a sofa, or else they won't feel at home,

“I call it giving the show away to the Germans,” she said.

“Right,” she said; “I’ll be off to bed,” and away she
went, taking Rummie with her.
After she had left I don't quite know what happened. I
seemed to be in the Bakerloo Tube with Rufus, who growled
because the conductor said “Peddington | Peddington " " in
a loud voice with a Russian accent. The Conductor then
became a bull and snorted at Rufus. “Dogs,” he said, “are
six a penny, but there's a discount on taking only one.”
Rufus bit him in the nose, and the carriage became a cattle-
market full of rams' horns, but with no signs of any cattle.
I was aware of terrific but undefined dangers, through which
Rufus led me safely, wagging his tail. Next I knocked at
a black door studded with iron nails. It was opened by my
Cambridge bedmaker, whom—though I knew her to have
been dead nearly twenty years—I had expected to see.
“Tell the Dog-Controller,” I said, “that I'm waiting.” The
door rolled back and I found myself with Rufus in the
Tower of London. The headsman was ready, but he could
not decapitate me because Rufus would insist on getting in
the way. At last he gave it up and threw away the axe
and asked me to take it out in cigarettes. Rufus then led
me home, barking loudly in triumph.

ness for its own sake, which has been the ruin of so many
realists (now and again in these later pieces I have fancied
him in a little danger from this), and he might well attain
a position among the big people. I look forward now to
snatching a fearful joy from a long novel by his vitriolic
but stimulating pen. That should be a literary event; and
I feel sure that such a heroine as, for example, the lady in
the present volume, who “ had much earth in the crevices
of her face,” is capable of inspiring me with more than a
fragmentary interest.
Let me commend to you very warmly Germanism from
Within (CoNSTABLE), by A. D. McLAREN, an Australian
resident in the enemy country for some years before the
declaration of war, followed by three months of precarious
liberty in Berlin and some weary months at Ruhleben. It
is the work of an intelligent and open-minded observer who
is able to give the enemy full credit for what is good in his
system and his achievement. It differs much from those
many books written on Germany from without or by the
sprightly traveller and the T - -
learned don. The author
has studied the phenomena
of Deutschtum not only
through the standard and
current literature of the
country, with which his
book shows wide acquaint-
ance, but in the streets, the
universities, the churches.
It is not a tidy book, and
perhaps Mr. McLAREN too
easily falls into phrases like
“All history teaches that.”
But the hasty condition of
its compilation (it contains
much pre-War writing
which is of the greatest
value) and composition ac-
count for the untidiness;
and his obvious candour and
freedom from venom (with
absence of method) give
his essentially unsparing
correctly academic treatise might well miss. As an
Australian he has some criticisms to offer on our national
life—amateurishness, self-deception, lack of a serious end
in education, indolent business direction, self-sufficiency—
which we cannot resent because we are making them
upon ourselves in the bitterness of our hearts. An honest,
manly, temperate and informing book.
Mr. HUGH F. SPENDER has now followed the example
of his elder brother, HAROLD, and added the writing of
fiction to his other literary accomplishments. In fact he
has done what he can never do again: he has written his first
novel. Its title is Thé Machine (NASH), and it is of the usual
length and of more than usual promise, so that I can honestly
congratulate Mr. SPENDER on his success. At first I thought
that his hero, Rupert, was to be submitted to the minute
and exhaustive treatment in favour with Mr. Compton
MACKENZIE, but Mr. SPENDER soon breaks away from this
method. Rupert is plunged into the machine of party
politics and party journalism, only to discover, as others
have discovered before him, that a conscience is esteemed
a nuisance and that high principles are sometimes incom-
patible with worldly success. Rupert goes through many
vicissitudes, including an ante-war visit to Germany, during

indictment of the Prussian system a force which a more
which his wife—he has, of course, married the wrong
woman—becomes involved in the toils of the German
espionage system. A lurid English peer, Lord Vanderton,
is the chief figure in this painful episode. But I must not
give away Mr. SPENDER's story, which is written in a brisk
and workmanlike style and should be widely read.
Have you ever, in the course of your studies in romantic
fiction, been tempted to regret the handicap so often im-
posed upon the hero by his obligation to do nothing in
the slightest degree unbecoming 2 If so, you will share
my cheerful sense of emancipation over The Gamesters
(METHUEN), of which both hero and heroine are refreshingly
free from this impediment. They are brother and sister,
quaintly named Adam and Eve de Ros, architects of their
own fortunes in the troubled Europe of the early eighteenth
century, professional gamblers and adventurers. A pretty
pair, daring, fantastically humorous, and wholly without
scruple, one follows them delightedly through every kind
of hazard, till their lack of virtue is finally rewarded by a
- double wedding and pre-
sumable happiness ever
after. Incidentally, the fact
that most of their escapades
take place in Prussia gives
us an interesting glimpse
into the past of a detestable
country, which subsequent
events have lifted tempor.
arily into undeserved pro-
minence. We see it first
under the agreeable sway
of old FREDERIC WILLIAM,
engaged as usual in a brawl
with his Crown Prince, that
“monkey possessed by a
fiend.” One observes in
passing that history has a
trick of repeating herself.
Apart however from his
shrewd study of HoHEN-
zoLLERN notorieties, Mr.
H. C. BAILEY has told his
- tale of adventures with a
sparkle and a gaiety that are most exhilarating. As an
antidote to depression you can hardly do better than take
a hand or two with his delightful Gamesters. The stake, I
may mention, is five shillings net.
To Dr. Boyd CARPENTER's many friends I have no doubt
that Further Pages of My Life (WILLIAMs AND Norgate)
will be welcome, but as I only count myself among his
unknown admirers I will say frankly that this further
instalment of “reflections mingled with reminiscences”
contains too much that is trivial. No doubt something.
may be found here to suit everyone's taste, for the reminis-
cences range from a cat to the KAISER, and the reflections
also cover as wide a field. The real trouble is that
Dr. Boyd CARPENTER has jotted down anything and every-
thing that happened to occur to him. He himself seems
to suspect that something is wrong with the book. “These
little sketches,” he says, “will seem dull and uninteresting
to my readers; but, dear readers, forgive me.” It is not
for me either to differ from him or to refuse his affectionate
and disarming request for pardon. -

come to an end before the end of next summer.”—Ereryman.

CHARIVARIA.
AN American inventor has offered to
the British Government a new form of
energy several hundred times more
powerful than anything now known.
The British Government is said to have
declined the offer on the ground that it
had just acquired something of the
same kind from a Welsh source.

Attention has been called to the
strange case of a man who, after being
discharged from the Small Arms Fac-
tory at Enfield, was immediately given
a job at higher wages in another factory
working on Government contracts. It
is pointed out that hitherto this kind of
thing has never happened to anyone
below the rank of a Cabinet Minister
or a Brigadier. * *

It is reported that, in the absence of
some satisfactory control of food stuffs,
immature pigs have been changing
hands at sixpence a head. At this rate
no one need want for a household pet,
and it will not be long before the “Poor
Man's Pekinese" is to be found basking
before the meanest hearth.

Much apprehension has been caused
by the announcement that the hat trade
is among those which the Board of
Trade talks of closing down as being of
“no national importance.” Our whole
success in the War, it is pointed out,
practically depends upon the manu-
facture of Brass Hats.

A man whose "earnings were ad-
mitted to be seven pounds a week
recently told the St. Pancras Tribunal

munity if its usefulness were more
attractively advertised.

An official appeal has been made for
quieter weddings. It is pointed out
that while wedding breakfasts have
been almost entirely abandoned as the
result of the scarcity of eggs, many
ancient and costly customs, such as
pelting the bride with toast racks and
bathing the bridegroom in champagne,
still continue unabated.

It is declared to be an offence punish-
able by fine or imprisonment to attempt
to signal a taxicab by means of an
electric torch. The present practice of
pursuing the taxi until the fare in occu-

tion is still considered by the police to
be the safest and most convenient
during war-time.

LETTERS FROM MACEDONIA.
I.
MY DEAR JERRY,--It has come to
pass. I am a D.A.B.H. (no, I have
not got a cold in my head). I am a
Deputy Assistant Brass Hat. Colonels
who formerly told me to go to Malta
now ask me obsequiously if I like their
little dug-outs. When I come into view,
Senior Majors slide softly down com-
munication trenches or make a frenzied
bolt for the Bulgar lines. I am a nut,
I am. And yet their alarm is cause-
less, for it is not with them that my
dealings lie. It is with Giorgios. In
short, I am the D.A.D.D.R.W.G., the
Deputy Assistant Director of Diplo-
matic Relations With Giorgios.
How well I remember his entrance
the first night we bivouacked in his
fields. A tall, venerable, thin man
with a long grey beard, excited yet
dignified, he raised his voice in protest.
“You pay me for my land? Yes—
no? Very good! Good mornings.”
He retired six steps in good order,
then turned again and inquired, “You
pay me for my land? You understand?
No—yes? Very good! Good mornings.”
After which cryptic utterances he
stalked away in dignified silence.
He repeated this performance in de-
tail the next day and for several days
after; but he began to gain confidence
in me, as I knew a few words of ancient
and modern Greek. Hence it came to
pass that I was created D.A.D.D.R.W.G.
and Giorgios was unanimously elected
by the villagers D.A.D.D.R.W.M. We
met every day for consultation and, as
our esteem for each other increased, for
mutual edification. Our conversation
rarely flags and has a sort of go about
it—you know what I mean. Here is
an example; and really, Jerry, it is
only one of many.
“Mera, Giorgios.”
“Mornings, very good, Sir.”
(Nothing will ever make Giorgios
believe that “very good, Sir," is not a
title of address.)
“Poluphloisboio thalasses,” waving
my hand carelessly towards my water-
bucket.
“Ah. Yes—no. Very good.”
“Hox1FR, you know, Giorgios.”
“Ah, 'OMER, yes–no. Very good
chap! Nice feller "
Then we part in mutual goodwill and
admiration.
Giorgios has learned at least one
word from me—“nice.” He is very
proud of it and trots it out as often as
possible. A few days ago an enormous
shell fell into a neighbouring garden
while we were furthering diplomatic
relations, and the effects of its explosion
provided thrills unapproached in the
most exciting of the accustomed village
shows. Trembling with fear and rage
Giorgios clutched me and clung to me,
shouting vehemently, “Very nice shell!
|Very nice shell indeed!”
Yesterday we sat outside a little café
in the village drinking vile Turkish
coffee and smoking worse Turkish cigar-
ettes. To my surprise the entire male
adult population, instead of doing its
usual work of sitting in the cornfields,
was engaged in the same occupation as
Giorgios and I, save that bad wine was
their poison. Presently a low chant
reached our ears and round the corner
came a procession. At the head marched
the village priest, holding aloft a cruci-
fix, while behind him came the village
women and children, dressed in their
best clothes and every now and then
making supplicatory gestures.
“They are blessing the harvest,”
explained Giorgios in Greek.
“But the men,” I asked—“why
are they not in the procession ?”
“They are drinking to the harvest,”
he told me. “Of course that is much
more efficacious, but it is well to
let the women and children do what
they can. Besides,” he added after
a moment, a kindly gleam lighting up
his eye, “it is, after all, good that they
should get some enjoyment now and
then.”
I looked at the men, and saw that
they were doing their unpleasant duty
sternly, unflinchingly. At last I had a
glimpse of the true nobility of soul of
the Greek gentleman.
Before I left I sought from Giorgios
the explanation of a fact which had
puzzled me. I wanted to know why
the average Greek, when saying “Nai "
(Yes), invariably shakes his head, while
“Ochi " (No) is accompanied by an
emphatic nod.
Iſe had an explanation ready. The
Greeks, he said, are people of the past,
and forlorn pessimism is their only
enjoyment. Things that are not are
for them the beautiful things. The
past is golden, the present is grey, the
future is black; the Greeks, in short,
are hopeless. I am inclined to agree
with Giorgios.
Before leaving I asked my ancient
friend if he would have a cigarette.
“Nai, charisto,” he responded dully,
shaking his head. At the same time
he took three out of my case, and then
bade me “Mornings.”
It's a good trick, Jerry. Try it
the next time anyone offers you a
drink But I touch on a sore
spot, I fear.
Yours ever, PETER.
The Allies' peace-terms: Unconditional
surrender, not Hun-conditional.
“ENGLAND HATH TAKEN ME.”
THE Pessimist had been in full blast
for about half-an-hour before the Aus-
tralian got into the compartment.
He had given us enlivening discourses
under various headings, rather like the
titles of the “star” articles by ex-
Cabinet Ministers in the Sunday Press,
as, for instance, “What is our Army
doing?” “Ditto Navy 2” “Wanted—
a Statesman,” “What is Agriculture
coming to ?” “What are we all coming
to 2 ”
He had just reached his “thirdly”
in the last-named subject when the
Australian arrived
He was a large Australian—large for
an Australian. He had a gold stripe
on his sleeve and the memory of battle
still brooded in his eyes. He settled
down in the corner and looked out at
the misty grey and brown landscape,
the curving river, the smoke drifting
from a fire of weeds, the rushy common,
the thatched villages and nestling
churches—all the little familiar things
that make up our England.
What was he thinking about it
all? I wondered. Was he thinking
that the climate was raw, the fields
small and cramped, the hedges neg-
lected, the
“My word ' " said the Australian
suddenly, drawing a deep breath, “it—
it's fine, isn't it?”
I rather think we blushed a little,
as Britons mostly do when anybody
praises that which is theirs.
“This is Home to me,” the Australian
continued—“always has been. It's
funny, isn't it 2 I've always called
England Home ever since I was born.
And yet I’d never seen it in my life
before the War. . . . Yes,” he went
on, speaking as if to himself, his eyes
turned again to the gentle gracious
landscape, drinking in its beauty like
wine, “I’ve written over to my folk
in Australia and told 'em how it is. It
isn't that I don't love Australia; but
England—well, England's got me.
It
all seemed to come over me the very
first time I saw her—sailing up the
Solent in the hospital ship, it was–
and I said to myself, “This 'll do for
me for ever and ever.”
Somebody said “Thank you" (speak-
ing for England, as it were) in rather
a shaky voice. There didn't seem to
be very much else to say. Besides, it
isn't very easy to speak with a lump
in your throat.
As for the Pessimist, he too was
looking out of the window. Perhaps
he was feeling a little ashamed of
himself. Perhaps, on the contrary, he
was merely wondering what the fellow
could see in it all.

WHAT'S WHAT ON THE MENU.
OF SoulPS.
Soup under the new regulations is
half a course. In the past, little diffi-
culty has been experienced in staying
the whole course, though instances are
recorded from the City of competitors in
the Deep Tureen contests having to swim
ashore or tread soup until help arrived.
The difficulty of distinguishing a
meaty soup from a light stew has
already caused several West End es-
tablishments famous throughout the
gastronomic world for their stews to

spicuously absent. But the spiritual In pre-war days the practice of serving
serve consommés exclusively
rather than risk an encounter
with the Food Police. (Indeed
the head-waiter at 's drew
such a painful picture of their
fat chef undergoing a week's
field punishment on the Picca-
dilly Circus refuge that our
special representative almost
wept into his Fantaisie de Cas-
quettes Rouges, Sauce Militaire.)
Such drastic action is quite
unnecessary if the following
simple test is applied :—
I. INGREDIENTs.-Though not
conclusive proof of the legal
nature of the dish in question,
these furnish evidence which
may shift the burden of proof
from the maitre d'hôtel to the
police, and vice-versa. If the
presence of vermicelli, peas not
more than three in number, hair
(human, one), or caudal ver-
tebrae not exceeding one and
one-eighth inches in diameter
be detected, the diner is in
all human probability in the
presence of soup. The sub-
stantial fabric of a stew, on the
other hand, will be built up of
game, fowl, beef, mutton or (for
slenderer purses) such efficient
food substitutes as sole leather
and uppers, whip-cord, box-cloth and
rubberhosings, the whole being rendered
more palatable by the addition of
mushrooms, oysters, truffles, bone but-
tons and the spare parts of lawn-
mowers and sewing-machines.
Not long since an enterprising
Compton Street caterer introduced to
the palates of his clients a Futurist
stew the dominating note of which
was an umbrella frame; but the experi-
ment did not meet with the success it
deserved at the teeth of a public too
conservative in its Bohemianism.
II. THE PRICE CHARGED. — In the
case of stew the amount charged usually
bears a definite relation to the amount
of nourishment provided. In some of
the old-established stew repositories it
is still the custom to charge a flat rate

in at least one Bohemian restaurant in
Soho it is no uncommon thing to find
a passage from the Georgics or an appo-
site couplet from The Gardeners' Chron-
icle scratched on the bottom of a soup-
plate by some grateful diner.
III. BEHAVIOUR OF GUESTs.--This
will of course be scrutinised with the
utmost keenness by the Restaurant
Police. If a man is observed furtively
rubbing the back of his ears with a
sponge it is almost certain that he has
been engaged with stew. If, on the
other hand, he merely rubs his waist-
coat with the corner of the table-cloth,
the evidence points to soup.

as the result of increased pros-

unusual to see a sturdy son of

a Sèvres cup to the haunting
strains of a Swiss band. In
cases of this kind the Police
must rely on the evidence of
his ears rather than of his eyes.

subject of soup we may add

Tommy. “Now THEN, HANDs UP, or You 'RE A DEAD MAN.”
POETRY AS USUAL.
(Wide Literary Gossip passim.)
THE statement made in the literary
column of a contemporary about the
remarkable volume of poems, entitled
Laughs and Whifts of Song, has evoked
an interesting letter from Mr. Ivor
Stoot. Laughs and Whifts, according
to the statement referred to, failed to
secure any critical recognition, with a
few notable exceptions, in this country,
but has had such a success in America
that the author, Mr. THEoDoRE MAY-
NARD, has been invited to go out on a
twenty-six weeks' reading and lecturing
tour throughout the States.
Mr. Stoot writes to point out that
this achievement, though remarkable,
is not by any means unparalleled or
unprecedented. “When I published
my volume, The Dunch of Doom and
other Marmoreal Chunks of Rhyme, it
was greeted with a conspiracy of silence.
Not even Mr. JAMEs Douglas pro-
nounced it a masterpiece. All the same
it did lead to a pressing invitation—
anonymous, it is true, but none the less
cordially worded—that I should go out
to the Solomon Islands, not for twenty-
six weeks, but as a permanent resident.
On consulting the officials of the Col-
onial Office I was recommended to be
careful not to travel too far into the
interior, owing to the prevalence of can-
nibalism in certain districts, but, as it
turned out, other engagements pre-
vented my acting on the suggestion.”
With regard to the word “Whifts”
Mr. Stoot observes that, as the New

it is impossible to say what literary
authority Mr. MAYNARD has for this
engaging word. “I am inclined to
think,” he adds, “that it is merely an
example of the portmanteau formation
affected by LEwis CARROLL. I may
point out that I have already developed
this form of word-coining in the titles of
some of my books, e.g. Meandulations, a
beautiful combination of ‘meanderings'
and ‘perambulations.’” We are natur-
ally much gratified at being selected as
the medium through which Mr. Stoot
has made this momentous pronounce-
ment.
Profound satisfaction will be felt in ||
literary circles at the announcement
that Sir Chutney Ramchunder is about
to publish a new volume of prose-poems
entitled The Harvest of Peace. The
contents, as we gather from an authori-
tative source, are marked by the serene
wisdom which has characterised his
earlier utterances, and are written for
the most part in a severely simple style,
though the ideas are of the most trans-
cendental sublimity. Nothing more
conclusively proves the greatness of the
author than his entire detachment from
mundane convulsions, as compared with
WoRDsworth's petty pre-occupation
with wars and revolutions.

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.

Bethmann-Hollureſ. Your Majesty has returned sooner
than was anticipated.
Raiser. Yes, I have torn myself away from Verdun, where
our brave fellows are sustaining the most terrible attacks
with incredible fortitude and some measure of success.
B.-H. Some measure? We here in Berlin have been led
to believe that we have gained a series of unparalleled
victories and have scattered the French wherever they have
dared to meet us.
Kaiser (joyfully). Is that really believed here?
B.-H. Yes, indeed, Your Majesty. What else could we
believe in face of the official statements that were issued
from Headquarters? It is true that they admitted retire-
ment by our troops in one small sector, but that was said
to be a movement executed according to plan, so as to lay
a trap for the French, who fell into it, with sanguinary losses.
Kaiser. Oh, they believe all that, do they 2 That is
perfectly splendid, and I must telegraph my congratulations
to the General Staff. -
B.-H. Am I to understand, then, Your Majesty, that it is
not true, and that when we hung out our flags and marched
in procession through the streets it was all for nothing, or
rather for what was worse than nothing, seeing that we had
suffered a defeat? Is that right, Your Majesty 2
Kaiser. Right? Of course it is right. Does it not main-
tain the moral of the people to hear of brilliant victories?
If we told them of defeats how should we be able to stir
them up to ever-renewed efforts? How would they consent
to provide ever more and more men if they felt they were
fighting in vain? And how, finally, should we induce them
to entertain the idea of peace negotiations if it were not for
perpetually repeated smashings of all who are opposed to us.
B.-H. Your Majesty will permit me to observe that these
—what shall I call them 2–these inaccuracies are intended
to serve too many objects. They are at the same time to
keep the people inclined for war and to move their minds
in the direction of peace. They are—
Kaiser. There, there—that will do. I didn't come back
to Berlin in order to have my words twisted and their
plain meaning confused.
B.-H. Of course not, Your Majesty, of course not. But
will Your Majesty graciously deign to inform me what was
the special object of your august return ?
Kaiser. I am anxious to know if the joy-bells are ready.
B.-H. Joy-bells again? Is there more news from Verdun
that Your Majesty has not yet mentioned 2
Kaiser. Not those joy-bells, but much bigger ones.
B.-H. Are the English then at last ground to powder 2

Kaiser. Silence

B.-H. They admit nothing, and so far as I can gather
they do not think much of our proposals. Does Your
Majesty now mean that the proposals were serious?
Kaiser. Nothing in the world was ever more serious.
Do not interrupt. Do they admit it,
Your Majesty will forgive me for
so, and not ordered me to wrap up the suggestion in all that
high talk about our successes and our greatness. Our
enemies say there is not even one halfpennyworth of bread
to an intolerable deal of sack.
Kaiser. But this sort of war cannot go on for ever.
Humanity cannot endure it.
B.-H. Your Majesty should have thought of that before.
Kaiser. But if I want peace?
B.-H. Then Your Majºs'y must try other methods.
God knows we all want it in Germany.
THE NAKED LIGHT.
THE Scrimshaws' house stands well up on the cliff, and
the big bay-window of the library looks out towards the
sea—the North Sea. A bright light in the library window
therefore would be visible to mariners for some miles.
At about 9.30 P.M. on a certain evening in November, old
Scrimshaw came across the word “hegemony” in the even-
ing paper, and he did not know what “hegemony” meant.
ow ninety-nine readers out of a hundred would have
skipped lightly over it and passed on. But old Scrimshaw
was of the conscientious kind, and he asked first his wife
and then his son if they knew the meaning of the word.
Mrs. Scrimshaw said she thought it meant something to
do with having one wife; but she spoke without conviction,
and in any case, whatever she had said, old Scrimshaw
would have been distrustſul. Young Scrimshaw said frankly
that he did not know, and his father suggested that he
should go to the library and consult the dictionary.
Note now the combination of circumstances. That even-
ing the maid, in a moment of abstraction, had omitted to
pull the curtains over the large bay-window in the library.
Young Scrimshaw entered, switched on, with the extrava-
gance of youth, all the lights in the room, drew the
dictionary from the bookcase, and, subsiding into a chair,
began the search for “hegemony.”
At that moment Sergeant Hopweed of the County Police
turned the corner of the road and came in view of the
Scrimshaws' house.
He saw the blaze of light pouring forth and moved
towards it. Then it went out, young Scrimshaw having
run “hegemony" to earth. Then it flashed on again as
young Scrimshaw came back for his cigarette-case. Then
out again. Then on again, because he had left his matches
behind. Then finally out again. -
Hopweed arrived at the gate, strode up the short drive,
and rang the bell.
A maid—in fact the very maid who had forgotten about
the curtains—opened the door.
“It’s the Police Sergeant, Miss,” said Hopweed. “I
should like to see Mr. Scrimshaw.”
Old Scrimshaw came out into the hall.
“Yes, Sergeant?”
“I’m sorry to disturb you, Sir, but I thought you'd like
to know that your dog's been found over at Ramstairs.”
Now here is the mystery. Not a word was said of that
unshielded light flashing out across the water. Not the
faintest allusion was made to the Defence of the Realm.
But indeed why should there have been 2 For all this
happened, as perhaps I should have mentioned before, in

THE HAIRPINS ACT.
THERE was a hair-raising rumour last
week in the ladies' clubs and other
capillary circles that the sale of hair-
pins was going to be stopped for the
purpose of winning the War. The
report, however, of so drastic a measure
proved to be unfounded, and it would
seem that the utmost that the matinée-
girl or the munitionette may have to
fear is the establishment, by Act of
Parliament, under the Defence of the
Realm Consolidation Act, 1914, of a
CENTRAL CONTROL BOARD
(HAIRPIN TRAFFIC).
The new Act would not operate auto-
matically for the whole Kingdom, or
indeed any part of it, until an Order in
Council had been made with regard
to that part. The functions of the
Board with regard to any prescribed
or “scheduled " area would be to enforce
regulations with the following objects
ln V16W –
(1.) To limit the hours during which
hairpins or similar contrivances may
be sold or supplied in clubs or shops.
(II.) To control the introduction of
hairpins into, and their transport within,
the area.
(III.) To prohibit treating, or free
bestowal of hairpins.
(iv.) To establish canteens for the
supply of Government hairpins of the
approved pattern and alloy.
(v.) To authorise inspectors to enter
hairdressers' and wigmakers' establish-
ments, if need be, by force.
The suggested Act may be taken as
Britain's reply to the German Peace-
kite. -
“Interviewed at Washington, Count Bern-
storff, the German Ambassador, said he hoped
the proposals would lead to peace. If not, the
world would know that after a victorious cam-
paign Germany was desirous of pease.”

And quite a lot of other eatables.
“His friends dubbed him the “Tylerstown
Terror.' But there is a brutal sound about
that that hardly suits the personality of a
dapper little fellow who in mufti gives the
impression of being afraid to say “Bob” to a
goose.”—Sunday Chronicle.
A risky thing to say even to a goose
in these times of high prices.
“The army of Verdun has replied, as is suit-
able, with the voice of the gnus, to the hypo-
critical proposal for a suspicious peace which

PRIGMATISM.
| THE child is father to the man,
And “educationists” agree
| In cracking up the modern plan
Of setting little children free
From all that cramps the budding infant
mind
And keeps it straitly in its crib confined.
Of course you must prepare the f8od
When it is tough or rich or strong;
To serve it to the infant crude
Would be indubitably wrong;
| But when they're duly pulped or
sterilized
| No authors need be wholly ostracized.
Gibbox's great masterpiece on Rome
In monosyllables, I'm sure,
Would prove in many a British home
A perfect and perpetual cure
For all the enervating old-wives' tales
Whose influence in our nurseries still
prevails.
Instead of wasting time on bricks,
Tin soldiers and such futile toys,
Our modern and enlightened chicks—
Not merely girls but even boys—
Would soon consolidate their mental
fibre
By lessons borrowed from the Nile or

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, December 18th.-If I were
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER I
should never venture to introduce a
Financial Resolution to the House of
Commons without first obtaining the
imprimatur of the Junior Member for
the City of London. Anything the
least irregular in this class of business
makes BANBURY cross.
Anxious to complete the new Admin-
istration at the earliest possible moment
Mr. BoNAR LAw had tabled a motion to
expedite the passage of the Financial
Resolution to the New Ministers and
Secretaries Bill. But when Sir FRED-
ERICK BANBURY grimly warned him that
he would save no time by this procedure
he incontinently withdrew his motion.
At Question-time the Member for
Haggerston had ascertained that seats
would be found for those Ministers
who are not already Members, with
the exception of the CoNTRoller of
SHIPPING, who thinks he can be more
useful outside. This gave great offence
to Mr. SwiFT MACNEILL and Mr. Hous-
ToN. The former objects on constitu-
tional grounds; the latter, I suspect, for
personal reasons. The feelings of a New
Yorker for a dweller in Chicago do not
compare in intensity with the ardent
affection of the average Liverpool ship-
owner for his Glasgow brother; and
ever since the appointment of Sir
Joseph MACLAY was announced Mr.
Houston has been anxiously awaiting
the moment when he could express his
appreciation across the floor of the
House.
In introducing the New Ministers
Bill Sir GEORGE CAve, expressed his
congratulations to his Under-Secretary,
who has just been made a Privy Council-
lor. With his round face, set off by a
pair of gigantic moustaches, Mr. BRACE
always reminds me of a benevolent cat,
and when Sir F. E. SMITH, who was
sitting next him, stroked his knee to
emphasize Sir GEORGE's encomiums,
I could almost have sworn I heard him
purring.
Among the multitude of new officials
that the Government are taking powers
to appoint is to be an Under-Secretary
for the Air Board. Hitherto the Cinder-
ella of the Ministry, overshadowed by
her two elder sisters, the Board is now
to be advanced to a more dignified
status. The HoME SECRETARY speci-
fically stated that its services would in
future be utilized to the full by “the two
fighting departments,” which means,
I hope, that in the purchase of aero-
planes the R.N.A.S. and the R.F.C.
will no longer be flying in each other's
faces.
I listened with some impatience to
Mr. DILLoN (who might devote his
talents to framing a workable consti-
tution for his own country rather than
to condemning the efforts of British
statesmen) and to the acidulated criti-
cism of Mr. PRINGLE, Mr. RAMSAY
MAcDoNALD and others. But on the
whole the House was disposed to accept
the Bill as a part of the new Govern-
ment's intention to throw into the War,
“without stint and without delay,” all
the strength and all the resources of
the country.
Tuesday, December 19th.-Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE has frequently been compared
of late to the elder PITT, who wrested
the conduct of a great war out of the
hands of the fainéant Duke of NEw-
CASTLE. And it is said of PITT that he
was a brilliant extemporiser, but that
his prepared speeches were a lament-
able failure.
The PRIME MINISTER's speech to day
was not a failure; it contained too

many interesting features for that. The
House listened with close attention as
he dealt with the shadowy Peace pro-
posals of the German CHANCELLOR, and
unfolded the great schemes by which
he intends to mobilise and organise
all the resources of the nation. Yet
the speech would have been twice as
effective if it had occupied one hour
instead of two, and if, instead of read-
ing the bulk of it in the mannor of a
scholar reciting his prize-essay, he had,
as usual, relied upon the inspiration
of the moment to bring the appropriate
words to his lips. Mr. BonAR LAw
would have done his chief no small
service if he had quietly abstracted that
embarrassing MS. -
While for the most part studiously
avoiding provocative references to the
late Cabinet, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
allowed himself one or two piquant
allusions to its alleged dilatoriness.
These were just enough to furnish
Mr. Asquith with a peg on which to
hang a vigorous defence of himself and
his colleagues against the charge of
slackness. He is excusably anxious to
convince the world that, if the coping.

we all hope, to be affixed by the new
PRIME MINISTER, it will be because
the foundations were well and truly

showed once more that he is a master
of the lapidary art. I was quite sorry
that Lord NorthcLIFFE, who had sat
through Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's speech,
was compelled to leave the Peers' Gal-
lery before Mr. Asquith had completed
his remarks on the critics of his Ad-
mihistration.

LET Folly tremble, for Mr. E. F. BENsoN is at it again.
Nay more, he is at it this time less as the story-teller than as
the admitted satirist. There could be few better qualified.
Perhaps you may have noticed how often when you looked
back upon his tales the characters that stood out most
clearly in your memory were those whose petty foibles
he had delighted himself and you by clothing with a
half-ironical sympathy. Well, in The Freaks of Mayfair
(Foulis) you get, as its name implies, this irony in a con-
centrated form, and the result is a thing of delight; all the
absurdities and little weaknesses of other people are caught
here for your edification—snobs, dupes, slanderers, climbers,
to each a brilliant chapter. You could spend an amusing
evening in the selection of persons, on your own visiting
list, who might stand as the originals of these witty pages.
Now and again, perhaps, a darker suspicion will obtrude;
in the passage, for example, about the silver-backed brushes
and the rubber hot-water bottle of the “Spinster Uncle.”
of humour. Ishrewdly doubt whether his views on teaching
are practical, but I wish sincerely that someone had tried
them as an experiment upon me. No punishment, no set
lessons (or, at the worst, very few), and a chance to develop
individual bents if one happened to have any. It all sounds
too good to be true in these “get-on-or-get-out” days. We
want results from our children much as we expect eggs from
hens, and there are the same loud complaints if we don't
get them. The trouble is that we look for almost precisely
identical results from every pattern of child. To all this
and a good deal more Mr. NEILL draws our attention, and
in the process he shows a real sympathetic love for children.
The greater the pity that, in asserting some of his views,
he writes bitterly about those who happen to differ from
him fundamentally, though they are just as sincere as he is.
I have found the story of Boundary House (HUTCHINson)
fully equal to the promise of its name. The house in
question was cne that stood upon the confines of two
parishes, and used at due seasons to be beaten by “several

is a figure of the rarest delight. And it was a shrewd and
subtle stroke to endow her with rather more than tolerance
for the “poor old Kaiser.” In short, Maria is all too con-
vincingly alive; and however, on larger issues, you may
deplore the fact, here in this merry little volume she has at
least earned her right to existence. I must not forget to
mention that she is illustrated with nine of those fascinating
pictures by A. H. FISH, whom you know in another place
(if the law will allow me to mention it) in association with
the comments of Eve. No better interpretation of Maria's
personality than these clever angularities
could have been
devised. -
I have not read A Dominie's Log, but, to judge from its
sequel, A Dominie Dismissed (JENKINs), some very original
ideas on education must there, as here, have been given a
thorough airing. Mr. A. S. NEILL is an entirely new type—
a propagandist (and in some ways a faddist) with a sense
a character that for its general creepiness is not unworthy
ºf the master by whom she herself is very obviously
inspired. Indeed there is a pronounced flavour of DICKENs
about the whole story, in the toy-making scenes, and no
less in the delightful picture of Miss Gladiolus Burns, a
modern edition of the Infant Phenomenon, who had in
her home life a contempt for toys, but “kept a large doll to
be carried on all professional occasions.” In short, for an
entertaining plot, a pleasantly acid humour and a touch of
the macabre, here is a novel to be noted.
“Will Person seen taking PURSE from Lady's Coat, Ante Room,
Appletree, Cockel mouth, Saturday Night, return to Mr. — to have
further trouble.”—West Cumberland Times.
We doubt it. -
“The printed programme last night stood as follows:–Overture,
‘The Batterel Bride,” Smetana.”—Birmingham Daily Mail.
When we last heard of her she had merely been “bartered”;
but, as so often happens in these cases, the husband must
have turned out a brute.
“TANNER.—Immediately, for Boys' Industrial School, temporarily
(and possibly permanently), an all-round Tanner; wages £19 per
| month and six months' work guaranteed.—Apply, with testi-
| monials, to the Superintendent, Boys' Industrial School, Potchef-
| stroom.”—Johannesburg Star.
It looks like an immediate temporary (and possibly
permanent) soreness for some of the youngsters.

MR. PUNCH IN A BRITISH PRISONERS’ CAMP.
I can't imagine how he ever got there, but he says he did. I had been reading in his pages quite recently
of the breathless adventures of somebody who had spent only “Ten Minutes in Germany.” What must it have
meant to penetrate into the heart of a prisoners' camp? . -
When I asked my friend for details he just smiled like the Secret Service and left me wondering. Of
course I had ideas. At first I pictured him disguised as Father Christmas; but there was the difficulty of his
hump. How conceal so obtrusive a feature? Ah an inspiration. Perhaps he had taken advantage of the
enemy's overtures to represent himself as an emissary of Peace. The wings that go with the uniform could be
so arranged as to conceal his protuberance. But no sooner had I conceived this thought than I dismissed it as
offensive to his patriotism; for I knew how strongly he felt about any suggestion of a premature and shameful peace,
and that he would be the last person in the world even to masquerade as a Pacifist.
How then did he get there? Well, I don't mind telling you that it is my belief that he never did get
there, except in spirit. For he is like that. There is fairy blood in him; and when he wants particularly to be
in a place and there are insuperable difficulties about taking his body with him he just goes without it. And
that, I think, must be how he got to the British Prisoners' Camp at
In any case the process is not my affair. I am just to tell you what he told me of his talk with our
men and how he tried to hearten their courage. -
He had a great welcome; for he is on the Black List and it was months—and years with some—since
they had seen his weekly missive to the trenches. And then he looked into their tired patient faces and asked
about their prison life: had they enough food and warm clothing? did their parcels come punctually from
home? were they overworked 2 did the time hang very heavy on their hands? -
But he soon saw that they didn't want to talk about themselves; they wanted to ask questions about home
and how the War was going. And he told them that London was not in ashes, nor England starving, nor the
Fleet at the bottom of the sea, nor our Armies everywhere in full retreat. And they laughed and said that all those
funny stories had been served out to them rather more regularly than their meals, but that they had known
better than to swallow any one of them.

And then they asked a little wistfully when the War was going to end. Reports of Germany's overtures
had been carefully spread in the camp. Would anything come of this? Was there really a chance of Peace 2
I think my friend must have hesitated a little before he spoke. He thought of all that these prisoners of
war had suffered and were yet to suffer. But he looked again into their eyes and knew that he had to do with
brave men. So he spoke frankly and trusted them to understand.
“Months ago,” he said, “the enemy knew that they were beaten. The map still flattered them, but they
knew that they were beaten. Their man-power had been heavily drained; the strain of our blockade was
beginning to tell; and already in certain quarters their people were hinting that peace would be a great
convenience. But just then, with their armies beaten back day by day on the Somme, to suggest peace might
seem a confession of defeat. Some big success was wanted, on the strength of which they might propose an end
of killing, with the air of victors who could afford to be generous.
“Roumania gave them their chance for a cheap and spectacular triumph. Here was a comparatively small
nation, whom they could crush under their heel as they had crushed Belgium and Serbia. So on Roumania they
concentrated all the men they could spare from other fronts and put them under their best generals.
“Their first plans failed, but eventually the big guns had their way and Bukarest fell.
“Out came the bunting and bang went the joy-bells. Now was the moment to make a noble offer of peace.
As for Berlin, shouting itself hoarse on an empty stomach—and empty stomachs, they supposed, were after all just
one of the hardships that had to be borne in all wars, even when you were winning–Berlin never doubted but
that the KAISER had only to lift a little finger of his mailed fist and we should all open our mouths and shut
our eyes and wait to see what he had to offer us. And they sat up all night in the snow to get first news of
our answer. And none came, except a distant rumble of laughter.”
I need not repeat all the reasons that my friend gave for this rumble of laughter; I will just give the one with
which he ended. “You see,” he said, “we knew their way with scraps of paper. The lasting peace which they
proposed for humanity's sake (they hadn't worried much about humanity up to now) might well turn out to be
no better than a few years' armistice to allow them to pull themselves together and start again. Our only
chance of an enduring peace was to reduce them to such impotence that they wouldn't have strength enough to
tear up the treaty, or, anyhow, that it wouldn't make any difference whether they did or not.
“And so,” he concluded, “we must go on until we have made sure of this. If anything could make us
stop, it would be the thought of you here, for you are always in our thoughts and hearts. But I know you
would never want us to break our word and to shame our dead.” -
At the end he read their answer in eyes that were bright with confidence and resolution.
“And now,” added Mr. Punch on a more personal note, “I see that the sentry suspects me of having been
here long enough. I have only one more thing to say. It has been my dearest pride to think that I may perhaps
have brought some little cheer to our brave fellows in the trenches. The same poor gifts—I wish they could have
been worthier—that I have sent them week by week are here bound together, and I beg you to do me the honour
to accept, with my sincere and affectionate devotion, this copy of my - -
One *junarth amb fifty-first tolume."
