2 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 3, 1917.
TO THE KAISER FOR HIS NEW YEAR.
Now with the New-born Year, when people issue
Greetings appropriate to all concerned,
Allow me, WILLIAM, cordially to wish you
Whatever peace of mind you may have earned;
It doesn't sound too fat, -
But you will have to be content with that.
For you will get no other, though you ask it;
No peace on diplomatic folios writ,
Like what you chucked in your waste-treaty-basket,
Torn into fragments, bit by little bit;
In these rude times we shrink
From vain expenditure of pulp and ink.
You hoped to start a further scrap of paper
And stretched a flattering paw in soft appeal,
Purring as hard as tiger-cats at play purr
With velvet padding round your claws of steel;
A pretty piece of acting,
Dut, ere we treat, those claws 'll want extracting.
You thought that you had just to moot the question
And say you felt the closing hour had come
And we should simply jump at your suggestion
And all the Hague with overtures would hum;
You'd but to call her up,
And Peace would follow like a well-bred pup.
But Peace and War are twain (see Chadband's platitude);
War you could summon by your single self,
But Peace—for she adopts a stickier attitude—
Takes two to mobilise her off the shelf;
Unless one side's so weak
That, try his best, he cannot raise a squeak.
When things are thus and you have had your beating,
We'll talk and you can listen. Better cheer
I've none to offer you by way of greeting,
But this should help you through the glad New Year;
It lacks for grace, I own, --
But let its true sincerity atone ! O. S.
AN EXTRA SPECIAL.
A special, constable is allowed to bore his beat-partner
in moderation. I have no doubt that I bore mine. In
return I expect to be moderately bored. In fact a partner
who flashed through all the four hours might attract
Zeppelins. But Granby In human endurance there is
a point known as the limit. That is Granby.
Years back some Government person in a moment of
fatuity made Granby a magistrate. Magistrates should
learn to condense their wisdom into sentences. Granby
beats out his limited store into orations.
It was my misfortune to arrive late at the station the
other night and to find that the other specials had craftily
left Granby to be my partner. The results of unpunctuality
are sometimes hideous.
Directly we had started our lonely patrol Granby gave
what I may describe as his “bench "cough and began,
“When I was at the court the other day a very curious
case came before me.” He was off. If Granby delivers
to prisoners in the dock the speeches he recites to me
the Government ought to intervene. No man however
guilty ought to have a sentence and one of Granby's
orations. He might be given the option. Personally, for
anything under fourteen days I should be tempted to serve
the sentence.
Just when he was at his dreariest I heard a remarkable
treble voice down a side-street singing, “Keep the Home
Fires Burning.”, “Sounds like a drunk,” I said promptly;
“we ought to investigate this.” Had it been a couple
of armed burglars I should have welcomed their advent if
it stopped Granby.
We went down and found a stout lady sitting on the
pavement warbling Songs Without Melody.
“Gerout, Zeppelin,” she observed as a flash-lamp was
turned on her.
“A distinct case of intoxication plus incapability,” ob-
served Granby. “We must take her to the station. You
can charge her. I have so many important engagements
this week that I can't spare time to be a witness.”
I saw that a wasted morning at the police-court was to
be thrust on me.
“I also have many important engagements this week,”
I replied.
“This duty is to be taken seriously—” began Granby.
“Yes,” I said, “if we don't run her in we ought to see
her home. She can't stay here rousing the street.”
“That was what I was about to suggest as the proper
course for you when you interrupted me,” said Granby.
“Where do you live?” he demanded.
“Fourteen, Benbow Avenue,” replied the lady; “and pore
Uncle Sam's been dead eleven years.”
“Come on,” I said. “Get up and we'll see you home.”
The lady pushed me aside, gripped Granby's arm and
said affectionately, “'Ow you remind me of pore ole Jim
in is best days afore 'e got jugged"
Granby snorted as he dragged the lady onward. I think
he knew that I was smiling in the darkness.
“Jus' like ole times, when we was courtin' together,”
continued the lady. “If it 'adn't been for a bronze-topped
barmaid comin' between us, what might 'ave been! ah, what
might 'ave been "
This tender reminiscence prompted the lady to sing,
“Come to me, sweet Marie,” with incidental attempts at
a step-dance. The finale brought us to Benbow Avenue.
“I shall speak to her husband and caution him severely
about his wife's conduct,” said Granby to me.
I shrank into the background ready to move off directly
the oration began.
Granby knocked at the door and it opened.
“I have brought your wife home in a state—” he
began.
“Ain't I 'ad a nice young man to take me for a walk
while you've been sitting guzzling by the fire 2"
“You been taking my missis for a walk,” said the in-
dignant husband.
“I am a magistrate and a special constable—” began
Granby.
“More shame to you. It's the likes of you 'oo disgraces
the upper clarses.”
“Shut the door, Bill,” said the lady. “Don't lower
yourself by talking to 'im. I never could abide a man
as smelt o' gin meself.”
The door slammed and Granby strode towards me.
“The ingratitude of the lower classes is disgraceful. . I
am tempted to despair of the State when I think of it.
The only way is to let these occurrences pass into oblivion,
to set oneself resolutely to forget them as if they had
never been.”
I agreed; but since then Granby has always eyed me
curiously. I think he suspects that I am not forgetting
resolutely enough.
A Field Officer writes: “Yesterday I was saluted by an
Australian private. It was a great day for me.”

THE WATCH DOGS.
LIV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, What about this
Peace? I suppose that, what with your
nice new Governments and all, this is
the very last thing you are thinking of
making at the moment. I wouldn't
believe that the old War was ever going
to end at all if it wasn't for the last
expert and authoritative opinion I hear
has been expressed by our elderly
barber in Fleet Street. At the end of
July, 1914, he told me confidentially,
as he snipped the short hairs at the
back of my head, that there was going
to be no war; the whole thing
was just going to fizzle out.
Now he says it is going to be a
very, very long business, as he
always thought it would.
I find it difficult to maintain
consistently either the detached
point of view, in which one dis-
cusses it as if it was a European
hand of bridge, or the purely in-
terested point of view, in which
one regards it only as a matter
affecting one's individual com-
fort. I know a Mess, well up
in the Front where they measure
the mud by feet, in which they
were discussing the War raging
at their front door as if it had
nothing to do with them beyond
being a convenient thing to criti-,
cise. Men who were then likely
to be personally removed at any
moment by it saw nothing in the
progress of it to be depressed
about. As the evening wore :
and they all came to find that
they knew much more about the
subject than they supposed, they
were prepared to increase the
ing the merits of their own pet
schemes. No gloom arose from
from the impersonal to the personal
point of view by a quite trifling incident.

him by his servant from an estaminet
across the road over which his window
looks. The other morning he was
standing at this window waiting for
his breakfast to arrive. It was a fine
frosty day, made all the brighter by
the sound of approaching bagpipes.

they are doing it they might as well be
cheerful about it. The regimental trans-
port makes a change from the regular-

Jones, he could watch for ever.
He was sorry when the battalion
came at last to an end; he was
'glad when another almost im-
mediately began. He was in
luck; doubtless this was a bri-
gade on the move. He proposed
to have his breakfast at the win-
dow, when it came as come it
soon must, thus refreshing his
hungry body and his contem-
plative mind at the same time.
The second battalion, as the
first, were fine fellows all, sug-
gesting the might of the Allies
and the futility of the enemy's
protracted resistance. Again
the comic relief was provided by
the travelling cuisine, reminding
Jones of the oddity of human
affairs and the need of his own
meal, now sufficiently deferred.
The progress of the Brigade
was interrupted by the inter-
vention of a train of motor

To illustrate the power that the
taxi-driver has been wielding over
London during the past week or so of
mitigated festivity, let me tell a true
story. I was in a cab with my old
friend Mark, one of the most ferocious
| sticklers for efficiency in underlings
who ever sent for the manager. His
maledictions on bad waiters have led
to the compulsory re-decorating of
| half the restaurants of London months
before their time, simply by discolouring
the walls with their intensity. Well,
after immense difficulty, Mark and I,
bound for the West, induced a driver
to accept us as his fare, and took our
places inside.
“He looks a decent capable fellow,”
said Mark, who prides himself on his
skill in physiognomy. “We ought to
be there in a quarter of an hour.”
But we did not start. First the
engine was cold. Then, that having
consented and the flag being lowered,
a fellow-driver asked our man to
help him with his tail-light. He did
so with the utmost friendliness and
deliberation. Then they both went
to the back of our cab to see how our
tail-light was doing, and talked about
tail-lights together, and how easy it was
to jolt them out, and how difficult it
was to know whether they had been
jolted out or not, and how jolly careful
one had to be nowadays with so many
blooming regulations and restrictions
and things.
Meanwhile Mark was becoming pur-

CHOKING THEM OFF.
It is reported that, should the mea-
sures recently adopted by the railway
companies with a view to “discourage
unnecessary travelling" prove insuffi-
cient, other expedients, of a more
stringent character, may be resorted
to. By the courtesy of an official we
are able to give details of some further
innovations that have been suggested.
(1.) The Platform Staff at the chief
stations will be specially trained to
answer all enquiries from civilian pas-
sengers in an ambiguous or quasi-
humorous manner.
Thus detailed instructions are to be
issued giving the correct form of reply
to such questions as, “Can I take this
train to Rugby 2” The answer in this
case will convey a jocular suggestion
that the task is best left to the engine-
driver; and others in the same style.
In all cases of urgency the formula
“Wait and see" to be freely employed
for purposes of discouragement.
(ii.) In the case of exceptionally popu-
lar tickets, such as those to Brighton, a
strictly limited number of impressions
to be struck off, which will be disposed
of by public auction to the highest
bidder.
(III.) When stoppages (whether ne-
cessary or disciplinary) take place be-
tween stations, preference to be given
to the interior of tunnels. All artificial
light will then be cut off, and the
officials of the train will run up and
down the corridors howling like wolves.
(iv.) On hearing the declaration of
any would-be traveller (as “Margate")
it shall be optional for the booking-
clerk to reply, “I double Margate";
when his opponent, the public, must
either pay twice the already increased
fare or forfeit the journey.
(v.) The quality of buns, pastry and
sandwiches at the station refreshment-
rooms to be drastically revised. A
return to be made to the more “dis-
couraging” models of fifty years ago,
which will be specially manufactured
under the supervision of the Ministry
of Munitions.
(v1.) All the too-attractive photo-
graphs of agreeable places on the com-
pany's service at present exhibited in
the compartments to be removed, and
in place of them the frames to be
filled with such chastening subjects as
“Marine Drive at Slushboro' on a Wet
Evening,” “No Bathing To-day"
(Bude), or “Fac-simile of a typical
week-end bill at the Hotel Superb,
Shrimpville.” It is felt that if this
stop at home nothing will.

Another Impending Apology.

ULTIMUS.
His shape was domed and his colour
brown,
And I took him up and I set him down
In the lamp's full light, in the very
front of it,
Ready and glad to bear the brunt of it;
And then, having raised my hand and
blessed him,
I thus in appropriate words addressed
him:-
“Oh, soon to be numbered with the
dead,
Your fortunate brothers, prepare,” I
said,
“Prepare to vanish this very day
And go to your doom the silent way.
For DEvoNPort's Lord will soon decree,
With his eye on you and his eye on me,
That you're only a useless luxury;
And, since the War on the whole con-
tinues,
We must tighten our belts and brace
our sinews,
And give up the things weliked before,
And never, like Oliver, ask for more.
Since this is so and the War endures,
I am bound to abandon you and yours,
And wherever I meet you I must frown
On your sweet white core and your
coat of brown.
But no, since you are the only one,
The last of a line that is spent and
done,
I shall give myself pleasure once again
And set you free from a life of pain.
Prepare, prepare, for I mean to punch
- you,
My lºy friend, and to crunch and
munch you.”
So saying I smiled in a sort of dream
On my absolute ultimate chocolate-
cream :
Then swiftly I reached my hand to get
him
And popped him into my mouth and
ate him.
TACTICS.

began Jeanne. Ah! but no, a recollec-
tion flashed across her mind and was
reinforced by other memories. “J'en
ai fini avec les saints,” she mused,
proceeding to the other end of the room
where, full of intention, she busied her-
self among some books. Yes, she was
now quite disillusioned ; that latest
blow, on her recent tenth birthday,
had confirmed finally her long-growing
suspicion—-prayer to the saints was
unavailing. -

THAT’s wot I sex.
Wot PEoPLE want to KEEP Dogs AT ALL For I NEveR could see.”
First Burglar. “THEY ser:M To BE JUST FINDING out THERE's Too MANY Dogs
CoME "Exi out.”
Jeanne, with an air of having some-
thing to decide for herself, paid no heed,
but resumed the study of her picture-
book description of the French Army,
murmuring: “Un colonel—est-ce que
c'est comme un saint, ou bien est-
ce que c'est comme le bon Dieu lui-
même 2"
Some moments of deep silence spent
in intense study ended with a trium-
phant: “Bon jºy suis.” That was
exactly what she had wished to dis-
cover, the very source of power. “‘Les
officiers attachés à un général pour
l'exécution et la transmission de ses
ordres,'" re-read Jeanne, and com-
mented, “Et tout cela s'appelle l'é-tat
ma-jor du général. Bon c'est bien
comme je le pensais; c'est le général
qui est à la tête de tout.”
Her course was now quite clear.
She urged and encouraged herself: “Il
faut absolument que Papa vienne en
permission. Je—le—veur" And, that
her intentions might not be thwarted,
absolute secrecy must be maintained, |
at least in so far as the chapter relating
to her terrestrial tactics was concerned ;
no one would oppose intercession auprés
du bon Dieu.
“Il faut m'adresser a tous les'
deux en même temps," pronounced
Jeanne, taking a sheet of note-paper.
“J'écris directement au général" (since
time and space have to be allowed
for in earthly negotiations, the order |
must be thus)—“et je prie le bon Dieu
en personne.” That both positions
should be assailed simultaneously,
operations must be begun in this quar-
ter in the morning, at the hour of the
first postal delivery.
“Point de saints, ni de colonels—
maintenant je comprends—l'é-tat ma-
jor dans l'Armée et les saints au
Paradis, c'est tout comme !” | -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“PUSS IN NEW Boots.”
FIVE hours is a great space out of a
man's life, but that was precisely the
time taken by Mr. ARTHUR Collins to
present his Puss in New Boots, so that
I had leisure to study the book of the
words, sold shamelessly to the unsus-
pecting (of whom I was not one), and
compare the rough sketches of our
three standard authors of the Lane,
Messrs. Collins, SIMs and Dix with
the version, by no manner of means
final, of the comedians. A pantomime
book is on the whole rather a mourn-
fully unsubtle document. The thing is
frankly not meant to be read when the
blood is cool. It is the Action, Action
and again Action of such hefty knock-
abouts as WILL EVANs, Robert HALE
and STANLEY LUPINo that makes the
dry bones live and the old squibs
crackle. And it is good fun to watch
the audience at their share of author-
ship, setting the seal of their approval
upon the happy wheeze, the well-con-
trived business, and blue-pencilling with
their silence the wash-out or the too
obscure allusion.
The show is substantially new
throughout—new songs, new scenery,
new japes, new acrobatics. A new
Puss, too, as well as new boots; and,
without any reflection on little Miss
LENNIE DEANE, who was quite an ade-
quate Puss of pantomime, we may
regret Miss RENEE MAYER. -
Miss FLORENCE SMITHSON still de-
lights the curious with her Swedish
exercises in alt, and makes a very
pretty lady of high degree for a panto-
mime marquis, who is no other than
Miss MADGETITHERADGE stepping down
from the “legitimate" and bringing
an air and an elocution unusual and
admirable. She made her excellent
speaking voice do duty in recitative for
song, and the innovation is not un-
pleasing. If it be fair in frivolous
public places to dig down to those
thoughts that better lie too deep for
tears, Mr. ALFRED Noyes' A Song of
England, clear spoken by her with
tenderness and spirit, is a better instru-
ment than most.
Mr. HALE's Baroness challenges com-
parison with Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs's.
She is perhaps more womanly (“no
ordinary" type), less grotesquely irrele-
vant and profane—though she does her
bit. On the other hand, she is more
active and less repetitive. When, the
good fairy endowing her with beauty,
she appeared as DoRIS KEANE in
Iłomance, that was an applauded
stroke. And when she lied beneath
the tree of truth and the chestnuts
fell each time truth was mishandled,
thickest of all when it was asserted
that a certain Scotch comedian had
refused his salary, this was also very
well received. On the whole, then, a
satisfactory Baroness.
Mr. LUPINo (the miller's second son)
is really an exquisite droll, and I don't
remember to have seen him in better
form. He has some of the authentic
ingredients of the old circus clown—a
very valuable inheritance.
Mr. WILL Evans is always good to
watch, always has that air of enjoying
himself immensely that is the readiest
way to favour. He seemed at times to
be, as it were, looking wistfully for his
old pal, GRAVEs; missed probably that
companionable nose and those reliable
da capos which give such opportunity

ing the recherché dinner in the gas
cooker that becomes a tank, and put-

children of all ages applaud.
I always find the Lane big scenes
and ballets more full of competing
colour and restless movement than of
controlled design... But the Hall of
Fantasy, with its spiral staircases
reaching to the flies, was an ambitious
effort crowned with success. The dance
of the eight tiny zanies was the best of
the ballet. The Shakspearean pageant
at the end might be (1) shortened, and
(2) brightened by the characters throw-
ing a little more conviction into their
respective aspects—notably the ghost
of Hamlet's father. However, as a popu-
lar tercentenary tribute to “our Shak-
speare” the scheme is to be commended
and was as such approved. T.
THE SPIRITUAL SPORTSMAN.
[The Executive of the German Sporting
Clubs and Athletic Associations have issued a
manifesto expressing satisfaction at the sub-
stitution of German for English words and
phrases. “German sport,” it declares, “ in
future places itself unreservedly on the side
of those who would further German Kultur.
German Song and German Art will in future
find a home in German sport.” This new pat-
riotic programme has been greatly applauded
in the Press, the Berliner Tageblatt observing
that the culture of soul and body must proceed
pari passu, with the result that “not only
will the German sportsman become a beauti-
ful body, but a beautiful soul as well. Every
club must have its library, not filled with
sensational novels, but with works of art.
And before all else the club-house must be
architecturally beautiful — an object from
which he may obtain spiritual edification,”]
THE German is seldom amusing,
Since humour is hardly his forte,
But I've frequently smiled in perusing
His latest pronouncement on sport;
For it seems that he thinks it the duty
Of sportsmen to aim at the goal
Of adding to bodily beauty
A beauty of soul.
They've made a good start by proscrib-
1ng
All English and Anglicised terms,
To counter the risk of imbibing
Debased philological germs;
And they've coined a new wonderful
lingo, - - -
Which only a Teuton can talk,
Resembling the yelp of a dingo,
A cormorant's squawk.
But in spite of his prowess Titanic,
His marvellous physical gift,
The soul of the athlete Germanic
Still clamours for moral uplift;
So we learn without any emotion
That, his ultimate aim to secure,
He must bathe in the bountiful ocean
Of German Kultur.
In the process of character-building
Hun Art (Simplicissimus brand),
With its rococo carving and gilding,
Must ever advance hand in hand
With its sister, Hun Song, that inspiring
And exquisite engine of Hate,
Whose efforts we've all been admiring
So largely of late.
Thus, freed from all sentiment sickly,
The sportsman whom Germany needs
Will help to exterminate quickly
All weak and effeminate breeds;
And, trained in the gospel of BISSING,
Will cleave to the Hun decalogue
Which rivets the link, rarely missing,
"Twixt him and the hog.
“I’arlourmaid wanted for Sussex ; under

tacles objected to.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Miss ETHEL SIDGwick (long life to her as one of our
optimist conquerors') still keeps her preference for the . . .
creation of charming people and her rare talent for making
them alive. But I wonder if she is not refining her brilliant
technique to the point of occasional obscurity of intention.
At least I know I had to re-read a good many passages to
be quite sure what was in fact intended. An implied com-
pliment, no doubt; but are all readers so virtuous? (“ or so
dull?" quoth she). Hatchways (SIDGwick AND JAckson) is
one of those happily comfortable, just right houses with a
hostess, Ernestine, whom everybody loves and nobody
(save her husband, and he not in this book) makes love to.
Holmer, on the other hand, is the adjoining ducal mansion
with a distinctly uncomfortable dowager still in command
who can't even arrange her dinner-parties and fails to
marry her sons to the right people. Perpetually Hatchways
is wiping the eye of Holmer, and this touches the nerve of
the great lady. Her sons, Wickford, the authentic but
hardly reigning duke, and Lord Iveagh Suir, the queer
impressionable (on whom the author has spent much pains
to excellent effect), both take their troubles to Ernestine.
And a young French aviator (this is a pre-War story),
guest at Hatchways, analyses and discusses situations and
characters from his coign of privilege—a device adroitly
handled by the discreet author, who adds two charming
girls, coquette Lise, Iveagh's first love, and wise, loyal,
perceptive Bess, whom he found at last. To those who
appreciate subtle portraiture let me commend this study.
I feel just as if I had been for a long week-end at
Hatchways, anxiously wondering, as I write my “roofer,”
if I shall be so lucky as to be asked again.
I think there is little doubt that you will agree with me
in calling The Flaming Sword (Hodder AND STOUGHTON)
as noble and absorbing a story of fine work finely done as
any that the War has produced. It is the history, told by
herself, of Mrs. ST. CLAIR STOBART's Red-Cross Mission “in
Serbia and Elsewhere.” The frontispiece, Mr. GEORGE
RANKIN's moving picture of The Lady of the Black Horse (a
name always to be honoured among our Allies), catches the
spirit of the heroic tale and prepares you for what the Lady
herself has to tell. Mrs. STOBART is no sentimentalist;
fighting and the overcoming of obstacles are, one would say,
congenial to her mettle; time and again, even in the midst
of her story of the terrible retreat, with the German guns
ever thundering nearer, she can yet spare a moment to
strike shrewdly and hard for her own side in the other
struggle towards feminine emancipation which is always
obviously close to her heart. Certainly she has well earned
the right to be heard with respect. Read this high-
spirited account of the difficulties—mud, disease, prejudice,

[A Wireless Press telegram says: “The German Imperial train has
reached Constantinople in order to transport the Sultan to Vienna, to
take part in the conference of Sovereigns to be held there."]
I HATE all trains and told them so :
I said that 'I should much prefer
(Being, as Allah knows, no traveller)
To stick to Stamboul and the status quo.
They said, “If you would rather walk,
Pray do so; it will save the fare; "
Which shows that WILLIAM (who will take the Chair)
Insists that I shall come and hear him talk.
I've never tried a train before;
It makes me sick; it knocks my nerves;
The noises and the tunnels and the curves
Add a new horror to the woes of war.

I'm summoned for appearance' sake,
To nod approval at the Chief, but take
No further part in his one-man pow-wow.

And act the silent super's rôle,
The while I wish myself, with all my soul,
Safe back in one or more of my hareems.
I'd let the Conference go hang;
Any who likes can have my pew
And play at peace-talk with this pirate crew,
WILLIAM and KARI, and FERDIE—what a gang !

And (curse this train ') to cook a plan
For Germany to pouch what spoils she can–

fighting there are other matters to be considered. Food is
scarce and of a poor quality, in Hungary as elsewhere.

Not from Hungary, where we are within a narrow margin

The Emperor. I too think we must have peace, but how
shall we obtain it when we have a friend and ally who

even to hint at any steps that would really lead to peace?
Tisza. Sire, you are a young man, but you are a scion
of a great and ancient House, which was powerful and
illustrious when the Hohenzollerns were but mean and petty
barbarian princelings. Withdraw yourself, while the op-
portunity is still with you, from the fatal domination of
this vain and inflated upstart who endeavours to serve only
his own selfish designs. Our enemies will make peace
with you, and thus he too will be forced to abandon the
War. With him and with the deeds that have outraged
the world they will not initiate any movement that tends
to peace. He must go through his punishment, as indeed
we all must, but his, I think, will be heavier than ours.

I didn't answer her because at the

adequate reason why Bobbie should
have a present, except that I so very
much wanted to give him one. Bobbie
is tall and young and red-
haired and, of course, khaki
clad. We are going to be
married “when the War is

I pondered Sister Baynes'
words until I reached Oxford

and chocolates, and finally

floor wrestling with brown paper, pre-
League, and spends all her spare time and
pocket-money in socks and cigarettes
for him. She smiled at me wanly, with
a piece of string between her teeth, and
I felt I simply must do something to
cheer her up.
“I’ve brought you some chocolates
for your cold,” I said. “Bat one and
forget the War and the weather,” and
I handed her Bobbie's box. Her neces-

Two days later Matron collared me

of letters and things to distribute.
There was a fat parcel for Martha, the

It was a chocolate box, a comfortable-

a red-headed St. George, a large blue
dragon and a vivid orange bow.
“It does seem nice,” I agreed.
“Fancy'im spending all that on me,”
said Martha.
“You'll be able to have quite a feast,”
said I, smiling at my old friend St.
George.
Martha suddenly looked shy.
“I’m not going to keep it,” she con-
fided. She came closer to me. “Do
you remember young Renshaw, what
used to be in your ward, Nurse 2"
I nodded ; I remembered him well, a
cheery boy with a smashed leg, now in

To-day she was lamb-like.
She sat at a desk piled high

lay a vivid coloured object.
“I've just had a letter
from that young Renshaw,”
she said. “Such a charming
letter, thanking us for all our
kindness and enclosing a
present to show his appre-
ciation.” She smiled. She
seemed hugely pleased about
something. “He addresses
it to me,” she went on ;
“but, though I am grateful
for the kind thought, I do
not myself eat chocolates.”
She picked up the box, a
comfortable-looking boxorna-
mented with an orange satin
bow.
“I think these are more
in your line than mine,” she said,
“and Renshaw was in your ward. You
have really the best right to them.”
She handed me the box of chocolates.
I gazed at my travelled Saint and he
gazed back. I could almost have sworn

the owld riginent to France, Herself
came home bringin' the riginental
haired billy-goat he was, the same.
Invelerate Golfer (stung by the leading article). “I suppose I AM REALLY NoN-Essex.TIAL.
ONE'S HANDICAP JUST REDUCED TO SEVEN.”
IT'S HARD TO REALISE THIS WITH
WHEN his honour the Colonel took
mascot with her. A big white long-
“I’ll not be afther lavin him at the
daypo,” says Herself; “’tis no place
for a domestic animal at all, the lan-
guage them little drummer-boys uses,
the dear knows,” says she.
So me bowld mascot he stops up at
the Castle and makes free with the
flower-beds and the hall and the draw-
in’-room and the domestic maids the
way he'd be the Lord-Lieutenant o'
the land, and not jist a plain human
Angory goat. A proud arrygent crature
it is, be the powers' Steppin' about
as disdainy as a Dublin gerrl in Bally-
dehob, and if, mebbe, you'd address
him for to get off your flower-beds with
the colour of anger in your mouth he'd
let a roar out of him like a Sligo piper
with poteen taken, and fetch you a
skelp with his horns that would lay
you out for dead.
And sorra the use is it of complainin'
to Herself.
“Ah, Delaney, 'tis the marshal sperit
widin him,” she'd say; “we must be
patient with him for the sake of the
owld riginent;" and with that she'd
start hand-feedin' him with warmed-up
sponge-cake and playin' with his long
silky hair.
“Far be it from me,” I says to
Mikeen, the herd, to question the work-
ings o' Providence, but were I the
Colonel of a rigiment, which I am not,
and had to have a mascot, it's not a
raparee billy I’d be afther havin', but
a nanny, or mebbe a cow, that would
step along dacently with the riginent
and bring ye luck, and mebbe a dropeen
o' milk for the orficers' tea as well.
If it's such cratures that bring ye
fortune may I die a peaceful death in
a poor-house,” says I.
“I'm wid ye,” says Mikeen, groanin',
he bein’ spotted like a leopard with
bruises by rason of him havin' to
comb the mascot's silky hair twice
daily, and the quick temper of the
baste at the tangles.
The long of a summer the billy stops
up at the Castle, archin' his neck at
the wurrld and growin' prouder and
prouder by dint of the standin' he had
with the owld riginent and the high-
feedin' he had from Herself. Faith,
'tis a great delight we servints had of
him I’m tellin' ye! It was as much
as your life's blood was worth to cross
his path in the garden, and if the
domestic maids would be meetin' him
in the house they'd let him eat the
dresses off them before they dare say
a word.
In the autumn me bowld mascot
gets a wee trifle powerful by dint o' the
high-feedin' and the natural nature of
the crature. Herself, wid her iligant
lady's nose, is afther noticin' it, and
she sends wan o' the gerrls to tell
meself and Mikeen to wash the baste.
“There will be murdher done this
day,” says I to the lad, “but 'tis the
orders—-go get the cart-rope and the
chain off the bull-dog, and we'll do it.
Faith, it isn't all the bravery that's at
the Front,” says I. -
“That's the true wurrd,” says he,
rubbin' the lumps on his shins, the
poor boy.
“Oh, Delaney,” says the domestic
gerrl, drawin' a bottle from her apron
pocket, “Herself says will ye plaze be

a dropeen of this ody-koloney scent—
mebbe it will quench his powerfulness,
she says.”
I put the bottle in me pocket. We
tripped up me brave goat with the
rope, got the bull's collar and chain,
and dragged him away towards the
pond, him buckin' and ragin' between
us like a Tyrone Street lady in the
arms of the poliss. To hear the roars
he let out of him would turn your
hearts cowld as lead, but we held on.
The Saints were wid us; in half-an-
hour we had him as wet as an eel, and
broke the bottle of ody-koloney over
his back.
IIe was clane mad. “God save us
all when he gets that chain off him '''
I says. “God save us it is ' " says
Mikeen, looking around for a tree to
shin.
Just at the minut we heard a great
screechin' o' dogs, and through the
fence come; the harrier pack that the
| Reserve orſicers kept in the camp be-
yond. (“Harriers" they called them,
but, begob! there wasn't anythin' they
wouldn't hunt from a fox to a turkey,
those ones.)
“What are they aſther chasin’?”
says Mikeen.
“'Tis a stag to-day, be the news-
papers,” I says, “but the dear knows
they'll not cotch him this month, he
must be gone by this half-hour, and the
breath is from them, their tongues is
hangin' out a yard,” I says. -
'Twas at that moment the Blessed
Saints gave me wisdom.
“Mikeon,” I says, “ drag the mascot
out before them ; we'll see sport this
day." º -
“Herself——” he begins.
“Hoult your whisht,” says I, “and
come on." With that we dragged 1.e
bowld goat out before the dogs and
let go the chain.
The dogs sniffed up the strong blast
of ody-koloney and let a yowl out of
them like all the banshees in the
nation of Ireland, and the billy legged
it for his life—small blame to him!
Meself and Mikeen climbed a double
to see the sport.
“They have him,” says Mikeen.
“They have not,” says I; “the crature
howlds them by two lengths.”
“He has doubled on them,” says
Mikeen : “he is as sly as a Jew.”
“I ſo is forminst the rabbit holes
now,” I says. “I thank the howly
Saints he cannot burrow.”
“Ho has tripped up—they have him
bayed,” says Mikeen.
And that was the mortal truth, the
dogs had him.
Oh, but it was a bowld billy He
went in among those hounds like a lad
to a fair, you could hear his horns
lambastin' their ribs a mile away.
But they were too many for him and
bit the grand silky hair off him by the
mouthful. The way it flew you'd think
it was a snowstorm.
“They have him destbroyed,” says
Mikeen.
“They have,” says I, “God be
praised ' "
At the moment the huntsman leps
his harse up on the double beside us;
he was phlastered with muck from his
hair to his boots.
“What have they out there?" says
he, blinkin' through the mud and not
knowin’ rightly what his hounds were
coursin' out before him, whether it
would be a stag or a 13engal tiger.
“'Tis her ladyship's Rile Imperial
Mascot Goat,” says I; “an' God save
your honour for she'll have your blood
in a bottle for this day's worrk.”
The huntsman lets a curse out of his
stuminick and rides afther them, flat on
his saddle, both spurs tearin'. In the
wink of an eye he is down among the
dogs, larruppin' them with his whip
and drawin' down curses on them that
would wither ye to hear him—he had
great eddication, that orſicer.
“Come now,” says I to Mikeen, the
poor lad, “let you and me bear the
cowld corpse of the diseased back to
Herself, mebbe she'll have a shillin'
handy in her hand, the way she'd
reward us for saving the body from the
dogs,” says I. - -
But was me bowld mascot dead?
He was not. He was alive and well,
the thickness of his wool had saved him.
For all that he had not a hair of it left
to him, and when he stood up before
you you wouldn't know him; he was
that ordinary without his fleece, he
was no n:ore than a common poor
man's goat, he was no more to look at
than a skinned rabbit, and that 's tho
truth.
He walked home with meself and
Mil:een as meek as a young gerrl.
Herself came runnin' out, all fluttery,
to look at him.
“Ah, but that 's not my mascot,”
says she.
“It is, Marm,” says I; and I swore
to it by the whole Calendar—Mikeen
too. -
“Bah! how disgustin'. Take it to
the cow-house,” says she, and stepped
indoors without another word.
We led the billy away, him hangin'
his head for shame at his nakedness.
“Ye'll do no more mascottin' avic,”
says I to him. “Sorra luck you would
bring to a blind beggar-man the way
you are now—you'll never step along
again with the drums and tambourines.”
And that was the true word, for
though Herself had Mikeen rubbing
him daily with bear's-grease and hair-
lotion he never grew the same grand
fleece again, and he'd stand about in
the back-field, brooding for hours to-
gether, the divilment clane gone out
of his system; and if, mebbe, you'd
draw the stroke of an ash-plant across
his ribs to hearten him, he'd only just
look at you sad-like and pass no
remarks.

Top-o'-the-Morning's shoes are off;

Chasing the hens for a turn at the

As ever he rode to the line of old,
Facing his fences of blood and fire
With a brow of flint and a heart of

Of a trampling crowd at the covert-

Of a lead on the grass and a glinting

Does the triumph leap to his shining

As the wind of the vale on his cheek

And the buffeting big brown shoulders

To his light heel's touch and his light

When the swords are sheathed and the
strife is done,
And the cry of hounds is a call to

When the straight - necked Wiltshire

And the first flight rides on the grass

Lead them once more in the White

have a new cook. And we are to have

Stilton and a new Panama.
As a matter of fact that is all bluff on
my part. I only want to have some-
thing in hand, to bargain with. If I
can ever get back to the status quo

Well, that is how it is. Most eagerly

28 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [JANUARY 10, 1917.
WHAT DID MR. ASQUITH DO
A FAMOUs story tells how a heckler
once broke up a Liberal meeting by
asking with raucous iteration, “What
did Mr. GLADSTONE say in 1878?” or
whatever year it was. Nobody knew,
and neither did the inquirer himself,
but uproar followed and his end was
achieved. Now had the question run,
“What did Mr. GLADSTONE do?” how
different a result | For Mr. GLAD-
STONE, apart from any trifles of states-
less things, as I will show.
Although, writes the Returned
Traveller who in our last number
was so unhappy about the deterior-
ation that has come upon taxi-
drivers, I left England only in Oct-
ober last, I find it a changed place;
but no change, not even the iniquit-
ous prices demanded by London's
restaurateurs, or the increased dark-
ness, or the queer division of hors
d'aºuvres into half-courses and whole-
courses (providing an answer at
last to the pathetic query, “What is
a sardine 2'' “A whole course, of
course")—no change is so striking
as the fact that when a paper now
refers to the PRIME MINISTER or the
PREMIER, it means no longer HER-
BERT HENRY but DAVID. In a world
of flux and mutability I had come
to think of Mr. Asquith as a rock,
a pyramid, a pole-star. But, alas !
even he was subject to alteration.
Thinking earnestly upon his career
I have realised how sad it is that
he has bequeathed us no Asquith
legend. Always reserved and intent,
he discouraged Press gossip to such
a degree as actually to have turned
the key on the Tenth Muse. Every-
body else might lunch at the hospit-
able board in Downing Street, but
interviewers had no chance. In vain
hope for even a crumb—there was
nothing for them. Mr. Asquith
came into office, held it, and left it ! .
without a single concession to Demos's
love of personalia. He did not even
wear comic collars or white hats or a
single eyeglass or any other grotesquely
significant thing; and how much poorer
are we in consequence and how much
poorer will posterity be
Contrast the case of Mr. GLADSTONE,
from whom anyone could draw a post-
card and most people a chip of some
recently-felled tree, and who is in my
mind wonderful and supreme by rea-
son of two inventions which, though
no one would ever guess them to be
the result of a Prime Minister's cogi-
tations, deserve the widest fame. Of ordinary dull occasions which provoke
these one was the product of his un- his talented if somewhat staid brush :

MACEDONIA'S ARMY.
THE FAMoUs PHALANx.
(By our Military Expert.)
THE Macedonian Army has recently
undergone an entire reconstruction at
the hands of KING PHILIP. It is now
organised on a national and territorial
basis and is divided into infantry and
cavalry. The cavalry predominates and
is therefore the stronger arm. The unit
of cavalry is the squadron, of infantry
the battalion. (It is of the utmost
interest to note that there are two
battalions in a regiment, each about
fifteen hundred strong).
KING PHILIP, it will be remembered,
received his military education in the
school of EPAMINoNDAs, who, as is
well known, revolutionised the Higher
Thought of every Higher Command
by the discovery and application of a
single tactical fact—namely, that the
chances of A being able to give B a
stronger push than B can give him are
in direct ratio to the numerical superi-
ority of A over B. It follows, then,
that, faced with a sufficient superiority,
B must retire, and the initiative them
rests with the side that possesses it.
In pursuance of this tactical ideal
ErAMINoNDAs argued that the old
method of winning battles, which was
that A should exercise superior force
against every point of B's line (or
body), required that A should be bigger
than B, buskin for buskin and brisket
for brisket. But since it is sufficient,
while “refusing" the rest of one's own
body (or line), to bring an overwhelm-

ing force to bear on the point of a

gain a local numerical superiority
which will enable him to rout B

THE FLAPPER.
[Dr. ARTHUR SHADw ELL, in the January Nineteenth Century, in
his article on “Ordeal by Fire,” aſter denouncing idlers and loafers
and shirkers, falls foul “above all ” of the young girls called flappers,
“with high heels, skirts up to their knees and blouses open to the
diaphragm, painted, powdered, self-conscious, ogling: “Allus adal-
lacked and dizened oot and a 'unting arter the men.' '')
Good Dr. ARTHUR SHADwell, who lends lustre to a name
Which DRYDEN in his satires oft endeavoured to defame,
Has lately been discussing in a high-class magazine
The trials that confront us in the year Nineteen Seventeen.
He is not a smooth-tongued prophet; no, he takes a serious
view ;
We must make tremendous efforts if we're going to win
through; -
And though he's not unhopeful of the issue of the fray
He finds abundant causes for misgiving and dismay.
Our optimistic journals his exasperation fire,
And the idlers and the loafers stimulate his righteous ire;
But it is the flapper chiefly that in his gizzard sticks,
And he's down upon her failings like a waggon-load of
bricks.
She's ubiquitous in theatres, in rail and 'bus and tram,
She wears her “blouses open down to the diaphragm,”
And, instead of realising what our men are fighting for,
She's an orgiastic nuisance who in fact enjoys the War.
It's a strenuous indictment of our petticoated youth
And contains a large substratum of unpalatable truth;
Our women have been splendid, but the Sun himself has
specks,
And the flapper can't be reckoned as a credit to her sex.
Still it needs to be remembered, to extenuate her crimes,
That these flappers have not always had the very best of
times;
And the life that now she's leading, with no Mentors to
restrain,
Is decidedly unhinging to an undeveloped brain.
Then again we only see her when she's out for play or
meals,
And distresses the fastidious by her gestures and her squeals,
But she is not always idle or a decorative drone,
And if she wastes her wages, well, she wastes what is her
GW in.
Still to say that she's heroic, as some scribes of late have
said,
Is unkind as well as foolish, for it only swells her head;
She oughtn't to be flattered, she requires to be repressed,
Or she'll grow into a portent and a peril and a pest.
Dr. SHADwell, to the PREMIER makes an eloquent appeal
In firm and drastic fashion with this element to deal;
And 'twould be a real feather in our gifted Cambrian's cap
If he taught the peccant flapper less flamboyantly to flap.
But, in I’unch's way of thinking, 'tis for women, kind and
W1se, -
These neglected scattered units to enrol and mobilize,
Their vagabond activities to curb and concentrate,
And turn the skittish hoyden to a servant of the State.
She's young; her eyes are dazzled by the glamour of the
streets;
She has to learn that life is not all cinemas and sweets;
But given wholesome guidance she may rise to self-control
And earn the right of entry on the Nation's golden Roll.
THE ONLY STEGGLES.
Steggles is my groom, and my crowning mercy. But for
his deafness I am sure he would long since have left the
humble rank of gunner far beneath him, and the Staff might
have gained a brilliant strategist. In addition to dulness of
hearing, Steggles is endowed—I should indeed be ungrateful
to use the word afflicted—with a vacuity of expression
which puts rivals or antagonists off their guard, and doubles
his value during the vicissitudes of active service. What
would be handicaps to ordinary men Steggles turns to the
advantage of himself, Sapphira my mare, and me.
When on the march the Battery arrives at the morass
allotted to it for horse lines, I know that all will be well
with the mud-bespattered Sapphira. Steggles leaps from
the waggon whereon, in company with one of the cooks, he
tours the pleasant land of France, and receives the mare.
With his toes strangely pointed out, he leads her away
from the scene of labour and language, disappearing
amidst the hovels of the adjacent village. Often I never
see him or obtain news of him till next morning, when
he produces Sapphira polished like a silk hat and every
scrap of metal about her sparkling. Occasionally I have
tracked him to the shelter where he secretes and waits
upon Sapphira, always to find that he has discovered
and occupied the best stable in the village. The grooms
of my brother-officers never learn that Steggles' vacuous
expression is the disguise of an intellect subtle, discrim-
inating and alert, so they never trouble to endeavour to
forestall him. To find Sapphira is to find Steggles, as he
always likes to spread his blanket where she could tread
on him if she wanted anything during the night.
From time to time he chooses the occasion of a night's
halt on the march to indulge in a bilious attack; but he
has no other vice except an inveterate reluctance to leave
off polishing my boots when I mount. No matter how
Sapphira may prance and back and sidle, he follows her
round and round with a remnant of a shirt, rubbing mud-
spots off my boots in the stirrup. It is quite useless to
bellow, “That will do, Steggles 1 "-his ideal is the un-
attainable perfection, and he persists. I have to escape
by giving Sapphira the spur at the risk of knocking
Steggles into the mud, or be late in turning out.
He never gives anything, even his own performances,
unqualified praise; in fact it is extremely hard to win
from him any encomium higher than “It's not too bad."
Perhaps there is Scotch blood in his veins.
I very much want to recommend him for some decor-
ation, but the organization likely to appreciate the most
gallant of his deeds has not yet been formed—the
S.P.G.P., or Society for the Preservation of Government
Property. -
Steggles was once riding behind me down a valley
liberally dimpled with shell-holes, further dimples being in
process of formation as we rode. I was returning from .
an O Pip, or Observation Post, and Steggles was carrying
a pair of my boots with a rolled puttee stuffed into
each. Suddenly I was aware that he had wheeled his horse
about, and was trotting back towards the most dimply area
of the valley. Out of regard for his family, I cantered after
him. He broke into a gallop. When, after a thrilling ride,
I caught him and had a little talk amongst the dimples, it
appeared that he had dropped one of the puttees, and
wished to return and look for it. This incident will, I
think, demonstrate the exceptional character of the man,
who did not appear to regard himself as a hero, or to
pose as a desperate fance ar, or to aspire to the post of
Q.M.S., though, incredible as it may seem, the puttee in
question was of the variety G.S.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To those who would learn what soldiering is like in the
armies of democratic France I would heartily commend
two books recently published by Messrs. ALLEN AND UNwiN,
| Battles and Bivouacs, by JACQUES RougoN, and The Diary
of a French Private, by GASTON RIou. M. RoujoN, infantry-
man of the line, was in private life a journalist on Le
Figaro; M. RIOU, Red Cross orderly, a liberal lay-theologian
and writer of European reputation. The former's trans-
literator (“Munitions are distributed around,” writes he
undismayed; and has also discovered a territory known as
“Oriental Prussia”) obtrudes a little between author and
reader. M. RIOU fares better; but both contrive to give a
really vivid impression of the horrors and anxieties of the
early days of the War before the tide turned at the Marne, of
the flying rumours so far from the actual truth, of the fine
spirit of camaraderie in common danger, of the intimate
relations between officers and men, details, terrible or trivial,
of campaigning, and, because our spirited brothers-in-arms
are not ashamed to express their innermost feelings, of
the deeper emotions at work under the surface gaieties.
M. RIou's narrative is mainly the record of his year's
captivity in a Bavarian fort. On his way he faced the
fanatical hatred and cruelty of the German civilians, of the
women especially, with a cynical fortitude. The com-
mandant of his prison, Baron von STENGEL, was, however,
a gentleman and a brick, and did everything in his power
to make the difficult life bearable. An episode pleasant to
recall is the reception of the Russian prisoners (intended by
their captors to cause dissensions) by their French comrades
in misfortune. The whole record gives an impression of
fine courage and resourcefulness.
Very probably you are already acquainted with that restful
and admirable book, Father Payne (SMITH, ELDER), of which
a new edition has just now been published. The point of
this new edition is that, in its special Preface, the genesis
and authorship of the book are assigned, for the first time
on this side the Atlantic, to Mr. A. C. BENSON. And the
point of the new preface is that it entirely gives away
the original edition (also printed here), in which the secret
was elaborately concealed. My wonder is, reading the book
with this added knowledge, that anyone can have at any
time failed to detect in it the gently persuasive hand of the
Master of Magdalene, Cambridge. You remember, no
doubt, how Father Payne (a courtesy title), having had a
small estate left to him, proceeded to turn it into the home
of a secular community for young men desirous of pursuing
the literary gift, and how he financed, encouraged and
generally supervised them. Leisure, an exquisite setting,
and the society of enthusiastic and personally-selected
youth—one might call the book perhaps a Tutor's Dream
of the Millennium. Anyhow, Father Payne, as shown in
this volume, which is practically a record of his table-talk

upon a great variety of themes, is exactly the gentle, shrewd
and idealistic philosopher whom (knowing his parentage)
one would expect. Bensonians (of the A. C. pattern) will
certainly be glad to have what must surely have been their
suspicions confirmed, and to admit Father Payne to the
shelves of authenticity.
Miss DoRothea CoNYERs has long ere this established
herself as a specialist of repute in Irish sporting tales.
You will need but one look at the picture wrapper of The
Financing of Fiona (ALLEN) to see that a repetition of the
same agreeable mixture awaits you within. Fiona was a
charming young woman (Irish, of course) with a rich uncle
and a poor, very unattractive cousin, who loved her for her
expectations. As Fiona had no conception about money
beyond the spending of it, the uncle made a will, whose
object was that she should have plenty. The suitor, how-
Skookum Creek, where he grows tomatoes and studies
Indians, he meets his Cinderella, with the result that his
life has to be completely rearranged. A commonplace tale,
but there is a rare and distinct flavour about the telling of
it. Mr. NIVEN's manner has indeed a very particular
charm, over which one would take an even keener pleasure
in lingering if only he himself lingered a little less over
his story.
I hardly think that Madame ALBANESI has chosen quite
the most appropriate name for the story that she calls
Hearts and Sweethearts (HUTCHINson). Personally, I fancy
that Suits and Lawsuits would have come nearer the mark;
because, though there is a certain proportion of love-making
in the tale, there is considerably more about going to law.
One difficulty with which I fancy the writer had to con-
tend is due to the fact that her hero and heroine are (in a

able person, destroyed part of it, with the result that Fiona
was apparently left only [- -
the ancestral home and no
cash to keep it up. So she
was forced to take in gentle-
man boarders for the hunt-
ing, and (for propriety's
sake) to invent a mythical
chaperon, who lived above
stairs. And, after all, she
needn't have done any such
thing, because the rich
uncle, in leaving her all
the contents of the man-
sion, had foolishly forgotten
to mention a secret drawer
full of Canadian securities.

Naturally, therefore, till this

What I like particularly about Mr. FREDERick Niven is
the friendly way in which he contrives to make his readers

at the beginning of a chapter in Cinderella of Skookum
Creek (NASH), “get a move on with the story, in case you
become more tired of Archer's compound fracture than he
was himself.” This is by no means the only occasion on
which he shows his thoughtfulness for us, and I think it
very kind and nice of him. At the same time I will
ungraciously admit that the weak point of his story is
that it does not move quite fast enough. Admirable artist
in psychology and atmosphere, his plot, if you can call it a
plot, is very slight. Cyrus Archer, the young American of

start because he could never remember dates), goes out

THE MINIATURE.
WHEN I left her, Celia had two
photographs, a British warm and an
accidental coffee-stain, by which to re-
member me. The coffee-stain was the
purest accident. By her manner of
receiving it, Celia gave me the impres-
sion that she thought I had done it on
purpose, but it was not so. The coffee-
cup slipped-in-me-'and - mum, after
which the law; of gravity stepped in,
thus robbing what would have been a
polite deed of most of its gallantry.
However, I explained all that at the
time. The fact remains that, in what-
ever way you look at it, I had left my
mark. Celia was not likely to forget
Ine. - --
But she was determined to make sure.
No doubt mine is an elusive personality;
take the mind off it for one moment
and it is gone. So I was to be perpetu-
ated in a miniature.
“Can it be done without a sitting 2"
I asked doubtfully. I was going away
on the morrow.
“Oh, yes. It can be done from the
photographs easily. Of course I shall
have to explain your complexion and
so on.”
“May I read the letter when you've
explained it 7”
“Certainly not,” said Celia firmly.
“I only want to make sure that it's
an explanation and not an apology.”
“I shall probably put it down to a
bicycle accident. Which is that?——
No, no,” she added hastily, “Kamerad 1"
I put down the revolver and went
on with my packing. And a day or two
later Celia began to write about the
miniature.
The stars represent shells or months,
or anything like that; not promotion.
I came back with just the two—one
on each sleeve.
We talked of many things, but not
of the miniature. Somehow I had for-
gotten all about it. And then one day
I remembered suddenly.
“The miniature,” I said; “did you
get it done?” - i-
“Yes,” said Celia quietly.
“Have you got it here?”
“Yes.”
“Oh, I say, do let me see it.”
Celia hesitated.
“I think we had better wait till you
are a little stronger,” she said very
gently.
“Is it so very beautiful ?”
“Well—”
“So beautiful that it almost hurts 2
Celia, dear, let me risk it,” I pleaded.
She fetched it and gave it to me. I
gazed at it a long time.
“Who is i; ?” I asked at last.
“I don't know, dear.”
“Is it like anybody we know?”
“I think it's meant to be like you,
darling,” said Celia tenderly, trying to
break it to me.
I gazed at it again.
“Would you get me a glass?” I
asked her. -

“You don't,” she said soothingly.

“He has.

Then another thing struck me.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON ('HARIVARI.
LETTERS FROM MACEDONIA.
II.
MY DEAR JERRY,-No doubt you think
from the light-hearted tone of my last
letter that life here is a bed of roses.
In reality we have our flies in the
ointment—nay, our shirt-buttons in
the soup. The chief of the flies is
artillery, both our own and that of the
people opposite; and the worst of the
shirt-buttons is jam. It sounds strange,
but it is true.
There was a time in the olden days
when we welcomed gunner-officers, but
those days are unhappily past since
we met Major Jones. Learn then the
perfidy of the Major and ec uno disce
Ojh ji.e.S.
I had a nice little 'ouse up in the
front line, well hidden by trees. It
wasn't a house, Jerry, I wish you to
understand; it was merely a little 'ouse
standing in its own grounds like, with
a brace or so of chickens and a few
mangel-wurzels a-climbin’ round the
lace. You know what it's like.
Well, Major Jones, who had been my
guest several times in this little 'ouse
of mine, came round a few days ago
with a worried look and an orderly.
“I want you to come and look at my
telephone,” he said hurriedly.
“What is it? Is anything wrong?”
I asked sympathetically.
“I fear the worst. Something ter-
rible may happen in five minutes,” he
replied darkly.
I gripped his hand silently, and he
returned the pressure with emotion.
In silence we walked the two hundred
yards which lay between my place and
his observation-post, and I watched
while his orderly got busy with the
telephone.
“Is Number One gun ready ?” de-
manded the Major.
It appeared that Number One was
itching to be at it.
“Fire!” said the Major.
“Fire!” said the orderly.
A moment later there was a terrific
explosion.
“Number One fired, Sir,” observed
the orderly.
“It is well you told us,” I said
sweetly, “otherwise I could never have
believed it.”
But the Major heeded me not.
was staring over my shoulder.
“Good shot, by Jove!” he yelled.
“A perfect beauty Holed out in
one !” -
I turned to see what had caused his
sudden joy. But where was my little
'ouse? Had it suddenly turned into
that nasty cloud of dust? Even as I
looked my water-bucket reached the
ground again.
He
“Awfully sorry, old man,” said the
Major, with a ghastly pretence of sym-
pathy. “You see it was in our way.”
I brushed aside his proffered hand
(rather good that, Jerry. Let's have
it again. I say I brushed aside his
proffered hand), and strode back dis-
mally to what had once been my home
from home.
Now I live in a little dug-out beneath
the ground, chickenless and mangel-
wurzelless, awaiting with resignation
the day when the Sappers shall find
that I am in their way and blow me
ll lo.
Another little game of the gunners is
called “Artillery Duels.”
In the good old days, when a man
wanted a scrap with his neighbour, he
put a double charge of powder into his
blunderbuss, crammed in on top of it
two horse-shoes, his latch-key, an old
watch-chain, and a magnet, and then
started on the trail. It was very effec-
tive, but of course some busy-body
“improved ’’ on it. Nowadays our
gunners ring up the enemy's artillery.
“Hallo! Is that you, straſe you ?
What about an artillery duel, eh?”
“Oh, what fun!” says the enemy.
“Do let's.” And then they start.
“A hearty give - and - take, that 's
what I like,” remarks a cheery gunner
officer.
A moment later he rushes to the
telephone.
“Is that you, enemy 2” he asks.
“I say, dash it all, old man, do be
careful! That last one of yours was
jolly near my favourite gun.”
“By Jove, I’m awfully sorry, old
thing,” calls back the enemy. “What
about shortening the fuses a bit, eh?”
“Good idea! Waken up the foot-
sloggers too. They need it sometimes.”
Then for fifteen minutes large shells
rebound from the bowed head and
shoulders of the unfortunate infantry-
Illal).
Which reminds me of George.
George had a strafe-proof waistcoat
procured by him from a French manu-
facturer. He showed it to us proudly,
and also the advertisement, which
stated that the waistcoat would easily
stop a rifle-bullet, whilst a “45” would
simply bounce off it. It was beautiful
but alarming to see his confidence as
he stood up in a shower of shells, pray-
ing for a chance of showing off the
virtues of his acquisition.
We were very pleased to send to his
hospital address to-day a postcard
bearing the maker's explanation that a
'45 revolver bullet, and not a 45 milli-
metre shell, was meant.
As regards the jam question, Jerry,
the fault of the jam is that it is never !
jam, but always marmalade. I feel
too sore on the question to write much,
but I may just hint that we have heard
that Brother Bulgar sometimes gets
real strawberry. It is just possible,
therefore, that you may hear of a raid

THE War has done many astonishing
things;
It has doubled the traffic in trinkets
and rings;
It has reconciled us to margarine
And made many fat men healthily lean.
It has answered the critics of Public
Schools
And proved the redemption of family
fools.
It has turned golf links to potato
patches
And made us less lavish in using
matches. • .
It has latterly paralysed the jaw
Of the hitherto insuppressible SHAw.
It has made old Tories acclaim LLOYD
GEORGE, -
Whose very name once stuck in their
gorge.
It has turned a number of novelists
Into amateur armchair strategists.
It has raised the lowly and humbled
the wise
And forced us in dozens of ways to
levlse
The hasty opinions we formed of our
neighbours
In view of their lives and deaths and
labours.
It has cured many freaks of their futile
hobbies,
It has made us acquainted with female
bobbies.
It has very largely emptied the ranks
Of the valetudinarian cranks,
By turning their minds to larger ques-
tions - -
Than their own insides or their poor
digestions.
It has changed a First Lord into a
Colonel,
Then into a scribe on a Sunday journal,
With the possible hope, when scribbling
palls,
Of doing his bit at the Music Halls.
It has proved the means of BIRRELL's
confounding
And given Lord WIMBORNE a chance
of re-bounding.

The letter ran as follows:–
SIR,--I find that George, the young
man I employ as house-boy, has be-
come friendly with one of your maids,
and I shall be glad if you will co-operate
with me so far as is possible in trying
to prevent their meeting, as I do not
think it desirable that there should
be further communication between
our households than is, unfortunately,
necessary.
I should not have troubled to write
to you had it not been that George
strongly resented my interference with
his private affairs when I remonstrated
with him just now on the matter.
Servants are so deplorably independent
in these times, and men as useful as
George are so difficult to obtain, that
I do not care to open the subject with
him again.
The maid of yours in question is the
one who goes out on Wednesday even-
ings. As that is also George's evening
out, perhaps you could arrange to let
this particular maid go out on another
evening instead.
Faithfully yours,
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
“What confounded sauce!” I said,
and replied formally as follows:–
DEAR MR. PETHERTON, It must, I
am sure, be most alarming to you to
find that servants of ours are hobnob-
bing and perhaps discussing our affairs.
Unfortunately to make the alteration
you suggest would throw the whole of
our domestic staff out. I know the
maid to whom you refer; she is our
parlour-maid, and you are right in de-
scribing her as “this particular maid.”
She is most particular. It is true that
men are hard to obtain for domestic
employment, even ineligibles (and I am
sure yours is that), but maids are, if
anything, more difficult to find. My
wife had no end of trouble in procuring
this parlour-maid, and she is a treasure
whom we do not wish to lose.
I have been aware for some time
that she is engaged in the pleasurable
occupation of what is known as keep-
ing company with your factotum, but
thought it wise not to interfere.
It is still in the air, as one might
say, that you are engaged in experi-
mental chemical work for the Govern-
ment, and I should have thought, and
hoped, that this would occupy your
mind to the exclusion of such trivial
affairs as servants' love-making.
Yours sincerely,
HENRY J. Fordyce.
Petherton quickly countered with :—
SIR,--I am sorry that I should have
appealed to you in vain. It is not
a pleasure to write to you, and it is
positively distasteful to have to read
your absurd letters in reply. I passed
George in the village this evening with
his arm round your parlour - maid's
waist. I was absolutely disgusted, and
must emphatically protest against such
familiarity even among the minor mem-
bers of our households.
Faithfully yours,
FREDERIck PETHERTON.
Joyously I rushed to respond;—
DEAR PETHERTON, -Your letters, on
the contrary, are a positive delight to
me. One of the reasons why I should
not like to interfere is the feeling that
it might put an end to our correspond-
ence.
Personally I cannot visualize the

spectacle of similar familiarity between
any of the major members of our re-
spective households.
I myself passed your man this even-
ing as I was on my way to the Vicar-
age, and at the moment he was in mild
dalliance with our housemaid. I say
mild because they were only arm-in-
arm. On my return about an hour
later I passed George again, and it is
true that this time he was with our
parlour-maid, and had his arm round
her waist as you describe.
There is no doubt that the young
man has a penchant for my staff, but
so far no Government secrets have
reached my ears, and no details of your
personal doings, past, present or future.
“Carry on " is the motto of the day,
so why not let well alone? Were you
never a young man 2
Ever yours, HARRY FordycE.
Petherton was getting very worked-
up, to judge from his reply:—
SIR,--I disapprove of your levity.
This is a serious matter to me. On
your own showing George's behaviour
is scandalous, and although I should
scarcely expect you to look at the
matter in its proper light I should have
thought that even you would have in-
terfered now that matters have reached
such a state. Your attitude is in-
tolerable.
I am well able to protect the Gov-
ernment's secrets, and my movements
could be of little interest even to you,
but I do not think the society of your
maids desirable for a young man like
George. I strongly suspect that they
are having a bad influence over him.
He is becoming careless in his work.
I accidentally overheard him say, in
conversation with the grocer's man, that
he was—to use his own expression—
walking out with a Miss Parsons. Is
this either your parlour-maid or house-
maid 2 or is it some third person 2
Yours faithfully,
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
DEAR old CHAP (I replied), Thank
you for your cheering letter. I hope
neither of us will say or do anything
that would terminate this exchange
of letters, which is keeping me from
dwelling too much on the War.
Miss Parsons is our cook, as worthy
a young woman as ever riveted an
apple-dumpling or tossed a custard.
She would make George an excellent
wife. Don't worry about the parlour-
maid or housemaid. They would, I am
sure, be delighted to be at the wedding.

For the benefit of others I give
below a record of my procedure º

I waited a fortnight. There was
no reply. I therefore despatched
a follow-up letter. I explained my
regret at receiving no response to
|
º2
letter No. 1, and suggested that 4% -
perhaps it had been inadvertently
overlooked, or had gone astray in
transit. Alternatively I hinted that
perhaps the firm regarded the list
of my qualifications as incredibly
pretentious, and I assured them fº
that it in no way exaggerated my
good points.
I had indeed become,
if possible, even more conscientious
and industrious since I had last
written, and having recovered from
a cold in the head from which I
was then suffering I was actually "
in better physical condition than before.
I reminded the firm that in granting me
a preliminary interview they incurred
no liability whatsoever.
Another two weeks went by, and still
no answer. So I despatched Follow-
up Letter No. 2.
This briefly referred to my two
previous communications, and asked
whether it was not clear to them that,
by securing my services while I was in
possession of all my faculties and
the full vigour and strength of my
being, there were advantages they
could not possibly acquire with me
in, say, another thirty years, when
I should probably be suffering from

ling (£20) on the salary originally asked
if the firm engaged me within ten
days from the date of the offer.
I gave them twelve days in which to
respond, but still received no answer, so,
after allowing a further two days' grace,
I despatched Follow-up Letter No. 4,
stating that as they had evidently been
prevented from replying to my special
offer I had decided to extend the period
for acceptance by fourteen (14) days,
reckoning from the date of the present
communication. At the end of that
period the salary demanded would be
increased by ten pounds (£10) over and
above that asked in my first application.
Thus, by accepting the existing offer of
twenty pounds (£20) reduction, they
would really be securing me at thirty
pounds (£30) less than my market
price.
I waited patiently for a further four-
teen days, and then sent Follow-up
Letter No. 5.
This letter was quite brief. It made no
attempt to disguise the fact that I was
hurt at the firm's silence, and it hinted
at enquiries from other employers of
labour whose needs would have to
be considered. It intimated also
that I could not possibly hold myself
at the firm's disposal indefinitely,
and that unless a prompt reply was
received I could not guarantee
acceptance. By way of a crush-
ing suggestion of niggardliness on
their part I enclosed a stamped
addressed envelope.
An answer came by return of
post as follows:—
DEAR SIR,--In reply to your
letter, we beg to say that the
vacancy to which you refer was
filled some ten (10) weeks ago.

MR. BLAIR, the L.C.C. Education
Officer, is dissatisfied, according to The
Daily Chronicle, with the questions put
at school examinations, on the ground
that they do not test the thoughtful-
ness and ingenuity of the pupil. The
“Why" as well as the “What” should
be developed, and to illustrate the value
of the method proposed Mr. BLAIR sug-
gests various sample questions, e.g.:-
“How do you account for the density
of the population in Staffordshire?
“Find out from your atlas the dis-
tance from London to Glasgow. How
long would it take you to go there by
train 2 What would the third-class fare
be at a penny a mile 2
“How can we discover the minimum

tion of a bean 2

“ARIstotle remarked that a bee will .
one journey from the hive. Find out Pimpernel?
if this is true, and, if true, point out
its significance from the point of view
of the flower.”
As Mr. BLAIR remarks, a quest is
better than a question. We agree, and
venture to start a few more quests:—
“Find out from Who's Who the
literary productions of Miss MARIE
CoRELLI and Mr. HALL CAINE, and
trace their effect on the density of the
population of Warwickshire and the
Isle of Man respectively.
“ARISTOTLE remarked that one swal-
low does not make a summer. Find
out whether this is true, and, if true,
explain its bearing on the thirst of the
swallower.
“Find out on your map the distance
from Madrid to Jaffa, and state what
would be the cost of a cargo of Spanish
onions and Jerusalem artichokes de-
livered in the London Docks.

sary for the incubation of a Scarlet

A DREAM SHIP.
OH I wish I had a clipper ship with carvings on her
counter, -
With lanterns on her poop-rail of beaten copper wrought;
I would dress her like a lady in the whitest cloth and
mount her -
With a long bow-chasing swivel and a gun at every port.
I would sign me on a master who had solved MERCAtoR's
riddle,
A nigger cook with earrings who neither chewed nor
drank,
Who wore a red bandanna and was handy on the fiddle,
I would take a piping bos'un and a cabin-boy to spank.
Then some fine Summer morning when the Falmouth cocks
were crowing
I would set my capstan spinning to the chanting of all
hands,
And the milkmaids on the uplands would lament to see me
goln
As I beat for open Channel and away to foreign lands,
Singing—
Fare ye well, O lady mine,
Fare ye well, my pretty one, -
For the anchor's at the cat-head and the voyage is begun,
The wind is in the mainsail, we're slipping from the land
Hull-down with all sail making, close-hauled with the
white-tops breaking,
Bound for the Rio Grande.
Fare ye well!
With the flying-fish around us and a porpoise school before
uS,
Full crowded under royals to the south'ard we would
sweep; -
We would hear the bull whales blowing and the mermaids
sing in chorus,
And perhaps the white seal mummies hum their chubby
calves to sleep. - -
We would see the hot towns paddling in the surf of Spanish
waters, - - - -
And prowl beneath dim balconies and twang discreet
guitars,
And sigh our adoration to Don Juan's lovely daughters
Till they lifted their mantillas and their dark eyes shone
like stars. -
We would cruise by fairy islands where the gaudy parrot
screeches -
And the turtle in his soup-tureen floats basking in the
calms;
We would see the fire-flies winking in the bush above the
beaches
And a moon of honey yellow drifting up behind the
palms.
We would crown ourselves with garlands and tread a frolic
measure
With the nut-brown island beauties in the firelight by
the huts;
We would give them rum and kisses; we would hunt for
pirate treasure,
And bombard the apes with pebbles in exchange for
coco-nuts.
When we wearied of our wand'rings 'neath the blazing
Southern heaven
And dreamed of Kentish orchards fragrant-scented after
Taln,
Of the cream there is in Cornwall and the cider brewed in
Devon,
We would crowd our yards with canvas and sweep
foaming home again,
Singing— -
Cheerily, O lady mine,
Cheerily, my sweetheart true,
For the blest Blue Peter's flying and I'm rolling home
to you;
For I'm tired of Spanish ladies and of tropic afterglows,
Heart-sick for an English Spring-time, all affire for an
English ring-time,
In love with an English rose.
Rolling home !
MISGIVINGS.
WALRING recently by Hyde Park Corner I met a man in
a comic hat. He was an elderly man, very well set up,
marching along like an old officer—quite an impressive
figure with his grey moustache and grey hair, had not this
ridiculous affair surmounted him. It was not exactly a
hat, and not exactly a cap, but something between the two,
and it was so minute as to be almost invisible and wholly
absurd. Yet there was every indication that its wearer
believed that it suited him, for he moved both with
confidence and self-satisfaction.
And as I watched him, and after he had passed, swinging
his stick and surveying the world with the calm assurance
of a connoisseur of most of the branches of life I began
to entertain solºe very serious and disturbing doubts. For
(thought I) here is quite a capable kind of fellow, of mature
age, making a perfect guy of himself under the profound
conviction that he is doing just the reverse and that that
pimple of a hat suits him. No doubt, judging by the cut
of his clothes and his general soigné appearance, he stands
before his glass every morning until he is satisied. Had
he (thought I) any accuracy of vision he would see himself
the grotesque thing he is in that idiotic little cap. But his
vision is distorted.
It was then that I began to go hot and cold all over, for I
suddenly realised that my vision might be distorted tºo.
My hat hitherto had satisfied me; but suppose that that
too was all wrong. And then I wondered if anyone really
gets a true return from the mirror, or if we are not all
bemused; and, remembering those astounding hats in which
WINstoN used to be photographed a few years ago, I
asked myself, “Where are we, when even the groat legis-
lators can go so wrong?"
Although all this soul-searching occurred several days
ago, I am still nervous, and I never catch sight of my
reflection in a shop window without suspicion racking me;
while to see a smile on the face of an approaching pedestrian
is agony.
But (you will say) why not ask the hatter or some
intimate friend to select the hat for you? I guessed you
would suggest that. But it won't help; I'll tell you why.
Some years ago I knew a fat man with a big head—a
journalist of great ability—who made himself undignified
by perching upon the top of that great and capable head
a little bowler. Its inadequacy had always annoyed
me, but never more so than when, on my arriving at our
place of servitude one morning (we were on , the same
paper) in a new and perfectly becoming hat, he said to
me, “That hat's all wrong. You should never choose
a hat for yourself. I never do. I get my wife to choose
mine for me.” Remembering this I am even more
unsettled than before. I see no hope.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE idea of publishing Frederick the Great: The Memoirs
of his Reader, Henri de Catt (1758-1760) (CoNSTABLE) was
that we are all so passionate against Prussianism that we
want to plank down our money for two volumesful of ob.
servations at first hand about the man who was the source
and origin of that dark and swollen stream. Personally, we
doubt the general zeal in this matter—not of Prussianism
but of FREDERICK. However, DE CATT, looking at a king
from a queer angle, is extraordinarily diverting. “Reader”
was a euphemism for a patient audience, including claque.
FREDERIGR, incognito on a Dutch barge, picked up the
young scholar and marked him down as one who could
be induced by florins and flattery to take on the job of
listening to his patron's bad French verses and his after-
dinner flutings of little things of his own, his approving
observations on his own conduct, his battles, his philosophy
of life and politics, no doubt calculating that it would all be
jotted down on fateful scraps of paper and given a favour-
able colouring for the edification of the world. Well, the great
FREDERICK put it over me all right. Frankly I rather liked
the old fellow, his old clothes (there was at least no shining
armour swank at Potsdam in those days), his practice of
solemnly cutting capers for the benefit of his “reader,”
though I know not explicitly what a caper is, his Billings-
gate language, his real opinion of VoITAIRE, his charming,
if possibly rare, acts of magnanimity, his moderation in
war, which was not all hypocrisy. In fact, if you expect an
ogre you will be disappointed. He could give the latest
Hohenzollern points in a good many directions. - I ought,
of course, to add that a learnedly allusive preface by Lord
RosBBERY graces the volume, and that the very competent
translation is by F. S. FLINT. -
These are days when the more we know about Russia
and things Russian the better. Specially timely, then, is
the appearance, in an English translation, of The Fisher-
men (STANLEY PAUL), by DIMITRY GREGoRovITSH. It is a
wonderfully appealing story, which has been put into
English—presumably by Dr. ANGELo RAPPopoRT, though
he is only credited on the title-page with the authorship of
the Preface—in such a way that the spirit of the original
is admirably preserved. I had not read a couple of pages
before the charm of the style laid hold upon me. The story
is quite simple, concerned only with a group of peasants,
fisher-folk, living on the banks of a great river. GREGoRo-
VITsh is like TourgenIEv in his devotion to peasant and
country types, but otherwise more akin to our own younger
school of realists in the minuteness of his observation.
Throughout the story abounds in character-study of a kind
that, while building up the figure with a thousand details,
will add suddenly some vivid touch that brings the whole
wonderfully and unforgettably to life. An example of this
is Akim, that perfect type of the hopeless incompetent, whose
very futility, while it rightly exasperates his fellows, makes
him a delight to the reader; so that his death, at the end
of the first part, comes with an effect of personal loss. For
my own part, as poor Akim had never once before accom-

plished what he set out to do, I was quite expectant of his
recovery, and proportionately disappointed. Throughout
also there are pen-pictures of Russian scenery, full of vivid
colour; while the story itself, though inevitably in a some-
what minor key, is never sordid or pessimistic. Emphatic-
ally therefore a book for everyone to read who cares to
know the best in the literature of our great Ally.
MARGARET DELAND's well-proved pen gives us a spirited
sketch of a modernist American woman in The Rising Tide
(MURRAY). I don't quite know how this enigmatic sentence,
which I have long puzzled over and frankly given up, came
to escape both author and reader: “Once Mrs. Childs said
to tell Fred her Uncle William would say it was perfect
nonsense.” I feel sure it is not good American. However,
Freddy Payton is a young girl who tells the inconvenient
all to begin again. Maybe we might forgive him that, for
of such staple are good yarns spun, but why in heaven's
name should bold Edmund Layton of Liddesdale go about
to make himself and us miserable with feckless scruples
that ruined the happy ending we had fairly earned ? Either
he was right to let CHARLEs STUART escape that day in the
mist, in return for former generosity, or he was wrong;
and one would have expected him to make up his mind
and there an end, and not fret himself into a pother and
Mr. JoHN Foster's story into a most inartistic anti-climax
over such a subtlety. All the same a rattling good tale,
full of hard knocks as well as bright eyes, and with morè
than a smack of STEvenson. :
I fancy that I ought perhaps already to know The
Wood-Carver of 'Lympus (MELRose), which, hailing origi-
truth to everybody about
everything, and you may
guess that such candour
does not make for peace.
Mrs. Payton elects to keep
her idiot son in the house,
and Freddy thinks an asy-
lum is the proper place for
him, and says so. The late
Mr. Payton was a rake, and
Freddy derides her mother's
weeds on the ground that
the widow is really in her
heart waving flags for de-
liverance, but daren't admit
it. Freddy offers cigarettes
to the curate, which is
apparently a much greater
crime over there than here.
Freddy finally, carried along
by the rising tide, asks the
man she loves to marry
her, mistaking his friend-
ship for something stronger,
and learns that, as the old-
fashioned people like her
mother realise, men are
essentially hunters and,
“won't bag the game if it
perches on their fists.” I
wonder! But Freddy got

story. Miss MARY E.
WALLER has written a
singularly refreshing and
that reveal a great sym-

the hearts of simple people.
Hugh Armstrong, the central
figure, is a youth in a New
England mountain farm,
condemned to perpetual in-
activity through an acci-
dent. At the beginning of
the story we see him, in the
depths of misery, visited by
a casual passenger from the
stage coach, whose atten-

his story as related by

elderly man who was waiting round the corner. In fact,
Freddy is rather a sport, and if Mrs. DELAND intended her as
a tract for the times, in the manner of Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD,
her shot has miscarried—at least so far as I am concerned.
Edmund Layton, thick in the arm and at times, be it
confessed, thick in the head, was so thoroughly in love
with The Bright Eyes of Danger (CHAMBERs), and the
brighter eyes of Charlotte Macdonell, Jacobitess, that in the
rousing days of the YoUNG PRETENDER he not only lightly
risked his life when his lady was in need, but more than
once went out of his way to make things quite unneces-
sarily hazardous for himself, when I or any other of his
more canny Hanoverian friends was longing to give him
warning. For instance, when that taking villain, Philip
Macdonell, aſter beating him in the race for the French
treasure buried in the sands of Spey beside the sunken ship
(vide the frontispiece mystery chart), soon after fell comfort-
ably into his hands, he had no more discretion than to take
him out to fight a duel; whereon, as we others foresaw,
- — in, which help to bring com-
fort to the farm; books and letters arrive from unknown city
dwellers. Thus the tale is a record of increasing happiness,
but kept (an important thing) from cloying by the tragedy
upon which it is built. If you will not be put off by American
dialect or by the rather startling discovery that one of the
kindliest characters is named Franz, you will, I believe, find
a brief stay upon 'Lympus most beneficial to your spirits.

THE GOLFER'S PROTEST.
* "AMONG the shocks that laid us flat
When WILLIAM loosed his wanton hordes
There fell no bloodier: blow than that
* - Which turned our niblicks into swords;
And O. how bitter England's cup,
In what despair the order sunk her
That called her Cincinnati up
When busy ploughing in the bunker!
Even with those who stuck it out,
Bravely defying public shame,
Wisions of trenches knocked about
Would often spoil their usual game;
Rumours of victory dearly bought,
Or else of bad strategic hitches,
Disturbed their concentrated thought
And put them off their mashie pitches.
. Now comes a menace yet more rude
That puts us even further off;
It says the nation's need of food
- Must come before the claims of golf;
We hear of parties going round,
Aided by local War-Committees,
To violate our sacred ground
By planting veg, along our “pretties."
If there be truth in that report,
_Then have we reached the limit, viz.:-
The ruin of that manly sport
” Which made our country what it is;
The ravages we soon restore
By conies wrought or hoofs of mutton,
But centuries must pass before
A turnip-patch is fit to putt on.
What! Shall we sacrifice the scenes
On which our higher natures thrive
Just to provide the vulgar means
To keep our lower selves alive 2

HAPPY C.-IN-C.—I saw the Commander-in-Chief to-day
passing through the little village of X in an open car. He
was very quietly dressed in khaki, with touches of scarlet
on the hat and by the collar. I waved my hand to him
and he returned the salute. It is small acts like this which
endear him to all. I noticed that the Field-Marshal was
not carrying his baton. Doubtless he did not wish to spoil
its pristine freshness with the mud of the roads.
OF Course.—A friend in the Guards tells me that th9
new food restrictions do not affect the men in the trenches
very seriously. Our brave soldiers are so inured to hard-
ships by now that they willingly forgo seven-course dinners.
. Not StARVING.-While on the subject of food, the pic-
ture published on page 6 of to-day's issue refutes the idea
that the Hun is starving. It represents the KAISER looking
at some pigs. The KAISER can be distinguished by a x.
FASHIONS FOR MEN.—Now that mid-winter is with us it is
quite a common event to meet fur-clad denizens of the
firing line. Some of the new season's coats are the last
word in chic, one which I noticed yesterday, made of
black goat, having pockets of seal coney with collar and
cuffs of civet. The wearer's feet were encased in the latest
style of gum boots, reaching to the thigh and fastening
with a buckle. These are being worn loose round the
ankle. A green steel helmet, draped in sandbag material,
completed the costume. The field service cap was not
being worn inside the helmet. - “. -
NUMBER NINE-The Army doctors, so it seems, do not
fully understand the delicate constitution of a friend of
mine in the Blues, and sent him back to duty after dosing
him with medicine, though he is suffering from pain in
the foot. The medicine generally takes the form of a
“Number Nine,” the pill that cures all ills; but last time
he went on sick parade they were out of stock, and he was
given two “Number Fours” and a “Number One” instead.
Rough-and-ready pharmacy. What? -
SPIRITED.—Met my old chum, Sir William , just
back from the trenches. Dear old Billy, what cigars he
used to smoke in the good old days He tells me that
when on a carrying fatigue the other night one of his
men dropped the earthenware receptacle which contains
Tommy's greatest consolation in this terrible war, and {
every drop of the precious liquid was spilt. Five minutes
later a Jack Johnson landed beside him and put things
right. It gave him a rum jar. Good, eh? - - - -
WHERE. To LUNCH.-I am just off to lunch with my
old pal, the Hon. Adolphus Lawrie-Carr, of the Motor
Transport Section of the A.S.C.. I have never seen him
look better than he does now, in hunting stock and field
: crop and spurs. He always gives one a first-class

THE NEXT PUSH.-I had a most interesting conversation
the other day with Alphonse, late of the Saveloy. He is
on the G.H.Q. Staff in a position of high trust—something
to do with the culinary arrangements, I believe—and is, of
course, in the know. From what he told me confidentially
I can assure all my countless readers that there will be
fighting on the Western Front during 1917, and, in the
words of Mr. Hilary Bullox, “If it is not prolonged until
next year, the present year will certainly see the end of
the War.” More I cannot divulge. -

A WAY NOT TO PAY OLD DEBTS,
“HULLo, old thing !” said Herbert
gloomily; “lots of congrats. Lucky
devil, you,” and he sighed unobtrusively.
I had forgotten that once upon a
time Adela had refused to walk out
with Herbert because of his puttees,
which she said were so original that
they distracted her attention from the
way he proposed.
Remembering this now, I offered
my cousin a sympathetic cigarette,
which he, shaking himself free from
hospitality and an unaccustomed awe
withheld me from referring to so sordid
a matter as the inconsiderable decrease
in my lately-invested capital. Herbert,
however, deprecated heroics, and, as
he was saying good-night, came of his
own accord to the subject of debts.
He was always a conscientious fellow.
“You know, old chap,” he said with
charming candour, as I saw him off
from the doorstep, “you must remind
me to pay up that two quid some time.
I keep forgetting, and when I do
remember, like now, I haven't any
months our financial relations remained
unaltered—at any rate in my own esti-
mation.
Adela II arrived, so we did our best to
hush her up; we thought that if we
could smuggle her to, say, the age of ten
and send her to school Herbert couldn't
possibly come and congratulate us
about her. That only shows how
much we didn't know; for Herbert
procured some leave three weeks later
and was excitedly mounting our stairs
within a few hours.
“Pr'aps,” whispered Adela bravely as
care, accepted; after which he
began to borrow ten pounds—
an achievement which, I am
proud to say, cost him nearly
twenty minutes' hard labour.
Not so very long afterwards
Adela and I had a honeymoon,
followed by a picture-postcard
from Herbert. He said he was
sorry he hadn't been there to
throw boots at us, but he was
convalescing on the Cornish
Riviera, the exact spot being
marked with a cross; also one
could not send money by post-
card, but I was not to think he
was forgetting about that fiver
he had borrowed.
The first part of this docu-
, ment caused Adela to wonder
vaguely if wounded officers ought
to convalesce in chimney-pots,
but the last words gave me some
twinges of a more sincere alarm.
Was Herbert's dehusion a per-
manency, or merely a slip of the
pen 2 -
“Adela,” I decided, “let’s ask
Herbert to dinner as soon as
ever he leaves the roofs of the
British Riviera.”
Then one day, when I was
writing letters in the Mess, he
strolled in. “Hullo!” he said,
“where's the C.O. ? What? . . .
Oh, thanks awfully, and . . .
Oh, I say, good Lord! I owe
N.C.O. “HERE! 3DST GRAB THE ooj AH AN’ DASH RouxD

Private (ex-professor of languages) learns later that he was
expected to fetch a bucket of coke from the stores.
he was being announced, “he'll
forget about money — p'r'aps
he'll even put it up a bit.”
I smiled cynically, and was
justified ten minutes later, when
Herbert's conscience, troubled
and apologetic, reminded him
about that guinea he owed me.
At the christening it fell to
half-a-quid, and, according to
Herbert's latest allegation, it is
only his rotten memory for
postal-orders that prevents him
from sending me that dollar at
Once. -
And so, precariously, the mat-
ter rested till to-day, when the
| final blow fell from the War
Office. Herbert and I are to
proceed to France together next
Monday. On that day, if I am
ingenious and agile enough not
to meet him before, we ought to
be about all square; after that,
as far as I can see, there will
be an inevitable moment when
say, old fellow, you can't let me
me for the other day, can you?

got a Sou . .
it increase even at the rate at
which Herbert's has decreased,
but I will not pay it. Herbert,
you three quid, don't I?” and he
driftedly out abstractedly.
“Three " I echoed dizzily, as the
door banged. I staggered home for the
week-end. .
I found Adela having an excited
conversation with the telephone in
the hall.
"Ooo !” she said, hanging up the
receiver, “Herbert's a hero. He 's
just been telling me. And he's coming
to dinner to-night.”
“l also,” I responded with emotion,
“have a tale to unfold,” and I unfolded
it.
When at last Herbert, moving mod-
estly under the burden of a newly
acquired D.S.O., arrived at the flat,
money to do it with. Cheero !” The
door clicked and 1 swooned.
It was very difficult; I could not
even make up my mind whether my
best policy was to stalk Heibert with
vigilance or to avoid him as persistently
as discipline allowed. On the one hand
he wasn't the cheque-book kind of man
and he wouldn't pay me unless he saw
me. Contrariwise, he wouldn't even if
he did, and whenever he saw me my
original loan of ten gold sovereigns
might continue its rapid decline. Fin-
ally I decided to abstain from his
society.
Shortly after this momentous decision
the War Office sent him off to some re-
mote part of the country, and for many
of course, will always be kind to me
about it, for he is a generous creature,
and every time we go into action he
will probably wring my hand and beg
me not to worry about it any more.
“Old man,” he will be saying on the
twenty-ninth occasion, “if I get done
in, promise you won't bother about that
thousand pounds you owe me—remem-
ber you're to think of it as paid.”
I shall remember all right.
“In a corm and meal merchant's shop, where
two or three cats are kept for business pur-
poses, the cats may be seen feeding at will from
the open sacks.” –Spectator.
This lapse on pussy's part goes rather
against the grain. -
He was still far away when
Herbert will turn to me with, “I
have that ten bob you touched |

no, I won't. I will let my ima-

From “Tempora” (Rome).
Admittedly, the peril is extreme.
Crustumerium has fallen, and also
Ostia. However, Janiculum, the key
to the whole outer system of the
City's defences, still stands, and there
is accordingly no immediate cause
for dismay. But we are strongly of.
the opinion — so rapid has been
LARs Porse.NA’s advance hitherto–
that the bridge over the Tiber should
be at once destroyed as a precaution-
ary measure while there is yet time.
We have every confidence in the con-
tinued capacity for resistance of the
strong garrison at Janiculum, but it is
necessary to be prepared for every
eventuality; and if the fortress should
fall without the bridge being demolished
the latter would inevitably be seized
by the enemy, and the Tiber, our last
line of defence, would be lost to us.
For the rest, the spirit of the people
is excellent. It has become almost a
truism to say that nowadays none is
for a party, but all are for the State.
| Rich and poor have learned to help and
respect each other. Indeed, in these
brave days Romans, in Rome's quarrel,
have poured out blood and treasure un-
sparingly for the common cause. We
are like a nation of brothers.

HoRATIUS To Hold BRIDGE-HEAD.
CAN THE BRIDGE BE DESTRoy Ed
IN TIME 2
The Secretary to the Senate announces:
“The War Council met at the River
Gate immediately on receipt of the
news of the fall of Janiculum. It was
decided to accept the offer of Port-
Captain HoRATIUS (S.P.Q.R.'s Own),
SPURIUS LARTIUS (Ramnian Regt.),
and HERMINIUs (“Titian Toughs”),
who gallantly volunteered to hold the
bridge-head in order to give time for
the bridge itself to be destroyed. All
hope of saving the town should not
therefore be abandoned.
From our Special Correspondent.
I have just returned from the River
Gate, where I was, I believe, the first to
applaud one of the Patres Conscripti
(commanding the Axe-and-Crowbar
Volunteers), who set a fine example by
actually starting on the demolition of
the bridge himself. Already you could
see the Tuscan hordes in the swarthy
dust that shrouded the Western horizon.
I was myself in a position to pick out
ASTUR, who was girt with the brand
which (I am informed by a high
authority) none but he can wield.
There is no need to describe to you
the firmament-rending yell that rose
when the presence of the false and
shameful SEXTUs was officially moti-
fied. One saw women who hissed
and even expectorated in his direction,
and more than one child, I noticed,
shook its small fist at him with splendid
spirit. . . . . - -
I am told that HoRATIUS spoke out
pretty plainly to the Senate, expressing
the opinion that three men could easily
hold the bridge-head. The gallant
officer, interviewed while he was in the
act of tightening his harness, declined
to say much, merely expressing the
opinion that everyone has got to die
some time and that there was, after all,
some satisfaction in being killed in a
fight against odds. I confess I was
favourably impressed by the very non-
chalance of his attitude.

The Secretary to the Senate announces:
“Latest advices show that HoRATIUS
has despatched ASTUR, and, though
slightly wounded in this encounter, has
been able to keep his place in the line.
The bridge head is still being held and
there is now a pause in the fighting.
The total enemy casualties up to the
present are estimated at: Killed, 7;
Wounded, 0; Missing, 0. Our own
casualties are: Killed, 0; Wounded, 1 ;
Missing, 0. A regrettable incident took
place during the demolition of the
bridge, a Lictor having sliced himself
with one of his own axes and being
compelled to relinquish his valuable
labours.”

(By our Special Correspondent.)
IIon ATIUS, the only one of the
“dauntless three” (as they have been
already named) about whose safety
doubts were entertained, has swum
the river and is safe. I saw him,
when the bridge fell, standing alone,
but obviously with all his wits about
him, despite the ninety thousand foes
before and the broad flood behind.
When he turned round he might have
seen, I believe, from where he was
standing (just where, on other occa-
sions, I have stood myself) the white
porch of his home. His lips parted
as if in prayer. The next moment,
pausing onl
guined sword, he took a graceful dive
into the river.
Some moments of terrible tension
ensued. When at last his head ap-
peared above the surges, a cry of in-
describable rapture went up, and I am
happy to place on record the fact that {
I distinctly detected a note of generous
cheering from the Tuscan ranks. ,

"EAD-WORK.
Bob Winter is our local carrier. His
old grey mare Molly—or a predecessor
very like her, driven by Bob's father
before him—has jogged into town on
market days as long as anyone in the
village can remember. The weather-
beaten, oft-patched tilt of Bob's cart
must have heard in its day generations
of village gossip, and a mere inspection
of the cargo on the flap which lets
down at the back will provide quite an
amount of interesting information, such
as “whose new housemaid's tin trunk
be a-goin' to station already, lookee,
and who be a-getten a new tyre to ees
bicycle—see.”
: Now, however, there is a likelihood
that Bob may be called up; and the
fate of the carrying business hangs in
the balance.
“Never mind, Bob,” I said (I had
overtaken him and old Molly sauntering
up the steep hill above the village); “if
it comes to that, you know, the women-
folk will have to take turns at the
carrying while you are away. I believe
I should make rather a good carrier.”
Bob shook his head and looked
evasive.
| “No, Miss,” he said, “’twuddn' do,
ſtwuddn' do at all.”
THIS IS A BIT OF ALL RIGHT, I DON'T THINK.
TRAININ', AN' NAH THEY MAKES A BLOOMIN' LANCER of ME!”
“Come,” I said, “you don't mean to
say Molly would be too much for me?”
“No, Miss, 'tain't Molly, but—well,
'tain't no job for a lady, ain't the
carryin'; leastways, not to my way o'
thinkin’.”
“Oh, but I should get the people at
the shops to help me with the heavy
things.”
Bob cleared his throat loudly and
looked more uncomfortable still. Then
at last he decided to take the plunge.
“'Tain't the liftin' that do be troublin’
I, Miss,” he said confidentially, “’tis
the 'ead-work. I don't believe there
be a wumman livin' could do it. There
be a tur’ble lot of 'ead-work in the

THE PURIFIED PRUSSIAN.
[Writing in Die Woche a well-known Baroness, a leader of Berlin
society, discusses the transformation, and, purification of Berlin con-
viviality by the War. Social functions accompanied by eating have
altogether ceased and given way to more refined gatherings—aesthetic
afternoon teas and elegant evening parties—at which the conversation
reaches heights of brilliancy unheard of in the old carnivorous days.
Unhappily snobbery still prevails, “every class-pretending to be richer
and better than they are—small officials, officers, landowners, all
pretending to be millionaires, and doing their pretension shabbily."]
ONE of the leading Prussian social stars
Opines that War, although it makes for leanness,
Not only banishes discordant jars
And purifies Berlin of all unclearness,
But places her, beatified by Mars,
Upon a pinnacle of mental keenness,
Changing the cult of trencher and of bowl
To feasts of reason and o'erflows of soul.
The gross carnivorous orgies of the past
Have gone, and in their place is something finer;
Emotions of a transcendental cast
Preoccupy the luncher and the diner;
The Hun, in short, by being forced to fast,
Has grown ethereal, more alert, diviner;
And, purged of all incentive to frivolity,
His speech has almost lost its guttural quality.
His talk, of old to stodginess inclined,
Now sparkles with consistent coruscation,
Attaining h’,ights of mirth and wit combined
Unknown to any previous generation,
But always exquisitely pure, refined
And spiritual, as befits the nation
In which the nicer touch was never missing
Down from great FREDERICK to blameless BissiNg.
'Tis easy, though the writer does not tell,
To guess the themes which prompt the brightest
sallies;,
Louvain; the Lusitania; Nurse CAVELL–
With these Hun wit most delicately dallies;
The wreck of Reims; the Prussic acid shell;
The desolation of Armenia's valleys;
The toll of Belgian infants slain ere birth—
All these excite Berlin's ecstatic mirth.
And yet a slight amari aliquid
Is mingled with this lady's honeyed phrases;
Berlin society is not yet rid
Of one of its less admirable phases;
There is, in other words, one fly amid
The precious ointment of the writer's praises;
In every class are those who ape the airs
Of the superior nobs and millionaires.
But still, when all reserves are duly made
For negligible faults in tact or breeding,
The picture by this noble scribe displayed
Of high-browed Hundom makes impressive reading;
For homage to convivial needs is paid
Without the faintest risk of over-feeding,
And, braced by frugal fare, the Prussian brain
Soars to a perfectly celestial plane. - - - -

James. “BUT I IIAVE. I've DRAwn THE BED CoapUSCLES IN THE BLOOD or A FROG.”
A FLEETING DETACHMENT.
Private Albert Snape, A.S.C. (M.T.),
stepped off the footboard of X. 33, a
mediaeval Vanguard, and splashed his
way round to the driver. “I'm fair
sick o' this 'ere Flanders, I am,” he
complained, expectorating dolorousl
into the sea of mud; “’spose it .#
be up to the blinkin' axles before Feb-
ruary 2” He stirred the mixture with
a cautious foot.
“Not 'arf, ole sport," replied the
driver, carefully unsticking a cigarette
from his underlip. “But yer ought to
'ave bin out larst winter, then yer did
'ave to sit above yerself to keep yer
tootsies dry.”
“Wot—wuss than this?" exclaimed
the disconsolate one.
- “Wuss!” was the withering retort.
“Wy, when I tells yer that some o'
them Naval 'Umming-birds, t'other
side o' Popinjay, fitted out an ole Blue
‘Ammersmith with a pair o' propel-
lers . . . Wuss!" He exhaled scorn-
fully and gave a turn to the lubricator.
“Any chance o' getting down Wer-
melly way? They say it ain't 'arf bad
there.” Albert brightened up at the
thought.
“'Tain't likely,” was the sharp and
unsympathetic reply. “'Oo do yer
think's goin' ter do this little job if
they takes our lot away? Wy, this
'ere road is just like 'Igh 'Olborn to
me; I knows all the 'umps and 'ollows
blindfold.”
Albert returned to the stern sheets
and considered the most feasible
method of desertion.
Half-an-hour later, when the day-
light had gone, X. 33, generously over-
flowing with a detachment of the 20th
Mudlarkers, was, in company with man
other vehicles, making her inharmoni-
ous way along the “Wipers" road.
Judging from the plunginess of her
progress and the fluent language of the
man of oil, it was evident that some of
the “'umps and 'ollows” had passed
from the driver's memory. Not that
such a slight matter could damp the
spirits of the passengers. Rather it
served to entertain them.
“We 'ave gone an' fallen out of the
dress-circle this time,” a voice ex-
claimed after an extra steep dive into a
badly-filled shell crater.
Albert, wet and unsociable, hung
gloomily on to the back rail.
“Carn’t see wot they got to be so
blinkin' 'appy abart,” he muttered
savagely; “I don't believe it's 'arf bad
in them trenches.” He ruminated
bitterly on the thought that his job
was probably the worst one on the
whole front, and made a resolve to put
the matter right.
When the final ...}}. had
been reached and the 20th Mudlarkers,
after the usual indescribable mêlée,
had been put upon the path that would
ultimately lead them (if they were
fortunate enough to avoid all guides,

philosophers and , friends) to their
trench, the man of oil was profanely
grieved to discover that Albert Snape
had abandoned X. 33 for the unknown.
As a matter of fact Albert had slipped
away and followed the Mudlarkers,
with a hazy idea that a rifle would
fortuitously present itself. That an
extra unit could possibly be noticed
never occurred to him. He had a
vague intention of joining a cavalry
regiment. Very soon he lost the Mud-
larkers, and then, by an easy sequence
of events, himself.
“Wha goes there?” whispered a
hoarse voice almost in his ear. It gave
him quite an unpleasant start, but, sup-
pressing his first inspiration, which was
to say the Life Guards, he answered,
“I’m a Mudlarker l’’
“This iss the Seaforths in supporrt,”
remarked the sentry; “ye'll be in the
firrst line, na doot. Ye'll hae to go
back, an' it's the firrst turnin' tae the
left, an’ keep as strecht as ye can.”
The Highlander stepped back into the
deeper shadows and the self-recruited
Mudlarker continued his career.
He traversed what seemed to him an
interminable number of trenches with-
out encountering anyone. There was a
reason for this i. of companionship,
but it did not at first appeal to his
imagination. Suddenly he was startled
by the vicious “phut, phut, phut of
unpleasantly close shooting, and bullets
began to splash and grease along the
bottom of the trench, accompanied by:
the stutter of a machine gun. .
Miraculously untouched, he slid over
the parados and lay, sweating with
fright, in the watery furrow of a turnip
field.
The trench was one that was seldom
used, being thoroughly exposed to en-
filading fire. At stated periods through
the night a machine gun was turned on,
a proceeding which, beyond gratifying
the Huns, had no sort of effect. Albert,
in blissful ignorance of all such customs,
floundered about amongst the turnips
until he came across a Jack Johnson
crater. From this he emerged even
wetter than before. A little later he
became mixed up with some barbed
wire. The more he tried to get away
the more inextricably he became in-
volved with it. A star shell burst over-
head, and a German sniper, seizing the
chance of a lifetime, put in four rounds
rapid fire.
Albert lost the lobe of an ear and
had his breeches shot through, but he
managed to escape from the wire and
find another furrow. Mere dampness
no longer inconvenienced him, there
were so many other things to think
about. He crawled stealthily on his
hands and knees and found the barbed
wire again. At length he heard the
welcome sound of voices. He crawled
faster until he became aware that the
voices were not speaking English, This
discovery turned him to stone. For an
hour—perhaps two hours—he remained
as still as a hare in its form.
Suddenly, blurred and crouching
figures appeared out of the night.
They moved quickly and silently. One
of them nearly trod upon his hand, but
he was too dazed to think of committing
himself to either speech or action.
“Give it 'em l’’ cried a voice a few
seconds later, and the roar of the ex-
ploding bombs signified that it had
been given.
Instantly pandemonium broke loose.
Machine gun and rapid rifle fire burst
forth from the German front trenches,
and streams of bullets swept over the
intervening ground like a gigantic hail-
storm ; then some field batteries began
to burst H.E. shrapnel above the
disturbed area, while star shells and
magnesium flares threw an uneven light
over the whole scene.
: A breathless body cast itself down
beside the now completely mesmerised
Albert: “We ain't 'arf upset the blink-
in’ beehive. Lumme! it’s—” -
The prone figure suddenly became
silent, gave a convulsive kick or two
and rolled over towards the man who
still lived. " . . . . - - -
..It was sufficient. Something seemed
to draw very tense in Albert's brain and
his body reeled into action.
Blindly and without coherent
thought he ran shouting across the
field, stumbling and falling over the
slippery and uneven surface, but always
º himself up and flinging his
ody onward into the unknown.
A subaltern, who was examining a
kuminous watch, received him at the
charge as he fell into an English first-
line trench. They struggled wildly to-
gether in the mud to the accompani-
ment of startling language on the part
of the subaltern. -
Then Albert, having reached his limit
of endurance, had the supreme tact to
faint. -
A little later, in a well-found dug-out,
the patient was refreshing himself with
copious draughts of brandy.
“Who are you, and what the devil
are you doing here?” asked the still
indignant officer.
Albert did not hesitate longer than it
takes to swallow.
“Lorst me way, I 'ave, Sir. I'm
with X 33, attached to Mechanical
Transport, an’ if I ain't back pretty
quick my mate 'ull fair 'ave a bloomin'
fit.”

LIONS AT PLAY.
By A SUBALTERN.
THE Colonel rustles his newspaper,
smites it into shape with a mighty fist,
rips it across in a futile endeavour to
fold it accurately, and, casting it furi-
ously aside in a crumpled mass, says,
after the manner of all true War I,ords,
“Umph.” Whereupon the Ante-Room
as one man takes cover.
The Colonel then turns cumbrously
in his chair, permitting his eye to rove
round the room in search of the unwary
prey. He smiles cynically at the intense
concentration of the Auction parties;
winces at the renewed and unnatural
efforts of those who make music; glares
unamiably at the feverish book-worms,
and suddenly breaks into little chuckles
of satisfaction. The Ante-Room peers
cautiously round to discover the iden-
tity of the unfortunate victim, and
chuckles in its turn. The Adjutant,
checked in his stealthy retreat, hastens
back, arranges the table and chess- ||
board, pokes the fire with unnecessary
energy, and sits down. At once the
Ante-Room abandons its cover.
The Colonel begins by grasping the
box, turning it upside down, and spill-
ing the contents over the sides of the
table. The Adjutant immediately apolo-
gises for his clumsiness. The Colonel
then liberally spreads out the pieces,
selects two pawns, and offers the Ad-
jutant the choice of two fists. The
Adjutant chooses. Each fist opens to
disclose a white pawn.
expansive smile over his little joke
quickly turns to a frown at the Adju-
tant's º laughter. He sus-
pects the Adjutant. He seizes two
more pieces, offers his opponent another
choice, but, to the latter's huge delight
and his own discomfiture, eventually i
discovers that both are black. He ac-
cordingly makes use of his casting
vote and selects white.
The Colonel plays a smashing game.
When it is his turn to move he never
pauses to make up his mind. His mind
is already made up. All he has to do,
immediately the Adjutant has finished
touching up his position, is to move
the piece his eye has been piercing
throughout the long period of his
opponent's cautious deliberation. When
the Colonel moves a piece he may be
said to get there. All obstructions are
ruthlessly swept aside with a callous
indifference to Hague Conventions,
}.

Should a knight haply descend from
the clouds and settle on the correct
square it arrives more by luck than
judgment. Tradition alleges that when-
ever the Colonel is called upon to move
his king in the earlier stages of the
game all lights are turned off from the
neighbouring town in accordance with
the Defence of the Realm Regulations.
However true this may be—the respon-
sibility rests on the Padre's capable
shoulders—when his king is moved in
the later stages the Colonel pushes it
along by half-squares in a haphazard
and preoccupied manner. He invariably
fills his pipe when the end is in sight,
but leaves it unlighted so that he may
cover his ultimate defeat by a general
demolition of matches.
On this occasion the Adjutant ski!-
fully snipes the Colonel's queen in the
sixth move. The Colonel immediately
retrieves the piece from the box, asks
where it was before, examines it with
the essence of loathing and revolt, re-
moves it out of his sight, and refuses
to take it back, although he had mis-
taken it for another piece. In retalia-
tion he proceeds to concentrate all his
effectives on his opponent's queen, and,
after sacrificing the flower of his forces,
drives the attack home and gains his
objective with the greatest enthusiasm.
He remarks that the capture was costly,
but that honour is satisfied, and would
the waiter kindly approach within ear-
shot 2
While the Adjutant is working up
his offensive on the Colonel's right
flank, the Colonel himself is making
independent sallies on the left, unless,
of course, he is compelled to march his
king out of a congested district into
more open country. On the rare occa-
sions when he is at a loss for a moment
what to do he makes it a practice to
move a pawn one square in order to
gain time. By this method, unex-
pectedly but none the less jubilantly,
he recovers his queen—only to see it
laid low again by enfilading fire from a
perfectly obvious redoubt.
After twenty minutes of battle the
Colonel's area becomes positively
draughty, and the sole survivors of his
dashing but sanguinary counter-attack,
the king and two pawns, have assumed
the bored and callous air of a remnant
that has fought too long and is called
upon to fight again. The Colonel has
just unceremoniously pushed his sov-
ereign to the rear with a flick of his
nervous irritated little finger. His
opponent can obviously bring him to
his knees in two moves. Instead of
which the Adjutant brazenly com-
mences with massed bands and colours
flying to execute a masterly tactical
advance with the whole of his com-

(In desperation) ANY LADY on GENTLEMAN PRESENT KNow THE
mand—cavalry, infantry, church and
tanks, in order to achieve the destruc-
tion of the two bantam bodyguards.
This is not playing the game, and
the Colonel fumes inwardly and frets
outwardly. In the intervals of pressing
down the unlit tobacco in his pipe with
an oscillating thumb, he alternately
pokes his king out of the corner and
pulls it back again; while his trans-
parent impulse is to scrap the board,
wreck the ante-room and run amok.
The Adjutant continues his innocent
amusement until at last the pleasure
wanes. The two heroic pawns are
carried decently off, and he apolo-
getically whispers his suspicions of a
checkmate to his commanding officer.
The Colonel brushes aside the Mess
President's tinder-lighter, shatters the
mute triumph of the serried black ranks
of the hostile forces with one superb
elevation of the eyebrows, smashes three
matches in quick succession, and proves
that all the time his mind has been pre-

saying after the manner of all true War

A LUCID EXPLANATION.
It was my task to collect from their
relatives particulars as to the where-
abouts of the wounded of our neigh-
bourhood, for the purposes of our local
report. It wanted five minutes to
twelve, the sacred dinner-hour of the
British artisan; and one name re-
mained upon my list, against which
was a poncilled note, “Reported return-
ing home.” Did that mean that he
was disabled ? And should I manage to
gather the necessary information before
the clock struck? * . . .
I knocked at the door, which was
opened by a woman wearing a canvas
apron with a very tight string, her
head surmounted by hair-curlers and
a cloth cap. º -

remarked with affected cheerfulness,
“Well, come, anyhow he is able to

“Oh, 'e can write right enough—got

“Yes, but I mean if he is able

JERRY, My LAD,-We have
lost a dear friend, and with him,
alas, the piping days of peace.
No; he is not dead, or even mori-
bund, but his friendship for us
lives no longer. His name is
Feodor, and he is a Bulgar
comitadjus, or whatever is the
singular of “comitadji," and he
lived until lately in No. 2 Dug-
out, Hyde Park, just over the
way. " ..
It is a moot point which de-
lighted us the more, Feodor's
—J charming manner or his exqui-
site trousers. These two characteris-
tics were the more pleasing because of
their perfect contrast; for whereas his
manner was refined and retiring, his
trousers were distinctly aggressive in
their flaunting shameless redness.
Feodor's appearances were at first
spasmodic. This was only natural,
seeing that he had not yet instilled
into us his own attractive habit of
laisser aller and laisser faire, and that
his red trousers offered such a beautiful
mark.
He would appear suddenly, smile
seraphically towards us, and then dis-
appear before our snipers could get on
to him. At first of course we tried to
pot him, but gradually our ferocity
gave way to amazement and then to
tolerance. At last came a day when
Feodor climbed on to his parapot
and made us a pretty little speech.
We cheered him loudly, although we,
didn't understand much of it. Next
day we brought down an interpreter

pedal down.
His
second performance was even more
ispirited than the first, and after a grace-
ful vote of thanks to our benefactor we
asked the interpreter to oblige.
It appeared that from his boyhood
Feodor had been apprenticed to an
assistant piano-tuner in Varna. Rosy
days of rapid promotion followed, and
the boy, completely wrapped up in his
profession, soon became a
the old, old story of vaulting ambition.
The youth, his head turned by
material success, sought to consolidate
his social position by a marriage above
his station, and dared to aspire to the
hand of a full piano-tuner's daughter.
The old man tried gentle dissuasion
at first, but the obstinate pertinacity of
the stripling made him gradually lose
patience. He was a hale and hearty
veteran, and when the situation came
to a climax his method of dealing with
it was stern and thorough.
Seizing the hapless Feodor during
an evening call he interned him in the
vitals of a tuneless Baby Grand, and for
three hours played on him Chopin's
polonaise in A flat major, with the loud
On his release Feodor
had lost his reason and rushed to the
nearest police-station to ask to be sent
to the Front immediately. His object,
he explained, was to end the War. The
Bulgar authorities thought the plan
worth trying and sent him off as a
comitadjus; and to these circumstances
we were indebted for his society.
Every day we saw more and more
of Feodor, and we grew to love him.
As to sniping him now—the idea never
entered our heads. Accordingly, while a
deafening strafe proceeded daily on both
sides of us, we remained in a state of
idyllic peace and hatelessness.
Then arrived the cruel day when the
Brass Hats came round, and a large
and important General asked us—
“But are you being offensive enough
to the enemy in front?”
“Offensive to Feodor,
possible !”
“You must be offensive,” he rejoined.
“I don't think there is sufficient hate
in this part of the line.”
It was this unfortunate moment
that Feodor chose to step on to his
parapet and call out cheerfully to the
Great Man—
“Good morning, Johnee l"
For one tense moment I thought
the General would burst. By an effort
he pulled himself together, however,
and shouted to my troops in a voice of
thunder—
“At That Person in front—fifteen

though I think most of our sights were
a little high, accidents will happen.

and his time back towards home would,
if it had been taken, make a world's

From Arthur Vivian, Bury Street, St. James's, to
Mrs. Morton, Dockington Hall, Bucks.
DEAR MRs. MoRTON.—Just a line to thank you very
sincerely for my delightful visit. It was like old times to
see you all gathered together in hospitable Dockington and
to find that the War, terrible as it is, has not altogether
abolished pleasant human intercourse in England, in spite
of what the Dean said. But then Deans are privileged
persons. -
I am sorry to say, by the way, that in the hurry of
departure this morning I took away the wrong umbrella
and left my own. I am sending back the changeling with
all proper apologies.
It has a crook handle (cane) and a plain silver band with
my initials engraved on it. Please give my love to Harry
and the children. -
Yours always sincerely,
No. II.
From the Dean of Marchester to Mrs. Morton.
DEAR MRs. MoRTON, I desire to thank you for three
most agreeable days spent in congenial company. You
have indeed mastered the secret of making your guests feel
at home, and Dockington even in war-time is still Dock-
| ington. Pray give my warm regards to Mr. Morton and
remember me suitably to the dear children. I wish they
wouldn't keep on growing up as they do; childhood is so
delightful. . - - -
I find to my great regret that by some inexplicable
mistake I took away with me an umbrella that is not mine.
I am sending it back to you, and shall be deeply beholden
to you if you will pack up and send to me the one I left.
It is an old one, recognisable by its cane handle (crook) and
| an indiarubber ring round the shaft. Pray accept my
| apologies for the trouble I am giving you.
Yours very sincerely, CHARLEs MELDEw.

From Brigadier-General Barton to his

DEAR MARY,+You gave me a capital time. There's a
slight difference between Dockington and the trenches.
| I'm not as a rule a great performer with clergymen, but I
liked your Dean. By the way, when I dashed off your
man put somebody else's umbrella in with me, instead of
my own, which is a natty specimen. The one I've got is
an old gamp with a stout indiarubber ring to it. I haven't
time to send it back. Every moment is taken up, as I cross
to France to-night. Besides, how can you pack such a
thing as an umbrella? It's much too long. Keep mine
till we meet again. Best love to Harry and the kids.
Ever yours, ToM.

that I never took it with me to Dockington at all. I am

fact, I haven't. - -

From Mrs. Morton to her Sister, Lady Compton.
. . . We had a few friends at Dockington last week, not a
real party, but just a few old shoes—Tom, Arthur Vivian
and the Dean of Marchester and Mrs. Dean. Since they
went away I've had the most awful time with their um-
brellas. They all took away with them the wrong ones,
and then wrote to me to send them their right ones. Arthur
Vivian never brought one, and whose he took away I can't
say. In fact I've been exposed to an avalanche of returning
umbrellas, and Parkins has spent all his time in doing up
the absurd things and posting them. He has just celebrated
his seventieth birthday, and these umbrellas have ruined
what's left of his temper. Umbrellas still keep pouring
in, and nobody ever seems by any chance to get the right
one. It's the most discouraging thing I've ever been
involved in. As far as I can make out the Dean's umbrella
is now in the trenches with Tom. If ever I have a party
at Dockington again I shall write, “No umbrellas by
request," on the invitations.

Roving along the King's highway

And what may you have in your pack?"
“Why, a shirt,” says I, “and a song or two
To make the road go faster.”
He laughed: “Ye'll find or the day be through
There's more nor that, young master.
Oh, roving's good and youth is sweet
And love is its own reward;
But there's that shall stay your careless feet
When ye come to the Sign o' the Sword.”
“Riddle me, riddlemaree," quoth I,
“Is a game that's ill to win,
And the day is o'er fair such tasks to try"—
Said he, “Ye shall know at the inn.”
With that he suited his path to mine
And we travelled merrily,
Till I was ware of the promised sign
And the door of an hostelry.
And the Romany sang, “To the very life
Ye shall pay for bed and board;
Will ye turn aside to the House of Strife?
Will ye lodge at the Inn o' the Sword *"
Then I looked at the inn 'twixt joy and fear,
And the Romany looked at me.
Said I, “We ha' come to a parting here
And I know not who you be.”
But he only laughed as I smote on the door:
“Go, take ye the fighting chance;
Mayhap I once was a troubadour
In the knightly days of France.
Oh, the feast is set for those who dare
And the reddest o' wine outpoured;
And some sleep sound after peril and care

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN, the eminent in other branches of art take to
literature, criticism must naturally be tempered with re-
spect. This is much how I feel after reading Sir WILLIAM
RichMond's The Silver Chain (PALMER AND HAYWARD).
Probably, however, I should have enjoyed it more had
not the publishers indulged in a wrapper-paragraph of
such unbounded eulogy. If anybody is to call this novel
“a work of great artistic achievement,” and praise its
“ philosophy, psychology, delightful sense of humour,
subtle analysis” and all the rest, I should prefer it to be
someone less interested in the wares thus pushed. For
my part I should be content to call The Silver Chain by
no means an uninteresting story, the work of a distinguished
man, obviously an amateur in the craft of letters, who
nevertheless has pleased himself (and will give pleasure to
others) by working into it many pen-pictures of scenes in
Egypt and Rome and Sicily, full of the glowing colour that
we should expect from their artist-author. But the tale
itself, the unrewarded love of the middle-aged “Philosopher.”
for the not specially attractive heroine Mary, and the sub-
ordinate very Byronic romance of Herbert and Annunziata,
quite frankly recalls those early manuscripts that most
novelists must have burnt before they were quit of boyhood,
or preserved to smile over. Still, in these winter days,
when only Prime Ministers go to Rome (and then not to
bask) and Luxor is equidistant with the moon, you may
well find respite in a book so full of sunshine and memories
of happy places; but I am bound to repeat my warning that
your fellow-travellers will perhaps not be quite such stimu-
lating society as the publishers would have you expect. -
Sir THEoDoRE Cook has already done sound work in
dealing with German methods, and in The Mark of the
Beast (MURRAY) he pursues his labours a step further. So
careful is he to give incontestable proofs for the charges he
brings against the Huns that even the most anaemic
neutrals must find a difficulty in reading this volume without
recognising the truth. Especially he emphasizes the dan-
gers of peace-making with an enemy whose whole policy
and programme have been based on lies. And if he insists
many times and again upon this point he has his excuse
in the fact that some of us are so extraordinarily forgetful
and forgiving that we cannot be reminded too often of what
the future has in store for us if we do not now remember
the past. With such an absolutely flawless, case in his
hands I find myself wishing sometimes that Sir THEODoRE
had been less prodigal of the denunciatory language which
he hurls at Teutonic heads. Not for a moment would I
suggest that the Hun does not deserve vituperation, but I
am inclined to think that a less violent manner of attack
is more effective. In his own way, however, Sir THEODORE
is inimitable, and I can pay no higher praise to his book
than to say that I know of no War-literature so admirably
calculated to make BETHMANN-Hollweg (“more double
than his name”) really sorry for himself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The War has not been lacking in fine memorials of the
dead. To what extent the Germans have commemorated
the fallen I have no notion; but in France and Italy
the papers constantly print tender and eloquent tributes,
usually to the young. And in England we have the same
thing too, touchingly, proudly and generously done. For the
most part such tributes are mere records, but now and then
they reconstruct; and the most remarkable example of such
reconstruction—to the world at large, absolute creation—
is the memoir of Charles Lister (UNWIN), which his
father, Lord RIBBLEsdale, and some devoted friends have,
with perfect biographical tact, prepared. But for CHARLEs
LISTER’s untimely death, leading his men against the Turks
in July, 1915, most of the letters in this book would never
have łº printed at all: for whatever his career might
have become—and he was a man apart and bound for
distinction—and however great a record were his, the
motto for the whole book. It will have, I think, a warm
welcome from Sir HERBERT's many friends and admirers,
have been (in his own quaintly attractive phrase) “pro-
phetically plagiarised" by other writers. Certainly this
profits from the sale of the volume are to go to support a
cause that, to all who love the Stage, will be far indeed
from not mattering—the fund to supplement the incomes
of the wives and families of actors at the Front. You may
regard it therefore as the lightest of comedies played, like
so many others, in the cause of charity, and put down your
money with an approving conscience.

vicarious pride in the achievement of our brothers-in-arms

At first sight, perhaps, Nothing Matters (CAssELL) may
sound to you a somewhat, shall I say, transatlantic title for
a book published in these days, when we are all learning
how enormously everything matters. But this emotion
will only last till you have read Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM
THEE's disarming little preface. Personally, it left me
regretting only one thing in the volume (or, to be more
accurate, outside it), which was the design of its very un-
ornamental wrapper—a lapse, surely, from taste, for which
it would probably be quite unfair to blame the writer of
what lies within. This is almost all of it excellent fooling,
and includes a brace of longish short-stories (rather in the
fantastic style of brother MAx); some fugitive pieces that
you may recall as they flitted through the fields of
journalism; with, for stiffening, a reprint of the author's
admirable lecture upon “The Importance of Humour in
Tragedy.” This is a title that you may well take as a
and the Mort Homme are intelligibly reconstructed. Com-
ment in the form of personal anecdotes of individual heroism
is added. Perhaps the most illuminating touch is in the letter
of poor Feldwebel KARL GARTNER, which was to have been
despatched to his mother by a friend going on leave, so as
to escape the Censor's eye. It began in a mood of robusti-
ous confidence and ended (or rather was interrupted by
GARTNER's capture) on the most despairing note. And this
was seven months before the most brilliant counter-attack
in the history of the War slammed the door once for
all in the face of the enemy.

The Kaiser. I say, old man, you really must speak louder
and more plainly. I can't hear a word you say.
The King. The Allies have sent me an ULTIMATUM
Did you hear that time?
The Kaiser. Yes, most of it,
The King. Well.
The Kaiser. Well. - -
The King. What do you think about it? -
The Kaiser. Not very much. Lots of other people have
had ultimatums and haven't been one pfennig the worse
for them. -
Who's talking?
I want a word with the
Fire away.
I haven't too
The King. Oh, but this is the very last thing in ulti-
matums. It's a regular ultimatissimum.
The Kaiser. What do they want you to do?
The King. All sorts of disagreeable things. For instance,
I am to move my troops to the Peloponnese, so as to get
them out of harm's way.
The Kaiser. Well, move them.
except to be moved about? You can always move them
back again, you know. I keep on moving troops forward
and backward, all the time. It's a mere nothing when
you once get accustomed to it. Just you try it and see.
Anything more ?
The King. Yes; I'm to release from prison the followers
of the pestilential VENIzELos.
The Kaiser. That's unpleasant, of course, for a patent
Greek War-Lord; but I should do it if I were you, and
then you can let me know how it feels.
The King, Look here, William, I don't know what's the
matter with you, but I wish you wouldn't try to be so
funny. You seem to think the whole affair's a sort of
German joke.
at all.
The Kaiser. Manners, TINo, manners.
The King. I'm sick and tired of all this talk.
The Kaiser. If you go on like that I shall not talk to you
any more. -
The King. Don't say that; I could not bear such a loss.
But, seriously, are you going to help as you promised ?
The Kaiser. I cannot help you now. You must play
for time. -
The King. I've exhausted all the possibilities of playing
for time. It wouldn't be the least good. They really mean
it this time, and they've given me a strictly limited period
for compliance.
The Kaiser. Well, I suppose you know best, but I should
have thought you could have spun out negotiations for a
bit—given them a little promise here and a little promise
there on the chance of something turning up.
The King. The long and the short of it is that you
promised to help us, but it was only a little promise here
or there, and you don't mean to keep it. I shall accept the
ultimatum.
The Kaiser. The what? The telephone's buzzing again.
The King. The ULTIMATUM
The Kaiser. Oh, the ultimatum. Yes, by all means
accept it. And, by the way, I'm publishing a volume of
my War-speeches, and will make a point of sending you an
early copy. You might get it reviewed in the Athens.

U.K., and the roads, railways, quays
and gangways being policed with
stalwarts whom it is impossible to
circumvent and unwise to push into
the sea, the only remaining resource is
to apply to the Officer in Charge. I
am told, at first hand, that there is as
much variety in the reasons urged in
support of applications as there is in
the manner of the applicants. They
attempt to melt him with piteous tales
of their future in England, to shame
him with gruesome pictures of their
recent past in France, to hustle him
with emergencies or special duties, or
to bully him with dark references to
unseen powers. I had a list of them
from an M.L.O. himself, who was
highly suspicious even of me, until he
understood that I only wanted one
thing in the world, and that was some-
one interesting to talk to while I waited
for the leave boat to sail. Instance
after instance he gave me of the low
eunning of my species, to all of which,
as I ventured to guess, he had proved
himself equal. In the circumstances,
as he said, this might suggest some
hardness of heart on his part, but I
readily agreed, was even the first to
state, that there was no one in the
wide world more anxious to assist our
irrepressibles when bent on their hard-
earned holiday. But he just couldn't do
it. I put it for him that he was but
the powerless and insignificant agent
of an authority greater than himself.
To that he said “Yes, and No,”
always, I think, a safe answer. True,
he had his duty to perform, and right
well he performed it, we agreed. But
he had also his powers, his responsi-
bilities—might he say, his scope 2 Yet,
I gathered, there were things which, not
being entirely master of himself and
his affairs, he could not do. Take my
own case, for example. I suggested
(very cautiously) that it would require
a very much greater authority than
himself to give relief to an ordinary
person like myself, with no stronger
reason to travel by the civilian boat
than that my whole financial future
and domestic happiness depended upon
my doing so. He said nothing to
that ; I gave him but a very little
chance. I said that I knew quite well

A WAR-TIME DRAMA.
Act I.
Many Gray's flat in the West
End, August, 1914.
There is a door R., leading into the hall.
There is also a door L., but it only
leads into a cupboard that Mary really
needs.
Marmaduke Beltravers, a well-dressed
man of thirty-fire, is standing by a
small table pressing his suit (his
matrimonial suit, of course), but with-
out success. His bold black eyes are
flashing. Mary's lovely face (by an
ingenious manipulation of the lime-
light) is quivering.
Marmaduke Beltravers (hoarsely). I
have laid at your feet my hand, my
heart and my flourishing business, and
thus—thus I am supplanted by that

G. J. How so?
M. B. Your conscience calls you, does
it not, to enlist? (George nods.) I have
no conscience. While you fight I shall
continue to press my suit.
G. J. (despairingly to himself). Alas!

thought strikes him) But stay—war

SEASONABLE NOVELTIES.
THE enterprise of the London and
North-Western Railway officials, in
designing a button to obviate delays
at the gate caused by the new show-

spurred other lines to a similar in-
genuity. Below are some of the latest
novelties in ticket-substitutes.

President Wilson appears “they deploy so
that he cannot fail to see their banners. The
President smiles broadly and passes on.”]

She gets no meat,
She never has anything
Nice to eat;
A supper fit
For a dog alone
Is all the fare
Of poor Mary Lebone.
She squats by the corner
Of Baker Street
And snuffs the air
So spicy and sweet
When the Bakers are baking
Their puddings and pies,
Their buns and their biscuits
And Banburies—
A tart for Jocelyn
A cake for Joan,
And nothing at all
For poor Mary Lebone!

him. His free-and-easy way shows

ear than I have—or a less rigid regard
for the truth.
You will have guessed that Edward
is under military age. To be exact,
it is thirteen months since he first
saw the light in this troubled world.
Not that the world is a troubled one to
Edward; on the contrary.
Edward takes his daily walks in his
perambulator upon the sea-front of
his native town. His free-and-easy
way has secured him a large circle of
acquaintance there. Elderly gentle-
men stop and speak to him, which he
likes, so long as they do not pat his
cheek, a habit far too prevalent among
elderly gentlemen. Mothers of other

in their hearts they are probably com-
paring him unfavourably with their
own offspring. Altogether Edward has
a cheery life.
Upon a certain day Edward fell in
with a very little man—so little, indeed,
that most people would have called
him a dwarf. He was walking in the
same direction as Edward, and over-
taking him, and Edward waved his
hand and smiled and waved again.
For a while the little man ignored
these overtures. But at length he felt
obliged to return them, and remarked
to Kate, who propels the perambulator,
“Seems friendly like;" to which Kate
replied, “Oh, he always waves to
everyone.” -
Now the majority of people would
have been rather repelled by that re-
mark. For myself I may say that,
though Edward always smiles when
we meet, I do not greatly value it
because I know he smiles in the same
way upon everyone else.
But it was not so with the little
man. To be classed with “everyone,”
to be placed by Edward on an equality
with the strong and graceful, sent a
warm glow to his heart.
So Edward, in his free-and-easy
fashion, had, like the boy-scouts, done
one good deed that day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HARDSHIPS OF BILLETS.
As Jim and me lies in hospital
gettin' better from our wounds we
talks over what we've been through in
this War.
There was the time when we was
billeted with Mrs. Dawkins, just before
we went to the Front, which dwells in
our memories. When the billetin'
orficer introduced us into her kitchen
Mrs. Dawkins went down on the bricks
and prayed she might do her duty by
the two noble defenders of her country
—she meant me and Jim—who the
Lord had pleased to deliver into her
care. Then she begun unlacin' Jim's
boots. In a minute Mr. Dawkins come
in ; he said we was hearty welcome, and
was just goin' to shake 'ands with us
when Mrs. Dawkins turned on 'im and
asked 'im what he meant by standin'
there like a gawk and not unlacin'
mine. Jim and me was very uncom-
fortable. -
Then some little Dawkinses come in,
Susan, Sammy, Billy and Elfreda, and
was told by Mrs. Dawkins to pay their
respecks to us, and do it proper or
she'd know the reason why. Sammy
saluted left-'anded and she cuffed him
unmerciful. Jim and me begun to feel
regler low-spirited.
After that she set out the tea. It
was as butiful a tea as we could wish
for, cakes and jam, and bloater-paste
and sardines, and bein’ hungry after a
long march we cheered up and looked
forward to enjoyin' it. As was correck
Jim 'anded all the dishes to Mrs.
Dawkins first, but she said, “No, thank
you, such things are for the defenders
of the country, and it is our duty to
provide them, but bread-and-dripping
is good enough for me and Mr. Dawkins
and the children.”
Susan, Sammy, Billy and Elfreda
all begun to cry, and their father sat
lookin' at 'em, the picture of misery.
It clean took away our appetites. She
piled our plates with jam and sardines,
but we couldn't swaller a mouthful
with them poor kids sobbin' all round
the table. We was thankful they
was put to bed before supper. Mrs.
Dawkins fried potaters and sausages
and set 'em down in front of me and
Jim, with a jug of porter, and she
and Dawkins and a young man lodger
sat at the other end, behind half a
Dutch cheese and some water. All the
meals was the same.
There was only three rooms upstairs,
and Jim and me couldn't make out how
it was we had a bedroom apiece till we
come across the lodger sleepin' on the
kitchen table, Dawkins on the mangle
and Sammy in one of the dresser
drawers. Then we asked to be allowed
to sleep together, with the lodger to one
side; but Mrs. Dawkins said, “I thank
the Lord we're blessed with two good
beds in our house, and as long as I have
two defenders of the country in my
care I should like to catch anyone
belonging to me getting into either of
their beds. If we're all getting wore
out for want of sleep we can't help our-
selves, we're doing our duty.”
Then she asked Jim if he was warm
enough nights, and before he'd time to
think he'd blurted out he wasn't quite.
That evening she come down shiverin'
to supper in her petticut, and said
what did it. matter her catchin' her
death of cold if them she had in her
care slept warm and comfortable under
her meriner skirt. We felt downright
brutes.
But what hurt us most was the way
them kids took against us. Me and
Jim is fond of kids, and we wanted to
make friends and play with 'em, but it
weren't no good. They was always
puttin' their tongues out at us when
Mrs. Dawkins' back was turned and
talkin' loud to one another: “I say,
Sammy, I 'ates soldiers, don't you ?
Soldiers is greedy; poor little children
don't have nothink where soldiers is.
Daddy 'ates soldiers too. He says his
'ome is a 'ell since the soldiers come.
'Ere they are walkin' down the street.
Quick, Billy' Mother ain't lookin';
turn yer nose up at 'em same as me.”
To make up for her kindness to us
Jim and me tried to do little odd jobs
about the house for Mrs. Dawkins, but
somehow it all turned to wormwood.
We slipped out early one Sunday morn-
in’ and begun siftin' the cinders in the
backyard, but she caught sight of us
and 'ollered so at Dawkins she woke up
all the neighbours: “How can you lay
there snorin', you great lazy good-for-
nothing, and look on while the defenders
of your country is wearin' themselves
out siftin' your cinders?”
Dawkins tumbled off the mangle,
thinkin' it was a fire, and he swore
terrible at me and Jim. - }
The young man lodger took against
us too. When his washin' was on the
line we couldn't help noticin' he was
very bad off for underclothes, and Jim
and me, havin' more shirts and socks
that kind ladies had give us than we
knowed how to wear, we took the
liberty of wrappin' three of each in
paper with a label, “Hopin' no offence,”
and puttin' it in the chicken-'ouse
where he was in the habit of doin' his
hair. We was pleased to notice next
day he had got one of the shirts on.
Of course we made no remark; no
more did he. But at supper-time
Mrs. Dawkins caught sight of his
cuffs. She took the poor feller by the
collar and we was afraid she would
have shook the life out of him.
“You thievin' rascal!” she said.
“To think I should 'arbour in my
house a man as ain't ashamed to rob
the defenders of his country of the
shirts off their backs!" Then she
begun callin' for the police. t
Jim and me tried to explain, but it,
weren't no use. The first chance he
had the young man lodger got out
through the door. He come back in
half a minute with his feet bare and
his weskit all anyhow. The shirts
and socks was under his arm. :
“Damn you and yer clothes!” he
said, and flung 'em at me and Jim.
It were very disheartenin'. t
When it come to leavin' we felt we
ought to show our gratitude for the
treatment we had received by makin'
Mrs. Dawkins a little present. Bein’
of an uncommon disposition it were
difficult to choose what would please
her. I were in favour of a pink shawl;
but Jim didn't seem to fancy givin'
anybody any more clothes. In the end
we chose a pair of earrings.
Directly we give 'em to her we saw
we'd done wrong. She turned on
Dawkins like a hyener. “'Ave I done
my duty and starved us all to death,
and given them two the best in the
house and slept cold every night to be
paid in gewgaws?” she said. “Didn't,
I do it willin', and wouldn't I do it
agen 2 and are you a man or a cur that,
you stand there expectin' me to put
them things into my ears instead of
behind the fire?” In another minute
the earrings was melted. It were some
consolation to me and Jim that she
didn't refuse to shake 'ands with us
when we come away; but Dawkins did,
and so did the young man lodger, and
all the little Dawkinses spit at us. We
never have been able to make out who
were to blame. We thinks sometimes
it were Mrs. Dawkins.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Do you remember a clever, gloomy story that Mr.
HUGH WALPole wrote, some years ago, about a pack of
schoolmasters who got so monstrously upon one another's
nerves that the result was attempted murder? I have
just been reading a new story that may be regarded as the
female counterpart of the same tragedy. Regiment of Women
(HEINEMANN) is described as a first novel; and there are
indeed signs of this in a certain verbosity and diffuseness
of attack. But it is at least equally clear that the writer,
CLEMENCE DANE, has the root of the matter in her. As in
the book with which I have compared it, the setting of this
is scholastic—a girls' school here, with all its restricted out-
look, its small intrigues, and exaggerated friendships, merci-
lessly exposed. You will be willing to admit that it is at least
aptly named when I tell you that not till page 135 does
so much as the shadow of a man appear, and then but
fleetingly as the father of the poor child, Louise, the tragedy
of whose death is the central incident of the book. Naturally
it can be nothing else than a painful story; in particular the
figure of Clare, the adored teacher, whose cruel egoistical
friendship, with its alternations of encouragement and
brutality, first drives Louise to suicide, and all but wrecks
the life of the young assistant-mistress, Alwynne, has in it
something coldly sinister that haunts the memory. But
of its power there can be no question. On one small point
of psychology I am at issue with the writer. I doubt
whether the child Louise could have played Arthur in the
school theatricals so marvellously as we are asked to
|believe without cheering herself, by such an artistic
success, out of the temptation to suicide. But the ways
of morbidity are unsearchable, and this is no more than
an expression of individual opinion. It is not meant to
qualify my admiration for the skill of this remarkable and
arresting story.
If the long postponement of the appearance of another
novel—Wesprie Towers (SMITH, ELDER)—by the late Mr.
THEoDoRE WATTs-DUNTON, means (I am careful not to say
it does) that the author never intended it to see the light of
day, honesty obliges one to admit that there may have
been wisdom in that decision, for the story of Violet Vespric,
though touched with a certain charm and distinction, sadly
lacks the imaginative intensity of Aylwin. The plot is
commonplace, being the familiar record of how the country
seat of a once illustrious family nearly, but of course not
quite, passed into the hands of strangers when the last
of the race came to poverty. Even the inevitable flight
to London is not spared us or the heroine, and it is
really only when the writer tires of his attempted con-
ventionality that he comes more nearly to his own. The
return of Violet to her old home, for instance, is most
fortunate in its failure to follow the rules, that attractive
young lady being quite content to be whisked back in the
turning of a page from destitution in Lambeth to the place
she loves, without knowing or caring at all how the miracle
has been wrought; while we, reader and author alike, equally
in the dark, are too happy to have her home to worry about
it either, preferring to wander with her through the dear
old rooms and let explanations go hang. Anyhow, perhaps

one can forgive a certain amount of looseness in a story
that holds such pleasant things as a family rainbow, an
“osier ait” and a sailor-poet worshipping from afar. And
indeed, though far from brilliant, the book is really rather
lovable.
In The Leatherwood God (JENKINs) Mr. W. D. Howells
has written a powerful and very interesting study of an
unusual theme. Religious mania, and those queer mani-
festations of it that hover uncertainly between fraud and
hysteria, have always provided a subject of attraction for
the curious. Mr. Howells sets his romance in the early
days of the last century, at the backwoods settlement of
Leatherwood, where the community of the faithful are
perturbed by the arrival amongst them of a stranger, one
Dylks, who claims divine origin and the power to work
miracles. Actually, this Dylks was about as bad a hat as
any made. He had deserted his legal wife, Nancy, and
allowed her, in supposed widowhood, to marry a de facto
husband whom she adored. So you will see that the turn-
ing up again of Number One, unrecognised and surrounded
by the trappings of god- [T Tº
head and the adoration
of the Elect, creates for Ll l–l
Nancy a very pretty and
absorbing problem in
social ethics. But Mr.
Howells has done more
than this. Having shown
Dylks as the arch-villain
and impostor that he is,
he proceeds to the sub-
tler task of enlisting our
sympathy for him. It is
this that gives the story
its higher quality. The
horror of the poor
wretch's position, driven
on by his own words,
almost, in time, coming
himself to a kind of belief
in them, haunted always
by the increasing de-
mands of his dupes, is - - -
most powerfully portrayed. So much so that in the end
we hear of his death (by suicide or āccident) with an
emotion of relief and pity that is a real tribute to his
creator. The Leatherwood God is not a long story, but for
concentrated power it deserves to be classed amongst the
outstanding work of the season. -

I should call Mrs. Victor Rick ARD a bold plotter—of
course in a strictly literary sense. It must at this moment
have required some courage to make your hero an agent
of the British Secret Service. And having done this she
certainly shirks none of the unpleasant possibilities of the
situation so created. In the interest of his profession,
and for no reward save the service of his country, Marcus
Janover is called upon to sacrifice love, friendship, even his
personal honour. Just how all this comes about I leave
you to discover by The Light above the Cross Roads
(Duckworth). It is a powerful and highly original story
that has the distinction of breaking entirely new ground in
war-novels. The scenes of it, laid partly in Ireland, partly
in Berlin, or behind the German lines, are themselves
guarantees of the unusual. One slight criticism that I
have to make rises from the question whether so expert an
“agent" as Marcus would really employ blot-producing ink
for his map tracery when, on his own confession, he might

have used pencil.
Prussians (oddly obtuse as to the real meaning of Marcus's
presence amongst them) would never have arrested Ursule,
and thus provided a dramatic and unhackneyed situation.
There is a gravity and distinction, moreover, about the tale
that somehow reminds me of the late Monsignor BENsoN.
It is undoubtedly a story that should be read.
I am rather puzzled what to say about the The Grey
Shepherd (Hodder AND STOUGHTON), because it is essen-
tially a story that will appeal very differently to readers of
different temperaments. Some people will say, “How
beautiful!” Others perhaps, “How precious !” and both
with a certain truth. For my own part, I should select a
middle course, and say that Mrs. J. E. BUCKRose has had a
wholly admirable idea for a short story, which she has done
her best to spoil by enlarging it to book dimensions, and
a little over-sweetening it. There is real delicacy and beauty
in her theme. The youth forced by partial blindness to give
up all the hopes for which he had been educated, who
becomes a shepherd, solacing himself with his pipe (musical)
- -- T and the simplicities of
country lore for the loss
of love and ambition;
and eventually, after his
death, is deified by rustic
tradition into a super-
natural helper of “all
things that are kind"—
here is an idea for the
tenderest handling. My
feeling is, while giving
|Mrs. BUCKRose every
|credit for, such an in:
spiration, that she should
have been a little sterner
with herself over the
treatment, and thus
avoided a certain sticki-
ness that may irritate
those who prefer the
simplicity of nature to
a not quite sufficiently
-- - - - concealed art. But, as I
began by saying, it all depends on the individual palate;
and, anyhow, the book has the historic excuse of being a
very little one, which you can read, with pleasure or
irritation, within the hour.

in which the hero and heroine dally over-long in falling in

not a minute; and as soon as Ambrose Deane and Colina
Gaviller have met and discovered at sight that they are
just made for each other the really exciting part of the
story begins. I forget how many times Ambrose is arrested
during the course of the tale, but I do know that things
keep on happening all the time, and that the rescue of the
hero by the Indian girl Nesis is delightfully told. Alto-
gether Mr. HULBERT FootNER's picture of the life of a
trader in Athabasca is particularly attractive. I like it all,
including the cover.

86 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 7, 1917.
THE MUD-LARKs.
OUR mess was situated on the crest
of a ridge, and enjoyed an uninterrupted
view of rolling leagues of mud; it had
the appearance of a packing-case float-
ing on an ocean of ooze.
We and our servants, and our rats
and our cockroaches, and our other
bosom-companions slept intents pitched
round and about the mess.
The whole camp was connected with
the outer world by a pathway of am-
munition boxes, laid stepping-stone-
wise; we went to and fro, lepping from
box to box as leps the chamois from
Alp to Alp. Should you miss your lep
there would be a swirl of mud, a gulp-
ing noise, and that was the end of you;
your sorrowing comrades shed a little
chloride of lime over the spot where
you were last seen, posted you as
“Believed missing” and indented for
another Second-Lieutenant (or Field-
Marshal, as the case might be).
Our mess was constructed of loosely
piled shell boxes, and roofed by a tin
lid. We stole the ingredients box
by box, and erected the house with
our own fair hands, so we loved it
with parental love; but it had its little
drawbacks. Whenever the field guns
in our neighbourhood did any business,
the tin lid rattled madly and the shell
boxes jostled each other all over the
place. It was quite possible to leave
our mess at peep o' day severely Gothic
in design, and to return at dewy eve to
find it rakishly Rococo. -
William, our Transport Officer and
Mess President, was everlastinglypiping
all hands on deck at unseemly hours
to save the home and push it back
into shape; we were householders in
the fullest sense of the term.
Before the War, William assures us,
he was a bright young thing, full of
merry quips and jolly practical jokes,
the life and soul of any party, but what
with the contortions of the mess and
the vagaries of the transport mules he
had become a saddened man.
Between them—the mules and the
mess—he never got a whole night in
bed; either the mules were having bad
dreams, sleep-walking into strange lines
and getting themselves abhorred, or the
field guns were on the job and the mess
had the jumps. If Hans, the Hun, had
not been the perfect little gentleman
he is, and had dropped a shell any-
where near us (instead of assiduously
spraying a distant ridge where nobody
ever was, is, or will be) our mess would
have been with Tyre and Sidon; but
Hans never forgot himself for a mo-
ment; it was our own side we dis-
trusted. The Heavies, for instance.
The Heavies warped themselves labori-
ously into position behind our hill,
disguised themselves as gooseberry
bushes, and gave an impression of the
crack of doom at 2 A.M. one snowy
morning.
Our mess immediately broke out into
St. Vitus's dance, and William piped all
hands on deck. -
The Skipper, picturesquely clad- in
boots (gum, high) and a goat's skin,
flung himself on the east wing, and
became an animated buttress. Albert
Edward climbed aloft and sat on the
tin lid, which was opening and shutting
at every pore. Mactavish put his
shoulder to the south wall to keep it
from working round to the north. I
clung to the pantry, which was coming
adrift from its parent stem, while
William ran about everywhere, giving
advice and falling over things. The
mess passed rapidly through every
style of architecture, from a Chinese
pagoda to a Swiss châlet, and was on
the point of confusing itself with a
Spanish castle when the Heavies
switched off their hate and went to
bed. And not a second too soon.
Another moment and I should have
dropped the pantry, Albert Edward
would have been sea-sick, and the
Skipper would have let the east wing
go west. -
We pushed the mess back into shape,
and went inside it for a peg of some-
thing and a consultation. Next evening
William called on the Heavies' com-
mander and decoyed him up to dine.
We regaled him with wassail and
gramophone and explained the situa-
tion to him. The Lord of the Heavies,
a charming fellow, nearly burst into
tears when he heard of the ill he had
unwittingly done us, and was led home
by William at 1.30 A.M., swearing to
withdraw his infernal machines, or
beat them into ploughshares, the very
next day. The very next night our
mess, without any sort of preliminary
warning, lost its balance, sat down
with a crash, and lay littered about a
quarter of an acre of ground. We all
turned out and miserably surveyed
the ruins. What had done it 2 We
couldn't guess. The field guns had
gone to bye-bye, the Heavies had gone
elsewhere. Hans, the Hun, couldn't
have made a mistake and shelled us?
Never ! It was a mystery; so we all
lifted up our voices and wailed for
William. He was Mess President; it
was his fault, of course.
At that moment William hove out of
the night, driving his tent before him
by bashing it with a mallet.
According to William there was one,
“Sunny Jim,” a morbid transport mule,
inside the tent, providing the motive
power. “Sunny Jim" had always been
something of a somnambulist, and this
time he had sleep-walked clean through
our mess and on into William's tent,
where the mallet woke him up. He
was then making the best of his way
home to lines again, expedited by
William and the mallet.
So now we are messless; now we
crouch shivering in tents and talk
lovingly of the good old times beneath
our good old tin roof tree, of the won-
derful view of the mud we used to get
from our window, and of the homely
tune our shell-boxes used to perform as
they jostled together of a stormy night.
And sometimes, as we crouch shiver-
ing in .our tents, we hear a strange
sound stealing up-hill from the lines.
It is the mules laughing.

LETTERS FROM MACEDONIA.
IV.
MY DEAR JERRY,--I am writing this
from my position on top of a small hill,
while my devoted band of followers sits
round me and waits for me to speak. I
always sit here, because if I wanted
to go somewhere else I should have
to climb down this hill and then up
another one. I hate hills. So does the
devoted band.
Behind another little hill a hundred
yards away we believe there lurks an
army corps of Bulgars, but we are
afraid to look and see. Instead, we fix
and unfix bayonets every ten minutes
and make martial noises. This, we
hope, affects the enemy's moral, and
having your moral affected every ten
minutes is no joke, I can tell you.
The spirit of our troops remains excel-
lent. You can see that this is true from
the fact that my joke still works. Every
night for the last three months, while
administering quinine to my army, I
have exhorted them not to be greedy
and not to take too much. They still
laugh heartily, nay uproariously. We
are a wonderful nation.
Our chief source of combined instruc-
tion and amusement is still the ant-
! soon as he recovered he would try
heap beside us, and in this connection,
Jeremiah, I must introduce to you
Herbert, a young officer in the ant
A.S.C.
When we first knew Herbert (or
“’Erb '' as he was known in those
days), he was an impudent and pushful
private. When his corps were engaged
in removing the larger pieces of straw
out of their hole in the hill, many a
time I have seen him staggering man-
fully towards the entrance with an enor-
mous piece on his slender shoulders,
against the tide of his comrades; for
he never could resist the temptation to
replace the really big stalks in the hole.
As he knocked against one and another
the older ants would step aside, lay
down their loads, and expostulate with
him, always ending by giving him a
good clip on the ear; but 'Erb was
never dismayed.
Now and again, during a temporary
slackness in the stream, he would dis-
appear triumphantly into the hole, his
log trailing behind him; but his triumph
was always short-lived. I would seem
to hear a scuffle and two bumps, and
'Erb would shoot gracefully upwards,
followed by his burden, and fall in a
heap beside the door. However, as
again. On one sultry afternoon I
noticed he succeeded in effecting an
entrance after twenty-three successive
chuck-outs.
His persistence piqued my curiosity.
I wondered why he should so obstin-
ately try to do a thing which was
obviously distasteful to all his seniors.
And then, yesterday, there was a
change.
'Erb was resting after his eighth
chuck-out under a plank when a vener-
able ant, heavy with the accumulated
wisdom and weakness of years, ap-
proached the exit from within and tried
to get out, but in vain. He swore and
struggled in a futile sort of way, while
his attendant subordinates stood about
helplessly. 'Erb saw his opportunity.
He seized his plank, dashed forward—
you may not believe me, Jerry, but it
is the gospel truth—saluted smartly,
and laid down his plank as a sort of
ladder. Supporting himself upon it the
veteran crawled out. Then he spoke
to 'Erb, and I think I saw him asking
someone the lad's name.
That is why Second Lieutenant
Herbert is to-day in charge of a work-
ing party. He is now engaged in clip-
ping the ear of a larger ant. I imagine
there must have been some lack of

“When I was a young feller I made
a voyage or two in an old hooker
called the Pearl of Asia. Her old man
at that time was old Captain Gillson,
him that had the gold tooth an' the
swell ma'ogany fist in place o' the one
that got blowed off by a rocket in
Falmouth Roads. Well, I was walkin'
out with a young woman at Liverpool
—nice young thing—an' she give me a
ring to keep to remember 'er by, the
day before we sailed. Nice thing it
was ; it had ‘Mizpah' wrote on it.
“We 'ad two or three fellers in the
crowd for’ard that voyage as would
'andle anything as wasn't too 'ot or
too 'eavy , which explains why I got
into a 'abit of slippin' my bits o'
vallybles, such as joolery, into a bit of a

a undred-and-sixty days from Portland,
Oregon, to London River, an' what
with thinkin' of the thumpin' lump o'
pay I'd have to draw an' one thing
an' another, I clean forgot all about
the ring I'd left cached in the little
place back o' my bunk yonder.
“Well, I drew my pay all right, and
after a bit I tramped it to Liverpool, to
look out for another ship. An' the first
person I met in Liverpool was the
young woman I 'ad the ring of.
“‘Where 's my ring 2' she says,
before I'd time to look round.
“Now, I never was one as liked

load grain; and I made sure of droppin'
acrost the Pearl there, for she was
bound the same way. But I never did.
She was dismasted in the South Pacific
on the outward passage, and had to put
in to one of them Chile ports for repairs.
So she never got to Frisco until after
we sailed for 'ome. An' that was the
way it went on. She kep' dodgin' me
all over the seven seas, an' the nearest
I got to 'er was when we give 'er a
cheer off Sydney Heads, outward bound,
when we was just pickin' up our pilot.
The last I 'eard of 'er after that was
from a feller that 'ad seen 'er knockin'
round the South Pacific, sailin’ out o'
Carrizal or Antofagasta or one o' them
places. I was in the Western Ocean
mail-boat service at the time, and so o'
course she was off my run altogether.
“I was still in the same mail-boat
when she give up the passenger busi-
ness an' went on the North Sea patrol.
“Well, one day we boarded a Chile
barque in the ordinary course o' duty,
and I was one o' those as went
on board with the lootenant. They
generally takes me on them jobs, the
reason bein’ that I know a deal o'
foreign languages. I don't believe
there's a country in the world where
I couldn't make myself understood,
partic'lar when I'm wantin' a drink
bad.
“I wasn't takin' that much notice of
this 'ere ship at the time (there was a
bit of a nasty jobble on the water, for
one thing, and we 'ad our work cut out
gettin' alongside), except that 'er name
was the Maria de Somethink-or-other
—some Dago name. But while we was
waitin' for the lootenant to finish 'is
business with Old Monkey Brand,
which was the black-faced Chileno
captain she 'ad, it come over me all of
a suddent.
“‘Strike me pink!' I says, “may my
name be Dennis if I 'aven't seen that
there bit o' fancy-work on the poop
ladder rails before;’ which so I 'ad, for
I done it myself in the doldrums, an'
a nice bit o' work it was, too.
“You'll 'ave guessed by now that
she was none other than the Pearl of
Asia; an' no wonder I 'adn't recker-
nised 'er, what with the mess she was
in alow and aloft, an’ allyminian paint ||
all over the poop railin's as would 'ave
made our old blue-nose mate die o' rage.
“‘You carry on 'ere,' I says to the
feller that was with me; "I'm goin'
for’ard a minute.’
“’Arf a minute, an' I was in my old
bunk; an' there was the cache all right,
just like I left it.’
He paused dramatically; I supposed
it was for histrionic effect, but it lasted
so long that I said, “And so I suppose
you sent the ring to the girl after all?”
“Oh ! 'er 1’’ he said, with an air of
surprise, “I’ve forgot 'er name and
all about 'er, only that she'ad a brother
in one o' them monkey-boats of ELDER
DEMPsTER's—'e 'ad the biggest thirst
I ever struck.”
“But the ring?” I said. “I suppose
it was there all right?”
He stopped his pipe down with his
thumb, with an enigmatical expression.
“That's where the bloomin' coinci-
dence come in,” he said; “it weren't.”

TAXIS AND TALK.
CoNVERSATION in the streets of
London has never been easy; not, at
any rate, until the small hours, when
the best of it is done. But it becomes
even more complex when one of the
talkers is pressed for time and wants
a taxi, and disengaged taxis are as rare
as new jokes in a revue.
Let the following dialogue prove it.
I leave open the question whether
or not I have reported the real terms
of our conversation, merely reminding
you that two men together, removed
from the frivolity of women, tend, even
in the street and when the thermometer
is below freezing - point, to a high
seriousness rare when the sexes are
mingled.

won't any longer be funny on the stage;
and, since to laugh in theatres has be-
come a national duty, that, in the present
state of the wit market, would be priva-

AT THE PLAY.
“ANTHoNY IN WonderLAND.”
IT was not till about the middle of
the play, and after a narcotic had been
administered to him, that Anthony got
there; but we were in Wonderland
almost from the start, without the aid
of drugs. For we were asked to be-
lieve that Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY was
a visionary, amorous of an ideal which
no earthly woman could realise for him.
Occasionally he had caught a glimpse
of it in the creations of Art—at the
Tate Gallery or Madame TUssaud's
or the cinema; but in Bond Street
nevel". " -
And the pity of it was that
he had come in for a fortune
of seven hundred thousand
pounds odd, which would pass
elsewhere unless he married
by a given date. It was there.
fore the clear duty of his rela-
tives—a couple of sisters and
their husbands—to find a wife
for him. After vainly trying
him with every pretty woman
of their acquaintance they had
resort, in desperation, to the
black art of a certain Mr. Mor-
timer John (U.S.A.), an infalli-
ble inventor of stunts, who
made a rapid diagnosis of the
case and at once pronounced
himself confident of success.
Briefly—for it is a long and
elaborate story—his scheme
is to choose a charming girl,
and make a film drama round
her. Anthony, with family, is
taken to see the show and oc-
cupies the best box in the
Prince of Wales's Theatre, from
which, after a little critical
comment upon us in the audi-
ence, he falls in love with the heroine.
It is the typical film of lurid life on a
Californian ranch, and might almost
have been modelled on one of Mr.
Punch's cinema burlesques. There are
the familiar scenes of a plot to hang
the girl's lover, swiftly alternating with
scenes of her progress on horseback
through the primeval forest, and con-
cluding with her arrival just in time to
shoot the villain and untie the noose
that encircles her lover's carotid.
On the return of the party from the
cinema, Mortimer John describes to
Anthony the powers of a drug which
induces the most vivid of dreams. He,
John, had once been in Anthony's pitiful
case, and through the services of this
drug had achieved his quest of the ideal
woman. Anthony, greatly intrigued,
consents to swallow a sample of the
potion. It is a simple narcotic, and
under its influence he is conveyed, in a
Aloney

state of coma and a suitable change of
apparel, into the heart of Surrey,
where at sunrise, he is restored to
animation and has the scenes of the
evening's drama re-enacted before his
eyes, as originally filmed for exhibition.
Under the impression that this is merely
the vivid dream that he had been
promised, he himself takes part in the
living drama, playing the noble rôle of
an exceptionally white man. In the
course of it he exchanges pledges of
eternal love with Aloney the heroine.
Finally, in a spasm of heroic self-sacri-
fice, he takes poison with the alleged
purpose of saving the heroine's life.
We never quite gather how his suicide
- AN IDYLL OF MOVIE-LAND.
should serve this end, but then the
whole atmosphere is charged with that
obscurity, which is the very breath of
the film-drama. .
The poison is nothing worse than
another dose of the narcotic, and under
its spell he is spirited back to London,
where, on arrival, he is confronted with
the lady of his “dream,” and Mortimer
John secures a colossal fee. In addition,
for he has had the happy thought of
selecting his own daughter for the
heroine, he secures a plutocrat for his
son-in-law.
The worst of a play in which one is
conducted out of ordinary life into the
regions of improbability by processes
of which every step has to be just con-
ceivably possible, is that the conscien-
tious development of the scheme is apt
to be tedious. And, frankly, the first
scene or two, though lightened by ex-
pectation, were on the heavy side.
MR. CHARLEs HAwTREY.
Miss WINIFRED BARNEs.
But the film itself, when we got to it,
was excellent fooling, and the recon-
struction of the original drama at
Dorking-in-the-Wild-West was really
delightful. You can easily guess that
Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY, as a cinema
hero, very conscious of his heroism
(“it’s a way we have in Montague
Square"), but always comfortably
aware that in a dream, as he imagines
it to be, he can well afford to make the
handsomest of sacrifices, had a great
chance. And he took it.
As the heroine, who has to play a
rather thankless part in the mercenary
designs of her parent, Miss WINIFRED
BARNEs contrived, yery naïvely and
prettily, to preserve an air of
maiden reluctance under the
most discouraging conditions.
As Mortimer John Mr. SYDNEY
WALENTINE had admirable
scope for his sound and busi-
nesslike methods. Of Anthony's
relations, all very natural and
human, Miss LYDIA BILBROOKE
was an attractive figure, and
the part of Herbert Clatterby,
K.C., was played by Mr. ED-
MUND MAURICE with his ac-
customed ease of manner.
If I wanted to find fault with
any detail of the construction,
it would be in the matter of
the ring which Anthony places
on the finger of Aloney in the
cinema play. This was a spon-
taneous act not included in the
scheme for which Mortimer
John was given the credit.
Yet as the means by which
Anthony identified her on his
return to consciousness it went
far to bring that scheme to
fruition. I think also that he
ought to have shown some
trace of surprise (I should myself) on
finding that he had unconsciously ex-
changed his spotless evening clothes
for the kit of a broncho-buster.
I have hinted already at the com-
parative dulness of the long introduc-
tion to what is the clow of the play—
the film and its reconstructed scenes.
Why not take a further wrinkle from
the cinematic drama and throw upon
the screen a succinct résumé of the pre-
vious argument? Three or four minutes
of steady application to the text, and
we might plunge into the very heart of
things. I throw out this suggestion
not with any hope of reward, but in
part payment of my debt for some
very joyous laughter. O. S.

A SONG OF THE WOODLAND ELVES.
WE hear the ruthless axes; we watch our rafters fall;
The seawind blows unhindered where stood our banquet-
hall; -
Our grassy rings are trampled, our leafy tents are torn—
Yet more would we, and gladly, to help the English-born.
For, leafy-crowned or frosted, the English oaks are ours;
The beeches are our playrooms, the elms our outlook towers;
And we were forest-rangers before these woods had name,
And we were elves in England before the Romans came.
We watched the Druids worship; we watched the wild
bulls feed;
We gave our oaks to ALFRED to build his ships at need;
And often in the moonlight our pricked ears in the wood
Have heard the hail of RUFUs, the horn of Robin Hood.
But if our age-old roof-beams can serve her cause to-day,
The woodland elves of England will sign their rights away;
For none but will be woeful to hear the axes ring,
Yet none but would go homeless to aid an English King.

GOOD OLD GOTHIC.
[An agitation for the total disuse of the Latin character, we learn
from Press quotations published in The Daily Chronicle, is raging
through the German Empire, and the Prussian Minister of the
Interior has forbidden the use of any other character than German
Gothic in the publications of the Statistical Bureau.]
THE ways of the Hun comprehension elude,
They're so cleverly crass, so painstakingly crude;
For, in spite of his cunning and forethought immense,
He is often incurably stupid and dense
To the point of allowing his patriot zeal
To put a large spoke in his own driving-wheel.
An excellent instance of zeal of this sort
Is the movement, endorsed by official support,
To ban Latin type in the papers that flow
From the press of the Prussian Statistics Bureau.
Now the pride of the Germans, as dear as their pipe
And their beer, is their wonderful old Gothic type;
It makes ev'ry page look as black as your hat,
For the face of the letters is stodgy and fat;
It adds to the labour of reading, and tries
The student's pre-eminent asset, his eyes,
And in consequence lends a most lucrative aid
... To people engaged in the spectacle trade.
But these manifest drawbacks to little amount
When tried by the only criteria that count:
--Though the people who use it don't really need it,
It exasperates aliens whenever they read it.
It is solid, echt-Deutsch, free from Frenchified froth,
And in fine it is Gothic, befitting the Goth.
So when the great Prussian Statistics Bureau
Proscribes Latin letters and says they must go,
They are giving a lead which we earnestly hope
Will be followed beyond its original scope;
For the more German books that in Gothic are printed
The more will the spread of Hun “genius” be stinted,
And the larger the number, released from its gripe,
Of the students of Latin ideas—and type.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. S. P. B. MAIs, in a dedicatory letter to Interlude
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), tells us that he has “simply tried
to show what a man constituted like Shelley would have
made of his life had he been alive in 1917.”. Without
any doubt his attempt has succeeded. I am, however,
bound to add this warning (if Mr. MAIS's is not enough),
that a novel with such a purpose is not, and could not be,
milk for babes. Nothing that I had previously read of
Mr. MAIS's had prepared me for the proficiency he shows
here. Obviously attached to the modern school of novelists,
he has many of its faults and more of its virtues. One
may accept his main point of view, yet be offended some-
times by his details. But the fact remains that in Geoffrey
Battersby he has given us a piece of character-drawing
almost flawlessly perfect. Not for a very long time has it
been my good fortune to attend such a triumph, and I wish
to proclaim it. The women by whom Geoffrey, the weak
and the wayward, was attracted hither and thither are also
well drawn; but here Mr. MAIs shows his present limita-
tions. Nevertheless I feel sure that he has within him
the qualities that go to make a great novelist, and that if
he will free himself from certain marked prejudices his
future lies straight and clear before him.
It was a happy idea of the Sisters MARY and JANE FIND-
LATER to call their new book of short stories Seen and
Heard (SMITH, ELDER), with the sub-title, Before and After
1914. I say short stories, but actually these have so far
outgrown the term that a half-dozen of them make up the
volume. They are all examples of the same gentle and
painstaking craſt that their writers have before now
exhibited elsewhere. Here are no sensational happen-
ings; the drama of the tales is wholly emotional. My
own favourites are the first, called “The Little Tinker,” a
half-ironical study of the temptation of a tramp mother
to surrender her child to the blessings of civilisation; and
how, by the intervention of a terrible old woman, the queen
of the tribe, this momentary weakness was overcome. My
other choice, the last tale in the collection (and the only
one contributed by Miss MARY FINDLATER), is a dour little
comedy of the regeneration, through poverty and hard
work, of two underemployed and unpleasant elderly ladies.
A restful book, such as will keep no one awake at nights,
but will give pleasure to all who appreciate slight studies
of ordinary life sketched with precise and careful finish.
Their Lives (STANLEY PAUL) has at least this point of
originality, that it ends with the wedding of somebody other
than the heroine, or rather, I should say, the chief heroine,
because, strictly speaking, all three daughters of Mr. and
Mrs. Radmall might be said jointly to fill this post, but
it is Christina, the eldest, who fills most of it. The other
two were named Virgilia and Orinthia, and I can't say
that these horrific labels did them any injustice. As for
the story of “their lives,” as WIoLET HUNT tells it, there is
really nothing very much to charm in a history of three
disagreeable children developing into detestable young
women. Perhaps it may have some value as a study of
feminine adolescence, but I defy anyone to call the result
attractive. Its chief incident, which is (not to mince
matters) the attempted seduction by Christina of a middle-

aged man, the father of one of her friends, mercifully comes
to nothing. I like to believe that this sort of thing is as
unusual as it is unpleasant. For the rest, the picture of
the “artistic” household in which the children grew up, of
their managing mother, and the slightly soured and dis-
appointed painter their father, is drawn vividly enough.
But what unamiable people they all are l “MILES IGNOTUs,”
who supplies a quaintly attractive little preface, in which
he speaks of having read the book in proof under shell-fire,
affects to discover in them a kinship with Prussia. Cer-
tainly they are almost frightful enough.
Having read all about The Rise of Ledgar Dunstan
(DUCKworTH), from obscurity to wealth, literary success
and aristocratic wedlock, I should be infinitely content to
leave him at that and have done; but Mr. ALFRED
TRESIDDER SHEPPARD warns us that there is more to
follow, and even hints that the sequel, opening in July,
1914, may in many respects be far indeed from the dul-
ness of happily-ever-after. If Ledgar had been satisfied
to marry the sweetheart of his
school-days there might have
been some danger of such a
disaster; but, having put his

enables him to touch in many haunting pictures—the
delusive peace of a sunny Autumn day among the Bosnian
mountains; the face of KING PETER seen for a moment
by lamplight amid a crowd of refugees; and countless
others. More than a passing mention also is due to the
many quite admirable snapshots with which the volume
is illustrated. The author seems successfully to have
communicated his own giſts of observation and selection
to his camera, an instrument only too apt to betray those
who look to it for support. One is glad for many reasons
to think that our American cousins will read this book.
The Man in the Fog (HEATH, CRANTON) is a book that
I find exceedingly hard to classify. Its author, Mr. HARRY
TIGHE, has several previous stories to his credit, all of
which seem to have moved the critics to pleasant sayings.
But for my own part I have frankly to confess that I found
The Man in the Fog somewhat wheezy company. The Man
of the title was a kind of Northern Joseph, dismissed from
a promising partnership with Potiphar after a domestic

original. The fog happens

step with foggy allusions to
the mysterious past. I may
mention that his own conduct
in the interval had been such
as I can only regard as a
lamentable relapse from the
altitude of the earlier chapters.
But it is all vastly serious—it
would perhaps be unkind to
2 say sententious—and wholly
unruffled by the faintest sug-
… gestion of comedy. For which
reason I should never be
startled to learn that HARRY

Scotch, or female (or indeed,
for that matter, all three).

out any excuse of necessity. The book contains a consider-
able element of lively if undiscriminating humour, but its
insistence on the gruesome is so unfortunate that unless his
hero's future fate be already irrevocably fixed in manuscript
one would like to remind the author that essays in this
kind are the easiest form of all literary effort and the least
supportable.
With Serbia into Exile (MELRose) is a book that will
suffer little from the fact that its tragic tale has already
been told by several other pens. Mr. Fortier Jones, the
writer, has much that is fresh to say, and a very fresh and
vigorous way of saying it. His book and himself are both
American of the best kind—which is to say, wonderfully
resourceful, observant, sympathetic and alive. From a
newspaper flung away by a stranger on the Broadway
Express, Mr. Jones first became aware that men were
wanted for relief work in Serbia, and “in an hour I had
become part of the expedition.” That is a phrase charac-
teristic of the whole book. Though the matter of it is
the story, “incredibly hideous and incredibly heroic,” of a
nation going into exile, Mr. Jones has always a keen eye
for the picturesque and even humorous aspects of the
tragedy; he has a quick sense of the effective which
In any case I can only hope that he, or she, will not resent
my parting advice to cultivate a somewhat lighter touch,
and the selection of such words as come easily from the
tongue. Some of the dialogue in the present book is
painfully unhuman.
A Great Problem Solved.
Some carry their season tickets in their hat-bands,
others fasten them on their wrists, others wear them
attached to cords. A correspondent writes:—
“In my own overcoat I find an ingenious arrangement excellently
suited for the purpose of carrying a season ticket, so that it shall be
at once secure and easily accessible. The tailor has made a horizontal
slit, about two-and-a-half inches wide, in the right side of the coat,
and cunningly inserted a small rectangular bag or pouch of linen, the
whole thing i. strongly stitched and neatly finished off with a
flap. It makes an admirable receptacle for a season ticket of
ordinary dimensions, and I recommend this contrivance to those
who may not be acquainted with it.”

WERE I a burglar in the dock
With every chance of doing time,
With Justice sitting like a rock
To hear a record black with crime;
If my conviction seemed a cert,
Yet, by a show of late repentance,
I thought I might, with luck, avert
A simply crushing sentence;—
I should adopt, by use of art,
A pensive air of new-born grace,
In hope to melt the Bench's heart
And mollify its awful face;
I should not go and run amok,
Nor in a fit of senseless fury
Punch the judicial nose or chuck
An inkpot at the jury.

To mitigate the heavy doom

For when the wild beast, held and bound,
Ceases to plunge and rave and snort,

(The KAISER and Count BERNstorFP.)
The Kaiser (concluding a tirade). And so, in spite of my
superhuman forbearance, this is what it has come to.
Germany is smacked in the face in view of the whole world
—yes, I repeat it, is smacked in the face, and by a nation
which is not a nation at all, but a sweeping together of the
worst elements in all the other nations, a country whose
navy is ludicrous and whose army does not exist; and you,
Count, have the audacity to come here into my presence
and tell me that, with the careful instructions given to you
by my Government and by myself, you were not able to
| prevent such an end to the negotiations? It is a thing
that cannot be calmly contemplated. Even I, who have
learnt perhaps more thoroughly than other men to govern
my temper—even I feel strangely moved, for I know how
deplorable will be the effect of this on our Allies and on the
other neutral Powers. Our enemies, too, will be exalted by
it and thus the War will be prolonged. No, Count, at such
a moment one does not appear before one's Emperor with
a smiling face. -
Count B. God knows, your Majesty, that it is not I who
have a smiling face. At such a moment there could be no
reason for it. But your Majesty will remember, in justice
to myself, that I have not ceased to warn your Majesty
from the very beginning that unless something actual and
definite was conceded to the feeling of the United States
trouble would surely come. First there was the treatment
of Belgium
The Kaiser. Bah! Don't talk to me of Belgium and the
Belgians. No more ungrateful race has ever infested the
earth. Besides, did I not say that my heart bled for
Louvain 2
Count B. The Americans, your Majesty, had the bad
taste not to believe you. It was in vain that I spread
those gracious words of yours broadcast throughout the
land. They only laughed at your Majesty.
The Kaiser. Yes, I know they did, curse them.
Count B. Then there came the deplorable sinking of the
Lusitania. - -
The Kaiser. Oh, don't speak to me of the Lusitania.
I'm sick to death of the very name. Besides, how do you
dare to call her sinking deplorable? I authorised it; that
ought to be enough for you and for everybody else.
Count B. I beg your Majesty's pardon. When I said
“deplorable " I was alluding not so much to the act itself
as to its effect on opinion in the United States. From that
moment the Americans stiffencil in their attitude towards
us and became definitely and strongly unfavourable. I
warned your Majesty of this over and over again, but your
Majesty preferred to disregard what I said.
The Kaiser. And have you any complaint to make? Is
your opinion of yourself so high that one may not without
sacrilege disregard your opinion ?
Count B. Your Majesty is pleased to jest. I am not
infallible, not being an Empercr, but I happen in this case
to have been right. And then on the top of all the other
things comes the Note announcing the new under-sea
policy, and the ridiculous offer to allow the Americans to
be safe in one ship a week, provided she is painted in a
certain way. No, really, with a proud nation—
The Kaiser. Proud A race of huckstering money-
grubbers. - -
Count B. With a proud nation—I must repeat it, your
Majesty—such a course must lead straight to war. But
perhaps that was what your advisers wanted, though I
cannot see why they should want it. But for myself I
must ask your Majesty to remember that I foretold what
has come to pass. There is perhaps yet time to undo
the mischief.
The Kaiser. No, it is too late.

puffs of misery bleached white the ſlush of early and latter times;
dinner-hours grew few and far between ; and with the Sun of Loaf
sank all wakefulness to light and culture.”
This last feature sounds a little like Berlin.

“How THIS EGG GOT PAST THE FOOD CONTROLLER I CAN'T IMAGINE.”
THE THREE DICTATORS.
(Being a tragedy of the moment and in-
cidentally a guide to the art of hand-
ing out correspondence to the typist.)
I.
THERE are, of course, as many styles
of dictating letters as there are of writ-
ing them; but three stand out. One
is the Indignant Confidential; one the
Hesitant Tactful; and one the No-
Nonsense Efficient. Bitter experience
in three orderly London houses only a
day or so ago chances to have led to
such complete examples of each of
these styles that the reader has the
felicity of acquiring at the same time a
valuable insight into business methods
and a glimpse of what Nature in the
person of Jack Frost can do with even
the best regulated of cities.
We will take first the Hesitant
Tactful, where the typist is not merely
considered as a human being but in-
vited to become an ally. The dictator
is Mr. Vernon Crombie.
“Oh, Miss Carruthers, there's a letter
I want to dictate and get off by hand
at once, because my house isn't fit to live
in through burst pipes. The plumbers
promised to send yesterday, but didn't,
and to-day they can't come, it seems,
and really it's most serious. Ceilings
being ruined, you know. The bore is
that there aren't any other plumbers
that I know of, and one is so at the
mercy of these people that we must go
very delicately. You understand. We
mustn't say a word to set their backs
up any higher than they already are.
Anger's no good in this case. Here
we must be tactful, and I want you to
help me. I knew you would.
Now we'll begin. To Messrs. Morrow
dº Hope. Dear Sirs, – I hate—no,
that's a little too strong, perhaps—I
much dislike—that's better—t much
dislike to bother you at a time when I
know you must be overworked in every
direction—you see the idea, don't you?
What we’ve got to do is to get on their
soft side. It's no use bullyragging
them; understanding their difficulties
is much better. You see that, don't
you? Of course; I knew you would.
Now then. Where was I? Oh yes—
overworked in every direction; but if,
as you promised yesterday, but unfortu-
nately were unable—I think that's good,
don't you? Much better than saying
that they had broken their promise
—to manage, you could spare a man to
attend to our pipes without further de-
lay—I think you might underline with-
I wonder? Yes, I think so—I should
be more than grateful. And now there's
ing is if it would be wise to offer to
pay an increased charge. I'd do any-
thing to get the pipes mended, but, on
the other hand, it's not a sound pre-
cedent. A state of society in which
everyone bid against everyone else
for the first services of the plumber
would be unbearable. Only the rich
would ever be plumbed, and very soon
the plumbers would be the million-
aires. Perhaps we had better let the
letter go as it is? You think so and I
think so. Very well then, just Believe
me, yours faithfully, and I'll sign it.”
And now the Indignant and Confiden-
tial. Mr. Horace Bristowe is dictative:
“Ah, here you are, Miss Tappit. Now
I've got trouble with the plumbers,
and I want to give the blighters—well,
I can't say it to you, but you know
what I mean. There's my house drip-
ping at every pore, or rather pouring
at every drip—I say, that 's rather
good; I must remember that to tell
them this evening. Just put that
down on a separate piece of paper,
will you. Well, here's the place all
soaked and not a man can I get. They

PETHERTON'S DONKEY;
or, PATRIOTIsMr AND PUBLICITY.
I HADN'T had a letter-writing bout
with Petherton for some time, and,
feeling in need of a little relaxation, I
seized the opportunity afforded by
Petherton's installing a very noisy
donkey in his paddock adjoining my
garden, and wrote to him as follows:–
DEAR MR. TETHERTON, I do not
like making complaints against a
neighbour, as you know, but the new
tenant of your field does not seem to
argue a good selection on your part,
unless his braying has a more soothing
effect on you than it has on me.
Yours sincerely,
HARRY J. For DYCE.
I was evidently in luck, as I drew
Petherton's literary fire at once.
SIR (he wrote), – I should have
thought that you would have been the
last person in the world to object to
this particular noise. Allow me to in-
form you that I purchased the donkey
for several family and personal reasons
which cannot possibly concern you.
I'aithfully yours, -
FREDERICK I’ETHERTON.
I translated this letter rather freely
for my own ends, and replied:—
DEAR PETHERTON, -I apologise. I
had no idea that the animal was in any
way connected with your family. If it
is a poor relation I must say you are
fortunate in being able to fob him (or
should it be her?) off so easily, as he
(or she) appears to live a life of com-
parative luxury, at little cost, I should
imagine, to yourself. I shall be glad to
know whether the animal, in exercis-
ing its extraordinary vocal powers, is
calling for his (or her) mate, or merely
showing off for the amusement of
your fascinating poultry who share its
pleasaunce. -
Can t you possibly fit the brute with
a silencer, as the noise it makes is dis-
turbing, especially to me, my study
window being very close to the hedge?
Yours sincerely,
HARRY Fon DYCE.
T.S.–I am thinking of laying down
a bed of poisoned carrots for early use.
I'erhaps with your chemical knowledge
you can suggest an effective top-dress-
ing for them.
Petherton rose to the bait and wrote
—the same night—as follows:–
SIR,-In your unfortunate corres-
pondence with me you have always
shown yourself better at rudeness than
repartee. Did you not learn at school
the weakness of the tu quoque line of
argument? You speak of your study
window being near my field. The
name “study” suggests literary efforts.
Is it in your case merely a room de-
voted to the penning of senseless and
impertinent letters to unoffending neigh-
bours, who have something better to
do than waste their time reading and
answering them 2 I hope this letter
will be the last one I shall find it neces-
sary to write to you.
Re your postscript. Try prussic acid,
but pray do not confine it to the toilets
of your carrots. A few drops on the
tongue would, I am sure, make you
take a less distorted view of things, and
you would cease to worry over such
trifles as the braying of a harmless
animal. Faithfully yours,
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
Of course I simply had to reply to
this, but made no reference to the tu
quoque question. He had evidently
failed to grasp, or had ignored, the
rather obvious suggestion in the last
few words of my first letter on the
subject. I wrote:—
MY DEAR CHAP,-Thanks so much
for your prompt reply and valuable
information about prussic acid. There
was, however, one omission in the pre-
scription. You didn't say on whose
tongue the acid should be placed. If
you meant on the donkey's it seems an
excellent idea. I'll try it, so excuse
more now, as the chemist's will be
closed in a few minutes.
Yours in haste, HARRY F.
Petherton was getting angry, and
his reply was terse and venomous:–
SIR,-Yes, I did mean the donkey's.
It will cure both his stupid braying and
his habit of writing absurd and childish
letters. -
But if you poison my donkey it will
cost you a good deal more than you
will care to pay, especially in war-time.
It is a pity you're too old for the
army; you might have been shot by
now. Faithfully yours, . -
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
I had now got on to my fourth speed,
and dashed off this reply:-
DEAR FREDDY, I like you in all your
moods, but positively adore you when
you are angry. As a matter of fact I
am very fond of what are so absurdly
known as dumb animals, and am glad
now that the chemist's was closed last
night before I decided whether to go
there or not. BALAAM himself would
have been proud to own your animal.
It roused me from my bed this morning
with what was unmistakably a very fine
asinine rendering of the first few bars
of “The Yeoman's Wedding,” but un-
fortunately it lost the swing of it before
the end of the first verse.
Yours as ever,
HARRY.
Petherton gave up the contest; but
I let him have a final tweak after seeing
the announcement of his splendid and
public-spirited action to help on the
War Food scheme.
DEAR old Boy (I wrote), – How
stupid you must have thought me all
this time ! Only when I learnt from
the paragraph in this morning's Sur-
bury Eraminer that, in response to the
suggestion of the Rural District Council,
you have lent your field to the poor
people of the neighbourhood for grow-
ing War Food did I realise the meaning
of the dulcet-toned donkey's presence
in your field. -
The growing of more food at the
present time is an absolute necessity,
but it was left to you to discover this
novel method of proclaiming to Surbury
that here in its midst was land waiting
to be put to really useful purpose.
I do not know which to admire the
more, your patriotism or the ingenuity,
displayed in your selection of so admir-
able a mouthpiece from among your
circle of friends. Yrs., II.
Petherton has left it at that.

WAR'S ROMANCES.
[Now that fiction is occupying itself so
much with military matters, it is necessary
to warn the lady novelist—as it used to be
necessary in other days to warn her in relation
to sport—to cultivate accuracy. There is a
constant danger that the popular story will
include such passages as follow.]
“Corporal Cuthbert Crewdson,” said
the Colonel in a kindly voice," your work
has been very satisfactory—so much
so that I have decided to promote you.
From to-day you will no longer be
Corporal, but Lance-Corporal.” With
a grateful smile our hero saluted and
retired to draw his lance at the Adju-
tant's stores. -
“Darling," cried the handsome young
private, “I told the Colonel of our en-
gagement, and he said at once I might
bring you to tea at our Mess any Sun-
day afternoon.”
One night, as Private Jones and the
Sergeant-major were strolling arm-in-
arm through the High Street . . .
“Remember,” said the old Major,
eyeing his eighteen-year-old subaltern
son with a shrewd affectionate glance,
“a little well-placed courtesy goes a
long way. For instance, if a Sergeant
should call you ‘Sir," never forget to
say “Sir” to him.”
Osbert, his cane dangling from his left
hand and with Mabel at his side, sailed
proudly down Oxford Street. Suddenly
a Tommy hove in sight. At once Osbert
passed his stick to his other hand,
leaving the left one free. The next
moment the man was saluting, and
Osbert, bringing up his left hand in
acknowledgment, passed on.
“It is always well to be scrupu-
lously correct in these little details,”
he explained. -
Mildred, her heart beating rapidly,
stood shyly behind the muslin curtain
as George, looking very gallant in
khaki, strode past the window with
his frog hopping along at his side.
Sidney Bellairs, apparently so stern
and unbending on parade, was adored by
his men. Often he had been known,
when acting as “orderly officer” (as the
officer is called who has to keep order),
to carry round with him a light camp-
stool, which, with his unfailing charm
of manner, he would offer to some
weary sentry. “There, my boy, sit
down,” he would say, without a trace
of condescension.
Lord Debenham succeeded because
even in small things he could look
ahead.. “Ethelred,” he would say
to his batman, “there is to be a field-
day to-morrow, so see that my haver-
sack, water-bottle and slacks are put
ready for me in the morning.”
“Very good, my lord,” the orderly
would answer.
Marmaduke sprang forward. The
Hun's bomb, its pin withdrawn, was
about to explode. Coolly removing his
costly gold-and-diamond tie-pin, he
thrust this substitute into the ap-
pointed place in the terrible sizzling
bomb, and stood back with a little
smile. The next moment his General
stepped towards him and pinned to his
breast the Victoria Cross.
Colonel Blood belonged to the old
school—irascible, even explosive, but
at bottom a heart of gold. Often after
thrashing a subaltern with his cane for
some neglect of duty he would smile
suddenly and invite the offender to dine
with him at the Regimental Mess as if
nothing had happened.

“I Don't know if you realise,” said
Ernest, “that since Army signalling

“If you mean that an enthusiast

bour in the eye, I may say that I have

isn't worth worrying very much about.

“It isn't that,” said Ernest. “It's
something much more subtle and in-

“Imagine her saying that she's going

It's a dreadful thought. It will extend

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
'ednesday, February 7th. — His
MAJESTY opened Parliament to-day for
what we all hope will be the Victory
Session. But it will not be victory
without effort. That was the burden
of nearly all the speeches made to-day,
from the KING's downwards. His
MAJESTY, who had left his crown and
robes behind, wore the workmanlike
uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet; and
the Peers had forgone their scarlet and
ermine in favour of khaki and sable.
When Lord STANHOPE, who moved
the Address, ventured, in the course
of an oration otherwise sufficiently
sedate, to remark that “the great crisis
of the War had passed,” Lord CURzoN
was swift to rebuke this deviation into
cheerfulness. On the contrary, he de-
clared, we were now approaching “the
supreme and terrible climax of the
War.” He permitted himself, how-
ever, to impart one or two comforting
items of information with regard to the
arming of existing merchant-ships, the
construction of new tonnage and the
development of inventions for the dis-
covery and deletion of submarines. For
excellent reasons, no doubt, it was all
a little vague, but in one respect his
statement left nothing to be desired in
the way of precision.
Government, in its seven weeks of
office, had taken but two large and one
small hotels,” and is, I gather, marvel-
ling at its own moderation.
I was a little disappointed with the
speeches of the Mover and Seconder
of the Address in the Commons, for
of recent years there has been a
great improvement in this difficult
branch of oratory. Sir HEdworth
MEUx must, I think, have been
dazzled by the effulgence of his epau-
lettes, which were certainly more highly
polished than his periods. When in
mufti he is much briefer and brighter.
As Mr. Asquith however found both
speeches “admirable,” no more need
be said.
The LEADER of THE Opposition, as
one must for convenience style him—
though in truth there is no Opposition,
in the strict sense of the word—just
said what he ought to have said. For
one brief moment he seemed to be
straying on to dangerous ground, when
he put some questions regarding the
|scope of the coming Imperial Con-
“The present
ference; but the rest of his speech was
wholly in keeping with the peroration,
in which he pleaded that in the prose-
cution of the Nation's aim there should
be “no jarring voices, no party cross-
currents, no personal or sectional dis-
tractions.”
Unfortunately there is a section of
the Commons over which he exercises
no control. When Mr. BonAR LAw, as
Leader of the House, rose to reply,
the “jarring voices” of Mr. SNowden
and others of his kidney were heard in
chorus, calling for the PRIME MINISTER.
Mr. LAw paid no attention to the
interruption. He cordially thanked
Mr. Asquith for his speech, “the best
possible testimony to the unity of this
country,” and assured him that the
Imperial Conference would be prim-
arily concerned with the successful
prosecution of the War. The GERMAN
EMPERoR had proved himself a great

Later on Mr. PRINGLE reverted to
the absence of the PRIME MINISTER,
which he, as a person of taste, inter-
preted as “studied disrespect of the
House of Commons.” In this view
he was supported by Mr. KING. Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE must really be careful.
Strange to say, no public notice was
taken of another distinguished absentee
—the Member for East Herts. A few
days ago, after a violent collision with
Mr. JUSTICE DARLING, Mr. PEMBERTON-
BILLING announced his intention of
resigning his seat and submitting him-
self for re-election. But since then we
have been given to understand that a
vote of confidence proposed by PEM-
BERTON, seconded by BILLING, and
carried unanimously by the hyphen,
had convinced him that, as in the
leading case of Mr. CECII, RHoDEs,
“resignation can wait.”

Farming is always a bit of a gamble,
but in present conditions it beats the

proposals which Mr. Scott outlined to

denounced as revolutionary three years
ago, and were a little too drastic even

THE RECENT TRUCE.
STUDENTs of geography know that
Ballybun is divided from the back
gardens of Kilterash by the pellucid
waters of that noble stream, the Bun,
" which hurls itself over a barrier of old
tin-cans in a frantic effort to find the
sea. But they do not know that this
physical division, long ago bridged, is
nothing to the moral and political
division which will keep the two for
ever asunder.
Several of our younger citizens have
written to me from the trenches to ask
how the War is progressing. I have
usually in reply quoted the remark of
one of their number on leaving -
us for the Front after a j
holiday, that he was now look-
ing forward to a little peace
and rest. I wish here to add
a postscript to this concerning
a recent unexpected truce. | P.
Political geography is not ||
written as it should be, so that ||
there may be people who hº º
not even heard of the Great
War between Ballybun and
Kilterash. No one knows for
certain when it started, or why.
A local antiquary, after pro-
longed study of chronicles, me-
morials, rolls and records, to
say nothing of local church-
yards, refers it with some con-
fidence to the reign of HENRY
II. (Louis VII. being King of
France, in the pontificate of
AdRIAN IV. and so on), and to
the forcible abduction of a pig
(called the White Pearl) by the
then ruling monarch of Kilter-
ash. The Editor of The Kil-
worthy friend, the Editor of The Curfew,
who pointed out, more in anger than in
sorrow, that Ballybun had sent six men
fewer than Kilterash. The second
truce—again broken by the enemy—
concerned myself. Wishing to add, if
possible, to the evidence from monu-
ments contained in my pamphlet, I
was copying an inscription I had only
just discovered in the disused church-
yard of Killyburnbrae, when one of
these light Atlantic showers sprang up
and soaked me to the backbone. The
result was influenza and a high tem-
perature, which rose while I was read-

| THE garden wall was high, yet not
so high but that any young lady bent
on attracting the notice of her neigh-
bours could look over it. Miss Dot
indeed regarded an outside flight of
| steps which led to an upper storey as
an appointed amelioration to the hours
i which she was expected to spend in
the garden, for it was an easy scramble
from the stairs to the top of the wall,
whence she could survey the world.
| To be sure the wall was narrow as
well as high, but a timorous gait shows
off a pretty figure, and slight nervous-
ness adds a pathetic expression to a
pretty face; to both of which advan-
tages Dot was not, it is to be believed,
altogether indifferent when khaki coats
dwelt the other side of that wall.
| On this particular day she was trying
to attract, notice in so unrestrained a
manner that her mother remarked it
from an upper window. But mothers,
we are told in these latter days, are not
always the wisest guardians of their
“flapper" daughters. This mother had
a decided penchant for a khaki coat her-
self; only she demanded braid on the
cuff and a smartly cut collar, and these
she would greet in the street with a
tender act of homage which rarely
failed to win admiring attention. But
for a daughter who would dash down
the road after a Tommy she had con-
tempt rather than disapproval. So
she watched with interest, but, alas !
with no idea of interference.
At first there were only “civvies”
about, and though the admiration of any
youthful male was dear to Dot's heart,
and though chaff and blandishments
were not wanting, still the wall was high,
and she lacked the resolve to descend.
But presently two khaki coats appeared
and the matter grew more serious. It
was evident that it was not principle
or modesty that held her back, but just
timidity, for she responded eagerly to
the advances of her admirers, but could
not quite pluck up courage for that long
jump down. Affairs grew shameless,
for the khaki coats fetched a ladder to
assist the elopement; but Dot made it
clear that there were difficulties in that
method of flight, though she wished
there were not. At last she was en-
|ticed to a lower portion of the wall,
and there, half screened by shrubs,
she was lifted off by the shoulders,
deliciously reluctant, and received into

AT THE PLAY.
“FELIX GETs A MoRTH.”
This “whimsical comedy,” made by
Mr. LEON M. Lion out of a novel by the
late ToM GALLON, began in a distinctly
intriguing mood. Felix had an uncle, a
sport, on whom he had once played
a scurvy practical joke. This highly
tolerant victim eventually cut up for a
round million, which he left to nephew
Felix on condition that he should enter
Umberminster as naked as the day he
was born and earn his living therein
for a full calendar month—a palpable
posthumous hit to the old man. Felia:
accordingly, equipped as laid down in
the will, is left by the family solicitor
in a wood, and, after a night and a
day in hiding, appears shivering at the
Mayor's parlour window, abstracts a
rug for temporary relief, and prevails
upon the maid, a romantic little orphan
(who had been reading about river-
gods and mistakes Felix for one), to
borrow a suit of the Mayor's clothes—
| into which he gets in time to interview
that worthy when he returns with his
| grim lady. “You'll get a month,” says
she with damnable iteration; and the
| resourceful Felir, with an eye to the
whimsical will, whimsically suggests
that justice would be better fulfilled by
his putting in the month at the Mayor's
house as odd-job man than by his
being conveyed to the county jail. And
the Mayor whimsically agrees.

whimsicality took wing, and the show

which followed. The three incredible

the complications, though I confess I
half thought that the villain, Mr. LAw-
RENCE LEYTON, was pulling our legs
with a quite deliberate burlesque. On
the whole I am afraid this play is but
another wreck on that old snag of the
dramatised novel.
But there were plenty of isolated good
things, such as Mr. O. B. CLARENCE's

stroke of genius, his “call of the wild”
being by far the best whim of the

tenderly and prettily, but I couldn't
believe in Ninetta in that galley, and I
doubt if she did. Mr. GoRDON Ash was
the debonair hero. I do most solemnly
entreat him to consider the example of

have adopted a laugh as their principal

| OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.) -
It may be as well for me to confess at once the humiliat-
ing fact that I am not, and never have been, an Etonian.
If that be a serious disqualification for life in general, how
much more serious must it be for the particular task of
reviewing a book which is of Eton all compact, a book, for
example, like Memories of Eton Sirty Years Ago, by A. C.
AINGER, with contributions from N. G. LYTTELTON and
John MURRAY (MURRAY). For I have never been “up to ”
anybody; I have never been present at “absence"; I have
no real understanding of the difference between a “tutor”
and a “dame"; I call a “pama” by the plebeian name of
“imposition"; and, until I had read Mr. AINGER's book, I
had never heard of the verb “to brosier" or the noun sub-
stantive “bever.” Altogether my condition is most deplor-
able. Yet there are some alleviations in my lot, and one of
them has been the reading of this delightful book. I found it
most interesting, and can easily imagine how Etonians will
be absorbed in it, for it will revive for them many an old
and joyful memory of the days that are gone. Mr. AINGER
discourses, with a mitis sapientia that is very attractive, on
the fashions and manners of the past and the gradual pro-
cess of their development into the Eton of the present.
He is proud, as every good Etonian must be, of Eton as it
exists, but now and again he hints that the Eton of an
older time was in some respects a simpler and a better
place. The mood, however, never lasts long, and no one
can quarrel with the way in which it is expressed. General
| Lyttelton, too, in one of his contributions, relates how
Awe-struck Tommy (from the trenches). “Look, Bill—soldiens!”

on his return from a long stay in India he visited Eton,
expecting to be modestly welcomed by shy and ingenuous
youths, and how, instead, he was received and patron-
ised by young but sophisticated men of the world. The
GENERAL, I gather, was somewhat chilled by his experience.
Altogether this book is emphatically one without which no
Etonian's library can be considered complete.
Perhaps of all our War correspondents Mr. PHILIP GIBBs
contrives to give in his despatches the liveliest sense of the
movement, the pageantry and the abominable horror of
war. Pageantry there is, for all the evil boredom and
weariness of this pit-and-ditch business, and Mr. GIBBs
sees finely and has an honest pen that avoids the eas
cliché. You might truthfully describe his book, The Battles
of the Somme (HEINEMANN), as an epic of the New Armies.
He never seems to lose his wonder at their courage and
their spirit, and always with an undercurrent of sincerely
modest apology for his own presence there with his note-
book, a mere chronicler of others' gallantry. This chronicle
begins at the glorious 1st of July and ends just before
Beaumont-Hamel, which the author miserably missed,
being sent home on sick leave. It is a book that may well
be one of those preserved and read a generation hence by
men who want to know what the great War was really
like. God knows it ought to help them to do something to
prevent another. Yet there is nothing morbid in it. As the
sergeant thigh-deep in a flooded trench said, “You know,
Sir, it doesn't do to take this war seriously.” The
armies of a nation that takes its pleasures sadly take
their bitter pains with a grin; and that grin is what has

made them such an unexpectedly tough proposition to the
All-Seriousest. .
An old adage warns us never to buy a “pig in a poke.”
Equally good advice for the heroines of fiction or drama
would be never under any circumstances to marry a bride-
groom in a mask. In more cases than I can recall, neglect
of this simple precaution has led to a peck of trouble. I
am thinking now of Yvonne, leading lady in The Mark of
Wraye (Hutchinson). I admit that poor Yvonne had more
excuse than most. Hers was what you might call a hard
case. On the one hand there was the villain Philippe, a
most naughty man, swearing that she was in his power,
and calling for instant marriage at the hands of Father
Simon, who happened to be present. On the other hand,
the gentleman in the mask revealed a pair of eyes that poor
Yvonne rashly supposed to belong to someone for whom
she had more than a partiality. So when he suggested
that the proposed ceremony should take place during
Philippe's temporary ab I – -
sence from the stage,
with himself as substi-
tute, Yvonne (astonished
perhaps at her own luck
so early in the plot)
simply jumped at the
idea. Then, of course,
the deed being done, off
comes the mask, and
behold the triumphant
countenance of her bit-
terest foe, Charles de
Montbrison, whom she
herself had disfigured as
the (supposed) murderer
of her brother. Act drop
and ten minutes' inter-
val. Need I detail for
you the subsequent
course of this marriage
of inconvenience 2 The
courage and magnani-
mity of one side, the
feminine cruelty melting
at last to love, and finally
the inevitable duologue - - -
of reconciliation, through which I can never help hearing
the rustle of opera-cloaks and the distant cab-whistles.

The Flight of Mariette (CHAPMAN AND HALL) is a slender
volume, whose simplicity gives it a poignancy both incon-
gruous and grim. Much of it you might compare to the
diary of a butterfly before and whilst being broken on the
wheel. Mariette, the jolly little maid of Antwerp, was so
tender and harmless a butterfly; and the machine that
broke her life and drove her to the martyrdom of exile was
so huge and cruel a thing. How cruel in its effects it is
well for us just now to be again reminded, lest, in these days
of hurrying horrors, remembrance should be weakened.
To that extent therefore Miss GERTRUDE E. M. VAUGHAN
has done good service in compiling this human docu-
ment of accusation. In a preface Mr. John GALsworthy
pleads the cause of our refugee guests, not so much for
charity as for comprehension. Certainly, The Flight of

think I need only add that half the proceeds of its sale will
go to feed the seven million Belgians still in Belgium (prey
to the twin wolves of Prussia and starvation) for you to
see that three shillings and sixpence could hardly be better
used than in the purchase of a copy.
I was beginning to wonder whether Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts
was suffering from writer's cramp, so much longer than
usual does it seem since I heard from him. Now, how-
ever, my anxiety is relieved by My Devon Year (Scott), a
delightful book which could have come from no other pen
than his. It is a marvel how many fragrant things he
still finds to say, and with what inexhaustible freshness,
about his beloved county. I hesitate to give these sketches
an indiscriminate recommendation, because to those who
walk through the country with closed eyes they will have
little or no meaning; but if you are in love with beauty
and can appreciate its translation into exquisite language
you will draw from them a real and lasting joy. Let me
– - T confess now that I once
asked Mr. PHILLPOTTs to
give Devonshire a rest,
and that I accept My
|Devon Year as a con-
vincing proof that this
request was ill-consi-
|dered.
I wish Mr. Dougi,As
SLADEN would not throw
so many bouquets at his
characters. Roger Wyn-
yard, the hero of Grace
Lorraine (HUTCHINsoN),
was really just a very
ordinary youth, but when
I discovered that he was
“the fine flower of our-
Public-School system,”
“as chivalrous as a
Bayard,” and so forth,
I began—unfairly, per- |
haps, but quite irre-
|sistibly—to entertain a
considerable prejudice
- - against him. Let me
hasten, however, to add that Mr. SLADEN has packed his
novel with the kind of incident which appeals to the
popular mind, though his conclusion may cause a shock to
those who think that our divorce-laws are in no need of
reform. In the matter of style Mr. SLADEN is content
with something short of perfection. “It was easier for her
to forgive a man, with his happy-go-lucky nature, for
getting into trouble, than to forgive his getting out again
by not being sufficiently careful not to add to the other
person's misfortune.” For myself, I do not find it so easy
to forgive these happy-go-lucky methods in a writer who
ought to know better by now.

Doubtless you feel that such a fight
Would be a huge réclame for Hundom ;
That Earth would stagger at the sight
Of Gulielmus contra Mundum : -
That WILLIAM, facing awful odds,
Should prove a spectacle for men and gods.
(Tis true you have Allies who share
The toll you levy for the shambles,
Yet, judging by the frills you wear
In this your most forlorn of gambles,
One might suppose you stood alone
In solitary splendour all your own.).
And if the game against you goes,
As seems, I take it, fairly certain,
The Hero, felled by countless foes, .
Should make a rather useful curtain; ,
You could with honour cry for grace,
IIaving preserved the thing you call your face.
I shouldn't count too much on that.”
The globe is patient, slow and pensive,

The objects which it finds offensive;
And when it's done with you, my brave,
I doubt if you will have a face to save.

The President. Here you are then at last, my dear
Mr. GERARD. I am afraid you have had a long and uncom-

Mr. Gerard. Don't say a word about that, Mr. President.
It's all in the day's work, and, anyhow, it's an immense
pleasure to be back in one's own country.
The President. Yes, I can well believe that. Living
amongst Germans at this time can be no satisfaction to an
American citizen. -
Mr. G. No, indeed, Mr. President; you never said a
have all gone mad with self-esteem, and are convinced that
every criticism of their actions must have its foundations
in envy and malignity. And yet they feel bitterly, too,
that, in spite of their successes here and there, the War on
the whole has been an enormous disappointment for them,
and that the longer it continues the worse their position
becomes. The mixture of these feelings makes them
grossly arrogant and sensitive to the last degree, and
reasonable intercourse with them becomes impossible.
No, Mr. President, they are not pleasant people to live
amongst at this moment, and right glad am I to be away
from them. - -
The President. And as to their submarine warfare, do
they realise that we shall hold them to what they have
promised, and that if they persist in their policy of murder
there must be war between them and us?
Mr. G. The certainty that you mean what you say has
but little effect on them. They argue in this way: Germany
is in difficulties; the submarine weapon is the only one
that will help Germany, therefore Germany must use that
weapon ruthlessly and hack through with it, whatever may
be urged on behalf of international law or humanity at
large. Humanity doesn't count in the German mind
because humanity doesn't wear a German uniform or look
upon the KAISER as absolutely infallible. Down, therefore,
with humanity and, incidentally, with America and all the
smaller neutrals who may be disposed to follow her lead.
The President. So you think patience, moderation and
reasonable argument are all useless?
Mr. G. See here, Mr. President, this is how the matter
stands. They imagine they can ruin England with their
submarines — they're probably wrong, but that's their
notion—but if they give way to America this illegitimate
weapon is blunted and they lose the war. Sooner than
suffer that catastrophe they will defy America. And they
don't believe as yet that America means what she says
and is determined to fight rather than suffer these outrages
to continue. The Germans will try to throw dust in
your eyes, Mr. President, while continuing the submarine
atrocities. - -
The President. The Germans will soon be undeceived.
We will not suffer this wrong, and we will fight, if need be,
in order to prevent it. God knows we have striven to keep
the peace through months and years of racking anxiety.
If war comes it is not we who have sought it. Nobody can
lay that leproach upon us. Rather have we striven by all
honourable means to avoid it. But we have ideals that we
cannot abandon, though they may clash with German
ambitions and German methods. There we are fixed, and
to give way even by an inch would be to dishonour our
country and to show ourselves unworthy of the freedom our
forefathers won for us at the point of the sword. That is
the conclusion I have come to, having judged these matters
with such power of judgment as God has given me.
Mr. G. And to that every true American will say Amen.

THE WATCH DOGS.
I,VI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, The weather is
very seasonable for the time of year, is
it not 2 A nice nip in the air, as you
might say; thoroughly healthy for those
at liberty to enjoy it al fresco. I assure
you the opportunity is not being wasted
out here; all the best people are out-of-
doors all the time. For myself, with
thirty degrees of frost about, it seemed
to be the exact moment to slip over to
England and help keep the home fires
burning.
Accordingly I repaired to a neigh-
bouring port, and when I got there an
officer, who appeared to be looking for
something, asked me what my rank
was. In peace times I should have
loved a little unexpected
sympathy like this; as a
soldier, quite an old soldier
now, I dislike people who
take an interest in me, es-
pecially if they have blue on
their hats. I thanked him
very much for his kind in-
quiry, but indicated that my
lips were sealed. His curi-
osity thereupon became
positively acute; he was, he
said, a man from whom it
was impossible to keep a
secret. He still wished to
know what my rank was.
I said it all depended which
of them he was referring to,
since there are three in all,
the “Acting,” the “Tem-
porary” and the Rock-bot-
tom one. In any case, at
heart I was and always
should remain a plain civi-
lian mister.
leave it at that, and let bygones be by-
gones? He was meditating his answer,
when I asked him if he realised how
close he was standing to the edge of
the quay, and when he turned round
and looked I also turned round and
went . . .
The fellow who was standing next
to me all this time was either too
young or too proud to conceal his stars
beneath an ordinary waterproof. Blue-
hat didn't need to ask him what his
rank was ; he recognized at a glance just
the very type of officer he was looking
for. So he led off the poor fellow to the
slaughter, and put him in charge of two
hundred N.C.O.s and men proceeding
on leave to the U.K. I've no doubt the
fellow spent the best part of his days
on the other side trying to get rid of
his party. I have not i. two years
in France without discovering that you
simply cannot be too careful when you
are attempti. g to get out of it.
When I reached England my feelings
with regard to myself changed. I was
no longer reticent about my rank. I
displayed my uniform in a public restau-
rant, without any reserve. In conse-
quence they'd only let me eat three-and-
sixpence worth for my first meal. This
time I was not so clever, it appeared, as
I thought. I had erroneously supposed
that by not being a civilian I should
get more than two courses. As it
was I got less, and so it was with a
full heart and an empty stomach that
I fell in for home. If I'd known I
should have kept my waterproof on for
| luncheon.
Do you realise how dismal a thing
it is for us to be separated from our
own by a High Sea all these months

ain't fair. In my case there is not
only a wife amongst wives, but also
a son amongst sons. Now, Charles,
I am the very last person to call a
thing good merely because it is my
own, nor am I that kind of fool
who thinks all his geese are swans.
If my son had a fault I should be the
very first to notice and call attention to
it. But he has not ; dispassionately
and from an entirely detached and im-
personal view, I am bound to say that
there is about him an outstanding
merit which at once puts him on a
different level from all others. It isn't
so much his four and a half teeth I'm
thinking of, nor is it the twenty-seven
overgrown and badly managed hairs
which wander about at the back of his
bald head and give him the look of a
dissipated monk. It is just his intrinsic
worth, clearly evidenced in everythin
about him. Obviously a man of parts,
he has brains, a stout heart and an
unfailing humour. Blessed with a keen
perception, he delights those who can
understand him with his singularly
happy and apt turn of speech. You
will, I think, accept my word as an
officer and a gentleman that he is
unique.
- Anticipating the welcome greeting of
my wife and many pleasant hours to
be spent in discussing withf my son the
things which matter, I put on all my
waterproofs, gave the porter a twenty-
five centime piece, which he mistook
for a shilling, even as earlier on I had
myself been led to mistake it for a
franc, and hastened home.
The welcome greeting seemed all
right, but I had not been long in the
and years? It ain't fair, Sir, it simply
company of my wife before I dis-
covered that Another had come between
with my son before I dis-
covered who that Other
was. . . . I determined to
have it out with him at once.
Feeling that the situation
was one for tactics, I man-
ocuvred for position and,
to get him entirely at a dis-
advantage, I surprised him
in his bath and taxed him
with his infamy. I ad-
dressed him more in sorrow
than in anger. I told him
I was well aware of his per-
sonal charm, but in this
instance I was bound to
comment unfavourably on
the use he had made of it.
The very last thing I had
expected of him was that at,
or indeed before, the early
age of one he would be
lºng the affections of
– another man's wife.
He was not ashamed or nonplussed;
he was not even embarrassed by his im-
mediate environment. In fact he turned
it to his own advantage, for his hairs,
duly watered and soaped down on to his
cranium, lost their rakish look and gave
him the appearance of a gentleman of
perfect integrity, great intellect and no
little financial stability. As between
one man and another, he did not at-
tempt to deny the truth of my assertion,
gave me to understand, with a jovial
smile, that such little incidents must
always be expected as long as humanity
remains human, and repudiated all per-
sonal responsibility in this instance.
He even went so far as to suggest that
it was the woman's fault; it was always
she who was running "after him, and
his only offence had been that of being
too chivalrous abruptly to repel her
advances. I confess I was painfully
surprised at the attitude he adopted; it
consisted in putting his foot in one half
us. I had not been long ||

of his mouth and breathing stertorously
through the other moiety. And when
he started making eyes at the nurse I
was too shocked to stay any longer.
Never a man to take a thing sitting
down, I waited till the next morning
for my revenge. As the trustee of his
future wealth I had him in my power.
Stepping across to the nearest bank I
borrowed an immense sum of money in
his name and passed it all on to the
Government, then and there, to be spent,
inter alia, on the B.E.F. And what's
more, I told him to his face that I'd
done it. What reply do you suppose he
made? He merely called for a drink.
However, my revenge did not end
there. On my way back to France I
seized the opportunity of looking in at
Cox's and there took back from the
Government for my own sole and abso-
lute use some of those very pounds my
son had borrowed from the bank to give
it. But I lost in the end, for my wife,
whom I had taken with me to witness
her and his discomfiture, had all the
money off me again, in order, I gather,
to put it in my son's money-box, for
him to rattle now and spend later. The
only result of my efforts therefore was
to land me in a financial transaction so
complicated that I cannot even follow
it myself. Yours ever, HENRY.

THE HARDSHIPS OF BILLETS.
II.
Nobody knows the misery of bein’
lapped in luxury in a billet better than
me and Jim. Mrs. Dawkins, as I told
you, give us the best of everything in
the 'ouse and our lives wasn't worth
livin' owin' to Mr. Dawkins and the
little Dawkinses and a young man
lodger takin' against us in consekence.
Seein' that they 'adn't a bed between
'em while we was given one apiece and
their end of the table had next to
nothin' on when ours was weighed
down with sausages and suchlike, it
were not surprisin' that Mr. Dawkins
and the lodger swore at us and the
little Dawkinses put their tongues out.
But it were upsettin', and Jim and me
did 'ope when we was moved to Mrs.
Larkins's that we had a better time in
store.
“Just goin' to the Front, ain't they,
poor fellows?” she said to the billetin'
orficer. “I’ll do my best by 'em.
Nobody wouldn't like to coddle 'em
better than I should, but 'twould be
crule kindness to 'em, I knows. If
'ardships are in store for 'em let 'em
'ave a taste before they goes, I says,
and it won't fall so 'eavy on 'em when
they gets there.” -
“There's as comfortable a feather
bed as you could wish to sleep on ready
and waitin' for you,” she said to us, “but
who with a woman's heart in her could
ut you on a feather bed knowin' you'll
e sleepin' on the bare earth before
three weeks is over your poor heads?
I've put you a shake of straw on the
floor for to-night. I'll take it away
to-morrow so as you shall get used to
the boards. I've wedged the winders
top and bottom to make a draught
through; that'll help you to bear the
wind over there.”
It were a north-east wind, and it
reglar took 'old of Jim. He's inclined
to toothake, and in the mornin' his
face were as big as a football. “I am
thankful I thought of the winders,”
Mrs. Larkins said; “you'd 'ave suffered
terrible if you'd 'ad the faceake for the
first time in the trenches; now you'll
get used to it before you gets there.
A pepper plaster 'ud ease you direckly,
but you're goin' where there's no such
things as pepper plasters, and it 'ud be
a sin to let you taste the luxury of one
over 'ere.”
Jim was for runnin' to the doctor
to 'ave the tooth took out, but Mrs.
Larkins wouldn't 'ear of it. “My poor
fellow,” she said, “do you think a doctor
'll come along with his pinchers all
ready to take your tooth out in the
trenches 2 You'll more like 'ave to do
it yourself with a corkscrew. I'll lend
you one willin'.” But Jim said he
wouldn't trouble her just at present,
he was feelin' a little easier.
She didn't cook us nothin' to eat.
“My fingers itch to turn you out
beyutiful dishes as your mouths 'ud
water to come to a second time,” she
said, “but it 'ud be a crule kindness,
knowin' you'll be fendin' for your-
selves in a 'ole in the ground in three
weeks' time. Better learn 'ow to do
it now. There's a bit o' meat, and
you can dig up any vegetables you
fancy in the garden. I'll rake the
fire out so as you shall learn 'ow to
light a fire for yourselves; and I'll put
the saucepans out of your way; it
ain't likely you'll 'ave saucepans over
there.”
We was never nearer starvin' than
we was at Mrs. Larkins's. She said it
made her heart bleed to see us, but we
should be grateful to 'er one day for
teachin' us 'ow to cook our vittels for
ourselves or go without 'em.
One of Jim's buttons come loose on
his tunic and he asked Mrs. Larkins
if she would be so kind as to sew it
on for him. “Nothin' would please
me better than to sew 'em all on,
they're mostly 'angin' by a thread,”
she said; “but do you expect to find
a woman in the trenches all 'andy to
sew on your buttons? You'll 'ave to
sew 'em on yourself, and the sooner
you learn 'ow to do it the better.”
We was accustomed to 'ave our
washin' done for us in our other billets,
but when the second Sunday come at
Mrs. Larkins's and there wasn't no
sign of a clean shirt we felt obliged to
mention it to 'er. “’Ere's a bit o'
soap and a bucket,” she said, “ and you
knows where the well is.”
When we'd washed 'em we was
goin' to 'ang 'em round the fire to dry;
but she wouldn't 'ear of it. “Where 'll
you find a fire to dry 'em by over
there?” she said: “you'll 'ave to wear
'em wet.” And when we got the rheu-
matics she said, “Ah, a wet shirt's
sure to do it. You'll never be without
it over there. It's a mercy you've got
a touch now. I shouldn't be sorry if I
see you limpin' a bit more.”
It took us some time in the trenches
to get over our 'ardenin' at Mrs. Lar-
kins's. -

IMPORTANT NoTICE.
From Monday next the price of The
Wiggleswick Weekly (with which is in-
corporated The Bindleton Advertiser
and The Swashborough Gazette) will be
17s.6d. per copy. If this—the forty-
seventh—increase in price does not
bring about the desired reduction in
circulation we shall unhesitatingly ad-
vance the price to £1 9s. 5; d. per copy.
The management of The Wiggleswick

what sacrifice, to limit the circulation
to forty copies weekly.

some MoRE BAD words.
IN a recent verse adventure
I compiled “a little list”
Of the verbs deserving censure,
Verbs that “never would be
missed”;
Now, to flatter the fastidious,
Suffer me the work to crown
With three epithets—all hideous—
And one noisome noun.
First, to add to the recital
Of the words that gall and irk,
Is the old offender “vital,”
Done to death by overwork;
Only a prolonged embargo
On its use by Press and pen
Can recall this kind of argot
Back to life again.
I, in days not very distant,
Though the memory gives me pain,
From the awful word “insistent”
Did not utterly refrain;
Once it promised to refresh us,
Seemed to be alert enough ;
Now I loathe it, laboured, precious—
Merely verbal fluff.
Thirdly, in the sheets that daily
Cater for our vulgar needs,
There's a word that figures gaily
In reviewers' friendly screeds,
Who declare a book’s “arresting,”
Mostly, it must be confessed,
Meaning just the problem-questing
Which deserves arrest.
Last and vilest of this bad band
Is that noun of gruesome sound,
“Uplift,” which the clan of Chadband
Hold in reverence profound;
Used for a dynamic function
'Tis a word devoid of guile,
Only as connoting unction
It excites my bile.
Why, fastidious poetaster,
Waste your energy and breath
Like a petulant schoolmaster
Only doing words to death Ž
Needlessly you slate and scourge us;
War, that sifts and tries and tests,
May be safely left to purge us
Of these verbal pests.
England, February, 1917.-"The
great loan land.”

the country will stand much criticism
of the new Government by members
of the old one.
Tuesday, February 13th. – Lord
BERESFORD, in latter days heard with
difficulty in the House of Commons,
has found his voice again in the ampler
air of the Gilded Chamber. His speech
this afternoon on the submarine peril
and how to defeat it might have
wakened the echoes in the Admiralty
at the far end of Whitehall. It evoked
an admirable reply from Lord LYTTON,

British tar in appearance, has evidently

their breath. But some of them were
soon hard at work again heckling the
Government over the multiplication
of new departments and secretariats.
Mr. Swift MACNEILL, whose reverence
for the Constitution (save in so far as it
applies to Ireland) knows no bounds,
could hardly contain his fury at the
setting up of a War Cabinet—“a body
utterly unknown to the law"—and the
inclusion therein of Ministers without
portfolios but with salaries.
He received a certain amount of
rather gingerly support from Mr.
RUNCIMAN and Mr. SAMUEL, who had
evidently not forgotten what hap-
pened to Mr. McKENNA yesterday. Mr.
SAMUEL was a distinguished Member
Necessarily reticent as to the exact of a Government under which both the
nature of the steps that are being taken Ministry and the bureaucracy were
to deal with the sea-highwaymen, he swollen in peace-time to unprecedented

But which transforms (subject to the opin-
complaining that under the present
régime the Administration had been fur-
ther magnified until, if all its members,
including Under-Secretaries, were pre-
sent, they would fill not one but three
Treasury Benches. Already it is a much-
congested district at Question-time and
is the daily scene of a Great Push.
If underlying these criticisms there
was a hope that they would draw the
PRIME MINISTER from the seclusion of
his private room, it was doomed to dis-
appointment. Mr. BonAR LAW, assert-
ing his position as Leader of the House,
and not, as some people seemed to
imagine, the PRIME MINISTER's deputy,
made a spirited defence of the new
Ministerial arrangements as being
essential for the conduct of the War,
and challenged his opponents, if they
wanted to make sure of the PRIME
MINISTER’s presence, to
move a Vote of Censure.
At Question - time Mr.
LAw had instructed the
House how to discover
the emblems on the new
Treasury. Note—the rose,
the thistle, the shamrock
and the daffodil (this last
for Wales). On the Treas-
ury"Bench the daffodil is
rarely to be descried; but
the thistle is in full bloom

Wednesday, February
14th-To-day the Vice-
Chamberlain of the House-
hold bore a message from
the KING in reply to the
Address. The House on
these occasions is apt to
in the messenger, and watches eagerly
to see if he will trip in his backward
march from the Chair, or forget one of
the customary three bows. The present
holder of the office does his work so
featly and with such obvious enjoyment
as to give a new significance to the
phrase . . . “With nods and BEcks
and wreathèd smiles.”
Most of us only remember the late
King THEBAw of Burma as a blood-
thirsty and dissipated despot. It has
been reserved for Sir JohN REEs to find
a redeeming feature in his character.
Among all his crimes, he never, it
seems, prohibited the consumption of
drink in his realm, though I fancy that
his own efforts in that line considerably
reduced the amount available for his
subjects. Implored by the hon. Member
not to turn Burma into a “dry” State,
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN would say nothing
more than that he declined (very pro-
perly) to take THEBAw as his model.

has occupied a more difficult position
than Mr. BonAR LAw. But he is daily
becoming more at home in the saddle,
and can even venture upon a joke or
two. Mr. PRINGLE opposed the sus-
pension of the Eleven-o'clock Rule on
the ground, inter alia, that “he only
wanted to get away.” “That,” said
Mr. LAw suavely, “is a result which
can easily be attained,” and the
House, which is getting a little weary
of Mr. PRINGLE's frequent and acidu-
lated interposition, noted his discom-
fiture with approving cheers.
Thursday, February 15th. — Lord
CURzoN, in a happy phrase, described
the late Duke of Norfolk as “diffident
about powers which were in excess of
the ordinary.” Is not that true of the
British race as a whole? Only now,
under the stress of a long-drawn-out
conflict, is it discovering the variety
and strength of its latent forces.
There are, of course, exceptions to
this rule—strong men who are fully
conscious of their strength. Lord

THE ART OF DETACHMENT.
(Being a letter from a cloistered lady
visiting London to her sister in the
Shires.)
MY DEAR RUTH,-Beginning at the
beginning, let me tell you that you
must at once go to the station to in-
quire how it is that they forced me
to pay thirty shillings for my ticket,
instead of one pound. Although the
price one pound is printed on the
ticket, I couldn't get it until I had
paid ten shillings extra. There was
no time to get a proper explanation, so
I want you to do so. Very likely it is
sheer blackmail by that man in the
booking-office, whom I never cared for.
You had better see the station-master
about it.
The next thing I want to tell you
is that most of our ideas of London
are wrong. You remember how we
used to be told about its wonderful
lighting at night, and the comfort of
its hotels, and the bright shops, and
the crowds of taxis, and so on. Well,
this isn't true at all. So far from being
well-lighted, I assure you that our few
little streets and market square are a
blaze compared with this city. Some
streets here are absolutely dark, and
even in the great thoroughfares there
is so little light that crossing the road
is most perilous. The thing could be
put right in a moment if they would
only see to it that the lamps were
cleaned; I looked closely at several
of them and I could see exactly what
was wrong—a coat of grimy stuff has
accumulated on the glass. Now to get
this off would be quite easy, but it
does not seem to have occurred to any-
one to do it. I suppose that London
is very badly managed; and here again
I think the advantage lies with us, for
I am certain that our District Council
would never allow such a state of
things. Probably the LoRD MAYor is
lazy.
The funny thing is that there is
plenty of good light, only they don't
know how to apply it. Every night,
directly it begins to be dark, great
streams of light are turned on from all
parts of the city; but would you believe
it, they are directed, not downwards
so that they could illumine the street,
but upwards into the empty sky! If
the Chairman of our District Council
could see this, how he would laugh!
I wish you would tell him.
Then there is coal. I went, as we
arranged, first to the Jerusalem Hotel,
but it was like ice. When I asked the
hotel people why the central heating
was not on, they said that there is no
coal. At least it seems that there is
coal, but no one to deliver it. Just
think of our coal-merchant returning
such a reply to us when the cellar was
getting empty. But in London they
seem to be ready to put up with any
excuse. Why the men who ought to
deliver the coals are not made to, I
can't imagine. Anyhow, as I was freez-
ing, I moved into lodgings, where there
is coal, although an exorbitant price is
asked for each scuttle.
The great topic of conversation every-
where has been some new speculation
called the War Loan, and I have to
confess that as it is so well spoken of
and is to pay the large dividend of
54 per cent. I have arranged to invest
something for each of us in it. I
don't know who the promoter—a Mr.
BoNAR LAw—is, but it would be awful
for us if he turned out to be a. JABEz
BALFour in disguise. Still, nearly all
investment is a gamble, and we can only
hope for the best. He must have some
peculiar position or the papers would
not support his venture as they do;
and there is even a campaign of public
speakers through the country, I am told;
taking his prospectus as their text and
literally imploring the people to invest.
Quite like the South Sea Bubble we read

Judging by the crowded state of all
the myriad places of entertainment
in this city there are millions who
are like them. But I couldn't help
thinking that if so much money
seems really to be needed, and this
Mr. LAw is really a public benefactor,
it might not be a bad idea to try to
divert some of the thousands of pounds
being paid every day in London alone
for sheer amusement. Of course if
England had the misfortune to be at
war most of these places would natur-
ally be shut up.
By the way, Germans are strangely
unpopular in London just now. I have
heard numbers of people, all in differ-

OXFORD REVISITED.
LAST week, a prey to military duty,
I turned my lagging footsteps to the West;
I have a natural taste for scenic beauty,
And all my pent emotions may be guessed
To find myself again
At Didcot, loathliest junction of the plain.
But all things come unto the patient waiter,
“Beholdſ” I cried, “in yon contiguous blue

With Youth's fair aureole clustering on a brow
That no amount of culture (herpecidal)
Will coax the semblance of a crop from now,
Once more I make ye mine;
There is a train that leaves at half-past nine.
“In a rude land where life among the boys is
One long glad round of cards and coffin juice,
And any sort of intellectual poise is
The constant butt of well-expressed abuse,
And it is no disgrace
To put a table-knife inside one's face,
“I have remembered picnics on the Isis,
Bonfires and bumps and BoFFIN's cakes and tea,
Nor ever dreamed a European crisis
Would make a British soldier out of ine—
The mute inglorious kind

“But here I am ” (I mused) “and quad and cloister
Are beckoning to me with the old allure;
The lovely world of Youth shall be mine oyster
Which I for one-and-ninepence can secure,

Cluttered with youthful soldiers forming fours;
While the drum stutters and the bugler blows his
Loud summons, and the hoarse bull-sergeant roars,
While almost out of view -
The thrumming biplane cleaves the astonished blue?
It is a sight to stir the pulse of poet,

THE GREAT INVESTMENT.
I AM a fair man, even to Huns. When Germany pays |
an indemnity of £2,000,000,000 I think we might knock off
a tenner or so because the KAISER has done so much to
beautify our banks. Once they were cold cheerless places.
A suspicion of an overdraft always swept through them.
Now I love to go to the bank and see the beautiful blonde
and brown and auburn heads bent over the ledgers. If I
could be quite certain that they were not looking up the
details of my account I should be perfectly happy.
Somebody told me that I could buy War Loan at 54 per
cent. by borrowing money from my bank at five per cent.
This seemed to be the kind of investment I had been
looking for. I found that if I took a million on those terms
I should draw a net income of £2,500 a year. But I am
a patriot. It seemed to me that £2,500 a year was rather
more than I was worth to the nation. Was I better value
than six M.P.'s 2. Of course I might be worth six RAMSAY
MACDoNALDs. - However I resolved to avoid greed and ask
for a simple hundred thousand.
So I went to my bank and said to a blue-eyed, Watteau
type of beauty, “I want to see the manager, please.
Concerning an important investment in War Loan,” I
added hastily, fearing lest the damsel should conclude that
I wanted an ordinary overdraft. -
I was ushered into the manager's private room.
“About this War Loan,” I began. “I understand that you
advance money at five per cent. to make the purchase.”
“Yes, that is so,” said the manager, beaming.
I leapt for joy. I had thought that there must be a
catch somewhere. -
“Put me down for a hundred thousand,” I said.
The manager nearly fell out of his swing-chair. “My
dear Sir," he gasped, “have you any prospect of being able
to save a hundred thousand during the next year or so?”
“Am I a milk-dealer or a munition-worker?" I replied.
“I should be both surprised and gratified if I saved that
sum in a year. Still I might do it, you know. I should
have to give up tobacco, of course. Or suppose relations
hitherto unknown to me died and left me handsome
legacies. You are always seeing these things in the papers.
‘Baker Inherits Half-Million From Lost Australian Uncle.’”
“A hundred,” amended the manager. “Shall we say a
hundred? You need not pay a deposit. I'll give you a form.”
“Where's your patriotism 2 " I demanded. “A hundred,
you say ? Well, I decline your overdraft. Keep your ill-
gotten much-grudged gain. I'll pay cash."
I left the bank sadly. I had thought of intimating to
the blonde, brown and auburn beauties that I had just put
a hundred thousand in War Loan. I had imagined their
eyes gleaming at the spectacle of one-tenth of a millionaire.
And now I can't go to the bank again. At least not till
I have worked up my balance a little above its present total,
namely £2 1s. 9d.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If Wishes were Horses (HURST AND BLACKETT) is one of
the most engaging novels that I have met for some time.
The matter of it, perhaps, is nothing very new : a story of
expanding fortunes and contracting sympathies. But the
writer, Countess BARCYNskA, has, before all else, the
inestimable gift of making you believe in her people. All
the characters are vigorously alive... The result is that one
follows with quite unusual interest the chequered career
of her central figure, Martin Leffley, from his introduction
as a frankly unpleasant youth, very red about the ears,
“which was where he always blushed,” to the final glimpse
of him, titled, an M.P., and, incidentally, a bowed and better
man, purified by the wonderful devotion of Rose, the wife
whom throughout the tale he has bullied and undervalued.
Nor is Rose herself, with her unwavering belief in her clay
idol, a less memorable figure. Of the others, my chief
affection went to Aunt Polly, the kindly dealer in old
clothes, who imagined the Savile to be a night club. But,
as I say, the whole cast is astonishingly real. Only once
did I fear for the story, when it seemed as though the
machinations of a super-villainous M.P. were about to lead
it astray into the paths of melodrama. But the danger
proved to be brief, and the unexpected beauty and dig-
nity of the closing chapter would have redeemed a more
serious lapse. -
Forced to Fight (HEINEMANN) is the record of a Schleswig
Dane set forth by ERICH ERICHSEN and very capably trans-
lated from the Danish by INGEBORG LUND. It is a book
that with a singular skill and with a passion that never
gets out of hand so as to convey the impression of hyster-
ical exaggeration lays bare the heart of a youth who was
at the storming of Liége, fought in Flanders, then on the
Russian Front and again in the Argonne, whence a shat-
tered elbow sent him home broken and aged—that is what
his chronicler emphasises—not by the wound, but by the
long horror and fatigue of the successive campaigns. The
poignancy of his sufferings lay in the fact that as a Dane
he went without any of the great hopes and passions that
inspired his German comrades, of whom however he speaks
with no ill-will. He took part by order in some of the
“punishments” of Belgian villages, loathing the savage
cruelties of them and deeply convinced that the rape of
Belgium was an inexpiable wrong which the world will
remember to the lasting dishonour of the German name.
You get an impression of the added horror of this War for
the imaginative temperamental, and some pathetic pictures
of all the suffering among simple innocent machine-driven
people on the other side, who had no will to war and no
illusions as to the splendour of world-dominion—a vision
of desolate homes and countrysides empty of all but very
old men.
The first lines of Still Life (CoNSTABLE), which begins in
“the night train from the German frontier to Paris,” gave
me much the same impression of impossibility (was there
ever such a train?) that I should have felt about a story
that opened in the moon. But the shock of this was
nothing to some, different in character, that were to follow.
Frankly, I confess that Mr. MIDDLEToN MURRY's book has
me baffled. Others perhaps may admire the pains lavished

by the author in analysing the emotions of a group of
characters whose temperaments certainly give him every
opportunity for this exercise. An impressionist, and
impressionable, youth, whom I have (reluctantly) to call
hero, intrigues his unpleasant way through the plot; first
in Paris—where you may make a shrewd guess at his pre-
occupations—then in an English village, to which he has
eloped with the wife of a friend; in France again, and so on.
The emotions to which these amorous adventures expose
him are handled by the author with a care that suggests
rather the naughtiness of the antique nineties than anything
belonging to these more vigorous days. I am far from
suggesting that, as a study in super-sensibility, the book
lacks skill. There are indeed scenes of almost painful
cleverness. My complaint is that it is out of date, or (I
should perhaps better say) conspicuously out of harmony
with the present time. . But if you hanker for these pictures
of the past that is another matter. I will merely issue
a warning that you should preserve this book on some
The Bodley Head I have no doubt that Canada Chaps will
be welcome. I hope, however, that Mrs. SIME will not
mind my saying that the best of her tales are those which
have more to do with Canada than its “chaps.” Her
stories of fighting and of fighters seem to me to have a note
in them that does not ring quite true. It is just the differ-
ence between the soldier telling his own artless and rugged
tale and someone else telling it for him with a touch of
artifice. But when the author merely uses the War as her
background she writes with real power. The straining for
effect vanishes, and so little do the later stories resemble
the earlier that I should not have guessed that they were
written by the same hand. “Citoyenne Michelle” and
“The King's Gift,” for instance, are true gems, and they
are offered to you at the price of paste. Nowhere will you
find a better bargain for your shilling.
HELEN MACKAY, in A Journal of Small Things (MELRose),
sets before us with, it might seem, almost too deliberate
shelf not too accessible by
those who are still young
enough to overestimate its
importance.
It was an odd experience
to turn, as I did, directly
from the new Haymarket
play, of which the late ToM
GALLON was part author, to
what I suppose was the
last story he ever wrote,
The Lady in the Black Mask
(MILLs AND Boon), which
begins in a theatre with the
heroine watching a play.
It begins, moreover, very
well and excitingly; much
better, I regret to add,
than it goes on. When
the heroine arrived home
from the theatre, the girl
whose companion she was,
pleading fatigue, persuaded
her to go out again to a
masked ball, wearing the

tress. The two girls, Ruth, the heroine, and Damia,
lived in a gloomy house with old Mr. Verinder, who
was Damia's guardian. But when Ruth returned from
the ball she found that this arrangement no longer held
good, Verinder having been melodramatically stabbed
during her absence. And as no one knew, or would
ever believe, that it was Damia and not herself who had
remained at home you recognise a very pretty gambit of
intrigue. Unfortunately, as I said above, the tension is not
quite sustained, partly because the characters all behave
in an increasingly foolish and improbable fashion (even for
tales of this genre); partly because there is never sufficient
uncertainty as to who it was (not, of course, Damia) who
really killed Verinder. Still, of its kind, as the sort of
shocker that used to be valued at a shilling, but appears,
like everything else, to have risen in price, The Lady in the

might have been greater before the discouragement of rail-
way travelling. That is precisely the environment for
which she is best fitted.

THE BROKEN soldiers.
“Now,” I suggested as we left the drapery department,
“you've got as much as you can carry.” Unfortunately it
was impossible to relieve her of the parcels as I had all my
work cut out to manipulate those confounded crutches.
“There's only the toy department," returned Pamela,
leading the way with her armful of packages. “I do hope
you're not frightfully tired.” Of course it seemed ridiculous,
but I had not been out of hospital many days, and as yet I
had not grown used to stumping about in this manner.
“Do you happen," asked Pamela at the counter, “to have
such a thing as a box of broken soldiers?”
The young woman looked astonished and even a little
hurt, but offered, with condescension, to inquire.
“Do you want them for Dick?” I asked, Dick being
Pamela's youngest brother.
“For Dick and Alice,” said Pamela.
sister, younger still.
“Why shouldn't I buy them a box of whole ones?”
“That wouldn't answer the purpose. They have three
large boxes already,” answered Pamela, as a young man
appeared in a frock coat, with a silver badge on the right
lapel, “For Services Rendered.” In his hand was a dusty
cardboard box, and in the box lay five damaged leaden
soldiers, up-to-date soldiers in khaki; two without heads,
two armless, one who had lost both legs. -
“Those will do splendidly," said Pamela, and the
young man with the silver badge obligingly put the soldiers
into my tunic pocket. It seemed to be understood that they
and I had been knocked out in the same campaign.
Alice was her
“Why," I asked on the way home in the taxi, “did you
want the soldiers to be broken 2"
“I—I didn't,” murmured Pamela, with a sigh.
“Why did Dick?” I persisted.
“The children are so dreadfully realistic now-a-days.
You see, Father objected to his breaking heads and arms off
his new ones. Dick was quite rebellious. He wanted to
know what he was to do for wounded; and Alice was more
disappointed still.” -
“I should have thought it was too painful a notion for
her,” I suggested. - -
“Oh !” cried Pamela, with a laugh, “Alice is a Red
Cross nurse, you know. She's made a hospital out of a
Noah's Ark. She only thinks of healing them.”
“All the King's horses and all the King's men cannot
put Humpty Dumpty together again,” I said.
“Poor old boy!” whispered Pamela.
“I wonder whether broken soldiers have an interest for
you as well,” I remarked . . . and Dick and Alice were com-
pletely forgotten until they met us clamorously in the hall.
“Did you get any, Pam 2" cried Dick. . . -
“Only five,” was the answer, as I took the small paper
parcel from my pocket and handed it over.
“Is that all 2" demanded Alice.
“There's one more,” I said.
“Is that for me?" cried Alice; but Pamela shook her
head and smiled very nicely as she took my arm.
“No, that's for me,” she said. a tº
A TRAGEDY of THE SEA. . .
THE night was a very dark one, for a cold damp fog hung
over the Channel. The few lights we carried reflected
in-board only, and, leaning over the rail, it was with diffi-
culty that I could distinguish the dark waters washing
below. Shore-ward I could see nothing, though I knew
that a good-sized town lay there.
I had soon had enough of the inclement night. Keeping
my feet with some difficulty upon the wet boards, I groped
my way to a door and, pushing it open, entered.
A strange scene met my gaze. A spruce man in the
uniform of a naval officer was seated at a table. Before
him stood a tall well-set-up young seaman. His dis-
hevelled head was hatless, but otherwise he looked trim,
and his garments fitted him better than a seaman's gar-
ments generally do. On each side of him stood an armed
guard.
“Have you anything to say for yourself?” asked the
officer sternly.
“No, Sir, only that I am innocent,” answered the man.
He held his head high, almost defiantly. I could not but
admire his courageous bearing, and yet there was an air of
unreality about the whole thing. I felt almost as if I were
dreaming it, but I knew that this was not a dream.
“The evidence against you is overwhelming,” said the
officer. “I have no alternative but to sentence you to
death. The sentence will be carried out at dawn. Remove
the prisoner.” -
The seaman took a step forward. For a moment he
seemed to be struggling with himself, anxious to speak, yet
forcing himself to silence. Then he bowed his head, and,
turning, placed himself between the guards and was marched
a Way.
†. officer sighed. “It's a bad business,” he said.
“He’s the best man I ever had on my ship.”
He was speaking to himself, and again I had that
strange sense of unreality, as indeed I well might, for this
was the Third Act of True to the Death, a melodrama in
the pavilion at the end of the pier.

right flank reported a totally different

In due course the matter came to the

WHAT is Master WINSTON doing?

For the R.A. exhibition ?
Is he Jacky-obin or anti 2
Is he likely to “go Fanti,”
Or becoming shrewd and canty?
Is he in disguise at Kovel,
Living in a moujik's hovel,
Making a tremendous novel?
Does he run a photo-play show 2
Or in sava indignatio
Is he writing for HoRATIo?
Fired by the divine afflatus
Does he weekly lacerate us,
Like a Juvenal rematus 2
As the great financial purist,
Will he smite the sinecurist
Or emerge as a Futurist?
Is he regularly sending
HAIG and BEATTY screeds unending,
Good advice with censure blending?
Is he º is he hoeing 2
Is he planting beet, or going
In for early 'tato-growing 2
Is he writing verse or prosing,
Or intent upon disclosing
Gifts for musical composing?
Is he lecturing to flappers?
Is he tunnelling with sappers?
Has he joined the U-boat trappers?
Or, to petrify recorders
Of events within our borders,
Has he taken Holy Orders ?
Is he well or ill or middling?
Is he fighting, is he fiddling 2–
He can't only be thumb-twiddling.
These are merely dim surmises,

Us to look for weird surprises,
Somersaults, and strange disguises.

No one can answer the question,
and I have not the pluck—being a
law-abiding citizen—to try for myself.
But I do so want to know. I ask
everyone. I ask my partners at dinner

ask casual acquaintances. I would ask
the officials themselves, only they are
so preoccupied. But the words cer-
tainly set up a very engrossing problem,
and upon this problem many minor
problems depend, clustering round it
like chickens round the maternal hen.
But I should be quite content with an
answer only to the hen; the rest could
wait. Yet there is an inter-dependence
between them that cannot be over-
looked. For example, did someone once
do it and meet with such a calamity
that everyone else had to be warned 2
Or is it merely that the authorities dis-
like us to be comfy 2 Or is it thought
that the public might get so much
attracted by the habit as to convert

is in progress? I wish I knew these
things. - -
Will not some Member ask for in-
formation in the House, and then—
arising out of this question—get all
the other subsidiary facts? We are
told so many things that don't matter,
such as the enormous number of Min-
isters in the new Government, which
was formed, if I remember rightly, as
a protest against too large a Cabinet;
such as the colossal genius of each
and every performer in Mr. CochRANE's
theatrical companies; such as the best
place in Oxford Street to contract the
shopping habit; such as the breaks
made day by day all through the War
by billiard champions; such as the
departure of Mr. G. B. SHAw on his
bewildering and, one would think,
totally unnecessary visit to the Front
and his return from that experience;
such as-but enough. 'I am told by the
informative Press all these and more

BUNNY'S LITTLE BIT.
This scheme of keeping rabbits
To fatten them as food
Breaks up the kindly habits
Acquired in babyhood;
For we, as youthful scions,
Were taught to love the dears
And bring them dandelions
And lift them by the ears.
We learned how each new litter
That came to Flip or Fan
Grew finer and grew fitter
With tea-leaves in the bran;
We learned which stalks were milky
And which were merely to gh,
What grass was good for Silky
And what was good for Fluff.
Such moral mild up-bringing
Now makes me much distressed
When little necks need wringing
And little paws protest,
Lest wraiths from empty hutches
Should haunt me, hung in pairs,
And ghosts—'tis here it touches—
Of happy Belgian hares.
| However, with my morals
I manfully shall cope,
And back my country's quarrels,
But none the less I hope
Before poor Bunny's taken
As stuff for knife and fork
The hedge-hog will be bacon,

ES S E N C E OF P A R L | A M E N T.
Monday, February 19th-The CHAN-
CELLOR of THE ExchEQUER announced
that the “new money" subscribed for
the War Loan amounted to at least
seven hundred millions. Being a mod-
est man he refrained from saying, “A
loan, I did it,” though it was largely
due to his faith in the generosity and
good sense of his fellow-citizens that
the rate of interest was not more oner-
ous to the State.
Mr. LYNch thinks it would be a good
idea if Ireland were specially repre-
sented at the Peace Conference, in
order that her delegates might assert
I dare
her right to self-government.
say, if pressed, he would be prepared
to nominate at least one of her repre-
sentatives. Having regard to the
Nationalist attitude towards military
service Mr. BALFour might have re-
torted that only belligerents would be
represented at the Peace Conference,
but he contented himself with a simple
negative.
There is an erroneous impression that
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE sits in his private
room scheming out new Departments
and murmuring like the gentleman in
the advertisement of the elastic book-
| are singularly alike.

case, “How beautifully it grows!” Up
to the present, however, there are only
thirty-three actual Ministers of the
Crown, not counting such small fry
as Under-Secretaries, and their salaries
merely amount to the trifle of £133,500.
It is pleasant to learn that a branch of
the Shipping Controller's department
is appropriately housed in the Lake
Dwellings in St. James's Park; and, in
view of Mr. KING's objection that the
members of the Secret Service with
whom he has come into contact make
no sort of secret about their business
(one pictures them confiding in this
gentleman), it is expected that the
Board of Works will shortly comman-
deer a strip of Tube Railway to conceal
them in.

begins by carefully taking off his glasses
and so giving himself an extra moment
or two to frame a telling reply.
This afternoon Mr. MACPHERSoN's
spectacles were on and off half-a-dozen
times as he withstood an assault
directed from various quarters against
the refusal of the War Office to admit
the profession of “manipulative sur-
gery" to the Army Medical Service.
In vain he was informed of wonderful
cures effected by this means on generals
and admirals, and even members of the
Government; in vain Mr. LYNCH sought
from him an admission that the life of
one private soldier was more valuable
than that of the two Front Benches
put together.
manipulative surgery quite failed to
reduce Mr.
to intervene to stop the treatment.
The persistence with which a little
knot of Members below the Gangway

peace, and that it is only the insatiate |
ambition of the Allies which stands
in the way, would be pathetic if it
were not mischievous.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mr. TREvelyAN, and Mr. SNowdes once
more argued this hopeless case with a
good deal of varied ability. A small
house listened politely, but was more
impressed by a masterly exposé of the
facts by Mr. RoNALD M'NEILL, and
an Imperialist slogan by Sir HAMAR
GREEN wood; while later in the debate
Mr. BonAR LAw restated the national
aims in the War with a cogency that
drew from Mr. SAMUEL a generous
pledge “on behalf of those who sit
opposite the Government” to give
Ministers their whole-hearted support.
Wednesday, February 21st.—The
House learned with satisfaction that
crews of our river gun-boats in Meso-
potamia are to get their hard-lying
money; and when the authors of the
Turkish communiqués hear of it they
are expected to put in a similar claim.
Lord FISHER was in his customary
place over the Clock—his friends all
tell us that he is superior to Time;
Lord BERESFORD was at a suitable—
I had almost said respectful—distance
from him in the Peers' Gallery; and
conspicuous among the Distinguished
Strangers was Sir John JELLIcoe.
They and all of us listened intently
while for over an hour Sir Edward
CARSoN, now as much at home on the
quarter-deck as ever he was at quarter
sessions, discoursed eloquently and
frankly on the wonderful and never-
ending work of the Senior Service. .
He did not underestimate the dan-
ger of the submarines, or pretend that
the Admiralty had yet discovered any
sovran remedy for their attacks. Nor
could he say — for reasons which
seemed to satisfy the House — how
many of them had already been cap-
tured or sunk. But he told us enough
to convict Admiral voN CAPELLE, who
was at that moment declaring that not
a single U-boat had been lost since the
opening of the new campaign, of being
either singularly misinformed or highly
imaginative.
Thursday, February 22nd.—A strange
sympathy seems to exist between the
SPEAKER and Mr. GINNELL. Each, I
fancy, has a soft spot somewhere.
Mr. LowTHER's is in his heart, and
makes him go out of his way to
help the wayward Member for North
Westmeath. Mr. GINNELL, whose soft
spot seems to be higher up, wanted to
show that he did not approve of Mr.
MACPHERSoN, and called him an im-
pertinent Minister. Ordered to with-
draw the expression, he substituted
“impudent.” That would not do
either, and there seemed danger of a
deadlock and another expulsion until
Mr. LowTHER suggested that “incor-
rect " was a Parliamentary epithet
which might suit the hon. Member's
t tow\º-
Rºwan
The Big 'Un. “My DEAR FELLow !
Is IT REALLY TRUE THAT You HAve. To Join UP 2"
The Little ' Un. “YFs; BUT DON'T LET IT GET ABouT.
SPRING IT on THE GERMANs, As IT were, IN MARCH.”
YoU see, THE IDEA Is To
purpose. Mr. GINNELL handsomely
accepted this variation in the spirit in
which it was offered.
*Sir GEORGE CAVE is the Ministerial
maid-of-all-work. Whenever there is
a disagreeable or awkward measure to
introduce it falls to the Quite-at-Home
Secretary, if I may borrow an expression
coined by my friend, Toby, M.P., for
one of Sir GEORGE's predecessors. So
judiciously did he accentuate the good
points and soften the possible asperities
of the National Service Bill that even
Sir CHARLEs Hobhouse, who had come
to condemn, remained to bless.
Friday, February 23rd.—Owing to a
variety of causes, we are short of ton-
nage, and unless we manage to grow
more and consume less we shall before
very long be within reach of the gaunt
finger of Famine. That was the bur-
den of the PRIME MINISTER's appeal to
the Nation: . The farmer is to have a
guaranteed minimum price for his pro-
duce, the agricultural labourer is to be
raised to comparative affluence by a
minimum wage of 25s. a week, and the
rest of us are to go without most of our
imported luxuries and a good many
necessities. So impressed were Mem-
bers by the gloominess of the prospect
that the moment the speech was over
they rushed out to secure what they
felt might be their last really substan-
tial luncheon, and Mr. DAVID MAson,
who had nobly essayed to fill the breach
caused by Mr. Asquith's absence, was
soon talking to empty benches.

AcRobAT, HAVING BEEN OFFICIALLY INFORMED THAT HE BELONGS TO ONE OF THE NoN-Essex TIAL PROFESSIONS, DETERMINES
NEVERTHELESS TO DEVOTE HIS TALENT TO THE CAUSE OF HIS SUFFERING FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN. -
THE COMPLIMENT.
WE all know the man with a griev-
ance and avoid him. But there is
another man with a grievance whom
I rather like, and this is his story. I
must, of course, let him tell it in the
first-person-singular, because otherwise
what is the use of having a grievance
at all? The first-person-singular narra-
tive form is the grievance's compensa-
tion. Listen.
“I am an old Oxonian who joined
the Royal Naval Division as an ordi-
nary seaman not long after the outbreak
| of the War, and being perhaps not too
physically vigorous and having a certain
rhetorical gift, developed at the Union,
I was told off, after some months' train-
ing, to take part in a recruiting cam-
paign. We pursued the usual tactics.
First a trumpeter awakened the neigh-
bourhood, very much as Mr. HAwTREY
is aroused from his coma in his delight-
ful new play, and then the people drew
round. One by one we mounted what-
ever rostrum there was—a drinking
fountain, say—and spoke our little
piece, urging the claims of country.
“As a rule the audience was either
errand-boys, girls or old men; but we
did our best.
“Sometimes, however, there would
be an evening meeting in a public
building, and then the proceedings.
were more formal and pretentious."
The trumpeter disappeared and a
chairman would open the ball. The
occasion of which I am thinking was
one of these meetings in the East,
End, where the Chairman was a local
tradesman. He said that this was a
war for liberty and that England could
never sheathe the sword until Belgium
was free; he told the audience how
many of his relations were fighting;
and then he made way for our gallant
boys in blue who were to address the
company. . |
“Well, we addressed the company,
I by no means the least of the orators,
and then the Chairman wound up the
meeting. He said how much he had
enjoyed the speeches and how much
he hoped that they would bear good
fruit; and indeed he felt confident
of that, because ‘we 'ere in the East
End are plain straight-forward folk,
who like plain straight-forward talk,
and we would rather listen to the
honest 'omely sailors who 'ave been
talking to us this evening than any
fine Oxford gentleman.’”
That is the story of my friend with
a grievance. And yet, now I come to
think about it again, and his manner
of telling it, I'm not sure I ought
not rather to call him a man with a
triumph.

THE MAMMAL-SAURIAN WAR.
A PARABLE of GERMANY's ColoniEs.
LoNG ages ere the Age of Man,
While yet this earthly crust was
thinnish,
The War of Might and Right began,
Proceeding swiftly to a finish;
And this provides in many ways
An object-lesson nowadays.
The Saurians, clad in coats of mail,
Shone with a most attractive lustre;
Strong claws, long limbs, a longer tail—
They pinned their faith to bulk and
bluster;
They laid their eggs in every land
And hid them deftly in the sand.
The Mammals, small as yet and few,
Relying less on scales and muscles,
Developed diaphragms, and grew
Non-nucleated red corpuscles;
They walked more nimbly on their legs
And learnt the art of sucking eggs.
The Saurians, spoiling for a fight,
Went off in high explosive fashion;
They lashed themselves to left and right
Into a pre-historic passion;
The Mammals, on the other hand,
Ate all their eggs up in the sand.
Those precious eggs, a source of pride
On which the Saurian hopes de-
pended,
Kept all their enemies supplied
With life by which their own was
ended; -
And where they fondly hoped to spread
The Mammals lived and throve instead.
And so the Saurians passed from view,
Leaving behind the faintest traces,
No longer bent on hacking through,
Though looking still for sunny places;
Dwarfed to a more convenient size
They spend their time in catching flies.

“Yes, they want something they can bite into, you

“But you can't bite into our beefsteak, now can you?”
“Perhaps not,” I said, “but you can't help feeling it's
there, which is a great help when you're being rationed.”
“That,” she said, “may be all very well for a man, but
women don't care for that feeling. They like their food
light but stimulating." º -

I've already said they never lay eggs even when you don't

“Anyhow,” she said, “I should like him to know that
we're pulling up the herbaceous border and planting it with
potatoes, and that we've started keeping hens, and that
we've already got one egg, and that when the time comes
we shall not lack for chicken, roast or boiled.”
“Francesca,” I said, “how can you allude so flippantly to
the tragedies which are inseparable from the possession of
Buff Orpingtons? In the morning a young bird struts
about in his pride, resolved to live his life fearlessly and to
salute the dawn at any and every hour before the break of
day. Then something happens: a gardener, a family man
not naturally ruthless, comes upon the scene; there is a
short but terrible struggle; a neck (not the gardener's) is
wrung, and there is chicken for dinner.” *
“Don't move me,” she said, “to tears, or I shall have to
countermand your egg. Besides, I don't think I could ever

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
| War and the Future (CAssell), by Mr. H. G. WELLs, is
not a sustained thesis but just jets of comment and flashes
of epigram about the War as he has seen it on the French,
Italian and British fronts, and has thought about it in
peaceful Essex. A characteristic opening chapter, “The
| Passing of the Effigy,” suggests that “the Kaiser is perhaps
the last of that long series of crowned and cloaked and
semi-divine personages which has included Caesar and
Alexander and Napoleon the First—and Third. In the
| light of the new time we see the emperor-god for the guy
he is.” Generalissimo JoFFRE, on the other hand, he found
to be a decent most capable man, without fuss and flummery,
doing a distasteful job of work singularly well. There is
some particularly interesting matter about aeroplane work,
and the writer betrays a keen distress lest the cavalry
notions of the soldiers of the old school should make them
put their trust in the horsemen rather than the airmen in the
break-through. As for “tanks,” he offers the alternative
of organised world control or a new warfare of mammoth
landships, to which the devastation of this War will be
merely sketchy; but I doubt if he quite makes his point
here. And finally this swift-dreaming thinker proclaims a
vision which he has seen of a new world-wide interrelated
republicanism founded on a recognition of the over-lordship
of God . . . You put the book down feeling you have had
a long, desultory and intimate conversation with a very
interesting fellow-traveller.
Really, if Mr. Robert HICHENs continues his present
spendthrift course, whatever Board controls the consump-
tion of paper will have to put him on half rations. I
believe that his literary health would benefit enormously
by such a régime. This was my first thought in contem-
plating the almost six hundred pages of In the Wilderness
(METHUEN), and it persists, strengthened now that I have
turned the last of them. Hele is a direct and moving
tragedy of three lives, much of the appeal of which is lost
in a fog of superfluous words. Of its theme I will tell you
only this, that it shows the contrasting loves, material and
physical, of two widely divergent types of womanhood.
Probably human nature, rather than Mr. HichENs, should
be blamed for the fact that the unmoral Cynthia is many
times more interesting than the virtuous but slightly
fatiguing Rosamund. The former is indeed far the most
vital character in the tale, a figure none the less sinister
for its clever touch of austerity. Possibly, however, her
success is to some extent due to contrast; for certainly both
Rosamund and Dion, the husband whom she alienated by
her unforgiving nature, embody all the worst characteristics
of Mr. Hiche N's creations. Perhaps you know what I mean.
Chiefly it is a matter of super-sensibility to surroundings,
which renders them so fluid that often the scenery seems
to push them about. It is this, coupled with the author's
own lingering pleasure in a romantic setting, that delays
the conflict, which is the real motive of the book, over long.
But once this has come to grips the interest and the skill
of it will hold you a willing captive to Mr. Hich ENs at his
best.

I read a happier or more holding story. The title is a
punning one, as the heroine's name is really Margaret Pye,
but I am more than willing to overlook this for the sake of
the pleasantly-drawn young woman to whom it refers and
the general interest of the tale. Briefly, this has two move-

of Miss OLIVE WADSLEY's story, sufficiently indicated by
its title, does not admit of humorous relief. But it is
both vigorous and vital. Certainly it seemed hard luck on
Charles Ley that, after heroically curing himself of the
drug habit, he should marry the girl of his choice only to
find her a victim to strong drink. But of course, had
this not happened, the “punch " of Miss WADSLEY's tale
would have been weakened by half. Do not, however, be
alarmed; the author knows when to stop, and confines her
retrospective, and concerned with the mystery of a wonder- awful examples to these two, thereby avoiding the error of

quaint personal touch, which (to

the case of The New Europe

pleted volume lies before me, is
exceptional. In thirty years' ex-
perience of journalism I never
remember a paper containing so
much “meat”—some of it pretty

to its size. In hardly a single

example, that Austria est delenda may prove the only or the
best prescription for bringing freedom to the Jugo-Slavs of
South-Eastern Europe), but they always furnish the reader
with the facts enabling him to test their conclusions; and
that in these times is a great merit. My own feeling is that
if they had begun their concerted labours a few years earlier
the War might never have happened; or at least we should
have gone into it with a much more accurate notion of the

of quickly defeating them. The tragedies of Serbia and

The Proprietors believe that the public will prefer
an increase of price to a reduction of matter.

Punch may otherwise be unobtainable, the shortage

A ROMANCE OF RATIONS.
“Not like to like, but like in difference.”
“The Princess.”
I HAVE always misjudged Victorine
—I admit it now with shame. While
other girls have become engaged—and
disengaged quite soon after—she has
remained unattached and solitary. As
I watched the disappointed suitors turn
sadly away I put it down to pride and
self sufficiency, but I was wrong. I
see now that she always had the situa-
tion well in hand.
As for Algernon, he is the sort of man
who writes sonnets to lilies and butter-
flies and the rosy-fingered dawn —this
last from hearsay as he really knows
nothing about it. He is prematurely
bald and suffers from the grossest form
of astigmatism, and I thought that no
woman would ever love him. I never
dreamt that Victorine had even noticed
he was there.
One day I heard that they were en-
gaged. It was too hard for me to
understand.
On the third morning I went to see
her.
“Victorine,” I said, “you have never
loved before ?”
“Never,” she assented softly.
“Now, this man you have chosen—
you do not care overmuch for lilies and
butterflies and rosy-fingered dawns?”
“Not overnuch,” she admitted sadly.
“Then what is it brings you to-
gether? What strange link of the
spirit has been forged between you ?
To speak quite plainly, what do you
see in him 2 ”
“Yesterday we lunched together, and
two days before that he got here in
time for breakfast.”
“And the engagement still holds 2"
I am no optimist. -
“Before that we dined. Yes, I do
not exaggerate. It was my suggestion.
One sees so much unhappiness now-a-
days, and I wished to be quite sure we
were suited to one another."
“And you are convinced of the sin-
cerity of the attachment?”
“Why, I feel for him as Mother does
for the knife-and-boot boy, and Uncle
Stephen for the charlady. We cannot
be separated. It would be monstrous.”
I ceased to be articulate. Victorine
suddenly became radiant.
“We must always be together—at
any rate for the duration of the War,
you see. I eat under my meat and he
is over. In flour and sugar—oh, how
can I confess it?—I erceed. He is far,
far below his ration. Apart we are
failures; together we are perfect. We
both saw it at once.”
I realised suddenly the inevitability
of this mutual bond.
“So marriage is the only thing?” I
asked; but I was already conquered.
She assented with a regal air.
As I went away I saw a new and
strange beauty in the problem of Food
Shortage.
SONGS OF FOOD PRODUCTION.
IV.
THE FARMER's Boy (NEw STYLE).
THE Hun was set on making us fret
For lack of food to eat,
When up there ran a City man
In gaiters trim and neat—
“Oh, just tell me if a farm there be
Where I can get employ,
To plough and sow for PROTH-ER-o,
And be a farmer's boy,
And be a farmer's boy.
“In khaki dight my juniors fight—
I wish that I could too;
But since the land's in need of hands
There's work for me to do;
Though you call me a “swell,' I would
labour well—
I'm aware it's not pure joy—
To plough and sow for PROTH-ER-o
And be a farmer's boy,
And be a farmer's boy.”
The farmer quoth, “I be mortal loth,
But the farm 'tis goin' back,
And I do declare as I can't a-bear
Any farming hands to lack;
So if you've got grit and be middlin' fit
An 'll larn to cry, ‘Uthoy!'
And to plough and sow for PROTH-ER-o,
You shall be a farmer's boy,
You shall be a farmer's boy."
Bold farmers all, obey the call
Of townsfolk game and gay!
And you City men put by the pen
And hear me what I say:-
Get straight enrolled with a farmer bold,
And the Hun you'll straight annoy,
If you plough and sow for PROTH-ER-o
And be a farmer's boy,
And be a farmer's boy.

“THING's You HAVE GOT To Do WITHOUT.
CLOTHES AND Food.”
Daily Sketch.
This seems to bring the War even
closer than the PREMIER intended.
MORE OR LESS.
THE fleet of Dutch merchantmen
which has been sunk by a waiting
submarine sailed, it now appears,
under a German guarantee of “relative
security”; and the incident has been
received in Holland with a widespread
outburst of relative acquiescence. Ger-
many, in the little ingenious arrange-
ments that she is so fond of making
for the safety and comfort of her neigh-
bours, is so often misunderstood. It
should be obvious by this time that
her attitude to International Law has
always been one of approximate rever-
ence. The shells with which she bom-
barded Rheims Cathedral were con-
tingent shells, and the Lusitania was
sunk by a relative torpedo.
Neutrals all over the world who are
smarting just now under a fresh mani-
festation of Germany's respective good-
will should try to realise before they
take any action what is the precise
situation of our chief enemy. He has
(relatively) won the War;
he has
(virtually) broken the resistance of the
Allies; he has (conditionally) ample
supplies for his people; in particular,
he is (morally) rich in potatoes. His
finances at first sight appear to be
pretty heavily involved, but that will
soon be adjusted by (hypothetical) in-
demnities; he has enormous (propor-
tional) reserves of men; he has (theoreti-
cally) blockaded Great Britain, and his
final victory is (controvertibly) at hand.
But his most impressive argument,
which cannot fail to come home to
hesitating Neutrals, is to be found in
his latest exhibition of offensive power,
namely, in his (putative) advance upon
the Ancre.

Mr. William Wood, grocer, of Acton,
was very tired. And no wonder, for
not only had he lost his two assistants,
both having been called up, but the
girls who had taken their places were
frivolous and slow. Moreover his errand
boy had that day given notice. And,
furthermore, the submarine campaign
was making it every day more difficult
to keep up the stock, and the rise in
prices meant anything but the com-
mensurate increase of profit of which

himself into their careers with so much
sympathy and keenness. The first is

To the Right Hon. H. H. Asquith, M.P.
MY DEAR Asquith, This is only a
line to remind you that you lunch with
me at the Primrose Club on Monday
at one o'clock. I have asked two or
three friends to meet you, all good
fellows. With regard to that matter
on which you were asking my advice, I
think that the wisest course at present this morning's Times. You have never
he was accused by indignant
customers.
Mr. Wood, therefore, was
not sorry when, the shutters
up, he could retire to his
sitting-room upstairs and
rest. His one hobby being
reading, and his favourite
form of literature being
Lives and Letters, he had
normally no difficulty in dis-
missing the shop from his
mind. He would open the
latest memoir from the
library and lose himself in
whatever society it recon-
structed, political for choice.
But to-night the solace
could not so easily be found.
For one thing, he had no
new books; for another, the
cares of business were too
recent and too real.
He sank into his arm-
chair, covered his eyes with
his hand, and pondered.
Then suddenly he had
an idea. If there were no
letters of the Great to read,
he would himself write to
the Great and thus escape
grocerdom and worry. If
he were not a person of
importance, he would at
least pretend to be, and
thus be comforted.
Seating himself at the table and
taking up his pen, he composed with
infinite care the following chapter from
a biography of himself:-
The year 1916 was a comparatively
uneventful one in the life of our hero.
The principal events were the marriage
of his youngest daughter with the son
of the Bishop of Brighton and the re-
building of The Towers after the fire.
Perhaps the most important of his new
friends were the Archbishop of CANTER-
BURY and Sir HEdworth MEUx, but
unfortunately Sir HEDworth has not
kept any of the letters. Nor is there
much correspondence; but a few letters
may be printed here, all testifying to

markable man, who not only knew

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE watch Dogs.
LVII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, St. John, in
1914 a light-hearted lieut., advancing
and retiring with his platoon as an all-
seeing Providence or a short-spoken
Company Commander might direct, and
in 1915 a Brass-hat with a vast amount
of knowledge and only a hundred buff
slips or so to write it down on, is now
Second in Command of his regiment.
IIe tells me he is encamped with his
little lot on the forward slope of a
muddy and much pitted ravine. On
the opposite slope are some nasty
noisy guns, and at the bottom of the
ravine are the cookers.
When, after much forethought, he has
found something to do and has begun
doing it, there is a cry of “Stand clear!”
and, with that prudence which even an
Englishman will learn if you do not
hustle him but give him a year or two
to find by experience that care should
sometimes be taken, all get to earth.
The guns fire ; the neighbourhood
heaves and readjusts itself, and a man
may then come out again. By the time,
however, he has collected his senses
and his materials there is another
“Stand clear !” and back he must go
to earth. This is what is technically
known as Rest.
It was not good enough for one of
the battalion cooks. No man can do
justice to a mess of pottage by lying
on his belly at a distance and frowning
at it. After many movements to and fro,
he eventually said be damned to guns
and “Stand clears; " stood on the top
of his cooker (there was nowhere else
to stand), and, holding a dixie lid in
his hand and bestowing on the con-
tents of the dixie that encouraging
smile without which no stew can stew,
defied all the artillery of the B.E.F. to
do its worst. It did.
The cook recovered to find himself
annong his dixies, frizzling pleasantly
and browning nicely in certain parts.
Even so, professional interests over-
came any feeling of personal injury.
Rising majestically, he stepped down
and advanced upon the nearest gun
crew. “Now you've done it, you
blighters!” he shouted, waving an
angry fist at them. “You've been
and gone and blown all the pork out
of the beans.”
The same man went on holiday to
the neighbouring town, which is in
reality an ordinarily dull and dirty pro-
vincial place, but to the tired warrior is
a haven of rest and a paradise of gaiety
and good things. Here he came into
contact with the local A.P.M. in the
following way. The latter was in his
oflico after lunch, brooding no doubt,
when in came a French policeman
greatly excited in French. There was,
it appeared, promise of a commotion at
the Hotel de Ville. A British soldier
had got mixed up in the queue of
honest French civilians who were wait-
ing outside for the delivery of their
legal papers. There were no bi-linguists
present, but it had been made quite
clear to the Britisher that he must go,
and it had been made quite clear by
the Britisher that he should stay.
Always outside the Hotel de Ville at
2.30 of an afternoon was this queue of
natives, each waiting his turn to be
admitted to the joyless sanctum of the
Commissaire, there to receive those
illegible documents without which no
French home is complete. Never before
had a British soldier fallen in with
them, and, when requested to dismiss,
showed signs of being obstreperous.
The A.P.M. buckled on Inis Sam
Browne belt and prepared for the worst,
which he assumed to be but another
example of the frailty of human nature
when suddenly confronted with un-
accustomed luxuries. When he got to
his prey he found him not quite in the
state expected. Usually at the sight
of an A.P.M. a soldier, whatever the
strength of his case, will express regret,
promise reform, and make ready to
pass on. This one stood his ground ;
on no account would he leave the
queue. He explained to the A.P.M.
that he was too used to the manifold
and subtle devices of people who
wanted to snaffle other people's places
in queues. He was however quite pre-
pared to parley, and was only too glad
to find a fellow-countryman, speaking
the right language and having the right
sense of justice, to parley with.
He said he had taken his proper
place in the line, with no attempt to
hustle or jostle anyone else. He meant
to do no one any harm, and he was
prepared to pay the due price, in cur-
rent French notes, whatever it might
be. But having got his place by right
he refused to give it up to anyone else,
be he French or English, Field Officer
or even gendarme. He had been ex-
cessively restrained in resisting the un-
scrupulous attempts of the gendarme
to dislodge him. If he had made any
threat of knocking the gendarme down
he had not really intended to take that
course. The threat was only a formal
reply to the gendarme's proposal to
stick a sword through his middle.
He was, he said most emphatically,
not drunk. If the A.P.M., in whom he
had all confidence, would occupy his
place in the queue and keep it for him,
he would demonstrate this by a prac-
tical test. In any case he ventured to
insist on his point. Without claiming
any special privileges for a man fight-
ing (and cooking) for his country, he
claimed the right of any human being,
whatever his nationality, to witness
any cinema show which might be in
progress.
The underlying good qualities of both
nations were evidenced in the sequel.
When the A.P.M. had interpreted the
matter the gendarme insisted on an
embrace, and the cook permitted it.
Later, I have reason to believe, they
witnessed a most moving cinema play
together, but not in the Commissaire's
office at the Hotel de Ville.

“The reason it doesn't rain,” said
the guinea-fowl, “is that the barometer
is very high.”
But no one listened to her.
“The reason is,” said the duck with
the black wings, “that the pond is
nearly empty. When the pond is empty
it doesn't rain.”
“It's the hen-house,” said the black
hen. “Whenever the roof drips there
is rain.”
“It is certainly the hen-house,” said
all the hens. e
“It comes from the trees,” said the
turkey. “The leaves drip and then
there is rain, and the more they drip
the heavier it rains.”
“It is my kennel,” chuckled Bruno,
the wise old dog. “The more it leaks
the more it rains."
At that very moment it began to
rain in torrents.
“The pond is full,” quacked the
ducks. “Look at the pond.”
“Oh, do look at the hen-house roof
—dripping !” shrieked the hens.
“The leaves—look at the leaves,”
gurgled the turkeys.
“And my kennel leaks. I can feel it
on my back,” chuckled Bruno.

said the guinea-fowl.

THE SONG OF THE MILL.
[Most of our water-mills have fallen into decay and disuse owing to
the unsuitability of their machinery to grind imported grain. Will
the revival of English grain production bring about a renewal of their
usefulness?]
As by the pool I wandered that lies so clear and still
With tall old trees about it, hard by the silent mill
Whose ancient oaken timbers no longer creak and groan
With roar of wheel and water, and grind of stone on stone,
The idle mill-race slumbered beneath the mouldering wheel,
The pale March sunlight gilded no motes of floating meal,
But the stream went singing onward, went singing by the
weir—
And this, or something like it, was the song I seemed to
hear :—
“By Teviot, Tees and Avon, by Esk and Ure and Tweed,
Here's many a trusty henchman would rally to your need;
By Itchen, Test and Waveney, by Tamar, Trent and Ouse,
Here's many a loyal servant will help you if you choose.
“Do they no longer need us who needed us of yore?
We stood not still aforetime when England marched to
Wal: ;
Like those our wind-driven brothers, far seen o'er weald
and fen, -
We ground the wheat and barley to feed stout Englishmen.
!"You call the men of England, their strength, their toil,
their gold,
But us you have not summoned, who served your sires of
old; - -
For service high or humble, for tribute great and small,
You call them and they answer—but us you do not call.
“Yet we no hoarded fuel of mine or well require,
That drives your fleets to battle or lights the poor man's
fire ;
We need no white-hot furnace for tending night and day,
No power of harnessed lightnings to speed us on our way.
“By Tavy, Dart and Derwent, by Wharfe and Usk and
Nidd,
Here's many a trusty vassal is yours when you shall bid,
With the strength of English rivers to push the wheels
along
And the roar of many a mill-race to join the victory song.”
- C. F. S.

famous lines—

without reliable news of FERDIE. But
it is rumoured that he is preparing to
conform to the general movement of
the Central Allied Powers, and is there-
fore taking a little gentle running exer-
cise in the Vulpedrome at Vienna.
“V.T.C.”—We rejoice with you that
already—not more than 24 years since
the revival of the Volunteer Force—
the War Office has recognised the
desirability of giving the Volunteer a
rifle to shoot with ; and it now seems
almost certain that he will receive one,
free of charge, before the conclusion of
peace. We welcome this wise and
generous decision, for though we have
never pretended to be a military
authority we have always held the
view that in a tight corner a man with
a rifle has an appreciable advantage
over an unarmed man.
“ForTUNE-TELLER.”—Like you, we
are greatly impressed by the convincing
arguments advanced by our military
experts in support of the view that the
Germans are likely to put forth a great
effort this year at some point on one
of their fronts; and we share your
belief that the time has come when the
Government should supply a long-felt
want by establishing a Department of
Intelligent Anticipation. It is a happy
suggestion of yours to offer, for a rea-
sonable consideration, to place at the
disposal of such a Department your

hearing to the proposal of Mr. WING
that they should voluntarily submit
to the same restricted hours of con-
sumption as they had imposed on the
outside world. Mr. WING is a temper-
ance reformer, but on this occasion
he had the redoubtable assistance of
Mr. GEoRGE FABER, a stout friend of the
“trade” whose hair had grown white,
he declared (though in other respects
he still looks delightfully juvenile), in
fighting the Licensing Bill of 1908.
In his opinion the House could no
longer keep itself in a compartment
apart—especially as it was not a water-
tight compartment. Sir FREDERICK
BANBURY, who is naturally a champion
of cakes—and ale—made a despairing
effort to preserve the privileges of the
Palace of Westminster, but did not carry
his protest to a division; and after a
few valedictory remarks from Colonel
Lockwood, including two quotations
from LUCRETIUs (derived from a crib,
as he modestly explained), the House
unanimously decided that its habits
should be in conformity with its debates
—dry with moist intervals.
Thursday, March 1st. — Copies of
the unexpurgated edition of the Re-
port of the Dardanelles Commission
marked “confidential” are to be sent
to the SPEAKER and to the leader of
every political party in the House. If
Mr. BonAR LAw thought by this an-
nouncement to allay curiosity he was
disappointed. Requests for a definition
of the term “political party” rained
upon him from all quarters. It really
is a rather nice point. Mr. Asquith,
Mr. REDMond and Mr. WARDLE will, of
course, receive their copies of the editio
princeps. But what about Mr. WILLIAM
O'BRIEN, who commands a bare half-
section, even if one includes Mr. T. M.
HEALY as odd file 2 What, too, of the
Peace-without-Victory party, which is
all leaders ? The case of Mr. PRINGLE
and Mr. Hogg|E, which was publicly
mentioned, presents little difficulty.
Much as they love one another, neither
is prepared to acknowledge the other
as his leader.
The greatest crux is furnished by
Mr. GINNELL and Mr. PEMBERTON-
BILLING. Each of them leads a distinct
party, making up by its activity and
volubility for its comparative lack of
size. Logically they may look forward
to receiving copies of the “confidential”
document too sacred for the inspec-
tion even of Peers and Privy Council.

To lands renowned in classic story 2

And pretty often, I'll be bound,

While Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Betray the classicising mania.

As fine as Rome's of long ago;

Are names with us more often worn
Than in the lands where they were born.
Then, as true classicists to stamp us,

And we have Senators whose mien
Might well have turned old BRENNUs

Why even the Bird that proudly soars
In majesty to guard our shores
Before migrating to these regions
Was followed by the Roman legions.
But we have writ enough to show
What everybody ought to know,
That, spite of hustle and skyscrapers,
And Tammany and yellow papers,

Across the wide Atlantic foam.

PRIVILEGE.
Mr. Jenkins, junior partner in the
firm of Baldwin and Jenkins, antique
dealers, Wigpole Street, was in the
habit, on fine afternoons, of walking
home from business to his flat in the
Brompton Road.
He invariably chose the path which
runs parallel to Park Lane, just inside
the Park railings.
Being middle-aged and unmarried he
walked slowly and methodically, and
was careful, when he came level with
an entrance, to note the particular gates
marked “In " and “Out.” He would,
as he crossed the “Out" opening, look
sharply to the right, and as he passed
the “In " opening look sharply to the
left. “Safety first" was a creed with
him. -
One mild Spring afternoon, as he
was passing by an “Out" aperture,
with his whole attention fixed to the
right, he was aware, amid the sound of
motor-horns and shouts, that the road-
way had risen up and struck him on
the back of the neck, and that some-
thing like the Marble Arch had kicked
him at the same moment.
A week later Mr. Jenkins recovered
consciousness in a beautiful clean ward
of St. George's Hospital. A smiling
nurse stood by his bed and, as he tried
to sit up, she told him he must be quiet
and not disturb the bandages.
“Your friend Mr. Baldwin is coming
to see you to-day at two o'clock,” she
told him. “No, it is not serious; you
are out of danger. Now you have only
to be quiet; so when your friend comes
you mustn't talk too much.”
He lay still and thought, and it
all came back to him. “But, good
heavens !” was his reflection, “that car
must have come in by the “Out' gate!
In that case,” he continued, not with-
out pleasure, “I can claim damages—
very severe damages too.”
At two o'clock Mr. Baldwin, his
grey-bearded friend and partner, en-
tered. “Well, Jenkins,” said he, “I’m
glad to see you've turned the corner.
You've had rather a narrow squeak.”
Mr. Jenkins looked at his friend for
a moment. “Look here,” he said,
“I’m not allowed to speak much, but
did you know that that car, when it
struck me, was coming in through an
‘Out' gate, and, as that can be proved,
don't you see that I can get pretty
good compensation ?”
His friend's face remained solemn.
“I fear not,” he said.
“But I must,” said Jenkins. “It’s
as clear as can be. Scores of people
must have seen it.”
Mr. Baldwin shook his head horizon-
tally.
Old Lady (ruminating). “WHAT A Poor

“Heavy damages,” said Mr. Jenkins,
“I repeat.”
“I’ve gone into it,” his partner re-
plied, “and it's hopeless.”
“Why?" asked the sick man.
“I’ll tell you,” said Mr. Baldwin.
“Because that car belonged to the
Duke of Mudcaster.”
“The more reason,” said Mr. Jenkins,
“for heavy damages. Very heavy. The
Duke's rolling.”
“Maybe he rolls,” said Mr. Baldwin.
“But that is not all. Listen. The
Duke of Mudcaster is the only repre-
sentative of the Pennecuiks, whose
founder had the good fortune to be of
some service to KING WILLIAM III.
For this service he and his posterity
were allowed the privilege of entering
places by gates marked “Out' and
leaving by gates marked “In.”
Mr. Jenkins sat half up, groaned and
subsided again. He said nothing.
“Well, I must say good-bye now,”
said Mr. Baldwin. “Sorry I've de-
pressed you about compensation, but
you never had an earthly. See you
again soon. So long.”
For some minutes Mr. Jenkins re-
mained as one stunned. Then he began
to think again. “I wonder,” he said
once or twice, for he knew his partner,
—“I wonder. Could it have been

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(The German KAIs ER and a wounded Belgian Officer,
a Prisoner.)
The Kaiser. So, then, you are still in arms against me,
still persisting in your insane desire for battle and blood-
shed 2 Will nothing content you? Must you compel us
to continue in our enmity when by a word peace might be
established between us, and Belgium might take her place
at the side of Germany as a sister-nation striving with us
to promote the cause of true civilisation ?
The Belgian. It is useless, Sir, to say such things to any
Belgian.
The Kaiser. Why useless? Do you not wish that death
and ruin and misery should cease?
The Belgian. Certainly we do. No one more ardently
than the Belgians, for it was not we who desired war or
began the contest. But when you talk of stopping we
must remind you that it was by your deliberate choice that
war was treacherously forced on us. What could we do
except defend ourselves against the dastardly blow that
you aimed at our life? And after that it was not by us
that Louvain was destroyed, that old men and women and
children were ruthlessly massacred. Do you think such
scenes can be wiped out of the memory of a nation, so
that her men shall turn round and kiss the bloodstained
hand that has tried to throttle them 2 Surely you expect
too much.
The Kaiser. You speak too freely. Remember in whose
presence you are.
The Belgian. There is not much fear that I shall forget.
I am in the presence of one who has desired at all costs
to concentrate on himself the gaze of the world, caring
nothing as to the means by which he accomplished his
object. This man, for he is, after all, only a poor human
creature prone to anger, suspicion and foolish jealousy—
this man has always gone about arrogating to himself the
attributes of a god, calling upon his own people to worship
him, and on all other peoples to be humble before him.
Stung by his own restless vanity and the servile applause
of those who are ever ready to prostrate themselves before an
Emperor, he has rushed hither and thither seeking to make
others the mere foils of his splendour and his wisdom,
making mischief wherever he went and striving to irritate
and depress his neighbours. This man in peace was a
bad neighbour, and in war a base and treacherous foe,
sanctioning by his enthusiastic approval such deeds as the
meanest villain would have contemplated with shame.
The Kaiser. This is too much. I gave you leave to
speak, but not to revile me. You must not forget that you
are in my power. -
The Belgian. A noble threat ' But it is right and proper
that men like you, who think they are infallible because
their cringing flatterers tell them so, should sometimes hear
the truth. You dare, forsooth, to talk to a Belgian of your
magnanimity and your desire for peace. Cannot you realise
that our nation has been tempered by outrage and ruin;
that exile and the ruthless breaking of their homes only
serve to make its men and women more resolute; that even
if others were to cease fighting against you, and if her
sword were broken, Belgium would dash its hilt in your
face till breath and life were driven out of her mangled
body; that, in short, we hate you for your cruelty and
despise you for your baseness; and that for the future,
wherever there is a Belgian, there is one who is the enemy
of the thing called KAISER.
The Kaiser. Enough, enough. I did not come here to be
insulted. If you have suffered, you and your nation, it is
because you have deserved to suffer for having dared to set
yourself against Germany, whom our good old German god
has appointed to lead the way in righteousness to the goal
marked out for her. -
The Belgian. Sir, when you speak like that you are no
doubt a marvel in your own eyes, but to others you are a
laughing-stock, a mere scare-crow dressed up to resemble a
man, a thing of shreds and patches to whom for a time the
inscrutable decrees of Providence have permitted a dreadful
power. But we are resolute to endure to the end, and your
blandishments will avail as little as your threats.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT is strange to find the inexhaustible Mr. W. E. Norris
turning towards the supernatural. Yet there is at least
more than a flavouring of this in the composition of Brown
Amber (HUTCHINsoN), which partly concerns a remarkable
bead, having the property of bringing good or evil luck to
its various owners. As (after the manner of such things
in stories) the charm was for ever being lost, and as the
kind of fortune it conferred went in alternations, possession
of it was rather in the nature of a gamble. All I have to
observe about it is that such hazards consort somewhat
better with the world of HANS ANDERSEN or the Arabian
Nights than with those quiet and well-bred inhabitants of
South-Western London whom one has learnt to associate
with the name of Norris. Thus, in considering the nice
problem of whether Clement Drake (as typical a Norrisian
as ever buttoned spats) would or would not escape the
entanglements of Mrs. D'Esterre, it simply irritated me to
suppose that the event might be determined by the machina-
tions of djins. In a word, East is East and S.W. is S.W.,
and never the twain shall, or should, be mixed up in a
novel that pretends to anything more serious than burlesque.
I am not sure also that, for different reasons, I did not
regret the introduction of the War; though as a grand
climax it has, I admit, a lure that must be almost irresist-
ible to the novelist. For the rest, if you do not share my
objection to the (dare I say it?) amberdexterity of the plot,
you will find Mr. NorBIs as pleasant as ever in his scenes
of drawing-room comedy.
A volume of remarkable interest is In Ruhleben (HURST
AND BLACKETT), into which Mr. Dougi,As SLADEN has
gathered a variety of information concerning the life of the
English civilian prisoners in Germany, its many hardships
and few ameliorations. The greater part of the book is
filled with a series of letters sent by one of these prisoners
to his mother. Perhaps (one suspects) the writer of these
was not altogether an ordinary young man. From what-
ever reason, the fact remains that his letters are by no
means uncheery reading; his books and study, most of all
his friendships (with one fellow-captive especially), seem
to have kept him contented and even happy. Of course
some part of this may well have been coloured for the
maternal eye; it is clear that he was greatly concerned
that she should not be too anxious about him. A more
impartial picture of the conditions at Ruhleben is given in
the second part of the volume, and in a letter by Sir
TIMOTHY EDEN, reprinted from The Times, on The Case for
a wholesale Exchange of Civilian Prisoners. I should add
that the book is illustrated with a number of drawings of
Ruhleben made by Mr. STANLEY GRIMM, an artist of the
Expressionist School (whatever that may mean). These
are vigorous and arresting, if, to the unmodern eye, some-
what formless. But they are part of a record that all
Englishmen can study with quickened sympathy and a
great pride in the courage and resource of our race under
conditions needlessly brutal at their worst, and never
better than just endurable.
Nothing will ever persuade me that This Way Out
(METHUEN) is an attractive title for a novel, however

The book itself, however, is intriguing in spite of its
gloominess. The grandfather of Jane and John-Andrew
Vaguener committed a most cold-blooded murder—this
in a prologue. Then, when we get to the real story, we
find Jane tapping out popular fiction at an amazing
pace, and her brother, John-Andrew, living on the pro-
ceeds thereof. Jane is noisy, vulgar, and successful in
her own line, and gets on John-Andrew's nerves; and when
he discovers that she has for once turned aside from tawdry
fiction and written a play that is really good he decides
that he can stand it and her no longer. While she was
pouring out literary garbage he could just manage to endure
his position, but the thought that she would be hailed as a
genius while he remained an utter failure was the final stroke
that turned him from a mendicant into a madman. I am
not going to tell you exactly what happened, but Jane found
a “way out,” and with her departure from this life my

A NATIONAL SKY-SCRAPER.
I HAVE been often asked why the Govern-
ment, foreseeing the inevitable increase of
Departments, had not the elementary imagi-
nation to build a colossal sky-scraper to ac-
commodate them all.
The objections to such an act of apparently
obvious intelligence may be briefly enume-
rated.
(1) With such a landmark whoever had
business to conduct with a Government De-
partment would know where to find it, for
which reason alone the system of huts and
hotels is to be preferred. The hotels are
widely scattered and the huts hidden away in
comparison between the organization and
methods of his various Ministers.
These considerations alone finally dispose -
odd corners of public gardens and parks, and
even in the bed of a lake. By the use of
| motor-cars (petrol being for official and not for
private consumption) such co-operation as
cannot be avoided between Departments is
assured.
(2) Even in a single Department too close
co-operation is not desirable. An hotel, divided
into hundreds of smallrooms and flats, enables
the occupant of each room to be isolated, and
each self-contained flat to have almost the
status of a sub-department. Thus the vexa-
tious supervision, the easy intercourse and
rapid decision which are so disturbing to official
routine are avoided.
(3) The express elevators, by which the
visitor is shot up to the higher storeys of a
sky-scraper, would suggest a certain directness
and celerity in official methods that is calcu-
lated to arouse false hopes.
(4) With many or all Departments in one
building there would be the temptation to
place the entire clerical staff under Mr. Neville
Chamberlain as Director-General, who would
transfer then from one office to another accord-
ing to the necessities of each day's work.
Such mobility would be unpopular, while the
inevitable creation of a central Press-Bureau,
Publicity and Information Department would
| afford the Press a satisfaction that it has done
nothing to deserve.
(5) On the top floor of a sky-scraper is
usually a luncheon-club; here the various
Ministers would meet daily, and could only
with difficulty escape the exchange of ideas.
(6) If all Government offices were in a single
building the PRIME MINISTER could make daily
visits to each, and would find it hard to avoid
of any merits which the plan for a national
sky-scraper may seem superficially to possess.

A PAINFUL RUMoUR. *.
LAST week one of our representatives had
the honour of calling at the offices. of The
Spectator to inquire into the credibility of
certain strange rumours that have recently
been current in The Trade.
They were to the
effect that Mr. ST. Loe STRAcHEY, Editor of
The Spectator, having gallantly volunteered
under the National Service Scheme, had had
allotted to him, by one of the DIRECTOR-
GENERAL's subordinates, a post of national
importance at Messrs. Bassopp's Brewery.
Mr. STRACHEY’s fertile and forcible pen was
(so the rumour went) to be employed by this
firm in the drawing up of some pungent
advertisements under the headings, “The
Weakness of the Water Movement,” “Up,
Glasses " '' etc., including a verse series, in
Horatian alcoholics, entitled, “Bonnie D.T.”
It was reported that in the ironic circum-
stances in which he found himself, Mr.
STRACHEY felt it his duty to acquiesce loyally
in the change of view imposed upon him, and
to adopt a policy of “Down, Spectators'''
Our representative is happy to state that
he has the highest authority for giving an un-
qualified denial to these sinister allegations.

THE EVERLASTING ROMANCE.
THE other day I did a perfectly dreadful
thing: I intruded, all unconsciously but in
the most blundering way, on a love scene. It
was in the National Gallery, long famous as
the meeting-place of affinities, in the big room
where the pictures lent by the Duke of WEST-
MINSTER and the Duke of BUCCLEUCH are now
hanging, and before I knew it I found myself
standing between two young people whose eyes
were fixed on each other. Naturally I moved
away at once, but later I returned and made
so bold as to study them a little, for it was
clearly, if not yet a passion, a mutual interest
of such tender depths that no outsider could
affect it.
The boy—for he was no more—was one of
the most beautiful that I have ever seen. His
hair was perhaps a thought longer than we
encourage to-day, but one always sees odd

tures, and especially, perhaps, the modern
French examples from Sir HUGH LANE's col-
lection. His hair was the more noticeable
because he carried his hat in his hand; his
clothes were noticeable too, being a shade too
fanciful for London in winter—but then, who
cares how people dress in London 2 I am
sure I don't ; and especially so when they
have such eyes as this boy's, dark and rich,
and such a curve to such lips.
There he stood, perfectly still, his steady
gaze fixed on the lady opposite, while she
in her turn never wavered in her gaze upon
him. But whereas there was something bold

in his homage there was a half-shy way with
her. He was facing her squarely, but she
looked at him a little sideways, and a little
curiously, in demure dubiousness. One could
see that she was enormously intrigued, but her
interest was not expressed by any movement.
In fact neither moved ; they remained some
twenty yards apart all the time I observed
them : each, I suppose, leaving it to the other
—the boy because he was so young, the girl
because she was already woman, and woman
likes to force advances from man.
I never saw a prettier thing than the little
lady, with her cool white skin, and the faintest
flush on her cheeks, and her eyes not less
dark than the boy's but lacking the sensitive
depths of his.
The odd thing was that, although they
were so engrossed each in the other, both, I
observed, looked also at me. It struck me as
not the least strange part of this charming
drama that its hero and heroine, while com-
pletely absorbed in their own sympathetic
relationship, should be able to turn a calm
survey upon a stranger too. This gift made
them the more memorable and perhaps ex-
plains why, for all the rest of the day and
at intervals in the night and morning follow-
ing, I thought of these young people, specu-
lating as to how they were getting on; and
perhaps that is why, the next afternoon, drawn
by invisible wires, I found myself in the
National Gallery again.
Will you believe it?—they also were there.
This is an absolute fact. There they were,
exactly as I had left them. And yet, not ex-
actly, for I am certain that there was a hint
more of seriousness in the lady's glance and a
shade more troubled earnestness in his. But
as regards actual distance, they were still as
far apart, although certainly nearer in spirit.
Curiosity as to names is a foible which
should be, I am convinced, discouraged; but
on this occasion I could not resist the desire
to know more of such assiduous habitués.
Drawing one of the attendants aside, I asked
him if he could tell who these romantic young

“DoNNE un peu, Maman, s'il te plait,” said
Jeanne eagerly. -
Maman handed over the newspaper from
which she had just read aloud and explained
the passage so full of touching interest to them
both, and Jeanne, with help at the difficult
places, read out:—
“‘CITATIONs 2 L'ordre DU Jour.

grenadier d'élite, au cours des combats du 26
et du 27 movembre, 1916, a, par son mépris du
danger et par son ardeur, assure la progression
dans unboyau defendu pas d pas par l'ennemi.
Lc soldat Jacques Martin est Monsieur l'abbé
Martin, curé de —."
“Oui, mous savons bien d'où il est curé !"
cried Jeanne, in admiration and awe. “C'est
bien beau, hein, Maman?” Then suddenly
she became silent and thoughtful, remember-
ing the subsequent fate of her friend and hero.
“Dire qu'il est maintenant prisonnier en
Alle . . . en Bochie!", she said. They had
known long ago that he was mentioned in
despatches, and they had been on the look-out
for the glorious details in print, but only this
morning had they heard of his capture.
How proud they were of their gentle curé
and brave soldier! Jeanne had at first been
greatly perplexed by the strange dual person-
ality, with its incompatibilities, and many
were the questions that had arisen in her
active little mind. “Le curé de Suzanne,
c'est autre chose,” she reflected, for though
technically a soldier was he not a brancardier
rescuing the wounded? Her own practical
conclusions, however, and the answers to her
questions smoothed away many difficulties,
and perfect faith in her friend did the rest.
Still she had never been able quite to merge
the religieux and the poilu into one picture;
besides, she liked to play with the idea and
confront the one with the other. “Que va dire
Monsieur le curé lorsque le soldat tuera un
homme?” And she had slipped into the habit
A LEAN DAY.
of calling him “Mon soldat et mon curé,”
suddenly inspired to adapt the title of Cousin
Juliette's absorbing book, Mon Oncle et mon
Curé, and she refused to abandon it when told
that they were two separate persons. For that
matter so were the soldat and the curé.
“Maman, nous allons tout de suite préparer
son paquet de conforts,” urged Jeanne. And,
thinking out what comforts had best be in-
cluded in the parcel, her mind went off now in
one channel, now in another, as she pictured
the priest or the piou-piou. The latter pre-
sented no difficulty—for him good things to
eat were the first necessity—but the curé would
require spiritual comforts.
“Des livres de messe,” she said to herself;
and thereupon the image of the cold and
hungry soldier arose before her, and “un
ulet ou un bon bifteck | " she added. Then,
er eye lighting upon an advertisement in the
newspaper before her, “Maman, que veut dire
por-ta-tif 2 " she asked. The explanation re-
ceived, she clapped her hands with joy; yes,
surely a portable one was the very thing !
“Maman, si nous envoyions à mon curé un
autel por-ta-tif’ ” -
But Maman thought that, all things con-
sidered, it would be better to send only food
in the first parcel. So Jeanne reconciled
herself to the idea, although the curé still
remained a shadowy figure in the background
with his own especial need.
And prisoners were cold as well as hungry.
What a pity something hot could not be sent.
“Tiens! J'y suisſ" cried Jeanne. “Ö
Maman, j'ai une si bonne idée Si mous
envoyions un bon repas bien chaud dans
l'auto-cuiseur !” Perhaps it would keep hot
for a day or two. How long did it take for a
parcel to reach Bochief
But Maman decided this plan could not be
risked; there was often delay, and the moist
food might turn sour.
A little chilled but nowise daunted, for she
was sure the hay-box would come in somehow,
Jeanne remained for some time plunged deep
in thought. Then came light and her face
grew radiant. . Why not send the auto-cuiseur
filled with dry food? Les Boches would surely
give, or sell, some boiling water and let him
just start cooking on their stove. And he
would be able to use the cooker constantly,
buying des choses pas chéres to cook; and yes,
why not slip into the package a copy of Plats
économiques, the little cookery book whose
recipes they had found so satisfactory?
“Et mon curé?” But now the two figures
merged more nearly than ever before into one,
and Jeanne felt that his first need was one
with that of the soldier, and the marmite
would hold enough for both.
, “Maisoui,” she exclaimed, “c'est cela! . . .
Ecoute, Maman Envoyons l'auto-cuiseur
auz deuz . . . Ne vois-tu pas que mon soldat
pourra alors manger tous les jours un bon

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. .
Essence OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 5th.-General cheers greeted
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's announcement that the
Government of India had undertaken to pay
the interest on a hundred millions of war-debt,
but when he proceeded to say that part of the
new revenue required would be obtained by
an increase in the cotton duties there was a
notable cooling of enthusiasm among Members
from Lancashire. Mr. RUNCIMAN at once
sounded the alarm on behalf of Manchester
by asking if there would be a corresponding
excise duty on Indian cottons. “All India is
against it,” replied Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, who is
finding, as his father did before him, how
difficult it is to get Englishmen to “think
imperially" where their own particular trade
is concerned. '
There is no doubt that the Food CoNTROLLER
possesses a sense of judicial humour. Com-
plaints have been made of late that while the
ordinary British citizen was expected to confine
himself to four pounds of bread per week the
pampered German pris-
oner, instead of getting
less, was given nearly
three times that amount.
Lord DEvoNPoRT has now
approved a new dietary
scale for prisoners, under
which the bread ration
will be cut down to sixty-
three ounces, or just one
ounce less than the al-
lowance of the free and
independent Englishman.
On the Army Estimates
Mr. PRINGLE attacked the
Salonika Expedition with
a vigour which must have
greatly pleased the Buſºar.
By a curious lapse of mem-
ory, as Mr. CHURCHILI,
pointed out, he omitted
all reference to the posi-
tion of M. VENIzELos and
our honourable obliga-
tions to our Allies.
Mr. CHURCHILL was in-
deed more statesmanlike
than he has been of late,
His “amphibious inter-
vention” was on this occa- -
sion quite justified. There was good sense in his
warning that, while perseverance towards a
definite objective was a virtue, “perseverance
with an eye on the past” was an equally
serious vice; and I hope it signifies a deter-
mination on his part not to allow his brilliant
future to be all behind him.
Tuesday, March 6th.-Ever since the War
began, Mr. Swift MAcNEILL's most cherished
ambition—second, of course, to his desire to
quit Westminster for College Green—has been
to get the Dukes of CUMBERLAND and SAXE-
CobURG deprived of their British titles. He
has worried three successive Governments on
the subject, and some time ago received a
definite promise that it should be dealt with.
A further question regarding it stood in his
name to-day, but when he rose to put it
Mr. GINNELL squeaked out, “May I ask you,
Mr. SPEAKER, what this House has to do
with these family matters?” Mr. MACNEILL,
of course, like most of his countrymen, has
royal blood in his veins, but nevertheless did
not seem pleased with the allusion.
Further protests against the mutilation of
the Dardanelles Report were made by Sir
WALTER Essex, Sir CHARLEs HobHouse, and
Sir John JARDINE. Free disclosure to all
Members of Parliament, and no preferential

a motion for the adjournment. A word from
Mr. AsqurtH would no doubt have quelled
the storm, but as one of the favoured few who
are to receive the full Report he felt himself, I
suppose, precluded from saying it. The late
Mr. LABouch FRE would probably have sug-
gested that the difficulty should be solved, on
the analogy of a famous edition of MARTIAL,
by issuing the Report as expurgated, together
with an appendix containing all the omitted
passages. But there is no LABOUCHERE in the
House to-day—more 's the pity.
What Mr. Hogg F, does not know about
pensions is not worth knowing. He has al-
ready made havoc of more than one Govern-
ment scheme, and unless he has an official
ring put in his nose he will evidently do his
best to upset the latest of them. On the whole,
however, Mr. BARNEs's exposition of the new
pension scheme was well received. Though
not unduly generous—that would be impos-
sible in the circumstances—it will at least, as
Capt. STEPHEN Gwyn N put it, “enable us to
look disabled men in the face.”
A TRULE IRISHMAN.
Wednesday, March 7th.-Lords SHEFFIELD
and PARMooR are much disturbed because
British subjects have been interned without
trial, and had to be reminded by the LoRD
CHANCELLoR that there was a war in progress,
and that it was better that individuals should
lose a portion of their liberties than that the
community should lose them altogether.
A full appreciation of this truth might have
prevented the Irish Nationalists from seeking
at this moment to get Home Rule out of cold
storage. If the attempt had to be made Mr.
T. P. O'Connor was not perhaps the best per-
son to make it. For over an hour he meandered
through the more melancholy episodes of Irish
history, from the Treaty of Limerick to the
Easter Monday rebellion, rather in the manner
of one of those film-dramas of which he is now
the Censor. I am afraid his endeavour to prove
that Ireland is not “an irrational country, de-
manding impossible things,” was not entirely
convincing.
It failed, at any rate—although backed by a
brief appeal by Major WILLIE REDMoND, which
touched the House by its manifest sincerity—
to convince the PRIME MINISTER that this was
the accepted time for plunging Ireland once
more into civil strife. Those parts of Ireland
that wanted Home Rule could have it to-
morrow if they wished ; neither he nor any
other British statesman would force the people
of N.E. Ulster under a government they dis-
—Except, BEDAD, THAT WE’RE
GoING TO BEAT THE BOSCH !”
liked. When those two facts were thoroughly
understood there might be a chance of a settle-
ment.
Mr. John REDMoND, refusing to continue
what he regarded as a futile and humiliating
debate, marched out of the House at the head
of his supporters. This manoeuvre, rather
effective in the Gladstonian era, did not much
impress the House on this occasion; for news
that something of the kind was intended had
leaked out; and Mr. HEALY's subsequent allu-
sion to it as “a dramatic skedaddle" was felt
to be justified.
Thursday, March 8th. — I should have
thought that the Dardanelles Report, which
everyone is reading, contained enough sensa-
tions to satisfy the most outré taste. But Sir
CHARLEs Hobhouse is still anxious to know
the real meaning of the tantalizing asterisks
which occur here and there in it, and wants a
day to discuss the matter. Mr. BonAR LAw
did not absolutely refuse, but hoped that when
his right hom. friend had examined the Report
he would forgo his desire for further informa-
tion. It may safely be said
that the omitted passages,
whatever they are, could
hardly alter the public ver-
dict on the extraordinary
motions of conducting a
war which seem to have
prevailed in the Cabinet
of which Sir CHARLES
Hobhouse, was himself a
member.
The determining factor
in the inception of the
Dardanelles affair seems
to have been the disas-
trous confidence of the
then First Lord of the
Admiralty in the 15-inch
guns of the Queen Eliza-
beth. The outcome recalls
a verse from a song pop-
ular when Master WIN-
ston was in petticoats:–

A SONG OF FOOD-SAVING.
[Being a faithful effort to versify the article written
by Dr. E. I. SPRIGGs, at the request of the Food CoN-
troller, on the food requirements of people of different
ages and build.]
Good people, who long for a lead
On the paramount crux of the time,
I pray you give diligent heed
To the lessons I weave into rhyme;
And first, let us note, one and all—
Whether living in castles or “digs”--
“Large people need more than the small,”
For that's the first maxim of SPRIGGs.
Now, as most of the food that we eat
Is wanted for keeping us warm,
The requisite quota of heat
Is largely a question of form ; "
And the ratio of surface to weight,
As anyone readily twigs,
Is the root of the point in debate
As sagely expounded by SPRIGGs.

Short-sighted Lady. “OH, I'M so sorry.”
SEE HE'S GOT HIS LIGHT OVERCOAT ON, AND
Hence the more we resemble a sphere
Less heat on the surface is lost,
And the needful supply, it is clear,
Is maintained at less lavish a cost;
'Tis economy, then, to be plump
As partridges, puffins or pigs,
Who are never a prey to the hump,
So at least I interpret my SPRIGGs.
Next, the harder it freezes or snows
The greater the value of fat,
And the larger the appetite grows
. Of John, Sandy, Taffy and Pat.
(Conversely, in Midsummer days,
When liquid more freely one swigs,
Less viand the appetite stays—
This quatrain's a gloss upon SPRIGGS),
For strenuous muscular work
A larger allowance of grub
We need than is due if we shirk
Exertion, and lounge in a pub;
For the loafer who rests in a chair
Everlastingly puffing at “cigs.”
Can live pretty nearly on air,
So I gather at least from my SPRIGGs.
Why children need plentiful food
He nextly proceeds to relate:
Their capacity's larger than you'd
Be disposed to infer from their weight;
They're growing in bulk and in height,
They’re normally active as grigs,
And exercise breeds appetite—
This stanza is absolute SPRIGGs.
Last of all, with an eloquent plea
For porridge at breakfast in place
Of the loaf, and for oatcake at tea
A similar gap to efface;
For potatoless dinners—with rice,
For puddings of maize and of figs,
Which are filling, nutritious and nice—
Thus ends the Epistle of SPRIGGs.

BELLING THE CAT.
“THE only question is,” said the old mouse,
“who is to bell the cat 2 ''
“An absurd question,” said the strategist.
“It has finished the story for hundreds of
years,” said the old mouse crossly.
The strategist turned his back on the old
mouse. “What is needed,” he said, “is a
plan. We must make the cat appear ridicu-
lous, and the people of the house will see it is
no use as a mouser. Then they will turn it
into a pet cat and bell it themselves.”
“Shall we send a deputation?” growled the
old mouse.
“We must go out and hunt for food in the
daytime,” said the strategist.
“We shall all be killed,” cried the mice,
shivering with terror.
“No more than are killed now,” said the
strategist. “Less, in fact, because cats do not
see so well in the daytime.”
And it turned out as the strategist predicted.
Mice ran about boldly everywhere, and though
the cat caught some of them the people of the
house were dissatisfied. “We might as well
drown that cat at once and get a real mouser,”
said the master.
“Oh, don't drown poor pussy," said the
little girl. “Do let me keep her.”
“Well, mind you put a bell round her neck,
then,” laughed the master of the house, “so
that she may know that she's not a real
user.’’
*: night there was joy unheard of among
the mice. They scampered about happily, and
ran away chuckling when pussy came tinkling
along. The strategist was crowned king.

“THE MAN WHO WENT ABROAD.''
THE authors of The Man Who Stayed at
Home (I preserve their modest anonymity
have contrived a sequel to that exciting an
veracious stage account of secret service activ-
ities. The Man Who Went Abroad on one of
those famous State-paper chases, in which
conspirators conspire in the least likely places,
such as the promenade decks of liners, is the
man who spent his time in chimneys at home
in the earlier part of the War—Kit Brent.
He had a cousin, Lord Goring, Cabinet
Minister, bound on a mission to Washington;
and Kit, who was as like his cousin as clean-
shaven KENNETH. Douglas was like KENNETH
Doug LAs with a toothbrush moustache, took
his cabin while the important peer preceded him
in another boat. On board Kit disports him-
self as a fatuous ass, of the kind that hyphen-
ated Americans (in plays) would naturally
assume to be the staple of a British Cabinet.
Not that Goring really was such an ass; but
it was Kit's plan to be so guileless as to induce
the enemy agents to think they had a sitter.
Alad I must say they were pretty easily induced.
Their general scheme was to get those in-
evitable papers, copy and return them, and
delay Goring's visit to Washington, while the
late lamented BERNsroRFF put in a sugges-
tion which would make the British schemes,
whatever they ware—it was secret service, so
We, rightly, never \knew—look foolish. And
---->
they had the Hunnish idea of compromising
the silly peer with an irresistible Austrian dam-
seuse (Ani Kiraly), so that fear of exposure (by
Hidden-Hand Press) of intrigue with enemy
aliens would make him hand over the “papers.”
THE MAN WEIO STAYED IN HIS TENT.
Christopher Brent . MR. KENNETH. Douglas.
MISS IRIS HoF.Y.
Ani Kiraly . . .
Brent played up to all this. But the lady of the
ballet fell really in love with him, and besides
was actually a Dalmatian and on the right side,
a fact which she proclaimed at the top of her
voice on the promenade deck, though, as she
added, it meant death if discovered. In New
York the Kiraly appears in Kit's bed-bathroom
in the early morning, for devilment; to our
loud enjoyment, for the great bath joke has an
assured immortality. The Kiraly's husband
appears too. Fat in fire. When Kit goes to
the hyphenated's flat to exchange fake papers
in his belt for letter acknowledging Kiraly's
innocence, an agitated Hun appears with the
news that the real Goring is in Washington,
and the papers all spoof; which was annoying,
as a reading-glass had already disclosed to the
chief spy the British Government watermark,
which obviously proved they were genuine.
Nothing for it but to clear out (through a por-
trait of the All-Highest), leaving Kit in the
safe to suffocate. Enter police (comic). Where
is Kit Brain-wave. In the safe, behind secret
panel. Problem: how to open it. The service
was evidently so secret that it had never told
one of its brightest young men about combin-
ation letter-locks. But the dancer remembers
that the chief spy had carefully explained to
her the letters of the combination. Release
of Kit and a curtain which suggested that the
initiative remained with the Kiraly.
The authors are to be congratulated. They
provided a good unpretentious evening's enter-
tainment. No dull and pedantic realism for

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Zella Sees Herself (HEINEMANN) is an unusual and very subtle
analysis of a single character. The author, E. M. DELAFIELD, has
made an almost uncannily penetrating study of the development of a
poseuse. Zella posed instinctively, from the days when as a child she
alienated her father by attitudinising (with the best intentions) about
her mother's funeral. It became a habit with her. In Rome, before
the Arch of Titus, she thought more of what she might acceptably say
about it than of any wonder or beauty in the thing itself. She fooled
the honest man who imagined he was in love with her by making
herself, for the time, just what her fatal facility for such perception
told her he would most like her to be. The skill of the book is proved
by the increasing anxiety, and
even agitation, with which one
awaits the moment that shall
fulfil the title. It comes, bring-
ing with it that almost in-
tolerable tragedy of the soul,
the black loneliness that waits
upon insincerity. Then poor
deluded Zella, seeing herself,
sees also the fate that even-
tually befalls those who have
deliberately falsified the signals
by which alone one human
heart can speak to and assist
another. That is all the plot
of the story, told with remark-
able insight and a care that is
both sympathetic and wholly
unsparing. I am mistaken if
you will not find it one of the
most absorbing within recent
experience. But I am not say-
ing that it may not leave you
just a little uncomfortable.
Boyd CABLE is already one
of the prose Laureates of the
War, having earned his wreath
by Between the Lines and
Action Front. He now proves
that he is still entitled to it
by Grapes of Wrath (SMITH,
ELDER). The two former books
gave us detached articles all
relating to the one great sub-
ject. The present book is a
continuous story, the episodes
of which are held together by
the deeds and characters of a
quartette of friends, Larry
Arundel, Billy Simson, Pug
Sneath, and the noble and
adventurous American, Ken-
tucky Lee, who had enlisted
in our Army to prove that
“too proud to fight" was a
phrase which did not agree
with the traditions of an old
Kentucky family. These four

Mr. KIPLING has madeus familiar. Unfortunately poor Bassett escapes
from this emotional frying-pan only to plunge into the fire of a much
more scorching attachment. But I will not spoil for you an ingenious
plot. For one thing at least the book is worth reading, and that is
the picture, admirably drawn, of the half-caste Orchard family, whose
ways and speech and general outlook you will find an abiding joy.
ºrus has nothing better in her whole gallery, which is saying
much. -
You probably know Mr. BLACKwood's elusive method of mystery-
mongering by now. None of his characters can ever quite make out
whether the latest noise is a mewing cat, the wind in the trees or the
Great God Pan flirting with the Hamadryads. He meets in Egypt
a Russian consumptive with a hooked nose and a rotten bad temper,
- and persists in seeing him as
a hawk-man dedicated to the
wingéd god, Horus. “No one
could say exactly what hap-
pened.” (They never can.)
But it was something very
Solemn and important, and in
the end the Russian, in a
fancy dress of feathers, was
found dead at the foot of the
cliff, whither he had flown (or
was it danced?—well, no one
quite knew). He all but carried
with him little golden-haired
Vera, who was all but a dove.
This is a quite characteristic
sample out of Day and Night
Stories (CASSELL). And the
conclusion I came to was that
Mr. BLACKwood must get a
lot of fun out of staying in
“cosmopolitan hotels.” You
need a special attitude for the
proper enjoyment of these mys-
tical yarns. I read them all
conscientiously through, and
I got far the best thrill out of
“The Occupant of the Room,”
which, attempting less, was
much more successful. “H. S.
H.,” His Satanic Majesty, of
course, who was climbing the
Devil's Saddle and turned in
to the Club hut for desultory
conversation about his lost
kingdom with a stranded
mountaineer, left me inap-
propriately cold. I suppose I
am immune, a bad subject:
but I feel as sure as I've felt
about anything in the realm of
light letters that a charming
writer is overworking an un-
profitable vein.
Mrs. Vermon's Daughter
(METHUEN) is what one might
call a story of situation. That
is to say, it leads up to, and
declines from, one big scène
d faire. The scene, in this
instance, is that in which
of the British Army, and their achievements in one form or another
are thick on every page of the book. The author has reduced the
description of a modern battle to a fine art. No one can describe
more vividly the noise, the squalor, the terror, the high courage,
the self-sacrifice and again the nerve-shattering noise, that go
to make up the fierce confusion of trench-fighting. How anyone
succeeds in surviving when so many instruments are used for his
destruction is a mystery. The book is very certainly one to be read
and re-read.
Separation (CAssELL) is another of those intimate studies of Anglo-
Indian life that ALICE PERRIN has made specially her own. The
tragedy of it is sufficiently conveyed by the title. Separation, of
husband from wife or parent from child, is of course the spectre that
haunts the Anglo-Indian home. It was, chiefly at least, for the health
of their child Winnie that Guy Bassett was forced to let her and his wife
abide permanently in Kensington while he himself continued his
Eastern career as a grass-widower. Very naturally, the result was
all sorts of trouble. This first took the form of a flirtation, only
half serious, with an artful young woman of the type with which
Demaris, who has always previously imagined her mother to be an
undervalued heroine, finds that on the contrary she is really no better
(indeed a good deal worse) than she should be. And as if this disillusion
were not enough the poor girl gets almost simultaneously the further
shock of learning that the same adored parent, supposed by her to be
a tragédienne of the first water, is in fact no more than a handsome
stick, and unable (as they say) to act for nuts. Jesting apart, I am
bound to admit that Lady ThoubRIDGE has risen admirably to the
demands of her theme, and written a story both direct and appealing.
Perhaps (dare I say?) its emotion is rather more secure, than its
grammar. The fact that she makes a duchess allude to “these kind
of things” struck me at first as a subtlety of characterization, till I
discovered that, some pages later, the author fell herself into the
identical pit. But I suppose there is hardly any one of us wholly
innocent of this offence; anyhow, it is only a small blemish upon a
pleasant and (in its mild way) interesting story.

Friend. “WELL, what's wrong? HAS HE BEEN TALKING”
Unlucky One. “Not A word, cuRse HIM!”
THE MUD LARKs.
WHEN I was young, my parents sent me to
a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting
me educated, but because they wanted a quiet
home.
At that boarding school Imet one Frederick
Delame Milroy, a chubby flame-coloured brat
who had no claims to genius, excepting as a
littérateur.
The occasion that established his reputation
with the pen was a Natural History essay. We
were given five sheets of foolscap, two hours
and our own choice of subject. I chose the
elephant, I remember, having once been kind
to one through the medium of a bag of nuts.
Frederick D. Milroy headed his effort “THE
FERT" in large capitals, and began, “The fert
is a noble animal ” He got no further,
the extreme mobility of the ferret having
apparently blinded him to its other character-
istics.
The other day, as I was wandering about on
the “line,” dodging Bosch crumps with more
agility than grace, I met Milroy (Frederick
Delane) once more.
He was standing at the entrance of a cosy
little funk-hole, his boots and tunic undone,
sniffing the morning nitro-glycerine. He had
swollen considerably since our literary days,
but was wearing his hair as red as ever, and I
should have known it anywhere—on the darkest
might. I dived for him and his hole, pushed
him into it, and re-introduced myself. He
remembered me quite well, shook my chilblaims
heartily, and invited me further underground
for tea and talk.
It was a mice hole, cramped and damp, but
very deep, and with those Bosch love-tokens
thudding away upstairs I felt that the nearer
Australia the better. But the rats! Never
before have Iseen ratsin such quantities; they
flowed unchidden all over the dug-out, rum-
maged in the cupboards, played kiss-in-the-
ring in the shadows, and sang and brawled
behind the old oak panelling until you could
barely hear yourself shout. I am fond of
animals, but I do not like having to share my
tea with a bald-headed rodent who gets noisy
in his cups, or having a brace of high-spirited
youngsters wrestle out the championship of
the district on my bread-and-butter.
Freddy apologised for them; they were getting
a bit above themselves, he was afraid, but they
were seldom dangerous, seldom attacked one
unprovoked. “Live and let live” was their
motto. For all that they did get a trifle de
trop sometimes; he himself had lost his temper
when he awoke one morning to find a brawny
rat sitting on his face combing his whiskers
in mistake for his own (a pardonable error in
the dark); and, determining to teach them a
lesson, had bethought him of his old friend,
the noble fert, He therefore sent home for
two of the best.
The ferrets arrived in due course, received
the names Burroughs and Welcome, were
blessed and turned loose.
They had had a rough trip over at the
bottom of the mail sack and were looking for
trouble. An old rat strolled out of his club to
see what all the noise was about, and got the
excitement he needed. Seven friends came to
his funeral and never smiled again. There
was great rejoicing in that underground Mess
that evening; Burroughs and Welcome were
fêted on bully beef and condensed milk, and
made honorary members.
For three days the good work went on:
there was weeping in the cupboards and
gmashing of teeth behind the old oak panelling.
Then on the fourth day Burroughs and Wel-
come disappeared, and the rats swarmed to
their own again. The deserters were found a
week later; they had wormed through a system
of rat-holes into the next dug-out, inhabited by
the Atkinses, and had remained there, honoured
guests.
It is the nature of the British Atkins to
make a pet of anything, from a toad to a suck-
ing pig-he cannot help it. The story about
St. George, doyen of British soldiers, killing
that dragon — nonsense! He would have
spanked it, may be, until it promised to
reform, then given it a cigarette, and taken it
home to amuse the children. To return to
our ferrets, Burroughs and Welcome provided
no exception to the rule; they were taught to
sit up and beg, and lie down and die, to turm
handsprings and play the mouth-organ; they
were gorged with Maconochie, plum jam and
rum ration; it was doubtful if they ever went to
bed sober. Times out of number they were
borne back to the Officers' Mess and exhorted to
do their bit, but they returned immediately to
their friends the Atkinses, vid their private
route, not unnaturally preferring a life of
continuous carousal and vaudeville among the
flesh-pots to sapping and mining down wet
rat-holes.
Freddy was of opinion that, when the
battalion proceeded up Unter den Linden,
Burroughs and Welcome would be with it as
regimental mascots, marching behind the
band, bells on their fingers, rings on their toes.
He also assured me that if he ever again has
to write an essay on the Fert, its character-
istics, the adjective “noble” will not figure so
prominently.

Having told us all this, he, being a very

friend said at last, “Well, as you and she are
such pals, and as she has only to know that you

why not send your card to her?”
The agent agreed, and we watched the
waiter threading his way among the tables
towards that one at which the new and grate-
ful star was seated and hand the card to her.
The end of this story is so tragic that I
should prefer not to tell it.
Ella Reeve took the card, read it, laid it
down, and resumed conversation
with her friends. She did not even
glance in our direction.
I felt sorry for the agent, whose
mortification was very real, though
he made a brave effort to carry it
off; and now that he is dead I feel
sorrier. As for Ella Reeve (which
is not really her mame, but one
which with great ingenuity I devised

ELLA REEVE.
ONE can't be too careful how one boasts,
especially if there is the chance of the boast
being put quickly to the proof. In fact, it is
better perhaps not to boast at all. -
I was sitting with a friend and a stranger
in a London restaurant, having joined their
table for coffee. The stranger, on introduc-
tion, turned out to be connected with the stage
in some capacity as agent, and among his
regular clients were the managers of various
big provincial theatres, for whom he provided
the leading lights of pantomime, or, IT
as he would call it, panto. Panto
was indeed the mainstay of his
business; it was even the warp and
woof of his life. He lived for panto,
he thought panto, and he talked
panto. No one, according to him,
had a more abysmal knowledge of
principal boys with adequate legs,
principal (if that is still the word)
girls with sufficient voices, contralto
fairy queens with abundant bosoms,
basso demon kings, Prince Dan-
dinis, Widow Twankays, Ugly Sis-
ters, and all the other personages
of this strange grease-paint my-
thology of ours. Listening to him,
I learned—as those who are hum-
ble in spirit may learn of all
men. I learned, for example, that
Ugly Sisters are at Christmas-time
always Ugly Sisters, and very often
use again the same dialogue, merely
transferring themselves from, say,
Glasgow to Wigan, or from Bristol
to Dublin; and this will be their
destiny until they become such very
old men that not even the kindly
British public will stand it any
longer. England, it seems, is full
of performers who, touring the halls
from March to December, are then
claimed for panto as her own, arriv-
ing a little before Christmas not less
regularly than the turkey; and the
aim of all of them is as nearly as
possible to do the next Christmas
what they did last Christmas.
Not only did my new acquaint-
ance know all these people, their
capabilities and the lowest salary
that could be offered to them with
any chance of acceptance, but he
was also, it seemed, beloved by
them all. Between agent and client
never in the history of the world
had such charming relations sub-
sisted as between every pro. on his
books and himself.
It was then that Ella Reeve
came in.
Accompanied by two expensive-
looking men, whose ancestors had

beyond any doubt crossed the Red
Sea with Moses, this new and glittering
star, who had but just “made good,” or
“got over,” or “clicked” (my new acquaintance
used all these phrases indiscriminately when
referring to his own Herschellian triumphs as
a watcher of the skies), walked confidently to a
distant table which was being held in reserve
for her party, and drew off her gloves with the
happy anticipatory assurance of one who is
about to lunch a little too well. (All this, I
should say, happened before the War. I am
reminded of it to-day by the circumstance
that I have just heard of the death of the

the lobster on her plate or with the yellow
fluid, strange to me, that moved restlessly in
a long-stemmed shallow glass at her side.
And then, being, as I say, not in any way an
eccentric or exorbitant character, the agent
told it us a third time, with a digression here
and there as to the deep friendships that mem-
bers of his profession could form and cement
if only they were decent fellows and not mere
money-grubbing machimes out for nothing but
their commission. “That's what the wise man
does,” he concluded; “he makes real friends
with his clients, such as I did with Ella Reeve.

Went out to shoot the tiger, that homicidal beast,
The most electrifying humanitarian stunt
Has been my khaki joy-ride along the British Front.
“It wasn't my own suggestion; I went as the Government's guest,
Invited to see how the brass-hats were running the show on
the West ; -
I've never been sweet on soldiers, but I only went for a week,
And it gave me heaps of chances of studying war technique.
“If they really thought to convert me by the loan of a khaki suit,
Or by conferring upon me the right to claim a salute,
It wouldn't at all surprise me, for dullards have always tried
To bribe true men of genius to take the popular side.
“Well, I went, I saw, I ‘joy-rode,’ and my verdict remains the
same;
There's no use having a country unless she's always to blame;
For of all the appalling prospects that human life can lend
The worst is to be unable to play the candid friend.
“Men talk of France, the Martyr; of her precious blood outpoured;
Of the innocent helpless victims of the brutal Hunnish horde;
Presuming, insensate idiots, to label as beast and brute
The race that has always held me in the very highest repute!
“While France has failed completely, at least in these later days,
To show appreciation of my Prefaces and Plays;
It wouldn't be therefore worthy of a genuine superman
To show undue compassion for the sorrows of ‘Marianne.”
“And as for the sheer destruction of noble and ancient fanes
Which the prejudiced Hun-hater indignantly arraigns,
The simple truth compels me in honesty to state
That the style of some ruined buildings was utterly second-rate.
“But to quit these trivial matters—let weaklings wail and weep,
The loss of a few cathedrals will never affect my sleep—
What lifts this Armageddon to an altitude sublime
Is the crowning fact that it gave me a perfectly glorious time.
“As an ultra-neutral observer I entered the battle zone
And emerged unmoved, unshaken, with a heart as cool as a stone;
No sight could touch or daunt me, no sound my soul untune;
From pity or tears or sorrow I still remained immune.
“I own that before my arrival I felt an occasional qualm
Lest the shock of the unexpected might shatter my wonted calm;
But it gave me the richest rapture to find I was wholly free
From the crude and vulgar emotions that harass the plain V.C.
“I inspected the great war-engine, and, instead of its going strong,
I saw that in each of its workings there was always something
wrong;
In fact, with the old black powder and the obsolete Brown Bess
The chances of missing your target were infinitely less.
“The so-called arm of precision scores only by lucky hits,
Though the ‘heavies' and high explosives may possibly blow you
to bits;
I saw one corpse on my ‘joy-ride,' the head had been blown away,
And the thought of this painless ending produced in me no dismay.”
Now he's back in the finest feather from his holiday with the Staff,
And we're sure that no one will grudge him the meed of this epitaph:
“He went through the fiery furnace, but never a hair was missed
From the heels of our most colossal Arch-Super-Egotist.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 12th.-Having declared war
upon the Government the Nationalists are
seeking a suitable plan of campaign. The
Home Rule demand never obtained much
support among the Irish farmers until FINTAN
LALoR hitched it on to the Land question,
and ever since Mr. WYNDHAM's Land Purchase
Act turned the tenants into prospective owners
it has been steadily losing momentum. Mr.
GINNELL, who made his reputation as a per-
verse species of cowboy, now witnesses with
grim satisfaction the efforts of his colleagues
to borrow his policy and break up the grass
farms. It was rather hard on him that the
Parliamentary printer should have ruined one
of his questions on the subject by making him
say “that the reason”—instead of the season
—“for breaking this land is passing away.”
The HoME SECRETARY is regarded by those
who do not know him in-
timately as a somewhat
austere person, but given
the right atmosphere he
can be as lively as any-
body. Questioned about
the reopening of Ciro's, he
betrayed a minute ac-
quaintance with the de-
tails of its programme.
I was beginning to wonder
if he were related to that
famous Early - Victorian
family, the Caves of Har-
mony, when his know-
ledge broke down. On
being asked by his old
friend Mr. BUTCHER to
define a cabaret - enter-
tainment he was non-
plussed, and could only

lighted at Mr. Bonar
LAw's announcement of
the capture of Baghdad
than the Member for
Cockermouth, who knows
the region well. Mesopo-
tamia may or may not be
the Garden of Edem, but
Baghdad was at one time
unquestionably the abode
of BLISS.
Mr. CATHCART WAson was a little puzzled
when Mr. ForsTER informed him that the
peeling of potatoes by Army cooks is strictly
forbidden, “except when the dietary of the
troops makes it necessary.” Why should
there be any exception at all, he wondered,
until a neighbour, better informed about the
new meat-ration, whispered, “Sausages and
mashed.”
A grave statement by Mr. MACPHERson as
to the recent losses of the Royal Flying Corps
on the Western Front, and the increased
activity of the German airmen, created some
natural depression, which might have been
more pronounced had mot Mr. PEMBERTON-
BILLING seized the occasion to reiterate his
charges of “Murder” already condemned as
baseless by two judicial tribunals. The House
will do anything in reason, but it refuses
to accompany Mr. BILLING in his flights of
imagination.

Bill to deprive enemy peers of their titles was
supported by Lord MIDLETON, who nobly offered
to sacrifice his Red Eagle on the altar of pat-
riotism. On the other hand Lord CourTNEY

Wednesday, March 14th. — The explosive
qualities of cottom when suitably combined
with other ingredients are well known. Of
these ingredients the Lancashire spirit is per-
haps the most potent. Mr. AU8TEN CHAMBER-
LAIN began his defence of the proposed Indian
cotton duties with an appeal to Imperial senti-
ment based upon what India had done and was
doing. The Maharajah of BIKANIR, seated in
the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, listened
with appreciation to the praises of his famous
Camel Corps. Then followed what might be
called the Home Rule argument—we could
not refuse what the Indian people so much
desired—delivered with so much earnestmess
that Mr. JEREMIAH MACVEAGH loudly invited
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN to “come over and sit on
these benches.”
MEGAPHONES FOR MINISTERS.
A SUGGESTION FROM THE PRESS GALLERY.
But his best card was his last, whem, after a
tribute to Mr. AsquitH’s “loyalty to col-
leagues,” which roused tremendous cheering
from the Liberals, he invited the late Prime
Minister to cast his vote with the Government.
Mr. Asquith did even more, for at the end of
a speech, critical but not censorious, he sug-
gested an amendment to the Resolution which
enabled his FreeTrade followers to “save their
face.” A few stalwarts from Lancashire in-
sisted none the less on taking a division, and
were joined on general principles by the
Nationalists and other habitual malcontents.
But India, the Government and Mr. Asquith
had the comfortable majority of 140.
Thursday, March 15th.-Under the present
rules of procedure (the products of Irish
obstruction in the past), the Nationalists find
it difficult to put their declaration of war
against the Government to much effect. Their
best chance comes during the first hour of the
sitting, and their most useful weapon is the
Supplementary Question. No sooner has Mr.
DUKE read the official reply to the inquiry on
the Paper than there comes a strident “Arising
out of that, Mr. SPEAKER-R.” Fortunately
the CHIEF SECRETARY possesses a Job-like
patience, and is rarely betrayed into any de-
habitually wears was originally conferred upon parture from his polite if somewhat ponderous
manner. To badger Mr. BIRRELL was an
exciting pastime rather like punching the ball.
To heckle Mr. DUKE is like hammering a
sandbag.
It would be interesting to know how many
Members of the House of Commons have volun-
teered under the National Service scheme.
I only know of one; that is Dr. MACNAMARA,
who modestly avowed the fact when challenged
by Mr. PRINGLE, though I doubt whether the
Admiralty will consent to dispense with his
services. On the other hand I only know of
one who has mot; and that is Mr. PRINGLE
himself, who, on the same challenge being
put to him, replied, “No, and don't intend.”
There is evidently someone, possibly Mr.
Hogg E, who thinks Mr. PRINGLE's present
services indispensable to the winning of the
War.
The debate on the new Vote of Credit
dragged along in a thin and somnolent House
until Mr. BonAR LAw
woke it up with the
startling news that there
had been a revolution in
Russia, and that the TsAR
had abdicated. Every-
body seemed pleased, in-
cluding Mr. DEVILIN, who
was quite statesmanlike
in his appreciation. But
no one noticed that hence-
forward we must rank the
late Sir HENRY CAMP-
BELL-BANNERMAN among
the prophets. Addressing
the Members of the Inter-
Parliamentary Conference
assembled in the Palace
of Westminster on July
23rd, 1906, just after the
dissolution of Russia's
first elected Parliament,
he said, “La Duma est
morte; vive la Duma / "
For a Prime Minister this
outburst was regarded as
a little tactless; its essen-
tial wisdom has been
justified by the event.
Friday, March 16th.-
To - morrow being St.
Patrick's Day, Mr. BonAR
LAw seized the oppor-
tunity to address a little
homily to Members from
- Ireland. Unless they mend
their ways pretty soon they may have to go
back to their constituents and tackle the Sinn
Feiners themselves.
WINGED VICTORY.
“Per ardua ad astra.”
“One of our machines did not return.”
I LIKE to think it did not fall to earth,
A wounded bird that trails a broken wing,
But to the heavenly blue that gave it birth
Faded in silence, a mysterious thing,
Cleaving its radiant course where honour lies,
Like a winged victory mounting to the skies.
The clouds received it and the pathless might;
Swift as a flame, its eager force unspent,
We saw no limit to its daring flight;
Only its pilot knew the way it went,
And how it pierced the maze of flickering
stars
Straight to its goal in the red planet Mars.
So to the entrance of that fiery gate,
Borne by no current, driven by no breeze,
Knowing no guide but some compelling fate,
Bold mavigators of uncharted seas,
Courage and youth went proudly sweeping by,
To win the unchallenged freedom of the sky.

(ENVER Pasha and the Sultan of Turkey.)
The Sultan. Then you want me to press the
GERMAN KAISER to come to Constantinople
and pay me a visit. Is that it?
Enver. Yes, your Majesty, that is about it.
It would produce a splendid effect on the
populace and would electrify the soldiers.
The Sultan. But I’ve already told you that
Icordially dislike this KAISER of yours. Wher-
ever he goes he turns everything upside down,
and there's not a moment's peace or repose
for anybody. He must have reviews of troops
morning, noon and night, and it's all quite
useless, for our Generals tell me that he doesn’t
really understand anything about soldiers and
their movements. You know they've had to
keep him away from the fighting, both in
France and Russia, because he would insist
on giving the most absurd orders, and when
things didn't go right immediately he always
broke out into shouting and cursing, and
praying and crying until his Staff felt, so
ashamed of him and themselves that they
didn't know which way to look. There’s never
any knowing what a man like that will do.
He 's as likely as not to want to preach a
sermon in St. Sophia, or to ride his horse up
the steps of the Palace.
Enver. These are certainly faults, but they
are the faults of an enthusiastic mature.
The Sultan. Well, I don't like that kind
of enthusiastic nature. I prefer something
quieter. Besides, I am told that his behaviour
in the house and his table-manners are dread-
ful. He's quite capable, if he doesn't like a
dish, of throwing it at the attendants. Then
he gets so angry when people don't agree with
him; the least contradiction makes him purple,
absolutely purple, with passion. My dear
ENVER, you would have to pretend you knew
nothing about Turkey when you talked with
him—at any rate nothing in comparison with
his knowledge—and I'm sure you wouldn't
like that; nobody would. No, I can't say the
prospect of having him here as my guest
allures me, but of course, if you say it
must be done, I’m ready to sacrifice myself.
Only I warn you it will spoil everything for
me to have him here prancing about in a
Turkish uniform.
Enver. I didn't know your Majesty's feelings
were so strong on the subject. Perhaps it will
not, after all, be necessary. I will see what
can be dome.
The Sultan. Yes, do, there's a good fellow.
If I had to entertain that man for a week I
should suffer from indigestion for the rest of
my life.
Enver. If possible we will see that your
Majesty is spared such an affliction. With
your Majesty's leave I will now withdraw.
The Sultan. Do by all means. No-stop;
you haven’t given me any of the War news.
I keep on asking for it, but nobody pays any
attention to my requests. Honestly, I don't
see much use in being a Sultan if one can't
get anyone to do what one asks.
Enver. Oh, you want to hear some War
news, do you? Well, I may as well tell you
now as later. Baghdad's gone.
The Sultan. What—captured?
Enver. Yes, the infernal English have got it.
The Sultan. I knew it was bound to happen.
I told you so only last Tuesday—at least, if it
wasn't you it was somebody else. “Baghdad,”
I said, “is sure to be captured. The English
are in great force, and if we don't watch it
carefully they're sure to snatch it from us.”
That's what I said; but you wouldn't have it.
You were all so cock-sure, and now where are
you? -
Enver. Who can fight against treachery 2
The Sultan. Treachery 2 It's simply stu-
pidity and incompetence. You and your
KAISER keep º one another on the back,
and them one fine morning you wake up and dis-
cover that Baghdad has fallen. ENVER, you'll
find it rather difficult to explain this to the
people. They know my advice hasn't counted
for anything in this; they’ll put it all down
to you; and you can't murder them all, as
you murdered poor old NaziM.
Enver. Silence, or
The Sultant. Yes, I know, but I will not
keep silence. Rather, I will ask again, why
have you sent my best regiments to help the
Austrians and Germans on their own fronts 2
Even I could have managed better than that.
And why are we fighting in this War at all?
Answer me that.
Enver. We fight for the greatness of Turkey.

cessful. It was a good deal bigger before we
lost Erzerum and Baghdad . . .

at the end that the success of his professional
ambitions was far more to him than any affair
of the heart. And, after all, when Remnant
complained of a curious bourdonnement in her
ears, and Tony had to reply solemnly, “That
which you hear is the beating of your heart
to the music of your soul,” you could hardly
expect a man with Mr. EADIE's sense of
humour to throw much conviction into the
statement.
Mr. C. M. LowNE was a very passable beau,
and made love to Remnant with that rich
fruitiness of voice of which he is a past master.
It was her business (as she explained to Tony
when he surprised their two faces within kissing
distance of each other) to keep Jules in good
humour since Tony's chances depended upon
his patronage. But it couldn't have helped
much to tell Jules with such appalling candour
that the shiver produced by his kiss was the
same kind as she had once felt when a rat ran
over her face during sleep. However, Jules
was not a beau for nothing and could afford
this exceptional set-back to one of his many
amours. There was, by the way, an excel-
lent little comedy scene between him and his
wife, played by Miss MURIEL Pope with a
quiet humour as piquant as her gown.
As Manon, the querulous termagant that
Tony had taken for mistress, Miss HILDA
MooRE was not very kindly served by her part
—so rudimentary that its highest flight was
achieved when, with a Parthian shot, she
referred to Tony as a geni-ass.
I will not forecast a limited success for this
play, for who would dare to say that there is
not always room in the broad British bosom
for yet another triumph of sentiment over
ideas—I speak of the play itself and not of the
performance? If only for Miss LöHR's sake
I could wish that the best of fortune may
attend it; for to have worn her hair as she did
in the Second Act, out of regard for the period,
was a sacrifice as fine as any that women have
shown in the course of Armageddon (if I may
judge of them by their portraits in the Photo-
graphic Press), and she ought to have her
reward, bless her heart | S.

AT THE PLAY.
“REMNANT.”
I wish now that I had not been compelled
to postpone my visit to the Royalty, for I
think the fall of Baghdad must have put me
a bit above myself.
Anyhow, I was less
moved than usual by the triumph of virtue
and the downing of vice; and permitted my-
self to wonder how a play like Remnant ever
found its way into the Royalty ſº all theatres),
and what Mr. DENNIs EADIE (of all actors) was
doing in this galley, this melted-butter boat.
And indeed there were moments when I could
see that Mr. EADIE himself shared my wonder,
if I rightly interpreted certain signs of indiffer-
ence and detachment in his performance. I
even suspected a sinister intention in the title,
though, of course, Messrs. MoRTON and Nicco-
DEMI didn't really get their playoff in the course
of a bargain sale of superannuated goods.
Apart from the Second Act, where Miss
MARIE LöHR (looking rather like a nice
Dutch doll) delivered the blunt gaucheries of
Remnant with a delightfully stolid naïveté,
the design of the play and its simple little
devices might almost have been the work of
amateurs. The sordid quarrels between Tony
and his preposterous mistress (whom I took
to be a model, till I found that he was only
an artist in steam locomotives) were extra-
ordinarily lacking in subtlety. In all this
Bohemian business one looked in vain for a
touch of the art of MURGER. What would one
not have given for something even distantly
reminiscent of the Juliet scene—“et le pigeon
chantait toujours"? And it wasn't as if this
was supposed to be a sham Americanised
quartier of to-day. We were in the true
period—under Louis PHILIPPE. Indeed I
know no other reason (costumes always ex-
cepted) why the scene was the Paris of 1840.
For the purposes of the play Tony might just
as well have been a British designer of tanks
(London, 1916). Nor was there anything even

“Remnant" . . . .
conventionally French about the girl Rem-
mant, who might have been born next-door to
Bow Bells.
Miss MARIE LöHR was the life and soul of
the party. Her true comedy manner, when
she was serious, was always fascinating. She
said with great discretion her little Barriesque
piece about the desirability of babies, and she
did all she knew to keep the sentiment from
being too sickly-sweet. Here she had strong
assistance from Mr. EADIE as her lover Tony;
for, though he got a fine flash out of the green
eye of jealousy when he suspected his patron,
Jules, of jumping his love-claim, it was obvious
humour and its effect of honest entertainment.
Not a highbrow adventure, it is not to be
judged by highbrow standards. It is decently
in key, and an exceptionally clever cast carried
it adroitly over any rough places. Remark-
able, too, as almost the first popular testi-
monial since the War began to the too-much-
taken-for-granted Territorials, who worked
in the old days while we scoffed and golfed.
That's all to the good.
Our author's hero is an excellent provincial
tailor, who is also keen Captain Smith in the
Sheffingham Terriers. As tailor his chief cus-
tomer, as soldier his contemptuous scandalised
critic, is Sir Dennys Broughton, whose wayward
flapper daughter Betty is in the early fierce
stages of revolt against the stuffiness of life at
Grange Court, meets Smith over some boys'
club work, and, finding brains and dreams in
him (a formidable contrast to her loafing
brother), falls into passionate first-love. Smith
is just as badly if more soberly hit, and recog-
nising the impossibility of the situation (quite
apart from demonstrations by the alarmed
Broughtons) decides to take his tape and
shears to his London house of business. The
date of all this being about the time of the
misguided Panther's fateful leap on Agadir.
Act II, brings us to the second year of the
War. Young Broughton, puppy no longer, is
gloriously in it, and has just been gazetted to
a Territorial regiment whose Colonel bears
the not uncommon name of Smith. Our tailor,
of course, and a rattling fine soldier too.
Having discovered this latter fact and also
formed a remarkably cordial relationship ap-
parently in a single day, the enthusiastic cub
subaltern (distemper and snobbishness over
and done with) motors up his C.O., who is
visiting his brother and partner, and brings
him in to Grange Court on the way. Sir
Dennys, now a brassarded private and other-
wise a converted man, is still confoundedly em-
barrassed, and stands anything but easy in the
presence of his youngster's Colonel. Lady
Broughton, least malleable of the group, is
frankly appalled by this new mesalliance.
Perhaps Mr. TERRY's version of blue-blooded
insolence and fatuity is for his stage purpose
rather crudely coloured, but who shall say

It is much pleasanter (and
juster) to dwell on its wholesomeness, its easy

that the doctrine that a man in khaki who
has been an elementary schoolmaster or a
tailor is a man for a' that, is quite universally
accepted in the best circles even in this year
of grace? Betty, now a grown girl in the
cynical stage, revenges herself with feline
savagery on the knight of the shears for the
imagined slight of his defection.

attack on the defences of Betty. She puts up
enough of a fight to ensure a good Third Act,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Snare (SECKER) impressed me as a tale emphatically pre-
dedicate to the footlights. Actually, by the way, Mr. RAFAEL
SABATINI has dedicated it “to LEoN M. LEON, who told me this
story.”—which, of course, only strengthens my belief. Anyhow, it
has every mark of the romantic drama—a picturesque setting, that of
the Peninsular War, rich in possibilities for the scenic and sartorial
arts; and a strongly emotional plot, leading º to a situation that
could be relied upon to bring down the house. shall, of course, not
tell you the plot. It contains a jealous husband, an injudicious wife,
a hero and heroine, a villain (of foreign extraction) and a god in the
machine, who is none other than our IRoN DUKE himself. And the
situation in the last Act offers as pretty a piece of table-turning as any
audience need desire. I wish I could explain how the DUKE plays
with his enemies, and finally—but no, I said I wouldn't, and I will
keep my word. Two little carpings, however. Surely it is wrong to
speak of “catch half-penny” journalism in the time of WELLINGTON.
º is that the journalists of those days caught at least
fourpence by their wares. And I confess to an emotion of disappoint-
ment when the heroine bounced up at the court-martial and said
that the hero couldn't have committed the murder because he was “in
her arms” at the time. Of course he hadn't been ; and I very
much doubt whether any Court
belongings on the edge of a bottomless tarn. Then, being hypotheti-
cally dead, she begins to live her life in her own way. Later on
she returns to Edward, “on approval for six months”; but this
period was apparently not sufficient to break the chain that bound
her to Another, and, the War intervening, she is left almost
doubly widowed. I feel that I have not quite done justice to Miss
WAUGHAN's book, but, on the other hand, I am sure that she has not
quite done justice to her unquestionable talent.
A volume entitled Friends of France: The Field Service of the
American Ambulance (SMITH, ELDER) has appeared in a happy hour
to remind one, if that were necessary, that in the great nation that
awaits Mr. WILson's call there have always been found some eager to
give their services and, if need be, life itself to prove their love for the
other great Republic. I don't think either you or I will grudge such
an affection at this date, founded historically though it may be on a
mutual dislike of ourselves, and consequently it is a very pleasant
impression that is produced by this record of American efficiency and
courage in Red Cross work on the French front. This being clearly
remembered one need not be afraid to admit that in detail the book
will be of interest mainly to the friends of those concerned, since
the method of multiple authorship adopted necessarily involves over-
lapping, and a good deal of the volume is given up to monotonous,
though undoubtedly well-earned, “tributes and citations” from the
French authorities. Neither
is the bulk of the matter, most
generously illustrated though
it is, particularly intriguing,
for by now one is sufficiently
familiar with accounts of the
removal of wounded under fire
and the sort of work at which
these four hundred American
University men proved them-
selves so adept at half-a-dozen
points between Flanders and
Alsace. Americans, long at
odds with “ruthlessness” (and
at last forced to the inevitable
logical conclusion in regard to
it), may well be glad to be able
to point, amongst other credit-
able things, to this history of
service given without hesita-
tion in acknowledgment of
their debt to the civilisation of
the Old World; and we also
shall be no less glad to remen-
ber it.
It is perhaps natural that in
Winnowed Memories(CAssBLL),
- by Field-Marshal Sir Evalyn
Wood, V.C., one should look at
% Coffee Stali), “wor YER tryin' |first to see what references they
IT 'omº Foº FEAR or 'avin' | contain to modern events. On
these matters, as on all others
would have believed her for
two minutes. But leading
ladies love saying it, so I sup-
pose the very out-worn device
will have to be retained in the
stage version. I look forward
to this with much pleasure.
That clever lady, ELINort
MonpauxT, has collected into
the volume that she calls Before
Midnight (CAssell) a series
of short stories of a psychic
(though not always ghostly)
character, which, while not
very eerie, or on the same
high level, are at their best
both original and impressive.
The first of them, which affords
exeuse for a highly-intriguing
cover-picture, is at once the
most spooksome and the least
satisfactory. That is to say
that, though it opens with a
genuine and quite horrible
thrill, the “explanation" is
obscure and tame. Far more
successful, to my mind, is -- ºš º
“The Vision,” a delicate little
idyll of a Midland school- Sympathetic Newsboy (to proprietor
marm, to whom is shown To bowry THE old º
the death of Adonis and the IT command EERRD 2"
lamenting of his goddess-lover.
The writing of this touches real beauty (the high-fantastic, instead of
the merely high-falutin', which in such connection would have been
so fatally easy). To sum up, though one at least of these “dreams
before midnight” may quite possibly become a nightmare after it, I
fancy that, to all lovers of the occult, the game will be found well
worth the bed-room candle.
There are qualities in The Bird of Life, by GERTRUDE WAUGHAN
º: AND HALL), which cause me to look forward to this lady's
uture work with very considerable interest. In the present novel she
sets out the life story of Rachel up to a point boldly given as being
beyond the conclusion of the War, in which, by the way, both her
husband and the man whom she ought to have married are killed on
the same day. The first eighty-four pages of the book raised my hopes
very high. They describe with great simplicity and sympathy the
thoughts and feelings, the romances and difficulties, of an affectionate
and lonely little girl living with her Uncle Matthew and her Aunt
Elizabeth, and loving them both with a childlike fervour. There is
no exaggeration; the writing goes true to its mark, and the effect
designed by the writer is admirably well made. Then Uncle Matthew
dies and Rachel finds a new home in the Vicarage of Mr. Venning,
a family man if ever there was one, for he has fifteen children.
From this point the interest is slightly diluted, and the excellence
of the book diminishes. One does not recognise in the more mature
Rachel the girl one had expected to find after one's initiation into

told nothing that is not invigorating and to the point, and the tributes
here paid to the fighting qualities of our armies of to-day form a fitting
conclusion to a book that is full of sound sense and good cheer. Sir
EvKLYN has had a vast experience and enjoys an evergreen vigour.
What is rarer still, he has a kindly nature that admits no trace of the
disappointments he must from time to time have suffered. As everyone
knows, he was always an advocate of Compulsory Universal Service
for Home Defence, but he casts no stone at those who so long and
parlously delayed to learn their lesson. Like the true soldier that he
is, he seems to have no time or taste for those recriminations which
are best left to small political fry. And I rejoice that in a book of
such authority the note is largely one of happiness and hope.
“Owing to congestion on the railways there is a food shortage in Petrograd,
which has led some of the less irresponsible citizens to demonstrate during
the session of the Council of the Empire and the Duma.”—Daily Sketch.
Subsequent news shows that “less irresponsible” was not a misprint
but a prophecy.
“It is claimed that about thirty Merman firms construct the Diesel
motors originally used for submarines.”—Daily Telegraph.
We wish these motors a speedy return to the fishy scenes of their origin.

As I said to John, I can bear anger and sarcasm—but contempt,
not. Binny and Joe are our cats, and the most pampered of pets.
Every day, when our meals were served, there was spread upon the
carpet a newspaper, on which Binny and Joe would trample,
clamouring, until a plate containing their substantial portion was laid
down : after which we were free to proceed with our own meal.
Then came the paralysing shock of Lord DEvoNPoRT's ration
announcement, in which no mention is made of cats. Binny and Joe
looked at one another in consternation over their porridge as I read
aloud his statement from the newspaper at breakfast.
When I came in to luncheon I had a letter in my hand and
accidentally dropped the envelope. Paper of any kind upon the carpet
is associated in Binny's mind with the advent of food. Straightway
he thudded from his arm-chair and sat down upon the envelope. You
will notice that I speak above of Binny and Joe. I do so instinc-
tively, because, though Binny is only half Joe's age of one year, some-
how he always occurs everywhere before Joe. Joe was lying on the
same arm-chair, and the same idea struck him too; but Binny got there
first and continued sitting on the envelope, until, for very shame, I
asked Ann, the maid, to spread a newspaper and try them with potato
and gravy. They looked at it and then at me, and then, without tast-
ing, walked off and began their usual after-luncheon ablutions of
mouth, face and paws. But, as I have said, I can endure sarcasm.
The next day, just before luncheon, a mass of sparrow feathers was
found on the hall-mat. The second day there were feathers of a black-
bird. And the third day, when I came down to breakfast, I found a
few thrush feathers carelessly left under the breakfast-room table.
I began to search my mind, anxiously wondering whether any of my
near neighbours kept chickens.
But the matter was settled that night. When the dinner-gong
sounded, Binny and Joe rose from their arm-chair, looked at the
vegetarian dishes now adorning a board which had been wont to send
up savoury meaty steams (fish in these parts has become a rarity
almost unprocurable, and we had exhausted our allowance of meat at
luncheon, which we had taken at a restaurant), and then, with noses in
the air and tails erect, stalked haughtily to the drawing-room, and
there remained until dinner was finished.
So now the butcher leaves two penmorth of lights at my door
regularly. He assures me that Lord DEvoNPort won't mind as it is
not strictly human food.

THE WATCH DOGS.
- LVIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Recent events calling
for strong comment, I turned to my friend,
my brick-red friend who is able to retain
his well-fed prosperous look notwithstand-
ing the rigours of trench life, Rrobert James
McGrregor. I took a map with me and, calling
his attention to the general position, asked
him what about it? McGregor, as you may
guess, is a Scot, whose national sense of
economy seems to have spread to his uniform,
in that the cap he wears covers but a third-
part of his head, and his tunic (which I ought
really not to call a tunic but a service jacket)
appears to have exhausted itself I
and its material at the fourth
button. Notwithstanding all this,
I attach great weight to his trucu-
lent views, and, the better to incite
him into something outright, ad-
dressed him in my best Scottish,
which is, at any rate, as good as
his best English. “Rrrrrobert,”
I said, “what like is the voN
HINDENBURG line?” Whereupon
McGregor, helping himself to our
mess whisky and cursing it as the
vilest production of this vile War,
spoke out.
McGregor has no respect what-
ever for HINDENBURG or anything
which is his. He says that HIN-
DENBURG and his crew have all
along taken the line which any
man could, but no gentleman
would. In HINDENBURG he sees
the personification of Prussian
militarism, and for the Prussians
and their militarism he has no use
whatsoever. I forget what exactly
is the Highland phrase for “no use
whatsoever,” but its meaning is
even worse than its sound, and the
sound of it alone is terrible to
hear. Whatever befalls in the in-
terval, it is certain that when at
last McGregor and HINDENBURG
meet they will not get on well to-
gether.
McGregor hates militarism. It
is entirely inconsistent with his
wild ideas of liberty. As such he
is determined to do it down on
all occasions and by every means.
Not only is he a Scot, he is also a
barrister of the most pronounced
type. Brief him in your cause,
and provided it is not a mean one
he will set out to lay flat the
whole earth, if need be, in its
even the most deserving General must pause on and on. We've got to work through all
and ask himself if it is humanly possible to the other Germans, says he, before we'll get
merit such respect as it indicates. No man,
even upon the most legitimate instance, may
venture, in the presence of the dangerous
McGregor, the id: criticism of the British
Army or of anything remotely appertaining
thereto. He will not even permit a sly dig,
in a quiet corner, at the Staff.
Nevertheless McGregor hates, loathes and
detests militarism. His convictions are quite
clear and convincing. Soldiers are one thing;
militarists are another. Rrobert James Mc-
Grregor, for the moment at least, is by
the grace of God and the generosity of His
Majesty a soldier. That creature HINDENBURG

A ‘ PIG IN A POKE," BUT AH 'LL RISK IT."
to their militarists, who are all alive and doing
nicely, thank you, behind. When we are
getting near the throat of the first of them
then the War will end.
McGregor cannot bring himself to detest all
the Bosches. After all, he says, they do stick
it out, and their very stupidity makes some
call on his generosity. But HINDENBURG, he
is convinced, never stuck anything out, except
snubs from his competitor, WILHELM, in the
course of his uprising career; he makes no
call on anybody's generosity, taking every-
thing he wants, including (says McGregor) the
best cigars. Without ever having studied
them closely, McGregor has the
most precise ideas of HINDEN-
BURG's daily life and habits. He
is quite sure he smokes all day
the most expensive cigars, without
paying for them or removing the
bands. He rose, says McGregor,
by artifice combined with ostenta-
tion. While his good soldiers were
studying their musketry, he was
practising ferocious expressions
before his glass. If he ever did
get mixed up in a real battle (which
McGregor doubts) he was un-
doubtedly last in and first out.
However it may appear in print,
his military career would not bear
close scrutiny; for that reason
McGregor does not propose to
scrutinise it. And as for his in-
domitable will, he sees nothing to
admire in the man's persistence,
since, when he stops persisting,
he'll become ungummed and, at
the best, forgotten.
So said McGregor, and when I
besought him to come to the point,
he said he’d dealt with it, and if
I had any sympathy left for HIN-
DENBURG or his line I was no
better than a slave-driving, sit-at-
home-and-push-others-over-the-
parapet Prussian militarist myself.
As for the map, it didn't matter
in the least where HINDENBURG
took his old lime to, since wherever
in Europe it endeavoured to con-
ceal itself his own little line would
scent it out and follow it. And
if the HINDENBURG line was more
than two hundred miles long and
the Rrobert James McGrregor
line less than two hundred yards,
still it didn't matter; for when
a Scot takes a dislike to somebody,
that somebody's number is up.

with the mere ferocity of his mien; he will what about the line?. He helped himself to
Quite so, I agreed; but then
overbear the Judge himself with the mere
power of his lungs, and he will carry you
through to a verdict with the mere momentum
of his loyal support. Once he has made a
cause his own, no other cause can survive the
terror of his bushy eyebrows and his flaring
face. He is a caged lion, but he does not
grow thin or wasted in captivity. As ever, he
grows stout and strong on his own enthusiasms.
The cage will not hold much longer. Heaven
be praised, it's HINDENBURG and not me he's
taken a dislike to. .
He loathes militarism. Having waited
nearly thirty years for a fight, it's himself
is overjoyed that he has Prussian militarism
for the victim of his murderous designs. To
this end he has become a soldier, such a
bloodthirsty soldier as never was before and
mever will be again. The thoroughness of it,
for an anti-militarist, is almost appälling."
The click of his heels and the shine of his
buttons frighten me. His salute is such that
some more whisky, showing that he could
forgive anybody anything except a Prussian
his militarism, and said he was coming to
that. But first as to HINDENBURG.
The man represents his type and is, says
McGregor, a mere bully. He has become a
bully because he could succeed as nothing else.
Given peace, it is doubtful if he could get and
keep the job of errand-boy in a second-rate
butcher's shop. Lacking the intelligence or
spirit to succeed normally, he has not the
decency to live quietly in the cheaper suburbs
of Berlin and let other people do it. Flourish
they must, HINDENBURG and his lot, and so
the world is at war to keep their end up.
Now, says McGregor, it is undoubtedly
sinful to fight, but he can't help half forgiving
those whose desire to have a round is such
that they must needs cause the bothers. But
do I suppose that HINDENBURG ever wanted
to fight, ever meant or ever means to do it?
Not he , and that is why the War goes on and
McGregor didn't say that last, but he looked
it. Yours ever, HENRY.

Will you learn Esperanto at Eton?

Be sent to grow apples or wheat on
A ranche in the ultimate West?

In civics or commerce or stinks?

Or think as the Humanist thinks?
Will you learn to play tennis from Covex
Or model your stroke on JAY Gould 2

And links from the landscape have vanished
To pasture the sheep and the cow?
Your taste in the region of letters
I only can dimly foresee,
But guess that from metrical fetters
The verse you'll affect must be free;
And I sham't be surprised or astounded
If your generation rebels
Against adulation unbounded
Of MASEFIELD and BENNETT and WELLs.

Your uncle has booked you at Lord's,
But I doubt if you'll sate your ambition
Athletic on well-levelled swards;
No, I rather opine that you'll follow
The lead that we owe to the WRIGHTs,
And soar like the eagle or swallow
On far and adventurous flights.
But no matter—in joy and affliction,
In seasons of failure or fame,
I cherish the certain conviction
You'll never dishonour your name;
For the love of the mother that bore you,

'Errivets was putty, 'er plates was poor,
And then come in the PLIMsoll line
Or I wouldn't be singin' this song o' mine.
(Let 'er go!)
She was cranky an' foul, she was stubborn an'
slow
(Let 'er go—let 'er go),
An' she shipped it green when it come on to

"Er crews was starved an' their wage was low,
An 'er bloomin' owners was ready to faint
At a scrape o' pitch or a penn'orth o' paint.
(Let 'er go!)
But she's been 'ere an' she's been there
(Let 'er go—let 'er go),
An' she's been almost everywhere;
An' wherever you went you'd sure see 'er,
With 'er rust-red hawse an' 'er battered old
funnel,
All muck an' dirt from 'er keel to 'er gun’le.
(Let 'er go!)
She's earmed 'er keep in a number o' climes
(Let 'er go—let 'er go);
She's changed 'er name a number o’ times,
Which won't fit right into these 'ere rhymes,
But the name of 'er now is the Sound o' Mull,
Built on the Tyne an' sails out of 'Ull.
(Let 'er go!)
"Er keel was laid in 'seventy-four
(Let 'er go—let 'er go),
An' a breaker's price was 'er price before
The ships was scarce an' the freights did soar;
But she's fetched 'er fourteen pound a ton
On the Baltic Exchange since the War begun.
(Let 'er go!)
So she's doin' 'er bit, which we all must do
(Let 'er go—let 'er go),
An' whether she's old or whether she's new
Don't make much odds to a war-time crew,
But 'ooever's sunk or ’ooever's drowned,
The Sound o' Mull keeps pluggin' around.
(Let 'er go!)
An' when she goes, by night or by day
(Let 'er go—let 'er go),
Either up or down, as she likely may,
I only 'ope as someone'll say:
“’Er keel was laid in 'seventy-four;
She done 'er best an’ she couldn't do more;
She warn’t no swell an' she warm't no beauty,
But she come by 'er end in the way of 'er duty.”

Well, as I was saying, we were about a
'undred-and-fifty mile from the nearest land,
which 'ud be the West coast of Greenland,
bearin’ about E. by N., when we thought that
at last we were going’ to get one back on the
old man. It was this way. One bitter cold
night 'e was makin' 'is way aft to turn in,

full bucket with two pair o' tongs, 'olding a

nounced that another order prohibiting

House cheered, for, as a journalist Mem-
ber remarked with gloomy satisfaction,
“It is only fair that “no posters' should
be followed by no hoarding.’”
The PRIME MINISTER paid one of his
angelic visits to the House to give the
latest information of the revolution in
Russia. His description of it as “one
of the landmarks in the history of the
world” evoked loud cheers, but even
louder were those which came from the
Nationalist benches when he remarked
that “free peoples are the best defenders
of their own honour.”
Tuesday, March 20th.-A long cross-
examination of the representative of
the Air Board produced one valuable
statement which Members generally
might bear in mind. Mr. BILLING
asked if it was not “in the public
interest or in the interests of this
House” that certain contracts should
be discussed. Fixing him with his
eye-glass, Major BAIRD replied, “No,
the interests of the House and of the
public, I take it, are the same as the
interests of the nation.”
If there was any lingering doubt as
to the main responsibility for the in-
ception—as apart from the carrying out
—of the Dardanelles affair Mr. CHURCH-
ILL himself must have removed it. Un-
like his former chief he welcomes the .
publication of the Report, which in his "
opinion has shared among a number of
eminent personages a burden formerly
borne by himself alone. But his en-
thusiasm for the project as it originally
formed itself in his fertile brain is un-
diminished, and he still marvels that for the
want of a little further sacrifice we should
have abandoned the chance of cutting Turkey
out of the War, and uniting in one friendly
federation the States of the Balkans.
Wednesday, March 21st.—General MAUDE's
manifesto to the people of Baghdad, with its
allusions to the tyranny under which they had
long been suffering, did not escape the eagle
eye of Mr. DEvlin, ever anxious to scarify
British hypocrisy. So he drafted a long
question to the PRIME MINISTER, embodying
the most salient passages of the manifesto.
Much to his disgust it appeared on the Paper
without its “most beautiful and striking pas-
sages.” The SPEAKER explained that he had
blue-pencilled “a good deal of Oriental and
flowery language not suitable to our Western
climate.” Not the least part of the joke is
the rumour that the manifesto was largely the
work of a Member of the House well versed
in Eastern lore.

Lord Robert CECIL's-statement that some
seven years ago Sir Exite drew up a memoran-

country from Germany as further evidence of
his duplicity. The rest of the world will re-
joice at Lord Robert's spirited vindication of
“one of the ablest of our public servants,”
who, despite Miss CHRISTABEL PANKHURST, is
not one of “the three black crows” of legen-
dary fame.
When Sir H. DALzier, at the outset of his

“I FEEL regular down this morning, Sir,”
said Private Thomas Weeks, as I seated my-
self beside his bed; “regular down, I do.”
It was such a very unusual greeting from
this source that I said anxiously, “Not the
leg gone wrong?”
“No, the old leg's fine. It's the stopping
of the imports.” He indicated the morning
paper which he had just laid aside. “It’s
just about bust up my old business.”
I took the paper and glanced down the
list of prohibited articles. Clocks and parts
thereof, perfumery, and quails (live) caught my
eye. I didn't think it could be any of these.
“What was your business?” I asked.
“Fruit merchant, Sir. Barrow trade, you
understand. 'Awker, some calls it. But it
don't much matter now what it's called, 'cos
it's bust up.”
“Not quite bust up, is it?” I said.

“Well, it was like this. I bin callin' fruit
a good many years. I could call fruit with any-
one. When I calls ‘’Oo sez a blood orange?'
at Kennington Lane, you could 'ear it pretty
well as far as New Cross. Same with ‘’Ave a

But eight come out o' that dug-out with their
'ands ºup. I sent Sam off 'ome with 'em,
though they'd 'a' gone with no escort at all, I
reckon, bein’sort o' stunned. And I went on
down the trench. -
“At the turn there was another dug-out.
: 'Ave a banana.” I yells, and out come ten of
'em, cryin' for mercy, I took 'em back to
what we calls Petticoat Lane and 'ands 'em
over and come up again. But I didn't get no
more barrow-work that day, and my D.C.M.
was for them prisoners right enough. So now
you see what I feels like about the fruit busi-
ness. It's like an old pal bein’ done in.”
“I shouldn't worry too much about it,” I
said. “You’ve each had a bit of a knock-
out; but you'll soon be on your legs again,
and so will your barrow, and going strong,
both of you.”

(Dr. GEORG BIEDENKAPP, writing in the Münch-

any famous “Englishman', you find that he really
comes from Scotland, to which country he assigns
a place with Suabia, Thuringia, and the Hartz

of first-class genius.”)

FRIGHT FULNESS ON THE ALLOTMENTS.
THE HARDSHIPS OF BILLETS.
Jim and me could never 'ave got through the
six weeks we was billeted with Mrs. Sweedle
if we 'adn't been 'ardened by Mrs. Larkins in
the way I 'ave described.
Mrs. Sweedle were a widow woman with a
big family, besides a aged father and a brother
who suffered with fits. The billetin' orficer
was afraid she wouldn't be able to take us in,
but Mrs. Sweedle was willin' and eager.
“Bless their hearts, that I will,” she said;
“it shall never be said I turned a soldier from
my door. Nobody knows better than I do
what soldiers is in an 'ouse. Always merry
and bright and ready to put their 'ands to any-
thing when a poor woman's work's never done
and she's delicate and liable to the sick-'ead-
ache in the mornin's. There's the week's
clothes to go through the wringer, but I know
what soldiers is for a wringer; they can't leave
it alone. And if I 'appens to overlay meself
I know there's no cause to worry about
Grandfer's cup o' tea, nor yet Bobby and Tom
and Albert gettin' off to school tidy. Like as
not they'll do me more credit than if I washed
'em meself; there 's nobody like a soldier for
puttin' a polish on children.”
Mrs. Sweedle overlaid herself the very first
mornin', and sent word by Albert if we would
be so kind as make her a cup o' tea when we
was makin' Grandfer's it might save her a
doctor; and the wood for the fire was out in the
yard, and she knew, bein’ soldiers, we should
chop her a barrer-load while we was about it;
and when she crawled downstairs presently the
breakfast things would be washed and put
away, as was the 'abit of soldiers, and very
likely the pertaters peeled for dinner.
It bein’ a strange 'ouse and we not knowin'
where to put our 'ands on anythin', and, when
we'd got the kettle to boil, not bein’ able to
let it out of our sight owin' to the youngest
little Sweedle wantin' to drink out of the
spout, Jim and me was regler drove. We
was as near late for parade as we 'ave ever
been in our lives. Mrs. Sweedle was very
upset. “I know what soldiers is for punctu-
ality,” she said, “a minute late and they're
court-martialled. How would it be if you
was to lay the fire over-night and scrub over
the floor? It 'ud save ye a lot in the mornin',
if so be I'm forced to keep me bed.”
We done as she advised, and it were fortunate.
She'ad another sick-'eadache the next day, and
sent word by Albert would we be so good as
bake her a mouthful of toast; she knew what
soldiers' toast was like, it give ye a appetite to
look at it, thin and crisp, with the butter laid
on smooth as cream and cut in fingers.
We never run no risk after that. 'Owever
dog-tured we was and 'owever Mrs. Sweedle
seemed in 'ealth we always got the work for-
ward over-night, and when we could catch 'old
of Bobby and Tom and Albert we washed 'em to
save time in the mornin' and parted their 'air.
One day Mrs. Sweedle were well enough to
get up. “I know who's goin' to 'ave a treat
now,” she said. Our 'arts leapt. We did
'ope she might be goin' to say we was to sit
down to our breakfasts.
“Grandfer's goin' to be shaved, and not 'ave
to pay tuppence out of 'is poor pension,” she
said. “There's nobody can shave like a sol-
dier.” And when Jim 'ad got the old man by
the nose she said to me, “I can see what you
want to be at, shakin' these mats with your
strong arm and savin' me comin' on giddy.”
It were very 'ard at first, but after a bit Jim
and me got into the work at Mrs. Sweedle's
and was just able to get through with it,
except the mornin' her brother 'ad a fit when
we was racin' to finish the washin'-up. That
fair broke our backs. We 'ad a sort of seizure
on parade and 'ad to fall out till we got our
breaths back.
THE RECOGNISED.
GIVE ear to my words and you shall hear
The song of the British Volunteer,
Who started out when the War began
As a middle-aged mostly grey-haired man.
Too old to be sent to join the dance
Of the doughty fellows who fought in France,
He refused to go on the dusty shelf,
And he set to work and he bought himself
A spirited grey-green uniform, -
With a cap to match and a British warm,
And he took his fill
Of the latest drill;
But somehow they didn't seem to prize him
Or wish in the least to recognise him.
But now they have let him cast away
His excellent clothes of green and grey;
They think they can use him,
And don't refuse him,
And they've dressed him up and they've
dressed him down
In a regular suit of khaki brown;
He has been gazetted
And properly vetted
As able to march five miles at least,
Though he puffs a bit when the speed's in-
creased ;
And he can double
Without much trouble,
And do such deeds as a man must do
Who is willing to help to see things through.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Alfred Lyttelton : An Account of his Life, by Edith LYTTELTON
(LoNG MANs), is a most fascinating book. Mrs. ALFRED LYTTELTON
might perhaps have contented herself with writing a formal biography
of her husband. It would have been difficult for her, but she might,
as I say, have done it. Instead of this she takes her readers by the
hand in the friendliest manner and admits them with her into the heart
and soul of the man with whom she was for twenty years associated.
She shows him as what he was, a noble and upright English
gentleman, straightforward and tender-hearted, and beloved in a
quite exceptional measure by all who were privileged to be his friends.
I can only be grateful to Mrs. LYTTELTON for having interpreted her
duty in this manner, and for having carried it out with so sure
a hand. As I read her pages I saw again in my mind's eye the
loose-limbed, curly-headed young son of Anak as he swung down Jesus
Lane, Cambridge, or as he witched the world with noble cricketing
at Fenner's or at Lord's. It is good to be able to remember him. His
Eton tutor described him as being “like a running stream with the
sun on it,” and there was, indeed, a charm
about him that was irresistible. Mrs. LYTTEL-
ToN devotes a beautiful chapter to the memory
of ALFRED's first wife, LAURA, who died after
one short year of happiness. “She was a
flame,” says Mrs. LYTTELTON, “beautiful,
dancing, ardent, leaping up from the earth in
joyous rapture, touching everyone with fire as
she pass The wind of life was too fierce for
such a spirit—she could not live in it. Surely
it was Love that gathered her.” I have only
one little bone to pick, and that not with Mrs.
LYTTELTON, but with Lord MIDLEToN, who in
a page or two of reminiscences describes as
one of ALFRED's triumphs at the Bar his
appearance as counsel for the Warden of
Merton, Mr. GEORGE BRODRICK. The Warden,
having said something offensive about Mr.
DILLON, was hailed before the Parnell Com-
mission for contempt of court. ALFRED put
in an affidavit by the Warden, in which the
whole thing was said to be a joke, and in his
speech he chaffed Mr. REID (now Lord LoRE-
BURN), who was counsel for Mr. DILLON, for
being a Scotsman, with a natural incapacity
for seeing a joke. So far Lord MIDLETON ;
but he omits Mr. REID's crushing retort.
“Even a Scotsman,” said Mr. REID, “may
be pardoned for not seeing a joke which has to
be certified by affidavit.” -
Mr. JEFFERY E. JEFFERY has been playing
cheerful tricks on the British public. We must
forgive him, because he has for a long time been
doing far worse than that to the Huns; but it
is undeniable that in following the winding

heroine, and we should have missed a very agreeable study of expand-
ing adolescence. This, I take it, is the real motive of Mr. BERESFORD's
story, as exemplified by his pleasant introductory metaphor of the
chicken and the egg. From the feminine point of view, indeed, the
tale might be not inaptly labelled “Treatise on Cub-hunting.” Any-
how, what with strange actresses and I.D.B. criminals and painted
ladies and reviewers (they were a queer lot at No. 731) the hero com-
pletes his tenancy with enough experience of life, chiefly on its shadowy
side, to last him for some time. An original and rather appealing
story, told with a good deal of charm.
I was waiting for it, and now, behold, it has come. In The Shin-
ing Heights (MILLS AND Boon) the War is over and we have to do
with some of the results of it. Unfortunately Miss I. A. R. WYLIE
is very chary about dates, and she is not encouraging about the
changes which most of us hope will come with peace. “Social con-
ditions indeed,” she writes, “ had scarcely moved. Universal brother-
hood was not . . . and, for the vast majority of men and women it
had been easiest to go back to the old work, the old pleasure,
the old love and the old hate.” Well, I
don't know much about universal brother-
hood, but for the rest I sincerely hope that
these gloomy prognostications are wrong.
As for the story, laid in the Delectable
Duchy, no one needs to be told that Miss
WYLIE is a movelist of considerable power and
capacity, and here she has chosen a theme of
very real interest. It is the rivalry of two
men, one of whom had returned from the War
with wounds and a W.C., while the other had
never taken part in it because he believed
(with justification) that he was on the point
of making a discovery of value to humanity.
The story is well constructed and well told,
but I am beginning tº think that it is time

volume of them is My Remembrances (CASSELL),
in which Mr. Edward H. SoTHERN recounts,
with the pleasant humour to be expected from
him, what he quaintly (and quite unjustifiably)
calls “The Melancholy Tale of Me.” One has
heard that Mr. SoTHERN, now that he has
retired from the stage, proposes to live in
England; the book explains such an intention
by its evidence of the writer's intense love for
this country. Naturally he has a rich stock of
good stories, amongst which I was delighted
to welcome yet once again that old favourite
about the departing spectator who, on being
told that two Acts remained to be performed,
said briefly, “That's why I'm going !”

danger of losing our sense of direction. This is
because along with imaginary tales, some of them written before August,
1914, when of course he could not fix precisely the chronology and
locality of his fights, he has mixed almost indiscriminately the record
of his own actual experiences during two distinct phases of the War.
Not until the last page does he abandon the jest to explain—with some-
thing of a school-boy grin—just where fact and fiction meet, and so
enable me to recover from my bewilderment and pass on a word of
Servants of the Guns (SMITH, ELDER), and more especially the first
half of it (dealing, in diary form, with his recent adventures as an
officer of Artillery—he does not state his present rank), as vivid and
real as anything of the sort you have seen. Field-gun warfare of
time dash and jingle than the hope that some to-morrow may revive
them in the Great Pursuit—this is his theme; and above all the
loyalty of the gunner to his guns. Even the story-book part in the
middle of the volume speaks of this finely and movingly; but here
and there amongst his personal experiences comes a passage less con-
sciously composed that tells it even better in the bareness of a great
simplicity.
Mr. J. D. BEREspoºn's new story, House-Mates (CAssell), might be
regarded as an awful warning to young gentlemen seeking bachelor-
apartments. Because, if the hero had been a little more careful about
his fellow-lodgers at No. 73 Keppel Street, he would not, in the first
place, have been defrauded of a large sum of money, or, in the second,
have been involved in a peculiarly revolting murder. (The special hate-
fulness of this murder strikes me as rather superfluous. But this by the
I told how the elder Soth ERN's triumph was
actually the result of JEFFERSoN's partiality for horse-exercise. . The
connection I leave you to find out. Like all volumes of its kind,
My Remembrances abounds in photographs. At times, indeed, you
may be tempted to consider that the domain of the family portrait
album has been too largely usurped. But there is even about this
a friendliness which, coupled with the brisk style of its writing,
will give the book a popularity as wide as that of its author.
We all know that Mr. WILLIAM CAINE has a gay humour, and he
indulges it liberally, sometimes rollickingly, in The Fan. With a
candour which I warmly commend. he states conspicuously that
most of these stories have appeared before, and he expresses his
acknowledgments to various Editors, over a widish range-from
Macmillan's Magazine to London Opinion, and from The English
Review to Answers.
guess which story was written for which Editor. But for whatever
public the author caters he is, with only one or two exceptions, out for
fun, and he gets it. Some of his stories are pure extravaganzas, but
they are written in a style unusually good for this kind, and by a very
shrewd observer of human foibles. Messrs. METHUEN tell us that
Mr. CAINE “views life from an angle all his own,” and although I do
not often find myself in agreement with publishers' opinions of their
own wares it is to me a right angle.

THE HOHENZOLLERN PROSPECT.
REFLECTIONs of THE HEIR-APPARENT.
WHEN I've surveyed with half-shut eyes,
Over the winking Champagne wine,
What I shall do when Father dies
And hands me down his right divine,
Often I've said that, when in God's
Good time he goes, I mean to show 'em
How scorpions sting in place of rods,
Taking my cue from REHOBOAM.
But now with Liberty on the loose,
And All the Russias capped in red,
And Demos hustling like the deuce,
And Tsardom's day as good as dead—
When on the Dynasty they dance -
And with the Imperial Orb play hockey,
I feel that LITTLE WILLIE's chance
Looks, at the moment, rather rocky.
Not that the Teuton's stolid wits
Are built to plan so rude a plot;
Somehow I cannot picture Fritz
Careering as a sansculotte ;
Schooled to obedience, hand and heart,
I can imagine nothing odder
Than such behaviour on the part
Of inoffensive cannon fodder.
And yet one never really knows.
You cannot feed his massive trunk
On fairy tales of beaten foes
Or HINDENBURG's “victorious" bunk;
And if his rations run too short
Through this accurséd British blockade
Even the worm may turn and sport
A revolutionary cockade.
Well, at the worst, I have my loot;
And if, in search of healthier air,
We Hohenzollerns do a scoot,
There's wine and women everywhere;
And, for myself, I frankly own
A taste for privacy; I should rather
Not face the high light on a throne—
But O my poor, my poor old Father O. S.

THE French are a great people; the more I see of them

reply to their charming compliments in a mixture of Gaelic
and CoRNELIUS NEPOs. I myself had no intention of
babbling these jargons; it is the fault of my tongue, which
takes charge on these occasions, and seems to be under the
impression that, when it is talking to a foreigner, any foreign
language will do. -
Atkins, I notice, also suffers from a form of the same
delusion. When talking to a Frenchman, he employs a
mangled cross between West Coast and China pidgin, and
by placing a long E at the end of every word imagines he
is making himself completely clear to the suffering Gaul.
And the suffering Gaul listens to it all with incredible
patience and courtesy, and, what is more, somehow or other
disentangles a meaning, thereby proving himself the most
intelligent creature on earth.
We have always prided ourselves that the teaching of
modern languages in our island seminaries is unique; but
such is not the case. Here and there in France, apparently,
they teach English on the same lines. I discovered this, the
other day, when we called on a French battery to have the
local tactical situation explained to us. I was pushed for-
ward as the starlinguist of our party; the French produced
a smiling Captain as theirs. The non-combatants of both
sides then sat back and waited for their champions to begin.
I felt a trifle nervous myself, and the Frenchman didn't
seem too happy. We filled in a few minutes bowing,
saluting, kissing and shaking hands, and then let Babel
loose, I in my fourth-form French, and he, to my amazement,
in equally elementary English. The affair looked hopeless
from the start; if either of us would have consented to talk
in his own language, the other might have understood him,
but neither of us could, before that audience, with our
reputations at stake.
Towards lunch-time things grew really desperate; we
had got as far as “the pen of my female cousin,” but the
local tactical situation remained as foggy as ever, our
backers were showing signs of impatience, and we were
both lathering freely. Then by some happy chance we
discovered we had both been in Africa, fell crowing into
each other's arms, and the local tactical situation was
cleared “one time" in flowing Swahili. Our respective
reputations as linguists are now beyond doubt.
We became fast friends, this Captain and I. He bore
me off to his cellar, stood me the usual six-course feed
(with wines), and after it was over asked how I would like
to while away the afternoon. I left it in his hands. “Eh
bien, let us play on the Bosch a little,” he suggested. It
sounded as pleasant a light after-dinner amusement as any,
so I bowed and we sallied forth.
He led me to his observation post, spoke down a tele-
phone, and about twenty yards of Hun parapet were not.
“That will spoil his siesta,” said my Captain. “By the
way, his Headquarters is behind that ruined farm.”
“Which 2" I inquired; there were several farms about,
none of them in any great state of repair.
“I will show you—watch,” he replied, talked into the
'phone again, and far away a cloud, a cloud of brick dust,
smoked aloft. “ Voilà l''
He thereupon pointed out all the objects of local interest
in the same fashion.
“We will now give him fifty rounds for luck, and then
we will return to my cellar for a cup of coffee,” said he, and
a further twenty yards of Hun parapet were removed.
Suddenly there came an answering salvo from Hunland,
and a flock of shells whizzed over our heads.
“Tiens!” my Captain exclaimed. “He has lost his
little temper, has he? Naughty, naughty! I must give
him a slap. A hundred rounds!” he shouted into the
'phone, and the German lines spouted like a school of
whales blowing.
Again the Bosch slammed across a heavy reply. My
Captain leapt to his 'phone. “He would answer me back,
would he? The impudence I Give him a thousand rounds,
my children!"
Then for the next hour or so the sky was filled with a
screaming tornado of shells, rushing, bumping, and burst-
ing, and the Bosch lines sagged, bulged, quivered, slopped
over, and were spattered against the blue in small
smithereens.
“And now let us see what he says to that,” said my
Captain pleasantly. We waited, we watched, we listened;
but there came no reply (possibly because there was no one
left to make one), and my Captain turned to me, shoulders
shrugged, palms outspread, a grimace of apologetic disgust

Certainly Hans the Hun does not seem to be enjoying
the same high spirits he did of yore. Possibly he is be-
ginning to regret the day he left the old beer garden, his
ample Gretchen, and the fatty foods his figure demands.
The story of Patrick and Goldilocks would tend to prove as
much. - -
The other day Patrick was engaged in one of those little
“gains" which straighten out the unsightly kinks in the
“ line" and give the War-correspondents a chance to get
their names in print.
Patrick and his friends attacked in a snowstorm, dropped
into a German post, gave the occupants every assistance in
evacuating, and prepared to - - - - - - -
make themselves at home.
While they were clearing up
the mess, they found they had
taken a prisoner, a blond Ba-
varian hero who had found it
impossible to leave with his
friends on account of half-a-
ton of sandbags on his chest.
They excavated him, told him
if he was a good boy they'd
give him a ticket to Doning-
ton Hallat nightfall, christened
him Goldilocks for the time
being, and threw him some
rations, among which was a
tin of butter. |
He listened to all they had Hiſ
to say in a dazed sulky fashion, | *-
but at the sight of the tin of
butter he gurgled drunkenly
and seemed to go light-headed.
He spent a perfect day revel-
ling in the joys of anticipa-
tion, crooning over that butter,
cuddling it, hiding it in one
pocket after the other. To-
wards dusk down came the
snow again, and under cover
thereof the Bosch counter-
attacked.
Patrick says he suddenly
heard the bull voice of a Hun
officer hic-coughing gutturals,
and they were on him. He -
had no time to send up an S.O.S. rocket, and his machine-
gun jammed. In a minute they were all mixed up, at it
tooth and claw as merry as a Galway election, the big
Bosch officer, throwing off a hymn of hate, the life and
soul of the party. He came for Patrick with an automatic,
and Patrick thought all was up; and so it would have
been but for Goldilocks, who materialized suddenly out
of nowhere, deftly tripped up his officer from behind, and,
dancing on his stomach with inspired hooves, trod him
out of sight.
Their moving spirit being wiped out, the Huns lost
whatever heart they had had, and went through their
“Kamerad" exercise without further ado. -
When the excitement was over Patrick sought out
Goldilocks, and, shaking him warmly by the hand, thanked
him for suppressing the officer and saving the situation.

She had so many children she didn't

She gave them some broth without any

So as not to exceed her allowance per
head.
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cup-
board
To get her poor dog a bone;
But when she got there the cupboard
was bare,
And so the poor dog had none.
She went to the kitchen and scolded

Who answered, “All bones must be

V.
THE RIVALs.
THE frog challenged the nightingale
to a singing contest. “Of course for
gurgling and untutorod warbling I know
he has it,” he said to his friend the
toad, “but in technique I shall beat
him hollow.”
So the jury was chosen. The night-
ingale proposed the lark, the thrush,
the blackbird and the bullfinch as ex-
perts in singing, and the frog proposed
the starling, the linnet, the chaffinch
and the reed-warbler.
The nightingale was overcome with
cmotion at the generosity of the frog,
and insistcd on adding the crow and
the toad as experts in croaking.
The nightingale sang first, whilst his
trade rivals sat and chattered. They
chattered so loud that the nightingale
stopped singing in a huff.
“You are hardly at your best, you
know, old thing,” said the linnet sym-
pathetically.
“You will find these throat lozenges
cxcellent for hoarseness,” said the
blackbird.
“His upper register is weak—abom-
inably weak,” said the starling to the
lark.
“Perhaps if his voice were trained,”
suggested the lark.
Meanwhile the frog croaked away
lustily, but no one listened to him.
“The jury must vote by ballot,” he
said as he finished the last croak.
“Of course we must,” twittered the
Jury.
| Tho frog won by eight votes to
two.
“I voted for the nightingale,” whis-
pered the crow to the toad.
“So did I,” whispered the toad.
A LOSS.
For many reasons the passing of
the poster is to be welcomed. For
one thing, it robbed the papers them-
selves of that element of surprise
which is one of life's few spices; for
another, it added to life's many com-
plexities by forcing the reader into a
hunt through the columns which often
ended in disappointment: in other
words the poster's promise was not
seldom greater than the paper's per-
formance. Then, again, it was often
offensive, as when it called for the
impeachment of an effete “old gang,”
many of whose members had joined
the perfect new; or redundant, as when
it demanded twenty ropes where one
would have sufficed.
But, even although the streets may
be said to have been sweetened by
the absence of posters, days will come,
it must be remembered, when we shall
badly miss them. It goes painfully to
one's heart to think that the embargo,
if it is ever lifted, will not be lifted in
time for most of the events which we
all most desire, events that clamour
to be recorded in the large black type
that for so many years Londoners have
associated with fatefulness. Cuch as

FRITZ'S APOLOGIA.
YEs, war is horrible and hideous—
It jars upon my sense fastidious,
My “noble instincts,” to decline
To actions that are not divine.
So, when I mutilate your pictures,
So far from meriting your strictures,
Compassion rather is my due
For doing what I hate to do.
It grieves my super-saintly soul
Even to smash a china bowl;
To carry off expensive clocks
My tender conscience sears and shocks;
I really don't enjoy at all
Hacking to bits a panelled hall,
Rare books with priceless bindings
burning,
Or boudoirs into cesspools turning.
My heart invariably bleeds
When I'm engaged upon these deeds,
And teardrops of the largest size
Fall from my heav'n-aspiring eyes.
But, though my sorrow is unfeigned,
Still discipline must be maintained;
And, when the High Command says,
“Smash,
Bedaub with filth, loot, hack and
slash,” -
I do it (much against the grain)
Because, though gentle and humane,
When dirty work is to be done
I always am a docile Hun.

shire householders bones and fat for the ex-

So as to give her employer something

“‘Baghdad' written large on the wall of

office, now deserted, there had been a rush for

ADMIRAL DUGOUT.
HE had done with fleets and squadrons, with the restless
roaming seas,
He had found the quiet haven he desired,
And he lay there to his moorings with the dignity and ease
Most becoming to Rear-Admirals (retired);
He was bred on “Spit and Polish"—he was reared to
“Stick and String"—
All the things the ultra-moderns never name;
But a storm blew up to seaward, and it meant the Real
Thing,
And he had to slip his cable when it came. -
So he hied him up to London for to hang about Whitehall,
And he sat upon the steps there soon and late,
He importuned night and morning, he bombarded great
and small,
From messengers to Ministers of State;
He was like a guilty conscience, he was like a ghost unlaid,
He was like a debt of which you can't get rid,
Till the Powers that Be, despairing, in a fit of temper said,
“For the Lord's sake give him something"—and they did.
They commissioned him a trawler with a high and raking
bow,
Black and workmanlike as any pirate craft,
With a crew of steady seamen very handy in a row,
And a brace of little barkers fore and aft;
And he blessed the Lord his Maker when he faced the North
Sea sprays
And exceedingly extolled his lucky star
That had given his #3. renewal in the evening of his days
(With the rank of Captain Dugout, R.N.R.).
He is jolly as a sandboy, he is happier than a king,
And his trawler is the darling of his heart
(With her cuddy like a cupboard where a kitten couldn't
swing,
And a smell of fish that simply won't depart);
He has found upon occasion sundry targets for his guns;
He could tell you tales of mine and submarine;
Oh, the holes he's in and out of and the glorious risks he
runs .
Turn his son—who's in a Super-Dreadnought—green.
He is fit as any fiddle; he is hearty, hale and tanned;
He is proof against the coldest gales that blow;
He has never felt so lively since he got his first command
(Which is rather more than forty years ago);
And of all the joyful picnics of his wild and wandering
youth—
Little dust-ups from Taku to Zanzibar—
There was none to match the picnic, he declares in sober
sooth,
That he has as Captain Dugout, R.N.R. C. F. S.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 26th.-Major PRETY-
MAN NEwMAN has a bright sense of
humour much appreciated by his fellow-
countrymen from Ireland. His latest
notion is that journals “of a comic and
serio-comic nature” should be deprived
of their stocks of paper in order that
catalogues and circulars should con-
tinue to appear. Mr. GEORGE RoPERTs
expressed his regret at being unable to
discriminate between different classes
of publications; but I understand that
several Members have offered to satisfy
Major NEWMAN's taste for light litera-
ture by lending him their old Stores
catalogues.
Housewives who have been econo-
mising in their meagre supply of sugar
in order to have a stock for jam-making
have been alarmed by a rumour that
they would be charged with food-hoard-
ing and made to disgorge their savings.
There is not a word of truth in it,
and they may rest assured, on Capt.
BATHURST's authority, that our non-
party Government entirely approves
this form of Conservatism.
Misled by Mr. BRACE's appearance—
I have before now noted his likeness to
an amiable cat—Mr. S.Now DEN pressed
his advocacy of a certain conscientious
objector called PETT to such lengths as
to discover that even this kind of cat has
claws. “These conscientious
objectors,” said Mr. BRACE at
last, “are not the angels he
thinks they are, and it is only
with the utmost difficulty that
a large number of them will
do anything like reasonable
work.” Thus a PETT illusion
has been shattered. Mr. S.Now-
DEN, however, has plenty more. .
Tuesday, March 27th.-If \º
British artisans, as at Barrow-
in-Furness, prefer to strike for
Germany, it seems hardly
reasonable to expect German
prisoners to work for Eng-
land. The nature of the “dis-
ciplinary measures” which
caused the Germans promptly
to return to work on normal
conditions was not disclosed,
but it seems a pity that they
are not tried in the other case.
“We are getting on,” as Sir HENRY
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN said on a famous
occasion. Formerly it was considered
the height of Parliamentary impropriety
to say in so many words that an Hon.
Member was not telling the truth; and
all sorts of more or less transparent
subterfuges, of which Mr. CHURCHILL's
“ terminological inexactitude” is the
best remembered, were employed to
evade this breach of good manners.

A little later on, Mr. Swift MACNEILL,
MR. BRACE.
always a stickler for constitutional pre-
cedent, attacked the Government for
introducing important Bills—including
one for extending once more the life of
this immortal Parliament — without
vouchsafing any explanation of them.
He appealed to the SPEAKER to con-
demn this procedure as being contrary
to the spirit of the standing order. Mr.

the use that was made of them. But
he ventured to remind the Hon. Member
that under this rule a Home Rule Bill,
a Welsh Disestablishment Bill and a

duced on a single day. And it is not
on record that on that occasion Mr.
MACNEILL entered any protest.

attendance of Members, Peers and the
general public. The interval of waiting
was beguiled by, among others, Mr.
PEMBERTON BILLING, who, having been
told by Mr. MACPHERSON that the num-
ber of accidents during the training of
pilots during the last half-year of 1916
was 1:53 per cent., proceeded to inquire,
“What is the percentage based on ?
Is it percentage per hundred 2" Mr.
BILLING may be comforted by the re-
collection that a greater than he, Lord
RANDoLPH CHURCHILL, confessed that
he “never could understand what those
d—d dots meant.”
The Editor of The Glasgow High
School Magazine must be a proud man
this day, for he has been mentioned in
Parliament. It seems that he has been
refused permission to post his periodical
to subscribers in neutral countries, and
Mr. MACPHERson explained that this
was in pursuance of a general rule,
since “school magazines contain much
information useful to the enemy.” It
is pleasant to picture the German
General Staff laboriously ploughing
through reports of football-matches,
juvenile poems and letters to the Editor
complaining of the rise in prices at the
tuck-shop, in order to discover that
Second-Lieutenant Blank, of the Ump-
tieth Battery, R.F.A., is stationed in
Mesopotamia, and therefrom to deduce
the present distribution of the British
Army.
The SPEAKER occupied the
Chair during the discussion
of the recommendations of his
Conference on Electoral Re-
form, and heard nothing but
good of himself. It was, in-
deed, a notable achievement to
have induced so heterogeneous
a collection of Members to
present a practically unani-
mous report on a bundle of
problems acutely controversial.
Only on one point did the
Conference fail to agree, and
that was in regard to Women's
Suffrage. But, after Mr. As-
QUITH's handsome admission
that, by their splendid services
in the War, women had worked
out their own electoral salva-
tion, even that topic seemed
to have lost, most of its provocative
quality; and there is a general desire to
forget what the late PRIME MINISTER
described as a detestable campaign and
bury the hatchet and all the other
weapons employed in it.

would remember his constituency and

on, occasionally dropping into a vein
of sentiment and working it so hard
that I quite expected to hear him say,
“Gentlemen of the Jury” instead of
“Mr. Speaker.” When it came to the

three-score stalwarts into the Lobby,

in want of agricultural labourers should
apply to Lord NEwToN, who has a large
selection of interned Austrians, Hun-
garians and Turks, and undertakes to
supply an alien “almost by return of
post.” The Turk is specially recom-
mended, as, even if he fails to give
complete satisfaction, the farmer can
relieve the monotony of an arduous
existence by “sitting on the Ottoman.”
Brave man as he is, the Food CoN-
TROLLER is not prepared to prohibit
entirely the manufacture of cakes and
confectionery. But he is preparing to
do something hardly less daring, namely,
to standardize the types that may be
sold.
An old spelling-book used to tell us
that “It is agreeable to watch the un-
paralleled embarrassment of a harassed
pedlar when gauging the symmetry of
a peeled pear.” Lord DEvoNPoRT, oc-
cupied in deciding on the exact archi-
tecture and decoration of the Bath bun
(official sealed pattern), would make a
companion picture. -
The unwillingness of some young
Scottish Members to volunteer for
National Service is now explained. It
seems that by an unpardonable over-
sight the appeals of the DIRECTOR-
GENERAL, as published in the Scottish
newspapers, were addressed “to the

now been altered—not too late, I trust,

IN view of the restriction of the paper
supply it has been suggested that ad-
vertisers should unite in cultivating
the available space on a co-operative
intensive system.
For example, the various proprietors
of three popular brands of cigarettes,
instead of having a page advertisement
each, might combine in one single page,
like this:—

his cigarettes, but he actually gains a

the economic common factor of appeal.

eminently suited to co-operative adver-
tising. We append two samples of
what may be done in this direction.

EARLIER FOOD PROBLEMS.
PEACE, I remember, had her ali-
mentary perplexities not much less
renowned than war. At any rate I
can think of two.
The first was some years ago, in
Yorkshire, on one of those sultry and
stifling days of August which in winter,
or even in such a March as we have
been suffering, one can view as some-
thing more desirable than rubies, but
which in actual fact are depressing,
enervating, and the mother of moodi-
ness and fatigue. We had left Chop
Yat early in the morning after a night
of excessive heat in beds of excessive
featheriness and were walking towards
Helmsley by way of Rievaulx, all un-
concerned as to lunch by the way,
because the ordnance map marked
with such cordial legibility an inn on
the road at a reasonable distance.
Moreover, was not Yorkshire made up
of hospitable ridings, and had we not,
on the previous day, found lunch in
this cottage and tea in that, with no
trouble at all, to say nothing of the
terrific spread confronting us at Chop
Yat 2 Why then carry anything?
But we soon began to regret the
absence of sustenance, for this kind of
weather makes for extreme lassitude
shot through with rattiness, and under
its influence nourishment dies in one
with painful celerity.
The blessed word “inn '' was how-
ever on the ordnance map, and since
it was the one-inch scale that cannot
lie we braced ourselves, mended and
remended our tempers, and plodded on.
The dales no doubt are gorgeous places,
but under this grey humid sky anyone
who wanted it could have had my share
of Billsdale (as Ibelieve it was). Scenery
had become an outrage. There was no
joy, no beauty ; nothing was worth
living for but that inn. As we laboured
forward we cheered each other by word-
pictures of its parlour, its larder and
its cellar. A pork-pie (“porch-peen.” I
fancy the Yorkshiremen call it) would
probably be there. Eggs, of course. A
ham, surely. Bacon, no doubt. Yellow
butter, crusty new bread, and beer. In-
deed, let the rest go, so long as there
was beer. But beer, of course, was
beyond any question ; an inn without
beer was unthinkable.
Thus the miles wore away until,
footsore, sticky and faint, we came
upon the hostelry itself—only to find,
instead of any grateful sign and the
promise of delight, the frigid words,
“Friends' Meeting House,” painted on
the board. . . .
That was one experience, over which
a veil may well be drawn. The other
was not so long ago, in Sussex, a little

before the War. This time we had not
walked, but had done that much more
hungrifying thing — we had been for
hours in a motor-car, exceedingly en-
gaged on the task of looking at houses
to let. At last, utterly worn out, in
the way that motoring can wear out
body, soul and nerves, and filled with
a ravening desire to tear meat limb
from limb, we came to an inn of which
our host had the highest opinion—so
high, indeed, that, empty though we
were, he had forced the car at full-speed
past at least half-a-dozen admirable but
less pretentious houses, where I, in my
small way, had more than once been
nourished and sustained.
When, however, at last we did arrive
at his desired haven, late in the after-
noon, when dusk was beginning to fall
and blur with her gentle hand the sharp
lines of hill and tree, we acknowledged
his wisdom, for in the window beside
the door, where we creakingly but joy-
fully alighted, were visible, although no
longer distinctly, a vast ham as yet un-
cut and two richly-browned cold fowls.
“There,” said he, with a pardonable
triumph, “didn't I tell you?” and so,
our lips trembling with the anticipa-
tion of nutriment, we entered, flung off
our wraps, and prepared, on the evi-
dence, for such bliss as earth too rarely
affords. But alas for hopes raised
only to be shattered, for the host had
nothing to offer us but bread-and cheese.
The ham and chickens were of papier-
maché.

experience.”—Bournemouth Daily Echo.
The inclusion of the functions of a
waiter among “sedentary occupations”
explains a good deal.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM LORD DEVONPORT'S LETTER-BAG.
I.—From Professor Tripewell.
My Lord, You will, no doubt, forgive me for drawing
your attention to the fact that the rationing system, to
which you have lent the credit of your name, will bring us
to the end of our food supplies in something considerably
less than a month from now. I am far from wishing to be
an alarmist, but it is as well that we should face the facts,
especially when they are supported by statistics so irrefut-
able as those which I am willing to produce to you at any
moment on receiving your request to do so.
Fortunately it is not yet too late to apply a simple and
a difficulty under which we are labouring in connection
with your Lordship's order in regard to the consumption of
food. We are two sisters, the daughters of a country clergy-
man, who died when I was eighteen and Penelope a year
and a half younger. . I tell you this to show you that we
were not accustomed in our youth to luxurious living. For
many years now Penelope and I have lived together in a
very small way on the income of an annuity for our joint
lives which was bought with a sum of money left to us by
an uncle. On this we have managed to get along comfort-
ably, and have even been able to pay for occasional help
in the work of our very modest household. When your
Lordship's food order was issued we determined to obey it
adequate remedy to this condition
of affairs. All you have to do is
to issue and enforce an Order in
the following terms:—
(1) Every occasion on which
food, no matter how small the
amount, is eaten shall count as a
meal.
(2) Not more than two meals
shall be eaten by any person, of
whatever size, age or sex, in a day
of twenty-four hours.
(3) No meal shall last more
than ten minutes.
(4) The mastication of every
mouthful shall last not less than
thirty seconds.
(5) A mouthful for the purpose
of this Order shall not consist of
more food than can be conveyed
to the mouth in an ordinary tea-
spoon.
I venture to think that this
order, if issued at once and dras-
tically applied, will meet every
difficulty, and that we shall hear
no more of a shortage.

bread-and-butter and cheese. Tea, of course, at five o'clock,
with more buttered toast, and then home to a good solid din-
ner of soup, fish and entrée and joint and some sort of sweet.

“It will be hard for us, Penelope,”
I said, “for we are not used to

the allowance of bread is too great,
I fear, for our poor appetites; but,
since Lord DEvoNPoRT wishes it,
all we can do is to obey, even
though this may entail a change

Penelope agreed, and on this prin-
ciple we have endeavoured to act.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. CoNRAD's new hero is an unnamed chief-mate who
gets his first command to a sailing vessel, also unnamed—
a queer and of course quite deliberate instance of the
author's reticent, allusive method which is so entirely
plausible. Her last captain, who had some mad savage
hatred of ship and crew, died aboard her and was buried in
latitude 8° 20'. The chief-mate, who got the vessel back to
port and remained under her new captain, is convinced that
the dead man haunts her vengefully ; and one desperate
accident after another, racking a crew overwhelmed with
fever, almost persuades the captain to share the mate's
illusion that 8° 20'—The Shadow Line (DENT)—is possessed
by the dead scoundrel. I found the book less interesting as
a yarn than as an example of the astonishingly conscious
and perfect artistry of this really great master of the ways
Mr. CoNRAD never made me believe
that the new captain would go so near sharing his mate's
superstitious panic (which is perhaps because I know little
of sailor-men save what he has taught me); and in the
incident, so curiously and deliberately detailed, of his find-
ing the quinine bottles filled with a worthless substitute,
and letting them “each in turn” slip to ground, I had again
the most unusual shock of being unable to accept the
credibility of his invention. This is so rare an experience
that it only throws into relief for me the fine craft of this
most brilliant of our impressionists, who tells so much
with such delicate strokes, so conscientiously considered,
so unerringly conveyed.
This is the End (MACMILLAN) is the kind of book that
only youth can write—youth at its best. It has the quali-
ties and defects of its parentage; but the qualities, a fine
careless rapture, sensitive vision, a wayward and jolly
fantasy, challenging provocativeness, faintly malicious
humour, are dominant. Miss STELLA BENson will grow
out of her youthful cynicisms and intolerances, will focus
her effects, without losing any of her substantial equipment.
This is by no means the end. It is the second step of a
very brilliant beginning. Already it shows improvement
upon her first clever book, I Pose; a surer touch, a finer
restraint. What is it all about 2 Does that matter? It
is the manner of the telling rather than what is told that
constitutes the charm. If I tell you that Jay runs away
from a respectable home, and, after a grievous experiment
as a bolster-filler, becomes a bus-conductor, has a romantic
friendship with a middle-aged married man, and marries
the faithful Mr. Morgan, her dead brother's soldier friend,
I have told you just nothing at all. I will merely add that
you will be foolish if you miss this book.
I have to begin by confessing that, despite its most at-
tractive title, my first glance into French Windows (ARNoLD)
produced in me some feeling of prejudice. It was not that
I failed to recognise both dignity and beauty of phrase in
the writing; on the contrary, I told myself that “Mr. John
Ayscough " had been betrayed by his own appreciation of
beautiful phrases into an indulgence in “style,” a deliberate |
arrangement of his war-pictures that was somehow out of
harmony with the stark and horrible simplicity of their
subject. But I hasten to make confession that this was but |

a passing and, I am convinced, a wrong judgment. Indeed,
the abiding impression that the book has left upon me is
one of enormous sincerity. Both as a soldier and a priest,
the writer enjoyed (as his publishers quite justly say) special
opportunities for getting into touch with men of all sorts
and conditions. This, aided by his own gift of sympathy
and comradeship, has resulted in a book that is very largely
a record of fleeting but genuine friendships, made with
individual soldiers, both French and English, in the Western
battle. Many of them contain portraits and character-
studies (a pedantic term for anything so sensitive and
sympathetic as these tributes to nameless heroes, but I can
find no better) that linger in the memory. I defy you, for
example, to forget soon the story of that winter walk taken
by the writer and certain officer-boys of his unit to the
Cistercian Monastery, and what Chutney said by the way;
and what happened afterwards. For the sake of such
sincere and memorable sketches as this I am more than
| ready to forgive what seemed like a touch of artifice

much what they probably " " " .
were in the beginning. As for the tale itself, that too will
hardly belie your expectation, being full of cleverness,
carried off with an infectious gaiety, and boasting (I use the
word advisedly) more than a sufficiency of that rather asser-
tive and school-boy impropriety which the charitable might
quote as evidence of our author's perpetual youth. It is an
interesting, though perhaps futile, speculation to reflect how
Mr. Thomas HARDY, to whose plots the present bears some
resemblance, might have handled it. Had Lewis Seymour
pursued his education in womanhood under the guidance of
the wizard of Dorchester there would probably have been
less of the atmosphere of holiday humour; but, on the other
hand, we should almost certainly have been spared the
quite superfluous naughtiness of the Parisian scenes. By
the way, talking of Paris, surely I am right in supposing
that the vision of a revived Versailles was an experience of
two ladies? It is unexpected to find Mr. MooRE denying
anything to “the sex.”
Of the late Mr. JACK LoNDoN's alternative methods of
writing, the defiantly propagandist and the joyously adven-
turous, I, being an average reader, have always preferred
the latter; so that, remembering how separate and distinct
he usually kept his two styles, I expected, in taking up

out, the half-dozen essay-stories that make up this slender
volume are by no means characteristic, for there is very
little plot in any, and even less attempt forcibly to extract a
moral; and amongst them are two not very successful
North of Ireland studies that seem to have no connection
at all with the author's usual manner. The volume is made
up of social pictures, all (as Mr. LoNDoN liked to pretend)
within his own experience, presented impartially for you to
study, and draw, if you choose, your own conclusions.
That experience ranges, comprehensively enough, from a
first-hand sketch of primeval man attempting rather un-
happily to group himself in clans and tribes, to a journalis-
tic note of the Yellow Peril that materialised, we learn,
somewhere late in the twentieth century and was overcome
by science liberating disease—a Hunnish method no longer
novel. Of the series I like best the tale of the San
Francisco professor of dual personality, who by dint of
much practical study of labour problems came at last to
cut loose from his own circle and disappear in the army
In this chapter alone is there a spark of
that blazes in such great stories as The Sea Wolf,
Though there may be no
very particular reason why
you should be invited to
read. The Love Story of
Guillaume-Marc (HUTchIN-
soN) it is, I vouch, a vivid
i enough tale of its genre.
Squeamish folk, perhaps,
may think that this is not
the most opportune time at
which to draw attention to
the blood-lust that was so
marked a feature of the
French Revolution. But,
granted that you do not
suffer from squeams, you
will find Miss MARIAN
Bow ER a deft weaver of
| romance. Here love and
adventurewalk firmly hand-in-hand, and from the moment
Guillaume-Marc makes his entrance upon the stage until
the happy ending is reached any day might have been his
last. The villain, too, is a satisfactory scoundrel, and cun-
ning withal.
“Brains,” he considered, “may conceive
revolutions, but it is the empty stomach which propagates
them.” I wonder whether they have the brains for it in
Berlin.
According to a recent official communiqué from Petrograd,
among the captures on the Caucasian Front was “an
apomecometer (an instrument for estimating altitudes).”
It is understood that the latest Turkish estimate of the
“All Highest" was captured with the instrument, but
was found to be unfit for publication.
“The Weser Zeitung now reports from Berlin that deliberations by
the State authorities have led to the decision that from April 15 the
meat ration will be increased to half a kilometre (about 174 ozs.) per
week.”—Liverpool Daily Post. -
This must refer to the sausage-ration, which by reason of
its length and tenuity is now advertised by the butchers
(civilian) of Berlin as “The HINDENBURG line.”

FERDIE. - -
My nerves are feeling rather bad
About the news from Petrograd.
Briefly, and speaking as a Tsar,
I think the game has gone too far.

You cannot always stop the thing.
Vices from ill examples grow,
And I might be the next to go.

Yes, what has happened over there
May very well occur elsewhere.
Fortune with me may prove as fickle as
It did with poor lamented NICHOLAs.
It was a silly thing to do
To ape the airs of WILLIAM Two;
I cannot think what I was at,
Trying to be an autocrat.
MEHMED.
I take a very dubious tone
About the fate of Allah's Own.
The Young Turk Party's been my bane
And caused me hours and hours of pain;
But, what would be a bitterer pill,
There may be others younger still,
Who, if the facts should get about,
Would want to rise and throw me out.
FERDIE.
I don't believe that WILLIAM cares
One little fig for my affairs.
He roped me in to this concern
Simply to serve his private turn;
And never shed a single tear
Over my loss of Monastir.
For tuppence, if I saw my way,
I'd join the others any day.
TINo.
Last year (its memory still is green) O
How WILLIAM loved his precious TINo!
He talked about our family ties
And sent me such a lot of spies.
But since his foes began to squeeze
My guns inside the Peloponnese
His interest in me has ceased;
I do not like it in the least.

slack, -
And now the beast won't pay 'em back.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
SOCIETY “WAR-WoRKERS."
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The scarcity of
paper isn't altogether an unmixed mis-
fortune, as far as one's correspondence
is concerned. Letters that don't matter,
letters from the insignificant and the
boresome, simply aren't answered. For
small spur-of-the-moment notes to one's
intimes who're not too far off, there's
quite a little feeling for using slates.
One writes what one's to say on one's
slate (which may be just as dilly a little
affair as you please, with plain or
chased silver frame, enamelled mono-
gram or coronet, and pencil hanging by
a little silver chain), and sends it by a
servant. When the note's been read,
it's wiped off, the answer written, and
the slate brought back. Isn't that frag-
rant? I may claim to have set this
fashion. Of course a very voyant slate
is not just-so. The Bullyon-Bounder-
mere woman set up one with a deep,
heavily-chased gold frame, and “B.-B."
at the top set with big diamonds. C'est
bien elle ! She'd used it only half-a-
dozen times when it was snatched from
her footwoman, who was taking it to
somebody's house, and hasn't been
heard of since
People Who Mattergave a double-page
to illustrating “War-Time Correspond-
ence Slates of Social Leaders.” My
slate 's there, and Stella Clackman-
nan's, and Beryl's and several more.
propos, have you seen the series of
“Well-known War. Workers” they've
been having lately in People Who
Matter? They're really quite worth
while. There's dear Lala Middleshire
in one of those charming “Olga "trench
coats (khaki face-cloth lined self-coloured
satin and with big, lovely, gilt - and -
enamelled buttons), high brown boots,
and one of those saucy little Belgian
caps with a distracting little tassel
wagging in front. The pickie is called
“The Duchess of Middleshire Takes a
War-Worker's Lunch,” and dear Lala
is shown standing by a table, looking
so bravely at two cutlets, a potato, a
piece of war bread, a piece of war
cheese and a small pudding.
Then there's Hermione Shropshire,
in a perfectly haunting lace and taffetas
morning robe, with a clock near her
(marked with a cross) pointing to eight
o'clock 1 (She lets her maid dress her
at that hour now, so that the girl ma
go and make munitions.) And Edel-
fleda Saxonbury is shown in an even-
ing gown, wearing her famous pearls.
She's leaning her chin on her hand and
gazing with a sweet wistful look at an
inset view of the hostel where she's
washed plates and cups quite severa
times. - -
And last but not least there's a pickie
that the journalist people have dubbed,
“Distinguished Society Women distin-
guish themselves as Carpenters,” et
voilà Beryl, Babs and your Blanche, in
delicious cream serge overall things,
with hammers, planes, and saws em-
broidered in crewels on the big square
collars and turn-up cuffs, and enor-
mously becoming carpenter's caps, look-
ing at a rest-hut we've just finished.
Oh, my dearest and best, you don't
know what it is to live till you've
learned to carpent / It's positively en-
thralling ! When we're skilful enough
we're to go abroad—mais il faut se
taire / I don't see why we shouldn't
go now. We're as skilful as we shall
ever be. And even if one or two of our
huts had no doors what's that matter?
Besides, a hut with no door has a tre-
mendous pull—there wouldn't be any
draughts!
Everyone's furious at the way the
powers that be have treated Sybil East-
hampton. You know what a wonderful
thing her Ollyoola Love Dance is. Of
course she's lived among the Ollyoolas
and knows them in all their moods.
(They're natives somewhere ever and
ever sofar off, where there are palms and
coral reefs, and the people don't believe
in wrapping themselves up much.) And
so she's given the dance at a great
many War Fund matinées. That little
Mrs. Jimmy Sharpe, daring to criticise
it, said there was too much Ollyoola
and not enough dance; but everybody
who counts simply raves about it. And
then, when some manager person
offered Sybil big terms to do it at the
“Incandescent,” he was “officially in-
formed " that, if the Ollyoola Love
Dance went into the bill the “Incan-
descent” would be “placed out of
bounds” What do you, do you think
of that, m'amie 2 A piece of sheer artis-
try like the Ollyoola Love Dance to be
treated so ! And it's wonderſul not
only artistically but scientifically.
Each of dear Sybil's amazing wriggles
and squirms and crouches and springs
is absolutely true—eractly what an
Ollyoola does when it's in love.
We're all glad to think we can still
see the Ollyoola Love Dance at War
Fund matinées.

[APRIL 11, 1917.
PUNCH, OR THE LoNDON CHARIVARI.
-
THE WATCH DOGS.
LIX.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Reference the
German withdrawal. The matter is
proceeding in machine-like order, and
one of the first great men to cross No-
Man's Land was myself in the noblest
of cars. It was, I confess, a purely
temporary and fortuitous arrangement
which put me in such a conveyance,
but I had the feeling that it was excel-
lently fitted to my particular form of
greatness, and there were moments
when I was so enamoured of it that I
was on the verge of getting into a hole
with it and staying hid there till the
end of the War. Just the right hole
was provided at every cross-roads, but
the driver wouldn't try them and went
round by the fields.
Of the flattened villages and the
severed fruit-trees you will have read
as much as I have seen. It's a grue-
some business, but one charred village
is much like another, and the sight
is, alas, a familiar one nowadays. For
me all else was forgotten in speechless
admiration of the French people. Their
self-restraint and adaptability are be-
yond words. These hundreds of honest
people, just relieved from the domineer-
ing of the Master Swine and restored
to their own good France again, were
neither hysterical nor exhausted. They
were just their happy selves, very
pleased about it all, standing in their
doorways, strolling about the market-
place, watching the march of events as
one might watch a play. Every house
had its tricolor bravely flying; where
they'd got them from so soon I don't
know, but no Frenchman ever yet
failed, under any circumstances, to
produce exactly the right thing at ex-
actly the right moment. There was
a nice old Adjoint at the Mairie
who wasn't for doing any business at
all, with the English or anyone else,
until a certain formality had been ob-
served. He had a bottle of old brandy in
his cellar, which somehow or other had
escaped the German eye these last two
years. This, said Monsieur, had first to
be disposed of before any other business
could conceivably be entertained . . .
I gathered he had risked much, every-
thing possibly, in keeping this bottle
two years; but nothing on earth would
induce him to retain it two minutes
longer.
Madame, the doctor's wife, approached
me as a friend with a request. Would
I expedite a letter to her people, to
announce her restoration to liberty? I
was at Madame's disposal. She handed
me the letter. I observed that the enve-
lope was not closed down. Madame's
look indicated that this was intentional,
and her expression indicated that this
was the sort of thing she was used to.
There was no weeping, no extreme
emotion. There was a philosophical
detachment, a very prevalent humour,
and, for the rest, signs of a quiet wait-
ing for “The Day.” There is only one
day for France, the day of the arrival
of Frenchmen on German soil. When
the English arrive in Germany there
will be nothing doing, except some
short and precise orders that we must
salute all civilians and pay double for
what we buy; but when the French
arrive in Germany . . . and Heaven
“WELL, so You'RE GOING TO HAVE THE
VOTE AT LAST."
“OH, oxLY woxie N over: THIRTY, You
RNOW.”
send we are going to help them to get
well in
There is a story current, turning on
these events, of a young German officer
and an official correspondence. It just
possibly may be true, since even among
such a rotten lot there might conceiv-
ably have been one tolerable fellow.
The Higher Command had been much
intrigued as to a church window,
wanting to know (in writing) exactly
why and how it had been broken; or
rather, as it was the German Higher ha. - -
think of moving towards Germany, iſ
only to see, when we get there, exactly
Command, exactly why and how it had
been allowed to remain unbroken. You
know how these affairs develop in in-
terest and excitement as the corre-
spondence passes down and down, from
one formation to another, and what an
air of urgency and bitterness they wear
when they reach the last man. In
this case the young German subaltern,
who had no one else below him on
whom to put the burden of explaining
in writing, took advantage of his posi-
tion, and wrote upon a slip, which he
attachéd to the top of the others: “To
Officer Commanding British Troops.
Passed to you, please, as this town is
now in your area. . . .” |
Probably the tale isn't true, for if the
officer was a German he must have had
German blood in him, and if he had
German blood in him there couldn't
be room for anything else, certainly
not for a sense of humour. -
We stayed longer than we should
have done; this was an occasion upon
which one could not insist on the limit
of ten handshakes per person. I was
delayed also by the Institutrice, who
wanted to borrow my uniform, so that
she might put it on and so be in a
position to start right off at once, paying
back. She meant it too, and I should
not be surprised to hear that she's been
caught doing it by this time. Her
mother was there in great form. Asked
for her opinion of the dear departed,
she said she had already told it to
themselves and saw no reason to alter
it. “They make war only on women
and children; they are liches.” My
N.C.O. got out his pocket-dictionary to
discover the exact meaning of the word.
She told us he needn't trouble; it meant
two months' imprisonment. She had
a face like a russet apple—a very nice
russet apple, too.
We didn't get away before dark, and
we found it very hard to discover our
way about new country when large
hunks of it were missing altogether.
One of the party would walk on to
find the way, and later I would go forth
to find him. We could see the road
stretching away in front of us for kilo-
metres; but between us and it there
would be twenty yards of nil.
However, the car eventually learnt
to stand on its back wheels, climb
hedges and make its way home across
country, having confirmed its general
opinion of the Bosch, that he is only
good at one thing, and that is destroy-
ing other people's property. I am now
back in comfort again, and able to

rather less than the usual allowance
of doors and windows, thus demon-
strating a fine contempt for stage tra-
ditions. An electric-light, disguised
within a mid-Victorian gas-globe,
occupies a conspicuous position on one
wall. You will see why presently.
When the curtain rises Janet, an
awkward girl of any age over thirty
(and made up to look it) is seated
before the fire knitting. Her mother,
also knitting, faces her. The appear-

that it is wholly imperceptible by the

from behind. This is called
realism.

heard to bang. At the same

quickly. He is the typical British

rest of his appearance is a cross
between a gamekeeper and an
undertaker.

of some excitement; speaks scornfully).
Well, here's a fine thing happened.

weeks. May I invite myself to stay
with you? . . .”
I accepted his invitation, if I may
put it so, and on March 6th received
the following:—
“DEAR WILLIAM, I am not, as I
think I said, at all well, and my doctor
considers I had better break the journey
at Plymouth, as it is a long way from
Malvern to Cornwall. Would you re-
commend me some hotels to choose
from ?. I hope to start by the middle
of the month . . .”
I recommended hotels, and on the
12th heard from him again:-
“DEAR WILLIAM, I am very obliged
to you. In this severe weather my
doctor says that I cannot be too careful,
and I doubt if I shall be able to start
for ten days or so. Has your house
a south aspect, and is it far from the
sea 2 I require air but not wind. And
could you tell me . . .”
I told him all right, though as a guest
I began to think him a little exigeant.
But he was unwell.
On the 17th he answered me:–
“DEAR WILLIAM, I understand you
live quite in the country. Would you
tell me whether a doctor lives near to
you and whether you have a chemist
within reasonable distance? My doctor,
who really understands my case, won't
hear of my starting until the wind
changes: but I hope .”
I drew a map showing my house, the
nearest chemist's shop, the doctor's
surgery and a few other points of
interest, such as Land's End and the
Lizard. This I sent to him, and on the
22nd he replied:— -
“DEAR WILLIAM, -I acknowledge
your map with many thanks. There
is one more thing. My doctor insists
on a very special diet. Can your cook
make porridge 2 I rely very largely on
porridge for breakfast and . . .”
I saw myself smiling at Lord DEvoN-
Port and wired back, “Have you ever
known a cook who couldn't make
porridge 2"
And on the
ultimatum:—
“DEAR WILLIAM,-I have consulted
my doctor and he thinks I ought not
to tempt Providence by travelling at
present, so I have decided to remain in
Malvern. I do hope . . .”
27th he issued his
To this I replied:—
“DEAR WIGGLEs, Holding as you
do the old pagan view of Providence,
you are quite right not to tempt it.
The loss is mine. I hope you will
soon be rather less unwell.”
Then I went away for three days
without leaving an address, and when
I returned it was to learn that Wiggles
had arrived on the previous evening.
And in my study I found him, together
with four wires (two to say he wasn't
coming and two to say he was) and a
table loaded with prescriptions.
He eats enormously.

O STREET of Ink, O Street of Ink,
Where printers and machinsts swink
Amid the buzz and hum and clink;
By night one cannot sleep a wink,
There is no time to stop or think,
One half forgets to eat or drink,
One's brains are knotted in a kink,
One always lives upon the brink
Of “happenings” that strike one pink.
One day the dollars gaily chink,
The next your funds to zero shrink.
And yet I'm such a perfect ninc-

That binds me to the Street of Ink.

Wiscount VALENTIA has gone to the
Lords, and the Commons will hence-
forth miss the elegant and well-groomed
figure which lent distinction to a
Treasury Bench not in these days too
careful of the Graces. Happily Oxford
City has found another distinguished
man to succeed him. Mr. J. A. R.
MARRIOTT may indeed be said to have
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 2nd.—The MINISTER
of MUNITIONs informed the House that,
owing to the demand for explosives,
there is a shortage of acid for artificial
fertilisers. It is rumoured that Mr.
SNowden, Mr. OUTHWAITE and Mr.
PRINGLE, feeling that it is up to them
to do something useful
for their country, have
placed at Dr. Addison's
disposal a selection from
the speeches delivered
by them during the War,
containing an abundant
supply of the necessary
commodity.
Mr. Joseph MARTIN
has all the migratory in-
stincts of his well-known
family, and flits from
East St. Pancras to Brit-
ish Columbia and back
again with engaging ir-
regularity. On his rare
visits to Westminster he
is always ready to impart
in a somewhat strident
voice (another family
characteristic) the politi-
cal wisdom that he has
garnered from the New
World and the Old. But
somehow the House fails
to take him at his own
valuation, and when he
tried to belittle the Im-
perial Conference, on the
ground that the Domin-
ion Premier and his col-
leagues would be much
better employed at home,
I think there was a gen-
eral feeling that the phys-
ician would be none the
worse for a dose of his
own prescription.

he stepped to the Table

insisted upon administering the oath
to himself has the House been so much
stirred; even Members loitering in the
Lobby could almost have heard the
ringing tones in which Mr. MARRIOTT
proclaimed his allegiance to our Sover-
eign Lord, KING GEORGE THE FIFTH.
Tuesday, April 3rd.—
Mr. KING really displays
a good deal of ingenuity
in his endeavours to get
men out of the Army.
His latest notion is that
all Commanding Officers
at home should be or-
dered to give leave to
those men who have gar-
dens so that they may re-
turn to cultivate them.
There would, no doubt,
be a remarkable develop-
ment of horticultural
enthusiasm among our
home forces if the War
Office were to smile upon
the idea ; but, though
fully alive to the value
of food - production, the
UNDER-SECRETARY was
unable to assent to this
wide extension of “agri-
cultural furlough.”
A request by the Press
Bureau that newspapers
would submit for its ap-
proval any articles deal-
ing with disputes in the
coal-trade gave umbrage
to several Members, who
saw in it an attempt by
the Government to fetter
public criticism. Mr.
BRACE mildly explained
that the object was only
to prevent the appear-
ance of inaccurate state-
ments likely to cause fric-
tion in an inflammable
trade. When Mr. KING
still protested, Mr. BRACE
again showed that his
velvet paw conceals a
very serviceable weapon.
“Surely the Honourable
Member does not believe that inaccurate
statements can ever be helpful.” Then
there was silence.
Mr. BonAR LAw stoutly denied that
the National Service scheme was a
failure, but admitted that the Cabinet
was looking into it with a view to its
improvement. Up to the present some
220,000 men have volunteered, but as
about half of these are already engaged
on work of national importance Mr.
NEvil LE CHAMBERLAIN is still a long
way short of his hoped-for half-a-million

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND.
IN the course of a recent search for
Italian conversation manuals I came
upon one which put so strangely novel
a complexion on our own tongue that,
though it was not quite what I was
seeking, I bought it. To see ourselves
as others see us may be a difficult opera-
tion, but to hear ourselves as others
hear us is by this little book made quite
easy. Everyone knows the old story
of the Italian who entered an East-
bound omnibus in the Strand and asked
to be put down at Kay-ahp-see-day.
Well, this book should prevent T-
him from doing it again.
But its great attraction is the
courageous personality of the
protagonist as revealed by his
various remarks. For example,
most of us who are not linguists

huim-sical raittars, hu hºw uéstéd énd
uést thear laif in litudněs.”
English people abroad do not, as a
rule, drop aphorisms by the way; but
our Italian loves to do so. Thus, to
one stranger (in the section devoted to
Virtues and Vices), he remarks, “Uith-
aut Riligión uiscitid bi uðrs thén bists.”
To another, “Thi igotist spichs contin-
nitialle Ov himself &nd méchs himself
-
º
º
-#EE
--s
An-héppe
thi fair uith jur hēnds.” His presence
of mind saves him from using his own
hands for the purpose. Resourceful-
ness is indeed as natural to him as to
Sir Christopher WREN in the famous
poem. “Uilliam,” he says to his man,
“if eneböde asch-s for mi, ju wil sé
thet ai scélbi bech in 6 fºrt-mait.”
He meets Miss Butterfield.
“Mis Bóttarfild,” he says, “uil ju
ghiv mi é glas ov uſtar, if ju plis #"
And that is the end of the lady. Or I
think so. But there is just a possi-
bility that it is she (no longer Miss
Butterfield, but now a Signora) whom
he rebukes in a coffee-house:
“Mai diar, du not spich év pól-
litichs in 6 Côffi-Haus, för nô
travvellar, if prident, evvar
tochs ebaut pólitichs in pob-
lich.” And again it may be for
Miss Butterfield that he orders
confine our conversations in for-
eign places to the necessities of
life, rarely leaving the beaten
track of bread and butter, knives
and forks, the times of trains,
cab fares, the way to the station,
the way to the post-office, hotel
prices and washing lists. And
even then we disdain or flee from
syntax. But this conversation-
alist embroiders and dilates. He
is intrepid. He has no reluct-
ances. Where we in Italy would,
at the most, say to the came-
riere, “Portaci una tazza di
caffè,” and think ourselves lucky
to get it, he lures the London
waiter to invite a disquistion on
the precious berry. Thus, he
begins: “Côffi is ri-marchéblför
izvērestim-iùlétin propérté. Du
ju nū haw it uðs discóvvard 2"
The waiter very promptly and
properly saying, “Nó, Sór,” the
Italian unloads as follows: “Uel,

as sed tu hºw bin Öchésciónt bai

a charming present (first say-
ing it is for a lady): “Ghiv mi
thèt ripittar set uith rubés, thet
straich-s thi aurs énd thi hâf

* Finally he embarks for Aus-
tralia and quickly becomes as
human as the rest of us. “Thi

for fear, even if a storm should
come on. “Du not bi alarmd,”
he says: “thear is no déngg-ar.
Thi Chép-tén Öv this Stima-r is

| His last words, addressed
apparently to the rest of the
passengers as they reach Ade-
laide, are these: “Lêt às méch

A little later a London bookseller has
the temerity to place some of the latest
fiction before our chatty alien, but pays
dearly for his rash act. In these words
did the Italian let him have it:—“Ai
du not laich mov-Čls ét Öl, bicó-s é nov-Čl
is bat é fichtisciós tél stof-t Öv so méne
fantastical dids &nd nonsensical uðrds,

third, a little tactlessly perhaps, “Im-
pólait-nés is disgöstin.” He is senten-
tious even to his hatter: “E het scińd
bi propórsciónd tu thi hēdénd person, for
it is lif-ebl tu si è largg het Öp-ón é
smól hèd, énd 6 smól hèt op-on 6 largg
hèd.” But sometimes he goes all
astray. He is, for instance, desperately
ill-informed as to English law. In
England, he tells us, and believes the
pathetic fallacy, “thi tréns start &nd
arraiv vère póngh-citialle, Óthar-wais
passén-gidrs hu arraiv-lét for thear bis-
nés cud silt thi Compane for dém-ègg-s.”
He is calm and collected in an emer-
gency. Thus, to a lady who has burst
into flames, “Bi not fród, Madam,” he
says, “thi fair hēs cot jur gaum. Lé
daun öp-ºn thi flór, &nd ju wil put aut

EMERGENCY RATIONS.
IN our village many disruptions have
been wrought by the War, but no-
thing has ever approached the state of
turveydom which came in with the
system of daily rations.
Margery brought home the first news
of the revolution.
“Most extraordinary thing,” she said.
“The Joneses have got the two old
Miss Singleweeds staying with them.”
“What!” I exclaimed, swallowing
my ration of mammalia in one aston-
ished gulp. “Why, only two or three
days ago Jones told me very privately
that the Singleweeds were two of the
most interfering, bigoted, cabbage-eat-

ing old cats that he had ever come
across.”
“Cabbage-eating!” repeated Margery
thoughtfully. “How stupid we are.
That's it, of course.”
* “What's it 2 ''
“Why, cabbage-eating. The Single-
weeds haven't touched meat since I
don't know when, so for a consideration
of brussels-sprouts and a few digestive
biscuits the Joneses will have five
pounds of genuine beef to play with.”
“Hogs!” I said.
The hospitable influence of the new
scheme of rationing spread very rapidly.
A few days later we heard that Sir
Meesly Goormay, the most self-indul-
gent and incorrigible egotist in the
neighbourhood, had introduced a col-
lection of octogenarian aunts to his
household, and, when I was performing
my afternoon beat, I was just in time
to see the butcher's boy, assisted by the
gardener, delivering what looked to be
a baron of beef at Sir Meesly's back
door. It was an enervating and dis-
gusting spectacle, well calculated to
upset the moral of the steadiest special
in the local force. -
That night at dinner I had a Machia-
vellian thought.
“Look here,” I said, stabbing at a
plate of petit pois (1911) and mis-cueing
badly, “what about having Uncle Tom
to stay for a few weeks?”
“Last time hecame,” replied Margery,
“you said that nothing would induce
you to ask him again. You haven't
forgotten his chronic dyspepsia, have
you?”
“Of course not,” I retorted, looking a
little pained at such flagrant gaucherie;
“but you can't cast off a respectable
blood relation because he happens to
live on charcoal and hot water.”
I delivered an irritable attack on a
lentil pudding.
“Right-O,” agreed Marjory. “And
I'll ask Joan as well. She won't be
able to come until Friday, because
she's having some teeth extracted on
Thursday.”
After all Marjory is not altogether
without perception.
Dinner over I wrote, in my best style,
a short spontaneous invitation to Uncle
Tom. Margery wrote a more discursive
one to Joan.
“I think we ought to celebrate this,”
I suggested. “Let’s be extravagant.”
“All right,” said Margery. “What
shall it be, champagne or potatoes?"
Two days later I received the fol-
lowing:—
“MY DEAR JAMEs, Thank you very
much for your invitation, which I am
very pleased to accept. The country,
after all, is the proper place for old
fogeys like myself, as it is very difficult
for them to live up to the present-day
bustle of a large city. For the last six
months I have been doing odd jobs at
a munition factory, which, I must
admit, has benefited my health in an
extraordinary manner, so much so that
I have entirely lost the troublesome
dyspepsia I suffered from, and now, you
will be glad to hear, I am able to eat
like a hunter, as we used to say. Hoping
to find you all flourishing on Thursday
next, about lunch-time,
“Your affectionate UNCLE TOM.”
Instinctively I took my belt in a hole.
Then Margery silently placed this in
front of me:—
“DARLING MARGERY,+How perfectly
sweet of you! I shall simply love it.
I am feeling especially beany as I have
just finished with the dentist—usually
a hateful person—who found out, after
all, that it was not necessary to take
out any of my teeth. I adore him.
No time for more. Heaps to tell you
on Friday. “Your loving J. J.”
“Hullo! Where are you off to ?” I
asked, as Margery made for the door.
“Off to ? Why, to put our names
down on the Singleweeds' waiting list.”
I took my belt up another hole and,
whistling The Bing Boys out of sheer
desperate bravado, made my gloomy
way to the potato patch.

v OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM wondering whether, among the myriad by-products
of the War, there should be numbered a certain note of
virility hitherto (if he will forgive me for saying so) foreign
to the literary style of Mr. E. TEMPLE THURStoN. Because
I have certainly found Enchantment (UNwiN) a far more
vigorous and less saccharine affair than previous experience
had led me to expect from him. For which reason I find
it far and away my favourite of the stories by this author
that I have so far encountered. I certainly think (for ex-
ample) that not one of his Cities of Beautiful Barley-Sugar
contains any figures so alive as those of John Desmond,
the hard-drinking Irish squireen, and Mrs. Slattery, his
adoring housekeeper. There is red blood in both, and not
less in Charles Stuart, a hero whose earlier adventures
with smugglers, secret passages and the like have an
almost STEVENSONIAN vigour. All the life of impoverished
Waterpark, with its wonderful drawing-room full of pre-
carious furniture, is excellently drawn. I willingly allow
Mr. THURSTON so much of his earlier manner as is implied
in the (quite pleasant) conceit of the fairy-tale. The point
is that the real tale here is neither of fairies nor of sugar
dolls, but of genuine human beings, vastly entertaining to
read about and quite convincingly credible. I can only
entreat the author to continue this rationing of sentiment
for our mutual benefit.
When a book rejoices in such a title as The Amazing Years
(HopDER AND Stoughton) and begins with a prosperous
English family contemplating their summer holiday in
August 1914, you may be tolerably certain beforehand of
its subject-matter. When, moreover, the namg on the
title-page is that of Mr. W. PETT RIDGE, you may with
equal security anticipate that, whatever troubles befall this
English family by the way, they will eventually reach a
happy ending, and find all for the best in the best of all
genially humorous worlds. As indeed it proves. But of
course the Hilliers were exceptionally fortunate in the fact
that when the crash came they had one of those quite
invaluable super-domestics whom Mr. PETT RIDGE delights
in to steer them back to prosperity. The story tells
us how the KAISER compelled the Hilliers to leave “The
Croft,” and how that very capable woman, Miss Weston,
restored it to them again, chiefly by the aid of her antique
shop; and to anyone who has recently been a customer in
such an establishment this result fully explains itself. I
need not further enlarge upon the theme of the book.
Your previous knowledge of Mr. PETT RIDGE's method will
enable you to imagine how the various members of the
Hillier household confront the changes brought by The
Amazing Years; but this will not make you less anxious to
read it for yourself in the author's own inimitable telling.
I won't call this his best novel; now and again, indeed,
there seemed rather too much padding for so slender a
plot; but, take it for all in all, and bearing in mind the
strange fact that we all love to read about events with
which we are already familiar, I can at least promise you a
cheery and optimistic entertainment.

she writes intimately of many people whose names are

upon a certain subject with what the Huns must regard
as considerable unanimity. If in the last century there

as a quiet corner for repose.

A SCHOOL FOR STATESMEN.
[The Hamburger Fremdenblatt, in an article on our Ambassador at
Petrograd, ascribes his success as a diplomat to his passion for golf—
“if one can speak of passion in connection with this cold game ºf
meadow billiards.” “The conditions,” it goes on to say: “in which
this rather tiresome game is played do really produce the qualities
necessary for any statesmanlike or diplomatic work. . . . , Silent,
tough, resigned, unbroken . . . the good golfer walks round his field,
keeps his eye on the ball and steers for his goal. . . . Sir George
Bučhanan walked round the whole golf field of Europe for years until
at last he was able in Petrograd to hurl the ball into the goal."]
OFT have I wondered as my weapon's edge
Disintegrated solid chunks of greenery,
Or as my pillule flew the bounding hedge
Into outlying sections of the scenery,
What moral value might accrue
From billiards played beneath the blue.
Little I fancied when I topped the sphere
And on its candour left a coarse impression,
Or in the bed of some revolting mere
Mislaid three virgin globes in swift succession,
That I was learning how to grip
The rudiments of statesmanship.
Yet so it was. I schooled myself to gaze
Upon the object with a firmly glued eye,
And, though I moved by strange and devious ways,
To keep in view the goal, or finis ludi, -
And ever let my language be
The language of diplomacy.
Thus BALFour learned the politician's game,
And thus LLoyd GEORGE was trained to be a
Premier; -
Thence many a leader who has leapt to fame
Got self-control, grew harder, tougher, phlegmier,
Reared in the virtues which prevail
At Walton Heath and Sunningdale.
Golf being then the source of so much good,
I own my conscience suffers certain wrenches
Recalling how the links of Chorley Wood
Have seen me on the Sabbath carving trenches,
Where Tommies might be taught to pitch
The deadly bomb from ditch to ditch.
For I reflect that my intruding spade,
That blocked the foursome and debarred the single,
May well have checked some statesman yet unmade,
Some budding Hogg E, some mute inglorious
PRINGLE ;
And that is why my shovel shrinks
From excavating other links.

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(The GERMAN CrowN PRINCE and Marshal HINDENBURG).
Hindenburg. So your Royal Highness proposes to leave
us again 2
The Prince. Yes, Marshal, I'm going to leave you for a
short time. I have made arrangements which will render
my absence from the Front as little disadvantageous as may
be possible. My orders have been carefully drawn up so as
to provide for every contingency, and I trust that nothing
the enemy can do will find my stout fellows unprepared,
while I am devising fresh triumphs for them in my tem-
porary retirement.
Hindenburg. We shall all regret the absence of your
Royal Highness from those fields in which you have planted
new proofs both of German courage and of German intel-
lectual superiority ; but no doubt your Highness will be all
the better for a short rest. May I, perhaps, ask the immedi-
ate cause of your Highness's departure from the Front?
The Prince. No, Marshal, you mustn't, for if you do I
shall not answer you fully. (Hums) Souvent femme varie;
fol qui s'y fie—do you know what that means, you rogue 2
Hindenburg. I know your Highness spoke in French,
which is not what I should have expected from one who
stands so near to the throne.
The Prince. Now, you mustn't be angry; only dull people
ever get angry. . - - -
Hindenburg. Your Royal Highness means to say—?
The Prince. I mean to say that you're not dull—not
really dull, you know, and that therefore you can't be
allowed to get angry about a mere trifle. Besides, our pre-
decessor, the GREAT FREDERICK, always spoke in French
and wrote his poetry in French—very poor stuff it was too
—and had a violent contempt for the German language,
which he considered a barbarous jargon.
Hindenburg. I care not what the GREAT FREDERICK may
have thought as to this matter—there are other points in
which it might be well to imitate him first rather than to
remember what he thought and said about our noble
German language—but for me it is enough to know that
the Emperor and King whom 1 serve holds no such ideas.
The Prince. Of course he doesn't ; he holds no ideas at
all of any kind. -
Hindenburg. At least he would be angry to hear such—
The Prince. Of course he would; he's dull enough in all
conscience for that or anything else.
Hindenburg (after a pause). Your Royal Highness will,
perhaps, forgive me if I draw your gracious attention to the
fact that I have much work to do and but little time to do
it in.
The Prince. Of course, my dear Marshal, of course.
They're making things warm for you, aren't they, in the
direction of Arras? I was saying to myself only this
morning, “How annoying for that poor old HINDENBURG
to have his masterly retreat interrupted by those atrocious
English, and to lose thirteen thousand prisoners and one
hundred-and-sixty guns, and I don't know how many killed
and wounded. Where's his wall of steel now, poor old
fellow, and his patent plan for luring the enemy on ?”
That's what I said to myself, and now that we have met
I feel that I must offer you my condolences. I know what
it is, though of course it wasn't my fault that we failed to
bring it off against the French at Verdun. Heigho! I'm
really beginning to believe that I shall never see Paris.
Hindenburg. ' ' | | | | | | |
The Prince. You needn't look so stuffy, dear old thing.
I'm going. But remember I shall be your Emperor some
day; and then what shall I do with you? I know; I shall
have you taught French.

own business and paying my way and
my taxes; but this boy is a fighter,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE,
PART I.
Angelo Armstrong was a man of
thirty. He had no capital, but by dint
of honest and meritorious toil he found
himself eventually earning a moderate
salary as clerk in a London Insurance
Office. He had been rejected for the
Army on account of a defective knee-
cap. Outside his work his tastes lay in
the direction of botany and bibliomancy,
which latter, according to the dictionary,
is “Divination performed by selecting
passages of Scripture at hazard.” He
also indulged in good works and was
President of the Society for the Pre-
servation of the Spiritual Welfare of the
Deputy Harbour Masters at our English
Seaports. Thus he was worthy of the
name of Angelo by which his mother
had insisted that he should be christened,
after seeing a picture of the famous
historical incident of “Non Angli sed
Angeli.” - -
Strangely enough he had never yet
come under the influence of love. The
three diversions given above had filled
his spare hours, and woman was to him
a sealed book. One morning he found
a letter on his breakfast-table from an
old family friend; it read as follows:—
“Tom Répos,” Woking,
December 11th, 1916.
“DEAR MR. ARMSTRONG. - Do tear
yourself away from grimy London and
come and spend the Christmas holidays
with us. Only a small party and one
of War-workers. We are i workers
nowadays, aren't we? You must come!
Sincerely yours, - . - -
AUGUSTA Pogson-DELABERE.
N.B.-Our house is a long way from
the Crematorium !
This settled it; he decided to go.
PART II.
The Pogson-Delaberes' party at “Ton
Répos” consisted of four guests: Col.
Maxton, from Aldershot, commanding
the 106th Battalion of the Drumlie
Highlanders; Miss Agatha Simson,
a middle-aged munition-worker; our
hero, and, oh! the lovely Miss Sylvia
Taunton, another War-worker, aged
22. The result may be easily guessed.
For two days the young people were
They quickly fell into an easy intimacy,
and on the third and last day of the
holiday Angelo was profoundly in love.
Gone were the botanizers, gone the
bibliomants, gone the Deputy Harbour
Masters. There was but one thought
in his evacuated brain, to make the fair
Sylvia his own. -
His opportunity came after dinner
| that night when the rest of the party
left, naturally, very much together. .
had gone out to look at some condemned
pheasants which were to be shot at
dawn. She was at the piano playing
that deservedly popular song, “I’ve
chipped my chip for England,” by Na-
thaniel Dayer, when he suddenly leant
over her. “Miss Taunton—Sylvia,” he
ejaculated,” “you will be surprised at
this suddenness, I know, but I cannot
keep it in any longer; I love you enor-
mously. Is there any chance for me?”
She had just reached that passage in
Nathaniel's song where a triumphant
ascending scale in G rings out. She
faltered and played D-flat instead of
D-natural, the first dissonance that
night—would it had been the last!
Quickly she turned on the music-stool
and on him, and spoke with averted
head.
“Mr. Armstrong, I will own frankly
that I like you more than a little.
Though we only met three days ago I
am more drawn to you than I have
ever been to any other man.”
“Aha,” he cried exultingly.
“But,” she said, “I must say some-
thing about myself. While I am a
War-worker, I have never told you yet
what I am doing. I am a clerk in
Marr's Bank, in Cheapside.”
“There is nothing dishonourable in
that,” he almost shouted.
“There is not,” she answered,
haughtily drawing herself up.
“I keep my account there,” he said.
“I know,” she replied; “I am in the
Pass-book department.”
He stood quite still, but the lapels of
his dinner-jacket shook slightly.
“My duties,” she went on quietly,
“are to report each evening to my chief,
Mr. Hassets, on our clients' balances.
Yours has never been higher than
£247s. 9d, during the eighteen months
that I have been there. I am very
sorry, but I cannot marry you.”
He looked straight into her inscrut-
able eyes and the right repartee froze
on his lips.
On the morrow he left at dawn, just as
the birds were beginning to drop; and
before the day was over he had trans-
ferred his account from Marr's Bank to
Parr's.

AUTHORITIES.

Surely this is asking too much.

Possession of Deltawah and Sindiyah, some
thirty-five miles north of Bagdad, and of
Falluyah on the Euphrates, thirty-six miles

We know on Fluellen's authority that
Macedon and Monmouth are very much
alike; and so, it seems, is Mesopotamia.
BACK TO THE LAND.
THE wintry days are with us still:
The roads are deep in liquid dirt;
The rain is wet, the wind is chill,
And both are coming through my
shirt; -
And yet my heart is light and gay;
I shout aloud, I hum a snatch;
Why am I full of mirth 2 To-day
I'm planting my potato patch.
The KAISER sits and bites his nails
In Pots- (or some adjoining) dam ;
He wonders why his peace talk fails
And how to cope with Uncle Sam ;
The General Staff has got the hump;
In vain each wicked scheme they
hatch ;
I've handed them the final thump
By planting my potato patch.
The U-boat creeps beneath the sea
And puts the unarmed freighters
down ; -
It fills the German heart with gle
To see the helpless sailors drown;
But now and then a ship lets fly
To show that Fritz has met his match!
She 's done her bit, and so have I
Who dig in my potato patch.
And later, when the War is won
And each man murmurs, “Well,
that 's that,”
And reckons up what he has done
To put the Germans on the mat,
I'll say, “It took ten myriad guns
And fighting vessels by the batch ;
But we too served, we ancient ones,
Who dug in our potato patch.”
- . - ALGOL.
“ IT."
PHASE I.
THE doctor says, perfectly cheerfully
and as though it were really not a matter
of vital importance, that there is no
doubt that I have got IT. He remarks
that IT is all over the place, and that he
has a couple of hundred other cases at
the present time.
I resent his attitude as far as I have
strength to do anything at all. I did
not give permission for him to be called
in just to have my sufferings brushed
aside like this. He only stays about
three minutes altogether, during which
time he relates two funny stories (at
least I suppose they are funny, because
my nurse laughs; I can't see any point
in them myself), and makes several
futile remarks about the War. As
though the War were a matter of
importance by comparison' Then he
goes, talking breezily all the way down
the stairs. º
Well, I think darkly, they will be
sorry presently. I have no intention

or expectation of getting better, and
when they see me a fair young corpse
then they'll know.
Already I loathe the Two Hundred.
Not that I believe for a minute the
story of my own disease being the
same as their miserable little com-
plaints. In recurring periods of con-
scious thought I go through the list
of things I know for a fact I have got
—rheumatic fever, sciatica, lumbago,
toothache, neuritis, bronchitis, laryn-
gitis, tonsilitis, neuralgia, gastritis,
catarrh of several kinds, heart disease
and inflammation (or possibly con-
gestion) of the lungs. I shall think of
some more presently, if my nurse will
let me alone and not keep on worrying
me with her “Just drink this.” Bother
the woman | Why doesn't she get off
the earth? What's the use of my
swallowing that man's filthy medicine
when he doesn't know what 's the
matter with me?
I hate everybody and everything,
especially the eider-down quilt, which
rises in slow billows in front of my
eyes and threatens to engulf me. When
in a paroxysm of fury I suddenly cast
it on the floor, it lies there still billow-
ing, and seems to leer at me. There is
something fat and sinister and German
about that eiderdown. I never noticed
it before. Two Hundred German eider-
downs !
The firelight flickers weirdly about
the room and I try to count the
shadows. But before I begin I know
the answer—Two HUNDRED. - -
I drift into a nightmare of Two
Hundred elusive cabbages which I am
endeavouring to plant in my new allot-
ment, where a harsh fate forces me to
dig and dig and DIG, and, as a natural
consequence, also to ache and ache and
ACHE.
PHASE II.
I can stand up with assistance from
the bed-post and totter feebly to an
arm-chair by the fire, where I sit in
a dressing-gown and weep. What for?
I couldn't say, except that it seems a
fit and proper thing to do.
I am still of opinion that I am not
long for this world, and my favourite
occupation at present is counting up
the number of wreaths that I might
justifiably expect to have sent to my
funeral. I don't tell my nurse, who
would immediately try to “cheer me
up" by talking to me or giving me a
magazine to look at. And I would much
rather count wreaths. The Smiths
probably would not be able to afford
OD16 . . .
My thoughts are distracted by the
sudden apparition of a little meal. I
begin to take an interest in these little
meals, which are of such frequent occur-

rence that I am reduced to tears again,
this time at the thought of the extra
expense I am causing. And all for
nothing. Why don't they save the
money for wreaths? -
The doctor comes while I am swallow-
ing my egg, miserably yet with a certain
gusto, and I dry my eyes hastily as I
hear him bounding up the stairs.
“Hullo,” he calls out before he is
well through the door, “how are we
to-day, eh? Beginning to sit up and
take notice? I think we'll change
your medicine.”
“I think,” I remark resignedly,
“that it will be best for someone to
dig a hole and bury me.”
“Jolly good idea,” he agrees heartily.
“In fact why not do it to all of us?
Please the Germans so too. But it
can't be done, you know—there's a
shortage of grave-diggers.”
Heartless brute!

tertained that supplies, which are scent, will
be left to poor people who most require them.”

man who protested that it was weeks

of a potato.”

THE HINDENBURG LINE.
IN our earnest endeavour to discover
exactly where this impregnable barrier
is likely to be encountered we have
collected the following references to it
in the German Press of the next few
months:—
. . . Our troops, according to plan,
are now operating to the east of the
Vimy Ridge where the fighting is taking
the direction intended by us. We have
succeeded in restoring a condition of
voluntary elasticity, preparatory to the
occupation of the famous Hindenburg
Line, which covers Douai, St. Quentin
and La Fère.
. . . Our rearguard actions to the
east of St. Quentin are developing in
accordance with our wildest dreams,
our troops, after their brief respite in
the so-called Wotan Line, displaying
their ability in a war of rapid move-
ment. The hesitating British are
disconcerted by the recrudescence of
fluidity on the front. We learn with
satisfaction that our Northern divisions
are now safely established in the Hin-
| denburg Line—to the east of Douai.
. . . We learn to-day with the very
keenest emotion of the complete and
brilliant evacuation of the Siegfried Line,
to the east of Douai, and the re-estab-
lishment of a new measure of liquidity.
British aeroplanes (of which 133 have
been brought down according to plan)
have been making long flights over our
territory with a view to observation of
the Hindenburg Line—on the left bank
of the Meuse. It is said that two of
our machines are missing, but a re-
count has been ordered. There must
be some mistake. -
. . . A shrewd blow has been dealt
to the British by our abandonment, in
agreement with the prospectus, of the
Beckmesser Line. All has gone accord-
ing to our hopes, our longings and our
prayers. We have crossed the Meuse.
. . . The secret is out at last. The
Hindenburg Line, about which there
has been so much speculation, is now
known to run through Liége, Luxem-
burg and Metz. According to schedule
we are now approaching this position,
which has only been attained by an
amazing display of spontaneous vola-
tility on our part. The fighting of the
last few weeks, in the neighbourhood
of the Pogner, Sieglinda, Kurvenal and
Lohengrin Lines, fell out as had been
prognosticated by us.
. . . The importance of Cologne, as
the main bastion of the impregnable
Hindenburg Line, cannot be over-
rated. Our strategical, voluntary and
gratuitous crossing of the Rhine was
carried out according to agenda. . . .
THE IMPERFECT ECONOMIST.
“I weAR my very oldest suits,
I go about in shocking boots,
And (bar potatoes) feed on roots
And various cereal substitutes .
For wheat, and non-imported fruits.
No meat my table now pollutes,
But, though I spare warm-blooded
brutes,
I sometimes sup on frogs and newts.
I often spend laborious days
Supported by a little maize
And rice prepared in divers ways
My appetite at luncheon stays.
From sugar I avert my gaze :
Unsweetened tea my thirst allays;
I never go to any plays
. Or smoke expensive Henry Clays."
Our excellent Economist
His pet cætravagance forgets,
Which rather spoils his little list—
His fifty daily cigarettes.

THE GENERAL.
LAST night, as I was washing up,
And just had rinsed the final cup,
All of a sudden, 'midst the steam,
I fell asleep and dreamt a dream.
I saw myself an old, old man,
Nearing the end of mortal span,
Bent, bald and toothless, lean and
spare,
Hunched in an ancient beehive chair.
Before me stood a little lad
Alive with questions. “Please, Grand-
dad,
Did Daddy fight, and Uncle Joe,
In the Great War of long ago?”
I nodded as I made reply:
“Your Dad was in the H.L.I.,
And Uncle Joseph sailed the sea,
Commander of a T.B.D.,
And Uncle Jack was Major too
“And what,” he asked me, “what were

At once the wonder-waiting eyes
Were opened in a mild surmise;
Smiling, I helped the little man
To mount my knee, and so began :
“When first the War broke out, you see,
Grandma became a V.A.D.;
Your Aunties spent laborious days
In working at Y.M.C.A.'s; -
The servants vanished. Cook was found
Doing the conscript baker's round;
The housemaid, Jane, in shortened skirt
(She always was a brazen flirt),
Forsook her dusters, brooms and pails
To carry on with endless mails.
The parlourmaid became a vet,
The tweeny a conductorette,
And both the others found their missions
In manufacturing munitions.
I was a City man. I knew
No useful trade. What could I do?
Your Granddad, boy, was not the sort
To yield to fate; he was a sport.
I set to work; I rose at six,

Well warmed, well brushed, well valeted.
I spent the morning in a rush
With dustpan, pailandscrubbing-brush;
Then with a string-bag sallied out
To net the cabbage or the sprout,
Or in the neighbouring butcher's shop
Select the juiciest steak or chop.
So when the sun had sought the West,
And brought my toilers home to rest,
Savours more sweet than scent of roses
Greeted their eager-sniffing noses—
Savours of dishes most divine
Prepared and cooked by skill of mine.
I was a General. Now you know
How Generals helped to down the foe.”
The little chap slipped off my knee
And gazed in solemn awe at me,
Stood at attention, stiff and mute,
And gave his very best salute.

JOLLYMOUSE.
IN what I will particularise as the
area of the War zone, there
is a small village-by-a-stream where
Generals stride about the narrow streets
or whirl through them in gigantic cars,
and guards at every corner clank and
turn out umpty times a day. Down
in the hollow the stream by the village
laughs placidly along, mocking at the
Great War, but I doubt if the Generals
have much time to listen to it, for the
village-by-the-stream is a Corps Head-
quarters.
However the Doctor led us (which
includes the War Babe and James the
Acting Adjutant) to the village-by-the-
stream, where, just across the stone
bridge, he indicated on the wall of a
house the legend:
REstaurant For OFFICERs.
TEA, CofFEE, CHAMPAGNE AND ALL
such ARTICLE Is SELL HERE.
“Tea,” he said feelingly, “and there
will be china cups and thin bread-and-
butter, and real milk and come along
in.”
It was rather a composite restaurant.
There was a glassed-in balcony with
tables and chairs; and all around there
were puttees, handkerchiefs, paper-
| weights, inkstands, wrist-watches and
electric torches. There were loose-
leaved pocket diaries of abominable
ingenuity (irresistible to Adjutants);
collars and ties to clothe the neck of
man, and soap to wash it withal. Hair
lotions, safety-razors, pâté de foie gras,
sponges and writing-pads jostled each
other on the shelves. Walking-sticks
and bottles of champagne lay in pro-
fusion on the floor. It was less of a
restaurant than an emporium, but the
Doctor sat down contentedly and rang
the bell; and the War Babe threw out
battle patrols to reconnoitre the position.
He passed unscathed through the bar-
rage of sticks and diaries; evaded skil-
fully the indirect fire of electric torches;
reached his first objective among the
soap-boxes, and there met his fate.
“Doctor,” he demanded suddenly,
“what's ‘savon jollymouse’?”
“Savon,” the doctor began didacti-
cally, “is a preparation of fatty acids
saponified with alkali. It is princi-
pally manufactured from coker-nut oil,
although other similar, if less offensive,
substances are sometimes employed.
In the English tongue it is known as
'soap,' and—”
“You idiot,” said the War Babe
amiably, “I know what ‘savon’ is.
But what's a “jollymouse’?”
“A rodent,” replied the Doctor—
“a small rodent in a state of mental
exhilaration or merriment.”

“Rats."
“Yes, the same definition would also
apply to rats. Jolly rats, that is to say.”
“You’re very bright to-day, Doctor,”
said the War Babe, “but it doesn't
happen to be that kind of mouse at all.
It's j-o-l-i, jolly; m-o-u-s-s-e—"
“Why didn't you say that before ?
That's quite different. It's pronounced
moose—zholimcose.”
The War Babe sniffed.
“I don't believe you know what it
means any more than I do.”
“Son of Mars,” the Doctor answered
gravely, “you are measuring my ignor-
ance by your own—a great mistake.
As a matter of fact that word is put
on the packet simply to deceive unwary
Babes. It has nothing whatever to do
with soap.”
“Well, since you know so much,”
said the War Babe, closing with his
opponent, “what is a jollymouse or
whatever you call it?”
“A zholimoose, my dear,” the Doctor
began, “is very hard to describe and
has to be seen to be believed. A War
Babe would probably not recognise one
if he saw it. To give you a rough
idea, however, it is an airy Will-o'-the-
wispish * >
The bell had done its work at last,
and there suddenly entered by an inner
door a fair-haired, fair-skinned French
girl almost too pretty to be real. The
Doctor paused with his eyes on her and
then his face lit up with triumph.
“Gentlemen,” he said, in a low vi-
brating tone, “behold the zholimoose.
Hush. It will probably come closer if
you don't frighten it.”
“Have you got the landing-net 2"

“Yes. And the killing bottle. It's

sure to scare it. Don't glare at her
like that, War Babe. Pretend you're
a soap-box.”
She hovered on the threshold. It
seemed touch and go . . . and then the
War Babe broke the ice in his choicest
French.
“Mademoiselle !”
“Messieurs " She came daintily
forward and looked inquiries at us all.
“Tay avec-er bread-and-butter, si-
vooplay,” the Doctor ground out in his
execrable lingo. “And–er—I never
can remember the French for milk.”
“Lait?” I suggested.
“That's it. Now, Mademoiselle—
lay. But not canned stuff. Wray lay.”
Her eyes grew wider and wider at
“Comment, M'sieur 2 ''
“Wray lay.”
“I suppose you mean lait
au naturel,” growled James.
“Du lait frais,” I hazarded.
“Ah. Comprends. C'est
triste. Pas de lait frais. Les
hôpitaux prennent tout.”
“No milk 2'' wailed the
Doctor. He looked fixedly at
the table and one saw from
the movement of his lips that
he was mustering his forces
for another plunge into the
language. Meanwhile the
War Babe, whose eyes had
not left the girl's face, ven-
tured again on the thin ice
of speech.
“Mademoiselle,” he began
hesitatingly.
“Oui, M'sieur.” She
turned to him, the picture of
rapt attention. - - - -
“ON est la jollymouse—moose, I

She looked from one to another of us'
in perplexity.
"Qu'est ce qu'il veut dire?” she asked.
“Il veut voir la jolimousse,” we
explained, and the War Babe held out
the soap-box, pointing with expressive
pantomime to the words on it. Her
eyes twinkled appreciatively.
“Nous — nous supposerons que—
vous étes—la jolimouse,” said the War
Babe slowly, choosing his words with
care.
“Bien stur,” James added affirma-
tively.
“Moi 2" She rippled with laughter.
“Oh non. Attendez, Messieurs. Ouait
one mineet.” She flitted through the
door like some beautiful butterfly, and
in a moment returned with the smallest,
softest, warmest lump of blue-grey fur
nestling against her. It was a tiny
blue Persian kitten.

little hard biscuits; and the cups,

larger than liqueur-glasses. But one of

ments. The War Babe sat silently,

A CURRENT EVENT.
YEARs ago Mr. Punch, in a moment
of inspiration (I wrote the article my-
self), suggested that some benevolent
American millionaire might alter the
course of the Gulf Stream so that it
flowed right round these islands. In
the eye of imagination he saw date
palms bordering the Strand, costers
sitting under their own banana trees,
and stately cavalcades of camels bear-
ing wearied City men to Balham or
Putney. (Unhappily he could not look
so far into the future as to forecast the
allotment holders returning home laden
with sugar-canes).

so on).
Mr. Meanly. Good. I will write a

pears in print you might send out
invitations to dinner. There are a lot

them off now. Say a series of three

Mr. Meanly. After the publication

AT THE PLAY.
“THE OLD LADY Shows HER MEDALs.”
Mrs. Dowey (actually a virgin spin-
ster), felt herself out of it because she
had no son at the Front to talk about.
I gathered that it was not so much a
case of unsatisfied yearning for mother-
hood, as that she wanted to hold her
own with the other charwomen who
were represented in the trenches. So
she assumed the relationship of an
anonymous marraine towards a cer-
tain unknown namesake in the Black
Watch, and made boastful pretence of
having received letters from her son.
Suddenly she is confronted with this
Private Dowey, home on leave—a lonely
soldier with no family ties. The joy
that she had taken in her imagined
sense of proprietorship is dashed by
fear of exposure and of possible resent-
ment on his part. At first he treats
her intrusion almost brutally, but is
soon mollified by the offer of food and
other hospitality; and by the time his
leave is up he has developed an almost
filial regard for her. Their parting is
as the parting of a tender - hearted
mother and a rather unemotional son.
The pathos of this scene, though
designed and interpreted with a very
sensitive restraint, was comparatively
obvious — a commonplace, indeed, of
these heart-rending days. There was a
far more subtle and original note of
pathos in the contrast between the
brusque humour of the man's casual
acceptance of the situation and the
timorous, adoring, dog-like devotion of
the woman. Here tears and laughter
were never far apart.
I could wish that the impression left
by this picture had not been a little
spoiled by the final scene, in which she
lingers lovingly over the medals and
uniform of the dead soldier. No good
purpose, dramatic or other, was served
by this gratuitous appendage to a
finished work of art.
Miss JEAN CADELL was simply
wonderful; and Mr. MULCASTER, as
Private Dowey, typically Scottish in his
cautious reservations, was admirable.
Mr. EDGAR WooD played capably as one
of our many eligible but non-combatant
clergymen; and the chorus of aggres-
º humorous charwomen, though
perhaps they had rather too much to
say, said it very well.
Sir JAMEs BARRIE’s other one-Act
play, Seven Women (all rolled into one),
suffered, as might be expected, from
compression. Leonora had to be a
clinging motherly creature, a desperate
flirt, a gifted humourist, a woman with-
out humour, a murderess (out of an
old play by the same author), and two
other types which escape me. In the

course of about a quarter of an hour
she had to give a succinct précis of the
different moods which her versatile per-
sonality might in actual life conceivably
have assumed if she had had a month
to do it in. Miss IRENE WANBRUGH, with
her swift humour and her skill as a
quick-change artist, naturally revelled
in this tour de force, and, thanks to her,
the author came very near to being
justified of his caprice.
Between these two plays was sand-
wiched Mr. A. A. MILNE's
“WURzEL-FLUMMERY.”
There was never any doubt about
the freshness and spontaneity of Mr.
MILNE's humour. The only question
was whether an author so fastidiously
unstagey, who never underlines his
intentions, would be able to accommo-
date himself to the conditions of a
medium that discourages the elliptical
method. Well, he did it, and very art-
fully. He began by making concessions
to the habits of his new audience. He
wouldn't try them too high at first. In
the person of Robert Crawshaw, M.P.
(Mr. NIgEL PLAYFAIR), he introduced
them to a more or less conventional
type—exposed, it is true, to a very un-
usual test of character but dealing with
it as such a type was bound to deal.
Then, having inspired confidence, he
created a rarer atmosphere, and in Denis
Clifton, a blend of solicitor and play-
wright, he produced a figure of fantasy
whose delightfully irresponsible humour
might have found his audience a little
shy at an earlier stage. There was a
real note of distinction, extraordinarily
well maintained, in Clifton's dialogue
with Crawshaw and the boy-clerk, and
Mr. MILNE was particularly fortunate to
have the part interpreted by Mr. Dion
Boucicault, who developed qualities

undreamed of in my previous estima-
tion of his gifts.
When that inveterate cynic, Anthony
Clifton, made a will (it is not Mr.
MILNE's fault that, since he wrote his
play before going out to the Front, we
have had two others turning on eccen-
tric bequests) leaving £50,000 each to
two perfect strangers on the condition
that they adopted the preposterous
name of Wurzel-Flummery, he hoped
to have the grim satisfaction of witness-
ing, from the grave, an exhi-
bition of human weakness.
Of the two legatees—politi-
cians on opposite sides of the
House — Crawshaw, whose
whiskers gave him the air
of a successful grocer of the
mid-Victorian period, found
reasons sufficiently convinc-
ing to himself for accepting
the testator's terms; while
Richard Meriton, who had
little besides his salary as
an M.P., took the high line
of proper pride and declared
his determination to refuse.
Mr. MILNE, by the way, did
not specify the respective
politics of these two, but I
judge, from my knowledge
of his own, that Crawshaw
was meant to be a Tory and
Meriton a Liberal.
The latter eventually
succumbed to pressure on
the part of Crawshaw's
daughter, who cared noth-
ing for names so long as she
could marry the man of her
choice—a prospect denied
to her by her father, who

thought little of poor men. Meanwhile
Meriton's lofty attitude of general con-
tempt for money, and particular con-
tempt for it when offered on degrading
terms, gave scope for a little serious
relief.
There are, of course, more ways of
viewing the question than could becom-
pressed into so short a play. Myself,
I confess to a sneaking sympathy with
the standpoint of Crawshaw. Money
for him did not mean mere self-indul-

gence; it meant outward show — a
house in a better neighbourhood, a
more expensive car, a higher status in
the opinion of his world—all the things
that somehow help in what is called a
career. By accepting the fifty thousand
pounds he would gain something in the
| public eye; by assuming the name of
Wurzel-Flummery he would lose some-
thing. He weighed the two against
one another, and concluded that he
would gain more than he would lose.
This argument furnished a good enough
motive according to his lights.
Meriton, on the other hand, after
professing to prefer a clean heart to
filthy lucre, is persuaded by Violet
Crawshaw, who argues that he would
surely make any sacrifice to save her
from starving, and she was starving
for love. So he yields, saying, in effect,
to Honour, “I love thee, dear; I love
thee much ; , but I love Violet more.”
Incidentally he takes care to overlook
the fact that he was not nobly suffering
an indignity for the sake of a great cause
—such; let us say, as the founding of
a hospital—but that he himself stood
to gain at least as much as the girl...I
am almost afraid that Meriton was a
bit of a hypocrite. Certainly, in view
of his exalted standards, he came out
of the business worse than Crawshaw
did. Perhaps, after all, Mr. MILNE
meant him to be a Tory.
But I must not exploit the pleasant
field of casuistry opened up by the
author's theme, but content myself
with complimenting him
very heartily on his share
of this triple bill, in which,
at the first attempt, he held
his own in the company of
so experienced an artist as
Sir JAMES BARRIE. I ought
to add that he had an ex-
cellent cast, very quick to
appreciate and reproduce
the iridescent gaiety of his
humour. O. S.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Life of Algernon Charles Swinburne (MACMILLAN)
is a book that may be regarded as filling, at least partially,
what has long been an aching void in our biographical
shelves. I say partially, because the time has not perhaps
fully come for an unreserved appreciation of a character
whose handling must present exceptional difficulties. One
cannot but notice how many obstacles Mr. EDMUND GossE
has had to overcome, or avoid, in the present volume. The
result inevitably is a certain sense of over-discretion that
makes the whole study so detached as to be at times lack-
ing in vitality. Even, however, with these reservations the
figure of the poet stands out, bewildering as it must have
been in life, with its strange blend of frailty and genius.
Stories abound also (sometimes one suspects Mr. GossE
of having fallen back upon anecdote with an air of relief);
they range from the early days of brilliant “failures" at
Eton and Balliol to those when in the watchful security of
Putney the lamp was guarded by hands so zealous that
its flame was ultimately extinguished. Two of the tales
remain pleasantly in my memory, one of them describing
how young ALGERNON, lately sent down from Oxford and a
pupil at the rectory of the future Bishop STUBBs, scared
away his host's rustic congregation by leaning upon the
garden-gate one Sunday morning, looking, with his red-
gold hair and scarlet dressing-gown, like some “flaming
apparition.” The other, less picturesque but more credible,
has also a bishop in it, and concerns an untimely recitation
of Les Noyades. I will leave you to find this for yourself
in a book that forms at least an interesting, if not altogether
For an old hand BENJAMIN SwiFT shows a poor discretion
in crowding too many characters into his pages to allow of
anything like adequate characterisation, and indeed, in
What Lies Beneath (CHAPMAN AND HALL), he is too much
concerned with his main purpose of tract-making to be
sufficiently interested in the subsidiary business of good
story-telling. A Mr. Ravendale, an unpleasant, hoary-
bearded patriarch and opulent seller of Bibles, who has
buried three wives and lives in a fat Bloomsbury house
with the collected offspring of his three marriages, and
one or two step-children thrown in, is haunted by a doubt
as to whether the beautiful Ruby Delmore, daughter of the
widow Delmore, his second wife, is also the daughter of the
late Mr. Delmore or of himself, whose attitude towards
Mrs. Delmore had not been as correct as that of a seller of
Bibles is reasonably expected to be, especially by people
like the author who don't believe in Bibles. At any rate
Sebastian, son by the first marriage, is desperately in love
with Ruby—so, you see, the old man had something to
worry about. However, it all turns out to be, in fact, mere
illusion, developing into a fatal monomania, and the family
business is left to be carried on by such of the next genera-
tion as have not been convinced by the formidable array of
evidence, anti-Theistic and anti-Christian, of two of the char-
acters (who, it is clear, have sedulously read the same books).
Sebastian loses his faith apparently because he has been
distressed by the sight of a wounded horse in the great
War, as if it were necessary to wait for the great War for
this kind of a difficulty A certain rough earnestness lies
beneath this rather crude presentment of a world-old
problem. But I wonder how much of the honest patriotism
which fills the book would survive a rationalism as per-
verse and shallow as Mr. SwiFT applies to traditional faiths.

The arrangement of Lady Poore's new volume of
recollections, An Admiral's Wife in the Making (SMITH,
ELDER), reminded me quaintly of certain romances familiar
to my boyhood, in which the fortunes of the hero were
traced from cadetship in aspiring sequence. Because, of
course, this is exactly what happens to the hero of the
present book; the chief difference being that he himself
makes only a brief personal appearance therein (though
the chapters in question, formed from letters and diaries of
Commander Poor E during the Nile Expedition of '85, are
by no means the least interesting part of the volume). For
the rest, one might perhaps call it a draught of Naval
small beer, but a very sparkling beverage and served with
a highly attractive head upon it. To drop metaphor, Lady
Poor E has brought together a most entertaining collection
of breezy reminiscences of life ashore and on the ocean
wave. There is matter to suit all tastes, from her recollec-
tions of economies in a -- - - - - - - - - -

indeed everyone who cared for him, turned their backs in
disdain, then I confess to having felt that Miss SHARP was
trying my forbearance too high. But even so the fact
that I could not throw the book down unfinished seems
to show that whoever selects Mr. UNwiN's débutantes has
spotted another winner. If, in short, Miss SHARP will for-
get all the novels she may ever have read, and choose for
her next story something a little nearer to life, I believe the
result may be remarkable.
Nursing Adventures, with its sub-title, A F.A.N.Y. in
France, is a notable addition to the series of War-literature
which is bringing grist to Messrs. HEINEMANN's windmill.
F.A.N.Y., in case it has you puzzled, means First Aid
Nursing Yeomanry. Starting from one woman this corps
now has over fifty members working in the zone of the
armies, and I shall believe that no one can read of their
efficiency and courage without genuine admiration. This
is not an official account of the F.A.N.Y. Corps—that is to
- - - ----- - come when the Hun is
beaten—but the author has
told enough to convince us
of the sound work that has
been and is being done by
* these brave and gentle-
hearted women. Fortun-
ately she has the gift of
selection, in spite of a rather
breathless style, which how-
ever goes excellently well
with a narrative full of ex-
citement and danger. Here
too once more a fine tribute
is paid to the incorrigible

º jº face of an enemy that has
forgotten the elementary
rules of humanity.
Those who have sampled
any reasonable selection of

book could not have appeared in times more apt to give it
a hearty welcome.
The Stars in their Courses (UNwiN) is not, as you
might possibly suppose, a work of theatrical history, but
just the latest volume in that admirable series, the First
Novel Library. While I am not claiming for it any start-
ling pre-eminence, it is at least a story of more than
ordinary promise, and one that easily contrived to hold my
interest. This is, perhaps, the more odd, since Miss HILDA
M. SHARP has apparently of deliberate intent called in
every one of the three conventions that all good young
novelists are bidden to avoid—the long-nourished revenge,
the missing will, and the super-quixotic self-sacrifice. Natur-
ally the last is the worst. Thus when old Mr. Yardley
(who had, I fancy, more than a touch of the melodramatic
habits of the late Mr. Dombey) planned to revenge himself
upon a faithless wife by bringing up his and her son with
extravagant tastes, and leaving him penniless, I winced but
endured. When, repenting of such inhuman intentions, he
revoked them by a will, carefully placed, for subsequent
discovery, between the pages of a put-away book, I still
held an undaunted course. But, when Patrick, the dis-
inherited spendthrift, took upon himself, for the thinnest
works of “KATHARINE TYNAN” will know what pleasant
fare to expect in Kit (SMITH, ELDER). Kit is a pretty,
red-haired, peasant girl approved for her gentle ways
and honest breeding by Madam of the big house, and
sent, on the advice of one of Mrs. HINKSON's nice, human,
friendly priests, to a convent for the higher education.
She stirs the sentimental soul of one of the English
quality, Captain Guy Dering; is plunged into, and rather
chilled by, high-life in the modern English manner, and
eventually goes back to her own people and her girlhood's
friend, Donal Sheehy, who returns from America a made
man. 'Tis not a chronicle to set the Liffey afire, but it is
wholesome, escapes being mawkish, and may be confidently
recommended for an anxious old person to give to sensitive
young persons—if there be still any such. Mrs. HINKsoN,
though she loves her own, is no blind partisan and does not
spare her criticism. So that you get a plausible picture of
a kindly decent native Irish folk of all sorts, not a little
helpful in these days of stress and promise.

Txcept its saccharine ingredients be
Confined to ten per centum.
The days of decorative art are done - - -
That made the toothsome biscuit more enticing
(Even our wedding-cake when we are one
Will be denuded of its outer icing);
Yea, purest joy of all that we resign,
* A ban is laid upon the luscious tartlet
By him who has for your sweet tooth and mine
No mercy in his heartlet.
And yet, if England, in her night of need, , , -
Debauched by pastry-cook and muffin-monger,
Would have us curb our natural gift of greed
And merely mitigate the pangs of hunger,
Let us renounce life's sweetness from to-day,
And turn, for Hobson's choice, to something higher;
“Good-bye, Criterion' " let us bravely say,
And “Farewell, Rumpelmeyer'."

A PROPER PROPORTION.
(An Interview with Mr. H. G. WELLs),
I Found the Sage, as I had expected, in his study at
Omniscience Lodge. There he sat in his new suit of
Britlings, surrounded by novels and stories in MS. dealing
with every aspect of human affairs, sixty of the more
important being specifically devoted-to the War and the
various ways in which it might conceivably terminate. I
modestly approached and presented myself.
“You have come,” he said with a courteous gesture, “to
discover my views on the present conflict 2" -
“Not exactly,” I said.
“Ah,” he said; “which is it, then 2 You can take your
choice, you know. All you have to do is to select the sub-
ject,” and he handed me a volume resembling Kelly's
Directory in size and colour, and entitled Classified Cata-
logue of Subjects on which Opinions can be furnished at
the Shortest Notice.” I turned the pages breathlessly until
I came to “Class V, Voter; sub-class P, Proportional
Representation.” “There,” I said, “is what I want,” and
I pointed the place out to him. -
“Dear me,” he said, “you desire guidance on a very
simple matter.”
“Well,” I said, “I’m not so sure about that.
rather flummoxed us in our office.
tail * > -
“You may thank your stars,” he interrupted, “that
you've come to the right shop. I'll make it all as clear as
daylight in two shakes of a pig's whisker. Are you ready ?”
I said I was, and he began to pour forth at once.
“Imagine,” he said, “a constituency of 40,000 voters
It has
We can't make head or
who elect four representatives. - Obviously anyone who gets
40,001 votes is elected. Well then, there are ten candi-
dates. All you have to do is to take the quotient of a divided
by y, where a can be raised to the nth power and y can be
raised to the nth — 1, and add to this the least common
denominator of the number of votes cast for the last three
candidates, taking care to eliminate in each case the square
root of z, where 2 equals the number of voters belonging to
the Church of England, minus Archdeacons and Rural
Deans, but inclusive of Minor Canons and Precentors. Do
you follow me?”
“Ye-es,” I said. - - . . "
“I thought you would,” he said. “Next we proceed to
take the multiples of the superhydrates mathematically
converted into decimals, and then, allowing, of course, for
the kilometric variation of the earth's maximum temperature
reduced by the square of the hypotenuse, you begin the
delicate operation of transferring votes from one candidate
to another in packets of not less than one hundred. That's
easy, isn't it?” - -
“Oh, yes,” I said, “that's quite easy.” - - - - - - - -
“Very well then,” he said. “You have now got two
candidates elected, A. and B. You take from them 653
votes, which do not legitimately belong to them, and you
mix them up with the surplus votes of the remaining eight
candidates. Unless C. is a congenital idiot, or a felon, or
otherwise incapacitated, he will then be found to have 4,129
votes, and he too will be elected. For the last place you
must proceed on a basis of geometrical progression. There
are still seven candidates, but four of these have no earthly
and must be withdrawn by a writ of Ne eveat regno, taking
with them the 2,573 votes which are properly or improperly
theirs, and leaving 3,326 votes to be added to those already
recorded for D., who, being thus elected into the position of
fourth letter of the alphabet, will be returned as elected on
the Temperance and Vegetarian ticket. So finally you get
your members duly elected without the blighting inter-
ference of the Caucus and the party wire-pullers generally.
You see that, of course?”
“Yes,” I said, “I suppose I see it.”
“Of course you do, and the others will see it too. And
they'll realise that the House of Commons will be a different
place when the old system is destroyed and every shade of
opinion is represented. But what chiefly appeals to me in
it is its extraordinary simplicity and perspicuous ease. A
child could perform the duties of counter or returning
officer, and any voter, male, or female, can master the
system in about five minutes.”
I thanked Mr. WELLs for his courtesy and staggered
dizzily back to Bouverie Street.
On “How to Dig,” from a recently-published military
manual:—
“To dig well one must dig often. Any series of complex co-ordinated
movements can be performed with the greatest economy of effort
only when they have become semi-reflex; and for this to happen the
correlated series of nervous impulses must be linked up by higher
development of the brain cells.”
A spade is useful, too.
“I did not hear yesterday of the insufficiency of bread supplied at
Restaurants being made up by cakes and guns brought from home.”
- Irish Paper.
We have heard, however, of an insufficiency of alcoholic
refreshment being made up by a “pocket-pistol."
“After all, the custom of marrying only into Royal houses came
to us from Germany, and dates from the Hanoverians . . . The
case of Henry VIII. is well known. Four of his wives were plain
Englishwomen . . .”—Sunday Herald. -
Not so plain, however, as the German one, ANNE of CLEVEs.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
I.
Lewis Gun Officer.— . . . So let me
repeat and impress upon you, men, that
the rifle is an effete weapon—extinct as
the-what-you-call-it bird. It played
its part, a good part, in the South African
War, but we who observed what the
machine gun did then and foretold its
immense development [he was just nine
years old at that time] knew that the
rifle would soon be in the museums
along with the bows and arrows. Pay
attention, Private Jones. The Lewis
Gun, the weapon of opportunity, is a
platoon in itself. I don't know what
the Government want to worry about
men for. The Germans don't fill up their
front trenches with a lot of T
soldiers to be killed with
shrapnel. No, a machine }x",
gun every twenty or thirty a lººk
yards is quite enough to ºr
hold any defensive line.
So just bear these things
in mind; and don't for-
get what we have learnt
to-day. All right. Nine
o'clock to-morrow.

Musketry Officer.— . . . Therefore
you see an infantry soldier has one
weapon and one only—the rifle. You
fellows will be out at the Front pretty
soon. Now, if a man gets up the line,
no matter how strong he is, how well
drilled, if he can't use his rifle he might
just as well not be there for all the good
he is to his country. All the money
that's been spent on his trainin', food,
clothin'—absolutely wasted; might as
well have been thrown into the sea.
Why, the other day a party of our
fellows were heavin' bombs at about
twenty Bosches — threw hundreds ;
couldn't reach 'em. And one sniper
went out and killed the lot in two
minutes. And so . . .

war; has been for three years. The
nature of the fighting may alter, of
course. We all hope it will. But we
must think of trenches at the moment.
Now, the German-is a clever feller, and
he soon saw that you'd never kill off
the enemy if you just sat down behind
a parapet, with a rifle in your hand.
So he started inventing and developing

We understand that Miss Taka
Topnote, the well-known revue artiste,
is bringing an action for defamation
against the dramatic editor of The
Morning Chatterbor, who recently pub-
lished a statement that her salary was
fifteen hundred a week. The lady in-
forms us that as a matter of fact she
is now drawing thirty-five shillings,
with half fees for matinées.
Mr. Buckram, the famous actor-
manager, writes: “A great deal of
nonsense has been published about the
so-called stupendous sums supposed to
be expended on my shows. How such
stories get about. I am at a loss to
imagine. Thus my present entertain-
ment is reported to have cost me
£25,000 before the curtain rose. All I
can say is that, were this the case, the
curtain would never have risen at all.
To speak by the book (which anyone
is at full liberty to inspect) I find
my total initial outlay to have been
£43 11s. 5d., inclusive of free drinks at
the dress-rehearsal. All the members
of my cast are paid as little as possible,
usually in postage-stamps.

out upon a bare stage, the scene re-
presented being “A Theatre during
Rehearsal.” The cast will be entirely
composed of stage hands and dramatic
students; moreover, as both the dia-
logue and situations have been gratui-
tously borrowed from other works of
a similar character, there will be no
author's fees. The very gratifying re-
sult of these measures is that the
management is enabled to present to
the public an entertainment that has
cost nothing at all. Patriotism could
no further go.

If for each noble dream in dormant

The life-spark stirs and glows;
If for the fame of each heroic deed
Some bloom the lovelier grows—
White lily or red rose;
Then, France, thou shouldst be lavish
of thy flowers
For all our dead and thine,
And for all women's tears, or thine or

THE JUDGMENT of THE Ass.
VII.
It was in the year that the donkey
was elected judge, because only he and
the mule came to vote and the mule
spoiled his voting-paper.
The weasel came before the court to
make a serious complaint against the
rat.
“Most learned judge,” said the weasel,
“the rat came to me for advice. ‘Tell
me," he said, “how I can obtain a deli-
cious piece of cheese I have seen.' I
showed him how he could get it. He
ate the cheese, and since then he has
not ceased to revile me.”
“Most unjust,” said the judge.
“What has the rat to say?”
“The rat does not appear,” said the
mule, who was usher.
“And why not 2" asked the judge.
“He is still in the trap,” said the
usher.
“I showed him the way in,” said the
weasel proudly.
“But not the way out,” said the rat's
prospective widow.
“He only asked me how he could
get the cheese, and I showed him,”
said the weasel.
“The weasel shall have the reward
of virtue,” said the judge. “As for the
rat I shall fine him for contempt of
court in not appearing.”
“Justice'" cried the rat's prospec-
tive widow. “I demand my hus-
band.” -
“You shall have him,” said the ass.
“I order the weasel to show you the
way into the trap.”

EXCELSIOR.
“Our ascent to the sun makes our enemy

THE night fell fast, but faster still
A youth came down the darkening hill,
A super-youth, whose super-flag
Flaunted the strange but hackneyed
brag,

His eyes betrayed through gold-rimmed
prism
Myopia and astigmatism :
But, head in air, he proudly strode,
Declaiming down the fatal road,
“Excelsior " ''
The sign-posts clustered left and right
And waved their arms towards the
height;
He heeded not, but through the mist
Plunged steeply down and fiercely
hissed,

“The stars, my boy, are overhead;
The pit of Tophet's deep and wide.”
A sudden snarl of hate replied,

“O stay,” cried Sanity, “and cool
Thy fevered head in yonder pool' "
The balefire smouldered in his eye,
And still he muttered, hurtling by,
“Excelsior' '.'
“Beware the awful precipice
Beware the bottomless abyss' " s
This was Discretion's last Good-night.
He gurgled, as he dropped from sight,
“Excelsior' '.'
At day-break, when the punctual sun
Explored the hill-tops one by one,
And scoured the solitary steep,
An echo rose from out the deep,

And, from the deeper depths that lay
Beyond the farthest reach of day,
A thin voice wailed, and, mocking it,
Crackled the laughter of the pit,

Some Jumbo.
“Jumbo, the giant elephant of the Stosch-
Parasani Circus in Berlin, has been killed for
food, telegraphs the Amsterdam correspondent
of The Daily Express. He yielded fifty-five
tons of flesh.”—Evening Paper (Glasgow).
If this statement had not come from
Amsterdam we should have found some
difficulty in believing it.

A MISNOMER.
ONCE upon a time, in the midst of
the most detestable Spring ever known
—a Spring consisting entirely of hopes
of better weather, raised for no other
purpose than to be so thwarted and
dashed that the spirits of that brave
and much harassed creature, man,
might sink still lower—once upon a
time, even in this Spring, there was
a fine evening. It was more than
fine, it was tender, and, owing to a
North wind, wonderfully luminous, and
|I walked slowly along the hedges—
which were still bare, although April
was far advanced—and listened to the
blackbirds, and marvelled at the light
that made everything so beautiful, and
was filled with gratitude to the late
WILLIAM WILLETT for re-arranging our
foolish hours. -
I soon reached a favourite meadow,
with a view of the hills and clumps of
gorse in it, and, since there were clumps
of gorse, many, many of those alluring
little creatures which live in the ground
and provide man with numbers of bene-
fits—such as sweet flesh to put into
pies; and cheap, soft, warm fur to wrap
Baby Buntings in ; and stubby tails, or
scuts, to be used in hot-houses for trans-
ferring pollen that peach - blossoms
may be fertilised, and (latterly) sym-
bols for Government clerks who prefer
civilian clothes and comfort to khaki
and warfare; and (in Wales) toasted
cheese. I refer to rabbits.
As I stood motionless in this meadow
watching the yellowing sky, I was aware
of an Homeric contest quite close to me.
Two rabbits were engaged in a terrific
battle. They kicked and they scratched
and made the most furious attacks on
each other. The fur flew and the ground
resounded to their thuds. First one
seemed to be winning and then the
other, but there was no flinching.
I had heard of rabbits fighting, but
I had never seen it before. “Very
unfair to have called them Cuthberts,”
I said to myself. -

THE FOOD QUESTION.
RATIONING AT THE Zoo.
“IN the Northern area,” says a des-
patch from Mr. Pocock, “a period of
inactivity has set in which is partly
due to the fact that the dromedary
has been placed on a vegetarian diet.
There has been a cold snap in the croco-
dile house. Three of our keepers have
disappeared.”
An attempt to substitute salsify for
was not successful.
Complaints have been received from
the elephant-house to the effect that
buns sold for the benefit of the occu-
pants have not reached their destina-
tion. Should this abuse continue it
will be necessary to make arrangements
to have every child under the age of
twelve submitted to an X-ray examina-
tion before leaving the Gardens.
The use of human food for the nour-
ishment of animals is, however, being
discouraged; and for the future guinea-
pigs and broken glass will be the staple
diet of boa-constrictors and ostriches
respectively. Peppermint - balls for
grizzly bears are to be discontinued;
also egg-nogg for anthropoid apes.

Jugged Hare.—A well-known firm of
hare-raisers in Carmelite Street informs
us that young rabbits fed on sponge-
cake soaked in port wine have a flavour
which renders them indistinguishable
from hare.
Celeriac.—This appetising vegetable
has been little cultivated owing to a
general but erroneous belief that it was
the name of a new kind of motor-car.
“Celeriac" is of course a compound of
the word “celery" and the Arabic
suffix “ac,” which means “bearing a
resemblance to " or “a small imitation
of.” Thus it would be correct for the
writer to speak of the salariac he earns
by writing this sort of thing.

rect.—ED.]

were well out of the water she was able to

[Baron MoRITz FERDINAND von BIssiNg,
the German Military Governor-General of
Belgium, the murderer of Nurse CAvell, and
instigator of the infamous Belgian deport-
ations, after being granted a rest from his
labours, is reported to have died “of over-
work.”]
TIRED of pillaging and sacking,
Tired of bludgeoning and whacking,
Tired of torturing and racking,
BISSING takes his “rest.”
For the sport of shooting nurses,"
Gloating o'er his victims' hearses,
Answering appeals with curses,
He had lost his zest.
All his diabolic striving
To intensify slave-driving
Could not slay the soul surviving
In a Nation's breast.
Still the flame burns ever brighter
Underneath the blouse or mitre;
Still the smitten greets the smiter
With undaunted crest;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, April 17th.-The re-open-
ing of the House of Commons found
Lord FISHER in his accustomed place
over the clock. What is the lure that
brings him so often to the Peers'
Gallery 2 I think it must be his
strong sense of duty. As Chairman
of the Inventions Board he feels he
ought to lose no opportunity of adding
to his stock.
Quite the most striking feature of the
afternoon was the pink shirt worn by
a well-known Scottish Member, whose
name I refrain from mentioning to
spare him any additional blushes. It
was of such an inflammatory hue that
his brother-legislators at first took it
for a well-developed case of measles
(probably German) and sheered off ac-
cordingly. Nobody knows what caused
him to indulge in the rash act, but it is
hoped in the interests of coherent debate
that he will not do it again.
Mr. DILLON was so much disturbed
by the apparition that, having started
out to demand an immediate General
Election unless the Government at once
granted Home Rule to the whole of
Ireland, he finished by declaring that
he would be satisfied if they would
promise to reform the franchise on the
lines proposed by the SPEAKER's Con-
ference. Incidentally he drew a fancy
picture of himself and his colleagues
striving consistently for thirty-five years
to convert their brother-Irishmen to
constitutional methods; from which I
infer that Mr. DILLON, very wisely, does
not make a study of his own old
speeches.
As the engineer of two successive
extensions of the life of Parliament
Mr. Asquith offered whole-souled sup-
port to the proposal to give a third
renewal to its lease. Apart from any-
thing else, how could a General Election
be satisfactorily conducted when there
was a shortage of paper and posters
were prohibited? “What's the matter
with slates?” whispered a Member from
Wales. If every Candidate paraded his
constituency sandwiched between a
couple of slates showing the details of
his political programme, it would cer-
tainly add to the gaiety of the nation,
besides providing an easy method of
expunging such items as in the course
of the contest might prove unpopular.
A good many silly things have been
said in the last month or two about
HINDENBURG and his imaginary “line,”
but the silliest of all perhaps was the
remark of The Nation that the German
retreat on the Somme “has found our
soldiers wanting.” This article natur-
ally gave great comfort to the enemy,
who possibly overestimates the im-
portance of Mr. MASSINGHAM and the
significance of the title of his paper.
It also found its way to the British
trenches, and caused so great an in-
crease in the habit traditionally ascribed
to the British Army when in Flanders
that Sir Doug LAs HAIG is understood
to have suggested that an embargo
should be placed upon the further ex-
port of such literature.
What most strikes the imagination
is that amid the most stirring events
of the greatest war in history British
Legislators should devote three of their
precious hours to so trumpery an affair.

PAPER SHORTAGE AT A GENERAL
ELECTION.
[The Political Slate (with Sponge) has its
obvious compensations.]
Was this what the old jurist had in
mind when he called the House of
Commons “The Great Inquest of the
Nation ”?
Wednesday, April 18th-On the mo-
tion introduced in both Houses to ex-
press the welcome of Parliament to
our new Ally, Mr. BoNAR LAW, para-
phrasing CANNING, declared that the
New World had stepped in to redress the
balance of the Old ; Mr. AsquitH, with
a fellow-feeling no doubt, lauded the
patience which had enabled President
WILsoN to carry with him a united
nation; and Lord CURZON quoted BRET
HARTE.
A fresh injustice to Ireland was
revealed at Question-time. England
and Scotland are to enjoy an educa-
tional campaign, in which hundreds of
speakers all over the country will
dilate upon the necessity, of reducing
the consumption and preventing the
waste of foodstuffs. But like most
other patriotic schemes it is not to
apply to John Bull's other island,
though I gather that it is at least as
much wanted there as here.
On the third reading of the Parlia-
ment Bill the debate was confined to
Irish Members. Mr. FIELD, who is in
the live-stock trade, led one particularly
fine bull into the Parliamentary arena.
After complaining that Members had
no longer any power in the House,
he went on to say, “We are simply
ciphers behind the leading figures on
the Front Bench.” Surely that, arith-
metically speaking, is the position in
which ciphers are most powerful.
Thursday, April 19th.-The mental
processes of Sir WILLIAM BYLEs are
normally so mysterious that his sug-
gestion that, with the Americans com-
ing in and the Germans making off,
this was the psychological moment for
the British Government to initiate pro-
posals for peace, did not strike the
House at large as specially absurd. It
was, however, both surprised and de-
lighted when Mr. Swift MAcNEILL
interposed with an inquiry whether it
would not be time enough to talk about
peace when the Germans ceased to
blow up hospital ships. When Mr.
BoNAR LAw tactfully observed that
the Supplementary Question was better
than the answer he had prepared, one
felt that the prospects of an Anglo-
Irish entente had appreciably improved.
When the new MINISTER FOR EDUCA- |
TION deposited upon the Table a vast ||
packet of manuscript, and craved the
indulgence of the House if he exceeded
the usual limits of a maiden speech, I
thought of the days when the headline,
“The Duke of Devonshire on Technical
Education,” used to strike on my fevered
spirit with a touch of infinite prose.
Mr. FISHER began in rather professorial
style, but he soon revealed a glow- |
ing enthusiasm for his subject which
thawed the House. His ambition is
to transform the teachers in our ele- |
mentary schools from ill-paid drudges |
into members of a liberal and liberally
remunerated profession. Our record in ||
the War has shown that, as a Naval
Officer wrote to him, “there is some-
thing in your d-d Board School
education after all.”
“The bride, who was given away by her ||
father, was attended by Miss — as demon-
soille d'honneur.”

We fear this marriage was not made
in heaven.

A PAPER PROBLEM.
CoPY of a letter from the Reverend
Laurence Longwind to the Archbishop
of CANTERBURY:—
The Rectory,
Little Pottering,
April 1st, 1917.
My LoRD ARCHBISHOP,-I am writing
to ask whether Your Grace would be
so kind as to assist me in resolving a
case of conscience which, I feel sure,
must be exercising the minds and hearts
of many of my brother clergy at the
present time.
The matter to which I refer is
closely connected with the sad short-
age of paper. It is no doubt known
to Your Grace that many ministers of
the Gospel, though capable of elo-
quence of a high order, write their ser-
mons. Old sermons tend to increase
and multiply at an alarming rate. I
myself have a chest of drawers literally
stuffed with them. What, in Your
Grace's opinion, should be done with
these ? -
Would it be right, in view of the
purpose for which they were written,
to tear them up and send them away
to be pulped 2 Long and earnestly as
I have considered the problem in all
its bearings I am still utterly unable
to arrive at a solution.
No doubt I could sell them and
devote the proceeds to charitable pur-
poses. There is, I am informed, a large
and steady demand for old sermons
amongst the younger clergy who have
not that ripe experience of life which
sixty years in a rural parish cannot fail
to provide. But I am informed that the
dealers do not always offer appropriate
prices. And I should hesitate to make
a traffic in holy things unless I could
make quite certain that no breath of
scandal could result from inadequate
remuneration.
I have sounded my churchwardens
on the subject, but without reaping
any benefit from the advice given.
“Do you see any harm in selling them
simply as paper?” I asked one of them,
a Mr. Bloggs. “Not a rap! Not a rap!
Get rid of 'em!” was his reply. Natur-
ally I felt hurt. It was not so much
what he said as the way he said it.
The mere mention of my sermons
always seems to make him irritable.
Why I cannot imagine.
My dear wife advises me to send
them down to the schoolhouse. The
children, she thinks, might use the
backs (I write on one side of the paper
only) for their sums. But I fear such
an expedient might give rise to a spirit
of irreverence. -
Would Your Grace hold me greatly
to blame were I to raffle them at our
next rummage sale 2 I feel sure they
would fetch a good price. Only yester-
day Miss Tabitha Gingham remarked
to her sister, Miss Mary, “We had a
good long sermon from the Rector this
morning.” I was passing behind their
laurel hedge at the moment, and could
not fail to overhear this meed of praise.
Miss Tabitha is, I should explain, very
hard to please, and if she thinks them
good there must be others in the parish
of the same opinion. I might be able
to raise quite a nice sum for our local
Seed Potato Committee by a Spring
raffle of my longer and more elaborate
compositions. And since everybody is
beginning to take a modern view of
Bonus Bonds I do not think that a
raffle for such a purpose need arouse
serious opposition.
Trusting that Your Grace will be
able to give me your considered opinion
in this matter, which is arousing so
much attention at the present time,
I am, Your Grace's humble and
obedient Servant,
LAURENCE LONG WIND.

NEWS FROM THE AIR.
THE ALLIEs.
THE other day I was in a country
house whose owners are so lost to
shame as still to keep pets. There is a
dog there which is actually allowed
to eat, in defiance of all those Times'
correspondents whose sole idea of this
stimulating and unfailingly devoted
animal is that it is personified greed on
four legs. There are two or three horses
of unusual intelligence, which no doubt
our friend the Hun would long since
have devoured, but which, even though
hunting is over, are by some odd freak
of sentiment or even of loyalty still
kept alive. There are rabbits. And
there is a bird in a cage against the
wall of a small yard. This bird is a
chaffinch, which a friend had brought
over from France.
After I had fraternised shamefully
with all these deplorable drones, my
hostess drew my attention to the
French chaffinch, a fine big fellow,
very tame and cheerful. “We will
feed him,” she said, “and then you
will see something that happens every
day. Something very interesting.”
So saying she poured into a recep-
tacle for the purpose enough seed, no
doubt, to make, mixed with other things,
several admirable thimble-loaves of
bread substitute, and told me to watch.
I watched, and very soon the French
chaffinch, having eaten a certain amount
of the seed, dashed his beak amid the
rest with such violence that it was
spilt over the pan, out of the bars and
down to the ground below.
“That's very wasteful,” I said. “Lord
DEvoNPoRT wouldn't like that—Lord
DEvoNPort wouldn't;” this being the
kind of facetious thing we are all saying
just now, and something facetious being
in this particular house always, for
some reason or other, expected of me.
“Wait a minute,” my hostess re-
plied. “There's more reason in it
than you think.”
And there was.
The whole point of this mediocre
narrative consists in the fact that
within a few seconds some dozen spar-
rows had descended to the yard and
were feeding busily while the chaffinch
watched from above. And this happens
at every mealtime. -
To what extent we are contributing
to the French Commissariat I cannot
say; but with my own eyes I have seen
a French citizen being systematically
generous to his English cousins.

A PERSONAL TRIUMPH.
ALways at the same point of my rail-
way journey North I drop my paper
and wait till a certain trim red-roofed
ivy-clad cottage comes into view across
the fields to the right. Till yesterday
there were two reasons why I should
hail this cottage with delight. First of
all, it stands where trim cottages are
rarer than pit-heads and slag heaps;
and, secondly, GEORGE STEPHENsoN
once lived there. From now onwards,
however, I have a third and more com-
pelling reason for respecting the old
building. You shall hear. -
plied Smithson, “though it certainly
begins with an A.” -
“True,” I corrected. “Anno Domini.”
“Conceivably—but the second letter

I left Smithson painfully to recon-
struct A-U-G-U-S-T from among the
ivy. He had got to the M of a long
date when a burst of sun cast a crisp
shadow across the dial.
“I don't think much of GEORGE
STEPHENSON after all,” I said. “His

Smithson with his accustomed reserve

I knew that).
“Quá stile it is perfect. What do

I went at it bald-headed. “Pereunt

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN these days, when everybody has his reminiscences,
there should still be a welcome for so genial a volume as
A Soldier's Memories (JENKINs), into which Major-General
Sir GEORGE YouNGHUsbAND has gathered his “Recollections
of People, Places and Things.” The title truly indicates
the character of the contents, which are exactly what you
would expect from a plain blunt man, who loves his friends,
and equally loves a good story about them, at his own or
their expense, impartially. The anecdotes in the book are
legion, and the actors in them range from troopers to
generals, and beyond. KING Edward, their present
Majesties, Sir Douglas HAIG (“a nice -looking clean
little boy in an Eton jacket and collar’) all figure in the
author's pictures of the past, which include also a highly
characteristic study of WILLIAM THE FRIGHTFUL, congratu-
lating the “citizens of Salisbury,” represented by a hand-
ful of curious urchins, upon their “beautiful and ancient
cathedral.” (One can fancy the unspoken addition in the
Imperial mind, “And what a target for Berthal"). Many
of Sir GEORGE's pages are devoted to stories of the Boer
campaign, that old unhappy far-off thing that seems
somehow, as one looks back to-day, further off than
Waterloo. In fine, a book that all Service folk, and many
besides them, will find a treasure-house of good stories, of
exactly the kind that should be certain of their appeal
now, when we are all, or like to think ourselves, soldiers
in the greatest of England's wars, and inheritors of the
traditions here shown in the making.
A short hour's reading and you will have laid down, with
a sigh for its brevity, a little book that is a very model of
artistry. It is by Mr. E. W. LUCAs, and Outposts of Mercy
is its happy name. But I am not to seek reflected glory
by the praising of a colleague; simply for the sake of the
cause that he pleads I wish to commend this fascinating
account of the author's visit, in the company of Lord
Monson, Chief Commissioner, to the stations of the British
Red Cross on the Carso, at Gorizia and among the Carnic and
Julian Alps. Resisting sternly the temptation to embroider
his theme with the distractions of scene and circumstance
(of course he had to tell us of that dinner at the mess of an
Alpine regiment where he met the man who had discovered
the “Venus of Cyrene"), he keeps as closely as may be to
his main subject, but cannot escape from infusing it with
his own sense of colour and romance and the unconscious
appeal of his personality. One may envy him his rare
experience, yet fully share his pride in the fearless devotion
of the men and women of our race (one can imagine it of
no other) in these perilous and lonely outposts of mercy.
A little paper book, illustrated with little photographs,
and costing just a shilling. The author and his publishers
(METHUEN) are devoting the profits to the British Red
Cross; so you who buy and read it—and I don't see
how anybody can refuse—may extract a claim to virtue
from an hour of pure delight.
A quiet style, keen powers of observation, and a delightful
assumption of his own unimportance combine to make Mr.
FREDERick PALMER's With the New Army on the Somme
(MURRAY) a book that will be read long after the Hun
has returned to the place from which he came. “Those
whose business it was to observe, the six correspondents
... went and came always with a sense of incapacity and
sometimes with a feeling that writing was a worthless
business when others were fighting.” There we have his

apology for doing what obviously seemed to him a second-
best thing; but much as I like his modesty I can assure
him that no finer tribute has yet been paid to our new
army. Mr. PALMER was the accredited American corre-
spondent at the British Front, and though the days are
happily passed when he was a neutral in name his posi-
tion as an impartial spectator gives him an advantage
denied to the most veracious of our own correspondents.
Our French Allies too may be congratulated, by themselves
as well as by us, on being observed by eyes so shrewd
and friendly. “No two French soldiers seem quite alike
on the march or when moving about a village on leave.
Each seems three beings—one a Frenchman, one a soldier,
a third himself.” Anyone who has been in the war-zone
and seen a French regiment resting cannot fail to be struck
by the acuteness of this remark; indeed it provides the
key to what, for an ordinary British mind, is a puzzle. It
is one of Mr. PALMER's many virtues that, although his main
business was to watch the soldiers and the fighting, he
his historical record the
added interest of a study
in psychology. -% ſº

“fiery” Southerner. In real life Southerners are melancholy
men with a tendency to embonpoint and clawhammer coats
of ante-bellum design. But in Lesser American Fiction they
are for some undiscovered reason always “fiery.” To the fiery
one the heroine “unconsciously turns" when the apparent
earmarks of the hero's wormhood are dramatically revealed,
and of course she hands him what she would probably de-
scribe as the “sister” stuff when the gentleman emerges in
his natural colours. That is what makes the story-book
Southerner so fiery. Place these complex characters in an
imaginary Carribean Republic, a sort of transpontine Ruri-
tania; add a revolution fostered by the serpentine diplomats
of a European power; let the American eagle issue a few
screams, and there you have the environment in which The
Unspeakable Perk lives and moves and has his unreal being.
The keynote of SAMUEL Hopkins ADAMs' story is what the
Perk person would describe as a want of “pep.” Even the
villains turn out to be comparative gentlemen in the end, the
dirty work being conveniently fastened upon some “person
or persons unknown.” The yarn is well enough to wile away
an hour; but in these days of burning realities fiction has
lost its bite unless it too is informed with the spirit of reality.

some mental agitation, due to the author's deliberately
baffling method of starting her plot. The hero, for
example, is introduced to us abed, and semi-delirious,

detests. He appears to be in a house strange to him,
which contains also an unpleasant old woman and a queer
little boy whose behaviour is wrop in mystery. Slowly,
perhaps somewhat too slowly, it is revealed that the hero
has been knocked silly by a large stone dropped upon his
unoffending head by the small boy. But why? And why
does the child protest his innocence with such apparent
good faith ? These problems I must leave MARGARET
WESTRUP (Mrs. W. STAcEy) to resolve in her own unhurried
way. Of course before long the “little aversion” between
hero and heroine gives place to an emotion more appro-
priate. But there remains an obstacle to their union, one
concerned (also, of course) with the detestable grandmother

§ 1. Mrs. “J. E. BUCKRose”
is one of those writers
whose work can always
be depended upon. A
pinch of pathos, a soupçon
of sentiment, a spice of humour—there you have the recipe,
and a very palatable mixture it makes. The common ele-
ment that pervades the dozen stories which compose War-
Time in Our Street (Hodder AND Stoughton), all in the
author's best manner, is the staunch devotion to duty
displayed by her heroines under stress of war. Pangs of
hunger are endured nobly, hard-hearted folk are softened,
lonely women fight and win the battle against depression.
If these pictures of life behind the windows of our village
streets are too couleur de BUCKRose to be quite true, there is
nevertheless a real quality in them. They are not for the
cynic, but for readers who can appreciate simple tales of
simple people, told without affectation.
“To shoot well at fixed targets, after the range has bten exactly
registered, as in trench warfare, is one thing, but front and pick up
distances smarly, is quite to trot into action, unlimber and form
action another, and this is where many phophets anticipated our new
Army would be found wanting, but prophecy is becoming a profitless
business in this war.”—Bath Herald.

THE POTSDAM ALTRUIST.
[The Frankfurter Zeitung protests against the idea that “the
KAISER in Germany's gravest times allows anxiety about himself or
his dynasty to have access to his thoughts.”]
AMONG the penalties imposed on Kings
Who govern absolutely by divine right,
I am no more affected by the things
That Socialists and other dirty swine write
Than when a pin is thrust
Into a pachyderm's indifferent crust.
But now I deign to answer, even I,
The vilest yet of these revolting sallies,
Where they allege that when our German sky
Rocks to the air of “Deutschland iiber alles,”
“Und Ich,” I add (aside),
“Ich iber Deutschland ' " There the blighters lied.
I'm not like that. I never use the first
Personal pronoun, like the Monarch Louis,
Who said (in French—a tongue I deem accurst),
“L'état, c'est moi." My conscience, clear and dewy,
Tells me that, as a Kaiser,
I am a very poor self-advertiser.
This is a feature of our dynasty ;
And no historian who has ever studied
The traits peculiar to the family tree
On which the Hohenzollern genus budded
In all that noble list
Has come across a single egoist.
They loved their people better than their throne;
Lightly they sat on it, dispensing Freedom;
They never said, “Your souls are not your own,
But simply there in case your King should need 'em;”
They would have thought it odd
To want to be regarded as a god.
Thus have I served my land; and if a wave
Of lurid revolution overswept her,
And I, her loyal and obedient slave,
Were called upon to down my orb and sceptre,
That grace I'd freely do,
And so, I'm sure, would LITTLE WILLIE too.
O. S.
GEMS FROM THE JUNIORS.
THE following articles have been written by a little band
of patriots who, without any hope of gain or self-aggran-
disement, have poured forth of their store of wisdom and
experience for the instruction, comfort and encouragement
of their fellow-countrymen :-
THE BRITISH NAVY.
We are all very proud of the Navy. It is the largest in
the world and all the men in it are very brave, and kind too
I expeck. ALFRED THE GREAT invented it hundreds of
years ago so it has had a long time to practis in. When a
sailer wants to say yes he says Ay, ay, sir, not offen mum
because the captain is always a man. Perhaps some day
he wont be. I have got an uncle who is a captain in the
Navy. He says that in the olden days sailers had such
bad food that it walked about and if it was up the other end
of the table you ony had to whissel and it came down your
end dubble quick. But I don't know if that is true. Any-
how everything is all rite now but this plesant thouhgt
must not stop us sending parsels to the sailers, as you cant
fish up cakes and apples out of the sea and they like them
very much. John BRIGHT (age 94).
SoLGIERs.
Solgiers wear karki. If you are an offiser the othere
salut you if you arn't they don't. ... People musn't kill
each other unless they have to becos it's rwong. Solgiers
have to. They have to pollish there buttens as well. It is
there cheef job unless they are offisers. Then they don't
becos they get paid more and let some one else do it for
them. Before the war solgiers were only one kind of
man, now they are all kinds but mostly good. Granpa
is a genral so he knows. A frend of fathers is a private,
he is quite nice but he mayn't come to dinner when
granpas here. I shall be a solgier when I grow up
praps a genral but Im not sure. I would like to be some-
one with a sord and a drum. Granpa hasn't got a drum.
Douglas BAYSwATER (age 8).
AMERICA.
America is really the name of a continent but when we
say America we mean the bit of it that used to belong to
us. Americans do not have a king they used to have our
King but they gave him up. It wasn't the King we have
now or perhaps they wouldn't have. So they have someone
called a President who does instead but he doesn't wear a
crown and he only lasts a short time like the Lord Mare or
a little longer. Besides the President there are men called
millonares, they are normously rich and do insted of princes
and dukes, who they haven't got either but not because
they don't like them but because it is a Republic. Ameri-
cans don't like war but if they have to fight they can do it
all right Father says. MARY GREY (age 10).
OUR ALLIES.
It is with great pleasure that I take up my pen to write
about Our Allies. They are France, Belgium, Russia, Italy,
Serbia, Portugal, Rumania, and America. I think thats
all at present but eight is a good number. To begin with
France. In time of peace the French are a gay and polite
people which is very nice I think. They are noted for
their coffee and for their fashions as both are better than
ours. And all the women can cook. How beautiful it
would be for England if she could imitate her sister
country in these things! I can make a cake but not a
very light one. Now let us look at Verdun on the map.
It is a great fortress and the Germans thought they could
take it but I rejoice to say they couldn't as the bravery
and patrioticness of the French troops came in the way.
Belgium is the next on the list. Belgium is a little country
and Germany is a big one so of course the Germans had
the best of it at first but they won't much longer. So it
will be all right soon if we dont eat too many sweets and
things. Russia, Italy, Serbia, Portugal, Rumania, America
and Montynegro, which I forgot before, are all splendid
countries but space forbids more.
KATHLEEN CHALFoNT (age 12).
The German soldiers' opinion of “retirement according
to plan " : “Each for himself; and the Devil take the
Hindenburg.” -
“To fill up the gaps in the ranks trains of German reserves are
being hushed to the front incessantly.”—Star.
We don't believe this. The Bosch has long given up the
habit of singing as he goes into battle.
“J. J. (New Brighton) sends us a case of a novel method to keep
out would-be marauders from the garden. A friend of his who has
some expensive ferns planted in a rockery put up the notice, “Beware
of the Scolopendriums and Polypodiums —which, of course, are the
Latin names of garden insects.”—Pearson's Weekly.
Clearly a case of nature mimicry.

REVIVALS AND Revisions.
“IT" (as Mr. GossE says at the
beginning of his fascinating mono-
graph on Sw1NBURNE, a work which
we understand has just been crowned
by the Band of Hope) it is now beyond
doubt that Mr. H. B. IRVING's drastic
way with Hamlet is to have a far-
reaching effect on all revivals. New
authors can be acted more or less as
they write, or as they happen to be
stronger or weaker than their “pro-
ducers ”; but to be revived is hence-
forward to be revised, and fairly strin-
gently too.
Mr. IRVING has made a clearance of
certain parts of Hamlet which interfere
made recognisable and friendly. Thus
d'Artagnan will become an airman,
Aramis a padre with fighting instincts,
Athos a general, and Porthos an officer
in the A.S.C. A certain amount of
re-writing and adjusting is necessary,
but that will come.”
In order to find Mr. GEORGE GRos- "
SMITH, of the old firm of Grossmith
and Laurillard, who is now, as all the
world, and especially Germany, knows,
a conning-tower of strength in the
Navy, it is necessary to visit the North
Sea; but Mr. Punch's middle-aged men
stick at nothing.
“Yes,” said Mr. GRossMITH, “we
are doing The Bells. Mr. IRVING has
kindly leased it to us. But we are not
with the movement of IT
its story. Actuated by
old-fashioned motives
and writing for a public
that was not yet wholly
lacking in discrimina-
tion, SHAKSPEARE did
his best to make Ham-
let a poetical as well
as a dramatic tragedy.
With this end in view
he accumulated the
mass of rhetoric with
which we are now so
familiar. It has been
Mr. IRVING's task to
prune this well-meant
but somewhat exces-
sive verbiage so that
the real dramatic stuff
can at last “get over.”
But he has done no
more. Any rumour to
the effect that he has
introduced American
songs or dances, or
that a “joy plank”
bisects the stalls of the L "
UNPLEASANT NIGHTMARE of HANs, THE Ex-CINEMA ATTENDANT, AFTER LEARNING
of THE AMERICAN DECLARATION of WAR.
means that one old play can be mul-
tiplied into as many new plays as the
thoroughly conscientious brains through
which it passes. The two managers who
have cast longing eyes on SHERIDAN's
comedy are Mr. SEYMoUR HIcks and
Mr. OscAR Asche. Mr. SEYMoUR Hicks
is convinced that there is a new lease
of life for this play if it is taken at
a quicker pace. He has therefore
arranged an acting version which will
occupy about an hour, with laughs.
By eliminating the word “sentiment”
alone, which is tediously harped upon,
several minutes are saved. Some of Sir
Peter and Lady Teazle's repetition of the
word “Never” also goes. The satirical
conversation in Act I. is much abbrevi-
- ~ |ated as being out of date,
and the wholepieceis re-
dressed in the present
manner. Mr. Asch E
also is re-dressing it,
or rather un-dressing
it. In his opinion what
the play lacks is a touch
of savagery. It is too
sophisticated. He has
therefore kept no more
of the plot than is con-
sistent with a change of
| scene to Hawaii, the
fashionable primitive
country of the moment.
By this change, even if
a little of the wit and
spirit evaporate, a cer-
tain force is gained, a
powerfulepidermic part
for Miss LILY BRAYTON
as Mrs. Candour (the
new heroine of the
comedy) being not only
| possible but natural.
|Mr. Asche himself will
play Charles Surface,
Savoy, is untrue and deserves the se-
verest denial.
One of Mr. Punch's livest although
middle-aged wires, who has been inter-
viewing the great managers of the
Metropolis — and by great he means
those most likely to become revivalists
—says that it is the same tale with all.
For example, Mr. FRED TERRY, inter-
viewed at his home near the Zoo, in
his study furnished with the works
of all the greatest writers, from the
Baroness ORCzY to HAVELOCK ELLIS,
admitted that it was perfectly true that
he was contemplating a revival of The
Three Musketeers, with certain altera-
tions to bring it into line with modern
taste in warrior heroes.
“To-day,” said Mr. TERRY, “as
you may have noticed, soldiers wear
khaki. Very well then, the musketeers
shall wear khaki.
They shall also be
transformed into Englishmen and be valuable is Mr. IRVING's lead, for it
adhering too slavishly to the plot, nor
does he wish us to ; and, in fact, we
have turned the part made so famous
by Mr. IRVING's father into something
a shade more droll, to suit Mr. LESLIE
HENSON, than whom, I take the liberty
of thinking"—here the young officer
saluted—“no funnier comedian now
walks the boards. We are also chang-
ing the title from The Bells to The
Belles, as being more in keeping with
Gaiety traditions. But I must ask
you to excuse me; I fancy Sir DAVID
BEATTY wants me.”
But the most interesting case of
revision will be that of The School for
Scandal, because, two managements
being at work upon it, each with some-
what peculiar ideas, the public will
be presented, at the same time, with
versions so unlike as to amount to two
different plays. And this suggests how
with the accent on the surface, since
he turns out to be a devotee of sun-
baths and the simple life.
In reply to a cablegram to America,
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE sends
the following message:—“Am busy re-
hearsing He Stoops to Cinema; or, The
Mistakes of a Knight.”

Oh, I'm tired of the noise and the turmoil of battle,
And I'm even upset by the lowing of cattle,
And the clang of the bluebells is death to my liver,

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS.
LX. , -
MY DEAR CHARLEs, – Those who
insist that between the Higher Com-
mands on either side there is a tacit
understanding not to disregard each
other's personal comfort and welfare
must now modify their views. Recent
movements show that there is no such
bargain, or else that the lawless Hun
has broken it. He has attained little
else by his destructiveness save the
discomfort of H.Q. Otherwise the
War progresses as merrily as ever;
more merrily, perhaps, owing to the
difficulties to be overcome. Soldiers
love difficulties to overcome. That is
their business in life. -
It was open to the Camp Com-
mandant, when it became likely that
H.Q. would move, to go sick, to retire
from business, or else, locking his front-
door, shutting his shutters, disconnect-
ing his telephone and confining to their
billets all potential bearers of urgent
messages, to isolate himself from the
throbbing world around him. Being
a soldier himself, however, he was
undone by his own innate lust for
overcoming difficulties. He was seen
hovering about, as good as asking for
the instructions he most dreaded. And
he got them, short and sharp, as all
good military instructions should be.
If I was called upon to move a busy
community from one village to another,
and if the other village was discovered,
upon inquiry, not to be there, I should
ask for ten to twelve months' time to
do it in. The C.C. asked for a fort-
night, hoping to get ten days; he got
a week. “It is now the 31st. We
should move to the new place about
the 7th,” said the Highest Authority.
“Let it be April 7th.” Thus April 7th
became permanently and irrevocably
fixed. For everybody except the C.C.
and his accomplices the thing was as
good as done.
The ultimatum went forth at 10 A.M.
at noon on the same day; the period of
unrest for the C.C. was well set in.
Every department, learning by instinct
what was forward, forth with discovered
what it had long suspected, its own
immediate and paramount importance.
Every department appointed a repre-
sentative to go round and see the C.C.
about it, another representative to write
to him about it, and a third to ring him
up on the telephone, and go on ringing
him up on the telephone, about it. The
only departments that kept modestly in
the background were those upon which
the execution of the move fell. The
C.C., noting the queue of representa-
tives at his front-door and the agitation
back-door, and went to look for the
workers, and, when he'd found them,
he lived with them, night and day,
here, there and everywhere. -
Humanity is not constituted for such
close friendships. As time passed the
C.C. and his accomplices found relations
becoming strained. They said things
to each other which afterwards they
regretted. Meanwhile also the de-
partments with the paramount and
immediate needs grew bitter and rest-
less. Only the Highest Authorities
remained tranquil.
I'm told it was an A.D.C. who
called attention to the difficulty of
milk supply. This was a popular
suggestion; it was just the sort of
difficulty a soldier loves. In the bare
and arid circumstances of the new
camp there was no milk supply. “Buy
one,” said the Highest Authority, and
again the thing was as good as done,
except for the C.C., who had to think
out a cow, so to speak, with regard
to its purchase, equipment, transport,
housing, maintenance and education.
A man of infinite variety, the arrival of
the cow (in bulk) found the C.C. non-
plussed. He could not even begin to
solve the food question. To him it
seemed there were only two alterna-
tives for the beast: bully beef or ration
allowance at three francs a day in lieu
of rations. The cow, he was told, was
entitled and likely to refuse both.
We all crowded round the C.C. to
help. “As to a simple matter like
food,” said A. and Q., “the Lord will
provide. But as to the more difficult
and complicated matters of establish-
ment we will issue your orders.” These
ran : “Reference Cow: (1) This unit
should be shown on your Weekly
Strength Return, with a statement of
all casualties affecting same. Casual-
ties include admission to or evacuation
from hospital ; change of address ;
marriage, and leave to the United
Kingdom. (2) To be brought on the
proper establishment of H.Q., it should
be shown as “Officer's Charger, one,’
and should be trained and employed by
you as such. (3) Please report action
taken, and whether by you or by the
Cow.”
Even as the C.C. was contemplating
this communication and hearkening to
the cow grumbling away in his front-
garden, his old regiment took occasion
to march through the village and, in
so doing, added insult to injury. The
regiment had a mascot; the mascot
was a goat; the goat fell out on the
march and went sick. It did this in
that portion of the C.C.'s front garden
which was not already occupied by the
cow, and its orders from the Colonel,
who was its C.O. and had once been

As there is no terrible
complication which may not occur in
the life of such, so there is no bitter
irony which may not follow all. The
early afternoon of April 6th found the
C.C. on the site of the new camp, sur-
rounded by confusion and an angry
crowd of experts. There had been
only just not been blows, and all with
regard to this wretched and incessant
subject of April 7th. The C.C., never
broad-minded on the point, had become
positively ridiculous and tiresome about
that irrevocable date, April 7th. It
was a dull subject in any case, said
the experts, but in the circumstances
it was inane and cruel to go on insist-
ing on it. R.E., Lorries, Signals and
all their suites, not having been on
too friendly terms among themselves
these latter days, were fast becoming
united in their intense loathing of the
C.C. and his everlasting and impossible
April 7th.
At this moment the Highest Au-
thority itself arrived on the scene to
have a look at it. He was not in the
least discontented with what he saw ;
he was inclined to congratulate the
experts upon their expedition.
“We shall be hard put to it, Sir,”
said the C.C., “to be ready for to-
morrow.”
“To - morrow 2" said the Highest
Authority. “Why to-morrow particu-
larly 2” - -
“To-morrow is the 7th, Sir,"
the C.C., with sinister emphasis.
“And what about it if it is?” asked
the Highest Authority.
“We have to move in here on April
7th, Sir,” said the C.C., with almost an
injured note in his voice.
“Have you?” said the Highest Au-
thority. “Why?" -

HAIL and Farewell, dear Brother of the Pen,
Maker of sunshine for the minds of men,
Lord of bright cheer and master of our hearts—
What plaint is fit when such a friend departs 2
Not with mere ceremonial words of woe
Come we to mourn—you would not have it so :
But with our memories stored with joyous fun,
Your constant largesse till your life was done,
With quips, that flashed through frequent twists
and bends,
Caught from the common intercourse of friends;
And gay allusions gayer for the zest
Of one who hurt no friend and spared no jest.
What arts were yours that taught you to indite
What all men thought, but only you could write
That wrung from gloom itself a fleeting smile :
Rippled with laughter but refrained from guile;
Led you to prick some bladder of conceit
Or trip intrusive folly's blundering feet,
While wisdom at your call came down to earth,
Unbent awhile and gave a hand to mirth !
You too had pondered mid your jesting strife
The deeper issues of our mortal life;
Guided to God by faith no doubt could dim
You fought your fight and left the rest to Him,
Content to set your heart on things above
And rule your days by laughter and by love.
Rest in our memories 1 You are guarded there
By those who knew you as you lived and were.
There mid our Happy Thoughts you take your stand,
A sun-girt shade, and light that shadow-land. C. L.

accomplished orators, must have
been deeply disappointed. The
one subject that the House of
Commons seems to care about is
food.
The CoNTRoller has hit one
section of the House in its ten-
derest portion. Those Members
who make their mid-day meal off
tea and bread-and-butter think it
very hard that they should be al-
lowed no more bread than others,
who take the full luncheon. On A
their behalf Mr. LUNDoN, like The
Carpenter, said, “Give us another
slice.” But, despite a slight
facial resemblance to The Walrus,
Colonel LockwooD was inexor-
able.
The late Mr. JUSTIN MCCARTHY
was once described by his ex-
leader as “a nice old gentleman
for a quiet tea-party.” If any--
one had said that a Sunday-
| School treat would furnish the
appropriate milieu for that ar-
dent Pacifist, Mr. Jowett, I
should, until this afternoon, have
been inclined to agree with him.
But it is evident that his ac-
| quaintance with Sunday-School
treats is purely academic, for in re-
questing the Food CoNTROLLER to
remove the ban lately placed upon them
he spoke of the treat as a “simple
meal, consisting of a bun and tea only.”
The italic is our own comment on this
estimate of the capacity of our brave
tea-fighters.
Tuesday, April 24th.-Those Mem-

somewhat depressed by the thought of
the impending loss to the nation of
their valuable services, are plucking up
heart again now that the #. of Parlia-
ment is to be once more extended. Mr.
KING, for example, was in his best form

that his advice to the Board of Agri-
culture to set a good example to the
country by sending their racehorses
out to grass was well received, for any
reference to the Government stud is

Another little joke which tickled the

Another ex-Minister of Agriculture

I should be doing Mr. RUNCIMAN little
injustice to say that for the moment

on the Treasury Bench. He pointed
out that if high wages and good con-
ditions were to be secured for agri-
cultural workers the prosperity of the
agricultural industry as a whole must
be ensured; and he hoped that the

| Sir HEpworth MEUx must be careful
or he will jeopardize his reputation as
a humourist. Mr. PARTINGTON having
asked whether the Government would
put down their racehorses, the gallant
Admiral could think of no better jest
than that the proposal was as futile
as that of the hon. Member's name-
sake, who endeavoured to keep out the
Atlantic with a mop. Shortly after-
wards Mr. YEo asked whether the
Government would consider the destruc-
tion of cats, with a view, perhaps, to
the suppression of MEUx.
The Corn Production Bill had to run
the gauntlet of a good many criticisms
during the second day's debate. The
unkindest cut of all was delivered by
the SPEAKER. Mr. MoDTENo had asked
whether Members who were landowners
or farmers might vote on a measure
affecting their financial interests, and
Mr. Lowther replied that the benefits
were “so problematical and so uncer-
--
wº-
-
tain" that he thought they might. Mr.
MolteNo used his freedom to vote
against the Second Reading; but only
a handful of Members followed his ex-
ample. Mr. RuncIMAN and his friends
decided that abstention was the better
part of valour.
Thursday, April 26th.-Major BAIRD
made a modest and candid defence of
the Air Board against its many critics.
He did not pretend that they were yet
satisfied — in the case of so new a
service there could be no finality—but
he claimed that the departments had
worked much more harmoniously since
they were all housed under the hospit-
able roof of the Hotel Cecil, a statement
which Lord HUGH of that ilk subse-
quently endorsed. Major BAIRD, despite
the general mildness of his voice and
demeanour, can deliver a good hard
knock on occasion. He warned the
House against indulging in a certain
class of criticism, on the ground that
there was no surer way of killing an
airman than to destroy his confidence
in the machine he was flying; and he
asserted that the “mastery of the air”
was a meaningless phrase impossible of
realization. I think Mr. PEMBERTON-
Hicks and Mr. JoyNsoN-BILLING took
the rebuke to heart, for they were
much less aggressive than usual.

At least we don't get arrowroot–
Nor have I even ever seen a

Except for chlorine in the tea.
I think that's all, so now will end,
Hoping this finds you, dearest friend,
Just as it leaves me, in the pink

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
- ing, the spurs to dull revenge,
AT THE PLAY.
“HAMLET.”
To prepare a very own version of
Hamlet and play it with credit—that
is still the blue riband of the Stage.
Mr. H. B. IRVING has fairly won it.
The version seemed to me apt. IIe
tells us that his main purpose was to
bring out the story as if for those who
had never seen the play before. It is
a rational point of view, and certainly
it seemed a distinct improvement not
to lose sight of Hamlet's adventure to
England, as is commonly the case, and
to keep the essential sequence of events
and the personality of the Prince con-
stantly before the audience. The justi-
fication of the heroic cuts and
adaptations was that the action
did move faster towards the tragic
end, instead of seeming to drag
rather tiresomely as (be it con-
ſessed) it sometimes does.
Observers contrasting this with
Mr. IRVING's earlier performance
remarked a gain in depth and
fire and a happier restraint of
mannerism. It was a very notable
and gracious piece of work. He
has the player's first gift, an
arresting personality. His elocu-
tion has distinction. He conveys
the beauty of the words and the
richness of the packed thought
thoughtfully. The complex play
of action and motive—the pur-
pose blunted by overmuch think-
the self-contempt, the assumed
antic disposition, at times the real
mental disturbance—all this was
set before us with a fine skill
and resource. The “To be or
not to be” soliloquy was masterly
in its sincerity and restraint; the
two broken love passages with Ophelia
showed a fine tenderness through the
distraught, bitter mood. An ingenious
turn was given to that difficult change
of weapons in the fencing bout, though
I doubt if the Sword Club would wholly
have approved the technique of the
fencing. . .
Miss GERTRUDE ELLIott's Ophelia
in the Mad Scene was full of beauty,
sweetness and dignity—and we have
so often been bored by our lesser
Ophelias. A very fine performance.
Mr. HolMAN CLARK was the foolish
prating knave, a Polonius robbed of his
best speech, and the more consistent
therefore. Mr. IRVING is obviously
right in his view that Polonius could
never by any chance have given any
such advice to his truculent son.
One may congratulate the producer
on the courage of his convictions. But
I wonder if the Shakspearean tradition

is really dying. The general quality of
the performance was, it must be con-

“The question is,” said that
dejected officer, fixing the Adju-
tant with a watchful eye—“the
question is, what are you going
to regard as special circum-
stances 2 ”
“You state your circum-
stances to me officially to-mor-
row,” said the Adjutant cheer-
fully, “and I'll tell you quickly
enough whether they're special
or not.”
“I suppose,” suggested the
Stunt Pilot, “that a wedding
would be a pretty special sort of
circumstance, wouldn't it 7”
“That depends,” replied the
Adjutant. “Are you thinking of
getting married yourself?”
The Stunt Pilot said that he
hadn't been, but if there was any
A leave going with it he might think
of it.
“One's simply got to get leave
somehow,” he complained. “What

do?”
| “That's no good,” commented the
Junior Officer gloomily. “You’d have
to get leave for something else first
before you could manage it.”
“And if you did,” added the Adjutant
severely, “you'd get leave for rather
longer than you bargained for.”
“How about funerals?” put in the
Equipment Officer hopefully. “Fu-

they?”

“Land-lady.” “OH, well, YoU SEE, when HE was IN FRONT HE was ALways TURNING Round wroNg way ox, so I JUST PUT

I was in the Army there was a fellow
who used to come to the orderly-room
and talk funerals to me until I was
sick of the sight of him. After some
months of it I made him give me a
written list of all his surviving rela-
tions, and then as he killed them off I
used to scratch them out. I caught
him at last on his third grandmother.”
“That's all very nice,” said the
Stunt Pilot, “but the question at
present before the meeting is how are
we poor beggars to get any leave?”
“It’s no good blaming me,” returned
the Adjutant blandly. “Command
Orders are Command Orders.”
There was a brief silence, and then
the Stunt Pilot lifted up his voice and
spoke eloquently about the War Office
and Brass Hats generally. He said
that they had hearts of granite and
were strangers to all loving-kindness.
Their days were spent in idleness in
the Metropolis (so said the Stunt Pilot),
while he and his fellows drove rotten
'buses for hours together over the
beastliest district in Europe. Of an
evening the Carlton and the Piccadilly,
the Bing Boys and the Bing Girls, all
the delights of London were ready to
their hands, while poor devils like him-
self, shorn of leave, were condemned to
languish in a moth-eaten Mess in the
society of such people as the Adjutant.
Where was the sense in it, where the
justice, and when the deuce were they,
any of them, going to get a chance at
the bath-room 2
The Adjutant regarded him with
amused pity.
“The fact of it is,” he observed, “you
people have been absolutely spoilt over
leave. When I was in the Infantry we
used to consider three or four days in
six months quite handsome.”
The Stunt Pilot inquired sarcastically
whether he meant three or four days'
work or three or four days' leave.
“I don't mind saying,” pursued the
Adjutant, ignoring this sally, “at the
risk of making myself unpopular, that
personally I think it's a very good
thing that leave has been cut down.
My own opinion is that in the past
there's been a lot too much leave flying
about. Running up and down to
London on leave isn't going to help beat
the Germans. What we've got to do
if we want to win this War is to—”
At this moment the C.O. entered and
put down a hockey-stick in the corner.
“Thanks for the stick, Jervis,” he
said, and turned to go. “By the way,
shall I see you at the orderly-room to-
morrow before you go? What train
are you catching 2"
The Adjutant hesitated for the frac-
tion of a second.
“Well, Sir," he said, “I thought of
taking the 9.5.”
“I see,” said the C.O.
You won't be away longer than forty-
eight hours, I suppose 2"

EveRYTHING was just as

at the corner of the street. '.
It was the six o'clock car—
I noticed the usual evening

as usual.

as I sat down beside him. The elderly
relative—as I call her—was opposite
to me. She had her small attaché-case
and her knitting as usual, and she made
me feel at a glance that my face bored
her intolerably. For the rest, I saw
the fat paterfamilias, the wish-I-had-a-
motor lady, the Fº flapper and all the
crew who travel with dejected spirits
to and fro on our suburban line.
So far all was in order. Then the
conductress came round.
“Tuppenny,” I murmured. “Albe-

“What's your town 2" she asked,
taking a pencil from behind her ear.
“Town? It's Albemarle Road I want.”

“Macclesfield,” he said very de-

She rang the bell.
“Now,” she said, “the gentleman on

I rose and looked wildly down the
car. The flapper was beckoning slightly.
Her contemptuous boredom had van-
ished, and she looked a merry child
again. I rushed, stumbled, rocked into
her place; she sank with a gasp into

It was the paterfamilias who was up
now, and the elderly relative was sign-

was in his place gasping beside me.
For the first time in her life she spoke
to me. -
“What an escape!” she said. “There,
he's caught—York, I mean. I don't
know his proper name. It's odd, isn't
it, we know each other's faces so well
and yet we don't know each other's

won't it? I always called you Cicero

But now you're Pontaresina, of course.”
“Macclesfield to Pernambuco!”
“There!" laughed my companion.

how he's laughing. Do you know I
never thought any of the people in this
car could laugh, or even smile. I do
think this Society for the Abolition of

excellent thing, don't you?”
“Pontresina to St. Ives!”
Breathlessly we changed places; her
black hat was a little crooked, but she
only laughed.
“I’ve lost my knitting, too,” she said,
“but I don't mind. This exercise keeps
one so warm these cold days.”
The game was in wild progress; the
car rocked and jolted and the con-
ductress shouted the names.
“General Post !” she called. “Those
inside change places with those out-
side.” - -
That was the most breathlessly ex-

There was a solid struggling mass of
humanity on the tram staircase. Those

The lady called St. Ives was thump-

was the next. He had lost
his hat and his white hair

“I’m here,” he said.

against the rules. She
cast herself down beside
Macclesfield.
“Here I am, old dear,” she exclaimed.
“I left York simply jammed in the

asking me. She spoke very loudly.
“Pontresina — I’m Pontresina,” I
answered.
“This is Albemarle Road. If you're

insisted.
I rose in bewilderment.
St. Ives was looking at me while she
knitted. I raised my hat to her and
smiled. We had been such good friends

"TWAS FIFTY YEARS AGO.
(Lines suggested by an old Magazine.)
PUBLISHED the year I went to school—
The second of life's seven ages—
How fragrant of Victorian rule
Are these forgotten pages!
When meat and fruit were still un-
canned; - -
When good CHARLEs DICKENs still
was writing ;
And Sw1NBURNE's poetry was banned
As rather too exciting.
No murmurs of impending strife
Were heard, no dark suggestions
hinted; -
Our novelists still looked on life
Through spectacles rose-tinted;
And Paris, in those giddy years,
Still laughed at OFFENBAch and
SchNEIDER,
Blind to the doom of blood and
tears,
With none to warn or guide her.
The index and the authors' names,
Their stories and their lucubrations,
Recall old literary aims
And faded reputations;
We wonder at the influence
That SALA's florid periods had on
His fellows, and the vogue immense
Of versatile Miss BRADDoN.
And yet I read Aurora Floyd
In youth with rapture quite unholy—
Not in the way that I enjoyed
Mince-pies or roly-poly;
While “G. A. S." appeared to me
Like a Leonid fresh from starland,
Not the young lion that we see
Portrayed in Friendship's Garland.
And there are tinklings of the lute
In orthodox decorous fashion,
But altogether destitute
Of “elemental” passion;
And illustrations which refrain
From all that verges on the shady,
But glorify the whiskered swain,
The lachrymose young lady.
The sirens of the “sixties” showed
No inkling of our modern Circes,
And swells had not evolved the code
That guides our precious Percys;
Woman, in short, was grave or gay,
But not a problem or a riddle,
And maidens still were taught to play
The harp and not the fiddle.
And writers in the main eschewed
All topics tending to disquiet,
All efforts to reorganize
Our dogmas or our diet;
You could not carp at MENDELssohn
Without creating quite a scandal,
And rag-time on the gramophone
Had not supplanted HANDEL.
Blameless and wholesome in their way,
At times agreeably subacid,
I love these records of a day
Long dead, but calm and placid;
And with a sigh I now replace
This ancient volume of Belgravia
And turn the “latest news " to face

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE the feeling that when Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING called
his new volume A Diversity of Creatures (MACMILLAN) he
was rather taking the word out of my mouth, or the sword
out of my hand, or whatever one does for the confusion
and discomforting of critics. Because it is just the extreme
diversity of the tales herein which, while providing (as
they say) something for all tastes, makes it very hard to
appraise the book as a whole. In form it follows the
KIPLING convention, endeared to us by so much pleasure, of
sandwiching prose and verse, the poems echoing the idea of
the tale that has preceded them, and themselves likely to
prove for many the most attractive pages of the book. As
for the stories, here we get diversity indeed; and not of
theme alone. It is, of course, almost impossible for any-
thing signed by Mr. KIPLING to be wholly commonplace,
refugee couple, to whom she opens her home and heart.
A very pretty idea, developed with many dainty and amiable
touches. Perhaps (I set down no dogmatic verdict on the
point) the cynical or impatient may find its sweetness
something too drawn out. On the other hand, there are
many “gentle readers,” probably a vast majority, to whom
its appeal will prove entirely successful. And as they can
be trusted to spread its merits in the right quarters there
will be no need for the publishers to shout, either from the
house-top or anywhere else, which (as I suggested above)
is as it should be.
When we are introduced to Margaret Grenfield, the
heroine of Fetters on the Feet (ARNoLD), she is living with
some Quaker cousins and spending most of her time in
mending stockings. So many people make stockings who
refuse absolutely to mend them that I imagine there must
be something peculiarly unattractive in this work of restor-
but I am bound to
admit that there is at
least one of the collec-
tion (which, pardon me,
I do not mean to name)
that makes a notable
effort in that direction.
Also there are two of
which one can honestly
say that no other pen
could have written
them with anything
like such finished art—
The Village that Voted
the Earth was Flat,
which one might call a
fantasia upon Publi-
city, and (to my mind
the best thing in the
volume) My Son's Wife,
an exquisitely humor-
ous and cunning study
in the Influence of
Landed Estate upon a
Modern. If this defi-
nition strikes you as
obscure, read the story

Tlation, and it was a for-
tunate day for Margaret
when the pedan tic
young man of the house
proposed to marry her.
After this we discover
that she has both a
history and a will of
her own. She leaves
- the Quakers, and goes
as secretary to a lady
who holds eccentric if
broadminded views on
every conceivable sub-
ject, and the change

delightful in various
ways, was too much

for; so that the rival schools who admire Mr. KIPLING most
as the creator of Plain Tales, or Stalky or Puck, will each
receive encouragement and support; while, if there be those
who prefer the pot-boiler undisguisable, they too will not
find themselves altogether neglected.
I do wish our publishers would grasp the great truth
that praise of their own wares needs (to say the least of it)
most careful handling. What they, or some anonymous
admirer, say on the cover of The Worn Doorstep (HopDER
AND STOUGHTON) is that they should like to shout its merits
from the housetop. Possibly; but let me protest that it
is for me, and not for them, to do the shouting, if any;
which said, I will proceed to admit that the book is one of
considerable charm. It is told in the form of letters (never
to be posted, since they are from a young wife to her soldier-
husband, presumed to have been killed before the opening
of the book). Miss MARGARET SHERwood thus reverts to
a convention more popular some few years ago than with
our present-day romanticists. The matter of her tale shows
how the young wife in question found consolation in be-
friending others, especially in the love affairs of a Belgian
of a darning-needle. In the end Mrs. FRED REYNoLDs
tells us that “the day dawned. The whole earth sang and
sparkled in the glad light of it,” which is her way of saying
that Margaret had found happiness. But all the same I
fancy that introspection had become such a habit of this
heroine that she is still likely to have days when the dawn
is grey and no birds sing.

We doubt if there will be much response. Most middle-

STOMACH FOR THE FIGHT.
O Not because my taste for bread
Tended to make me much too stout,
And all the leading doctors said
I should be better far without ;
Not that my health may be more rude,
More svelte my rounded style of
beauty, -
I sacrifice this staple food––
But from a sense of duty!
I “can no other” when I think
Of how the Hun, docile and meek,
Suffers his ravenous maw to shrink, .
And only strikes, say, once a week;
If he for all these months has stood
The sorry fare they feed the brute on,
I hope that I can be as good
A patriot as your Teuton.
Henceforth I spurn the dear delight
That went so well with jam or cheese;
| No tum of mine shall wear the white
Flour of a shameless life of ease;
Others may pass one loaf in three,
Some rather more than that, and
some less, . . . .
But I–the only course forme—
Go absolutely crumbless.
So, when I quit this mortal strife,
Men on my grave these lines shall
SCOre :- -

He loved his country even more;
He needed no compelling ban;

And he surrendered, like a man,

DIPLOMATIC NOTES.
THE Latin-American situation re-
mains obscure. According to advices
from Archangel, Paraguay intends to
act, though curiously enough a strange
cloud of silence hangs over recent (and
coming) events in Ecuador. Bolivia
has decided to construct a fleet, despite
the fact that the absence of a seaboard
is being made a reason for sinister
opposition in pro - German circles.
Patagonia has mobilised both her sol-
diers, but her gun is still under repair.
Panagua has declared war on Ger-
many. It is hard to over-estimate the
value of this new adhesion to the Allied
cause. The standing army is well over
six hundred strong, and there is a
small but modern fleet, consisting of
| two revenue cutters, one super skiff,
eight canoes (mounted with two pairs
of six-inch oars) and one raft (Bena-
muckee class). The President, in a
moving address to the Panaguan Senate,
declared, “The world is watching
Panagua; it does not watch in vain.”
Señora Hysterica, the first woman
senator, cast the only vote against
war. “I cannot,” she sobbed.
Things are moving in Mexico. Gen-
eral CARRANZA has summoned a mass-
meeting of ex-Presidents to consider
the situation, and a counter-demon-
stration by the Brigands' Trade Union
Congress is feared. Even as far north
as Greenland the repercussion may be
felt. Here, owing to the new régime of
blubber-cards, Eskimo opinion is in a
very nervous state. Indeed, according
to an inspired semi-official utterance
by Prince Bowo, the Siamese Deputy
Vice-Consul at Fez, it is not too much
to say that almost anything may, or
may not, happen in this Arctic quarter.
The outlook in Palestine is dark.
Strict silence is enforced in all public
places, and even whispering is forbidden
at street corners. More than two-thirds
of the population are spies. Relatives
are only allowed to speak to each other
if granted a special licence or talking-
ticket by the Sheikh-ul-Islam, though
there is a special dispensation for
mothers-in-law. The reported mobil-
ization of eighty goats on Mount Tabor
shows pretty clearly which way the
wind is blowing; whilst it is persist-
ently rumoured in Joppa that five
camels were seen passing through Jeru-
salem yesterday. Suspicious dredging
operations in the Dead Sea are also
reported by a Berne correspondent.
The future is big with presage.
All eyes are fixed on the two great
African Powers which still stand aside
from the maelström of war. The
position in Ethiopia is, to say the least
of it, tendentious, and at any moment
the natives may change their skin.
The coronation of the new Empress of
Abyssinia is being followed as usual by
the great Feast of the Blue Umbrella,
at which an important pronouncement
is, I learn, to be made. I hear, more-
over (from a private source in Trond-
hjem, vid Mecca and Amsterdam), that
Wady-ul-Dzjinn, the new Premier, and
a staunch pro-Ally, is expected to speak
with no uncertain voice. Unfortu-
nately serious liquorice riots have
broken out in the capital, and these are
being cunningly used by German agents
to turn popular discontent against the
Allies. Fräulein von Schlimm, a niece
by marriage of the acting Montenegrin
Envoy, is accused of purposely hoard-
ing five hundred sticks of “Spanish "
so as to aggravate the crisis. The
usually reliable correspondent of The
Salt Lake City Morning Pioneer tele-
graphs (rid Tomsk) that she only
escaped lynching by distributing her
treasure to the mob.
In a similar way economic issues are
determining the attitude of Thibet.
Prices in Lhassa are rising fabulously.
Y| Regent's Park.
The new Food Controller is endeavour-
ing to grapple with the situation, and
the yak ration has again been reduced.
It behoves British diplomacy to see
that the ensuing discontent is not
turned into Germanophil currents.
Where is our Foreign Office? What
is being done? We are in the third
year of the War and yet, while the
German Minister is distributing free
arrowroot to the populace, Whitehall
slumbers on. It may be nothing to
our mandarins that a full platoon was
added to the Thibetan field-strength
only last week, and that the Govern-
ment dinghy is already watertight.
Later. Paraguay's attitude is now
defined as one of Stark Neutrality.
Patagonia has increased her army by
fifty per cent. The new recruit promises
to make an excellent fighting unit.

|N A GOOD CAUSE.
Mr. Punch begs to call attention to
a Great Lottery of Paintings, Drawings,
Sculptures, etc., by many of the chief
British artists of the day and of earlier
schools, which is being organised, by
licence of the Board of Trade, in aid of
the St. Dunstan's Hostels for Blinded
Soldiers and Sailors. These works of
art (including many by Mr. Punch's
artists) will be exhibited at the Bazaar
which is being held this week at the
Royal Albert Hall in aid of the same
splendid cause. After May 10th they
may be seen at the Chenil Galleries.
Tickets for the Lottery (5s.) are to be
obtained from Mr. Kineton Parkes,
The Chenil Galleries, 183A, King's
Road, Chelsea, S.W. The drawing of
the Lottery Prizes will take place on
July 10th at St. Dunstan's Hostel,
Mr. Punch also commends to his kind
readers the claims of “Lamp Day,"
which is to be celebrated in London on
Friday, May 11th, and in the suburbs
on May 12th, the birthday of FLORENCE
Nighting ALE. The proceeds are to be
divided between the Women's Service
Bureau, which registers and trains
women for national employment, and
the Scottish Women's Hospitals, whose
London units are doing gallant work
with the Serbian division of the Russian
Army in Roumania. Each of these is
a cause that would have appealed to
the heart of the “Lady of the Lamp,"
devoted pioneer of Women's Service
both at home and in the field. Those
who live outside the Metropolitan area
are begged to send a little money to the
Hon. Treasurer of Lamp Day, Lady
Cow DRAY, 16, Carlton House Terrace,
S.W. Cheques and Postal Orders to
be crossed “London County and West-
minster Bank, Victoria Branch.”

TOLD TO THE MARINES.
This is the yarn wot Sergeant Wells
O' 'Is Majesty's Marine
Told in the mess 'bout seven bells—
'E's the skipper's servant an’ knows a

An' I don't say it's true and I don't
say it's not,
But it easily might 'ave been.
“'Twas in the fust few months o' the
War,
An' the vessel wot I was on
Was layin' a couple of cables from
shore;
I'd pulled to the steps in the scullin'
boat
To get some thread for the skipper's
coat
Where the seam of the arm 'ad gone.
“I was driftin' back on the fallin' tide,
And feeling a trifle queer,
When somethin' grated agin the side;
I sat up straight and I scratched my
'ead;
‘There ain't no rocks round 'ere,' I said,
“It must 'ave bin all that beer.’
“When suddenly close on my starboard
beam,
With scarcely a foot between
(I can see it now like an 'ijjus dream),
Rearin' its 'ead like a pisonous snake
Was a periscope, an' I saw the wake
Of a big "Un submarine.
“An' I knew the ship wos an easy mark,

For the sky wos bright an' 'er 'ull wos

“I saw 'is cruel little eye
A-swivellin' stem to starn ;
‘Now, Wells,' I ses, ‘you must do or

So I crammed my cap a-top o' the slit
And lashed it fast in place with a bit,
Wot I'd pinched, of the bo'sun's yarn.
“'E wos blinded, of course, an' 'e sank

PoSTMORTEM PETE APPEARS BEFORE THE LONE GULCH TRIBUNAL TO PLEAD FOR EXEMPTION ON coxscre.NTious GRouxDs.
I
DOCKING THE DRAMA.
It has been reported that, in view of
the necessity for restricting the con-
sumption of artificial illuminant, the
authorities propose drastically to cur-
tail the duration of theatrical entertain-
ments. Should this prove to be the
case, we venture to anticipate certain
further regulations that may shortly be
added to those already printed upon
the programmes:—
(1) Every possible effort must be
made to reduce the two-and-a-half hours'
traffic of the stage to one hour-and-a-
half. With this purpose it is enacted
that—
(2) No reference to any supposed
events prior to the commencement of
the action will be permitted in the
dialogue. All such particulars as may
be essential to an understanding of the
plot must be legibly printed upon the
programmes.
(3) No performer to take more than
thirty-five seconds in quitting the stage.
Backward looks and doorway pauses for-
bidden (provided always that nothing
in this section shall apply to the case
of an actor-manager when surrendering
heroine to youthful rival).
(4) All applause, except at the fall
of the curtain, to be instantly sup-
pressed by ushers appointed for that
purpose.
(5) Friend-of-the-Family parts to be
restricted to one illustrative anecdote
and one advisory monologue, neither
to exceed three-and-a-half minutes in
delivery.
In addition, the Limelight Control
Committee furnishes us with the fol-
lowing scale of allowances and restric-
tions under a new clause of the Defence
of the Realm Act :— -
DRAMA.—The duration of the employ-
ment of limelight in Drama may be as
follows:—
During eviction of heroine into snow-
storm, allowance of one beam for a
reasonable period not to exceed one
minute.
For death of infant - phenomenon,
double-beam lasting two minutes; sup-
plementary allowance for angelic vision
subsequent to same. -
Embrace of hero and heroine at cur-
tain fall, double-beam, two-and-a-half
minutes.
FARCE AND CoMEDY.—It is regretted
that, in view of the situation, no allow-
ances of limelight can at present be
sanctioned.
MUSICAL PLAYS AND REvu Es. -
Patriotic or Hortatory Songs may be
accompanied by four beams, with sup-
plementary allowance for encore verses.
(N.B. In these cases application should
be supported by a recommendation
from the particular Government De-
partment, War Office. Admiralty, or
Ministry of Munitions, extolled in the
proposed ballad.)
Ethiopian Serenades, hitherto given
by the light of (apparently) two full-
moons, must be restricted to one beam,
of reduced candle-power, thus combin-
ing realism with economy.
The Mysteries of Arboriculture.
From an American Nursery Com-
pany's pamphlet —
“Practise thinning in the winter time and
head back in the summer. A tree can be kept
bearing practically regular crops. Of course,
it is impossible to keep any tree bearing prac-
tically regular crops, but, of course, it is im-
possible to keep any tree bearing a full crop
regularly. Wonders can be done by this
system of pruning.
We can well believe this.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS TO GROSVENOR HOUSE.
Mr. Punch is not more free from
correspondents who know how to solve
the food problem than other papers
al’e.
The following six letters have been
selected with care from some thousand
and three received during the week.
The others are at the service of any
enterprising editor, or Lord DEvoNPoRT
can have them if he will send a waggon
to take them away. They should make
pleasant week-end reading.
AN Excell, ENT SUGGESTION.
SIR,-What we plain men want to
know and what we are entitled to know
is—What does Lord DEvoNPoRT eat 2
What does Mr. KENNEDY-Jon Es eat 2
What does Mr. ALFRED BUTT eat? It
would make a vast difference to the
success of the food campaign if each of
these administrators was visible at his
meals, doing himself extremely ill. I
suggest that a prominent shop win-
dow should be taken for each, and they
should have their luncheon and dinner
there in full view of the public.
Yours, etc., CoMMON SENSE.
THE Power of BRITISH HUMOUR.
SIR,-If the Food Economy posters
were more carefully thought out the
trick would be done. I suggest, for
example, something really pithy and
witty, such as–
IT IS NOT ENOUGH
FOR
TWO DAYS
TO BE
MEATLESS DAYS.
YOU S iſ OU LD ser,
THAT ALL DAYS
ONE OR
AIRE
E.A.T.LESS DAYS.
Something like that would soon drive
the fear of England into the [unprint-
able word Germans.
Yours, etc., Dow NRIGHT.
To MASTER THE Rolls.
SIR,--My experience is that all rolls
are too big. I personally can get
through a meal comfortably with only
half the fat roll that is automatically
put before me at most of the restaur-
ants. Let Lord DEVONPORT decree a
roll just half the size, and the difference
both in consumption and waste will be
encrimous. At a dinner-party which I
attended the other evening, not, Sir,
a hundred miles from your own office,
the excessive size of the rolls was the
subject of much comment. No one
should be given the opportunity of
leaving any bread. It should be doled
out in the smallest doses.
Yours, etc., OBSERVER.
THE USE OF ABUSE.
SIR,--The real trouble with the food
economy campaign is that ordinary
people, who perhaps, not unnaturally,
have got into the habit of not believ-
ing the daily papers, do not realise
what their enemy and the chief enemy
of the country at this moment is—I
mean the German submarine. In order
to get this fact into their intelligence I
suggest that free classes in objurgation
are at once instituted, in which, instead
of the common “You beast ! ” “You
brute!” “You blighter!” and so forth,
the necessity of saying nothing but
“You (U) boat l” in every dispute or
quarrel is insisted upon. The young
might also be thus instructed.
Yours, etc., FAR SIGHTED.
WRIT SARCASTIC.
SIP,-I have an infallible plan for
diminishing the consumption of good
food, at any rate among Members of
the Government. Let them give up
all other forms of nutriment and eat
their own words. The PRIME MINISTER
might begin. I am, Yours, etc.,
- ORGANISED OPPosition.
“Food Hogs" supersFDED.
SIR,--I am told that there are people
so lost to shame that they are still, in
spite of the KING's Proclamation and
all the other appeals to their patriotism,
eating as usual. I suggest that they
be branded as the “Alimentary Can-
aille.” Yours, etc.,
DISGUSTED.
“Sir G. Cornewall Lewis made the best
speeches in the moist manner.”
British Weekly.
We had always understood till now that
he was one of our dry speakers.
“Mr. R. M'Neill was surprised that the hon.
member should have thought it worth while to
make a point of that sort. Surely he knew
the rule Qui facit peralium facit perse.’”
The Times.
The maxim seems to have jammed.
“Mr. Bonar Law replied : ‘The Imperial
War Cabinet is both executive and consulta-
tive, its functions being regulated by the nature
of the subject of the Bandman Opera Coy.’”
The Empire (Calcutta).
As one of the subjects of the Company
(according to its advertised programme)
is a piece entitled “The Rotters,” we
feel confident that Mr. BoSAR LAw
has been misreported.
TROOP HORSES.
THROUGH lingering long months idle
They have kept you ready and fit,
All shining from hock to bridle,
All burnished from hoof to bit;
The set of your silk coat's beauty,
The lie of its lightest hair,
Was an anxious trooper's duty
And a watchful captain's care.
Not the keenest eye could discover
The sign of the sloth on you,
From the last mane-lock laid over
To the last nail tight in the shoe;
A blast, and your ranks stood ready;
A shout, and your saddles filled;
A wave, and your troop was ready
To wheel where the leaders willed.
“Fine-drawn and fit to the buckle !”
Was your confident Colonel's pride,
And the faith of the lads—“Our luck 'll
Come back when the Spring winds
ride; ”
And, dropping their quaint oaths drolly,
They dragged their spurs in the mire,
Till the Western Front woke slowly
And they won to their hearts' desire.
They loose you now to the labours
That the needs of the hour reveal,
And you carry the proud old sabres
To cross with a tarnished steel;
So, steady—and keep position—
And stout be your hearts to-day,
As you shoulder the old tradition
And charge in the ancient way !
W. H. O.
MORE ZOO NOTES.
RAw sugar, Captain BATHURST states,
cannot be sold on account of the pre-
sence of the sugar louse. It is thought
that Mr. Pocock, who has so success-
fully brought the Zoo's rations into
conformity with war conditions, might
probably persuade the animal to live on
hemp seed.
“Changes in the Zoo's dietary,” says
Mr. Pocock, “were effected without
difficulty.” The rumour that the hip-
popotamus demanded a pailful of jam
with its mangel-wurzels, in the belief
that they were some kind of homoeo-
pathic pill, appears to have been
baseless. -
In order to assist the many fine speci-
mens of moth in the Insect House, it is
reported that several actor-managers
owning fur coats have offered them a
good home.
The birds of paradise are no longer
fed on beetroot. Since the all-red root
has been denied them they protest
against being called birds of paradise,
and wish to be known simply as
“birds.”

(With apologies to the seers of the
Sunday papers.)
A GREAT port was swathed in bunt-
ing last week. I was there, but I must
not say what caused this outburst of
enthusiasm. But even the Censor can
scarcely forbid my hinting that it
was connected with a naval success of
peculiar brilliance which must be sup-
pressed because we wish to keep the
Bosches guessing.
Who was in Switzerland when he
was regularly reported as being in
attendance at War Council meetings?
Who was actually supposed to have
addressed a public meeting in England
when in reality he was hundreds of
miles away ? I make no statement;
I merely write the word “Austria.”
To those who understand it will be
enough.
Have you noticed that for some weeks
we have had no news from the Port of
Danzig? I draw no deduction, but do
not be surprised to hear in a few weeks
that the Port of Danzig has ceased to
exist.
There is grave trouble at Scotland
Yard.
Arras was found to have in his pocket
a receipted bill from a London hotel
of the previous week's date. It would
surprise you very much if I told you
at which hotel “Mr. Perkins” stayed
and what guests he entertained there.
Why did the Liberian envoy call at
the Foreign Office six times last week?
His explanation, offered to an inquir-
ing Pressman, that he had lost an
umbrella, was naïve, to say the least.
I must not betray what I know, but I
may hint that KING FERDINAND of
Bulgaria is famous for the devious
ways in which he carries on negotia-
tions.
A neutral diplomatist of consider-
able importance has never taken a
holiday since the War began, and has
always told his friends that he will
never leave his post till peace comes.
On an afternoon this week he was seen
with beaming face buying a travelling
rug and two portable trunks at one of
London's largest emporia. I wonder
—yes, I wonder.

“As approved up to date, the bread ticket
will comprise four squares, each entitling the
holder to purchase two ounces of bread; or,
by presenting the whole ticket, two quartern
loaves of 41b, each.”—Birmingham Daily Mail.
Mr. Punch, though yielding in pat-
riotism to no one, has already decided
to present the whole ticket.
From a letter by “Retired Diplomat”
on “Maize Bread '':—
“To obtain this result the hard yellow husk
must be separated from the soft white core,
as does the parrot, and the latter alone re-
tained for baking purposes.”—Evening Paper.
As in these days no means of increas-
ing the supply of food-stuffs should be
neglected, we have much pleasure in
passing on “Retired Diplomat's" sug-
gestion to the authorities of the Zoo.
Personally we prefer Cockatoo en cas-
serole.

more important, admit the House to

of all the changes that such a revolu-

interest in the men of talk.

predecessor for its ability and lucidity.
Personally, I thought rapidity was its
most notable characteristic. Unham-
pered by manuscript (save a couple of
sheets of notepaper containing a few of
the principal figures) and relying upon
his exceptional memory, he rattled
through his thousand-million totals at
such a pace that my panting pencil
toiled after him in vain. In seventy-
five minutes by the clock he spoke four

last impost constitutes a real piece of
self-denial on the CHANCELLOR's part,
for he is much addicted to cigars both
long and strong, somewhat resembling
those which enabled Mr. W. J. TRAVIs
to carry off the Amateur Golf Cham-
pionship to America.
Thursday, May 3rd.—The secrets of
the Budget were so well kept that Mr.
LAw himself forgot the most important
of them until to-day. In future it will
be a case of “one man (or woman) one
dog,” unless the owner is prepared to
pay on an ascending scale for his extra
pets. In our fight with Germany we
must neglect no precaution however
small. To get the KAISER back to his
kennel we will, if necessary, empty our
own. Doggedness is essential to vic-
tory, but not over-doggedness. Then
let us, in CALVERLEY's phrase, “curtail
the already eur-tailed cur.”
A MINISTERIAL WAIL.
[“The most trenchant critics of the Gov-
ernment since its formation have been Mr.
PRINGLE and Mr. Hogg E.”—British Weekly].
THE gipsy camping in a dingle
I reckon as a lucky dog;
He doesn't hear the voice of PRINGLE,
He doesn't hear the snorts of Hogg|E.
The moujik crouching in his ingle
Somewhere near Tomsk or Taganrog
I envy; he is far from PRINGLE
And equally remote from Hogg E.
I find them deadly when they're single,
But deadlier in the duologue,
When the insufferable PRINGLE
Backs the intolerable Hogg E.
I'd rather walk for miles on shingle
Or flounder knee-deep in a bog
Than listen to a speech from PRINGLE
Or hearken to the howls of Hogge.
Their tyrannous exactions mingle
The vices of Kings Stork and Log;
One day I give the palm to PRINGLE,
The next I offer it to Hogg E.
The style of Mr. Alfred Jingle
Was jumpy, but he did not clog
His sense with woolly words, like
PRINGLE,
With priggish petulance, like Hogg|E.
I'd love to see the Bing Boys bingle,
To go to music-halls incog., -
Instead of being posed by PRINGLE
And heckled by the hateful Hogg E.
My appetite is gone; I “pingle”
(As Norfolk puts it) with my prog;
My meals are marred by thoughts of
PRINGLE, |
My sleep is massacred by HoggB.
O patriots, with your nerves a-tingle,
With all your righteous souls agog,

we were surprised by a hail from the

laughter, fell off his palfrey and bawled
for his batman, who ambled up balanc-

postpone his demise for at least half-
an-hour, requisitioned his physician (the
local witch doctor) and two camp
followers, and, leaving my cook-boy to
valet them, dashed to my hut to make
my own toilet. A glimpse through the
cane mats five minutes later showed
me that our visitors had arrived.
A fruity German officer in full gala
rig (white gloves and all) was cruising
about on mule-back before our camp,
trying to discover whether it was in-
habited or not. We let him cruise for
a quarter of an hour without taking
any steps to enlighten him. Then, at
a given signal, Frobisher, caparisoned
in every fal-lal he could collect, issued
from his hut, and I turned out the im-
provised guard. A stirring spectacle ;
and it had the desired effect, for the
German afterwards admitted to being
deeply impressed, especially by the
about four pounds in weight). Tongues
lolling, flanks heaving, we discussed the
hut tax, the melon crop, the monkey-nut
market, the nigger—and the weather
again.
Suddenly Frobisher sprang up, cast
loose the shackles of his Sam Browne,
hurled it into a corner, and began tear-
ing at his tunic hooks. I stared at him
in amazement—such manners before

leapt to his feet with a roar like a freed

flung them after the Sam Browne,
whereupon a fury of undressing came
upon us. Helmets, belts, tunics, shirts

length we stood in our underclothes,
laughing and unashamed. After that
we got on famously, that Teuton and

signal for general good-will.
In the fulness of time Otto went
home on leave, and, shortly afterwards,
the world blew up.
And now I have met him again, a
sodden, muddy, bloody, shrunken, sad-
dened Otto, limping through a snow-
storm in the custody of a Canadian
Corporal. He was the survivor of a
rear-guard, the Canuck explained, and
had “scrapped like a bag of wild-cats”
until knocked out by a rifle butt. As
for Otto himself, he hadn't much to

finitely disgusted. He had always been

Second-Lieutenant Humphrey Spence
Had no idea of precedence;
To him his Colonel was no more
Than any other messroom bore :
And he would try to make a pal
Not merely of a General,
But even a horrified non-com
He'd greet with “Tiddly-om-pom-
pom' "
Although in other ways quite nice,
He was perverted by this vice.
For instance, once he had to tea
A private in the A.S.C.,
And asked to meet him Cathcart-Crewe.
A Major in the Horse Guards Blue.
Too frequently did it occur
That, when a senior officer
Was with him, he would up and take
Salutes from privates. Why, he'd shake
Even Sir Doug LAs by the hand
And say, “Old chap, you're doing grand.”
This sort of thing caused some distress
Among the members of his mess.
He often took the Colonel's chair;
He often flourished in the air
His water-glass (when wine was scanty),
And shouted, “ Cheero, Adjutanty 1"
You see, he simply had no sense
Of military precedence.
His regiment went out to France
To help a general advance.
Now in a minute they must hop
Like billy-o across the top.
Amid the din the Colonel said,
“It will be hellish overhead.
Machine-guns will let loose a jet
Of bullets on the parapet;
We'll meet a burst of rifle fire,
And, as for shells, I don't desire
To see in so confined a space
A thicker lot than we shall face.
Now, gentlemen, attend, I pray—
When we attack, I lead the way!”

SCHOOL.
DURING the past week there has taken place, almost
without our knowledge, a great migration of boys. From
their homes, out on to the roads and railways, has been
pouring a flood of big boys, middle sized boys, small boys,
old boys, new boys, all tending towards the various schools
where they are supposed to make all the best parts of
| human knowledge their own and to live a life of dignified
abstraction from the troubles of the world, in the midst of
their own argot and their own special traditions.
Of the big boys and the middle-sized boys I have little
to say. They are already imbued, if one may say so, with
the influence of their school, and can hold their own with
the masters and their fellow-boys. Much as they enjoy
their holidays, they show no undue reluctance to take up
again the burden of their studies at a place which they will
afterwards consider as having given them some of the hap-
piest days of their lives. Many of them indeed are already
or are in process of becoming the trusted coadjutors of the
headmaster and his colleagues in the work of maintaining
good order and discipline T.
in the school. They are
monitors—tremendous
word!—or prefects or prae-
postors, and their mitis
sapientia, no less than
their muscular strength,
causes them to be feared
and venerated.
Of such awful beings
one must not speak
lightly lest some terrific
fate reserved for scoffers
overtake one. No, my
concern at present is
rather with the little boys
who have gone up for the
first time to their pre-
paratory school, those
forlorn scraps of hu-
manity who are begin-

“You need not,” he said, “worry about that. Softness

When therefore, on a day in last week, it happened to
me to take a little boy I happen to know to his Preparatory
School on his first day of his first term there, I did so with
no undue depression. “Be a good boy,” I said to him;
“never tell a lie, never push yourself forward, and don't
swank about yourself.” It was good advice so far as it
went, but it did not make any great impression on him, for
he only answered, “Of course,” or “Of course I shan't,”
to every item that I put before him. I wonder how many
fathers have recently inculcated these and similar high-toned
principles on their little boys, only to meet with the same
uninterested acquiescence. And even our parting was not

ning a life entirely new to them in all its details. Hitherto,
except for visits to the seaside with their parents and family,
they have not spent a night away from home. Now they are
separated from their parents and plunged into a world of
perfect strangers. Everything is done to make them at ease
and comfortable in their new surroundings; the headmaster
is kindness itself, the matron beams on them with smiles
and fortifies them with encouragement; but just at first
the wrench for the little fellows is great. In a day or two,
however, they will begin to acclimatise themselves; the
strangeness will begin to wear off; and having borne up
bravely against their first sense of loneliness in the midst
of a crowd they will gradually become parts of the machine
to the making of which many gentle and sympathising hands
for years past have contributed. . . . .
“Schools are not what they were,” says one of my
friends, “There is no bullying nowadays and little rough-
ness of any kind. Masters are not looked upon as the
natural enemies of boys. Corporal punishment, except for
the gravest offences, is abolished. Whereas, formerly,
little boys were at once sucked into the vortex of a
Public School, there are now Preparatory Schools, where

learn the business of Public Schooling in a manner suited
to their age and capacity. When we were boys,” he con-
tinues, “these admirable buffer states were so few that
“Men are big, not ugly. They don't eat worms."
“But they cut them in two with spades.”
“Only by accident. There is nothing so ugly as a
bloated over-grown bird eating a slender delicate worm.”

“There was no need. You see it is a matter of con-

their beaks slimy.” -
“Convenience is a great thing,” said the worm, “but it
isn't everything. Well, good-bye; I am going in till the
bird goes.” - -
“And I am staying out till the man comes.”
“Slugs are nasty slimy things,” said the thrush, “but in
these hard times one must eat what one can get,” and he
swallowed the slug with a wry face.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I was some way into Thorgills of Treadholt (WARD, Lock),
thinking what an unusually plausible and imaginative yarn
it was, when I turned back for possible enlightenment,
and found a note to the effect that it was a transcrip-
tion of an Icelandic saga. Those old fellows knew their
business. I am not sagacious enough to guess where
Mr. MAURICE HEwlETT has passed beyond transcription
to creation, but I can tell you that he offers his readers a
very charming and finished piece of work. Boys of all
ages should delight in this record of the fights and wander-
ings and stout diplomacy of the chieftain Thorgills, who
was destined from his cradle to be a notable leader of men.
His marriage with Thorey was a romance of as exquisite a
flavour as any that our sophisticated age can show, and its
tragic end wrings the heart with its infinite pathos. By
some singular discretion Mr. HEWLETT has chosen to
eschew the least approach to Wardour-Street idiom, and
this gives the narrative a simplicity, a sanity and a vivid
sense of reality which are extraordinarily more effective
than the goodliest tushery, of which flamboyant art Mr.
HEwleTT is no mean master. I am sure he has chosen
this time a more excellent way. There are transcriptions
and transcriptions. This is brilliantly done.
I cannot help regretting that Miss Rhoda BROUGHToN

without disrespect I may employ a metaphor of the moment)
on the title-page of her latest volume. Certainly the tale of
her output must by this time reach impressive dimensions.
And the wonder is that A Thorn in the Flesh (STANLEY
PAUL) betrays absolutely no evidence of staleness. If the
outlook here is a thought less romantic than in certain
novels that drew sighs from my adolescent breast, this is a
change inherent in the theme. For the matter of the
present work is a study in conjugal tedium. Parthenope
(name of ill-omen) was one of those unhappy and devas-
tating beings who go through life fated to bore their nearest
and dearest to the verge of lunacy. So that her marriage
to poor well-meaning Willy Steele had not endured for more
than a matter of weeks before the wretched man fled from
his newly-made nest, with the heart cry (uttered to Parthe-
mope's female relatives, themselves too sympathetic to resent
it), “I cannot stand her any longer ' ". This unfortunate
débâcle is very ingeniously contrasted with the courtship of
another couple, immune from the curse; and the whole
story is as fresh as it is amusing. Perhaps it might have
been told in fewer words; at times the slender theme seems
a trifle overladen. But probably your true Broughtonians
(who must be reckoned in thousands) would condemn such
a suggestion as heresy; and, if they be satisfied, as they
certainly will be, then all is well.
It is a tribute at once to the art of her treatment and the
actuality of her theme that, after reading the delicate little
study of modern romance that ELIZABETH Robins PENNELL
has not thought fit to publish her total fictional tonnage (if

calls The Lovers (HEINEMANN), I cannot determine whether
the clever writer was reproducing or inventing—she begins
so convincingly with the statement that it was her first
chapter, itself an article in The Century, describing the life
of The Lovers as she watched it from her window, that
brought about her friendship with the originals, and thus
her knowledge of their further history. Anyhow, true or
not, it is the kind of story that has been going on all round
us in these days of love and heroism. Mrs. PENNELL first
began to watch her pair of amoureur in their attic, which
was overlooked from her higher window (most readers
could probably make a shrewd guess at its postal district)
in those seemingly so distant years when the young cham-
pions of artistic London used to meet at a certain café,
wonderfully clad, to consume vast quantities of milk.
Then came the War; the boy-husband enlisted, went to
the Front—and the end is as we -

so that she went with her head bound for a year there-

[May 16, 1917.
self I have just written the following At the end of a week we had given
HEREINAFTERS. letter:— Mr. Perkins a cottage of which any
I.
THERE are people in the world called
tenants. I think nothing of them ;
Celia thinks nothing of them; jointly
we do not think anything of them.
However, as this is not so much a
grammar as an explanation, I will get
on with it. ..
For the last two years we have been
letting our flat. Naturally Celia has
had to do most of the work; my mili-
tary duties have prevented me from
taking my share of it. I have been so
busy, off and on, inspecting my fellow-
soldiers' feet, seeing their boots mended
and imploring them to get their hair
cut that I have had no time for purely
domestic matters. Celia has let the
flat; I have merely allotted the praise
or blame afterwards. I have also, of
course, taken the money.
Our tenants have varied, but they
are all alike in this. They think much
more of their own comfort as tenants
than of our happiness as landlords.
They are always wanting things done
for them. When they want things
done for them, then I am firm. Celia
may be a shade the more businesslike
of the two, but I am the firmer. I am
adamant.
Take the case of Mr. Toots. As the
wife of an officer proceeding overseas,
Celia let the flat to Mr. Toots at the
nominal rental of practically nothing a
week. I said it was too little when I
heard of it, but it was then too late—
Celia had already been referred to here.
inafter as the landlord. When he had
been established some weeks Mr. Toots
wrote to say that he wanted seven differ.
ent kinds of wine-glasses, six of each.
Personally I wanted seven different
kinds of Keating's Powder just then :
tastes differ. The trouble with Mr.
Toots was that for some reason he
expected Celia to supply the glasses.
Whether he only wanted them during
his tenancy or meant to keep them
afterwards, we never knew. In any
case Celia was businesslike; she wrote
regretting that she could not supply
them.
But I was firm. I sent a picture-
postcard of the champagne country,
which said quite simply, “You must
not drink wine during the War. My
husband's milk-glass is in the corner
cupboard.”
Again, take the case of Mr. and Mrs.
Winkle. After getting the flat practically
presented to them for a small weekly
bonus, they suggest that they should
only pay half terms during the summer,
as they wish to take the children to the
seaside. Celia was for telegraphing to
say that it was impossible. For my-
“DEAR SIR,-Could I consult my
own feelings I would say, ‘Pay no rent
at all during the summer. Further,
why not sub-let the flat to any of your
own friends who can afford to give you
a few guineas a week for it 2 Nay
more, let me have the privilege of paying
your expenses at the Sunny South.
What do you say to the Métropole at
Brighton 2' But, alas, I cannot speak
thus; there are others to think of. The
King of GREECE, President WILSON,
Marshal JoFFRE—I need say no more.
You understand. Things will have to
go on as they are, except that the rent
will probably be doubled about July.
Yours admiringly.”
This letter is now waiting to go off.
Celia says it is waiting for a stamp.
Personally I don't see the necessity for
a stamp.
II.
There are people in the world called
owners. I think nothing of them; Celia
thinks nothing of them; jointly we do
not think anything of them. However,
as I said before, this is not a grammar.
For the last two years we have been
renting cottages. Naturally Celia has
had to do most of the work; the cut
and thrust of a soldier's life has pre-
vented me from taking my share of it.
I have been so busy, off and on, seeing
that my fellow-soldiers have baths,
getting them shaved and entreating
them to send their socks to the wash
that I have had no time for domestic
trifles. Celia has taken the cottage; I
have merely allotted the praise or blame
afterwards. I have also, of course, paid
the money.
Our landlords have varied, but they
are all alike in this. They think much
more of their own comfort as landlords
than of our happiness as tenants. They
are always wanting things done for
them. When they want things done
for them, then I am firm. Indeed I
am granite.
Take the case of Mr. Perkins, who
owns our present cottage. Celia bor-
rowed the cottage from Mr. Perkins at
a rental of several thousands a week.
I said it was too much when I heard
of it, but it was then too late—she had
already been referred to hereinafter as
the tenant. As soon as we got in
we began to make it look more like a
cottage; that is to say, we accidentally
dropped the aspidistra out of the
window, lost the chiffonier, removed
most of the obstacles and entangle-
ments from the drawing-room to the
box-room, and replaced the lace cur-
tains with chintzes. In the same spirit
of altruism we improved the bedrooms.
man might be proud.
But there is no pleasing some people.
A closer examination of the lease, in
the hope that we had over-counted the
noughts in the rental, revealed to us
the following:—
“At the expiration of the said ten-
ancy, all furniture and effects will be
delivered up by the tenant in the same
rooms and positions in which they
were found.”
Not a word of thanks, you notice,
for the new avenues of beauty which
we had opened out for him; no grati-
tude for the great revelation that art
was not bounded by aspidistras nor
comfort by chiffoniers; nothing but
that old reactionary spirit to which,
if I may speak of lesser things, the
Russian Revolution was due. Like
Mr. Perkins, the Bourbons learned
nothing and forgot nothing.
Naturally I wrote to Mr. Perkins:—
“DEAR SIR,--I regret to inform you
that the aspidistra has perished. It
never took kindly to us and started
wilting on the second day. As regards
other objets d'art once in the drawing-
room, but now seeking the seclusion of
the box-room, we are in a little diffi-
culty. Before letting it go my wife
took the bearing of the marble how-
now from the bamboo what not and
made it 28° 20', quite forgetting, un-
fortunately, that the what-not had also
decided to lie fallow for a season. Con-
sequently, while the direction of the
what-not-how-now line is definitely
fixed, their actual positions remain un-
established. Is it too much to hope
that when the time comes for them to
seek again the purer air of the drawing-
room they will be able to rely upon
the guidance of an old friend like
yourself rather than upon that of two
comparative strangers?
Yours anxiously.”
III.
Sometimes I wonder what Mr. T'er-
kins would say if I suggested paying
half-rent during the winter. -
Sometimes Celia wonders what she
will say if she finds that Mrs. Winkle
has re-arranged all her furniture for
her.
“We might,” said Celia, looking at
the two letters, “send the Perkins one
to Mrs. Winkle and the Winkle one to
Mr. Perkins.”
“Why?" I asked.
“Just to show how broad-minded
we are,” said Celia. A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON THE SPY-TRAIL.
Jimmy says he thought there must
be something the matter with Jones
minimus, he was so gloomy.
He actually told Jimmy that he
wished he was in heaven. Jimmy had
to tell him not to say such wicked
things, because sometimes when you
wished things like that they came true,
and then where would Jones minimus
be 2
Jimmy says it takes a lot to make
Jones minimus gloomy, but it turned
ink. The chimney-sweep told Jimmy
that he was travelling the country
sweeping chimneys; but Jimmy said
that they had already had theirs swept,
because a cat got in their dining-room
and Jimmy had put in his bloodhound
to tell it to go out.
Jimmy says they looked everywhere
for the algebra book, but couldn't find
it, and they were just giving up in des-
pair when they heard Jimmy's blood-
hound wrestling with something in his
kennel, and there it was.
Old Faithful had worked half-way
far corner of his kennel and nurse his
wrath.
Jimmy says that bloodhounds have
been known to kill a pig in a very short
time; but the pig didn't seem to know
this, when Jones minimus and Jimmy
took hold of the kennel and shook out
Faithful at him. Jimmy says the pig
just turned on its heel and walked
round the garden sampling things and
inquiring into them.
Jimmy says that Faithful is a good
sampler too, and when the pig saw him
they tried to sample each other. Faith-
out that he had lost the War Loan ; through the algebra and was busy ful thought he was chasing the pig,
he had either lost or mislaid it, he told solving simultaneous equations whilst and the pig thought he was chasing

Jimmy says his bloodhound looked
Jimmy. |
It was on a card, and Jones minimus
only wanted another shilling
to make 15s. 6d., and then in
five years they gave you º
pound, and it was because of
the compound interest someone
invented.
Jimmy says as they were
talking the milkman came up
and asked if they had seen his
pig. The milkman is always
losing his pig. Jimmy says it
wanders off for a walk nearly
every day talking to itself and
going into gardens and relishing
things. It is a very good relisher,
Jimmy says.
Jimmy says the milkman's pig
is being talked about in home
circles; but it doesn't seem to
mind, it just goes on its way.
You can always tell the milk-
man's pig by the black spot on
its back.
Jimmy says he knows a man
who is going to shoot the pig
at sight next time.
Jimmy was just telling the
milkman that he ought to put "
butter on its feet to make it stay at
home, when Jones minimus suddenly
remembered. He had put the War
Loan in his algebra book and left it
in Jimmy's garden. Jimmy says it was
a good thing they went back when they
did, because when he got home he found
his bloodhound, Faithful, busy suspect-
ing a chimney-sweep of being a spy;
he had done it to the chimney-sweep's
trousers, Jimmy says.
Jimmy says the chimney-sweep was
doing bayonet exercises with his brush
at Faithful and working his black face
at him.
Jimmy says the chimney-sweep had
evidently never seen a prize blood-
hound before, because when Jimmy
came up he stood on guard, and in a
frightened whisper said to him, “What
is it 2 ''
Jimmy says the beads of perspiration
stood on the chimney-sweep's face like

so disappointed when they took the
algebra book from him that Jones
minimus gave it him back again, as
he said it was no good to him, and
perhaps Faithful would find out how to
catch another German spy, or else how
to make up the War Loan to 15s. 6d.
Jimmy says his bloodhound did enjoy
the algebra, and the way he tackled
several pages of harder problems made
old Jones minimus's mouth water.
Jimmy says Faithful had finished
the problems and was just beginning to
chew some quadratics when he looked
up and there was the milkman's pig
calmly standing in the garden next
door, looking at him through the hedge
and actually munching a piece of coal
at him.
Jimmy says it made his bloodhound
chew algebra like anything, and when
the pig began flapping his ears at him
old Faithful had to go right into the
|ºl. and they did it in a ring on
the lawn.
Jimmy says he could see they
were both working themselves
up, because the pig went up to a
standard rose-tree and scratched
his back at Jimmy's bloodhound,
whilst Faithful kept smelling
the ground like anything.
Jimmy says the pig is a sacred
animal to the natives of some
places, but it wasn't to the man
who owned the garden; he came
out and accused it of being there.
Jimmy told him that if you
placed a pig in the middle of
a lake it always cut its throat
when it tried to swim out. But
the man hadn't got a lake, he
had only got an ornamental
fountain, and the pig had al-
ready scratched that over with
its back. The pig seemed very
uneasy about its back, Jimmy
says.
Jimmy says the man offered
Jones minimus a shilling if he
would remove the pig and that
piebald anteater from the garden
in five minutes.
Jimmy says Jones minimus is a
very good pig-remover, and he thinks
it must be a gift with him. Jimmy.
says the pig was very much surprised
at Jones minimus, and it wanted to go
home and get to bed.
Jimmy says the pig trod on Faithful's
toe as they both squeezed through the
gate together, and Faithful pulled the
pig's ear, and then they both went
down the road, Faithful leading by
about a yard, and looking behind him
with both eyes to make sure the pig
was following him. Jimmy says his
bloodhound was working beautifully,
and when the pig stopped to smell one
end of a cabbage-stalk which was lying
in the gutter old Faithful, with his
nose to the ground, his ears hanging
slightly forward, and his eyes looking
upwards, crept slowly back and deliber-
ately smelt at the other end. It was
grand, Jimmy says. There they stood

Jimmy says that he and Jones mini-

man was so excited ; he kept rushing
about, talking about things and aiming
his gun at the pig, and the pig kept
running round and round and getting
mixed up with Faithful. Then just as

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TWO CONSTABLES.
It happened one evening when my
wiſe was staying away with her mother,
in the dark months of last winter, when
we were without servants, and I was
glad to have received an invitation
from my neighbour Jones to dinner.
He and his wife welcomed me warmly,
and their rather unintelligent maid had
just brought in the saddle of mutton—
a great weakness of mine—when we
heard a firm knock on the hall door.
She returned to say that someone
wanted to speak to Mr. Brown imme-
diately. “Who is it?” I demanded.
“I don't know, Sir," said the girl, “but
he looks like a policeman.”
“I hope nothing has happened to
your wife,” said Mrs. J. anxiously.
“Or her mother," added Jones rather
cynically.
The man at the door was certainly a
policeman, and an elderly one, and had
probably been recalled from pension
when the War broke out.
“Good evening, Sir," he said, staring
hard at me. “Are you Mr. Brown "-
I nodded—“of Myrtle Villa, next door.”
—he eyed me suspiciously—“No. 17 ?”
“Yes, yes,” I said impatiently;
“what of it 2 ''
“I must ask you for your name and
address, Sir," pulling out his note-book,
“for showing a strong light at the back
of the 'ouse at 8 P.M."
“That's all nonsense,” I answered
impatiently; “the house is empty.”
“Excuse me, Sir, I saw it myself
from the road at the back and came
straight round,” said he with his note-
book ready.
“But it can't be,” I said, getting
annoyed.
At this moment a Special came
running down the path. “They're
coming,” he panted.
“Who are 2 " I asked.
been invited but myself.”
“The engines.” -
“No one's
“But I haven't ordered any,” said I.
“I gave the alarm myself," he added
proudly.
Jones's rather unintelligent maid had
been standing by my side the whole
time. “FXcuse me, Sir," she said,
“I don't know, but I think there's
something wrong with your 'ouse—the
little room at the back, where you sit
and smoke of an evenin'. There's been
a big light there for some time—a
wobbly one. I don't know, Sir, but I
think the 'ouse is a-fire.”
“What ” I yelled, and dashed aside
the two varieties of constabulary. Yes,
it was all true. The strong light at
the back of the house—a wobbly one—
was rapidly becoming a glow in the
heavens, as they say in journalese. I
stood and looked at it, staggered for
the moment, when I heard a cheer and
saw the engines coming. I dashed for
my front-door, but found myself forci-
bly dragged back. It was the Special,
who seemed to be having the time of
his life.
“No one allowed to enter a burning
building," said he importantly.
“But I must,” I cried ; “there are
some valuable papers
“No one allowed to enter,” he re-
peated firmly — he seemed to have
learned it by heart—“except the fire-
men and police."
I'll—'
“Pass along, please,” he said quite
suddenly, as a new phase of his duties
seemed to occur to him, and I found
myself edged back towards the crowd.
Now I had to have those papers, and
an idea occurred to me, so I stopped.
“I say, how about your dinner? You'll
miss it altogether. I don't want to
keep you. Perhaps if you hurry off at

ping me fiercely by the arm—“what is

never had a case yet, and now that
I've got a real fire—and this is my
own fire, mind you, my very own—”
“I thought it was mine,” I ventured.
“You talk to me of dinner | Pass
right along, please;" and I found my-
self back among the crowd, who seemed
to be thoroughly enjoying it.
There was a small cheer just then
as the flames came through the roof.
Of Jones and his wife I saw nothing,
but supposed they must have stayed
on to enjoy their saddle of mutton,
and wondered if they had kept mine
hot for me. I could have kept it hot
in my own house, I reflected rather
miserably.

The fire had been extinguished. As
the crowd dispersed I felt a touch on
my shoulder. It was the elderly con-

inquired patiently. “I haven't had

by Mr. DILLON on the Salonika Expedi-
tion; and they will not understand that
the one is dominated by the belief that
no Board of Admiralty that does not
include Lord FishFR can possibly be
efficient; and that the other is con-
genitally unable to believe anything
good of British administration in Ire-
land or elsewhere. -
For once Mr. BoxAR LAw took the
gloves off to Mr. DILLON, and told him
plainly that more attention would be
paid to his criticism if he was himself
doing something to help in the prose-
cution of the War.
Thursday, May 10th.-I gather from
Mr. SPEAKER's report of the Secret
Session that nothing sensational was
revealed. The PRIME MINISTER’s “en-
couraging account of the methods
adopted to meet the submarine at-
tack" was not much more explicit, I
infer, than the speech which Lord
CURzoN was making simultaneously,
turbi et orbi, in the House of Lords, or
Mr. Asquith would not have observed
—again I quote the official report—
that “hardly anything had been said
which could not have been said openly.”
That none of the Nationalists should
have addressed the House was perhaps
less due to their constitutional reticence
than to the depressing effect of the
South Longford election, where their
nominee was defeated by the Sinn Fein
candidate—one McGUINNEss, and evi-
dently a stout fellow. But it is odd to
find that the debate was conducted
without the assistance of Messrs. BILL-
ING, PRINGLE and Hogg E. Their elo-
quent silence was a protest, no doubt,
against the eviction of the reporters.
Mr. CHURCHILL was probably suffering
equal anguish, but with patriotic self-
sacrifice he refused to deprive his fellow-
legislators of the privilege of hearing
once again his views on the conduct of
War. -

[The Daily Chronicle, writing on women
farmers, quotes the tribute of HUTTON, the
historian, to a Derbyshire lady who died at
Matlock in 1854: “She undertakes any kind
of manual labour, as holding the plough,
driving the team, thatchinº the barn, using
the flail; but her chief avocation is breaking
horses at a guinea per week. She is fond of
Pope and Shakespeare, is a self-taught and
capable instrumentalist, and supports the bass
viol in Matlock Church.”]
Though in the good old-fashioned days
The feminine factotum rarely
Was honoured with a crown of bays
When she had won it fairly;
She did emerge at times like one
For manual work a perfect glutton,

Who cheerfully resigns the quest
Of all that makes a woman charm-

And shows an even greater zest
For gardening and farming.
She used to petrify her dons;
She was a most efficient bowler;
But now she's baking barley scones

Good Mrs. Beeton she devours,
And not the dialogues of PLAto,
And sets above the Cult of Flowers
The Cult of the Potato.
The studious maid whose classic brow
Was high with conscious pride of
learning -
Now grooms the pony, milks the cow,
And takes a hand at churning;
And one I know, whose music had
Done credit to her educators,
Has sold her well-beloved “Strad"
To purchase incubators'
The object of this humble lay
Is not to minimize the glory
Of women of an earlier day
Whose deeds are shrined in story;
'Tis only to extol the grit
Of clever girls—and none work
harder—
Who daily do their toilsome “bit"
To stock the nation's larder.

now getting on in years), and constant
preoccupation with kitchen affairs has
somewhat narrowed her outlook, so
that the circumvention of the butcher,
whose dominant idea (she believes) is
to provide her with indifferent joints,
is more to her than the defeat of
HINDENBURG; and so far as she is con-
cerned the main theatre of the War
is neither Europe nor the Atlantic, but
the coal merchant's yard, which dis-
gorges its treasure so grudgingly. Not
only is her first thought for her cook-
ing, in order—the transition to her
second thought is automatic—that her
employer or employers may be comfort-
able; but it is her last thought too.
With such singleness of purpose to
crystallize her, she cannot absorb even
the gravest of warnings; not from un-
willingness or stupidobstinacy, but from
sheer inability to grasp any novelty.

—either or both—should not have the
best of everything and plenty of it is,
at this advanced stage in her career,
unthinkable.

whom she heard of the War and whom
she thinks (for his class) a sagacious
Press. Anyway she has refused—and
will, I fancy, never relent—to allow any
extreme idea of food shortage to disturb
her routine.
“Look here, Mrs. Legion,” you say,
“really, you know"—you don't like, or
you have lost the power, to be too firm
with her after all these years of friend-
any more.”
“Not toast !”
“No, not any more. In fact"—a
light laugh here—“I’m going to do
without bread altogether directly.”
“Do without bread ' " This with
much more alarmed surprise than if
you had declared your intention of for-
swearing clothes.
Even though she read it
many voices, dulcet or commanding,
I imagine that the milkman, from
fellow, has warned her against the
liness—“really we mustn't have toast
“Yes; the Government want us to
eat less bread. In fact we must, you
know; and toast is particularly waste-
ful, they say.”
“There's no waste in this house, Sir
for 'M).” This with a touch of acerbity,
for Mrs. Legion is not without pride.
“No one can ever accuse me of waste.
I'm not vain, but that I will say.”
“No, no,” you hasten to reply, “of
course not; but things have reached
such a point, you know, that even the
strictest economy and care have got to
be made more strict. That's all. And
toast has to be stopped, I'm afraid.”
“Very well, Sir [or "M), if you wish
it. But I can't say that I understand
what it all means.”
And that evening, which is meatless
and is given up largely to asparagus
(just beginning, thank God!), you cer-
tainly see no toast in the rack, but find
that the tender green faggot reposes on
a slab of it large enough to feed several
children.
Mrs. Legion may go to church, but
her real religion is concerned far more
with her employers' bodies than with
her own soul; and among the cardinal
|tenets of her faith is the necessity for
dinner to be hot. You may have a

tion ? How to bring the old Tory into

“And, Mrs. Legion,” you say, not
too boldly, and at the end of some
other remark, “we’ll have yesterday's
leg of mutton for dinner to-night, with
a salad."
“Cold mutton for dinner 2 " she re-
plies dully. -
“Yes—now the weather's getting
warmer it's much nicer. It will save
coal too. Just the mutton and a salad.
No potatoes.”
“No potatoes!” Surely the skies are
falling, says her accent. You have been
eating mashed potatoes, done with
cream and a dash of beetroot in it,
with cold meat, at lunch, for years.
“No, no—we mustn't eat potatoes
any more. Haven't you heard?”
“I heard something about it, yes.
But aren't we to eat those we've got?”
“No, we must give them away.
Remember, just cold mutton and salad.'
And no toast.” You are getting more
confidence. “Never toast any more ”
—another light laugh—“never any
more " ''

your horror you are asked first to eat

“Well, Sir for 'M), the fishmonger
called, and as I felt sure the cold meat
couldn't be enough for you . . .”
Summoning all your courage you pro-
test again, adding, “And another thing,
Mrs. Legion : you mustn't make any
more pastry. The flour can't be spared.
It's not only bread we've got to be
careful about, but everything made with
flour.”
“Then what's the flour for 2 ''
“That's all right. But it's got to be

“I don't understand, Sir [or "M). I
can't see why it shouldn't be used if we
have it.”
“No. The idea is that every one
should go without flour as much as
possible, and then there will be more
people.” -
“My duty is to this house, Sir for
'M]. But the flour's so coarse and
I never saw such stuff. It's a scandal.
But I'm truly sorry if I've disappointed
you. All I want to do is my duty.”

AT THE PLAY.
“WANTED A HUSBAND.”
YoU will easily guess that a comedy
(or farce) in which a woman is reduced
to advertising in the Press for a hus-
band belongs to the ante-bellum era,
before the glad eye of the flapper be-
came a permanent feature of the land-
scape. Indeed Mr. CYRIL HARcourt's
play might belong to just any year
since the time when women first began
to write those purple tales of passion
that are so bad for the morals of the
servants' hall. It was simply to get
copy for this kind of stuff that Mabel
Were (most improbably pretty in the
person of Miss GLADYs Cooper) adver-
tised for a husband, for this
post had already been as-
signed to the dullest and
stuffiest of fiancés. I dare
not think how the theme
might have been treated in
French hands, but Mr. HAR-
court is very firm about the
proprieties. My only fear
was that the gallery might
mistake his rather second-
rate people for gentlefolk.
In what kind of club, I
wonder, do members reply
to matrimonial advertise-
ments and make bets about
the result of their applica-
tions? I should be sorry to
think that anybody attri-
butes such conduct to the
habitués of the Athenaeum.
The types that came to
inspect Mabel Were were
sufficiently varied. There
was a masterful Colonial
(finally ejected by a lady-
friend, who performed a ju-
jitsu feat which required a
very palpable collusion on his part); a
butler; an Army Officer (with a reputa-
tion for exploring); a gay naval thruster,
and an old gentleman who ought to have
known better. To most of them she
opposedan air of virgin superciliousness
very disappointing to their justifiable
anticipations; but the butler promised
copy, and she accepted an invitation
to tea in his kitchen. This scene fur-
nished some very excellent and natural
fun, and there was really no need to
introduce, and exploit over and over
again, the hallowed device of a trip-
mat, that last resort of the bankrupt
farceur. The necessary complications
ensued with the unexpected arrival of
the master (one of the candidates for
the lady's hand, I need not say), who
makes sudden demand for an early
dinner, a thing impossible to execute
with the cook in a fit of hysterics in-
duced by jealousy of the lady who had
º
Mabel Vere .
supplanted her in the butler's perfidious
affections.
In the third Act we return to Mabel's
flat and resume her interviews with the
applicants for her hand. This revival
of the situation of the First Act was
a weakness in the construction. The
original fiancé—a wooden dummy set
up for the purpose of being knocked
down—is dismissed, and Captain Cor-
koran, the bold explorer, is appointed
to the vacancy.
but, if I wish him joy of it, I do so with-
out a pang of envy, for she was much
too good at back-chat for a quiet life,
to say nothing of her taste in literature,
which would want a deal of correction.

her seem much more desirable than
she really was. (I speak of her per-
sonal charm and not of her agreeable
costumes, which are for the pens
of more instructed reviewers. I got
nothing out of a lady near me, whom
I recognised as a dramatic critic by a
question that her neighbour put to her.
“Do you know this frock,” she asked,
“or will you have to go behind 2")
Apart from the delightful picture
which Miss CoopFR always presents
she has a most swift and delicate
feeling for the details of her craft.
She has the confidence that avoids
over-emphasis, and she does her audi-
ence the compliment of assuming that
they have intelligence enough to under-
stand the least of those little nods of
hers that have the true eloquence of an
under-statement. Mr. MALcol MCHERRY

broad humour of the butler with im-
perturbable restraint, and Miss BAR-
BARA GOTT was as fine and human a
cook as I ever wish to meet in her
native lair. Miss MARGARET FRASER,
a most attractive figure, was a model
for any housemaid on whose damask
cheek the concealment of an unrequited
passion for her master feeds like a worm
i' th' bud. Altogether a really excellent
cast.
The humour of the dialogue was
fresh and well sustained. Here and
there Mr. HARcourt permitted him-
self allusive refinements which de-
served a better response, as when Cap-
tain Corkoran, discussing with Mabel
the menu of the dinner that she fails to
cook for him, adapts the
language of SoLOMON and
says, “Fritter me apples,
for I am sick of love.” This
was lost upon an audience
insufficiently familiar with
the works of that great
voluptuary. O. S.

Specialist.)
Mr. Punch considers it
to be his duty at the pre-
sent time to show how an
abundance of excellent and
nourishing food may be ob-
tained from the most un-
likely materials. In doing
this he is aware that he is
merely following the ex-
ample set him by countless
culinary experts, who have
communicated their ideas to
the daily press; but Mr.
Punch is not to be deterred
from doing a helpful action
by any paltry jealousy as to precedence.
His readers, he knows, will be grateful
to him for his generosity.
No. I.-For GENERAL Use.

absolutely necessary that they should

added to them a Chairman, stew on a

powder. Drench with still lemonade
and boil into a thick paste. Add two
hundredweight of dandelions and plan-
tains together with at least three pounds
of garden-roller and five yards of wire-
netting carefully grilled. Let this be
roasted and basted for an hour and
then flavoured with vantage. Turn out
into a mould, and serve overhand as
fast as possible, having first shred into
the mixture half a ton of daisies or
buttercups, according to taste.
No. III.-BEESTING JELLY For
APIARIANs.
Catch one thousand bees and extract
their stings. Then throw away the
bees and lay the stings gently but
firmly on a mash composed of the
breasts of five Buff Orpington cockerels.
Sift the whole through a fine cloth and
add the yolks of a hundred poached
eggs. Beat up together for an hour
and ten minutes. Flavour with coffee
and dilute with elderberry wine. Allow
the mixture to simmer in a hot oven
and serve with fresh asparagus cut
before breakfast.
No. IV.-PUNTPole, PIE For
RIPARIAN Own ERs.
Chop into small pieces three or four
puntpoles, having first melted down
the metal shoes, and spread thin over
as many canoe paddles as can be
obtained for the purpose. Immerse
the whole suddenly in the river and
dry before a quick fire. Add one boat's
rudder and twenty-four dab-chicks, and
season with three yards of grated
swans' necks, six barbel, four dace and
a dozen gudgeon, close time for these
fish being strictly observed. Sprinkle
with cowslips' and willow leaves, insert
in a pie-dish and cover with a thick
paste of bulrushes and marsh grass.
Then set to bake for three hours, and
stick four pigeons' claws into the crust.
Picnic baskets from which the salt has
been omitted may be shredded over the
surface instead of parsley.
Mr. Punch has many more recipes
equally cheap and excellent, and is pre-
pared to disclose them to those of his
readers who may desire to practise a
rigid economy and at the same time to
enjoy an abundance of good food.

But whining is; we're going to win.”
And so, of course, they did.
TYRTAEUs' heart has ceased to beat,
But still his measures run,
And still abides the British Press,
Which men must credit, more or less,
To tell how things are done.
So by all bards with hearts of fire
Cheerfully be it sung,
That still our people may not tire
In doing well, but yet aspire;
Let these renew TYRTEUs' lyre,
Let others hold their tongue.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A volume called Curious Happenings (MILLS AND Boon)
can boast at least a highly attractive, open-and-see title; to
which is added, in the present instance, a wrapper-picture
of the most intriguing brand. Perhaps not quite all the
contents of Miss MARJoBIE Bowen's book of short stories
fully live up to the promise of its outside (what stories
could 2), but they have amongst them one, from which both
title and picture are taken, of very unusual and haunting
quality. So, if you should only be able to snatch so much
time from work of National importance as suffices to read
a single tale, begin at the start, and be assured of having
the best. Not that the others are without their attrac-
tions, though one is rather gratuitously revolting. Laid in
the picturesque eighteenth century, they all exhibit Miss
Bowen's very pretty gift for costume-drama at its happiest.
The trouble is that, with a volume of such short tales, stories
of situation, one gets too familiar with the method—as, for
example, in “The Folding Doors,” where a lady's husband
and lover had played out their -
scene before the closed doors
(with an alleged cut finger for
the husband), and I knew only
too well in what state the
flinging open of the doors,
would reveal the lady herself.
But perhaps I am excep-
tionally cursed in this mat-
ter; and, anyhow, a volume
that contains even one story
so good as “The Pond" is
a thing for gratitude and
rejoicing.

Miss M. E. F. IRwiN, whose previous books I remember
to have greatly enjoyed, has produced for her third a story
of much originality and power, called Out of the House
(CoNSTABLE). The title may perplex you at first. It comes
from the struggles of the heroine to wrench herself free
from encompassing family ties and the tradition of inter-
marriage, in order to join her life to the outside lover who
calls to her. You might therefore consider it, in some
sense, a story of eugenics, but that its outlook is emotional
rather than scientific. Yet the Pomfrets, as a result of
family pride and over-specialization, had become a suffi-
ciently queer lot to warrant a normal girl in any violence
of house-breaking to be free of them. Therein of course
lies the cleverness of the book; it is full of atmosphere, and
the atmosphere is full of dust, Pomfret dust. You can feel
how heavy to rebellious lungs must have been the air of
the Pomfret houses, where lived Philip, the intriguing
father, and his sons Anthony (a little mad) and Charles
(much more mad, but with at least the instincts of a lunatic
gentleman). It is not, you will guess, precisely a lively
tale, but the force of it is undeniable. Miss IRwiN has now

A PLACE OF ARMS.
[Inscribed by a humble member of the
Inner Temple to the Benchers of his Inn.]
I KNEw a garden green and fair,
Flanking our London river's tide,
And you would think, to breathe its air
And roam its virgin lawns beside,
All shimmering in their velve, fleece,
“Nothing can hurt this haunt of Peace.”
No trespass marred that close retreat;
Privileged were the few that went
| Pacing its walks with measured beat
On legal contemplation bent;
And Inner Templars used to say:
“How well our garden looks to-day !”
But That which changes all has
changed
This guarded pleasaunce, green and
fair,
And soldier-ranks therein have ranged
And trod its beauty hard and bare,
Have tramped and tramped its fretted
floor
Learning the discipline of War.
And many a moon of Peace shall climb
Above that mimic Field of Mars
Before the healing touch of Time
With springing green shall hide its
Scars ;
But Inner Templars smile and say:
“Our barrack square looks well to-day.”
Good was that garden in their eyes,
Lovely its spell of long-ago;
Now waste and mired its glory lies,
And yet they hold it dearer so,
Who see beneath the wounds it bears
A grace no other garden wears.
For still the memory, never sere,
But fresh as after fallen rain,
Of those who learned their lesson here
And may not ever come again,
Gives to this garden, bruised and
browned,
A greenness as of hallowed ground.

RANDOM FLIGHTS.
BY MARCUs MACLEoD.
(With renewed acknowledgments to “The
Skittish Weekly.")
It was with inexpressible relief that
I heard of the narrow escape of the
Rev. Urijah Basham. Presiding at a
jumble sale at Sidcup he described how
he had been within an ace of partaking
of rhubarb leaves at luncheon on the
previous day, but, having read in the
morning's paper of their fatal results,
wisely decided to abstain. I need hardly
remind my readers that Mr. Basham
is, after the Rev. Joseph HockING, per-
haps our greatest preacher - novelist.
The jumble sale was held in the beau-
tiful concert hall of the Sidcup Tem-
perance Congregational Reed Band.
The Dowager-Lady Bowler, Sir Moses
Pimblett, and the Rev. Chadley Band-
man were amongst those who graced
the function with their presence.
A correspondent has kindly sent
me a copy of The Little Diddlington
Parish Magazine for April. In it there
is an interesting letter claiming that
the original of Mr. Pickwick was a
benevolent gentleman named Swizzle,
who was temporarily employed as per-
petual curate of Little Diddlington in
the sixties. The evidence on which this
identification is founded seems to me
somewhat unconvincing, as Pickwick
was published in the year 1836. But
Nature, as it has been finely said, often
borrows from Art, and Fact may simi-
larly be inspired to emulate Fiction.
I promised not to trouble my readers
again with the Mystery of the Man
in the Iron Mask. But I may be
allowed merely to mention that there is
an excellent study of the subject in The
Methodist Monthly, by my old friend,
Professor Corker. The article, which
runs to nearly seventy pages, does the
utmost credit to this brilliant writer,
who comes to the conclusion that no
satisfactory solution of the mystery has
ever been propounded or ever can be.
But while his examination of the differ-
ent theories is singularly free from bias
he is evidently impressed by the in-
genious view of Dr. Amos Stoot, the
eminent Chicago alienist, that the
masked inmate of the Bastille immured
himself voluntarily in order to investi-
gate the conditions of French prison
life at the time, but, owing to the homi-
cidal development of his subliminal
consciousness, was detained indefinitely
by the authorities, and during his im-
prisonment wrote the Letters of Junius.
I have been reading with much en-
joyment, and I hope profit, a book
entitled Behind the Ivory Gate; Being
the IReminiscences of a Dentist, by
Orlando Pullar, F.R.D.S. Mr. Pullar's
opportunities for studying the psycho-
logy of his clients have been exceptional,
and he has turned them to rich account
in these fascinating pages. He is, more-
over, as adroit with his pen as with the
instruments of his humane and bene-
volent calling, and has a pretty wit.
Thus he tells us that his villa at Balham
is named “Tusculum,” and that, in view
of the fact that three generations of
Pullars have been dentists, his family
can be said to be of “old extraction.”
This pleasant quip I seem to have
heard before; but, with all deductions,
there are many signs here of a strong
sagacious mind, that brings to bear
on all the jars of daily life the priceless
emollient of moral uplift.
THE MUD LARKS.
NEveR have I seen a kiltie platoon
wading through the cold porridge of
snow and slush of which our front used
to be composed, but I have said, with
my French friend, “Mon Dieu, les
currents d'air / " and thank Fate that
I belong to a race which reserves its
national costume for fancy-dress balls.
It is very well for MacAlpine of Ben
Lomond, who has stalked his haggis
and devoured it raw, who beds down on
thistles for preference and grows his
own fur; but it is very hard on Smith
of Peckham, who through no fault of
his own finds himself in a Highland
regiment, trying to make his shirt-tails
do where his trousers did before. But
the real heather-mixture, double-dis-
tilled Scot is a hardy bird with different
ideas from mous autres as to what is
cold; also as to what is hot. Wit-
ness the trying experience of our Albert
Edward.
Our Albert Edward and a Hun rifle
grenade arrived at the same place at
the same time, intermingled and went
down to the Base to be sifted. In the
course of time came a wire from our
Albert Edward, saying he had got the
grenade out of his system and was at
that moment at the railhead; were we
going to send him a horse or weren't
we ?
Emma was detailed for the job, which
was a mistake, because Emma was not
the mount for a man who had been
softening for five months in hospital.
She had only two speeds in her réper-
toire, a walk which slung you up and
down her back from her ears to her
croup, and a trot which jarred your
teeth loose and rattled the buttons off
your tunic. However, she went to the
railhead and Albert Edward mounted
her, threw the clutch into the first
speed and hammered out the ten miles
to our camp, arriving smothered in
snow and so stiff we had to liſt him
down, so raw it was a mockery to offer
him a chair, and therefore he had to
take his tea off the mantelpiece.
We advised a visit to Sandy. Sandy
was the hot bath merchant. He lurked
in a dark barn at the end of the village,
and could be found there at any time of
any day, brooding over the black caul-
drons in which the baths were brewed,
his Tam-o'-shanter drooped over one
eye, steam condensing on his blue nose.
Theoretically the hot baths were free,
but in practice a franc pressed into
Sandy's forepaw was found to have a
strong calorific effect on the water.
So down the village on all fours,
groaning like a Dutch brig in a cross-
sea, went our Albert Edward. He
crawled into the dark barn and, having

no smaller change, contributed a two-
franc bill to the forepaw and told Sandy
about his awful stiffness. His eloquence
and the double fee broke Sandy's heart.
With great tears in his eyes he assured
Albert Edward that the utmost re-
sources of his experience and establish-
ment should be mobilised on his (Albert
Edward's) behalf, and ushered him ten-
derly into that hidden chamber, con-
structed of sacking screens, which was
reserved for officers. Albert Edward
peeled his clothes gingerly from him,
and Sandy returned to his cauldrons.
The peeling complete, Albert T.
Edward sat in the draughts of the
inner chamber and waited for the
bath. The outer chamber was
filled with smoke, and the flames
were leaping six feet above the
cauldrons; but every time Albert
Edward holloaed for his bath
Sandy implored another minute's
race.
Finally Allect Edward could
stand the draughts no longer and
ordered Sandy, on pain of court-
martial and death, to bring the
water, hot or not.
Whereupon Sandy reluctantly
brought his buckets along, and,
grumbling that neither his experi-
ence nor establishment had had a
fair chance, emptied them into the
tub. Albert Edward stepped in
without further remark and sat
down.
The rest of the story I had from
my groom and countryman, who,
along with an odd hundred other
people, happened to be patronising
the outer chamber tubs at the time.
He told me that suddenly they
heard “a yowl like a man that's

A CURE FOR CURIOSITY.
(An Idealistic Fable.)
Alfonso Ebenezer Scutt
Could never keep his mouth close shut:
And when I mention that his tongue
Was flexible and loosely hung,
You will begin to understand
Why he was honoured in our land.
A lucky coup in mining shares
Released him from financial cares,
And though his wife was strangely
plain—
A lady of Peruvian strain—
She had a handsome revenue
Derived from manganese and glue.
Thus fortified, in Nineteen-Six
Alfonso entered politics,
Ousting from Sludgeport-on-the-Ouse
A Tory of old-fashioned views.
Alfonso Scutt, though wont to preach
In chapels, rarely made a speech,
But managed very soon to climb
To eminence at Question Time.
Fired by insatiable thirst
For knowledge, from the very first
He launched upon an endless series
Of quite unnecessary queries,
Till overworked officials came
To loathe the mention of his name.
At last their anguish grew so keen
The Premier had to intervene,
And by a tactful master-stroke
Relieved them from Alfonso's yoke.
Mollie (who has been naughty and condemned to “no toast”). “OH, MUMMY ANYTHING BUT THAT' I'd RATHER HAVE A HARD smack
By way of liberal reward
He made the childless Scutt a lord,
And then despatched him on a Mission
In honorific recognition
Of presents sent for our relief
By a renowned New Guinea Chief.
The natives of those distant parts
Are noted for their generous hearts,
But, spite of protests raised by us,
Continue anthropophagous.
And this, I have no doubt, was why,
When Members wished Lord Scutt
good-bye,
You could not see one humid eye.
The moral of this simple strain
I trust is adequately plain.
When people crave for information
Unfit, in war, for publication,
They take a line, from vice or levity,
That's not conducive to longevity.
AN AFRICAN APPEAL.
THE Baboo must look to his laurels,
for other dusky aspirants to fluent
articulate culture are on the war-
path, and they are by no means to
be underrated. I have seen lately
quite a number of letters from young
studious gentlemen of Ashantee, who,
having acquired a little English, desire
more, and develop a passion for cor-
respondence with English strangers,
whose names they pick up. The fol-
lowing typical example, dated March
9th, 1917, will serve to illustrate the
new habit:-
“DEAR SIR,--I am with much plea-
sure to indite you about your name
that has come to my hand with great
joy. On the receipt of this letter, know
that I want to be one of your fellow
friends. You have been reported to me
by a friend of mine of your good atten-
tion and benevolences. My openion of
writing you is to say, I want to take
you as my favourite friend. Every-
thing or news that may be happened
there at your side, I wish you to report
same to me. And I also shall report
same to you satisfaction. Will you be
good enough to agree with me? Then
I hope to get few lines of news from
you being as you consented or dis-
consented. To have a friend at abroad
is something that delights the life. I
|am earnestly requested to hear from
I beg to detain, dear Sir,
Yrs truly, .”
To whom do you think that letter is
addressed ? You would suppose to some
public personage with a reputation for
cordial sympathy with the young and
earnest, such as the CHIEF Scout, for
instance. But no, the “Dear Sir '' is
in reality a limited liability company,
one of whose circulars, I suppose,
wandered to the Gold Coast.

THE LAW COURTS THEATRE.
“ROMNEY's RUM 'UN.”
LoNDoN was probably never richer
in comic actors than at the present
moment, for not only is W. H. BERRY
at the Adelphi, LEslie HENsoN at the
Gaiety, ARTHUR Roberts at the Oxford
singing his old songs, and Robert HALE
and GEORGE Robey twice daily else.
where, but in the Law Courts Play-
house CHARLEs DARLING has been lately
at his very best. Dropping in there
last week, during the performance of a
new farce, entitled Itomney's Rum 'Un,
I was again fascinated by the inex-
haustible wit and allusive badinage of
this great little comedian, beside whose
ready gagging GEORGE GRAVEs himself
is inarticulate. Had not GEorg E Robey
invented for application to himself the
descriptive phrase, “The Prime Minis-
ter of Mirth,” it should be at once
affixed to the Law Courts' fun-maker;
but, since it is too late to use that, let
us think of him as “The Chancellor of
the Exchequer of Mirth.”
CHARLEs DARLING's success is the
more remarkable because he keeps so
still. He sits in his chair as steadily as
another of his outdistanced rivals, SAM
MAYo (“The Immobile Comedian,” as
he is called), remains standing. He has
few gestures; he rarely, if ever, sings,
and I have never seen him dance; and
yet the way in which he “gets over" is
astonishing. “Laughter holding both
his sides” is the most constant attend-
ant of this theatre.
What is the secret 2 Well, first and
foremost it is of course to be sought in
the genius of the actor himself; but
contributory causes are the acceptivity
of the audience, which is more notice-
able in the Law Courts than in any
other London theatre, and the willing-
ness of his fellow-performers to “feed”
him, as stage-folk have it; that is
to say, provide him with materials
upon which (again resorting to stage
language) he may “crack his wheezes.”
The other day, for example, that ex-
cellent comedian, John SIMON, was
his principal ally in this way, and
nothing could have been better than
the sympathy between the two funny
men. To CHARLEs DARLING naturally
fell the fat of the dialogue, but no
one enjoyed the treat more than
Johs SIMON, in whose dictionary the
word jealousy does not exist. LESLIE
Scott also did his best to “feed" his
principal, and the results were a scream.
If the jokes were now and then a
little legal, what did it matter? Many
of the audience were legal too, and that
there is no better audience the reports
of the farces played here day after day
abundantly prove. They are out for
fun, and therefore in an appreciative
and complaisant mood.
To prove a comedian's genius to the
mere reader is a difficult matter, and
one can never hope to re-embody him
in all his humorous idiosyncracies; but
quotation comes to one's aid, and in the
case of such a wit as CHARLEs DARLING
it is invaluable. Thus John SIMON,
referring to Mrs. Siddons' unwieldi-
ness in her old age, said that in a
certain part she had to be helped
from her knees by two attendants.
Quick as lightning came the comment,
“When she was younger she was able
to rise on her own merits.” Was ever
so exquisitely funny and unexpected a
turn given to the dull word “merits"?
Another perfect thing from this divert-
ing piece, followed also by Homeric
cachinnations, was the mock-serious
apophthegm : “If a cloud is going to
support a lady of substantial propor-
tions, you must make it fairly solid.”
I came away with reluctance, filled
with wonder at the want of enterprise
shown by our revue-managers in not
having, long ere now, secured CHARLEs
DARLING's services. If only he con-
tinues to take his art seriously he has
a great future. Meanwhile I am apply-
ing embrocation to my sore sides. .

I HAVE no wounds to show; the can-
non's thunder
Does not impair my rest. It's just
as well, -
For, though I dote on blood, and
thoughts of plunder
Act on my jaded spirit like a spell,
I could not but regard it as a blunder
If Prussia's foremost scribe should
stop a shell.
So, while I sport the usual iron crosses,
No feats of valour pinned them on
my breast,
But writing up the sanguinary losses
Inflicted by our genius in the West.
The punctual theme of my Imperial
boss is
“Turn on a victory !” and I do the
rest.
To praise each spasm of ruthlessness
that passes
Down cringing Hollweg's compro-
mising spine,
Boost the pretensions of the ruling
classes
And hail the Hohenzollerns as divine,
And never hesitate to tell the masses
They are and will continue to be
SW line :-
These are my task. And there are
compensations
About the job that field-grey heroes
lack.
Although, e.g., there is a dearth of
rations,
I'm not the one that goes without
his whack;
Nor do the bayonets of inferior nations
Send nervous chills down my retreat-
ing back.
Yet sometimes in the small and early
watches
I think, “Good Lord! suppose the
U-boats fail! -
Or our Colossus of the purple blotches
sº let the Allies get him by the
taill
Suppose this war is one of Deutsch- |
land's botches,
And Right, not Might, should happen
to prevail!"
There'd be a revolution; nought could
stop it.
Not that I'd weep if Wii.HELM had
to go;
But what if Holy Junkerdom should
cop it? -
That would be most unfortunate—
and, oh! -
Supposing Count REVENTLow had to
hop it,
Kultur would never rally from the
blow. ALGoL.

ZERO.
(“Zero-hour"—commonly hinown as “Zero”—is the hour
fired for the opening of an Infantry attack.)
I woke at dawn and flung the window wide.
Behind the hedge the lazy river ran;
The dusky barges idled down the tide;
In the laburnum-tree the birds began ;
And it was May and half the world in flower;
F saw the sun creep over an Eastward brow,
And thought, “It may be, this is Zero-hour;
Somewhere the lads are ‘going over' now.”
Somewhere the guns speak sudden on the height
And build for miles their battlement of fire;
Somewhere the men that shivered all the night
Peer anxious forth and scramble through the
W11'e,
Swarm slowly out to where the Maxims bark,
And green and red the panic rockets rise;
And Hell is loosed, and shyly sings a lark,
And the red sun climbs sadly up the skies.
Now they have won some sepulchred Gavrelle,
Some shattered homes in their own dust con-
cealed ;
Now no Bosch troubles them nor any shell,
But almost quiet holds the thankful field,
While men draw breath, and down the Arras road
Come the slow mules with battle's dreary stores,
And there is time to see the wounded stowed,
And stretcher-squads besiege the doctors' doors.
Then belches Hell anew. And all day long
The afflicted place drifts heavenward in dust;
All day the shells shriek out their devils' song;
All day men cling close to the earth's charred crust;
Till, in the dusk, the Huns come on again,
And, like some sluice, the watchers up the hill
Let loose the guns and flood the soil with slain,
And they go back, but scourge the village still.
I see it, all. I see the same brave souls
To-night, to-morrow, though the half be gone,
Deafened and dazed, and hunted from their holes,
Helpless and hunger-sick, but holding on.
I shall be happy all the long day here,
But not till night shall they go up the steep,
And, nervous now because the end is near,
Totter at last to quietness and to sleep.
And men who find it easier to forget
In England here, among the daffodils,
That there in France are fields unflowered yet,
And murderous May-days on the unlovely hills—
Let them go walking where the land is fair
And watch the breaking of a morn in May,
And think, “It may be Zero over there,
But here is Peace"—and kneel awhile, and pray.
“Surely one result of the war will be that civilised races will re-
gard the German as an outcast unfit to associate with or to have deal-
ings with on equal terms. If he is able to say ‘tu grogue' we shall
put ourselves in a false position.”—Times of India.
For ourselves, we decline to do this. We shall simply

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ES S E N C E OF P A R L I A M E N T.
Our racing correspondent writes that Mr. LLoyd GEORGE is having some difficulty with his string (Sinn Fein's Beauty GINNELL,
All and More for Ireland REDMoND, and Ulster CARson) for the Irish Grand National.
Monday, May 14th.-No longer will
the FIRST SEA Lord be distracted from
his primary duty of strafing the Hun by
the necessity of looking after supplies.
That function will now be discharged
by an hon. and temp. Vice-Admiral, in
the person of Sir ERIC GEDDEs, late
hon. and temp. Major-General and
Director of Transportation to the Army
in France, and now Shipbuilder-in-
Chief to the nation. Everyone seemed
pleased, with the notable exception of
Mr. Hogg|E, who cannot understand
why all these appointments should be
showered upon Sir ERIC GEDDEs, when
there are other able Scotsmen still un-
employed. A late hon. Admiral of the
Fleet, now residing at Potsdam, is be-
lieved to share Mr. Hogge's objections.
The hardships endured by the criminal
classes when they are so unfortunate
as to get into prison always strikes a
sympathetic chord in the gentle breast
of Mr. EDMUND HARVEY. His latest
discovery is that they are allowed the
use of writing-paper not more than once
a month ; and for the rest of the time
have to entrust their literary composi-
tions to the unsympathetic surface of a
slate, with the aid of a probably squeaky
slate-pencil. Could JoHN BUNYAN have
written The Pilgrim's Progress under'
such conditions? The question opens
up a vista of speculation as to the influ-
ence of environment upon the creative
faculty; and it is not surprising that
Mr. BRACE was unable to answer it
offhand.
In ordinary times the Financial
Secretary of the Treasury is the most
important Member of the Government
outside the Cabinet. Under the present
régime he is not a member of the House
at all. It is true that Mr. BALDw1N
takes his place as Parliamentary whip-
ping-boy to the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER with much grace and good
humour; but that does not satisfy hon.
Members, who want a more substantial
object for their daily castigation. The
debate on this subject revealed a sharp
division of opinion between Mr. Edwin
MonTAGU and Mr. HERBERT SAMUEL.
Cousin EDw1N, as an ex-Secretary of
the Treasury, did not think the House
had suffered any serious loss through
being unable to cross-examine that
official direct. Cousin HERBERT was
shocked at this revolutionary sentiment
coming from his kinsman. If it were
accepted there was no logical reason
why even the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer should have a seat in the
House. Why, indeed, have Ministers
at all 2 A row of gramophones, ranged
along the Treasury Bench and supplied
with officially prepared records, would
satisfy all legitimate curiosity.
Tuesday, May 15th.-I forget how
many weeks ago it is since Mr. BoNAR
LAW announced that the Government
were going to make one more effort to
settle the Irish Question, and that in
due course the PRIME MINISTER would
announce their proposals. Since then
events have conspired to produce suc-
cessive postponements. Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE had to go to France—for the
War refuses to stop even though Irish-
men decline to encourage it—Mr. RED-
Mond fell ill, Archbishop WALSH in-
dited a postscript, and an election in
South Longford suggested doubts as to
whether Nationalist M.P.'s were really
the Irish nation after all. Nevertheless
there is a plan; and it is to be com-
municated, but in the first instance to
the leaders of Irish parties only, and
then, if they please, to the Press, and
finally, perhaps, to the House of Com-
In On S.
Wednesday, May 16th.-We all want
to help the new Russian Government
in its difficult task, but I doubt if Mr.
SNowdºN and his pacifist friends have
contributed to that end by inviting the
House of Commons to endorse forth-
with the “no annexation, no indem-
nities” declaration of a section of the

Revolutionaries, and by supporting their
proposal in a series of speeches which
might be summed up in the words
“Peace at any Price.” Even the Ger-
man CHANCELLOR will not be wholly
pleased, for the debate revealed that,
apart from the seven or eight gentle-
men who follow the white flag of the
Member for Blackburn, the House is
absolutely fixed in its determination
to defeat German militarism before
talking of peace. -
After the searching analysis to which
the hon. Member's confident statements
were subjected by Lord Robert CECIL
and Mr. A. F. WHYTE there was nothing
left of them but a trace of acid.
So far as I am aware the Member for
Blackburn has never endangered the
integrity of his principles by helping
his country in any way to win the War.
In this respect Mr. LEEs SMITH, who
seconded the motion, has a less con-
sistent record, for he has worn khaki as
an orderly of the R.A.M.C. But in his
case service abroad seems only to have
confirmed his peculiar principles, for he
thinks that we ought to return the
German colonies, and enable the natives
to enjoy once again the blessings of
Kultur. If he ever saw the Hun while
he was in France it must have been
through a pair of rose-tinted binoculars.
Thursday, May 17th.-We are all
agog to know whether the PRIME
MINISTER's offer of immediate Home
Rule to twenty-six Counties of Ireland
is to be blessed or banned by the
Nationalists. This is the day when
Irish Questions have priority, and the
House hears such important inquiries
as whether Hibernian holiday-makers
will have their excursion-trains restored
to them; what became of a side of bacon
captured by the police during the Easter
Monday rebellion, and why a certain
magistrate should have been struck
off the Commission of the Peace for
a trifling refusal to take the oath of
allegiance. Are we to go without this
entertainment in the future, or will Mr.
REDMond refuse to rob Westminster
of its gaiety even for the sake of College
Green 2
If, as I ventured to suggest last
week, the CHANCELLOR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER had laid in a stock of tobacco
before the Budget he has evidently ex-
hausted it by now, for, on his attention
again being called to the exorbitant
charge of the tobacconists, he no longer
pooh-poohed the matter, but sternly
declared that the situation was being
closely watched.

Because their country's name is scrolled
With Liberty's; because her fate,
Like England's own, must be unrolled
In Freedom still, they had to hate
The thought of bowing down before
A Lord of War.
And now they'll lavish in the strife
The gold they've scorned to love too
well,
And fleets to bring the food that's life,
And guns of death, and steel and
shell;
Defeat or triumph, stand or fall,
They'll share their all.
They're out for business; now 's their

They took their time, but finished

The heat got slowly comes to stay;
Patient for peace means firm in fight;
And so their country still shall be

“Je vous tends mom corbillon : qu'y

her basket towards the first of her dolls
seated ina semi-circle before her. Most
of them were quite familiar with the
game, but for the sake of a new-comer
Jeanne had explained that each player
must place in the basket some object
the name of which ended with on, to
rhyme with corbillon. She had an-
nounced that this time the game was
in aid of a cause, and that therefore it
must be played with things and not
with words only.
“Qu'y met - on, Marie?” repeated
Jeanne. “Rappelez - vous bien que
c'est une quête à l'intention des petites
filles polonaises internées au camp de
Havelberg'" What, Marie had nothing
but her chain necklace, and that did not
end in on 2 No, but the links of the
chain did, argued Jeanne. “Donne des
chainons !” she prompted in a whisper.
“J”y mets des chainons,” said Marie in
Jeanne's thinnest voice, and the neck-
lace found its way into the basket.
“Je vous tends mon corbillon : quy

claimed Jeanne, “tu y mets ton chig-

and into the basket she went after a
lingering caress from Jeanne.
“Je vous tends mon corbillon : qu'y

Yvonne in her bed. “Comment,” said

from their beds and carried off without
any bedclothes at all, let alone an

say, and “Sage''' approved Jeanne.
“Je vous tends mon corbillon : qu'i,
met-on 2 Jacques, mon pauvre ami, tu
n'as pas de chance, hein 2" There
was no help for it; it was the only
thing he had that rhymed. “Imagine
la joie des petites polonaises internées' "
she urged, taking the necessary action.
“J”y mets mon pantalon,” piped a dis-
consolate little thread of voice.
“Je vous tends mom corbillon : qu'y
met-on 2 A vous, Mikadesse!” A beam
of pleasure, succeeded by a falling of
the countenance, then a look of decision,
ended in a “Houp-lä 1" as the Japanese
doll descended into the basket, and was
made to say, “J”y mets une poupée du
Japon " After all she was an ally of
the little polonaises.
“Je vous tends mon corbillon : qu'ſ
met-on 2 Allons, les jumeaux! A vous !”
Jeanne thought the twins were really
in a plight and that she would have to
help them out with a gift, but, quick
And what about the little

ing, “J”y mets mon compagnon "
and Pollux, divining his intention,
grasped Castor, declaring excitedly,
“Et moi aussi, j'y mets mon compag-
non.” And into the basket they leapt
together. “Ils s'entétent à rester in-
séparables,” sighed Jeanne; “c'est
bien.” -
“Je vous tends mom corbillon : qu'i)
met-on 2" Adélaïde never had possessed
anything worth giving away, and yet
she seemed to be suggesting that the
contents of the basket did not look
very imposing so far, and would hardly
be enough to go round among so many
little Poles, so Jeanne came to the
rescue with gifts of toys until “J”y
mets ma contribution " " came jubi-
lantly forth in a voice that forgot to
be Adélaïde's.
All had now contributed. Yet Jeanne
had a feeling that somehow it was not
the end of the game. She pondered
gravely for a few moments, then,
placing herself solemnly before the
mirror, she addressed herself:-
“Jeanne, je vous tends mom corbillon :
qu'y met-on 2 " After a few seconds
she began to see what she ought
to do.
“Qu'y mets-tu, Jeanne 2 " It would
be rather hard, but she must do it.

“Oh, but our General Com-

jealousy about our General Com-
mittee. Besides, the Executive
Committee has power to act,
and it doesn't need to report

Fond Mother (reading). “‘OUR capTAIN Is ONE of THE BEST, AND we'RE READY To Follow HIM. To H . . L.' I suppose: HE MEANs
THE HINDENBURG LINE.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN the list of heroic young soldier-authors whose gifts
the War has revealed to us only to snatch them away, the
name of DONALD HANKEY already holds an honoured place.
It will, therefore, be good news to the many admirers of
A Student in Arms that a further selection of these hearten-
ing and fine-spirited papers has been prepared under the
title of A Student in Arms—Second Series (MELRose). The
thousands who already know and admire Lieut. HANKEY's
work will need no introduction to this, which exhibits all
the qualities of courage and sympathy that have given the
former book a world-wide popularity. They, and others,
will however welcome the occasion afforded here of learning
something about the life and personality of the writer,
which they will do both from the short preface contributed
by one whose identity is hardly disguised under the initials
“H.M. A. H.,” and from a couple of papers, autobiographical,
that end the volume. Rugbieans especially will be inter-
ested to read DoNALD HANKEY's recollections of his school-
days, with their tribute to the house-master affectionately
known to so many generations as “Jackey.” A book, in
short, that will add to the admiration and regret with which
its author is spoken of in three continents.
He Looked in My Window (CHATTo AND WINDUs), by
Robert HALIFAx, gives the adventures of Ruth Shadd,
decentest of dwellers in a meanish street, during her
determined hunt for a husband. It would have been easy
to make all this unlovely in its frankness, but the author
very skilfully (and, I think, very sincerely) avoids this.
Ruth is a fine girl, with character and candour, those too
rare assets, and having pursued, and found wanting, Bert,
the swanker, who hasn't the courage for matrimony; the
polite and fatuously prudent Archie, and Joe, the vege-
tarian, who had such exalted faith in malt, she wins
a deserved happiness with someone that she had never
even thought of pursuing. Mr. HALIFAX gives me an
impression of almost cinematographic and gramophonic
exactness in his portraiture. George Shadd, Ruth's father,
who worked in the gasworks and was one of the very best,
delighted me particularly, with his pathetic little garden,
his battle with the slugs and black-fly, and his fine patience
with Mrs. Shadd, who put her washing before his fire and
her props among his choicest seedlings—a difficult woman
indeed. The author writes with humour and sympathy;
and that is the way to write of this brave if narrow life.
It is the first time I have looked in Mr. HALIFAx's window.
I shall take steps to do so again. 'Tis a nice clean window.
Not even the most confirmed Gallio can avoid caring for
Arthur Stanton—A Memoir, by the Rt. Hon. G. W. E.
Russell, (LoNGMANs), when he has once dipped his mind
into the book. It is the record of a singularly beautiful
and beneficent life, lived to the very utmost in the service
of God and man, and ruled by a simple and direct religion
which constantly forced practice up to the exalted level of
precept. Judged by merely worldly standards of achieve-
ment, ARTHUR STANToN's life could not be considered a
success. He began as curate of St. Alban's, Holborn, and
as curate of St. Alban's he ended after many years of
enthusiastic devotion to humanity. He was foiled and
thwarted by the great ones of the Church, inhibited in one

a Bishop or a Chaplain-General set, like a lion, across his
path. But nothing could avail to stop him where he found
a soul that could be saved or misery that could be relieved.
His congregation, drawn from the slums of Holborn, would
have died for him to a man, for they realised with how
great an ardour his life was spent in order that he might
help them. His faith was not a mystery kept apart for
special occasions, but a daily and hourly influence vivifying
his words and directing his actions. And no man could
have enjoyed himself more than this true saint and inter-
preter of God to man. His religion was not one of gloom
and foreboding, but a cheerful and delightful habit of mind
and soul. Tantum religio potuit suadere bonorum. Mr.
RUsselſ, has done his work with great skill and perfect
sympathy, and has produced a book that does honour to
himself and to the beloved friend whom it is his privilege
to commemorate.

will be glad to have them in *
collected form. The memory of
his gallant end—he was killed
in action after the brilliant cap-
ture of a salient near Ypres, at
the head of his company of
Shropshires—is fresh in all our
hearts. A preface to At the
Front (CoNSTABLE) contains an
appreciation of his high charac-
ter and soldierly qualities by his
friend and fellow-officer, Captain
INGRAM, R.A.M.C., D.S.O., M.C.,
who a few weeks later was him- *
self killed. It is a fine tribute
paid by one true soldier to
another. These letters of ALEC
Johnston, as their editor re-
minds us, “were composed in
the brief interludes snatched -- - --
from hard fighting and hard fatigues. They never pre-
tended to be more than the gay and cynical banter of one
who brought to the perils of life at the Front an incur-
able habit of humour. They are typical of that brave
spirit, essentially English, that makes light of the worst
that fate can send.”
º
It must, I should think, be exceedingly difficult to find
a new title in these days for a volume of reminiscences.
Mr. RAYMoND BLATHwayT seems to have solved the problem
happily enough by calling his contribution to the rapidly-
increasing library of recollections, Through Life and Round
the World (ALLEN). One way and another, first as a curate
(rightly termed by the publishers “rather unconventional"),
later as journalist, Mr. BLAthwayt has contrived to use a
pair of remarkably open eyes with excellent effect. The
result is this fat volume, whose contents, if honesty con-
strains me to call the most of them gossip, are at least
generally entertaining and never ill-natured. Needless to
say, Mr. BLATHwayt, like the elder Capulet, can “tell a tale
such as will please.” For myself, out of a goodly store, I
should select for first honours a repartee, new to me, of
Sir HERBERT TREE (forgive this dropping into rhyme !). It
tells of a boastful old-time actor, vaunting his triumphs as
Hamlet, when “the audience took fifteen minutes leaving

Mr. BLATHwayt's dramatic recollections, I must respect-
fully traverse his dictum that some of the acting at the
local pageants of a few years back “surpassed the very
best I have seen upon the stage.” As one who took a
personal part in many of those well-meant revivals, and
dates a relaxed throat from the effort of vociferating history,
up-wind, towards a stand full of ear-straining auditors,
I bow but remain unconvinced.
Although the literary style of Mr. JULIUs M. PRICE, of
The Illustrated London News, is too breezy for my taste, I
am glad to have read his Sir Months on the Italian Front
(CHAPMAN AND HALL). Possibly he under-estimates our
appreciation of Italy's share in the War's burden, but
his account of the conditions prevailing upon the Italian
front, and of the courage and skill with which they have
been overcome, deserves our undiluted approval. It is
difficult to believe that anyone who is not at least a member
been given many opportunities
of observation, and where none

trived to make them for himself.

remarkable, but adequate to convey an impression. We

THE PROPHETIC PRESENT.
“There is no Hindenburg line.”
Inspired German Press.
By nature they abhor the light,
But here in this their latest tract
Your parrot Press by oversight
Has deviated into fact ;
If not (at present) strictly true,
It shows a sound anticipation
Born of the fear that's father to
The allegation.
For, though the boasted “line” of which
No trace occurs on German maps
Retains the semblance of a ditch,
It has some nasty yawning gaps;
It bulges here, it wobbles there,
It crumples up with broken hinges,
Keeping no sort of pattern where
Our Push impinges.
When the triumphant word went round
How that your god, disguised as man,
At victory's height was giving ground
According to a well-laid plan,
Here he arranged to draw the line
(As Siegfried's you were told to
hymn it)
And plant Nil ultra for a sign—
Meaning the limit.
And now “There's no such thing,”
they say;
Well, that implies prophetic sense;
And, if a British prophet may
Adopt their graphic present tense,
I would remark—and so forestall
A truth they'll never dare to trench
On :–
There is no HINDENBURG at all,
Or mone worth mention.

WAYS AND MEANS.
I MET her at the usual place, and
she looked much the same as usual—
which astonished me rather.
“Now that we're engaged,” I began.
“Oh, but we aren't,” said Phyllis.
“Are you by any chance a false
woman 2" I asked. “You remember
what you said last night?”
“I do, and what I said I stick to.
But that was pleasure, and this is
business.”
I looked at her in sudden alarm.
“You're-you're quite sure you
aren't a widow, Phyllis 2"
“Quite. Why?"'
“Talking of business at a time like
this. It sounds so—so experienced.”
“Well, if you will try to settle our
whole future lives in one short week-
end leave, we must at least be practical.
Anyway, it's just this. I'm not going
to be engaged to you until there's
some prospect of our getting married.
I hate long engagements.”
“That means not till after the War,
then,” said I disconsolately.
“I'm afraid it does. But when
once the War's over it won't be long
before you'll be able to keep me in the
style to which I'm accustomed, will

“Years and years, I should think,”
said I, looking at her new hat. “It’ll
take at least a pound a day even to
start with.”
“Three hundred and sixty-five a
year,” said she thoughtfully.
“And an extra one in Leap Year,”
I warned her.
“Did I ever tell you,” she asked with
pride, “that I have money of my
own 2''
“Hurrah!” I shouted.

“Jimmy,” she said apprehensively,
“you aren't marrying me for it, are
you?”
“How can I tell till I know how
much you've got?”
“Well, at a pound a day it would
take us to February 19th. You'd have
to begin from there.”
“What an heiress! Promise you'll
never cast it in my teeth, dear, that
I've got less than you. I've got enough

Exchequer Bonds and things which

writing.”
“Oh,” she said in a surprised tone
“do they pay you for that 2 I always
thought you gave them so much a line
to put things in-like advertisements,
you know.”
“Madam,” I answered with dignity,
“when you find yourself, from April 1st
until April 20th, depending each year
upon my pen for the vely bread you
eat, perchance you will regret those
wounding words.” " r
“Well, what else?”
I shook my head.
“That's all,” I said. “We don't seem
to have got very far, do we? Couldn't
you—er—trim hats, or take in wash-
ing, or something 2"
“No-but you could. I mean, we
haven't counted in your salary yet,
have we ?”
“What salary?"
“Well, whatever they give you for
doing whatever you do. What were
you getting before the War 2"
“Oh, nothing much.”
“Yes, but how much 2 ''
“Really,” I began stiffly.
“If you're ashamed to say it right out,
just tell me how far it would take us.”
“To about the end of September, I
should think.”
“Oh, dear! Three more months to
“You dar-
go.” A frown wrinkled her forehead;
then her brow cleared. “Why, of
course we haven't counted in the
holidays.”
“They aren't usually an asset.”
“Yes, they are-if you spend them
with your rich relations. I've got lots,
but I don't think they'd like you
much.”
“All right,” said I shortly; “keep
your beastly relations. I shall go to
Uncle Alfred for October. He loves
me.” -
“That leaves November and Decem-
ber,” she mused. “Oh, well, there's
nothing else for it—we must quarrel.”
“What, now 2 "
“No, stupid. Every October 31st,
by letter. Then I'll go home to mother,
and you'll stay with Uncle Alfred some
more. I hope he'll like it.”
“Y-e-s,” I said doubtfully. “That
would do it, of course. But we shan't
see very much of each other that way,
shall we ? Still, I suppose . . . Good
Heavens !”
“What's the matter ?”
“Phyllis, we've forgotten all about
income-tax. That means about another
two months to account for.”
“My dear, how awful 1"
There was a pause while we both
thought deeply. w
“Couldn't you . . . " we began to-
gether at last, and each waited for the
other to finish.
“Look here,” I remarked, “we’re
both very good at finding things for
the other to do. Isn't there anything
we could do together—a job for 're-
spectable married couple,' you know?" |
“Why, of course–caretaking! We'll
look after ducal mansions in the silly
season, when everybody's out of town.
Then we'll see simply heaps of one
another.”
“Yes,” I agreed. “And then in the
evenings, when you've scrubbed the
steps and the woodwork and polished
the brass and dusted the rooms and
cleaned the grate and cooked the meals
and tidied the kitchen, and I've
inspected the gas-meter and fed the
canary, or whatever it is a he-care-
taker does, we'll dress ourselves up
and go and sit in the ducal apartments
and pretend we're ‘quality.'”
“And impress our relations by asking
them to dinner there,” added Phyllis.
“I think it's a lovely idea. We don't
seem to be going to have much money,
but we shall see life. I'm beginning
to be quite glad I listened to you yes-
terday, after all.”
An Accommodating Creature.

LXI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Have I ever,
in the course of these SECRET and
CoNFIDENTIAL despatches, called your
lordship's attention to the existence,
the very marked existence, of our
Hubert, “the little Captain,” who,
being out of the battle for the moment,
relies upon argument for argument's
sake to keep up his circulation ? It
has been said of him that he spends his
office time in writing superior letters
letters to his superiors; but that, I
think, is over harsh. In any case, as
he has now run short of grievances,
and the authorities of the B.E.F.
regard him as a joke and like him best
when his little temper is hot, his fights
to his subordinates and insubordinate
a statement in writing. After some
little discussion he got it, since the
secretary, for all his caution, could see
no harm in an unofficial note, addressed
to no one in particular, and stating
merely that Hubert wanted to see the
politician and the politician was out
till 6 P.M. -
The little captain is one of those who
state their grievances to themselves,
when no other audience is available.
During his return journey to the W.O.
mental processes of no little heat and
significance took place in his busy head,
he putting up an overwhelming case to
show why his leave ought to be, and
must be, extended. The force of this
case gave him such a burning sense
of justice as to carry him, this time,
safely past the policeman.
Five rows of barbed wire, two of
and clearing his throat, he prepared to
knock and enter. Fortunately, however,
his audacious intention was observed
by an official and frustrated. He was
commanded to write something more
about himself in the book provided for
that purpose, and to go on waiting.
Being now an expert at writing and
waiting he did as he was bid, spending
the next few hours of his life remodel-
ling his case in less fierce and glowing
terms.
At last the door of the room per-
suaded itself to open and let out a real
red god, who looked upon Hubert, took
an instant dislike to him, relieved him
of his ticket and went in again. During
the ensuing period of suspense the last
vestige of Hubert's personality departed
from him.
Again the door opened and another
out here have for some time
lacked reality. I fancy that he
was merely in search of a casus
belli when, being on leave in
the U.K., he conceived the idea =
of a day's extension and stepped
round to the War Office to de-
mand same as of right. º
But the War Office, Charles, º
is not as other places and War
Officers are not like the com-
mon sort. Hubert, arriving in
his best fighting trim, was at
once ejected by the policeman
at the door. He underesti-
mated the importance of that
official and his office, otherwise
he would not have adopted the
just-dropping-in-to-have-a-
chat-with-a-friend-inside atti-
tude. From the constable's
cold response he realised that, in tack-
ling the W.O. single-handed, he was
attempting a big thing, whereas the
W.O., in tackling him, was not under
the same disadvantage. Then he did
what was unusual with him ; he paused
to think before resuming the offensive.
What he wanted, he felt, was big guns.
The House of Commons caught his eye
and reminded him of politicians. He
recalled a slight acquaintance with one
of the more important of these and
went round to call upon him person-
ally. It was not his idea to obtain any
such authority as would demolish all
opposition at the W.O.; he just hoped
to get a personal chit, which would act
as a smoke barrage and at least cover
his advance right into the middle of the
enemy defences.
So Hubert asked for the politician
in person, but only got his secretary.
This gentleman, having elicited that
Hubert's train for France left at 5 P.M.,
regretted that the politician would
not be visible till 6. This opposition
warmed Hubert's blood; he asked for
THE FIRST POTATO-LEAF'

substitute for the barriers of the W.O.
Before you set foot on the staircase
you have to produce a ticket, and it is
forms to be filled in, forfeits a day's pay
every time he parts with one. Hubert,
gradually losing confidence, wrote upon
the form all he could think of about
himself, and handed it to the porter,
who received it with reluctance, read it
with suspicion, and disappeared with a
grunt. What he did with it is not
known ; probably someone got into
communication with the B.E.F. to
existed, and, if so, why? Meanwhile
Hubert had good time to realise that
no one loved him and that this was
cold brutal war at last.
Bit by bit the porter drifted back and
gave Hubert his form, now stamped
and become his ticket. The porter
having finished with him, he passed on
and, after many wanderings, found the

door of the room where his sentence extension solely in order to interview
would be passed. Bracing himself up the politician at 6 P.M.; he was to
red one, even more godlike,
emerged clamouring for Hu-
| bert and his blood. Had he
still been in possession of his
| ticket (a necessary passport for
egress) Hubert would have fled.
There was nothing for it but
* to confess his identity and to
hope for mercy. The god, who
and a half seconds to spare,
| demanded an explanation of
his presence. Hubert admitted
that once, in a moment of im-
pudent folly, he had thought
of asking for a day's exten-
|sion. The god said nothing,
but a light, smouldered in
his eyes which intimated to
| Hubert that if he did not at
once produce some paramount
excuse for so monstrous a request the
| War would be held up and the military
machine would be concentrated on
punishing Hubert. His tongue clove
supposed that the porter, who has the

been available it would have helped
little, for it is more than mere words
that the gods require. His hand
searched in his pockets and produced
the return half of his leave warrant,
a five-franc note, a box of matches,
a recently purchased paper flag and
the politician's secretary's note. The
first and the last were taken, the rest
fell to the floor, the door closed once
more and again Hubert was alone.
Hubert doesn't know what he did
next; probably, he thinks, he sat down
and wept, and it was his tears that
induced the gods not to convert his
ticket into a death-warrant, but instead
to give him the slip, “Leave extended
one day for urgent private business.”
This was clearly one of Hubert's most

interview the politician solely in order
to obtain his day's extension. But
Hubert insists morbidly that his was a
moral defeat, amounting to utter sup-
pression. He called upon the politician
at 6 P.M. to thank him personally.
Again he could get no further than the
secretary, who, learning that Hubert's
train would not depart at all that day,
regretted that the politician would, on
second thoughts, be out for a week.
“Now if I really had triumphed,”
said Hubert, “I should have got the
secretary to put that also in writing,
and should have stepped round to the
War Office again to demand a further
week's extension on the strength of
it.” This, however, he did not do.

PETHERTON'S PUBLICATIONS.
A GLANCE at a well-known pub-
lisher's window, during a recent visit
to London, provided me with material
for a little possible quiet amusement,
and with this end in view I penned the
following:—
DEAR MR. PETHERtoN, When up in
town the other day I was surprised and
delighted to notice in Messrs. Egbert
Arnwell's window two works of yours,
one on Bi-Metallism and the other on
the Differential and Integral Calculus.
Nothing but the prices (really low ones
for such works) prevented my purchas-
ing a copy of each book at once.
I cannot resist writing to congratu-
late you on the publication of these
volumes, which will, I am sure, add to
the instruction if not to the gaiety of
nations. Of course I knew—and have
had the most complete olfactory proofs
—that you were a chemist of at least
strong views, but had no idea that
your range of knowledge was so exten-
sive as it apparently is.
With renewed congratulations,
Believe me, yours sincerely,
HENRY J. Fordyce.
By the way, what is a calculus?
Could one be obtained in Surbury, or
would it be necessary to order from the
Army and Navy Stores?
This brought forth :—
SIR,--I greatly regret that my latest
publications should have caught your
eye, and look on your congratulations
as a studied insult.
I should hardly expect a person of
your (as I imagine) limited intellect to
know anything about the scientific sub-
jects which interest me, but I feel sure
that you are perfectly aware that the
calculus is abstract and not concrete.
Had you tried to convey sincere con-
gratulations to me I could have borne
the infliction with resignation, but I
strongly object to such flippant im-
pertinences as are contained in your
communication.
Faithfully yours,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
I felt this was a good start, and so
put out more bait:-
DEAR PETHERtoN (I wrote), Sorry
you couldn't accept my letter in the
spirit, etc.
I've had such a priceless idea since
I wrote to you last, and it is this. I
propose that we start a Literary Society
in Surbury. I'm certain the Vicar would
join in. Mr. Charteris, of the Manor,
too would, I feel confident, welcome
the idea. Dr. Stevenson, the only one
to whom I have broached the subject,
got keen at once, and the Gore-Langleys
and others could no doubt be counted
on—say a dozen altogether, including
you and myself. I append a short list
of suggested contributions, which will
give some idea of the range of subjects
which might be tossed into the arena
of debate:—
The Binomial Theorem in its
relation to the Body Politic
(yourself).
Cows and their sufferings during
the milk controversy in the news.
|. (Charteris. This might
be published in small quarto).
The attitude of the Manichean
Heresiarch towards the use of
Logarithms (The Vicar).
The effect of excessive Philately on
the cerebral organisms of the
young (Gore-Langley).
The introduction of the art and
practice of Napery among the
Dyaks of Borneo (Miss Eva
Gore-Langley).
With a few additions I think we
should have enough mental food to
keep us going through the summer;
and I may add that if you were put up
for President of the Society I should
certainly second the motion.
Yours ever, HARRY Fordyce.
I notice that your writing has gone
to pieces rather, old man — through
writer's cramp, I fear. You say what
looks like “you are perfectly aware
that the calcalus is asphalt and not
concrete.” Of course I do know that
much about it.
My letter kept the ball rolling all
right, for Petherton replied:—
SIR,-Have you no sane moments?
If you have any such, I should be glad
if you would employ the next lucid
interval in setting your affairs straight
and then repairing to the nearest asylum
with a request that they would protect
you against yourself by placing you in
a padded cell. This done and the key
lost, the world, and Surbury in par-
ticular, would be a happier place.
You cannot seriously suggest that
any society for literary discussion could
be formed here or elsewhere which
should include yourself, and even so
you must know that your being a mem-
ber would prevent my joining it.
Has the call for National Service not
reached your ears yet 2 You appear to
have plenty of leisure time on your
hands which might be better employed.
Or have you offered yourself and been
rejected on the grounds of mental
deficiency 2
Faithfully yours,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
I didn't feel called upon to make a
song about my method of doing my bit,
which, I am glad to say, has the ap-
proval of the authorities; but I was
anxious to hear Petherton's joints crack
once more, so I wrote:–
DEAR FREDDY, -Your letters get
better and better in style as your writing
deteriorates. I am very sorry to gather
from your last that you look coldly on
my scheme. I am sure that those to
whom I have mentioned the idea would
decline to entertain it if it lacked your
active support, so I trust you will re-
consider the matter.
I am thinking over your asylum stunt.
It would certainly save some expense,
and if this terrible War continues much
longer it will, I fear, drive me to such a
refuge; though I trust in that event that
I shall be allowed to choose pleasanter
wall hangings than those you suggest.
I'm rather fond of light chintzy papers,
aren't you? They're so cheerful.
Hoping to hear from you re our little
society at your earliest (“The Surbury
Literary and Scientific Society” would
sound well, and would look rather nice
on our note-paper—what 2)—
I am, yours as ever, HARRY.
Petherton saw red again and bellowed
at me, thus:—
SIR,- you and your beastly
society. I don't know who is the more
execrable, you or the KAISER.
Faithfully yours,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
Common decency compelled me to
reply, so I wrote:—
MY DEAR old Boy.—You don't know
how grieved I am to hear that you
cannot entertain the scheme.
Of course I can read between the
lines, and know that your heart is in it,
and that it is only the many calls on
your time which prevent your active
co-operation with me in the matter.
Of course, needless to say, your lack of
support has killed what looked like
being a promising scientific bantling
(through stress of emotion I nearly
wrote “bantam,” which brings me to
the subject of poultry. How are yours?
I forgot to ask before).
I hope the question of the S.L. & S. S.
will now be dropped; it is too painful.
If you insist on continuing the discus-
sion I shall decline to answer the letter,
so there ! Yours, H.
But Petherton refused to be drawn.
From a Church appeal:—
“A recent collection revealed that, of 179
coins put in the plate, 176 were coppers, whilst
not more than 15 people could have contri-
buted anything above one shilling.”
The person who took the twelve silver
coins by mistake will, we hope, return
them next Sunday.

THE SHERWOOD FORESTERS.
DEEP in the greenwood year by year
Bold Robin HooD, a knightly ghost,
Has eased the purse that bulged the
most
And stalked the wraiths of Rufford deer;
And, as the centuries speed away,
Has seen his oak and birk-land shrink,
Where teeming cities on its brink
Crowd in on Sherwood of to-day.
But still each year the outlaw-king,
By Normanton and Perlethorpe spire,
Has watched the beeches' emerald
fire
Flare upward in the leaping spring;
Each heather-time has found his own
Eyrie of rest where Higger Tor
Shimmers in purple as before
KING COEUR-DE-LIoN held his throne.
And Foresters away “out there,”
Sons of his sons, have surely seen
A figure clad in Lincoln green
Glide by them swiftly, thin as air;
And, yarning in the creepy dark,
Have told of arrows, cloth-yard long,
Whistling before them clean and
strong,
Of Huns that got them, pierced and
stark;
How when their line is making good,
In charge or trench, as Sherwoods
Can,
Soft-footed, ever in the van,
Stalks the bold ghost of Robin Hood.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 21st.—Mr. MACCALLUM
Scott complained that a question of
his relating to the prohibition of
“dropped scones” — which Captain
BATHURST, that encyclopædia of food-
lore, described as falling “under the
same category as the crumpet"—had
been addressed to the Ministry of Muni-
tions instead of the Ministry of Food.
It was really a venial error on the
part of the Clerk at the Table, for the
modern scone distinctly suggests a mis-
sile of offence, and is much more like a
“crump” than a crumpet. If HINDEN-
BURG were acquainted with our London
tea-shops (consule DEvoNPoRT)he would
never have imagined that his famous
phrase about “biting upon granite”
would have any terrors for the British
recruit.
When the PRIME MINISTER read from
his manuscript the proposed conditions
of the Irish Convention—how it must
include representatives not only of poli-
tical parties, but of Churches, trade
unions, commercial and educational
interests, and of Sinn Fein itself; and
must be prepared to consider every
variety of proposal that might be
brought before it—an Irish colleague
whispered to me, “Sure, the Millen-
nium will be over before we get it.”
Nothing could have been handsomer
than Mr. REDMOND's welcome to the
proposal. All he was concerned for, I
gathered, was that his Unionist oppo-
nents should be generously represented.
Ulster, in the person of Sir John LoNs-
DALE, made no corresponding advance.
He would submit the proposal to his
constituents, but not apparently with
letters commendatory.
I daresay Mr. WILLIAM O'BRIEN set
out with the honest intention of bless-
ing the Government plan, of which
indeed he claims to be the “onlie
begetter.” But the sound of his own
voice—in its higher tones painfully
provocative—stimulated him to pro-
ceed to a dramatic indictment of his
former colleagues. I felt sorry for the
prospective Chairman, charged with
the task of attempting to reconcile
these opposites.
Mr. HEALY, cowering beneath the
shelter of his ample hat, as Mr.
O'BRIEN's arms waved windmill-like
above him, must have felt like Sancho
Panza when the Don was in an extra
fitful mood; but he kept silence even
from good words.
The briefest and most helpful speech
of the afternoon came from Sir Edward
CARson, who, while declaring that he
would never desert Ulster, nevertheless
made it plain that Ulster on this occa-
sion should take her place beside the
rest of Ireland. Only Mr. GINNELL
remained obdurate. In his ears, the
º sounds “the funeral dirge
of the Home Rule Act.”

PESSIMIST'S DESIGN FOR COSTUME OF

Do not therefore jump to the hasty
and erroneous conclusion that the gal-
lant fellows and their charming com-
panions are “joy-riding;” such a thing
is unknown in Government circles.
The HoME SECRETARY moved the
second reading of the Representation
of the People Bill with a suavity be-
fitting a CAVE of Harmony; and by
the clearness of his exposition very
nearly enabled the House to understand
the mysteries of proportional represen-
tation, though even now I should not
like to have to describe off-hand the
exact working of “the single transfer-
able vote.”
The opponents of the Bill were well-
advised in selecting Colonel SANDERs as
their champion. With his jolly round
face, bronzed by the suns of Palestine,
he looks the typical agriculturalist. He
may, as he says, have forgotten in the
trenches all the old tricks of the orator's
trade, but he has learned some useful
new ones, and while delighting the
House with his sporting metaphors
struck some shrewd blows at a mea-
sure which he regards as unfair and
inopportune.
For almost the first time since the
War Lord HUGH CECIL was discovered
in quite his best form. The House
rippled with delight at his refusal to be
forcibly fed with a peptonized concoc-
tion, prepared by the SPEAKER's Con-
ference in the belief that the Mother of
Parliaments was too old and toothless
to chew her own victuals. “This Bill
is Benger's Food, and you, Sir, and
your Committee are Bengers.”
The SoLICITor-GENERAL's solid and
solemn arguments in favour of the Bill
fell a littleflat after this sparkling attack.
He should have said, “The noble Lord
reminds me, not for the first time, of
GILBERT's “Precocious Infant,' who
“Turned up his nose at his excellent pap—
“My friends, it's a tap
Dat is not worf a rap.”
(Now this was remarkably excellent pap).'"
Wednesday, May 23rd–The Russian
officers who adorned the Distinguished
Strangers' Gallery this afternoon must
be a little puzzled by the vagaries of
British politics. They had been in-
formed, no doubt, that the most urgent
problem of the day was caused by
the desire of one of the British Isles
to manage its own affairs. Yet the
first thing they heard at Westminster
was the petition of another of these
Isles—that of Man—begging release
from the burden of Home Rule and
demanding representation in the Im-
perial Parliament. Perhaps this little
incident will help our visitors to appre-
|ciate why Englishmen do not invariably
form a just judgment of events in other
countries—Russia, for instance.

Nervous Recruit (on guard for the first time). “HALT, FRIEND ! Who goes THERE!"
THE HOUSE-MASTER.
Four years I spent beneath his rule,
For three of which askance I scanned
him,
And only after leaving school
Came thoroughly to understand him;
For he was brusque in various ways
That jarred upon the modern mother,
And scouted as a silly craze
The theory of the “elder brother.”
Renowned at Cambridge as an oar
And quite distinguished as a
wrangler, -
He felt incomparably more
Pride in his exploits as an angler;
He held his fishing on the Test
Above the riches of the Speyers,
And there he lured me, as his guest,
Into the ranks of the “dry-flyers.”
He made no fetish of the cane
As owning any special virtue,
But held the discipline of pain,
When rightly earned, would never
hurt you;
With lapses of the normal brand
I think he dealt most mercifully,
But chastened with a heavy hand
The sneak, the liar and the bully.
We used to criticise his boots,
His simple tastes in food and fiction,
His everlasting homespun suits,
His leisurely old-fashioned diction;
And yet we had the saving nous
To recognise no worse disaster
Could possibly befall the House
Than the removal of its Master.
For though his voice was deep and gruff,
And rumbled like a motor-lorry,
He showed the true angelic stuff
If any one was sick or sorry;
So when pneumonia, doubly dread,
Of breath had nearly quite bereft me,
He watched three nights beside my
bed
Until the burning fever left me.
He served three Heads with equal
zeal
And equal absence of ambition;
He knew his power, and did not feel
The least desire for recognition;
But shrewd observers, who could trace
Back to their source results far-
reaching,
Saw the true Genius of the Place
Embodied in his life and teaching.
The War's deep waters o'er him rolled
As he beheld Young England giving
Life prodigally, while the old
Lived on without the cause for
living;
And yet he never heaved a sigh
Although his heart was inly riven;
He only craved one boon—to die

EMILY'S MISSION.
It was all through Emily that I am

We were extraordinarily lucky to get
her; there was no doubt about that.

Her testimonials or character or refer-
ences or whatever it is that they come
to you with were just the last word.
Even the head of the registry-office,
a frigid thin-lipped lady of some fifty
winters, with an unemotional cold-
mutton eye, was betrayed, in speaking
of Emily, into a momentary lapse from
the studied English of her normal voca-
bulary.
“Madam,” she said to my wife, “I
“Very well,” I said.
On the morrow I started for my
annual holiday, alone. It was late
summer. I journeyed into the wilds
of Wiltshire. I took two rooms in an
isolated cottage, and on the first night
of my stay, before getting into bed, I
threw my looking-glass out of the
window. Next morning I began. Day
by day I tramped the surrounding
country, avoiding all intercourse with
humanity, and day by day my beard
grew.
I could feel it growing, and the first
scrubbiness of it filled me with rage.
But as time slipped by it became softer
and more pliable, and ceased to irritate
glorious brown, with golden lights here
and there where the sunbeams danced
in some lighter cluster of its curling
strands. A beard that a king might
Wear.
I have never shaved again. Every
morning now, while untold millions of
my suffering fellows are groaning be-
neath their razors, I steal an extra
fifteen minutes from the day and lie
and laugh inside my beard.
“And what of Emily 2” you ask.
Almost immediately after my return
she left us. She gave no reason. She
was not unhappy, she said. She wished
to make a change, that was all. To
this day my wife cannot account for

never one like this. She is, I assure
you, Madam, absolutely IT."
o we engaged her; and ere long
I came to hate her with a hatred
such as I trust I shall never again
cherish for any human being.
In almost every respect she
proved perfection. She was honest,
she was quick, she was clean; she
loved darning my socks and iron-
ing my handkerchiefs; she never
sulked, she never smashed, her hair .
never wisped (a thing I loathe in
housemaids). In one point only
she failed, failed more completely
than any servant I have ever
known. She would not make my
shaving-water really hot.
Cursed by nature with an iron-
filings beard and a delicate tender
skin, I was a man for whom it was
impossible to shave with comfort

I sprang from my bed to find the
contents of my jug just a little over
or under the tepid mark. There was

no question of re-heating the water
on the gas stove, for I never allowed
myself more than the very minimum
of time for dressing, swallowing my
breakfast and catching my train. It
was torture.
I spoke to Emily about it, mildly at
first, more forcibly as the weeks wore
on, passionately at last. She apologised,
she sighed, she wrung her hands. Once
she wept—shed hot scalding tears, tears
I could gladly have shaved in had they
fallen half-an-hour earlier. But it made
no difference; next morning my water
was as chill as ever. I could not under-
stand it. Every day my wrath grew
blacker, my reproaches more vehement.
Finally an hour came when I said to
my wife, “One of two things must
happen. Either that girl goes or Igrow
a beard.”
Mildred shook her head. “We can't
possibly part with her. We should
never get another servant like her.”
me. Freed, too, from the agony of
shaving, I soon found myself eating my
breakfast in a more equable frame of
mind than I had enjoyed for years. I
began also to notice in my walks all
sorts of things that had not struck me
at first—the lark a-twitter in the blue,
the good smell of wet earth after rain,
the pale gold of ripening wheat. And
at last, before ever I saw it, very
gradually I came to love my beard, to
love the warm comfort and cosiness of
it, and to wonder half timidly what it
looked like.
When I left, just before my departure
for the six-miles-distant station, I called
for a looking-glass. They brought me
a piece of the one I had cast away. It
was very small, but it served my pur-
pose. I gazed and heaved a sigh of
rapturous content, a sigh that came
from my very heart. My beard was
short and thick, its colour a deep

her departure. But I know why
she went. Emily was a patriot
with a purpose. A month after she
parted from us I received a letter
from her:—
\| "DEAR SIR,-May I ask you to
take into consideration the fact
A that by having ceased to shave you
will in future be effecting a slight
economy in your daily expenditure?
|Might I also suggest to you that
during the remainder of the War
| | you should make a voluntary con-
tribution to the national exchequer
of every shilling saved under this
head 2 The total sum will not
be large, but everything counts.
Yours is, if I may be allowed to
say so, the finest beard I have
been instrumental in producing
during my two and a half years'
experience in domestic service. I
am now hard at work on my sixth
case, which is approaching its
crlsl S.
Apologising for any temporary
inconvenience I may have caused
you, I am, Yours faithfully,

Foundress and President of the
Housemaids’ Society for the
Promotion of Patriotic Beards.
I never showed the letter to my wife,
but I have acted on Emily's suggestion.
I often think of her still, her whole soul
afire with her patriotic mission, flitting,
the very flower of housemaids, from
home to home, lingering but a little
while in each, in each content for that
little while to be loathed and stormed
at by an exasperated shaver, whom
she transforms into a happy bearded
contributor to her fund.
Another Impending Apology.
“This terrible fire roused hundreds of people
from their beds, and a great crowd gathered
in the adjoining streets; but Sub-divisional
Inspector Stock and Inspector Ping were on
the spot within a few months after receiving
the call.”—Westminster and Pimlico News.

THE FIETEEN TRIDGES.
ONCE upon a time there was a flour-
ishing covey of fifteen: Pa Tridge, Ma
Tridge, and thirteen little Tridges, all
brown and speckled and very chirpy.
They had been born in a hollow under
some big leaves beside a hedge, and
they now moved about the earth, push-
ing their way through the grass, all
keeping close together when they could,
and setting up no end of a piping when
they couldn't and thought they were
lost.
It was a large family from our point
of view, and larger perhaps than a pru-
dent French partridge would approve,
but the world is wide, and there are no
butcher's or baker's or tailor's or dress-
maker's bills to pay for little birds. All
that a Pa and Ma Tridge have to do
after fledging is complete is to look
out for cats and hawks and foxes, to
beware of the feet of clumsy cattle, and
to administer correction and advice.
Above all there are no school bills,
made so doubly ridiculous among our-
selves by German measles and other
epidemics during which no learning is
imparted, but for which, education-
alists being a wily crew, no rebate is
offered.
There being so little to be done for
their young, it is no wonder, in al
didactic and over-articulate world, that
parent Tridges take almost too kindly
to sententiousness; and young Tridges,
being so numerous as to constitute a
public meeting in themselves, are speci-
ally liable to admonishment.
It was therefore that, strolling aim-
lessly amid the herbage or the young
wheat with their audience all about
them, Pa and Ma Tridge got into a
habit of counsel which threatened to
become so chronic that there was a
danger of its dulling their sensibility to
the approach of September the first.
“Never,” Pa Tridge would say, “criti-
cise anyone or anything on hearsay.
See for yourself and then make up
your own mind; but don't hurry to
put it into words.”
“Tell the truth as often as possible,”
Pa Tridge would say. “It is not only
better citizenship to do so, but it makes
things easier for yourself in the long
run.”
“Always bear in mind,” Ma Tridge
would say, “that after one has married
one's cook she ceases to cook.”
“Never tellanyone,” Pa Tridge would
say, “who it was you saw in the spinney
with Mr. Jay or Mrs. Woodpecker.”
“Indeed,” he would add, “you might
make a note that the world would not
come to a miserable end if everyone
was born dumb"—but he was very
glad not to be dumb himself.
“Even though you should get on
intimate terms with a pheasant,” Ma
Tridge would say, “don't brag about it.”
“Forgive, but don't forget,” Pa Tridge
would say.
“Remember,” Pa Tridge would say,
“that, though it may be wiser to say
No, most of the fun and all the adven-
ture of the world have come from saying
Yes.”
“Bear in mind,” Ma Tridge would
say—but that is more than enough of
the tiresome old bores.
And after each piece of advice the
little Tridges would all say, “Right-O!”
And then one night—these being
English Tridges in an English early
summer—a terrible frost set in which
lasted long enough to kill the whole
covey, partly by cold and partly by
starvation, so that all the good counsels
were wasted.
But on the chance that one or two of
them may be applicable to human life
I have jotted them down here. One
never knows which is grain and which
chaff until afterwards.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WE have had many studies of the War, in various aspects,
from our own army. Now in My 75 (HEINEMANN) there
comes a record of the impressions of a French gunner
during the first year of fighting. It is a book of which I
should find it difficult to speak too highly. PAUL LINTIER,
the writer, had, it is clear, a gift for recording things seen
with quite unusual sharpness of effect. His word-pictures
of the mobilisation, the departure for the Front, and the
fighting from the Marne to the Aisne (where he was wounded
and sent home) carry one along with a suspense and interest
and quite personal emotion that are a tribute to their
artistry. His death (the short preface tells us that, having
returned to the Front, he was killed in action in March, 1916)
has certainly robbed France of one who should have made
a notable figure in her literature. The style, very distinc-
tive, shows poetic feeling and a rare and beautiful tenderness
of thought, mingled with an acceptance of the brutality of
life and war that is
seen in the vivid de-
scriptions of incidents
that our own gentler
writers would have left
untold. The horror of
some of these passages
makes the book (I
should warn you) not
one for shaken nerves.
But there can be no
question of its very un-
usual interest, nor of
the skill with which its
translator, who should
surely be acknowledged
upon the title-page, has
preserved the vitality
and appeal of the
original.
The author of Helen
of Four Gates (JENKINs)
has chosen to hide her | * * * - - -
identity and call herself simply “An Ex-Mill Girl.” I
am sufficiently sorry for this to hope that, if the story
meets with the success that I should certainly predict
for it, a lady of such unusual gifts may allow us to know
her name. Of these gifts I have no doubt whatever. As a
tale Helen of Four Gates is crude, unnatural, melodramatic;
but the power (brutality, if you prefer) of its telling takes
away the critical breath. Whether in real life anyone could
have nursed a lifelong hatred as old Mason did (personally
I cherish the belief that hatred is too evanescent an emotion
for a life-tenancy of the human mind; but I may be wrong);
whether he would have bribed a casual tramp to marry and
torment the reputed daughter who was the object of his
loathing, or whether Day and Helen herself would actually
so have played into his hands, are all rather questionable
problems. Far more real, human and moving is the wild
passion of Helen for Martin, whom (again questionably as
to truth) her enemies frighten away from her. A grim
story, you begin to observe, but one altogether worth reading.
To compare things small (as yet) with great, I might call
it a lineal descendant of Wuthering Heights, both in setting
and treatment. There is indeed more than a hint of the
BRONTÉ touch about the Ex-Mill Girl. For that and other
things I send her (whoever she is) my felicitations and good
wishes.

I wonder if Mr. (or Mrs. or Miss) R. K. WEEKEs would
understand me if I put my verdict upon The Massareen
Affair (ARNOLD) into the form of a suggestion that in future
its author would be well advised to keep quiet, Not with
any meaning that he or she should desist from the pursuit
of fiction; on the contrary, there are aspects of The
Massareen Affair that are more than promising—vigorous
and unconventional characters, a gift of lively talk, and so
on. But all this only operates so long as the tale remains
in the calm waters of the ordinary; later, when it puts
forth upon the sea of melodrama, I am sorry to record that
this promising vessel comes as near shipwreck as makes no
difference. To drop metaphor, the group of persons sur-
rounding the unhappily - wedded Anthony Massareen—
Claudia, who attempts to rescue him and his two boys,
the boys themselves, and the clerical family whose fortunes
are affected by their proximity to the Massareens—all these
are well and credibly drawn. But when we arrive at the
fanatic wife of Anthony, in her Welsh castle, surrounded by
rocks and blow-holes, and finally to that last great scene,

twice it is even possible to imagine that the author, after
taking pen in hand, was a little perplexed to find a subject
to write about. But that is the beginning and the end
of my complaint. Once again we have a broad-minded
humour and the revelation of a most attractive personality.
Above all we see our Grand Fleet as it is ; and, if the
grumblers would only read and soundly digest what our
Chaplain has to say their question would be, “What is our
Navy not doing?”
“The sight was wonderful. From the grand lodge entrance to the
lake-side quite 3,000 blue-breeched khaki-coated men and nurses lined
one side of the long drive.”—Manchester Evening News.
It must indeed have been a wonderful sight. Neverthe-
less we hope that nurses generally will stick to their
traditional uniform.

LITTLE WILLIE'S OPINION OF FATHER.
[“How long the conflict may last lies in God's hand; it is not our
business to ask questions about it. . . . It is not the Prussian way to
praise oneself. . . . It is now a matter of holding out, however long
it lasts.”—Ertract from Speech by the Kaiser, delivered near Arras.]
I FEAR that Father's lost his nerve.
As I peruse his last oration
I seem to miss the good old verve,
The tone of lofty exaltation,
The swelling note of triumph (Sieg)
That often carried half a league.
The drum on whose resounding hide
He brought to bear such weight and gristle
Has now been scrapped and laid aside
In favour of the penny whistle,
On which he plays so very small
You hardly hear the thing at all.
No more we mark the clarion shout—
“Go where the winds of victory whirl you !”
His eagle organ, petering out,
Whines like a sick and muted curlew ;
A plaintive dirge supplants the pºean
That used to rock the empyrean.
Poor Father must have changed a lot.
He had a habit (now he's shed it)
Of patronising “Unser Gott,”
And going shares in all the credit;
To-day he wears a humbler air,
And leaves to Heaven the whole affair.
He's modified his sanguine view
About the foes he meant to batter;
He talks no more of barging through;
He frankly owns it's just a matter
Of hanging on and sitting tight,
Possibly through the Ewigkeit.
“I never speak in boastful vein;
No Prussian does,” he tells the Army.
It really looks as if his brain
Is going “gugga," which is barmy;
He 's done some talking through his hat,
But never quite such tosh as that.
How to correct the sad decline
Which takes this form of futile prattle?
That pious feat might yet be mine
If I could only win a battle;
Cases are known of mental crocks
Restored by sharp and staggering shocks.
HOT WEATHER CORRESPONDENCE.
(In the manner of various contemporaries.)
ANIMAL LABour.
Corelli Parade, Stratford-on-Avon.
DEAR SIR,--I seem to have read somewhere of the
extreme sagacity and intelligence shown by the baboons
of South Africa, some of whorn, as well as I remember, are
employed as porters and, I think, station-masters on the
railways in the interior of Cape Colony. My gardener
and coachman having both been called up, it has occurred
to me that I might find efficient substitutes for them in
these excellent animals.
Perhaps you or some of your readers would kindly inform
me what it would cost to import two trustworthy baboons,
also what would be a fair wage to give them; whether they
would come under the provisions of the National Insurance
Act, and whether they are vegetarians or carnivorous?
Any other information bearing on their tastes and habits
would be gratefully received by
Yours faithfully, (MRs.) AMANDA BLEEK.
[You should communicate with the Director of the
Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park. We believe that
baboons can be booked at special rates. Possibly they
might be allowed to work their passage over as stokers?
As regards wages, payment in kind is generally preferred
to money. The baboon is a vegetarian but no bigot, and
will eat mutton chops without protest. The great American
nature historian, WARD, tells us that we should not give
the elephant tobacco, but lays no embargo on its being
offered to baboons. They are addicted to spirituous
liquors, and on the whole it is best to get them to take
the pledge. A valued correspondent of ours, Canon
Phibbs, once had a tame gorilla which invariably accom-
panied Mrs. Phibbs at Penny Readings; but this interesting
animal died suddenly from a surfeit of mushrooms, and
Canon Phibbs has also joined the majority.—ED. Daily
Swallow.]
PooDLEs on THE LAND.
Kimono Cottage, Camberley.
DEAR SIR,-Poodles have from time immemorial been
employed to hunt for and dig out truffles in France. May
I suggest to all owners of dogs of this highly intelligent
breed that they should use them (1) for digging in gardens
and allotments; (2) in place of caddies on golf links? May
I add that poodles ought not to be shaved with a safety-
razor, but should be trimmed by a topiary expert 2
I am, Sir,
Yours faithfully, MAISIE MIMRAM.
[We are most grateful to our correspondent for her
information and the humane suggestion with which it is
coupled. Truffle-hunting is indeed a noble sport.
ED. Daily Scoop.]
“KILL THAT FLY.”
Limejuice Villa, Leighton Buzzard.
DEAR SIR,-As a dead set is being made against dogs
by some uncompromising food economists, may I point
out on behalf of our four-footed friends what admirable
service they render the community by the destruction of
flies? My Irish terrier, Patsy, spends half his time catch-
ing blue-bottles—indeed, my husband, who is of a mathe-
matical turn, estimates that he accounts for several hundreds
every day. Faithfully yours, WERAx.
[Patsy has indeed deserved well of the commonwealth.
Some official recognition is clearly called for, preferably
a special collar—unstarched, of course—recording his
services.—ED. Weekly Simpleton.]

How To PROVIDE FOR Ponis.
Mazawattee Mansions, Matlock.
DEAR SIR,--I have had since 1912 a Pomeranian dog
of good pedigree. Wishing to give him a chance, I changed
his name from Fritz to Jock, but he refuses to answer to
the new title. As it is impossible to deport him to his
native land, I think of presenting him to a German Prisoners'
Camp in the neighbourhood, but before doing so should be
glad of your advice. Yours anxiously, Puzzled.
[The problem is a difficult one, but we see no reason for
vetoing our correspondent's generous proposal. The posi-
tion of neutral dogs is also puzzling. Only the other day we
heard of a Great Dane who could not be taught to “die for
the King”—doubtless on conscientious grounds. The feel-
ings of the mites in a Dutch cheese, again, ought to be
considered.—ED. Conscience.]

For myself I have another plan.
There is a certain historic wood up

the War I am going to float a company,
purchase that wood and turn it into a

of tourists.
There will be an entrance fee of ten
francs, and everything else will be extra.
Tea in the dug-out — ten francs.
Trips through trenches, accompanied
by trained guides reciting selected
passages from the outpourings of our
special correspondents — ten francs.
At night grand S.O.S. rocket and Very
light display—ten francs. While for
a further twenty francs the tourist

souvenirs in the way of rolls of barbed
wire, dud bombs and blind crumps as
he can stagger away with. By this

Meeting my groom one evening I
spoke of the matter to him, casually
mentioning that there was a small
countryman of ours close at hand break-

any rabbit. I clearly explained to my
groom that I was suggesting nothing,
dropping no hints, but I thought it a
pity such a sportsman should waste his
talents with those sea - soldiers when
there were outfits like ours about, offer-
ing all kinds of opportunities to one of
the right sort. I again repeated that I
was making no suggestions and passed
on to some other subject.

making our customary bi-weekly trek
next day, I discovered the small terrier

had insisted on coming with us there
was nothing further to be said, so we
christened him “The O'Murphy,” at-
tached him to the strength for rations
and discipline, and for two years he has
shared our joys and sorrows, our billets
and bully-beef, up and down the land of
Somewheres.
But it was with our Albert Edward
he got particularly chummy. They had
the same dislike of felines and the same
taste in biscuits. Thus when Albert
Edward rode by, ears drooping, tail
tucked in (so to speak), en route to the
shambles, The O'Murphy saw clearly
that here was the time to prove his
friendship, and trotted along behind.
On arriving at H.Q. the comrades shook
paws and licked each other good-bye.
Then Albert Edward stumbled within
and The O'Murphy hung about out-
side saucing the brass-collared Staff
dogs and waiting to gather up what
fragments remained of his chum's
body after the General had done with
it. His interview with the General
our Albert Edward prefers not to de-
scribe; it was too painful, too humiliat-
ing, he says. That a man of the
General's high position, advanced age
and venerable appearance could lose
his self-control to such a degree was a
terrible revelation to Albert Edward.
“Let us draw a veil over that episode,”
he said.
But what happened later on he did
consent to tell us. When the General
had burst all his blood vessels, and
Albert Edward was congratulating him-
self that the worst was over, the old man
suddenly grabbed a Manual of Military
Law off his desk, hurled it into a corner
and dived under a table, whence issued
scuffling sounds, grunts and squeals.
“See that?” came the voice of the Gen-
eral from under the table. “Of all con-
founded impudence!—did you seethat?”
Albert Edward made noises in the
negative. “A rat, by golly!” boomed
the venerable warrior, “big as a calf,
came out of his hole and stood staring
at me. Damn his impudence 1 I cut off
his retreat with the manual and he's
somewhere about here now. Flank
him, will you?”
As Albert Edward moved to a flank
there came sounds of another violent
scuffle under the table, followed by a
glad whoop from the General, who
emerged rumpled but triumphant.
“Up-ended the waste-paper basket
on him,” he panted, dusting his knees
with a handkerchief. “And now, me
lad, what now, eh?”
“Fetch a dog, Sir,” answered Albert
Edward, mindful of his friend The
O'Murphy. The General sneered, “Dog

the old-fashioned cat? I’ve got a plain
tabby with me that has written standard
works on ratting.” He lifted up his
voice and bawled to his orderly to bring

years, melad,” he continued; “brought
it from home--carry it round with me
everywhere; and I don't have any rat

founded feller?”
He strode to the door and flung it
open, admitting, not an orderly but The

him and trotted across the room, tail
twinkling, love-light shining in his eyes,
and deposited at Albert Edward's feet
his offering, a large dead tabby cat.

NOT WISELY BUT TOO WELL.
CHAPTER I.
“I wish you would speak to Cook
yourself about it,” said my wife rather
nervously. “The whole thing depends
upon her, and everyone says the chief
ºlº is to get one's servants into
ine.”
“It seems hardly my department,”
said I. -
“No,” my wife admitted, “but I
believe it would impress her. She is
not in the least impressed by me.”
I saw at once I should have to do it;
you can't run away from a thing like
that without impairing your position
as the head of the house. But I
dreaded it. I have always been afraid
of her, and I knew that if she began to
argue I should be expected to take
what my wife calls a firm line, and
that is always most uncomfortable. I
wanted to have her up to my study, so
that I should have the moral support
of encyclopædias and things that she
doesn't understand; but my wife was
convinced that I ought to mark the im-
portance of the occasion by presenting
myself in the kitchen. I hadn't been
down that stair for months and months.
All this happened weeks ago, when the
DEvoNPoRT rations were proposed. . . .
I took my stand with my back to the
fire, conscious of a listening kitchen-
maid behind the scullery door, and after
asking if the range continued to give
satisfaction I opened on the general
question of submarines. But Cook
had the better of me there. I had
forgotten that she has a son on a sub-
marine. I spoke of the serious position
of the country, and Cook cheerfully
assented. (For her part she often said
to Jane that we were goin' 'eadlong into
trouble.) I spoke, in general terms, of
economy, and found we were in com-
plete agreement. (“Only last night I
says to Jane, ‘Waste not, want not '
must be our motter.") Then I an-
nounced the amount of the DEvoNPoRT
rations and repeated them twice mcst
impressively. Cook appeared to be
going through a number of swift pro-
fessional calculations. (“Six times four
is twenty-four, and six times two-and-
three-quarters is—m—m—m—m—
carry one—is sixteen and a-half, but
syrup might do for the batter.”) Well,
Sir, she would try. She would keep
a book, “and every hounce that came
into this house—be it rabbit or be it
liver—shall be put down.”
I was so pleased with her attitude
that I allowed myself to be carried
away rather, and we agreed before the
conference ended that we would try to
improve upon Lord DEvoNPoRT if it
was possible. Cook, as I left her,
impressed me as an heroic figure, facing
a grim future with a high heart.
“You did it beautifully, dear,” said
my wife as I came out. She also had
been listening behind the other door.
CHAPTER II.
Weeks passed. My only desire was
to dismiss the whole question from my
mind. Like LLoyd GEORGE in the
House of Commons I had appeared
and made my statement, and I was
content to leave the whole matter to
my wife. I do not mean to say that I
did not observe sundry innovations in
the food supply. Funny-looking scones
came up that tasted rather of pea-soup;
some of the meat dishes had a sort of
padded-out aspect, and it was difficult
to get quite away from oat-meal. But
I had no cause to complain. It is only
in the last ten days that the situation
has become grave. Barer and barer is
the board. I have even had to make
suggestions. I proposed that bacon,
for instance, might be allowed to re-
appear on Sundays. Very well, said
my wife patiently, she would see
what she could do. I wondered if
buttered toast had been finally ban-
ished for the Duration. She hoped
not. But I gave up that policy, for I
found that whenever I recovered some
such fugitive from our table some-
thing else was certain to disappear.
My eyes were opened to it at last. I
saw that the establishment was going
rapidly downhill. And I could get no
real satisfaction from my wife. She
would make vague promises of reform;
she would undertake to do her best;
and she would begin to talk brightly
about something else.
And then I wanted to ask the Harri-
sons to lunch. That brought on the
crisis, for I formulated a minimum
demand of a leg of mutton or a pair
of fowls.
“I don't see how it's possible,
dear,” said my wife. “I am so
sorry.”
“You are keeping something back
from me,” said I. “Tell me, whose is
the “Hidden Hand” that is running
this blockade 2"
“It's Cook.”
“Oh, Cook.”
“Yes, ever since you gave her that
awful slanging about patriotism she
has been grinding me down more
and more. She's always plotting
and scheming and telling me that
she must keep the book down for the
good of the country. I can see that
Jane isn't getting sufficient nourish-
ment. If I were to propose a pair
of fowls for lunch I know that she
would say it was her duty to remind
me that we were a beleaguered city.
And yet I don't want to discourage
her. . . .”
“That's very awkward,” said I.
“What in the world are we to do
about the Harrisons 2 "
“I know,” said my wife suddenly.
“Ask them on Saturday. Cook's go-
ing to Plymouth for the week-end to
see her son.”
“Oh, good,” said I.
have a blow-out.”
“And we won't put it down in the
book.”
“No, not a hounce of it.”
So that is what we are going to do
about the Harrisons. But it doesn't
touch the larger question. Our prob-
lem, you will see, is very different
from that of other people, and my wife
smiles a pale wan smile when she
hears her friends endlessly discussing
ways and means of keeping within
Lord DEvoNPoRT's rations. What we
want is to discover a means of getting
back to that lavish and generous stan-
dard of living. BIs.

I NEVER countenanced the Hun in any sort of way—
He always does what isn't done and won't learn how to

But never have I felt estranged quite as I do to-day.
Till now I've strated him like the rest, as natural and
right,
But now my spirit is obsessed by bitter private spite;
And if he wants to know the cause—no mail came up
to-night.
The sun must plod his weary course, the long night wax

To-day's strong rumours lose their force for others as

The ration cart crawl up once more before we hope again.
Who is to blame what man can guess? I do not want to
know,
The U-Boats or the Q.M.S., the Censor or the snow—
It cannot modify the fact that warps my nature so.
Although I may not vent my spleen upon the stricken
Mess, -
Where fancies of what might have been add gall to bitter
neSS,
I mean to cause some sentient thing confusion and distress.
And who so handy as the Hun ? I know what I will do,
I will prevent to-morrow's sun with avid zeal and new,
Betaking me to some O. Pip that gives a charming view;
Each Teuton nose that dares to lift above the tunnelled
ground
Shall be saluted with its swift and dedicated round,
Till all the burrows of the Bosch with panic shall
resound.
And by this wrath it shall be known when there is like

Till far beyond my trembling zone pale Hun to Hun shall
say,

WHO SHALL DECIDE 2
(An echo of the Romney cause célèbre.)
IN view of the attacks on their hon-
ourable calling by Sir Thomas JACKSON
and others, in The Times and elsewhere,
the Art critics of London called a public
meeting to consolidate their position.
The Chair was taken by Sir WILLIAM
RichMond, who was supported by Mr.
HUMPHRY WARD, Mr. A. S. TreMPLE,
and numerous other gentlemen who
know a Romney when they see it, or
who earn an honest livelihood by dis-
tributing adjectives, good or bad, among
painters.
| Sir WILLIAM RICHMOND, referring to
a recent lawsuit, said that it was mon-
strous that careful conclusions based
upon a long life of study should be
upset by the production of a pencil
sketch, and he called for the removal
of Mr. Justice DARLING from the Bench.
Art criticism was not a mere matter of
caprice, as people were now pretending,
but an exact science. If a qualified
man, not only a theorist but a practical
craftsman, after years of preparation,
stated that a picture was by such and
such a painter, it was by him. The
mere fact that someone named OziAs
HUMPHRY had made a small sketch
resembling a large oil painting proved
nothing. (Loud cheers.) The speaker
|said that he was glad to hear those
sounds. But he would go further. The
conclusion of the recent case was de-
scribed as dramatic. He had a far
more dramatic possibility up his sleeve.
Suppose it should be discovered—as it
might be, nothing being impossible—
suppose it should be discovered that
RoMNEY chose to paint some of his
pictures under the pseudonym of OziAs
HUMPHRY. What then? (Terrific sen-
sation.) They had all heard of the
SHAKSPEARE-BAcon controversy. The
RoMNEY-HUMPHRY controversy might
be destined to eclipse that. (Profound
excitement.) He, the speaker, person-
ally was not prepared to let the matter
rest where it did. His honour as an
Art critic was at stake.
An even greater sensation was caused
at this juncture by a rush of cold air
in the hall, followed by the appearance
of a ghostly shape, which announced
itself to be the shade of Oz.I.As HUM-
PHRY himself. If anyone doubted his
identity or suggested that he did not
paint his own pictures he should take
very prompt action indeed. The art
of haunting was by no means extinct.
(Here the Chairman hurriedly left the
room.) The shade, continuing, caused
some consternation by stating that the
picture which had led to litigation the
other day was by no means the only
supposed Romney that he had painted.
He could name several in collections
within a mile or two of the spot where
he was then standing. (At this point
Mr. HUMPHRY WARD swooned and was
carried out by Mr. Roberts.)
Mr. A. S. TEMPLE remarked that no
doubt the shade of OziAs HUMPHRY
attended that meeting in all good faith,
but for his part he thought that he
would have shown better taste had he
kept away. In fact everyone would be
happier if OziAs HUMPHRY had never
existed. It was not Art critics that
should be pitched into, but painters
whose styles resembled each other.
They were the real nuisance. It was
the duty of artists to be distinctive, and
it was the duty of Art critics to keep
them so. No doubt, as SHAKSPEARE
knew, there was a certain humour to be
extracted from men who were exactly
alike, such as the two Dromios, but
when painters painted alike there was
no fun in it at all.
Mr. John SMITH testified to the fact
that he had no interest in a picture
unless he knew who painted it; and

even then he was not interested unless
the name of the painter was a familiar
one. If Art critics provided these names,
it was obviously desirable that their
services should be retained; but it was
confusing if the Art critics disagreed
among themselves. All he asked was
that when they thus disagreed they
should all equally fix on well-known
names, even though they were different
ones. Names such as REYNoLDs,
GAINSBoRough, LEADER and GoFTzE
were well known and inspired confi-
dence. Strange names merely irri-
tated. In visiting the Royal Academy,
for example, he personally always
bought a catalogue and confined his
attention to the pictures of the more
famous artists. In this way he ensured
a pleasant afternoon. If there was still
any doubt as to the merit of a picture,
he inquired the price and was guided
by the size of that.
Sir FREDERICK WEDMoRE said that
to decry the value of Art criticism was
absurd. It was only through the efforts
of their literary henchmen that some
painters could be known at all. The
better the picture the more words ought
to be written about it, at so much a
word. It was impossible to over-esti-
mate the importance of fitting every
brush-mark with the adequate epithet.
He himself had devoted a long life to
this task and he intended to continue
doing so. (Loud cheers.)
The Editors of the Sketch and Tatler,
speaking in unison, said that not only
was there too much talk about pic-
tures, but there were far too many
pictures. Artists ought not to be en-
couraged in the way they are. The
world was never so happy as in the
interval between the loss of the
“Monna Lisa" and its recovery. We
should apply our enthusiasm to the
stage—to actors and, above all, to
actresses.
The Editors of The Daily Mirror and
The Daily Sketch, also speaking in uni-
son, said they agreed to a large extent
with the last speakers. It would not
really matter if every painting disap-
peared, so long as the camera remained.
One living photographer was better
than a thousand dead Masters.
Sir CLAUDE PHILLIPs asked how the
Masters would ever have been called
Masters had it not been for the critics.
Painters merely painted and left it
there ; it was the critics who decided
whether or not they should be immortal,
and whether their pictures should be
worth tens or thousands.
Mr. MARION SPIELMANN said that no
one would deny that the contemplation
of pictures, even those of Saints or
Holy Families, had given enormous
pleasure. But why? Not because the

crowds that flocked to the galleries
really cared for them, but because gifted
writers had for centuries been setting
up hypnotic suggestions that in this
way was pleasure to be obtained. He
had often seen men and women stand-
ing before a canvas of REMBRANDT,
hating the grubby muddle of it in their
hearts, but adoring it in their heads—
all because some well-known critic had
told them to. Their pleasure, however,
was real, and therefore it should, in a
world of sadness, be encouraged, and
consequently Art critics should be en-
couraged.
Mr. Roger FRY here rose to point
out that the test of a picture is not the
pleasure which it imparts, as the last
speaker seemed to think, but the pain.
The sooner the public got that fact into
its thick head the better would it be for
those artists who were not so clay-
souled as to allow stuffy conventions to
interfere with the development of their
personality.
Mr. D. W. GRIFFITH said that he had
never heard so much talk about pictures,
with so little reference to himself. It
was he who invented “The Birth of a
Nation " and “Intolerance,” and he
was the Picture King, and as such he
wished to tell them that the best Art
critic in the world couldn't hold a
candle to a very ordinary Press agent.
(Uproar, during which the meeting
broke up.)

MEDITATIONS OF MARCUs O'REILLY.
THE GREAT DoG FIGHT.
NExt to the beauty of its girls my
little Western home is noted for two
things—the ferocity of its dogs and its
bountiful provision for assuaging an
attack of thirst. For the latter there
are fifteen houses, ten of which have
licences and the rest back-doors. We
are by birth a temperate people, but
there is much salt in the air.
Our dogs are very like ourselves, as
peaceable and well-conducted as can be,
except when some rascal takes up their
challenge and makes faces at them or
trails a tail of too much pretension and
too suddenly in their neighbourhood.
Then the fur is apt to fly.
“What a degrading spectacle a dog-
fight is 1" Moriarty, who takes up the
collection in church and has thus a
will be only one dog in the Ballybun
census.” I had my doubts, as I know
the local dog, which would have the
hide off an elephant if it barked. But
Billy O'Brien is a stranger, or as we sa
“transplanter” in our part of Ireland,
his grandfather being the first of his
branch to transplant himself here, and
he did not then know much about the
higher education of dog, though he is
an admirable inspector of schools.
But he thought he did, and he had
an educational theory which was all
his own. He claimed that a dog is
what he eats, and he simply spent
pounds on that dog's education. In a
month or two Elixir, which was the
dog's name, could swallow curries with-
out winking which would bring tears to
the eyes of an Oriental Potentate, and
he would howl if he was given water
without Worcester Sauce.
semi-ecclesiastical status in life,
which shows itself in his speech,
said this to me only last evening.
There were about a hundred of
us trying to hide this degrad-
ing spectacle from the police
and other innocent people, and
Moriarty had just lost three-
and-sixpence on Casey's dog.
“A degrading spectacle indeed,”
said I. “If Casey's dog had
held out two minutes longer he
had the other dog beat. I am
disappointed in Casey's dog.”
It was degrading, and I am glad.
I had only half-a-crown on it.
So I paid up to our collector of
rates and taxes and came home.
This little incident made me
think of Billy O'Brien, our next-
door neighbour. Billy had one

mal at his heels to show me Mulligan's
letter and discuss his wrongs, before
he went round to talk dog with the
writer. His shortest way to Mulligan's
was through my back-yard. Elixir,
without anybody's permission, at once
|started to break his way through in
order to tell Mulligan's dog to his face
what he thought of him. He had
hardly set a paw in it when an infuri-
ated ball of fur lit somewhere out of
space on to his back, cursing and
spitting and tearing the hair out in
slathers. This new enemy was my
wife's tortoise-shell kitten Emmeline,
whose existence I had for the moment
forgotten, but who owns that backyard
and whose permission had not been
asked.
What was left of Elixir let a yell out
of it like a foghorn and bolted. It
returned twenty-four hours later with
its tail between its legs, a con-
vinced pacifist. The disgusted

; name to Bertrand Russell, after

and gave it to a tinker.
O’Brien has abandoned
theories about dogs and is now
trying to encourage hygiene in
our midst, and Mulligan is sleep-
ing better than ever.

Billy said life wasn't worth living if
he could not walk in the streets with-
out some neighbour's dog beating his.
Billy had failed hitherto, and this is not
surprising to one who knows the dogs
of Ballybun. They are Irish terriers
to a dog, and all of them living in-
stances of the doctrine of the survival
of the fittest. The air of Ballybun is
bad for a dog with a weak chest who
thinks he has a strong one. Billy
experimented with many breeds and
had many glimpses of success, but a
Ballybun dog always put an end to his
experiments.
Last year Billy thought he had
achieved his aim at last. When he re-

with him a powerful dog of unknown
breed and of the most colossal ugliness.

or else it was only his dog's liver that was
wrong, for very soon Elixir would keep
us up half the night shouting offensive
epithets across our-wall at Mulligan's

Mulligan, who is a light sleeper, was
much annoyed, and wrote O'Brien eight
pages about it. He mentioned that he
was a member of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and
that it was positive cruelty to keep
these two animals separated a moment
longer than was absolutely necessary.
He said that his conscientious objec-
tions to betting were well known and
life-long, but that even they would not
stand in the way of his wife's putting a
fiver on their dog Stanislaus. He added
a few remarks about O'Brien's grand-
father, the “transplanter”; but what
annoyed the owner of Elixir most was
Mulligan's remark that he had not seen
the dog, but heard it was some new
kind of German pug.

APPROPRIATOR OF TUBERS.
At a time when not a potato was to
be found in all Kensington, the Food
Controller decided to form the Potato
Appropriations Department. I was put
at its head and received my orders direct
from that supreme official.
Up to the moment of being called
upon to take up this important post I
was a Captain on the Staff of an Artil-
..lery Headquarters, and my ignorance of
the finer points of the potato was pro-
found. It was therefore with sometrepi-
dation that I proceeded to hold a lengthy
consultation with the Controller on
the subject of the organisation and
general duties of my department. My
official title, I was told, was Appro-
priator of Tubers. … I was further in-
formed that, until the department got
into the swing of routine, it had better
work under the direct supervision of
the Food Controller. I agreed.
I was then taken into the Con-
troller's confidence with regard to a
certain matter, and it was suggested
| that I should see to it. .
I demurred on the ground that I did
not yet feel myself a sufficient authority
on the potato to carry out this parti-
cular duty; but the Controller over-
came my objection by sending for a
Mrs. Marrow, an expert on the Potato
Utilisation Board. She appeared, a
plump middle-aged lady, attired appro-
priately in a costume of workmanlike
simplicity. .
Thus reinforced, I ordered the car
and drove to Whitechapel. At the end
of a street whose gutters were full of
vegetable garbage I stopped, and, de-
scending, beckoned imperiously to an
adjacent policeman. .
“On duty for the Food Controller,
constable,” I said. “Take me to the
nearest greengrocer, please.” -
He saluted respectfully and led the
way to where a long queue, armed with
a varied assortment of baskets and bags,
waited impatiently and clamoured. A
hush fell on our approach. Two more
policemen who now appeared on the
scene constituted themselves my re-
tinue. Through a lane opened in the
throng I made a stately entrance, Mrs.
Marrow and the police bringing up the
rear. I was confronted by a large
flabby individual, who grasped a cab-
bage in one hand and a number of
mangel-wurzels in the other. -
“Good morning, Sir," I remarked
courteously but firmly. “You are the
proprietor of this shop, I presume 2"
His reply left no room for doubt.
“I am the A.T.," I said impressively,
indicating the red brassard of office
presented to me by the Food Con-
troller. “In case you do not know.what
that means, I am the Appropriator
of Tubers. A tuber, Sir, is a potato.
Now it has been brought to the notice
of my chief, the Food Controller, that
certain vendors of vegetables are seek-
ing to defraud the public by selling as
potatoes a totally different kind of vege-
table disguised with colouring matter
and rubbed with earth.”
I paused to allow this weighty an-
nouncement to sink in. My audience
gaped. I continued— -
“Acting on orders received from the
Controller I am making a series of
surprise inspections with a view to dis-
covering the guilty parties, who will be
proceeded/against under section A, sub-
section 2, paragraph 1,769 of Part III.
of King's Regs.-I mean, the Defence
of the Realm Act. I particularly wish
you to understand,” I went on ruth-
lessly, nipping an indignant protest in
the bud, “that I do not for a moment
allege, suggest or insinuate that you
specifically are one of these potato-
swindlers; nevertheless I have my
duty to do, and I must ask you here
and now to lay out your entire stock
for inspection.” - .
The flabby individual wiped his fore.
head and signed to a trembling assist-
ant. - -
“Get 'em art,” he said. “Fer Gawd's
sake, get 'em art 1" -
Six bushel baskets of the precious
vegetables were brought and laid in a
row at my feet. -
“Perhaps, Madam,” I said, turning
to Mrs. Marrow, “you will be so kind
as to inspect these—ah, tubers. Mrs.
Marrow,” I explained to the green-
grocer, “the famous tuber expert.”
In silence Mrs. Marrow began to over-
haul the contents of the baskets, every
now and then picking out a particularly
choice specimen, which she added to an
accumulating pile on the floor.
“Aha! Suspects " I exclaimed
grimly. “I shall take all these to the
laboratory at the Food Controller's
Headquarters, where Mrs. Marrow will
submit each tuber to a meticulous test
in order to satisfy herself as to its bona
fides. You will be gratified to hear
that, should your potatoes prove to
be all they seem, the Controller will
issue you a blue card, registering you
as a certified vendor of Government-
tested potatoes. This you may place
in your window for the information of
your customers. If the test proves
unsatisfactory" — I paused. In the
deathly silence the heavy breathing of
Mrs. Marrow was distinctly audible
“you will hear further,” I concluded.
“Weigh these suspects.”
They turned the scale at eighteen
pounds.
“Since in any case the potatoes will
be rendered unfit for consumption by
the rigorous process through which
they will be passed, I am empowered
by the Food Controller to compen-
sate you in advance, at a rate not ex-
ceeding sevenpence per pound, out of
the special appropriation funds, this
sum to be returned in the event of the
test proving unsatisfactory.”
So saying I handed him ten-and-
sixpence. The basket was carried out
to the car by one of the guardians of
law and order. Then I headed for
Kensington.
The Food Controller met us breath-
lessly at the door.
“Oh, what darlings!” she exclaimed.
“Do you think they will last out the
master's leave?”
“They've jolly well got to,” declared
the master promptly. “There are
limits, Elsie, to the elasticity of con-
science. Besides, my ability to main-
tain a flow of official phraseology is
exhausted.” -
The Food Controller kissed me very
sweetly. It was cheap at ten-and-
sixpence.

And yet there's more in them than

At least, one reason for this revolution
Is plain; the keyboard, though its
tones are cold,
Viewed as a means of rapid “execution”
Endears itself to Turks both Young
and Old.

HEXAMETERS.
I HAVE been examining a book by the PoET LAUREATE, in
which that learned and painstaking man puts forward for
general acceptance a new theory and a new practice of
metre in English poetry. It seems that our verse is
accentual, whereas it ought to be quantitative—or it may
be the other way about ; my brain is in such a whirl with
it all that I can't be certain which is right, but I am sure
that one of them is, and so I leave you to take your choice.
Failing that, you can buy Dr. BRIDGEs' book, which is
entitled Ibant Obscuri (Oxford University Press), and
thus expresses my inmost convictions about our great
official poet and his followers. We are henceforth to
write hexameters in English on an entirely new plan, of
which the result is that they lose all likeness to any hexa-
meters previously encountered on the slopes of Parnassus
or anywhere else and become something so blind and
staggering and dreadfully amorphous that the whole mind
of the reader rises up in revolt against them.
That, at any rate, is my condition at this moment after
going through a course of them. I notice that the reviewers
have been a little shy of these hexametric efforts. They
have mostly described them as “interesting experiments”
and have applauded Dr. BRIDGEs for his adventurous
main question whether these hexameters are a success or
a failure. Now I have no hesitation whatever in admitting
my metrical ignorance and at the same time in denounc-
ing as a fiasco the experiment of Dr. BRIDGES. I have
spent some time in struggling with his hexameters; I
have attempted to track his dactyls to their lair; I have
followed up what I took to be his spondees, and I am
thankful to say that I have managed to survive.
Let me now give some examples, not composed, it is
true, by the LAUREATE, but by myself. This is not an
unfair proceeding, for it will serve to show the effect of
Ibant Obscuri on a mind not too obtuse. I promise that
the rules shall be observed. There shall be six feet in
each line, dactyls or spondees, and the fifth foot shall be a
dactyl and the sixth a spondee or a trochee. Are you
ready? Go!
Apollo now came forth his course through the sky to fulfil;
In other words it was morning and most people got out of bed;
And fathers of families munched and grumbled at their break-
fasts,
Denouncing their bacon and not to be mollified with their
Coffee or tea, as the case might be, and the housewives reproved
them,
Saying 'twas impossible to control them with such an example.
-
Beyond the above I cannot go, but I must add that the
industry and his careful scholarship, and thereafter they
have skirmished on the outskirts and have, shown a dis-
inclination to come to grips with the LAUREATE on the
|
|
lines are of the most perfect metrical lucidity and the
purest melody when compared with some written by the
LAUREATE in Ibant Obscuri.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. H. G. WELLs also among the New Theologians is
not an entirely unexpected event. We have all had inti-
mation in his later writings of the coming of some such
thesis as God, The Invisible King (CASSELL). I can see
the deans making mincemeat of the rash author. All's
well if they'll eat some of the meat. And they may. At
least this is no super-subtle modernist divine dealing out
old coins surreptitiously stamped with a new image and
superscription, but a plain blunt heretic who knows his
mind (or, rather, mood). But it is a reverent, indeed, I
dare to say, a noble book. The sanely and securely
orthodox may read it with profit if with shock. It should
brace their faith, and will rob them of nothing but a too-
ready doubt that so forthright a house-breaker may be a
builder in his own way. There is indeed more faith in
these honest denials than in half the assents of the con-
formists. Just because it is not a subtle book it should
not be “dangerous.” It is romantic, rather; inspired, you
might loosely say. The Inder Expurgatorius will of course
because the author possesses a wonderfully delicate gift of
satire and a power of character delineation that never gets
out of hand, she has written a novel deserving of more praise
than the usual reviewer, all too timid of superlatives, may
venture to give. Comparisons in criticism are dangerous,
but Miss STERN's philosophy strongly calls to mind BUTLER's
The Way of All Flesh. At least there is the same mordant
and rather hopeless analysis of the power for evil in a too
complicated world of impeccable people with no sense of
humour. And in Dermod’s case the effect is heightened by
the feeling that if he had really been the irresponsible
creature he was suspected of being he would have come
much nearer to controlling his own destinies. He sowed
a decent regard for his obligations, and reaped a perfect
whirlwind of well-to-do respectability. Grand Chain is a
really remarkable novel, and no discriminating reader will
overlook it.
Was it not Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER who used to sing
some hortatory lyrics upon the inadvisability of intro-
ducing your donah to a pal? Something of this sort,
mutatis mutandis in the matter of sex, might stand
list it when they learn
of it ; but foolishly,
because while the
philosophy, the cos-
mology, the meta-
physics may be ad-
vanced (so advanced |\º
as to be called hasty
and apt to run into
the theological bar-
rages), the religion,
the mysticism, the
“conviction of sin,”
the vision of the in-
visibles, the percep-
tion of the imponder-
ables, are positive,
vivid, sincere, passion-
ate in phrasing and in
intention. Sincere as
Mr. WELLs is º - -
sincere; sincere rather than stable, patient, learned and so
forth. I rather wonder that he insists so much on his finite
God. The postulate hardly touches his real thesis. And I
find it easier to believe that there may be some things behind
“this round world” that Mr. WELLs cannot fully understand
because he (the author) is finite—and busy—than accept
what seems a contradiction in terms to no particular end.

The author of Grand Chain (NISBET) is profoundly aware
that man is not the master of his fate (though he may be
the captain of his soul, which is quite a different matter),
and that the claim so universally put forward, that the
leopard can change his spots, is simply an excuse for
criticising the superficial pigmentation of other leopards.
Dermod Randall, Miss G. B. STERN's hero, is certainly not
the master of his fate, which is inexorably moulded by the
belief of his relatives, ascendant and descendant, that he
must inherit the vices of his father, a particularly pard-like
specimen, and may be expected at any minute to come out
in spots himself. As a matter of fact his only failings
were a young heart and a sense of humour; but, as these
qualities were as out of place in the Randall family as a
hornpipe at a funeral, Dermod lives under a perpetual cloud
of unmerited suspicion. How he is compressed into a life
groove, of which an ineffably turgid respectability provides
the chronic atmosphere, is the theme of Grand Chain. And

entirely satisfactory, save from the view-point of Miss

touching instance of filial piety. Springing to the rescue

that Dick had married her for the money of whose exist-

A SHORT WAY WITH SUBMARINES.
“A short way with submarines?”
said Bill; “oh, yes, we've got one all
right; but,” he added regretfully, “I
don't know as I’m at liberty to tell
you. Wot I'm thinkin’ about is this
'ere Defence o' the Realm Act—see?
Why, there was a feller I knew got ten
days' cells for just tellin' a young wo-
man where 'er sweet'eart's ship was.”
It was the last day of Bill's “leaf,”
of which he had spent the greater part
warding off the attacks of old acquaint-
ances bent upon º out something
interesting about the Navy. Of course
during his absence Bill had written
home regularly, but his letters had
been models of discretion and confined
to matters of the strictest personal
interest. Since his return quite a
number of temporary coldnesses had
arisen as a result of his obstinate reti-
cence, and the retired station-master,
after several attacks both in front and
flank had ignominiously failed, flew
into a rage and said he didn't believe
there was any Navy left to tell about,
the Germans having sunk it all at the
Battle of Jutland. -
Bill said they might 'ave done, he
really didn't know, not to be certain.
But now, with his bundle handker-
chief beside him, just having another
drink on his way to the station, Bill
really seemed to be relenting a little.
The customers of the “Malt House”
all leaned forward attentively to listen.
“It's all among friends, Bill,” said
the landlord encouragingly, “it won't
go no further, you can rest easy about
that.”
“I’ve 'eard tell as it's this 'ere
Mr. Macaroni,” began the baker, who
took in a twopenny paper every day,
and gave himself well-informed airs in
consequence.
“If you'd ever been properly eddi-
cated,” said Bill, wiping his mouth on
the back of his hand, “you'd know as
the best discoveries 'ave been made by
haccident, same as when the feller in-
vented the steam-engine along of an
apple tumblin' on 'is 'ead. That's 'ow
it is with this 'ere submarine business,
an' no macaroni about it an' no cheese
neither.
“Sailormen gets a deal o' presents
sent 'em nowadays, rangin' from wrist-
watches an' cottage-pianners to woolly
'ug-me-tights in double sennit. But
the best present we ever 'ad—well, I'll
tell you.
“An old lady as was aunt or god-
mother or something o' the sort to our
Navigatin' Lootenant sent him a pre-
sent of an extra large tin of peppermint
'umbugs. Real 'ot uns, they was, and
big—well, I believe you! I've 'ad a deal
o' peppermints in my time, but this
'ere consignment from the Navigator's
great-aunt fairly put the lid on. You'd
ha’ thought all 'ands was requirin'
dental treatment the day the Navigator
shared 'em out, an' when the steersman
come off duty, 'e give the course to the
feller relievin' the wheel as if 'e'd got
an 'ot potato in 'is mouth.
“Well, the peppermints was in full
blast an' the ship smellin' like a bloom-
in’ sweet factory when the look-out
reported a submarine on our port bow.
O' course we was all cleared for haction,
an' beginnin' to feel our Iron Crosses
burnin' 'oles in our jumpers, when we
begun to see as there was something
funny about 'er. . . . - - -
“Naturally we was lookin' for 'er
to submerge—but not shel There she
sat, waitin' for us, an’ all 'er crew was
pushin' an' fightin' to get their 'eads
out of 'er conning tower. We was right
on top of 'er in two twos, and all as we
'ad to do was to pick up the officers and
crew as if they was a lot o' wasps as
'ad been drinkin' beer, an' tow the sub-
marine—which was in fust-rate goin'
order, not a month out o' Kiel dockyard
—'ome to a port as I'm not at liberty
to mention.”
“But 'ow 2 " began the baker.
“I thought as I'd made it middlin'
plain,” said Bill severely, “but seein'
as some folks wants winders lettin'
into their 'eads I suppose I'd better
make it plainer. I daresay you've
'eard as they're very short o' sweet-
stuff in Germany.”
“I’ave,” said the baker triumphantly,
“I read it in my paper.”
“Well,” said Bill, “there was a wind
settin' good and strong from us towards
the submarine, an' when one of 'em as
'appened to be takin' the air at the time
got a sniff of us 'e just couldn't leave
off sniffin'. Then 'e passed the word
down to the others, an' the hodour of
the peppermints was that powerful it
knocked 'em all of a 'eap, the same as
food on an empty stummick. See?
That's the real reason o' the sugar
shortage. There's 'arf-a-dozen factories
workin’ night an' day on Admiralty
contracts, turnin' out nothin' at all
only peppermint 'umbugs.
“Simple, ain't it?” Bill concluded,
as he paid for his beer and reached for
his bundle. “Anyway, it does as well
as anything else to tell a lot o' folks as
can't let a decent sailorman spend 'is
bit o' leaf in peace an' quietness with-
out tryin' to get to know what 'e's got
no business to tell 'em nor them to find

“NEveR let your husband have a
grievance,” said Madame Marcot, stir-
ring the lump of sugar that she had
brought with her to put into her cup of
tea. “It destroys the happiness of the
most admirable households. Have you
heard of the distressing case of the
de Blanchets—Victor de Blanchet and
his wife?”
We had not.
“Very dear friends of mine,” said
Madame Marcot vivaciously, delighted
at the chance of an uninterrupted
innings, “and belonging to a family
of the most distinguished. They were
a truly devoted couple, and had never
been apart during the whole of their
married life. As for him, he was an
excellent fellow. If he had a fault, it
was only that perhaps he was a little
near ; but still, a good fault, is it not ?
When he was called to the Front his
wife was desolated, simply desolated.
And then, poor M. de Blanchet—not
the figure for a soldier—of a rotundity,
Mesdames ' '.' And Madame Marcot
lifted her eyes heavenwards, struck
speechless for a moment at the thought
of M. de Blanchet's outline. “How-
ever, like all good Frenchmen, he made
no fuss, but went off to do his duty.
He wrote to his wife every day, and
she wrote to him.
“All at once his letters ceased, and
then, after a long delay, came the
official notice, ‘Missing.' Imagine the
suspense, the anxiety' For weeks she
continued to hope against hope, but at
last she heard that his body had been
found. It had been recognised by the
clothes, the identity disc (or whatever
you call it), and the stoutness, for, alas,
the unfortunate gentleman's head had
been nearly blown away by a shell
and was quite unrecognisable. Poor
Madame de Blanchet's grief was ter-
rible to witness when they brought her
his sad clothing, with the embroidered
initials upon it worked by her own
hand. One thing she insisted on, and
that was that his body should be buried
at A , in the family vault of the
de Blanchets, who, as I have said
before, are very distinguished people.
“This meant endless red tape, as you
may imagine, and endless correspond-
ence with the authorities, and delays
and vexations, but finally she got her
wish, and the funeral was the most
magnificent ever witnessed in that part
of the world. You should have seen

alluding to the black-bordered mourn-
ing intimations sent out in France,
inscribed with the names of every

cerned, from the greatest down to

“Several pages, I assure you; and
everybody came. The cortège was a
mile long. M. l'Abbé Colaix officiated;
there was a full choral mass; and she
got her second cousin once removed,
M. Aristide Gérant, who, as you know,
is Director of the College of Music at
A , to compose a requiem specially
for the occasion; and he did not do it for
nothing, you may believe me. In fine,
a first-class funeral. But, as she said,
when some of her near relations, in-
cluding her stepmother, who is
not of the most generous, re-
monstrated with her on the score
of the expense, ‘I would wish
to honour my dear husband in
death as I honoured him in life.’
“After it was all over she had
a magnificent marble monument
erected over the tomb, record-
ing all his virtues, and with a
bas-relief of herself (a very in-
accurate representation, I am
told, as it gave her a Madonna-
like appearance to which she
can lay no claim in real life)

phagus.”
Madame Marcot paused for

finished, we drifted in with ap-
propriate comments. But we
were soon cut short.

continued the lady dramatically,

“What—her husband?” cried
everybody.
“The same,” answered
Madame Marcot. “He was a
spectacle. He had lost an arm;
his clothing was in tatters, and
he was as thin as a skeleton.
But it was Monsieur de Blanchet
all the same.”
“What had happened?” we shrieked
in chorus.
“What has happened more than once
in the course of this War. He had been
taken prisoner, had been unable to com-
municate, and at last, after many mar-
vellous adventures, had succeeded in
escaping.”

in order, no doubt, to get into our lines
and play the spy. Happily a shell
put an end to his activities; but by
the grossest piece of ill-luck it made
him completely unrecognisable, so that
Madame de Blanchet, as well as the
officers who identified him, were natur-
ally led into the mistake of thinking
him a good Frenchman, fallen in the
exercise of his duty.”

sion, and the marble monument, his
wrath was such that in pre-war days,
and before he had undergone the reduc-
ing influence of the German hunger-
diet, he would certainly have had an
apoplectic seizure. To a man of his
economical turn of mind it was natur-
ally enraging. But the thing that put
the climax on his exasperation was
the bas-relief of his wife, ridiculously
svelte,’ as he remarked, shedding tears
over the ashes of a wretched Boche.
“The situation for him and for the
family generally,” concluded
Madame Marcot, “is, as you
will readily conceive, one of
extreme unpleasantness and
delicacy. The cost of exhuming
the Hun, after the really out.
rageous expense of his inter-
ment, is one that a thrifty man
like M. de Blanchet must natur-
ally shrink from ; indeed he
assures me that his pocket sim-
ply does not permit of it.
“In the meantime he can never
go to lay a wreath upon the
tombs of his sainted father and
mother, or pass through the

Our Canadian contemporary,
Jack Canuck, publishes a pro-
test against the invasion of
Canada by British temperance
reformers, whom it describes
“The corpse in M. de Blan-
cot, “and touching was the joy of M.
de Blanchet too, until he observed her
mourning. He was then inclined to be
slightly hurt at her taking his death
so readily for granted. However, she
soon explained the case; but, when he
heard that a nameless member of the
unspeakable race was occupying the
place in the family vault that he had
been reserving for himself for years
past at considerable cost, he became ex-
ceedingly annoyed; and when, through
the medium of his relations, he learned
of the first-class funeral, and of the
oak coffin studded with silver, and the
expensive full choral mass, and the
prisoner, uniform, badges, disc and all, requiem specially written for the occa-
as “uplifters.” Immediately
below this protest it produces a picture

and dived more than a mile directly at them.

in the fusselage as the pilot put the machine

While confessing ignorance as to the
exact nature of a “live,” we are sure it
is not as steep as the rest of the story.

“WHAT DID You Do IN THE GREAT WAR, GRANDPA 2"
THE PERSONAL EOUATION.
Time 1940.
“WHAT DID I Do, My LAD? I HELPED TO RELIEVE MAFERING."
THE MUSINGS OF MARCUS MULL.
(In the manner of an illustrious Mentor.)
I.
I NoTED in last week's issue the per-
sistence of the strange story that Mr.
GLADston E, in his wrath at his reduced
majority in Midlothian, broke chairs
when the news arrived. I was careful
to add that, as the result of searching
investigation, I was in a position to
state that Mr. GLADSTONE never did
any such thing. Still I cannot alto-
gether regret having alluded to the
story in view of the interesting letters
on the subject which have reached
me from a number of esteemed cor-
respondents.
II.
As an eminent Dundonian divine,
who wishes to remain anonymous, re-
marks, it is a melancholy fact that men
of genius have often been prone to
violent ebullitions of temper. He re-
calls the sad case of MILTON, who,
while he was dictating his Areopagitica,
threw an ink-horn at his daughter, “to
the complete denigration of her habili-
ments,” as he himself described it. Yet
MILTON was a man of high character
and replete with moral uplift. I re-
member that my old master, Professor
Cawker of Aberdeen, once told me that
as a child he was liable to fits of freak-
ishness, in one of which he secreted
himself under the table during a dinner-
party at his father's house and sewed
the dresses of the ladies together. The
result, when they rose to leave the
room, was disastrous in the extreme.
But Professor Cawker, as I need hardly
remind my readers, was a genial and
noble-hearted man. I presented him
on his marriage with a set of garnet
studs. Ever after when I dined at his
house he wore them. Nothing was
ever said between us, but we both knew,
and I shall never forget.
III.
My old friend, Lemmens Porter,
whose name I deeply regret not to
have read in the Honours List, reminds
me of the painful story of Swinburne,
who, in a fit of temper, hurled two
poached eggs at GEoRGE MEREDITH
for speaking disrespectfully of Victor
HUgo. The incident is suppressed in
Mr. GossE's tactful life, but Mr. Porter
had it direct from MEREDITH, whose
bath-chair he frequently pulled at Dork.
ing. Swinburn E was, I regret to say,
pagan in his views, but, unlike some We congratulate our contemporary on
pagans, he was incapable of adhering
to the golden mean. ARISTOTLE, I feel

certain, would never have condescended
to the use of such a missile, and it is
beyond “imagination's widest stretch "
to picture, say, the late Dr. Joseph
Cook, of Boston, the present Lord
ABERDEEN, or the Rev. Dr. Donald
McGuffin acting in such a wild and
tempestuous manner.
IV.
Still we must admit the existence of
high temper even in men of high souls,
high aims and high achievements.
Everyone may improve his temper.
We cannot all emulate the patience of
JoB, but we can at least set before us
the noble example of Professor Cawker,
of his youth by the mellow and mollify.

if Mr. GLADSTONE did break chairs, we
should not lightly condemn him. You
cannot make omelettes without break-

taliate. MARCUs MULL.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BALLADE OF INCIPIENT LUNAGY.
Scene.—A Battalion “Orderly” Room
in France during a period of “Rest.”
Runners arrive breathlessly from all
directions bearing illegible chits, and
tear off in the same directions with
illegible answers or no answer at all.
Motor-bicycles snort up to the door
and arrogant despatch-riders enter with
enormous envelopes containing leagues
of correspondence, orders, minutes, cir-
culars, maps, signals, lists, schedules,
summaries and all sorts. The tables
are stacked with papers; the floor is
littered with papers; papers fly through
the air. Two type-writers click with
maddening insistence in one corner.
A signaller buzzes tenaciously at the
telephone, talking in a strange lan-
guage apparently to himself, as he
never seems to be connected with any-
one else. A stream of miscellaneous
persons—quarter-masters, chaplains,
generals, batmen, D.A.D.O.S.'s, ser-
geant - majors, staff - officers, buglers,
Maires, officers just arriving, officers
just going away, gas experts, bomb-
ing experts, interpreters, doctors —
drifts in, wastes time, and drifts out
again.
Clerks scribble ceaselessly, rolls and
nominal rolls, nominal lists and lists.
By the time they have finished one list
it is long out-of-date. Then they start
the next. Everything happens at the
same time; nobody has time to finish
a sentence. Only a military mind, with
a very limited descriptive vocabulary
and a chronic habit of self-deception,
would call the place orderly.
The Adjutant speaks, hoarsely ; while
he speaks he writes about something
quite different. In the middle of each
sentence his pipe goes out; at the end
of each sentence he lights a match. He
may or may not light his pipe; anyhow
he speaks:–
“Where is that list of Wesleyans I
made 2
And what are all those people on the
stair 2
Is that my pencil 2 Well, they can't
be paid. -
Tell the Marines we have no forms

tions were,
And how attractive it must be to slay.

I think I must be going mad to-day.”
THE MUD LARKS.
IF there is one man in France whom
I do not envy it is the G.H.Q. Weather
Prophet. I can picture the unfortunate
wizard sitting in his bureau, gazing
into a crystal, Old Moore's Almanack
in one hand, a piece of seaweed in the
other, trying to guess what tricks the
weather will be up to next.
For there is nothing this climate
cannot do. As a quick-change artist
it stands sanspareil (French) and nulli
secundus (Latin).
And now it seems to have mislaid
the Spring altogether. Summer has
come at one stride. Yesterday the
staff-cars smothered one with mud as
they whirled past; to-day they choke
one with dust. Yesterday the authori-
ties were issuing precautions against
frostbite; to-day they are issuing pre-
cautions against Sunstroke. Neverthe-
less we are not complaining. It will
take a lot of sunshine to kill us; we
like it, and we don't mind saying so.
The B.E.F. has cast from it its mitts
and jerkins and whale-oil, emerged from
its subterranean burrows into the open,
and in every wood a mushroom town
of bivouacs has sprung up over-night.
Here and there amateur gardeners
have planted flower-beds before their
tents; one of my corporals is nursing
some radishes in an ammunition-box
and talks crop prospects by the hour.
My troop-sergeant found two palm-
plants in the ruins of a chateau glass-
house, and now has them standing
sentry at his bivouac entrance. He
sits between them after evening stables,
smoking his pipe and fancying him-
self back in Zanzibar; he expects the
coker-nuts along about August, he tells
line.
Summer has come, and on every
slope graze herds of winter-worn gun-
horses and transport mules. The new
grass has gone to the heads of the
latter and they make continuous ex-
hibitions of themselves, gambolling
about like ungainly lambkins and roar-
ing with unholy laughter. Summer
has come, and my groom and country-
man has started to whistle again, sure
sign that Winter is over, for it is only
during the Summer that he reconciles
himself to the War. War, he admits,
serves very well as a light gentlemanly
diversion for the idle months, but with
the first yellow leaf he grows restless
and hints indirectly that both ourselves
and the horses would be much better
employed in the really serious business
of showing the little foxes some sport
back in our own green isle. “That
Paddy,” says he, slapping the bay
with a hay wisp, “he wishes he was
back in the county Kildare, he does
so, the dear knows. Pegeen, too,
if she would be hearin' the houn's
shoutin' out on her from the kennels
beyond in Jigginstown she'd dhrop
down dead wid the pleasure wid'in
her, an’ that's the thrue word,” says
he, presenting the chestnut lady with
a grimy army biscuit. “Och musha,
the poor foolish cratures,” he says and
sighs.
However, Summer has arrived, and
by the sound of his cheery whistle
at early stables shrilling “Flannigan's
Wedding,” I understand that the horses
are settling down once more and we
can proceed with the battle.
If my groom and countryman is not
an advocate of war as a winter sport
our Mr. MacTavish, on the other hand,
is of the directly opposite opinion.
“War,” he murmured dreamily to me
yesterday as we lay on our backs be-
neath a spreading parasol of apple-
blossom and watched our troop-horses
making pigs of themselves in the young
clover—“war ! don't mention the word
to me. Maidenhead, Canader, cushions,
cigarettes, only girl in the world doing
all the heavy paddle-work—that's the
game in the good ole summertime.
Call round again about October and
I'll attend to your old war.” It is for-
tunate that these gentlemen do not
adorn any higher positions than those
of private soldier and second-lieutenant,
else, between them, they would stop
the War altogether and we should all
be out of jobs. PATLANDER.

PICCADILLY.
GAY shops, stately palaces, bustle and breeze,
The whirring of wheels and the murmur of trees;
By night or by day, whether noisy or stilly,
Whatever my mood is—I love Piccadilly.
Thus carolled FRED Locker, just sixty years back,
In a year ('57) when the outlook was black,
And even to-day the war-weariest Willie
Recovers his spirits in dear Piccadilly.
We haven't the belles with their Gainsborough hats,
Or the Regency bucks with their wondrous cravats,
But now that the weather no longer is chilly
There's much to enchant us in New Piccadilly.
As I sit in my club and partake of my “ration ”
No longer I'm vexed by the follies of fashion;
The dandified Johnnies so precious and silly—
You seek them in vain in the New Piccadilly.
The men are alert and upstanding and fit,
They've most of them done or they're doing their bit;
With the eye of a hawk and the stride of a gillie
They add a new lustre to Old Piccadilly.
And the crippled but gay-hearted heroes in blue
Are a far finer product than wicked “old Q,”
Who ought to have lived in a prison on skilly
Instead of a palace in mid Piccadilly.
The women are splendid, so quiet and strong,
As with resolute purpose they hurry along—
Excepting the flappers, who chatter as shrilly
As parrots let loose to distract Piccadilly.
Thus I muse as I watch with a reverent eye
The New Generation sweep steadily by,
And judge him an ass or a born Silly Billy
Who'd barter the New for the Old Piccadilly.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, June 5th.-In listless and
dejected mood the House of Commons
reassembled after its all-too-brief recess.
Memberscollectively missed their MARK,
for Colonel Lockwood, the only popular
Food Controller in history, had been
summoned upstairs and left the
Kitchen Committee to its fate.
The shower of Privy Councillor-
ships, baronetcies and knight-
hoods which had simultaneously
descended upon the faithful Com-
mons afforded little compensa-
tion for this irreparable loss; and
even the sight of the ATToRNEY -
GENERAL's immaculate spats ap->
pearing over the edge of the
Table was insufficient to dispel
the prevailing gloom.
Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING made
a gallant effort to galvanize his
colleagues into life. Remember-
ing that it was an air-raid that
got him into the House —some
people will never forgive the Ger-
mans for this—he seldom allows
a similar incident to pass without
endeavouring to improve the oc-
casion. As his policy of “two
bombs to one" failed to intrigue
Mr. BoNAR LAw he sought to
move the adjournment, but when
the Question was put only five Mem-
bers, instead of the necessary forty, rose
in its support.
If Sir H. DALZIEL has his way, and
the consumer is allowed to purchase
his sugar unrefined, the British break-
fast will become a most exciting meal.
Lice, beetles and, on one occasion, a live
lizard have been found in the bags
arriving from Cuba. Even with meat
at its present price, Captain BATHURST
doubts whether such additions to our
dietary would be really welcome.
In the pre-historic times before
August, 1914, the PostMASTER-GENERAL
was wont to give on the Vote for his
department a long and discursive ac-
count of its multifarious activities, and
to enliven the figures with anecdotes
and even with jokes. Mr. ILLINGworth
knows a better way. With deliberate
monotony he reeled off his statistics to
a steadily diminishing audience. Only
once did he evoke a sign of animation.
He has abolished the absurd rule that
| the person presenting a five-pound note
at a post-office should be required to
endorse it ; and, in defending this
momentous change, he remarked that
he himself had endorsed many such
notes, “but never with my own name.”
For a moment Members were startled
by this cynical admission of something
which seemed to their half-awakened
intelligence very like a confession of
forgery. But the PostMASTER GENERAL
soon put them to sleep again, and by
nine o'clock had got his vote safely
through.
Wednesday, June 6th.-Nothing short
of a revolution, it was supposed, would
cause Whitehall to empty its precious
pigeon-holes, in which so many millions

of pious aspirations and abortive com-
plaints sleep their last sleep. But the
War has penetrated even here, and
Mr. BALDw1N was able to announce,
with a cheerfulness that some of the
older officials probably regard as almost
indecent, that already a vast quantity
of material has gone to the pulping-
mill.
Mr. WINstox ChurchILL (with eye on the
Air Board). “ANY UNIFORM suits ME, THANK
YOU...”
In the course of the debate on the
Representation of the People Bill, Sir
FREDERICK BANBURY explained that
he resigned his membership of the
GPEAKER's Conference because he found
that he and his party were expected to
give up everything and to get nothing
in return. If so the Liberals on the
Conference were very short-
sighted, for a little concession
then would have saved them a
lot of trouble now. What Sir
FREDERICK does not know about
the art of Parliamentary obstruc-
tion is not worth knowing, and
he evidently means to use his
knowledge for all it is worth.
\ He even succeeded — a rare tri-
umph—in drafting an instruction
to the Committee which passed
the SPEAKER's scrutiny and took
a good hour to debate. In vain
Sir GEORGE CAVE and Mr. LoNG
reminded the House that it had
already approved the main prin-
ciples of the Bill. You can't ride
a cock-horse when BANBURY's
Cl’OSS.
Another old hand at the game
is Lord HUGH CECIL. His par-
ticular grievance against the Bill
is, I fancy, that it alters the
character of his constituency,
and, should it pass, will oblige
him to appeal for the votes of callow
young Bachelors with horrid Radical
notions instead of being able to re-
pose in confidence upon the support
of a solid phalanx of clerical M.A.'s.
He possesses also an hereditary anti-
pathy to extensions of the franchise.
Lord CLAUD HAMILTON must have
thought himself back in 1867, listening
to Lord CRANBoRNE attacking the Re-
form Bill where with DIzzy dished the
Whigs. Lord HUGH, like his father, is
a master of gibes and flouts and jeers,
and used most of the weapons from a
well-stocked armoury in an endeavour
to drill a fatal hole in the Bill.
At one moment he chaffed the
HoME SECRETARY for seeking to turn
the House into a Trappist monastery,
where Ministers alone might talk and
Members must obey; at the next he was
reminding the House, on a proposal to
raise the age of voters, that a great
many of the persons who took part in
the massacre of St. Bartholomew were
under twenty-two years of age. But
though Members listened and laughed
they refused, for the most part, to vote
with him. The Bill came almost un-
scathed through the first day of its
ordeal in Committee.
Thursday, June 7th-If all the hun-
dred and sixty-eight Questions on the
Order Paper had been fully answered

Several of the most searching inquiries

Rations and came to an untimely end.)
Private Tom Whidden had a passion
For eating of his iron ration—
A thing, you know, which isn't done
(Except, just now and then, for fun),
Because there is a rule about it
And decent people rarely flout it.
But Tom was greedy and each day
He'd put a tin or two away,
Though duty told him, clear and plain,
To keep them safe as brewers' grain,
For eating as a last resort
When eatables were running short.
His Corporal said, “My lad, don't do
it l”
His Sergeant groaned, “I’m sure you'll
rue it !” -
But still he never stopped. At last
His Captain heard and stood aghast . . .
Then he said sternly, “Private Whidden,
Really, you know, this is forbidden.
Some day, Sir, if you will devour
Your ration thus from hour to hour,
You'll find yourself in No Man's Land
With neither bite nor sup at hand.
Yes, when it is your proper fare,
Your iron ration won't be there;
Then in your hour of bitter need
You will be sorry for your greed.”
He ceased. Dut Private Thomas
Whidden,
Being thus seriously chidden,
Said simply (with a Devon burr),
“Law bless us! do 'ee zay zo, Zur 2"
Then with an uncontrolléd passion
He went and ate his iron ration.
So, since he chose, from day to-day,
Persistently to disobey,
As you'd expect, the man is dead,
Though not the way his Captain said.
The fate of starving out of hand,
Or nearly so, in No Man's Land—
Alas! it never came in question.
He died of chronic indigestion.

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
British Officer (interrupting carousal in Bosch dug-out). “TIME, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE ' "
THE GOD-MAKERS.
THE financial success of Mr. H. G.
WELLs' punctuality and enterprise in
looking into the vexed question of the
Deity, even in war time, has had the
usual effect, and many literary men
are feverishly pursuing similar studies.
In due course some of these will no
doubt take practical shape. Mean-
while it has seemed desirable for a
Punch man to make a few inquiries
among our leading philosophers and
readers of the future with regard to
the same engrossing topic. For Eng-
land will ever be the wonder and des-
pair of other nations in its capacity,
no matter with what seriousness its
hands are filled, for pursuing contro-
versial distractions.
To run Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT to
earth was no easy matter, for in these
days he is behind every scene, and no
statesman, however new, can get along
without his counsel or correction. But,
since to the good Punch man difficul-
ties exist only as obstacles of which
the circumvention acts as intellectual
cocktails or stimuli, the task was
accomplished. Mr. BENNETT agreed
that the book of the other famous
Essex fictionist was a meritorious and
ingenious work, but he found it far
from exhaustive. The idea of God, he
held, still needed handling in a capable
efficient way. What was wrong with
religion was, he said, its mystery; if
only it could be pruned of nonsense
and made practical for the man in º
street, it might become really useful.
He personally had not yet thought
finally on the subject of God, having
just now more tasks on hand (including
a new play and universal supervision)
than he could count on the Five Fingers,
but directly he had time he meant to
attend to the matter and polish it off.
It was a case where his intervention
was clearly called for, since omniscience
could be handled only by omniscience.
The Punch man has, however, to
admit himself beaten in the matter of
Sir OLIVER Lodge. On inquiring at
Birmingham University he was told
that theillustrious Principal was absent,
no one knew where, but it was believed
that he was visiting the higher slopes
of Mount Sinai. All that the Punch
man could obtain was one of the black
velvet skull-caps which the seer wears,
but, as it refused to give up any of
its secrets, he must confess to failure—
at any rate until Sir OLIVER returns.
| Being in Brummagem (as it has been
wittily called), the Punch man bethought
him of the Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL, once
the very darling of the new gods—in
fact the arch neo-theologian. But Mr.
CAMPBELL, erstwhile so articulate and
confident, had nothing to say.
could do was to lock himself for safety
in his church and look through the
keyhole with his beautiful troubled
wistful orbs.
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON loomed up
to a dizzy height amid a cloud of new
witnesses. Greeting the Punch man,
he laid aside his proofs.
“I was just deleting the abusive
epithet “Lloyd’ from all the references
to the PREMIER,” he said, “but I have
a moment for you. I find a moment
sufficient time for the assumption of
any conviction however lifelong."

“Whether or not the opping comes,
some of them,” said the Punch man,
“are certain to be skipped.”
The giant was visibly annoyed.
“You’re not playing the game,” he
said. “It's I who ought to have said
that. Not you. You're only the inter-
viewer. You'd better give it to me

“And what,” the Punch man asked,
“are your views respecting God?”
“I consider,” he said instantly, “that
an honest god's the noblest work of

“I felt sure you would,” the Punch
man replied. “In fact, I had a bet on it.”
The Rev. Sir WILLIAM RoPERTSON
NicoLL, Editor of The British Weekly,
said that for many years his paper had
supported Providence, to, he believed,
their mutual advantage, and it would
continue to do so. He personally re-
cognised no need for change. Still, no
one welcomed honest analysis more
warmly than himself, and he had read
Mr. WELLs's masterpiece with all his
habitual avidity and delight.
The Punch man, passing on to the
office of The Times, craved permission
to see the Editor, through smoked glass
if necessary. Having complied with a
thousand formalities he was at last
ushered into the presence. The great
man was engaged in selecting the
various types in which to-morrow's
letters were to be set up—big for the
whales and minion for the minnows.

AT THE PLAY.
“SHEIL.A.”
Mark Holdsworth, a bachelor of mid-
dle age, is bored with commercial suc-
cess and seeks a diversion. He would
like to have a son. And his attractive
typist, Sheila, strikes his fancy as a
suitable medium. On her side the girl
(obviously recognisable by her inno-
cence as a pre-war flapper) is sick of
drudgery, longs very simply for the
joys of life, as she imagines them,
meaning freedom and pretty dresses
and money to spend and piles of invita-
tion cards, and so forth. His proposal
of marriage, practically the first word
he has ever said to her outside their
business relations, seems to her too
good to be true. There is no question
of a grand passion, not even a question
of every-day romance. It is just a fair
exchange, though she is too young to
appreciate the man's motives and is
content with the pride of being his
choice and the prospects of the won-
derful life that opens before her.
Three months later (they are married
and in their different ways havegrown to
care for one another) we find her discon-
tented. Her social blunders and the atti-
tude of his people have set her on edge,
and we are further to understand that
she is not very responsive to the strength
of his feelings for her. A bad shock
comes when she hears, through a jeal-
ous woman-friend of his bachelor days,
that he has married her for the sake of
a son. This poisons for her the memory
of their first union and she refuses to
be his wife again.
An old obligation, entered into before
his marriage, compels him to go abroad
on business where she cannot accom-
pany him. He does not know that she
is to have a child, and in his absence
she keeps the knowledge from him.
Her boy is born and dies. The news,
reaching Holdsworth through a brother,
brings him home, and husband and wife
are reconciled. Such is the plot, told
crudely enough. - -
Now, if Miss Sow ERBY meant de-
liberately to create a woman who
does not really know what she wants—
a creature of moods without assignable
motives—then I am not ashamed of
failing to understand her Sheila, since
her Sheila did not understand herself.
But if she is designed to illustrate the
eternal feminine (always supposing
that there is such a thing) then I pro-
test that her chief claim to be repre-
sentative of her sex is her unreason-
ableness. Of course I should never
pretend to say of a woman in drama or
fiction that she has not been drawn
true to nature. To know one man is,
in most essentials, to know all men;
to know fifty women (though this may
be a liberal education) does not advance
you very far in knowledge of a sex that
has never been standardized.
When we first meet Sheila her idea
of happiness is to spend an evening (in-
nocent of escort) at the picture-palace;
take this from her and her heart threat-
ens to break. Three short months and
she has developed to the point of break-
ing off relations with a husband who
has given her all the picture-palaces
she wanted, but has also committed the
unpardonable indecency of marrying
her with the object of getting a son |
Here, if she approves the attitude of
her heroine, I am tempted to argue, in
my dull way, with the charming author
THE VICE OF INCONSTANCY.
Sheila. “DEFORE YOU MARRIED ME YOU
weſtEN'T NEARLY SO NICE TO ME. IT'S
HORRID OF YOU TO CHANGE."

of Sheila. You must always remember
that there was no love—not even court-
ship—before this betrothal. The girl
was swept off her feet by the honour
done to her and by the chance of seeing
“life” as she had never hoped to see
it. . . The man, on his side, wanted a son.
Was his object so very contemptible in
comparison with hers? Women marry
by the myriad for the mere sake of
having children, and nobody blames
them. Indeed, we call it, very rever-
entially, the maternal instinct. Well,
what is the matter with the paternal
instinct 2
However, I am not going to set my
opinion up against Miss SowerBY's.
Where I can follow her I find so much
clear insight and observation that I
must needs have faith in her good
judgment where I cannot understand.
This arrangement still leaves me free to
prefer her in her less serious moments.
Here she is irresistible with that deli-
cate humour of hers that is always in
the picture and never has to resort to
the device of manufactured epigram.
There is true artistry in her lightest
touch. Her people are not galvanised
puppets; they simply draw their breath
and there they are. And she has the
particular quality of charm that makes
you yield your heart to her, even when
your head remains your own. -
How much she owes to Miss FAY
CoMPTON's interpretation of Sheila she
would be the first to make generous
acknowledgment. It was an astonish-
ingly sensitive performance. Miss
CoMPTON can be eloquent with a single
word or none at all. By a turn of her
eyes or lips she can make you free of
her inarticulate thoughts. I must go
again just to hear her say “Yes,” and
give that sigh of content at the end of
the First Act.
- Mr. AUBREY SMITH as Mark Holds-
worth had a much easier task, and did
it with his habitual ease. Mr. WILLIAM
FARREN-a very welcome return—was
perfect as ever in a good grumpy part.
It was strange to see the gentle Miss
STELLA CAMPBELL playing the unsym-
pathetic character of a jealous and
rather cruel woman; but she took to it
quite kindly. Mr. LANCE LISTER, as
the boy Geoffrey, who kept intervening
in the most sportsmanlike way on
the weaker, side and adjusting some
very awkward complications with the
gayest and most resolute tact, was
extraordinarily good. Admirable, too,
were Miss Joyce CAREY as a shop-
girl friend of Sheila's boarding-house
period, and Mr. HENRY OscAR as her
“fate,” whose line was shirts. The
scene in which these two encounter
the superior relatives of Sheila's hus-
band abounded in good fun, kept well
within the limits of comedy. It was a
pure joy to hear Miss Hooker's garrulous
efforts to carry off the situation with
aggressive gentility; but even more
fascinating was the abashed silence of
her young man, broken only when he
blurted out the word “shirts,” and
gave the show away.
The whole cast was excellent, and
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER must be feli-
citated on a very clever production.
But it is to author and heroine that I
beg to offer the best of my gratitude
for a most refreshing evening, O.S.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN I first read the title of Secret Bread (HEINEMANN)
my idea was—well, what would anyone naturally think but
that here was a romance of food-hoarding, a tale of running
the potato blockade and the final discovery of a hidden
cellar full of fresh rolls? But of course I was quite wrong.
The name has nothing to do with food, other than mental;
it stands for the sustaining idea (whatever it is) that each one
of us keeps locked in his heart as the motive of his existence.
With Ishmael Ruan, the hero of Miss F. TENNYson JEsse's
novel, this hidden motive was love of the old farm-house
hall of Cloom, and a wish to hand it on, richer, to his son.
Ishmael inherited Cloom himself because, though the
youngest of a large family, he was the only one born in
wedlock. Hence the second theme of the story, the jeal-
ousy between Ishmael and Archelaus, the elder illegitimate
brother. How, through the long lives of both, this enmity
is kept up, and the frightful vengeance that ends it, make
an absorbing and powerful story. The pictures of Cornish
farm-life also are admirably done—though I feel bound to
repeat my conviction that the time is at hand when, for
their own interest, our novelists will have to proclaim what
one might call a close time for pilchards. Still, Miss JEsse
has written an unusually clever book, full of vigour and
passion, of which the interest never flags throughout the
five-hundred-odd closely-printed pages that carry its pro-
tagonists from the early sixties almost to the present day.
No small achievement.
Mrs. SKRINE has collected some charming fragrant papers
from various distinguished sources concerning the ever-
recurring phenomenon of The Devout Lady (CoNSTABLE), in
order to inspire one JoAN, a W.A.D. heroine of the new
order. I guess JoAN, of whom only a faint glimpse is
vouchsafed, must be a nice person—the author's affection-
ate interest in her is sufficient proof of that. I suppose we
all know our Little Gidding out of SHORTHouse's John
Inglesant. Mrs. SKRINE deprecates the Inglesantian view and
offers us a stricter portrait of MARY ColleT. “Madam”
THoRNToN, Yorkshire Royalist dame in the stormy days
of the Irish Rebellion and the Second JAMEs's flight to
St. Germain, is another portrait in the gallery; then there's
PATTY MoRE, HANNAH's less famous practical sister, of
Barleywood and the Cheddar Cliff collieries; and a modern
great lady of a lowly cottage, in receipt of an old-age pension
and still alive in some dear corner of England—the best
sketch of the series, because drawn from life and not from
documents. If the author has a fault it is her detached
allusiveness, her flattering but mystifying assumption that
one can follow all her references, and her rather mannered
idiom: “He proved a kind husband, but sadly a tiresome.”
These, however, be trifles. Read this pleasant book, I beg
you, and send it on to your own Joan.
I have read with deep interest and appreciation and
with a mournful pleasure the Letters of Arthur George
Heath (BLACKWELL, Oxford). It is the record, in a series
of letters mostly written to his parents, of the short fight-
ing life of a singularly brave and devoted man. There
is in addition a beautiful memoir by Professor GILBERT
MURRAY, whose privilege it was to be ARTHUR HEATH's
friend. HEATH was not vowed to fighting from his boy-
bood onward. He was a brilliant scholar and afterwards a
fellow of New College, Oxford. The photograph of him

one might have set him down as destined to lead a quiet of tar—it is not a dry-as-dust treatise on the art of scientific
life amid the congenial surroundings of Oxford, but we
know now that the real stuff of him was strong and
stern. He joined the army a day or two after the out-
break of war, being assured that our cause was just and
one that deserved to be fought for. He had no illusions
as to the risk he ran, but that didn't weigh with him for a
moment. On July 11th, 1915, he writes to his mother
from the Western Front: “Will you at least try, if I am
killed, not to let the things I have loved cause you pain,
but rather to get increased enjoyment from the Sussex
Downs or from Janie (his youngest sister) singing Folk
Songs, because I have found such joy in them, and in that
way the joy I have found can continue to live?” Beautiful
words these, and typical of the man who gave utterance
to them. The end came to him on October 8th, his
twenty-eighth birthday. - -

tongues. "Ma tante,” “Mon cousin,” “Enfin”—these are
well within the range of all of us. Indeed, though I shrink
from boasting, I could easily have borne it if she had tried
me a little higher. “Ma tante,” for instance, got rather
upon my nerves before the heroine had finished with it.
The plot (early nineteenth century) is concerned with one
Ronnay de Maurel, a soldier and admirer of NAPoleoN, and
in consequence anathema to most of his own family. The
heroine was betrothed to Ronnay's half-brother, as elegant
and royalist as Ronnay was uncouth and Napoleonic. It
is a tale of love and intrigue for idle hours, the kind of
thing that the Baroness does well; and, though she has
done better before in this vein, you will not lack for excite-
ment here; and possibly, as I did, you will sometimes smile
when strictly speaking you ought to have been serious.

HIGGs is no believer in the dictum that the best thing to

opinion; nor is he afraid that heavy taxation will kill the
goose with the golden eggs. It may be “one of those
depraved birds which eat their own eggs, in which case, if
its eggs cannot be trapped, killing is ; it is fit for.” The
author is full of well-thought-out suggestions for saving
waste and increasing efficiency in our national administra-
tion. The introduction of labour-saving machinery, the
elimination of superfluous officials, the reduction of the
necessary drudgery which too often blights the initiative
and breaks the hearts of our young civil servants—all
these and many other reforms are advocated in Mr. Higgs's

the poor old darling dropped his

The wedding-cake was a great
big war loaf stuck with flags.
Juno cut it in old-fashioned style
with Portcullis's sword. While
we were doing ourselves well
with war-bread and margarine,
boiled eggs and plenty of cham-

Our Advantages to Aliens. He was of
military age, and when war came, after
giving vent to some completely detest-
able sentiments, he crossed to the U.S.
and naturalised himself there, con-
stantly attacking the country that was
unlucky enough to produce him.
When the U.S. came in, he shed his
citizenship in a hurry, fled to South
America, and naturalised himself in a
republic that had sworn by all its gods
to keep out of the War d tout pric.
This republic, however, changed its
mind later and followed its big northern
brother into the War, et voilà ( Some-

He afterwards naturalised himself in
half-a-dozen small far-away nations

of the South Pacific (the favourite ocean
of his sort') and had himself made an
Ollyoola. (The Ollyoolas are a tribe
that has never in all its past history
been known to go to war). He was
made an Ollyoola with all the native
rites, dancing and shrieking and so on,
and he wore the correct Ollyoola dress
(a few shells and his hair trained on
sticks to stand straight up).
And now comes the point of this
storyette : Only a few weeks after
Somebody's Cousin had become a full-
blooded Ollyoola (I think that's the
proper phrase), the Ollyoolas suddenly
fell out with the Patti-Tattis (on the

THE DISSUADERS.
For many years—ever since the first
piece of chalk was applied to the first
wall and advertising began its bom-
bastic career—the advertiser's tendency
has been to commend his wares, if not
to excess, at any rate with no want of
generosity. Everyone must have noticed
it. But war changes many things
besides Cabinets, and if the paper
famine is to continue there will shortly
be a totally novel kind of advertising to
be seen, where dissuasion holds the
highest place. For unless something
happens those journals which have
already done much to reduce circula-
tion will have to do more and actually
decry themselves. Such counsels as
those which follow may before long
meet the eyes, and, it is possible, in-
fluence the minds, of the great B.P.:—

PAN PIPES.
IN the green spaces of the listening trees
Pan sits at ease,
Watching with lazy eyes
Little blue butterflies
That flicker sidelong in the fitful breeze;
While on his pipe he plays
Quaint trills, and roundelays
With dropping cadences;
And shy red squirrels rub against his
knees.
And, thro' the city's tumult and the beat
Of hurrying feet,
Those whom the god loves hear
Pan's pipe, insistent, clear;
Echoes of elfin laughter, high and
sweet ; -
Catch in the sparrows' cries
Those tinkling melodies
That sing where brooklets meet,
And the wood's glamour colours the
grey street.
A Local FooD-contRoller.
“No partner for you this evening,
Sir,” said the Inspector. “Mr. Tibbits
has just telephoned through that he
has rheumatism badly again.”
I know Tibbits' rheumatism. I also
know he plays off his heat in the
club billiard handicap to-night. I can
imagine him writhing round the table.
Still I remember the first rule of the
force—under no circumstances give
another policeman away.
“You’ll have to take Dartmouth
Street by yourself, Sir," continues the
Inspector.
“What 'S it, like 2 ”
“Bit of a street market. All right—
just tact and keep them moving.”
I reach Dartmouth Street. It is a
thronged smelly thoroughfare. I pass
along modestly, hoping that every one
will ignore me.
But a gentleman who is selling fish
detects me and calls “'Ere, Boss, move
this ole geeser on.” -
“What's the trouble?” I inquire.
The old geeser turns rapidly on me.
“'Ere 'e's gone and sold me two 'errings
for tuppence 'alfpenny which was that
salt my 'usband went near mad, what
with the pubs bein’ shut all afternoon,
an' now 'e's popped the fender jus' to
get rid of 'is thirst.”
“I told you to soak 'em in three
waters,” says the fishmonger,
“'Ow much beer is my 'usband to
soak 'imself in—tell me that 2"
It is time for tact. I whisper in the
lady's ear, “Come along—don't argue
with a man like that. He's beneath
you.”
She comes away. I am triumphant.
But she turns round and cries, “This
gentleman as is a gentleman says I
ain't to lower meself by talkin' to a
'ound like you.”
I move on. I doubt if the fishmonger
will be pleased by the lady's representa-
tion of my few words, and I make a
mental note to keep away from his stall.
All at once another lady, who for some
obscure reason is carrying a bucket,
grips me by the arm.
“I’m goin' to 'ave the law on my
side, I am,” she declares emphatically,
“an' then I'll smash 'is bloomin' fice
in.”
I am swayed towards a fruit-stall.
“Look at them,” says the irate lady,
holding out three potatoes. “Rotten—
at thrippence a pound. My 'usband
'e'd 'ave set abaht me if I'd give 'im
them for 'is dinner.”
The fruiterer takes a lofty moral
standard. “I sold yer them fer seed

“Perhaps you can exchange them,
then you'll have the lady for a regular

“I don't want the blighterfer a reglar
customer,” says the fruiterer.
Three potatoes whirl past me at the
fruiterer. The lady with the bucket
departs rapidly. -
“Lemme get at 'er," cries the irate

disillusioned man behind me.

They were in ecstasies. But I was damping;
I like a trench, I have no lives to spare; ... •
And in those catacombs, however cramping,
You did at least know vaguely where you were.
Ah, happy days in deep well-ordered alleys,
Where, after dining, probably with wine,
One felt indifferent to hostile sallies,
And with a pipe meandered round the line;
You trudged along a trench until it ended;
It led at least to some familiar spot;
It might not be the place that you'd intended,
But then you might as well be there as not.
But what a wilderness we now inhabit
Since this confounded “open" strife prevails!
It may be good; I do not wish to crab it,
But you should hear the language it entails,
Should see this waste of wide uncharted craters
Where it is vain to seek the companies,
Seeing the shell-holes are as like as taters
And no one knows where anybody is.
Oft in the darkness, palpitant and blowing,
Have I set out and lost the hang of things,
And ever thought, “Where can the guide be going?”
But trusted long and rambled on in rings,
For ever climbing up some miry summit,
And halting there to curse the contrite guide,
For ever then descending like a plummet
"Into a chasm on the other side.
Oft have I sat and wept, or sought to study
With hopeless gaze the uninstructive stars,
Hopeless because the very skies were muddy;
I only saw a red malicious Mars;
Or pulled my little compass out and pondered,
And set it sadly on my shrapnel hat,
Which, I suppose, was why the needle wandered,
Only, of course, I never thought of that.
And then perhaps some 5.9's start dropping,
As if there weren't sufficient holes about;
I flounder on, hysterical and sopping,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 11th.-I am told that
it was WILLIE REDMOND's ambition to
be the Father of the House; indeed, that
by some arithmetical process peculiar
to himself he claimed, although only
elected in 1883, to be already entitled
to that venerable honour.
In reality he was the Eternal Boy,
from the far-off time when it was his
nightly delight with, youthful exuber-
ance to cheek Mr. Speaker BRAND
until the moment of his glorious death
in Flanders, whither he had gone at an
age when most of his compeers were
content to play the critic in a snug
corner of the smoking-room.
Personal affection combined with
admiration for his gallantry to inspire
the speeches in which the PRIME
MINISTER, Mr. Asquith and Sir ED-
ward CARson enshrined the most re-
markable tribute ever paid to a private
Member.
Sir GEORGE GREENwooD's affection

supposed to be such that he would
not countenance the slaughter of the
meanest thing that crawls—not even
those miserable creatures who hold
that SHAKSPEARE's plays were written
by SHAKSPEARE. It was therefore with
pained regret that I heard him attempt-
ing to support his objection to the
activities of sparrow-clubs by the argu-
ment that, if the birds were destroyed,
large numbers of grubs and cater-
pillars would be left alive. After this
I shall not be surprised to hear that he
has been summoned by the R.S.P.C.A.
for brutality to a slug.
What I most admire in the CHIEF
SECRETARY FoR IRELAND is his wonder-
ful self-restraint. When Mr. GINNELL
stridently inquired whether to insti-
tute legal process against the police in
Ireland was not like bringing an action
against Satan in hell, the ordinary
man would have been tempted to reply:
“The hon. Member probably has sources
of information not accessible to me.”
Mr. DUKE contented himself with mildly
suggesting that the hon. Membershould
|
“apply his own intelligence to that
matter.” Perhaps, however, he meant
much the same thing.
Half the sitting was taken up with
discussing whether Messrs. Jowett and
RAMSAY MACDoNALD should be given
passports to Russia. Mr. BonAR LAw
clinched the matter by saying that the
Russian Government wanted them.
Well, de gustibus, etc.
Tuesday, June 12th-Perhaps the
most wonderful revelation of the War
has been the adaptability of the British
working-man. Mr. CATHCART WASON
called attention to the case of a pro-
fessional gardener who, having been
recruited for home service, had first
been turned into a bricklayer's assist-
ant, then into an assistant-dresser, and
finally into a munition-maker. For
some time the Ministry of Munitions

If he could only keep down food-prices
as effectively as he does irrelevant
questioners he would be worth his
weight in “Bradburys.” His latest
victim is Mr. PENNEFATHER, who has
developed a keen curiosity on the sub-
|ject of potatoes. Did not the Govern-
ment think that the high price would
cause premature “lifting” 2 Were they
aware that potatoes could be used
for making rubber - substitutes and
cement; and would they assure the
House that there would be an abund-
ance of them for the next twelve
months? Captain BATHURST declined
to figure in the rôle of prophet, and,
for the rest, remarked that the hon.
Member appeared to have an insati-
able appetite for crambe repetita. Mr.
PENNEFATHER is understood to be still
searching the Encyclopædia to discover
the properties of this vegetable, with
the view of putting a few posers on the
subject to Captain BATHURST (or his
successor) next week.
As the friends of Proportional Repre-
sentation are wont to refer to their
little pet by the affectionate diminutive
of “P.R.,” they can hardly be sur-
prised that its appearance should lead
to combats recalling in intensity the
palmy days of the Prize Ring. It was
|designed that the Front Bench should
be content to perform the function of
judicious bottle-holder, and leave the
issue to be fought out by the rest of the
House. But Sir F. E. SMITH, like the
Irishman who inquired, “Is this a
private fight, or may anyone join in 2"
could not refrain from trailing his coat,
and quickly found a doughty opponent
in Mr. HAYEs FISHER. The House so
much enjoyed the unusual freedom of
the fight that it would probably be
going on still but for that spoil-sport,
the HoME SECRETARY, who begged
Members to come to a decision. By
149 votes to 141 “P. R.” was “down
and out.”
Mr. EUGENE WASON entered an anti-
cipatory protest against the possibility
that Scotland might be deprived of
some of her seventy-two Members. “I
myself,” he said, “represent two whole
counties, Clackmannan and Kinross,
and I have a bit of Stirling and Perth
and West Fife, and I am told I am to
be swept out of existence.” Gazing at
his ample proportions the House felt
that the Boundary Commissioners will
have their work cut out for them.
Wednesday, June 13th.-Considering
that barely three hours before the House
met the “Fort of London" had been
drenched with the “ghastly dew of
aerial navies” Members showed them-
selves most uncommon calm. They
exhibited, however, a little extra in-
terest when any prominent personage
entered the House, showing that he at
least had escaped the bombs, and were
too busy comparing notes regarding
their personal experiences to ask many
Supplementary Questions.

The mystery of Lord NorthcLIFFE's

to enjoy his confidence, had described
him as “Mr. Balfour's successor.”
Certain other journals, whose con-

to believe this. The fact, as stated by
Mr. BoNAR LAw, is that “it is hoped
that Lord NorthcLIFFE will be able
to carry on the work begun by Mr.
BALFour as head of the British Mission
in America.” He is expected “to co-

interesting to learn that his Lordship
“will have the right of communicating

thing which of course he has never
done before.

THE INFANTICIDE.
FROM an economic point of view it
was inexcusable. I can only hope that
the affair will never reach the ear of
the new FooD-CoNTROLLER. The chief
culprit was undoubtedly Joan minor—
I only became an accomplice after the
fact—and I can scarcely believe that
even a Food-Controller could be very
angry with Joan minor. For one thing
she really is so very minor. And then
there's her manner; in face of it se-
verity, as I have found, is out of the
question. Even Joan major, who has
been known to rout our charlady in
single combat, finds it irresistible. In-
deed when I taxed her with having
a hand in the crime she secured an
acquittal on the plea of duress.
Ever since Joan minor arrived at
years of understanding the weeks pre-
ceding the great day have been fraught
with a mystery in which I have no
share. Earnest conversations which
break off guiltily the moment I enter
the room; strained whisperings and
now and again little uncontrollable
giggles of ecstatic anticipation from
Joan minor—these are the signs that I
have learned to look for, and, being
well versed in my part, to ignore with a
sublime unconsciousness which should
make my fortune in a melodrama of
stage asides. And then, on the morning
of my birthday, the solemn ceremonial
of revelation, I would come in to break-
fast, to find a parcel lying by my
plate. At first I would not see it. In
a tense and unnatural silence Joan
minor would follow me with her eyes
while I opened the window a few inches,
closed it again, stroked the cat and
generally behaved as though sitting
down at table was the last thing I in-
tended. Then, when I did take my place,
“The post is early to-day,” I would
say, pushing the parcel carelessly on
one side as I took up the paper, while
Joan minor hid her face in Joan major's
blouse lest her feelings should betray
her into premature speech. And at
last I would open it, and my amaze-
ment and delight would know no
bounds. There was very little acting
needed for that. It is no small thing
to be spirited back to the age when
birthdays really matter.
And so this year it was with a feel-
ing of having been cheated that I left
the house for the office, where, in com-
pany with other old fogies, and girl
clerks, I do my unambitious bit towards
downing the Hun. The premonitory
symptoms had seemed to me unusually
acute, but the morning had brought
no parcel. My years weighed on my
shoulders again, and I am afraid I was

I was kept late for dinner, and when
I entered the room I found Joan minor
sitting in her place, her eyes bright
with expectation. Beside my place
was a covered muffin dish. There
was no dallying with the pleasure this
time, for I had suddenly become young
again, and could not have waited had
I tried. I lifted the cover, and there,
about the size of a well-nourished pea,
lay the first-fruit of Joan minor's pecu-
liar and personal allotment, prepared,
planted and dug by Joan minor's own
hands, a veritable and unmistakable

THE HAT AND THE VISIT.
“Francesca,” I said, “does my hat really look all right?”
When I put this momentous question we were in a train,
being bound on a visit to Frederick at his preparatory
school. A sudden doubt had just assailed me as to my
presentability. Should I, as a father, be looked upon as a
credit or a disgrace to my son 2 Francesca took some time
before she answered my question. Then she spoke.
“Your hat,” she said, “is well enough.”
“I see what it is,” I said; “you think I ought to have
worn a top-hat. There are still occasions when a top-hat
may, nay, must be worn; and this, you think, is one of
them. There are solemnities and venerations that only a
top-hat can inspire in the naturally irreverent mind of
youth. A father in any other hat is a ridiculously youthful
of both sexes. I once stayed with a bishop, and I never
heard anybody attempt to make a mockery of his gaiters.”
“But they were his own. He couldn't be a bishop
without them.”
“That fact doesn't render them immune from laughter.
My present hat, for instance, is my own, and yet you have
been laughing at it ever since I called your attention to it.”
“Not at all; I have been admiring it. I said it was well
enough, and so it is. What more can you want 2"
“I only hope,” I said, “that Frederick will think so too.
It would be too painful to dash the cup of half-holiday joy
from a boy's lips by wearing an inappropriate hat.”
“You're too nervous altogether about the impression
you're going to make on Frederick. Take example by me.
I've got a hat on.”
“You have,” I said fervently. “It has grazed my face
object and has no business to inflict himself on his son. more than once.”

Batman. “HERE HE is, SIR."
Very well. I would not for worlds spoil Frederick's half-
holiday by shaming him in the eyes of his schoolfellows.”
“What do you propose to do about it, then 2 You can't
alter your hat now.” -
“No,” I said, “I can't ; but I can get out of the train at
the next station and go home and leave you in your com-
parative spickness and your relative spanness to spend your
afternoon with the boy. Or, stay, there must be a shop in
Belfield where top-hats can be bought. It is a cathedral
city and possesses dignitaries of the Church who still wear
top-hats, and—”
“But those are special top-hats. You couldn't go to
Frederick in a bishop's hat, now could you?”
“No-o-o,” I said doubtfully, “perhaps I couldn't. But
suppose I wore the gaiters too—wouldn't that make it
all right?”
“I should like,” she said, “to see Frederick's face on
perceiving the new bishop.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you talk as if no boys ever had
bishops for their fathers. Let me assure you, on the con-
trary, that there are many bishops who have large families
“It is feeding,” she said, “on your damask cheek. But
I'm quite calm in spite of it.”
“But then,” I said, “you never knew Rowell.”
“ No. Who was he 2 " .
“Rowell,” I said, “was a schoolfellow of mine, and he
had a father.” - -
“Marvellous! And a mother too, I suppose.”
“Yes,” I said, “but she doesn't come into the story.
Rowell's father had a passion, it appears, for riding, and
one dreadful afternoon, when we were playing cricket, he
rode into the cricket-field. He was wearing trousers, and
his trousers had rucked up to his knees. It was a terrific
sight, and, though we all pretended not to see and were
very sorry for young Rowell, he felt the blow most keenly.
I hope my hat won't be like Rowell's father's trousers.”
“It isn't a bit like them yet,” said Francesca. R. C. L.
“FIREMAN wanted; consuming under 50 tons; wages 30s."
Under the present system of rationing, this demand for
moderation does not seem excessive.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT is my deliberate verdict that Mr. E. F. BENson is (as
my old nurse used to express it) “in league with Somebody
he oughtn't.” I hope, however, that he will understand
this for the extorted compliment that it is, and not magic
me into something unpleasant, or (more probably) write
another book to prove to my own dissatisfaction that I am
everything I least wish to be. That indeed is the gravamen
of my charge: the diabolic ingenuity with which he makes
not so much our pleasant vices as our little almost-virtues
into whips to scourge us with. All this has been wrung
from me by the perusal of Mr. Teddy (FISHER UNwiN).
Even now I can't make up my mind whether I like it or
not. The first half, which might be called a satire on the
folly of being forty and not realising it, depressed me pro-
foundly. I need not perhaps- enlarge upon the reason.
Later, Mr. BENSON made a very clever return upon the
theme; and, with a touch of real beauty, brought solace to
poor Mr. Teddy and consolation to the middle-aged reader.
I need give you only a slight indication of the plot, which
is simplicity itself. Into the self-contained little com-
munity of a provincial society, where to have once been
young is to retain a courtesy title to perpetual youth, there
arrives suddenly the genuine article, a boy and girl still in
the springtime of life, by contrast with whom the preserved
immaturity of Mr. Teddy and his partner, Miss Daisy, is
shown for an artificial substitute. Baldly stated, the thesis
sounds cynical and a little cruel; actually, however, you
will here find Mr. BENSON in a kindlier mood than he some-
times consents to indulge. He displays, indeed, more than
a little fondness for his disillusioned hero; the fine spirit
with which Mr. Teddy faces at last the inevitable is a sure
proof of the author's sympathy.
You will hardly have traversed the passages of our under-
ground railway system without being hurriedly aware in
passing of a picture in reds and browns, representing a
faun-like figure piping to an audience of three rather self-
conscious rabbits. This pleasing group does not portray
an actual scene from Autumn (LANE), but is rather to be
taken as symbolic of the atmosphere of Miss MURIEL
HINE’s latest book. The faun, I imagine, stands for Rollo,
the middle-aged lover of the country, into whose happy life
other, more human, loves break with such devastation.
What the rabbits mean is a more difficult problem. I jest;
but as a matter of fact I should be the first to admit that
Miss HINE has written a story that, despite a certain
crudity of colouring, is both unconventional and alive. The
attitude of the characters towards their parents, for example,
is at least original. Deirdre, the heroine, frankly despised her
mother, to whom she owed a marriage with the man whom
she hated. The gift of a country cottage enabled her to
escape from him to rabbits (figurative) and the simpler
life. There, however, she fell in with Rollo, who loved her
at sight, and whose daughter, Hyacinth, adored her father,
but quite blandly deceived him about her own amorous
adventures. A pretty tangle, you observe, and I am not
sure that I can wholly acquit the author of some cowardice
in her manner of cutting it. But undoubtedly Autumn
remains a story to read, and remember. -

ALGY.
ALGY, it must be admitted, is no
Adonis, but at least there is something
in his great round pudding-face and
his cheery idiotic smile which gives
one the impression of a warm and
optimistic nature.
Algy is humble and not ambitious;
but for all that he is doing his bit, just
as you and I are doing. He never goes
on strike, and if he had any money,
which he never does have, I know he
would invest it in War Loan. Above
all he is not a food-hog; not for him
the forbidden potato or the millionaire's
beer—no! Against all luxuries Algy
has resolutely steeled his voluminous
tummy. He has turned into the strict-
est of teetotalers, and, though a glass
of Scotch may bring a wistful look into
his eyes, yet he remains captain of his
soul, unbroken as ST. ANTHoNY.
His job is war-work of the steeliest
order, such as very few men would care
to undertake. All for the cause he
stands, day after day, with a little band
of comrades, facing uncomplainingly
the most terrible buffetings, so that
men may learn from him how to strike
terror into the heart of the Hun.
Needless to remark, he is beloved by
all the Tommies who inflict such pain
upon the region of his gaudy blue
waistcoat; he never seems to care and
never grouses, but beams down on
them undaunted with that quaint old
grin of his.
'Twas a great and solemn day when
we installed him. Conspicuous by his
horrible suit of reach-me-downs, sup-
ported on one side by the sergeant-
major, on the other by the sergeant,
he was led gently but firmly out of
his billet and initiated into his honour-
able task.
Algy has but one grievance. He
wants badly to sport a few golden
stripes on his cuff. He is modest and
does not push himself forward, but as
he has several times been severely
wounded he thinks it only fair that he
should receive the coveted distinction.
But the authorities will not grant his
simple request because, they say, he
has shed no blood.
He has outlived all his compeers;
lesser men may succumb but Algy
goes on. One day, I suppose, he will
meet the common fate; but may
that sorry day be far ahead. For we
could ill spare our Algy—our dear old
bayonet dummy!

Nothing to boast about.
THE BAN ON RACING.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-In this bitter
controversy I hope that a few moderate
and impartial words from one, like my-
self, who sees clearly both sides of the
question, may not be out of place. In
any case I feel it is incumbent upon
me to do all I can to avert the dire con-
sequences of the frightful catastrophe
that has fallen upon us through the
mad act of an insensate War Cabinet.
I can only say that if this is to be our
spirit we are indeed defeated. Where
is our devotion to manly sports, so
potent in the moulding of our National
character 2 What has become of our
immemorial Right to Look On 2 Where
is our boasted liberty, deprived as we
are now to be of a chance to find the
winner? What did WELLINGTON say of
Waterloo 2 and MARLBorough of Blen-
heim 2 and BottomLEY of the Battle
of the Somme 2 By what perversity
of reasoning are we thus to asphyxiate
the best instincts of our race?
We are said to be fighting for all that
we hold sacred. Yet there is nothing
that is held more sacred in every cot-
tage home throughout the land than the
Preservation of our Bloodstock. Let us
not deceive ourselves. It is our supre-
macy in Bloodstock alone that makes
possible the governess car, the milk
van, the brewer's dray, the very plough
itself. These are fundamental facts.
It has been suggested that, in order
to avoid the assembling of frivolous
crowds in war-time, races might be run
in private. But that is quite impracti-
cable. Only on the public racecourse
can the lofty virtues of our British
Bloodstock be displayed. The exciting
presence of the crowd is absolutely es-
sential to tune up its nerve and temper.
Already our Bloodstock has suffered
cruelly from gaps in the Grand Stand.
Then again there are some who actu-
ally complain that petrol is consumed
in large quantities by those attending
race meetings. Are we to put new
heart into our enemies by letting it be
known that we are short of petrol?
And finally there are some who so
little understand the qualities of the
Thoroughbred as to suggest that gam-
bling should be stopped in war-time.
The horse, unlike the Cabinet, is intelli-
gent. Can he be expected to exhibit his
priceless qualities of speed and stamina
if no one puts his money up 2
I need say no more. Such flippant
legislation is bad enough at any time ;
during the Armageddon period it is
little short of treason. One wonders
when our Government will begin to
realise that we are at wir.
I am, Yours helpfully, as usual,

Returned to the White House for
dinner, and co-ordinated grape juice
with lemonade and Perrier.
June 18th.-Breakfasted with HEARST

task needing the highest diplomatic
qualities. Flew to Harvard and de-
livered lecture on Mr. BALFour's The-
ology as correlated with his style in
golf. A great reception. Despatched
report by wireless to London, Paris and
Petrograd. Returned to New York in
the afternoon and co-ordinated UPTox

and CHARLEs DANA GIBson.
June 19th.-In the morning dictated
articles for the Novoe Vremya, Matin and
Corriere della Sera, emphasizing the
need of co-operative cosmopolitan co-
ordination. Flew to Chicago to deliver ||
supplementary lecture to that given by
ARTHUR BALFour on ARISTOTLE. Took |
for my subject “Aerial Trade Routes,
as co-ordinated with Terra-firma Routes
for Motor-lorries.” Enthusiastic recep-
tion. Co-ordinative cold collation at
9 P.M. at Philadelphia with GoAIPERs,
RocKEFELLER, Mrs. ATHERTON and
BILLY SUNDAY.
June 20th.-Dictated article on the
New Diplomacy for The New York
Journal. In the afternoon co-ordinated
the tenets of Shin-Toism, Christian
Science and Mormonism. A heavy
day. -
June 21st.—Much annoyed by report

No BLINKIN' NEED TO TRY AND KISS ME EVERY TIME WE MEET."
JUST SAILORS.
Betty, having made an excellent
breakfast, thank you, slipped from her
chair and sidled round the table to me.
Her father's guests are, naturally and
without exception, Betty's slaves, to do
with as she deems best. To her they
are known, regardless of age, either by
their Christian names or as “Mr. —er.”
I had enjoyed the privilege of her ac-
quaintance for five years, but was still
included in the second category.
Betty has an appealing eye, freckles,
and most fascinating red-gold hair, and
on the morning of which I write, after
preparing the attack with the first, she
gently massaged my face with the
second and third, the while insinuating
into my own a small hand not innocent
of marmalade. Betty is seven or there-
abouts. “Mr. —er,” she said, “what
shall we be to-day ?”
“Let us,” I replied hastily, “pretend
to be not quite at our best this morn-
ing, and have a quiet time in the deck-
chairs on the lawn.” Betty very natur-
ally paid no regard whatever to this
cowardly suggestion.
“I'm not quite sure,” she said, “if
we will be pirates or soldiers or just
sailors. What do you think?”
Pirates sounded rather strenuous for
so hot a day. Soldiers, I felt sure, in-
volved my becoming a German prisoner
and parading the garden paths with
my arms up, crying “Kameradl” while
prodded me from behind. Just sailors,
on the other hand, smacked of gentle
sculling exercise in the dinghy on the
lake, so I said, “Let's be just sailors.”
But a sailor's life, as interpreted by
Betty, is no rest cure. On land it
includes an exaggerated rolling gait—
itself somewhat fatiguing—and inter-
vals of active participation in that
most exacting dance, the hornpipe, to
one's own whistling accompaniment.
the best sailors double briskly to such
melodies as “Tipperary" and “Keep
the Home Fires Burning.”
It was only when we arrived by the
lake-side that Betty observed my gum-
boots; instantly a return to the house
in search of Daddy's nautical footgear
was necessitated. This, though gener-
ous in dimensions, was finally induced
to remain in position on Betty's small
feet, her own boots being, of course,
|relined.
| The dinghy was launched and, after
a little preliminary wading in the gum-
boots, the crew embarked. Betty's
future profession will, I am sure, be
that of quick-change artist. In less
than ten minutes she had risen from
cabin-boy to skipper, vić ordinary sea-
man, A.B., bo'sun and various grades
of mate. My rank, which had at the
outset been that of admiral, as speedily
declined, until I was merely the donkey-
engine greaser, whose duties appeared

Betty, gun in hand, shepherded and to include that of helmsman (Betty is
not yet an adept with two sculls).
Our vessel also changed its character
with lightning rapidity. It was in
turn a ferry-boat—imitation of pas-
sengers descending the gangway by
rhythmical patting of hand on thwart;
a hospital ship chased by a submarine
—cormorant's neck and head naturally
mistaken for periscope; a destroyer
attacking a submarine—said cormorant
kindly obliging with quick diving act
when approached; a food-ship laden
with bananas represented by rushes
culled from the banks; and a smuggler
running cargoes of French wine con-
tained in an elderly empty bottle dis-
covered in the mud above high-water
mark. It was breathless work.
The disaster occurred when Betty,
against my maturer judgment, insisted
upon the exploration on foot of a man-
grove swamp on the shore of a canni-
bal-infested South Sea island. The
immediate cause was a suddenly de-
veloped attachment on the part of one
of Daddy's sea-boots to the mud on
the lake-side. The twain refused to
be parted, and the youthful explorer
measured her length in the mire.
Generously overlooking my careless-
ness in not warning her that we were
traversing a quicksand, Betty, rather
shaken, very muddy and with a sus-
picion of tears in her voice, bound me
by a blood-curdling nautical oath not
to breathe a word of the mishap to

Mummy, Daddy or Miss Watt, her
governess. The pledge having been
given, Betty, the offending boots dis-
carded, fled to her own room by way of
the back-door.
It was then twelve o'clock, and in
the hour that remained before luncheon
I was fertile in excuses for Betty's ab-
sence from the scene; in fact, the neces-
sity for concealing the calamity quite
marred what should have been a time
of well-earned relaxation.
At last we sat down to the midday
meal, and the members of the house-
party began to relate their morning's
adventures. Finally some thoughtless
person said, “Well, Betty, and what
mischief have you been up to ?"
Betty, quite recovered and with a
radiant smile, replied, “Oh, Mr. —er
and I had a scrumptious time on the
lake. We were sailors—just sailors–
and did all sorts of lovely things, didn't
we, Mr. — er’”
I agreed, and Betty went on to her
peroration: -
“And at the very end Mr. —er was a
tiger and I was a little small boy, and
he jumped on me out of the bushes and
knocked me down in the mud” [O

MY DEAR CHARLEs, I've become so
artful these days in disguising identi-
ties under assumed names that I'm
hanged if I can remember myself which
of my people is which. Still I daresay
your own memory isn't too good, so
we'll call him Ross this time, and trust
to luck that that is what we called him
last time. He is that one of my friends
and fellow-sinners who was plugging
along nicely at the Bar in 1914, and
was just about to take silk, when he
changed his mind, came to France and
got mixed up in what he calls “this
vulgar brawl on the Continent.” After
nearly three years of systematic war-
fare in the second line he has at last
calls for a vast amount of special know-
ledge in its personnel. Ross, having been
at the Bar, knows nothing and knows
that he knows nothing, but is able to
pretend to know just enough to keep
his end up with Thos. J. Brown, who,
|master of it in more senses than one.
Since that time Ross has ensured the
ºfficient running of his office by keep-
|ing out of it when it is busy. When
for appearance' sake he has to be there
he does as his Mr. Brown tells him,
disguised as a corporal, really runs the and never wastes the latter's time by
business. “Our Mr. Brown,” as Ross
calls him, is one of those nice old gen-
tlemen who wear large spectacles and
cultivate specialist knowledge on the in-
tensive system. Owing to his infalli-
bility in all details and upon all occa-
sions he was much sought after in peace
time by the larger commercial houses.

In the Army, all fleas have bigger

Were this not so somebody would have
to act upon his own responsibility, and
that, as you will admit, would make war
an impossibility. Accordingly in every

tary matters should be set forth, in
paragraphs, separately numbered:—
1. Lt. Ross possessed a bicycle,
‘motor, one. No. 54321 L/Cpl. Burt
possessed feet, two, only. Ross had no
occasion, ability or disposition to ride
a motor bicycle. No. 54321 could
neither do his business nor enjoy life
afoot. Accordingly, No. 54321 rode the
bicycle, while, for the purposes of what
is known to better people than ourselves
as Establishment, Ross owned it. But
that was in the good old days, before
Traffic and Police and all the Others
interested themselves.
2. The first thing Traffic did was
to say that all owners of motor bi-
cycles must own cards, and produce
them when demanded. That was easy:
No. 54321 got the card. Then Police
issued some vague but menacing litera-
ture with regard to the fate of people
who stole other people's property or
failed to stick to their own. There was
no difficulty about this; Ross publicly
fathered the thing.
3. Traffic, issuing new cards, said
next that all owners of cards must also
own bicycles. Realising the quandary,
Ross was for saying he wouldn't play
any more, but would declare a separate
peace. His Mr. Brown however got
up a long and intricate correspondence,
at the end of which Ross was still
owner and No. 54321 was still rider;
both had cards, and all the authorities
had, unknowingly, made themselves'
parties to the fraud. -
Suddenly the Major declared his in-
tention of putting the whole of Ross's
establishment (including bicycle) on
what he called a satisfactory basis by
a series of orders which he proposed to
draft himself. Ross, always ready to
be put on a satisfactory basis by any-
body, took note of the draft, and laid it
before his Mr. Brown. The latter was
aghast, and proved, by infallible rea-
sons, the fatal results which would
follow if the matter was stirred up.
Ross made a careful note of the rea:
sons, and laid them before the Major.
The Major explained gently that disci-
pline was discipline. And so Ross
went to and fro between the two, until
the Major said, “Really, Ross' " and
his Mr. Brown said, “I’m very sorry,
Sir, but there it is;” and yet Ross
couldn't sack his Major, and he couldn't
break away from his Mr. Brown.
He was between the Devil and the
Deep Sea. What was he to do about
it 2 Well, he just told the Deep Sea to
keep calm a little longer, and went and
waited outside the Devil's Mess. He
saluted and asked the Devil if he'd care
to come for a walk, and, the latter con-
senting, he led him to the Deep Sea.
Then, when the Devil himself had been
introduced to the Deep Sea itself, Ross
slipped off and left them in his office
to fix it up between themselves.
Ross dined with the Major that night,
and the latter said he wasn't feeling at
all well. The way Ross's Mr. Brown
had licked his thumb and the lightning
speed with which he had turned up
exactly the right correspondence, office
minute or Routine Order, had nearly
given the Major heart disease. Besides,
he'd lost the argument. “I was too
heavily handicapped from the start,"
said he, “by not being in a position
to lick my thumb or to stick my pencil
behind my ear.”
It was a good idea to introduce the
Major and Mr. Brown, wasn't it,
Charles? The Major says he was the
first to suggest it, and Ross is careful
to leave the credit with the Major, be-
cause he is sure that the idea really
originated in the fertile and masterful
brain of his Mr. Brown.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 18th.-Arising out of
the dethronement of TINo a cloud-burst
of questions descended upon Lord
RoBERT CECIL, who took refuge under
a wide-spreading umbrella of official
ignorance. Mr. LYNCH was annoyed
because his question whether the Allies
would oppose the foundation of a Greek
Republic was dismissed as “hypo-
thetical,” but Lord Robert assured
him that there was “nothing abusive"
in the epithet. But is that so? Suppose
he were to describe Mr. LYNch as a
“hypothetical statesman"?
A detailed history of a Canterbury
lamb, from its purchase in New Zealand
at 63d, a pound to its sale to the British
butcher at 10%d., was given by Mr.
GEORGE Roberts. He threw no light,
however, on the problem why it should
double in price before reaching the con-
sumer. This is engaging the anxious
consideration of Lord RHoNDDA, who
declares that there is no adequate eco-
nomic reason why Little Mary should
have only a little lamb.
In the House of Commons as in a
music-hall you can always get a laugh
by referring to “the lodger.” Whether
the lodger, who is considered quite good
enough to vote for a mere Member
of Parliament, should also be allowed
a voice in the election of really im-
portant people like town councillors
was the theme of animated discussion.
It ended ultimately in the lodger's
favour, with the proviso that the apart-
ments he occupies should be unfur-
nished. On such niceties does the
British Constitution depend.
Tuesday, June 19th.-Mr. BALFour
received a warm welcome from all
sections of the House on making his
first appearance after his return from
America. Even the ranks of Tus-
cany, on the Irish benches, could not
forbear to cheer their old opponent.
Besides securing American gold for
his country, be has transferred some
American bronze to his own complex-
ion, and has, if anything, sharpened
his faculty for skilful evasion and polite
repartee by his encounters with Trans-
atlantic journalists.
In the course of the daily cate-
chism on the subject of air-raids Mr.
MACMASTER inquired, “Why is it that
Paris appears to be practically immune,
while London is not 2 " The answer
came, not from the Front Bench, but
from the Chair, and was delivered in a
tone so low that even the Official Re-
porter failed to catch it. That is a pity,
because it furnishes a useful hint for

futile or embarrassing questions about
the War, let them follow the SPEAKER's
example, and simply say, “You must

vote it was probably the cynical admis-
sion of the Attorney-GENERAL that he
was as much opposed to female suffrage
as ever, but meant to vote for it because
it was bound to come. This probably
had an even greater effect upon the
average Member, who is not an idealist,
than the nutshell novelette in which
Lord HUGH CECIL lightly outlined the
possible future of the female politician.

metaphors come naturally to the Duke

he was happily inspired when, in re-
minding the farmers of their duty to put
more land under the plough, he com-
pared the compulsory powers of the
Board of Agriculture to a sword in its
scabbard, and hoped there would be no
necessity to rattle it. Everybody knows
that the sword in question is a converted
ploughshare, and that it rests with the
War Office to turn it back again.
Last night fifty-five Members resisted
Votes for Women. By this afternoon
twenty-five of them had so far changed
their minds as to protest against the
limitation of the privilege to women
over thirty, Major Rowl. AND HUNT,
convinced that women would soon vote
themselves into the House, expressed
a naïve preference for “young 'uns.”
Thursday, June 21st.—During Sir
Edward GREY's long tenure of the
Foreign Secretaryship he rarely visited
the House of Commons 1...ore than
twice a week. Until his voyage to the
United States, Mr. BALFour was even
less attentive to his Parliamentary
duties and left most of the “donkey-
work”—if one may so describe the
business of answering the questions
of curious Members—to Lord Robert
CECIL. Since his return Mr. BALFou R
has developed a new zest for this pas-
time, and to-day for the third time
in succession appeared in his place.
Everybody is pleased to see him there,
except perhaps the curious Members
aforesaid, who find him even more chary
of information than his deputy. Had
not the PRESIDENT of the United States
said something about Alsace-Lorraine”
ventured Corporal LEEs-SMITH. Mr.
BALFour, fresh from the White House,
blandly replied, “I do not propose to
discuss President WILson's Notes.”
The notion, prevalent at the begin-
ning of the War, that every German
waiter was an emissary of the KAISER,
only awaiting “The Day” when he
should return to take a full revenge for
meagre gratuities, still subsists in cer-
tain minds. Mr. BRookies was mani-
festly disappointed when Dr. MAC-
NAMARA assured him that the aeronaut
|captured in the recent raid was not, as
he supposed, one of these returned
Ganymedes, but was making his first
appearance on English soil.

MR. PUNCH IN RUSSIA.
IN the last Epilogue, where Mr. Punch was described as paying a call upon our brave soldiers in a German
prison-camp, I confessed that I didn't understand how he got there in the body. To-day I have to report a far
simpler enterprise. This time he has merely been on a mission to Russia. Anybody can do that, unless the
Sailors' and Firemen's Union mistake him for Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD, and no one has yet made this error in
respect of Mr. Punch. - -
His brilliant mastery of the Russian language is a harder thing to believe; but, as nothing is said of an
interpreter, I must suppose that he had been quietly and painfully taking lessons in this very difficult tongue.
Anyhow, you must picture him, at some spot not specified, addressing a concourse of enthusiastic Revolutionaries.
I propose to give a brief summary of his speech, from which you will gather that he spoke to them like a
father, and that, while he showed a cordial sympathy with the cause of Russian freedom, he did not hesitate to
deliver himself of some very straight home-truths.
“Friends, Russians, Allies,” he began; “I come on behalf of my fellow-countrymen” (you know his touching
way of regarding himself as the medium of the best intelligence to be found in the British Empire) “to convey
their affectionate sympathy with you in your triumph over the tyranny of Tsardom. At first we took the natural
and hopeful view that your Revolution, supported by all that was noblest in all ranks of your society, was the
result of bitter dissatisfaction with the conduct of the War, and with the secret and sinister enemy influences
which were at work to ruin your chances in the common fight against Kaiserism.
“Yet it was immediately followed by wholesale desertions from the firing-line and a general disintegration
of military discipline. It seems, then, that we were wrong; for otherwise it would be a curious irony that a
movement designed for the better conduct of the War should produce a complete stagnation on your fighting
fronts; or, to look at it from another point of view, that a Revolution which owed its success to the War, since,
in such a war as this, the Army and the nation are one, should have, for its immediate consequence, an apparent
failure on your part to remember the purpose for which the War is being fought.
“No doubt many motives were at work, and it was perhaps natural that in the joy of your new-found free.
dom you should be tempted to forget the conditions that had made it possible, and to regard the War as some-
thing outside and remote, and its importance as small compared with the achievement of internal liberty.
“Well, we have tried patiently to see things with your eyes, and now you in your turn must please make
an effort to see them with ours. From the first, when we in England took on this War, we recognised that

422 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [JUNE 27, 1917.
the country which was bound to get most good out of it was Russia. For her we hoped that it was to be in
the fullest sense, a War of Liberation. Your Allies would win liberty from external menace, but you would also
see the bonds of internal tyranny broken. The TSAR, the little father of his people, had a chance, such as falls
to few, of giving to his nation something of the true freedom that we in England know.
“He missed his chance. We will not ask why, but he missed it. Yet by other means the War has been
for you a War of Liberation, and, if you break your pledge to see it through, you do not deserve your freedom.
Nay more, you run the risk of losing it; or, if, through the steadfastness of your sworn Allies, you keep it, then
you keep it at the cost of sacrificing the friendship and sympathy of all free nations who are fighting in the
cause of liberty; and, on those terms, your own freedom is not worth having.
“Some of you argue that Russia's pledge to her Allies was an Imperialist pledge and that you have the
right to ignore it. Have you forgotten so soon that the prime cause of Russia's entry into this quarrel was that
Austria had threatened to crush a free nation, Serbia, whose race and faith are yours? Besides, a pledge like
that is still a pledge, though governments may change. Would you have it so that no people, from this time
on, shall trust the word of Russia for fear that a new régime might repudiate it 2
“We have been patient and made allowances. We know that a great nation like yours cannot overthrow
an age-long tyranny without being shaken through every fibre of its being. Time was needed for you to recover
your balance and to resume a sane view of your obligations to others than yourselves. So we have been patient,
and are patient still, though the inaction on your Front and your withdrawal from your part in the common
struggle have made our burden in France far harder to bear.
“If you fail us, we shall no less fight on, we others. “We shall march prospering—not through your
presence.' We shall fight on till the ideals of Kaiserism, your worst enemy, are crushed. America, that great
Republic that loves peace as passionately as you, will take your place, will fill up the gap that you leave in the
ranks of those who fight for freedom. And we shall fight till we get the true peace that we want—not the
peace which some of you have advocated, fraternising with the common foe, listening to the specious pleas of
those who shirk the one test of their honesty when they are asked to revolt against a tyranny as least as deadly
as that which you have yourselves overthrown.
“But you will not fail us, I know. Your hearts, as a nation, were once in this War; heavy as our
sacrifices have been, yours have been heavier still. Why should you change? Why should the birth of your
own freedom be the death of your sympathy with the cause of the freedom of the world? No, you cannot fail
us; you are too great for that.
“Forgive me,” Mr. Punch concluded, “if, in speaking from a full heart, I have allowed myself an excess of
candour. At home they have always been very kind and let me have a charter to say just what I think; and
I have been doing it, without much distinction of persons, for seventy-five years and more. If to you, who have
been dumb so long, this seems beyond belief, permit me to offer you, with sincere affection and regard, a visible
proof of my privilege in the shape of my -
(Ønt jumbrel and fifty-second tolume."

“Oh, quite, quite,” agreed Percy.

“Dear, dear!” said Percy.

still in your car, with the descending
cataract. Over and over you are turned
in the seething waters, dashed against
rocks, hurled through ravines, and
finally you are given a sheer drop
down a perpendicular waterfall of
three hundred feet. Out of the white
foam formed in the bed of the waters
you emerge swimming strongly hand
over hand, until at last you reach the
broad waters of the placid river, and
finally the shore. Here you notice a
train passing some little distance away,
and in it, gazing out of one of the win-
dows, you observe—Bill, the murderer!
You at once start in pursuit; by a
superb effort you catch up the train,
and just succeed in swinging yourself
safely on board. You can do a little

with confidence.
“Just so,” pursued the producer.
“And now you find yourself confront-
ing the miscreant, Bill. The train is
passing through a city. It is on the
elevated railway. Bill makes a dash
for the door, springs out, and lands on

your leap being considerably greater,
because between his jump and yours the
train has proceeded a certain distance.”
“Precisely,” said Percy.
“Now there is a scramble over the
roof-tops. You climb up pipes, slide
down slates, leap across spaces between
separate houses, cling to coping stones,
and all that sort of thing.”
“I grasp the idea,” said Percy.
“At last Bill is seized with a no-
tion. He throws himself on to the
telephone wires, and, hanging by his
hands, manages to convey himself
across to the houses on the opposite side
of the road. You imitate him. As Bill
arrives on the other side, he turns and
cuts the wires on which
you are crossing. Before
the ends of the wires fall,
however, you turn a quick
somersault and land beside
Bill. Once more there is
a race over the roofs un-
til Bill reaches a factory

he dives. So do you. Into

MEHMED of TURKEY DRIVEs of F FROM THE FIRST TEE.
LIKE the enemy, Mr. Punch also has
projected himself “in front of the front,”
and, in a moment of prophetic inspira-
tion, anticipated the following account,
from the pen of his Special Correspond-
ent, of a post-bellum competition on
the St. Helena links:–
“The life of our royal
captives in the internment
camp at St. Helena is the
subject of a report from
the Governor of the Island,
which was issued last night
as a Purple Paper.The Gov-
ernor, after dealing with
general matters, writes:—
“In the interests of -
health I have permitted as
the less exalted members -
of the camp to lay out a
small golf course within
the enclosed area, and
yesterday the links were
mony taking the form of º
a four-ball competition, in S
which the German CRowN
PRINCE was partnered with
FRANCIS-Joseph of Austria
against FERDINAND of Bul-
garia and MEHMED of Tur-
key. Although present at
the proceedings I feel that I cannot do
better than include in my report an
account of the contest which appeared
in The St. Helena Sentimel.’”
