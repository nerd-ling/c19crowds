MENTIONED IN DESPATCHES.
THE oldest inhabitant sat on a bench
in the sun, the day's newspaper spread
across his knees, and the newest visitor
sat beside him.
“He do be mentioned in despatches,
do our Billy, by Sir Douglas HAIG

THE MELTING-POT.
[“The municipality of Rothausen has-decided to present to the
collection of metal which is being made in Germany its monument of
Kaiser WILLIAM THE FIRST.”—Reuter.]
- HEAvy is Armageddon's price
And loud the call to sacrifice;
All stuff composed of likely metals— -
Door-knockers, hairpins, cans and kettles—
Into the War's insatiate melting-pot
Has to be shot.
That was a hard and bitter blow
When first your church-bells had to go—
Those saintly bells that rang carillons
While in..the maw of happy millions
Pure joy and gratitude to Heaven thrilled
For babies killed.
It hurt your Christian hearts to melt
A source of faith so keenly felt;
And now (worse sacrilege than that) you
Propose to take yon regal statue,
That godlike effigy, and make a gun
Of WILLIAM ONE |
What will He say when you reduce
His Relative to cannon-juice 2
The prospect must be pretty rotten
If thus the Never-To-Be-Forgotten
Is treated, like the corpses of your friends,
For useful ends.
I hear the ALL-HIGHEST mutter, “Ha!
They're liquefying Grandpapal
The nation's needs, that grow acuter,
Count sacred things as so much pewter;
Even my holy crown may go some day
Down the red way!” O. S.
LE SéNÉGALAIs.
Samédou Kieta sat up in bed with a child's primer open
before him. “M–A,” he spelled. Then, after an in-
credibly long time of patient puzzling, “M–A—MA. Oui,
MA. Y a bon' " and embraced the whole ward in one
wide white grin before turning to the next syllable,
“M–A–N.” Once more the puzzled frown on the black
face, once more the whispered hints from neighbouring
beds, once more the triumph of perseverance, “M–A–N–
MAN!” He was just enjoying his success and chanting
his pidgin-French paean of happiness, “Y a bon! Y a
bon!” when Soeur Antoinette paused by his bed. “Très
bien, Sidi,” she said, “mais il faut les mettre ensemble,”
and with her white finger she guided his black one back
to the first syllable.
Here was difficulty indeed! He knew all right that
M–A–N was MAN, but what was M–A 2 And when,
after intense effort, he re-discovered that M-A spelled
MA, it was only to find that he had forgotten what
M–A–N spelled. At last the other wounded could con-
tain themselves no longer, and the ward was filled with
laughing shouts of “Maman'" in which Samédou joined
most happily.
Presently the English nurse passed the negro's bed, and
he at once turned to another branch of learning. “Good
morning,” he said, and, when she smiled back a greeting
to him, he added, “T'ank you,” and looked proudly round
him at his fellow-patients as who should say, “See how
we understand one another, she and I' "
During a sojourn of many months in the hospital Samédou
invariably met the sufferings he was called upon to endure
with an uncomplaining fortitude, which might have seemed
due to insensibility had not the staff had ample proof that
his silence was the silence of a fine courage. On one
occasion a set of photographs of the hospital was in pre-
paration, and when the salle de pansements had to be taken
the photographer decided that the best lay figure for his
mise-en-scène would be a black man, as a striking contrast
to the white raiment of the staff. So Samédou was carried
in on a stretcher and laid upon the table. Unfortunately
the surgeons and nurses were so occupied with the business
of placing things in the best light that no one realised
that the poor Senegalese did not understand the purpose of
the preparations, and when the English nurse was called
to take up her position she noticed the hands of Samédou
Kieta clutching the sides of the table and his black eyes
rolling in a sea of white.
She at once ran to the nearest ward. “Quelqu'un
voudrait bien me préter une photographie 2" she asked,
and a dozen eager hands offered her the treasured groups of
la famille. Taking one at random she returned to Samédou
and held it before his eyes. “Nous aussi,” she said, “toi,
moi, le Major, l'infirmier.”
Samédou looked, and a heavenly relief chased the tension
from his face. “Y a bon,” he said happily. “Toi, bon
camarade l''
When his wounds began to be less painful the problem
was how to keep the Sidi in bed. No one cared to be very
severe with him, so the staff resorted to the usual weak
method of confiscating all his clothes save a shirt, and
hoping for the best. But one day the English nurse, going
unexpectedly into a distant ward, came upon Samédou
Kieta, simply dressed in a single shirt and a bandage,
visiting the freshly-airived wounded and scattering wide
grins around him. At her horrified exclamation he began
to shrivel away towards the door, ushering himself out
with the propitiatory words, “Good morning. Good night.
Tank you. Water ' " A most effectual method of disarm-
ing reproof.
Poor Samédou has since passed on to another hospital
for electric treatment, but the staff still treasures his first
and only letter:—
“Moi, Samédou Kieta, arrivé à l'autre hôpital. Y a bon.
Mais moi, Samédou Kieta, toi pas oublié. Merci, Monsieur
le Major-deux galons. Merci, Soeur Antoinette. Merci,
Madame l'Anglaise. Y a bon. Y a bon. Y a bon.”
“The Germans have suffered 100,000 casualties in 10 days on the
western front, and their losses will increase rapidly. They must
shorten their lives wherever possible in order to save men.”
Ceylon Morning Leader.
In this laudable endeavour they may count upon receiving
the hearty assistance of the Allies.
“YouNG gentleman (21), good family, strong, healthy, public school,
O.T.C., 'Varsity education, speaks English, French, Spanish perfectly,
engineering training, efficient car driver and mechanic, horseman, is
open to any sporting job connected with war; willing undertake any
risks; no salary, but expenses paid.”
If the advertiser will apply to the nearest recruiting-station
he will hear of something that will just suit him.
“The inhabitants of the Peak district are in a state of great alarm
at the invasion of a great part of their beautiful country by what
some of them describe as a plague of locusts, and yesterday consider-
able numbers of people visited the district where the hosts are still
advancing. Many from Sheffield and Manchester alighted at Chinley,
Edale, and Hope, among them some eminent etymologists, anxious
to be of assistance in ridding the country of a serious menace to the
field and garden crops.”—Yorkshire Paper.
It is understood that the etymologists are chiefly concerned
for the roots.

THE ABSENTEE.
(Embodying divers quotations from the poems of G. K. C.)
METHINKs at last the time has come to speak . . .
Since good old Russia up and revoluted
I have been waiting, week by weary week,
To hear the news—the obvious item—bruited ;
But now I give it up; it will not come;
Or anyway I can no more be dumb.
Where were you, GILBERT, when the great release—
“Freedom in arms, the riding and the routing,”
Demos superbly potting at police,
And actual swords getting an actual outing—
Came at the last, the things wherein you shone,
Or let us think you'd shine in, CHESTERTON?
You were not there ! Damme, you were not there !
Alas for us whose faith refused to doubt you!
“All that lost riot that you did not share”
Managed, somehow, to get along without you ;
When Russia “went to battle for the creed"
GILBERT sat tight and did not even bleed!
CHESTERTON | Dash it all, my dear old chap!
Why, weren't you always eloquent on “Valmy,”
“Death and the splendour of the scarlet cap”?
Here were the days you looked upon as palmy.
Just think of all your poems' Why, good Lord,
There is no word you work so hard as “sword.”
We looked to see you there, the stout and staunch,
“Red flag” in one hand and “ten swords” in tother;
Saw the strong sword-belt bursting from your paunch :
Pitied the foes you'd fall upon and smother;
Heard you make droves of pale policemen bleat,
Running amok to “slay them in the street.”
Strong athwart Heav'n ran the high barricades,
And giant Bastilles reeled, impossibly smitten,
And men with broken hands swung thunderous blades
In “Russia's wrath"—just as you’ve often written;
Yea, the terrific tyrants really reeled,
While CHESTERTON sat safe at Beaconsfield.
And yet—I understand; I don't impute
That only in your poems do you bicker;
You would abstain, when people revolute,
No more, I'm sure, than you’d abstain from liquor;
And here we have it—here's the reason why:
This was a revolution that was “dry.”
The Eagle's Plume.
“The bride, who is an American by birth, was given away by her
feather.”—Liverpool Daily Post.
“Mr., Mrs. and Miss , who were in their bungalow at Sidbar,
had a lucky escape from the earthquake recently, for no sooner had
they ot out than gpractically the whole house cae mdown.”
Pioneer (Allahabad).
On this occasion, contrary to the usual rule, Nature appears
to have been more careful of the individual than of the type.
“You, too, reader, if you have not already visited 's, have a
pleasant, bright happy experience before you. Why not visit this
modern Forum to-morrow 2 "
“Callisthenes '' in the evening papers, June 23rd.
One of our reasons for not taking this well-meant advice
was that June 24th was a Sunday.
“Great fires continue in Germany. The latest include gutting
of the Moabit Goods Station in Berlin wherein tanks of petrol,
hydrogen, et cetera, exploded, resulting in the destruction of a part
of Vilna and the township of Osjory, near the Grodno conflagration
station and a basket factory at Happe.”–Ceylon Independent.
The effect of this remarkably extensive explosion seems to
have been felt even in Colombo.

WOMAN AS USUAL.
(In the manner of some of our own
evening papers.)
It was with a real pang that I tore
myself away from the Frugality Exhi-
bition, where the culinary demonstra-
tions were most enthralling. Just
before leaving, however, I watched a
wonderfully tasty hash being com-
pounded with oddments of rabbit and
banana flour. It exhaled an aroma
which I hated to leave—even for
luncheon at the Fitz.
AT THE FITz.
By a strange coincidence I made the
acquaintance of an admirable rabbit
goulash, which was, I believe, identical
with that which I saw being prepared
at the Frugality Exhibition. Thus
extremes meet, and the fusion of classes
is happily illustrated in the common
use of the same comestibles.
There are always a number of people
lunching in the great hotels in these
war-time days, and I was glad to see
Lady Allchin, looking remarkably well-
nourished in a mauve Graeco-Roman
dress and Gainsborough hat; Lady
Waterstock, Lord Hilary Sprockett
and Sir Peter Frye-Smith.
YESTERDAY's WEDDING.
Lady Carmilla Dunstable made a
lovely bride at St. Mungo's, Belgravia,
yesterday, on her marriage to Prince
Wurra - Wurra, of Tierra-del-Fuego.
The story of the engagement is wildly
romantic. Lady Carmilla was returning
from Peru, where she had been hunting
armadillos; the ship in which she was
travelling was wrecked in the Straits
of Magellan, and she was rescued by
Prince Wurra Wurra, who was casually
cruising about in his catamaran. Her
family were for some time hostile to
the match, but all objections were soon
removed, as the Prince has abjured
cannibalism and is now an uncompro-
mising vegetarian. The bridegroom,
who is a fine-looking man of the pro-
gnathous type, was loudly cheered by
the crowd on leaving the church.
A CHARMING CoNCERT.
All true melomaniacs will rejoice to
hear that the Signora Balmi-Dotti has
decided to give another vocal recital at
the Dorian Hall. Her programme as
usual reflects her catholic and cosmo-
politan taste, for she will sing not only
Welsh and Cornish folk-songs, but
works by PALESTRINA, Gasolini, Larra-
naga, Sparafucile, and the young Ameri-
can composer, Ploffskin Jee, so that both
classical and modern masters will be
represented.
Two RECIPEs For TEA CAREs.

at teas in these days, but in hot weather,
when luncheon is reduced to the lowest
common denominator and dinner re-
solves itself into a cold collation in the
cool of the evening, some refreshment
between our second and third meals is
indispensable. I accordingly give two
recipes which need no wheaten flour
and are very quickly made.
Take half-a-pound of sugar, a quarter
of caviare, a quarter of calipash, a
quarter of millet and six peaches. Beat
the caviare to a cream and pound the
peaches to a pulp; then add the sugar
and millet and stir vigorously with a
mirliton. Put into patty-pans and bake
gently for about thirty minutes in an
electric silo-oven. About thirty cakes
should result; but more will materialize
if you increase the ingredients propor-
tionately.
Take two kilowatts of ammoniated
quinine and beat up with one very
large egg—a swan's for choice. Add
gradually ten ounces of piperazine, a
pint of Harrogate water and inhale
leisurely through a zoetrope.
MELISANDE.

“Munition Lady wants to buy Piano and
Wardrobe; cash.”—North Star.
“Goats' cheese is tasty and nourishing and
more easily made than butter; and in winter
time the humblest of sheds will suffice for its
sleeping place.”—Daily Mail.
The cheese should however be carefully
tethered.

THROUGH many a busy year of peace
I hoped some day, by way of beano,
To give myself a jaunt in Greece,
Famed land of Hoxier (also TINo).
Full oſt I dreamed how, blest by Fate,
I'd loll within some leafy hollow
With Aphrodite tete-à-téte
Or barter back-chat with Apollo.
Around Olympus' foot I'd roam
(Not being really fond of climbing),
Absorb romance and carry home
Increased facility at rhyming;
Those hallowed haunts of many a god
That nowadays we only read of
Would give my Pegasus the prod
He not unseldom stood in need of.
That was in Peace. And then the War
Sent me to learn within a hutment
What martial duties held in store
And what a sergeant-major's “Tut"
meant ;
Thence to the trenches, thence a rest,
A route-march to a wayside station,
With (every single soldier guessed)
Greece as our “unknown destination."
I saw Olympus wrapped in snow,
The clouds at rest upon its summit,
But did I thrill or long to throw
My hands athwart the lyre and
strum it?
Gazing, I felt no soulful throb,
I only felt the body's inner
Cravings and said, “I’ll bet a bob
It's bully once again for dinner."
“Ex-King Constantine has bought a mag-
nificent château called Chartreuse, situated
near Thun Castle. It belonged to Baron von

Well, he will be able to fill himself up

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 25th.-Mr. LYNCH is
beginning to pine for the return of
Lord RoberT CECIL. He does not
quite know what to make of Mr. BAL-
Four, who politely represses his honest
endeavours to elucidate the situation
that the difficulties of the
Allies would only be increased
by the hon. Member's at-
tempts to deal with them
piecemeal. Mr. LYNCH was
not entirely done with, how- ºss
ever. “Is that reply,” he
asked in a “got - him - this-
time” manner, “given by
reason of freedom of choice
or ineludible necessity ? "
“Sir,” replied the apologist of
philosophic doubt with John-
sonian authority, “questions
of freewill and necessity have
perplexed mankind for ages.”
The House will be delighted to wel-
come back to its fold Sir RoberT
HERMAN-Hodge, whose flowing mous-
taches, once described as “the best
definition of infinity,” have been, at
intervals, its pride and joy for over
thirty years. But it will have to wait
a while, for—strange lapse on the
part of a hero of half-a-dozen con-
tests l—Sir Robert had omitted to
bring with him the returning-officer's
certificate. Lord HALSBURY, delayed
by a similar accident on his first ap-
pearance in the House forty years ago,
systematically turned out the contents
of seemingly endless pockets and event-
ually discovered the missing document
in his hat.
At this crisis in Ireland's affairs you
might suppose that all good Nationalists
would remain in their country, doing
their best to make the Convention a
success. Mr. DILLON prefers to attack
the Government at Westminster, be-
cause it proposes to set up a Conference
to consider the future composition and
powers of the Second Chamber. Was
it not, he asked, a breach of privilege to
do this without the express consent of
the House of Commons 2 The SPEAKER
thought not, and referred his questioner
to the preamble of the Parliament Act
of 1911, in which such action was dis-
tinctly contemplated. Mr. DILLON,
thus suddenly transported to the dear
dead days before the War, when he was
hand-in-glove with the present PRIME
MINISTER, considers that Mr. LowTHER
is open to censure for possessing a
memory of such indecent length and
accuracy.
Tuesday, June 26th.-A gentle crea-
ture at ordinary times, Lord STRACHIE
has been roused to unexpected ferocity
in Greece, and actually declared to-day of which, like every nation engaged in
by the German air-raids, and advocates |store of commonsense that he brought
a policy of unmitigated reprisals upon back with him from the trenches at
the enemy's cities,
been successful he would have been
recorded in history as the mildest-
mannered man that ever bombed a
German baby. But Lord DERBY would
have none of it. British aeroplanes—

have championed the cause of Mrs.
ANNIE BESANT, upon whose activities
the Government of Madras have im-
posed certain salutary restrictions.
What India wants, I understand, is
less Besant and more Rice.
Now that young soldiers
are to have votes as a reward
for fighting there is logically
a strong argument for taking
away the franchise from those
who have refused to fight.
It was well expressed by Mr.
RoNALD McNEILL and others,
but, apart from the objec-
§ tions urged on high religious
grounds by Lord HUGH
CECIL, the Government was
probably right in resisting
the proposal. Parliament
made a mistake in ever giving
a statutory exemption to
the conscientious objector. The most
that person could claim was that he
should not be called upon to take other
people's lives; he had no right to be
excused from risking his own. But
having deliberately provided a loophole
it is hardly fair for Parliament to inflict
a penalty upon those who creep through
it. And so the House thought, for it
rejected the proposal by a two-to-one
majority.
Wednesday, June 27th.-There is a
general impression that membership of
the House of Commons is in itself a
sufficient excuse for the avoidance of
military service. This, it appears, is
erroneous. Only those are exempt
whom a Medical Board has declared
unfit for general service; and even
these, according to Mr. FoESTER, may
now be re-examined. This ought to
prove a great comfort to certain poten-
tial heroes.
Thursday, June 28th.-Mr. Joseph
KING's chief concern at the moment is
to get Lord HARDINGE removed from
the Foreign Office, where he suspects
him of concocting the devastating an-
swers with which Mr. BALFour re-
presses impertinent curiosity. Accord-
ingly he raked up the old story of Lord
HARDINGE's letter to Sir G. BUCHANAN,
and inquired what action the FoREIGN
SECRETARY proposed to take. Mr. BAL-
Four proposed to take no action. The
letter was a private communication,
which would never have been heard of
but for its capture by a German sub-
marine. Even Mr. KING's own corre-
spondence, he suggested, could hardly
be so dull that everything in it would
bear publication.
Mr. KING justly resented this im-
putation. Dull? Why, only this week

A RESOLUTION.
1'LL tell you what I mean to do
When these our wars shall cease to
rage: -
I'll go where Summer skies are blue
And Spring enjoys her heritage;
I shall not work for fame or wage,
But wear a large black silk cravat,
A velvet coat that's grey with age
Beneath a high-crowned broad-
brimmed hat.
I'll journey to some Tuscan town
And rent a palace for a song,
And all the walls I'll whitewash down
Some day when I am feeling strong;
And there I'll pass my days among
My books, and, when my reading palls
And Summer days are overlong,
I'll daub up frescoes on the walls.
The world may go her divers ways
The while I draw or write or smoke,
Happy to live laborious days
There among simple painter folk;
To wed the olive and the oak,
Most patiently to woo the Muse,
And wear a great big Tuscan cloak
To guard against the heavy dews.
Between the olive and the vine
I'll make heroic mock of Mars,
And drink at even golden wine
Kept cool in terra-cotta jars;
And afterwards harangue the stars
In little gems of fervid speech,
And smoke impossible cigars
Which cost at least three soldi each.
Let more ambitious spirits spin
The web of life for weal or woe,
Whilst I above my violin
Shall sit and watch the vale below
All crimson in the afterglow ;
And when the patient stars grow bright
I'll draw across the strings my bow
Till CHOPIN ushers in the night.
Such things as these I mean to do
When Peace once more resumes her
sway;
To walk barefooted through the dew
And while the sunlit hours away,
If haply I may find some gay
Conceit to light a sombre mind,
As gracious as a Summer day,
As wayward as an April wind.
A Legitimate Inference.

THE TWO MISSING NUMBERS.
A CoNTRAST.
I.
My friend X. is normally the mildest
of men. His temper is under perfect
control; and in his favourite part of
the angels' advocate he finds palliations
and makes allowances for all those de-
fections in the servants of the public
which goad men to fury and which,
since the War came in to supply in-
competence with a cloak and a pretext,
have been exasperatingly on the in-
crease. Thus, serene and considerate,
has X. gone his uncomplaining way for
years.
But yesterday I found him on the
kerb in the Strand inarticulate and
purple with rage. His face was hardly
recognisable, so distorted were those
taxi.
Fearing that he might
be ill I took his arm; but
he flung himself free.
“Don't touch me,” he
said; “I can't bear it.”
Having reached a point in
life when tact is second
nature, I waited silently .
near him until the storm | *
should have passed.
His eyes were still fixed. .
After a short time he
recovered sufficiently to
turn to me and explain.
“I could have killed
that fellow,” he said.
“What fellow 2 ”

went by slowly with his flag up and
wouldn't look at me. I hailed him,
and I know he heard, but he wouldn't
look at me. Now I don't mind when
they point, or make any kind of sign
that they don't want to be hired, or
say that they have no petrol, even if
I don't believe it; but when they
won't turn their heads or pay any
attention whatever I could kill them.
And there's such a lot of them like
that. I swear,” he went on, begin-
ning to go purple again—“I swear
that, if I had had a revolver just now,
I should have shot him. When one
man hails another, the man who is
hailed must give some kind of an indi-
cation. It's only human. Society
would fall to pieces if we all behaved
like that chap. It's awful, awful! If
I'd only thought of taking his number
I'd run him in, and I'd carry it to the
House of Lords if necessary. Such
men—ugh 1”
He broke down, smothered by right-
eous anger. .
“Good heavens !” he exclaimed as I

II.
The same night a miracle happened.
It was very late, and the débris of a
little charity performance at an as-
sembly-room had to be cleared away.
The last guests had gone—in this or
that conveyance, or on our best friends
in war-time, the feet—and that hunt
for a taxi, which has now taken the
place of all other sport, was being pro-
secuted with more or less energy by a
policeman, a loafer and two or three
amateurs, all of whom returned at
intervals while the packing-up was in
progress, to say how hopeless the case
was and how independent the men
had become.
One passing cab I hailed myself, but
he did no more than laugh a loud laugh
of mere incivility and ironically remark,
“SMART GIRL, THAT Nºw Gover NEss–GoT ME to Look AT THE
He TAPESTRY WHILE SHE PINCHED MY BREAD !”
we got to the other end insisted on
carrying some of the bundles up three
flights of stairs, and had no objection to
make when asked to wait a little longer
and go on elsewhere.
All this time I was, I need hardly
say, in a dream. Could it be true?
Could it 2
And when he was at last paid off he
said both “Good night” and “Thank
you," although it was I in whom grati-
tude should have thus vocally burned.
Perhaps it did ; I was too dazed to
remember.
How I wish I had taken his number,
that all the world might know it and
look for it, assured of a gentleman on

So you see there are both kinds of
taxi-drivers still—only the bad ones are
more difficult to get hold of.

stood it, that nothing on earth should
interfere with his homeward journey
that night, since he had done enough
and was tired, but that on the succeed-
ing day, if I still required his services,
he was at my disposal.
The various bags and parcels being
now all ready, we waited patiently in
the hall, and from time to time received
reports as to the progress of the chase.
At last, when things seemed really
hopeless, a taxi arrived, driven by a
young man in spectacles, which were, I
am convinced, part of a disguise cover-
ing one of the noblest personalities in
the land—some Haroun al Raschid,
filled with pity for lost Londoners, who
is devoting his life to redressing the
wrongs inflicted upon poor humanity
by taxi tyrants—for he said nothing
about having no petrol, nothing about
the lateness of the hour, nothing about
the direction in which we wished to
go, but quietly and efficiently helped
to get the things in and on the cab;
and then drove swiftly away, and when

PUNCH,
TO LORD RHONDDA.
DEAR LoRD RHONDDA,-When you
were an unassuming undergraduate at
Caius College, spending your leisure-
time in an eight- or a pair-oar, and
stirring up the muddy shallows of the
Cam, as you did to some purpose, I
cannot believe that any premonitions
of the heights of celebrity to which
you would some day attain disturbed
your mind. And yet here you are, a
survivor from the foul and murderous
shattering of the Lusitania, a coal-
owner, a member of the Government,
a peer, and the Food-Controller of a
whole nation at war.
Your predecessor, Lord DEvoNPoRT,
had no very happy experience of the
post you now hold, and I can well
understand that his life during his
tenure of it cannot have been a pleasant
one. Every crank with an infallible
recipe for catching sunbeams in cu-
cumber-frames and turning them into
potatoes, or whatever might be the
fashionable food at the moment; every
grumbler who imagined that every rise
in prices must be entirely due to the
malignity of men and not to the scarcity
of the article; every politician with a
grudge to satisfy or an axe to grind—
all these pounced upon Lord DEvoNPORT
as a victim made ready to their hands,
and gave him a time which can only be
described as a very bad one. Add to
this the mistakes almost necessarily
made by an office which was entirely
new and dealt with unexampled con-
ditions, and it is not on the whole
surprising that difficulties were en-
countered and that the right way for
overcoming them was not always taken.
Indeed there was or there seemed to be
at one time a lively controversy between
Lord DEvoNPort and Mr. PRoth ERO
about the true meaning of the words
maximum and minimum as applied to
prices, and we were left to infer that
these Latin monsters are virtually in-
distinguishable from one another.
However, all that is now over; Lord
RHoNDDA reigns in Lord DEvoNPoRT's
place and can profit by his experience.
I don't want to delude you into the
belief that all is plain sailing for you.
You couldn't be made to believe that
if I tried for a month of Sundays, and
I don't mean to spend my time to no
purpose. But I think the great body
of the nation is determined that you
shall have fair play and will support you |
through thick and thin in any policy,
no matter how drastic, that you may
recommend to their reason and their
patriotism. This business of food-con-
trolling is new to us as well as to you,
but we are willing to be led, we are
even willing to be driven, and we are

grateful to you for having engaged your
reputation and your skill and your firm-

of his fellow-men we look to you to
give him short shrift.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
THE ROYALTY TRIPLE BILL.
FIRST a quite charming and, what is
not so usual, a quite intelligible fantasy
in mime—The Magic Pipe : Pierrot,
faithless mistress, despair, sympathetic
friend, adoring midinette, and so on.
But Mr. JULES DELACRE, who played
his own part, Pierrot, with a fine sin-
cerity and a sense of the great tradition
in this genre, got his effect across to us
with an admirable directness. Miss
PHYLLIS PINsoN looking charming in a
mid-Victorian Latin-Quarterly sort of
way (which is a very nice way), danced
seriously, fantastically, delightfully, and
with quite astonishing command of her
technique—the sort of thing that nine
infallible managers out of ten who
know what the public wants would
condemn out of hand as impossible.
The intelligent tenth must have been
consoled by the enthusiastic applause
which greeted the little piece. I have
a fancy that mime would go far to
restore sanity and tradition to the
English stage, and every creditable
essay in a delightful art deserves the
fullest support.
It is amusing to see our solemn
Mr. John GALsworthy in labour for
three Acts over a rude joke. I frankly
confess I enjoyed the joke. Cisterns (its
theme) have no terrors for me even in
mixed company. But the joke was not
the really serious thing about The Foun-
dations, a play that starts (some years
hence) with a mob of starving people
yelling outside the house—dear, stupid,
kindly Lord William Dromondy's house.
Lord William was a god of an infantry
captain in the great War, and his four
footmen—particularly James, the first
of them—though revolutionaries at
heart, are ready to stand between their
master and any other revolutionaries in
London town. Well, a bomb is found
in the foundations of Lord William's
Park Lane palace, and explodes to em-
barrassed laughter of shocked stall-
holders in the Third Act.
The plot's nothing, and the main
joke, as I say, nothing to get excited
over. But the whole effect of the tre-
mendous trifle, admirably cast as it
was, was diverting in the extreme.
Of course it is like our Mr. GALS-
worthy to assume that things will be as
black as ever a few years hence. 'Tis,
no doubt, what encourages us to keep
our end up in the great War. But we
know the customs of leopards, and can
forgive our pessimist for his creations
(for all the world as if he were a
milliner) of Poulder, Lord William's
butler, rounded pillar of the eternal old
order of things; of James, revolutionary
but faithful (of course James never
would in fact have kept this absurd
job); of a light yellow pressman; of a
feckless, torrentially eloquent plumber,
whose solution of the class war was
loving-kindness and the letting of the
blood of all who were not kind.
Mr. EADIE was a beloved vagabond
of a plumber doing a fine part on his
head, as is his way nowadays. But the
thing is so good that it is perhaps un-
gracious to remind him he could make it
better. Mr. SIDNEY PAxton's triumph
with Poulder was his admirable re-
straint — rarest of accomplishments
among comic stage butlers. The effect
of everything was heightened by this
excellent economy. It was a lesson in
artistic reticence. An even more notable
feat in the same kind was The Press

of Mr. LAwRENCE HANRAY. Obviously
he could have collected a good deal
more of the laughter of the house if he
had played less subtly. I should put
it as quite the best piece of playing
in a well-played piece. Mr. DAwson
MILwaRD has made a deserved reputa-
tion as the strong silly ass. He sus-
tained it—with something in hand. Mr.
STEPHEN EwART's James was a quite ex-
cellent performance, not very coherent
and consistent in conception on the
author's part, perhaps, and on that
account all the more difficult. Miss
EsMÉ HUBBARD gave us pathos skil-
fully reserved in her clever study of an
old, old countrywoman turned trousers-
maker; and little DINKASTARACE showed
quite astonishing aptitude (or the most
wonderful training) in the part of her
granddaughter. . . Miss BABs FARREN
also did well with her rather intrusive
part of Lord William's daughter.

whole Flying Corps to dereliction of
duty. Mr. FRANK BAYLY had just that
air of awkward modesty which is so
much more effective than plain swank
as an advertisement of gallantry, and
Miss MURIELPoPE played a programme-
girl with all the skill that an artist thinks
is worth putting into little things.

THERE used to be fairies in Germany—
I know, for I've seen them there
In a great cool wood where the tall
trees stood
With their heads high up in the air;
They scrambled about in the forest
And nobody seemed to mind;
They were dear little things (tho' they
didn't have wings)
And they smiled and their eyes were
kind.
What, and oh what were they doing
To let things happen like this?
How could it be? And didn't they
See
That folk were going amiss 2
Were they too busy playing,
Or can they perhaps have slept,
That never they heard an ominous word
That stealthily crept and crept 2
There used to be fairies in Germany—
The children will look for them still ;
They will search all about till the sun-
light slips out
And the trees stand frowning and
chill. -
“The flowers,” they will say, “have all
vanished,
And where can the fairies be fled
That played in the fern?”—The flowers
will return,
But I fear that the fairies are dead.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I should like to commend with extraordinarily little
reserve Mr. FIELDING-HALL's The Way of Peace (HURST
AND BLACKETT) to the kind of reader that is drawing plans
in his head for a New England. No wonder that in these
great days the impatient idealist rushes forth with his bag
of dreams. The author of The Soul of a People is extreme
but sane—an extremist in common sense, say. He stakes
on the fact of human solidarity as the cure for the bitter-
nesses and crookednesses of politics; declares life and men
to be good, not evil (how right he is l); wants an England
rescued from the Puritans on the one hand and the mere
musical comedians on the other; an England chaste because
freer, less ignorant; good beer in easeful inns; the village
or township as the unit of government and of fellowship;
a return to music and the dance, not as a plasmon-fed high-
brow proposition but as the natural expression of a joy of
life returned; a clear fount of honour; a representative
House of Commons; justice, respect, common sense and
responsibility instead of charity; some place other than the
streets for our young men and maidens to make love in; a
recognition of crime as mainly a social, not an individual,
disease; a law simplified and scales of justice not weighted
against the poor; and a host of other good and wise and
nearly possible things. Here is not the barren politics of
manipulation but an ideal of living citizenship. I commend
it to all believers in new days and all honourable dis-
gruntlers; not perhaps as a programme but as a tonic.
Do not, please, run away with the idea that The Nursery
(HEINEMANN) presents us with Mr. EDEN PHILLPoTTs’ views
on baby culture. The background of his story, the scenes
of which are laid in and around Colchester a year or so ago,
is composed of gardens and oyster-beds. On these he gives
a lot of information, and, as he could not be pedantic even if
he tried to be, I browsed pleasantly upon the store of know-
ledge set before me. Also I liked the restraint he shows in
dealing with the War, and commend his exemplary method
to some of our more blatant novelists. When, however,
I came to the inhabitants of The Nursery I failed to find
in them that rare and delightful quality with which Mr.
PHILLPQTTs usually succeeds in endowing his characters.
Readers of his novels must know by this time that he is
not exactly in love with Mrs. Grundy, but here he seems to
be insurgent against something, and for the life of me I
don't know quite what it is. Perhaps it is insincerity,
which is a very good thing to be in rebellion against. There
is one very amusing and delightful character, a bibulous
old sinner who defied law and order and almost at the last
gasp ladled out what he considered justice in a mcst
dramatic manner. His name is William Ambrose, and it is
worth your while to make his disreputable acqaintance.
One fact at once awakened in me a fellow-feeling for
Mr. BERTRAM SMITH-the discovery of his appreciation
(shared by myself, the elder STEVENsoN, and other persons
of discernment) for the romantic possibilities of the map.
There is an excellent map in the beginning of Days of
Discovery (CoNSTABLE), showing the peculiar domain of
childhood, the garden, in terms that will hardly fail to win
your sympathy. But not in this alone does Mr. SMITH
show that he has the heart of the matter in him; every
page of these reminiscences of nursery life proclaims a
genuine memory, not a make-believe childhood faked up for
literary ends. Who that has once been young can read
unstirred by envy the chapter on “Devices and Contriv-

ances,” with its entrancing triumph of the chain of mirrors
arranged (during the providential absence of those in
authority) from the night nursery, down two flights of
stairs, to the store-room in the basement 2 I know a
reviewer whom nothing but moral cowardice restrained
from testing the possibility of this delightful plan by per-
sonal experiment. Fireworks too—Mr. SMITH has remem-
bered them with a proper regard that is, of course, wholly
different from that of those who understand them only in
their pyrotechnic aspect, not as objects loved for themselves
alone, for their shape and feel, and the glamour of weeks
of hoarding and barter. In short, a real nursery book for the
study; not one perhaps that actual children would care for
(quite possibly they might resent it as betrayal), but one
that for the less fortunate will reopen a door of which too
many of us have long lost the key.
What I found strangest in the Transactions of Lord
Louis Lewis (MURRAY) is that it is a story, or rather series
of stories, about rogues, in which trickery is invariably
vanquished—a refreshing con-ſ
trast to the methods of most
of our romanticists, who are
given to a certain courtier-
like attitude towards the law-
breaker. Certainly that various
artist, Mr. Roland PERTwee,
has contrived to put together
a highly entertaining collec-
tion of diamond-cut-diamond
yarns, adventure tales that
have the great advantage (for ||
these days) of being concerned,
not with bloodshed and mys-
terious murders, but with the
wiles of dealers in the spurious
antique and the exploits of
Lord Louis in defeating them.
This Lord Louis is indeed a
very pleasant as well as a
very ingenious gentleman.
From the rotundity of his
conversational periods and a
certain general suavity of de-
meanour I suspect him of
having made a careful study "** -
of the methods of his distinguished predecessor in rogue-
reducing, Prince Florizel of Bohemia. But he is, of course,
none the worse company for that. Once, however, he
shocked me badly, when, in perusing an eighteenth-century
MS., he—I can hardly bring myself to quote the passageſ
—he “moistened his finger and turned over three pages.”
And this of a nobleman and a connoisseur ! Oh, Mr.
PERTwee". Having said so much, it is only fair that I
should call your special attention to one of the stories,
“The House in Bath,” an exquisite little gem of consider-
ably higher art than is usually associated with such
“Exploits of the Event.”

You might perhaps allow yourself to be put off by such a
title as Home Truths about the War (ALLEN), because it,
or something like it, has so often been used as the prelim-
inary to alarming or disagreeable statements that we have
grown excusably suspicious. But to avoid on this account
the letters that the Rev. HUGH CHAPMAN has here brought
together would be to miss a very original and inspiring
purchase a portrait enlargement). “You R AdvKRTISEMENT SAYs,

MENT CAREFULLY YOU WILL NOTE THAT IT DOES NOT SPECIFY
little book. Let me say at once that Mr. CHAPMAN (whom
you may know as the energetic and popular chaplain of the
Savoy; also as already, under a pseudonym, an author) has
deliberately essayed the impossible. Self-revelation, especi-
ally in letters, can hardly ever be made convincing. But
putting this on one side, and accepting these, not as the
letters that would be written from one man to another, but
rather (to speak without irreverence) such as the human
heart might address to its Creator, you will find them full
of interest and encouragement. All sorts and conditions of
men and women are here shown, in their varied reaction to
the great acid that for these three years past has been
biting into the life of the world. The priest, the actor, the
profiteer, the society-woman, even the conscientious objec-
tor, are all touched lightly, tactfully, and with a kindly
humour that saves the book from its very obvious danger
of becoming pedantic. In his brief preface Mr. CHAPMAN
has crystallised very happily into a couple of words his
ideal for the British attitude towards the War—buoyant
sternness. It is the reflection of that quality in its pages
that gives this little book its tonic value.
Mr. ARNOLD WRIGHT's main work in Early English
- - ... Adventurers in the East (MEL-
º Rose) has been that of making
good. Most of us know some-
& ſº thing, at any rate, of the men
lº who brought our Eastern Em-
N. | pºre into actual existence, but
- Iº | I tell myself hopefully that
| my ignorance of those daring
pioneers, whom Mr. WRIGHT
; describes as humble adven-
'turers of the seventeenth
century, is not exceptional.
It has now been satisfactorily
removed, and, after reading
this excellently written history
of stirring deeds, I must
ºf believe that even men of learn-
º º: ing will thank him for rescu-
ing many good names from
the oblivion which threatened
them. And Mr. WRIGHT is
not only to be congratulated
on this act of salvage, but also
on the admirable way in which
he has performed it. A re-
strained style and a temperate
judgment are equally at his command. I cannot better
commend his book to Imperialists than by saying that all
induced by an advertisement to
AssuraH. YoU I AM.”
Little Englanders will detest it.
On internal evidence I had set down Root and Branch
(ALLEN AND UNw1N), by R. ALLATINI, as the very clever
first book of a very clever and observant writer of the
(alleged) weaker sex. But I find the title-page gives two
previous novels to her pen—I still guess a woman's hand.
And I by no means withdraw the “clever.” The characteri-
sation of the various members of the Arenski family—the
branches are better done than the root, old Paul Arenski,
K.C., idealist and orator—is uncannily good. There's wit
and humour and diversity of gifts. What suggested the
“first book” idea was an uncertainty of method, a hesi-
tation between the new realism and the older romanticism.
In both moods the author is successful, but the joints show
something clumsily. This, however, is technical merely.
I commend the book to all who are interested, approvingly
or critically, in the Jew. A dramatic theme runs through
the book, the ethical question as to whether a man may be
justified in killing, at her passionate request, a woman
early loved who is slowly dying of a terrible disease.

TINO IN EXILE.
[As indicated on another page, TINo's actual opinion of his Imperial
brother-in-law is probably not too amiable; but it has to be disguised
in his letters, which are liable to be censored by his wife.]
THANK you, dear WILLIAM, I am fairly well.
The climate suits me and the simple life—
No diplomats to spoil the scenery's spell,
And only faintest echoes of the strife;
The Alps are mirrored in a lake of blue;
Over my straw-crowned poll the blue skies laugh;
A waterfall (no charge) completes a view r
Equal to any German oleograph. -
There are no bugle blares to make me jump,
But just the jodler calling to his kine;
A few good Teuton toadies, loud and plump,
More than suffice me in the levée line;
And, when poor ALEXANDER, there in Greece,
Writes of your “agents” rounded up and sacked,
I am content with privacy and peace,
Having, at worst, retained my head intact.
SoPHIE and I have thought of you a lot
(We have so very few distractions here;
We chat about the weather, which is hot,
And then we turn to talk of your career);
For rumour says this bloody war will last
Until the Hohenzollerns get the boot;
And through my brain the bright idea has passed
That you had better do an early scoot.
Were it not wise, dear WILLIAM, ere the day
When Revolution goes for crowns and things,
To cut your loss betimes and come this way
And start a coterie of Exiled Kings?
You might (the choice of safe retreats is poor)
Do worse than join me in this happy land,
And spend your last phase, careless, if obscure,
With your devoted TINo hand-in-hand. O. S.
MONSI EUR JOSEPH.
ON the day that I left hospital, with a month's sick leave
in hand, I went to dine at my favourite Soho restaurant,
the Mazarin, which I always liked because it provided an
excellent meal for an extremely modest sum. But this
evening my steps turned towards the old place because
I wanted a word with Monsieur Joseph, the head-waiter.
I found him the same genial soul as ever, though a
shade stouter perhaps and greyer at the temples, and I
flatter myself that it was with a smile of genuine pleasure
that he led me to my old table in a corner of the room.
When the crowd of diners had thinned he came to me for
a chat.
“It is indeed a pleasure to see M'sieur after so long a
time,” said he, “for, alas, there are so many others of our
old clients who will not ever return.”
I told him that I too was glad to be sitting in the com-
parative quiet of the Mazarin, and asked him how he
fared. *
Joseph smiled. “I 'ave a surprise for M'sieur,” he said
– “yes, a great surprise. There are ten, fifteen years
that I work in thees place, and in four more weeks le
patron will retire and I become the proprietor. Oh, it is
bee-utiful,” he continued, clasping his hands rapturously,
“to think that in so leetle time I, who came to London a
poor waiter, shall be patron of one of its finest restaurants.”
I offered him my warmest congratulations. If ever a
man deserved success it was he, and it was good to see the
look of pleasure on his face as I told him so.
“And now,” said I presently, “I also have a surprise for
you, Joseph.”
He laughed. “Ph bien, M'sieur, it is your turn to take
my breath away.” r
“My last billet in France, before being wounded,” I told
him, “was in a Picardy village called Fléchinelle.”
He raised his hands. “Mon Dieu,” he cried, “it is my
own village ' "
“More than that,” I continued, “for nearly six weeks I
lodged just behind the church, in a whitewashed cottage
with a stock of oranges, pipes and boot-laces for sale in the
window.”
, “It is my mother's shop ' " he exclaimed breathlessly.
I nodded my head, and then proceeded to give him
the hundred-and-one messages that I had received from the
little old lady as soon as she discovered that I knew her son.
“It is so long since I 'ave seen 'er,” said Monsieur
Joseph, blowing his nose violently. “So 'ard I work in
London these ten, fifteen years that only once have I gone
'ome since my father died.” -
Then I told him how bent and old his mother was, an
how lonesome she had seemed all by herself in the cottage,
and as I spoke of the shop which she still kept going in
her front-room the tears fairly rained down his face.
“But, M'sieur,” said he, “that which you tell me is
indeed strange; for those letters which she writes to me
week by week are always gay, and it 'as seemed to me
that my mother was well content.”
Then he struck his fist on the table. “I 'ave it,” he said.
“She shall come to live 'ere with me in Londres. All that
she desires shall be 'ers, for am I not a rich man 2"
I shook my head. “She would never leave her village
now,” I told him. “And I know well that she desires
nothing in the world except to see you again.”
Then as I rose to go, “Good night, M'sieur,” said Joseph
a little sadly. “Be very sure that there is always a wel-
come for you 'ere.”
The next time that I dined at the Mazarin was some
four weeks later, on the eve of my return to the Front. A
strange waiter showed me to my place, and Joseph was
nowhere to be seen. Indeed a wholly different air seemed
to pervade the place since my last visit. Presently I
beckoned to a waiter whom I recognised as having served
under the old régime. “Where is Monsieur Joseph "I
asked him. -
“Where indeed, Sir " the man replied. “It is all so
strange. One day it is arranged that he shall take over
the restaurant and its staff, and on the next he come to say
Good-bye' to us all, and then leave for France. Oh, it
is dróle. So good a business man to lose the chance that
comes once only in a life He is too old to fight. Yet
who knows? Maybe he heard of something better out
there . . .” - -
As the man spoke the gold-and-white walls of the
restaurant faded, the clatter of plates and dishes died
away, and I was back again in a tiny village shop in
Picardy. Across the counter, packed with its curious
stock, I saw Monsieur Joseph, with shirt-sleeves rolled up,
gravely handing a stick of chocolate to a child, and taking
its sou in return. In the diminutive kitchen behind sat a
little white-haired old lady with such a look of content on
her face as I have rarely seen.
Then suddenly I found myself back again in the London
restaurant.
“Yes,” I said to the waiter, “it is possible, as you say:
that Monsieur Joseph heard of something better in France."
And raising my glass I drank a silent toast.

YoU have all seen it in the latest
V.C. list—“The Reverend Paul Grayne,
Chaplain to the Forces, for conspicuous
bravery and gallant example in the face
of desperate circumstances.’.
You have all pictured him, the beau-
ideal of muscular. Christian, the Fight-
ing Parson, eighteen hands high, ter-
rific in wind and limb, with a golden
mane and a Greek profile; a Pekinese
in the drawing-room, a bull-dog in the
arena; a soupçon of Saint FRANC1s
with a dash of John L. SULLIVAN–and
all that.
But we who have met heroes know
that they are very seldom of the type
which achieves the immortality of the
picture post-card.
The stalwart with pearly teeth, lilac
eyes and curly lashes is C3 at Lloyd's
(Sir FRANCIs), and may be heard twice
daily at the Frivolity singing, “My
Goo-goo Girl from Honolulu" to en-
tranced flappers; while the lad who
has Fritzie D. Hun backed on the
ropes, clinching for time, is usually
gifted with bow legs, freckles, a dented
proboscis and a coiffure after the man-
ner of a wire-haired terrier.
The Reverend Paul Grayne, V.C.,
sometime curate of Thorpington Parva,
in the county of Hampshire, was no
exception to this rule. AEsthetically
he was a blot on the landscape; among
all the heroes I have met I never saw
anything less heroically moulded.
He stood about five feet nought and
tipped the beam at seven stone nothing.
He had a mild chinless face and his
long beaky nose, round large spectacles,
and trick of cocking his head sideways
when conversing, gave him the appear-
ance of an intelligent little dicky-bird.
I remember very well the occasion of
our first meeting. I was in my troop
lines one afternoon, blackguarding a
farrier, when a loud nicker sounded on
the road and a black cob, bearing a
feebly protesting padre upon his fat
|back, trotted through the gate, up to
the lines and began to swop How d'y'
do's with my hairies. The little Padre
cocked his head on one side and oozed
apologies from every pore.
He hadn't meant to intrude, he
twittered; Peter had brought him; it
was Peter's fault; Peter was very ec-
centric. -
Peter, I gathered, was the fat cob,
who by this time had butted into the
lines and was tearing at a hay net as if
he hadn't had a meal for years.
His alleged master looked at me
hopeless, helpless. What was he to do?
“Well, since Peter is evidently stopping
to tea with my horses,” said I, “the
only thing you can do is to come to tea
with us.” So I lifted him down and
bore him off to the cow-shed inhabited
by our mess at the time and regaled
him on chlorinated Mazawattee, mar-
malade and dog biscuit. An hour later,
Peter willing, he left us.
We saw a lot of the Padre after that.
Peter, it appeared, had taken quite a
fancy to us and frequently brought
him round to meals. The Padre had no
word of say in the matter. He con-
fessed that, when he embarked upon
Peter in the morning, he had not the
vaguest idea where mid-day would find
him. Nothing but the black cob's for-
tunate rule of going home to supper
saved the Padre from being posted as
a deserter.
He had an uneasy feeling that Peter
would one day suddenly sicken of the
war and that he would find himself in
Paris or on the Riviera. We had an un-
easy feeling that Peter would one dayde-
velop a curiosity as to the Bosch horse
rations, and stroll across the line, and
we should lose the Padre, a thing we
could ill afford to do, for by this time

he had taken us under his wing spiritu-
ally and bodily. On Sundays he would
appear in our midst dragging a folding
harmonium and hold Church Parade,
leading the hymns in his twittering
bird-like voice.
Then the spinster ladies of his old
parish of Thorpington Parva gave him
a Ford car, and with this he scoured
back areas for provisions and threaded
his tin buggy in and out of columns of
dusty infantry and clattering ammuni-
tion limbers, spectacles gleaming, cap
slightly awry, while his batman (a
wag) perched precariously a-top of a
rocking pile of biscuit tins, cigarette
cases and boxes of tinned fruit, and
shouted after the fashion of railway
porters, “By your leave Fags for
the firin' line. Way for the Woodbine
Express.”
But if we saw a lot of the Padre it
was the Antrims who looked upon him
as their special property. They were
line infantry, of the type which gets
most of the work and none of the Press
notices, a hard - bitten, unregenerate
crowd, who cared not a whit whether
Belgium bled or not, but loved fighting
for its own sake and put their faith in
bayonet and butt. And wherever these
Antrims went thither went the Padre
also, his harmonium and his Wood-
bines. I have a story that, when they
were in a certain part of the line where
the trenches were only thirty yards
apart (so close indeed that the oppos-
ing forces greeted each other by their
first names and borrowed one another's
wiring tools), the Padre dragged the
harmonium into the front line and held
service there, and the Germans over the
way joined lustily in the hymns. He
kept the men of the Antrims going on
canteen delicacies and their officers in
a constant bubble of joy. He swallowed
their tall stories without a gulp; they
pulled one leg and he offered the other;
he fell headlong into every silly trap
they set for him. Also they achieved
merit in other messes by peddling yarns
of his wonderful innocence and his
incredible absent-mindedness.
“Came to me yesterday, the Dicky

The Padre was up at midnight to see
them go, his spectacles misty. They
went over the bags at dawn, reached
their objective in twenty minutes and
scratched themselves in. The Padre
rejoined them ten minutes later, very
badly winded, but bringing a case of
Woodbines along with him.
My friend Patrick grabbed him by
the leg and dragged him into a shell-
hole. Nothing but an inherent respect
for his cloth restrained Patrick from
giving the Dicky Bird the spanking of
his life. At 8 A.M. the Hun countered
heavily and hove the Antrims out.
Patrick retreated in good order, leading
the Padre by an ear. The Antrims sat
down, licked their cuts, puffed some of
the Woodbines, then went back and
pitchforked the Bosch in his tender
spots. The Bosch collected fresh help
and bobbed up again. Business con-
tinued brisk all day, and when night
fell the Antrims were left masters of
the position.
At 1 A.M. they were relieved by the
Rutland Rifles, and a dog weary bat-
tered remnant of the battalion crawled
back to camp in a sunken road a mile
in the rear. One or two found bivouacs
left by the Rutlands, but the majority
dropped where they halted. My friend
Patrick found a bivouac, wormed into

-
it and went to sleep. The next thing
he remembers, was the roof of his
abode caving in with the weight of
two men struggling violently. Patrick
extricated himself somehow and rolled
out into the grey dawn to find the
sunken road filled with grey figures, in
among the bivouacs and shell holes,
stabbing at the sleeping Antrims. Here
and there men were locked together,
struggling tooth and claw; the air was
vibrant with a ghastly pandemonium
of grunts and shrieks; the sunken
road ran like a slaughter-house gutter.
There was only one thing to do, and
that was to get out, so Patrick did so,
driving before him what men he could
collect. - - . .
A man staggered past him, blowing
like a walrus. It was the Padre's bat-
man, and he had his master tucked
under one arm, in his underclothes,
kicking feebly. -. -
Patrick halted his men beyond the
hill crest, and there the Colonel joined
him, trotting on his stockinged feet.
Other officers arrived, herding men.
“They must have rushed the Ruts.,
Sir,” Patrick panted; “must be after
those guns just behind us.” “They'll
get 'em too,” said the Colonel grimly.
“We can't stop 'em,” said the Senior
Captain. “If we counter at once we
might give the Loamshires time to
come up—they're in support, Sir–but
—but, if they attack us, they'll get
those grins—run right over us.”
The Colonel nodded. “Man, I know,
I know ; but look at 'em"—he pointed
to the pathetic remnant of his battalion
lying out behind the crest—“they're
dropping asleep where they lie—they're
beat to a finish—not another kick left
in 'em." -
He sat down and buried his face in
his hands. The redoubtable Antrims
had come to the end. -
Suddenly came a shout from the
Senior Captain, “Good Lord, what's
that fellow after? Who the devil is
it?”
They all turned and saw a tiny figure,
clad only in underclothes, marching
deliberately over the ridge towards the
Germans.
“Who is it?” the Colonel repeated.
“Beggin' your pardon, the Reverend,
Sir,” said the Padre's batman as he
strode past the group of officers. “’E
give me the slip, Sir. Gawd knows wot
'e's up to now.” He lifted up his voice
and wailed after his master, “’Ere, you
come back this minute, Sir. You'll get
yourself in trouble again. Do you 'ear
me, Sir?” But the Padre apparently
did not hear him, for he plodded steadily
on his way. The batman gave a sob of
despair and broke into a double.
The Colonel sprang to his feet, “Hey,
stop him, somebody! Those swine 'll
shoot him in a second—child murder!"
Two subalterns ran forward, followed
by a trio of N.C.O.'s. All along the
line men lifted their weary heads from
the ground and saw the tiny figure on
the ridge silhouetted against the red
east.
“Oo's that blinkin’ fool 2"
“The Padre.”
“Wot, 's 'o doin' of 2"
“Gawd knows.”
A man rose to his knees, from his
knees to his feet, and stumbled for-
ward, mumbling, “’E give me a packet
of fags when I was broke.” “Me
too,” growled another, and followed
his chum. “They'll shoot 'im in a
minute,” a voice shouted, suddenly
frightened. “’Ere, this ain't war, this
is blasted baby-killin'.”
• In another five seconds the whole line
was up and jogging forward at a lurch-
ing double. “And a little child shall
lead them,” murmured the Colonel
happily, as he put his best foot for-
wards; a miracle had happened, and
his dear ruſſians would go down in
lory.
But as they topped the hill crest
came the shrill of a whistle from the
opposite ridge, and there was half a
battalion of the Rutlands back casting
for the enemy that had broken through
their posts. With wild yells both
parties charged downwards into the
sunken road.
When the tumult and shouting had
died Patrick went in quest of the little
Padre.
He discovered, him sitting on the
wreck of his bivouac of the night; he
was clasping some small article to his
bosom, and the look in his face was
that of a man who had found his
heart's desire.
Patrick sat himself down on a box
of bombs, and looked humbly at the
Reverend Paul. It is an awful thing
for a man suddenly to find he has
been entertaining a hero unawares.
“Oh, Dicky Bird, Dicky Bird, why
did you do it?” he inquired softly.
The Padre cocked his head on one
side and commenced to ooze apologies
from every pore.
“Oh dear—you know how absurdly
absent-minded I am ; well, I suddenly
remembered I had left my teeth
behind.” PATLANDER.
“At Nottingham on Saturday the damages
ranging from £710s. to £3 were ordered to be
paid by a number of miners for absenteeism.
It was stated that, although absolved from
military obligations by reason of their occupa-
tion, there had been glaring neglect of respon-
sibility, some men having lost three ships a
week.”—Western Morning News.
These mines are very tricky things.
THE AS.
THE French, always so quick to give
things names—and so liberal about it
that, to the embarrassment and un-
doing of the unhappy foreigner, they
sometimes invent fifty names for one
thing—have added so many words to
the vocabulary since August, 1914, that
a glossary, and perhaps more than one,
has been published to enshrine them.
Without the assistance of this glossary
it is almost impossible to read some of
the numerous novels of poilu life.
So far as I am aware the latest crea-
tion is the infinitesimal word “as,” or
rather, it is a case of adaptation. Yes-
terday “as des carreaux" (to give the
full form) stood simply for ace of dia-
monds. To-day all France, with that
swiſt assimilation which has ever been
one of its many mysteries, knows its
new meaning and applies it.
And what is this new “as " ? I
gather, without having had the advan-
tage of cross-examining a French sol-
dier, that an “as " is an obscure hero,
one of the men, and they are by no
means rare, who do wonderful things
but do not get into the papers or
receive medals or any mention in des-
patches. We all know that many of
the finest deeds performed in war
escape recognition. One does not
want to suggest that W.C.'s and
D.S.O.'s and Military Crosses and all
the other desirable tokens of valour
are conferred wrongly. Nothing of
the kind. They are nobly deserved.
But probably there never was a re-
cipient of the V.C. or the D.S.O. or the
Military Cross who could not—and did
not wish to-tell his Sovereign, when
the coveted honour was being pinned
to his breast, of some other soldier
not less worthy than himself of being
decorated, whose deed of gallantry was
performed under less noticeable con-
ditions. The performer of such a deed
is an “as '', and it is his luck to be a
not public hero. But why ace of dia-
monds? That I cannot explain.
The “as " can be found in every
branch of the Army, and he is recog-
nised as one by his comrades, even
although the world at large is ignorant.
Perhaps we shall find a word for his
British correlative, who must be nu-
merically very strong too. The letter A
alone might do it, signifying anony-
mous. “Voilà, un as ' " says the French
soldier, indicating one of these brave
modest fellows who chances to be pass-
ing. “You see that chap," one of our
soldiers would say; “he's an A.”
All that I know of the “as " I have
gathered from the French satirical
paper, a child of the War, La Baiomette.

incident of the French Army so moving
that I want to tell it here, very freely,
in English. It was, says the writer,
i before the attack at Carency, and he
vouches for the accuracy of his report,
for he was himself present. In the
little village of Camblain-l'Abbé a regi-
ment was assembled, and to them spoke
their Captain. The scene was the yard
I know so well what it was
like. The great manure heap in the
middle; the carts under cover, with per-
haps one or two American reapers and
binders among them; fowls pecking here
and there; a thin predatory dog nosing
about ; a cart-horse peering from his
stable and now and then scraping his
hoofs; a very wide woman at the
dwelling-house door; the old farmer in
blue linen looking on; and there, drawn
up, listening to their Captain, row on
row of blue-coated men, all hard-bitten,
weary, all rather cynical, all weather-
stained and frayed, and all ready to go
on for ever.
This is what the Captain said—a
tall thin man of about thirty, speaking
calmly and naturally as though he was
reading a book. “I have just seen the
Colonel,” he said ; “he has been in
conference with the Commandant, and
this is what has been settled. In a
day or two it is up to us to attack.
You know the place and what it all
means. At such and such an hour
we shall begin. Very well.
is what will happen. I shall be the
first to leave the trench and go over
the top, and I shall be killed at once.
So far so good. I have arranged with
the two lieutenants for the elder of
them to take my place. He also will
almost certainly be killed. Then the
younger will lead, and after him the
sergeants in turn, according to their
age, beginning with the oldest who
was with me at Saïda before the War.
What will be left by the time you have
reached the point I cannot say, but
you must be prepared for trouble, as
there is a lot of ground to cover, under
fire. But you will take the point and
hold it. Fall out.”

I stood against the window
And looked between the bars,
And there were strings of fairies
Hanging from the stars;

In shining swinging chains,

And twisted into skeins.
They kept on swinging, swinging,
They flung themselves so high
They caught upon the pointed moon
And hung across the sky;
And when I woke next morning
There still were crowds and crowds
In beautiful bright bunches
All sleeping on the clouds.

Thursday, July 5th.-It is hardly
surprising that the Government has
decided not to proceed at present with
its great scheme of nationalizing the
liquor-traffic. The announcement that,
in order to meet the requirements of
the harvest-season, the brewers should
be allowed to increase the output of
beer by one-third, brought a swarm of
hornets about the CHANCELLOR's head.
Mr. LEIF-Jones (irreverently known as
“Tea-leaf Jones”) was horrified at the
thought that more grain and sugar
should be diverted to this pernicious
liquid; Mr. DEVLIN and other cham-
pions of the trade were almost equally
annoyed because the harvest-beer was
to be of a lower specific gravity. The
storm of “supplementaries” showed
no sign of abating, until the SPEAKER,
who rarely fails to find the appropriate
phrase, remarked upon “This thirst
for information,” and so dissolved the
House in laughter.

My Mentors in the Press
Have never failed in warning me,
By way of S.O.S.,
To keep my eye on So-and-So
In times of storm and stress.
I think that WINSTON was the first
Commended to my gaze,
But very soon I found my eyes—
Tired by the limelight's blaze—
Incapable of following
His strange and devious ways.
I watched the PRESIDENT and thought
(Unjustly) he was canting;
I watched our late PRIME MINISTER
When furious scribes were ranting,
And vigilantly bent my looks
On HARDEN and on BRANTING.
I watched Jon Escu, also Jones
(Great KENNEDY) and Hughes;
I sought illumination from
BILLING's momentous views;
I watched Freemasons, Socialists,
And Salonica Jews.
And lately with emotions which
Transcend the power of rhymes
I've scanned with reverential eye
Those highly-favoured climes
Ennobled by the presence of
The ruler of the T:::::::s.
I've glued my eye on seer and sage,
On Mecca's brave Sherif ;
I've fastened it on what's-his-name,
The famed Albanian chief,
Till, wearying of the watcher's task,
At length I crave relief.
So when I'm bidden at this stage
To start the game anew
And keep KAROLYI constantly
And carefully in view,
I think I'm wholly justified

too sometimes if they are rather old
and weak and cant be soldiers, but it
is mostly winmen. Some war work
you get paid for but some you dont.
It just depens whether you are rich
and do V A D or poor and do muni-
sions and things. W A D means some-
thing but I forget what. My brother
says it means Very Active Damsles but
you cant beleive him, and anyway
no one talks of damsles nowydays
besept in potry. If you are a VAD
you have to do as your told just like
a soldier but Daddy says they dont do
it always, and Mummy says its because
they all know a better way
than the other persons. But
then they dont cost anything
so the hospitſe people dont
mind much. If you do muni-
sions or are a bus conducter
you do get paid so you maynt
talk so much or you would get
sent away. If I dident have to
go to scool I would love to be
a bus conducter and go rides

MY CUTHBERT.
For months I had been chasing Cuth-
bert. I had a store of withering phrases
burning to be poured over his unmen-
tionable head. Last Tuesday my oppor-
tunity arrived.
A stranger was sitting comfortably
in a deck-chair watching the vacant
courts at the tennis club. His keen
bronzed face and his obviously athletic
body, clothed in white flannel, brought
back to me the far days when the sharp
clean crack in the adjoining field told
of a loose one which had been got
away square.
I looked at him again and thought
how glad he must be to get into mufti
for a few days. I tell you this to show
how unprejudiced I was. The only
other signs of life were the two super-
aborigines who inhabit the croquet
patch and detest all other mankind.
I approached one of them warily and
asked a question. He regarded me with
a bilious and suspicious eye.
“Nothing whatever to do with the
Army,” he snapped, and a Prussian-
blue opponent was smacked off into an
arid and hcopless waste.
“Ah !” I exclaimed,
only a rabbit after all.”
The old thing gave me an unfriendly
glance and then missed his hoop badly.
I strolled across and sat down beside
the newcomer. He smiled at me in
a frank and disarming manner.
“What do you think of our courts?”
I said by way of a start.
“Top-hole,” he replied; “I’m looking
forward to some jolly games on 'em.”
His obvious disregard of perspective
annoyed me. In our village, tennis is
now played for hygienic reasons only.
“I'm afraid we can't offer you much
of a game,” I said. “You see there's
a war on, and—but perhaps I can fix
up a single for you after tea with old
Patterby. I believe he was very hot
stuff in the seventies.”
“That's very good of you. I expect
he'll knock my head off; I'm no use
at the game yet.” -
He spoke as though an endless and
blissful period of practice was in front

with which to slay him.

THE LINKS BEING DEVOTED TO ALLOTMENTS, MR. AND MRS. BUNKER-BROWNE PRACTISE APPROACH SHOTS, WITH THE IDEA OF FILLING
TBIEIIR BASKET WITH POTATOES AT THE SAME TIME.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Marmaduke (HEINEMANN) has this peculiarity, that the
title rôle is by no means its most important or interesting
character. Indeed it might with more propriety have been
called Marrion, since hers is not only the central figure in
the plot, but emphatically the one over which Mrs. F. A.
STEEL has expended most care and affection. Moreover
the untimely death of Marmaduke leaves Marrion to carry
on the story for several chapters practically single-handed.
I am bound to say, however, that at no stage did she get
much help from her colleagues, all of whom—the gouty
old father and his intriguing wife, the faithful servant,
even debonair Marmaduke himself—bear a certain air of
familiarity. But if frequent usage has something lessened
their vitality, Marrion is a living and credible human being,
whether as daughter of a supposed valet, adoring from afar
the gay young ensign, or as the unacknowledged wife of
Marmaduke and mother of his child, or later as an army
nurse amid the horrors of Crimean mismanagement. Later
still, when the long arm of coincidence (making a greater
stretch than I should have expected under Mrs. STEEL's
direction) brought Marrion to the bedside of her parent in
a hospital tent, and, converted her into a Polish princess,
I lost a little of my whole-hearted belief in her actuality.
There are really two parts to the tale—the Scotch court-
ship, with its intrigues, frustrated elopements, et hoc genus
omne; and the scenes, very graphically written, of active
service at Warna and Inkerman. I will not pretend that
-
the two parts are specially coherent; but at least Mrs. STEEL
has given us some exceedingly interesting pictures of a
period that our novelists have, on the whole, unaccountably
neglected. t
The Erperiments of Ganymede Bunn (HUTCHINson) is
like to command a wide audience. Its appeal will equally
be to the lovers of Irish scenes, to those who affect stories
about horses and hunting, and to the countless myriads
who are fond of imagining what they would do with an
unexpected legacy. It was this last that happened to
Ganymede, who was left seventeen thousand pounds by an
aunt called Juno (the names of this family are not the least
demand that Miss DoRo THEA CoNYERs makes upon your
credulity). My mention of horses and Ireland shows you
what he does with his money, and where. It does not,
however, indicate the result, which is a happy variant
upon what is usual in such cases. You know already, I
imagine, the special qualities to be looked for in a tale by
Miss CoNYERs—chief among them a rather baffling inability
to lie a straight course. If I may borrow a metaphor from
her own favourite theme, she is for ever dashing off on
some alluring cross-scent. More important, fortunately,
than this is the enjoyment which she clearly has in
writing her stories and passes briskly on to the reader.
There's a fine tang of the open-air about them, and a
smell of saddle-leather, that many persons will consider
well worth all the intricacies of your problem-novelists. I
had the idea that her honest vulgar little legatee and his
speculations as a horse-breeder might make a good subject

GEORGE SANGER is the only man who could have produced
the right equine cast. -
The component elements of The White Rook (CHAPMAN
AND HALL) may be summarised in the picturesque argot of
Army Ordnance somewhat as follows: Chinamen, inscrut-
able, complete with mysterious drugs, one ; wives, mis-
understood, Mark I, one; husbands, unsympathetic (for
purposes of assassination only), one ; ingénues, Mark II,
one; heroes, one ; squires, brutal, one ; murders of sorts,
three; ditto, attempted, several. The inscrutable one is
responsible for all the murders. Only the merest accident,
it seems, prevents him from disposing of the few fortunate
characters who survive to the concluding chapters of the
story. He narrowly misses the misunderstood wife (now
a widow, thanks to his kind offices), and his failure to bag
the hero and ingénue (together with a handful of sub-
sidiary characters) is only a matter of minutes. There is
almost a false note about the last chapter, in which the
Oriental commits suicide
before he has completed
his grisly task; but it was
obviously impossible for
anyone in the book to live ||
happily ever after so long ſº
as he remained alive. Just
how Mr. HARRIs BURLAND
and the villainous fig-
ment of his lively ima-
gination perform these 4
deeds of dastard-do is not
for me to reveal. The
publishers modestly claim
that in the school of
WILKIE Co LLINs this lº
author has few rivals. As
regards complexity of plot à
the claim is scarcely sub-
stantiated by the volume 3
before me; but if blood-
shed be the food of fiction
Mr. BURLAND may slay on,
secure in his pre-eminence.
The Rev. Frank Far- | *** *** **** ** -
mer, hero of Mr. Richard MARSH's The Deacon's
Daughter (LoNG), was the youthful, good-looking and
eloquent Congregationalist minister of the very local
town of Brasted, and the ladies of his flock adored him.
So earnestly indeed did they adore him that, after he
had preached a stirring series of sermons on the evils of
gambling, they decided to subscribe and send him for a
holiday to Monte Carlo. On his return he was to preach
another course of sermons, which “would rouse the national
conscience and, with God's blessing, the conscience of all
Europe.". Possibly you can guess what happened to him;
I did, and I am not a good guesser. The Rev. Frank had
never been out of England, and he found Monte Carlo in-
habited by ladies who made him blush. He could not
understand their bold ways, so different from the manner of
the Brasted maidens. One of them laid especial siege to
him and assured him that he had “la veine.” At first
I am inclined to believe that he thought she was talking
of something varicose, but when he understood what she
meant he was at her mercy. In short he tried his luck,
to the dismay of his conscience but with prodigious benefit
to his pocket. His return to Brasted is described with
excellent irony.

Mr. WILL IRwiN's war-book naturally divides itself into
two parts, since he was lucky enough to get near the
Front both about Verdun during the great attack, and with
the Alpini fighting on “the roof of Armageddon.” To these
brave and picturesque friends of ours he dedicates his study,
The Latin at War (CoNSTABLE). You must not expect much
of that inside information which the author, as an American
journalist, must have been sorely tempted to produce.
Indeed he has little to offer us that has not been common
property of the Correspondents for long enough, and several
of his descriptions (his picture of a glacier, for one), given
with a rather irritatingly childlike air of new discovery, can-
not escape the charge of commonplace. But his reflections,
for once in a way the better half of experience, more than
make good this defect. His essay on Paris, for instance—
“the city of unshed tears”—is something more than inter-
esting, and his analysis of the cause of the successes of the
French army, in the face of initial defects of material, even
better. The author of Westward Ho!, considering the
Spanish and English navies of ELIZABETH's time, found pre-
|cisely the same contrasted
elements of autocracy and
brotherliness producing
just those results that we
find respectively in the
German and French forces
of to-day — on the one
! hand a mechanical per-
|fection of command, on
the other an informed
equality which, somehow,
does not make against
efficiency whilst fostering
individuality. Mr. IRWIN
hardly refers to our own
// Army; but one is thank-
y// ful to remember that dis-
|cipline by consent, one of
the virtues of true demo-
cracy, is not the exclusive
tradition of our French
allies.
A London Posy (MILLS
AND Boon) is a story with
at least an original setting.
So far as I know, Miss SoPHIE Cole is the first novelist
to group her characters about an actual London house
preserved as a memorial to former inhabitants. The
house in question is that in Gough Square, where Dr.
Johnson lived, and two of the chief characters are George
Constant, the curator, and his sister, to whom the shrine
is the most precious object in life (“housemaid to a
ghost,” one of the other personages rather prettily calls
her). It therefore may well be that to ardent devotees of
the great lexicographer this story of what might have
happened in his house to-day will make a stronger appeal
than was the case with me, who (to speak frankly) found
it a trifle dull. It might be said, though perhaps unkindly,
that Miss Cole looks at life through such feminine eyes |
that all her characters, male and female, are types of perfect
womanhood.
recluse, one might expect to find some feminine attributes :
but even the bolder and badder lots, whose task it is to
supply the melodramatic relief, struck me as oddly unvirile.
But this is only a personal view. Others, as I say, may
find this very gentle story of mild loves and two deserted
wives a refreshing contrast to the truths, so much stranger
and more lurid than any fiction, by which we are surrounded.

Proud Producer. “WHAT Do You THINK of THAT For: A NEw rotato”
I'riend. “IT's NOT A NEW PotATO. YoU 'VE SHowN IT. To ME THREE TIMES ALREADY.”
PHILIP.
Philip is the morose but rather dressy
foreigner who resides in a cage on the
verandah. Miss Ropes, who owns him
and ought to know, says he is a Grey
Cardinal, but neither his voracious
appetite for caterpillars nor his grue-
some manner of assimilating them are
in the least dignified or ecclesiastical.
It takes the unremitting efforts of Miss
Ropes and the entire available strength
of convalescent officers (after deducting
the players of bridge, the stalkers of
rabbits and the jig-saw squad) to sup-
ply Philip with a square meal.
Recently a caterpillar famine began
to make itself felt in the parts of the
garden near the house, and the en-
thusiasm of the collectors evaporated
at the prospect of searching farther
afield.
Ansell was the first to cry off.
“I’m sorry, Miss Ropes,” he said
firmly, “but I have an instinctive anti-
pathy to reptiles.” -
“They aren't—they're insects.”
“In that case,” he replied still more
firmly, “the shrieks of the little crea-
tures when Philip gets 'em rend my
heartstrings. I don't think the doctor
would approve.”
Haynes suggested that Philip's be-
haviour savoured of unpatriotism, and
that the one thing needful was the
immediate appointment of a caterpillar
controller. Miss Ropes countered this
by electing herself to the post, and
declaring that the supply was adequate
to meet all demands, as soon as the
regrettable strike of transport-workers
was settled.
“Don’t you think,” I said, “that
it would be very much nicer—for Philip
—if he were allowed to forage for him-
self 2 We had a bullfinch once who
spent his days in the garden and always
came back to the cage at night.”
This apposite though untrue anecdote
obviously impressed the lady, but she
decided that Philip was too precious to
be made the subject of experiment.
The transport-workers then returned
to their labours, under protest.
However, a day or two later Fate
played into our hands. Miss Ropes
herself inadvertently left the cage door
open, and Philip escaped. The entire
establishment devoted the day to his
evening the truant, dissipated and dis-
tended, lurched into his cage of his own
accord and went instantly to sleep.
Encouraged by his return and by the
regular habits of my hypothetical bull-
finch, Miss Ropes let him out again
next day. This time he did not come
back.
“Probably he's sleeping it off some-
where,” said Haynes cheerfully. “He’ll
be back to-morrow.”
However he wasn't. Miss Ropes
had his description posted up in the
village, and next day a telephone mes-
sage informed us that a suspicious
red-headed character answering to the
specification was loitering near the
“Waggon and Horses,” and was being
kept under observation. Miss Ropes
and Haynes went off to arrest him, but
hardly had they disappeared down the
drive when Philip in person appeared
on the lawn.
This gave our handy man, James, his
chance. James simply loves to make
himself useful. If anybody wants any-
thing done he can always rely on James
to do it by a more complicated method
and with more trouble to himself than
pursuit, without success; but in the the ordinary man could conceive. His

education is generally understood to
have consisted of an exhaustive study
of the “How-To-Make" column in the
Boys' Own Paper, completed by a short
course of domestic engineering under
Mr. W. HEATH RoPINsoN.
We first knew that he had under-
taken the case when we heard his voice
excitedly telling us not to move. Natur-
ally we all turned to look at him. He
had got a butterfly net from some-
where and was lying flat on his tummy
and whistling seductively an alleged
imitation of Philip's usual remark.
Philip, about thirty yards away, was
eyeing him with contempt.
Suddenly James gathered his limbs
| beneath him, sprang up, galloped ten
yards and flung himself down again,
panting loudly. Philip, surprised and
alarmed, took refuge in a tree, where-
upon James abandoned the stalk (blam-
ing us for having frightened Philip
away) and retired to think of another
scheme.
Soon he reappeared with some pieces
of bamboo and a square yard of white
calico, sat down solemnly in the veran-
dah and began to sew.
“Is it a white flag 2 Are you going
to parley with him, or what?” asked
Ansell.
“Trap,” replied James shortly.
We watched with silent interest while
he got more and more entangled in his
contrivance. -
“I hope Philip 'll know how to work
the machine,” said I, “because I'm
sure I shouldn't.”
At last it was finished, and James
took it out and set it. He disguised it
(rather thinly) with half-a-dozen oak
leaves and baited it with a lot of cater-
pillars, and retired behind a tree with
the end of a long piece of string in his
hand.
“When Philip walks up to the trap,”
he explained, “he starts eating the
caterpillars. I pull the string, and he
is caught in the calico. It's called a
bow-net.”
He waited patiently for an hour-and-
a-half, except for a short break while he
rounded up the caterpillars, who, not
knowing the rules, had walked away.
Then we took the luncheon interval;
scores, James (in play) 0; Philip 0.
“I don't see,” said Ansell soon after
the resumption, “why poor old James
should do all the work. Let's all help.”
We began by posting an appeal in
prominent spots about the grounds:–
PHILIP–If this should meet the
eye of. Return to your sorrowing
family, when all will be forgotten and
forgiven and no questions asked.
Next we festooned the estate with
helpful notices, such as “This way to

cocks was observed to be reading this
last with great interest, so we added a
few more notices for the special benefit
of unauthorised food-hogs: “Free List
Suspended until Further Notice,” and
“Eat Less Worm.”
At tea-time Philip was still holding
coldly aloof. But while we were in-
doors Bennett, the gardener, caught
him by some simple artifice beneath
James's notice. I found him putting
the truant back in his cage.
“Don’t do that, Bennett,” I said.
“Put him in Mr. James's trap. He's
had a lot of trouble making that trap,
and it's a pity to waste it.”
Bennett grinned a toothless grin at
me and did some dialect, which I under-
stood to mean that I might do as I
liked, but that he (Bennett) was not
going to catch no more birds for us.
Hardly had I put Philip in the trap
when James emerged.
“Good Lord ' " he shouted, “it’s
done it ! He's in l’’
He dashed on to the lawn, wild with
joy. Probably it was the first time
any of his devices had succeeded.
“Aha, my beauty,” he cried, slipping
his hand under the calico. “We’ve
got you safe, have we?” -
We had not. There was a flash of
red and grey, and the outraged Philip,
minus a tail feather, sought the sanc-
tuary of the woods.
He is still absent without leave at
the time of writing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FuRTHER REM.INISCENCES.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. GEORGE
R. SIMs).
WE come now to the beginning of
the sixties. I well remember, early in
the summer of one of them, Gentleman
Dick—we called him this because his
father had been a tramp, and, although
he scarcely justified the maternal strain
(his mother had been a washerwoman),
he was certainly to all appearances
his father's son—rushing in to tell me
that “Blue Satin,” the prize bull bitch
belonging to the proprietor of that well-
known tavern — public - houses were
scarcely known in those days—“The
Seven Sisters,” had given birth to a
SOrn.
This was an opportunity too good to
be missed, and in spite of the bitter
cold I hurried off with Gentleman Dick,
who already had acquired no small
reputation for his dexterity in hanging
on to the backs of cabs, and ultimately
secured “Albert the Good.” If I had
to christen a pup now I should natur-
ally call him “Jellicoe the Brave.”
“Albert the Good" scarcely lived up to
his name and eventually I had to get
rid of him. He bit a piece out of a
constable's leg. Sir J B—, the
presiding magistrate at Bow Street, was
most charming about it however, and
gave me a seat on the bench during the
constable's evidence. -
I remember it especially because it
was the day following this I was in at
the death, when Ebenezer Smith, the
Mayfair murderer, came to his end.
He made an excellent breakfast of ham
and eggs just before his execution, the
Governor was good enough to tell me,
and was collected enough even to
grumble at the age of one of the eggs.
ID L , the famous comedian,
was very funny always about his eggs.
I remember he had an idea that if you
whistled to the hen before the egg was
laid the result tasted better when you
ate it. He wanted me to write a comic
song for him on these lines, but the
idea never came to anything. I was
very busy at the time collecting royal-
ties. The thousandth performance of
The Merry Murderers had just taken
place, and at last I felt free to shake
the dust of the City from my feet and
devote myself to literature.
It was just about this time that Jim
Peters became the idol of England
through knocking out the Black Bully
—a coloured bruiser with an immense
capacity for eating beef-in a couple of
rounds. Peters was one of the best of
fellows when he wasn't drunk, and
could wink one eye in a manner I have
never seen equalled by that later idol
of the British public, MI L
Alas! poor Peters from fat purses
fell to thin times. He petered out, in
fact, as far as the Mile End workhouse,
where I discovered him one sad day,
and was ultimately able to get him
married to the lady who sold winkles
on the pavement just outside. Her
previous pitch had been just outside
the Hoxton Theatre, but she told me
she found Mile End more disposed to
her wares. The marriage turned out a
very happy one, I am glad to say, and
it pleased me to think that Jim, having
had his wink, was at least sure of his
winkle.
I remember another old friend of
mine—John Madden—he made a hit
in that ill-fated play, A Little Bit Off
the Top–who had an extraordinary
passion for shell-fish. I have often seen
him seated on Southend Pier eating
shrimps out of a paper-bag. Iły the
way, I ought to add that he always
purchased the shrimps in town and
travelled down with them.
Poor John, he might still be eating
shrimps to-day if he hadn't caught a
chill throwing off his sable coat during
a rehearsal at the “Lane.”
Talking of fur coats, Florence Mont-
gomery, who flourished in the early
eighties, and took the town by storm
singing, “Let me share your umbrella,"
in tights, had a perſect passion for
them. She had one for every day in
the week, as she laughingly told me
once. She vanished suddenly, and
everybody thought she had eloped with
the Russian Duke B (he had been
paying her marked attention), but it
turned out afterwards that she had
married a dustman.
I met him casually at one of the
yearly dinners given to this hardwork-
ing body of men—a most affable person
he was too and deeply interested in
the chemical properties of manure—
and it came out. Some people might
have thought a marriage like this a bit
of a hygienic risk, but Florence always
had a heart of gold.
I have often thought this posses-
sion to be a particular attribute of the
theatrical profession. Bessie Bean, the
“Cocoa Queen,” possessed it in a marked
degree. I remember we called her the
“Cocoa Queen " because she always
fancied “a drop of something comfort-
ing" just before the curtain went up on
the Third Act. Only, unfortunately, it
wasn't cocoa.
Arthur Batchen, manager of the
Fly-by-Night Theatre and one of
the best fellows that ever breathed,
told me once he thought the soda must
get into Bessie's legs. But her dresser
was positive about her instructions
always to forget the soda. So I don't
think it can have been that.
I remember too

A LOST LEADER.
(Or, Thoughts on Trek.)
THE men are marching like the best;
The waggons wind across the lea;
At ten to two we have a rest,
We have a rest at ten to three;
I ride ahead upon my gee
And try to look serene and gay;
The whole battalion follows me,
And I believe I've lost the way.
Full many a high-class thoroughfare
My erring map does not disclose,
While roads that are not really there
The same elaborately shows;
And whether this is one of those
It needs a clever man to Say;
I am not clever, I suppose,
And I believe I've lost the way.
The soldiers sing about their beer;
The wretched road goes on and on;
There ought to be a turning here,
But if there was the thing has
gone;
Like some depressed automaton
I ask at each estaminet;
They say, “Tout droit,” and I say
“Bon,”
But I believe I've lost the way.
I dare not tell the trustful men;
They think me wonderſul and wise;
But where will be the legend when
They get a shock of such a size 2
And what about our brave Allies 2
They wanted us to fight to-day;
We were to be a big surprise—
And I believe I've lost the way.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 9th.-With the sound
of Saturday's bombs still in their ears
Members came down to the House pre-
pared to make things very uncomfort-
able for Ministers. Woe betide them
if they could not explain satisfactorily,
first, why the raiders had been able to
get to London at all, and, secondly, why
they had been allowed to depart almost
unscathed. In this atmosphere the
usual badinage of Question-time passed
almost unnoticed. Mr. BALFour gave
a neat summary of Germany's pro-
pagandist methods. “In Russia,
where autocracy has been abolished,
it declares that we are secretly
fostering reaction; in Spain, where
there is a constitutional monarchy,
it proclaims that we are aiming
at revolution. Both statements
are untrue; both are absurd.”
Not until Mr. BonAR LAw an-
nounced that the PRIME MINISTER
would move the adjournment of
the House and make in Secret
Session a statement regarding the
air-raid was the House really
roused. At once a storm of “sup-
plementaries” broke forth. Mr.
P. BILLING, baulked of his prey
—for private sittings are no use to
orators of the flatulent variety—
bounced up and down like a Jack-
in-the-Box until the SPEAKER
finally suppressed him with the
words, “There must be a limit to
this.” The Member for East Herts
is presumably “the limit” referred
to.
Fortunately, perhaps, for the
Government the Home Office Vote
was the subject for discussion. This
gave Members an opportunity for
blowing off a lot of preliminary
steam. At one moment an even
more dangerous explosion was
feared. Sir HENRY DALZIEL sud-
denly produced from his capacious coat-
tails a shell which had fallen into his
office during the raid. His neighbours
crowded round to examine it, until his
remark that it was “still unexploded "
caused a slump in their curiosity.
There was once a statesman who, to
emphasize his argument, flung a dag-
ger upon the floor of the House. For
once the House was thankful that Sir
HENRY DALZIEL bears no resemblance
to BURKE.
To warn or not to warn : that was
the question mainly agitating Mem-
bers. The majority appeared to think
that some system of sound-signals was
desirable; others pointed out that many
threatened raids proved abortive, and
that sirens would interfere with busi-
ness, as in the leading case of Ulysses.
Thanks to the Hoxie SECRETARY's
conciliatory methods there was con-
siderably less tension in the atmosphere
when the time came for the PRIME
MINISTER to make his statement.
When air-raids are about there is
nothing he finds handier than a com-
fortable and capacious CAVE.
Tuesday, July 10th.-The echoes of
the air-raid had almost died away by
this afternoon. When Mr. BILLING
again tried to move the adjournment,
the SPEAKER put him back in his box
with so firm a hand that his spring
may have been irretrievably injured.
WORK OF “GREATER NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.”
MR. SPEAKER MISSES A GREAT CHANCE.
It is hoped that the National Service
Department, which recently sent Mr.
LowTHER a notice informing him that
he was about to be transferred to
Wolverhampton as a labourer at 4s. 10d.
a day, “on the ground that such em-
ployment is deemed to be of greater
national importance than that on which
he is at present éngaged,” will now
consent to hold its hand.
When the House was about to go
into Committee on the Corn Production
Bill a strange thing happened. Before
leaving the Chair the SPEAKER was pro-
ceeding to lop off a few excrescences in
the way of Instructions that appeared
on the Order-paper. Meanwhile the
SERGEANT-AT-ARMs had advanced to
the Table to remove the Mace. “Order,
order!” exclaimed the SPEAKER, upon
which Sir Colin KEPPEL, much abashed
to think that he, the guardian of order,
should have been regarded as even
potentially insubordinate, beat, for the
first time in a gallant career, a hasty
retreat.
The Government had to withstand a
massed attack by the Free Traders,
who even in war-time have not entirely
shed their prejudices against subsi-
dizing the farmer at the expense of the
rest of the community, although the
object of the subsidies is to ensure the
rest of the community having enough to
eat. , Mr. RUNCIMAN and his colleagues
had the temerity to take a division
which ran very much upon the
old party-lines; but on this occa-
sion the Nationalists, in the interest
of Irish farmers, were not “agin'
the Government,” but helped it to
secure the comfortable majority
of 84.
Wednesday, July 11th.-In the
matter of the Mesopotamia Report
a large section of the public and
the Press is in the mood of

arraigned, the Government pro-
poses to set up a special tribunal

Act. That measure, passed to deal
with the strange case of the Bash-
ful Lieutenant and the Lively
Lady, and now to be utilized for
this considerably larger issue, ap-
pears to resemble the elephant's
trunk in its singular adaptability.
But there was a tendency in both
Houses to regard the procedure as
more ingenious than statesmanlike.
Thursday, July 12th. — The
HoME SECRETARY announced that
it had been decided to warn the
public in future when an air-raid
was actually imminent, and added
that the exact method would be stated
shortly. I am glad that he did not
accept Sir FRANCIs Lowe's proposal
to set the telephone-bells ringing all
over London. Think of the language
which would proceed from a hundred
thousand agitated subscribers, deceived
into answering supposed “calls,” when
they ought to be making for their dug-
outs.
The gist of a very long speech by
the ATToRNEY - GENERAL was that
the Press had mistaken the Mesopota-
mia Commission for a Hanging Com-
mittee, whereas it much more resembled
a Fishing Expedition. But his new
tribunal found little favour with the
House, especially when it was dis-
covered that it would have no power to
try the civilians affected. One of them,

SIRENS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS.
[A writer in an evening paper has been
discussing the book that might be written on
Sirens' Songs.]
WHAT were the songs the Sirens sang
Three thousand years ago or more,
When their silvery voices rose and rang
Over the ocean's wine-dark floor,
And brought a strange pe: turbing pang
To the heart of the wisest man of
yore ?
Music and words have passed away,
But a modern rhymer is free to guess
What lent such wizardry to their lay,
What gave it glamour and tender-
neSS,
And lured the hardy seaman astray
From the paths of duty and toil and
stress.
They sang of the Zephyr's scented
breeze,
Of amber eve and star-strewn night,
Of the moan of doves, the murmur of
bees,
Of water trickling from the height,
And all that ministers to our ease
And puts dull carking care to flight.
They sang of banquets in gorgeous
halls,
Of raiment tinct with saffron dyes;
Of ivory towers and crystal walls
And beauty in many a wondrous
ulse,
And all that fascinates and enthralls
The saint and the sinner, the fool
and the wise.
Wily Ulysses at heart was sound—
At least he was quite a family
man ;
He faced the fatal music, but found
An antidote to the risks he ran,
For he sealed the ears of his crew, and
bound
Himself to the mast ere the song
began.
But the Siren who sang and slew is now
The fable outworn of an age remote,
And the women to whom to-day we
bow
Have long abjured her sinister note;
She heals, she helps, she follows the
plough,
And her song has fairly earned her
the vote.

WHAT THE KINGFISHER KNEW.
THE wind ruffled the grey water of
the stream under the old stone bridge.
“Ssshhh, ssshhh,” whispered the
young willows, “what will become of
us? what will they make of us 2
Ssshhh, ssshhh.” But no one replied,
chiefly because no one knew, excepting
the kingfisher, and he was away on a
fishing expedition.
Then one day the woodcutters came
and the sound of their axes rang out
over the meadows by the quiet stream.
A great many of the older willows were
laid low that day, and the young trees
bent and whispered among themselves,
“Ssshhh, ssshhh, what will become of
them 2 what will they make of them 2
Ssshhh, ssshhh.” This time the king-
need us for cricket-bats now,” they
sighed sadly. “I wish they were back
and wanting us to play games with.”
And then one day, when the young
willow-trees had grown older and more
wise, the woodmen came again to the
quiet stream.
“What have they come for 2 What
will they do with us?” whispered the
willow-trees as they shivered and trem-
bled on the reedy margin of the stream.
The kingfisher was preening his small
many-hued body in the sun.
“I’ll find out,” he said, and flashed
away like a fragment of rainbow gone
astray. Almost by the time the first
stroke of the axe rang out over the
sleeping meadows he was back again.
“You are going to die for your coun-
try,” he told them. “They are using
THE BOAT.
A STUDY IN INDIFFERENCE.
ONE likes to think of oneself as a
person of some importance, whose vital
spark, even in these days when life is
so cheap, ought to be guarded with
solicitude. Indeed, to adapt CLough's
phrase, one wants other people—and
especially those whose prosperity is
dependent upon us—officiously to keep
us alive.
This being my not unnatural attitude,
you will understand what a shock I had
when the owner of the boat, who would
expire of starvation if his boats were
not hired, treated me as he has done.
The boat in question was needed for
an estuary or bay in which sailing is
permitted. Since we had decided to

he was just back from a
fishing expedition.
“They will make them
into cricket - bats,” he
said; “that is what wil-
low-trees are used for.”
And he sat and preened
his gay little body in the
Sun.
“Sss-shameful Sss-
shamefull " whispered
the young willow-trees.
“To cut and maim and
carve us up just for men
and boys to play with.
Sss-shame! Sss-shame!
If they only used us for
tools to work with or for
swords to fight with, we
shouldn't mind; but just
for sport | Sss - shame !
Sss-shame!” And they
trembled and whispered among them-
selves on the edge of the silver stream.
But although the kingfisher hap-
pened to have a very liº. he had
a very big mind, and he explained to
the young willow - trees that, even if
cricket might be only a game, yet it
trained boys and men for the Battle of
Life. But the willow-trees were young
and of course they thought they knew
best, so they went on whispering among
themselves, “Sss-shame! sss-shame!”
::: :: :: :: :::
After the War began the kingfisher
used to bring back what news he
could gather on his fishing expeditions.
“They are cutting down the oaks in
the lower spinney,” he told them one
day. “I expect they will be used for
building ships.” And he preened his
little dazzling body in the sun.
“I wish they would use us for build-
ing ships,” whispered the willows. “I
wish they would let us die for our
country. All our brave men and boys
have gone to fight; they do not even

soldiers and sailors who have lost their
own; they are using willows to make
new limbs for our brave sailors and
soldiers.” Up and down the stream he
darted, spreading the wonderful news;
and so the willow-trees were comforted.
“Ssshhh, ssshhh,” they whispered.
“Ssshhh! ssshhh! for our brave sol-
ders and sailors, for our dear sailors

was now half-past ten. “I want to
go out this morning;" and he agreed.

asked.

he would, cheerfully.
“Well, I've no man to spare,” he
said at last. “But there's a boy in
the village who could come. He's not
right in his head quite, but he'll be

“Does he know the channels 2 " I
asked.
“No, I wouldn't say he knew the
channels,” he replied, “but he'll be

“Have you any life-belts?” I asked.
“There were some,” he said, “but
they've gone.”
“You're not very encouraging,” I
remarked. “Surely you don't want
people drowned in your boats? It
wouldn't do the village or the hotel
any good.” -
“No, I suppose not," he assented
thoughtfully; “but no one's going to
be drowned. No one ever has been
drowned in that boat since I’ve had

that 's all right,” he added, and was
gone.

The Candid Courtship (LANE) is a story full of good
talk; by which I do not at all mean brilliant epigram and
verbal fireworks, but direct and genuine conversation, just
so far manipulated by the author that it advances the
business in hand without becoming artificial. I must add,
however, that Miss MADGE MEARs occasionally displays
the defects of her qualities, to the extent of sacrificing
syntax to ease, even in passages of pure narrative, with
results that might offend the precisionist. But after all it is
what she has to say that matters most ; and the story of
The Candid Courtship will hold you amused and curious to
the end. I will not spoil it by re-telling, save to indicate
that (as the title implies) it is about a suitor who, in pro-
posing to the girl of his choice, confessed to her that he had
a past. Not a very lurid past, but quite bad enough for the
G.O.H.C., who happened to entertain strong views on sex-
equality. So, as vulgar persons say, the fat was in the fire
—more especially when the lady of the past turned up
again, not past at all, but very pleasantly intriguing with
another, and that other own brother to the girl herself.
A pretty complication, and leading up to an admirable
scene of tragi-comedy over a double elopement and a pur-
suit, which you must certainly read. Do not, however, be
led to think that the story is at all farcically treated;
Miss MEARs is far too serious an artist to neglect the
grayer aspects of her theme. Briefly, an excellently human
and stimulating novel, whose only drawback is that recent
events have caused the suffrage atmosphere in which it is
Set to taste somewhat stale.
Between anarchy and anarchy the history of unhappy
Mexico is spanned for the space of a generation by the
colossal figure of the soldier-president, Diaz (CoNSTABLE).
Mr. DAVID HANNAY, writing with exquisite literary work-
manship in the series of biographies entitled collectively
Makers of the Nineteenth Century, presents this typically
“strong "man as neither hero nor villain, but as a human
being with human limitations, even more as a Mexican
with the characteristics of a Mexican. Amongst a populace
hopelessly divided by race, untrained in self-government
and cursed with a natural twist for lawlessness only
equalled by its hatred of work, Diaz stands for a tyranny
certainly, but for a unified orderly tyranny, preferable, one
might think, to a myriad petty outlawries. If little of the
country's wealth found its way beyond the narrowest of
circles during his long control, and if certain Indian tribes
were shamefully enslaved—a fact which is neither denied
nor condoned—still railways and harbours did get them-
selves built and the dictator himself lived a life of uncor-
rupt simplicity. He has been blamed for failure to establish
enduringly the civilisation that Europe thought had been
attained, but on this the author's verdict is an unhesi-
tating acquittal. Only a god could have done better,
he thinks, and, in a series of illuminating analyses of the
material to be moulded he shows how anything more than
a superficial improvement was humanly impossible. Until
that day of absorption in the United States which Mr.
HANNAY considers fortunately inevitable, Mexico has no
chance, he maintains, of even a moderately good govern-
ment except under a firm dictatorship; and so he renders
no small homage to the man who, all his failures notwith-
standing, did for a time lift his country from the anarchy
to which in his old age it reverted. Sober reading in all
conscience, but for the manner of the writing one can
have nothing but joyous praise.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
His own modesty must preclude Mr. Punch from indi-
cating those chapters in Soldier Men (LANE) that appear
to him the most worthy of praise. But of course, if you
specially want to know, a glance at the preliminary acknow-
ledgments . Anyhow, parental prejudice apart, these
studies of military life, mostly on the Egyptian Front, form
a sufficiently entertaining and interesting volume. In this
war of many fronts and facets, literature seems a little to
have deserted the desert; it is therefore good that a writer
so well equipped as “YEo" should tell us a little of what
our soldiers there are doing for the cause, the special variety
of beastliness that they are enduring (to read the chapter
called “Plagues of Egypt” is enough to make one seek out
an English wasp and embrace it with tears of affection),
and the courage and humour
that support them in their task.
Something more than this, too;
the wholly illogical and baffling
humanity that—one likes to
think—helps to differentiate the
British fighting man, and must
surely cause certain European
people such bewildered qualms, #
if they ever hear of it. Read,
for example, that grim and Nº.
moving story of the Corporal ºf
who thought shooting was tool ºf
good for Bedouin rebels, and
what he actually did to a family 5
of them who interrupted these
reflections. But I forgot; this
is one of the chapters that I
was not going to mention.
Miss MARGARET PETERson's
Fate and the Watcher (HURST
AND BLACKETT) was already re-
minding me strongly of The
Broken Road when I found that
one of her characters had been
struck by this same idea :
“Lady Daring was not easy in
mind, remembering the look in
Prince Channa's eyes the even-
ing of the ball. She had a vague
memory of a novel by Mason
that she had once read which
dealt more or less with the
same situation.” This naïve
admission must be my excuse
Iteturned Soldier. “WELL, John, I Don't see MUCH CHANGE
IN THE old PLACE SINCE I WENT Away.”

believe always the worst of an enemy, the best of a friend
—a credulous loyal fellow. And in Italy at War (DENT)
he sets out to tell us a good deal that is interesting about
the fine feats of our Italian Allies, especially of those
Titanic gymnasts, the heaven-scaling Alpini. It is fair
to warn the reader that it is a rather desultory scrap-book
of the type the War has made common; fair also to add
that some of the chapters least connected with the War
are exceedingly interesting, as that about the elaborate
sport of pigeon-netting at Cava dei Terreni. What I like
least about our ready author is his fatuous little jokes, such
as “Noli remained a sovereign republic for centuries . . .
had her own bishopric (hence the phrase “Noli episcopari')”;
or, “Briand came to Rome the other day with much brio.”
- - -- And inconsequences like this:
“One of Disraeli's heroes dis-
|covered two nations: the rich
and the poor. In a similar
spirit General February may
be said to command two dis-
|tinct armies.” All the same,
an interesting book.
I am no pacificist, but I am
bound to admit that the mo-
ment seems distinctly ripe for
a cessation in one minor War
T product, namely the trench-
|book. Perhaps some form of
armistice might be arranged,
to last, say, six months; at the
end of which time (should the
War last so long) the changed
ºniºns of campaigning on
|German soil might at least give
our impressionists a chance of
originality. I have been inspired
ºf to these comments by a perusal
of Mud and Khaki (SIMPKIN), in
which Mr. VERNON BARTLETT
has reprinted from The Daily
Mail and elsewhere a number of
vigorous and realistic studies
of life on the Western Front.
Perhaps, as a whole, the col-
lection is a little more grim
than most ; but there are not
wanting touches of light comedy,
in, for example, the comments
of an admirable philosopher
for making odious comparisons between the two books
and saying that Mr. MASON's novel, which also treats
of a native prince's love for an English girl, is on
bigger and broader lines. In Fate and the Watcher the
heroine and the cause of all the trouble is a waif taken
literally from the gutter. She develops into a most
unscrupulous minx, and, although we are led to suppose
that her defects of character were largely due to her origin,
I am prepared to allot to Sir Henry and Lady Daring, who
adopted her, their fair share in the blame. A girl of the
sweet type, endowed liberally with virtues, is produced as
an antidote to the minx, but is no match for her. The
present is not perhaps the most happily chosen time for a
novel with such a theme, but I can at least say that Miss
PETERson is an expert in her subject and is never at a loss
for incident. And Ruth (if that will console you) pays full
price for her sins.
Mr. HERBERT WIv1AN is the complete partisan. He will
named “Pongo” Simpson. For the rest the book, is
precisely what you can gather from its title. In his
preface the author tells us that his object in writing it
has partly been to correct a lack of appreciation among
stay-at-homes of the hardships and heroism of their
defenders. But does there really breathe a man with soul
so dead as to belittle these to-day? I should be ashamed
to think so. Still, do not suppose that I regret that Mr.
BARTLETT should have been goaded by whatever motive
into print. Far from it, for he is clearly a writer of gifts.
But I suggest that he should next time exhibit them to
us in some (dare I say?) less trenchant guise.

ON VIMY RIDGE.
To B. S. B., July 11th.
ON Vimy Ridge I sit at rest
With Loos and Lens outspread below;
An A.D.C.—the very best—
Fxpounds the panoramic show;
Lightly I lunch, and never yet
Has quite so strong an orchestration
Supplied the music while I ate
My cold collation.
Past Avion through the red-roofed town
There at our feet our white line runs;
Fresnoy's defences, smoking brown,
Shudder beneath our shattering guns;
Pop-pop!—and Archie's puffs have blurred
Some craft engaged to search the Bosch out—
I hold my breath until the bird w
Signals a wash-out.
Scarce I believe the vision real,
That here for life and death they fight;
A “Theatre of War,” I feel,
Has set its stage for my delight,
Who occupy, exempt from toll,
-This auditorium, green and tufty,
Guest of the Management and sole
Object in mufti.
And now along the fretted ground
Where Canada’s “BYNg Boys” stormed their
Way,
I go §ducted on the round
That GEORGE of WINDsor did to-day;
Immune he trod that zone of lead,
And how should I, who just write verses,
Hope to attract to my poor head
Their “Perishing Percies”?
Bapaume had nearly been my tomb;
And greatly flattered I should be
If I could honestly assume
The beastly shell was meant for me;
But though my modesty would shun
To think this thought (or even say it),
I feel I owe the KAISER one
And hope to pay it. O. S.
HOW TO CURE THE BOSCH.
“Yes, I seen a good bit o' the Bosch, one way and
another, before he got me in the leg,” said Corporal
Digweed. “Eighteen months I had with 'im spiteful, and
ſour months with 'im tame. Meaning by that four months
guarding German prisoners.”
“And what do you think of him at the end of it?” I
asked.
Digweed leant back with a heavily judicial air.
“Some o' these Peace blighters seem to think he's a
little angel, basin' their opinion, I suppose, on something I
must 'a' missed during my time out. On the other hand
there's a tidy few thinks that one German left will spoil
the earth. Now me, I holds they're both wrong. The
second 's nearer than what the first is, I don't deny. But
a incident what occurred in that Prisoners' Camp set me
thinking that you might make something o' Fritz yet, if
yolkonly had the time and the patience.
T- ***
“We had a batch of prisoners come in what I saw at
once was ſº different brand to the usual. There wasn't that
—well, that distressin' lack o' humility that you mostly
finds showin' itself after we've had them a week or two.
There seemed about 'em almost a sort o' willingness to
learn that put 'em in a class by themselves. I sez to the
interpreter, “There's something odd about that lot. You
find out what it is;" which he does. And what do you
think it was 2 .They was convicts. All men in for a long
term, what had served five years and more o' their sentences
and was let out to fight.
“It seemed to me at first the rummiest thing that ever I
see. But I've thought it over and thought it over, and
now it's as clear as day. When the Bosch is kept in a
watertight compartment for a bit, he gets back to being
more or less of a human being. His whole trouble's really
through being surrounded by other Bosches. They get
tellin' each other what a great nation they are, and how
they was born to inherit the earth, and that it's only fore-
stalling nature a bit to go and take it now, and so on—
each going one better than the last. They keep on con-
taminatin' one another till what do you get? Why, me
and you spending our old age a-teaching of 'em humility.
“Now, with these 'ere convicts it was another story.
'Stead o' keep talkin' about German culture and what
rotters all the rest o' the world was, their heads had
plenty o' time to cool while they picked their oakum or
what not—resultin' in quite a fairly decent lot o' men, as
I say, Yes, it's very interesting and instructive. I believe
it's the solution of the question, “How to cure the Bosch,'
I do. If you could keep 'em all apart from each other for
five years you'd find they'd be quite different. I daresay
they wouldn't mind it so much either.”
“If I was a Bosch I should be thankful,” I said. “But
wouldn't there be difficulties about this segregation ?”
Digweed waved them aside.
“There's always difficulties,” he said. “But you mark
my words, that's the thing to do. It would help it along,
too, to give 'em the right sort of books and papers to
read. Why, if you worked the thing properly, they might
mostly be cured in two years or two and a half.”
I I shook my head. “There are some you'll never cure,”
said.
“There'd be stubborn cases, I won't deny. And a few
incurables, as you say. But the first thing to do is to
advertise the idea. You make a speech about it, Sir.
When you're proposing a vote of thanks to a Duchess
for openin' a bazaar, you bring it up. I've heard people
before now take that kind of opportunity to bring some-
thing forward what they'd got on their chest.”
“I’m not likely to get a chance like that,” I said; “but
I'll see if I can write an article about it.”
Whether Digweed will consider the article worthy of
the subject I cannot say. Perhaps the Editor of Punch
is less fastidious.
FOR OUR SAILORS. -
The current week is “ Navy Week,” and Mr. Punc
begs to urge his kind friends to take their part in the great
organised effort to raise a large sum for the benefit of our
sailors and their families—R.N., R.N.R., R.N.V.R., trawlers
and mine-sweepers. The nation owes them all a debt that
can never be paid. The fund is to be administered on the
lines of King Edward's Hospital Fund. An All-American
matinée will be given in this good cause at the Victoria
Palace on Thursday, July 26th, and Trelawny of the Wells
(with Miss IRENE VANBRUGH) at the New Theatre on Friday.
Gifts for the fund may be addressed to Commodore Sir
RICHARD WILLIAMS-BULKELEY, Bt., at the offices of “Navy
Week,” 5, Green Street, Leicester Square, W.C. 2.

Sergeant (to cadet). “SIT BACR, SIR' SIT BACK! THINK wot A BLINKIN' Fool, You'd Look IF 'Is 'EAD was To CoME on Fl"
THE WATCH DOGS.
LXIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, I never meant
to give myself away; I meant to go on
talking about the old War till the end,
just as if I was taking a leading part in
it, so that you should have still believed
I was doing the bull-dog business with
the best of them. But no, let me be
honest and tell you that I have practi-
cally ceased to be a dog. The only
painful connection I can boast of re-
cently with the War is that, having
cause to travel from place to place in
this country, I was unhappy enough to
strike six meatless days in succession,
which gave me to think that even em-
busquing in France has its drawbacks.
On the seventh day I was accused, by
good people who know not Thomas, of
being (1) a Russian, (2) an American,
(3) a Belgian, and (4) an Irishman,
which made me feel that these gaudy
colours I have burst into are not so
famous as I supposed; and on the eighth
day I find myself insulted in twenty-
seven places by an angry mosquito,
whom in the small hours of the morn-
ing I had occasion to rap over the
knuckles and turn out of my billet.
And I've got a nasty cold, and nobody
loves me or cleans my buttons, and if I
want to go anywhere there are no more
motor cars and they make me pay a
penny for the tram, and my wife doesn't
think I'm a hero any longer, and little
James is being taught to blush and look
away and start another subject when
anybody says “Dad-dad,” and (if you
can believe this) I've just been made
to pay a franc-and-a-half for a tin of
bully beef.
But you don't sympathise, not a bit
of it; why should you? I shouldn't
if I were in your place. I should just
cut off the supply of cigarettes and
shaving-soap, stop wishing me good
luck, and, with haughty contempt, say,
“Call yourself a soldier!” Nevertheless,
my friend, whatever I may be, I look
extraordinarily magnificent, so much so
that a short-sighted Major has taken
his pipe out of his mouth as I have
drawn near and has as good as saluted
me. When he saw I was only a Cap-
tain (and a temporary Captain at that)
he tried to eover his mistake; but he
didn't deceive me; he didn't need to
take his pipe out of his mouth in order
to scratch his head, did he 2
There is this to be said about being
at war, you never know what is going
to happen to you next. For the most
part this is just as well. There is, how-
ever, a decent percentage of pleasant
surprises, which is, I suppose, the only
thing that makes the business tolerable.
No orderly ever came up to the trenches,
when I was in them, i. he gave rise
to the hope that he had orders for me
to come out at once and command in
chief. Some such orderly did arrive at
last, but the instructions he gave mesaid
nothing about taking over the B.E.F.
Nevertheless orders were orders and I
obeyed them and came out. Having
a private conversation with Fortune
on the way down the communication
trench, I thanked her very sincerely for
her kindness and said I was so grateful
º: I would never ask her for anything
else. -
But you know human nature as well
as I do ; I soon found myself saying
what a hard life it was in an office, and
how one missed the open-air life one
had with one's regiment and the healthy
appetite it gave one. Besides which,
as I pointed out to Fortune, my solid
worth wasn't being recognised as it
should be. “I don't ask for favours,”
I told her. “All I ask is bare justice.”
Now, if I’d been Fortune, Charles, and
a man had spoken to me like that,
after all I'd done for him, I'd have had
him marching up that communication
trench again, with a full pack, at five
o'clock in the very next forenoon.
But Fortune, ever kind and forgiving,
did no such thing. She did remonstrate
with me gently of nights, when the

noise of the bombardments was par-
ticularly fierce and prolonged. “What
about those poor fellows right up in
front,” she said, “who are sitting out
in the wind and the rain and going
through that 2" “Yes,” said I, “what
about them 2 Can't you do something
for them 2 Do you know that this is
their fourth night of it in succession,
and the only bit of change you've been
able to give them was sleet instead of
rain on the Sunday ?” That used to
put Fortune in the cart, and she'd try
and work the conversation round to
my own case again. But what with
the wind and the noise and the down-
pour and the mud, I was too hot on
the other subject, and I said that For-
tune ought to be ashamed of herself,
carrying on like that; and it was a
disgraceful war and the police ought to
stop it, and I’d a very good mind to
write to the papers about it.
Then the next day would be fine and
dry and warm, and it would be early
closing for the Bosch artillery, and the
infantry would go marching past my
office window, whistling and singing
and behaving as if the whole thing was
a jolly old picnic; and who'd be an
inkslinger in such weather ? And For-
tune, modestly intruding, would say to
me casually, “I think I've arranged
that rather well, don't you?”
“Ah, you've arranged something at
last, have you?” I’d say, assuming
that she must be thinking about me,
and I'd open my official envelopes with || “.
an unusual interest, feeling practically
sure that one of them must contain
immediate orders for me—the one and
only me—to proceed forthwith to Eng-
land and reorganise the War Office,
taking over a couple of six-cylinder
cars and a furnished flat in St. James's
for the purposé.
Poor old Fortune! what could she
say next 2 She'd look at me, more in
sorrow than in anger, and murmur,
“Aren't you forgetting that this is a
war and you are supposed to be fight-
ing it?” Did I blush for shame?
Not I. As bold as brass I'd look old
Fortune straight in the face and, with
righteous indignation, would say, “I
know as well as you do, Ma'am, that it
is a war; but there's no reason why
it shouldn't be a just war.” Thinking
it out I have never been quite able to
see what I meant by that, as applied
to my own case. However, I seem to
have said the right thing, and it appears
to have impressed Fortune very con-
siderably, because—well, Charles, here
I am.

and belief that there is not) I know

one day search me out, however far I
may have wandered from the battle-
field meanwhile, and, saluting ironic-
ally, will hand me an envelope marked
“URGENT, SECRET, conFIDENTIAL, PER-
soNAL, PRIVATE.” The contents will
be a piece of news and some orders,
and all that Fortune will have had to
do with it will be to attach a forward-
ing slip, “Passed to you, please, for
your information and necessary action.”
The news will be that for everyone else
the War is over, and the infantry and
the rest of them will take over forth-
with my present circumstances, being
free to revel in the trams and the mos-
quitoes and the nasty colds to their
hearts' delight. The orders will be
that for me the War is about to begin
again in grim earnest, and that to-
morrow at dawn I take over and de-
fend till further notice, and against all
the most noisy and loathsome inven-
tions that man can devise, that sector
of the trenches which extends from the
Swiss frontier to the sea.

[JULY 25, 1917.
OUR MIGHTY PENMEN.
By A LITERARY ExPERT.
THE House of Boffin announces a
revised edition of Mr. Elbert Pitts's
Final Words on Religion, under the title
of Antepenultimate Words on Religion.
As Mr. Pitts observes in his arresting
Preface, “Finality, in a time of up-
heaval, is a relative term, and I hope,
at intervals of six months or so, to
publish my penultimate, quasi-ultimate
and paulo-post-ultimate views on the
vital beliefs which underlie the fantastic
superstructure of dogmatic theology.”
The new work will be illustrated with
three portraits of the author by Mr.
Marcellus Thom, taken at various
stages of the composition of the work.
Mr. Pitts has also completed a new
novel entitled The Bounder of Genius,
and has kindly furnished us with a
brief outline of its contents. The hero,
who starts life as an artificial raspberry-
pip maker and amasses a colossal for-
tune in the Argentine grain trade,
marries a poor seamstress in his strug-
gling days, but deserts her for a brilliant
variety actress, who is in turn deposed
by (1) the daughter of a dean, (2) the
daughter of an earl, and (3) the daughter
of a duke. Ultimately Jasper Dando,
for that is his name, leads a crusade to
Patagonia, where he establishes a new
republic founded on Eugenics, China
tea, and the Prohibition of the Classics.
Mr. Pitts thinks it the finest thing he
has done, and he is fortified in this
conviction by the opinion of Mr. Stoot,
the principal reader of the House of
Boffin.
We are glad to hear that Mr. Hanley
Potter will shortly issue, through the
firm of Bloomer and Guppy, a selection
from the reviews, notices and essays
contributed by him to The Slagville
Gazette. “They are interesting,” says
the author, “as the expression of a fresh
and unbiassed mind, unfettered by any
respect for established reputations or
orthodox standards.” The titles of
some of the articles—“The Dulness of
Dante,” “The Sloppiness of Scott,”
“George Eliot as Pedant,” “Jane
Austen the Prude"—indicate suffici-
ently the richness of the treat provided
in these stimulating pages.
The Centenary of JANE AUSTEN is to
be celebrated in a thoroughly practical
manner by the House of Hussell. It will
be remembered that, some thirty years
ago, an effort was made to revive the
waning popularity of Sir WALTER Scott
by the issue of a series of condensed ver-
sions of his novels, in which redundant
passages, notes and introductions were
removed and the salient features were
compressed in a compact and animated
narrative. In order to render justice
to JANE AUSTEN the process needed is
diametrically opposite. JANE AUSTEN's
novels are short and singularly lack-
ing in picturesqueness, emotion, colour.
Mr. Hamo Bletherley, who has been
entrusted with the task of infusing
these elements into JANE AUSTEN's
staid and reticent romances, points out
that her vocabulary was extraordinarily
limited. Her abstinence from decora-
tive epithets led to results that are bald
and unconvincing. One may look in
vain in her pages for such words as
“arresting,” “vital,” “momentous" or
“sinister.” She never uses “glimpse,”
“sense" or “voice ’’ as verbs. We
look forward with eager anticipation
to the results of Mr. Bletherley's
courageous experiment.
In this connection we cannot too
heartily congratulate Mr. Jerome Long-
more, the well-known bookman and
literary curio-collector, on his latest
stroke of good luck. It appears that
in a recent pilgrimage to Selborne he
met the only surviving great-grand-
daughter of Sarah Timmins (char-
woman at Chawton in the years 1810
to 1815), and purchased from her a pair
of bedroom slippers, a pink flannel
dressing-gown and a boa which had
belonged to the great novelist. A full
description of these priceless relics will
shortly appear in The Penman, together
with a life and portrait of Sarah Tim-
mins, who married a pork butcher in
Liphook and died in 1848. One of her
letters establishes the interesting fact
that JANE AUSTEN never ate sausages.
We may add that Mr. Longmore is
not one of those miserly collectors who
brood over their treasures and deny
the sight of them to others. On the
contrary he takes the keenest pleasure
in showing them to his friends, and at
the present time is holding a series of
informal receptions at his charming
villa at Potter's Bar, at which, robed in
JANE AUSTEN's dressing-gown, wear-
ing her boa and shod in her slippers,
he presents a truly romantic and dis-
tinguished spectacle. We understand
that the Potter's Bar authorities are
favourably considering the proposal
that warnings of air raids in that local-
ity should be given by the appearance
in public of Mr. Longmore in this strik-
ing dress. -

PETHERTON'S PEDIGREE.
A STROKE of luck enabled me to open
an interesting little correspondence
with my genial neighbour, Petherton,
which resulted in one of those delightful
passages-of-arms in which Petherton,
at least, excels.
DEAR MR. PETHERTON (I began), I
have made a discovery which will, I
am sure, interest you, though I am
uncertain whether it will be as pleasing
to you as to myself.
During certain research work at the
Record Office I came across incontro-
vertible evidence that we are in some
way related through a Petherton in the
early part of the eighteenth century
(tempus GEORGE II) being sufficiently
far-seeing to contract a marriage with
a Fordyce. This Petherton, by name
Edward, lived at Kirkby Lonsdale, and
his wife, Emily Jane Fordyce, at Dent,
in the same district.
I haven't a family tree by me, but
know the late-lamented Emily Jane by
name. She was part of the issue of
one Henry Fordyce, who is in the
direct line, absolutely non-stop, with-
out changing, from the earliest known
Fordyce to myself.
What a field for speculation is here
opened up ! With your scientific bent
you will grasp the possibilities of the
hereditary influence of my family on
yours, supposing Edward Petherton to
be a direct ancestor of your own. To
me the unexpected result of my re-
searches will give an added interest to
our correspondence, and I await with
eagerness your views as to the value
and interest of my discovery.
Your kinsman,
HENRY J. FordycF.
Petherton cried “Touché" at once,
and lunged at me in accordance with
my plan of campaign.
SIR (he spluttered), As a very busy
man I must protest against your at-
tempt to distract my attention by
writing to me on a matter that is of no
importance. That your discovery is of
a somewhat disconcerting nature I will
not deny, but that it is of any particular
value or interest to me is hardly to be
expected, seeing that it relates to a by-
gone century, and any defects acquired
by the Pethertons from such a union
will, I imagine, have been overcome
by now.
The Fordyces were apparently a
more attractive race in the eighteenth
than in the twentieth century. I can
scarcely imagine a present-day Pether-
ton contracting such a mésalliance.
A direct ancestor of mine, Edward
Petherton, as I see by the Family Bible
in my possession, was born in 1699,

married in 1728, and lived at Kirkby
Lonsdale. His wife's name is not
stated, but I can the more readily be-
lieve that he is the misguided individual
to whom you refer, as he died in 1729,
no doubt as the result of his rash act.
His son, Primus Postumus Petherton,
born, as his second name suggests, after
his father's death, carried on the line.
Any possible virtues or talents my
family may possess are not, I am
certain, from the distaff side of this
union.
Yours faithfully,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
I made a thrust in tierce:–
DEAR Cousin FRED,-What a mine
of information you are I touch a
spring and out comes Primus Postumus
Petherton. The name conjures up
visions of grey church towers, monu-
mental urns and the eulogies in verse
beloved of Georgian poets. I wonder
whether Possy was a great letter-writer
and kept poultry. By the way, what a
lot of good things begin with a “P,”
and, talking of poultry, I notice yours
are laying, or should be. They are cer-
tainly in full song these mornings.
I'm so glad that you're so glad
that I'm a relation. When I was at
the Record Office again yesterday I
searched for more information about
my new-found relatives. In fact I dug
up the Petherton allotment thoroughly
and unearthed Priscilla and Anne, both
of CHARLEs I.'s time, and Marmaduke
of the Restoration.
I couldn't exhume a complete family
tree, or no doubt I should have found
all these worthies hanging on their
respective branches, though Marma-
duke might have dropped off, as he
appears to have been a bit over-ripe
from what I could gather from the
records.
How are the Food Regulations suit-
ing you? Judging from your last letter
I'm afraid you are not taking enough
starch. Of course I know it's gone
up fearfully in price lately. Personally
I've taken to wearing soft collars.
Your affectionate Cousin, H. F.
Aren't you pleased that potatoes have
come in again? (Another good thing
beginning with a P.)
Petherton ground his teeth for a last
bout, and bade me come on.
SIR (he wrote), I'm glad you've
taken to soft collars. They will suit
your soft head. As for food, I'm afraid
you're not taking enough arsenic. A
slight touch of relationship to my
family has evidently turned your brain.
I cannot say how sorry I am that you
should have discovered the one flaw
in my pedigree.
Yours faithfully,
FREDERICR PETHERTON.
I gave him one last little tweak
under the ribs:—
DEAR old Boy, Just a hurried line
to say that all is forgiven and forgotten.
The family feud (there must have been
one, I'm certain) which has kept the
Pethertons and the Fordyces apart for
the last couple of centuries is a thing
of the past, now that we two under-
stand each other so thoroughly. I am
only sorry I did not discover the straw-
berry mark on your left arm earlier,
that I might the sooner have sub-
scribed myself
Your long lost HARRY.
This either disarmed him or he
threw away his weapon in disgust.
“Other houses have a good many books
which have come down from posterity, mostly
in odd volumes.”

Some of those that we bequeath to our
ancestors will be quite as odd.

of food - control a well-known Soho
restaurant intends to change its name

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 16th.-In the course
of a discussion on “rope” in War-bread
Mr. THORNE accused the West-End
bakeries of mixing white flour with the
“G.R.” variety, and so supplying their
wealthy customers with better bread
than is procurable by his own constitu-
ents. Although no official confirm-
ation of this charge was forthcoming
Mr. THoRNE appeared to be convinced
of its accuracy. In his opinion the
Government, following the historic ex-
ample of PHARAoH, should give the
bread to the people and the rope to the
bakers. -
It might not be accurate to say that
in the matter of beer the Irishman
wants but little here below, but he cer-
tainly wants that little strong; and
being, in spite of a popular impression

to the contrary, a seriously-minded
person, he resents any reduction of his
Mr. BRIDGEMAN's gentle re-
minder that no Irish brewer need avail
himself of the new regulations unless
he pleases quite failed to satisfy the
Nationalists that a new item had not
been added to Ireland's catalogue of
grievances.
Tuesday, July 17th-For some weeks
Mr. GINNELL has been absent from his
place. No one has gone so far as to
suggest that the Roll of the House
should be called in order to bring back
the hon. Member to his Parliamentary
duties. But considerable curiosity was
aroused by his recent statement that
he proposed to make one more appear-
ance at Westminster before retiring
permanently to Ireland to watch over
the growth of the Sinn Fein Republic.
tion 45, “Mr. Ginnell, to ask
To-day was the day. Ques-
the Prime Minister, &c., &c.,”
was eagerly awaited. There
was no saying that the hon.
Member, if dissatisfied with
the reply, would not hurl the
Mace at the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER, so as to en-
sure a properly dramatic exit.
At last No. 45 was reached;
but Mr. GINNELL was not
there to put it. Once more
the Saxon intellect had been
too slow to keep up with the
swift processes of the Celtic
cerebellum. Mr. GINNELL
has on more than one occa-
sion made what his compa-
triots call a “holy show" of
himself; but he refuses to do
this sort of thing to order.
Mr. HousToN is still harp-
ing upon the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER's recent
confession of his ship-owning
gains, and laboured hard this afternoon
to convince the Committee that ship-
owners in general were in no sense
profiteers. He failed, however, to avert
the wrath of Mr. DENNIss, who declared
that if, after what had been revealed,
any shipowner was made a peer, he
should move to abolish the peerage.

This day the KING in Council decreed
that the Royal House should forthwith
abandon all German titles and be
known henceforth as the House of
Windsor. No one will be better pleased
than Mr. Swift MACNEILL, who for
months past has been unsparing in his
efforts to purge the Upper House of
enemy peers, and to-night had the
satisfaction of seeing a Bill for that
purpose read a second time. His pro-

passed in three minutes was not quite
borne out; but that was chiefly be-
cause the hon. Member himself occupied
a quarter-of-an-hour in complaining of
the Government's delay in introducing
it.
Wednesday, July 18th-Sir HENRY
DALZIEL has been labouring under the
delusion that the R.N.A.S. and the
R.F.C. are so mortally afraid of tres-
passing upon one another's aerial pre-
serves that the former will not attack
an enemy plane travelling over land,
or the latter over sea. Dr. MACNAMARA
for the Navy, and Mr. MACPHERSoN for
the Army, informed him that there was
no truth in the suggestion; but Colonel
CLAUDE LowTHER, remembering that
there were once Two Macs who de-
lighted in spoofing their audiences,
refused to be comforted until categori-
cally assured that between R.N.A.S.
and R.F.C. there is “sufficient cohe-
sion.”
This was BALFour's day. Never since
he gave up the Leadership of the Union-
ist Party six years ago has he more
completely dominated the scene. Mr.
BONAR LAw had announced that the
Government had on third thoughts de-
cided not to set up a new tribunal to
try the persons affected by the Mesopo-
tamia Report. The military officers
would be dealt with by the Army Coun-
cil. As for Lord HARDINGE, the Govern-
ment, “on the representations of the
For EIGN SECRETARY,” had again re-
fused his proffered resignation. If any
Members disapproved, let them pro-
pose a Vote of Censure or move the
adjournment.
It was perhaps fortunate for the
Government that Mr. DILLON accepted
the challenge. During the
War the Member for East
Mayo has lost such authority
in the House as he once pos-
sessed. Criticism on the con-
duct of the campaign from
one who boasts that he has
, never stood upon a recruiting-
platform lacks sincerity. Mr.
BALFour, always at his best
when defending a friend, laid
about him lustily, and con-
vinced the majority of the
House, not very friendly at
the outset, that it would be
an act of gross injustice to
remove a great public servant
because the Commission—on
whose evidence, without fur-
ther inquiry, you could not
o
º? hang a cat—had reported
\ " ..... adversely on his conduct in an
entirely different capacity.
To add to the force of this
appeal came Sir HEDworth
MEUx's striking testimonial

—“I have known Lord HARDINGE
from a boy.” After that, small wonder
that the House rejected Mr. DILLON's
motion by 176 to 81.
Thursday, July 19th-The only thing
that keeps Mr. REDDY at Westminster
is his delight in acting as Chorus to
Major PRETYMAN NEwMAN. Whenever
the hon. and gallant Member asks a
question Mr. REDDY, in a piping voice
of remarkable carrying power, imme-
diately puts another, designed to throw
doubt upon his personal prowess or his
military capacity. Major NEwMAN had
several Questions on the Paper this after-
noon, and, as he had just announced the
withdrawal of his valuable support from
a Government so lost to all sense of pro-
priety as to welcome Messrs. CHURCHILL
and MonTAGU to its fold, Mr. REDDY's
comments were awaited with pleasur-
able anticipation.
Alas! for once he was not in his
place. Even when Major NEWMAN
elicited the damning information that
some members of the Dublin Metro-
politan Police occasionally employ a
German barber there was no penetra-
ting voice from the back benches to
ask, “Why doesn't the honourable
Mimber go and shave them himself?”
Mr. JowetT wants the HoME SECRE-
TARY to withdraw the permission he
gave some time ago “to employ women
on the night-turn in wool-combing.”
Several much-married Members are
afraid that whatever he may decide the
objectionable practice will continue.
SCOTLAND FOR EVER.
THEY came from untamable highlands,
From glens where their fathers were

From misty and mountainous islands
Set fast in the throat of the sea;
They fought for the honour of Britain;
They died in defence of the right;
Their deeds are in history written
In letters of light.
They fell where the Ganges is flowing;
They lie 'neath the Russian Redan;
Their dust o'er the desert is blowing
In the whirlwinds of far Kordofan;
The sons of Glen Orchy and Rannoch
Sleep sound by the slow-moving
Scheldt,
And the bones of the men of Loch
Fannich
Are white on the veldt.
But the Lews and Lochmaben and
Gairloch
Still march to the battle array,
And the fighters from many a fair
loch,
Like their fathers, leap forth to the
fray;

Where the curtain of battle is drawn,
Where the clansmen through death-
cloud and thunder
Go over at dawn.
In the strength of the hills and the
heather,
With the salt of the sea in their blood,
They sweep from the trenches together
With the force of an onrushing flood;

When gales from the Hebrides blow,
Like a storm on the mountains of

They burst on the foe.

THE TAP-ROOM.
OUR Reserve Battalion has a billiard-
room, which is well patronised by all
those cheerful souls who have escaped
from France without permanent injury
and resignedly await the second call.
To-night the “Tap-room" is in top
form. A four-handed game of snooker
is in as rapid progress as is reasonably
possible. Every easy-chair is filled with
a would-be player offering gratuitous
advice in order to speed things up. A
young war-scarred Captain is balanced
on a rickety side-table, offering odds on
the game in a raucous voice. The Mess-
waiter strives to be in three
places at once. Through all,
the players, totally unnerved,
play with a desperate attempt
at concentration. º
Suddenly the door opens, and 4
the Colonel enters, heated and
out of breath. His eye pierces
through the tobacco smoke and
transfixes the unhappy book:
maker. He requests him to
take advantage of his position
to open a window. The players
examine the tips of their dues
in sudden silence. The Colonel
refuses the offer of six vacated
chairs with a slightly impatient
negative and inquires as to the
probable length of the game.
He accepts the obvious untruth
that it has just ended, smiles
with satisfaction, and proposes
to the Adjutant a game of one
hundred up.
The Colonel, after examining
the cues with marked disap-
proval, eventually selects one.

pocket the red from a point of consider-
able vantage, when the Adjutant defer-
entially suggests that he is about to
play with the wrong ball. The Colonel
immediately strides round the table to
where his command is clinging to the
cushion, lifts the ball to convince him-
self that there is a spot on its surface,
plants it back in a slightly more favour-
able position, and with one thrust of
his cue projects it into open country.
He then leaves the table without await-
ing the result and resumes his pipe.
The Adjutant now compiles a fifteen
break, pauses, notices the Colonel's
inattention, and with typical lack of makes a blind despairing dash forashell-

walks round the table to examine the
position from every point of view. His
next move is to mark out elaborate
angles with the assistance of chalk
marks on the cushions. Having finally
formed all his plans, he encourages his
artillery with a few more rounds of
chalk, approaches the field with studied
and dignified calm, delivers his attack,
and retires to watch the effect from his
O. Pip.
His command, flying desperately
across the open, loses direction, blun-
ders hopelessly into an obstruction on
the flank, retires in confusion, and
crater. Missing this by a frac-
|tion it loses all interest in life,
wanders pitifully off at an un-
natural angle, runs into the
|hostile force of the Adjutant,
and comes finally into contact
with the red.
The Colonel hastens to remark
to the enthusiastic audience that
this cannon only proves the
possibilities of the noble game
when accuracy is achieved. It
is calculated to improve their
marksmanship, to teach them
to grasp an opportunity, to
|apply their tactical training,
and to render them cool in the
|hour of crisis.
Inspired by this truth he
attempts to pull off an awk-
ward losing hazard. This effort
is ruined by an appalling mis-
cue which affects the new cloth.
|The Colonel justly blames the
chalk, removes the pet-dog of
the battalion from his path
with his foot, and makes for
the scoring-board. The volun-
teer marker inadvertently puts
the Colonel's modest score on to
the large total of the Adjutant.
At this critical moment an
tion, and endeavours to cast his oppo-
nent's ball into a baulk pocket with
a rapid back-hander. The Adjutant
sprints round the table in pursuit.
The Colonel next addresses his own
ball and propels it violently against the
red, which, taken completely by sur-
prise, bounds with a strong resilience
from the top cushion, courses twice up
and down the table and comes to a
pause in the neighbourhood of the
middle pocket. The Colonel tests the
elasticity of the cushion with his thumb
and gives way a foot to enable his
opponent to icºn a neat break of
twenty-seven.
The Colonel, finding time hanging
heavily on his hands, devotes this period
to filling his pipe from a borrowed
pouch ; he then tramps determinedly
back to the table and is about to
true discipline pots his opponent's ball
and leaves the others in baulk. A
horrified silence ensues. The Colonel,
without noticing the delicacy of the
situation, playfully slopes his “hipe”
and marches back to the table. The
awful truth is instantly laid bare. The
colour of his face becomes of an imperial
shade. He dumbly fumbles for his
ball, which, with a last bid for exemp- |
tion, eludes his fingers and rolls under
the table.
Taking advantage of this the Colonel,
with one glance of concentrated hate
in the direction of his opponent, grap-
ples with his choler, and by the time
that his ball is returned under escort,
has partially recovered himself. He is
determined to show to his subalterns
the value of coolness in an emergency.
He places his ball with infinite care and
orderly fortunately arrives with a note
from the Brigade office. The Colonel
secures the missive, tears the envelope
to shreds, runs his eye over the trivial
contents, and curses the War. He then
assumes an air of enormous import-
ance, excuses himself, and stamps out
into the night.
“It may be the bravery of ignorance that
induces us to take this point of view, but the
locality excuses ignorance to some extent,
and the bravery still exists: Ovid has a line
that might be learnt with advantage by our
readers—

We do not recall this line in OvID; but
the locality is notoriously unfavourable

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH,
DR. SULLIVAN.
IT had been decided that there never
was such a resemblance as is to be
traced between my homely features and
those of a visitor to the same hotel last
year—Dr. Sullivan of Wigley Street.
This had become an established fact,
irrefutable like a proposition of Euclid,
and one of my new friends, who was
also a friend of the Dr. Sullivan of
Wigley Street who had so satisfyingly
and minutely anticipated my counte-
nance, made it the staple of his con-
versation. “Isn't Mr. Blank,”
would say to this and that habitué of
the smoking-room as they dropped in
from the neighbouring farms at night,
“the very image of Dr. Sullivan of
Wigley Street, who was here last year?”
And they would subject my physiog-
nomy to a searching study and agree
that I was. Perhaps the nose—a little
bigger, don't you think? or a shade of
dissimilarity between the chins (he
having, I suppose, only two, confound
him!), but taking it all round the like-
ness was extraordinary.
This had been going on for some
time, until I was accustomed, if not
exactly inured, to it, and was really
rather looking forward to the time
when, on returning to London, I could
trump up a sufficient ailment to call
upon my double in Wigley Street and
scrutinize him with my own eyes. But
last night my friend had something of
a set-back, which may possibly, by
deflecting his conversation to other
topics, give me relief. I hope so.
It happened like this. We were
sitting in the smoking-room as usual,
he and I, when another local acquaint-
ance entered—one who, I gathered.
had been away for a few weeks and
whom I had therefore not yet seen, and
who (for this was the really important
thing to my friend) consequently had
not yet seen me.
In course of time the inevitable oc-
curred. “Don’t you think,” my friend
asked, “that Mr. Blank is the very
image of Dr. Sullivan of Wigley Street,
who was here last summer?”
“What Dr. Sullivan's that 2" the
newcomer inquired.
“Dr. Sullivan of Wigley Street, who
was fishing here last summer. Don't
you remember him 2 The very image
of Mr. Blank.”
“The only Dr. Sullivan I know,” re-
plied the newcomer, “is Dr. Sullivan of
Newcastle. He's a very old man by
now. A very learned man too. He has
a wonderful private museum. He—”

“But that's not the Dr. Sullivan I
mean. You must remember him,” said
my impresario; “we all used to meet
evening after evening, just as we're
doing now — Dr. Sullivan of Wigley

big man, exactly like Mr. Blank here.
Everyone has noticed the likeness.”
“Dr. Sullivan of Newcastle has a
beard,” said the newcomer. “And he's
a very old man by now. A great re-
ceptacle of miscellaneous learning. He
showed me once his collection of coins
and medals. He's got coins back to

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(Dr. von BETHMANN-Hol.1, WEG and Herr MICHAELIS.)
MICHAELIS. I have called partly because I desired to
offer my most tactful condolences to my distinguished
predecessor in the high office which I hold, and partly
because I thought you might be willing to give me some
hints as to my conduct, for I should like to leave nothing
undone that might make me a successful Chancellor.
Von BETHMANN-Hol.1, WEgg. Upon my word you are
even more kind and considerate than I had expected.
Lven to exchange a word with a fallen Chancellor is a
sign both of kindness and courage. I wonder how you
could screw yourself up to the pitch of being so daring.
M. I am glad you think so, for that is how I myself
felt it.
Von B.-H. Well, we will leave your courage out of the
question. It is sufficiently proved by your acceptance of
the Chancellorship. As to such advice as I am able to
give, I must ask you first whether you are ready to have
the boots of the ALL-HIGHEST constantly wiped upon
various parts of your person 2
M. A true Prussian endures that with difficulty.
Von B.-H. But a true Prussian, it seems, can accustom
himself to this form of friendship and confidence as to
many others. -
M. What others do you speak of ?
Von B.-H. My worthy MICHAELIS, you really must have
covered your eyes and stopped your ears ever since you
were born, otherwise you could not possibly be so ignor-
ant. Do you not know that if your great and beloved says
a foolish thing or does an indiscreet one it will be your
duty to shoulder the responsibility for it? And you can
easily calculate yourself during how many hours of the day
your back is likely to be without a burden of some sort.
And mind you, you are not to expect to receive any grati-
tude for your toil. r - -
M. But he speaks a kind word now and then, doesn't
he 2 - -
Von B.-H. A kind word 2 Ha-ha. When I think of all
that I have done for that man, the acts I have defended,
the stupidities I have tried to convert into statesmanship,
the tempers I have been the butt of, the childish insults I
have had to tolerate, the theatricalities I have been com-
pelled to treat as if they were the most glorious manifesta-
tions of Imperial splendour—when I think of all this and
realise that he and I are both still alive, I marvel at such a
spectacle of human endurance.
M. I must confess you are not very cheerful or very
encouraging. . - -
Von B.-H. I did not set out to cheer you up or to en-
courage you, but I thought it just as well that someone
should tell you the truth.
M. Why aren't you glad then at having dropped your
burden 2 -
Von B.-H. I own I ought to be, but, as you hint, I am
not. There are ways of doing things, and there is a real
difference in walking quietly through a door and being
kicked out through it with all possible violence.
M. But you have had the Hohenzollern Order pre-
sented to you and the ALL-HIGHEST has written you with
his own gracious hand a letter.
Von B.-H. Verbosa et grandis epistola venit a Capreis.
As for the Hohenzollern Order I don't care a snap of the
fingers for it. Nor will you when your time comes.
M. I hope that will not be for many years.
Von B.-H. For your sake I hope your time may be short.
In any case I must thank you most warmly for your tact-
ful condolences.
THE REST-RUMOUR.
I KNow not in what rodent-haunted caverns,
By what rough tongues the tale was first expressed,
By choking fires or in the whispering taverns
With wine and omelette lovingly caressed,
Or what tired soul, o'erladen with a lump
Of bombs and bags which someone had to hump,
Flung down his load indignant at the Dump
And, cursing, cried, “It’s time we had a rest I"
And so, maybe, began it. Some sly runner,
Half-hearing, half-imagining, no doubt,
Caught up the word and gave it to a gunner,
And, he embroidering, 'twas noised about
From lip to lip in many a trench's press
Where working-parties struggled to progress
Or else go back, but both without success,
“Officer says Division's going out.”
It found the Front. It came up with the rations;
The Corporals carried it from hole to hole;
And scouts behaved in strange polemic fashions
On what they thought would be their last patrol;
While Fritz, of course, from whom few things are hid,
Had the romance as soon as any did,
And said, thank William, he would soon be rid
Of yon condemned disturbers of his soul.
Nor were there few confirming little trifles,
For James, rejoining from the Base, had scann'd
Strange waiting infantry with brand-new rifles,
In backward areas, but close at hand;
And some had marked the D.A.Q.M.G.
Approaching Railhead in the dusk, and he
(Who, as a fact, was simply on the spree)
Had gone, of course, to view the Promised Land.
And what a land Who had not heard its promise 2
A land of quietude and no grenades,
Soft beds for officers, fair barns for Tommies,
And rich estaminets and gracious maids,
And half-an-hour from Abbeville by the train,
A land of rivulets and golden grain
(Where it would be impossible to train
And even difficult to have parades)
Then it appeared the groom of General Harrison
Had news denied to ordinary men,
How the Brigade was going home to garrison
A restful corner of the Lincoln fen ;
But weeks have passed and we are as we were;
And possibly, when Peace is in the air
And these dear myths have died of sheer despair,
They may come true—but not, I think, till then.

TORPEDOED, AND I'VE GOT A LETTER FROM YoUR FOLKS INSTRUCTING YoU TO GIVE ME EVERY FACILITY."
A SURPRISE PARTY.
“FIVE-AND-THIRTY wounded Tommies
coming to tea and one of them coming
to his death, but he doesn't know it,”
moaned Emily, and waved a knife round
her head.
I saw what had happened. All this
bun-baking and cake-making had been
too much for my poor wife. She had
been living in the oven for a week.
“You’re overdone. Lie down and
try to get a little nap before they
come,” I said soothingly. “Every-
thing's ready.”
“Will he die without a sound, or
will he gurgle?” said Emily, and
brought the knife within an inch of
my nose.
“No one is going to die at our tea-
party, dear,” I said, and ducked.
“Not after swallowing that ?"shrieked
Emily, and lunged at me with the knife
again.
I got it firmly by the handle this
time, and I recognised Emily's special
cake-knife, an instrument wrought to
perfection by long years of service,
sharp as a razor down both sides, with
a flexible tip that slithered round a
basin and scooped up the last morsels
of candied-peel.
But the flexible tip was gone. I
understood Emily's distraught con-
dition. You can replace a diamond
tiara; money won't buy a twenty-
year-old cake-knife.
“Try and bear it, dear,” I said.
Emily pointed to the table weighed
down with Madeiras and rocks and
almonds and sultanas and gingers.
“It's inside one of them,” she said.
For the moment I failed to grasp
her meaning. She explained. “I’ve
made six dozen. The knife was all
right when I started; a little bent,
nothing more. It was when I was
mixing the last that I noticed the tip
was missing.”
It was a difficult position. There
was no time to submit the cakes to the
X-rays; the advance party was stream-
ing through the gate.
“Dear fellows I wonder which
one it will be,” said Emily, and clung
round my neck.
I put her on one side. “I’ll manage
it; leave it to me,” I said, and went
forward and welcomed our guests. My
mind was working clearly and rapidly,
as it always does in a crisis. When I
had got them seated round the tea-
table, “My dear friends,” I said, “this
isn't a Christmas party, but my wife
couldn't help indulging in a little
Christmas fun. She's just whispered
to me that she's put a surprise in one
of the cakes. I know her. It won't
be an ordinary sort of surprise. I
should advise you all to keep a sharp
look-out. There's a pound" (it was
worth a pound to save a hero's throat
from being cut) “for the man who finds
anything in his cake which hasn't any
business to be there.”
Within five minutes two pebbles, a
tin-tack, a chunk of wood and a black-
beetle were on the tablecloth . . .
“Do you know that flutter's cost
me five pounds, and there wasn't a sign
of your infernal knife after all?" I said
to Emily when they'd gone.
“I've just found it under the kitchen
table,” said Emily. “I am thankful.”

THE SIGNAL SECTION.
YoU know how the great hunter who
sleeps with his gun at his pillow is
awake in an instant, with all his facul-
ties alert, when the sacred spider breaks
a twig in the jungle 2 You remember
how the handsome highwayman, at the
first far clatter of hoofs on the great
North Road, is up and out on the
scullery roof of the inn before you
have turned the page, and is deep in
Lonely Copse (wearing the serving-
wench's stomacher) before his first fat
pursuer has said, “Open in the name
of the Law,” below his window 2 Well,
like Jimmy's bloodhound in Punch, I
am very good at that.
But it is a telephone-bell that does it.
You go down seventy-
two steps—backwards,
or you hit your head
—to a German room,
which smells German,
and you will find my
boudoir, furnished with
sandbags, a shaving
mirror and a telephone.
At eleven o'clock I
lie on the sandbags and,
like the great hunter,
close my eyes immedi-
ately in dreamless sleep.
At five minutes past
eleven the telephone-
bell rings.
That is what I am
good at. I leap to my
feet and say “Hullo 1"
Utter silence follows,
save (as Mr. BEACH
THoMAs would say) for
the monotonous drone
of the great shells burst-
ing outside.
I repeat my original
Tenant. “UM.
This is Zed Esses
do you want, Sir 2
Pip Ack five, Sir . .
“You called me,” I say.
He is more hurt than angry at that.
“Oh, no, Sir. You rang me up, Sir.
This is Zed Esses . . .”
I nip that in the bud by saying
“Hullo!” very loud. He realizes that
the game is up.
“Speak to Division, Sir,” he says
curtly, and clicks before I can answer.
A faint far gnat-voice says, “Is that
Zed Ess?”
“No,” I shout. “What the . . .”
“Through to Division,” says gnat-
voice and clicks me off. Another
voice carries on the good work. Up-
stairs the shells burst playfully on the
parapet, and under the starlit sky a gas
too late that this graceful gesture is
lost on him. “I am sorry, Sir,” I reply
with dignity, “but the delay was inevit-
able. It shall be with you on the break-
fast-table. The difficulty of communi-
cation in this great War . . .”
Division laughs sardonically.
At ten minutes past twelve I go to
bed again, and at twelve-fifteen an
orderly shines an electric torch in my
eyes in order to prevent my reading a
wire which he hands me. It says,
“Ref. your S.C. 1985 please ask PIG
if they have salvaged any German
socks. A.A.A. urgent.”
I stand up, and the orderly, com-
pletely unnerved by the sight of a Staff
Captain in undress uniform, releases the
button of his torch and retires under
New Tenant (digging up lawn and waste ground, to agent). “CAN YOU INFORM

I twirl the handle of
the telephone and lis-
ten. There is silence.
I turn it again with
vigour. For twenty
minutes I behave like
an organ-grinder. To-
wards dawn the bell
rings and I receive an
electric shock.
“Hullo!” says the
operator.
I tell him what I
think of him. When
I have finished the sun

plane is dropping its

remark. “Hullo!” I say brightly,
“Hullo! . . . Hullo!”
I shake the microphone. It sounds
as though sand had got into it, and
still there is silence. The minutes creep
on and my voice begins to fail. Outside
in the quiet night a solitary gas-alarm
chirps a few quiet notes to the stars
and is still. I continue to say “Hullo!”
At eleven-fifteen the operator at the
other end finishes the story of what
he said to her and what she, on the
other hand, said to him, and turns
refreshed to his instrument.
With a dexterous twist of his wrist
he sounds a deafening peal in the bell
at my ear, and says, “Hullo!”
I retaliate. When the score is vant-
age out, I put all the red tabs I can
into my voice, and his tone changes.
He is at once the cheerful and willing
artisan, eager to please.
“Yes, Sir . . . Yes, Sir . . . Who

almost hiding the cattle who are graz-
ing peacefully there in the long wet

At midnight I am through to Division.
“Is that you?” says Division. “There
is a list . . .”
“Finished, please?” says the opera-
tor so near and loud that I jump.
Division and I are at one here—we
are agreed that we have not finished.
Like the Brothers Crosstalk, we say so
simultaneously, using the same swear-
word.
The operator clicks off, baffled.
“That list of men for a bombing
course,” says Division.
“Yes, Sir,” I reply brightly, though
my heart sinks.
“You ought to have sent it in at
6 P.M.,” says Division. “And it has not
yet arrived.”
I look at my wrist-watch, but realise
It is a splendid force, as they used to
say in The Message from Mars—it is a
splendid force, the Signal Service.
And men sleeping among the rats in
the front line wake for their coffee and
hot water and envy me my undisturbed
nights.

crisis in Germany as one of the chief conse-
quences of the political utterances of English,

It seems superfluous.
“It is authoritatively announced that the
American troops fighting in France will very
shortly receive steel helmets, the design of the

insignia, the United States coat of mail.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. HoRACE BLEACKLEY, in his Life of John Wilkes
(LANE), the “Father (inter alia) of Radicalism,” provides a
vast amount of honest entertainment, and has handled his
vivid twopence-coloured subject with considerable skill.
There is plenty of humour to be extracted from the
vagaries of the friend of liberty. Some of the best of it may
be found in the consideration of this unsuitable parentage
of a solemn creed—for WILKEs of Medmenham Abbey fame
and The Essay on Woman was certainly not reared on cocoa
and flannel waistcoats. To the optimist hopeful of the
progress of mankind the notion of the patriot buying his
votes at Aylesbury at the price of five pounds a-piece will
bring consolation. We do things at least a little better now.
In other matters too we have made some slight advance.
WILKEs rode unmoved to Tyburn as sheriff to assist at the
hanging of a young girl-wife (with a husband pressed for
the Navy) for the stealing of a few yards of stuff in
Ludgate Hill to buy bread for her starving children.
Those who take pleasure in the playful repetitions of
history may summon a smile for this passage: “The
executive now [1769) held the legislature in complete sub-
jection. The individual politician had lost his independ-
ence, the majority in the House of Commons had become
the humble obedient servant of the Government of the day.
Its members were merely pawns in the political game, and
made every move as the ministerial hand directed them.”
As a Government-baiter WILKEs could give points to our
Hogg|E and PRINGLE. He was much less dull for one good
thing. I wish the code of our fastidious day would permit
me to quote the naughtiest of witty retorts made by the
patriot to his fellow-debauchee, Lord SANDwich. But alas!
I can only refer the discerning reader to page 69 of an
excellent biography.
The title of In the Wake of the War (LANE) is at least
one of cheery import, doubly welcome in these days when
certain gloomsters seem anxious to assure us, in the manner
of the apple-eater, that there ain't going to be no wake.
Mr. HARold Hodge is by no means of this persuasion; he
says, aptly enough, that if (as all but the cynics believe) the
War is going to leave behind it a changed world the sooner
we begin to arrange our plans for living in it the better.
The particular questions to which he devotes a volume that
(whatever you may think of its conclusions) is both prac-
tical and moderate, are those relating to “Parliamentary or
Imperial Government.” No one can deny that Mr. Hodge
has thought clearly and with insight upon this theme. I
liked the incisive candour of his excuse for daring, as an
amateur, to criticise Parliamentary Government, namely,
that while only a member could know it from within “on
the other hand it is extremely difficult for one who is, or
even has been, within to know it from without.” A reflec-
tion that explains much. Mr. HoDGE later elaborates this
with some trenchant observations on what is called (more
accurately than many persons suppose) the Game of Party,
showing how the delight in rule-twisting, in scores, and in
the chicane of Procedure came to exercise a wholly dispropor-
tionate spell over the mind of the professional politician.
His remedy, an Imperial council, independent of Parlia-
ment and expressive of the popular will through the refer-
endum, is ably worked out, with a due appreciation of its
difficulties.
Mr. SHAN F. BULLock's Irish stories have given me so
much pleasure that I feel myself an ingrate for setting down

the circumstance that his new novel, Mr. Ruby Jumps the
Traces (CHAPMAN AND HALL), has given me very little. But
truth must out. “Mr. BULLock Abjures Ireland” might
have been the title, for there is nothing of his own romantic
country, which he knows and loves so well, in it; but we
have instead a minute study of suburbia and all the mis-
understandings and ambitions and disappointments and high
spirits that make up family life there. Mr. Ruby is a clerk
in the City who, ascending one morning to the box of his
omnibus, discovered that it was Spring, and, returning
home that evening, found that he was out of tune with
domesticity and in need of an adventure. The next day
therefore he took a ticket to Morocco, telegraphed to his
wife that he was going away on business, and set sail.
Mr. BULLock does not convince me that Mr. Ruby was the
man to do this; but never mind, he does it. From Gibraltar
he returns to his shackles, which he really prefers, and the
rest of the book shows how this break-away changes things,
for his wife believes that there was another woman in the
case, and his daughters take courage from his own falli-
bility, and so forth. The history is done with immense
'which she came.
Dion discovers that the father has just died, and that Myola,
who has suffered badly from paternal cruelty, is left alone
to bury him. Admirable restraint is shown in the handling
of this rather embarrassing situation. Afterwards Myola
comes to England, and signs of the prentice hand begin to
appear in the author's work. Her picture of English
Society is lacking in distinction, and I was relieved when
Myola took to her heels and returned to the place from
Still there is undeniable power in this
book and abundant promise of better work to come. Let
me, however, beg Miss MUSGRAVE to eschew trite asides,
and not waste her time and ours in telling us, for example,
that “regularity is ever the fetish of a good servant, and
the making of one.” This kind of thing does not help
much in a novel qf which the publishers' opinion—and I
agree—is that it “touches the deepest roots of human
feeling.”

in which the tables are most skilfully and dramatically
turned on the Germans, and “the poor old Dragonfly"
not only manages to save herself but also brings into port
a German ship which by a wonderful stroke of boldness she
has captured in spite of her own battered and shattered con-
dition. This, I say, is my favourite, but there are others that
run it pretty close, for instance “The Hole in the Cliffs,”

I state this bald fact partly as evidence that Miss (I am
guessing) MUSGRAVE's story has been examined and ap-

it had failed to gain the highest award. The tale opens in
North New Zealand, among scenes most picturesquely
described and under conditions peculiarly intriguing. The
heroine is found in the wilds by a cousin, Dion Cosway,
who has come to search for her father and to tell him that
he has succeeded to a great inheritance. On his arrival

picture that has been painted many times, but never with
greater insight, a more sympathetic humour, or fuller
freedom from any yielding to the temptaticn of farce. It
will add greatly to the regret that so natural a writer
should have told us her last tale.

68 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 1, 1917.
T0 WILLIAM AT THE BACK OF THE GALIGIAN FRONT.
ONCE more you follow in Bellona's train,
(Her train de luxe) in search of cheap réclame;
Once more you flaunt your rearward oriflamme,
A valiant eagle nosing out the slain.
Not to the West, where RUPPRECHT stands at bay,
Hard pushed with hounds of England at his throat,
And WILLIE's chance grows more and more remote
Of breaking hearts along The Ladies' Way; .
But to the East you go, for easier game,
Where traitors to their faith desert the fight,
And better men than yours are swept in flight
By coward Anarchy that sells her shame.
For here, by favour of your new allies,
You'll see recovered all you lost of late,
When, tried in open combat, fair and straight,
Your Huns were flattened out like swatted flies.
Well, make the most of this so timely boom,
For Russia yet may cut the cancer out—
Her heart is big enough—and turn about
Clean-limbed and strong and terrible as doom.
But, though she fail us in the final test,
Not there, not there, my child, the end shall be,
But where, without your option, France and we
Have made our own arrangements further West.
O. S.
DUSTBIN.
HE dropped in to tea, quite casually; forced an entry
through the mud wall of our barn, in fact. No, he wouldn't
sit down—expected to be leaving in a few minutes; but he
didn't mind if he did have a sardine, and helped himself
to the tinful. Yes, a bit of bully, thanks, wouldn't be
amiss; and a nice piece of coal; cockchafers very good
too when, as now, in season; and, for savoury, a little
nibble with a yard of tarred string and an empty card-
board cigarette-box. Thank you very much.
“Why, the little brute's a perfect dustbin,” said my
mate; and “Dustbin” the puppy was throughout his stay
with us.
For six weeks did Dustbin—attached for rations and
discipline—accompany us on our sanitary rounds; set us
a fine example of indiffence to shell fire, even to the extent
of attempting to catch spent shrapnel as it fell; and
proved the wettest of wet blankets to the “socials” of
the local rats. Then, as happens with sanitary inspectors
in France, there arrived late one afternoon a despatch
requesting the pleasure of my society—in five hours' time
—at a village some twenty kilos distant as the shell flies.
I found I should have fifteen minutes in which to pack,
four hours for my journey, and forty-five minutes between
the packing and the start in which to find a home for
Dustbin. t
“Take the little dorg off you?” said a Sergeant acquaint-
ance in the D.A.C. “I couldn't, Corp'l. Why, I don't even
know how I'm goin' to take the foal yonder”—he glared
reproachfully at a placid Clydesdale mare and her totter-
ing one-day-old; “and 'ow I'm goin' to take my posh
breeches—” -
I left him hovering despondently over his equipment and
a pile of dirty linen.
We tried the M.G.C. We were on the best of terms and
always had been ; they said so. They apologised in advance
my health ; offered me some coffee and generally loved me;
but they couldn't love my dog. The Cook even went so
far as openly to associate my guileless puppy with a
shortage of dried herrings in the sergeants' mess.
Passing through the R.A.M.C. transport lines I rescued
Dustbin from a hulking native mongrel wearing an identity
disc. I judged the Ambulance would not be wanting
another dog; but there was still hope with the Salvage
Company.
The Salvagier whom I met upon the threshold of the
“billet” (half a limber load of bricks and an angle iron)
was quite sure the Salvage Company couldn't take a dog,
as they had an infant wild boar and two fox cubs num-
bering on their strength; but he thought that he could
plant my prodigy with a friend of his, a bombardier in the
R.G.A., the only other unit within easy distance. We
headed for the R.G.A. -
It was just at this point that there occurred one of those
little incidents so dear to the comic draughtsman, but less
popular with “us.” A moaning howl, a rushing hissing
sound, a moment of tense and awful silence, a devastating
crash, and the R.G.A. officers' bath-house, “erected at enor-
mous trouble and expense" by a handful of T.U. men and
myself the day before, soared heavenwards with an acre or
two of the surrounding scenery. “Yes,” said the Salvage
gentleman as he regained his perpendicular, “as I was
sayin', 'is size is in 'is favour (you'd better git down ag'in,
Corp'l)—is size is in 'is favour; 'e'll go in a dixie easy, or
even in a-(there's another bit orf the church)—even in a
tin 'at, if you fold 'im up, but I'm 'fraid the 'eads ain't much
in favour of a dog. Leastways the ole man I know was a
member of the Cat Club—took a lot o' prizes at the Crys’l
Pala . . .
“I think we'd better run this little bit, Corp'l,” my
guide said suddenly. It was advisable. A sprint along
some two hundred yards of what had once been a road,
with a stone wall (like a slab of gruyère now, alas) upon
our right, and we should once more have the comfortable
feeling one always enjoys in a “hot” village when there
are houses upon either hand. A trolley load of rations held
the middle of the road ; the ration party was, I believe,
in the ditch upon the left; and a strangled voice exclaimed
after each burst, “Oh crummy I do 'ope they don't 'it the
onions.”
We gave our forty-seventh impersonation of a pair of
starfish, and then legged it for the apparent shelter of the
houses. At least I did ; the salvage man, less squeamish,
found a haven in an adjacent cookhouse grease-trap and
dust-shoot. I listened intently, but it was only the falling
of spent shrapnel, not the patter of Dustbin's baby but quite
enormous feet. A stove-pipe belching smoke and savoury
fumes protruded itself through the pavement on my right.
Through the chinks in the gaping slabs there came the
ruddy flicker that bespoke a “home from home" beneath
my feet; and then, still listening for signs of Dustbin,
I heard— - -
“Didn't I tell you, Erb, to stop up that extra ventilation
'ole with somethin'?—and now look wot's blown in. 'Ere,
steady on, ole man; that 's got to last four men for three
days.”
*well, I'm —,” chimed in another voice, “if the
bloomin' tin ain't empty. Why, I only just opened it—
that's a 'ole Maconochie 'e's got inside 'im, not countin'
wot you've just . . . Poor little beggar must be starvin'.
You're welcome to stop and share our grub, young feller,
but I've got to go on p'rade wiv that—that 's a belt, that
is . . .”
I turned towards the dimly lighted road that led to
for the insanitary conditions I might find; inquired after
—[Censored]. Dustbin had found a home.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUDLARKS.
THE scene is a School of Instruction
at the back of the Western Front set in
a valley of green meadows bordered by
files of plumy poplars and threaded
through by a silver ribbon of water.
On the lazy afternoon breeze come
the concerted yells of a bayonet class,
practising frightfulness further down
the valley; also the staccato chatter of
Lewis guns punching holes in the near
hill-side. -
In the centre of one meadow is a turf
manège. In the centre of the manège
stands the villain of the piece, the
Riding-Master.
He wears a crown on his sleeve, tight
breeches, jack-boots, vicious spurs and
sable moustachios. His right hand toys
with a long, long whip, his left with
his sable moustachios. He looks like
DIAvolo, the lion-tamer, about to put
his man-eating chums through hoops
of fire.
His victims, a dozen Infantry officers,
circle slowly round the manège. They
are mounted on disillusioned cavalry
horses who came out with WELLINGTON,
and know a thing or two. Now and
again they wink at the Riding-Master
and he winks back at them.
The audience consists of an ancient
Gaul in picturesque blue pants, whose
métier is to totter round the meadows
brushing flies off a piebald cow; the
School Padre, who keeps at long range
so that he may see the sport without
hearing the language, and ten little
gamins, who have been splashing in the
silver stream and are now sitting drying
on the bank like ten little toads.
They come every afternoon, for never
have they seen such fun, never since
the great days before the War when the
circus with the boxing kangaroo and
the educated porks came to town.
Suddenly the Riding-Master clears
his throat. At the sound thereof the
horses cock their ears and their riders
grab handfuls of leather and hair.
R.-M. “Now, gentlemen, mind the
word. Gently away—tra-a-a-at.” The
horses break into a slow jog-trot and
the cavaliers into a cold perspiration.
The ten little gamins cheer delightedly.
R.-M. “Sit down, sit up, 'ollow yer
backs, keep the hands down backs fore-
most, even pace. Number Two, Sir,
'ollow yer back; don't sit 'unched up
like you'd over-ate yourself. Number
Seven, don't throw yerself about in that
drunken manner, you'll miss the saddle
altogether presently, coming down—
can't expect the 'orse to catch you every
time.
“Number Three, don't flap yer hel-
bows like an 'en; you ain't laid an hegg,

mount, I said, Number Five; that means
get down. No, don't dismount on the
flat of yer back, me lad, it don't look
nice. Try to remember you're an
horfficer and be more dignified.
“Now listen to me while I enumer-
ate the parts of a norse in language
so simple any bloomin' fool can under-
stand. This 'll be useful to you, for if
you ever 'ave a norse to deal with and
he loses one of 'is parts you'll know 'ow
to indent for a new one.
“The 'orse 'as two ends, a fore-end
—so called from its tendency to go first,
and an 'ind-end or rear rank. The
'orse is provided with two legs at each
end, which can be easily distinguished,
the fore legs being straight and the 'ind
legs 'avin' kinks in 'em.
“As the 'orse does seventy-five per
cent. of 'is dirty work with 'is 'ind-legs
it is advisable to keep clear of 'em, rail
'em off or strap boxing-gloves on 'em.
The legs of the 'orse is very delicate
and liable to crock up, so do not try
to trim off any unsightly knobs that
may appear on them with a hand-axe
—a little of that 'as been known to
spoil a norse for good.
“Next we come to the 'ead. On the
south side of the 'ead we discover the
mouth. The 'orse's mouth was con-
structed for mincing 'is victuals, also
for 'is rider to 'ang on by. As the
'orse does the other forty-five per
cent. of 'is dirty work with 'is mouth
it is advisable to stand clear of that as
well. In fact, what with his mouth
at one end and 'is 'ind-legs at t'other,
the middle of the 'orse is about the only
safe spot, and that is why we place the
saddle there. Everything in the Harmy
is done with a reason, gentlemen.
“And now, Number Ten, tell me
what coloured 'orse you are ridin'?
“A chestnut 2 No 'e ain't no chest-
nut and never was, no, nor a raspberry
roan neither; 'e's a bay. 'Ow often
must I tell you that a chestnut 'orse is
the colour of lager beer, a brown 'orse
the colour of draught ale, and a black
'orse the colour of stout.
“And now, gentlemen, stan' to yer
'orses, 'pare to mount—mount'
“There you go, Number Seven, up
one side and down the other. Try to
stop in the saddle for a minute if only
for the view. You'll get yourself 'urted
one of these days dashing about all
over the 'orse like that; and 'sposing
you was to break your neck, who'd get
into trouble 2 Me, not you. 'Ave a bit
of consideration for other people, please.
“Now mind the word. Ride—ri'—
tur-r-rn. Walk march. Tr-a-a-at. Hel-
bows slightly brushing the ribs—your
ribs, not the 'orse's, Number Three.
“Shorten yer reins, 'eels down, 'eads
up, 'ollow yer backs, four feet from nose

“Get off that mare's neck, Number
Seven, and try ridin' in the saddle for a
change; it'll be more comfortable for
everybody.
“You oughter do cowboy stunts for
the movin' pictures, Number Six, you
ought really. People would pay money
to see you ride a norse upside down like
that. Got a strain of wild Cossack
blood in you, eh?
“There you are, now you've been and
fell off. Nice way to repay me for all
the patience an' learning I've given
you !
“What are you lyin' there for? Day-

SENSES AND SENSIBILITY.

From Fred Golightly, comedian, to
Sinclair Voyle, dramatic critic.
DEAR Woy LE,--I am not one ordin-
arily to take any notice of remarks that
are overheard and reported to me; but
there are exceptions to every rule and
I am making one now. I was told this
evening by a mutual friend and fellow-
member that at the Buskin Club, after
lunch to-day, in the presence of a num-
ber of men, you said that the trouble
with me was that I had no sense of
humour.
Considering my standing as a come-
dian, hitherto earning high salaries and
occupying the place I do solely by
virtue of my comic gifts (as the Press
and Public unanimously agree), this
disparagement from a man wielding as
much power as you do is very damag-
ing. Managers hearing of it as your
honest opinion might fight shy of me.
I therefore ask you to withdraw the
criticism with as much publicity as it
had when you defamed me by making it.
Why you should have made it at all
I can't imagine, for I have often seen
i. laughing in your stall, and we have
een friends for many years.
Believe me, yours sincerely but sor-
rowfully, FRED GoLIGHTLY.
II.
From Sinclair Voyle, dramatic critic,
to Fred Golightly, comedian.
DEAR GoLIGHTLY,-You have been
misinformed. I didn't say you had no
sense of humour; I said you had no
sense of honour.
Yours faithfully, SINCLAIR Voyle.

From Fred Golightly, comedian, to
Sinclair Voyle, dramatic critic.
DEAR old CHAP,-You can't think
how glad I am to have your disclaimer.
I disliked having to write to you as I
did, after so many years of good fellow-
ship, but you must admit that I had
some provocation. It is a pretty serious
thing for a man in my position to be
publicly singled out by a man in yours
as being without a sense of humour.
However, your explanation puts every-
thing right, and all's well that ends
well. Yours as ever, FRED.

THAT there rumpus i' the village laast
Saturday night? Aye, it were summat
o' a rumpus, begad! Lor! there aren't
bin nothin' like it not since the time
when they wuz a-gwain' to burn th’
ould parson's effigy thirty-fower year
ago (but it niver come off, because 'e
up an' offered to contribute to the ex-
penses 'isself, an' that kind o' took the
wind out on't).
Ye see, Sir, there's just seven licensed
'ouses i' the village. Disgraceful? Aye,
so 'tis, begad — only seven licensed
'ouses — an' I do mind when 'twas
pretty nigh one man one pub, as the
sayin' is. Howsomever, to-day there's
seven, and some goes to one and some
goes to totherun. -
Well, laast Friday night me an' Tom
Figgures an’ Bertie Mayo an’ Peter
Ledbetter an' a lot more on us what
goes to Reuben Izod's at The Bell, we
come in to 'ave our drink. And, mind
you, pretty nigh all on us 'ad a-bin
mouldin'-up taters all day, so 's to get
them finished afore the hay; so us
could do wi' a drop. Aye, aye!
Well, fust thing us knowed — no
more'n a hour or two after—Mrs. Izod
was a sayin' to old Peter Ledbetter, as
'er set down a fresh pint for 'n, “That's
the laast drop o' beer i' the 'ouse,” 'er
says.
“Whaat l” says Peter, though there
warn’t no call for 'im to voice the
gen'ral sentiments, 'coz you see, Sir,
'e'd a-got the laast pint an us 'adn't.
“There's a nice drop o'cider, though,”
says Mrs. Izod. “Leastways, when I
says a nice drop, there's a matter o'
fifteel gallons, I dessay," 'er says.
“I 'ave drunk cider at a pinch,” says
Bertie Mayo, cautious-like, “and my
ould father, I d' mind, 'e'd used to drink
it regular.”
“Ah, that 'a did l—an' mine too, and
'is father afore 'un,” says Tom Fig-
gures; “but I reckon 'tisn't what 'twas
in them days.” -
“Well, you may do as you'm a-
minded 'bout 'avin' it,” says Mrs. Izod;
“but no more ain't beer what 'twas
neether, come to that.”
“You'm right there, Missus,” says
all the rest on us.
An' then Bertie Mayo, 'oo's allus a
turr'ble far-seeing sort of chap, 'e says,
“Reckon the trolley 'ull be along fust
thing i' the marnin' from the brewery,
Missus 2 ” An' when Mrs. Izod 'er
says as 'er didn't know, but 'twas to
be 'oped as 'twud, a sort of a blight
settled down on the lot on us, which I
reckon is a pretty fair way o' puttin' it,
for a blight allus goes 'and-in-'and wi'
a drought.
Well, either us finished that evenin'
up on cider or us finished the cider up
that evenin'—there warn't much in it
one way or t'other. An' next day—
this bit as I'm a-tellin' you now us
niver 'eard tell on till arterwards, but
I'm a-tellin' it yeou just as it 'appened
—next daay (that were Sat'rday, mind)
there was a turr'ble to-do in the arter-
noon, for there warn't nobbut lim-
onade in the house when them timber-
haulin' chaps stopped to waater the
engin'. Well, you may reckon' . . .
An' then, when us come 'ome from ||
work, us found the door o' The Bell
shut an' locked, an’ “Sold Out" wrote
on a piece o' cardboard i' the parlour
winder by Reuben Izod's second child !
Begad, that was sommut if yeou like
Us stud there a-gyaupin'an' a-gyaupin',
till at last Peter Ledbetter give a kick
at the door and 'ollers out, “Whatten a
gammit do 'ee call this 'ere, Reuben
Izod? 'Tis drink us waants, not tickets
for the Cook'ry Demonstration.” (Tur-
r’ble sarcastic 'e do be sometimes, Peter
Ledbetter). -
“I aren't got none,” says Reuben
from be'ind the door. * .
“Well, cider, then,” says Bertie Mayo.
“Tall'ee I aren't got narrun—beer,
cider, nor limonade — nary a drop.
'Tiddn' no manner o' good for you
chaps to stan' there. You'd best
toddle along up to The Green Dragon
an' see if Mas'r Holtom 've got any.”
Well, bein’ as no one iver yet ’eard
tell o' one publican tellin', ye to go
furder a-fild and get sarved by another
publican (savin' as 'twas a drunken
man as 'e wanted to be shut on), us
was struck so dazed-like as us went
along the road wi' never a word. But
us 'adn't got 'alfway theer afore us
met Johnnie Tarplett, Jim Peyton, and
a lot more on 'em all comin' along the
road towards we.
“Where be gwain’?” says Johnnie
Tarplett.

Dragon to get a drop o' drink,” says
Tom Figgures.
“The Green Dragon's shut 'owever,”
says Johnnie Tarplett. “Us was a -

“Aye, aye!” us sings out.
The Bell shut too !”
Well, then us all took and went
along to The Reaper, an' that were
shut, an' The Dovedale Arms (which is
an oncomfortably superior sort of a
'ouse, dealin' in sperrits) was down to
ginger-wine, an' The Crown and The
Corner Cupboard an' The Ploughman's

down to the bottom o' the casks.
An' then, when us took an' thowt as
'twould be 'ay-makin' next week, an’
dry weather all round, us stuud i' the
road and spak our thowts out.
“Dom the KEYSER 1 " says Peter
Ledbetter, to gie us a start like.
“Niver knowed sich a thing afore in
all my born days,” says Bertie Mayo.
“Niver knowed The Bell shut yet, not
since 'twas first opened six years afore
th 'ould QUEEN come to the throne.”
“Reckon sich a thing niver'appened
afore i' the history o' Dovedale parish,”
says Johnnie Tarplett.
“Niver since WILL'UM CoNQUEROR,”
says Jim Peyton.
“Niver since No AH 'isself,” says Tom

“'Tis a nepoch, look you,” says Peter
Ledbetter. An' though us didn' know

us were inclined to agree wi'm. Oh,

Peter Ledbetter was right 'owever, an'
them Greeks is at the bottom of all the

AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING. COULDN'T YOU DO SOME OF YOUR TRICKS HERE 2"
THE INcorrigiBLEs.
How AN EXASPERATED ADJUTANT would LIKE To ADDREss
THE NEw GUARD.
“GUARD ! for I still concede to you the title,
Though well I know that it is not your due,
Being devoid of everything most vital
To the high charge which is imposed on you;
Listen awhile—and, Number Two, be dumb ;
Forbear to scratch the irritable tress;
No longer masticate the furtive gum ;
And, Private Pitt, stop nibbling at your thumb,
And for a change attend to my address.
“Day after day I urge the old, old thesis—
To reverence well the man of martial note,
Nor treat as mere sartorial caprices
The mystic marks he carries on his coat,
And how to know what everybody is,
The swords, the crowns, the purple-stainéd cards,
The Brigadiers concealed in Burberries,
And render all those pomps and dignities
Which are, of course, the raison d'être of guards.
“With what avail? for never a guard is mounted
That does not do some wild abhorrent thing,
Only in hushed low tones to be recounted,
Lest haply, hints of it should reach the KING—
Dark ugly tales of sentinels who drank,
Or lost their prisoners while imbibing tea,
Or took great pains to make their minds a blank
Whene'er approached by gentlemen of rank,
And, when reproved, presented arms to me!
“There is no potentate in France or Flanders
You will not heap with insult if you can.
For lo! a car. It is the Corps Commander's;
The sentries take no notice of the man,
Or fix him with a not unkindly stare,
And slap their butts in an engaging way,
Or else, too late, in penitent despair
Cry, ‘Guard, turn out !” and there is no guard there,
But they are in The Blue Estaminet.
“Weary I am of worrying and warning;
For all my toil I get it in the neck;
I am fed up with it; and from this morning
I shall not seek to keep your crimes in check;
Sin as you will—I shall but acquiesce;
Sleep on, O sentinels—I shall not curse;
And so, maybe, from sheer contrariness
Some day a guard may be a slight success;
At any rate you cannot well do worse.”
Light on the Situation.
“FRONT of CRowN PRINCE RUPPRECHT.—At night the firing en-
gagement slackened but little, and near Hellwerden it again rose to
very great intensity.”—Admiralty, per Wireless Press, July 26th.
Readers who shared the doubt of The Times as to the
existence of “Hellwerden” (which doesn't appear in the
maps) will be interested to learn from one of our corre-
spondents, who knows it well, that it exists all right, but
is only visible in the very early morning. The Times of
July 28th bears out this statement.
Our correspondent adds the information that “Hellwer-
den" is sometimes spelt Morgendámmerung.

threatened with a first-class political
crisis and possibly a General Election
to follow. Members dwelling tempor-
arily on the Western Front had re-
luctantly torn themselves from their
dug-outs on the receipt of a three-
line whip, and had repaired post-
haste to Westminster.
The trouble was nominally about
the agricultural labourer and his
minimum wage. Should it betwenty-
five shillings, as set down in the Corn
Production Bill, or thirty shillings,
as proposed by Mr. WARDLE, the
Leader of the Labour Party? The
Amendment had the assent of the
hard-shell Free-Traders, who were
glad to snatch at any chance of de-
feating the proposed bounty to the
farmer. They had been further in-
censed by the appointment of Messrs.
MonTAGU and CHURCHILL to the
Ministry, and hoped perhaps that
some of the extreme Tories would sº
help them to give the PRIME MINIs-
TER a good hard knock.
Mr. PROTHERo made it plain from
the outset that the Government
meant to stand or fall by the pro-
posal in the Bill; and most of the
hear shortly that he has begun his la-
bours by reconstructing another hotel
for the accommodation of his staff.
With the spirit of expansion per-
vading the Head of the Government,
it is not surprising that the expen-
diture of the country continues to
rise. The panting estimators of the
Treasury toil after it in vain. Mr.
McKENNA's passionate plea for a
limit to our war-expenditure would
have carried more weight if he had
shown any sign during his own time
at the Exchequer of being able to
impose one. As it was, Mr. G. D.
FABER's interjection, “Do you want
to limit munitions?” quickly reduced
him to generalities. The House had
to rest content with Mr. BonAR

could not go on for ever, we could
go on longer than our enemies.

80 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 1, 1917.
Indeed honourable Members, even while
they laughed, were, I think, a little
saddened by the sight of this elderly
gentleman's pathetic efforts to play the
martyr.
Only twenty Members agreed with
Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD in believing,
or affecting to believe, that the recent
resolution of the German Reichstag was
the solemn pronouncement of a sover-
eign people, and that it only requires
the endorsement of the British Gov-
ernment to produce an immediate and
equitable peace. Not much IT
was left of this pleasant
theory after Mr. Asquith
had dealt it a few of his
sledge-hammer blows. “So
far as we know,” he said,
“the influence of the Reichs-
tag, not only upon the com-
position but upon the policy
of the German Government,
remains what it has always
been, a practically negligible
quantity.”
Any faint hopes that the
pacificists may have cher-
ished of a favourable divi-
sion were destroyed by Mr.
SNowDEN in a speech whose
character may be judged by
the comment passed on it by
Mr. O'GRADY, just back from
Russia, that “LENIN had
preached the same doctrine
in Petrograd.”

MILITARY AIDES.
LAST year, owing to the pressure of
other engagements, we did not mark
out the tennis-lawn at “Sunnyside.”
This year the matter has been taken
out of our hands by the military
powers.
Nevin was the first to think of it.
“What about a game of tennis 2"
he suggested one bright morning in
May. “Keep us from going to seed.”
It was his second day of leave after
lawn. Up to this point they were
perfectly amicable.
Then Nevin, who is a thoughtful
person, said suddenly, “I suppose you
made quite sure that the line of these
posts will cross the centre of the
court’” And then, before Bob could
retort, added, “Of course you ought to
have made absolutely certain of that.
As it is we had better leave this and
find the corner irons.”

disturbed for some twenty-four months

the change may have been too sudden

Bob; “let’s raid “old Beetle's' museum

Second-Lieutenant Robert Simpson,

hands.
Having seen the same forces co-
operating on previous occasions, I
determined to keep clear of them.
Besides, I am only “old Beetle.”
They found the posts in the tool-
shed, and, borne upon the initial
enthusiasm of their venture, began to

gan to show signs of im-
patience. Such terms as
“angles,” “bases,” “centres,”
interspersed with “futilass,”
“sodamsure,” “knowsevery-
thing ” were cast upon a haz-
ardous breeze.
Eventually they found

ordinary layman this would
have meant the beginning of
the end. But Captain Rich-
ard Nevin and Second-Lieu-
tenant Robert Simpson are
made of different stuff. They
scorn the easy path. They
have stores of deep know-
ledge to draw upon which
place their calculations be-
yond the ken of ordinary
mortals. After they had made
a searching examination of
the exhumed angle, Bob
pulled out a pencil, prostrated
himself behind it and then

over the top.

three walking-sticks and Margery's
new sunshade.
“What's he going to do now 2"
said Margery, with one eye on the sun-
shade.
He walked to the far end of the
lawn and manoeuvred in a small circle.
“The water-jackets are boiling,” I re-
plied, “and they've run out of cold
water. He's divining with the sun-
shade. Look!”
Bob suddenly drove the sunshade
into the ground. There was a sharp
crack and—well, he found another iron.
Of course he tried to explain to Margery
that it was an absolute accident and
he only wanted to get a sighting post;
but that was mere self-effacement, and
I said so.
Things began to happen quickly after
this, and if Private James Thompson
had not put in an unexpected appear-
ance they might have completed the
job without any further difference of
opinion.
In the merry days before war was
thrust upon us, James Thompson was
an architect of distinction. Obviously
an architect of distinction can reduce
the difficulty of laying out a tennis-
court to an elementary and puerile
absurdity. For half-an-hour the demon-
stration was carried on in the garden,
and, after Private Thompson had twice
been threatened with arrest for using
insubordinate language to a superior,
it was decided to finish the discussion
in my study, assisted by the softening
influence of the Tantalus.
Not for a hundred pounds would I
have ventured into the study. I picked
up The Gardening Gazette and en-
grossed myself in an interesting piece
of scandal about the slug family.
Suddenly Margery appeared at the
double.
“Do you know,” I exclaimed ex-
citedly, “it was the wireworm after all.”
“Come on,” Margery panted irre-
levantly, “buck up and we can finish it
before they come out again.”
In her hand she held a tape-measure
and an official diagram of a tennis-
court.
Five minutes later the experts emerged
from the house.
“Hullo!” exclaimed Nevin aggres-
sively, “what have you been up to?”
-- Ši. I replied, flicking over a page
on weed-killers, “Margery and I thought
we had better find the remainder of the
tennis-court while you were having a
rest. Margery's gone for a ball of
string, and if Bob fetches the marker
you can mark the court out now.”
Nevin's retort was addressed solely
to Private James Thompson, who had
in an unfortunate moment given way
to laughter of an unmilitary character.

“DIVISIONAL SIGNS.”
THE purpose of a Divisional Sign is
to deceive the enemy. Let us suppose
that you belong to the 580th Divi-
sion, B.E.F. You do not put “580” on
your waggons and your limbers and on
the tin-hats of your Staff. Certainly
not. The enemy would know about
you if you did that. You have a secret
sign, such as tramps chalk on your wall
at home, to let other tramps know that
you are a stingy devil with a dog.
There are many theories as to how
these signs are chosen. One is that a
committee of officers sits in camerd for
forty-eight hours without food or drink
till it has decided on an arrow or a cat,
or a dandelion, rampant.
Let us take it that a cat is chosen—a
A Higher Command enters his office.
Higher Commands always enter. The
office is hung, like a studio in one of
Mr. GEORGE MoRRow's pictures, with
diagrams of circles and triangles and
crosses and straight lines. The Higher
Command, being a man of like passions
with ourselves, has just finished tinned
Oxford marmalade and a cigarette. He
heads for the “IN " basket on his desk
and takes from it the “Arrivals and
Departures” paper. “Hal” says he
to the lady secretary, “I see six
new divisions landed yesterday.” He
pauses. Outside there is no sound to
be heard save the loud and continuous
crash of the sentry's hand against his
rifle as he salutes the passing A.D.C.'s.
“What about signs?” says the Higher
Command. The lady secretary says
He mutters a military oath against
the D.A.D.H.C. Then his face clears.
“Tigers?” he suggests hopefully.
“We might do a green tiger,” she
says reluctantly.
“With yellow stripes' " shouts the
H.C.
“On a mauve background,” says she,
warming to it.
And so one division is disposed of.
But it is not always so, of course.
After a Hun counter-attack, for in-
stance, the H.C. may gaze morosely on
his geometrical figures and throw off a
little thing in triangles and St. Andrew's
crosses. Or when the moon is at the
full you may have a violet allotted to
you as your symbol. One never knows.
My own divisional sign, for instance, is
an iddy-umpty plain on a field plainer.
quiet thing in cats—crim-
son on a green-and-white
chess-board background.
Forthwith (as adjutants
say) a crimson cat on a
green-and-white chess-
board back-ground is
painted and embroidered
on everything that can be
painted and embroidered
on—limbers and waggons
and hand-carts and arm-
bands and the tin-hats
of the Staff. And the
Division goes forth as it
were masked, disguised,
just like one of Mr. LE
QUEUx's diplomatist
heroes at a fancy-dress
ball, wearing a domino.

of it? None of your
naked numbers for us

Dugal. “I Doot, TAMMAs, THERE's somE INFoEMEESHUN THAT MAN LLOYD
GEORGE HAS GOT THAT WE HAVENA GOT.."
We vary the heraldry by
ringing changes on the
colours. On our brigade
arm-band it becomes an
iddy-umpty gules on a
field azure. If I could be
quite sure of the heraldic
slang for puce I would
tell you what it is on our
Army Corps arm-band.
On a waggon it used to be
an iddy-umpty blank on
a field muddy. But ad-
ministrative genius has
changed all that. A rou-
tine order, the other day,
ordered a pink border to
be painted round it, and
this first simple essay of
the departed Morse goes
now through the villages
of France in a bed of
roses.
We wish sometimes
sion marches through a village, and the
dear old Man Who Knows, cropping up
again in the army, says, “Ha! A red
cat on a green-and-white chess-board
back-ground? That's the Seventeenth
Division.”
You see it now? The enemy agent
overhears. The false news is sent
crackling through the ether to Berlin
(wireless, my dear, in the cellar, of
course). The German General Staff

BULLINGTON.
IT was in the high midsummer and the sun was shining
strong, -
And the lane was rather flinty and the lane was rather
long,
When, up and down the gentle hills beside the stripling
Test,
I chanced to come to Bullington and stayed a while to rest.
It was drowned in peace and quiet, as the river reeds were
drowned
In the water clear as crystal, flowing by with scarce a sound;
And the air was like a posy with the sweet haymaking
smells,
And the Roses and Sweet-Williams and Canterbury Bells.
Far away as some strange planet seemed the old world's
dust and din,
And the trout in sun-warmed shallows hardly seemed to stir
a fin,
And there's never a clock to tell you how the hurrying world
Oes On -
In the little ivied steeple down in drowsy Bullington.
Small and sleepy there it nestled, seeming far from hasten-
ing Time,
As a teeny-tiny village in some quaint old nursery rhyme,
And a teeny-tiny river by a teeny-tiny weir
Sang a teeny-tiny ditty that I stayed a while to hear:—
“Oh the stream runs to the river and the river to the sea,
But the reedy banks of Bullington are good enough for me;
Oh the road runs to the highway and the highway o'er the
down,
But it's just as good in Bullington as mighty London
town.”
Then high above an aeroplane in humming flight went by,
With the droning of its engines filling all the cloudless sky;
And like the booming of a knell across that perfect day
There came the guns' dull thunder from the ranges far away.
And, while I lay and listened, oh the river's sleepy tune
Seemed to change its rippling music, like the cuckoo's stave
in June,
And the cannon's distant thunder and the engines' warlike
drone
Seemed to mingle with its burthen in a solemn undertone:—
“Oh the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,
And there's war on land and water, and there's work for
you and me;
And on many a field of glory there are gallant lives laid
down
As well for sleepy Bullington as mighty London Town.”
So I roused me from my daydream, for I knew the song
spoke true,
That it isn't time for dreaming while there's duty still to do;
And I turned into the highroad where it meets the flinty
lane,
And the world of wars and sorrows was about me once
again. C. F. S.

Some other changes are not less but more
Needful to aid our progress in the War.

And, turning Trappist, stanched the fearsome gush
Of egotistic and thrasonic slush;

Or if our novelists wrote cheerful books,
Instead of joining those superfluous cooks

In times when ev'ry mad dog has his day,
Yet none the less inviting as the theme
Of a millennial visionary's dream.

“Sammies” for our American Allies appeared in his

issue (after quoting The Daily News as having said, “We
shall want a name for the American ‘Tommies' when they
come; but do not call them “Yankees'; they none of them
like it") he wrote: “As a term of distinction and endear-

HANSI, the Alsatian caricaturist and patriot, who escaped
a few months before the War, after being condemned by
the German courts to fifteen months' imprisonment for
playing off an innocent little joke on four German officers,
and did his share of fighting with the French in the early
part of the War, is the darling of the Boulevards. They
adore his supreme skill in thrusting the irritating lancet of
his humour into bulging excrescences on the flank of that
monstrous pachyderm of Europe, the German. Professor
Knatschke (Hodder AND STOUGHTON), aptly translated by
Professor R. L. CREWE, is a joyous rag. It purports to be the
correspondence of a Hun Professor, full of an egregious
self-sufficiency and humourlessness and greatly solicitous
for the unhappy Alsatian who is ignorant and misguided
enough to prefer the Welsch (i.e. foreign) “culture-swindle.”
to the glorious paternal Kultur of the German occupation.
And HANSI illustrates his witty text with as witty and
competent a pencil. HANSI has, in effect, the full status of
an Ally all by himself. He adds out of the abundance of
his heart a diary and novel by Knatschke's daughter, Elsa,
full of the artless sentimentality of the German virgin. It
is even better fun than the Professor's part of the business.
Naturally the full flavour of both jokes must be missed
by the outsider. HANSI is the more effective in that he
chuckles quietly, never guffaws and never rails. Fun of
the best.
There is not much left for me to say in praise of Mr. JACK
LoNDON's dog-stories; and anyhow, if his name on the cover
of Jerry of the Islands (MILLS AND Boon) is not enough, no
persuasion of mine will induce you to read it. Those of us
to whom dogs are merely animals—just that—will find this
history of an Irish terrier dull enough; but others who have
in their time given their “heart to a dog to tear” will re-
cognise and joyously welcome Mr. LONDON's sympathetic
understanding of his hero. Jerry's adventurous life as
here told was spent in the Solomon Islands, which is not,
I gather, the most civilized part of the globe. He had
been brought up to dislike niggers, and when he disliked
anyone he did not hesitate to show his feelings and his
teeth. So it is possible that for some tastes he left his
marks a little too frequently; but in the end he thoroughly
justified his inclination to indulge in what looked like un-
provoked attacks upon bare legs. For unless he had kept
his teeth in by constant practice he might never have con-
trived to save his beloved master and mistress from a very
cowardly and crafty attack. Good dog, Jerry!
I admit that the fact of its publishers having branded
The Road to Understanding (CoNSTABLE) as “A Pure
Love Story” did not increase the hopes with which I opened
it. Let me however hasten also to admit that half of it
certainly bettered expectation. That was the first half, in
which Burke Denby, the heir to (dollar) millions, romanti-
cally defied his father and married his aunt's nursery
governess, and immediately started to live the reverse of
happy-ever after. All this, the contrast between ideals in a
mansion and love in a jerry-built villa, and the thousand
ways in which Mrs. Denby got upon her husband's nerves and
generally blighted his existence, are told with an excellently
human and sympathetic understanding, upon which I make
my cordial congratulations to Miss ELEANOR H. Porter.
But because the book, however human, belongs, after all, to
the category of “Best Sellers” it appears to have been
found needful to furbish up this excellent matter with an
incredible ending. That Mrs. Denby should retire with
her infant to Europe, in order to educate herself to her

I enjoyed at a pleasant sitting the whole of Mr. FRANK
Sw1NNERTON's Nocturne (SECKER). I don't quite know
(and I don't see how the author can quite know) whether
his portraits of pretty self-willed Jenny and plain love-
hungry Emmy, the daughters of the superannuated iron-
moulder, are true to life, but they are extraordinarily
plausible. Not a word or a mood or a move in the inter-
play of five characters in four hours of a single night, the
two girls and “Pa,” and Alf and Keith, the sailor and
almost gentleman who was Jenny's lover, seemed to me
out of place. The little scene in the cabin of the yacht
combines a maximum of sinister
mystery with a minimum of actual
bloodshed; and, lastly, because our
credulity is not strained unduly
either by the superhuman in-
genuity of the hunter or an excess
of diabolical cunning on the part
of the quarry. Otherwise the story
is the clever young detective, in
whose company we expectantly
scour the bazaars and alleys of
Mangadone in search of a missing
boy. There are Chinamen and
Burmese, opium dens and curio
shops, temples and go-downs. Miss
MARJoRIE DouTE has more than a
superficial knowledge of her stage
setting, and gets plenty of move-

she has elaborated the characters

quite brilliant study in selective
realism. Take the trouble to look
back on the finished chapters and
see how much Mr. Sw1NNERTON
has told you in how few strokes,

precise artistry of this attractive
volume. I can see the lights, the
silver and the red glow of the wine;

Keith's patient, embarrassed, mas-

shamefully eavesdropping.
Fool Divine (Ho DDER AND
STOUGHTON) stands to some extent
in a position unique among novels
in that its heroine is also its vil-
lainess, or at least the wrecker of
its hero. Nevile del Varna, the lady
in question, is indeed the only
female character in the tale, and
has therefore naturally to work
double tides. What happened was

man and hero, dedicate, as a volun-
teer, to the unending warfare of
science against the evil goddess of
succeeded by a contribution to
Anglo-Oriental literature that will do ampler justice to
Miss DouTE's unquestionable gifts.
Our writers appear willing converts to my own favourite
theory that the public is, like a child, best pleased to hear
the tales that it already knows by heart. The latest ex-
ponent of this is the lady who prefers to be called only
“The Author of An Odd Farmhouse.” Her new little
book, Your Unprofitable Servant (WESTALL), is a record of
domestic happenings and impressions during the early
phases of the War. The thing is skilfully done, and in the
result carries you with interest from page to page; though
(as I hint) the history of those August days, when Barbarism
came forth to battle and Civilisation regretfully unpacked
its holiday suit-cases, can hardly appeal now with the fresh-
Still, the writer brings undeniable gifts
She has, for example,
perception and a turn of phrase very pleasant, as when
she speaks of the shops in darkened London conduct-
ing the last hour of business under lowered awnings, “as
if it were a liaison.” There are many such rewarding
the Tropics, yellow fever, met this
more human divinity when on his journey to the scene of
action, and, like a more celebrated predecessor, “turned
aside to her.” Then, naturally enough, when Nevile has
gotten him for her husband and when love of her has caused
him to abandon his project of self-sacrifice, she repays him
with scorn. And as the unhappy Christopher already scorns
himself the rest of the book (till the final chapters) is a
record of deterioration more clever than exactly cheerful.
The moral of it all being, I suppose, that if you are wedded
to an ideal you should beware of taking to yourself a
mortal wife, for that means bigamy. Incidentally the
book contains some wonderfully impressive pictures of
tropical life and of the general beastliness of existence on a
rubber plantation. At the end, as I have indicated, regenera:
tion comes for Christopher—though I will not reveal just
how this happens. There is also a subsidiary interest in
the revolutionary affairs of Cuba, which the much-employed
Nevile appears to manage, as a local Joan of Arc, in her
spare moments; and altogether the book can be recom-
mended as one that will at least take you well away from
the discomforts of here and now.

WAR AND MY WARDROBE.
As I am not a banker or a high official
swell,
I never felt a pressing need for dressing
extra well; -
And yet there were occasions, in days
not long remote, -
When I assumed the stately garb of
topper and frock-coat.
But war's demands, if you desire to
tread the simple road,
Are somewhat hard to reconcile with
the Decalogue of Mode;
So I gave away my topper to the man
who winds our clocks, -
With a strangely mixed assortment of
collars, ties and socks.
And if I haven't parted from my dear
old silk-faced friend
It isn't out of sentiment—all that is at
an end—
It's simply that the highest bid, in
cash paid promptly down,
I've had from any son of SHEM is only
half-a-crown.
“The plots cultivated by the men who have.
learned in the best school of all—experience-

OUT here the telephone exists largely
as a vehicle for the jeux d'esprit of the

working only from the inside out, for
if you have a trifle of repartee to impart
to the Brazen Ones the apparatus is
either indefinitely engaged, or Na poo

telephone orderly's elbow. . . After a
day or two it will percolate through to
the varlet's intelligence that you are a
desperate dog in urgent need of some-
thing, and he will bestir himself, and
mayhap in a further two or three days'
time he will wind a crank, pull some
strings, and announce that you are
“on,” and you will find yourself in
animated conversation with an in-
spector of cemeteries, a jam expert at
the Base, or the Dalai Lama. If you
want to give back-chat to the Staff
you had best take it there by hand.
A friend of mine by name of Patrick
once got the job of Temporary Assist-
ant Deputy Lance Staff Captain (un-
paid), and before he tumbled to the one-
way idea his telephone worked both
ways and gave him a lot of trouble.
People were always calling him up and
asking him questions, which of course
wasn't playing the game at all. Some-
times he never got to bed before 10 P.M.,
answering questions; often he was up
again at 9 A.M., answering more ques-
tions—and such questions !
A sample. On one occasion he rang
up his old battalion. One Jimmy was
then Acting Assistant Vice-Adjutant.
“Hello, wazzermatter?” said Jimmy.
“Staff Captain speaking,” said Patrick
sternly... “Please furnish a return of
all cooks, smoke-helmets, bombs, mules,
Yukon-packs, tin bowlers, grease-traps
and Plymouth Brothers you have in the
field 1 ''
“Easy—beg pardon, yes, Sir," said
Jimmy and hung up.
: Presently the phone buzzed and there
was Jimmy again. . . . .
“Excuse me, Sir, but you wanted a
return of various commodities we have
in the field. What field.” "
“Oh, the field of Mars, fat-head ' "
Patrick snapped and rang off. A quarter
of an hour later he was called to the
phone once more and the familiar bleat
of Jimmy tickled his ear. “Excuse me,
Sir—whose mother ?”
On the other hand the great Brass
Hat is human and makes a slip, a
clerical error, now and again sufficient
to expose his flank. And then the
humble fighting - man can draw his
drop of blood if he is quick about it.
To this same long-suffering Jimmy
was vouchsafed the heaven-sent oppor-
tunity, and he leapt at it. He got a
chit from H.Q., dated 6/7/17, which
ran thus:—
“In reference to 17326 Pte. Hogan
we note that his date of birth is
10/7/17. Please place him in his
proper category.” -
To which Jimmy replied:—
“As according to your showing
17326 Pte. Hogan will not be born for
another four days we are placed in a
position of some difficulty.

ing event occurs, 17326 Pte. Hogan

tained by all our brave Allies; it is an
educational centre. The French school
does the honours of the place and keeps
a tame band, which gives tongue every
Sunday evening in the Grand Place.
Thither repair all the young ladies of
the town to hear the music. Thither
also repair all the young subalterns,
also for the purpose of hearing the
IIlllS1C.
At the end of every performance the
national anthems of all our brave Allies
are played, each brave Ally standing
rigidly to attention the while, in com-
pliment to the others. As we have a
lot of brave Allies these days, all with
for Alabam.” It speaks volumes for
the discipline of the allied armies that
their young subalterns stood to atten-
tion even through that. PATLANDER.
THE GENTLEST ART.
PRIVATE Elijah Tiddy looked at his
watch. There was still half-an-hour
to the great moment for which the
battalion had waited so long. Most of
the men had decided to fill up the time
by eating, drinking or sleeping, but
Private Tiddy had two other passions
in life—one was his wife, and the other
the gentle art of letter-writing. At
“Dearest Wife,” he began. Then at
a shout he hastily drew in his feet as a
man dashed past him with a heavy
burden. “I nearly got it in the neck
a minute ago,” he wrote, “but I'm all
right, and this is a fine place if it wasn't
for the noise. They never seem to stop
screeching and the smoke is fair awful,
and as soon as you think everything is
quiet another comes. I am quite alone
at this minute, but don't you go for to
worry; they'll be back soon and then
perhaps I'll get a bit of something.
It's pretty hard where I am sitting and
I can't write you much of a letter, what
with the cramp in my legs and the noise
long national war-whoops, this
becomes somewhat of a strain.
One morning the French band-
master called on the Comman-
dant of the English school.
“Some Americans have ar-
rived,” said he. “They are
naturally as welcome as the
sunshine, but " (he sighed) “it
means yet another national
anthem.” -
The Commandant sighed and
said he supposed so.
“By the way,” said the chef
d'orchestre, “what is the Ameri-
can national anthem 7”
“Yankee Doodle,’” replied
the Commandant.
The Chief Instructor said he'd
always understood it was “Hail,
Columbia.”
The Adjutant was of the
opinion that “The Star-Spang-
led Banner” filled the bill, while
the Quartermaster cast his vote
for “My country, 'tis of thee.”
The chef d'orchestre thrashed
his bosom and rent his coiffure.
“Dieu !” he wailed, “I can't
play all of them—figurez-vous !”
Without stopping to do any
figuring they heartily agreed
that he couldn't. “Tell you !
what,” said the Commandant at length, I
“write to your music-merchant in Paris
and leave it to him.”
The chef d'orchestre said he would,
and did so.
Next Sunday evening, as the concert
drew to a close, the band flung into
the Marseillaise, and the subalterns of
all nations leapt to attention. They
stood to attention through “God Save
the King,” through the national an-
thems of Russia, Italy, Portugal, Ru-
mania, Serbia, Belgium, Montenegro
and Monte Carlo, all our brave Allies.
Then the chef d'orchestre suddenly
sprang upon a stool and waved above
his head the stripes and stars of our
newest brave Ally, while the band
crashed into the opening strains of

Sergeant will come and tell us
to move up nearer our part of
the line. I can see some of the
line, not our bit, from where I
am sitting. It's shining just

letter and shed proud tears at

some men this would have been an

and then a soldier, would have made
an inimitable journalist.
So he sat down as best he could with
all that he carried, and extracted a letter-
case from an inside pocket. It was a
recent gift from the minister of his
parish, who knew and shared Tiddy's
weakness for the pen, and it filled his
soul with joy. He fingered the thin
sheets of writing-paper lovingly, as

AN OLD SONG RESUNG.
“O EVER since the world began
There never was and never can
Be such a very useful man
As the railway porter.”
So ran the rhyme that in my youth
I thought perhaps outstripped the
truth,
But now, when longer in the tooth,
Freely I endorse it.
In calling out a station's name
He is undoubtedly to blame
For failing, as a rule, to aim
At clear enunciation;
But, since the War, he hasn't struck
Or downed his tools—I mean his
truck—
And plays the game with patient
pluck
Like a sturdy Briton.
He's often old and far from strong,
But still he doesn't “make a song”
About his lot, but jogs along
Steadily and bravely.
He doesn't greet with surly frowns
Or naughty adjectives and nouns
A tip of just a brace of “browns”
Where he once got sixpence.
But better far than any meed
Of praise embodied in this screed
Is ERIC GEDDEs’ boast that he'd
Been a railway porter.
THE TOWER THAT PASSED IN
THE NIGHT.
IT was in the beginning of things,
when the gunners of the new army
were very new indeed, and the 0000th
Battery had just taken up its first
position on the Western Front. As
soon as the guns were satisfactorily
placed the O.C. began a careful survey
of the enemy positions. Slowly he
ran his field-glasses over the seemingly
peaceful landscape, and the first thing
he noticed was a small, deserted, half-
ruined tower with ivy hanging in dark
masses down its sides.
“We must have that removed at
once,” he said to the Captain. “It's
the very place for an observation post.
Probably one of their best. How long
do you think it will take you to get it
down 2''
“Oh, we ought to do it in an hour,”
was the confident reply.
But the hour passed and the tower
remained just as peaceful, just as suit-
able for an O.P. as ever. The only
change was that many other features
of the adjacent landscape had been
resolved into their component parts.
The battery was disappointed, but
not unduly so. They knew what was

the matter; a couple of hours' work
should give them the range, and

But, when evening came and the
tower still stood untouched, 0000th
Battery began to be worried indeed.
A little more of this and they might
as well blow themselves up. They
would be disgraced, a laughing-stock
to the whole Front. After hopeless
arguments and bitter recriminations
they turned in with the intention of
beginning again bright and early in
one last stupendous effort.
Great and shattering was their sur-
prise when the dawn showed them no
tower at all, nothing but a heap of
rubble in the midst of desolation. The
hated O.P. had disappeared in the
night.
0000th Battery rubbed its eyes and
wild surmise ran from man to man.
“An unexploded shell must 'ave
gorn orf in the night.”
“A mine may 'ave bin laid under 'er,
and somethink's touched it off, like.”
But the real explanation, stranger
still, was supplied later by a letter
dropped from a Taube flying over the
Battery's position. It ran thus:—
“Having noticed with regret that
the enemy objected to the tower in front
of X position, the Ober-Kommando
gave orders to have it removed, in the
interests of the surrounding country.”
“Once or twice in the course of his speech
Mr. Macdonald spoke of himself and his
Labour friends as “we.’ ‘Who are “we” 2. '
sharply challenged Mr. Wardle, reviving a
question familiar in the amnals of split parties.
"You knof perfectly wel that you are not
inclueddin the “we,” ' was the retort.”

Pretty crushing, wasn't it?

DAVID.
THE War brought about no more
awful clash of personalities than when
it threw David and myself into the
same dug-out. Myself, I am the normal
man—the man who wishes he were
dead when he is called in the morning
and who swears at his servant (1) for
calling him; (2) for not calling him.
My batman has learnt, after three years
of war, to subdue feet which were in-
tended by nature to be thunderous.
His method of calling me is the result
of careful training. If I am to wake
at 7 A.M. he flings himself flat on his
face outside my dug-out at 6 A.M. and
wriggles snake-like towards my boots.
He extracts these painlessly from under
last night's salvage dump of tin-hats,
gas-masks and deflated underclothes,
noses out my jacket, detects my Sam
Browne, and in awful silence bears
these to the outer air, where he emits,
like a whale, the breath which he has
been holding for the last ten minutes.
And meanwhile I sleep. -
At 6.55 A.M. he brings back boots,
belt and jacket. This time he breathes.
He walks softly, but he walks. He
places the boots down firmly. He
begins to make little noises. He purrs
and coughs and scratches his chin, and
very gradually the air of the dug-out
begins to vibrate with life. It is like
Peer Gynt—the “Morning” thing on
the gramophone, you know ; he clinks
a toothbrush against a mug, he pours
out water. It is all gradual, crescendo;
and meanwhile I am awakening. At
7 A.M., not being a perfect artist, he
generally has to drop something; but
by that time I am only pretending to
be asleep, and I growl at him, ask him
why he didn't call me an hour ago, and
then fall asleep again. I get up at
eight o'clock and dress in silence. If
my batman speaks to me I cut myself,
throw the razor at him, and completely
break down. In short, as I say, I am
the normal man.
With David it is otherwise. David
is a big strong man. He blew into my
dug-out late one night and occupied the
other bed—an affair of rude beams and
hard wire-netting. He spread himself
there in sleep, and silence fell. At dawn
next morning an awful sound hurled
me out of dreams towards my revolver.
I clutched it in sweating terror, and
stared round the dug-out with my heart
going like a machine-gun. It was not,
however, a Hun counter-attack. It was
David calling for his servant. As the
first ray of the sun lights the Eastern
sky David calls for his servant. His
servant is a North-countryman. Sleep-
ing far off in some noxious haunt,
he hears David's voice and instantly

begins to speak. His voice comes swell-
ing towards us, talking of boots and
tunics. As he reaches the dug-out door
he becomes deafening. He and David
have a shouting match. He kicks over
a petrol-tin full of water, smashes my
shaving mirror, and sits on my feet
while picking up the bits.
Meanwhile David is standing on his
bed and jodelling, while his batman
shrieks to him that his wife said in her
last letter to him that if he doesn't get a
leaf soon the home’ll be bruk up. Then
David starts slapping soap on to his
face like a bill-sticker with a paste-
brush. His servant drops a field boot
on to my stomach, trips over an empty
biscuit-tin and is heard grooming a boot
without. .
David now strops his razor. It
is one of those self-binding safety
razors which is all covered with cog-
wheels and steam-gauges and levers
and valves. You feed the strop into it
like paper into a printing-press, and it
eats up the leather as low people eat
spaghetti, making all the time a noise
like a mowing-machine. David loves
that. He whistles gay tunes while it
happens. He whistles while he shaves.
He cannot whistle while brushing his
teeth, but he brushes his teeth as a man
might wash down a cab in a large yard
with plenty of room.
The moment it is over he whistles
again. Then he does deep breathing at
the door of the dug-out. (Aeroplanes
passing overhead have had narrow es-
capes from being dragged into the dug-
out by sheer power of suction, when
David deep-breathes.) Then he does
muscle exercises. He crooks his finger
and from behind you see a muscle like a
mushroom get up suddenly in the small
of his back, run up his spine and hit
him under the left ear.
Meanwhile he is whistling, and his
batman is making sparks fly out of the
buttons, which he cleans with glass-
paper and gun-cotton just outside the
door.
At eight, when I get carefully out of
bed, David is beginning to don his shirt.
At nine we move together towards
breakfast. ".
I am training David to say “Rah!
Rah!” against the day when he and
General RoosevelT meet in a com-
munication trench. I am sure they
will take to each other at once.

(Heavens, how I blathered ');
With an ardour undismayed and treacly
I proposed (without success) bi-weekly.
Now, my dear, it's up to you
To become the hero;
Show us how a man should woo
When he wills to win, and do
Teach us how to bill and coo
With our hopes at zero.
Chloe, for a change (it may amuse you),
You propose to me—and I'll refuse you.
From an auction catalogue:—

trained to the High School, Hant-le-Cole.”
Haute Ecole manners are usually of the
best and we are glad that Hant-le-Cole,
which we have been unable to find on
the map, provides no exception.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 99
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 30th. — The obiter
dicta dropped by Mr. BoNAR LAw
in the course of debate are gradually
furnishing the House with an almost
complete autobiography. To-day it
learned that while, unlike Mr. BALFour,
he reads a great many newspapers he
does not include among them a certain
financial organ which makes a speci-
ality of spy-hunting in high places.
When the National Insurance Scheme
was set on foot there were great com-
plaints because some Friendly Socie-
ties were not allowed to share in its
administration. Possibly the officials
thought them a little too friendly in
their ways. One of them, we learned
to-day, employed an auditor who signed
the return with a mark, like Bill
Stumps; while another auditor had a
habit of signing it in blank and leaving
the secretary to fill in the figures.
Mr. AsquitH used to allow his col-
leagues so much freedom of action that
his Administration was nick-named
“the Go-as-you-please Government”;
and eventually it went as he did not
please. But I cannot recall under his
gentle rule anything quite so free-and-
easy as Mr. HENDERSON's visit to Paris.
That a member of the War Cabinet
should attend a Conference of French
and Russian Socialists at all is in it-
self a sufficiently remarkable departure
from Ministerial etiquette, but that he
should be accompanied by Mr. RAM-
SAY MACDONALD, whose peculiar views
upon the questions of war and peace
have so recently been repudiated by the
Government and the House of Com-
mons, makes it still more extraordinary.
In the circumstances it was almost
surprising to learn that the complais-
ance of the Government did not
extend to furnishing Mr. MACDoNALD
with a war-ship for his journey.
What Mr. BALFour, who is respon-
sible for the foreign policy of this coun-
try, thinks about it all one can only
surmise, for he said nothing directly
on the subject in his great speech to-
night—a speech which earned him the
unique tribute of a compliment from
Mr. PRINGLE. But the For EIGN SECRE-
TARY's warning to the House not to try
to anticipate the work of the Peace
Congress may well have been inspired
by apprehensions as to what the ama-
teur diplomatists were saying at that
moment in Paris.
Tuesday, July 31st.—An attempt to
obtain further light on the HENDER-
son-MACDoNALD excursion met with
little success. Mr. BonAR LAw pro-
fessed to see nothing unusual in Mr.
HENDERSON's taking part in a Labour
Conference, and declared, on the some-
what slenderground that only the Allies
were represented, that it was not of an
international character. Mr. HoggE
essayed to move the adjournment, but
had omitted to have his motion ready.
The result of his hurried effort to draft
one was not satisfactory, for the SPEAKER
RAMSAY MACDONALD IN PARIS.

ruled that it constituted an attack on
Mr. HENDERSON and ought not in
fairness to be moved until the right
hon. gentleman was back in his place.

moment.

LoRD of THE ADMIRALTY walked up
the floor to take the Oath. Members
noted with satisfaction the buoyancy
of his step and the firmness of his chin.
If looks go for anything the Navy in
his hands will not relax the bulldog
grip upon the enemy that it has main-
tained these three years.
Asked whether the Government pro-
posed to institute a prosecution in
regard to the disturbance of the peace
(with alleged profane language) that
recently occurred within the precincts
of the Palace of Westminster, Sir
GEORGE CAVE gravely recited the words
of the statute providing that an offender
in such circumstances was liable to
have his right hand stricken off. All
eyes instinctively turned to see how
Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING was taking
it; but any anxiety that he may have
felt was relieved when the HoME
SECRETARY added that the statute in
question was repealed in 1828.
A question put by Sir HENRY CRAIK
about a C1 recruit included the state-
ment that he was “suffering from
Addison's disease”; and Mr. Hogg|E
voiced the general curiosity when he
asked, obviously out of solicitude for
the late Minister of Munitions, “What
is ADDISON's disease ?” It is believed
that the reply, if one had been given,
would have been “Over-dilution.”
Good progress was made with the
Corn Production Bill, and on the vexed
question as to how far allowances
should be reckoned as part of the
minimum wage an amendment was
inserted enabling the Wages Boards to
secure for the labourer a little more in
cash and less in kind. * -
In the Lords a satisfactory account
of the recent negotiations between
British and German Commissioners
at the Hague was given by Lord
NEwTo.N. Incidentally he disposed of
the suggestion that there had been
anything in the way of fraterniza-
tion. Both sides had held strictly to
the business in hand, which was the
exchange of prisoners, not of compli-
ments. -
Wednesday, August 1st.—The Peers
were to have had another field-day, for
Lord SELBoRNE had put down a mo-
tion calling attention to the alleged
sale of honours. But, to the relief of
certain of the recently ennobled, who
could not he sure what the Unnatural
History of SELBoRNE might contain,
the discussion was postponed.
Three hours' talk over Mr. HEN-
DERSON's dual personality left the
Commons still vague as to how a
Cabinet Minister becomes a Labour
delegate at will. Perhaps the Channel
passage may have had something to
do with it.

[AUGUST 8, 1917.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PICTURE POSTCARDS.
A LITTLE family party, with an ac-
quaintance or two added, sat in deck
chairs (at twopence each) at the head
of the pier. Their complexions proved
that there had been sun at Brightbourne
in some strength. Their noses were
already peeling a little, and the ladies
had bright scarlet patches in the V of
their blouses. To supply any defects
in the entertainment provided by the
ocean itself they had brought paper-
covered novels, the two most popular
illustrated dailies ahd chocolate. The
boy and girl shared Roaring Chips or
some such comic weekly. The father
and his gentleman-friend smoked their
pipes. All were placid and contented,
extending their limbs to receive every
benediction that sun and sea air could
confer.
A little desultory conversation having
occurred—“There's a lady at our
boarding-house,” said one of the ac-
quaintances, “who reads your hand
wonderfully,” a languid argument fol-
lowing on palmistry, in which one of
the gentlemen disbelieved, but the other
had had extraordinary experiences of
the accuracy of the science—the mother
of the boy and girl suddenly remem-
bered that not yet had postcards been
sent to Auntie and Uncle, Gus and
Beatty, Mr. Brown and Mrs. Venning.
“We promised, you know,” she said
guiltily.
“Better late than never,” said the
father's friend jocularly.
“That's right,” said the father.
“Come along,” said the gentleman-
friend to the boy and girl, “we’ll go
and choose the cards. There's a stall
close by,” and off they started.
“Don’t let them see everything,” the
prudent mother called out, having some
acquaintance with the physical trend
of the moment in postcard humour,
which has lost nothing in the general
moral enfranchisement brought about
by the War, one of the most notable
achievements of which is the death and
burial of Mrs. Grundy.
“Go on H" said the boy, with all the
laughing scorn of youth. “We’ve seen
them all already.”
“You can't keep kids from seeing
things nowadays,” said the father sen-
tentiously. “Bring them up well and
leave the rest to chance, is what I say.”
“Very wise of you,” remarked one of
the lady-friends. “Besides, aren't all
things pure to the pure?”
Having probably a very distinct
idea as to the purity of many of the
postcards which provide Brightbourne
with its mirth, the father made no re-
ply, but turned his attention to the
deep-water bathers as they dived and
swam and climbed on the raft and
tumbled off it. . . .
“Well, let's see what you've got,”
said the mother as the foraging party
returned.
“We’ve got some beauties,” said the
daughter—“real screams, haven't we,
Mr. Gates ?”
“Yes, I think we selected the pick
of the bunch,” said Mr. Gates com-
placently, speaking as a man of the
world who knows a good thing when
he sees it.
“My husband's a rare one for fun,”
said his wife. “A regular connoozer.”
“There’s a pretty girl at the post-

card place,” said the boy. “Mr. Gates
didn't half get off with her, did you?”
Mr. Gates laughed the laugh of tri-
umph.
“She's not bad-looking,” he said,
“but not quite my sort. Still x -
He stroked his moustache.
“Now, Fred,” said Mrs. Gates archly,
“that 'll do; let's see the cards.”
“This one,” said the girl, “is for
Gus. He's been called up, you know,
so we got him a military one. You
see that girl the soldier's squeezing 2
She's rather like his young lady, you
know, and it says, “Come down to
Brightbourne and learn how to carry
on.' Gus 'll show it to her.”
The mother agreed that it was well
chosen.
“Where's Beatty's 2" she asked.
“Here's Beatty's,” said the boy; “I
chose it. The one with the shrimp on
it. It says, “At Breezy Brightbourne.
From one giddy young shrimp to
another.' Jolly clever, isn't it? And
this is for Mr. Hatton, because he's so
fond of beer. You see there's a glass
of beer, and it says underneath, ‘Come
where the girls are bright and the
tonic's all right.' There was another
one with a bottle called ‘The Spirit of
Brightbourne,' but we thought beer
was best.”
“What about Uncle?” the mother
asked.
“Oh!” said the girl, “there's a
lovely one for him. Three men on
their hands and knees licking up the
whisky spilt from broken bottles.”
“Good Heavens !” said the father,
“you can't send him that.”
“I think not,” said the mother. “If
you sent Uncle that, all the fat would
be in the fire.”
“It's very funny,” said the boy.
“Funny, yes,” said the father. “But
funniness can be very dangerous. Good
Heavens !” and he mopped his brow,
“you gave me quite a turn.”
“Very well, who shall we give it
to ?” the boy asked. “We mustn't
waste it.”
“I don't care who has it so long as
it's not your Uncle,” said the father.
“And what have you got for your
Aunt Tilly?”
“This one,” said the girl. “An old
maid looking under the bed for a man
and hoping she'll find one.”
“Goodness, Maria!” said the father,
“are your children mad? The idea of
sending such a thing to Tilly' "
“But she is an old maid,” said the
girl.
“Of course she is,” said the father.
“That's the mischief.”
“Well, there's rather a good one
where a wife is going through her
husband's trousers and saying, “Bright-
bourne's the place for change,’” said
the girl. “Would that suit?”
“Of course not,” snapped her father.
, “Or the one where the bed is full
of fleas?” the boy suggested.
“No jokes about fleas,” said the
father sternly. “No, you must change
those for something else. Don't be
funny at all with either your Uncle or
Aunt. We can't run any risks. Send
them local views—coloured ones, of
course, but strictly local.”
“Mr. Gates helped us,” said the boy
meanly.
“Mr. Gates doesn't know all the
facts,” said the father.
“He can guess one or two of them,"
said Mr. Gates, jingling his pocket.
“Fred is so quick,” said his admiring
wife.

sure he'd laugh. But you couldn't
send Mrs. Wenning the old maid.”
“We got this for Mr. Brown,” said
the boy. “The nurse bringing the
father twins and calling them two
‘pink forms.'”
“That's dashed good,” said Mr.
Gates, “don't you think?”
“Very smart,” said the father.
“That's all right. And what about
Mrs. Wenning?”
“Well,” said the girl, “we thought
she'd like this one—a man and a
woman kissing in a tunnel, and he
says the tunnel cost ten thousand
pounds to make, and she says it's
worth it, every penny.”
“Very good,” said the father; “I
like that. Get me another of those

CHER Monsieur, Shall I write to
you of the toil, the fatigues which my
sisters and I must endure at the hands
of our country's Allies, without kind-
ling in your breast that flame of chiv-
alry which is the common glory of our
two races? C'est incroyable.
Let us then to my complaint.
We lived for many years, my two
sisters and I, in the service of our dear
master, who owned a beautiful château
in the North of France.
Our duties were simple—to entertain
the guests of M. le Vicomte after din-
ner on those evenings upon which he
gathered his friends around him.
For the rest we lived in the ease
which his kind generosity knew how
to provide. We loved our own par-
ticular boudoir, with its books, its pic-
tures, its comfortable fauteuils and its
soft green cushions.
Oh, Monsieur, it makes me to weep
when I think of my beautiful sisters—
the one with her laughing rosy cheeks,
the other pale as ivory, save for one
little black spot, which no man surely
could call a blemish.
Those were happy days. Often we
kissed, my sisters and I, for very joy.
Then it came — this terrible War.
M. le Wicomte was called away in the
cause of la belle France; but we would
not desert our home. One day, we
said, it shall be as of old.
And as the months went by it was
whispered that the English would make
of our château a house of rest for their

THE TWELFTH – NEW STYLE.
(Dreamt in a dug-out.)
IN my dream it was my first Twelfth
after the ending of the War.
The party moved off in file up the
slope of the moor, Sir Percy on his pony
in front, then the guests with rifles at
the trail, next the bearers and orderlies,
and in the rear the ammunition-limbers
and regimental baggage. A ration-party
would follow later. There was to be no
singing on the march, but pipes were
allowed.
Just as we neared the crest of the
hill, at a notice bearing the legend,
“Keep below,” the whole party entered
a deep “boyau " leading right up to
the trenches in front, from which
branched off various passages to the
gun pits, or butts, as we used to call
them.
Our position was semi-circular in
form and about three-quarters of a
mile long; its main strength lay in a
chain of machine-gun emplacements at
intervals of about two hundred yards.
These were, needless to say, all ar-
moured, but it was nevertheless con-
sidered bad form to fire along the line.
Further back there were a couple of
Archies and a battery of eighteen-
pounders.
Our instructions had been as fol-
lows: “At 10 A.M. the artillery will
open on enemy's main positions
with H.E., and at the same time the
Archies will maintain a barrage along
the far side, to keep them from breaking
away to Smithson's moor (a poor sports-
man, Smithson; uses lachrymatories.
All the birds we got off his place last
year actually had tears in their eyes
still). At 10.15 you will open fire with
machine guns and rifles on anything
under three hundred yards. At 10.30
the firing will stop and you will make
your way to the assembly trenches,
where bombs will be served out. At
10.35 the entire force will advance in
open order. No prisoners will be taken.”
My personal instructions were to hold
my position with two men. Hastily
lighting a cigarette and adjusting my
map-case, I was standing-to, when the
telephone bell tinkled. “Hello,” said
Sir Percy's voice, “all ready ? The
planes are out.” I glanced up at the
two 500 h.p. Liddell and Scott mono-
planes, which circled high up over the
moor. “What do they report 2" I
asked. “Birds in force at a.2.B.c.d.,
x.y.z.6 and A.b.3.m., and small parties
in and near the Heather Redoubt. .
At 10.30 I left my smoking weapon
and an empty flask, and at 10.35 went
over the top. A little later I brought
down no fewer than seven of the enemy
with one beautifully timed bomb, and
stole a furtive glance at the others.
Nobody had seen me do it. However,
I thought, I shall be able to tell them
about it at least three times to night.
Meanwhile our bearers were collect-
ing the enemy's dead and finishing
off his wounded. Away to the left
Sir Percy and half-a-dozen more were
gathered round what I took to be the
Heather Redoubt, and every now and
then a little white puff of smoke broke
from the ground. \
“What's the idea 2 ” I asked over
the telephone. “Rabbit warren,”
answered Sir Percy. “Bombing 'em
out. I always bomb 'em out. Smith-
son uses gas—poor sportsman, Smith-
SOn.
::: :: :k × ::
I was dozing lazily in the smoking-
room, vaguely wondering if I could tell
them about it a fourth time, when
suddenly the dressing gong went, and
someone shook me roughly by the
shoulder. Outside a voice was shout-
ing, “Gas!”
“Poor sportsman, Smithson,” I mut-
tered, struggling into my mask.
EXPERIENCES.
THERE are few of my friends whom
I hold in higher respect than the Flad-
worths. Fladworth is a prosperous
accountant, quite in the front rank of
his profession, and for the last three
years an indefatigable War - worker.
His two sons joined up on the day War
was declared; his three daughters are
all nursing, and for the last two years
their town house has been a convales-
cent home. Mrs. Fladworth is a saint
of hospitality, and their country house
is always full for the week-end with
people who want a rest. And one can
accept this hospitality with a good con-
science because they can afford it. It
does not involve the painful self-sacri-
fice shown by some people, of whom it
has been happily said that, when their
supplies are short, they will insist on
your staying for a meal, “even if they
have to kill a rabbit with a Christian
name.”
The Fladworths are charming hosts,
but they have a weakness—a passion
for intellectual games, serious variants,
for the most part, on “Consequences,”
and a most trying ordeal for persons
who cannot spell or are ignorant of
history or general information. More-
over, to add to the strain, Fladworth
is always inventing new games, “so
that all may start fair.” This hap-
pened on the occasion of my last visit,
when he introduced the company to
“Experiences.” Every one, having
contributed sixpence to the pool, was
expected to describe the most interest-
ing or exciting event in his or her
life. One of the party, who did not
compete, then decided which was the
best experience, and the winner pocketed
the pool.
I cannot remember all the episodes
recounted, though they were for the
most part serious and impressive. Mrs.
Fladworth had heard Mr. GLADSTONE
read the lessons in church; Fladworth
had heard TENNYSoN recite “Come into
the Garden, Maud" at a friend's house
in the Isle of Wight; a young invalid
airman, who was known to have had the
most thrilling adventures, but, after the
manner of his kind, never talked of his
own achievements, told us how fright-
ened he had been by the giant in his
first pantomime. My turn came last,
but I was not in the least helped by
having had the longest time to prepare.
I have a wonderful memory for futili-
ties, and when called on could think of
nothing better than my recollection
of the arrival of Hiawatha at the
Channel Islands and the delirium of
the populace. -
You can imagine my feelings when
old Mr. Fladworth, act. eighty-four and
rather deaf, who was acting as judge,
awarded me the prize on the ground
that nothing was more interesting than
the effect of poetry on the masses. I
hadn't the courage to explain that it
was not LoNGFELLow's poem, but that
terrible tarantellating American tune
which electrified the Channel Islanders
some ten years back. As none of the
company was able or disposed to cor-
rect him there was nothing left for me
to do but to rake in the sixpences.
After all, the total only amounted to
five and sixpence, and I compounded
with my conscience by putting it in
the plate on the following morning.

efforts to refloat the vessel, but were unsuccess-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT was a special duty of the late John F. MAcDoNALD,
who was cut off in his prime after incautiously adding
to his journalistic labours in Paris the voluntary and too
exacting duties of entertaining the wounded, to emphasize
the Entente Cordiale. Ever since KING Edward laid the
foundation of that understanding between England and
France, it was Mr. MACDoNALD's delight as well as his liveli-
hood to study every facet of it, both in Paris and in London,
and with unfailing humour and spirit, fortified by swift in-
sight, to present each in turn to his readers. The two best
papers in the first volume of the posthumous collection
of his writings are those which describe in vivid kindly
strokes the triumphant impact of the late KING on the
Parisians some fourteen years ago, and the visit, not long
after, of five hundred London school-children to the French
capital. Had Mr. MACDoNALD been spared to prepare this
book himself, there is no doubt that he would have subjected
his essays to revision and brought them into a more har-
monious whole; but as they stand, gathered together in this
volume, Two Towns—One City (GRANT RICHARDs), by the
proud hands of his mother, they have charm and vitality
and the authenticity of first-hand knowledge and lively
sympathy. The War, as we have just been reminded by an
impressive memorial service, has made deep gaps in the
ranks of English journalists, and the loss of John F. MAC-
DoNALD's quick eyes, happy choice of words, and intensely
human apprehensions was far from being the least.
Whether you enjoy The House in Marylebone (Duck-
worTH) will depend entirely upon your taste for the society
of a number of hardworking but sentimental “business
girls.” For this is the whole matter of Mrs. W. K. CLIF-
Ford's book. I call her girls sentimental, because (for all
that they are supposed to be chiefly concerned with living
their own lives) you will be struck at once with the extent
to which they contrive to mix themselves up with the lives
of any male creatures who venture over the horizon. “Our
little republic,” says one of its inmates towards the end of
the book, “is firmly feminine and hasn't done much falling
in love.” Well, well—I suppose this is a question that
turns upon your definition of the word “much; ” to me per-
sonally they seldom seemed to be doing, or thinking about,
anything else. Nor could I help reflecting how much fuller
and more vigorous all Mrs. CLIFFORD's cast would have
found their existence to-day. Perhaps this feeling explains
a slight impatience which the society of so much struggling
femininity eventually produced in me. Young women still
live in houses in the Marylebone Road; they still proclaim
republics of hardworking celibacy, and fall briskly in love
with the first eligible bachelor; but their vocations and
their citizenship have both (Hoch der RAISER!) grown out of
all knowledge. So that charming writer, Mrs. CLIFFoRD,
must forgive me if I could find only an historical interest,
and no very robust one at that, in her amiable retrospect.
AGNEs and EGERTON CASTLE have certainly been well
advised about their sub-title to The Black Office and other
Chapters of Romance (MURRAY). For that is precisely
what the tales are; and excellently romantic and thrilling
chapters too, for the most part dated in the decade follow-
ing the great Anglo-French peace of a century ago. Probably

you couldn't say off-hand what the Black Office was. Let
me whisper. It was, amongst other things, a postal censor-
ship that opened and perused all letters intended to cross
the Channel. With what natural indignation would you,
in July three years ago, have read of such monstrous activi-
tiesl Truly, as the authors say, there is some interest in
the comparison of then and now. Of the other stories, my
own favourites would be “The Resurrectionist” and “The
Smile on the Portrait.” The first of these is a haunting
affair of body-snatching, or rather of an early escapade of
the notorious BURRE, who was asked to supply a red-haired
corpse, and not finding one produced instead a gentleman
who had yet to fulfil the condition precedent to body-
snatching, i.e. who had to be killed first and snatched
afterwards. This is certainly as grim as anything I have
met over the Castellated signature. Beside it, “The Smile
on the Portrait,” the tale of a -
jealous husband who becomes
a maniac, is almost soothing.
They had clearly their little wor-
ries even a century ago. The
CASTLEs, as everybody knows,
have always had the trick of
adventurous fiction; The Black
Office, etc., proves that their
hands have lost nothing of their
cunning.
N
One has heard so often of
works of “absorbing interest”
that appeared at “the psycho-
logical moment " that one feels
a bit Squeamish about applying
these phrases even to such a
book as Mr. HARRY DE WINDT's
Russia as I Know It (CHAP-
MAN AND HALL); but honestly
their appropriateness cannot be
denied in view of the author's
peculiar knowledge of the too
mysterious country on which in-
terest just now is so poignantly
concentrated. He has not only
traversed Siberia as few, even
Russians, have done—that is an
old though still thrilling story
—but he has ranged at largel—""
over the whole country from Finland to the Crimea (the
only two parts, by the way, which he has made me
thirst to visit), and has gone with his eyes open. In the
present volume, touching only incidentally on his journey-
ings and still less on politics, he has tried to satisfy the
thousand-and-one questioners who, one imagines, have been
plaguing him not a little lately as to those intimate details
that really count in the life of a nation. He tells us for
instance how the Russians do business and keep out the
cold; how many of the women you could call pretty, and
how much mutton a Kirghiz can eat. Though some of this
is not new, yet the book has, as a whole, a most vivid fresh-
ness, and, if in the end the main effect is to make one
content to live out of Russia, that is a tribute to the writer's
frankness. At the least one is able to rejoice in his final
verdict of unqualified enthusiasm for his hosts, since he
found not merely acquaintances ready to welcome the popu-
lar English, but true and trustworthy friends in all classes
of the community.
Mrs. OLIVER ONIONs has a light puckish humour and a
smooth if over-hasty pen, and I don't think she quite does
her own intelligence (or ours) full justice in The Bridge of
Kisses (HUTCHINsoN). I liked her flapper heroine, Joey,
and the naughty nephews, the O.U.2's, and her sapper
lover, The Bridge Builder, who was a confoundedly long
time over his work, by the way, but ultimately came into
his own over his own bridge of kisses, built under a heavy
barrage of needless misunderstandings. But Joey's pip-
squeak shirker fiancé, Hilary, was altogether too foolish a
travesty of a man ever to have gained her hand or, having
gained it, to have held it against any real male in or out of
khaki. The fact is that “BERTHA RUck” can achieve some-
thing better than these meandering methods and this spine-
lessness of characterisation; and it is distinctly disappoint-
ing to see her content with the curate's egg standard.

THE THEORIST.
It is time that some of our novelists put up a statue to
- TNApoleon for services rendered
to the cause of fiction. In Miss
MAY WYNNE's A Spy for Napo-
leon (JARRold) his misdeeds and
those of his minions are made to
serve the purpose of emphasiz-
|ing the loyalty of the heroine
to her lover. This lover was
an Englishman of a type suffi-
|ciently familiar in novels—cold
and masterful, but, for some
|reason not apparent to me, ex-
tremely attractive. As he seemed
to be roaming about France with
the object of getting NAPOLEON
out of the way by any means
available, I am not certain that
he was playing the game, even
when we remember that the
rules of it were lax enough at
the beginning of the nineteenth
century. But we are not asked
to weigh carefully the merits of
character. It is just a romance
of incident, in which a hot pace
is set at the start and kept up to
the finish. In short you get a
good run for your money, and

THRILLS FROM THE TERMINI.
Mr. Punch, following the example of
his daily contemporaries, despatched
a representative to some of the great
London termini to note the August
exodus from town. The following
thrilling report is to hand:—
At Waterton and Paddingloo great
crowds continued to board the limited
number of West-bound and South-west-
bound trains. On being asked why
they were leaving town, those of the
travellers who answered at all said it
was the regular time for their annual
holiday and they wanted a change.
They were mostly a jolly hearty lot,
happily confident that at some time in
the course of the next forty-eight hours
they would be deposited in some part
of the West or South-west of England.
Those fortunate persons who had
secured seats were sitting down, those
who were unable to get seats were
standing, and, in spite of the congested
state of the carriages and corridors,
almost all were smiling, the exceptions
being those highly-strung and excitable
passengers who had come to blows
over corner seats and windows up or
down. Many of the travellers carried
baskets of food. Your representative,
anxious to report on the quality and
quantity of the provisions carried, ven-
tured to peep into one of the baskets,
and was in consequence involved in
a rather unpleasant affair, being actu-
ally accused of having abstracted a
sandwich
The engine-driver, questioned as to
whether he liked having passengers on
the engine and whether he considered
it safe for them, was understood to say.
that so long as they didn't get in his
way it didn't matter to him, and as to
its being safe for them, he jolly well
didn't care whether it was safe for
them or not. The guard, detained by
the sleeve by your representative, who
inquired how he felt about being almost
crowded out of his brake by passengers,
drew away his sleeve with some violence
and his answer was quite unworthy to
be reported. An elderly but strongly-
built porter, with the luggage of four-
teen families on his truck, and the
'fourteen families surrounding him and
all talking at once, was approached by
your representative for a little quiet
chat, but he became so threatening
that it was thought advisable to leave
him alone.
At Ticvoria Station your representa-
tive found a seething mob intent on
getting to those ever popular and
already much overcrowded South-coast
resorts, Paradeville, Shingleton-on-Sea,
Promenade Bay, etc. The eleven-o'clock
“Paradeville fast,” due to start in half-
an-hour, was at No. 20 platform. All
sitting and standing room had been
occupied for some hours, and the passen-
gers were enjoying the sport of seeing
the later arrivals running the whole
length of the train and back again in
the mad hope of finding places. Your
representative managed to get a word
with some of these later arrivals, and
asked them how they liked running up
and down, and whether they were much
disappointed at not finding room; but
the answers were mostly unsatisfactory
and in some cases uncivil. The booking.
clerk, questioned as to the phraseology
employed by August holiday folk in
asking for their tickets, whether it is
“Third return, please,” or “Third re-
turn,” or “Third return and look sharp,”
showed by his answer that the ex-
pression “please” is falling into desue-
tude on these occasions, his exact words
being “There's precious little “please'
knocking about, and anyone who has
the cheek to tell me to ‘look sharp' is
jolly well kept waiting till the last!”
Your representative, wishing to report
at first-hand the experience of those
who were travelling thirty in a com-
partment meant to accommodate ten in
the “Paradeville fast,” tried to get in
and make a thirty-first, explaining that
it was only for a minute and was with
the object of getting local colour, but
was forcibly expelled, and, falling on
the platform and sustaining some slight
contusions, decided to cease reporting
on August scenes at the great termini
for that day.
TWO DUMB WARRIORS.
I.—HYLDEBRAND.
WHEN the Heatherdale Hussars re-
ceived a two-hours' notice to “trek”
they, of course, dumped their mascot,
Hyldebrand, a six-months - old wild
boar, at the Town Major's. They would
have done the same with a baby or a full-
grown hippopotamus. The harassed
T.M. discovered Hyldebrand in the
next stable to his slightly hysterical
horse the morning after the H.H. had
evacuated, and informed me (his village
Sanitary Inspector) that “as I was
fond of animals” (he had seen me dis-
tributing fly-traps and painting horse-
trough notice-boards) I was henceforth
in sole command of Hyldebrand
until such time as his owners should
reclaim him. A grant of five sous per
diem had been left for the piglette's
maintenance.
I took charge of Hyldebrand, pro-
vided an old dog-kennel for his shelter,
an older dog-collar for his adornment
and six yards of “flex” for his restraint.
I further appointed the runner—a youth
from Huddersfield, nicknamed “Isin-
glass,” in playful sarcastic comment on
his speed—second in command. He
was to feed, groom and exercise Hylde-
brand. I would inspect Hyldebrand
twice a week.
Hyldebrand rose fast in village pop-
ularity. One forgot that his parents
had been shot for cattle maiming, body
snatching, breaking into granaries and
defying the gendarmerie on the public
roads. But Hyldy was all docility. He
ate his way through the grant, the
office stationery, and the central tin
dump with the most disarming naivété.
He was the spoilt darling of every
mess. The reflected glory which Isin-
glass and myself enjoyed was positively
embarrassing.
But as the summer advanced so
did Hyldebrand. He became (to quote
his keeper) a “battle pig,” with the
head of a pantomime dragon, fore-
quarters of a bison, the hind-legs of a
deer and a back like an heraldic scrub-
bing-brush. In March I had inspected
him as he sat upon my knee. In June
I shook hands with him as he strained
at his tether. In mid-September we
nodded to each other from opposite
sides of a barbed wire fence. Yet
Isinglass retained the most complete
mastery of his ferocious looking protégé,
and beneath his skilful massage Hylde-
brand would throw himself upon the
ground and guggle in a porcine ecstacy.
One sunny afternoon, when there had
come upon the little village street the
inevitable hush which preceded Hylde-
brand's hour for exercise, I espied the
village cripple making for his home
with the celerity of an A 1 man. He
glared reproachfully at me, and, with
an exclamation of “Sacré sanglier 1"
vanished in the open doorway of the
local boulangerie, that being nearer than
his cottage. Then came Hyldebrand,
froth on his snout and murder in his
little eyes, and after him Isinglass more
than living up to his equine namesake.
I joined him, and, following Hyldy in
a cloud of dust, the runner informed
me between gasps that it was “along of
burning his snout—raking for a bully-
beef tin in the insinuator.”
A band outside B Mess was nearing
the climax of GRIEG's “Peer Gynt."
suite. Hyldebrand just failed to per-
petrate the time-worn gag of jump-
ing through the big drum, but he con-
trived to make that final crashing chord
sound like the last sneeze of a giant
dying of hay-fever. The rest the crowd
saw through a film of dust. Hylde-
brand headed for the turning by the
school, reached it as the gates opened
to release young France, and comedy
would have turned to tragedy but for
the point duty M.P. and his revolver.

me a day or so after. The note, which
was addressed to and had been opened
by the T.M., stated that Hyldebrand
was being sent for by the Heatherdale
Hussars on the morrow. Outside the
parcel was scrawled, above the initials
of the G.H.Q. officers' cook, a friend of
mine, “It's top hole—try it with a
drop of sauce.” Inside was a cold pork
chop !
II.-ERMYNTRUDE.
It so happened in a quiet part of the
line that men were scarce and work
abundant, so it was decided to use
mules to carry the rations further than
usual. All went well until one night
when friend Fritz changed his habits
and put some assorted fireworks rather
near the mules. -
Now the transport, being human and
moreover unaccustomed to fireworks,
disliked this entertainment. Therefore
they sought what shelter they could.
In a few minutes the Hun repented,
but no mules and no rations could the
transport see. Moreover it began to
rain. So back they went and spoke at
great length of the hundreds of seven-
teen-inch which had blown up all the
mules.
The morning began to come and a
machine-gun subaltern, looking at a
black East in search of daylight, so
that he might say, “It is now light; I
may go to bed,” was somewhat startled.
“For,” he said, “I have received shocks
as the result of too much whisky of
old, but from a split tea and chloride
of lime—no It must be the pork and
beans.” However, he collected eight
| puzzled but peaceful mules and handed
them to a still more bewildered adjutant,
who knew not if they were “trench
stores" or “articles to be returned to
salvage.”
In the meanwhile the Transport
Officer was making inquiries, and he
recovered the eight mules. “All,” he
said, “are back, except Ermyntrude. I
grieve for Ermyntrude, but still more
for my driver's fate.” -
Where Ermyntrude spent the day no
one knows. All that is known is of her
conduct the next night. About eleven
o'clock she stepped on a shelter, and,
being a heavy mule, came into the
trench abruptly. This worried but did
not hurt her, and she proceeded down
the trench at a steady"trot, bumping
into the traverses. She met a ration
party, and for the first time in their
lives they took refuge over the top, for
Ermyntrude was angry.
Ermyntrude reached the end of the
trench and somehow got out, heading,
by chance, for Germany. That was
her undoing. In a minute or so three
machine-guns began firing, bombs and
rifle shots were heard, and Verey lights
innumerable flared. We never saw
Ermyntrude again. But we heard of
her—or rather we read of her—for the
German official report wrote herepitaph,
thus: “Near the village of hostile
raiding detachments were repulsed by
our machine-gun fire.”
Motto for Allotment-Holders.
“LET Us SPIRAY.”

filled so well, the Rev. —, who is taking on
the pork of the parish for the duration of the
war.”—Bath and Wilts Chronicle.
We trust it will agree with him.

MY DEAR CHARLEs, Since I last
wrote to you I have enjoyed seeing
again an officer with whom I had many
curious dealings in the past, and who,
if half the facts he divulges about him-
self were true, would certainly be the
wickedest Colonel in the B.E.F., not-
withstanding that he fought busily in
the early stages and had the best part
of himself knocked out in so doing.
He has performed many strange duties
since, and the steps he took to qualify
for one of them will, I think, illustrate
for you his wickedness.
It has been found, on experience,
that modesty is out of place when
you are being called upon to state
your qualifications for a post. The
knowing, upon being asked T_
if they possess certain at-
tributes, reply in an im-
mediate affirmative and
add others, just to be on
the safe side. It is felt
that what is really re-
quired in this War is thrust
and ingenuity, things
which adequately make
up for the absence of any
specialist knowledge. Ac-
cordingly my friend found a
himself described as pos- -
sessing, among *...*
things, “French, fluent.”
It was not until he was
informed that the Qfficial
Interpreter would like to
hear a little of this that he
looked more closely into
the matter and discovered
My friend made no endeavour to
follow these simple questions. He
knew he couldn't succeed and had no
intention of giving himself away by an
attempt. Advancing towards the In-
terpreter's table and putting his right
hand to his ear, “Pardon, monsieur,”
he said, “mais je suis un peu sourd,
depuis mon accident.”
“Quel accident 2 ” said the Inter-
preter; after which my friend did not
stop talking until he was passed out
with a “French, garrulous.”
We met quite recently and talked
over things in general, telling each
other, in confidence and on the best
authority, all those exciting details of

that two days is a short time in which

is due to the last thing he saw before
he left his office: three men standing
at his gate, in that attitude of contented
and contemplative leisure which one
associates with Saturday afternoons

in particular and spitting thoughtfully
as occasion required. One of them was
a British soldier, one a French soldier
and one a German soldier. The whole

“All ranks will take the utmost care

inspection and to make the inspection
a success. As the General passes along
the lines inspecting you, you will stand

will be asked if you have any oom-

have an opportunity of making a com-
plaint in the correct manner.

A TRACT FOR GROUSERS.
Ernest and I were seated by the
river. It was very pleasant there, and
it seemed a small thing to us that we
were both still disabled.
“Did you ever say to yourself, when
you were out there, that if ever you
got out of it alive you'd never grumble
at anything again 2" said Ernest.
My reply was in the affirmative.
We were silent for a while, remorse
weighing heavily upon us.
“The worst case,” said Ernest at
length, “was when I got my com-
mission and came home for my kit.”
I composed myself to listen, piously
determined not to grumble however
tedious I might find his récital.
“We'd been near a place called
Ypres,” he began.
“I seem to have heard the name,”
I murmured.
“I hadn't been sleeping really well
for a week—we'd been in the trenches
that time—and before that I had lain
somewhat uneasily upon a concrete
floor.”
“Yes, concrete is hard, isn't it?”
I said. '
“We came out at three in the morn-
ing, and arrived at our billets about
seven. I knew this commission was
on the tapis—French word meaning
carpet—so I hung round not daring to
turn in. At eleven o'clock I had orders
to push off home to get my kit. You'll
guess I didn't want asking twice. I
made my way to the railhead at once
in case of any hitch, and had to wait
some time for a train. It was a goods
train when it came, but it did quite
well and deposited me outside the port
of embarkation about nine o'clock at
night. I walked on into the port and
found the ship that was crossing next
morning. I went below in search of
a cabin. There was a French sailor
there to whom I explained my need.”

Ernest's opinion of his mastery of the
French language, but he ignored this.

on, “too dark for him to see that I was

bit of side and he took me for an officer.”

I saw that the officer in the next cabin
had a candle, and there was no candle

me, something of the tract about it.

Fritz (with a meaning smile). If I might venture so far,
I would suggest to his Royal Highness that he should wear
the Trench uniform, which I arranged with the bullet-holes
and the mud-splashes. It creates a greater effect, especially
if the visitor be a lady.
The C. P. Fritz, you dog, how dare you ? Very well, -
have it your own way and let it be the Trench uniform.
Fritz. I am only anxious to promote his Royal Highness's
interest in every possible way. -
The C. P. I know, I know. Only we shall have old
HINDENBURG growling and grunting and looking as black
as a thundercloud. I cannot imagine what my revered
father sees in that old wooden effigy, whose only idea of
strategy is to retreat from strong positions. That, at any
rate, is not the fashion in which 1 have learnt war. I'm
thoroughly tired of hearing of all these HINDENBURG plans,
which come to nothing.
Fritz. Your Royal Highness is, of course, right. But
what I say to myself is that the ALL-HIGHEST, your Royal
Highness's most gracious father, has in all this a deep-laid
design to show conclusively that all these HINDENBURG
plans mean nothing, so that in the end true skill and merit
may have a chance, and the chief command may be placed |
in the only hands that are fit to exercise it. Oh, yes, I
know what I'm talking about, and everyone I meet says
the same.
The C. P. I have always felt that that must be so. No
matter, a time will come. By the way, Fritz, have you
packed up the Sèvres dinner-service?
Fritz. I have already packed six from as many different
French and Belgian houses, and have sent them to Berlin,
according to your Royal Highness's directions. Which
does your Royal Highness refer to ?
The C. P. I mean the one with the simple pattern of
pink flowers and the coat-of-arms.
Fritz. Yes, that I have packed like the rest and have
sent off. -
The C. P. And the silver dishes and the lace 2
Fritz. Yes, they have all gone.
The C. P. Good. And the clocks 2
Fritz. Yes, I did in every case what your Royal Highness
ordered me to do.
The C. P. And you packed them, I hope, with the
greatest care?
Fritz. I did nothing, I am certain, will suffer damage.
The C. P. Excellent. War is, no doubt, a rough and
brutal affair, but at least it cannot be said that we
Prussians do not behave like gentlemen.
Fritz. Your Royal Highness speaks, as always, the plain
truth. How different from the degenerate French and the
intolerable English.
The C. P. Yes, Fritz; and now you can go. Stay; there
was something I wanted to ask you. Dear me, I am
losing my memory. Ah! I have it. How is my offensive
getting on 2 Has any news come in from the Chemin des

Fritz. Your Royal Highness's offensive has not advanced
to any great extent. The French last night recaptured all
their positions and even penetrated into ours.

bungled, of course. Well, well, I shall have to put it right

THE HUMILIATION OF THE PALFREY.
WHERE is she now, the pride of the battalion,
That ambled always at the Colonel's side,
A fair white steed, like some majestic galleon
Which takes deliberate the harbour tide,
So soft, so slow, she scarcely seems to stir 2
And that, indeed, was very true of her
* Who was till late, so kind her character,
The only horse the Adjutant could ride.
Ever she led the regiment on its journeys,
And held sweet converse with the Colonel's gee:
Of knights, no doubt, and old heroic tourneys,
And how she bare great ladies o'er the lea;
And on high hill-sides, when the men felt dead,
Far up the height they viewed her at the head,
A star of hope, and shook themselves, and said,
“If she can do it, dammit, so can we' "
But where is now my Adjutantial palfrey 2
In front no longer but in rear to-day,
Behind the bicycles, and not at all free
To be familiar with the General's gray,
She walks in shame with all those misanthropes,
The sad pack-animals who have no hopes
But must by men be led about on ropes,
Condemned till death to carry S.A.A.,
And bombs, and beef, and officers' valises;
And I at eve have marked my wistful mare
By thronging dumps where cursing never ceases
And rations come, for oft she brings them there,
Patient, aloof; and when the shrapnel dropp'd
And the young mules complained and kicked and
hopp'd,
She only stood unmoved, with one leg propp'd,
As if she heard it not or did not care;
Or heard, maybe, but hoped to get a Blighty;
For on her past she lately seemed to brood
And dreamed herself once more among the mighty,
By grooms beloved and reverently shoed;
But now she has no standing in the corps,
And Death itself would hardly be a bore,
Save that, although she carries me no more,
'Tis something still to carry up my food.

Hospital Wardmaid (who has shown the new matron into her room). “WELL, I MUST SAY I HOPE YOU 'VE COME TO STAY.
THE SIXTH MATRON I'VE TRAINED.”
YoU 'LL BE
AT THE PLAY.
“THE BETTER 'OLE.”
I MUST congratulate Mr. CHARLES
CoCHRAN on his courage in trans-
forming the Oxford Music-hall into a
home of “the legitimate,” and still
more on his good fortune in securing
for the initiation of his new venture
the play which Captain BRUCE BAIRNs-
FATHER and Captain ARTHUR ELIOT
have written round the adventures of
“Old Bill.” In form it resembles a
revue, but I prefer to call it a play,
because it possesses a plot, distinct if
slight—an encumbrance banned by
most revue producers; and because it
contains an abundance of honest spon-
taneous fun. The authors start with
the advantage, if it be an advantage,
that the principal characters are already
familiar to the audience through the
medium of Captain BAIRNSFATHER's
popular drawings; but they have not
been content with reproducing their
well-known, now almost hackneyed,
adventures, but have added many others
which are new and yet “come into the
picture.”
Their greatest piece of luck was in
finding a comedian exactly fitted to
fill the part of the humble hero. Mr.
ARTHUR BourchIER as Old Bill is
absolutely “it.” His make-up is per-
fect; he might have stepped out of the
drawing, or sat for it, whichever you
please. But, much more than that, he
seems to have exactly realised the sort
of man Old Bill probably is in real life
—slow-speaking and stolid in manner,
yet with a vein of common - sense
underlying his apparent stupidity;
much addicted to beer and other liquids,
but not brutalized thereby; and, while
often grousing and grumbling, never-
theless possessed almost unconsciously
of a strong sense of duty and an un-
daunted determination to see it through.
It is a tribute to the essential truthful-
ness of Captain BAIRNSFATHER's con-
ception and Mr. BourcHIER's acting
that one comes away from The Better
'Ole feeling that there must be thou-
sands of Old Bills at the Front fighting
for our freedom.
Admirable work is done, too, by
Mr. ToM WoottwelI as Bert, the in-
corrigible amorist, for whom each new
girl is “the only girl,” and who has
an apparently inexhaustible supply of
identity-discs to leave with them as
“sooveneers ”; and by Mr. SINCLAIR
CoTTER as Alf, the cynical humourist
—“Where were you eddicated, Eton
or Harrod's?” is one of his best mots
—who spends most of his time in wrest-
ling with an automatic cigar-lighter. I
think it would be only poetical justice
if in the concluding scene, when Old
Bill comes into his own, the authors
were for once to allow Alf to succeed
in lighting his “fag.”
Of the many ladies who add charm
to the entertainment I can only men-
tion Miss EDMEE DoRMEUIL, who as
Victoire has an important share in the
plot and saves Old Bill's life; Miss
GooDIE REEve, who sings some capital
songs; and Miss PEGGY DoRAN, who
looks bewitching as an officer of the
Woman Workers' Corps. The music,
arranged by Mr. HERMAN DAREwsRI, is
catchy and not uncomfortably original:
and the scenery, designed by Captain
BAIRNsfATHER, gives one, I should say,
as good an idea of the trenches as
one can get without going there. In
fine I would parody Old Bill and say,
“If you knows of a better show, go
to it !”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

ple of a peer who, having notoriously
no public services at his back, must be
presumed to have purchased his title,
Bank Holiday and the first fine day he would have created some effect.
after a week's downpour, Members for
the most part stayed away from West-
minster. Some, it is charitably sup-
posed, have gone to look after their
allotments. Others, it is believed, have
been kept away by a different reason.
The taxicab-drivers, men constitution-
ally averse from extortion, have refused
to enter the railway-station yards so
long as the companies persist in exact-
ing from them a whole penny for the
privilege. Consequently some of our
week-ending legislators are reported to
be interned at Waterloo and Padding-
ton, sitting disconsolately upon their
portmanteaux. As an appeal to the
Board of Trade elicited nothing more
from Mr. G. Roberts than a disclaimer
of personal responsibility, it is expected
that redress will be sought from the
Taxi-cabinet.
Mr. HENDERSON's dual personality
continues to arouse curiosity. There
was some justification for Mr. KING's
inquiry whether he went to Petrograd
as a Ministerial Jekyll or a Labourist
Mr. BonAR LAw assured the
Hyde.
House that on this occasion at least
Mr. HENDERSON went purely as a Cabi-
net Minister, guiltless of any duplicity.
Mr. PROTHERo enlivened the discus-
sion on the Corn Production Bill by
a new clause providing that where a
farmer failed to destroy the rabbits on
his land the Board of Agriculture should
have power to do it for him and recover
the expenses incurred. Sir John SPEAR
expected that in some cases the rabbits
secured would more than defray the
cost of the capture, and declared that
unless the farmer was allowed to keep
the rabbits the Government
would be guilty of “profiteer-
ing.” As other agricultural
Members appeared to share
this view, Mr. PROTHERo, most
obliging of Ministers, agreed
to alter the word “cost " to
“net cost.” I hope no litigious
farmer will seek to evade his
liabilities on the ground that,
as the Act only says “net cost,”
he need not pay for the ferrets.
Tuesday, August 7th.-Those
peers who were supposed to be
shaking in their shoes at the
thought of Lord SELBorne's
impending revelations as to the
means by which they acquired
their honours might have
spared their tremors. He
opened his bag to-day, but no
cat jumped out, not even the
smallest kitten. If he had

he hypothetically accused of buying
their coronets responded to his appeal
by standing forth in a white sheet and
making open confession of his crime.
Lord SELBoRNE was one of three
heirs to peerages who a generation ago
banded themselves together to resist
elevation to the House of Lords.
Another of them is Lord CURzoN, who
answered him to-night, and whose con-
tempt for the Chamber which he now

adorns seems to have grown with the
years that he has spent in it. Reading
between the lines of his speech a cynic
could only infer that the Upper House,
as at present constituted, is such a
useless and superfluous assembly that
it does not much matter who gets into
it or by what venal ladder he climbs.
The only peers who ventured to get
to close quarters with the scandal were
Lord KNUTSFORD, who told a moving
tale of how a potential baronet diverted
£25,000 from the London Hospital to
a certain party fund, and thereby
achieved his purpose; and Lord SALIs-
BURY, who declared from his knowledge
of Prime Ministers that they were
sick of administering the system of
which Lord CURzoN was so ostenta-
tiously ignorant.
Many reasons have been assigned
for Mr. CHURCHILL's reinclusion in the
Ministry, but I am inclined to think
that the real one has only just been
discovered. Mr. MACCALLUM Scott is
one of the most pertinacious inquisitors
of the Treasury Bench; he is also a
whole-souled admirer of the Member
for DUNDEE, and has written a book
in eulogy of his achievements by sea
and land. Mr. CHURCHILL has rewarded
this devotion by appointing Mr. Scott
his private secretary, and, as it is con-
trary to Parliamentary etiquette for a
Member holding this position to interro-
gate other Ministers, has thereby con-
ferred a distinct benefit upon his new
colleagues. Mr. LLOYD GEORGE is now
reported to be on the look-out for other
statesmen in whom Mr. Hogg E and
Mr. PRINGLE repose a similar trust,
but so far without success; and it is
thought that his only chance is to
make Mr. PRINGLE an Under-Secretary
on condition that he takes Mr. Hogg E.
as his dime damnée, or vice
versé.
Wednesday, August 8th.-
Lord BURNHAM shocked some
of the more ancient peers by
his skittish references to the
coming Conference on the
Second Chamber. When he
expressed the hope that Lord
CURzoN would make an ex-
plicit statement, on the ground
that their Lordships' House
was in no need of a soporific,
I fully expected one of the oc-
cupants of the mausoleum to
rise and reprove him in the
words of Dr. JohNsoN, “Sir,
in order to be facetious it is
not necessary to be indecent.”
The advent of the feminine
lawyer was rendered a little
nearer when her champions
successfully held up a Bill pro-
moted by the Incorporated Law

cornered contests was saved in a free
division by a single vote; and it was
further decided that “ P.R.” itself
should be adopted at University elec.
tions, despite the unanimous opposition
of the University Representatives.
“Well, it's a courtesy title,” I said,
“but really in these hard times we have
reduced economy. to such a fine art
that I thought a wall-paper with body
in it might help matters.”
“I think I catch the idea,” said the
marquis. “Something that would
make you feel more satisfied after
dinner than you otherwise would feel,
as it were.”
“My dear Sir,” I said, “you have
hit it exactly. Yours is a sympathetic
nature. How readily you have divined
my thoughts! No doubt you too are
suffering.”
He sighed almost audibly. “How
is the room furnished 2" he said.
“Leading features,” I said, “a Welsh

Many other patterns were shown us
and we spent an hour or two looking
at them. Our host tried hard to push
the cockatoos on to us. His idea was
that the pattern would act as wall-
paper and pictures combined. Alison's
idea was that there would be too many
portraits of cockatoos round the room,
and I maintained that the wretched
birds looked so realistic that I should
certainly feel I ought to be giving them
some food, and this would of course
hardly assist my idea. The noes had it.
In the end we came away with four
patterns (fruits and flowers) and a
promise to let Lord Bayswater know
which one we preferred. One of them
I chose really to show my tailor, as

THE CHOICE.
THE bright August sun
certainly made the dining-
room paper look dingy. It
was a plain, self-coloured
paper, but we were rather
attached to it, and didn't
like the idea of a change.
But there seemed no help
for it, so I arranged to leave
my office early on Friday
afternoon, meet Alison at
the Marble Arch tube station
and go with her to choose a
new paper.
When we reached the wall-
paperer's lair we were ushered
by an immaculate personage
into a room that looked more
like the dining-room of a pri-
vate house than a part of
business premises.

First dangerous Mule (to second ditto). “DoN'T You Go NEAR
HER, MATE–SHE'LL KICK YER."
Alison and I spent the
evening hanging the patterns
up one after the other on one
wall of the dining-room, and
tried to paper the rest of the
walls in the mind's eye, but
at eleven o'clock we knocked
off for the night and went
to bed with headaches.
I fancy Alison must have
had a disturbed night. As
I was leaving the house after
breakfast she said, “Have
you made up your mind
about those patterns?”
“No, I haven't,” I said.
“I’m going to leave it to
you. Choose which you like.”
“I’ve chosen,” she said
with an air of finality.
“Well,” said Alison, when
I reached home that evening,
“it’s up.”
“Perhaps,” I said, in an awed
whisper, “you don't care to have any-
thing to do with such trifling things as
—er—wall-paper?”
“Indeed we do,” said the nobleman. . .
“Most important things, wall-papers.
Where did you want it for?”
“For a room in my house, of course,” | . . .
I said. “Not for the garden.”
“Oh, not for the garden. And what
sort of house is yours?” he asked.
“A very nice house,” I said.
“I meant what was the style of the
house—Jacobean, Georgian 2"
“Brixtonian rococo outwardly,” I
said, “as far as I can judge; but very
snug inside. No doubt you could show
us something we should like which
would also satisfy your sense of pro-
priety.”
“I think it might be managed,” he
said, waving his hand towards two or
three giant books of patterns.
“What we want,” I said, “is some-
thing meaty.”
“Ah, for the dining-room,” he said.
“Saxe-blue carpet,” said Alison.
“A most important detail,” Lord
Bayswater said. “Don’t you think
something of a chintzy nature would

Both Alison and I agreed that a
prescription of that kind might possibly

I don't know what is comprised
under the term chintzy, but it appeared
to be a comprehensive one, for the
nobleman descanted on the merits of
the following patterns among others:—
(1) Cockatoos on trees, cockatooing.
(2) Pheasants on trees, eating black-
berries.
(3) Other birds on trees, doing no-
thing in particular.
(4) Roses, in full bloom, half bloom,
fading, falling.
(5) Forget-me-nots in bunches, ready
for sale.
(6) Grapes doing whatever it is that
grapes do.
(7) Other flowers and fruits, also
acting after the manner of their kind.

“Come and see,” Alison said.

THE REVIEWS FOR -
(A specimen article for the use of those
editors who have come to the realis-
ation that the contents of our heavier
periodicals never change. All that is
needed is the insertion of the right
month and the survey can be used as
a serial.)
IN The Umteenth Century and For-
ever, which is, as usual, alert and
interesting, the place of honour is
given to an article by Sir Vincent
Stodge, M.P., on “Proportional Repre-
sentation in New Patagonia.” Sir
Vincent's argument may or may not
convince, but it is succinctly stated.
Sir ERNEST CASSEL writes usefully on
“Economy for Cottagers,” and Lord
Sopwith, in a paper on “Air Raids and
Glowworms,” shows how important
it is that on dark nights there should
be some compulsory extinction of the
light of these dangerous and, he fears,
pro-German, insects. Mr. HARRY
DE WINDT describes “Galicia as I
Knew It,” and there are suggestive
papers on “The Probable Course of
History for the next Three Centuries,”
by the Dean of LINCOLN; “Potatoes as
Food,” by Sir WALTER RALEIGH; and
“Hair in Relation to Eminence,” by
Dr. SALEEBY, in which all the strong
men in history famous for their locks,
from SAMson to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
are passed in review. An excellent
number, full of mental nutriment, is
brought to a close by a symposium of
Bishops on the petrol restrictions.
By a strange coincidence The Short-
sightly also has a valuable paper on
“Proportional Representation,” by Mr.
and Mrs. C. N. WILLIAMSON, who thus
make their bow for the first time among
what might be called our thinking
novelists, their effort being in some
degree balanced by an essay in the
same number from so inveterate a poli-
tician as Mr. J. M. Hogg E., M.P., on
the “Wit and Humour of WILLIAM LE
QUEUX.” There is also an anonymous
article of great power on “Conscientious
Objectors as Food for Racehorses,”
which should cause discussion, both
by reason of its arguments and also
through the secret of its authorship,
which to the initiated is only of course
a secret de Polichinelle. For the rest
we content ourselves with drawing
attention to “The Small Holding,” by
Lord PIRRIE ; “Women and Tobacco,”
by the Manager of the Piccadilly Hotel;
“Feud Control,” by Mr. PHILIP S.Now-
DEN, M.P.; “Russia as I knew it,” by
Mr. HARRY DE WINDT; and “The Spirit
of Ireland,” by Sir John Power.
\ The Peremptory Review opens with
Lord CURzoN's well-reasoned appeal to
Labour to relinquish its attitude of
criticism and trust the powers that be.
Other notable articles deal with the
possible effect of woman's franchise on
the cult of Pekinese spaniels, the case
pro and con. for a tunnel under St.
George's Channel, and the philosophy
of E. PHILLIPs OPPENHEIM. Mr. HARRY
DE WINDT writes of “Serbia as I Knew
It.” A spirited attack on the MINISTER
of MUNITIONs by the Editor of The
Morning Post brings an excellent num-
ber to a close.
Backwood's is, as usual, strong in the
martial element, and is further proof
that in the present conflict there is no ex-
cluding rivalry between pen and sword,
but plenty of room for both. The arti-
cle wittily entitled “Mess-up-otamia."
should be read by everyone who is not
tired of that theme. The trenchant
author of “Reflections without Ran-
cour” displays his customary vigilance
as a censor of bétes noires, not sparing
the whip even when some of the animals
are dead.
In the ever iconoclastic and live
Gnashing All Review Mr. Smacksy is,
as usual, at his most vigorous. Among
the statesmen who come in for his
attacks are Mr. Asquith and Lord
HALDANE, both of whom are probably
by now quite inured to his blows.
Nothing could be more amusing than
the renewed play which is made with
the phrase, “spiritual home." Mr.
Smacksy has also something to say to
members of what might be called his
own Party. Other articles deal with
“The Psychology of the Pacifist,”
a trenchant exposure; “The Teeth of
American Presidents,” which contains
a number of curious statistics; “The
Film and the Future,” by Viscount
CHAPLIN; “The Honours List,” in which
the anonymous writer makes the re-
volutionary suggestion that the KING's
birthday should in future be marked
by the withdrawal of old titles instead
of the conferring of new. Mr. HARRY
DE WINDT describes “Roumania as I
Knew It "; “A Suggestion for the
Settlement of the Irish Problem " is
offered by Mr. GINNELL, M.P.; and
Mr. C. B. CochRAN utters a disin-
terested plea for “The Small Theatre.”
The Jinglish Iteview, also famous
for the activity of its fighting editor,
has no fewer than four articles from
his pen, of which the least negligible
is perhaps that of “The Partition of
Europe after the War.” The others
deal with “The Real Germany,”
“Sunday Journalism as a World
Asset,” and “HoRATIO Botto MLEY
the Prophet.” Other contributions in
a varied number include a series of
votive verses to Mr. Edward MARSH,
C.B., by a band of Georgian poets, on
the occasion of his resumption of his
duties as private secretary to Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL. A charming
study of leprosy, translated from the
Russian of Lugubriski, brings the
number to a close.
LONDON PRIDE.
UPON a lily-laden tide,
Where galleons rocked with sails blown
wide
And white swans gleamed, there was
a city
Whose citizens called “London Pride”
The flower that some call “None-so-
Pretty.”
It grew beside the frowning tower,
By RALEGH’s walk and Boley N's
bower,
As frail as joy, as sweet as pity;
And “London Pride” they called that
flower
Which country folk call “None-so-
Pretty.”
When London lads made holiday
In dewy hours o' th' month o' May,
And footed it with Moll and Kitty,
Among the maypole garlands gay
Be sure they plaited “None-so-
Pretty.”
When London lads in battle bent
Their bows beside the bows of Kent
('Tis told in many a gallant ditty)
Their caps were tufted as they went
With “London Pride” or “None-so-
Pretty.”
Oh, London is what London was,
And mighty food for pride she has :
Her saints are wise, her sinners witty,
And Picard clay and Flemish grass
Are sweet with stars of “None-so-
Pretty.”
“Sammies.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DUELLING EXTRAORDINARY.
THE contemplated single-stick -en-
counter between Colonel ARCHER-SHEE
and Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING recalls to
mind a ludicrous affair which actually
happened some years ago in a foreign
city which I will here call Killemalivo.
Mr. Alec McTavish, a Briton many
years resident in that fair capital and
editor of the only English newspaper,
had taken up stout verbal cudgels on
behalf of the Americans, who had been
viciously attacked in the columns of a
local “daily.” The United States of
the North, in its capacity of “special”
to the entire American continent, comes
in for plenty of abuse when a new re-
volution is about to be perpetrated.
The strife had waxed fast and furious
and eventually had taken on a personal
tone, the editor of La Muera accusing
the editor of the English paper of being
“that lowest of all living things—a
Texam.” It will be remembered that
in times gone by the State of Texas
decided to desert its Latin parents and
roost under the shadow of the eagle's
wing, thereby earning for itself pros-
perity and an evil reputation—in certain
quarters.
McTavish's editorial reply was a gem
of satire and displayed an intimate
knowledge of the antecedents of the
rival editor.
At that time duelling was still preva-
lent, and it was not many days before
the editorial sanctum of The Tribune
was honoured by the visit of two officers
in full-dress uniform.
The eventual outcome of their visit
was that Mr. McTavish found himself
pledged to fight a duel with a man who
was, among other things, a first-class
pistol shot and exceptionally expert
with the “florette,” all of which
McTavish was not.
The affair looked particularly un-
pleasant—to McTavish, who was short,
fat, and by no means young. But
the dignity of the foreign population
as represented by the editor of The
Killemalivo Tribune must of necessity
be upheld.
Faced by this quite unusual difficulty,
McTavish bethought him of his old and
tried friend, General O'Flynnone, an
Irish-American of many years' residence
in the Latin Americas. No one seemed
to know his real name, and the title of
General had come to him from his last
place.
The General was delighted at the
turn of events, agreed to be McTavish's
second, and promised to get him through
the affair with a whole skin and no loss
of honour.
As the challenged party McTavish
had choice of weapons, which was the
crux of the situation, as the General
pointed out.
Among the Killemalivo aristocracy
the favourite weapons were the duel-
ling pistol and the “florette,” or rapier.
The “pelado,” or lower orders, preferred
the “lingua de vaca,” which means
literally “cow's tongue,” a nasty-look-
ing knife of no mean proportions.
As O'Flynnone explained, the duel
would have to be fought with “killing
weapons”; nothing else would satisfy
the bloodthirsty editor. Meanwhile he
would think on the matter, and he
advised McTavish to do likewise.
The following were the most un-
pleasant days of his life, as McTavish
confessed afterwards. He was not a
“conscientious objector,” but he had
no pressing wish to exterminate his
opponent, as that would have necessi-
tated a sudden and forcible exile from
the land of his adoption; still less did
he fancy an early demise in the interests
of his paper.
Meanwhile the General visited the
rival editor's seconds and arranged for
a meeting in his own rooms to discuss
final conditions.
O'Flynnone's rooms contained, among
other things, a collection of curious and
ancient weapons. The walls were de-
corated with all sorts and conditions of
strange and barbarous instruments of
slaughter; Zulu assegais, Afghan knives
and Burmese swords hung in savage
array.
The meeting took place on the follow-
ing Sunday afternoon. The officers
greeted the General agreeably enough,
but saluted McTavish with the stiffness
that the occasion called for.
“Well, Señores,” commenced the
General, after depositing his visitors in
the most comfortable chairs, “to busi-
ness. Mr. McTavish, as you will admit,
has the choice of weapons.”
The officers nodded assent.
“This gentleman,” continued O'Flyn-
none, “comes of that most noble and
warlike race—the Scotch. Fiercest of
fighters, although they do not some-
times look it, the warriors of Scotland
alone among all nations withstood the
ravages of the conquering English. I
feel sorry, very sorry for the 'caballero'
whom you have the honour to repre-
sent.”
The pause which followed was most
impressive. The General's air was sug-
gestive of dire things, as with dramatic
suddenness he produced from beneath
the sideboard two enormous double-
edged battle-axes, which careful polish-
ing had made to shine as new.
“These,” said he, “are the weapons
which Mr. McTavish has chosen—
weapons of men, such as they use in his
own country,” he continued, brandish-
ing one of them savagely. “And the
fight will be on barebacked horses, for
such is the custom of the Scotch.”
The duel did not occur.
THE GAME OF HIS LIFE.
I MET the mercurial Gosling at the
club a few days ago. As I hadn't seen
him for some time I asked if he had
been on a holiday. “Yes,” he said,
“down at Shinglestrand. Golfing? No
—yes. I did play one game, the first
since the War, and rather a remarkable
game it was. I'm a member of the golf-
club there, and was down at the club-
house one morning looking at the papers
when a fat middle-aged man, about my
age, asked me if I cared for a game. I
didn't, but in a spirit of self-sacrifice
said that I should be very glad. ‘I
think I ought to tell you,' he went on,
‘that I don't care about playing with a
18-handicap man, and that I always
like to have a sovereign on the match.'
Now I never was much of a player—
too erratic, I suppose. My handicap
has gone up from 12 to 18, and the
last time I played it was about 24.
But, exasperated by his swank, I sud-
denly found myself saying, “My handi-
cap is 12.’ “Very well,” replied the
fat man, “I’ll give you 4 strokes.’
We went out to the first tee, and
after he had made a moderate shot
I hit the drive of my life. My second
landed on the green and I ran down
a long putt—this for a 4-bogey hole.
I'm not going to bore you with details.
I won the second and third holes, and
then the fat man went to pieces. I
never wanted any of my strokes and
downed him by 5 and 3. As we re-
entered the club-house my partner, who
had become strangely silent, walked up
to the board which gives the list of
handicaps and looked at them. There
was my name with 18 opposite it. ‘I
thought you said your handicap was
12, he observed. ‘Well,” I answered, “it
wasn't more than that this morning.’
The fat man was very angry. He said
he would report me to the committee,
and he did. But the secretary (who
happens to be my brother) played up
nobly. He communicated with the
secretary of the fat man's club, whom
he happened to know, and, having found
out that the fat man's handicap was not
6 but 12, he wrote to him to say that in
view of the fact that ‘the lies had been
equally bad on both sides' the commit-
tee did not propose to take any action.
The fat man got no change out of my
brother and I kept my sovereign.”

IN No Man's Land (HopDER AND SToUGHToN) is revealed
a breadth of vision which may astonish some of us who
have been inclined to regard SAPPER as merely a talented
story-teller. Among the writers on the War. I place him
first, for the simple reason that I like him best; and I am
not at all sure that I should like him any better if he cured
himself of his cardinal fault. With his tongue in his cheek
he dashes away from his story to give us either a long or
short digression; no more confirmed digressionist ever put
pen to paper, and the wonderful thing is that these wanton
excursions are worth following. True he often apologises
for them, but I do not think that we need take these apologies
seriously. This book is divided into four parts, “The Way
to the Land,” “The Land,” “Seed Time,” and “Harvest,”
and in “Seed Time,” at any rate, we have a series of chapters
which require not only to be read but to be thought over.

Tree,” or for pathos, as in “Morphia,” he obtains his effects
without the smallest appearance of effort. And I reserve
a special word of praise for “My Lady of the Jasmine,”
and commend it to the notice of those pessimists who
hold that only the French and the Americans can write a
good short story. Thank the powers that be for SAPPER.
The Loom of Youth (GRANT RICHARDs) is yet another
school story, but with a difference, the difference being,
partly at least, that it is written by one who has so lately
ceased to belong himself to the life described that his
account must carry an authority altogether unusual. Here,
one feels, is that strange and so-soon-forgotten country
revealed for us from within, and by a native denizen. For
this alone Mr. ALEC WAUGH's book merits the epithet
remarkable; indeed, considered as the work of “a lad of
sympathy for Berlin based on nothing better than a super-
ficial resemblance between the histories of Piedmont and
Prussia, and a record of nominal alliance with powers whose
respect for paper treaties was always fairly apparent. All
the same, in reading Mr. W. KAY WALLACE's essay in
recent history, Greater Italy (CoNSTABLE), a volume which
I cannot too strongly commend for its admirable way of
telling these and similar things, I am struck most of all by
the super-incumbent mass of Germanism that had to be
burst asunder before the true Italy broke free. The story
of that liberation is romance of an amazing order, for in it
one sees the very soul of a great and ancient people
struggling to renewal of life. It is more than good to
have such an ally, it is an inspiration.
If you wish to complete your knowledge of the working
seventeen,” its vitality, discre-
tion and general maturity of
tone seem little short of amaz-
ing. Realism is the note of it.
The modern schoolboy, as Mr.
WAUGH paints him, employs,
for example, a vocabulary whose
frequency and freedom may
possibly startle the parental
reader. Apart from this one
might call the book an indict-
ment of hero-worship, as hero-
ism is understood in a society

AGATE. The author is one of
that bright band of Mancunians
which The Manchester Guardian
has attached to its august
fringes. He writes of the busi-
ness in hand, the vagaries of
stores and indents and mere
men and brass hats, on this and
the other side of the Channel,
all with a very light and en-
gaging pen, and then spreads
himself on any old far-off thing
that interests him, such as the
theatre, perhaps a little self-
consciously and with a pleasant
air of swagger most forgivable
|and, indeed, enjoyable. His
chief preoccupation is with art
and letters, it is clear; but,
turning from them to the hand-
ling of urgent things and diffi-
| cult men, he faces the business
manfully. Of the men in parti-
º he has illuminating things
to say, redounding to their
credit and, by implication, to
his. To those who appreciate
perience will result in work of the highest quality.
Quite a host of moral reflections, none of them very
original, flock to one's mind in considering by what devious
ways our Italian allies came to range themselves on the
side of that freedom which they have always loved as well
and bravely as any of the rest of us. For instance—a very
stale reflection—one sees Germany overdoing her own
cleverness and under-rating that of her neighbours—this
more especially in her arrogant dominance of Italy's com-
merce; further, one notices the Hun's Belgian brutalities
costing him dear in a quarter least expected; and again one
realises Italy's decision as a thing mainly dependent, in
spite of all Germany's taking little ways, on a righteous
hatred of Austria—a consideration which brings one sur-
prisingly near to gratitude towards the big-bully Govern-
ment of Vienna. Our southern ally's loyalty to her
beautiful “unredeemed" provinces, and her claim, which
all right-minded Englishmen (I include myself) most heartily
endorse, to dominate the historically Italian waters of the
Adriatic, happily proved too strong for a machine-made
form in penwork this book may be safely recommended.

[AUGUST 22, 1917.
|DYLLS OF THE KING OF PRUssia.
A FRAGMENT.
So spake Sir GERARD (U.S.A.) and ceased.
Then answered WILLIAM, talking through his hat:
“When first the heathen rose against our realm,
That haunt of peace where all day long occurred
The cooing of innumerable doves, -
I hailed my knighthood where I sat in hall
At high Potsdam the Palace, and they came;
And all the rafters rang with rousing Hochs.
So to my feet they drew and kissed my boots
And laid their maily fists in mine and sware
To reverence their Kaiser as their God
And vice versd; to uphold the Faith
Approved by me as Champion of the Church;
To ride abroad redressing Belgium's wrongs;
To honour treaties like a virgin's troth;
To serve as model in the nations' eyes
Of strength with sweetness wed; to hack their way
Without superfluous violence; to spare
The best cathedrals lest my heart should bleed,
Nor butcher babes and women, or at least
No more than needful—in a word, behave
Like Prussian officers, the flower of men.
I bade them take ensample from their Lord
Of perfect manners, wearing on their helms
The bouquet of a blameless Junkerhood,
And be a law of culture to themselves,
Though other laws, not made in Germany,
Should perish, being scrapped. For so I deemed
That this our Order of the Table Round
Should mould its Christian pattern on the spheres,
Itself unchanged amid a world new-made,
And men should say, in that fair after-time,
‘The old Order sticketh, yielding place to none.’”
So he. Whereat that other held his peace,
Seeming, for courtesy, to yield assent.
But, as within the lists at Camelot
Some temporary knight mislays his seat
And falls, and, falling, lets his morion loose,
And lights upon his head, and all the spot
Swells like a pumpkin, and he hides the bulge
Beneath his gauntlet lest it cause remark
And curious comment—so behind his hand
Sir GERARD's cheek, that had his tongue inside,
Swelled like a pumpkin . . . .
THE STOCKING OF PRIVATE PARKs.
As I came out on to the convalescents' verandah my
brother James looked up from his paper.
“Did I ever tell you about a certain Private Parks?” he
asked. “He was with me in Flanders in the early days.
He came out with a draft and lasted about two months.
Rather a curious type. Very superstitious. If a shell
narrowly missed him he must have a small piece to put
in his pocket. If while standing on a duck-board he hap-
pened to be immune while his pals were being knocked out
he would carry it about with him all day if possible. On
one occasion he was very nearly shot for insubordination,
because he would go out into No-man's-land after a flower
which he thought would help him.
“Not that his superstition was purely selfish. Once,
when he had had two particularly close shaves during the
day, he insisted upon sleeping outside the barn where we
were billeted. ‘I’m absolutely certain to have a third close
shave,' he said, ‘and if I'm in the billet someone will get it.'
“The Corporal let him lie down in the farmyard, but a
little later he crept up the road about fifty yards to make
things more certain.”
“And I suppose the barn was hit and he escaped 2 " I put
in, feeling that I had heard this story before.
“You don't know Private Parks,” said James. “About
two o'clock in the morning a shell fell on the road not
ten yards from him. Bits of it must have made a pattern
all round him, but not one hit him, and when he'd picked
himself out of the ditch he went back to the billet, knowing
all was then safe.
“Then one day when we were in the front line there came
up with the mail a parcel for Private Parks. I was near
when he opened it. When he saw the contents he gave a
sigh and a curious resigned expression came over his face.
“‘What's she sent you?' I asked.
“It's from my old aunt, Sir,’ he said. “It’s a stocking.’
‘Only one?’ ‘Yes,’ he said with great solemnity. “The
other one's been pinched 2' I asked. ‘No, Sir. The parcel's
not been opened. It simply means that I shall lose a leg
to-day,’ he added. He wasn't panicked at all. But, as to
reassuring him, I might as well have argued with a tank.
“We'd had a very quiet time, but that evening the Hun
put over a pretty stiff bombardment. We stood to, but we
all thought it was only a little extra evening hate, except
Private Parks. He kept saying, ‘They're coming across,’
till we told him not to get the wind up.' But he hadn't got
the wind up. Only he knew they were coming.
“And they did come. Just after it was dark they made
a biggish raid and got into our front trench a little to our
right. We started bombing inwards, but the slope of the
ground was awkward, and they seemed to be having the
best of the fun.
“Then Parks jumped up on to the parapet with a pail
of bombs and ran along. He fairly got among them, and
by the time he was hit in the right leg they were mostly
casualties or prisoners. I saw him on the stretcher going
back. He was in some pain, but he smiled, and said, “One
stocking will be enough now, Sir.’”
“Very extraordinary,” I began, but James stopped me,
“I haven't finished,” he said. “When about three months
later I went down to Southmouth Convalescent Camp,
almost the first man I saw was Private Parks. He was
still on crutches, but he had two legs. I greeted him, and
then I couldn't resist saying, ‘What about the stocking?'
“‘I'll tell you, Sir,’ he said. “For a week after I was
wounded it was a toss up whether they took the leg off
or not. Then a parcel arrived for me. It was the other
stocking. My aunt had discovered that she had left it
out. That evening the surgeon decided that they need not
amputate. I knew they wouldn't, of course, as soon as I
received the parcel.’” -
James had really finished this time, and after a moment's
reflection I said, “I wonder if that's true.”
“Do you flatter me?” he asked.
“I don't know about that. Not with intent,” I said,
“though it would really be more to your credit if you'd
made it up.” -
“As a matter of fact,” said James, “I did make it up.
It was suggested to me by the heading to a letter in this
paper— The Stocking of Private Parks,' though that
appears to be upon quite a different subject. Something
agricultural, I gather.”
“By a comparison of the wet and dry bulb registrations the dew
point and the humility of the atmosphere is determined.” -
Banbury Guardian.
In the first week of August, at any rate, the atmosphere
had no reason to swank.

WHY, You'RE Twice,
A LETTER FROM NEW YORK.
DEAR ,-We got here safely,
with the usual submarine scares en
route, but apparently no real danger.
Wessels going westward from England
are not much the U-boats' concern,
nor are the U's, I guess, particularly
.keen on wasting torpedoes on passenger
ships. What they want to sink is the
goods.
Anyway, we got here safely. It is
all very wonderful and novel, and the
interest in the War is unmistakable;
but what I want to tell you about is
an experience that I have had in the
house of one of the leading picture
collectors here—and the art treasures
of America are gradually but surely
becoming terrific. If some measure is
not passed to prevent export, England
will soon have nothing left, except in
the public galleries. Of course, for a
while, America can't be so rich as if
she had not come into the War, but she
will be richer than we can ever be for
a good many years, while the steel
people who make the implements of
destruction at Bethlehem will be richest
of all. What my man makes I cannot
say, but he is a king of sorts, even if
not actually a Bethlehem boss, and the
Medici are not in it ! I have intro-
ductions to all the most famous col-
lectors, but, hearing of his splendours,
I went to him first.
Well, I sent on my credentials, and
was invited to call and inspect the
Plutocrat's walls. You never saw any-
thing like them And he refers to his
collection only as a “modest nucleus.”
He has agents all over the world to
discover when the possessors of certain
unique works are nearing the rocks.
Then he offers to buy. As his wealth
is unlimited, and sooner or later all the
nobility and gentry of England, France,
Italy and Russia will be in Queer Street,
his collection cannot but grow and
become more and more amazing. He
even had the cheek to send the Trustees
of the National Gallery a blank cheque
asking them to fill it up as they wished
whenever they were ready to part
with TITIAN’s “Bacchus and Ariadne.”
Though he calls himself a patriot,
directly the War is done he will make
overtures to Germany. There is a
Wermeer in Berlin on which he has
set his heart, and another in Dresden.
I could fill reams in telling you what
he has. But I confine myself to one
picture only, which he keeps in a
room by itself. I am not so foolish as
to pretend to know anything, but to
my eyes this picture was nothing
whatever but the Louvre's “Monna
Lisa.”
That being of course impossible,
“What a wonderful copy!” I said.
“You may indeed say so,” replied
my host.
I looked at it more closely, even
applying a pocket magnifying-glass.
“There was not a contemporary
duplicate?” I inquired. “Could LEo-
NARDO have painted two 2"
The Chowder King, or whatever he is
called, smiled inscrutably. “No doubt
he could,” he said. “But perhaps,” he
continued, “you have not seen the
Louvre picture since it was put back
after the theft 2"
“Not to examine it closely,” I re-
plied.
He laughed softly and led the way
to the door.
Now what I want to know is, is it
possible that 2 -
This terrible thought has been haunt-
ing me day and night.
I have asked many Americans to tell
me about this collector and his methods,
but I can get no exact information.
But it seems to be agreed that he
would stick at nothing to get a coveted
work beneath his roof. If I have
many more such shocks as he gave me
I shall give up paint altogether and
specialise in photography or the three-
colour process.
Anyway, it is God's own country, and
I will tell you my further adventures
as I have them. To-morrow I am to
attend a reception at the White House
to hear ELLA WHEELER WILcox recite
an Ode at the PRESIDENT.
Yours,
X. Y. Z.

HYMN FOR HIGH PLACES.
IN darkened days of strife and fear,
When far from home and hold,
I do essay my soul to cheer
As did wise men of old ;
When folk do go in doleful guise
And are for life afraid,
I to the hills will lift mine eyes
From whence doth come mine
aid.
I shall my soul a temple make
Where hills stand up on high ;
Thither my sadness shall I take
And comfort there descry;

This message doth extend—
That evil men must render count
And evil days must end.
For, sooth, it is a kingly sight
To see God's mountain tall
That vanquisheth each lesser height
As great hearts vanquish small;
Stand up, stand up, ye holy hills,
As saints and seraphs do,
That ye may bear these present ills
And lead men safely through.
Let high and low repair and go
To where great hills endure;
Let strong and weak be there to
seek
Their comfort and their cure;
And for all hills in fair array
Now thanks and blessings give,
And, bearing healthful hearts away,
Home go and stoutly live.

[*The Town Clerk of Colwyn Bay informs
us that the fish caught there the other day by
two youths was a dogfish and not a shark, as
reported, and that its size was much over-
estimated.”—Manchester Guardian.]
O GALLANT youths of Colwyn Bay,
With what unmitigated rapture
Did I peruse but yesterday
The story of your famous capture!
Alone ye did it, or at least
'Twas next to being single-handed;
No other helped to catch the beast,
No strength but yours the monster
landed. -
But now comes in the cold Town
Clerk,
Who has meticulously stated
It was a dogfish—not a shark—
In size much overestimated.
So ye intrepid striplings, who -
Made all your school-fellows feel
humble,
Are mulcted of your honours due
By an officious Cambrian Bumble.
But, though your generous hearts be
Sore,
Take comfort: all the true patri-
Clans
Of intellect have been at war
With frigid, rigid statisticians.
I too have suffered from the rule
Of sceptics, icily pedantic,
Who blighted, ere I went to school,
My dreams when they were most
romantic.
For once, when swinging on a gate,
With hands that doubtless daubed
it jammily,
I saw a lion, sure as fate,
And fled indoors to tell the family.
But when I told them, all agog,
My aunt, a lean and acid spinster,
Snapped out “the doctor's yellow

All, all have had their fame aspersed
By rude Town Clerks or senior
wranglers;
But those who have been treated
worst
Are the heroic tribe of anglers.
THE NEW. GOLF.
“LET's go and play the new golf,”
said James. -
Now as I understand it there are
four kinds of golf. First, the ordinary
golf, as played by all people who are
not quite right in their heads; second,
the ideal golf, to be played by me (but
not till I get to heaven) on a bowling-
green with a croquet-mallet, the holes
being sixty-six feet apart and both
cutting-in and going-through strictly
prohibited; third, the absurd golf, as
played by James in pre-war days on
his private nine-hole course; and fourth,
it seemed, the new golf, such as James
would be liable to create during a re-
covery from shell-shock.
James is one of those people who,
possessing what Country Life would
call one of the lesser country-houses of
England, has an indeterminate bit of
ground beyond the garden, called, ac-
cording to choice of costume, “the rock-
garden,” “the home-farm,” “the grouse
moor,” or “no rubbish may be shot
here.” James calls his own particular
nettle-bed (or slag heap) “the golf-
course.”
When anyone went to stay with
James, he was adjured to “bring-your-
golf-clubs-old-man-as-I-can-give-you-a-
bit-of-a-game-on-my-own-course-only-
a-nine-hole-one-you-understand.” And
when James went—far more willingly
—to stay opposite the Germans, until
an interesting visit was short-circuited
by shell-shock, he showed himself so
wonderfully at home in dug-outs and
shell-holes and mine-craters, so com-
pletely undisturbed by the weariful lack
of any green on the course over which
his battalion was playing, that he rose
from Second-Lieutenant to Lieutenant
with almost unheard-of celerity in the
space of two years and nine months.
And now the absurd figure-of-eight
nine-hole course, the third hole of which
was also the seventh, and the first the
ninth, had been complicated into a war
kitchen-garden, and James, bored with
ordinary difficulties and discomforts,
had evolved the new golf.
“Come on,” said he, burning with
the zeal of a martyr - burner, “I’ll
show you the ground.”
“Can't I see it by standing up
hammock?” I protested.
We approached the dark demesne,
which was now pretty decently clothed
with potatoes, artichokes, rhubarb, rasp-
in the
berry-canes, marrows and even &ucum-
ber-frames. In the midst was a large
open cask which filled itself by a pipe
from a former six-inch water-hazard.
Here James began to propound the
mysteries.
“The game,” he said, “is a mixture
of the old golf, tiddleywinks, ludo and
the race game.”
“Not spillikins?” I protested. “A
game I rather fancy myself at.”
“For your information, please,” con-
tinued James in his kindliest military
manner, “I may remark that a mashie
is the club mostly used—except when
it is necessary to keep low between,
say, two clumps of potatoes.”
“So as not to rouse the wireworms,”
I nodded. “Yes—go on.” -
“The conditions of the game are
governed by the necessity of paying
due respect. to the vegetable hazards.
There is only one hole on the course.”
“If you remember,” I said, “I told
you long ago that that was all there
was room for, but you would persist in
making it nine.”
“The hole,” said James, “is the
water-butt. You have to get into that.
By the way, your balls are floaters, I
hope?”
“Only six of 'em,” I said. “How-
ever, I dare say you won't mind if I
grub up a few potatoes to carry on
with afterwards. So we hole out in the
water-butt 2 That's the tiddleywinks
part of it, I suppose? Go on.”
“There are various penalties,” he
explained. “If you get among the
potatoes, you add ten to your strokes
and start again at the tee. If you are
bunkered in the raspberries, you lift
out y -
“Step back three paces out of sight
and pick one over your left shoulder?”
I inquired hopefully. “I shall often
find myself in the raspberry hazard.”
“And if,” concluded James sternly,
“you are so clumsy as not to avoid the
cucumber-frames 1 *
“Say no more,” I begged. “I under-
stand. I shall ask for the time-table,
shake hands, thank you for a most de-
lightful visit, and express my regrets
that any little contretemps should have
arisen to hasten my departure.”
“—you add fifty to your strokes.
Five for the marrows and the rhubarb
—in each case returning to the tee."
“And the artichokes,” I asked, sur-
veying a thick forest of them guarding
the right flank of the water-butt—
“what is their market value?”
“No penalty,” said James grimly,
“except staying there till you get out." |
“One last piece of information.
What is bogey for this hole?”
“About two hundred, I think,” said
James; “but no doubt you'll lower it.”

CoME, let me tell the oft-told tale again
Of that strange Tyneside grenadier we had,
Whom none could quell or decently constrain,
For he was turbulent and sometimes bad,
Yet, stout of heart, he dearly loved to fight,
And spoke his fellows on a gusty night
In some high barn, where, huddled in the straw,
They watched the cheap wicks gutter on the
shelf, -
How he was irked with discipline and law,
And would fare forth to battle by himself,
| This said, he left them and returned no more ;
But whispers passed from Vimy to Verdun,
Where'er the fields ran thickliest with gore,
Of some stray bomber that belonged to none,
But none more fierce or flung a fairer bomb,
Who ran unscathed the gamut of the Somme
And followed Freyberg up the Beaucourt mile
With uncouth cries and streaming muddy hair;
But after, when they sought his name and style
And would have honoured him—he was not there.
But most he loved to lie upon Lorette
And, couched on cornflowers, gaze across the lines
At Vimy's heights—we had not Vimy yet—
Pale Souchez's bones and Lens among the mines,
w
\
The tall pit-towers and dusky heaps of slag,
Until, like eagles on the mountain-crag
By strangers stirred, with hoarse indignant shrieks
Gunners emerged from some deep-delvéd lair
To chase the intruder from their sacred peaks
And cast him down to Ablain St. Nazaire.
And rumour said he roamed the rearward ways
In quiet seasons when no battle brewed;
The transport, homing through the evening haze,
Had seen and carried him, and given him food;
And he would leave them at Bethune canteen
Or some hot drinking-house at Noeux-les-Mines,
Where he would sit with wine and eggs and bread
- Till the swart minions of the A.P.M.
Stole in and called for him, but found him fled
Out at the back. He was too much for them.
Too much. And surely thou shalt e'er be so;
No hungry discipline shall starve thy soul;
Shalt freely foot it where the poppies blow,
Shalt fight unfettered when the cannon roll,
And haply, Wanderer, when the hosts go home,
Thou only still in Aveluy shalt roam,
Haunting the crumbled windmill at Gavrelle
And fling thy bombs across the silent lea,
Drink with shy peasants at St. Catherine's Well
And in the dusk go home with them to tea. H
A. P. H.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 13th.-In a certain
political club there used, before the
War, to be a popular pick-me-up com-
pounded of a little whisky, a little
Angostura and a good deal of soda-
water, and known after its inventor as
“a Henderson.” In one respect the
speech explaining his resignation which
the right hon. Member for Barnard
Castle delivered this afternoon resem-
bled this eponymous beverage, for it
was decidedly effervescent. But the
other-ingredients were wrongly appor-
tioned—too much of the bitters and not
enough of the mellowing spirit.
His initial mistake was not realising
in time that, as Mr. Asquith put it,
a man cannot permanently divide him-
self into watertight compartments. As
member of the War Cabinet and Secre-
tary of the Labour Party, he seems to
have resembled one of those twin salad-
bottles from which oil and vinegar can
be dispensed alternately but not to-
gether. The attempt to combine the
two functions could only end, as it
began, in a double fiasco.
It is fortunate for the Ministry of
Munitions that it possesses a spokes-
man so bland and imperturbable as Sir
WoRTHINGTON Evans. In successive
answers he informed the House that
near Birmingham the Ministry was
evicting 130 allotment holders on the
eve of their harvest, in order to build
a new factory; and that simultaneously
it was abandoning in the West of
England the site of another gigantic
factory, on which a cool million had
already been spent. Coming from
almost any other Minister this amaz-
ing example of how not to do it would
have raised a storm of supplemental
inquiries, if not a motion for the
adjournment. But the House accepted
Sir Worth INGTON's calm and matter-
of-fact narration as quietly as if it were
the last word in efficiency and co-
ordination.
I was a little premature last week in
assuming that Mr. MAcCALLUM Scott
had been silenced by his appointment
as Mr. CHURCHILL's private secretary.
A long question to the Board of Trade,
on the subject of horse-hides, followed
by a series of supplementaries delivered
with his customary emphasis, showed
that he is not yet resigned to his
muzzle. He is not, however, entirely
oblivious of the customary etiquette in
this matter, for he recited his catechism
from the third bench behind Ministers,
and only when it was over descended
to the second bench, where private
secretaries most do congregate.
Tuesday, August 14th.-Mr. KING
has a legitimate grievance against the
Government spokesmen. Two Nation-
alist Members having been allowed to
go to the United States to collect funds
for their party, he asked yesterday
whether he too would be permitted to
proceed abroad on a similar mission.
Mr. BonAR LAw, with his habitual
courtesy, replied that he, personally,
would not offer any objection. But
this afternoon, on putting an almost
identical question to Lord Robert
CECIL., Mr. KING was informed, with a
touch of brusquerie, that “there are some
people to whom we should not think of
granting a passport.” He cannot re-
concile these replies, which seem to him
to afford convincing proof that the
Government does not know its own
mind.

to cater for the spiritual needs of the

new population at Gretna, has simul-
taneously provided sites for the Church
of Scotland, the Church of England, the
Roman Catholics and the Congrega-
tionalists. The local blacksmith is said
to be aggrieved by all this ecclesiastical
rivalry.
The Home SECRETARY has deter-
mined to put a stop to the practice of
whistling for taxicabs in London. It
is suggested that he would confer a
still greater boon on his fellow-towns-
men if he would provide a few more
taxis for them not to whistle for.
Mr. PETo complained once more of
the refusal of the War Office to employ
“manipulative surgeons" in the Army,
and called in aid the testimony of
Mr. Hodge, the Minister of Labour, as
a proof of Mr. BARKER's miraculous
powers. Sir WATsoN CHEYNE, the
newest Member of the House, pointed
out that unfortunately all bone-setters
were not BARKERs; and, fortified by
this expert opinion, Mr. MACPHERSoN
declined to say more than that private
soldiers might go to these unconven-
tional practitioners at their own risk.
Wednesday, August 15th. —Taking
the view that a Corn Production Bill
was intended to produce corn, Lord
CHAPLIN made an effort to secure that
the bounties should be paid in accord-
ance with the crops harvested and
not upon the acreage sown. But the
Government, unwilling to risk a quarrel
with the other House at this late period
of the Sesson, declined to accept the
amendment. The bounties therefore
will fall, like the rain, upon good and
bad land alike, though in the interests
of the general taxpayer I trust not
quite so heavily.
To take down the Ladies' Grille, Sir
ALFRED Mond informed the House,
would only cost a matter of five pounds.
All the same I think there was some
disappointment in certain quarters, in-
cluding the gilded cage itself, that this
momentous question should be disposed
of without debate. Several sparkling
orations, teeming with wit and persi-
flage, were nipped in the bud. A score
of ungallant fellows, including several
whom I should have diagnosed as
ladies' men, opposed the removal, but
they were outnumbered eight to one.
Mr. WALTER LoNG introduced a Bill
to enable the Government to prospect
for oil in the United Kingdom. If this
should necessitate the appointment of
a Controller of Bores he will find abund-
ance of work.
Contrary to expectation Mr. CHUR-
CHILL succeeded in piloting the Muni-
tions of War Bill through its remaining
stages in double-quick time. Its pro-
gress was facilitated by his willingness
to abolish the leaving-certificate, which
a workman hitherto had to procure
before changing one job for another.
Having had unequalled experience in
this respect he is convinced that the
leaving-certificate is a useless formality.
Thursday, August 16.—Owing to the
House meeting at noon the usual time-
limit for Questions did not apply.
Messrs. PRINGLE and Hogge were
especially active. With a meaning
glance in their direction the Hoxie
SECRETARY, replying to a complaint of
Mr. GULLAND that the representation
of the Northern Kingdom would not
be increased by the Representation of
the People Bill, observed that he saw
no sufficient reason for extending the
number of Scottish Members.
Food-stocks going up, thanks to the
energy of the farmers and the economy
of consumers; German submarines
going down, thanks to the Navy;

ling for peace—that was the gist of the
message with which the PRIME MINISTER
sped the parting Commons. But, fearing
perhaps that he might have made them
unduly optimistic, he concluded with a
warning that not until next year could
we expect to reap the fruits of our
labours.
An attempt by Messrs. MAcDoNALD
and S.Now DEN to keep the Stockholm

of those elegant doctrinaires to speak
for British Labour, and Mr. BonAR LAW

POLITICAL PICK-ME-UPS.
RECENT revelations as to the way
in which our leading Statesmen keep
themselves fit have been almost entirely
concerned with their physical recrea-
tions. Further investigations make it
clear that they owe their fitness quite
as much to diet, to alternating one
form of brain-work with another or to
the consolations of music.
Thus Mr. BALFour, who has little
time for golf nowadays, finds his most
refreshing recreation in reading the
speeches of Lord NorthCLIFFE, co-ordi-
nating them with those of BURKE and
PERICLES, and setting them to music
in the style of HANDEL, his favourite
composer.
Lord RHONDDA finds his chief solace
in gratifying his literary tastes. In
philosophy he is at present a convinced
Rationalist. He is devoted to the
study of BACON, but not averse from
the lighter sort of fiction, having a
special preference for cheerful stories
published in a cereal form.
The PRIME MINISTER, it may not be
generally known, recruits his energies
by frequent perusal of the plays of
SHAKSPEARE. At present he is con-
ducting a correspondence with Sir
SIDNEY LEE and Professor GoLLANCz
on the esoteric significance of Labour's
Love's Lost.
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL is a vora-
cious novel-reader of catholic tastes.
Just now he is revelling in Called Back
and The House on the Marsh, which
are being read aloud to him by his
private secretary.
Mr. ARTHUR Ponsonby, M.P., the
Democratic Controller, is a confirmed
fruitarian, and attributes his robust
health to a diet of Morella cherries and
Carlsbad plums, washed down with
Stockholm tar-water.
Mr. John BURNs, who happily de-
scribes himself as “a dormant volcano,”
has of late found an agreeable stimu-
lant in the performance of solos on the
muted first violin. -
Lastly, Mr. LEO MAXSE keeps him-
self keyed up to concert pitch by coin-
ing new nicknames for Lord HALDANE.
The list already extends to four figures.
“Khartum has the reputation of being a
very hot place this time of year. But last
June must have been fairly damp if the
meteorological statistics published by the
‘Sudan Times' are correct. The rainfall
during this month amounted to no less than
33.6 kilometres. No wonder a man I know
there wrote to say the other day that some-
times the rain is too heavy for him to go on
sleeping on the roof, and this in spite of a
waterproof sheet. A life-belt would probably
be more useful.”—Egyptian Mail.
Only NoAH's Ark would really meet
the case.

possessed a great gift of cunning. He
had had several passages of arms with
the C.S.M. of “A” Company and had
emerged unscathed more than once.
On the occasion of this story Brown
was being tried for using abusive
language to a superior officer, to wit,
the said C.S.M. The abusive language
consisted of one very striking epithet.
The charge was read over to Brown,
and the C.S.M. was called upon to
give evidence. He stepped smartly
forward. Matilda loitered between his
legs . . . and then, I regret to say, the
C.S.M. applied the same epithet to
Matilda that Brown had applied to him.
The case was reluctantly dismissed,
and Matilda is out of favour with the
C.S.M.

“What! Give up the thing which lends to breakfast its
one and only distinction ? Never.”
“That,” she said, “sounds very brave; but what are you
going to do if there isn't any marmalade to be obtained for
love or money?”
“Mine,” I said, “has always been the sort you get for
money. I have not hitherto met the amatory variety; but
if it's really marmalade I'm prepared to have a go at it.”
“And that,” she said, “is very kind of you, but it's
quite useless. For the moment there's no marmadale of
any kind to be had.”

MR. PUNCH'S “SPORPOT.”
Two Summers ago Mr. Punch gave an account of the
Sporpot (or Spaerpot, meaning a savings box), a familiar
institution which our little guests from Belgium brought
over with them to England. The idea was taken up by
certain schools in South Africa, and a competition was
started to see which of them could fill the biggest Sporpot
to make a fund for helping to restore the homes of Belgian
exiles. This year the Eunice High School for Girls at
Bloemfontein comes out first, and the second honours fall
to the St. Andrew's Preparatory School for Boys at Gra-
hamstown. The total sum of thirty-two pounds collected
by the competing schools has been forwarded to and re-
ceived by the author of the Punch article and will be used
by him for the purpose desired.
Mr. Punch begs to offer his congratulations to the
winners and his best thanks to all who have contributed so
generously from their personal savings to the needs of the
children of our Ally.

WHISPER, AND I SHALL HEAR.
THERE's nothing like a newspaper
for spreading disease. You wake up in
the morning, feeling fit to do a day's
digging on your allotment; you come
down to your breakfast singing a
Rhonddalay and eat more than your
allowance. Then you open the news-
paper, glance at the latest accession to
the ranks of the Allied Powers, and
suddenly, “Plop!” you find there is a
new disease raging, and before you know
where you are you discover that you
have got it badly.
That is how I discovered that I was
the possessor of a heart mur- -
mur. By putting my hand on
the spot under which I had
been taught, and still believed,
my heart to be, I felt rather
than heard a distinct burbling.
I went to the telephone and
fixed up an appointment with
a specialist.
“It's only a murmur now,”
I said when I reached the con-
sulting-room, “only a mere
whisper, but * >

minded I said, “Come in,”
the first time. -
“You were rejected for this,
I suppose?” he said.
“No, cow-hocked or spaw-
ined, I forget which,” I said.
“This hadn't started then.”
The rite was quite a lengthy
one, and at the conclusion the
heartsmith said, “M – yes,
there is a slight murmuring,
certainly.”
He wrote me out a prescrip-
tion, and I felt the murmur
myself distinctly when parting
with three of the greater Brad-
burys and three shillings.
On the way home I ran into
Beatrice.
“Well, old thing,” she said, “what's
the matter 2 I saw you coming out of
Dr. Cox's.”
“Yes," I said. “I’ve got a heart mur-
mur. I don't know what the poor thing's
been trying to say, but it's been mur-
muring like anything all the morning.”
“Perhaps you're in love,” she sug-
gested.
“By Jove, I never thought of that.
I wonder,” I said, “if it's anything to
do with you. If this were not such a
public place you might like to put your
head against my top left-hand waist-
coat pocket and listen. Perhaps it's
saying something about you.”
“Have you taken to writing poetry
about me?” she said. “That's always
a sign.”

“Now I come to think of it,” I said,
“I did feel a bit broody the other day,
and hatched a line or two, but I can't
say for certain that I had you in my
mind. The lines ran like this:—
“Oh, glorious female, like a goddess decked,
No wonder that we crawl on bended knee—”
“Rotten,” said Beatrice. “You
couldn't have been thinking of me.
I'm not a female.”
“You have the right plumage for the
hen-bird,” I said. “However, what did
me was ‘decked.' I could only think
of three rhymes, ‘wrecked,’ ‘flecked'
and 'stiff-necked.' You're not any of
those by any chance?”

“Do you think I ought to ?” she said.
“Good heavens ! Of course you

My heart's only murmuring now, but
it may start shouting soon, and a silly
ass I shall look walking about in the
street with a heart yelling “Beatrice'

As regards meat and drink I consider
that Beatrice overdid it for a war-
time lunch. She didn't give me any
time to hold her hand, she was so busy.
“It's curious,” I said, as I watched
the amount of food that was going her
way, “but my heart seems to have
stopped murmuring altogether.”
“Has it?” she said. “Oddly enough,
mine's begun.”
“Your luncheon has overstrained

morning.

CIGARISTICS.
[“According to an enterprising
| American scientist a man's char-
acter can be told from the way he
smokes a cigar.”—Weekly Paper.]
For instance, a man who
snatches a cigar from some-
body else's mouth and smokes
it himself may be assumed to
be of a grasping disposition.
The man who while smoking
a cigar burns his finger is a
man of few words and quick
of action. Plumbers never
burn their fingers like that.
The man who smokes his
cigar right through without
removing it from his mouth is
a deep thinker. Lord North-
CLIFFE always smokes one
_l cigar right through before
deciding what England really wants,
and two when he has to decide which
Cabinet Minister must go.
The man who accepts a cigar from a
friend, lights it, sniffs and drops it be-
hind his chair has no character worth
mentioning. -

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Safety Candle (CASSELL) might have been called, but
for the fact that the title has been used already, A Comedy
of Age. For this is what it is—only perhaps less a comedy
than a tragedy. Agnes Tempest was called the Safety
Candle, for the ingenious reason that, though attractive,
she burnt nobody's wings. Returning as a middle-aging
widow, after an unhappy wifehood in Africa, she meets on
the boat two persons, Captain Brangwyn, a young man,
and a girl-mother calling herself Antonina Pisa. Hence
the tears. Brangwyn she marries, doubtfully, half-defiantly,
despite the difference in years between them; Antonina is
taken as a companion and very soon developes into a
sick-nurse. For in the space between the ship-board
engagement and the wedding a railway accident changes
poor Agnes from a still beautiful and active woman to a
nerve-ridden invalid. But in spite of this she and
Brangwyn marry; and (with the much too attractive
Antonina always in evidence) you can guess the result.
One odd point; you will hardly get any distance into
Miss E. S. STEvens' exceedingly well-written story without
being struck by its resemblance to one of Mr. HICHENs'
romances. The relative positions of the members of the
triangle, middle-aged wife, young husband, and girl are
exactly those of The Call of the Blood; while the Sicilian
setting is identical. But this of course is by no means to
accuse Miss STEVENs of plagiarism; her development of
the situation, and especially the tragedy that resolves it, is
both original and convincing. The end indeed took me
wholly unawares, since as a hardened novel-reader I had
naturally been expecting—but read it, and see if you also are
not startled by a refreshing departure from the conventional.
If there still linger in the remoter parts of Cromarty or
the Balls Pond Road certain unsophisticated persons who
believe that the stage is one long glad symposium of
wine, woman and song they will be interested to know that
Mr. KEBLE HowARD has written his latest novel, The Gay Life
(John LANE), with the express object—or so he says—of dis.
illusioning them. He has no use for the cynic who declared
that there are three sexes, men, women and actors. His
Thespians are gay because they are happy, and happy because
(though poor) they are virtuous. The crowning ambition
of their lives of honest toil is not unlimited silk-stockings
and champagne suppers, but the combined and unqualified
approval of Mr. GRANVILLE BARRER and Miss HoRNIMAN.
I fear the Philistines will not be much impressed with
Mr. KEBLE HowARD's championship. In the first place
he selects for his heroine a girl of what used to be known
as the “lower orders.” Yet it is more than doubtful if the
lower orders have ever done anything for Mr. KEBLE HowARD
except open his cab-doors and bring his washing home on
Saturday night. Otherwise he would not make his East
End of London heroine talk an argot of which fifty
per cent. is pure East Side Noo York. True, “the curtain"
finds her in New York in the arms of a faithful and acrobatic
American, so perhaps it doesn't matter much. Meanwhile
she has become the idol of the Manchester School, en-
joyed an unsuccessful season in partnership with the late
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE, and signed a contract with

with which she won the hearts of her first employers. It
is courageous of Mr. HowARD to place on record his
apparent belief that a total absence of the three “R’s” and
any number of “h's” cannot debar a strong-minded daughter
of the slums from the higher rungs of the histrionic ladder.
When a warm-hearted and law-abiding gentleman, who
has kept open-house for many guests, suddenly discovers
that these guests have plotted against him, have read his
private correspondence, have caused explosions in his
garden, have attacked his neighbours from the vantage-
ground of his house, and altogether have behaved as if he
didn't exist, he is not unlikely to be both shocked and
angry, and to denounce to the world the crew of traitors
and assassins who have im- T T
posed on his kindness and
hospitality. This is what hap-
pened to Uncle Sam at the ,
hands of the German conspi-
rators for whom he had un-
consciously provided a base of
operations. A full account of
the doings of this poisonous
gang is given in The German
Spy in America (HUTCHINSON),
by John PRICE Jones, a mem-
ber of the staff of the New
York Sun. It is not easy for
anyone, least of all for a good
American, to refrain from in-
dignation at the baseness of
the rogues who thus battened
for many months on the
United States and their peo-
ple. The book is soberly and 3
clearly written, and is com- ?
mended by Mr. RoosevelT

added another Foreword by
the Author, and an Intro-
duction by Mr. Roger B.

tant-Attorney in New York.

ochial events follow upon his arrival. The scene shifts to
Naples, and we meet a villaful of men and women, all of
them admirably original and human. Not for a great while
have I read a story so unforced and appealing. It is
indeed a sad thought that this graceful pen will give us
nothing more of its quality.
When you hear the title or see the cover of The Heel of
the Hun (HopDER AND STOUGHTON) your blood may begin
to curdle and your flesh to creep. Be assured. When I
think of some of the war-books vouchsafed to us Mr. J. P.
WHITAKER's is almost tame, and I venture to say that it
might be read out loud at a party of sock-knitters without a
stitch being dropped. Mr. WHITAKER was in Roubaix and,
presumably because he was believed to be an American, was
allowed considerable freedom. So, before he escaped into
"AIR - RESTORER IS TO THE BALD
Holland, he saw some things
which were not for British
eyes, and he tells us about
them with a staidness alto-
gether unusual in this kind
of book. Although he forgets
to mention the fact, his articles
have already appeared in The
Times, and I can see no parti-
cular reason why they should
have been gathered together in
this brief volume. Anyhow,
I must believe that the Hun's
heel fell less heavily on Mr.
WHITAKER than upon most
people who have had the mis-
fortune to be introduced to it.
An author who can choose
so fascinating a title as The
| Way of the Air (HEINEMANN)
certainly has much in his
favour, and this not only
because of the more or less
temporary connection between
aeronautics and victory, but
because just lately we have
all been talking large and
free about peace-time develop-
ments of the craft in the near
future. Personally I have
already arranged to take my
"EAD
Ma'am (HUTCHINsoN), the edge of it would have been
turned by the statement upon the fly-leaf that the author,
M. BERESFORD RYLEY, died while the novel was still in
manuscript, and that it has been revised for the press by
her friend, Mr. E. W. LUCAs. As things are, having before
me only the pleasant task of praise, I am the more sorry
that I cannot increase that pleasure by telling the writer
how much I have enjoyed a wholly admirable story. She
had above everything the rare art of writing about homely
and familiar matters unboringly. Ma'am (a not too happy
title) begins in a dull parish, where its heroine is the newly-
wedded wife of the curate. You will have read no more
than the opening pages (descriptive of the terrible Sunday
evening supper which the pair took at the Vicarage—a
supper of cold meat and a ground-rice mould, whereat four
jaded and parish-worn persons lacerated one another's
nerves) before you will have realised gratefully that the
story and its characters are going to be alive with a
very refreshing and unpuppetlike vitality. Eventually, of
course, more happens than Vicarage suppers. An old lover
of Griselda (Mrs. Curate) turns up, and many most unpar-
wife's mother for a short week-end in the Holy Land
in the Spring of 1920; and a forty-eight hours' mail service
to Bombay is an event of to-morrow. Thus, if Mr. EDGAR
C. MIDDLETON's book fails to secure general appreciation,
he must place the blame elsewhere than with his subject,
and it is a fact that by some repetitions and contradictions,
as well as by a tendency to let one down at what should
be the critical point of his yarns, he has done something to
alienate a public—such as myself—entirely predisposed in
his favour. It remains to say, all the same, that this little
volume is in the main a sincere and obviously well-informed
account of the doings of the men of our air services, full of
incident and achievement utterly beyond belief an unbeliev-
ably short time ago. In the pages he devotes to prophecy
—an irresistible temptation—he is on controversial ground,
and his apparent preference for the “gas-bag” as the
principal craft of the future will certainly not find general
acceptance. Much more to my liking is his suggestion
that duck chasing and shooting from an aeroplane—it has
already been done at least once—may become a recognised
sport.

CALLING A CAB.
[“But how to get a cab without whistling
—that is the problem.”—Evening News.]
A very good plan is to purchase a
camp-stool and sit down in the Strand
until a taxicab breaks, down. When
you are sure that the driver is not
looking step inside.
Taxi-drivers are human, and if caught
young can be made so tame that they
will take fares by the hand.
An excellent plan is to make a noise
like a road under repair. But be care-
ful that the driver does not make a
noise like a cab going over a human
body.
The essential thing is to interest the
driver in your personal affairs. If you
see a car rushing along stand in the
road. When the cab pulls up, ask the
driver if he would like to see your
cigarette pictures.

[AUGUST 29, 1917.
e A HEAD CASE.
WE were discussing that much dis-
cussed question, whether it is better
to be wounded in the leg or in the
arm, when young Spilbury butted in.
“I don't know about legs and arms,”
he said, “but I know there are certain
advantages in having your head bound
up.” Spilbury's own head was bound
up, and we all said at once that of
course the head was much the worst
place in which to be wounded.
“It may be,” said Spilbury. “But
what I said was that there are certain
advantages in having your head bound
up. That's not quite the same thing
as being wounded in the head. For
instance, I wasn't wounded in the
head. I was wounded in the jaw. But
they can't bandage the jaw without
bandaging - the head, which I have
found has certain advantages.”
“I can't see where they come in,”
said Cotterell, “except so far as per-
sonal appearance goes, of course. I
won't say that that nun-like head-dress
doesn't become you. You look almost
handsome in it.”
“It is extremely polite of you to say
so,” said Spilbury, “but I was not
thinking of that. I was thinking of
Dulcie.”
There was silence for a space, and
then Cotterell said, “If you do not
mention her other name, you may tell
us about Dulcie.”
“I became acquainted with Dulcie,”
Spilbury began, “or the lady I will
call Dulcie—for that is not actually her
name—while we were quartered at a
camp somewhere in England. Friend-
ships ripen quickly in war-time. I was
signalling officer, and perhaps I sig-
nalled to Dulcie rather more than I
meant. I won't say I was wholly
blameless in the matter.”
“I shouldn't,” said I. -
“I won't,” said Spilbury. “After
I went out we corresponded. But after
a little I began to see I had perhaps
over-estimated my affection for Dulcie.
At the time I was wounded I had owed
her a letter for some time, I remember.
When I got back to England I did not
let Dulcie know at once, but after a
while she heard where I was in hospital
and came to see me. In the meantime
I had met Daphne.” -
“This is a highly discreditable story,”
said Cotterell. “I am sorry I allowed
you to tell it.” -
“I won't finish it, then,” said Spil-
bury complacently.
“Yes, you must finish it now.”
“Well, I didn't quite know what to
do about it. I had felt when we were
somewhere in England that Dulcie
brought out all that was best in me.
I found now that Daphne brought out
still more.”
“She must have been a clever girl,”
I said.
“She was,” said Spilbury, “but I
saw that if they both tried at once the
might bring out almost too much. }
had to act quickly, for Dulcie was
already by my bedside.”
“‘Well, Reggie,’” she said.
“I looked at her kindly but firmly.
“‘I think there is some mistake,' I
said. “I don't remember having met
you.' Then I pointed to my bandaged
head, and added, ‘I may have forgotten.
My memory isn't very good.’
“Well, she chatted a bit about general
subjects, and then departed. don't
mind saying I felt rather a worm. Also
I wasn't quite sure that Dulcie couldn't
bring out more that was good in me
than Daphne, after all. So I thought
about it a bit, and then wrote and said
I'd remembered her now, and would
she come again to see me? She wrote
back and said she would, and I must
congratulate her as she was just en-
gaged to be married. That was a rotten
day, I remember, because in the after-
noon Daphne came and said that she
was engaged to be married too. A per-
fect epidemic. But that's beside the
point.”
“The point was, if I remember
rightly,” said Cotterell, “that it's a
great advantage to have your head
bandaged. Have you quite proved it?”
“No,” said Spilbury thoughtfully.
“Now you mention it, I hardly think
I have. But if my story acts as an
example and a warning I shall be
satisfied.” -
So as an example and a warning
(though of what or to whom is not too
clear) I have recorded it.
MUSICAL MURMURINGS.
(By our Orchestral Erpert.)
THE full programme for the season
of Promenade Concerts which opened
last Saturday is, as usual, a most inter-
esting document, and we are of course
glad to see that our gallant Allies are
so well represented. But it is the
function of the critic to criticise, and
we may be permitted to express a mild
regret that our native school, though
by no means excluded, does not make
so good a show as its energy and talents
would seem to warrant. Our native
composers are especially noticeable for
their wide range of themes, for the Celtic
and Gaelic glamour which they infuse
into their treatment of them, and for
their realistic titles. We have drawn
up a list of instrumental works which
illustrate these characteristics, but
which are unfortunately conspicuous
by their absence from Sir HENRY
WooD's scheme. As, however, it is
subject to alteration we are not without
the hope that some of them may yet
be included in the list of works to be
heard at the Queen's Hall in the next
six weeks. -

Taking the air of a Sunday morn
Midst the red of poppies and gold of

Flowery ladies in gold brocades,
W.th negro pages and serving-maids,
In scarlet coach or in gilt sedan,
With brooch and buckle and flounce
and fan, -
Patch and powder and trailing scent,
Under the trees the ladies went—
Lovely ladies that gleamed and glowed,
As they took the air on the Ladies' Road.
Boom of thunder and lightning flash—
The torn earth rocks to the barrage
crash ; -
The bullets whine and the bullets sing
From the mad machine-guns chattering;
Black smoke rolling across the mud,
Trenches plastered with flesh and
blood– -
The blue ranks lock with the ranks of
gray,
Stab and stagger and sob and sway;
The living cringe from the shrapnel
bursts,
The dying moan of their burning thirsts,
Moan and die in the gulping slough—
Where are the butterfly ladies now 2

“BRAIN-FAG ! That's wot we 'orses
are suffering from. Ah! there's bin
a deal o' queer things 'appen since they
women started on the farm | Ishan't
never forget the first time one of them
females come into my stall. The roan
pony, wot's got sentimental thro' being

sez she was a pretty young woman. I
never noticed nothing 'bout 'er'cept the
pink rose in 'er button-'ole. I never
'eard tell of a farm 'and with a pink
rose in 'is shirt before. Maybe such
carryings on is all right for they grooms
an' kerridge-'orses, but it ain't 'ardly
decent for a respectable farm 'orse.
So when this 'ere woman come along
I up and 'as a grab at it. D'ye think

“Well, when we done all the kissing

bridle was over one eye and my girths
'anging loose. Maybe that was my
own fault; when she started to pull in
the straps 'course I blew meself out,
same as any 'orse would, just to give
'er something to pull on. “Oh dear!'
says the female. “Poor 'orse, this 'ere
girth's too tight!' Any'ow, when we
did get to the 'ayfield she 'ad to fetch
a man to put me into the rake. Well,
'e told her 'ow to go on, and we moves
orf. That wasn't 'arf a journey! Wot
with 'er pulling one way an' pulling
another, I got fair mazed. Arter a bit
I stopped. ‘’Ave it your own way

when Smith 'ad gone I seen one of the

'op with all me feet at once. Still she
don't say nothing, and I couldn't feel

SUAVITER IN MODO.
PROFound stillness reigned in the
wardroom of EI.M.S. Sinister, broken
only by the low tones of the Paymaster
and the First Lieutenant disputing over
the question of proportional representa-
tion and by the snores of the Junior
Watchkeeper, stretched inelegantly on
the sofa. The rest of the occupants
were in the coma induced by all-night
coaling. Into this haven of quiet burst
the ship's Doctor in a state of exagger-
ated despair. He groaned and, sinking
into a chair, mopped his forehead osten-
“What do you think of the ship?”
he asked cheerfully.
“Rotten slow lot,” replied the A.P.;
“I tried to make things hum a bit at
lunch and they all sat looking like
stuffed owls.”
“Ah, you'll find it different this
evening after the Commander has gone.
Bad form to tell smoking-room yarns
while he's here.”
. Meanwhile the First Lieutenant
visited the Commander in his cabin.
“Very well,” said the latter on part-
ing; “only mind, no unnecessary vio-
lence.”
when all the glasses had been filled,
“I call on Number One for a song.”
Amid vociferous applause the First
Lieutenant, clasping a huge tumbler of
ginger-beer, rose unsteadily. Without
the semblance of a note anywhere he
proceeded to bawl “A frog he would
a-wooing go.” A prima donna at the
zenith of her fame might have envied
his reception. The Junior Watchkeeper
broke half the glasses in the trans-
ports of his enthusiasm. “Come along,
Doc,” said the singer as soon as he
could make himself heard; “give us a

yarn.” With the assistance of his

ceased their discussion and
watched him intently as
though he were some per-
forming animal.
“Gentlemen,” said the
Paymaster presently in tones
of sepulchral gloom, “the
neophyte of AEsculapius,
to whose care the inscrut-
able wisdom of Providence
has entrusted our lives, is
being excruciatingly funny.
Number One says it is belated
remorse for the gallant ser-
vants of His Majesty whom
he has consigned to an un-
timely grave.”
“Poor jesting fool,” said
his victim, “little he knows
that even now Heaven has
prepared a punishment fitted
even to his crimes. I have
seen it—nay, I have spoken
with it.”
“Suppose,” intervened the
Commander, “that you post-
pone this contest of wits and
let us have your news.”
“Certainly, Sir,” acqui-
esced the Doctor. “It’s Pay's
new assistant. He's . . .”

one foot on his chair and the
other on the table. “Say,

“jolly litl’ yarn–Goblylocks
an' Three Bears.”
Overcome, apparently, by
tender recollections he was
silent, and fixed the walnuts
with a dreamy stare.
“Go on, Doc. l’’ “Goldi-

Doc,” said the Paymaster,
“was always a devil for the
girls.”
“Pay,” remonstrated the
First Lieutenant sorrowfully,
“that's the third half-penny
for swearing this year. You
mean that the Doctor has
always evinced a marked par-
tiality for the society of the
gentler sex.”
Punctuated at the more
exciting points with breath-
less exclamations of horror
and amazement from his
audience, the Doctor's ren-
dering of the story proved
an overwhelming success. As
he painted in vivid periods

him to have a drink. He called me
‘old socks.’” The Doctor shuddered.
“Then he said he expected this was
some mess; Naval messes were always
hot stuff. He wanted to spin me yarns
of his infant excesses, but I choked him
off by telling him he ought to report to
the skipper. You'll have to look after
him, Pay. That will give you some
honest work for a change.”
The Assistant Paymaster had no
cause to complain of lack of hilarity at
dinner. The most trivial remark was
greeted with roars of merriment. When
the KING's health had been drunk the
Commander pleaded letters and left
the ward-room. Instantly a perfect
babel arose. Everyone seemed to be
asking everyone else to have a drink.
The newcomer selected a large whisky.
“Wilkes,” said the First Lieutenant,
It must be confessed that at lunch “one large whisky, one dozen soda, one
the newcomer justified the Doctor's
worst forebodings. Afterwards the
First Lieutenant and the Paymaster had

tuneful West-Country folk-song at the
Doctor's request. The Junior Watch-
keeper, declaring his inability to re-
member anything, read half a column
from the “Situations Vacant" portion
of The Times, and amid the ensuing
applause slipped quietly from the room
in obedience to an unspoken signal
from the First Lieutenant. After the
Second Engineer had given an exhibition
of what he asserted to be an Eskimo
tribal dance, the First Lieutenant ad-
dressed the Assistant Paymaster.

A LETTER FROM THE FRONT
ON A PURELY DOMESTIC MATTER.
MY DEAR WIFE,--Yours to hand of
the 10th inst., and contents, re son,
noted. I observe that you are for the
moment satisfied with his progress, and
that you feel yourself in a position to be
able to see your way to inform me that
he is beginning to have and express
ideas of his own on all subjects. He
shows himself a fine fellow, and you
have every reason to be as happy as it
is possible to be in wartime.
By the same post arrived the new
uniform from Dover Street, London, W.
You will be glad to hear that Messrs.
Blenkinson have done us proud, manag-
ing to carry out your many suggestions
without departing from regulation.
They make a fine fellow of me, neat
but not gaudy, striking in appearance
without being offensive to the eye.
Once more they too have shown
themselves fine fellows. We are all
fine fellows; my dear, you are posi-
tively surrounded on all sides by fine
fellows, and it would look as if, given
peace, we are all together going to be
as happy as the day is long.
So I thought at first blush; but are we
so sure ? The separate ingredients are
excellent; there couldn't be a better
son than Robert or better tailors than
Messrs. Blenkinson. But how will they
blend? Mind you, I'm not daring to
doubt the courtesy and tact of a single
Blenkinson; but these views which son
Robert is beginning to form, where will
they lead him . . . and us . . . and the
Blenkinsons 2 Again, I'm not sug-
gesting that Robert will ever go to such
lengths in view-forming as to dare to
attack such an anciently and honourably
established firm as Messrs. Blenkinson;
indeed, I could almost wish it might
fall out that way, and that they and I
might continue, without intervention,
upon our present terms of mutual
esteem and entire satisfaction. If things
stand so well between us, while I am
but young, claiming no higher rank or
standing than that of Captain (Temp.),
how much more must we flourish
when I have risen to those heights to
which we know I am bound to reach
in my full maturity? Against such an
alliance even the youthful and vigorous
Robert would hurl himself and his
criticisms in vain. No, I foresee a
danger more subtle and formidable
than that.
Some of the very first views that
Robert forms will be on the subject of
clothes. His very desire to be perfectly
dressed will take him to Blenkinsons',
and, when he has spent two hours
trying on the very latest, his desire to
get me, at any rate, passably dressed
will induce him to say to Mr. Blenkinson,
senior: “I say, can't you do something
to stop the governor wearing clothes
like that 2 ”
Blenkinson, having long anticipated
and dreaded this, will at once hasten
round to the back with the tape-
measure; but Robert will Gatch him
when he comes round again and say,
“I shouldn't have believed that you
would ever consent to make such clothes
as he insists on wearing.”
Blenkinson perforce will smile that
deferential and conciliatory smile of
his, which seems to say: “We entirely
agree with you, Sir, but it isn't for us
to say so.”
Robert, blown out with conceit, upon
being tacitly corroborated by Blenkin-
sons in a matter of taste, will pur-
sue the subject mercilessly, until his
victim is forced into some definite
statement. Looking round to see that
he cannot possibly be overheard, Blen-
kinson, senior, will be led by his too
perfect courtesy to commit himself.
“Well, Sir,” he will murmur, “we have
on one or two occasions dared to hint
that his cut was rather out of date, and
would he permit us to alter it in some
small particulars? But Sir Reginald "
(or shall we make it “the General " ?)
“prefers, quite rightly, of course, to
decide these things for himself.”
“‘Quite rightly' be blowed,” Robert
will retort. “We know and he doesn't.
Can't you make him understand 2 You
can sometimes get him to be reasonable,
if you stick to him long enough.”
Blenkinson will be quite unable to
let his old and honoured customer go
entirely undefended or unexcused on so
grave an issue. “We fancy, Sir, that
the General” (or shall we say “His
Lordship” 2) “understands just as well
as we do, Sir, but . . .”
“But what?” Robert would exclaim,
a little exasperated to hear it suggested
in his presence that I understand any-
thing.
Mr. Blenkinson, senior, will rub his
chin, wondering very much whether he
is justified in allowing himself to go
so far as to hint at the truth in this
instance. “But—er—well, Sir,” will
be extracted from him at last, “we
gather—er—we gather, Sir–er'm—her
Ladyship insists.”
I see Robert's face clear and I hear
him say in quite a different tone, “Oh,
I'll soon manage mother for you.”
And off he trots home, and in a week
or less I have to adopt his ridicu-
lously ugly, obviously impracticable
and damnably uncomfortable fashions
—tight trousers and high collars, no
doubt.
Yes, that's where Robert, and you,
with your Robert, are leading me, con-
found you both. It will be as bad as
that ; confound you both.
“Don’t speak like that, even in
jest,” you'll say brazenly.
“But damme, Mary x -
“And I certainly will not have my
namecoupled with that sort of language,
please.”
I shall appeal to Robert to bear
evidence that I am the injured party,
and not you. Robert of course will
stand by you, and you, worthless woman
that you are, will sink your identity
and sacrifice your soul and stand by
TIGHT TROUSERS AND HIGH COLLARS.
And I shall get red in the face (and
at the back of the neck).
And in the end I shall have to make
good by taking you all out to the most
expensive dinner, theatre and supper
possible—very nice for you two, no
doubt, but what about me in those
infernal trousers and collars ?
It will right itself in the end, for I
cannot believe your reason will per-
manently forsake you, even for that
precious nut of a Robert. Eventually
we shall prefer, unanimously you and
I, to slink about the back streets, clothed
in our own ideas, rather than pro-
menade the fashionable parts clothed
in Robert's.
Do you say to yourself that that
supreme test, the sacrifice of Piccadilly,
Bond Street and the Park, is too much?
Don't cry, darling; it will never be as
bad as that. And why? Because,
according to that incredibly stupid
young man, Robert, Piccadilly, Bond
Street and the Park will then be the
back streets, in which no decent people,
except out-of-date, old-fashioned fogeys
like ourselves, would ever consent to be
seen. So it is really myself who is still
alone. Yours,
LOVELY WOMAN.
IF the casual gods send inquiring
strangers into my camp, let them (the
intruders) be civil, please, or at least
be male. Citizens I can at once wave
away with a regretful mescio vos : foot-

THERE is no truth in the rumour that
spectacular cricket is to be resumed.
It is perfectly true that a section of
the public who are devoted to watch-
ing the game and cannot understand
why, because the nations happen to be
at war, this favourite summer recre-
ation should be denied them, have
been agitating for the Government to
arrange with the War Office to release
all first-class cricketers now in the
Forces, so that they may be free to
play matches at home. It is also
true that the Government, having re-
fused to do this, subsequently, in view
of the arguments urged by a deputation
of cricket enthusiasts, agreed to do so,
since it has always set its face against
any pedantic rigidity of purpose. But
none the less no such matches will be
played, for the simple reason that the
cricketers themselves refuse to come
back until their job is finished.

THE BALLAD OF JONES's BLIGHTY.
THERE are some men who dwell for years
Within the battle's hem,
Almost impervious, it appears,
To shot or stratagem; - -
Some well-intentioned sprite contrives
| By hook or crook to save their lives
(It also keeps them from their wives),
And Jones was one of them.
The hugest bolts of Messrs. KRUPP
Hissed harmless through his hair;
The Bosch might blow his billet up,
But he would be elsewhere;
And if with soul-destroying thud
A monstrous Minnie hit the mud,
The thing was sure to be a dud
If only Jones was there.
Men envied him his scatheless skin,
But he deplored the fact,
And day by day, from sheer chagrin,
He did some dangerous act;
He slew innumerable Huns,
He captured towns, he captured guns;
His friends went home with Blighty
OneS,
But he remained intact.
We had a horse of antique shape,
Mild and of mellowed age,
And, after some unique escape,
Which made him mad with rage,
On this grave steed Jones rode away . . .
They bore him back at break of day,
And Jones is now with Mrs. J.-
The convalescent stage.
The world observed the chance was
droll
That sent so mild a hack
To smite the invulnerable soul
Whom WILLIAM could not whack;
But spiteful folk remarked, of course,
He must have used terrific force
Before he got that wretched horse
To throw him off its back.

Another Impending Apology.
“Many coolies of the savage tribes from the
hilly places, who have been enlisted for the
labour corps, were seen passing this town by
train lately. Some had too few clothes. Our
late Chief Secretary, the Hon’ble Mr. —,
was seen among them.”—Times of Assam.
“All can sympathise with Mr. — and his
teetotal party in deploring the excesses of
“liquor' of any description, and the vice,
want and misery it brings in its course. But
we cannot for a single moment listen to their
selfish and pitiful beatings, when we know
that if their methods were carried out through
the land it would people our beloved country
with a virile race of effete degenerates.”

AN IDEAL MEDICAL BOARD.
(A Dream of the Future.)
I was due to go in front of the local
Medical Board next morning, and I was
seeking distraction in the evening paper.
Suddenly my eye was caught by the
headlines announcing the transfer of
recruiting arrangements from the Mili-
tary to the Civil authorities. This
promised to be interesting.
All at once the room grew misty,
and when the atmosphere cleared again
I found myself in the open street.
Before me was a palatial building with
the words “Medical Board ” carved on
a marble slab over the main entrance.
I entered, and was immediately con-
fronted by a liveried janitor who bowed
obsequiously.
“I have come to be medically ex-
amined,” I explained.
“Yes, Sir," he replied. “Will you
be good enough to wait one moment,
Sir, while I settle with your taxi-driver,
and then I will take you to the waiting-
room, Sir.”
“I have no taxi," I said.
“I just
walked.”
*An expression of concern passed
across his face.
“Oh, you shouldn't have done that,
Sir. The Authorities don't like it.
There is a special fund for such ex-
penses, you know, Sir. Will you please
come this way, Sir?”
I followed him along the corridor,
and was shown into a luxurious apart-
ment overlooking a pleasant garden.
The janitor placed an easy chair in
position for me, handed me a copy of
Punch, and brought me a glass of wine
and some biscuits.
“Now, Sir, if you will give me your
papers I will send them up to the
Board.”
I handed the packet to him, and he
left the room.
A few minutes later a message-girl
entered.
“Are you Mr. Smith ?” she inquired.
I confessed that I was, upon which
she handed me a sealed envelope.
opened it, and found a letter and a
cheque for five pounds. The letter ran
as follows:—
“Sir, The above-named Medical
Board regrets its inability to examine
you to-day. As you are no doubt
| aware, it is contrary to its rule to
examine more than three persons in
one day, and an unusually difficult
case, held over from yesterday, has
upset all its arrangements.
“The Board would consider it a
favour if you could make it convenient
to call again to-morrow morning at
the same time.
“The enclosed cheque is intended to
compensate you for the unnecessary
trouble to which you have been put.
“Your obedient Servants --
Punctually at the time appointed I
again entered the building, and was
met by the same janitor.
“The Board is quite ready for you,
| Sir," he said. “Will you please ascend
to the dressing-room, Sir 2"
He committed me to the care of a
lift-girl, who conveyed me to the second
|storey. Here I was handed over to a
smart valet, who assisted me to un-
dress in a comfortable little apartment
replete with every convenience.
Having donned a warm dressing-
gown, I was conducted to the Board
Room, where I found a dozen of our

greatest Specialists assembled. The
President shook hands and greeted me
effusively. Then I passed in turn from
one Doctor to another, each making,
with the utmost delicacy and con-
sideration, a thorough examination of
that part of my anatomy on which he
was an acknowledged expert.
When this was over I was invited to
retire to the dressing-room and resume
my garments while the Board held a
protracted consultation on my case.
On returning to the Board Room I was
provided with a seat, and the President
addressed me.
“Well, Mr. Smith, we can find
nothing constitutionally wrong with
you. But tell me, have you ever had
any serious illness?”
I shook my head. I had always
been abnormally healthy.
“Think carefully,” he urged. “We
don't want to pass you as fit if we can
help it.”
He seemed so anxious that I felt
ashamed to disappoint him.
“Well,” I replied, “the only thing I
can call to mind is that, according to my
mother, I had a severe teething rash
when I was ten months old.”
As I uttered these words the faces of
all became suddenly grave.
“That is quite enough, Mr. Smith,”
said the President. “You are given
total exemption. You should never
have been brought here at all, but I
am sure you will realise that in times
of national emergency mistakes of this
nature are bound to occur. If you will
apply to the Cashier on your way out

pounds, to reimburse you in some small
way for the loss of your valuable time.

BALLAD or THE PotAto.
ABOVE three hundred years ago
To Britain's shores there came
An immigrant of lineage low—
Sol Tuberose his name.
He settled down in mean estate,
Despised on every side,
Until at last he waxéd great,
Grew rich and multiplied.
Now none so popular as he;
To every house he goes,
At every table he must be—
The great Sol Tuberose!
In time of war he proves his worth,
He helps us everywhere;
There's nothing on (or in) this earth
That can with him compare.
Not the great LLOYD could save the
land
Except for mighty Sol;
For he is Bread's twin-brother—and
He gives us Alcohol;
Not such as fills the toper's tum,
But such as fills the shell—
Such as will be in days to come
Heat, light, and pow'r as well.
Yes, in the spacious days to come
We'll bless Sol Tuberose,
When all our motor engines hum
On what the farmer grows.
Then cultivate him all you can,
With him and his stand well in ;
There's one that is a Nobleman,
There's one Sir John Llewellyn.
There's one that is a British Queen,
There's one a dwarf, Ashleaf,
There's one that is a plain Colleen,
There's one an Arran Chief.
He'll serve us if we do him well
(Last year he failed our foes).

Of good Sol Tuberose! W. B.

His three monumental volumes called
Pictures of Life and Character consti-
tute a truer history of the English
people in the middle of the last century
than any author could have composed:
history made gay with laughter, but
history none the less, And this leaves
out of account altogether the artist's
work as a cartoonist, where he often
exceeded the duty of the historian,
and not only recorded the course of
events but actually influenced it.
To influence the course of events
was however far from being this simple
gentleman's ambition. What he chiefly
wished was to enable others to share his
own enjoyment in the fun and foibles
of a world in which it is better to be
cheerful than sad, and, in the process
of passing on his amusement, to earn a
sufficient livelihood to enable him to pay
his way and now and then be free to
follow the hounds.
All these praises he would probably
wish unsaid, so modest and unassum--
ing was he. Let us therefore stop and
merely draw attention to the two pages
of his drawings which follow, each of
which shows JoHN LEECH in the light
of a prophet.

A BALLAD OF EELS.
[“Lord Desborough has just been reminding
us of the neglected source of food supply that
we have in the eels of our rivers and ponds.
He stated, “The food value of an eel is remark-
able. In food value one pound of eels is better
than a loin of beef. . . . The greatest eel-
breeding establishment in the world is at Co-
macchio, on the Adriatic. This eel nursery is
a gigantic swamp of 140 miles in circumference.
It has been in existence for centuries, and in
the sixteenth century it yielded an annual
revenue of £1,200 to the Pope.’”
Liverpool Daily Post.]
WHEN lowering clouds refuse to lift
And spread depression far and wide,
And when the need of strenuous thrift
Is loudly preached on every side,
What boundless gratitude one feels
To DESBoRough, inspiring chief,
For telling us: “One pound of eels
Is better than a loin of beef" |
Of old, Popes made eel-breeding pay
(At least Lord DESBOROUGH says
they did),
And cleared per annum in this way
Twelve hundred jingling, tingling
quid.
In fact my brain in anguish reels
To think we never took a leaf
Out of the book which taught that
eels
Are better than prime cuts of beef.
In youth, fastidiously inclined,
I own with shame that I eschewed,
Like most of my unthinking kind,
This luscious and nutritious food;
But now that DESBOROUGH reveals
Its value, with profound belief
I sing with him: “One pound of eels
Is better than a loin of beef.”
I chant it loudly in my bath,
I chant it when the sun is high,
And when the moon pursues her
path
Noctambulating through the sky.
And when the bill of fare at meals
Is more than usually brief,
Again I sing: “One pound of eels
Is better than a loin of beef.”
It is a charm that never fails
When friends accost me in the street
And utter agonizing wails
About the price of butcher's meat.
“Cheer up,” I tell them, “creels on creels
Are hastening to your relief;
Cheer up, my friends, one pound of
eels
Is better than a loin of beef.”
Then all ye fearful folk, dismayed
By threatened shortage of supplies,
Let not your anxious hearts be swayed
By croakers or their dismal cries;
But, from Penzance to Galashiels,
From Abertillery to Crieff,
Remember that “one pound of eels
Is better than a loin of beef.”
But these are only pleasant dreams
Unless, to realise our hopes,
Proprietors of ponds and streams
Re-stock them, like the early Popes.
Then, though we still run short of keels
And corn be leaner in the sheaf,
We shall at least have endless eels,
Unnumbered super-loins of beef.
AT THE PLAY.
“BILLETED.”
No wonder the Royalty Management,
realising how resolutely determined the
public was to have nothing to do with
anything so witty and workmanlike as
The Foundations of Mr. GALsworthy,
have for their new bill declined upon
the pleasantly trivial comedy of errors
and tarradiddles, Billeted.

pretty manor-house a nice vague
Colonel. The Vicar's sister disapproves,
because Betty is a grass-widow, and
Penelope, the all-but-flapper, an insuf-
ficient chaperone. She expresses her
disapproval with a hardy insolence
which must be rare with vicars' sisters
in these emancipated times. Naturally
when you have a great deal of palaver
about Betty's husband having deserted
her two years ago after a_serious tiff,
and no word spoken or written since,
you rightly guess that the expected
new Adjutant, Captain Rymill, will be
none other than the missing man. But
you probably don't guess that Betty,
to spoof the Church and keep the
Colonel, has decided to kill her husband
by faked telegram. So you have a dis-
tinctly intriguing theme, which Miss
TENNYsoN JEsse and Captain HARwood
handle with very considerable adroit-
ness and embroider with many really
sparkling and laughter-compelling lines.
I should like to ask the pleasant
authors some questions. How is it
that the infinitely susceptible Colonel,
who loves Penelope, but is so overcome
by the pseudo-sorrowing Betty that he
is afraid of “saying so much more than
he means,” and appeals to his invalu-
able Adjutant for help-how is it he
survived a bachelor till fifty 2 And
how did Betty, with her abysmal
ignorance of pass-book lore, manage to
postpone her financial catastrophe for
two whole years? And how do they
suppose so popular and personable a
man as Tāradine could come back to
England under an assumed name with-
out a number of highly inconvenient
questions being asked 2 More seriously,
I would ask if they really expect us to
believe in the reconciliation on so deep
a note of this nice butterfly and this
callous husband, who never intended,
but for the War, to come back from his
big-game shooting, and who took no
pains to arrange suitable guidance
(there was a lawyer vaguely mentioned,
but he seems to have been singularly
unobtrusive) for the obviously incompe-
tent spouse whom he professes still to
love? I am afraid it will not do. The
one real point of weakness in the pre-
sentation was that Mr. EADIE could
not modulate from the key of agreeable
flippancy in which the comedy as a
whole was set into that of the solemnly
sentimental coda. Thus was the artis-
tic unity of a pleasant trifle destroyed.
Mr. DAwson MILwARD's clever care-
ful method made the Colonel a very
live and plausible figure. Some of
his intimate touches were exceedingly
adroit. The authors deserve a fair share
of the credit. Indeed there was through-
out a suggestion of clever characterisa-
tion conspicuously above the average
of this genre. Penelope was an excel-
lently developed part, rendered with un-
expectedly mature skill by Miss STELLA
JEsse. The Vicar promised at first to
be a new type, but the authors seemed
to have lost interest in him half-way,
and not even Mr. LAWRENCE HANRAY's
skill and restraint could quite save him.
I rate Mr. EADIE as an actor too high
to be much amused by him in obviously
EADIE parts. “A man's reach must
exceed his grasp.” I think it just to
Miss Hoey to say that she seemed a
little handicapped by efforts of memory,
a condition which will duly disap-
ear and leave her charm to assert
itself. Mr. GEORGE HowARD was quite
admirable as a Scots bank manager;
Miss BLANCHE STANLEY, a really sound
combination of essential good-nature
and wounded dignity as a cook on the
verge of giving notice. Miss GERTRUDE
STERRoll, tackled a vicaress of the Mid-
Victorian era (authors' responsibility
this) with a courage which deserves
both praise and sympathy. T.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I FoRESEE the appearance, during the next few years, of
many regimental handbooks that will record the history at
this present visibly and gloriously in the making. One
such has already reached me, a second edition of A Brief
History of the King's Royal Rifle Corps (WARREN), compiled
and edited by Lieut.-General Sir Edward HUTTON, K.C.B.
It is a book to be bought and treasured by many to whom
the record of a fine and famous regiment has become in
these last years doubly precious. The moment of its
appearance is indeed excellently opportune, from the fact
that, in the first place, the K.R.R. was recruited from our
brothers across the Atlantic, the 60th Royal Americans
(as they were then) having been raised, in 1756, from the
| colonists in the Eastern States, with a view to retrieving
the recent disaster to General BRADDOCK's troops, and to
provide a force that could meet the French and Indians
upon equal terms. Thus the Regiment, which its historian
modestly calls a typical unit of the British Army, is in its
origin another link between the two great English-speaking
allies of to-day. It has a record, certainly second to none,
from Quebec to Ypres—one that splendidly bears out the
words, themselves ringing like steel, of its motto, Celer et
Audac. I should add that all profits from the sale of the
book will go to “The Ladies' Guild of the King's Royal
Rifle Corps.” Friends past and present will no doubt see
to it that these profits are considerable.

Chaplain of H.M.S. Cornwallis describe the part taken by
their ship and its gallant complement in the bombardment
of Gallipoli and the subsequent landings down to the final
evacuation. The account is clear, concise, unemotional
and uncontroversial. As a glimpse rather than a survey
of the Dardanelles campaign it strengthens our faith in the
spirit of the race without hopelessly undermining our con-
fidence in its intelligence. Beyond the fact that it records
deeds of brave men the book has no mission, and its cheerful
detachment might not, in the absence of sterner chronicles,
be salutary. But as long as there are enough Commissions
to publish scathing reports on this or that phase of national
ineptitude it is not the publishers' business to provide cath-
artics for the fatted soul of a self-satisfied people. As the
passing of time obliterates the - -
futilities and burnishes the hero-
isms of the noblest and most forlorn
adventure in the history of the race,
The Immortal Gamble will find a
just place among the simple chron-
icles of courage which the War is
storing up for the inspiration of the
generations to come.
I fancy that of late the cinema
has somewhat departed from its
life-long preoccupation with the
cow-boy, otherwise, I should have
little hesitation in predicting a great
future on the film for Naomi of the
Mountains (CASSELL). For this
very stirring drama of the wilder
West is so packed with what I can't
resist calling “reelism" that it is
almost impossible to think of it
otherwise than in terms of the
screen. It is concerned with the
wooing, by two contrasted suitors,
of Naomi, herself more or less a
child of nature, who dwelt in the
back - of- beyond with her old,
fanatic and extremely unpleasant
father. But, though the action is
of the breathless type that we
have come to expect from such a
setting, there is far more character
and serious observation than you
would be prepared to find. Mr.

Associations,” and the “Independent Committee for a Ger-
man Peace.” It is an insolent, humourless, immoral docu-
ment. Anything like it published in England would be
laughed out of court by Englishmen. It is difficult to keep
one's temper when one reads all this nauseating stuff about
the little German lamb being threatened by the wolf,
England (or Russia or France, as best suits the current
paragraph), and Germany's fine solicitude for the freedom
of the seas. It is no disrespect to Sir CHARLEs WALDSTEIN
that his acute and dispassionate comment is not so forcible
an argument to hold us unflinchingly to the essence of our
task as any page of the manifesto itself. The German, with
all his craft, has an almost unlimited capacity for giving
himself away. It would seem that, after all, humour is

\ gram to the general effect that

If I had been compelled to nom-

thing more soothing to tired nerves
than the tittle - tattle of these
Wendlebury old ladies it is im-
possible to imagine. And to add
to the lullaby we are given an
ancient cab-horse called Griselda,
who with a flick of her tail seems
to render the atmosphere even
more calm and serene. Then there
is a love-story which, in spite of
misunderstandings, is never really
perturbing, and—as a spice—a
fortune telling lady who in such
respectable society is as near to
being naughty as doesn't matter.
Small beer? Perhaps. But if you
want to get away from the War
and rumours of it, I advise you to
É-
human and well-observed men. I will not give you in
detail the varied course of Naomi's romance, which ends
in a perfect orgy of battle, with sheriffs and shooting,
redskins and revolvers—in short, all the effects that Mr.
HAwTREY not long ago so successfully illustrated on the
stage. To sum up, I should describe Naomi of the Moun-
tains as melodrama with a difference—the difference
residing in its clever character-drawing and some touches
of genuine emotion which liſt it above the ordinary. And
this from one to whom the Wild West in fiction has long
been a weariness is something more than tepid praise.
Sir CHARLEs WALDSTEIN, author of the thoughtful Aristo-
democracy, is a thinker with an internationalist mind. But
pray don't think he's not a whole-hogger about the War.
In What Germany is Fighting For (Long MANs) he analyses
the Germans' statement of their war-aims and does good
service by presenting an excellent translation, with com-
ment and epilogue, of the famous manifesto of “The Six

ONE STAR.
OccASIONALLY I receive letters from
friends whom I have not seen lately
addressed to Lieutenant MI and
apologising prettily inside in case I am
by now a colonel; in drawing-rooms
I am sometimes called “Captain-er”;
and up at the Fort the other day a
sentry of the Royal Defence Corps,
wearing the Crécy medal, mistook me
for a Major, and presented crossbows to
me. This is all wrong. As Mr. GARVIN
well points out, it is important that
we should not have a false perspective
of the War. Let me, then, make it per-
fectly plain—I am a Second Lieutenant.
When I first became a Second Lieu-
tenant I was rather proud. I was a
Second Lieutenant “on probation.” On

They were good stars, none better in
the service; and as we didn't like the
sound of “on probation" Celia put a
few stitches in them to make them
more permanent. This proved effective.
Six months later I had a very pleasant
note from the KING telling me that the
days of probation were now over, and
making it clear that he and I were
friends.
I was now a real Second Lieutenant.
On my right sleeve I had a single star.
Thus : -X-

On my left sleeve I also had a single
star. In this manner:
This star also was now a fixed one.
From that time forward my thoughts
dwelt naturally on promotion. There
They had two
So :
I decided to become a Lieutenant.
Promotion in our regiment was diffi-
cult. After giving the matter every
consideration I came to the conclusion
that the only way to win my second
star was to save the Colonel's life. I
used to follow him about affectionately
in the hope that he would fall into the
sea. He was a big strong man and a
powerful swimmer, but once in the
water it would not be difficult to cling
round his neck and give an impression
that I was rescuing him. However,
he refused to fall in. I fancy that he
wore somebody's Military Soles which
prevent slipping.
Years rolled on.
I used to look at
my stars sometimes, one on each sleeve;
they seemed very lonely. At times
they came close together; but at other
times, as, for instance, when I was
semaphoring, they were very far apart.
To prevent these occasional separations
Celia took them off my sleeves and put
them on my shoulders. One, on each
shoulder. So : -X-
And so:
-X-
There they stayed.
And more years rolled on.
One day Celia came to me in great
excitement.
“Have you seen this in the paper
about promotion ?” she said eagerly.
“No ; what is it 2 " I asked. “Are
they making more generals 2"
“I don't know about generals; it's
Second Lieutenants being Lieutenants.”
“You're joking on a very grave sub-
ject,” I said seriously. “You can't
expect to win the War if you go on
| like that.”
“Well, you read it,” she said, handing
me the paper. “It's a committee of
Mr. Winston CHURCHILL’s.”
I took the paper with a trembling
hand, and read. She was right ! If
the paper was to be believed, all Second
Lieutenants were to become Lieutenants
after eighteen years' service. At last
my chance had come.
“My dear, this is wonderful,” I said. |
“In another fifteen years we shall be
nearly there. You might buy two
more stars this afternoon and practise
sewing them on, in order to be ready.
You mustn't be taken by surprise when
the actual moment comes.”
“But you're a Lieutenant now,” she
said, “if that's true. It says that
“after eighteen months * * *
I snatched up the paper again. Good
Heavens! it was eighteen months—not
years.
“Then I am a Lieutenant,” I said.
We had a bottle of champagne for
dinner that night, and Celia got the
paper and read it aloud to my tunic.
And just for practice she took the two
stars off my other tunic and sewed
them on this one—thus:
-X- X- -X- X-
And we had a very happy evening.
“I suppose it will be a few days
before it's officially announced,” I said.
“Bother, I suppose it will,” said
Celia, and very reluctantly she took
one star off each shoulder, leaving the
matter—so :
-X-
-X-
And the months rolled on.
And I am still a Second Lieutenant...
I do not complain; indeed I am even
rather proud of it. If I am not gain-
ing on my original one star, at least I
am keeping pace with it. I might so
easily have been a corporal by now.
But I should like to have seen a little
more notice taken of me in the Gazette.
I scan it every day, hoping for some
such announcement as this:
“Second Lieutenant M
a Second Lieutenant.”
Or this:
“Second Lieutenant to be
seconded and to retain his present rank
of Second Lieutenant.”
Or even this:
“Second Lieutenant M relim-
quishes the rank of Acting Second
Lieutenant on ceasing to command a
Battalion, and reverts to the rank of
Second Lieutenant.”
Failing this, I have thought some-
times of making an announcement in
the Personal Column of The Times :
“Second Lieutenant M- regrets
that his duties as a Second Lieutenant
prevent him from replying personally
to the many kind inquiries he has
received, and begs to take this oppor-
tunity of announcing that he still
retains a star on each shoulder. Both
doing well.”
But perhaps that is unnecessary
now. I think that by this time I have
made it clear just how many stars I
possess.
One on the right shoulder. So:
to remain

And one on the left shoulder. So:
That is all. A. A. M.

Upon the terrace where I play

His legs were waving in the sun,

THE MUD LARKS.
I AM living at present in one of those
villages in which the retreating Hun
has left no stone unturned. With
characteristic thoroughness he fired it
first, then blew it up, and has been
shelling it ever since. What with one
thing and another, it is in an advanced
state of dilapidation; in fact, if it were
not that one has the map's word for it,
and a notice perched on a heap of brick-
dust saying that the Town Major may be
found within, the casual wayfarer might
imagine himself in the Sahara, Kalahari,
or the south end of Kingsway.
Some of these French towns are very
difficult to recognise as such ; only the
trained detective can do it. A certain
Irish Regiment was presented with the
job of capturing one. The
scheme was roughly this.
They were to climb the
parapet at 5.25 A.M. and
| rush a quarry some one
hundred yards distant.
After half - an - hour's
breather they were to go
on to some machine-gun
emplacements, dispose of
these, wait a further
twenty minutes, and then
take the town. Distance

in all. Promptly at zero

an hour later there is not a soul to be
seen. They have all gone to ground.
My groom and countryman went in

plank sticking out of a heap of debris, One afternoon the sapping

and saw visions, dreamed dreams. He
handed the hole back to the rabbit and
to evolve a bungalow. By
evening it was complete.
He crawled within and
went to sleep, slept like
a drugged dormouse. At

ing at the machineguns. Then being still
full of fun and joie de vivre, and having
no officers left to hamper their fine flow-
ing style, they ducked through their own
barrage and raced all out for the final
objective. Twenty minutes later, two
miles further on, one perspiring private
turned to his panting chum, “For the
love of God, Mike, aren't we getting in
the near of this damn town yet 2"
I have a vast respect for HINDENBURG
(a man who can drink the mixtures he
does, and still sit up and smile sunnily
into the jaws of a camera ten times a
day, is worthy of anybody's veneration),
but if he thought that by blowing these
poor little French villages into small
smithereens he would deprive the B.E.F.
of headcover and cause it to catch cold
and trot home to mother, he will have to
sit up late and do some more thinking.
For Atkins of to-day is a knowing bird;
he can make a little go the whole dis-
tance and conjure plenty out of nothing-
ness. As for cover, two bricks and his
shrapnel hat make a very passable
pavilion. Goodness knows it would
place, Sor, for the dhread of treadin' in
the belly of an officer an' him aslape.”
Some people have the bungalow mania
and build them bijoux maisonettes out
of biscuit tins, sacking and what-not,
but the majority go to ground. I am
one of the majority; I go to ground
like a badger, for experience has taught
me that a dug-out—cramped, damp,
dark though it may be—cannot be stolen
from you while you sleep; that is to
say, thieves cannot come along in the
middle of the night, dig it up bodily by
the roots and cart it away in a G.S.
waggon without you, the occupant,
being aware that some irregularity is
occurring to the home. On the other
hand, in this country, where the warrior,
when he falls on sleep suffers a sort
of temporary death, bungalows can be
easily purloined from round about him
without his knowledge; and what is
more, frequently are.
For instance, a certain bungalow
in our village was stolen as fre-
quently as three times in one night.
This was the way of it. One Todd,
leave for ten years. The
batman scratched his head, then slid
softly away into the night. By the
time the ponies were tilting the last
drops out of their nosebags the faithful
servant had scratched together a few
sheets of corrugated, and piled them
into a rough shelter. The Major wrig-
|gled beneath it and was presently put-
|ting up a barrage of snores terrible to
hear. At midnight a battalion of the
Loamshire Light Infantry trudged into
the village. It was raining in solid
chunks, and the Colonel Commanding
looked like Victoria Falls and felt like
a submarine. He gave expression to
his sentiments in a series of splutter-
ing bellows. His batman trembled and
faded into the darkness d pas de loup.
By the time the old gentleman had
halted his command and cursed them
“good night” his resourceful retainer
had found a sheet or two of corrugated
iron somewhere and assembled them
into some sort of bivouac for the recep-
tion of his lord. His lord fell inside,
kicked off his boots and slept instantly,
slept like a wintering bear.

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(Herr Mich. ELIs : Marshal roN HINDENBURG.)
Herr M. Good morning, my dear Marshal. I am glad
we have been able to arrange a meeting, for there are
certain points I wish to settle with you.
Von H. I am, as always, at your Excellency's service;
only I beg that the interview may not be prolonged beyond
what is strictly needful. Time presses, and much remains
to be done everywhere.
Herr M. But I have the commands of the ALL-HIGHEST
to speak with you on some weighty matters. He himself,
as you know, has several speeches to make to-day.
Von H. Oh, those speeches' How well I know them.
I could almost make them myself if I wanted to make
speeches, which, God be thanked, I do not need to do.
Herr M. No, indeed. Your reputation rests on founda-
tions firmer than speeches.
Von H. You yourself, Excellency, have lately discovered
how fallacious a thing is a speech, even where the speaker
honestly tries to do his best to please everybody.
Herr M. You are very kind, my dear Marshal, to speak
thus of my humble effort. The result of it has certainly
disappointed me.
Wom. H. What was it that LEDEBOUR said of it 2 Did
he not describe it as “a political hocus-pocus "? Such
men ought to be at once taken out and shot. But we
Prussians have always been too gentle in our methods.
Herr M. We have. It is perhaps our only fault; but
this time we must see that we correct it. In any case, to
be so misunderstood is most painful, especially when one
has employed all one's tact.
|Won. H. Ah, tact.
is it not ?
Herr M. HIs IMPERIAL MAJESTY has more than once
been graciously pleased to compliment me upon it. And
he, if anyone, is a judge of tact, is he not 2
Von H. I have not myself any knowledge of it, so I
cannot say for certain. Does it perhaps mean what you do
when you entirely forget in one speech what you have said
or omitted to say in a previous speech 2 -
Herr M. (aside). The old fellow is not, after all, so thick-
skulled as I thought him. (Aloud) I will not ask you to
discuss this subject any more, but will proceed to lay before
you the commands of His MAJESTY.
Von H. I shall be glad to hear them.
Herr M. Well, then, to cut the matter as short as
possible, HIS MAJESTY insists that there shall be a victory
on the Western Front.
Von H. A victory 2
Herr M. Yes, a victory. A real one, mind, not a made-up
affair like the capture of Langemarck, which, though it
was certainly captured, was not captured by us, but by the
accursed English. May Heaven destroy them
Von H. But it was by HIS MAJESTY's orders that we
announced the capture of Langemarck.
Herr M. I know; but he is graciously pleased to forget
that, and to desire a genuine victory now.
Von H. Tell him I cannot promise. We have done our
best at Verdun, at Lens and at Ypres, but we have had to
retreat everywhere. Our turn may come another time,
but, as I say, I cannot promise.
Herr M. Please go on doing your best. It is so annoying
and temper-spoiling for HIS MAJESTY to make so many
speeches of a fiery kind, and never to have a victory—at
least not a real one for which Berlin can hang out flags.
Besides, if we don't get a victory how shall we ever get a
good German peace? And peace we must have, and that
very soon.
That is what you are celebrated for,
Von H. Don't talk to me of peace. War is my business,
not peace; and if I am to carry on war there must be no
interference. If the ALL-HIGHEST does not like that, let
him take the chief command himself.
Herr M. God forbid
LINES TO A HUN AIRMAN,
WHO AROUSED THE DETACHMENT ON A CHILLY MORNING,
AT 2.30 A.M.
OH, come again, but at another time;
Choose some more fitting moment to appear,
For even in fair Gallia's sunny clime
The dawns are chilly at this time of year.
I did not go to bed till one last night,
I was on guard, and, pacing up and down,
Gazed often on the sky where every light
Flamed like a gem in Night's imperial crown;
And when the clamant rattle's hideous sound
Roused me from sleep, in a far distant land
My spirit moved and trod familiar ground, -
Where a Young Hopeful sat at my right hand.
There was a spotless cloth upon the board,
Thin bread-and-butter was upon me pressed,
And China tea in a frail cup was poured— -
Then I rushed forth inadequately dressed.
Lo! the poor Sergeant in a shrunken shirt,
His manly limbs exposed to morning's dew,
His massive feet all paddling in the dirt—
Such sights should move the heart of even you.
The worthy Corporal, sage in looks and speeches,
Holds up his trousers with a trembling hand;
Lucky for him he slumbered in his breeches—
The most clothed man of all our shivering band.
The wretched gunners cluster on the gun,
Clasping the clammy breech and slippery shells;
If 'tis a joke they do not see the fun
And damn you to the worst of DANTE's hells.
And Sub-Lieutenant Blank, that martial man,
Shows his pyjamas to a startled world,
And shivers in the foremost of our van
The while our H.E. shells are upwards hurled.
You vanish, not ten centimes worth the worse
For all our noise, so far as we can tell;
The blest “Stand easy” comes; with many a curse
We hurry to the tents named after Bell.”
In two brief hours we must arise and shine!
O willow-waly | Would I were at home
Where leisurely I breakfasted at nine
And warm and fed went officeward to roam I
So come again, but at another time,
Say after breakfast or some hour like that,
Or I will strafe you with a viler rhyme—
I will, by Jove' or eat my shell-proof hat.
* On second thoughts I don't believe they are named after anyone,
but “Bell" rhymes comfortably with “tell,” so it may stand.
“The Rev. T. F. — officiated in the church yesterday for the first

THE PASSING OF THE COD'S HEAD.
(A Romance of Chiswick Mall.)
It was because the dustnan did not come;
It was because our cat was overfed, , ,
And, gorged with some superior pabulum,
Declined to touch the cod's disgusting head;
It was because the weather was too warm
To hide the horror in the refuse-bin,
And too intense the perfume of its form,
My wife commanded me to do the sin,
To take and cast it in the twinkling Thames—
A practice which the neighbourhood condemns.
So on the midnight, with a strong cigar
And scented handkerchief, I tiptoed near,
But felt the exotic fragrance from afar;
I thought of ARTHUR and Sir BEDIverE:
And it seemed best to leave it on the plate,
So strode I back and told my curious spouse
“I heard the high tide lap along the Eyot, .
And the wild water at the barge's bows.”
She said, “O treacherous ! O heart of clay !
Go back and throw the smelly thing away.” .
Thereat I seized it, and with guilty shoon . .
Stole out indignant to the water's marge;
Its eyes like emeralds caught the affronted moon;
The stars conspired to make the thing look large;
Surely all Chiswick would perceive my shame!
I clutched the indecency and whirled it round
And flung it from me like a torch in flame,
And a great wailing swept across the sound,
As though the deep were calling back its kith,
I said, “It will go down to Hammersmith.
“It will go down beyond the Chelsea flats,
And hang with barges under Battersea,
Will press past Wapping with decaying cats,
...And the dead dog shall bear it company;
Small bathing boys shall feel its clammy prod,
And think some jellyfish has fled the surge;
And so 'twill win to where the tribe of cod
In its own ooze intones a fitting dirge,
And after that some false and impious fish
Will likely have it for a breakfast dish.”
The morning dawned. The tide had stripped the
shore;
And that foul shape I fancied so remote
Lay stark below, just opposite next-door!
Who would have said a cod's head could not
float 2 -
No more my neighbour in his garden sits;
My callers now regard the view with groans;
For tides may roll and rot the fleshly bits,
But what shall mortify those ageless bones?
How shall I bear to hear my grandsons say,
“Look at the fish that grand-dad threw away"?
— A. P. H.

“As so many of our clients were disappointed last year . . . we are

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAR-TIME WALKS.
(With apologies to a contemporary for cutting the ground
from under its feet, and to our readers for omitting certain
names—in deference to the Censor.) -
Owing to the War one must save money and spend
as little as possible on fares when rambling for pleasure.
The following itinerary will be found quite an inexpensive
one, though offering plenty of interest. Take the train
to Leave the station by the exit on the south side,
and turn to the right under the railway bridge, taking
the path by the stream till you come to a bridge which
crosses it. -
Do not cross the stream, however, but turn sharply to
the right (opposite a rather pretentious-looking house) for
two hundred yards or so, when you will come to a park.
A little before entering the park you will see, lying not far
from the road on the left, a remarkable old monastery
church, much restored. This contains some fine old
painted glass, some tombs and monumental inscriptions
which are worth a visit if time will allow.
There is a right of way through the park up to the house,
which belongs to the Earl of C , but is not of great
architectural interest. Bear to the right in front of the
| house, along a path which skirts the wall of the private
| Fºund. At the end of the wall a gateway leads into
: the high road, and a walk of under two miles will bring
you to the, at one time, pretty village of K , which
ſ has, however, grown rapidly into a thriving town. Be-
! fore reaching the parish church there is a hostelry on the
right-hand side of the road where an excellent tea may
be obtained (so far as the food regulations will allow).
On leaving the inn, turn through a gateway at the side
of it, which gives on to a straight and rather uninteresting
road, which has been considerably built upon and is more
or less private, though a right of way has been preserved
through it. A glimpse of a large mansion, chiefly of the
17th century, and now in the possession of the W S,
may be obtained through the trees on the right of the road.
When you come to the main road (at the far end of this
semi-private road) turn to the right, and just where the
gibbet used to stand, so it is said, in the good old days,
| there is a sharp left-angled turn which leads to the village
of E Keep straight on, however, for a mile or two
(notice the fine old timbered houses on the right of the
footpath opposite the old boundary-post), and then turn to
the right by the church, rebuilt in the 17th century on the
site of an older and finer one, whose spire was at one time
a noted landmark.
A walk through the churchyard to the church porch
brings you to the brow of a hill. Descend this to the
cross-roads at the bottom, but, instead of turning to either
hand, keep to the narrow road in front till you come to a
gateway on the left. This leads to a house which formerly
belonged to the Knights Templars, but which passed into
the hands of the L s and is still in their possession.
There is an interesting chapel in the grounds, containing
the tombs of some of the former owners, whose deeds were
more warlike, though probably less numerous, than those
of the present occupants.
From here an easy walk up the Strand will bring
you to the starting point, Charing Cross Embankment
Station, where you can take the train again; but if you
are fit and between the ages of forty-one and fifty, you
can continue the walk till you reach the nearest Recruit-
ing Office.

LINES ON RE-READING “BLEAK HOUSE.”
THERE was a time when, posing as a purist,
I thought it fine to criticise and crab
CHARLEs DickeNs as a crude caricaturist,
Who laid his colours on too thick and slab,
Who was a sort of sentimental tourist
And made life lurid when it should be drab ;
In short I branded as a brilliant dauber
The man who gave us Pecksniff and Micawber.
True, there are blots—like spots upon the sun–
And genius, lavish of imagination,
In sheer profusion always has outrun
The bounds of strict artistic concentration;
Dut when detraction's worst is said and done,
How much remains for fervent admiration,
How much that never palls or wounds or sickens
(Unlike some moderns) in great generous DickeNS!
And in Bleak House, the culminating story
That marks the zenith of his swift career,
All the great qualities that won him glory,
As writer and reformer too, appear:
Righteous resentment of abuses hoary,
Of pomp and cant, self-centred, insincere;
And burning sympathy that glows unchecked
For those who sit in darkness and neglect.
Who, if his heart be not of steel or stone,
Can read unmoved of Charley or of Jo ;
Of dear Miss Flite, who, though her wits be flown,
Has kept a soul as pure as driven snow;
Of the fierce “man from Shropshire" overthrown
By Law's delays; of Caddy's inky woe;
Or of the alternating fits and fluster
That harass the unhappy slavey, Guster 2
And there are scores of characters so vivid
They make us friends or enemies for life:
Hortense, half tamed she-wolf, with envy livid;
The patient Snagsby and his shrewish wife;
The amorous Guppy, who poor Esther chivvied;
Tempestuous Boythorn, revelling in strife;
Skimpole, the honey-tongued artistic cadger;
And that tremendous woman, Mrs. Badger.
No wonder then that, when we seek awhile
Relief and respite from War's strident chorus,
Few books more swiftly charm us to a smile,
Few books more truly hearten and restore us
Than his, whose art was potent to beguile
Thousands of weary souls who came before us—
No wonder, when the Huns, who ban our fiction,
Were fain to free him from their malediction.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE INVISIBLE FoE.”
MR. H. B. IRVING has elected to play
villain in a new mystery play by Mr.
WALTER HACRETT. Essential elements
of the business as follows: Obstinate
old millstone of a shipbuilder, Bransby,
who simply will not give up shipbuild-
ing for aeroplane making (and no wonder
in these days!); nephew Stephen, with
an unwholesome hankering after power
and a complete inability to see the
obvious; nephew Hugh, lieutenant lately
and intelligent hankering after Helen
Bransby; Clerk, mouldy, faithful, one
who discovers deficit in the West African
ledger to the extent of ten thousand
pounds.
The false entries are in the hand of
Hugh, but Stephen's sinister eye and
shocking suit of solemn black promptly
give him away to the audience, while
with a gorgeous fatuity he gives himself
away to his uncle by writing out his
brother's resignation of the King's Com-
mission (in itself an odd thing to do) in
the very hand he had so adroitly prac-
tised in order to manipulate the ledger.
Whereupon, at Bransby's dictation,
Stephen writes a full confession, leaving
frame of mind. The old man puts the
confession quite naturally (the firm is
like that) between the leaves of his David
Copperfield, and dies of heart failure.
So Stephen is again up on Hugh at
the turn. Indeed in the six months
that have elapsed between Acts.I. and II.
many things have happened, and neg-
lected to happen. Stephen has become
by common report a great man, pillar
of the house of Bransby, which now
makes aeroplanes like anything. He
has been too busy getting power even
to look into his uncle's papers (though
executor), or to have the West African
ledger taken back to the office, or,
queerest of all, to discover and destroy
that damning confession. However,
having got his power, he now proceeds
missing document.
On the same day Helen arrives un-
expectedly, urged thereto by a vague
impression inspired by her dead father
that Hugh's innocence will be esta-
blished by something found in the
fateful room; also IIugh, who had
enlisted and now comes back from
France a sergeant, with the same idea
in his head and from the same source.
As we had all seen the paper's hiding-
place I found it a little difficult to be
impressed by the elaborate efforts, un-
conscionably long drawn out, of the
departed spirit to disclose the matter
to Helen and Hugh, while the masterly

inactivity of Stephen, who was trying
to find his document by pure reason
(mere looking for it would not occur to
his Napoleonic brain), confirmed the
opinion I had earlier formed of that
solemn ass. However, his invisible
foe does contrive to get his message
through to the lovers and smash up
Stephen and his bubble of power.
I can't help being surprised that
Mr. H. B. IRVING should have been
satisfied with so impossible a character
as Stephen Pryde, though I need not
add that he made most effective play
with the terror of an evil conscience
haunted by the vengeful dead, throwing
away his consonants rather recklessly
in the process and receiving the
plaudits of an enthusiastic audience.
I grant Mr. HACKETT freely his
effects of eeriness and his sound judg-
ment in manipulating his ghost without
materialising him; and congratulate
him particularly on the part of the
vague American lady, most capably
performed by Miss MARION LORNE.
Miss FAY CoMPTON made a pretty
lover and plausible clairvoyante. Mr.
SYDNEY WALENTINE’s portrait was (yes!)
masterly; and Mr. ToM REYNoLDs is
excellent as the confidential clerk. Mr.
HolMAN CLARK struck me (without
surprise) as slightly bored with his part
of a Doctor who lost his patient in the
first Act and remained as a convenient
peg for the plot. His adroit method
ensures smooth playing and pulls a cast
together.

PLAYING THE GAME.
AFTER we had finally arranged the
cricket match —Convalescents versus
the Village—for the benefit of the
Serbian Relief Fund, we remembered
that early in the year the cricket-field
had been selected for the site of the
village potato-patch, and my favourite
end of the pitch—the one without the

continued. “Anyone breaking a winder

mind could in the time have framed a
punishment so convincingly deterrent.
The scoop shot from the pergola end
was ruled out in a sentence, and we
were treated to a masterly and Jesso-
pian demonstration of how to get an off

grip upon the situation, and were only
saved from ignominious failure by the
enterprise of the British Army, in this
case represented by Sergeant-Major
Kippy, D.C.M., who was recovering
in the best of spirits from his third
blighty one.
“'Ow about the Colonel's lack
unknown factor.
In this case Kippy was not aware
that, on the far side of the shrubbery,
against an ancient sun-bathed wall,
stood the greenhouse which sheltered

gardin?’, he suggested. “There's &^*}^* &º
a lovely bit o' turf there.” .***- Ss sº % * -- " -
We remembered the perfect and
spacious lawn, scarcely less level
than a billiard-table, and, even
with the Colonel busy on the East
Coast, the committee were unani-
mously adverse to the suggestion.
But Kippy, born within hail of al
Kentish cricket-field, was not to
be denied, and, after all, one cannot
haggle about a mere garden with
someone who was with the first
battalions over the Messines Ridge.
Thus the affair was taken out of
our hands, and when the day
arrived we pitched the stumps
where Kippy, giving due con-
sideration to the Colonel's foliage,
thought the light was most advan-
tageous.
The Village won the toss, and old
Tom Pratt took guard and proceeded
to dig himself in by making what he
termed his “block-hole.” I visualised
the choleric blue eye of the Colonel
and shuddered.
For a time matters proceeded un-
eventfully. Then, at the fall of the
fourth wicket, the game suddenly de-
veloped, Jim Butcher, batting at the
pergola end, giving us an exhibition of
his famous scoop shot, which landed
full pitch through the drawing-room
window. It was a catastrophe of such
dimensions that even the boldest spirit
quailed before it, and the Colonel's
butler, batting at the other end, im-
mediately dissociated himself from the
proceedings and bolted from the field.
Kippy, as befitted a warrior of parts,
was the first to recover.
“’Ere,” he exclaimed, “we carn’t
'ave this; wot do you think the Colonel
will say?”
I do not suppose there was anyone
who had not thought of it.

Jim Butcher, playing this time from
the rockery end, brought off the double
event and caused another new clause
to be added to the local rules. With
thirty-seven to his credit and still unde-
feated he was making history in the
village, though it must be admitted
that no one was ever less anxious to
retain the post of honour, and when
the gardener laid out the damaged fruit
nothing short of Kippy's appeal would
have persuaded him to continue his
innings.
“Wot, retire jest when you're gettin'

fidentially, “An' them Serbian boxes

an irresistible argument, and Jim

slightly restricted conditions.
Colonel's prize grapes. And so
At 6.50, with ten minutes to play,
the Convalescents, who had shown great
form, required only twelve runs to win
the match. Kippy and Gunner Toady
shared the batting. A pretty glance to
leg for two by the Gunner was all that
could be taken out of the penultimate
over, and Rippy at the pergola end
faced Mark Styles, the postman, to take
the first ball of the last over. Two
singles were run, and then Kippy
placed one nicely into the herbaceous
border for four. The next one nearly got
him, and then, with the seven o'clock
delivery, as it were, the postman tossed
up a half-volley on the leg side. For-
gotten were the rules, the windows and
all else. Kippy jumped out and, with
every muscle he could bring into action,
hit it straight through the plate-glass
panel of the billiard-room door.
For five petrified seconds we gazed
at the wreckage, and then the door
opened and the Colonel walked
briskly into the garden. Anything
else—a bemb or an earthquake—
might merely have created curi-
osity, but this was different.
Quite unostentatiously I vacated
my position at fine leg and merged
myself with the slips, who, together
with point and cover, were bearing
a course towards the labyrinthine
* ways of the kitchen-garden. After
vainly searching for an imaginary
ball and finding that we were not

we ventured at length to return.

worn pitch. The Colonel was
speaking.
“. . . Lose ten runs and the
match ! I never heard such infernal
nonsense. That shot was worth six
runs on any ground. I shall insist on

At the same time I noticed that
Kippy was holding a red-and-white
box, and the Colonel was with diffi-
culty thrusting something through the
inadequate slit. -
It looked like a piece of paper.

Martin Slim, 25, single, categoried
A 1, applied for exemption to the Bump-
shire Tribunal on the ground that if he
were required to do military service he
would lose a substantial fortune. Appli-
cant explained that he was engaged in
an enterprise which involved the plant-

The trees would be ready for cutting in
about 1945, by which time it was esti-

Among the recent applicants to the
Snobington Appeal Tribunal was the
Hon. Geoffrey de Knute. Solicitor for
the applicant stated that his client, who
was already giving all his time to the
organisation of hat-trimming competi-
tions for wounded soldiers and other
work of national importance, desired
exemption for the reason that he ex-
pected shortly to succeed to the Earl-
dom of Swankshire. There were, he
explained, three brothers who stood
between his client and the title, all over
military age. It was expected, how-
ever, that the age limit would before
long be substantially raised, in which
case there was every reason to believe
that his client, if exempted from mili-

After some consultation the chairman
stated that ten years' exemption would
be granted.

THE CONVERT.
THERE were three of us—a soldier, a flâneur and myself,
who am neither but would like to be either. We were talking
about the strange appearance—a phenomenon of the day—
of French wine in German bottles, and this led to the re-
expression of my life-long surprise that bottles should exist
in such numbers as they do—bottles everywhere, all over
the world, with wine and beer in them, and no one under
any obligation to save and return them.
“Well,” said the soldier (who may or may not have known
that I was one of those writing fellows), “that has never
struck me as odd. Of course there are lots of bottles.
Bottles are necessary. But what beats me is the number
of books. New books and old books, books in shops and books
on stalls, and books in houses; and on top of all that—
libraries. That's rum, if you like. I most cordially hope,”
he added, “that there are more bottles than books in the
World.” * -
“I don't care how many there are of either,” said the
fláneur; “but I know this—another book's badly wanted.”
“Oh, come off it,” said the enemy of authorship. “How
can another book be needed ? Have you ever seen the
British Museum Reading Room 2 It's simply awful. It's
a kind of disease. I was taken there once by an aunt
when I was a boy, and it has haunted me ever since.
Books by the million all round the room, and the desks
crowded with people writing new ones. Men and women.
Mixed writing, you know. Terrible!”
“All that may be true,” said the flâneur, “but the fact
remains that another book is still needed.”
“Impossible,” said the soldier, “unless it's a cheque-book.
There I'm with you.”
“No, a book—a real book. Small, I admit, but real.
And I believe I can make you agree with me. I’m full
of it, because I discovered the need of it only this last
week-end.” -
“Well, what is it to be called 2 " the sceptic asked.
“I think a good title would be, Have I Put Everything
in 2'' -
“Sounds like a manual of bayonet exercise,” said the
soldier, and he made imaginary lunges at imaginary Huns.
“Very well then, to prevent ambiguity call it Have I
Left Anything out 2 The sub-title would be ‘A Guide to
Packing,' or ‘The Week-Ender's Friend.’”
“Ah!” said the other, beginning to be interested.
“With such a book,” the flâneur continued, “you could
never, as I did on Saturday, arrive at a house without
any pyjamas, because you would find pyjamas in the list,
and directly you came to them you would shove them in.
That would be the special merit of the book—that you
would get, out of wardrobes and drawers and off the
dressing-table, the things it mentioned as you read them
and shove them in.” -
“You would hold the book in the left hand,” said the
soldier, with almost as much excitement as though he were
the author, “and pack with the right. That's the way.”
“Yes, that's the way. It would be only a little book—
like a vest-pocket diary—but it would be priceless. It
would be divided into sections covering the different kinds
of visit to be paid—week-end, week, fortnight, and so on.
Then the kind of place–seaside, river, shooting, hunting,
and so on. Foreign travel might come in as well.”
“Yes,” said the soldier, “lists of things for Egypt, India,
Nairobi.”
“That's it,” said the flâneur. “And there would be
some unexpected things too. I guess you could help me
there with all your wide experience.”
“A corkscrew, of course,” said the soldier.
“I said unexpected things,” said the flâneur reprovingly,
“such as–well, such as a screw-driver for eye-glasses—
most useful. And a carriage key. And x 1.
His pause was my opportunity. “I’ll tell you another
thing,” I said, “something for which I'd have given a
sovereign in that gale last week when I was at the seaside
—window-wedges. Never again shall I travel without
window-wedges.” -
“By Jove!” said the soldier, “that's an idea. Put down
window-wedges at once. It's a great book this,” he went
on. “And needed—I should jolly well say so. You ought
to compile it at once—before any of us has time to go
away again. Personally I don't know how I've lived with-
out it. Why, just talking about it makes me feel quite a
literary character.”

IN The Irish on the Somme (HopDER AND STOUGHToN)
Mr. MICHAEL MACDoNAGH continues the story which he
began in The Irish at the Front. He gives us more
accounts of the heroism of his fellow-countrymen in the
titanic battles that have thrilled the minds of men all the
world over. He writes with a justifiable enthusiasm of
the deeds of these gallant Irishmen. The book stirs the
blood like the sound of a trumpet. In a war which has
produced so many glorious actions the Irish are second to
none. Even those who do not agree in every point with
Mr. John REDMOND will admit ungrudgingly that he makes
good the claims he puts forward in his introduction to
Mr. MAcDoNAGH's book. He tells us that from Ireland
173,772 Irishmen are serving in the Army and Navy, and
that in addition at least 150,000 of the Irish race have
joined the colours in Great Britain — no mean record.
Mr. MACDoNAGH is as proud of the glory of the Ulstermen
as of that of Nationalist Ireland. He dedicates his book to
the carum caput of Major WILLIE REDMOND.
Mr. E. B. Osborn, who has written The Maid with Wings,
and other Fantasies Grave to Gay (LANE), will perhaps not
altogether thank me for saying that among the Other
Fantasies, I throughout preferred the grave to the gay.
The Maid with Wings itself is a beautiful little piece of
imagination—the vision of the Maid of France comforting
an English boy during his last moments out in No Man's
Land. The thing is well and delicately done, with a
reserve that may encourage the judicious to hope for good
work in the future from a pen that is (I fancy) as yet
somewhat new. On the other hand, I must confess that
the Gaiety left me (though this, of course, may be an
isolated experience) with sides unshaken. “Callisthenes
at Cambridge,” for example, is but little removed from the
article that, to my certain knowledge, has padded school
and 'Varsity magazines since such began to be. Still, I
liked the plea for Protection against foreign imports in
literature and art by way of helping the native producer,
though even here some condensation would, I thought,
have sharpened the point. But, after all, reviewers are
dull dogs to move to laughter (as no doubt Mr. Osborn
will now agree), so I hope he will rest content with my
genuine appreciation of his graver passages, and will be
encouraged to give us something more ambitious and less
open to the suspicion of book-making.

perspective, knows only that he and his fellows, having
volunteered to fight, are being called on instead to endure a
purgatorial routine of dust and dulness, mosquitoes, malaria
and night marches, and the grilling away of useless days in
the society of flies and lizards, with only, as a very occa-
sional treat, the smallest glimpse of anything resembling
a Front. And all this is in a country so desolated by
centuries of war that in spite of obvious natural fertility it
is a sullen treeless desert—a desert of blight and thistles,
as profitless to our men as their periodically deferred anti-
cipations of a grand advance. A book that sets out to record
vacuity can hardly be crammed with thrilling literature,
and I am not going to pretend that Mr. LAKE has achieved
the impossible. All the same one found points—for in-
stance, his desire that someone (apparently England for
choice!) should colonise Macedonia; and his most right
and appropriate plea for fairer recognition of those who
have sacrificed their health in the national service. A
man, he holds, who is to suffer all his life from malarial
fever has done his bit no less than plenty who bear the
honourable insignia of the wounded in battle and the snout
of a mosquito may be as valorously. encountered as the
bayonet of a Hun. And so say all of us.
he tries his hand at telling a practical joke he does not know
when to stop. There are, however, stories in this volume
which deserve unqualified praise. The shortest, “How
Half a Man Died,” is the best; indeed, it is a real gem.
But “The Missing K.C.’s ” has a genuine thrill in it; and,
in a very different manner, “A By-Product” is proof enough
that the author can get his effects all the more readily
when he keeps his own feelings under the strictest control.
Mr. Oxenham's XI. has weak points in it, but on the whole
it is a good side.

THE END OF AN EPISODE.
I writF, this in the beginning of a
minor tragedy; if indeed the severance
of any long, helpful and sympathetic
association can ever be so lightly
named. For that is precisely what
our intercourse has been these many
weeks past; one of nervous and quickly
roused irritation on my part, of swift
and gentle ministration on his.
At least once a day we have met
during that period (and occasionally,
though rarely, more often), usually in
those before-breakfast hours when the
temper of normal man is most exacting
and uncertain. But his temper never
varied; the perfection of it was indeed
among.his finest qualities. Morning
after morning, throughout a time that,
as it chanced, has been full of distress
and disappointment, would his soothing
and infinitely gentle touch recall me to
content. That stroking caress of his
was a thing indescribable; one before
which the black shadows left by the
hours of night seemed literally to dis-
solve and vanish.
And now the long expected, long
dreaded has begun to happen. He, too,
is turning against me, as so many
others of his fellows have done in the
past. Who knows the reason 2 What
continued roughness on my part has
at last worn out even him 2 But for
some days now there has been no mis-
reading the fatal symptoms—increasing
irritability on the one side, harshness
turning to blunt indifference on the
other. And this morning came the
unforgivable offence, the cut direct.
That settles it; to-morrow, with a
still smarting regret, I unwrap a new
razor-blade. -

THE SUPER-PIPE.
WHEN Jackson first joined the jolly
old B.E.F. he smoked a pipe. He
carried it anyhow. Loose in his pocket,
mind you. A pipe-bowl at his pocket's
brim a simple pipe-bowl was to him,
and it was nothing more. Of course no
! decent B.E.F. mess could stand that.
Jackson was told that a pipe was
amathema maranatha, which is Greek
; for no bon. -
“What will I smoke then 2" said
! Jackson, who was no Englishman.
! We waited for the Intelligence Officer
i to reply. We knew him. The Intelli-
| gence Officer said nothing. He drew
something from his pocket. It was a
parcel wrapped in cloth-of-gold. He
removed the cloth-of-gold and there
i was discovered a casket, which he
unlocked with a key attached to his
i identity disc. Inside the casket was a
padlocked box, which he opened with
a key attached by gold wire to his
advance pay-book. Inside the box was
a roll of silk. To cut it all short, he
unwound puttee after puttee of careful
wrapping till he reached a chamois-
leather chrysalis, which he handled
with extreme reverence, and from this
he drew something with gentle fingers,
and set iſ on the table-cloth before the
goggle-eyed Jackson.
“A pipe,” said Jackson. -
There was a shriek of horror. The
Intelligence Officer fainted. Here was
wanton sacrilege.
“Man,” said the iron-nerved Bomb-
ing Officer, “it’s a Brownhill.”
“What 's a Brownhill ?”
Jackson.
We gasped. How could we begin to
asked
| tell him of that West End shrine from
which issue these lacquered symbols of
a New Religion ?
The Intelligence Officer was reviving.
We looked to him.
“The prophet Brownhill,” he said,
“was once a tobacconist—an ordinary
tobacconist who sold pipes.”
We shuddered.
“He discovered one day that man
wants more than mere pipes. He
wants a-a super-pipe, something to
reverence and—er—look after, you
know, as well as to smoke. So he
invented the Brownhill. It is an
affaire de cour—an affair of art,”
translated the I.O. proudly. “It is as
glossy as a chestnut in its native
setting, and you can buy furniture
polish from the prophet Brownhill
which will keep it always so. It has
its year, like a famous vintage, it has a
silver wind-pipe, and it costs anything
up to fifty guineas.”
“D’ you smoke it 2" asked Jackson,
brutally.
We gave him up. In awful silence
each of us produced his wrappings and
his caskets, extracted the shining briar,
smeared it with cosmetics, and polished
it more reverently than a peace-time
Guardsman polishes his buttons when
warned for duty next day at “Buck.”
And Jackson smoked his pipe in
secret. He would take no leaf from
the book of the Sassenachs.
And the War went on.
:: . ::: * ::: ::: :::
Jackson went on leave. To his deep
disgust he had to wait a few hours in
London on his way to more civilised
parts, and fate led him idling to
Brownhill's. He flattened his Celtic
nose on the window and stared fascin-
ated at the array of super-pipes dis-
played there. After a furtive glance
along the street he crept into the tem-
ple. A white-coated priest met him.
“I—I'm wantin'—a—a pipe,” said
Jackson. He saw the priest reel and
turn pale to the lips. “I should say
a—a Brownhill,” he added hastily.
The other man gulped, steadied himself
with an effort, and gave a ghastly smile.
If you had walked into a temple at
Thibet and planked down sixpence and
asked for an idol wrapped up in brown
paper you could not have done a more
dreadful thing than Jackson had done;
but the priest forgave him and pro-
duced in silence a trayful of Brownhills.
Then was Jackson like unto ELIA's
little Chinese boy with “the crackling.”
He touched a briar and was converted.
He stroked them as though they were
kittens, bought ten of them, a pound
of polish, fifty silver wind-pipes and a
bale of chamois-leather. The priest
took a deep breath.
“You are a full-blooded man, Sir,”
said he, “if you will excuse me saying
so, and you should smoke in your new
Brownhills a mixture which has a pro-
portion of Latakia to Virginian of one
to nineteen—a small percentage of
glycerine and cucumber being added
because you have red hair, and the whole
submitted to a pressure of eighteen
hundred foot-pounds to the square
millimetre, under violet rays. This
will be known as ‘Your Mixture,’
Number 567851''", and will be supplied
to no one else on earth, except under
penalty of death.”
“I will take a ton,” said Jackson
with glazing eyes.
This was a man after the priest's own
heart. He took another deep breath
and dived into the strong-room. He
returned under the escort of ten armed
men, each of them chained by the wrist
to an iron box, which he unlocked with
difficulty. Inside the iron box was a
thing which Jackson a few months
ago would have called a pipe. He
knew better now. In awful silence
the priest lifted it from its satin bed.
* This,” he whispered, “was once
smoked by Brownhill himself.”
Jackson put out a hand to take it.
The priest hesitated, then laid it gently
on his customer's palm.
And Jackson dropped it.
Jackson has never been heard of
since.

A STUDY IN SYMMETRY. o exists, and no matter who is the owner
THE following story, however im-
probable it may seem to you, is true.
Once upon a time there was an artist
with historical leanings not unassoci-
ated with the desire for pelf—pelf being,
even to idealists, what petrol is to a
car. The blend brought him one day
to Portsmouth, where the Victory lies,
with the honourable purpose of paint-
ing a picture of that famous ship with
NELSoN on board. What the ADMIRAL
was doing I cannot say—most probably
dying—but the artist's intention was
to make the work as attractive -
as might be and thus draw a
little profit from the wave of
naval enthusiasm which was
then passing over the country;
for not only was the picture
itself to be saleable, but repro-
ductions were to be made of it.
Permission having been ob-
tained from the authorities,
the artist boarded the Victory,
set up his easel on her deck
and settled down to his task,
the monotony of which was
pleasantly alleviated by the
chatter of the old salts who
guard the ship and act as
guides to the tourists who
visit her. All of these estimable
men not only possessing views
on art, but having come by
now to the firm belief that
they had fought with NEL-
soN, their criticisms were not
too easily combated and the
artist hadn't a tedious moment.
Thus, painting, conversing and
learning (as one can learn only
from a trained imparter of i.
formation), three or four days
passed quickly away and the
picture was done.
Sofar there has been nothing
—has there?—to strain cre-
of countenances with two eyes, a nose
in the middle and a mouth below it,
some difference exists in each. That
is, as I say, among contemporaries: in
the world at this moment in which I
am speaking. But,” he continued,
warming to his subject, for, as you
will have already gathered, he was
not one of the taciturn brush-brother-
hood, “after the lapse of years I see no
reason why nature should not begin
precisely to reproduce physiognomies
and so save herself the trouble of for
ever diversifying them. That being so

Vendor. “ALL THE or FICIAL '91.IDAY FUN. FLY THE PATRIOTIC have all the accessories and
RITES AND ANNOY THE GOTHAS "
dulity. No. But a time will
come—is, in fact, upon us.
On the evening of the last day, as
the artist was sitting at early dinner
with a friend before catching the
London train, his remarks turned (as
an artist's sometimes will) upon the
work upon which he had just been
engaged. He expressed satisfaction
with it in the main, but could not, he
said, help feeling that its chances of
becoming a real success would be
sensibly increased if he could find as
a model for the central figure some one
whose resemblance to NELSON was
noticeable.
“There are, of course,” he went on,
“at the same time—that is to say,
among contemporaries—no two faces
—and surely the hypothesis is not too
far-fetched”—here his friend said, “No,
not at all—oh no "-" why,” the artist
continued, “should there not be at
this moment, more than a century later,
some one whose resemblance to NELSoN
is exact 2 He would not be necessarily
a naval man—probably, indeed, not,
for NELSON's face was not characteristic
of the sea—but whoever he was, even
if he were an archbishop, I,” said the
painter firmly, “should not hesitate to
go up to him and ask him to sit to me.”
The friend agreed that this was a
very proper attitude and that it be-
tokened true sincerity of purpose.
“NELSON's face,” the painter con-
tinued, “was an uncommon one. So
exactly alike. That is an axiom. Strange large and so mobile a mouth is rare.
of it, even were he an archbishop, I
should not hesitate to go up and ask
him to sit to me.”
(For the benefit of any feminine reader
of this veracious history I should say
that the repetition which she has just
noticed is not an accident, but has been
carefully set down. It is an attempt to
give verisimilitude to the conversa-
tion—because men always say things
like that twice.) -
The friend again remarked that the
painter's resolve did him infinite credit,
-- and the two started for the
station, still conversing on the
same theme.
On entering their carriage
the first thing to take their
attention was a quiet little
man in black, who was the
absolute double of the hero of
|Trafalgar.
“Good gracious!” whis-
pered the painter excitedly,
“do you see that? There's
the very man. The likeness
to NELSON is astonishing. I
never saw anything, like it.
I don't care who he is, I
must tackle him. It's the
most extraordinary chance
that ever occurred.”
Assuming his most silky
and deferential manner—for,
though clearly not an arch-
bishop, unless in mufti, this
might yet be a person of im-
|portance — the painter ap-
|proached the stranger and
tendered a card.
“I trust, Sir, that you will
excuse me,” he began, “for
the liberty I am taking, but
I am an artist and I happen
to be engaged on a picture
of NELsoN on the Victory. I
__ so forth, but what I very
seriously need is a brief sitting from
some gentleman with a likeness to the
great little Admiral. Such, Sir, as
yourself. It may be news to you—it
probably is—but you, Sir, if I may
say so, are so like the famous and
immortal warrior as almost to take
one's breath away. It is astonishing,
wonderful! Might I—would it be—
could you—would you, Sir, be so very
kind as to allow me to paint you? I
would, of course, make every effort not
to inconvenience you—I would arrange
so that your time should be mine.”
“Of course I will, guvnor,” said
the man. “I'm a professional model
and I've been sitting for NELsoN for
years. Why, I've been doing it for an
artist this very afternoon.”

word. I call them simply overwhelming—the steam-rollers
of the vegetable world. Look at their great yellow open
faces.”
“I never,” said Francesca, “ saw a steam-roller with a
face. You're mixing your metaphors.”
“And,” I said, “I shall go on mixing them as long as
you grow sunflowers. It's the very least a man can do by
way of protest.” -
“I don't know why you should want to protest.
secd makes very good chicken-food.”
“Yes, I know,” I said, “that's what you always said.”
“And I bet,” she said, “you've repeated it. When
you've met the tame Generals and Colonels at your club,
and they've boasted to you about their potatoes, I know
you've countered them with the story of how you've turned
the whole of your lawn into a bed of sunflowers calculated
to drive the most obstinate hen into laying two eggs a day,
rain or shine.” -
“I admit,” I said, “that I may have mentioned the
matter casually, but I never thought the things were going
to be like this. When I first knew them and talked about
them they were tender little shoots of green just modestly
showing above the ground, and now they're a forest
primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlock aren't
in it with this impenetrable jungle liberally blotched with
yellow, this so-called sunflower patch.”
“What would you call it,” she said, “if you didn't call
it sunflower 2'' -
“I should call it a beast of prey,” I said. “A sunflower
seems to me to be more like a tiger than anything else.”
“It was a steam-roller about a minute ago.”
“Yes,” I said, “it was—a tigerish steam-roller.”
“How interesting,” she said. “I have not met one quite
like that.”
“That,” I said, “is because your eye isn't properly
poetical. It's blocked with chicken-food and other utili-
tarian objects.” -
“I must,” she said, “consult an oculist. Perhaps he will
give me glasses which will unblock my eye and make me
see tigers in the garden.” -
“No,” I said, “you will have to do it for yourself. For
such an eye as yours even the best oculists are unavailing.”
“I might,” she said, “improve if I read poetry at home.
Has any poet written about sunflowers?”
“Yes,” I said, “BLAKE did. He was quite mad, and he
wrote a poem to a sunflower: "Ah! Sunflower! Weary of
time.' That's how it begins.”
“Weary of time !” she said scornfully. “That's no good
to me. I'm weary of having no time at all to myself.”
“That shows,” I said, “that you're not a sunflower.”
“Thank heaven for that,” she said. “It's enough to
have four children to look after—five including yourself.”
“My dear Francesca,” I said, “how charming you are
to count me as a child ! I shall really begin to feel as if
there were golden threads among the silver.”
“Tut-tut,” she said, “you're not so grey as all that.”
“Yes, I am,” I said, “quite as grey as all that and much
greyer; only we don't talk about it."
“But we do talk about sunflowers,” she said, “don’t we ?”
“If you'll promise to have the beastly glaring things
dug up x 1.

“Not,” she said, “before we've extracted from them
their last pip of chicken-food.”
“Well, anyhow,” I said, “as soon as possible. If you'll
promise to do that I'll promise never to mention them
again.” -
“But you'll lose your reputation with the Generals and
Colonels.”
“I don't mind that,” I said, “if I can only rid the garden
of their detested presence.”
“My golden-threaded boy,” said Francesca, “it shall be
as you desire.” R. C. L.
CONSTABLE JINKS.
OUR village policeman is tall and well-grown,
He stands six feet two and he weighs sixteen stone;
His gait is majestic, his visage serene,
And his boots are the biggest that ever I've seen.
Fame sealed his renown with a definite stamp
When two German waiters escaped from a camp.
Unaided he captured those runaway Huns
Who had lived for a week on three half-penny buns.
When a derelict porpoise was cast on the shore
Our village policeman was much to the fore;
He measured the beast from its tip to its tail,
And blandly pronounced it “an undersized whale.”
When a small boy was flying his kite on the links
It was promptly impounded by Constable Jinks,
Who astutely remarked that it might have been seen
By the vigilant crew of a Hun submarine.
It is sometimes alleged that great valour he showed
When he chased a mad cow for three miles on the road; .
But there's also another account of the hunt
With a four-legged pursuer, a biped in front.
If your house has been robbed and his counsel you seek
He's sure to look in-in the course of the week,
When his massive appearance will comfort your cook,
Though he fails in the bringing of culprits to book.
His obiter dicta on life and the law
Set our ribald young folk in a frequent guffaw;
But the elders repose an implicit belief
In so splendid a product of beer and of beef.
He's the strongest and solidest man in the place,
Nothing—short of mad cattle—can quicken his pace;
His moustache would do credit to any dragoon,
And his voice is as deep as a double bassoon.
His complexion is perfect, his uniform neat,
He rivets all eyes as he stalks down the street;
And I doubt if his critics will ever complain
Of his being a little deficient in brain.
For he's more than a man; he's a part of the map;
His going would cause a deplorable gap;
And the village would suffer as heavy a slump
As it would from the loss of the old parish pump.
A Happy Juxtaposition.

THE TRENCH CODE.
AH ! with what awe, what infantile impatience,
We eyed the artifice when issued out,
And racked our brains about the Regulations,
And tried to think we had them free from doubt
As Rome's old Fathers, reverently leaning
In secret cellars o'er the Sibyl's strain,
Beyond the fact that several pars
Had something vague to do with Mars,
Failed, as a rule, to find the smallest meaning,
But told the plebs the oracle was plain.
So did we study it, ourselves deceiving,
In hope to say, “We have no rations here,”
Or, “Please, Brigade, this regiment wants relieving,”
And “Thank you for the bombs—but why no beer?”
And wondered always, with a hint of presage,
Since never word emerged as it was planned,
If it was Hermes, Lord of Craft,
Compiled the code, or someone daft,
So that no mortal could compose a message
Which anybody else could understand.
Too soon the Staff, to spoil our tiny slumbers,
Or, as they said, to certify our skill,
Sent us a screed, all signs and magic numbers,
And what it signified is mystery still.
We flung them back a message yet more mazy
To say we weren't unravelling their own,
And marked it urgent, and designed
- That it should reach them while they dined.
All night they toiled, till half the crowd were crazy
And bade us breathe its burthen o'er the 'phone.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DAUGHTER OF THE BACK STEPPES.
(Russia may not yet be quite sufficiently herself to be the
martial ally that we could desire, but she still continues
to send us the most delightful fiction. Mr. PUNCH is
privileged in being able to offer his readers the opening of
a new and fascinating story translated from the Russian
of Ghastlikoff.)
I was born in the year 18–, and I have never ceased to
regret it. I lived with my grandmother. She was called
Natasha. I do not know why. She had a large mole on
her left cheek. Often she would embrace me with tears
and lament over me, crying, “My little sad one, my little
lonely one !” Yet I was not sad ; I had too many griefs.
Nor was I lonely, for I had no playmates.
Often my grandmother told me I was ugly. I had no
mirror, so I believed her. When I was sixteen a man I
met in the street went mad for love of me and cut his
throat. For the first time in my life I wondered if my
grandmother always spoke the truth. I went home and
wept, but when she asked me why I could not tell her.
Our house was quite dark. It had three rooms leading
in and out of one another, and no windows. There was
not much fresh air. Every morning my grandmother went
out to buy otchkza and pickled onions. The man who sold
them was very old. He had a cast in each eye. He
inquired of my grandmother if she would allow him to be
my husband, but she refused. II is name I do not
remember. -
Our neighbours were very pleasant people, kindly and
simple. There was a half-witted youth called Krop. He
used to fill his mouth with large brass-headed nails. I did
not dare to go near him, for he always tried to bite my
arms. One day I learned that he had died. My grand-
mother bought me black silk mittens to wear at his funeral.
I was very proud, and ran out into the road to show them
to the other children. But in my haste I split then across
from seam to seam, and my grandmother whipped me and
put me to bed.
My grandmother's chief friend was a woman who sold
toasted cheese. It was her custom to bring round the
delicacy on a small hand-cart and sell to the children for a
few kopecks. This woman was reputed to be very rich.
She was not beautiful, for she had no teeth, and had hair
on her face. The first time I saw her I ran into the house
and hid behind the large barrel of butter-milk. My grand-
mother took me by the ear and led me to her friend.
“This is Ilonoka,” she said. “She is a good girl.”
I remember that I cried very loud.
Afterwards my grandmother told me that perhaps the
woman would leave me all her money. Next time she
came I wished to speak to her, but unfortunately I had a
quinsy. When the woman eventually died it was dis-
covered that she had been destitute for a long time. She
left her hand-cart by will to my grandmother, and in her
disappointment my grandmother beat me over the head
with it. Soon afterwards my hair began to come out, and
my grandmother said it was time I found a husband.
Accordingly she went next door, where lived a woman
with five sons. They were all out except one, and he had
a sore leg. She brought him to me, and I cried very
bitterly. He also. His name was Ivan, and I wished it
had been Peter.
The next day we were betrothed, and all our friends came
to eat the feast that my grandínother provided. A school-
fellow of mine, a very beautiful girl, was angry because I
had a husband and not she. She scratched my face, and
the blood ran on to my dress. Our friends congratulated
us, and when they had gone my grandmother said it had been
a great success. She and I finished what was left of the
feast and went to bed. I remember that my feet were
very cold, and when I fell asleep I dreamed that my
betrothed's name was Peter. When I awoke I cried very
loud, and my grandmother slapped my cheeks.
Shortly afterwards she died, and I went to live with my
uncle, who was a pawnbroker in Moscow.
THE LONG-FACED CHUMS.
WHEN ALEXANDER won the world he knew not bombs nor
guns,
His simple forms of frightfulness were quite unlike the
Huns';
'Twas not" by barking mortars that the pushful C.ESAR
scored ;
He trusted close formations and the silent stabbing sword.
When Rol.AND's rearguard turned at bay, and from the
furious press
The scuppered Paladin sent forth his famous S.O.S.,
Scared Roncesvalles rang loud with war, as misty legends
tell, -
But echo's ear was spared the shriek and crash of bursting
shell.
o could you meet the shades of those whose prowess made
Romance,
You'd find them only puzzled by your tales of stunts in
France;
You'd have to cut the business out, and be content to chat
Of rations, grub, and officers—such odds and ends as that,
S
º
Unless you chanced to entertain some true rough-rider's
ghost,
Who galloped after HANNIBAL, or with the Parthian host,
Some curled Assyrian prince who pranced, bareback, along
a frieze—
Or one of RUPERT's beaux sabreurs—a horseman—whom
you please.
With chosen spirits such as those your talk need never end
If you are worthy of your spurs and count a horse your
friend.
Just ask them “Did you clip trace-high 2" or “Did you
chaff your hay?”
Or boast about the gee you ride, and they'll have lots to say.
Cut out the talk of battle's din, of whizz-bangs and of
crumps,
Of bombs and gas and hand-grenades, of mines and blazing
dumps;
If you would wake their sympathy and warm their hearts
indeed
Describe a Squadron watering, and then the fuss at “Feed!”
That lively bustle has a charm to wake a mummy's ear
Who, ere the Pyramids were planned, was mustered
charioteer;
And many a horseman's spirit thrills by Lethe's drowsy
brink
When in a strange, familiar dream his Troop comes down
to drink!
From “The Story of the Haldane Missions”:—
“The Kaiser laughingly remarked that he had better have the high
chair (in which the Kaiser usually sat at his council meetings).
He also gave Lord Haldane an Imperial cigar. . . . While discussing
the naval question, the Kaiser took a copy of the new Naval Bill out
of his pocket and handed it to Lord Haldane, who transferred it to
his pocket without looking at it.”—Daily Chronicle.
He probably thought it was another of the Imperial cigars.

A STRAIGHT TALK WITH II.G.
(Everyone has views as to how to win
the War, but not all are vocal, or—
shall we say 2—vociferous. If Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE reads all the papers
(as their Editors of course expect him
to do) he cannot have missed quite
a number of powerful articles in the
following manner. And even if he
should miss one or two it would not
matter, because there is always an-
other in preparation.)
I've always said that the PREMIER
shouldn't be bothered with Parliament.
Of course I've said too that our old
friend Demos, the new god, should
have a say in affairs; but that's an
inconsistency that doesn't count in the
least, does it?
Now then, Mr. PREMIER, you've got
the chance of your lifetime. I always
said you were a lucky devil—in fact, I
never met the Welshman that wasn't.
You see, Parliament's in recess, and
all its trivial overpaid Members are
playing golf and things. You've got
absolutely a free hand if only you'll take
it. It's quite easy and bound to succeed.
You've only got to do as I tell you.
For instance, you want to buck up
HAIG and the people at the Front.
It's no use them telling you they know
best, being on the spot. That's only
bluff, old man. Don't take any notice
of them, but just order a big general
offensive; and before you can say Jack
Robinson we'll have the Huns behind
the Rhine.
And do tell the Navy to get a move
on. I'm glad to see my articles have
made you change the heads at the
Admiralty; and of course that's all
very well so far as it goes. But it
doesn't go far enough. Have a chat
with BEATTY about it. Get him to
root the Huns out. He can bom-
bard Qstend and Zeebrugge and all
those funny little places in two-twos.
Tell KING ALBERT not to mind. We'll
easily slap up new towns for him after
the War, built on the speedy American
principle.
Then about that aerial offensive.
There's really been quite enough talk
about it. We want some action, Mr.
PREMIER. Isn't it time it came off 2
Think what a bombardment of Cologne
(taking care of the cathedral, of course),
Frankfurt, Berlin, Essen and Hamburg
would do, not to mention other places
that I could if I had an atlas.
And about those pacifists. Just clap
the whole lot in gaol. That's the best
place for them. I won't object in the
least, even though I am the apostle of
freedom. -
Then there are lots and lots of other
things you might do. You might
deliver a reasoned manifesto to the
Russian people and buck them up a
bit. That won't do anybody any harm,
my little Welshman. ^
Well, there are a few points for you
to go on with. You've got the brains
to think of more, otherwise I wouldn't
have helped to put you where you are
to-day. But remember that if you don't
do these things Demos is waiting round
the corner for you.
Demos is a good dog—a patient
animal. But there's an end even to
his patience. Growl, Demos, and show
you're not afraid of Welshmen'
(“Grrr —!” Good dog!
dog'
Now then, old boy, I've shown you
the way. It's up to you !

and the odd.
“That reminds me,” he said, “ of a
most extraordinary experience I had a
few days ago. Of course you all know

None of us knew Enderby, but we
did not like to say so. The quiet man's
anxiety was painful. We felt he could
were growing rather tired of marrows, not go on with his story unless someone
but we waited eagerly for his answer.
“Twenty-six pounds nine and three-
quarter ounces.”
Disappointment, again. Our hopes
were dashed to the ground. Some ob-
scure individual, according to the local
press, had produced from his humble
cottage garden a marrow weighing
thirty-four pounds, and the thing
rankled.
“Mine was a scraggy specimen, more
like an Indian club than a marrow.”
“Crossed in love, perhaps,” said
Dalton.
“What your marrow wanted was
nourishment,” said the Authority. “A
piece of worsted round its neck, with
knew Enderby.
“He has a little place round at º
back of the Common—quite a nice little
place.” Freath—that was the quiet
man's name—looked at us reproach-
fully.
“I think I know Enderby,” said
Dalton. “Isn't he a heavily-built man
about fifty, with a grey moustache”
“Yes, yes,” said Freath eagerly.
“And a curious wart on his left cheek.
Well, I dined with him the other night.
His boy was there, home for the holi-
days. Very clever boy; his special
study is the biology of plants. They
gave me a very good dinner; I didn't
notice very much what I was eating,
one end dipped in a jar of water.”
“Excuse me,” said Jones, “the very
latest is to insert a tube in the stalk,
and the flavour is greatly improved if
you add a little sugar to the water.
Almost like a melon.”
“Do you take a card out for each
marrow, or one for each plant’ ” asked
Dalton.
The quiet man opposite put his paper
down. He was a new-comer in the
district. We liked him, although he
had no sense of humour and did not
appreciate Dalton's jokes. He appeared
but I did when the maid helped me to
marrow. It was a deep crimson colour.
I tasted it somewhat nervously, for I
felt they were all watching me. It had
the taste of the most exquisite fruit,
and the flavour—I am afraid you won't
believe me—was that of the finest port
that I ever drank. ‘How did you
manage this, Arthur 2' said Enderby.
| Grape - juice,' said Arthur. “Those
foreign black grapes are very cheap
just now, so I mixed some with the
water that I was feeding the marrows
on.' I can't explain it to you; all I
know is that I had a second helping.
I am afraid you don't believe it,” said
Freath uneasily.
We assured him that we did, but we
did not say it with conviction.
“Enderby called round to see me a
few days afterwards,” continued Freath,
“and I walked back with him. As we
went along he told me that a relative
was staying with them—an uncle. The
first night, again they had marrow
for dinner. This time its flavour was
not port but whisky—Scotch whisky.
The old gentleman was delighted with
Arthur and his experiments. Although
an abstainer he had three helpings.
This was very pleasing to Enderby, as
the uncle was a man of considerable
wealth. But he was not at all satisfied
with his son's explanations, and he
thought he recognised the whisky.
Although an abstainer while the War
is on, Enderby keeps a very good cellar,
and when he came to look into things
he found that Arthur had been pump-
ing his finest '60 port and old matured
Scotch whisky into the vegetable mar-
rows. Now what do you think of
that 2 ''
We thought it very strange and we
said so.
“But the strangest part has yet to
come. Of course they had to keep it
quiet—bottle it up, so to speak, from
the old gentleman, and let the marrows
down gradually. But when the mar-
rows were once more on a temperance
régime the most extraordinary thing
happened.” The train was running
into Finsbury Park. Freath rose and
collected his things.

We stared at him, fascinated.
“Enderby took me into the garden
to see it. He said it had been going
on for the last week. From all direc-
tions, rioting across the flower-beds,
the lawn, down the paths, the marrows
were growing towards the wine-cellar
at the rate of twelve feet a day.”
Ereath hastily left the carriage and
jumped into the Broad Street train.
While we were discussing the story
the voice of authority spoke: “The
whole thing's a tissue of falsehood.
There's no such man as Enderby.”
“But Dalton knows him,” we said.
“I don't know Enderby,” said Dalton.
“But I wanted to hear the story.”
AT THE PLAY.
“THE PACIFISTs.”
As a reasonable jusquaboutist I have
some misgivings about Mr. HENRY
ARTHUR Jon Es's farce - parable, The
Pacifists. Assume Market Pewbury's
afflictions to have been as stated: an
intolerable stalwart cad of a butcher
fencing-in the best part of the common,
assaulting people's grandmothers, shut-
ting them up in coal-cellars and eating
their crumpets, kissing their wives in
the market square and proposing to
abduct them to seaside resorts, and
none so bold to do him violence and
make him stop it; the police being ill
or absent, the Mayor and his friend,
chief victim of the butcher's aggression,
unwilling on account of principles to
do anything but talk and get up leagues
to deal with the trouble in general, and
in a final ecstasy of disapproval to write
a strong letter; only uncle Belcher, a
truculent old sea-dog with a natural
lust for whisky and blood, organising
an opposition, valiantly hiring a notable
pugilist to deal with the butcher, and
becoming desperately anxious lest the
matter should be peaceably settled be-
cause the basher, having been engaged,
must find something to bash or there
will be trouble. Well, if we must have
forged for us the sword of a three-Act
parable, we should like it with one edge,
not two.
Mr. Jones was evidently bursting
with the desire to give some irritating
people a very hard knock—witness the
barbéd dedication with which the nor-
mally peaceful theatre-announcement
columns have bristled some little time
past; and I think I dare say that we
were interested in his first Act. He
did really work out his analogies with
some skill. But we soon came to feel
that he was essentially doing something
between flogging a dead horse, so far as
we were concerned, and shooting a
sitting rabbit. I suspect too that we
realised the issues were too tragic for
Sergeant (to Private Simpkins arriving two days late). “WELL, SIMPRINs, so You've
TURNED UP, HAVE You?”
Simpkins. “YES, SERGEANT. BUT You ARE LUCKY To GET ME. WHAT witH DomesTic

this kind of buffoonery. The tribute of
our applause was a tribute of loyalty to
one who has often deserved well of the
republic, and partly the desire to show
that our hearts were in the right place.
I don't see The Pacifists as a pamphlet
making many converts. As a kick on
the shins it has points.
I confess the thing that pleased me
most was a gay little piece of bur-
lesque by Mr. ARTHUR CHESNEY as the
red-haired shop assistant who was not
a pacifist. Mr. CHARLEs GLENNEY so
thoroughly enjoyed the robustious sea-
captain that we had to enjoy it too—a
sound notion of entertainment, that.
Mr. SEBASTIAN SMITH played chief rab-
bit with considerable skill and point;
LIVESEY's offensive was, I am sure, as
Hunnish as its author could possibly
have desired. Miss ELLIs JEFFREYs ap-
peared in the first Act as a very plausible
imitation of a prominent tradesman's
wife in an eighth-rate provincial town,
with some quite excellent moments.
But she was evidently labouring under
severe strain, and I amused myself by
speculating how long she would keep
out of a really well-cut skirt and a
sophisticated air of Mayfair. Just an
Act. And surely she is mistaken in
thinking that an effect of extreme agita-
tion is best conveyed by very rapid quasi-
cinematographic progression up and
down the stage 2 But I saw no reason
to complain of the bold bad butcher's

BUCEPHALUS AND THE ROAD-HOGS.
WHEN Miss Ropes asked at breakfast how many of us
would like to watch the very last cricket-match of the
season at Lumsdale, practically the entire hospital held up
its hand, and it was found that the two cars could not
accommodate us all. It was therefore settled that Haynes
(who said he knew the moves) should drive Ansell and me
over in the governess-cart.
It was also settled that the crew of the governess-cart
should have an early cold lunch and start an hour before
the cars; thus (it was calculated) we should all arrive at the
cricket-ground fairly well together. This did not take
Haynes' driving into account. We started from the door
at a very satisfactory pace, probably because Bucephalus,
the fat pony, objected to the enthusiasm of our send-off.
When we reached the road he dropped into an amble so
gentle that we decided that he had really been running
away in the drive. Next, taking advantage of an almost
imperceptible upward slope, he began to walk. Haynes
clucked at him and flapped the reins, but this had no effect
beyond steering Bucephalus into the left-hand ditch.
“I thought you said you knew the moves,” remarked
Ansell. “Surely this is wrong?”
“The bally beast's lopsided,” said Haynes with heat.
“One side of his mouth's hard and the other soft.”
“The difficulty being,” I suggested as we lurched across
the road into the other ditch, “to discover which is
which. . . . Now you're straight. We'd better trot.
It's only a one-day match.”
Haynes used the ancient whip, which had as much
effect as tickling a rhinoceros with a feather.
“Goad him with a penknife,” suggested Ansell unfeel-
singly.
# i.e., must be some way,” said Haynes.
they do trot, you know.” -
“Speaking as one ignorant amateur to another,” I asked,
“isn't the right thing to pull gently on the reins and
then slacken 2 You go on doing it till the animal gets your
meaning. Try it.”
Haynes tried it, and Bucephalus stopped dead. Repe-
tition of the treatment simply produced a tendency to
back.
“For heaven's sake don't lose any of the ground we've
gained,” said Ansell. “Let's get on, if only at a walk.”
“We shall have to tow him,” decided Haynes. He got
out and hauled at the bridle, but Bucephalus refused to
budge. - -
“This,” said Ansell, becoming suddenly business-like,
“is where the Boy Hero modestly but firmly takes charge.
Jump in.” -
He picked up the reins and, though he apparently did
nothing in particular with them, Bucephalus came to life
at once and broke into a lumbering trot.
“You silly chump, why didn't you say you could drive?”
asked Haynes.
“Nobody asked me," said the Boy Hero modestly, “and
I was shy.” -
At the time when we had been scheduled to reach the
cricket-ground we had still a mile to go along a narrow.
leaſy road, hardly more than a lane. The cars were over-
due, and Haynes, whose haughty spirit could not brook
the idea of being passed by jeering plutocrats, propounded
a scheme.
“They can't pass us unless we go into the ditch,” he
explained. “So, when they come we'll pretend to be
asleep, take up the middle of the road, and simply ignore
them. We'll get there first, after all.”
A moment later we heard the buzz of engines.

a hurried glance round and saw the sunlight on brasswork
as the car came round a distant corner. -
“It’s them,” I said.
The reins dropped slackly on Bucephalus's back and he
slowed to a walk. Inside the governess-cart all was som-
nolent peace. Behind us the car was already beginning
to make remarks on one of those abusive press-the-button
horns. “You Fool, You Fool, I Get out o' the way!
Get out o' the way !” it said. Then we heard the car slow
down and pandemonium broke loose. The horn was
reinforced by an ordinary hooter, a whistle, several human
voices and, lastly, an exhaust siren. I stole a glance at
Ansell and found that he was having a good deal of surrep-
titious trouble in restraining our fiery steed from doing a
second bolt.
“I say,” whispered Haynes in sudden agitation, “has
Miss Ropes an exhaust siren 2" -
“No, she hasn't,” Ansell replied in tones of horror.
“We've held up the wrong car.” He looked round.
“Good Lord!” he added softly and pulled Bucephalus into
the ditch. In the car, with a grinning Tommy at the
wheel, sat two apoplectic generals and a highly explosive
brigade-major. They came alongside, and I should never
be allowed to repeat what they said to us. It seemed that
by delaying them we had been hindering the day's work
of the entire Home Forces. We were given to understand
that it was only the blue bands on our arms which saved us
from being court-martialled on the spot and shot by the
Then they passed on.
When our cars did appear a minute or two later we
pulled meekly into the ditch to let them pass, and could
find no better answer to the jeers of their occupants than
a wan sickly smile apiece. .

There's not a day that passes but one reads—
Sandwiched between unprofitable “pars”
And other wholly negligible screeds—
Of decorations, crosses, medals, bars,
Bestowed for valiant and heroic deeds;
Over these records we must often pass
Unless we've got a magnifying-glass'

largest fish of its kind landed
from this Suffolk stream for
some years.”
But if some member of a fishing club
In London or the provinces, renowned
For prowess with the lob-worm or the grub,
Should land a roach of more than half a pound,
Then in the leading papers of the hub
Full space for that achievement will be found,
And clearest type and unaffected rapture
Will signalize the epoch-making capturel
The moral of the episode is plain:
If soldiers wish to petrify the nation,
Let them—when leave permits—no more disdain
To join a Roach or Perch Association,
Cull giant gooseberries, and strive to gain
Prizes for Blind-fold Pig Delineation.
Thus only—not by cross or golden stripe—
Will they achieve the honour of big type.

UNLESs you can share with me the sad immunity of the
forties, I must despair of translating for you the emotion
raised in my antique soul by the wrapper of a new RIDER
HAGGARD story bearing the picture of a Zulu and the discovery
inside that Quatermain is come again! The tale that has
so excited me is called, a little ominously, Finished (WARD,
Lock), and I could have better loved a cheerier title. The
matter is, to begin with, an affair of a shady doctor, of
I.D.B. and an abduction; none of it, I admit, any too
absorbing. But about lalfway through the author, as
though sharing my own views upon this part of the plot,
exchanges (so to speak) the Shady for the Black, and
transports us all to Zululand. And if you need reminding
of what H. R. H. can do with that delectable country,
I can only say I am sorry for you. Incidentally there are
some stirring scenes from certain pages of history that the
glare of these later days has rather faded—Isandhlwana
and Rorke's Drift among them; as well as the human
drama of the feud between CETEWAYo (terror of my
nursery !) and the witch-doctor Zikali. Whether the old
careless rapture is altogether recovered is another matter;
at least the jolly unpronounceable names are still there, and
the picturesque speech. Most of the names, that is; Allan
of course, and others, but I for one should have welcomed

company that have so often kept secret rendezvous with
me behind the unlifted lid of a desk at preparation time.
And now have we really come at long last to Finished 2
I can only hope that Sir H. RIDER HAGGARD doesn't
mean it.
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD may be numbered amongst the
most indefatigable of women war-workers. She has now
followed up her former success in England's Effort with
a volume carrying on the story of our part in the War
under the title of Towards the Goal (MURRAY). The book
is written in the form of a series of letters addressed
to ex-President RoosevelT, as, the onlie begetter both of it
and its predecessor. It is further equipped with a preface
by the hand of this same able and clear-sighted gentleman,
the chief drawback of which (from my reviewing point of
view) is that it covers so well the whole ground of apprecia-
tion as to leave me nothing more to add. “Mrs. Ward
writes nobly on a noble theme"—voilà tout ! Her theme,
possibility of a similar confidence in the workshop. That
confidence must, and can, we dare to believe, eventually be
established. But the men don't go over the top to put
money in the Colonel's pocket, and little good is done by
exploiting these loose analogies and putting on a too easy
air of optimism in the face of desperately serious and
complex problems. But enough of fault-finding, which is
a poor reward for the serious and generous labours of public-
spirited men and women. After all, what one reader calls
timidity of outlook another may care to praise as prudence.
Here you will find an abundance of safe analysis, wise
comment and constructive suggestion from a galaxy of
accredited authorities.
In the early chapters of Mr. WILLIAM HEwlFTT's new
story, The Plot-Maker (DUCKworTH), we are introduced to
a popular and highly successful novelist, named Coulthard
Henderson, in the emotional crisis produced by a sudden
doubt as to whether his output of best-sellers represented
as I have hinted, is
a further exposition
of Britain's war acti.
vities as these have
developed since the
former book was
published. In its
course Mrs. WARD
gives us some vivid
experiences of her
own as a visitor to
the Western Front:
things seen and
heard, well calcu-
lated (were this
needed) to stiffen
the resolution of
the great people to
whom her letters are
really written. Eng-

of which it is well worthy.
Mr. WILLIAM HARBUT't DAwson, in his After War Problems
(ALLEN AND UNwiN), covers, under the four headings, Empire
and Citizenship, Natural Efficiency, Social Reform, and
National Finance and Taxation, bewilderingly wide ground,
and drives a perhaps rather mandarinish team of contri-
butors. Lord HALDANE, for instance, is no longer in the
real van of educational endeavour, and is it wholly insigni-
ficant that his chapter on Education appears in the section
headed National Efficiency rather than in that of Social
Reform 2 . It ought not to be difficult to give, in the light
of these last years, a wider interpretation to Patriotism
than that expressed by Lord MEATH on lines familiar to his
public. Sir WILLIAM CHANCE has seen no new sign in the
skies in relation to the problem of poverty. Sir BENJAMIN
BRowNE, whose death all those interested in the settlement
of the Capital-Labour quarrel must deplore, as for all his
uncompromising individualism he brought to it a rare
breadth of view, says much that is of real value, but does
|
not refrain from appealing to the fact that the mutual con-
fidence of man and officer in battle is a proof of the
wards the Goal should certainly receive the same treatment, longing (I fancy) to the late HERBERT FLowerDEw in a too-
little-appreciated masterpiece of sensational burlesque called
The Realist. However, The Plot-Maker, once set going,
develops admirably enough on lines entirely its own. The
so-much-an-hour hero turns out an engaging young gentle-
man, but a wofully poor protagonist. The situation where
(in the midst of whirling events) he makes the startling
discovery that he himself has been in some way switched
on to the part of villain is one that you can appreciate only
at first hand. Certainly if you want (as who does not in
these days?) an anaesthetic of agreeable nonsense The Plot-
Maker is a medium that I can cordially recommend: one
obvious advantage being that you need not try to believe a
single word of it.

OFFICIAL RECTITUDE.
SwedEN ON THE LUXBURG INCIDENT,
WE cannot think that we're to blame.
We took the very natural view
That one who bore a German name
Would be as open as the blue;
Would bathe in sunlight, like a lark,
So different from the worm or weevil,
Those crawling things that love the dark
Because their deeds are evil.
We thought his cables just referred
To harmless matters such as crops,
The timber-market's latest word,
The local fashions in the shops,
To German trade and German bands,
And how in Argentine and Sweden
And all that's left of neutral lands
To build a German Eden.
True he employed a secret code,
But who would guess at guile in that?
Unless he used the cryptic mode
He couldn't be a diplomat;
He wished (we thought) to be discreet,
Telling his friends how frail and fair is
The exotic feminine you meet
In bounteous Buenos Aires.
Why, then, should mud be thrown so
hard
At Stockholm's faith? She merely
meant -
To show a neighbourly regard
| Towards a nice belligerent;
For peaceful massage she was made;
Aloof from martial animosities,
She yearns with fingers gloved in suède
To temper war's callosities.
| Such courtesy (one would have said)
Amid the waste of savage strife
Tends to maintain — what else were
dead—
The sweet amenities of life;
And seeking ends so pure, so good,
So innocent, it does surprise her
To be so much misunderstood
By all—except the KAISER. O. S.

DEAR SIR,--This morning I was reading

‘Charivaria'. I saw an article in which you
proclaimed the North Pole to be the only
territory that has not had its neutrality vio-
lated by the Huns. I beg to draw your atten-

WASHOUT.
WE had hardly settled down to Mess
when an orderly, armed with a buff
slip, shot through the door, narrowly
missed colliding with the soup, and
pulled up by Grigson's chair. Grigson
is our Flight Commander—one of those
rugged and impenetrable individuals
who seem impervious to any kind of
shock. There is a legend that on one
occasion four machine - gun bullets
actually hit him and bounced off, which
gave the imitative Hun the idea of
armour-plating his machines.
Grigson took the slip and read, slowly
and paraphrastically: “Night opera-
tions. A machine will be detailed to leave
the ground at 10.30 pip emma and lay
three fresh eggs on the railway-station
at . At the special request of the
G.O.C.R.F.C., Lieutenant Maude, the
well-known strafer, will oblige. Co-
operation by B and C Flights.”
Lieutenant Maude, commonly known
by a loose a sociation of ideas as
Toddles, buried a heightened complexion
in a plate of now tepid soup. Someone
having pulled him out and wiped him
down, he was understood to remark
that he would have preferred longer
notice, as it had been his intention that
night to achieve a decisive victory in
the Flight ping-pong tournament.
“Oh, but, Toddles,” came a voice,
“think how pleased old Fritz will be to
see you. You'll miss the garden party,
but you'll be in nice time for the fire-
works—Vereylights and flaming onions
and pretty searchlights. Don't you love
searchlights, Toddles?”
Toddles stretched out an ominous
hand towards the siphon, and was
only deterred from his fell intention by
the entry of the C.O. -
“Oh, Grigson,” said the C.O. plea
santly, “the Wing have just rung
through to say they want that raid done
at once, so you might get your man up
toute suite.”
Toddles was exactly halfway through
his fish.
Now, though Toddles has never to
my knowledge appeared before the C.O.
at dead of night attired in pink silk
pyjamas, begging with tears in his eyes
to be allowed to perform those duties
which the dawn would in any case
impose upon him (this practice is not
really very common in the R.F.C.), he
is a thoroughly sound and conscientious
little beggar. And, making allowances
for the fallibility of human inventions,
and the fact that two other young
gentlemen were also engaged in the con-
genial task of making structural altera-
tions to the railway station at r
Toddles comes out of the affair with an
untarnished reputation.
Whether it was that his more fasti-
dious taste in architecture detained him
I do not know, but it was fully ten
minutes after the others had landed
before we who were watching on the
aerodrome became aware that Toddles
was coming home to roost. The usual
signals were exchanged, and Toddles
finished up a graceful descent by making
violent contact with the ground, bounc-
ing seven times and knocking over two
flares before finally coming to rest.
His machine appeared to be leaning on
its left elbow in a slightly intoxicated
condition. -
“Bust the V strut,” said Toddles
cheerfully. We assured him that one
would hardly notice it. Grigson mean-
while had been examining the under
carriage with scientific care, and turned
to ask him how he had got on.
“Bong,” said Toddles, beaming ;
“absolutely bong. They spotted us,
! but Archie was off colour.”
“Did you see your pills burst?”
Toddles beamed more emphatically
than ever. “One in what I took to be
the station yard, one light on the line,
and one O.K. ammunition truck ; ter-
rific explosion—nearly upset me. Three
perſectly good shots.”
So far Toddles' account agreed very
fairly with the two we already had.
“Didn't have any trouble with the
release gear, I suppose?” said Grigson.
“Nasty thing that. I've known it jam
before now.” -
“Well,” answered Toddles, “it did
stick a bit, but I just yanked it over
and it worked.”
“Splendid!” said Grigson brightly.
“A nice bit of work, and very thought-

We all went down on hands and
knees. Lying placidly in the rack with
an air of well-merited ease born of the
consciousness that they had, without
any effort of their own, avoided a
fatiguing duty, were three large bombs.
“Er – ah — hum,” said Toddles.
“Now then, Sergeant, hurry up and
get this machine back into the shed . "
And the Sergeant's face was the best
joke of all.

MY DEAR CHARLEs, I feel some
hesitation in passing the following
story on to you, less from the fear of
what it will divulge to the enemy than
from the fear of what it may divulge to
our own people. As far as the enemy
is concerned be it stated boldly that
the train was going to Paris and “I”
got into it at Amiens. Yes, HINDEN-
BURG, there is a place called Paris and
there is a place called Amiong. Now
what are you going to do about it? As
far as our own people are concerned it
is asked of them that, if ever they come
to read it, they may not inquire too
it would have been unthinkable. But
if it had arisen the train would cer-
tainly have stopped for good; probably
the world would have come to an end.
As it was, what did happen? Let me
say at once that both the Corporal and
the Commandant behaved with a gen-
erosity which was entirely delightſul;
the Corporal's was pecuniary gener-
osity, the Commandant's generosity of
spirit. This was as it should be, and
both were true to type.
Quick though the French are at the
uptake, it took the good Commandant
just a little while to settle down to the
odd position. This was not the size
and shape and manner of man with
whom he was used to take his meals.
talked pleasantly to his vis-à-vis. The
Corporal, a trifle abashed at first,
listened deferentially, but as the good
food enlivened him he ceased to be
abashed and became cordial. From
cordial he became affable, from affable
affectionate, and from affectionate he
passed to that degree of friendship in
which you lean across the dinner-table,
tap a man on the shoulder and call
him “old pal.” Finally, he insisted
upon the Commandant cracking with
him a bottle of champagne. I give
the Commandant full marks for not
persisting in his refusal.
A draught or two of champagne has,
as you may be aware, the effect of
! developing to an extreme any friendly
closely as to who “I”
may be.
It is a long train
and there is only one
dining - car. Those
who don't get into the
car at Amiens don't
dine; there is accord-
ingly some competi-
tion, especially on the
part of the military
element, of which the
majority is proceed-
ing to Paris on leave
and doesn't propose to
start its outing by go-
ing without its dinner.
Only the very fit or
the very cunning sur-
vive. Having got in
myself among the lat-
ter category I was not
surprised to see,
among the former
category, a large and
powerful Canadian

feelings you may at
the moment happen
to possess . . .
The train chanced to
stop just after dinner
was finished, and the
Commandant, seizing
his opportunity, hur-
riedly paid his bill and
got into another car-
riage. My vis-à-vis
also left the car,
though I must confess
that I had not stood
him so much as a
glass of beer. I and
the Canadian Cor-
poral were left facing
each other, and the
position was such that
I couldn't avoid his
eye. I had no feel-
ings with regard to
him, but I simply
could not smile at
him, since I do not
Corporal.
If he can afford to pay for his dinner
there is no reason, I suppose, why even
a corporal should not dine. If he can
manage to snaffle a seat in the car there
is certainly no reason why a French
Commandant should not dine. There
is every reason, I imagine, for railway
companies to furnish their dining-cars
with those little tables for two which
bring it about that a pair of passen-
gers, who have never seen each other
before and have not elected to meet on
this occasion, find themselves together,
for a period, on the terms of the most
complete and homely intimacy. Lastly,
the attendant had every reason to put
the Corporal and the Commandant to
dine together, for there was nowhere
else to put either of them.
What would have happened if this
had taken place ten years ago, and the
French Commandant had been an
English Major 2 The situation, of
course, simply could not have arisen;
|As an officer one feels one's respon-
|sibilities on these public occasions, and
I felt I ought to intervene and to do
|something to rearrange the general
position. But at the start I caught
the Corporal's eye, and there was in it
such a convincing look of “Whatever
I may do I mean awfully well,” that I
|just sat still and did nothing.
The awkward pause was over before
the soup was finished. Rough good-
nature and subtle good sense soon com-
|bined to eliminate arbitrary distinc-
tions. The Commandant won the first
|credit by starting a conversation; it
was really the only thing to do. Had
the Commandant and I been opposite
each other we should probably have
|. in polite silence. But the Cor-
poral was one of those red-faced burly
people with whom you have, if you are
| close to them, either to laugh or fight.
The Commandant was not inwardly
afraid; he was innately polite. He
— like champagne. So
I suppose I must have frowned at him ;
anyhow, he came along and sat down
at my table in order to explain at
length that he was not drunk.
He wasn't drunk, and I had never
said he was, and I was not in the least
interested in his theme, until he got to
the point of what his main reason was
for not being drunk. This, I admit,
interested me deeply. “When we get
to Parry,” said he, “we shall be met by
Military Police, and they will ask to see
our papers. And if my papers weren't
in order and if I wasn't in order myself
I should be put under arrest and sent
back again. And I don't mean to be
sent back, and I have all my papers in
order and I'm in order myself.” And,
dash it all, the fellow was right, and ||
when we got to the Gare du Nord there
were the Military Police as large as
life, and clearly there was no avoiding
them.
At first I didn't quite know what to

do about it, but a little thought decided
me. “There are your M.P.,” I said to
the Corporal, as we trooped slowly out
of the dining-car. “I'm afraid I'll
have to ask you to come along with me
and interview one of them.” Giving
him no time to argue, I led him straight
to the Police Sergeant and insisted
upon this case being dealt with before
all others. “I must ask you, Sergeant,
to make this man produce his papers.
I have reason to doubt whether he is
in order.”
The Corporal began to expostulate,
but the Sergeant adopted the none-of-
that-I-know-all-about-your-sort atti-
tude which is so admirable in these
officials. The Corporal produced some
papers and tendered them indignantly.
The Police Sergeant remained impas-
sively unconvinced, but gave me one
fleeting look, as if he wondered whether
I had put him on to a good thing.
“There are papers and papers,” said I,
as if I too knew all about the busi-
ness. “Let us see if they are in order.”
The Sergeant's instinct had already told
him that the papers were quite in order,
and he was all for cutting the business
short and getting out of it as quickly
as he could.
But I insisted upon the
l
most minute examination and would
not give in and admit my mistake
until the Sergeant practically ordered
us both off the station.
Having given the Sergeant to under-
stand that he was to blame for the
Corporal's papers being in order, I
allowed myself to be passed on. The
Corporal followed me; he wanted an
explanation. When we got outside the
station I let him catch me up, because
I thought he was entitled to one.
“Will you allow me to ask why you
did that, Sir 2" he said very indig-
nantly but not rudely. “You knew
that I had my papers, Sir, and that
they were in order.”
“Yes,” I said. “But I knew that
my own weren't.”
His cheeks suffused with the most
jovial red I have ever seen.
“In the very strictest confidence,
Corporal,” I said, “I haven't any
papers.”
I didn't know that a human laugh
could be so loud. On the whole I
think it was a good thing that we had
arrived in Paris after closing time, since
otherwise, in spite of my dislike of the
stuff, I'm sure that three more bottles
of the most expensive brand would
have been cracked. I should have had
to stand one; he would have positively
insisted on standing two.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS.
THERE are few phases of the War—
subsidiary phases, side-issues, margin-
alia—more interesting, I think, than the
return of the natives: the triumphant
progress, through their old haunts and
among their old friends, of the youths,
recently civilians, but now tried and
tested warriors; lately so urban and
hesitating and immature, but now so
seasoned and confident and of the
world. And particularly I have in mind
the return of the soldier to his house
of business, and his triumphant pro-
gress through the various departments,
gathering admiration and homage and
even wonder. I am not sure that
wonder does not come first, so striking
can the metamorphosis be.
When he left he was often only a
boy. Very likely rather a young terror
in his way: shy before elders, but a
desperate wag with his contemporaries.
He had a habit of whistling during office
hours; he took too long for dinner, and
was much given to descending the stairs
four at a time and shaking the premises,
blurring the copying-book and under-
stamping the letters. When sent to
the bank, a few yards distant, he was
absent for an hour. Cigarettes and
late hours may have given him a touch
of pastiness. -
To-day, what a change! Tall, well-
set-up and bronzed, he is a model of
health and strength. His eyes meet
all our eyes frankly; he has done
nothing to be ashamed of: there is no
unposted letter in his pocket, no con-
sciousness of a muddled telephone
message in his head. To be on the
dreaded carpet of the manager's room
was once an ordeal; to-day he can drop
cigarette-ash on it and turn never a
hair. -
“Oh yes,” he says, “he has been
under fire. Knows it backwards.
Knows the difference in sound between
all the shells. So far he's been very
lucky, but, Heavens ! the pals he's lost
Terrible things happen, but one gets
numbed—apathetic, you know.
“What does it feel like to go over
the top? The first time it's a rotten
feeling, but you get used to that too.
War teaches you what you can get used
to, by George it does! He wouldn't
have believed it, but there—"
And so on. All coming quite natur-
ally and simply ; no swank, no false
modesty.
“This is his first leave since he went
to France, and he thought he must
come to see the firm first of all. Sad
about poor old Parkins, wasn't it 2
Killed directly. And Smithers' leg–
that was bad too. Rum to see such a
boys' jobs. Well, well, it's a strange
world, and who would have thought all
this was going to happen? . . . .”
Such is his conversation on the
carpet. In the great clerks’ room,
where there are now so many girls, he
is a shade more of a dog. The brave,
you know, can't be wholly unconscious
of the fair, and as I pass through I
catch the same words, but spoken with
a slightly more heroic ring.
“Lord, yes, you get used even to
going over the top. A rotten feeling
the first time, but you get used to it.
That's one of the rum things about
war, it teaches you what you can get
used to. You get apathetic, you know.
That's the word—apathetic: used to
anything. Standing for hours in water
up to your knees. Sleeping among
rats.” (Here some pretty feminine
squeals.) “It is a fact,” he swears to
them. “Rats running over you half
the night, and now and then a shell
bursting close by.”
Standing at his own old desk as he
talks, he looks even taller and stronger
than before—by way of contrast, I
suppose, and as I pass out I wonder if
he will ever be able to bring himself to
resume it.
Having occasion, a little while later,
to go downstairs among the warehouse-
men, where female labour has not yet
penetrated, I hear him again, and notice
that his language has become more
free. Safely underground he extends
himself a little.
“Over the top?” he is saying. “Yes,
three blinking times. What does it
feel like the first time 2 Well—” and
he tells them how it feels, in a way
that I can't reproduce here, but vivid
as lightning compared with his upstairs
manner. And still he remains the clean
forthright youth who sees his duty a
dead sure thing, and does it, even though
he may be perplexed now and then.
“So long ' " they say, old men-friends
and new girl-acquaintances crowding
round him as at last he tears himself
away (and watching him from the
distance I am inclined to think that,
if he gets through, he will come back
to us after all). “So long !” they say.
“Take care of yourself.” -
“You bet !” he replies. “But the
question is, Shall I be allowed to ?
What price the Hun ?” And with a
“So long, all!” he is gone.
All over London, in the big towns
all over Great Britain, are these trium-
phant progresses going on.

SIR,-May I be allowed to protest
with all the vigour at my command
against the revolting suggestion that,
with the view of making cakes from
potatoes they should be first boiled in
their skins. I admit that this is better
than that they should be boiled without
them, but that is all. The potato is
notoriously a sensitive plant. Person-
ally I regard it more in the light of an
emblem than a vegetable. That it is
not necessary as an article of food can
be conclusively proved from the teach-
ing of history, for, as a famous poet
happily puts it—
“In ancient and heroic days,
The days of Scipios and Catos,
The Western world pursued its ways
Triumphantly without potatoes.”
If, however, the shortage of cereals
demands that potatoes should be used
as a substitute for wheat, I suggest
that, instead of being subjected to the
barbarous treatment described above,
they should be granted a painless death
by chloroform or some other anaesthetic.

SIR,--A great deal of fuss is being
made over Irish potato-cakes. Why

is the Irish national vegetable is a
hoary fallacy that needs to be exploded
once and for all. It is nothing of the
sort. The potato was introduced into the
British Isles by Sir WALTER RALEIGH,
a truculent Elizabethan imperialist of
the worst type, transplanted into Ire-
land by the English garrison, and fos-
tered by them for the impoverishment
of the Irish physique. The delibera-
tions of the National Convention now
sitting in Dublin will be doomed to
disaster unless they insist, as the first
plank of their programme, on the elim-
ination of this ill-omened root.

THOROUGHNESS.
IT is generally agreed that the War
has given women great chances, and
that women for the most part have
taken them. Where they have not,
but have preferred frivolity, it is not
always their own fault, but the result
of outside pressure. Such a paragraph,
for example, as the following, by “Lady
Di,” in The Sunday Evening Telegram,
is hardly a clarion call to efficiency:—
“This recurrence of night raids
has made business brisk in the lin-
gerie salons, especially among flatland
dwellers, for it's quite the thing now
to have coffee and cake parties after
a raid, with brandy neat in liqueur
glasses for those whose nerves have
been shaken. And such parties do
give chances for the exhibition of those
dainty garments that usually you have
to admire all by yourself. Which re-
minds me. Don't forget an anklet and
a wristlet of black velvet—the wristlet
on the right and the anklet on the
left |''
Since “Lady Di" is out for making
the most of every opportunity, and
since even she might forget something,
I am minded to help her, two heads
being often better than one. Air raids
are not the only unforseen perils.
Surely some such paragraph as this
would be useful and indicate zeal :—
The escape of German prisoners being
of almost daily occurrence, it would be
well for all women who wish never
to be taken unawares to be prepared
to look their best should one of these
creatures meet them. For nothing is
lost by looking nice; indeed it is one's
duty to be smart, lest dowdiness should
give him the impression that England
really is suffering from the War. A
costume which I have designed to be
seen in by escaping German prisoners
is a “simple” one-piece (not peace)
frock—which, when built by a real
artist, can be so intriguing. Of ninon,
for choice, with a Duvetyn hat. Carry
a gold purse and lift the skirt high
enough to show the finest silk stockings.
THE CROSSBILLS.
A NorthERN pinewood once we knew,
My dear, when younger by some
... lustres, -
Where little painted crossbills flew
And pecked among the fir-cone
clusters;
They hobnobbed and sidled
In coats all aflame,
While young Autumn idled,
And we did the same.
They're cutting down the wood, I hear,
To make it into war material,
And, where the crossbills came, this year
Their firs are lying most funereal;
There's steam saw-mills hum-
ming
And engines at haul,
A new Winter coming
And more trees to fall.
Ah, well, let's hope when Peace at length
Is here, and when our young planta-
tions
In days unborn have got the strength
And pride of ancient generations,
The red birds shall show there
From tree to dark tree,
If two folk should go there

BELLAIRS ON MAN-POWER.
MR. BELLAIRs, it will be remembered,
was the first to discover the possibilities
of proving (by figures) the dwindling
reserves of hostile man-power. His
estimates, based upon pure reason,
personal experience and some two tons
of figures, have been carefully revised
and brought to date, more especially
for the benefit of those busy people
who cannot take a holiday by the sea,
but like to solace themselves at home
with a weekly immersion in Mud and
Water.
Germany.
Here Mr. BELLAIRs is the first to
admit a slight inaccuracy in his previous
calculations. Germany has now eight
men, instead of four, on the Western
Front. It would appear from these
numbers that the enemy attaches
greater importance to defending his
line on this Front than on any other.
Russia.
There are five (and one in reserve)
on the Russian Front. The Russian
retreat is explained to be due to art-
fully inculcated Christian Science (made
in Germany), which has persuaded the
they are being heavily attacked.
Austria. .
Austria is reputed on her last legs
(three altogether). Her one man and
a boy are fighting with the nonchalance
of despair to resist the Allied pressure.
Good news may be expected from this
Front shortly.
Bulgaria.
The warfare of attrition has never
shown such excellent results as in the
case of Bulgaria. Her army of trained
goats is now the only barrier to the
vengeance of the Serbs.
Turkey.
According to the latest report the
Turkish Army has lost its rifle. It is
hoped that every advantage will be
taken of our momentary superior arma-
ment. -
China.
As a last resort Germany is send-
ing her remaining Hun to attack the
Chinese. What they can hope to
achieve by so prodigal a waste of
“cannon-fodder” is difficult to see.
Rumania.
There is no news on the Rumanian
Russians to entertain the belief that
Front. It is thought that there is
nobody there.
Palestine.
In Palestine both sides have with-
drawn their troops and the battle is
proceeding without them.
When one realises that against these
weakening and ever decreasing forces
our Allies will still have a reserve of
80,000,000 by the Spring of 1925, it is
impossible to take an otherwise than
optimistic view of the situation.

PUNCH,
THE GREAT OFFENCE.
As everybody knows, a Gurkha is
first of all a rifleman, but apart from his
rifle (which to a hill-man is both meat
and raiment) there are two other trea-
sures very dear to the little man's heart.
These are his kukri and his umbrella
— symbols of war and peace; and,
although he knows the weapon proper
to each state and can dispense (none
better) with superfluities, there must
have been many times in France
when the absence of his umbrella has
caused him a bitter nostalgia. “Battle
is blessed by Allah and no man tires
thereof,” but trenches are of the Shaitan,
and from the same malevolent one
comes the ever-raging bursät, the piti-
less drenching rain, that falls where a
man may not strip.
With his kukri he did wonders out
there on stilly nights, when he wrig-
gled “over the top," gripping its good
blade in his teeth. Then No Man's
Land became a jungle and the Bosch a
beast whose dispatch was swift and
sure under his cunning wrist. Dawn
would find him squatting in the corner
of his dug-out sleeping as one who
has sweet dreams — dreams maybe of
counting the decapitated before an ad-
miring crowd in his native city, him-
self again the dapper young dog of
Darrapore.
No kilted Jock goes with more swag-
ger down Princes Street than Johnny
Gurkha down the bazaar of Darrapore,
particularly in the evening, when he doffs
khaki for the mufti suit of his clan—
the spotless white shorts, coat of black
sateen, little cocked cap and brightly
bordered stockings—a mode de rigueur
that would be robbed of its final cachet
without the black umbrella, tucked well
up under the arm.
A splendid warrior; in private life a
bit of a Don Juan, perhaps; but his
womenfolk bear him no grudge on this
score, liking themselves to sail easy
through matrimonial seas.
When I returned to the depôt a
month ago there were tales, but, as our
old Subadar - Major observed, “War
brought little disturbances. The mis-
chief was unfortunate, perhaps, but not
irremediable,” and, as the Subadar had
himself been on service in China for a
matter of three years, he knew what he
was talking about.
As for the tales, well, I was reminded
of them a few days ago on making
a tour of the lines to see that quarters
were clean and habitable for the next
batch of invalids. There would be
hospital for some, for others the sunny
little married quarters, and round there
wives were bustling with glee, making
no secret of their late coquetries, but

manifestly glad of the return of their
former lords.
Brass pots were being scoured in the
doorways; babies sprawled in the sun;
a smell of cooking sweetmeats filled the
air; a band of small urchins in the
roadway, wearing the sham accoutre-
ments of war, was prancing blithely to
the song of “Lang-taraf-Tippalaerlee,”
and as their leader pulled up to give
me a grave and perfect salute I recog-
nised the son of old Bahadur Rai.
Now Bahadur Rai would be return-
ing, and, as I recalled the man, I won-
dered how he would take the news of
Bibi, his capricious wife, for I had
heard (unofficially) that she had no in-
tention of leaving the lines of the 2nd
Battalion, or the dashing young Naik
Indrase. This might be a bit awkward,
I mused, remembering the tough little
chap who had been so popular with us
all by reason of being the best shikari
in the regiment. His incorrigible love
of sport may have made the defaulter's
sheet ugly (and there's no denying that
“Absent with leave" does not lead to
quick promotion); but that was in the
good old days. Now he was returning
covered with glory, and I was sorry
about Bibi. -
The train arrived at noon with what
our travelled Babu calls the “blissies.”
They were nearly all marked “P.D.",

AT THE PLAY.
“THE YELLOW TICKET.”
If Mr. MICHAEL MoRTON doesn't
mind my not taking his original play
too seriously I don't mind telling him
how much I enjoyed it. It is quite a
neat example of the shocker—an agree-
able form of entertainment for the
simple and the jaded. The chief pro-
perties are a yellow ticket and a hat-
in. Both belong to the innocent and
beautiful Jewish heroine, Anna Mirol.
It appears that she wanted to leave
the pale to go to see her dying father
in Petersburg, and the police, who will
have their grim joke against a Jewess,
offer her “the most powerful passport
in Russia"—the yellow ticket of Rahab.
She accepts it desperately, and, to es-
cape its horrible obligations, enters an
English family as governess, under an
assumed name. Here the head of the
sinister Okhrana (Secret Police Bureau),
a sleek red-haired sensualist, Baron
Stepan Andreyeff, and a chivalrous but
tactless English journalist, Julian Rolfe,
become acquainted with her. The lat-
ter wishes to marry her; the former's
intentions are strictly dishonourable,
and with the aid of his ubiquitous
using his power to set her free from
the attentions of his detestable minions
for bargaining purposes in a perfectly
Hunnish manner. Discreet servants,
locked doors, champagne, a perfectly
priceless dressing jacket, a sliding
panel disclosing a luxuriously appointed
bedroom—all these resources are at
his disposal.
But he reckons without her hatpin,
which in the course of his deplorably
abrupt attempts at seduction she pushes
adroitly into his heart, and next day
well-informed St. Petersburg winks dis-
creetly when it learns that the Baron
has died after an operation for appen-
dicitis.
How that nice young man, Julian,
is more than a match for the forth-
right methods of the Okhrana is for
you to go and find out.
Mr. ALLAN AYNEsworth's finished
skill was reinforced by a quite admir-
able make-up, though only a policeman
of very melodrama could have missed

a simple pin-prick. But perhaps the
surprise, annoyance and keen dis-
appointment broke his soldierly heart.
Anyway, living or dying, the Baron
was a clever and plausible performance.

reached no heights or depths of passion,
but took a pleasant middle way, and
certainly gets more out of herself than
once seemed likely. I should like to
commend to her the excellent doctrine
of the “dominant mood.” She was,
for instance, just a little too detached in
the recital of that story when playing
for time by the bad Baron's fireside.
Mr. SYDNEY - VALENTINE, having
happily come by an early death in
another theatre, is able to present us

folk to Siberia with all the arbitrary

OUR SOUVENIR UNIT.
“No,” said the Canadian slowly, “organization isn't
everything. Up to a certain point it's necessary, but there
must be a latitude. Give me scope for initiative every time.
“Take an instance. You know our regiments have
runners, men who go to and fro carrying orders and making
liaison along the line. In the regiment I'm telling you
about the runners were two smart chaps—drummers they
were before the War—and not having too much work with
their errands they ran a few side lines of their own, such
as shaving and hair-cutting, cobbling and the like. But of
all their side lines souvenir-selling was the most profitable.
In their capacity of runners they could go where they liked
and accompany any of the attacking parties, so they had
good chances for souvenirs.
“One evening they went over into D Company's trench
and said, “Say, you fellows, anybody want souvenirs 2
| Bert's ordered an attack for daybreak. A, B, and C
Companies carry it out. You're not going. I expect
we shall be doing a nice line in tin hats. Any orders?
Helmet for you? Right, that'll be twenty francs, cash on
delivery. Bosch rifle 2 Yes, if we get any, fifty francs.
Bandoliers, same price. What's that ? Iron Cross? Oh,
not likely . But we'll do our best. A hundred francs if
we deliver the goods.’
“Well, the next day the attack was made, and at one
end of a Bosch trench there was some pretty hand-to-hand
work. An old Rittmeister held it, his breast covered with
decorations, and he just wouldn't give in. Of course, so long
as he stuck it the other Bosches did too, and there was
| nothing doing in the Kamerad line. They fought like fury.
So did our men, but we were slightly outnumbered, and it
soon began to be evident that we should have to retire if
we didn't get reinforcements. But, just when things were
looking hopeless, over the top of the parapet leaped the
two runners, unarmed but irresistible. With blazing eyes
they flung themselves on that old Rittmeister, and while
one of them downed him with a blow under the chin we
heard the voice of the other uplifted in a new slogan: “Give
over, will you, old turnip-head! You've got the goods,
and, by .Sam Hill, we mean to have 'em ' ' And with one
hand he held the prisoner down while with the other
he tore the Iron Cross from his tunic. . . .
“After the Bosch officer's fall our men made short work
of the rest, but the runners didn't wait for victory. There
was a muttered counting of the spoils: ‘Six helmets for
D Company. Two Bosch rifles. One bandolier. And
the Iron Cross. That's the lot. We'd better git.' And
they got.” -
“The two British Colossuses, The Tribune says, opened fire with
their 300 five-millimetres guns.”—The Post (Dundee.)
This is the first we have heard of the new naval pea-shooter.
“The war aims to which Germany and Austria must give assent
must be expressed in unequivocal language and based on the principles
of jujsjtjicjejjjjji.”—Evening Echo (Cork). -
We are not quite sure whether our spirited contemporary
refers to justice or ju-jitsu; but, either way, it means to
give the Huns a knock-out.
“For British and Oversea soldiers and sailors who visit Paris a club
is to be opened at the Hotel Moderne, Place de la République.
The British Ambassador, Sir Douglas Haig, Sir John Jellicoe, and
Sir William Robertson have become patrons of the club, which will
provide them with comfortable quarters and meals at reasonable prices,
supply guides, and generally fulfil a useful purpose."
Evening Standard.
But surely the British Ambassador has already fairly com-
fortable quarters in the Rue Faubourg St. Honoré.
SMALL CRAFT.
WHEN DRAKE sailed out from Devon to break King
PHILIP's pride,
He had great ships at his bidding and little ones beside;
Revenge was there, and Lion, and others known to fame,
And likewise he had small craft, which hadn't any name.
Small craft—small craft, to harry and to flout 'em
Small craft—small craft, you cannot do without 'em
Their deeds are unrecorded, their names are never seen,
But we know that there were small craft, because there
must have been.
When NELsoN was blockading for three long years and
more,
With many a bluff first-rater and oaken seventy-four,
To share the fun and fighting, the good chance and the bad,
Oh, he had also small craft, because he must have had.
Upon the skirts of battle, from Sluys to Trafalgar,
We know that there were small craft, because there
always are;
Yacht, sweeper, sloop and drifter, to-day as yesterday,
The big ships fight the battles, but the small craft clear the
way.
They scout before the squadrons when mighty fleets engage;
They glean War's dreadful harvest when the fight has
ceased to rage; -
Too great they count no hazard, no task beyond their
power,
And merchantmen bless small craft a hundred times an
hour.
In Admirals' despatches their names are seldom heard;
They justify their being by more than written word;
In battle, toil and tempest and dangers manifold
The doughty deeds of small craft will never all be told.
Scant ease and scantier leisure—they take no heed of
these, . . . - -
For men lie hard in small craft when storm is on the seas;
A long watch and a weary, from dawn to set of sun–
The men who serve in small craft, their work is never done.
And if, as chance may have it, some bitter day they lie
Out-classed, out-gunned, out-numbered, with nought to do
but die, * - -
When the last gun's out of action, good-bye to ship and
crew, -
But men die hard in small craſt, as they will always do.
Oh, death comes once to each man, and the game it pays
for all,
And duty is but duty in great ship and in small,
And it will not vex their slumbers or make less sweet their
rest, - -
Though there's never a big black headline for small craft
going west.
Great ships and mighty captains—to these their meed of
praise -
For patience, skill and daring and loud victorious days;
To every man his portion, as is both right and fair,
But oh! forget not small craft, for they have done their
share.
Small craft—small craft, from Scapa Flow to Dover,
Small craft—small craft, all the wide world over,
At risk of war and shipwreck, torpedo, mine and shell,
All honour be to small craft, for oh, they've earned it well!

TRIALS OF A CAMOUFLAGE OFFICER
WHEN AN INSPECTING GENERAL MISTAKES A DISGUISED TRENCH FOR SOLID GROUND.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE opening paragraph of Mr. JEFFERY FARNoL's latest
novel, The Definite Object (Low, MARSTON), informs us that
in the writing of books two things are essential: to know
“when and where to leave off . . . and where to begin.”
Perhaps without churlishness I might add a third, and
suggest that it is equally important to know where to
make your market. Mr. FARNoL, very wisely, plumps for
America; and the new story is a thing of millionaires,
crooks, graft and the like. But don't go supposing for
one moment that these regrettable surroundings have in
the smallest degree impaired the exquisite and waxen
bloom of our author's sympathetic characters. Far from it.
Of the young and oh-so-good-looking millionaire (weary of
pleasures and palaces, too weary even to dismiss his
preposterous and farcical butler—lacking, in effect, the
definite object); of the heroine's young brother, crook in
... embryo, but reclaimable by influence of hero; and of the
peach-like leading lady herself, I can only say that each is
worthy of the rest, and all of a creator who must surely
(I like to think) have laughed more than once behind his
hand during the progress of their creation. I expect by
now that I have as good as told you the plot—young
brother caught burgling hero's flat; hero, intrigued by
mention of sister, doffing his society trappings, following
his captive to crook-land, bashing the wicked inhabitants
with his heroic fists, and finally, of course, wedding the
sister. So there you are l No, I am wrong. The wedding
is not absolute finality, since the heroine (for family pride,
she said, because her brother had tried to shoot her
husband; but, as this reason is manifestly idiotic, I must
suppose her to be acting on a hint from Mr. FARNOL's
publishers) decreed their union to be in name alone.
Which provides for the extra chapters.
Have you ever imagined yourself plunged (bodily, not
mentally) into the midst of a story by some particular
author? If, for example, you could get inside the covers
of a Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick novel, what would you expect
to find 2 Probably a large and pleasantly impecunious
family, with one special daughter who combines great
practical sense with rare personal charm. You would
certainly not be startled to find her brought into contact
with persons of greater social importance than her own;
and you would be excusably disappointed if she did not
end by securing the most eligible young male in the cast.
I feel bound to add that a perusal of Anne Lulworth
(METHUEN) has left me with these convictions more firmly
established than ever. The Lulworth household, from the
twins to the practical mother, is Sidgwickian to its core,
though perhaps one can't but regret that the Great
Unmasking has for ever robbed them of the society of
those fat and seemingly kindly Teutons who used to pro-
vide such good contrast. The Lulworths lived at Putney,
and never had quite enough money for the varied calls of
clothes and education and sausages for breakfast. Then
Anne went on a visit to ever such a delightful big house in
Cornwall, and there met the only son . . . But then came

the War and he was reported missing, so Anne stayed on
indefinitely with his widowed mother; and the unpleasant
next-of-kin (Mrs. SIDGwick never can wholly resist the
temptation of burlesquing her villains) refused to believe
that she had ever been engaged to Victor, and indeed went
on indulging their low-comedy spleen till the great moment,
so long and confidently expected, when— But really I
suppose I needn't say what happens then. Sidgwickiana,
in short, seasonable at all times, and sufficient for any
number of persons.
Mrs. A. M. Dixon began her work in October, 1915, as
manager of one of the Cantines des Dames Anglaises estab-
lished in France under the aegis of the London Committee
of the French Red Cross. She remained until the beginning
of July in the following year, and in The Canteeners (MURRAY)
she gives an account of her experiences at Troyes, Héri-
court and Le Bourget, where she and her helpers ministered
to an almost unceasing stream of tired-out French soldiers.
There is something remarkably fresh and attractive about
this story. It does not aim at fine writing, but its very
hand and her titled, relatives' objets d'art, her discovery
that the splendid fellow she has idolised—it must be
admitted, without any indiscreet investigation of his past
—is a thief, and their final reconciliation in the rude but
honest atmosphere of a New Mexico cattle ranch, are all
included in the modest half-crown's worth that C. N. and
A. M. WILLIAMSON put forward as their latest effort. And
nowadays you can't buy much of anything for half-a-crown.
With commendable idealism Mr. SIDNEY PATERNOSTER
considers The Great Gift (LANE) to be Love, and brings a
certain seriousness to bear upon his theme. Hugh Standish,
ex-newsboy, is at the age of twenty-five partner of an
important shipping firm, as well as large holder in a book-
selling business, which, in his leisure, he has so successfully
run that it is “floated with a capital of £100,000 and over-
subscribed ” (incidentally rejoice, ye novelists 1). At forty-
six he is the whole shipping firm and a Cabinet Minister to
boot. I would ask Mr. PATERNOSTER if such a man, who
has, ea hypothesi, been so busy that he needs the sight of
an out-of-work being tended and caressed by his faithful
simplicity, which is that of
letters written to an inti-
mate friend, carries a reader
along through a succession
of incidents keenly observed
and sympathetically noted
in the scanty leisure of a
very busy life. That she
succeeded as she did is a
high tribute to her kindness
and tact as well as to her
organising capacity. I can-
not forbear quoting from the
letter of a grateful poilu :
“DEAR MIss, I am arrived

Don't make attention of my mistakes, please.” The book
is well illustrated with photographs. I recommend it both
on account of its intrinsic merits and because the author's
profits are to be given to the London Committee of the
French Red Cross.
When a penniless but oh, so ladylike “companion " goes
to the Savoy in answer to a “with a view to matrimony”
advertisement, what more natural than that the party of
the first part should prove to be—not a genteel widower
in the haberdashery business, but a handsome super-burglar
of immense wealth and all the more refined virtues. True,
he burgles, but his manly willingness to reform in order
to please the lady shows that his heart was always in the
right place, wherever his fingers might be. Then again
the actual pillage occurs “off,” as they say, and the gentle-
manly burglar, while not “occupied in burgling,” walks
the stage a perfect Sir George Alexander of respectability.
Do I hear you, gentle reader, exclaiming, like the Scots-
man when he first saw a hippopotamus, “Hoots! There's
nae sic a animal!” It is simply your ignorance. The
joint authors of This Woman to this Man (METHUEN) have
selected him as the hero of their latest novel, so there
he is. His combined annexation of the penniless beauty's
ference to the play of cir-
cumstance upon his characters. I am afraid he has shirked
the difficult labour of artistic plausibility, and I leave it to
moralists to decide whether his excellent intentions and
sentiments redeem this aesthetic offence.
Weird o' the Pool (MURRAY) may be described as a sub-
terranean book. I mean that its characters are frequently
to be found in secret passages and caves and places unknown
to law-abiding citizens. The scenes of this story of incident
are laid in Scotland at the beginning of last century, and
Mr. ALEXANDER STUART makes things move at such a pace
that for a hundred pages or so I could not keep up with
him. Then two kind ladies had a conversation, and the
confusion which had invaded my mind was suddenly and
completely cleared away. The pace after this dispersal
is as brisk as ever, but it is quite easy to keep up with
it. All the same, I cannot help thinking that Mr. Stuart
has overcrowded his canvas, and that his tale would be
the better for the removal of a few of his plotters and
counter-plotters from it. I have never yet said a good
word for a synopsis, but I do not mind admitting that I
could put up with one here.

TO THE POTSDAM PACIFIST.
Now for the fourth time since you broke your word,
And started hacking through, the seasons' cycle
Brings Autumn on ; the goose, devoted bird,
Prepares her shrift against the mass of MICHAEL;
Earth takes the dead leaves' stain,
And Peace, that hardy annual, sprouts again.
Yet why should you support the Papal Chair
In fostering this recurrent apparition ?
Never (we gather) were your hopes more fair,
Your moral in a more superb condition;
Never did Victory's goal
Seem more adjacent to your sanguine soul.
HINDENBURG holds your British foes in baulk
Prior to trampling them to pulp like vermin;
Russia is at your mercy—you can walk
Through her to-morrow if you so determine;
There is no France to fight— -
Your gallant WILLIE's blade has “bled her white.”
In England (as exposed by trusty spies)
We are reduced to starve on dog and thistles;
London, with all her forts, in ashes lies; -
Through Scarboro's breached redoubts the sea-wind
whistles: -
And Margate, quite unmanned,
Would cause no trouble if you cared to land.
Roumania is your granary, whence you draw
For loyal tums a constant cornucopia;
Belgium, quiescent under Culture's law,
Serves as a type of Teutonised Utopia;
And, as for U.S.A.,
They're scheduled to arrive behind The Day.
Why, then, this talk of Peace? The victor's meed
Lies underneath your nose—why not continue?
Because humanity makes your bosom bleed;
So, though you have a giant's strength within you,
Your gentle heart would shrink
To use it like a giant—I don't think. O. S.
MISTAKEN CHARITY.
SLIP was riding a big chestnut mare down the street and
humming an accompaniment to the tune she was playing
with her bit. He pulled up when he saw me and, still
humming, sat looking down at me.
“Stables in ten minutes," I said. “You’re heading the
wrong way.”
“A dispensation, my lad,” he replied. “I’m taking Miss
Spangles up on the hill to get her warm—'tis a nipping
and an eager air.”
A man was coming across the road towards us. He was
incredibly old and stiff and the dirt of many weeks was
upon him. He stood before us and held out a battered
yachting cap. “M'sieur,” he said plaintively.
Miss Spangles cocked an ear and began to derange the
surface of the road with a shapely foreleg. She was bored.
“Tell him,” said Slip, “that I am poorer even than he
is ; that this beautiful horse which he admires so much is
the property of the King of ENGLAND, and that my clothes
are not yet paid for.”
I passed this on. -
“M'sieur,” said the old man, holding the yachting cap a
little nearer.
“Give him a piece of money to buy soap with,” said
Slip. “Come up, Topsy,” and he trotted slowly on.
-
I gave the old man something for soap and went my way.
That night at dinner the Mandril, who loves argument
better than life, said a propos of nothing that any man who
gave to a beggar was a public menace and little better
than a felon. He was delighted to find every man's hand
against him.
“IRUSKIN,” said Slip, “decrees that not only should one
give to beggars, but that one should give kindly and deliber-
ately and not as though the coin were red-hot.”
The Mandril threw himself wildly into the argument.
He told us dreadful stories of beggars and their ways—of
advertisements he had seen in which the advertisers under-
took to supply beggars with emaciated children at so much
per day. Children with visible sores were in great demand,
he said; nothing like a child to charm money from the
pockets of passers-by, etc., etc. Presently he grew tired
and changed the subject as rapidly as he had started it.
It was at lunch a few days later that the Mess waiter
came in with a worried look on his face.
“There is a man at the door, Sir,” he said. “Me and
Burler can't make out what he wants, but he won't go
away, not no’ow.” - -
“What's he like 2 " I asked.
“Oh, he's old, Sir, and none too clean, and he's got a
sack with him.” -
“Stop,” said Slip. “Now, Tailer, think carefully before
you answer my next question. Does he wear a yachting
cap 2" -
*Yes, Sir,” said Tailer, “that 's it, Sir, 'e do wear a sort
of sea 'at, Sir.”
“This is very terrible,” said Slip. “Are we his sole
means of support 2 However ” and he drew a clean
plate towards him and put a franc on it. The plate went
slowly round the table and everyone subscribed. Stephen,
who was immersed in a book on Mayflies, put in ten francs
under the impression that he was subscribing towards the
rent of the Mess. The Mandril appeared to have quite
forgotten his dislike of beggars.
Tailer took the plate out and returned with it empty.
“He’s gone, Sir," he said.
“I'm glad for your sake, dear Mandril, that you have
fallen in with our views,” said Slip.
“What!” shouted the Mandril. “I quite forgot. A
beggar !—the wretched impostor.” He rushed to the win-
dow. An old man had rounded the corner of the house
and was crossing the road on his way to a small café
opposite. -
“He’s going to drink it,” screamed the Mandril; “bat-
tery will fire a salvo;” and he seized two oranges from the
sideboard. The first was a perſect shot and hit the target
between the shoulder-blades, and the second burst with
fearful force against the wall of the café. The victim turned
and looked about him in a dazed fashion and then dis-
appeared. -
. That night I received a note from Monsieur Le Roux,
hardware merchant and incidentally our landlord, thanking
me for sixteen francs seventy-five centimes paid in advance
to his workman, and asking me to name a day on which he
could call to mend.our broken stove.
“It is not a little pathetic to observe that a year ago, and even
two years ago, The Daily Mail was urging the Government then
in power to introduce compulsory rations. Thus on November 13,
1916, we said: ‘Ministers should at once prepare the organisation
for a system of bread tickets. It took the diligent Germans six
months to get their system into action, and it will take our . . .
officials quite as long. They ought to be getting to work on it now,
not putting it off.’”—Daily Mail.
We dare not guess what was the suppressed adjective that
The Daily Mail applied to “our officials.”

SUGAR CONTROL.
“Good evening, Sir,” said Lord
RHoNDDA's minion (the man who does
his dirty work), moistening his lips
with a bit of pencil, “You were allo-
cated one hundredweight of sugar for
jam-making in respect of your soft
fruit, I believe 2"
“How did you guess?" I said. “I
say, do tell me when the War's going
to end. Just between ourselves, you
know.”
“This being the case,” he went on
(evidently trying to chänge the subject
—no War Office secrets to be got out
of him, you notice), “I must request
you to show me your fruit-trees and
also your jam cupboard.” -
“The latter,” I said—for he had
called just after tea—“is
rather full at present, but
doing micely, thanks. As
you observe, however, we
think it wiser not to try to
close the bottom button of
the door.”
“Perhaps your wife
suggested the man tenta-
tively.
“My wife does her best,
of course. She often says,
“Dearest, a third pot of tea
if you like, but I'm sure a
third cup of jam wouldn't
be good for you.' By the
way, don't you want to see
the tea-drchard too? The

the victim's wake, ready to close the

My wife slid open the trap, turning
with a triumphant smile as she did so,
and I saw at once that the death of
anyone shut up inside would be a lot
more lingering than I had imagined,
for the place seemed full of jam. I
was surprised. -
“Can I be going to eat all that?” I
thought; and life seemed suddenly a
very beautiful thing.
The inspector ran a hungry eye over
it all, and if he had tried to clamber
inside for a closer inspection I should
not have given him the quick push I
had planned. I should have held him
back by his coat. My own way of

At this moment my wife appeared, wife had made was not for the likes of
looking particularly charming in a
mousseline de soie aur fines herbes—
anglicé, a sprigged muslin. I seized
her hand and led her aside.
“Lord RHONDDA's myrmidon is upon
us!” I hissed. “'Tis for your hus-
band's life, child. Hold the minion of
the law in check—attract him ; fasci-
nate him; play him that little thing on
the piano—you know, ‘Tum-ti-tum '—
while I slope off to the secret chamber,
where my ancestor lay hid before—I
mean after—the Battle of Worcester.
By the way, I hope it's been dusted
lately 2 Hush if he sees us hold
secret parlance I'm lost.”
“Alas!” said my wife, “the secret
chamber is where we keep the jam.”
She smiled subtly at me and then
winningly at the inspector as she turned
towards him.
“Step this way, please,” she con-
tinued.
I caught the idea at once and, bless-
ing the quick wit of woman, followed in
him.
“About a hundred-and-fifty pounds,”
he said at last.
“Just a little over,” nodded my wife.
“I tell you,” I whispered, “this chap
knows everything.” Then aloud, “I
say, Sir, if you wouldn't mind putting
me on to something for the Cotsall
Selling Plate. Simply,” I added hastily,
“in the national interest, of course.
Keeping up the breed of horses.”
The inspector changed the subject
again. “You were allocated one hun-
dredweight of sugar, I believe, Ma'am,”
he said.
“Oh, yes,” replied my wife. “But
you see some of our jam is still sticking
to the trees. Perhaps this gentleman
would like to see the orchard, Wen-
ceslaus,” she added, turning to me.
(Of course, you know, my Christian
name isn't really Wenceslaus, but we
| authors enjoy so little privacy nowa-
days that I must really be allowed to
leave it at that.)
So I took the inspector off to see the
orchard, pausing on the way at the
strawberry bed.
“This,” I explained, “was to have
made up quite fifty pounds of our allo-
cation, but I'm afraid the crop failed
this year. So that must account for
any little discrepancy in the weight of
fruit.” I was very firm about this.
“Strawberries have done well enough
elsewhere,” said Nemesis suspiciously.
“I’m surprised that yours should have
failed.” . -
“When I say “failed,” I explained,
“I mean “failed to get as far as the
preserving pan.' I always retain an
option on eating the crop fresh.”
The inspector frowned and was going
to make a note of this, so I tried to
distract his attention.
“Do you know,” I said,
º “a short time ago people
persisted in mistaking me
for a brother of the Duke
* of Cotsall?”
“Why?” he asked—
rather rudely.
“Because of the straw-
berry mark on my upper
lip. Ah, I think this is |
the orchard. There was
a wealth of bloom here
when I put in my appli-
cation.”
“Applications were not
made till the fruit was
on the trees,” said Lord
R H on DDA's minion,
sharply. “Ah, there's a
nice lot of plums.”
This seemed more satis-
factory.
- - “Yes, isn't there?” I
said enthusiastically. “Now I'm sure
this makes up the amount all right.”
“Plums are stone fruit,” he observed
stonily, “and you were allocated one
hundredweight of sugar for your soft
fruit, I believe?”
One really gets very tired of people
who go on harping on the same thing
over and over again.
“What about raspberries?” I in-
uired.
“Soft fruit, of course,” said the
inspector.
“But they contain stones,” I urged.
“Nasty little things wot gits into the
'ollers of your teeth somethink cruel, as
cook says. Really, the Government
ought to give us more careful instruc-
tions. And what about the apples?
Are pips stones?”
“Apples are not used for jam-mak-
ing,” he retorted.
“What l” I exclaimed. “Tell that
to the to the Army in general! Plum-
and-apple jam, my dear Sir! And that
reminds me: a jam composed of half

“Well, Sir,” said the inspector,

don't think we need go into that. I
think you've got just about the re-

believe, you were allocated.”
“There's still the rose garden,” I
said, “if you're not satisfied.”

I'm sure.”
“Well, I don't know,” I said. “My

PETHERTON AND THE RAC AUCTION.
A LETTER I received last Friday gave
me one of those welcome excuses to get
into closer touch with my neighbour,
Petherton, than our daily proximity
might seem to connote. I wrote to
him thus:—
DEAR MR. PETHERTON,+Miss Gore-
Langley has written to me to say that
she is getting up a Rag Auction on be-
half of the Belgian Relief Fund, and not
knowing you personally, and having
probably heard that I am connected by
ties of kinship with you, she asked me
to approach you on the subject of any
old clothes you may have to spare in
such a cause.
Of course I'm not suggesting you
should allow yourself to be denuded
in the cause (like Lady GoDIVA), but I
daresay you have some odds and ends
stowed away that you would contri-
bute; for instance, that delightful old
topper that you were wont to go to
church in before the War, and that used
to cause a titter among the choir—
can't you get the moths to let you have
it 2 Neckties, again. Where are the
tartans of '71? Surely there may be
some bonny stragglers left in your tie-
bins. And who fears to talk of '98 and
its fancy waistcoats? All rancour about
them has passed away, and if you have
any ring-straked or spotted survivors,
no doubt they would fetch something in
a good cause. I hope you will see what
you can do for
Yours very truly,
HENRY J. Fordyce.
Petherton's reply was brief. He
wrote:—
SIR,-Had Miss Gore-Langley chosen
a better channel for the conveyance of
her wishes I should have been only too
pleased to do what I could to help. As
it is, I do not care to have anything to
do with the affair.
Yours faithfully,
FREDERICK PETHERTON.
But he was better than his word, as
I soon discovered. So I wrote:—
DEAR PETHERTON, I have had such
a treat to-day. I took one or two
things across to Miss Gore-Langley,
who was unpacking your noble con-
tributions when I arrived. Talk about
family histories; your parcel spoke
volumes.
I was frightfully interested in that
brown bowler with the flat brim, and
those jam-pot collars. Parting with
them must have been such sweet
SOrrow.
I feel like bidding for some of your
things, among which I also noted an
elegantly-worked pair of braces. With
a little grafting on to the remains of
those I am now wearing, the result
should be something really serviceable.
I don't mind confessing to you that I
simply can't bring my mind to buying
any new wearing apparel just now.
I'd like the bowler too. It should help
to keep the birds from my vegetables,
and incidentally the wolf from the
door. And seeing it fluttering in the
breeze you would have a continual
reminder of your own salad days.
Surely the priceless family portrait
in the Oxford oak frame got into the
parcel by mistake. I am expecting to
acquire that for a song, as it cannot be
of interest except to one of the family,
and I should be glad to number it
among my heirlooms.
Miss G.-L. is awfully braced with
the haul, and asked me to thank you,
which is one of my objects in writing
this. Yours sincerely,
HARRY FoRDYoe.
Petherton was breathing hard by
this time, and let drive with :— *.
SIR,--It is like your confounded im-
pertinence to overhaul the few things|
I sent to Miss Gore-Langley, and had
I known that you would have had the
opportunity of seeing what my wife
insisted on sending I should certainly
not have permitted their despatch.
I have already told you what I think
of your ridiculous claims to kinship
with my family, and shall undoubtedly
try to thwart any impudent attempts
you may make to acquire my discarded
belongings. The photograph you men-
tion was of course accidentally in-
cluded in the parcel, and I am sending
for it. Yours faithfully,
FREDERick PETHERTON.
In the cause of charity I rushed over
to the Dower House, and pointed out to
Miss Gore-Langley how she might
swell the proceeds of the sale. I then
wrote thus to Petherton —
DEAR old MAN, Thanks for your
jolly letter. I'm sorry to tell you that
Miss G.-L. holds very strong views on
the subject of charitable donations, and
you will have to go and bid for any-
thing you want back. I'm very keen
on that photograph, if only for the sake
of your pose and the elastic-side boots
you affected at that period. Everyone
here is quite excited at the idea of

necessary, but I shall contest the owner-
ship of the bowler up to a point.
Why not have your revenge by buy-
ing one or two of my things? There is
a choice pair of cotton socks, marked
T.W., that I once got from the laundry
by mistake; they are much too large
for me, but should fit you nicely.
There's a footbath too. It leaks a bit,
but your scientific knowledge will en-
able you to put it right. It's a grand
thing to have in the house, in case of a
sudden rush of blood to the head.
Cheerio!
Yours ever, HARRY.
Petherton simply replied:—
SIR,--It is, I know, absolutely use.
less to make an appeal to you, and I
shall simply outbid you for the portrait
if possible; if not, I shall adopt other
measures to prevent your enjoying your
ill-mannered triumph.
Yours faithfully, F. PETHERTON.
The Auction was held last Wednes-
day. I didn't attend it, but got Miss
Gore-Langley to run up the price of
the portrait as far as seemed safe, on
my behalf, which resulted in Mrs.
Petherton getting it for £5 15s. I got
the hat, but Mrs. Petherton outbid my
agent for the braces.
DEAR FREDDY (I wrote), Wasn't it a
roaring success—the Auction, I mean?
I didn't manage to attend, but have
heard glowing accounts from its pro-
moter.
The most insignificant things, I
hear, went for big prices; one patriotic
lady, I'm told, even going to £5 15s. for
a faded photograph of a veteran in the
clothes of a most uninteresting sartorial
period. . It was in a cheap wooden
frame, of a pattern that is quite out
of the movement. Fancy, £5 15s. !
Did you buy anything?
In haste, Yours, H.
If you have any stout safety-pins,
lend me a couple, old boy. I failed to
secure the braces. They fetched 1s. 9d.,
which was greatly in excess of their
intrinsic value.

It is just to meet such pressing
demands as this that the Gramophobia
Company have introduced their remark-
able instrument or weapon, described
as The Clinchophone. No home is
complete without it.
It is supplied with little oil bath,
B.S.A. fittings and kick start.
A child can set it in motion, but
nothing on earth will stop it until its
object is achieved and there is peace
with honour. -
Installed in a neighbourhood bristling
with pianos, amateur singers, gramo-
phones, and other grind boxes it saves
its cost in doctors' bills.
It is fatal at fifty yards, and there
has been nothing like it since the

thing except stop before its time.
Read the following testimonials:—
“GENTLEMEN, -While the grand
piano next door was playing last even-

phone. The piano immediately sat
back on its haunches, gibbered and
then fell on the player.”
“DEAR SIR,-At the first trial of my
new Clinchophone my neighbour's
gramophone rushed out of the house
and has not been heard of since.”
“SAVED" says: “Last night the
basso profondo two doors away started
singing, “Rocked in the Cradle of the

Far other is this battle in the waste,
Wherein, each night, thcugh not of course afraid,
I wriggle round with ill-concealed distaste,
Where who can say what menace is not nigh,
What ambushed foe, what unexploded crump,
And the glad worm, aspiring to the sky,
Emerges suddenly and makes you jump.
Where either all is still, so still one feels
That something huge must presently explode,
And back, far back, is heard the noise of wheels
From Prussian waggons on the Douai road;
And flares shoot upward with a startling hiss
And fall, and flame intolerably close,
So that it seems no living man could miss—
How huge my head must look, my legs how gross —
Or the live air is full of droning hums
And cracking whips and whispering snakes of fire,
And a loud buzz of conversation comes
From Simpson's party putting out some wire.
And the hushed orchestra may now begin—
A sudden rage inflames the placid Hun
Or else—as when some soloist is done
And scouts lie naked in a world of din.
The sullen bomb dissolves in singing shapes;
| The whizz-bang jostles it—too fast to flee;
Machine-guns chatter like demented apes—
And, goodness, can it all be meant for me?
It can and is. And such are small affairs
Compared with Tompkins and his Lewis gun,
Or eager folk who play about with flares,
And, like as not, mistake me for a Hun;
Compared with when some gunner, having dined,
To show his guest the glories of his art
“Poops off a round or two,' which burst behind,
But fail to drown the beating of my heart
Sweet to all soldiers is the rearward view;
To infanteers how grand the gunners' case !
And I suppose men pine at G.H.Q.
For the rich ease of people at the Base.
To me is sweet this mean and noisome ditch,
When on my belly I must issue out
Into the night, inscrutable as pitch—
I wish to Heaven that I was not a Scout !”

Orderly (to Colonel). “CAN I GET You A TAXI, SIR”
INSPECTION.
Colonel. “YES, PLEASE, DEAR.
A LONDON MYSTERY SOLVED.
EveRYoNE must have observed a
phenomenon of the London streets
which becomes continually more notice-
able. And not only must they have
observed it, but have suffered from it.
At one time the omnibuses, which
are rapidly becoming the only means
of street transport for human beings,
had regular stopping-places at the
corners of streets, at Piccadilly Circus,
at Oxford Circus, and so forth.
The corner was the accepted spot;
the crowds gathered there, and the
omnibus, stopping there, emptied and
refilled. But there has been a gradual
tendency towards the abandonment of
the corners, causing the omnibuses to
pull up farther and farther from them,
so that it seems almost as if a time may
come when, instead of Piccadilly Circus,
for example, the stopping-place for
west-bound omnibuses will be St.
James's church.
Everyone, as I say, must have noticed
this change in traffic habits, and most
people believe that police regulations
are at the bottom of it.
But I know better; and the reason
why I know better is a little conversa-
tion I have had with a driver.
It was during one of the finest
efforts towards depressing dampness
that even this Summer has put up, and
the driver dripped. A great crowd of
miserable mortals awaited his omnibus
at a certain recognised halt, all des-
perately anxious for a seat or even
standing room; but these he dis-
regarded and carefully urged the vehicle
on for another twenty yards.
While the wretched people were run-
ning along the pavement to begin their
struggle for a place, I asked him why
he had put them to all that trouble.
“I suppose it's the police,” I said,
to make it easier for him.
“Not as I know of,” he replied.
“But why not stop where the public
expect you to?” I asked. -
“Why?” he inquired.
“Well, it would be more reasonable,
more helpful,” I suggested.
“Who wants to help or be reason-
able?” he replied. “Here, look at me.
I'm driving this bus for hours and
hours every day. I'm cold and wet.
I'm putting on the brakes from morn-
ing to night, saving people's silly lives,
until I'm sick of the sight of them.
If you was to drive a motor bus in
London you’d want a little amusement
now and then, too.”
“So it's just for entertainment that
you dodge about over the stopping-
places and keep changing then 2'' I
asked. -
“Yes,” he replied.
Another Impending Apology.

met with a masty motor accident; but had
escaped with only slight injuries.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUD LARKS.
Nobody out here seems exactly in-
fatuated with the politicians nowadays.
The Front Trenches have about as
much use for the Front Benches as a
big-game hunter for mosquitoes. The
bayonet professor indicates his row of
dummies and says to his lads, “Just
imagine they are Cabinet Ministers—
go!” and in a clock-tick the heavens
are raining shreds of sacking and par-
ticles of straw. The demon bomber
fancies some prominent Parliament-
arian is lurking in the opposite sap,
grits his teeth, and gets an extra five
yards into his bowling.
But I am not entirely of the vulgar
opinion. The finished politician may
not be a subject for odes, but a politi-
cal education is a great asset to any
man. Our Mess President, William,
once assisted a friend to lose a parlia-
mentary election, and his experience
| has been invaluable to us. The moment
we are tired of fighting and want billets,
the Squadron sits down where it is and
the Skipper passes the word along for
William.
adjusts his tie and heads for the most
prepossessing farm in sight. Arrived
there he takes off his hat to the dog,
pats the pig, asks the cow after the
calf, salutes the farmer, curtseys to the
farmeress, then turning to the inevit-
able baby, exclaims in the language of
the country, “Mong Jew, kell jolly ong-
fong." (Gosh, what a topping kid'),
and bending tenderly over it imprints
a lingering kiss upon its indiarubber
features and wins the freedom of the
farm. The Mess may make use of the
kitchen; the spare bed is at the Skip-
per's disposal; the cow will move u
and make room for the First Mate; the
pig will be only too happy to welcome
the Subalterns to its modest abode.
Ordinary billeting officers stand no
chance against our William and his
political education. “That fellow,” I
heard one disgruntled competitor re-
mark of him, “would hug the Devil
for a knob of coke.” Once only did he
meet his match, and a battle of Titans
resulted.
In pursuit of his business he entered
a certain farm-house, to find the baby
already in possession of another officer,
a heavy red creature with a monocle,
who was rocking the infant's cradle
seventy-five revolutions per minute and
making dulcet noises on a moustache
comb.
William's heart fell to his field boots;
he recognised the red creature's mark-
ings immediately. This was another
politician; no bloodless victory would
be his; fur would fly first, powder
burn—Wow!
William dusts his boots,
ſ

DIFFERENT."
Porter. “WHAT CAN YER ExPECT, MIssus, IF YER Asks Four DIFFERENT Port ERs?"
The red person must have tumbled
to William as well, for he increased the
revolutions to one hundred and forty
per minute and broke into a shrill
lullaby of his own impromptu composi-
tion:—
“Go to sleep, Mummy's liddle Did-ums;
Go to sleep, Daddy's liddle Thing-me-jig.”
Nevertheless this did not baffle our
William. He approached from a flank,
deftly twitched the infant out of its
cradle by the scruff of its neck, and com-
menced to plaster it with tender kisses.
However the red man tailed it as it
went past and hung on, kissing any
bits he could reach. When the mother
reappeared they were worrying the
baby between them as a couple of
hound puppies worry the hind leg of a
cub. She beat them faithfully with a
broom and hove both of them out into
the wide wet world, and we all slept in
a bog that night, and William was
much abused and loathed. But that
was his only failure.
If getting billets is William's job,
getting rid of them is the Babe's affair.
William, like myself, has far too great
a mastery of the patois to handle
delicate situations with success. For
instance, when the farmer approaches
me with tidings that my troopers have
burnt two ploughshares and a crowbar
and my troop horses have masticated
a brick wall I engage him in palaver,
with the result that we eventually part,
I under the impression that the inci-
dent is closed, and he under the impres-
sion that I have promised to buy him
a new farm. This leads to all sorts of
international complications.
The Babe, on the other hand, regards
a knowledge of French as immoral and
only knows enough of it to order him-

when we evacuate a billet William fur-

THE TWO LETTERS.
I HAD as usual two letters to write.
There are always two and often twenty,
but this morning there were two only.
One was to my old friend, A., who had
just gone into bankruptcy; the other
was to my young friend, B., whose
sporting efforts in France have won
him very rapid promotion. He was
just bringing his new captain's stars to
England on a few days' leave.
A. is a somewhat austere and melan-
choly man; B. is just as different as
you can imagine.
I wrote thus. First to A. :—
“MY DEAR MAN,+I am sorry to hear
your bad news. The times are suffi-
ciently depressing without such a blow
- as this having to fall on
you. I am certain that you
don't deserve such treat-
ment, and you have all my
sympathy. As for the dis-
grace—there is none. You
are simply a victim of the
War. If there is anything
I can do to cheer you up,
let me know.
I am, yours, etc., -.
To B. I wrote thus:—
“DEAR OLD TOP,-This
is the best news I have
heard for a long time. I
always knew you would
bring it off soon ; but I
wasn't prepared for any-
thing quite so sudden.
There is, of course, only
one thing to do when a
man fulfils his destiny in
this way. The custom is
immemorial, and, war or no
war, we must crack a bottle.
Tell me where you would like to dine,
and when, and I'll fix it up, and some
jolly show afterwards. Occasions like
this must be celebrated.
I am, yours, etc.,
So far it is a somewhat feeble narra-
tive, nor has it any point beyond the
circumstance that I posted the letters
in the wrong envelopes.

THE WAR DOG.
NEvER confuse the “War dog” with the “dog of War.”
The War dog is a direct product of the War, but you
never yet met him collecting for a hospital, or succouring
the wounded, or assisting the police, or hauling a mitrail-
leuse if he could help it. Yet the War dog worships the
Army; it represents a square meal and a “cushy", bed.
The new draft takes him for a mascot; but the old hand
knows him better. A shameless blend of petty larceny,
mendacity, fleas, gourmandism, dirt and unequalled
plausibility. -
You meet the War dog on some endless road. He will
probably be wearing round his neck a piece of dirty card
analogous to the eye patch and drooping Inverness cape
of some mendicants nearer home—a “property" in fact,
and put there by himself, the writer is convinced, although
he has not yet actually caught the War dog dressing for
the part. The War dog on the road has “ spotted "you
long before you have seen him, and he has marked you for
his own. You become conscious of a piteous whine just
behind you and, turning, see the War dog, his eyes filled
with tears of entreaty, crawling towards you on his stomach.
He advances inch by inch, and on being encouraged with
comfortable words of invitation the parasite wriggles his
lean body (it is trained to look lean—actually it is well
padded with stolen food from officers' kitchens) * to your
feet, and, selecting a puddle in token of his deep humility,
rolls upon his back and smiles tearfully up at you from
between his grimy fore-paws. Then the game goes forward
merrily as per schedule. - *
Of course you take him back to camp and give him your
last piece of Blighty cake. You introduce your protégé–
always crawling on his stomach—to the cook; swear to
the dog's immaculate conduct; beg a trifle of straw from
the transport, and in short see him comfortably settled for
the night. - ; : - -
The War dog has you now well beneath his paws. He
joins the Mess and listens with an ill-concealed grin as
each in turn boasts of the rat-catching powers of his dog at
home. Then the War dog retreats hurriedly as a mouse
appears; and you, his victim, apologise for him and explain
how he has been shaken by adversity and what a noble
creature a few days of good food and kind treatment will
make of him. The rest is simple. The War dog (with his
court) invades your bed and home parcels, and brings you
into disrepute with all and sundry—especially the Cook and
Quarter. He is fought and soundly thrashed by the regi-
mental mascot (half his size), and the battalion wit
composes limericks about you and your pet.
Then suddenly your War dog disappears. You are just
beginning to live him down—having moved into another
area—when you espy him from the street, the centre of a
noisy group in a not too reputable wine-shop. But the
War dog never recognises you. He has finished with you
—grown tired of you, in fact (he rarely “works” the same
victim for more than three weeks). You and your battalion
are to him as it were a bone picked clean; and you depart
with a prayer that he may die a stray's death at the hands
of the Military Police.
One month travelling snugly in a G.S. waggon (you
never catch him marching like an honest mascot), the
next “swinging the lead" in some warm dug-out—there
are few moves on the board of the great War game that he
does not know. He will patronise a score of regiments in
three months; travel from one end of the Western Eront
to the other and back again, taking care never to attempt to
renew an old acquaintance. Occasionally he makes the
mistake of running across a mitrailleuse battery with its
dog-teams needing reinforcements, or tries to billet himself
on a military pigeon-loft and meets a violent death. But
whatever fortune may bring him we can confidently assert
that he is much too fly to chance his luck across the
border and into the land where the sausage-machines guard
the secret of perpetual motion.
IN WILD WALES.
DwarfiNG the town that to the hillside clings
On terraced slopes, the castle, nobly planned
And noble in its ruined greatness, flings
Its double challenge to the sea and land.
Oh, if the ancient spirit of the place
Could win free utterance in articulate tones,
What tales to hearten and inspire and brace
Would issue from these grey and lichened stones'
Once manned and held by paladin and peer,
Now tenanted by jackdaws, bats and owls,
Save when the casual tourist through its drear
And grass-grown courts disconsolately prowls.
Once famous as the scene of Border fights,
Now watching, in the greatest war of all,
Old men, with their bilingual acolytes,
Beating, outside its gates, a little ball;
While on the crumbling battlements on high,
Where mail-clad men-at-arms kept watch and ward,
Adventurous sheep amaze the curious eye
Instead of grazing on the level sward.
But though such incongruities may jar
The sense of fitness in a mind fastidious,
Modernity has wholly failed to mar
The face of Nature here, or make it hideous.
Inland the amphitheatre of hills
Sweeps round with Snowdon as their central crest,
And murmurs of innumerable rills
Blend with the heaving of the ocean's breast,
Already Autumn's fiery finger laid
On heath and marsh and woodland far and wide
In all their gorgeous pageantry has arrayed
The tranquil beauties of the countryside.
Here every prospect pleases, and the spot,
Unspoilt, unvulgarised by man, remains,
Thanks largely to a System which has not
Accelerated or improved its trains.
Yet even here, amid untroubled ways,
Far from the city's fevered, tainted breath,
Yon distant plume of yellow smoke betrays
The ceaseless labours of the mills of death.
“William Arthur Fletcher, ship's apprentice, of South Shields,
was remanded for a week on a charge of being absent from his
ship. His captain alleged that he had found Fletcher asleep on the
bridge.”—Daily Dispatch.
It must have been his mind that was absent.
“At St. Peter's, Vere Street, where he is going to preach from
the 30th of this month to the end of this year, the Rev. R. J. Camp-
bell will speak from the pulpit of Frederick Denison Maurice, like
himself a convert to the Church of England . . . To hear him was
an experience never forgotten.”—Guardian.
And this although MAURICE rarely preached for more than
one month on end.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I can't help thinking that Gyp, the central figure in
Mr. John GALsworthy's new story, Beyond (HEINEMANN),
was unhappy in her encounters with the opposite sex. But
if memory serves me this is an experience familiar to
Mr. GALsworthy's heroines. Men were always wanting
to kiss Gyp, or to marry her, or both, and after a time
kept going off and repeating the process with somebody
else; so that one can't fairly be astonished if towards the
end of the book her outlook had become rather cynical.
The character who might have preserved her estimate of
mankind in general, and the best and most sympathetically
drawn figure in the book, is Gyp's perfectly delightful old
father, who throughout the conspicuous failure of her two
unions, legitimate and other, retained his fine and chivalrous
regard and unfailing care for a daughter who might well
have been a thorn in the flesh of a conventional parent.
But the relations of these two were never conventional.
Gyp had been herself a love-child, and the knowledge of
this is shown very clearly in its influence upon their
mutual attitude. As for her own affairs, these were, first
—to her father's unbounded astonishment—marriage with
a temperamental violinist, who ran rapidly down the scale
from adoration of his own wife to intrigue with another's;
second, clandestine relations with a man of her own race and
breed, who loved her to idolatry, and within a few months
was found embracing his cousin. Poor Gyp 1 Ijest; but you
will need no telling that for sincerity and beauty of writing
here is a book that you cannot afford to miss. Sometimes
I am a little uncertain what Mr. GALsworthy is driving
at, but I never fail to admire his drive.
Unless Mr. S. P. B. MAIs learns to curb his enthusiasms
and to rid himself of certain prejudices he will be wantonly
seeking trouble. Rebellion (GRANT RICHARDs) is in some
respects a more thoughtful and promising book than Inter-
lude, but it is marred by what can only be called the same
narrow point of view. With everybody and everything
modern Mr. MAIs shows an ardent sympathy, but if he is
ever to give a comprehensive picture of life he must con-
trive to be more patient with the old-fashioned. Here his
strong personality obtrudes itself too often, and he is in-
clined to forget that he is a novelist and not a preacher. I
could imagine him throwing off a fine comminatory sermon
from the text, “Cursed be he who does not admire the genius"
of Mr. CoMPTON MACKENZIE.” This homily is drawn from
me with reluctance, because in the main I am a strong
believer in Mr. MAIs, and (with his connivance) have every
intention of retaining that attitude. With all its faults
Rebellion remains gloriously distinct from the rubbish-heap
of fiction by virtue of its intense sincerity and its frequent
flashes of fine descriptive writing. The question of sex
dominates it, and those of us who still think that such
problems are merely sustenance for the prurient-minded
may cast it impatiently aside. But others who like to watch
a clever man feeling his way towards the light, and
regard a novel as neither a bait nor a bauble, can be confi-
dently advised to read it. They may be irritated, but they
will be intrigued.
On the cover of One Woman's Hero (METHUEN) you will
read that “This book has been designed to cheer and
strengthen those for whom, from bereavement owing to
the War, the days and nights are sometimes only a pro-
cession of sad and torturing visions.” Which of course

disarms criticism, other than what may be expressed in a
question whether a book less exclusively preoccupied by
the War might not more surely have attained this end.
But again, of course, maybe it wouldn't. The tale (for all
our pretendings) is not yet written that can actually bring
oblivion to bereavement, so perhaps the next best thing is
topical chatter of the bright and unsentimental kind with
which Miss SYBIL CAMPBELL LETHBRIDGE has filled her
entertaining pages. Chatter is the only term for it, though
it is quite good of its style; the form being a series of
letters written to a friend by the young wife of a soldier at
the front. Her neighbours, their households and dinners
and affectations and courage, are what she writes about;
especially do I commend her handling of the “Let us
Forget and Forgive" tribe. To all such (and most of us
know at least one) I should suggest the posting of a copy of
One Woman's Hero, with the page turned down (an act
permissible in so good a cause) at the report of the
annihilation of one of these well-intentioned but infuriating
philosophers. The combined logic and equity of this suggest
that the Government might do worse than commandeer
the services of Miss LETHBRIDGE as a dinner-table pro-
to Harrogate (where a very pretty piece of philandering
ensued), do not amount to much when seriously considered,
but it is one of Mrs. BARNES-GRUNDY's strong points that
you cannot take her seriously. I am on her side all the
time when she is giving me light comedy, but when she
leaves that vein and bathes her heroine in tears I cannot
conjure up any real sympathy. I never for a moment
doubted that Charmian's lover, though reported as having
“died from wounds,” would turn up again. I am afraid the
War is responsible for a great deal of rather obvious fiction.
Miss MARIE HARRISON has investigated the condition of
Ireland, and in Dawn in Ireland (MELRose) she presents
the results of her studies. The book is inspired by a great
deal of the right kind of enthusiasm, and the advice given
is so excellent as to arouse the fear that it will not be taken.
Yet Miss HARRIsoN is justified of her endeavours. She
shows how often the English governors of Ireland have
failed, in spite of the best intentions, only because they
applied their remedy too late and thus, to their own great
surprise, wasted the generosity of which they were perhaps
too conscious. According to Miss HARRISON the gom-

done, to add to the bitterness of the cup, Ben's wife
is reported dead. Whereafter the king in a drunken fit
isons himself, and the widow, fearing to be suspect, flies
with her big Ben to his secret Nobody's Island (HURST AND
BLACKETT), off the New Guinea coast, where they live com-
fortably off ambergris. Eventually tracked down by the
dead king's brother, who allows himself to be persuaded of
Edith's innocence on what seems to me the most inadequate
evidence, the lovers, after protracted mental agonies and
physical dangers, are about to enjoy deserved peace when
Ben's wife turns up again, necessitating further separation;
till finally Edith, with a handsome babe and the news that
after all Ben's first wife wasn't a wife at all, finds her way
back to Nobody's Island. Now that does seem to be
rather overdoing it. But I hasten to credit the writer
with a very happy gift of description, which brings the
Papuan forests and mountains (or something plausibly like
them) vividly before the reader, while the characters,
including a boy villain ingenuously bizarre, are amusing
puppets capably manipulated.
Mrs. BARNEs-GRUNDY possesses a wonderful supply of
sprightly humour. Her Mad Month (HUTCHINsoN) is funny
without being flippant, and although the heroine is very
naughty she is never naughty enough to shock her creator's
unhyphened namesake. Perhaps Charmian's exploits in es-
caping from a severe grandmother, and going unchaperoned
indeed, the work of the Irish Agricultural Organisation
Society, over which he has presided, has been an unmixed
benefit to Ireland. I heartily endorse Miss HARRISON's hope
that “at no distant period all will be well with Ireland.”
Her book should certainly help towards this result.
Captain WERE SHORTT fell at Loos in September of 1915,
and left twelve chapters of a story, The Rod of the Snake
(LANE), which his sister has finished and very capably
finished; helped by the recollection of many intimate con-
versations about the plot and its development. It tells
how young Charlie Shandross, bidding his preposterous
soldier uncle be hanged, shook the stale dust of Ballybar
off his feet, served three years in the C.M.R., and so pre-
pared himself for the deadly adventure of the rod of the
snake, the image of the ape, the Haytian attaché and the
sinister priestess of Voodoo rites—Paris its setting. I won't
spoil your pleasure by giving the details away; I will only
say it is all very splendidly incredible, but not unplausible,
and the authors do take pains with their puzzles, as where
the hero and his party find the secret spring of the panel in
the vault by the blood tracks of their enemy, who has been
thoughtfully wounded in the hand. A small point but
significant; too many writers in this kind being given to
whisking their favourites out of danger in the most arbitary
manner. A good railway book, of the sort you can con-
fidently pass on to the soldiers' hospitals after reading it.

SOCIETY NOTES.
By The Hanger-on.
AIR-RAIDS AND OTHER DIVERSIONs.
A PROMISING young poet of my acquaintance, who in the
midst of war's obsessions still finds time and taste for the
exercise of his art (he is in a Government office), has
allowed me to see the opening couplet of what I understand
to be a very ambitious poem. It runs as follows:—
“Though overhead the Gothas buzz, -
Stands London where it did 2 It does.” -
Many good judges of poetry to whom I have quoted these
lines think them very clever.
A witty friend of mine tells me that he is thinking of
bringing out a handy and up-to-date edition of the Alman-
ach de Gotha, special attention being paid to the changes
of the Moon. - -
Society is always on the look-out for some new distrac-
tion from the tedium of War. The latest vogue with smart
people is to get up little air-raid parties for the Tube, to be
followed by auction or a small boy-and-girl dance. Sections
of tunnel or platform can be engaged beforehand by arrange-
ment with the Constabulary.
I hear that my friend, ARTHUR BourchIER, continues to
draw crowds to the Oxford. I was dining the other day
with a young and brilliant officer, who has seen two months'
active service in the A.S.C. and won golden opinions at the
Base, and he assured me that there is no “Better 'Ole "
than the Oxford during an air-raid.
Now that London is part of the Front, with a barrage of
its own, one has to be careful to censor one's correspond-
ence. It is advisable not to mention your actual address,
but just to write “Somewhere in the West-End. B.S.F.”
(British Sedentary Force).
The Winter season has begun exceptionally early. Last
Sunday at Church Parade I saw Lady “Nibs” Tattenham,
looking the very image of her latest photograph in The
Prattler, where she appears with her pet Pekie over the
legend, “Deeply interested in War-work.”
A gallant Contemptible has been complaining to me that
the Press shows no sense of proportion in the space that it
allots to air-raids. Our casualties from that source, he said,
are never one-tenth as heavy as those in France on days
when G.H.Q. reports “Everything quiet on the Western
Front.” I naturally disagreed with his attitude. Nothing,
I told him, is more likely to discourage the Hun than to
see column after column in our papers proving that these
visitations leave us totally unmoved. Besides it must be
very comforting to our troops in the trenches to learn in
detail how their dear ones at home are sharing the perils
of the other fronts. In any case nobody who knows our
Press would doubt the purity of their motive in reporting
as many air-raid horrors as the Censor permits.
A propos of the Patriotic Press, no praise can be too
high for some of our society weeklies. They have set their
faces like flint against any serious reference to the War.
When I see them going imperturbably along the old pre-
war lines, snapping smart people at the races or in the Row,
or reproducing the devastating beauty of a revue chorus, I
know that they have their withers unwrung and their heart
in the right place. I always have one of these papers on
my table to be taken as a corrective after the daily casualty
lists. -
A striking feature of the Photographic Press is to be seen
in the revival of the vie intime of popular idols of the stage.
The human life of our great actors and actresses as revealed
in some simple rustic villeggiatura has always had a fasci-
nation for a public that does not enjoy the privilege of their
private friendship. And in these strenuous War-days it is
well to bring home to the theatre-goer how necessary is
domestic repose for those who are doing their courageous
bit to keep the nation from dwelling on the inconveniences
of Armageddon. - - - -
One of the most profound after-the-war questions that
is agitating the mind of the Government is what eventually
to do with the miles of wooden and concrete villages that
have sprung up all over London like JoNAH's mushroom. I
hear a rumour that the House of Commons tea-terrace will
shortly be commandeered for the erection of yet another
block of buildings to accommodate yet another Ministry—
the Ministry of Demobilization of Temporary Departmental
Hutments. - - O. S.

convey guests to the dormitories. Constant supply of
fresh ozone. Reduced terms to season ticket holders.
HôTEL EMBANKMENT. -
All lines converge to this Hotel, which is therefore the
most central in London. Frequent trains convey visitors
direct to their beds. For the convenience of patrons
arriving above ground or by District, the Directors have
installed a superb moving staircase, thereby obviating the
inconvenience of crowded lifts.
The platforms and passages are tastefully decorated with
coloured pictures by the leading firms.
Visitors are respectfully requested not to sleep on the
moving staircase.
HôTEL PICCADILLY CIRCUS.
IN THE HEART OF FASHIONABLE, LONDON.
This Hotel, which is one of the deepest in London, is
composed of four magnificent platforms and nearly a mile
of finely tessellated corridors. Electric light. Constant
temperature of sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit. Excellent
catering under the control of the Automatic Machine Com-
pany. Reduced terms during moonless nights.
HôTEL HAMPSTEAD TUBE.
Situated in a commanding position, underlooking the
Heath, this hotel is positively the deepest in London.
The Management has decided to extend the accommodation
during one week in each month by offering beds on the
steps of the staircase. No one has ever been known to
walk either up or down this staircase, and patrons are
therefore assured of an uninterrupted night's repose.
Extremely moderate terms are quoted for the higher flights.

IT began like the noise of rushing
water, and for a moment the Brigade

it upon himself to wash the orderly.

CESAR's GIRAFFE. B.C. 46.
FROM Egypt, Africa and Gaul
C.Esan his Roman triumph brings:
Darkgueens and ruddy-bearded kings,
And scowling Britons led in thrall,
And elephants with silver rings;
But oh, more excellent than all,
This pensive beast, this mottled beast,
From the marshes of the East.
Patres conscripti, hail him now
Divine! Through Rome his triumph
rolls; -
Oysters in barrels, pearls in bowls,
Chariots and horsemen, moving slow
Where purple garlandsdroop on poles.
Patres conscripti, crown his brow,
Who brought us from the golden East
This unimagined peerless beast!
Never has CESAR made our foes
Weep more than he has made us
laugh;
He who divides the world in half
With the long shadow of his nose,
And bridges oceans with his staff,
Brings now, with pomp of vine and rose,
This wondering and wondrous beast
From the subjugated East.
In bronze and basalt let us raise
The bust of CESAR ; he has done
Great things for Rome; but here is

Above the rest, o'ertopping praise.
The elephants and kings are gone,
But still the roaring tumult sways—
Much for the Conqueror of the East,
More for the incomparable beast.
AN INVOLUNTARY RAID,
LIFE in a convalescent hospital for
officers is not one continuous round of
gaiety, but it has its incidents for all
that.
The other day Sister took Haynes,
Ansell and myself to have tea with
some people in the neighbouring village
of Little Budford. We were waiting in
the hall for the car when Seymour
came along. Seymour is an adjutant
when he is not at home, and he likes
to see things done with proper military
precision.
“Here,” he said, “you can't go off
casually like that. Fall in, tea-party.”
We fell in, and he went to the smok-
ing-room and woke Major Stanley.
“Party for tea ready for inspection,
Sir,” he reported.
“Who 2 What 2 Where 2'' asked the
Major confusedly. “Good Lord, you
young idiot, what a scare you gave me!
Thought I was back in France for a
moment. Where's this party paraded ?”
“Hout in the 'all, Sir.” Seymour
led him to where we were standing at
ea.Se.
“Party!” he roared. “Shunsu-
were !” We gave two convulsive jerks.
“Smarten up there, smarten HUP! Get
a move on T This ain't a waxwork.
Shunsuwere ! . . . Shun' ſ Party pre-
sent, Sir.”
The Major inspected us.
“I don't like this smear, Sergeant,”
he said, pointing to Ansell's upper lip.
Seymour examined the feature in
question. -
“It don't appear to be dirt, Sir.
Some sort o' growth, I think. You
try sand-papering it, me lad, an' you'll
find it come orf all right.”
“Very good, Sergeant,” answered
Ansell solemnly. - -
The Major proceeded to Haynes, and
eyed him with disfavour.
“We can't do nothing with this man,
Sir,” said Seymour deprecatingly. “"Is
legs is that bandy."
“What do you mean, Private Haynes,
by appearing on ceremonial parade
with a pair of bandy legs?”
“It wasn't my fault, Sir. 'Strewth,
it wasn't. They got wet, Sir, an' I
went an' dried 'em at the cook'ouse
fire, Sir, an' they got warped, Sir.”
“Well,” said the Major, “don't bring
'em on parade again. Tell your Q.M.S.
I say you're to have a new pair.”
- “Very good, Sir.”
The Major passed on to me, and sur-
veyed my left arm more in anger than
1n SOrro W.
“Why has this man got his blue
band fastened on with pins 2" he
demanded. “Why isn't it sewn on 2

“Don’t answer me back! Sergeant,

Take his name for insolence. You are
insolent, Sir. You're a disgrace to the
Army. You're a . . .”
“If you've quite finished with my
squad, Major,” put in Sister in a quiet
voice from the door, “the car is here,
and we're late already. I shall have
to push a bit.”
I promptly made for the seat beside
the driver, explaining that I wanted to
see the speedometer burst. Sister
does a good many things, and does
most of them well; but her particular
accomplishment is her motor-driving.
After my experiences in different cars
at the Front—especially those driven
by Frenchmen—I thought at first that
motoring had no new thrills to offer
me; but when Sister takes corners I
still clutch at anything handy.
Surrey began to stream past us. The
* >
landscape was extremely beautiful, but
only the more distant parts of it were
visible except as a mere blur. After
five or six miles we turned into a long
straight stretch of road.
“The Hepworths live somewhere
along this,” said Sister. “There's a
lovely sunken garden just in front of
the house which I want you to notice.
Hallo! here we are; I thought it was
further on.”
The car whizzed round and through
a drive gateway half hidden in trees.
When I opened my eyes again I looked
for the sunken garden; but except for
a few very prim-looking flower-beds the
grounds in front of the house consisted
entirely of a lawn, round which the
drive took a broad circular sweep.
“It must be the wrong house,” said
Sister, and without pausing an instant
in our centrifugal career we rushed
round the complete circle and dis-
appeared through the gate as suddenly
as we had come. As we passed the
house I had a fleeting glimpse of an
old, hard-featured and furious female
face glaring at us from one of the
windows. --
On the road we stopped the car so
as to regain some measure of gravity
before presenting ourselves at our real
destination—next house—but were still
rather hysterical when we arrived.
“You’ll hear more of this,” said our
hostess, when we had reported our
raid. “Old Miss Mendip lives there—
a regular tartar; all kinds of views;
writes to the papers.”
In a subsequent issue ot the local
weekly we found the following:—

I wish to give publicity in your pages
to a disgraceful outrage of which I have
been made the victim. On Tuesday

motor-car. As I did not expect visitors
I proceeded to the window in order to

The “Common Objects of the Farm-

the world of mechanical traction was
comprehended in the generic “puff-

with this very creditable repertoire.
“Out of respect for her father, if for no
other reason,” he would insist, “she
must learn to say ‘aeroplane.’”
“How ridiculous!” said Mummy,

to annoy Henry; “and anyhow it's

But Henry cared for none of these
things, and when Sunday came, and
with it Sunday's promenade and Sun-

as ever.

as the pram was brought to a stand-

A GooD deal of dissatisfaction is ex-
pressed with the state of the cellars to
which people have been invited during
the raids. “Surely,” writes one of our
correspondents, “it is a scandal that,
at this time in the world's history,
some cellars should be totally destitute
of wine. That there should be no coal
in the coal-cellars is understandable
enough ; but to ask the timid public
into empty wine-cellars is a travesty
of hospitality.”

your career you will not take it amiss
if I offer you a few words of practical
advice:—

Always visit the line with a double
mission, one for the right of the line
and one for the left—and see which
they are shelling.
2. If they are strafing all along the

manner when dealing with
all but the very senior. This
will give you what is called
distinction. Charm will
come later.

guess. If wrong, guess again.
5. Always put off on to

wholly to the fact that the bombs fell
on spots where our correspondents
were not standing, although they might
easily have been there had they not

experience is indeed most striking.
Mr. HARold BEGBIE, for example,
who disapproves of soldiers laughing,
happened to be in the country on the
night of the 24th. Had he been in

THE Herald lives in cloister grey;
He lives by clerkly rules;
He dreams in coats and colours gay,
In argent, or and gules;
He blazons knightly shield and banner
In dim monastic hall,
And in a grave and reverend manner
He earns his bread withal.
Were I a herald fair and fit
So featly for to limn
As though I'd learnt the lore of it
Among the seraphim,
I'd leave the schools to clerkly people
And walk, as dawn begins,
From steeple unto distant steeple,
And paint the signs of inns.
The Dragon, as I'd see him, is
A loving beast and long,
And oh, the Goat and Compasses,
'Twould fill my soul with song;
The Bell, The Bull, The Rose and

Such themes should like me still
At Yule, or when the heart of Summer
Lies blue on vale and hill.
Let others' blazonry find place
Supported, scrolled with gold,
A glowing dignity and grace
On honoured walls and old;
And let it likewise be attended
In stately circumstance
With mottos writ o' Latin splendid
Or courtly words of France;
But I would paint The Golden Tun
And others to my mind,
And mellow them in rain and sun,
And hang them on the wind;
And I would say, “My handcraft creak-

On this autumnal gale
Unto all wayſarers is speaking
In praise of rest and ale.”
Then bless the man who puts a sign
Above his wide door's beam,
And bless the hop-root, fruit and

For still I dream my dream,
Where, as the flushing East turns
inker
And tardy day begins,
I take the road like any tinker
And paint the signs of inns.

Going BACK.
“IN these days,” I began, but Francesca interrupted me.
“When anyone starts like that,” she said, “I know he's
going to make the War an excuse for doing something
rather more paltry than usual.” "
“‘Paltry’ is not,” I said, “a very nice word
“I’ll take the phrase back and substitute “rather
noble and generous.’”
“Yes, I like that better. I'll pass it in that form as
your comment on what you haven't yet allowed me to say.”
“Quick,” she said; “what was it? Don't leave me in
suspense.” -
“In these days,” I said, “one mustn't spend too much
on railway companies.”
“True,” she said. “I'm with you there in these or any
other days.” -
“And therefore,” I continued, “it will be quite enough
if one of us accompanies Frederick, our lively ten-year-old,
to begin his second term at school. There is no necessity
whatever for both of us to go with him.”
“Hear, hear!” said Francesca; “your idea is better
than I thought. I will go with Frederick and you can
stay at home and look after the girls.”
“No,” I said firmly, “I will take Frederick, and you must
remain behind and keep an eye on Muriel, Nina and Alice.”
“No,” she said. -
“Yes,” I said; “my eye's not good enough for the job;
it hasn't been trained for it. I should be sure to mislay
one of the girls, and then you'd never forgive yourself for
having put upon me a burden greater than I could bear.
Besides,” I added, “goings back to school are in the man's
department, with football, cricket, boxing and things of that
kind.”
“And what,” she said scornfully, “are you graciously
pleased to leave in my department 2 ”
“Oh, I thought you knew. I leave to you table-
manners, tidiness (that's a tough one), hand-washing
(that's a tougher), reading aloud from KIPLING and tucking
him up in bed.” - - - -
“Quite a good list, if by no means a complete one ; but
in these days one mustn't be too critical. Anyhow it proves
that I must take the boy back to school.”
“It proves just the contrary.”
“No,” she said, “it proves what ought to be there by
leaving it out.” - - - . - -
“That,” I said, “is a record even for you, Francesca.”
“Well, it's logical anyway. How, for instance, could
you talk to the Matron 2 You'd be utterly lost before you'd
been at it for half a minute.” - - -
“Don't you worry about that,” I said. “I have accom-
plishments of which you don't seem to be aware, and one
of them is talking to Matrons at preparatory schools.”
“Anyhow, you're not going to have a chance of showing
it off this time, because I am going to take the boy back to
school. That's final.” -
It was, and in due time Francesca took the boy back.
Her account of the farewell moments was not without a
certain amount of pathos, several other mothers and their
boys being involved in the valedictory scene. Four or five
days afterwards, however, we received the following letter,
which put to flight any idea that Frederick might be
pining:—
“I am very happy this term, and I am getting on fairly
well in my work. I like football much better than cricket.
I have three or four times just not got a goal, once it was
when I kicked into goal the goal-keeper (3 st. 4 lb. 1) rushed
out and kicked it away, and once when we were playing
Blues and Reds, and I was on the Blue side, and I man-
less
aged by good luck to get through a crowd of shouting Reds
and followed it up amidst shouts from the Blues and shot
it to the Red goal; but the goalkeeper (a different one)
came out and hit it away, at which I twisted my knee and
collapsed (not with pain, because it wasn't anything, but
with anger and desparation 1) Am I to learn boxing this

I should like to have seen the bold goalkeeper of 3 st. 4 lb.

YESTERDAY IN OXFORD STREET.
YESTERDAY in Oxford Street, oh, what d'you think, my dears?
I had the most exciting time I've had for years and years;
The buildings looked so straight and tall, the sky was blue
between, -
And, riding on a motor-bus, I saw the fairy queen!
Sitting there upon the rail and bobbing up and down,
The sun was shining on her wings and on her golden crown;
And looking at the shops she was, the pretty silks and lace—
She seemed to think that Oxford Street was quite a lovely
place.
And once she turned and looked at me and waved her little
hand,
But I could only stare and stare, oh, would she understand?
I simply couldn't speak at all, I simply couldn't stir,
And all the rest of Oxford Street was just a shining blur.
Then suddenly she shook her wings—a bird had fluttered
by—
And down into the street she looked and up into the sky,
And perching on the railing on a tiny fairy toe
She flashed away so quickly that I hardly saw her go.
I never saw her any more, although I looked all day;
Perhaps she only came to peep and never meant to stay;
But oh, my dears, just think of it, just think what luck
for me

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I THINK I prefer Mr. WELLs's recent essay in the Newest-
Theology to this too concrete illustration of The Soul of a
Bishop (CASSELL). It's not that I object to the irreverence
of stripping a poor tired bishop of cassock and gaiters,
pursuing him to a sleepless bed and cinematographing all
his physical twistings and turnings, his moral misgivings,
his torturing doubts. I owe too much to Mr. WELLs'
irreverences to mind that sort of thing; and I must say
that, for a man who can't have had very much to do with
the episcopacy in his busy life, he does manage to give a
confoundedly plausible atmosphere to the whole setting.
There are two letters from an older bishop to Dr. Scrope,
the one, yieldingly tolerant, to dissuade him from resigna-
tion, the other, written after the accomplished fact, with
touches of exquisitely restrained yet palpable malice, which
strike me as masterly projections. Mr. WELLs also con-
trives a wonderful impressiveness in certain passages of the
bishop's three visions. But I can't, even after careful re-
reading, see the point of making the bishop's enlightenment
depend upon a mysterious drug. This has an effect of
impishness. There is nothing in Dr. Scrope's development
that might not have taken place without this fantastic
assistance . . . I suppose the general suggestion of this
rather wayward and hasty but conspicuously sincere book
is, that if only an occasional bishop would secede it would
make it easier for the plain man to listen to the rest. And
there may be something in this.
To those who are in love with Mr. W. J. LocKE's incur-
able romanticism or who have a taste for heroines that
“stiffen in a sudden stroke of passion looking for the instant
electrically beautiful,” let me commend The Red Planet
(LANE). As a matter of fact Betty, the heroine, is quite a
dear, and the narrator, Major Meredyth, a maimed hero of
the Boer War, who looks at this one from the tragic angle
of an invalid chair, is, apart from a habit of petulant and
not very profound grousing at Governments in The Daily
Rail manner, a sport who thoroughly deserves the reward
of poor widowed Betty's hand on the last page but one.
Perhaps he does not show a very ready understanding of
the phenomenon of physical cowardice in the case of a
brother-officer, though later he makes amends. But I take
it that it was Mr. LocKE's idea to present a very ordinary
decent sort with the common man's prejudices and frank
distrust of subtleties. A sinister mystery of love, death
and blackmail runs, a turbid undercurrent, through the
story. The publisher's pathetic apology for the drab grey
paper on which, in the interests of War Economy, the book
is printed, makes one wonder how the other publishers who
still issue books in black and white manage to live.
Of the literary reputations that the War has, so to
speak, dug in, I suppose none to be more firmly consoli-
dated than that of Mr. PATRICK MACGILL. The newest of
his several battle-books is The Brown Brethren (JENRINs),
a title derived from the campaigning colour that has
amended a popular quotation till it should now read “the
thin brown line of heroes.” I can hardly tell you any-

| title of the story is mis-
| leading. There is no Court,
thing about Mr. MACGILL's new book that you have not
probably read or said for yourself of the previous volumes.
For my own part, if the War is to be written about at all
(a question concerning which I preserve an open mind), I
say let it be, as here, the real thing, and the hotter and
stronger the better. There is rough humour in these
sketches of soldier types, and just enough story to thread
them together; but it is the fighting that counts. Certain
chapters, for example that about Benner's struggle with
the Hun sniper, seem to leave one bruised and breathless
as from personal conflict. Mr. MACGILL writes about war
as he knows it, horribly, in a way that carries conviction
like a charge of bayonets, and with an entire disregard of
the sensibilities of the stay-at-home reader. For all which
reasons The Brown Brethren and their French friends are
assured of the success that they certainly deserve. Here's
wishing them the best of it !

understand, vexed with sex instincts of the type of the
modern novel, and so in a large measure she failed, even
though she sacrificed strength, happiness and even her
own love-story in the effort to keep them straight. The
tale is set out with every circumstance of sordid misery, in
which the spiritual beauty of the heroine is meant to shine,
and undeniably does shine with real strength and purity.
The successive deaths of the mother and step-mother, the
shabby London lodgings, the fall of Veronica, the selfish-
ness of Beat's boy-friend, and the loathsome trade of her
lover—these, and more horrors and lapses beside, are all
taxed for the general effect in so able and vivid a fashion
that the authoress succeeds to admiration in making her
readers nearly as uncomfortable as her characters, long
before the climax is reached. The end comes rather less
wretchedly than could have been expected, but even so
surely, this is genius partly run to seed. The greatest
tragedies are not written in these minor keys. Beat,
woman and heroine, is so admirable that one fain would
- - know her apart from all this
unredeemed welter of sex
and selfishness.
I confess I should have
thought that the fictional
possibilities of being as like
as two peas to Royalty were
fairly exhausted. But ap-
parently Mr. EDGAR JEPson
does not share this view ;
and it is only fair to admit
that in The Professional
|Prince (HUTCHINson) he
has contrived to give a
novel twist to the already
well laboured theme. Prince
Richard (precise nationality

of a convenient double, he

dred a year and pickings,

º:
has written a moving appeal to the
tions with bewildering mystery, is essentially good and,
I believe, new, though far be it from me to do either Mr.
WHITE or the reader the disservice of saying what it is.
Suffice that we are introduced to some quite charming
people, as well as two extremely unpleasant ones, and if the
web of mystery is held together in places by a somewhat
generous share of obtuseness on the part of the persons
concerned it is not for us to complain, since we become
aware of the defect only after the affair is over.
Apart from the greater complaint that I do not like her
subject, which probably is entirely my own fault, I have
nothing but praise for Mrs. STANLEY WRENCH's latest volume,
Beat (DUCKworTH), except as regards her amazing fondness
for drooping the corners of her characters' mouths, gener-
ally either “wistfully” or “sullenly.” It only made one
annoyed when Beatriz's unpleasant sisters developed the
trick, but when poor little Beat herself was affected that
way, in spite of the magnificent courage with which she
faced the burden of deputy-motherhood, it made one miser-
able as well. The task she had undertaken was a pro-
digious one, for the sisters she had to rear were, you must

reported by photograph as depressingly plain, whom
political considerations have marked as the Prince's
fiancée. When later one of the characters points out to
His Highness that this conduct showed some lapse from
the finer ideals of taste, I am bound to say that I could
find no words of contradiction. However the originality |
arrives when John Stuart, the deputy, instead of falling in
love with the bride-elect in Ruritanian fashion, develops a |
marked liking for the prosaic side of his job, and insists
upon lecturing his supposed relations upon the political |
crisis of the moment. Capital fun this. When the fiancée
in her turn proved wholly different from the photograph I
permitted myself to hope that we were in for a double
masquerade—but this was to expect too much. Still,
Mr. JEPsoN has handled his wildly-preposterous plot with
great verve; and even if the central situation is one that
has been often encountered before, this only proves again
that HoPE springs eternal. . . . But I wish he had avoided
the War. -

MoDEL DIALOGUES FOR AIR-RAIDS.
[A few specimen conversations are here suggested as suitable for
the conditions which we have lately experienced. The idea is to
discourage the Hun by ignoring those conditions or explaining them
away. For similar conversations in actual life blank verse would not
of course be obligatory.] I - -
BEAUTIFUL weather for the time of year!
A perfect spell, indeed, of halcyon calm, -
Most grateful here in Town, and, what is more,
A priceless gift to our brave lads in France,
Whose need is sorer, being sick of mud.
. They have our first thoughts ever, and, if Heaven
Had not enough good weather to go round,
Gladly I’d sacrifice this present boon
And welcome howling blizzards, hail and flood,
So they, out there, might still be warm and dry.
II. -
. Have you observed the alien in our midst,
How strangely numerous he seems to-day, ... .
Swarming like migrant swallows from the East 2
. I take it they would fain elude the net
Spread by Conscription's hands to haul them in.
All day they lurk in cover Houndsditch way,
Dodging the copper, and emerge at night
To snatch a breath of Occidental air
And drink the ozone of our Underground.
III.
. How glorious is the Milky Way just now !
. True. In addition to the regular stars
I saw a number flash and disappear.
E. I too. A heavenly portent, let us hope,
Presaging triumph to our British arms.
IV.
. Methought I heard yestreen a loudish noise
Closely resembling the report of guns.
Ay, you conjectured right. Those sounds arose
From anti-aircraft guns engaged in practice
Against the unlikely advent of the Hun.
One must be ready in a war like this
To face the most remote contingencies.
. Something descended on the next back-yard,
Spoiling a dozen of my neighbour's tubers.
. No doubt a live shell mixed among the blank;
Such oversights from time to time occur
lºven in Potsdam, where the casual sausage
Perishes freely in a few de joie.
V
We missed you badly at our board last night.
. The loss was mine. I could not get a cab.
Whistling, as you're aware, is banned by law,
And when I went in person on the quest
The streets were void of taxis.
A.
B.
And to what
Do you attribute this unusual dearth 2
K. The general rush to Halls of Mirth and Song,
Never so popular. The War goes well,
And London's millions needs must find a way
To vent their exaltation–else they burst.
. But could you not have travelled by the Tube 2
. I did essay the Tube, but found it stuffed.
The atmosphere was solid as a cheese,
And I was loath to penetrate the crowd
Lest it should shove me from behind upon
The electric rail.
#
J. Can you account for that ?
K. I should ascribe it to the harvest moon,
. . That wakes romance in Metropolitan breasts,
. Drawing our young war-workers out of town
... To seek the glamour of the country lanes
Under the silvery beams to lovers dear.
O. S.
Force of HABIT.
THE fact that George had been eighteen months in
Gallipoli, Egypt and France, without leave home till now,
should have warned me. As it was I merely found myself
gasping “Shell-shock!” -- .
We were walking in a crowded thoroughfare, and George
was giving all the officers he met the cheeriest of “Good
mornings.” It took people in two ways. Those on leave,
|blushing to think they had so far forgotten their B.E.F.
habits as to pass a brother-officer without some recogni-
tion, replied hastily by murmuring the conventional “How
are you?” into some innocent civilian's face some yards
behind us. Mere stay-at-homes, on the other hand, sur-
prised into believing that they ought to know him, stopped
and became quite effusive. As far as I can remember George
accepted three invitations to dinner from total strangers
rather than explain, and I was included in one of them.
We were for the play that night and I foresaw difficulties
at the public telephone, and George's first remark of
“Hullo, hullo, is that Signals? Put me through to His
Majesty's,” confirmed my apprehensions. -
Half-an-hour of this kind of thing produced in me a
strong desire for peace and seclusion. A taxi would have
solved my difficulty (had I been able to solve the taxi
difficulty first), but George himself anticipated me by
suddenly holding up a private car and asking for a lift. I
could have smiled at this further lapse had not the owner,
a detestable club acquaintance whom I had been trying
to keep at a distance for years, been the driver. He was
delighted, and I was borne away conscious of twenty years'
work undone by a single stroke.
Peace and seclusion at the club afforded no relief how-
ever. George was really very trying at tea. He accused
the bread because the crust had not a hairy exterior
(generally accumulated by its conveyance in a blanket or
sandbag). He ridiculed the sugar ration—I don't believe
he has ever been short in his life; and the resources of the
place were unequal to the task of providing tea of sufficient
strength to admit of the spoon being stood upright in it—a
consistency to which, he said, he had grown accustomed.
When I left him he was bullying the hall-porter of the
club for a soft-nosed pencil; ink, he explained, being an
abomination.
I also saw him pay 24d. for a Daily Mail.
:: ::: ::: ::: :: * ::: x:
I got a letter from George just before he went back. He
patronized me delightfully —seemed more than half a
Colonial already. He said he was glad to have seen us all
again, but was equally glad to be getting back, as he was
beginning to feel a little homesick. He hinted we were dull
dogs and treated people we didn't know like strangers.
Didn't we ever cheer up 2 He became very unjust, I
thought, when he said that France was at war, but that
we had only an Army and Navy.
Incidentally I had to pay twopence on the letter, the
postman insisting that George's neat signature in the
bottom left-hand corner of the envelope was an insufficient
substitute for a penny stamp.
“The raiders came in three suctions.”—Evening News.
So that was what blocked the Tubes.

LXVI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Here is a war,
producing great men, and here am I
writing to you from time to time about
it and never mentioning one of them.
I have touched upon Commanding
Officers, Brigadiers, Divisional, Corps,
even Army Commanders; I have gone
so far as to mention the CoMMANDER-IN-
CHIEF once and I have mentioned myself
very many times. But the really great
men I have omitted. I mean the really,
really great men, without whom the
War could not possibly go on, and with
whom, I am often led to suppose, the
decision remains as to what day Peace
shall be declared. Take the A.M.L.O.
at for example.
Now, Charles, be it understood that
I am not saying anything for or against
the trade of Assisting Military Landing
Officers; I have no feeling with regard
to it one way or the other. For all I
know it may require a technical know-
ledge so profound that any man who
can master it is already half-way on
the road to greatness. On the other
hand, it may require no technical know-
ledge at all, and, the whole of a Mili-
tary Landing Officer's duties being
limited to watching other people work-
ing, the Assistant Military Landing
Officer's task may consist of nothing
more complicated than watching the
Military Landing Officer watching the
military land. If this is so, the work
may be so simple that, once a man has
satisfied the very rigid social test to be
passed by all aspirants to so distin-
guished a position, he must simply be
a silly ass if he doesn't automatically
become a great man, after a walk or
two up and down the quay. I repeat,
I know nothing whatever of the call-
ing of A.M.L.O., and I could not tell
you without inquiry whether it is an
ancient and honourable profession or
an unscrupulous trade very jealously
watched by the Law. I have some
friends in it and I have many friends
out of it, and the former should not be
inflated with conceit nor the latter un-
duly depressed when I pronounce the
deliberate opinion that the best known
and greatest thing in the B.E.F. is
without doubt the A.M.L.O. at —.
Though it is months since I cast
eyes on him, I can see him now, stand-
ing self-confidently on his own private
quay, with the most chic of Virginian
cigarettes smouldering between his
aristocratic lips and the very latest
and most elegant of Bond Street Khaki
Neckwear distinguishing him from
the mixed crowd about him. Every
one else is distraught; even matured
|Generals, used to the simple and irre-
sponsible task of commanding troops
in action, are a little unnerved by the
difficulties and intricacies of embarking
oneself militarily. He on whom all
the responsibility rests remains aloof.
A smile, half cynical, plays across his
proud face. He knows he has but to
flick the ash from his cigarette and the
Army will spring to attention and the
Navy will get feverishly to work. He
has but to express consent by the in-
clination of his head and sirens will
blow, turbine engines will operate as
they would never operate for anybody
else, thousands of tons of shipping
will rearrange itself, and even the sea
will become less obstreperous and more
circumspect in its demeanour, adjust-
ing, if need be, its tides to suit his
wishes.
I take it my condition is typical
when I am “proceeding” (one will
never come and go again in our time;
one will always proceed)—when I am
proceeding to the U.K. The whole
thing is too good to believe, and I don't
believe it till I have some written and
omnipotent instructions in my pocket
and am actually moving towards the
sea. The youngest and keenest school-
boy returning home for his holidays
is a calm, collected, impassionate and
even dismal man of the world com-
pared to me. I see little and am im-
pressed by nothing; all things and
men are assumed to be good, and none

the bulwark nearest the quay, from
which I may gaze at his august Excel-
lency for the few remaining hours dur-
ing which it is given us to linger in or
near our well-beloved France.
How came it about, I ask myself,
that the Right Man got to be in the
Right Place? It cannot have been
merely fortuitous that he was not
thrust away into some such obscure
job as the command of an Expedition-
ary Force or the control of the counsels
of the Imperial General Staff. It must
have been the deliberate choice of a
wise chooser; Major-General Military
Landing himself, the SECRETARY OF
STATE for WAR on his own, even His
MAJESTY in person 2 Or was a plébi-

I watch him keep a perturbed and
restless Major from the line waiting
while he finishes his light - hearted
badinage with a subordinate. It is
altogether magnificent in its sheer
sangfroid. Why is it that such a one
is labelled merely A.M.L.O., when he
should obviously be the M.L.O.” He
has his subordinate, happily insignifi-
cant and obsequiously proud to serve.

DUKE WILLIAM's FALCoS. A.D. 1065.
UPoN a marsh beside the sea,
With hawk and hound and vassals three,
Rode WILLIAM, Duke of NorMANDY,
The heir of Rover Rollo ;
And ever as his falcon flew
Quoth he “Mark well, by St. MACLou,
For where she hovers hasten you,
And where she falls I follow.”
She rose into the misty sky,
A brooding menace hid on high,
Ere she dipped earthward suddenly
As dips the silver swallow ;
Then, spurring through the rushes
grey, , ,
Cried WILLIAM, “Sirs, away, away !
For where she hovers is the prey,
And where she falls I follow.”
Her marbled plume with crimson dight,
Seaward she soared, and bent her flight
Above the ridge of foaming white
Along the harbour hollow ;
Then, looking grimly toward the strait,
Said WILLIAM, “Truly, soon or late,
There where she hovers is my fate,
And where she falls I follow.”
THE CAVE-DWELLERS.
“IF you please, ma'am, that funny-
looking gentleman with the long hair
has brought his jug for some more
water. And could you oblige him with
a little pepper ?”
“Certainly not,” said my wife. “The
man's a nuisance. He is not even
respectable—looks like a gipsy or a
disreputable artist. I'll speak to him
myself.” And she flounced out of the
room.
I felt almost sorry for the man; but
really the thing was overdone when,
not content with overcrowding our vil-
lage, these London people took to living
in dug-outs on the common.
Matilda rushed back into the room
with a metal jug in her hand.
“Oscar! It's old Sheffield plate, and
there's a coat-of-arms on it. Turn up
the heraldry book; look in the index
for ‘bears.' Perhaps they're somebody
after all.”
Matilda is a second cousin once
removed of the Drewitts—one of the
best baronetcies in England—and nat-
urally we take an interest in Heraldry.
“Yes, here it is. A cave-bear ram-
pant Oscar, it's the crest of the
Cave-Canems, one of the oldest families
in Britain, if not the very oldest Poor
things, I feel so sorry for them. Per-
haps I might offer him some vege-
tables.”
“And to think of their having to
live in a cave again after all these cen-
turies,” said my wife when she returned.
“Isn't it pathetic? Oscar, don't you!
think we ought to call on them 2"
We agreed that it was our duty to
call on the distinguished cave-dwellers.
But what ought we to wear? They
dressed very simply; I had seen him
in an old tweed suit and a soft felt hat.
“And his wife,” Matilda said, “is
positively dowdy. But that proves they
are somebody. Only the very best
people can afford to wear shabby clothes
in these times.”
We decided that in our case it was
necessary to recognise the polite usages
of society. So my wife wore her foliage
green silk, and I my ordinary Sabbath
attire.
A fragrant odour of vegetables cook-
ing led us eventually to the little mound
amidst the gorse where our aristocratic
visitors were temporarily residing.
There was some difficulty at first in
attracting their attention, but this I
overcame by tying our visiting-cards to
a piece of string and dangling it down
the tunnel that served as an entrance.
After coughing several times I had a
bite, and the cave-man showed himself.
“Hallo!” I heard him say, laughing,
“it’s the kind Philistines who gave us
the vegetables.” Then aloud, “Come
in. Mind the steps.”
I damaged my hat slightly against
the roof, and I am afraid Matilda's
dress suffered a little, but we managed
to enter their dug-out. The place was
faintly lighted by a sort of window
overlooking the third hole of the de-
serted golf course. Our host intro-
duced his wife.
“We were not really nervous,” said
the lady, “but a fragment of shell
came through the studio window and
destroyed a number of my husband's
pictures. He is a painter of the Neo-
Impressionistic School.”
“What a shame!" said Matilda,
taking up a canvas. “May I look?
Oh! how pretty.”
“My worst enemy has never called
my work that,” said the artist. “Per-
haps you would appreciate it better if
you held it the other way up.”
It is at a moment like this that my
wife shines.
“I should like to see it in a better
light,” she said. “But how interesting !
Everyone paints now - a - days—even
Royalty. My cousin, Sir Ethelwyn
Drewitt, has done some charming
water-colours of the family estates.
Perhaps you know him 2"
Our host shook his head.
“A very old family, like your own,”
said Matilda. “Ourancestors probably
knew each other in the days of Stone-
henge. I, of course, recognised the
coat-of-arms on your plate.”
“I am afraid you are in error,” said
the artist. “My name is Pitts. And
I don't go back beyond my grandfather,
who, honest man, kept a grocer's shop
in Dulwich. The jug you've been
admiring I bought in the Caledonian
Cattle Market for fifteen shillings.”
Matilda swooned. The air was cer-
tainly very close down there.
THE WAR-DREAM.
I wish I did not dream of France
And spend my nights in mortal dread
On miry flats where whizz-bangs dance
And star-shells hover o'er my head,
And sometimes wake my anxious spouse
By making shrill excited rows
Because it seems a hundred “hows”
Are barraging the bed.
I never fight with tigers now
Or know the old nocturnal mares;
The house on fire, the frantic cow,
The cut-throat coming up the stairs
Would be a treat; I almost miss
That feeling of paralysis -
With which one climbed a precipice
Or ran away from bears.
Nor do I dream the pleasant days
That sometimes soothe the worst of
wars,"
Of omelettes and estaminets
And smiling maids at cottage-doors;
But in a vague unbounded waste
For ever hide with futile haste
From 5.9's precisely placed,
And all the time it pours.
Yet, if I showed colossal phlegm
Or kept enormous crowds at bay,
And sometimes won the D.C.M.,
It might inspire me for the fray;
But, looking back, I do not seem
To recollect a single dream
In which I did not simply scream
And try to run away.
And when I wake with flesh that creeps
The only solace I can see
Is thinking, if the Prussian sleeps,
What hideous visions his must bel
Can all my dreams of gas and guns
Be half as rotten as the Hun's 2
I like to think his blackest ones
Are when he dreams of me.

THE DOOR.
ONCE upon a time there was a sitting-
room, in which, when everyone had
gone to bed, the furniture, after its
habit, used to talk. All furniture talks,
although the only pieces with voices that
we human beings can hear are clocks
and wicker-chairs. Everyone has heard
a little of the conversation of wicker-
chairs, which usually turn upon the
last person to be seated in them; but
other furniture is more self-centred.
On the night with which we are now
concerned the first remark was made
by the clock, who stated with a clarity
only equalled by his brevity that it was
one. An hour later he would probably
be twice as voluble.
It was normally the signal for an
outburst of -comment and confidence;
but let me first say that the house in
which this sitting-room was situated
belonged to an elderly gentleman and
his wife, each conspicuous for peaceable
kindliness. Neither would hurt a fly,
but since they had grandsons fighting
for England, honour and the world, it
chanced that they were the incongruous
possessors of quite a number of war
relics, which included an inkstand
made of a steel shell-top, copper shell-
binding and cartridge-cases; a Turkish
cartridge from the Carso; a cigarette-
lighter made of English cartridge-cases;
and several shell-cases transformed into
vases for flowers. One of these at this

CUSS-CONTROL.
I FouxD myself, some time ago,
Growing too fond of cuss-words, so
I made a vow to curb my passions
And put my angry tongue on rations.
As no Controller yet exists
To frame these necessary lists,
I had myself to pick and choose
The words that I could safely use.
Four verbs found favour in my sight,
Viz., “drat" and “dash” and “blow ’’
and “blight”;
While “blithering” and “blinkin’” were
My only adjectival pair.
I freely own that “dash” and “drat"
At times sound lamentably flat;
And “blight” and “blow "don't some-
how seem -
Quite adequate to every theme.
When you are wishful to be withering
'Tis hard to be confined to “blither-
ing,'
And to express explosive thinkin'
One longs for some relief from
“blinkin’.”
Still Mr. BALFour, so I hear,
Seldom goes further than “O dear!”
While moments of annoyance draw
“Bother ” at worst from BonAR LAw.
Hence, if our leaders in their style
Are able to suppress their bile,
And practise noble moderation
In comment and in objurgation,
Why should not I, a doggerel bard,
All futile expletives discard,
And discipline my restive soul
With salutary cuss-control?

OSWALD AND CO.
WE live in a fortress on the crest of
a hill overlooking a little Irish town, a
centre of the pig and potheen industries.
The fortress was, according to tradition,
built by BRIAN Boru, renovated by Sir
WALTER RALEIGH (the tobacconist, not
the professor) and brought up to date
by OLIVER CROMWELL. It has dun-
geons º keeping the butter cool),
loop-holes (through which to pour hot
porridge on invaders), an oubliette (for
bores) and a portcullis.
In spite of these conveniences our
fortress is past its prime and a modern
burglar would treat it as a joke.
so weak in its joints that when the
wind blows it shakes like a jelly, and
we have to shave with safety-razors.
In a small villa opposite lives Freddy,
our married subaltern, and Mrs. Freddy.
On a patch of turf up a neighbouring
lane Oswald and Co. took up their resi-
dence this summer.
The troopers called him Oswald for
some unknown reason, but I doubt if
that was his baptismal name, and I
doubt if he was ever baptized.
Oswald was a tall bony grizzled child
of the Open.
Years ago he would have been dis-
It is
missed briefly as a tramp, but we know
better now; we have read our Georgian
poets and we know that such folk do not
perambulate the country stealing fowls
and firing ricks from any dislike of
settled labour, but because they have
heard the call of far horizons, belles
étoiles and great spaces.
The Co. consisted of a woolly donkey
which carried Oswald's portmanteau
when he trekked, and a hairy dog
which provided him with company
and conversation.
The donkey browsed, unfettered,
about the roadside, taking the weather
as it came; but Oswald and the dog,
degenerates, sheltered under a wigwam
of saplings and old sacks.
The wigwam being four feet long
and Oswald six, he had to telescope
like a tortoise to get fully under cover;
sometimes he forgot his feet and left
them outside all night in the dew, but,
as he had no boots to spoil, this didn't
matter much.
Not having any business to attend
to he lay abed very late. Our troopers,
riding at ease en route to the drill
grounds, would toss their lighted cigar-
ette-ends at the protruding bare feet.
A grizzled head telescoping out of the
other end of the wigwam and a husky | Freddy is given that way. Apparently
voice calling down celestial fury upon
them, would signalise a hit.
The Adjutant was for having Oswald
moved on; we should be missing things
presently, he warned—saddle-blankets,
rifles, horses, perhaps the portcullis.
However, the O.C. would have none of
it; he maintained that this constant
menace at our gates kept the sentries
on the qui vive and accustomed them
to practically Active Service conditions.
So all the summer the wigwam
remained on the turf-patch and the
sentries on the qui vive.
How Oswald existed is a mystery—
probably on manna, for he toiled not
neither span, and if he stole for a living
it was not from us.
He spent his mornings in bed, his
afternoons reclining on the bank behind
his residence, puffing at his dudheen and
watching our recruits going through
the hoops with the amused contempt
that a gentleman of leisure naturally
feels for the working classes.
At the end of September, Freddy,
the Benedick, finding himself in the
orderly-room and forgetting what had
brought him there, applied for leave
as a matter of habit, and, walking out
again, promptly forgot all about it.

the Orderly Room was finding time
heavy on their hands that morning, for
machinery was set in motion, and in
due course the astonished Freddy dis-
covered himself with permission to go
to blazes for seven days and a warrant
to London in his pocket.
He capered whooping home to his
villa, told Mrs. Freddy to pack her
toothbrush and come along, and the
mail bore them hence. Next day the
weather broke, the sky turned upside
down and emptied itself upon us, the
parade ground squelched if you trod
on it, the gutters failed to cope with
the rush of business, and the roads ran
in spate. -
The post-orderly, splashing back to
barracks, reported the disappearance
of Oswald and Co.
We determined that they must have
been washed out to sea and pictured
them astride the wigwam in a beam-
roll off Kinsale, keeping a watchful eye
for U-boats. - -
We had seven days of unrelieved
downpour. On the morning of the
eighth, Freddy and wife returned from
leave, and, opening the front door of the
villa—which they discovered they had
forgotten to lock in the delirium of
their departure—stepped within. At
the same moment, Oswald, the hairy
dog and the woolly donkey heard the
call of the great spaces, and, opening
the back door of the villa, stepped with-
out and departed for haunts unknown.
Freddy in a high state of excitement
came over to the Mess and told us all
about it.
He himself had been all for slaying
Oswald on the spot, he said, but Mrs.
Freddy wouldn't hear of it.
“She says he hasn't stolen any-
thing,” Freddy explained. “She says
he was only staying with us, in a
manner of speaking, and was quite
right to take his poor old dog and
donkey under cover during that rotten
weather, she says—so that's the end
of it.”
But it wasn't the end of it; Freddy
had reckoned without his other O.C.
Here was a heaven-sent opportunity
of training the men under practically
Active Service conditions, scouring the
country after real game—Ho! toot the
clarion, belt the drum ! Boot and
saddle ! Hark away!
So now we are out scouring the
country for Oswald and Co., one hun-
dred men and horses, caparisoned like
Christmas-trees, soaked to the skin, fed
to the teeth. And Oswald and Co.—
where are they? We cannot guess, and
we are very very tired of practically
Active Service conditions.

Thomas (that may not be thine actual name
But it will serve as well as any other),
There be coarse souls to whom all flesh is game,
Who do not hail thee as a new-born brother
But merely as a thing at which to aim
Their fratricidal guns; they simply smother
The sense, which I for one cannot eschew,
Of soul relationship 'twixt man and gnu.
'Tis not, O surely not, for such as these
Those baby limbs are flung in lightsome capers;
Those puny bleatings were not meant to please
Facetious writers for the daily papers;
Let baser beasts inspire the obvious wheeze,
Wombats and wart-hogs, tortoises and tapirs;
These lack the subtle spell thy presence flings
About the spirit tuned to higher things.
Well could I picture thee, a dusky sprite,
With Dryad hoofs on Thracian ledges drumming,
When day is slipping from the arms of might
And all the hushed leaves whisper, “Pan is coming !”
And thou before him, leaping with delight,
Stirring all birds to song, all bees to humming
And buds to blossoming—but lo! at hand
A tablet reads, “C. Gnu. Nyassaland.”
Thus they've described thy formidable sire,
A whiskered person with a chronic liver.
I feed him biscuits to appease his ire;
He eats the gift but fain would bite the giver.
His eye is red with reminiscent fire,
His thoughts are by the great Zambesi River
Where hides the hippopotam, huge as sin,
And slinking leopards with the dappled skin.
No couches of the nymph and Bassarid,
Or thymy meadows such as Simois glasses,
Lured his exulting feet, my jocund kid,
But veldt and kloof and waving jungle grasses,
--
Where lurk the python with unwinking lid,
And the lean lion, growling, as he passes,
His futile wrath against the hoarse baboons
That drape the rocks in chattering platoons.
Free of the waste he snuffed the breeze at morn,
The fleet-foot peer of sassaby and kudu :
The hunting leopard feared his bristling horn,
The foul hyaena voted him a hoodoo;
Browsing on tender grass and camel-thorn
He roamed the plains, as all right-minded gnu do :
But now he eats the bun of discontent
That once was lord of half a continent.
And thou, my child, to whom harsh fate has dealt
A captive's birthright—thou wilt never scamper
With wingéd feet across the windy veldt,
Where are no crowds to stare nor bars to hamper;
Thou wilt not ring upon the rhino's pelt
In wanton sport. But there—why put a damper
On thy young spirits by recounting what
Africa is but Regent's Park is not.
It would but grieve thee, and, moreover, I
Note that thy young attention 's growing looser.
A piece of cake? O fiel my Thomas, fie!
The keeper said, “Please not to feed the gnu, Sir.”
And yet it seems a shame to pass thee by
Without some slight confectionery douceur :
So here's a bun; and let this thought obtrude:

A short while ago the following
advertisement appeared in the “Per-

“Artist (33), literary, travelled, mentally

Then he stepped outside and went

“A Verey brilliant one, Sir,” asserted

toil he scraped the last of the glaze

“is the sort that doesn't realise that

the Major, “he knows, poor devil!
I’m going to write to him and say,
“When I think of the incessant strain
of the trench warfare carried on with
inadequate support by you civilians of
military age against the repeated brutal
attacks of tribunals, I marvel at the

Second Lieutenant—a ticket-of-leave
man, as it were, without a ticket-of-

remnants of two companies with honour
but not with acknowledgment, poised
a fountain - pen, inquiring casually,
“What was it the C.O. said about the

he began to write), “a Brobdingmagian

At breakfast about a week later the
Colonel seemed to be enjoying his
immense pile of correspondence so
heartily that many of the Mess, com-
paratively letterless as they were,
directed glances of injured interest to-
wards him—of rather deeper interest
than was warranted by º discip-
line or civilian breeding (which are, of
course, the same virtue in different
forms).
Then, presently, as he put down one
letter and opened another, the Major
was seen to stiffen and the Junior Sub.
to wilt. The attention of the table
became as fixed and frigid as that of
the midnight sentry at a loophole. The
Colonel toyed happily with another
letter (while the Senior Captain made
a careful census of the grounds at the
bottom of his coffee-cup), took the
range of the manure-heap outside the
window from the angles of the table-
legs, rose, and departed with his cor-
respondence, summoning Williams to
follow him.
Outside the Weary One waited re-
spectfully for the Colonel to speak.
“So you saw through my camou-
flage?” said the latter thoughtfully.
“Yes, Sir.”
“How did you do it?”
“Well, Sir, to mention only the
internal evidence — an “Artist’” —
Williams waved his hand expressively
towards the manure-heap ; “thirty-
three'—one of the youngest C.O.'s in
the Army, I believe 2" He bowed
politely. -
“Ha!” said the Colonel.
“‘Literary'—I remember your stop-
ping Captain Jones's leave for a split
infinitive in a ration return. “Tra-
velled '—you have travelled in Turkey,
I think, Sir 2"
The Colonel, who had been blown
out of a trench at Krithia, nodded
shortly.
“Mentally isolated’—I'm afraid, Sir,
our Mess doesn't afford very much for
a mind like yours to bite on. I'm
afraid, too, that such correspondence
as—as mine, for instance—can hardly
be called either brilliant or interesting.”
“I don't know,” said the Colonel.
“That was a very good bit about the
destruction of Ypres. What was it?
—Ha, yes—A Drobdingnagian act—”
“—of brachycephalic brutality, Sir.
But that was not original.”
“If you can't be original your-
self,” said the Colonel kindly, “the next
best thing is to quote from those who
can.” -
“That's what I thought, Sir.”
“Ha! Well, of course the writers'
anonymity must be observed—that's a
point of honour. Still, I think, Wil-
liams—I have been asked to recom-
mend an intelligent officer for a staff
appointment—that if I were to name
you I should not go far wrong. And—

of the destruction of Ypres—”

A TROPICAL TRAGEDY.
ON the tesselated slopes
Of the Isle of Tapioca,
Where the azure antelopes
Haunt the valley of Avoca,
Dwelt the maid Opoponax,
Only child of Brex Koax,
Far renowned in Song and saga,
Ruler of ten million blacks,
Emperor of Larranaga.
She could play the loud jamboon
With a fervour corybantic;
She could hurl the macaroon
Far into the mid-Atlantic;
More self-helpful than a SMILES,
She could ride on crocodiles,
Catch the fleetest flying-fishes;
She could cook, like EUSTACE MILES,
Wondrous vegetarian dishes.
In the cool of eventide,
Gracefully festooned with myrtle,
In her sampan she would glide
Forth to spear the snapping turtle;
And her voice was blinding sweet,
Piercing as the parrakeet,
Fruity as old Manzanilla,
With a soupçon of the bleat
Of the African gorilla.
Bligible swains in shoals,
Victims to her fascination,
Toasted her in flowing bowls
Far beyond all computation;
There was valorous Hupu,
Xingalong and Timbalu,
And the peerless Popocotl,
Who had gained a triple blue
For his prowess with the bottle.
But Opoponax, whose mind
Soared above her native tutors,
Imperturbably declined
All these brave and dusky suitors.
Finally she hailed a tramp
And, contriving to decamp
To the shores of Patagonia,
Finding them too chill and damp,
Perished of acute pneumonia.
In an even darker doom
Tapioca's greatness ended,
For her father to the tomb
By swift leaps and bounds de-
scended;
Xingalong and Timbalu
Both were slaughtered by Hupu,
Who was slain by Popocotl,
Who himself soon after slew
With an empty whisky bottle.
Every tale, we often hear,
Ought to have a wholesome moral;
And this truth is just as clear
In the land of palm and coral;
For this tragedy in tones
Louder than a megaphone's
Warns us that two things are
risky,
If you dwell in torrid zones—
Change of climate, love of whisky.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. STEPHEN McKENNA, with the blushing honours of
Sonia still fresh upon him, has now turned his pen to a
tale of farcical adventure, the result being Ninety-Sia:
Hours' Leave (METHUEN), and I could find it in my heart
to regret it. Because, to speak frankly, the present volume
will do little to add to the reputation so deservedly won by
the other. It is a tangle of complications, which, since they
have nothing solid to rest upon, begin by baffling, and end
by boring, the reader who strives to keep pace with them.
A young officer, wishful to dine at a smart hotel and
having no appropriate clothes, is struck with the idea of
pretending to be a foreign royalty, and thus incapable of
sartorial indiscretion. And, as all sorts of assassins and
undesirable aliens happened to be waiting about to kill the
man whose style he borrowed, you can make a fair guess at
the subsequent action. There is much dialogue, most of it
sparkling, though even here I have to report criticism from
a young friend to whom I introduced the story. He said,
“People don't talk like that really.” Which happens to
be undeniably true. Thus, while giving Mr. McKENNA
credit for an active invention and some really witty turns
of phrase, I fear I must repeat my warning that as a
farceur he is below his best form.
The cleverlady who elects to call herself “RICHARD DEHAN”
has already secured a deserved reputation as a writer of
short stories. Her new book, Under the Hermes (HEINE-
MANN), gives us a further selection of tales of various lengths,
from one that is not quite a novel to others that are as
brief as ten pages. The themes and settings are equally
varied; but all—or almost all—show the writer at her best
in the vigorous, swift and exciting development of some
dramatic situation. The exception, I may say at once, is
the title-tale, to my mind a stilted and—in a double sense
—obviously “studio piece,” quite unworthy of its position
at the opening of so attractive a volume, where indeed it
might easily discourage a questing reader. “Mr. DEHAN"
is far more fairly represented by such brilliant little minia-
tures of historical romance as (to select three at random)
“A Speaking Likeness,” “A Game of Faro” and “The
Wengeance of the Cherry Stone"—slight sketches ranging
from France of the Revolution to mediaeval Bologna, but
each most effective in its vivid colouring and well-handled
climax. Since one of these has lingered for many years in
my recollection from some else-forgotten magazine, I suspect
that most of the tales in the volume may be making a
second appearance. If so, it is in every way deserved.
Trench Pictures from France (MELRose) is by the late
Major WILLIAM REDMoND, M.P., and The Ways of War
|...} is by the late Professor T. M. KETTLE, M.P.
Both these books are memorials raised to their authors by
the pious zeal of relations and friends who thought it shame
that so much nobility of purpose and generous ardour
should go unrecorded in a tribute more permanent than
the fleeting memories of contemporary survivors. Both
WILLIE REDMond and ToM KETTLE were Irishmen and
members of the Nationalist Party and were to that extent
foes of the British Government; yet, when they were

compelled to look the Prussian menace in the face, neither
the older man nor the younger hesitated for a moment.
Each, though there were many reasons that might have
pleaded against such a course, “joined up" in an Irish
regiment, each in due time went to France and each made
the supreme sacrifice, falling with his face to the foe.
Neither doubted for a moment that he was serving the
cause of Ireland in fighting against Prussianism and all
that it implies. Their enthusiastic approval of the justice
of our cause should be to us a great assurance. I knew
them both and can say with the most complete sincerity
that I never knew two men better loved by all who had to
do with them or more worthy of this universal affection.
It is in every way right that they should be com-
memorated for future generations. WILLIE REDMOND's
book consists of a series of sketches of the War contributed
by him to The Daily Chronicle. They are written with
great charm and, even in the gloomiest surroundings, reflect
the sunny nature of the man. There is a most appre-
ciative biographical memoir by E. M. SMITH-DAMPIER, and
in an appendix will be found the memorable and splendid
speech delivered by WILLIE REDMoND in the House of
Commons on March 7th - -
of this year-—a true
salutation in view of
death. KETTLE's book
is in the main a reprint
of articles that reveal a
brilliant and versatile
mind. Mrs. KETTLE
contributes a very in-
thetic account of her
gallant husband's life.
It would have been

cannot be too thankful that this novel is laid in a period
before the Germans became an uncivilised nation. Olive,
the heroine, a delightful girl, is the supposititious child of
Sir James Wenborough, whose wife, in his absence and
without his knowledge, secured her as a substitute for
their own child, who died at its birth. The secret is
disclosed by an unscrupulous minx, who uses the know-
ledge she has obtained to push her way into the Wenborough
household. Men are not Madame ALBANESI's strongest
points, but in Roderick Guye and Michael Wenborough we
have well-contrasted characters, and the worst that can be
said of them is that they belong to rather stock types.
Altogether a book which many people will describe as
“perfectly sweet;” but, because of its sympathetic qualities
and sound workmanship, it deserves a more distinctive label.
When the lean brown hero with the hawk lip extends an
arm of steel from the six-cylinder Rolls-Royce in which he
is lounging and snatches the beautiful mannequin from

commoner type in all ages than the obvious records show.
The author handles with real subtlety the phases of Arthur's
marriage with a woman much older than himself, a marriage
in which the hunger of the woman for love was a greater
factor than the not deeply stirred passion of the man. Then,
with the appearance of the destined mate, beauty and youth
and desire carry the day against duty, but neither callously
The insight and sympathy displayed in the
analysis of motive are remarkable. The author has a real
gift for portraiture. In particular he touches in his minor
folk with extraordinarily deft defining lines. Perhaps in
general there is a little hesitancy in craftsmanship, a slight
quavering between the fashionable modern realism and an
older romanticism. But the seriousness of his artistic
intention, the solidity of his work (which is by no means
to say stodginess, quite the contrary) will commend
Mr. AUMONIER to all who care to listen to people who have
the one thing necessary, something to say; and the other
thing desirable, a pleasant way of saying it.

heroine comes to she is º called Lady Alice in an

[“Stedfastness and righteousness are the qualities which the
German people value in the highest degree, and which have brought
it a good and honourable reputation in the whole world. When we
make experiments in lies and deception, intrigue and low cunning,
we suffer hopeless and brutal failure. Our lies are coarse and im-
probable, our ambiguity is pitiful simplicity. The history of the
War proves this by a hundred examples. When our enemies poured
all these things upon us like a hailstorm, and we convinced ourselves
of the effectiveness of such tactics, we tried to imitate them. But
these tactics will not fit the German. We are rough but moral, we
are credulous but honest.”—Herr DERNIURG, in “Deutsche Politik."]
IN Eden bowers, so fair to see, -
There dwelt, when sin was yet to be,
A guileless Serpent up a tree,
- Sniffing the virgin breezes;
Till Eve (the huzzy!), one fine day,
With evil purpose came his way,
And led that simple worm astray
By low and wicked wheezes.
A Wolf there was, quite sweet and good,
Till in his path Red Riding-Hood -
Went camouflaging through the wood–
A brazen little terror;
Large teeth she had and bulgy eyes
And told the most amazing lies,
And taught him, in a flowery guise,
The downward route to error.
Of Fritz's nature, fresh as morn,
Pure as a babe that's just been born,
Clean as a poodle lately-shorn,
These are symbolic samples;
The Wolf unversed in specious vice,
The Serpent with a taste as nice
As anything in Paradise—
Debauched by bad examples.
England seduced us. 'Neath her spell,
Mistress of lies, we fell and fell
Into the poisoned sink, or well,
Of faked and fabulous rumour;
And there, as we were bound to do,
We failed, because we loved the True,
And loathed the False as alien to
Our artless German humour.
I speak as one who ought to know ;
Myself I tried a trick or so
In U.S.A. and had to go,
Looking absurdly silly;
And now against us, big with fate,
That Hemisphere has thrown its weight,
Both North and South (though up to date
We haven't heard from Chili).
Laughter we've earned—a noble shame !
Built to achieve a higher aim,
We honest Huns can't play the game
Of shifty propaganders;
Henceforth we'd better all get back
On to the straight and righteous track
And help our HINDENBURG to hack
(If not too late) through Flanders.

THE CARP AT MIRAMEL.
[In the following article all actual names, personal, geographical
and regimental, have been duly camouflaged.]
THE carp that live in the moat of the Château de Miramel
(in the zone of the armies in France) are of an age and
ugliness incredible and of a superlative cynicism. One of
them—local tradition pointed to a one-eyed old reprobate
with a yellow face—is the richer these hundred years past
by an English peeress's diamond ring. . -
From the bottom of the moat one world-war is like
another, and none of them very different from peace. . It
is but a row of grinning red healthy faces over the coping
and a shower of bread and biscuit. - -
When the nightmare of BonAPARTE was ended in the
Autumn of 1815, the 22nd K.R. Lancers, commanded by
an English peer, billeted themselves in and around the
Château de Miramel. The English peer, finding time hang
heavy on his hands, or my lady's letters proving insistent,
sent for her to come out to him at Miramel. You could
do that sort of homely thing in 1815. . - - * ,
So my lady comes to Miramel, and the very first day, as she
leans out of window in the round tower, mishandles her
diamond ring (gift of my lord) and drops it into the moat.
Her host, the good Comte de Miramel, dredged and drained,
but no trace of the diamond ring was ever found. But old
Cyclops, the carp, grinned horribly. . ~ :
In due course my lord and lady went home to the Isle of
Fogs, and thence they sent their portraits to their host as
a souvenir of their stay. Here indeed the portraits still
hang, very graceful in the style of the period. And to the
appreciative visitor Madame de Miramel (of to-day) shows
a missive of thanks, written in indifferent bad French, in
which my lady refers sorrowfully to “ma bague diamantée.”
x: × × ::: ::: :: :::
Once again the 22nd K.R. Lancers are billeted in
Miramel. The other day I noticed on a worn stone pillar
at the great door the following half-obliterated words:—
“ED. WYNN, pikeman of the dashing 22nd King's Ryol ridgemet
of lanciers. Sept. 1815 ";
and freshly scratched above the inscription:—
“Better at piking than at speling.
22" K.R. Lancers. JAs. BARNET. Sept. 1917.”
The old carp seems to be right, and one war is very like
another. There is no radical change in the orthography
of the 22nd King's Royal Lancers, and some-one else's wall
is still the medium for self-expression. -
Old Cyclops must be throwing his mind back a hundred
years or so. There is a rain of bread and biscuits into the
moat and a ring of red grinning faces above the coping.
Yesterday I threw a disused safety-razor blade over the old
scoundrel's nose. And “Bless my soul!” he said, as he
lazily bolted it, “there hasn't been such a year for minnows
since 1815.”
But Armageddon 1917 holds surprises even for those
who live at the bottom of a moat. For very early this
morning a bauble fell into the moat that Cyclops himself
couldn't digest. The old cynic was found floating, scarred
belly upwards, on the surface of the water.
The mess-waiter took charge of the post-mortem. Like
the Duke of Plaza Toro, he “likes an interment” and rarely
misses a last rite. A keen fisherman, he had little difficulty
in extracting an exhibit for the Court's inspection, which
he unhesitatingly pronounced to be a diamond ring in an
advanced state of decomposition.
The mess-cook, on the other hand, identified the relic as
the stopping, recently mislaid, from one of his back teeth.
In any case there seems little room for doubt that a
Hun airman has avenged the long-dead lady.

Listen.
Years ago, when the well-known War
was young, a great man sat in his
sanctum exercising his grey matter.
He said to himself, “There is a war
on. Men, amounting to several, will
be prised loose from comfortable sur-
roundings and condemned to get on
with it for the term of their unnatural
lives. They will be shelled, gassed,
mined and bombed, smothered in mud,
worked to the bone, bored stiff and
scared silly. Fatigues will be unend-
ing, rations short, rum diluted, reliefs
late and leave nil. Their girls will for-
sake them for diamond-studded muni-
tioneers. Their wives will write saying,
‘Little Jimmie has the mumps; and
what about the rent? You aren't spend-
ing all of five bob a week on yourself,
are you?' This is but a tithe (or else
a tittle) of the things that will occur
to them, and their sunny natures will
sour and sicken if something isn't done
about it.”
The great man sat up all night chew-
ing penholders and pondering on the
problem. The BIG IDEA came with the
end of the eighth penholder.
He sprang to his feet, fires of inspira-
tion flashing from his eyes, and boomed,
“Let there be Funny Cuts"—then
went to bed. Next morning he created
“I.” (which stands for Intelligence),
carefully selected his Staff, arrayed
them in tabs of appropriate hue, and
told them to go the limit. And they
have been going it faithfully ever since.
What the Marines are to the Senior
Service, “I.” is to us. Should a Sub-
altern come in with the yarn that the
spook of HINDENBURG accosted him at
Bloody Corner and offered him a cigar,
or a balloon cherub buttonhole you
with the story of a Bosch tank fitted
with rubber tyres, C-springs and hot
and cold water, that he has seen climb-
ing trees behind St. Quentin, we retort,
“Oh, go and tell it to ‘I,’” and then sit
back and see what the inspired official
organ of the green tabs will make of it.
A hint is as good as a wink to them,
a nudge ample. Under the genius of
these imaginative artists the most
trivial incident burgeons forth into a
LE QUEUx spell-binder, and the whole
British Army, mustering about its
Sergeant-Majors, gets selected cameos
read to it every morning at roll-call,
laughs brokenly into the jaws of dawn
and continues chuckling to itself all
day. Now you know.
Our Adjutant had a telephone call
not long ago. “Army speaking,” said a
voice. “Will you send somebody over
to Rataplan and see if there is a Town
Major there?”
The Adjutant said he would, and a
N.C.O. was despatched forthwith. He re.
turned later, reporting no symptoms of
one, so the Adjutant rang up Exchange
and asked to be hooked on to Army
Headquarters. “Which branch 2" Ex-
change inquired. “Why, really I don't
know—forgot to ask,” the Adjutant
confessed. “I’ll have a try at “A.’”
“Hello,” said “A.” “There is no
Town Major at Rataplan,” said the
Adjutant. “You astound me, Fair
Unknown,” said “A.”; “but what about
it, anyway?” The Adjutant apologised
and asked Exchange for “Q.” depart-
ment. “Hello,” said “Q.” “There is
no Town Major at Rataplan,” said the
Adjutant. “Sorry, old thing, whoever
you are,” said “Q.,” “but we don't
stock 'em. Rations, iron; perspirators,
box; oil, whale, delivered with prompti-
tude and civility, but Not Town Majors
—sorry.” The Adjutant sighed and
consulted with Exchange as to who
possibly could have rung him up.
Exchange couldn't guess unless it
was “I.”—no harm in trying, anyhow.
“Hello!” said “I.” “There is no
Town Major at Rataplan,” the Adjutant
droned somewhat wearily. “Wha-tl”
“I.” exclaimed, suddenly interested.

SECOND CHILDHooD.
IMUST make a confession to some-
one. I have wasted raw material which
is a substitute for something else indis-
pensable for defeating the Hun, and
probably traitor is the right name for
me. Let me explain. ..
Somewhere in Nutshire there is a
place called Cotterham. It is one of
those little villages which somehow
nobody expects to meet nowadays out-
side the pages of a KATE GREENAway
painting book. There is the village
green, with its pond and geese and
absurdly pretty cottages with gardens
full of red bergamot and lads'-love, and
a little school where the children are
still taught to curtsey and pull their
forelocks when the Squire goes by.
And beyond the Green, at the end of
Plough Lane and after you have crossed
Leg-o'-Mutton Common, you come to
Down Wood, and if you don't meet
Little Red Riding-Hood on the way or
come on Snow White and her seven
dwarfs, that is only because you must
have taken the wrong turning after you
came through the kissing-gate at the
bottom of Lovers' Lane. I am a native
of Cotterham, and in my more reflective
moments I wonder why such an idyllic
place should have produced anything
so unromantic as myself, His Majesty's
Deputy Assistant Acting Inspector for
All Sorts of Unexpected Explosives.
|Cotterham still has a large place in my
affections, and it gave me a consider-
able shock the other day to get a letter
"|from the Squire, who is an Óld friend,
asking me down for a week-end, and
|adding, “You can do a little profes-
|sional job for me too.
|be interested to see what splendid work
You really will
is being done here in your line of fire.
The output is some of the best in the
* | district. But there has been trouble
lately and the leaders of the two biggest
shifts were found to have appropriated
a 'substantial part of the output to
their own uses. I shall rely on you
to straighten things out and suggest
the right penalties.” -
So they were even making munitions
in Cotterham. I conjured up visions
of interminable rows of huts, of thou-
sands of overalled workers swamping
Plough Lane, trampling the Green
brown, scaring the geese, obliterating
the immemorial shape of Leg-o'-Mutton
Common by a mushroom township,
laying Down Wood low, and coming
to me with some miserable tale of
petty pilfering for my adjustment. I
must own I got out of the train at
Muddlehampstead and into the station
fly feeling distinctly low-spirited. It
was some consolation to find that the
railway still stopped seven miles short
of my village, though Ireflected gloomily
that the place itself was doubtless a
network of light railways by this time.
We bowled along in stately fashion up
Plough Lane and past Halfpenny Cross
to the Manor House with its thatched
roof and Virginia-creeper all over the
porch. The Squire carried me off at
once for the professional part of my
visit, but we fell to talking of fishing,
which had been good, and cubbing,
which had been bad, and were on to
Leg-o'-Mutton Common before I re-
membered to speak of munitions.
“Not much sign of war, here,” I
said with a relieved sigh. “I was
afraid they'd have spoilt the dear old
heath for a certainty. Only don't say
it's Down Wood they've gone to, for
that'd be more than Y. stand. I
thought there were fairies there long
after I ought to have been a hard-
headed young man of six, and if they've
gone and desecrated that wood with
factories * -
The Squire smiled.
“I don't think I should worry.
Amongst all your Unexpected Explo-
sives do you happen to condescend to
have heard of the gentle horse-chestnut
and the school-children that collect
them? Here are the two delinquents
I wrote to you about, and we've
caught them in the act. Just look at
them wasting the precious things.”
Two small boys were playing at
conkers, two small boys with ve
earnest faces and grubby clothes which
never figured in KATE GREENAway's
pictures, wasting precious material
which five-and-thirty other scholars
were diligently collecting and stuffing
into sacks. I ought to have given
them a lecture on patriotism—the army
behind the Army. But we each of us
keep one childish passion untamed,
even if we are unromantic old bachelors,
and I, His Majesty's Deputy Assistant ||
Acting Inspector for All Sorts of Unex-
pected Explosives and his very loyal
subject, who have lived for nearly
half-a-century of Octobers in London
town—I borrowed the bigger conker
and systematically and in deadly
earnest I fought and defeated the other
small boy.
They say that treason never suc-
ceeds; so perhaps I can't be a traitor
after all.
THE UNDISMAYED.
IN a world of insecurity and change
it is good to have one bedrock certainty
upon which the mind can rest. Thrones
totter and fall; Commanders-in-chief
are superseded; Admirals of the High
Fleet are displaced; in politics leaders
come and go and reputations pass; in
ordinary life a thousand mutations are
visible. But amid all this flux there
remains mercifully one resolute piece
of routine that nothing can alter.
Whatever may be happening elsewhere
in the world—mutinies in the German
Navy, revolutions in Russia, advances
in France, advances in Flanders—
Leicester Square keeps its head. Arma-
geddon may be turning the world upside
down, but it cannot cause those old
antagonists, STEvPNsoN and REECE, to
cease their perpetual contest; and if
the War lasts another ten years you
will read in The Times of October 17th,
1927, a paragraph to the effect that
“at the close of play yesterday in the
billiard match of 16,000 points up be-
tween Stevenson and Reece, at the
Grand Hall, Leicester Square, the
scores were: Reece (in play), 4,676;
Stevenson, 2,837.”
Not Cannibals after all.
“The first contingent of the American troops
brought food for six months, and hence the
fears of the peasants in France lest they
should be eaten up are groundless.”
Adelaide Advertiser.
“If the public continue to spend the same
sum of money on bread at 9d. as they did
when it was 1s., it is easy to see that the con-
sumption will rise by a quarter or 25 per
cent.”—Glasgow Evening News.
We are always timid about questioning
a Scotsman's arithmetic, but we make
the increase a third, or 33% per cent.

GROSS-TALK WITH PETHERTON.
Petherton and I have just emerged
from another bombardment. Certain
correspondence in The Surbury Gazette
and North Herts Courier gave me a
welcome excuse for firing what I may
term a sighting shot... I wrote to my
genial neighbour as follows:–
DEAR MR. PETHERTON,+No doubt
you have seen the recent letters in the
local paper anent the remains of the old
Cross, which are at once an ornament
to Castle Street, Surbury, and a stand-
ing menace to the peace of mind of the
local antiquarians.
I am exceedingly interested in the
matter myself and feel that the views
of one who, I am sure, adds a wide
knowledge of archaeology to the long
list of his accomplishments, would be
both interesting and instructive to my-
self and (if you would allow your views
to be published) to our little com-
munity in general.
If therefore you will write and let
me know your opinion on the matter I
shall take it as a friendly and cousinly
(vide certain eighteenth-century docu-
ments in the Record Office) act.
Yours sincerely,
HENRY J. FordyCE.
Petherton replied with a whizz-bang
as thus:—
SIR,--I have read the idiotic corre-
spondence to which you refer, and am
| informed that you are the author of
the screed which appeared in last
Saturday's issue of the paper. If my
informant is correct as to the author-
ship of the letter I can only say it is a
pity that, with apparently no know-
ledge of the subject, you should venture
into print. Anyone enjoying the least
acquaintance with the rudiments of
English history would be perfectly
aware that the remains have no con-
nection with QUEEN ELEANor what-
ever. The whereabouts of all the
crosses put up to her memory are
quite well known to archaeologists.
Yours faithfully,
FREDERick PETHERTON.
I replied with light artillery:—
DEAR PETHERTON,+Yours re the late
Mrs. Edward PLANTAGENET to hand.
Though not a professed archaeologist
I do know something of the ruin in
question, having several times examined
it and having heard, perhaps, most, if
not all, the various theories concerning
it. I have been here a good deal
longer than you have, I believe, and
cannot think that you know more of
the subject than I.
Have you read Wycherley's treatise
on the Eleanor Crosses? [I invented
He (connoisseur of wines). “WE STAYED SEVERAL DAYS AT AN INN 1N A 1.1TTLE
GLOUCESTERSHIRE VILLAGE, AS WE FOUND THEY HAD SUCH AN EXCELLENT CELLAR.”
She. “REALLY! I HAD No IDEA THE RAIDERs IIAD GOT so FAR west. As THAT."
this monograph for the purpose of in-
ducing Petherton to reload.] If not,
why not? Perhaps you would like to
dispute the existence of a castle on the
site where the Castle Farm now stands,
and where such shameless profiteering
is carried on in eggs and butter?
By the way, how is your poultry? I
notice that your seizième siècle rooster
wants his tail remodelling. Perhaps
you are not worrying about new plum-
age for him till after the War, though
it seems like carrying patriotism to
absurd lengths.
Yours sincerely,
HENRY J. Fordyce.
I hope you will allow your letter to
be published in The Gazette.
In reply to this Petherton discharged.
with :—
SIR,--I am not concerned with the
castle, which may or may not have
existed in Surbury, nor am I interested
in your friend's monograph on Eleanor
Crosses. Other people besides your-
self have the impudence to rush into
print on matters of which they are
sublimely ignorant.
Perhaps I had better inform you that
Edward I. reigned at the end of the
thirteenth and the beginning of the four-
teenth centuries (1272-1307), not in the
fifteenth, and a very slight knowledge of
architecture would convince you that
the Surbury relics are not earlier than
the fifteenth century.
Trusting you will not commit any
further absurdities, though I am not too
sanguine,
I am, Yours faithfully,
FREDERIck PETHERTON.
My views are not for publication. I

It was evident that my neighbour's

artillery to draw him on, and loosed
off with :— -

In fact there seems to be no subject on
which you cannot write informatively,
which makes me sorry that you will
not join in the literary fray in the
local paper, as it deprives the native
of a great treat. -
But—there is a but, my dear Fred—
I cannot admit your claim to superior
knowledge of the Surbury relics. Re-
member, I have grown up with them
as it were. Yours ever,
HARRY FordyCE.
SIR (exploded Petherton), — What
senseless drivel you write on the least
provocation Whether you grew up
with the Surbury relics or not, you
have certainly decayed with them.
Every stone that's left of that con-
founded ruin (probably only a simple
market-cross) proclaims the date of its
birth. Even the broken finial and the
two crockets lying on the ground ex-
pose your ignorance. Eleanor Cross,
bah ! -
Yours flly., F. PETHERTON.
I thought it was time to emerge from
my literary camouflage and let off, a
heavy howitzer; which I did, with the
following:— -
DEAR FREDDY,+I am afraid you have
got hold of the wrong end of the stick
and laid an egg in a mare's nest. [These
mixed metaphors were designed to
tease him into a further barrage.] I
did not write, and I do not remember
saying that I had written, the letter to
the paper which seems to have given
you as much pleasure as it has given
me. I had no hand in the symposium,
but the way you have brought your
CHESTERFIELD battery into action has
been so masterly that I, for one, can
never regret that you were misinformed.
I believe the particular letter to The
Gazette was written by one of the staff,
a native of the place, who probably
carved his name on the base in his
youth, and has felt a personal interest
in the Cross ever since. I hope with
this new light on the affair you will
favour me with your further views on
history and archaeology. -

CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER LX.
Mary. I wish, Mamma, that there
were not so many shocking stories-in
history.
Mrs. M. History is, indeed, a sad
catalogue of human miseries, and one
is glad to turn aside from the horrors
of war to the amenities of private life.
Shall I tell you something of the do-
mestic habits of the English in the
early twentieth century?
Mary. Oh do, Mamma; I shall like
that very much.
Mrs. M. The nobility and the well-
to-do classes no longer lived shut up
in gloomy castles, but made a point of
spending most of their time in public.
They never took their meals at home,
but habitually frequented large build-
ings called restaurants, fitted up with
sumptuous and semi-Sultanic splen-
dour. In these halls, while the guests
sat at a number of tables, they were
entertained by minstrels and singers.
It was even said that they acquired
the habit of eating and drinking in
time to the music. They were waited
upon for the most part by foreigners,
who spoke broken English, and what
with the babel of tongues, the din of
the music and the constant popping of
corks, for alcohol had not yet been
prohibited, the scene beggared de-
scription.
Richard. Well, I am sure I would
rather dine in our meat little dining-
room, with our silent wireless waiter,
than partake of the most extravagant
repasts in those sumptuous halls.
George. I must just ask you, Mamma,
about one thing that has all along
puzzled me very much. What was the
House of Lords about all this time
that they let the House of Commons
govern the country and have their own
way in everything?
Mrs. M. I am afraid, my dear George,
that you are animated by a somewhat
reactionary bias in favour of feudalism,
which in your own best interests you
would do well to curb. It is enough
to say that some of the peers supported
the House of Commons, and the ma-
jority were too timid to make any
stand against the numbers and violence
of the other House. Nowadays, thanks
to the wide diffusion of peerages and
the fact that they are conferred far
more freely on persons of advanced
political views, this lack of independ-
ence has largely been eliminated.
Jºichard. I am sure we must all
thank you for the trouble you took to
explain about Free Trade and Protec-
tion; but if you are not too tired will
you kindly tell us something about the
learned and clever men who lived at
this time?
Mrs. M. You know, my dear boy,
that I am always happy to impart
information, and am pleased to have
such attentive listeners. The authoress
of your favourite poems, Mary, lived in
this reign. I mean Mrs. ELLA WHEELER
WILCox. The Rev. H. G. WELLs, the
famous theologian who abolished the
Latin and Greek grammars; the Bar-
oness Corkscrew—to call her by the
name under which she was ultimately
elevated to the peerage—who wrote so
many beautiful historical romances that
she quite superseded Sir WALTER Scott;
Sir John OxENHAM, one of England's
greatest poets; and Lord HALL-CAINE,
author of Isle of Man Power, were
commanding figures in this period.
Richard. Oh, Mamma, did not Lord
HALL-CAINE discover the North Pole?
Mrs. M. Not that I am aware of my
dear boy, though it is quite possible.
But you are probably confusing him
with the Arctic explorer, Dr. KANE.

more of this great Persian ruler, but ||
history being reticent our chance has
gone, unless it should be the good
fortune of some member of Sir STANLEY
MAUDE's expedition, rummaging in the

new facts. Meanwhile I offer the
name as a terse and snappy one for
a Persian kitten, such as I saw the
other day convert several shillings'-
worth of my aunt's Berlin wool (as it
is still, I believe, called, in spite of
The Daily Mail) into sheer scrap.
Knitting however is not what it was
in the early days of the War and the
tragedy led to no bloodshed, my aunt,
who has evidently an emulative ad-
miration for Sir Isaac NEwton, merely
shaking her finger. But self-control
among women must be on the increase,
for in a hotel the other day I overheard
a coffee-room conversation in which
two cases were instanced of supreme
heroism under agonising conditions—
one being when a butler (an old and
honoured butler too, who had never
misconducted himself before) fainted
while carrying round the after-dinner
coffee and poured most of it over the
ample shoulders of a dowager. This
lady not only disregarded the pain and
the damp, but assisted in bringing the
butler to. The Distinguished Service
Order has been given for less than that.
It was either in this hotel or another
that I met the Naval officer among
whose duties is the granting or re-
fusing of permits to amateur photo-
graphers in districts where “Dora.” does

the time-honoured procedure of Robin
HooD and his Greenwood Company,
robbing Dives on system to pay Laz-
arus. Their economics are sounder than
their sociology, which is of the crudest.
They specialize in jewellery—useless,
barbaric and generally vulgar survivals
—which they extract from shop and safe,
and sell in Amsterdam, distributing the
proceeds to various deserving charitable
agencies. In this particular crowded
hour of life the leader of the group, a
fanatical prig with hypnotic eyes, ab-
ducts the beautiful Lady Fenton, with
ten thousand pounds' worth of stuff
upon her, from one of the least am-
bitious of Soho restaurants.
How came she there, thus bedizened?
Well, her husband, eccentric peer with
a priceless collection of snuffboxes and
a chronic deficiency of humour, had
arranged the little dinner to effect a re-
conciliation, away from the prying eyes
of their set. It was not a success. She
felt that she sparkled too much, was
piqued, and dismissed her lord. Enter
the hypnotic prig, who adroitly conveys
her to his headquarters, preaches to
her and converts her to the point of
surrendering her jewels without a pang,
and offering to assist in the lifting of
the snuffboxes. I can't say more with-
out endangering the effect of Captain
CoRE's ingenious shifts and spoofs.
The author seemed to me to tempt
Providence by placing his perfervid
philanthropist and his serious doctrines
against a background of burlesque.
But he succeeded in entertaining his
audience. Miss LILLAH McCARTHY,
looking her very best as Lady Fenton,
and Mr. CowLEY WRIGHT, looking quite
plausible as the irresistible chief of the
General Charities Distribution Bureau,
shared the chief honours of the evening.

When the kind earth gave you a resting place,
And comforting night gathered you in her arms,
With light dew falling on your upturned face 2

Did you still hear around you, as you lay,

The thunder of the guns at close of day ?

“Francesca,” I said, “you must be very deeply occupied;
for ten minutes I have not heard your silvery voice.”
“I am attempting,” she said, “to fill up our sugar form.”
“Is it a tremendous struggle?” -
“Yes,” she said, “it is a regular brain-smasher.”
“Give me the paper, and let me have a go at it.”
With a haggard face, but without a word, she handed
me the buff form, and sat silently while I read the various
explanations and directions.
“Francesca,” I said, “you are doing wrong. It says
that the form must be filled up and signed by a responsible
member of the household. Now you can say that you're
brilliant or amiable or handsome or powerful or domineer-
ing, but can you honestly say you're responsible? No, you
can't. So I shall keep this form and fill it up myself in
due time, and leave you to look after the hens or talk to
the gardener.” - -
“Anybody,” she said, “who can wring a smile from
a gardener, as I have this morning, is entitled to be con-
sidered responsible. Infirm of purpose! hand me the paper.”
“Very well,” I said, “you can have the paper; only
remember that, if we get fined a thousand pounds for trans-
gressing the Defence of the Realm Act, you mustn't ask
me for the money. You must pay it yourself.”
“I’ll chance that,” she said, as I handed back the paper.
“Now then, we shan't be long. Which of these two
addresses shall we have 2"
“How do you mean?”
“Why, they tell you to fill in the address in capital
letters, and then they give you two to pick from. One is
1000, Upper Grosvenor Street, W. 1 x -
“It is a longer street than I had supposed.”
“And the other,” she continued, “is 17, Church Lane,
Middlewich, Cheshire.”
“Let it be Middlewich,” I said. “Since boyhood's hour
I have dreamt of living in Middlewich. As for the other,
I simply couldn't live in a street of a thousand houses.
Could you?”
“No,” she said, “I couldn't. We'll be Middlewichians.
. . . There, it's done. Capital letters and all.”
“Don’t slack off,” I said. “Fill it all up now that
you've got started.”
“I suppose I'd better begin with myself.”
“Yes,” I said, “you may have that privilege. Put it
down quick: Carlyon, Francesca; age blank, because they
don't want ages over eighteen; F for female, and Married
Woman for occupation. Then treat me in the same way,
putting M for F, and 2nd Lieutenant of Volunteers instead
of Married Woman.”
“Why shouldn't I put Married Man as your occupation ?”
“Simply because it isn't done. It's a splendid occupation,
but it isn't recognised as such in formal documents.”
“Another injustice to women. I shall enter you as
Married Man.”
“Enter Ae as anything you like,” I said, “only let's
get on with the job.”
“Very well; you're down as Married Man.”
“Now get on with the children. Muriel first.
about her ?”
“But she's away having her education finished.”
“Yes,” I said, “but she'll be back for the holidays, and
she'll want her sugar then, like the rest of us. And
Frederick is away at his school, probably getting much
better sugar than we are. He'll be wanting his ration in
the holidays. You'd better put a note about that.”
“A note 2 " she said. “There's no room for notes on
this form. All they want is a bald statement. And that's .
just what they can't get. They'll have to take it with the
hair on. I'm cramming in about the holidays, and I hope
Lord RHONDDA will be pleased with all the information he's
getting about our family.” *
“Keep going,” I said; “you've still got the servants to
do.” -
“Yes, but the kitchenmaid's gone, and I haven't engaged
another one yet.”
“Don’t let that worry you,” I said. “Write down—
‘Kitchenmaid about to be engaged. Name will be supplied
later.’” -
“You’re quite brilliant to-day. There, that's finished,
thank Heaven.”’’ -
- “Not yet. You've got to address it to the Local Food
Office.” -
“But I haven't the remotest where the Local Food
Office is. It can't have been there more than a short time,
anyhow.” - -
“Hurrah!” I said, looking over her shoulder at the
document. “It says if you are in doubt as to the name of
the district of your Local Food Office you are to inquire
of any policeman or special constable.”
“That's all very well,” she said, “but how are we to
find a policeman in this remote and peaceful place? I've
never seen one. Have you?” - -
“Yes,” I said, “I think I saw one last year on a bicycle.”
“Well, he's probably arrived somewhere else by this
time. He's no good to us.” -
“No, but we might find a special constable.”
“I’ll tell you what,” she said, “old Glumgold is a special
constable. I heard him complaining bitterly of having
been hauled out of bed during the last air-raid on London.
“No nigher to we nor forty mile,' he said it was. He's sure
to be among the cabbages. Be a dear and dash out and
ask him.”
So I found Glumgold in among the cabbages and asked
him where the Local Food Office was, and he said he'd be
gingered if he knew, he or his old woman either; and that
was the question they was a-going to arst of us, because
to-day was the last day for sending in. So I advised him
to chance it with Nebsbury, which happens to be eight
miles off and possesses a High Street; and then I went
back to Francesca and told her that Glumgold advised
Nebsbury—which was cowardly, but one can't spend a life-
time over a fiddle-headed document like that. Anyhow,
we folded it up and posted it, and we've heard nothing
since. - - R. C. L.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
NoT for a great while have I met a story at once so mov.
ing and so simply made as Summer (MACMILLAN). Of
course at this time the art of EDITH WHARTON is no new
discovery; but to my thinking she has never done better
work than this tale of a New England village, and the
wakening to love of the girl who was drowsing away her
youth there. It is all, as I say, so simple, and written with
such apparent economy of effort, that only afterwards does
the amazing cleverness of Mrs. WHARTON's method impress
itself upon the reader. Charity Royall was a waif, of worse
than ambiguous parentage, brought up in a community
where her passionate and violently sensitive nature was
stifled. Two men loved her—dour middle-aged Lawyer
Royall, whose house she kept, and Lucius Harney, the
young visitor from the city, the fairy-prince of poor Charity's
one great romance, through whom came tragedy. You see
already the whole stark simplicity of the theme. What I
cannot convey to you is that secret of Mrs. WHARTON's that
enables her by some exquisitely right word or phrase so to
illuminate a scene that you see it as though by an inspira-
tion of your own, and feel that thus and thus did the thing
in fact happen. There are episodes in Summer—for ex-
ample the Fourth of July firework evening, or the wildly
macabre scene of the night funeral on the mountain—that
seem to me to come as near perfection in their telling as
anything I am ever likely to read, and when you have en-
joyed them for yourself I fancy you will be inclined to join
me in very sincere gratitude for work of such rare quality.
Those who admired (which is the same as saying those
who read) that excellent book, The Retreat from Mons, will
be glad to hear that its author, Major A. CoRBETT-SMITH,
has now continued his record in a further volume, called
The Marne and After (CASSELL). In it you will find all
those qualities, a sane and soldier-like common-sense, an
entire absence of gush, and a saving humour in the midst
of horrors, which made the éarlier instalment memorable.
Above all else I have been impressed by the first of these
characteristics. Major CoRBETT-SMITH writes from the view-
point of one to whom even this ghastliest of wars is part of
the day's work. That he sees its human and hideous sides
by no means impairs this quiet professional outlook. I
recall one phrase in his chapter on the secret agents of the
enemy: “At the Aisne German spies were a regular
plague"—just as one might speak of wasps or weather—
which somehow conveyed to me very vividly the secret of
our original little army's disproportionate influence in the
early weeks of the War. The operations which we call the
actual Battle of the Marne (surely fated to be the most
fought-again engagement in history) are here very clearly
described, with illustrative plans; while one other chapter,
called suggestively “Kultur,” may be commended to those
super-philosophers amongst us who are already beginning
an attempt to belittle the foul record of calculated crime that
must for at least a generation place Germany outside the
pale of civilization. For this grim chapter alone I should
like to see Major CoRBETT-SMITH's otherwise cheery volume
scattered broadcast over the country.
June (METHUEN) is saturated with the simple sentiment-
ality in which American authors excel. I do not know
whether British novelists could write this sort of book
successfully if they would, but I do know that they don't.
Miss EDITH BARNARD DELANo, however, succeeds in getting
considerable charm into her story, and if it leaves rather a
sweeter taste in the mouth than some of us relish there are
others who like their fiction to be strong'ſ sugared. June,

an orphan child, was looked after by nigger servants, and
by one, Mammy, in particular. She possessed a house and
a valley; and a young man prospecting in the latter met
with an accident and was discovered by the child. Hence
complications, and the removal of June from her home to
be educated with some cousins. Then poverty, hard times
and plenty of pluck. But the clouds began to lift when
June discovered that an emerald cross of hers was worth
four thousand dollars; and finally the sun burst forth
when, through the agency of the accidental young man,
her property was found to be very valuable, and she more
valuable still—to the young man. It sounds ingenuous,
doesn't it? But not nearly so easy to write as it seems,
for to produce anything as artless as June is an art in itself.
In The Book of the Happy Warrior (LoNGMANs) a chivalrous
modern knight holds up to our youngsters the patterns of
an older chivalry to teach them courage, clean fighting and
devoted service. Sir HENRY NEwBolt claims that the
tradition of the public schools is the direct survival of the
mediaeval training for knighthood, and incidentally defends
flannelled and muddied youth from hasty aspersions. Roland
The Puppet, by JANE HARDING (UNwiN), is not with-
out merit, but the faults of the beginner are present in
manifold. The heroine tells her story in the first person—
a difficult method of handling fiction at the best—and in
the result we find a young lady of no particular education
or apparent attainments holding forth in the stilted diction
of a rather prosy early-Victorian Archbishop. The effect
of unreality produced goes far to spoil a plot which is
wound and unwound with considerable skill. Miss HARD-
ING will write a good novel yet, but she must learn to
make her characters act the parts she assigns to them.
We all must be writing books about the War. It is natural
enough to suppose one's own share of war-work is worthy of
record, and indeed, when we come to think of it, the historian
of the future will get his complete picture of the time only
when he realises how every scrap of the national energy was
absorbed in the one master purpose. That being so it is
arguable that Mr. WARD MUIR was thinking far ahead in
compiling his hospital reminiscences, Observations of an
Orderly (SIMPKIN). One hastens to make it clear that the
last thing intended or desired is to disparage the usefulness or

RICHARD LION-HEART,

of modern war. Per-
haps in the glorious

Flying Corps they
might recognise some
faint semblance of their
ancient method. Sir
HENRY, rightly from his
point of view, chooses
to ignore the wholesale
horrors of to-day's war-

T the stark self-sacrifice of

ing in menial capacities

but to tell the truth this
account of sculleries
and laundry - baskets,
polishing påste and
nigger minstrels, bath-
rooms and pillow-slips,
has not much intrinsic
interest about it, nor
are the author's general
reflections very differ-
ent from what one
could supply oneself
without much effort.
His notes on war slang
are about the best thing
in the volume, and I
| liked the story of the
fare and to emphasize the ideal of fighting service as a fine
discipline and proof of manly worth. He shows an obvious,
honest, aristocratic bias, but he does not forget another side
of the matter, as a fragment of an imaginary conversation
between a young lord and a squire present at the great
tourney at St. Inglebert's between the Gentlemen of England
and of France pleasantly shows. The Englishmen were
worsted and took their defeat in a fine sporting spirit. “How
is it we're beaten ? We always win the battles, don't we?”
asks the boy. “The archers win them for us,” says the
Squire. Quite a characteristic little touch of subaltern
modesty | One thought occurs to me especially. It is
unthinkable that a book like this should appear in the
Germany of to-day. It will be worth your while giving
it to your boy to find out why.
Since the practice of writing first novels is becoming
increasingly popular with young authors it was inevitable
that a “First Novel Library” should find its way on to the
market. Whether the classification is to be construed as
an appeal for forbearance for the shortcomings of the
neophyte, or as a warning which a considerate publisher
feels is due to the public, is not for me to say. But the policy
of charging six shillings for these maiden efforts—all that
is required of us for the mature masterpieces of our MAURICE
HEwiBTTs and ARNoLD BENNETTs—is open to question.
blinded soldiers—feeling anything in the world but mournful
or pathetic—who played pranks on the Tube escalator; but
on the whole this is a book which will be of considerable
interest only to the writer's fellow-labourers. They, beyond
any doubt, will be glad to read this history of their
familiar rounds and common tasks.
Wanted, a Tortoise-Shell (LANE) would have made an
excellent short story, but to pursue its farcical develop-
ments through three hundred pages requires a considerable
amount of perseverance. The scene of Mr. PETER BLUN-
DELL's book is laid in tropical Jallagar, where the British
Resident was keener on cats than on his duties. A male
tortoise-shell was what he fanatically and almost feroci-
ously desired, and to obtain it he was ready to barter his
daughter to one Kamp, who is tersely described as “a fat
Swede.” I conceived a strong distaste for this large and
perspiring man, and can congratulate Mr. BLUNDELL on
having created a character odious enough to linger in the
memory. For the rest there are some gleams of real fun
where a beach-comber tries to palm off a dyed cat as the
long-deferred tortoise-shell, and the exit of this animal from
a world too covetous to hold it is thoroughly sound farce.
But on the whole I failed to get many of those quiet gurgles
of delight which are the best tribute one can pay to a funny
man's work.

VISITORS.
WHEN I was very ill in bed
The fairies came to visit me;
They danced and played around my
head,
Though other people couldn't see.
Across the end a railing goes
With bars and balls and twisted rings,
And there they jiggled on their toes
And did the wonderfullest things.
They balanced on the golden balls,
They jumped about from bar to bar,
And then they fluttered to the walls
Where coloured birds and roses are.
I watched them darting in and out,
I watched them gaily climb and cling,
While all the roses moved about
And all the birds began to sing.
And when it was no longer light
I felt them up my pillows creep,
And there they sat and sang all night—
I heard them singing in my sleep.

THE MUD LARKS.
THE Babe went to England on leave.
Not that this was any new experience
for him; he usually pulled it off about
once a quarter—influence, and that sort
of thing, you know. He went down to
the coast in a carriage containing seven-
teen other men, but he got a fat sleepy
youth to sit on, and was passably
comfortable. He crossed over in a
wobbly boat packed from cellar to attic
with Red Tabs invalided with shell
shock, Blue Tabs with trench fever,
and Green Tabs with brain - fag ;
The A.P.M. didn't know anything
about France or its little shops, and
didn't intend to investigate; at any
rate not while there was a war on
there. “You will return to the
Front to-morrow,” said he. The Babe
grasped his hand from him and shook
it warmly. “Thank you—thank you,
Sir,” he gushed; “I didn't want to
come, but they made me. I'm from
Fiji; have no friends here, and London
is somehow so different from Suva it
makes my head ache. I am broke and
couldn't afford leave, anyway. Thank
you, Sir—thank you.”
which was still behaving as such,
and the Babe got a room. He re-
mained in that room all the evening,
beneath the bed, having his meals
pushed in to him under the door. A
prowling A.P.M. sniffed at the keyhole
but did not investigate further, which
was fortunate for the Babe, who had
no regulation pyjamas.
Next morning, crouched on the bot-
tom boards of another taxi, he was
taken to his tailor, poured himself into
the faithful fellow’s hands, and only |
departed when guaranteed to be abso-
lutely A.P.M.-proof. He went to the
Mechanical Transporters in
spurs and stocks, jam merchants
in revolvers and bowie-knives,
Military Police festooned with
pickelhaubes, and here and there
a furtive fighting man who had
got away by mistake, and would
be recalled as soon as he landed.
The leave train rolled into
Victoria late in the afternoon.
Cab touts buzzed about the
Babe, but he would have none
of them; he would go afoot the
better to see the sights of the
village—a leisurely sentimental
pilgrimage. He had not covered
one hundred yards when a ducky
little thing pranced up to him,
squeaking, “Where are your
gloves, Sir?” “I always put
'em in cold storage during sum-
mer along with my muff and
boa, dear,” the Babe replied
pleasantly. “Moreover, my
mother doesn't like me to talk
to strangers in the streets, so ta-
ta.” The little creature blushed
like a tea-rose and stamped its
little hoof. “Insolence l’ it
squeaked. “You—you go back
to France by the next boat l”

some oysters for a start, polished
them off and bade the waiter
trot up the consommé. The
waiter shook his head, “Can't

“Good Lord!” said the Babe,
and bolted. He bolted as far
as the next restaurant, had a
three-and-sixpenny entrée there,
went on to another for sweets,
and yet another for coffee and
trimmings. These short bursts
between courses kept his ap-
petite wonderfully alive.
That afternoon he ran across
a lady friend in Bond Street, “a

She had been at Yvonne's trying

He flung himself down on his knees,
licking the A.P.M.'s boots and crying
in a loud voice that he would be good
and never do it again.
The A.P.M. pardoned the Babe (he
wanted to save the polish on his boots)
on condition that he immediately pur-
chased a pair of gloves of the official
cut and hue. The Babe did so forth-
with and continued on his way. He
had not continued ten yards when
another A.P.M. tripped him up. “That
cap is a disgrace, Sir!” he barked. “I
know it, Sir,” the Babe admitted, “and
I'm awfully sorry about it; but that
hole in it only arrived last night—
shrapnel, you know—and I haven't
had time to buy another yet. I don't
care for the style they sell in those
little French shops—do you?”
“Ahem—in that case I will revoke
my decision,” said the A.P.M. “Buy
yourself an officially-sanctioned cap
and carry on.”
The Babe bought one with alacrity;
then, having tasted enough of the dan-
gers of the streets for one afternoon,
took a taxi, and, lying in the bottom
well out of sight, sped to his old
hotel. When he reached his old hotel
he found it had changed during his
absence, and was now headquarters
of the Director of Bones and Dripping.
He abused the taxi-driver, who said he
was sorry, but there was no telling
these days; a hotel was a hotel one
moment, and the next it was some-
thing entirely different. Motion pic-
tures weren't in it, he said.
Finally they discovered a hotel
and needed some relaxation. So she
engaged the Babe for the play, to be
followed by supper with herself and
her civilian husband. The play (a War-
drama) gave the Babe a fine hunger,
but the Commissionaire (apparently
a Major-General) who does odd jobs
outside the Blitz took exception to
him. “Can't go in, Sir.” “Why not?”
the Babe inquired; “my friends have
gone in.” “Yessir, but no hofficers
are allowed to obtain nourishment
after 10 P.M. under Defence of the
Realm Act, footnote (a) to para. 14004.”
He leaned forward and whispered be-
hind his glove, “There's a Hay Pee Hem
under the portico watching your move-
ments, Sir.” The Babe needed no fur-
ther warning; he dived into his friends'
Limousine and burrowed under the rug.

Sometime later the door of the car
was opened cautiously and the moon-

through the crack. “Hall clear for the

He thrust a damp banana in the Babe's
hand and closed the door softly.
Next morning the Babe dug up an old
suit of 1914 “civies” and put them on.
A woman in the Tube called him “Cuth-
bert” and informed him gratuitously
that her husband, twice the Babe's age,
had volunteered the moment Conscrip-
tion was declared and had been fighting
bravely in the Army Clothing Depart-
ment ever since. Further she sup-
posed the Babe's father was in Parlia-
ment and that he was a Conscientious
Objector. In Hyde Park one urchin
addressed him as “Daddy” and asked
him what he was doing in the Great
War; another gambolled round and
round him making noises like a rabbit.
In Knightsbridge a Military Policeman
wanted to arrest him as a deserter. The
Babe hailed a taxi and, cowering on the
floor, fled back to his hotel and changed
into uniform again.
That night, strolling homewards in
the dark immersed in thought, he in-
advertently took a pipe out of his of aeroplanes, like flies in the amber of
pocket and lit it. An A.P.M. who had
been sleuthing him for half-a-mile leapt
upon him, snatched the pipe and two
or three teeth out of his mouth and
returned him to France by the next
boat.

His groom, beaming welcome, met
him at the railhead with the horses.
“Hello, old thing, cheerio and all the
rest of it,” Huntsman whinnied lovingly.
Miss Muffet rubbed her velvet muzzle
against his pocket. “Brought a lump
of sugar for a little girl?” she rumbled.
He mounted her and headed across
country, Miss Muffet pig-jumping and
capering to show what excellent spirits
she enjoyed.
Two brigades of infantry were under
canvas in Mud Gully, their cook fires
winking like red eyes. The guards
clicked to attention and slapped their
butts as the Babe went by. A subaltern
bobbed out of a tent and shouted to
him to stop to tea. “We’ve got cake,”
he lured, but the Babe went on.
A red-hat cantered across the stubble
before him waving a friendly crop,
“Pip” Vibart the A.P.M. homing to
H.Q. “Evening, boy!” he holloaed;
“come up and Bridge to-morrow night,”
and swept on over the hillside. A flight
sunset, droned overhead en route for
Hunland. The Babe waved his official
cap at them: “Good hunting, old dears.”
They had just started feeding up in
the regimental lines when he arrived;
the excited neighing of five hundred
horses was music to his ears. His
brother subalterns hailed his return
with loud and exuberant noises, made
disparaging remarks about the smart-
ness of his clothes, sat on him all over
the floor and rumpled him. On sight-
ing the Babe, The O'Murphy went mad
and careered round the table wriggling
like an Oriental dancer, uttering shrill
yelps of delight; presently he bounced
out of the window, to enter some minutes
later by the same route, and lay the
offering of a freshly slain rat at his
best beloved's feet.
At this moment the skipper came in
plastered thick with the mud of the
line, nodded cheerfully to his junior
sub and instantaneously fell upon the
buttered toast.
“Have a good time, Son?" he mum-
bled. “How's merrie England?”
“Oh, England's all right, Sir,” said
the Babe, tickling The O'Murphy's up-
turned tummy—“quite all right; but
it's jolly to be home again among one's
ain folk.” PATLANDER.

BEASTS ROYAL.
V
KING Louis’ PEAcock. A.D. 1678.
THE paven terrace of Versailles
With tub and orange-tree,
And Dian's fountain tossed awry,
Were planned and made for me;
Since no one half so well as I
Could grace their symmetry,
Nor teach admiring man
- The genuine pavane.
I know that when KING Louis wears
A Roman kilt and casque -
His smile hides many secret tears
In ballet and in masque,
Since to outshine my pomp appears
So desperate a task,
And royal robes look pale
Beside my noble tail.
With turquoise and with malachite,
With bronze and purple pied,
I march before him like the night
In all its starry pride;
LULLI may twang and MoLIERE write
His pastime to provide,
But seldom laughs the KING
So much as when I sing.
His fiddles brown and pipes of brass
May LULLI now forsake,
While I make music on the grass
Before the storm-clouds break;
He stops his ears and cries “Alas!”
Because he cannot make
With all his fiddlers fine
A melody like mine.
LE BRUN is watching me, I know,
His palette on his thumb,
To catch the glory and the glow
That dazzle as I come;
So be it—but let MolićRE go,
And LULLI crack his drum ; .
They do but waste their time;
Minstrel I am, and mime.
Men say the KING is like the sun,
And from his wig they spin
The golden webs that, one by one,
Draw Spain and Flanders in ;
He will grow proud ere they have
done,
A most egregious sin,
And one to which my mind
Has never yet declined.

PRESENCE OF MIND.
THE train came to one of those
sudden stops in which the hush caused
by the contrast between the rattle of
the wheels and their silence is almost
painful. During these pauses one is
conscious of conversation in neighbour-
ing compartments, without however
hearing any distinct words.
There were several of us, strangers
to each other, who hitherto had been
minding our own business, but under
the stress of this untoward thing be-
came companionable.
A man at each window craned his
body out, but withdrew it without in-
formation.
“I hope,” said another, “there's not
an accident.”
“I have always heard,” said a fourth,
“that in a railway accident presence
of mind is not so valuable as absence
of body”—getting off this ancient
pleasantry as though it were his own.
The motionlessness of the train was
so absolute as to be disconcerting; also
a scandal. The business of trains,
between stations, is to get on. We
had paid our money, not for undue
stoppages, but for movement in the
direction of our various goals; and it
was infamous. -
Somebody said something of the kind.
“Better be held up now,” said a
sententious man, “than be killed for
want of prudence.”
No one was prepared to deny this,
but we resented its truth and availed
ourselves of a true-born free Briton's
right to doubt the wisdom of those in
authority. We all, in short, looked as
though we knew better than engine-
driver, signalman or guard. That is
our métier.
Some moments, which, as in all
delays on the line, seemed like hours,
passed and nothing happened. Looking
out I saw heads and shoulders protrud-
ing from every window, with curiosity
stamped on all their curves.
“They should tell us what's the
matter,” said an impatient man.
“That's one of the stupid things in
England—no one ever tells you what's
wrong. No tact in this country—no
imagination.”
We all agreed. No imagination. It
was the national curse.
“And yet,” said another man with
a smile, “we get there.”
“Ah! that 's our luck,” said the im-
patient man. “We have luck far
beyond our deserts.” He was very
cross about it.
Again the first man to speak hoped
it was not an accident; and again the
second man, fearing that someone
might have missed it, repeated the
old jest about presence of mind and
absence of body.
“Talking of presence of mind,” said
a man who had not yet spoken, emerg-
ing from his book, “an odd thing hap-
pened to me not so very long ago—
since the War—and, as it chances,
happened in a railway carriage too—
as it might be in this. It is a story
against a friend of mine, and I hope
he's wiser now, but I'll tell it to you.”
We had not asked for his story but
we made ourselves up to listen.
“It was during the early days of
the War,” he said, “before some of us
had learned better, and my friend and
I were travelling to the North. He is
a very good fellow, but a little hasty,
and a little too much disposed to think
everyone wrong but himself. Opposite
us was a man hidden behind a news-
paper, all that was visible of him being
a huge pair of legs in knickerbockers,
between which was a bag of golf-clubs.
“My friend at that time was not only
suspicious of everyone's patriotism but
a deadly foe of golf. He even went so
far as to call it Scotgh croquet and
other contemptuous names. I saw him
watching the clubs and the paper and
speculating on the age of the man,
whose legs were, I admit, noticeably
young, and he drew my attention to
him too—by nudges and whispers.
Obviously this was a shirker.
“For a while my friend contented
himself with half-suppressed snorts
and other signs of disapproval, but at
last he could hold himself in no longer.
Leaning forward he tapped the man
smartly on the knee, with the question,
‘Why aren't you in khaki ?’ It was an
inquiry, you will remember, that was
being much put at the time—before
compulsion came in.
“We all—there were two or three
other people in the compartment—felt
that this was going too far; and I
knew it only too well when the man
lowered his paper to see what was
happening and revealed an elderly face
with a grey beard absolutely out of
keeping with those vigorous legs.
“To my intense relief, however, he
seemed to have been too much en-
grossed by his paper to have heard.
At any rate he asked my friend to
repeat his remark.
“Here, you will agree, was, if ever,
an opening for what we call presence
of mind.
“My friend, like myself, had been so
taken aback by the apparition of more
than middle age which confronted him
when the paper was lowered that for
the moment he could say nothing; the
other passengers were in an ecstasy of
anticipation; the man himself, a for-
midable antagonist if he became nasty,

waited for the reply with a non-com-
mittal expression which might conceal
pugnacity and might genuinely have
resulted from not hearing and desiring
to hear.
“And then occurred one of the most
admirable instances of resourcefulness
in history. With an effort of self-col-
lection and a readiness for which I
shall always honour him, my friend
said, speaking with precise clearness,
“I beg your pardon, Sir, but, mistaking
you for a golfing friend of mine at
Babbacombe, I asked you why you
were not in Torquay. I offer my
apologies.’
“At these words the golfer bowed
and resumed his paper, the other pas-
sengers ceased for the moment to have
the faintest interest in a life which
was nothing but Dead Sea fruit, and
my friend uttered a sigh of relief as he
registered a vow never to be a meddle-
some idiot again. But he looked years

CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER IV.
George. I must ask you, Mamma,
before we talk of anything else, whether
Withsak and Alldane were beheaded ?
Mrs. M. No; you will be relieved to
hear that, although ALFRED was greatly
incensed against them and had resolved
to proceed to the enforcement of the
extreme penalty, they were rescued by
the intervention of the Archbishop of
CANTERBURY and afterwards granted a
free pardon on condition of abstaining
from all participation in public life.
This magnanimity on the part of
ALFRED is all the more praiseworthy
as many people firmly believed that
these two princes had attempted to
poison him, and that they were respon-
sible for all the calamities which had
befallen England from the invasion of
JULIUS CAESAR, and which were des-
tined to befall her till the end of time.
Indeed a writer in an old saga, known
as the Blackblood Saga, went so far as
to maintain that the English climate
had been permanently ruined by the
incantations of Prince Alldane. Un-
doubtedly his name was an unfortunate
one at the time, but, to judge by the
old portraits I showed you, neither of
these princes looked capable of such
atrocities, and Prince Alldane was de-
scribed as being the essence of rotundity.

quartern loaf 2
Mrs. M. Yes; before his time the
nobles lived exclusively on cake and
venison, while the peasantry subsisted
on herbs and a substance named woad,

digestions. ALFRED, who among his
many accomplishments was an expert
baker, himself gave instructions to the
wives of the poor, supplied them with
flour, the grinding of which was carried
out in mills of his own devising, and
insisted that all loaves should be made
of a certain quality and size, with re-
sults most beneficial to the physique of
his subjects. The story of his quarrel
with the woman who would insist on
baking cakes illustrates the difficulties
he encountered in effecting his reforms.
Mary. Was not ALFRED called “Eng-
land's Darling” 2
Mrs. M. Yes, my dear, and no wonder.
Before his time there were no proper
newspapers, the few issued being of
high price and written in an elaborate
style which only appealed to the highly
educated. ALFRED changed all this, and
insisted that they should be written in a
“simple, sensuous and passionate style.”
This was one of the causes of his falling
out with Withsak, who supported the
old-fashioned methods, while ALFRED
was in favour of simplicity and brevity.
You will find all this related in the
work of Leo Maximus, a learned writer,
the friend and admirer of ALFRED and
author of his Life.

MARIANA IN WAR-TIME.
THIS tedious and important War
Has altered much that went before,
But did you hear about the change
At Mariana's Moated Grange?
You all of you will recollect
The gross condition of neglect
In which the place appeared to be,
And Mariana's apathy, .
Her idleness, her want of tone,
Her—well, her absence of backbone.
Her relatives, no doubt, had tried
To single out the brighter side,
Had scolded her about the moss
And only made her extra cross.
But when the War had really come
At once the place began to hum,
And Mariana, bless her heart'
She threw herself into the part
Of cooking for the W.A.D.
And wholly lost her lethargy.
She sent her gardeners off pell-mell
(They hadn't kept the gardens well),
And got a lady-gardener in
Who didn't cost her half the tin,
And who, before she'd been a day,
Had scraped the blackest moss away.
She put a jolly little boat
For wounded soldiers on the moat;
Her relatives were bound to own
How practical the girl had grown.
She often said, “I feel more cheery,
I doubt if I can stick this dreary
Old grange again when peace is rife;
You really couldn't call it life.”
But something infinitely more
Than just a European War
Would have been requisite to part
Romance from Mariana's heart;
Once more she felt within her stir
The dawn of une affaire de cour;
In other words, I must confess
She found her thoughts were centred
less
On that young man who never came
And more on Captain What's-his-
name,
Who'd left his other leg in France
And was a model of romance.

The wedding was a pretty thing;
I sent the “Idylls of the King,”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, October 16th. — To Mr.
Punch's blunt inquiry, “Why?” in
| last week's cartoon different answers
would, I suppose, be returned by
various Members. The CHANCELLOR
oF THE ExchequeB would say that the
reassembling of Parliament was neces-
sary in order that he might obtain a
further Vote of Credit from the repre-
sentatives of the taxpayers. Brigadier-
General PAGE CROFT, inventor and
C.-in-C. of the new “National” party,
who has already attached to himself a
following not inferior numerically to
the little band which, under Lord RAN-
DoIPH CHURCHILL in the eighties, struck
terror into the hearts of the Front
Benches, longs to prove that, under his
brilliant leadership, Lord
DUNCANNON, Sir RICHARD
Cooper and Major Row-
LAND HUNT will emulate
the early prowess of Sir
John GoRST, Sir HENRY
DRUMMOND - Wolff and
Mr. ARTHUR BALFour.
But a word to the gal-
lant General: he will do
little until he has secured
a corner-seat. By hook or
by crook Mr. Houston,
“the Pirate King,” must
be induced or compelled
to surrender his coign of
vantage to the new gen-
eralissimo, who will then
be able alternately to pour
a broadside into the Gov-
ernment or to enfilade the
ex-Ministers who aid and
abet them.
Then there are those humanized
notes of interrogation like Mr. KING,
Mr. Hogg|E and Mr. PEMBERTON BIL-
LING. They would like Parliament to
be in permanent session in order that
the world might have the daily benefit
of their searching investigations. Mr.
KING has not yet quite run into his
best form. He had only six Questions
on the Paper, and actually asked only
five of them—a concession which so
paralysed the MINISTER of REcon-
STRUCTION, to whom the missing Ques-
tion was addressed, that, when asked
where his department was located, he
had to confess that he did not know the
precise number, but it was somewhere
in Queen Anne's Gate.
Eclipsed in Ireland by the more
spectacular attractions of Sinn Fein,
the Nationalists' only hope of recover-
ing their lost popularity is to kick up
the dust of St. Stephen's. Accordingly
Mr. REDMOND gave notice of yet another
Vote of Censure on the Irish Executive,
but whether for its slackness or its
brutality the terms of his motion do not
make quite clear. Perhaps he has not
yet made up his own mind on th
subject. -
I feel sure that Mr. MonTAGU has a
sense of humour, and I admired the
way in which he concealed its existence
when explaining the Indian Govern-
ment's release of Mrs. BESANT. As he
read the WICERoy's reference to “the
tranquillizing effect of Mr. MonTAGU's
approaching visit” the House rippled
with laughter; and when he proceeded
to say that Mrs. BESANT had under-
taken to use her influence to secure
“a calm atmosphere for my visit,” the
ripple became a wave. But with the
stoicism of the unchanging East he
read on unmoved.
Mr. KENNEDY Jones, taking up the

16TH A CERTAIN LIVELINESS WAS OBSERVED ON THE HIBERNIAN FRONT.
rôle of the newsboy in a recent cartoon,
invited the Government to give the
Germans the monosyllabic equivalent
for a very warm time. Mr. BoNAR LAw
declined to commit himself to the actual
term, but announced the intention to
set up a new Air Ministry, and to “em-
ploy our machines over German towns
so far as military needs render us free
to take such action.”
To return to Mr. Punch's question,
“Why?” I think the answer most
Members would make would be, “Be-
cause we wanted to see what the
Ladies' Gallery would look like without
the grille.” It must be confessed that
those who cherished visions of a dull
assembly made glorious by flashing
eyes, white arms, and brilliant dresses
were disappointed.
“Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage,”
wrote LovELACE. Well, the iron bars
have gone, but the stone walls remain,
and make, if not a prison, something
very like a purdah ;... and the “angels
alone that soar above" are almost as
much cut off from the inferior beings
below them as they were before Sir
ALFRED MoRD came to the rescue of
Beauty in thrall. He is rather dis-
appointed at getting so little change
out of his “fiver.”
Wednesday, October 17th.-The latest
recruit to what John KNox would have
called the “monstrous regiment of
Ministers” is Mr. WARDLE, lately
Chairman of the Labour Party. He
made a promising début. Mr. Hogge
professed to be anxious as to the future
of the North-Eastern Railway, which,
according to him, had lent all its “genii”
to the Admiralty. Mr. WARDLE, quick
to note the classical accuracy of the
plural, assured him that he need be
under no apprehensions—“there are
still some genii left.”
Ireland is to have the
extended franchise con-
ferred by the Representa-
tion of the People Bill,
but not the accompanying
redistribution of seats.
The Chairman suggested
that Sir John LoNSDALE,
who wanted to do away
with the anomaly, should
move a supplementary
schedule embodying his
own ideas of how Ireland
should be redistributed.
Unfortunately — for one
would have liked to see
how much was left for the
other three provinces after
he had designed an Ulster
commensurate with his
notion of its relative im-
portance—the hon. Bar-
onet demurred to this tempting pro-
posal, and thought it was a matter for
the Government.
Some very pleasant badinage between
Lord HUGH CECIL and the HoME SEC-
RETARY as to the relative merits of the
words “dwell” and “reside’’ for the
purpose of defining a voter's qualifica-
tion was followed by an exhaustive and
exhausting lecture by Major CHAPPLE
on how to tabulate the alternative votes
in a three-cornered election. His object
was to demonstrate that under the
Government scheme the man whom
the majority of the voters might desire
would infallibly be rejected, while by a
plan of his own, which he had tried
successfully on a couple of wounded
soldiers, the best man invariably won.
Thursday, October 18th.-The most
obliging of men, Sir ALFREDMoND never-
theless draws the line when he is asked
to look a gift horse in the mouth. His
predecessor at the Office of Works
having offered a site for a statue of
President LINcolN, it is not for him

described as “a tramp with the colic.”
It is thought that the American donors,
after an exhaustive study of our out-

The “Nationals" are beginning to
move. Their General elicited from the
Government a promise to introduce a

though it is possible that this would
have been done without his interven-
tion. His lieutenants were less success-
ful. Sir Richard Cooper could not
persuade Mr. BoNAR LAw to publish
the official report on the loss of the
Hampshire, and is now more than ever
convinced that K. OF K. is languish-
ing in a German prison-camp; while
the HoME SECRETARY intimated that
he required no instruction from Major
Rowland HUNT in the business of
suppressing seditious literature.
After all, Ireland is to be redistributed.
Unless the success of the Convention
renders the task superfluous, the Gov-
ernment will appoint a Boundary Com-
mission as an act of simple justice.
Needless to say the announcement was
received with frenzied abuse by all the
Nationalist factions. Abstract justice,
it seems, is the very last thing that
Ireland wants.
GADGETS AND STUNTS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Aware as you
must be of a deplorable confusion now
prevailing in the public mind as to
the true inwardness of the expressions
“gadget” and “stunt,” you will agree,
I am sure, that the moment has come
for a clear and authoritative ruling on
this vexed point. At a time when the
pundits of the Oxford Dictionary are
coldly aloof, like GALLIo, and the Army
Council, though often approached,
studiously reserve their decision, it
rests with you Mr. Punch, as Arbiter
of National Opinion, to give judgment.
What notion, then, of “gadget" and
“stunt " is gained by the young
subaltern of to-day as he joins his
regiment and shakes down to the fun-
damental facts of life and death 2 He
finds himself harassed by no end of
devilish enemy stunts, to stultify which
a fatherly all-wise War Office has given
him an infinity of gadgets. For every
stunt an appropriate countering gadget.
Does the foe strafe him with a gas-
bombing stunt 2 “Ha, ha!” laughs
he, and dons that unlovely but priceless
gadget, his box-respirator. But by no
means all gadgets have just one peculiar
stunt to counter; such a definition
would exclude, for instance, the height-
gauge on a plane, which is emphatically,
wholly and eternally a gadget of gadgets.
Moreover, gadgets are small things.
The airman's “joystick” is a gadget;
the tank is not. Now are these views
sound, Sir, or is it permissible, as one
authority does, to describe persons as
“gadgets”?
One final word. A nervous subaltern
recently appeared before his Adjutant
and called the Wurzel - Flummery
Electro-Dynamical Apparatus, Mark
II., “this sky-plotter stunt.” “Great
Heavens !” gasped the Adjutant, “what
is the Service coming to ? Stunt 2
Gadget, man, gadget !” Three days
later the hapless boy found himself de-
sired to resign on the grounds of “gross
ignorance of military terminology.”
I am, dear Mr. Punch,
Yours solemnly,
ARCHIBAL.D.

STANZAS ON TEA SHORTAGE.
[Mr. M. GRIEve, writing from “The Whins,” Chalfont St. Peter, in
The Daily Mawl of the 12th inst., suggests herb-teas to meet the short-
age, as being far the most healthful substitutes. “They can also,”
he says, “be blended and arranged to suit the gastric idiosyncrasies
of the individual consumer. A few of them are agrimony, comfrey,
dandelion, camomile, woodruff, marjoram, hyssop, sage, horehound,
tansy, thyme, rosemary, stinging-nettle and raspberry.”]
ALTHough, when luxuries must be resigned,
Such as cigars or even breakfast bacon,
My hitherto “unconquerable mind”
Its philosophic pose has not forsaken,
By one impending sacrifice I find
My stock of fortitude severely shaken—
I mean the dismal prospect of our losing
The genial cup that cheers without bemusing.
Blest liquor' dear to literary men,
Which Georgian writers used to drink like fishes,
When cocoa had not swum into their ken
And coffee failed to satisfy all wishes;
When tea was served to monarchs of the pen,
Like Johnson and his coterie, in “dishes,”
And came exclusively from far Cathay—
See “China's fragrant herb" in WoRDsworth's lay.
Beer prompted CALVERLEY's immortal rhymes,
Extolling it as utterly eupeptic;
But on that point, in these exacting times,
The weight of evidence supports the sceptic;
Beer is not suitable for torrid climes
Or if your tendency is cataleptic ;
But tea in moderation, freshly brewed,
Was never by Sir ANDREw CLARR tabooed.
We know for certain that the GRAND OLD MAN
Drank tea at midnight with complete impunity,
At least he long outlived the Psalmist's span
And from ill-health enjoyed a fine immunity;
Besides, robust Antipodeans can -
And do drink tea at every opportunity;
While only Stoics nowadays contrive
To shun the cup that gilds the hour of five.
But war is war, and when we have to face
Shortage in tea as well as bread and boots
"Tis well to teach us how we may replace
The foreign brew by native substitutes,
Extracted from a vegetable base
In various wholesome plants and herbs and fruits,
“Arranged and blended,” very much like teas,
To suit our “gastric idiosyncrasies.”
It is a list for future use to file,
Including woodruff, marjoram and sage,
Thyme, agrimony, hyssop, camomile
(A name writ painfully on childhood's page),
Tansy, the jaded palate to beguile,
Horehound, laryngeal troubles to assuage,
And, for a cup ere mounting to the stirrup,
The stinging-nettle's stimulating syrup.
And yet I cannot, though I gladly would,
Forget the Babylonian monarch's cry,
“It may be wholesome, but it is not good,”
When grass became his only food supply;
Such weakness ought, of course, to be withstood,
But oh, it wrings the teardrop from my eye
To think of Polly putting on the kettle
To brew my daily dose of stinging-nettle!

AT THE PLAY.
“DEAR BRUTUs.”
THERE are great ways of borrowing, as
EMERSON said, and in his new Fantasy
Sir JAMEs BARRIE has given us a very
charming variation on A Midsummer
Night's Dream (with echoes of Peter
Pan and The Admirable Crichton).
Certainly I got far more fun out of his
deluded lovers in the Magic Wood than
I ever extracted from the comedy of
errors which occurred between the
ladies and gentlemen of the Court of
Theseus.
In Dear Drutus the contrast between
real life and the life of Magic-
land is sharply accentuated by the
set of characters for each ; the
same men and women figure in
both, making abrupt transitions
from one to the other and back
again. We have a house party of
actual humans (not too obtru-
sively actual), most of whom, in-
cluding the butler, imagine that if
they could have a Second Chance
in life they would not make such
a mess of it as they did with the
First. One of them thinks he
would never have taken to drink
and lost his self-respect and his
wife's love if he had only had a
child; one that he would not
have become a pilferer if he had
stuck to the City; others that
they would have done better to
have married Somebody Else.
Well, they are all whisked off into
the Magic Wood, and there they
get their Second Chance. The
pilferer becomes a successful
tradesman in a large and quest-
ionable way; the tippler finds
various married folk get re-sorted;
and so forth.
The moral purpose (if any) of the
author, as conveyed to us through the
mouth of the leading humourist of the
party, is to show that a man's nature
would remain the same even if he got
a Second Chance. Unfortunately—but
what can you expect in the realm of
Magic”—the scheme does not work out
with any logical consistency. It is true
that the philanderer and the pilfering
butler show little promise of making
anything out of their Second Chance;
but, on the other hand, the childless
tippler seems to have undergone reform-
ation and recovered his wife's regard ;
and, if I rightly interpreted certain
delicate indications, they propose to
have a pearl of a daughter, later on.

Caroline, who in the Wood becomes
enamoured of the butler-turned-pluto-
crat (cf. Titania and Bottom) and
subsequently returns to her sniffi-
ness, cannot be said to have lost
much by failing to utilise her Second
Chance. . -
However, one might never have
troubled, about Sir JAMEs's logic if he
had not declared his moral purpose in
set terms. I suppose he had to explain
his title, which was sufficiently obscure.
It comes, as Mr. SoTHERN kindly in-
formed us, from the lines:—
“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves.”

to whom certain things were caviare.
He is the typical man in the audience,
to whom Sir JAMEs says: “You, too,
Brutus; I'm talking at you.”
Happily (for my taste, anyhow) the
humour of the play dominates its senti-
ment. And where the sentiment of the
child Margaret threatens to overstrain
itself we had always the healthy antidote
of Mr. DU MAURIER's practical methods
to correct its tendency to cloy. He was
extraordinarily good both as himself
and, for a rare change, as somebody
quite different. Miss FAITH CELLI as
his daughter—a sort of Peter Pan girl
who does grow up, far too tall—was
delightful in the true BARRIE manner.
It was a pity—but that was not her
fault—that she had to end her long and
difficult scene on rather a false note.
I am almost certain that no child (out-
\\ y
side a BARRIE play), who is left alone
in a Magic Wood, scared out of her
life, would cry aloud, “Daddy, daddy,
I don't want to be a Might-have-been.”
The sentiment of the words was, of
course, part of the scheme, but it was
not for her to say them.
Mr. NorMAN FoRBEs, in the Wood,
was an elderly piping faun and per-
formed with astonishing agility a sword-
dance over a stick crossed with his
whistle. Elsewhere as Mr. Coade he
played very engagingly the part of the
only character who had made such good
use of his First Chance that he really
didn't need a Second. Both in name
and nature he brought to mind
the late Mr. CHOATE, who gallantly
declared that if he had not been
what he was he would have liked
to be his wife's second husband.
And no wonder that Mr. Coade
wanted nothing better than to
remain attached to so adorable a
creature as his wife, played with
a delightful homeliness by Miss
MAUDE MILLETT, who has lost
nothing of that charm to which,
with Mr. Coade, we retain the
most faithful devotion.
Mr. WILL WEST was admirable
as a Crichton gone wrong; and
Mr. SoTHERN, as the philanderer
Purdie, took all his Chances of
with the greatest aplomb. They
included some very pleasant
satire on stage manners. I have
only to mention the names of
Miss HILDA MooRE, Miss JESSIE
BATEMAN, Miss DoRISLYTTON and
Miss LYDIA BILBRooKE for you to
understand how excellent a cast
it was, both for wit and grace.
Finally, Mr. ARTHUR HATHER-
ToN, as Lob, the host of the party,
a kind of hoary old Puck who
had a penchant for filling his
house every Midsummer Eve with
people who wanted a Second Chance,
interpreted Sir JAMEs's whimsical fancy
to the very top of freakishness.
I hope, but doubtfully, that there are
enough Dear Brutuses in London (so
many aliens have lately fled) to do
justice to BARRIE at his best. O. S.

Wounded Tommy. “WELL, IT was LIKE when THE MISSIs CoPs YER BE'IND THE EAR WITH A FLAT-IRON-You KNow."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE often pitied the lot of the costume novelist, faced
with the increasing difficulty of providing fresh and unworn
trappings for his characters. Therefore with all the more
warmth do I congratulate those seasoned adventurers,
AGNES and EGERTON CASTLE, on their acumen in discovering
such a setting as that of Wolf-lure (CASSELL). The name
alone should be worth many editions. Nor do the contents
in any sort belie it. This remote country of Guyenne, a
hundred years ago, with its forests and caves and subter-
ranean lakes, with, moreover, its rival wolf-masters, Royal
and Imperial, and its wild band of coiners, is the very
stage for any hazardous and romantic exploit. It should
be added at once that the authors have taken full advantage
of these possibilities. From the moment when the wander-
ing English youth who tells the tale wakes on the hillside
to find himself contemplated by a lovely maiden and a
gigantic wolf-hound, the adventure dashes from thrill to
thrill unpausing. One protest however I must utter. The
conduct of the young and lovely heroine (as above) and her
single-minded devotion to her lover may be true to nature,
but somewhat alienated my own sympathies, already given
to the first-person-singular English lad who also adored
her, and whom both she and her chosen mate treated
abominably. To my thinking, unrequited devotion has no
business in a tale of this sort. Realistic pathos may have
its Dobbin or Tom Pinch, but the wild and whirling episodes
of tushery demand the satisfactory finish hallowed by
custom. With this reservation only I can call Wolf-lure
about the best adventure-novel that the present season has
produced.
Since the opening pages of Calvary Alley (HoDDER AND
STOUGHToN) are concerned with choir-boys and a cathedral
and a rose-window, things to which one gives, without
sufficient reason, an association exclusively of the Old
World, I was a little startled, as the action proceeded, by
the mention of cops and dimes and trolly-cars. Of course
this only meant that I had forgotten, ungratefully, the
country in which any story by ALICE HEGAN RICE might
be expected to be laid. Anyhow, Calvary Alley proves an
admirable entertainment, a tale of a girl's expanding
fortunes, from the grim slum that gives its name to the
book, through many varied experiences of reform schools,
a bottling factory and membership of the ballet, up to the
haven of matrimony. Through them all, Nance, the
heroine, carries a very human and engaging personality,
so that one is made to see the young woman who is clasped
to the heroic breast on the last page as the logical develop-
ment of the ragged urchin stamping her bare foot into the
soft cement of Calvary Alley on the first. Moreover—
wonder of wonders for transatlantic fiction l—the author is
able to write about children, and the contrasted lives of rich
and poor city dwellers, without lapsing into sentimentality
Osi sic omnes / But either American bishops are strangely
different from the English variety, or Mrs. RICE, following
Mr. WELLs's example, has permitted herself an episcopal
burlesque. In either case the resulting portrait is hardly
worthy of an otherwise admirably-drawn collection of
original characters.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Christine (MACMILLAN) contains a very illuminating pic-
ture of Germany in the months immediately preceding the
War; but I am perplexed—and a little provoked—by the
way in which it is presented. The book opens with a
pathetic foreword, signed by Miss ALICE CHOLMoNDELEY,
in which we read: “My daughter Christine, who wrote me
these letters, died at a hospital in Stuttgart on the morn-
ing of August 8th, 1914, of acute double pneumonia. . . . . I
am publishing the letters just as they came to me, leaving
out nothing. . . . The war killed Christine, just as surely
as if she had been a soldier in the trenches. . . . I never
saw her again. I had a telegram saying she was dead.
I tried to go to Stuttgart, but was turned back at the
frontier.” Then follows a Publishers' note to the effect
that some personal names have been altered. After this
one is naturally surprised to find the book advertised as
a “new novel.” All I can say is that, if Miss CHOLMON-
DELEY's preface is true, her book is not a novel, and that,
if it is untrue, I do not think the foreword is fair or in good
taste. My opinion, for what it is worth, is that Miss CHOL-
Mondeley was herself in Germany during the summer of
1914, and has chosen this way of telling us what she saw
have for such purposes, without letting you feel afterwards
that it was wasted. And as a hospital present the col-
lection could hardly be beaten.
Miss MARJoRIE Bowen's historical romances usually have
the merit of swift movement, and that is precisely the
quality I miss in The Third Estate (METHUEN). It does
not march—at least not quick enough. You will not need
to be told that Miss Bowen has saturated herself con-
scientiously in her period—an intensely interesting period
too—and has contrived her atmosphere most competently
and plausibly. But for all that I couldn't make myself
greatly interested in the bold bad Marquis DE SARCEY
in those anxious two years before “the Terror,” with
his insufferable pride, his incredible elegance, his fantastic
ideas of love and his idiotic marriage, the negotiations for
which, with the resulting complications, take up so large
a space in a lengthy book. It gives one the impression of
being written not “according to plan” but out of a random
fancy, with so hurried a pen that not merely have irrelevant
incidents, absurdities of diction, and indubitable longueurs
escaped excision, but such lapses from the King's fair

a popular author—indeed,

The Fortunes of Richard

at once vivid and engaging my advice to you is to read
them and not worry too much about the foreword.
The Four Corners of the World (Hodder AND Stoughton)
is emphatically what I should call a fireside book. On
these chill Autumn evenings, with the rain or the dead
leaves or the shrapnel whirling by outside, you could have
few more agreeable companions than Mr. A. E. W. MASON,
when he is, as here, in communicative mood. He has a
baker's dozen of excellent tales to tell, most of them with a
fine thrill, out of which he gets the greatest possible effect,
largely by the use of a crisp and unemotional style that
lets the sensational happenings go their own way to the
nerves of the reader. As an example of how to make the
most of a good theme, I commend to you the story pleas-
antly, if not very originally, named “The House of Terror.”
Before now I have been ensnared to disappointment by
precisely this title. But Mr. MASON's House holds no
deception; it genuinely does terrify; and when at the
climax of its history the two persons concerned see the
door swing slowly inwards, and “the white fog billowed
into the room,” while “ Glyn felt the hair stir and move
upon his scalp,” I doubt not that you will almost cer-
tainly partake of some measure of his emotion. Naturally,
in a mixed bag such as this, one can't complain if the
quality of the contents varies. Not all the tales reach the
level of “The House of Terror”; but in every one there is
enough artistry to occupy any spare half-hour you may
more to follow; and, as one should call no hero fortunate till
his author has ceased writing, it is as yet too early for a final
pronouncement upon Richard Mahony. My own honest
impression at this stage would be that he is in some danger
of outgrowing his strength. This pathological phrase comes
the more aptly since Richard's fortune, though begun in the
goldfields, was not derived from digging, but from the practice
of medicine, and from a lucky speculation in mining stock (I
liked especially the description of the day when the shares
sold at fifty-three, and Richard “went about feeling a little
more than human"). The end of the whole matter, at least
the end for the present, is that, with his wife, and what he
can get together from the remains of the mining coup, and
the sale of a somewhat damaged practice, Richard sets forth
for England. Obviously more turns of fortune are in store
there for him and Mary and that queer character, his one-
time inseparable, Purdy. That I anticipate their future
with much interest is a genuine tribute to the humanity
in which Mr. RICHARDsoN has clothed his cast. Richard
Mahony, in short, is a real man, whose fortunes take a
genuine hold upon one's attention; though I repeat that
I could wish his author had told them less wordily, and
—in one glaring instance—with a greater respect for the
decencies of medical reticence.

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARL
ZEPP-FLIGHTING IN THE HAUTES ALPES.
To J. M.
RECALL, dear John, a certain day
Back in the times of long ago–
A stuffy old estaminet
Under the great peaks fledged with snow;
The Spring that set our hearts rejoicing
As up the serried mountains' bar
We climbed our tortuous way Rolls-Roycing
From Gap to Col Bayard.
Little we dreamed, though that high air
Quickens imagination's flight,
What monstrous bird and very rare
Would in these parts some day alight;
How, like a roc of Arab fable,
A Zepp en route from London town,
Trying to find its German stable,
Would here come blundering down.
The swallows—you remember? yes?–
Northward, just then, were heading straight;
No hint they dropped by which to guess
That other fowl's erratic fate;
An inner sense supplied their vision;
Not one of them contused his scalp
Or lost his feathers in collision
Bumping against an Alp.
But they, the Zepp-birds, flopped and barged
From Lunéville to Walescure
(Where we of old have often charged
The bunkers of the Côte d'Azur); .
And half a brace—so strange and far a
Course to the South it had to shape—
Is still expected in Sahara
Or possibly the Cape.
In happier autumns you and I
(You by your art and I by luck)
Have pulled the pheasant off the sky
Or flogged to death the flighting duck;
But never yet—how few the chances
Of pouching so superb a swag—
Have we achieved a feat like France's
Immortal gas-bag bag.
O. S.
PURPLE PATCHES FROM LORD YORICK'S GREAT B00K.
(Special IReview.)
Lord Yorick's Reminiscences, just published by the house
of Hussell, abound in genial anecdote, in which the “per-
sonal note" is lightly and gracefully struck, in welcome
contrast to the stodgy political memoirs with which we
have been surfeited of late. We append some extracts,
culled at random from these jocund pages:–
THE SHAH's Roxi.ANCE.
“I don't suppose it is a State secret—but if it is there
can be no harm in divulging the fact—that there was some
thought of a marriage in the “eighties' between the Shah
of PERSIA and the lovely Miss Malory, the lineal descendant
of the famous author of the Arthurian epic. Mr. GLADstoNE,
Mme. DE Novikoff and the Archbishop of CANTERBURY
were prime movers in the negotiations. Dut the SHAH's
table manners and his obstinate refusal to be converted to
the doctrines of the Anglican Church, on which Miss Malory
insisted, proved an insurmountable obstacle, and the arrange-
ment, which might have been fraught with inestimable
advantages to Persia, came to nought. Miss Malory after-
wards became Lady Yorick.”
º, afterwards Lady Rootham, was staying with us.
PRACTICAL JokING AT Oxford IN THE “SixTIES."
“Jimmy Greene, afterwards Lord Havering, whose rooms
were just below mine, suffered a good deal from practical
jokers. One day I was chatting with Reggie Wragge when
we heard loud cries for help just below us. We rushed
down and found Jimmy in the bath, struggling with a large
conger-eel which had been introduced by some of his friends.
I held on to the monster's tail, while Wragge severed its
head with a carving-knife. Poor Jimmy, who was always
nervous and not very ‘strong in his intellects,' was much
upset, and was shortly afterwards ploughed for the seventh
time in Smalls. He afterwards went into diplomacy, but
died young.” : -
MRs. MANGoLD's CoMPLExion.
“At one of these dances at Yorick Castle Mrs. Mangold,
She was
a very handsome woman, with a wonderful complexion, so
brilliant, indeed, that some sceptics believed it to be arti-
ficial. A. plot was accordingly hatched to solve the
problem, and during a set of Kitchen Lancers a syphon
of soda-water was cleverly squirted full in her face, but
the colour remained fast. Mrs. Mangold, I am sorry to
say, failed to see the point of the joke, and fled to her
room, pursued as far as the staircase by a score or more
of cheering sportsmen.” -
THE ORDEAL of LADY VERBENA Soper.
“Mr. Gosche N, as he then was, was entertaining a large
party to dinner at Whitehall. He was at the time First Lord
of the Admiralty, and an awkward waiter upset an ice-pud-
ding down the back of Lady Verbena Soper, sister of Lady
‘Loofah' Soper and daughter of the Earl of Latherham.
The poor lady cried out, ‘I'm scalded !' but our host,
with great presence of mind, dashed out, returning with
a bundle of blankets and a can of hot water, which he
promptly poured on to the ice-pudding. The sufferer was
then wrapped up in the blankets and carried off to bed.
The waiter was of course sacked on the spot, but was
saved from prosecution at the express request of his victim
and assisted to emigrate to America, where I believe he
did well on an orange farm in Florida.” -
IN A GOOD CAUSE.
THERE is no War-charity known to Mr. Punch that does
better work or more quietly than that which is adminis-
tered by the Children's Aid Committee, who provide homes
in country cottages and farm-houses for children, most
of them motherless, of our soldiers and sailors, visit them
from time to time and watch over their needs. Here
in these homes their fathers, who are kept informed of
their children's welfare during their absence, come to see
them when on leave from the Front, and find them gently
cared for. Since the War began homes have been provided
for over two thousand four hundred children. A certain
grant in aid is allowed by the London War Pensions
Committee, who have learned to depend upon the Children's
Aid Committee in their difficulties about children, but for
the most part this work relies upon voluntary help, and
without advertisement. Of the money that came into the
Committee's hands last year only about two per cent. was
paid away for salaries and office expenses. -
More than a year ago Mr. Punch appealed on behalf o!
this labour of love, and now he begs his readers to renew
the generous response which they made at that time. Gifts
of money and clothing, and offers of hospitality, will be
gratefully acknowledged by Miss MAxwell, LYTE, Hon.
Treasurer of the Children's Aid Committee, 50, South
Molton Street, London, W.

STRONGER THAN HERSELF.
IN an assortment of nieces, totalling
nine in all—but two of them, being still,
in Sir WALTER's phrase, composed of
“that species of pink dough which is
called a fine infant” do not count—
I think that my favourites are Enid
and Hannah. Enid being the daughter
of a brother of mine, and Hannah of a
sister, they are cousins. They are also
collaborators in literature and joint
editors of a magazine for family con-
sumption entitled The Attic Salt-Cellar.
The word “Attic" refers to the situa-
tion of the editorial office, which is up
a very perilous ladder, and “salt-cellar.”

though adopted, is not yet understood.
During the search for pseudonyms
for the staff—the pseudonym is an
Jack Crawley, a young farmer and
the one that the Lady Lily loves.
Fanny Starlight, a poor relation and
the Lady Lily's very closest friend.
Webb, the Lady Lily's maid.
Such were the characters when the
story began, and at the end of the first
instalment the author, with very great
ingenuity—or perhaps with only a
light-hearted disregard of probability—
got the whole bunch of them on a liner
going to America. The last sentence
described the vessel gliding away from
the dock, with the characters leaning
over the side waving good-bye. Even
Jack Crawley, the young farmer, was
there; but he was not waving with the
others, because he did not want anyone
to know that he knew the Lady Lily,
or was on board at all. Lord Eustace
was on one side of the Lady Lily as
Enid had not only read the feuilletons
in the picture papers but had been to
the Movies too. But no matter what
had influenced her, the story promised
well.
Judge then my surprise when on
opening the next number of The Attic
Salt-Cellar I found that the instal-
ment of the serial consisted only of the
following:— -

nalism, and the easiest
way of securing it is
to turn one's name
round—we came upon
the astonishing dis-
covery that Hannah
is exactly the same
whether you spell it
backwards or forwards.
Hannah therefore calls
herself, again at my
suggestion, “Pal,”
which is short for
“palindrome.” We
also discovered, to her
intense delight, that
Enid, when reversed,
makes “Dine "—a
pleasant word but a
poor pseudonym. She
therefore calls herself,

“Do TELL ME, UNCLE, ALL ABOUT THIS PERSIFLAGE YOU PUT ON YOUR TENTs.”
“Why not, Uncle
Dick 2'' Enid asked.
“Because it 's not
playing the game,” I
said. “After arousing
everyone's interest and
exciting us with the
first chapter, you can't
stop it all like this.”
“But it happened,”
she replied. “Ships
often sink, Uncle Dick,
and this one sank.”
“Well, that 's all
right,” I said, “but,
my dear child, why
drown everyone? Why
not let your own people
be saved? Not the Duke
and Duchess, perhaps,
but the others. Think
after her pet flower, “Marigold.”
Between them Pal and Marigold do
all the work. There is room for an
epigram if you happen to have one
about you, or even an ode, but they
can get along without outside contri.
butions. Enid does most of the writing
and Hannah copies it out.
So much for prelude to the story of
Enid's serial. Having observed that all
the most popular periodicals have serial
stories she decided that she must write
one too. It was called “The Prairie
Lily,” and began splendidly. I give
the list of characters at the head of
the first instalment:—
The Duke of Week, an angry father
and member of the House of Lords.
The Duchess of Week, his wife, once
famous for her beauty.
Lady Lily, their daughter, aged nine-
teen and very lovely.
Mr. Ploot, an American millionaire
who loves the Lady Lily.
Lord Eustace Vavasour, the Lady
Lily's cousin, who loves her.
she waved, and Mr. Ploot on the other,
and they were, of course, consumed
with jealousy of each other.
Having read the first instalment,
with the author's eye fixed embarrass-
ingly upon me, and the author giggling
as she watched, I said that it was very
interesting; as indeed it was. I went
on to ask what part of America they
were all going to, and how it would
end, and so on; and Enid sketched the
probable course of events, which in-
cluded a duel for Lord Eustace and
Mr. Ploot (who turned out to be not
a millionaire at all, but a gentleman
thief) and a very exciting time for the
Lady Lily on a ranche in Texas, whither
she had followed Jack Crawley, who
was to become famous throughout the
States as “The Cowboy King.” I for-
get about the Duke and Duchess, but
a lover was to be found on the ranche
for Fanny Starlight; and Red Indians
were to carry off Webb, who was to be
rescued by the Cowboy King; and so
on. There were, in short, signs that
of all those jolly things
that were going to happen in Texas,
and the duel, and - ?
“Yes, I know,” she replied sadly.
“It's horrid to have to give them up,
but I couldn't help it. The ship would
sink and no one was saved. I shall
have to begin another.”
There's a conscience for you! There's
realism Enid should go far.
I have been wondering if there are
any other writers of serial stories whose
readers would not suffer if similar visi-
tations of inevitability came to them.

I'M GOIN' ON LEAVE TERMORRER.
AIN'T GOT No TIME TO WASTE."
OUR INNOCENT SUBALTERNS.
THE leave-boat had come into port
and there was the usual jam around
the gangways. On the quay at the foot
of one of them was a weary-looking
officer performing the ungrateful task
of detailing officers for tours of duty
with the troops. He had squares of
white cardboard in his hand, and here
and there, as the officers trooped down
the gangway, he picked out a young
and inoffensive-looking subaltern and
subpoenaed him.
I chanced to notice a young and rosy-
cheeked second-lieutenant, innocent of
the ways of this rude world, and I
knew he was doomed.
As he passed out on to the wharf I
saw him receive one of those white
cards; he was also told to report
to the corporal at the end of the
quay.
I saw him slip behind a truck, where
he left his bag and haversack, his
gloves and his cane, and when he re-
appeared on the far side he had on his
rain-coat, without stars. He had also
altered the angle of his cap. -
He waited near the foot of the other
gangway, which was unguarded. I
drew nearer to see what he would do.
Presently down the plank came an
oldish man—a lieutenant with a heavy
moustache and two African ribbons.
My young friend stepped forward.
“You are detailed for duty,” I heard
him say. “You will report to the
N.C.O. at the end of the quay.” His
intonation was a model for the Staff
College.
“Curse the thing ! I knew I should
be nabbed for duty,” I heard the veteran
growl as he strode off with the white
card . . .
I met the young man later at the
Hotel , where he had had the
foresight to wire for a room. As I had
failed to do this, I was glad to avail
myself of his kind offer to share his
accommodation. After such hospitality
I could not refuse him a lift in my car,
as we were both bound for the same
part of the country.
I did not learn until afterwards that
a preliminary chat with my chauffeur
had preceded his hospitable advances.
Whenever anybody tells me that our
subalterns of to-day lack savoir faire
or that they are deficient in tactical
initiative, I tell him that he lies.

And, A. agreeing, they humbly prayed
The great War Office to lend its aid.
In less than a month they got replies,

it was the General himself who first
noticed the omission, and it is a golden
rule for Brigade Majors that they should
always be the first to think of things.
“Ring 'em up and ask,” said the
General. “Don't, of course, mention
the word 'raid' on the telephone. Call
it—um—ah, oh, call it anything you
like so long as they understand what
you mean.”
At times, to the casual eavesdropper,
strange things must appear to be going
on in the British lines. It must be a
matter of surprise, to such a one, that
the British troops can think it worth
their while to inform each other at
midnight that “Two Emperors of
Pongo have become attached to Annie
Laurie.” Nor would it appear that
any military object would be served in
passing on the chatty piece of informa-
tion that “there will be no party for
Windsor to-morrow.” This habit of
calling things and places as they most
emphatically are not is but a conces-
sion, of course, to the habits of the
infamous Hun, who rightly or wrongly
is supposed to overhear everything one
says within a mile of the line.
Thinking in the vernacular proper
to people who keep the little know-
ledge they have to themselves, the
Brigade Major grasped the hated tele-
phone in the left hand and prepared
to say a few words (also in the ver-
nacular) to his fellow Staff Officer a
mile away.
“Hullo!” Br-rr–Crick-crick. “Hullo,
Signals' Give me S. Salmon.”
“Salmon? You're through, Sir,”
boomed a voice apparently within a
foot of his ear.
“OO!” An earsplitting crack was
followed by a mosquito-like voice sing-
ing in the wilderness.
“ Hullo 1 ''
“ Hullo!”
“This is Pike.”
“This is Possum. H-hullo, Pike!”
“Hullo, Possum !”
“I say, look here, the General w-wants
to know" (here he paused to throw a
dark hidden meaning into the word)
“what time—it—is.”
“What time it is 2'"
“Yes, what time it is ' It. Yes,
what time it is"—repeated fortissimo
ad lib.
“Eleven thirty-five.”
“Eleven thirty-five 2 Why, it's on
now. I don't hear anything on the
Front ?”
“No, you wouldn't.”
“Why not 2"
“Because it's all quiet.”
“But you said s something was on 2."
“No, I didn't. You asked me what
time it was and I told you.”
Swallowing hard several times, Pos-
sum girded up his loins, so to speak,
gripped the telephone firmly in the
right hand this time, and jumped off
again. His “Hullo" sent a thrill
through even the Bosch listening ap-
paratus in the next sector.
“ Hullo ! L-look here, Pike, we —
want–to–Rnow—what time it is.”
“Eleven thir - ?
“No, no, it—it !”
“What 2 ''
“It You know what I mean. Damit,
what can I call it? Oh–er, sports;
what time is your high jump 2" he
added, nodding and winking know-
ingly. “Well, what time's the circus 2
When do you start for Berlin 2"
“I say, Possum, are you all right,
old chap 2" said a voice full of concern.
A crop of full-bodied beads appeared
on the Brigade Major's brow. His
right hand was paralysed by the un-
ceasing grip of the receiver. There
was a strained look in his eyes as of a
man watching for the ration-party.
“S-something,” he said, calmly and
surely mastering his fate—“s-some-
thing is happening to-night.”
“You’re a cheery sort of bloke,
aren't you?”
“Good God, are you cracked or what?
There's a x -
“Careful, careful!" called the General
from his comfortable chair in the other
room.
“O-ohl” sang the mosquito voice,
“now I know what you mean. You
want to know what time our—er—ha!
ha! you know—the-er—don't you?”
“The—ha! haſ yes”—they leered
frightfully at each other; it was a
horrible spectacle. No one would think
that Possum had so much latent evil
in him.
“We sent you the time mid-day.”
“Well, we haven't had it. C-can
you give me any indication, w-without
actually s-saying it, you know?"
“Well now,” said the mosquito,
“You know how many years' service
I've got? Multiply by two and add
the map square of this headquarters.”
“Well, look here,” it sang again,
“you remember the number of the
billet where I had dinner with you
three weeks ago? Well, halve that
and add two."
“Half nine and add two " (aside:
“These midnight mathematics will be
the death of me—ah! that's between
six and seven 2"). Aloud: “But that's
daylight.”
“No, it isn't. Which dinner are you
thinking of 2"
With the sweat pouring down his
face, both hands now clasping the
telephone—his right being completely
numbed—he called upon the gods to
witness the foolishness of mortals.
Suddenly a hideous cackle of mosquito-
laughter filtered through and, by some
diabolical contrivance of the signals,
the tiny voice swelled into a bellow
close to his ear.
“If you really want to know, old
Possum,” it said, “the said took place
two hours ago!”
“I hope,” said Possum, much re-
lieved, but speaking with concentrated
venom, “I h-hope you may be strafed
with boiling Are you there 2"
Being assured that he was he slapped
his receiver twice, and, much gratified
at the unprintable expression of the
twice-stunned-one at the other end,
went to tell the General—who, he
found, had gone to bed and was fast
asleep.
“The customary oats were administered to
the new Judge.”—Perthshire Constitutional.
There had been some fear, we under-
stand, that owing to the food shortage
he would have to be content with
thistles.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OLD FORMUL.A.
Private Brown lay upon his pillows
thoughtfully sucking the new pencil
given him by his mate in the next bed.
Propped against the cradle that covered
his shattered knee was a pad, to which
a sheet of paper had been fixed, and he
was about to write a letter to his wife.
It was plainly to be an effort, for
apart from the fact that he was never
a scholar there was the added uncer-
tainty of his long disused right hand
to be reckoned with ; but at last he
grasped the pencil with all the firm-
ness he could muster and began:—
“DEAR WIFE,--I got your letter
about Jim he ought to gone long ago,
shirking I calls it. This hospital is
very nice and when you come down
from London youll see all the flowers
and the gramophone which is a fair
treat. My wounds is slow and I often
gets cramp.”
No sooner was the fatal word written
than the fingers of his right hand began
to stiffen, the pencil fell upon the bed,
then rolled dejectedly to the floor, where
the writer said it might stay for all he
cared.
“You must let me finish the letter,”
said I, when his hand had been rubbed
and tucked away in a warm mitten.
“Thank you, Miss; I was getting on
nicely, and there's not much more to
say,” he returned ruefully, scanning the
wavering lines before him.
“Well, shall I go on for a bit and
let you wind up,” said I, unscrewing
my pen and taking the pad on my
knee.
“Me telling you what to put like?”
he asked with a look of pleased relief.
“That's it. Just say what you would
write down yourself.”
He cleared his throat.
“DEAR WIFE,” he resumed, “the
wounds is... awful, not letting me write
at all. The one in my back is as long
as your arm, and they says it will heal
quicker than the one in my knee, which
has two tubes in which they squirts
strong-smelling stuff through. The
foot is a pretty sight, as big as half a
melon, and I doubts ever being able to
put it to the ground again, though they
says I shall. I gets very stiff at nights
and the pain sometimes is cruel, but
they gives me a prick with the morphia
needle then which makes me dream
something beautiful. . . .”
There was a pause while he indulged
in a smiling reverie.
“Perhaps we have said enough about
your pains,' I ventured, when, return-
ing from his visions, he puckered his
brows in fresh thought. “Your wif
might be frightened if—” -

“She's a rare good nurse herself, and
it would take more than that to turn
her up.”
I shook my pen; he shifted his head
a little and continued:—
“DEAR WIFE,-If you could see my
shoulder dressed of a morning you
would laugh. They cuts out little
pieces of lint like a picture puzzle to
fit the places, and I've got a regular
map of Blighty all down my arm; but
that's not so bad as my back, which I
cannot see and which the wound is as

I blotted the sheet and turned over,
and Private Brown eyed the space left
for further cheerful communications.
“Shall I leave this for you to finish 2"
I suggested, thinking of tender mes-
sages difficult to dictate. “Your fingers

“That's all right, Miss. There's

me at present.”

“WELL, UPON MY word l AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE I HAD TO GET A QUARTER OF A POUND of BUTTER, THE Cook's SENT UP
MARGARINE. I SHOULD HATE THE MAIDS TO GO SHORT, BUT I Do THINK WE OUGHT TO SHARE THINGs." - -
:- THE ULTIMATE OUTRAGE.
I HAD a favourite shirt for many moons,
Soft, silken, soothing and of tenderest tone,
Gossamer-light withal. The Subs., my peers,
Envied the garment, ransacking the land
To find a shirt its equal—all in vain.
For, when we tired of shooting at the Hun
And other Batteries clamoured for their share
And we resigned positions at the front
To dally for a space behind the line,
To shed my war-worn vesture I was wont—
The G.S. boots, the puttees and the pants
That mock at cut and mar the neatest leg,
The battle-jacket with its elbows patched
And bands of leather round its hard-used cuffs, .
And, worst of all, the fuggy flannel shirt,
Rough and uncouth, that suffocates the soul;
And in their stead I donned habiliments
Cadets might dream of—serges with a waist,
And breeches cut by Blank (you know the man,
Or dare not say you don't), long lustrous boots,
And gloves canary-hued, bright primrose ties
Undimmed by shadows of Sir FRANCIs LLoyd–
And, like a happy mood, I wore the shirt.
It was a woven breeze, a melody -
Constrained by seams from melting in the air,
A summer perfume tethered to a stud,
The cool of evening cut to fit my form—
And I shall wear it now no more, no more
There came a day we took it to be washed,
I and my batman, after due debate.
A little cottage stood hard by the road
Whose one small window said, in manuscript,
“Wasching for soldiers and for officers,”
And there we left my shirt with anxious fears
And fond injunctions to the Belgian dame.
So it was washed. I marked it as I passed
Waving svelte arms beneath the kindly sun
As if it semaphored to its own shade
That answered from the grass. I saw it fill
And plunge against its bonds—methought it yearned
To join its tameless kin, the airy clouds.
And as I saw it so, I sang aloud,
“To-morrow I shall wear thee! Haste, O Time !”
Fond, futile dreaml That very afternoon,
Her washing taken in and folded up
(My shirt, my shirt I mourn for, with the rest),
The frugal creature locked and left her cot
To cut a cabbage from a neighbour's field.
Then, without warning, from the empurpled sky,
Swift with grim dreadful purpose, swooped a shell
(Perishing Percy was the name he bore
Amongst the irreverent soldiery), ah me !
And where the cottage stood there gaped a gulf ;
The jewel and the casket vanished both.
Were there no other humble homes but that
For the vile Hun to fire at 2 Did some spy,
In bitter jealousy, betray my shirt 2.
What boots it to lament 2 The shirt is gone.
It was not meant for such an one as I,
A plain rough gunner with one only pip.
No doubt 'twas destined for some lofty soul
Who in a deck-chair lolls, and marks the map
And says, “Push here,” while I and all my kind
Scrabble and slaughter in the appointed slough.
But I, presumptuous, wore it, till the gods
Called for my laundry with a thunderbolt.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, October 22nd.--The fact
that a couple of German raiders con-
trived to slip through the North Sea
patrol the other night was made the ex-
cuse for an attack upon the Admiralty.
Sir ERIC GEDDEs came down specially
to assure the House that if it viewed
things “in the right perspective" it
would realise that such isolated incidents
were unavoidable. Members gener-
ally were convinced, I
newspapers. In one of them he appears
to have stated that Mr. Asquith's con-
dition of health was so precarious that
there was little likelihood of his resum-
ing an active part in politics. It was
pleasant, therefore, to see the ex-Premier
in his place again, and able to contribute
to the Irish debate a speech showing no
conspicuous failure either of intellect or
verbal felicity.
Both Mr. REDMOND and Mr. DUKE
had drawn a very gloomy picture of
Meanwhile the Sinn Feiners have
refused to take part in it. And not a
single Nationalist Member dared to
denounce them to-night. Mr. T. M.
HEALY even gave them his blessing, for
whatever that may be worth. -
Wednesday, October 24th. — The
strange case of Mrs. BESANT and Mr.
MoNTAGU was brought before the Upper
House by Lord SYDENHAM, who hoped
the Government were not going to make
concessions to the noisy people who
wanted to set up a
think, by the sight
of the FIRST LORD's
bulldog jaw, even
| more than by his
words, that the Navy
would not loose its
grip on the enemy's
throat.

we have been told, the

SECRETARY's explana-
tion did not, of course,
satisfy “P. B.”—ini-

raucosity, caused by
his al-fresco oratory
in East Islington, de-
manded that protec-
tion should be afforded

he and Mr. JoyNsoN-
Hicksand Mr. DILLON
| —whose sudden soli-
citude for the inhabi-
tants of London was
gently chaffed by Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN — were
deservedly trounced
by Mr. BonAR LAw,
who declared that if
their craven squeal-
ings were typical he should despair of
victory.
Who says that the removal of the
grille has had no effect upon politics?
Exposed to the unimpeded gaze of the
ladies in the Gallery the House decided
with great promptitude that the female
voter should not be called upon to state
her exact age, but need only furnish a
statutory declaration that she was over
thirty.
Tuesday, October 23rd.—So far as I
know, the duties of a Junior Lord of the
Treasury have never been exactly de-
fined. Apparently those of Mr. PRATT
include the compilation of a “London
Letter," to be sent to certain favoured

present-day Ireland— the former, of
course, attributing it entirely to the
ineptitudes of the “Castle,” and being
careful to say little or nothing to hurt
the feelings of the Sinn Feiners, while
the latter ascribed it to the rebellious
speeches and actions of Mr. DE WALERA
and the other hillside orators whom for
some inscrutable reason he leaves at
large.
I hope Mr. Asquith was justified in
assuming that the Sinn Fein excesses
were only an expression of the “rhe-
torical and contingent belligerency"
always present in Ireland, and that
in spite of them the Convention would
make all things right.

of Lord IsIINGTON and
Lord CURzoN did not
entirely remove the
impression that the
Government are a
little afraid of Mrs.
BESANT and her power
of “creating an atmo-
sphere” by the emis-
sion of “hot air.” Ap-
parently there is room
for only one orator in
India at a time, for it
was expressly stated
that Mr. MonTAGU,
who got back into
office shortly after the
delivery of what Lord
LANSDown E charac-
terised as an “intem-
perate ’’ speech on
| Indian affairs, has
N given an undertaking
not to make any
speech at all during
his progress through
the Peninsula.

ºf 25th.-Irish Members
have first cut at the
Question-time cake on
Thursdays, and em-
ploy their opportunity
to advertise their nat-
ional grievances. Mr.
O'LEARY, for example,
drew a moving pic-
ture of a poor old man occupying a
single room, and dependent for his
subsistence on the grazing of a hypo-
thetical cow; he had been refused
a pension by a hard-hearted Board.
Translated into prosaic English by the
CHIEF SECRETARY it resolved itself into
the case of a farmer who had deliber-
ately divested himself of his property
in the hope of “wangling” five shillings
a week out of the Treasury.
According to Mr. BYRNE the Lord
Mayor of DUBLIN has been grossly in-
sulted by a high Irish official, who
must be made to apologise or resign.
Again Mr. DUKE was unreceptive. He
had seen the LoRD MAYoR, who dis-

THE MUD LARKS.
Albert Edward and I are on detach-
ment just now. I can't mention what
job we are on because HINDENBURG is
listening. He watches every move
made by Albert Edward and me and
disposes his forces accordingly. Now
and again he forestalls us, now and
again he don't. On the former occa-
sions he rings up LUDENDoRFF, and
they make a night of it with beer and
song; on the latter he pushes the bell
violently for the old German god.
The spot Albert Edward and I in-
habit just now is very interesting;
things happen all round us. There is
a tame balloon tied by a string to the
back garden, an ammunition column
on either flank and an infantry battalion
camped in front. Aeroplanes buzz over-
head in flocks and there is a regular
tank service past the door. One way
and another our present location fairly
teems with life; Albert Edward says it
reminds him of London. To heighten
the similarity we get bombed every
night.
Promptly after Mess the song of the
bomb-bird is heard. The searchlights
stab and slash about the sky like tin
swords in a stage duel; presently they
pick up the bomb-bird—a glittering
flake of tinsel—and the racket begins.
Archibalds pop, machine guns chatter,
rifles crack, and here and there some
optimistic sportsman browns the Milky
Way with a revolver. As Sir I. NEw-
ToN's law of gravity is still in force
and all that goes up must come down
again, it is advisable to wear a parasol
on one's walks abroad.
In view of the heavy lead-fall Albert
Edward and I decided to have a dug-
out. We dug down six inches and
struck water in massed formation. I
poked a finger into the water and licked
it. “Tastes odd,” said I, “brackish or
salt or something.”
“We've uncorked the blooming At-
lantic, that's what,” said Albert Ed-
ward; “cork it up again quickly or it'll
bob up and swamp us.” That done,
we looked about for something that
would stand digging into. The only
thing we could find was a molehill, so
we delved our way into that. We
are residing in it now, Albert Edward,
Maurice and I. We have called it
“Mon Repos,” and stuck up a notice
saying we are inside, otherwise visitors
would walk over it and miss us.
The chief drawback to “Mon Repos”
is Maurice. Maurice is the proprietor
by priority, a mole by nature. Our
advent has more or less driven him
into the hinterland of his home and he
is most unpleasant about it. He sits
in the basement and sulks by day,
issuing at night to scrabble about
among our boots, falling over things
and keeping us awake. If we say
“Boo! Shoo!” or any harsh word to
him he doubles up the backstairs to
the attic and kicks earth over our faces
at three-minute intervals all night.
Albert Edward says he is annoyed
about the rent, but I call that absurd.
Maurice is perfectly aware that there
is a war on, and to demand rent from ||
soldiers who are defending his mole-
hill with their lives is the most ridicu-
lous proposition I ever heard of. As I
said before, the situation is most un-
pleasant, but I don't see what we can
do about it, for digging out Maurice
means digging down “Mon Repos,”

and there's no sense in that. Albert
Edward had a theory that the mole is
a carnivorous animal, so he smeared a
worm with carbolic tooth-paste and
left it lying about. It lay about for
days. Albert now admits his theory
was wrong; the mole is a vegetarian,
he says; he was confusing it with
trout. He is in the throes of inventing
an explosive potato for Maurice on the
lines of a percussion grenade, but in
the meanwhile that gentleman remains
in complete mastery of the situation.
The balloon attached to our back
garden is very tame. Every morning
its keepers lead it forth from its abode
by strings, tie it to a longer string and
let it go. All day it remains aloft,
tugging gently at its leash and keeping
an eye on the War. In the evening
the keepers appear once more, haul it
down and lead it home for the night.
It reminds me for all the world of a
huge docile elephant being bossed about
by the mahout's infant family. I always
feel like giving the gentle creature a
bun.
Now and again the Bosch birds
come over disguised as clouds and spit
mouthfuls of red-hot tracer-bullets at
it, and then the observers hop out.
One of them “hopped out” into my
horse-lines last week. That is to say
his parachute caught in a tree and he
hung swinging, like a giant pendulum,
over my horses' backs until we lifted
him down. He came into “Mon Repos”
to have bits of tree picked out of him.
This was the sixth plunge overboard
he had done in ten days, he told us.
Sometimes he plunged into the most
embarrassing situations. On one oc-
casion he dropped clean through a
bivouac roof into a hot bath containing
a Lieutenant-Colonel, who punched
him with a sponge and threw soap at
him. On another he came fluttering
down from the blue into the midst of
a labour company of Chinese coolies,
who immediately fell on their faces,
worshipping him as some heavenly
being, and later cut off all his buttons
as holy relics. An eventful life.

THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.
III.
CoNversation on CHAPTER LXX.
Mary. Do tell us something more,
Mamma, about the Great Rebellion
and how it began.
Mrs. M. Well, my dear, you must
know that in the previous reign it had
been the fashion for middle-aged and
elderly people to behave and dress as if
they were still juvenile. Mothers neg-
lected their daughters and went to balls
and theatres every night, where they
were conspicuous for their extravagant
attire and strange conversation. They
would not allow their daughters to
smoke, or, if they did, provided them
with the cheapest cigarettes. Fathers
of even advanced years wore knicker-
bocker suits on all occasions and spent
most of their time playing a game
called golf. This at last provoked a
violent reaction, and the Great Rebel-
lion was the consequence. Although
there was no bloodshed many distress-
ing scenes were enacted and something
like a Reign of Terror prevailed for
several years.
Ičichard. Oh, Mamma, please go on 1
Mrs. M. Parents trembled at the
sight of their children, and fathers,
even when they were sixty years old,
stood bareheaded before their sons and
did not dare to speak without permis-
sion. Mothers never sat down in the
presence of their grown-up daughters,
but stood in respectful silence at the
further end of the room, and were only
allowed to smoke in the kitchen.
George. That cannot have been very
good for the cooking.
Mrs. M. The daughters of the family
were seldom educated at home, and
when they returned to their father's
roof their parents were only admitted
into the presence of their children
during short and stated periods.
Mary. And when did the English
begin to grow kinder to their parents?
Mrs. M. I really cannot say. Per-
haps a climax was reached in the Baby
Suffrage Act; but after that matters
began to improve, and the Married
Persons Amusements Act showed a
more tolerant spirit towards the elderly.
But even so lately as when my mother
was a child young people were often
exceedingly harsh with their parents,
and she has told me how on one occasion
she locked up her mother for several
hours in the coal-cellar for playing a
mouth-organ in the bathroom without
permission.
Itichard. Pray, Mamma, did the
English speak Irish then, as they do
now 2
Mrs. M. Compulsory Irish was intro-
duced under ALFRED as a concession
to Ireland for the services rendered by
that kingdom to art and literature and
the neutrality which it observed during
England's wars. There was a certain
amount of opposition, but it was soon
overcome by ALFRED's wisely insisting
on the newspapers being printed in
both languages. Since then the varia-
tions in dialect and pronunciation which
prevailed in different districts of Eng-
land have largely disappeared, and from
Land's End to John o' Groat's the
bilingual system is now securely estab-
lished, though my mother told me that
as a child she once met an old man in
Northumberland who could only speak
a few words of Irish, and had been
deprived of his vote in consequence.
Ičichard. What were the Thirty-Nine
Articles 2 I don't think I ever heard
of them before.
Mrs. M. When you are of a proper
age to understand them they shall be
explained to you. They contained the
doctrines of the Church of England, but
were abolished by Archbishop WELLs,
who substituted seventy-eight of his
own. But as Mary is looking tired I
will now conclude our conversation.
THE MOTH PERIL.
[“Fruit growers are warned to be on their
guard against the wingless moth, for lime-
washing the trees is almost useless.”
- * Evening Paper.]
If the brute ignores the notice, “Reep
off the trees,” order him away in a sharp
voice.
Sulphuric acid is a most deadly anti-
dote; but only the best should be used.
If the moth be held over the bottle for
ten minutes it will show signs of col-
lapse and offer to go quietly.
This pest abhors heat. A good plan
is to heat the garden - roller in the
kitchen fire to a white heat and push
it up the tree.
A gramophone in full song is also
useful. After a few minutes the moth
will come out of its dug-out with an
abstracted expression on its face, and
commit suicide by jumping into the
mouth of the trumpet.
A Comforting Thought for use on
War-Time Railways.
“To travel hopefully is a better thing than
to arrive.”—R. L. STEVENSox.
From a parish magazine:—
“I know ‘the war' still continues but
these do not explain everything. The large
water tank at the schools is for sale—price
£5 10s. The sermons and as far as possible
the music and hymns on 21st (Trafalgar Day)
will bear on the work of our incomparable
Navy.” -
It is believed in the village that the
parson is suffering from a rush of
Jumble Sales to the head.
HERBS OF GRACE.
Sweet WooDRUFF.

NoT for the world that we know,
But the lovelier world that we dream
of
Dost thou, Sweet Woodruff, grow;
Not of this world is the theme of
The scent diffused
From thy bright leaves bruised;
Not in this world hast thou part or lot,
Save to tell of the dream one, forgot,
forgot.
Sweet Woodruff, thine is the scent
Of a world that was wise and lowly,
Singing with sane content,
Simple and clean and holy,
Merry and kind
As an April wind,
Happier far for the dawn's good gold
Than the chinking chaffer-stuff hard
and cold.
Thine is the odour of praise
In the loved little country churches;
Thine are the ancient ways
Which the new Gold Age besmirches;
Cordials, wine
And posies are thine,
The adze-cut beams with thy bunches
fraught,
And the kist-laid linen by maidens
- wrought.
Clean bodies, kind hearts, sweet
souls,
Delight and delighted endeavour,
A spirit that chants and trolls,
A world that doth ne'er dissever
The body's hire
And the heart's desire;
Ah, bright leaves bruised and brown
leaves dry,
Odours that bid this world go by.

THE numerous members of the public who, like to take

by their tried and trusted friend, TAFFRAIL, the creator
of Pincher Martin, O.D. TAFFRAIL, it must be admitted,
as a dashing briny way with him. He doesn't wait to
describe sunsets and storm-clouds, but plunges at once into
the thick of things. Consequently his stories go with a
swing and a rush, for which the reader is duly grateful—
that is, if he is a discerning reader. Of the present collec-
tion most were written some time ago and have no reference
to the War. Such, for instance, is “The Escape of the
Speedwell,” a cap.tal story of the year 1805, which may
serve to remind us that even in the glorious days of NELSoN
he English Channel was not always a healthy place for
British shipping. “The Channel,” says TAFFRAIL, “swarmed
with the enemy's privateers. . . . Even the merchant-ships
in the home-coming convoys, protected though they were
by men-of-war were not safe from capture, while the hostile
uggers would often approach the English coast in broad
laylight and harry the hapless fishing craft within a mile
or two of the shore.” Yet there does not appear to have
been a panic, nor was anyone's blood demanded. Autres

does it with equal zest. “The Inner Patrol” and “The Luck
of the Tavy” more than redress the balance to the side of
virtue and sound warfare. Both stories are excellent.
Among the minor results following the entry of America
into the War has been the release from bondage of several
diplomatic pens, whose owners would, under less happy
circumstances, have been prevented from telling the world
many stories of great interest. Here, for example, is the late
Special Agent and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United
States, Mr. LEwis EINSTEIN, writing of his experiences
Inside Constantinople, April-September, 1915 (MURRAY).
This is a diary kept by the Minister during the period
covered by the Dardanelles Expedition. As such you will
hardly expect it to be agreeable reading, but its tragic
interest is undeniable. Mr. EINSTEIN, as a sympathetic
neutral, saw everything, and his comments are entirely out-
spoken. We know the Dardanelles story well enough by
now from our own side; here for the first time one may
see in full detail just how near it came to victory. It is a
history of chances neglected, of adverse fate and heroism
frustrated, such as no Englishman can read unmoved. But
the book has also a further value in the light it throws
upon the Armenian massacres and the complicity of
Germany therein. “Though in later years German official-
dom may seek to disclaim responsibility, the broad fact
remains of German military direction at Constantinople . . .

one more stain upon a dishonoured shield, not to be for-
gotten in the final reckoning.
I never met a story more aptly named than Mrs. BELLoc-
LowNDEs’ Love and Hatred (CHAPMAN AND HALL). Oliver
Tropenell worshipped Laura Pavely, who returned this
attachment, despite the fact. that she was already married
to Godfrey. Godfrey, for his part, loved Katty Winslow,
a young widow, who flirted equally with him, with Oliver,
and with Laura's undesirable brother, Gilbert. So much
for the tender passion. As for the other emotion, Oliver
naturally hated Godfrey; so did Gilbert. Laura also
came to share their sentiment. By the time things had
reached this climax the moment was obviously ripe for the
disappearance of the much detested one, in order that the rest
of the tale might keep you guessing which of the three had
a son of the people whose qualifications for the post of
villain were none too convincing, and there all manner
of unpleasant things were by way of happening to them,
when enter the despairing husband with the dashing
scarlet one at his side—et voilà tout. The last few chapters
come nearly or even quite up to the mark, but as for most
of the rest, I advise you to take them as read.
In A Certain Star (HopDER AND SToUGHToN) Miss PHYLLIs
Bottom E achieves the difficult feat of treating a love con-
ceived in a romantic vein without declining upon sentiment-
ality, and seasons her descriptions, which are shrewdly,
sometimes delicately, observed, with quite a pretty wit. I
commend it as a sound, unpretentious, honestly-written
book. , Sir Julian Verny, a baronet with brains and a very
difficult temper, falls a captive to Marian's proud and com-
(so to speak) belled the cat.
Followers of Mrs. LowNDEs
will indeed have been anti-
cipating poor Godfrey's de-
mise for some time, and
may perhaps think that she
takes a trifle too long over
her arrangements for the
event. They will almost
certainly share my view
that the explanation of the
mystery is far too involved
and unintelligible. I shall,
of course, not anticipate
this for you." It has been
said that the works of
HoMER were not written
by HoMER himself, but by
another man of the same
name. This may, or may
not, give you a clue to the
murder of Godfrey Pavely.
I wish the crime were more
worthy of such an artist in
creeps as Mrs. LowNDEs has
proved herself to be.

ably crippled. Marian fails
him. True, she disdains to
be released, but out of pride
not out of love. It is little
grey suppressed Stella (her
light has been hidden under
the dull bushel of a Town
Clerk's office) who comes
into her kingdom and wins
back an ultra-sensitive des-
pairing man to the joy of
living and working and the
fine humility of being de-
pendent instead of master-
ful. There are so many
Julians and there's need
of so many Stellas these
sad days that it is well to
have such wholesome doc-
trine stated with so cour-
ageous an optimism.
There is a sentence on
page 149 of A Castle to Let
(CAssELL) which, though
not for its style, I feel con-
strained to quote: “It
must go to the right market.
Baroness ORCzY has not feared to put her most famous
product, The Scarlet Pimpernel, to a similar trial.
Whether the result of this renewed dilution is entirely
satisfactory I leave you to judge, but certainly at least
something of the well-known and popular aroma of
romantic artificiality clings about the pages of her latest
story, Lord Tony's Wife (Hodder AND Stoughton), while
at the bottom of the cup there is not a little dash of the
old strong flavour. On the other hand, though it may be
that one's appetite grows less lusty, it does seem that in
all the earlier chapters there is some undue proportion of
thin and rather tepid preparation for episodes quite clearly
on the way, so that in the end even the masterly vigour of
the much advertised Pimpermel, in full panoply of inane
laughter and unguessed disguise, failed to astound and
stagger me as much as I could have wished. Lord Tony
was a healthy young Englishman with no particular qualities
calling for comment, and his wife an equally charming young
French heroine. After having escaped to England from
the writer's beloved Reign of Terror, the lady and her
aristo father were comfortably decoyed back to France by
was a glorious day, the sunshine poured through, the
green boughs, and the moss made cradles, in which
most people went to sleep with their novels.” Well,
given a warm day and a comfortable resting-place,
this book by Mrs. BAILLIE REYNoLDs would do excel-
lently well either to sleep or keep awake with, according
to your mood. The scene of it is laid in Transylvania,
where a rich young Englishwoman took an old castle for
the summer. Incidentally I have learned something about
the inhabitants of Transylvania, but apart from that I
know now exactly what a novel for the holidays should
contain. Its ingredients are many and rather wonderful,
but Mrs. REYNoLDs is a deſt mixer, and her skill in
managing no fewer than three love-affairs without getting
them and you into a tangle is little short of miraculous.
Then we are given plenty of legends, mysteries and dreams,
just intriguing enough to produce an eerie atmosphere,
but not sufficiently exciting to cause palpitations of the
heart. Need I add that the tenant of the castle married
the owner of it? As she was both human and sporting,
it worries me to think that she may now be interned.

THE GREAT MAN.
WHAT am I doing, Dickie 2 Well, I'll tell you. I'm
one of those subalterns you hear of sometimes. You know
the kind of things they do? They look after their men and
ask themselves every day in the line (as per printed in-
structions), “Am I offensive enough 2" In trenches they
are ever to the fore, bombing, patrolling, raiding, wiring
and inspecting gas helmets. Working-parties under heavy
fire are as meat and drink, rum and biscuits to them.
Once every nine months, and when all Staff officers have
had three goes, they get leave in order to give excuse for
the appointment of A.P.M.'s. There are thousands of us,
and we are supposed to run the War. These are the things
which I am sure (if you get newspapers in Ceylon) jump
into your mind the moment I mention the word subaltern,
and I may as well tell you that in associating me with any
one of these deeds at the present time you are entirely
wrong.
I sit in a room, an office papered with maps in all degrees
of nakedness, from the newest and purest to those woad-
stained veterans called objective maps. In this room,
where regimental officers tread lightly, speak softly and
creep away, awed and impotent—HE sits. “HE” is a
G.S.O.3, or General Staff Officer, third grade. He it is
who looks after the welfare of some hundred thousand
troops (when everybody else is out). I am attached to him
—not personally, be it understood, but officially. I am
|example of our co-operation.
—oh no, it's the other lot; no, that is right—I don't think
there to learn how he does it (whatever it is). High hopes,
never realised, are held out to me that if I am good and
look after the office during mealtimes I shall have a job of
my very own one day—possibly two days.
And he is very good to me. He rarely addresses me
directly, except when short of matches, but he often gives
me an insight into things by talking to himself aloud. He
does this partly to teach me the reasoning processes by
which he arrives at the momentous decisions expected of a
G.S.O.3, and partly because he values my intelligent con-
sideration.
This morning, for instance, furnished a typically brilliant
“I wonder,” he said (and
as he spoke I broke off from my daily duties of writing to
Her)—"I wonder what about these Flares? Division say
they want two thousand red and white changing to green
they can want two thousand possibly. We might give them
half for practice purposes, or say five hundred. Still, if
they say they want two thousand I suppose they do; but
then there's the question of what we've got in hand. All
right, let them have them.” - * .
That was one of the questions I helped to settle.
“Heavens!” he went on, “five hundred men for digging
cable trenches! No, no, I don't think. They had five
hundred only the other night—no, they didn't ; it was the
other fellows—no, that was the night before—no, I was
right as usual. One has so many things to think of.
Well, they can't have them, that's certain; it can't be
important—yes, it is, though, if things were to—yes, yes–
we'll let them have them.”
You will note that he said “we.” Co-operation again.
I assure you I glowed with pleasure to think I had been
of so much assistance.
I had hardly got back to my letter when we started
off again.
“Well that's my morning's work done—no, it isn't—
yes, no, by Jove, there's a code word for No. 237 Filtra-
tion Unit to be thought out. No, I shan't, they really
can't want one, they're too far back—still they might
come up to filter something near enough to want one—no
I won't, it's sheer waste—still, I suppose one ought to
be prepared—oh, yes, give them one—give them, the
word ‘strafe'; nobody's got that. Bong ! That's all for
to-day.”
And now you know what part I play in the Great War,
Dickie. Yours, JACK.
P.S.—Just off for my morning's exercise—sharpening the
Corps Commander's pencils.
A “PUNCH* COT.
SoME time ago Mr. Punch made an appeal on behalf of
the East London Hospital for Children at Shadwell. He
has now received a letter from the Chairman, which says:
“By a unanimous resolution the Board of Management
have desired me to send you an expression of their most
grateful thanks for your help, which, it is no exaggeration
to say, has saved the Hospital from disaster.” . He adds
that the Board “would like to give a more practical proof
of their gratitude,” and proposes, as “an abiding memorial,"
to set aside a Cot in the Hospital, to be called “The Punch
Cot.” -
It gives Mr. Punch a very sincere pleasure to convey to
those who so generously responded to his appeal this expres-
sion of the Board's gratitude, and he begs them also to
accept his own.
The sum so far contributed by Mr. Punch and his friends
amounts to £3,505.

THE RECORDER.
[At the concluding session of the Museums
Association Conference in Sheffield, Councillor
Nuttall, of Southport, said it was desirable
that every town should make a voice record
of every soldier who returned home from the
wars, describing his experience in fighting.
It would be a valuable record for future
generations of the family to know what their
ancestor did in the Great War.]
IN an Expeditionary Force whose
vocabulary included several lurid words
there was a certain Battalion renowned
for the vigour of its language. And in
that Battalion Private Thompson held
a reputation which was the envy of all.
Not only had he a more varied stock
of expletives than anyone else, but he
seemed to possess a unique gift for
welding them into new and wonderful
combinations to meet each fresh situa-
tion. Moreover he had
an insistent manner of
delivering them which
alone was sufficient to
place him in a class by
himself. It was not long
before many of his friends
gave up trying altogether
and let Private Thomp-
son do it all for them. º,
is even rumoured that on
occasions men in distant
parts of the line would
send for him so that he
might come and give
adequate expression toº

to be beyond their range.

necessary to mention that
Lieutenant composed an ode all
about Private Thompson and got it
published in Camouflage, the trench
gazette of the Nth Division. Two of
the verses went, as far as I can re-
member, something like this:—
As Private Thompson used to say,
He couldn't stand the War;
He cursed about it every day
And every night he swore;
And, while a sense of discipline
Carried him on through thick and thin,
The mud, the shells, the cold, the din
Annoyed him more and more.
The words with which we others cursed
Seemed mild and harmless quips
Compared to those remarks that burst
From Private Thompson's lips;
Haven't you ever heard about
The Prussian Guard at X Redoubt,
How Thompson's language laid them out
Before we came to grips ?
Anyhow, after bespattering the air
of France and Flanders with a barrage
of anathemas for the best part of a year,
Private Thompson did something credit-
able in one of the pushes, and retired
to a hospital in England, whence he
mittee when they tactfully withdrew,
leaving him alone with the instrument.
For a few seconds he was silent.
The machine rasped unchallenged
through a dozen revolutions. Then he
took a deep breath and, leaning for-
ward, thrust his head into the yawning
mouth of the trumpet.

assuring his audience that it gave him
great pleasure, indeed he might go so
far as to say the very greatest pleasure,
to welcome on behalf of their town one
who had upheld with such distinction
and bravery the reputation and honour
of the community. And that, although
he did not wish to keep them any longer,
yet he must just add that he was going
to ask Mr. Thompson then and there,
while the remembrance of his terrible
|hardships was still fresh in his mind,
to impart them to a phonograph, so
that the archives of the town might
not lack direct evidence of the experi-
ences, if he might so express it, of her
bravest citizen, and future generations
might know something of the noble
thoughts that surged in so gallant a
breast in times of danger, and the fine
and honourable words with which those
thoughts had been uttered.
The Mayor's peroration annoyed
Thompson; the cheers that followed it
annoyed him still more, and the subse-
quent shower of congratulations and
vigorous slaps on the back threatened
Commercial Candour.

A DEAL WITH CHINA.
Fritz having killed the mule, it de-
volved upon the village Sanitary In-
spector to see the carcass decently
interred, and on application to the C.O.
of the nearest Chinese labour camp I
presently secured the services of two
beautiful old ivory carvings and a
bronze statue, clad in blue quilted uni-
forms and wearing respectively, by way
of head-dress, a towel turban, a straw
hat and a coiffure like an early-Vic-
torian penwiper. It was the bronze
gentleman—the owner of the noticeable
coiffure—who at once really took charge
of the working party.
He introduced himself to me as
“Lurtee Lee’’ (his official number was
thirty-three), informed me he could
“speakel Engliss,” and, having by this
single utterance at once apparently
proved his statement and exhausted his
vocabulary, settled down into a rapt
and silent adoration of my tunic buttons.
Before we had proceeded thirty yards
he had offered me five franes (which he
produced from the small of his back)
for a single button. At the end of one
hundred yards the price had risen to
seven twenty-five, and arrived upon
the scene of action the Celestial grave-
digger made a further bid of eight
francs, two Chinese eoins (value un-
known) and a tract in his native tongue.
This being likewise met with a reluct-
ant but unmistakable refusal, the work
of excavation was commenced.
Now when three men are employed
upon a pit some six feet square they
obviously cannot all work at the same
time in so confined a space. One man
must in turn stand out and rest. His
rest time may be spent in divers ways.
The elder of the two ivory carvings
spent his breathing spells in philosophic
reverie ; the younger employed his
leisure in rummaging on the neighbour-
ing “dump” for empty tobacco tins,
which he concealed about his person by
a succession of feats of legerdemain (by
the end of the morning I estimated
him to be in possession of about thirty
specimens). Lurtee Lee filled every
moment of his off time in the manu-
facture of a quite beautiful pencil-
holder—his material an empty cartridge
case, his tools a half-brick and a shoe-
ing nail.
Slowly the morning wore on—so
slowly, indeed, that at an early period
I cast aside my tunic and with spade
and pick endeavoured by assistance
and example to incite my labourers to
“put a jerk in it.” Noon saw the de-
ceased mule beneath a ton or so of clay,
and Lurtee Lee, whether from grati-
tude or sheer camaraderie, gravely pre-
sented me with the now completed
Jock. “MAN, IT'S AN AWFU' PUIR DAY FOR FECHTIN’.’”
Donal'. “AY. BUT IT'S AN Awfu' GUID DAY Fort GETTIN' THE FU' wartºuxfth AN'

Another Impending Apology.
“Early in the operations a jet of water
struck the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade
directly in the right eye, completely blinding
him for the time; and he had to be assisted
away but returned shortly after. The Brigade
are to be complimented on their work.”

pencil-holder. No, not a sou would he
accept; I was to take it as a gift.
At this moment a European N.C.O.
from the Labour Camp came upon the
scene and kindly offered to save me a
journey by escorting Lurtee Lee and
Company to quarters. They shuffled
down the road, and I turned to put on
my tunic. One button was missing.

ESSENCE OF. PARLIAMENT.
Monday, October 29th. –– For once
Parliament repelled the gibe of its
critics that it has ceased to represent
the people. Lords and Commons united
in praise of our sailors and soldiers and
all the other gallant folk who are help-
ing us to win the War, and passed the
formal Votes of Thanks without a dis-
sentient voice.
As no eloquence could be adequate
to such a theme—not even that of
PERICLEs or LINcolN, as Mr. Asquith
tactfully remarked—fewer and briefer
of their friends' correspondence opened
and read. In ordinary times Members
are very jealous, and rightly so, of
this official espionage. The case
of Sir JAMES GRAHAM and MAzzINI's
letters was raked up and quoted for all
it was worth—and a little more; for, as
Sir GEORGE CAVE reminded us, even on
that occasion a Select Committee sup-
ported the action of the Government.
The fact is that, when you are fighting
for freedom en gros, individual liberties
must of necessity be curtailed. Know-
ing that our letters in war-time are

will explain the gallant Major's well-
feigned annoyance at what he called
“the assumption of military rank by

corps. Mr. MACPHERSoN supplied the
official answer, namely, that gentlemen
holding cadet-commissions are entitled
to wear service dress; but the real
object of the question was revealed
when Brother REDDY from the back-

clared in conclusion that, while sharing
the desire that Bulgaria should come
out of the War without a grievance, he
was not going to purchase that satis-

had sacrificed everything they possessed

which, in view of recent rumours, the

GILBERT shall be able to write that—
“The House of Peers, throughout the war,
Did nothing in particular,
And did it very well,”
for, thanks to the pertinacity of Lord
LoREBURN and Lord SELBoRNE, their
lordships have done something very
particular. They have proposed that
the PRIME MINISTER shall announce,
with any honour conferred, the reasons
why he has recommended it, having
previously satisfied himself that a con-
tribution to party funds was not one
of them. If Lord Loreburn had had
his way the resolution would have
been a good deal stronger, but Lord
CURzoN, upon whose majestic calm
this subject has a curiously ruffling
effect, refused to allow the retention of
words implying that any Minister had
ever been a party to a corrupt bargain.
The debate was anything but dull,
and some piquant revelations — of

Thursday, November 1st. — A full
House heard Sir ERIC GEDDEs make
his maiden speech, or rather read his
maiden essay, for he rarely deviated
from his type-script. A very good
essay it was, full of well-arranged in-
formation, and delivered in a strong
clear voice that never faltered during
an hour's recital. If we were to believe
some of the critics the British Navy is
directed by a set of doddering old gentle-
men who are afraid to let it go at the
Germans and cannot even safeguard
our commerce from attack. The truth,
as expounded by the FIRST LORD, is
quite different. Despite the jeremiads
of superannuated sailors and political
longshoremen, the Admiralty is not
going to Davy Jones's locker, but
under its present chiefs, who have,
with very few exceptions, seen service
in this War, maintains and supple-
ments its glorious record. Save for an
occasional game of “tip and run"—as
in the case of the North Sea convoy—
enemy vessels have disappeared from
the surface of the oceans; and “the

up into the skies in successful pursuit

yet what it owes to the men of the Fleet
and their comrades of the auxiliary Ser-
vices it is because their work is done
with “such thoroughness and so little
fuss,” and, as Mr. Asquith put it, “in
the twilight and not in the limelight.”

Something rich and splendid in the

“This,” I said, “is perfectly monstrous. It is an outrage.

“What have they done to you now 2" said Francesca.
“Have they forbidden you to have your boots made of
leather, or to go on wearing your shiny old blue serge suit,
or have they failed in some way to recognise your merits as
a Volunteer? Quick, tell me so that I may comfort you.”
“Listen to this,” I said.
“I should be better able to listen and you would certainly
be better able to read the letter if you didn't brandish it in
my face.” -
“When you've heard it,” I said, “you'll understand why
I brandish it. Listen:— •
“‘SIR,--I understand that on the 15th instant you travelled
from Star Bend to our London terminus without your season-
ticket, and declined to pay the ordinary fare. . One of the
conditions which you signed stipulates that in the event of
your inability to produce your season-ticket the ordinary
fare shall be paid, and as the Railway Executive now con-
trolling the railways on behalf of the Government is strict
in enforcing the observance of this condition, I have no
alternative but to request you to kindly remit me the sum
of 6s. 134, in respect of the journey in question.
I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
H. W. HuTCHINSON."
“This,” I said, as I finished reading the letter, “comes
from the Great North-Southern Railway, and is addressed
to me. What do you think of it?”
“The miserable man,” said Francesca, “ has split an in-
finitive, but he probably did it under the orders of the
Railway Executive.” . -
“I don't mind,” I said, “about his treatment of infini-
tives. He may split them all to smithereens if he likes.
It's the monstrous nature of his demand that vexes me.”
“What can you expect of a Railway Company?” said
Francesca. “Surely you didn't suppose a company would
display any of the finer feelings?” - :
“Francesca,” I said, “this is a serious matter. If you
are not going to sympathise with me, say so at once, and I
shall know what to do.” - -- -
“Well, what will you do?” - -
“I shall plough my lonely furrow—I mean, I shall write
my lonely letter all by myself, and you shan't help me to
make up any of the stingers that I'm going to put into it.”
“Oh, my dear,” she said, “what is the use of writing
stingers to a railway ? You might as well smack the
engine because the guard trod on your foot.” .
“Well, but, Francesca, I'm boiling over with indig-
nation.” -
“So am I,’” she said, “but—"
“But me no buts,” I said. “Let's boil over together
and trounce Mr. Hutchinson. Let us write a model letter
for the use of season-ticket holders who have mislaid their
tickets. We'll pack it full of sarcasm and irony. We will
make an appeal to the nobler sentiments of the Board of
Directors. . We will remind them that they too are subject
to human frailty, and r x

until we've finished our boiling-over and have simmered
down.”
. “Francesca,” I said, “am I not going to be allowed to
communicate to this so-called railway company my opinion
of its conduct? Are all the pearls of sarcasm with which
my mind is teeming to be thrown away?”
“Well," she said, “it would be useless to cast them
before the Railway Executive.”
“Mayn't I hint a hope that the penny-halfpenny will
come in useful in a time of financial stress 2"
“No,” she said decisively, “you are to do none of these
things. Of course they've behaved in a mean and shabby
way, but they've got you fixed, and the best thing you
can do is to get a postal order and send it off to Mr.
Hutchinson.” -

“No, certainly not. Write a short and formal note and
enclose the P.O.; and next time don't forget your ticket.”
“If you'll tell me how to make sure of that,” I said, “I’ll

“Does everybody,” she said, “forget his season-ticket?”
“Yes,” I said, “everybody, at least once a year.”

on the brain. -
DEAR SIR,--I used to suffer from red hair, and gradually
I am getting the stuff turned grey. By the way, can you
give me a rhyme for “Camouflage"?
DEAR SIR,--I began writing lyrics for ragtime revues,

hold of the pen and let her rip.

IT would seem that “BARTIMEUs” occupies the same rela-
tive position towards the silent Navy of 1917 that JoHN
| STRANGE WINTER did towards the Army of the pre-KIPLING
All his men are magnificent fellows, his women sym-
pathetic and courageous. The Hun, depicted as an unsports-
man-like brute (which he is), invariably gets it in the neck
(which, I regret to say, he doesn't). And so all is for the
best in the best of all possible services. In the Navy they
are nothing if not consistent and, while the military story-
teller who did not have his knife into the higher command
would be looked upon as a freak, “BARTIMEUs.” loyally
includes amongst his galaxy of perfect people Lords of the
Admiralty no less than the lower ratings. No one knows
the Navy and its business better than “BARTIMEUs,” and he
owes his popularity to that fact. Yet he tells us very little
about it, preferring to dwell on the personal attributes of
his individual heroes, throwing in just enough incidental
detail to give his stories the proper sea tang. Of late a good
many people have been busy informing us that the Navy,
like GILBERT's chorus-girl, is no better than it should be.
But the fault, if there be one, does not lie with the men that
“BARTIMEUs” has selected to write about in his latest novel,
The Long Trick (CASSELL), which will therefore lose none of
the appreciation it deserves on that account. And with
such a leal and brilliant champion to take the part of the
Navy afloat, the Navy ashore, whether in Parliament or out
of it, may very well be left to take care of itself.
-
Although Sir ARTHUR ConAN Doyle calls his collection of
detective stories His Last Bow (MURRAY), and also warns us
that Sherlock Holmes is “somewhat crippled by occasional
attacks of rheumatism,” there is not in my lay opinion any
cause for alarm. If I may jest about such an austere per-
sonage as Sherlock, I should say that there are several strings
still left to his bow, and that the ever amenable and admir-
ing Watson means to use them for all they are worth. At
any rate I sincerely hope so, for if it is conceivable that
some of us grow weary of Sherlock's methods when we are
given a long draught of them no one will deny that they
are palatable when taken a small dose at a time. Sherlock,
in short, is a national institution, and if he is to be closed
now and for ever I feel sure that the Bosches will claim to
have finished him off. And that would be a pity. Of these
eight stories the best are “The Dying Detective” and the
“Bruce-Partington Plans,” but all of them are good to
read, except perhaps “The Devil's Fort,” which left a
“most sinister impression” on dear old Watson's mind,
and incidentally on my own.
Every now and then, out of a mass of War-books grown
so vast that no single reader can hope even to keep count of
them, there emerges one of particular appeal. This is a
claim that may certainly be made for An Airman's Outings
(BLACKwooD), especially just now when everything associ-
ated with aviation *} was about to say sur le tapis, but
the phrase is hardly well chosen—so conspicuously in the
limelight. The writer of these modest but thrilling records
veils his identity under the technical nom de guerre of
“CoNTACT.” With regard to his method I can hardly do
better than repeat what is said in a brief preface by Major-
General W. S. BRANCKER, Deputy Director-General of

of the flying officer in France, simply and with perfect
truth; indeed he describes heroic deeds with such modera-
tion and absence of exaggeration that the reader will scarcely

imagination who is not helped by these pages to realise
some part of the debt that we owe to these marvellous
winged boys of ours. As for the heroic deeds, they are of
a kind to take your breath—tales of battles above the clouds,
of trenches captured by aeroplane, of men fatally wounded,
thousands of feet above the enemy country, recovering
consciousness and working their guns till they sank dead,
while their battered machines planed for the security of
friendly lines. Surely the whole history of War has no

Windy it certainly is—it runs to 496 pages—for I do not

this novel above the large class of the merely competent.
Odd what a vogue has lately developed for what I might
call the ultra-domestic school of fiction. Here is another
example, Married Life (CASSELL), in which Miss MAY
EDGINTON, following the mode, unites her hero and heroine
at the beginning and leaves them to flounder for our edifi-
cation amid the trials of double blessedness. I am sorry to
say it, but her great solution for the eternal problem of
How to be Happy though Married appears to be the pos-
session of a sufficient bank-balance to prevent the chain
from galling. In other words, not to be too much married.
All this love-in-a-cottage talk has clearly no allurement for
Miss EDGINToN. With her, the protagonists, Osborne and
his young wife, are no sooner wed than their troubles begin
—troubles of the domestic budget, of cooking and stove
lighting and the rest. (By the way, for all its carefully
British topography, I strongly suspect the whole story of
an exotic origin, chiefly from certain odd-sounding words
that seem to have slipped in here and there. Does our
island womanhood really talk of a matinée, in the sense of
an article of attire? If so, this is the first I hear of it). To

literary grace that saves his chapters from ever becoming
irritating even when they move most slowly.
If the vintage to which “Miss KATHARINE TYNAN's "
novels belong is so old that some of its flavour has departed,
there is no doubt that many of us are still glad enough
to sample it. In these nervous times it is in fact very
restful to read a book as calm and detached as Miss Mary
(MURRAY). Not that Mary refrained from allowing her heart
to flutter in the wrong direction, but even the simplest
of us couldn't really be alarmed by this excursion. Mrs.

THE SUGAR FIEND.
“I will have a cup of tea,” I said to
the waitress, “ China iſ possible; and
please don't forget the sugar.”
“Yes, and what will you eat with
it 2 " she asked.
“What you please,” I replied; “it is
all horrible."
I do not take kindly to war-time teas.
My idea of a tea is several cups of the
best China, with three large lumps of
sugar in each, and half-a-dozen fancy-
cakes with icing sugar all over them
and cream in the middle, and just a few
cucumber sandwiches for the finish.
(This does sound humorous, no doubt,
but I seek no credit for it. Humour
used to depend upon a sense of propor-
tion. It now depends upon memory.
present moment is the man who has
the most accurate memory for the
things he was doing in the early sum-
mer of 1914).
The loss of the cakes I could bear
stoically enough if they would leave my
tea alone, or rather if they would allow
me a reasonable amount of sugar for it.
However, we are an adaptable people
and there are ways in which even the
sugar paper-dish menace can be met.
My own plan, here offered freely to all
my fellow-sufferers, provides an admir-
able epitome of War and Peace. The
sugar allowance being about half what
it ought to be, I take half of the cup
unsweetened, thus tasting the bitter-
ness of war, and then I put in the sugar
and bask in the sunshine of peace.
On this particular occasion peace
was on the point of being declared
when I found my attention irresistibly
compelled by the man sitting opposite
to me, the only other occupant of my
table. At first I thought of asking
him not to stare at me so rudely, and
then I found that he was not looking
at me but over my shoulder at some
object at the end of the room. I can
resist the appeal of three hundred
people gazing into the sky at the same
moment, but the intense concentration
of this man was too much for me. I
turned round. Seeing nothing unusual
I turned back again, but it was too
late. My sugar had gone! No trace
of it anywhere, except in the bubbles
that winked suspiciously on the sur-
face of the miscreant's tea.
His face did not belong to any of the
known criminal types. It was a pale,
dreamy, garden-suburb sort of face—
a face you couldn't possibly give in
charge, except, perhaps, under the
Military Service Acts.
“Do you know,” I said to him, “that
you have just committed one of the
most terrible offences open to civilised
mankind—a crime even worse (Heaven
help me if I exaggerate) than trampling
on an allotment 2" -
“Oh, I'm sorry!” he replied, waking
from his dream. “Did you want that
sugar 2 You know, you seemed to be
getting on very well without it.”
As I could not believe him to be
beyond the reach of pity, I explained
my method to him, describing as har-
rowingly as I could the joy of those
first few moments after the declaration
of peace. I suggested to him that he
might sometimes find it useful himself,
if ever he should be compelled to sit
at an unoccupied table. (“Touché,” he
murmured, raising his hat). “And
now," I concluded, “as I have told
you my system, perhaps you will tell
me yours—not for imitation, but for
The ſunniest man in England at the avoidance.”
“There is very little to tell,” he replied
sorrowfully, “but it is tragic enough.
All my life I have been fond of sugar.
Before the war I took always nine
lumps to a cup of tea. (It was my
turn to raise my hat.) By a severe
course of self-repression I have reduced
it to seven, but I cannot get below that.
I have given up the attempt. There
are a hundred cures for the drink habit;
there is not one for the sugar habit. As
I cannot repress the desire, I have had
to put all my energy into getting hold
of sugar. I noticed some time ago that
at these restaurants they give the sugar
allowance to all customers who ask for
tea or coffee, although perhaps twenty
per cent. of them do not take sugar at
all. It is these people who supply me
with the extra sugar I need. In your
case it was an honest mistake. I always
wait to see if people are proposing to use
their sugar before I appropriate it.”
“But iſ you only take from the will-
ing,” I inquired, “why do you not ask
their permission ?” .
“I suppose I have given you the
right to ask me that question,” he
replied with much dignity, “but it is
painful to me to have to answer it. I
have not yet sunk so low that I have
to beg people for their cast-off sugar.
I may come to it in the end, perhaps.
At present the ‘earnest gaze' trick is
generally sufficient, or, where it fails, a
kick on the shin. But I hate cruelty.”
“Physical cruelty,” I suggested.
“No, any kind of cruelty. I have
said that in your case I made a mistake.
If I could repair it I would.”
“Well,” I said, “here's something
you can do towards it, although it's
little enough.” And I handed him the
ticket the waitress had written out for
me. “And now I'll go and get a cup
of tea somewhere.”
“One moment,” he said, as I rose to
go. “We may meet again.”
“Never!” I said firmly.
“Ah, but we may, I have a number
of disguises. Let me suggest something
that will make another mistake of this
kind impossible.”
“I am not going to give up my
plan," I said.
“No, don't,” he answered; “but why
not drink the sugared half first 2"

THE MUD LARKS.
THE ammunition columns on either
flank provide us with plenty of amuse-
ment. They seem to live by stealing
each other's mules. My line-guards
tell me that stealthy figures leading
shadowy donkeys are crossing to and
fro all night long through my lines.
The respective C.O.'s, an Australian
and an Irishman, drop in on us from
time to time and warn us against each
other. I remain strictly neutral, and
so far they have respected my neu-
trality. I have taken steps toward
this end by surrounding my horses
with barbed wire and spring guns,
tying bells on them and doubling the
uard. -
Monk, the Australian, dropped in
on us two or three days ago. “That
ties to his credit, including a Brigadier.
I have to twitch him to harness him,
side line him to groom him, throw him
to clip him, and dhrug him to get him
shod. Perceive the jest now? Esteemed
comrade Monk is afther pinchin' an in-
fallable packet o' sudden death, an' he
don't know it—yet.”
“What's the next move?” I inquired.
“I’m going to lave him there. Mind
you I don't want to lose the old moke
altogether, because, to tell the truth,
I'm a biteen fond of him now that I
know his thricks, but I figure Mr.
Monk will be a severely cured character
inside a week, an’ return the beastie
himself with tears an' apologies on
vellum so long.”
I met O'Dwyer again two days later
on the mud track. He reined up his
cob and begged a cigarette.
“Oh, so it was O'Dwyer's mule?”
Albert Edward cut in innocently.
Monk nodded hastily. “Yes, so it
turned out. Well, out of respect for
O'Dwyer I looked after it as far as it
would allow me, naturally expecting
he 'd come over and claim it—but he
didn't. On the fourth day, after it had
made a light breakfast off a bombardier's
ear and kicked a gap in a farrier, I got
absolutely fed up, turned the damn
cannibal loose and gave it a cut with
a whip for godspeed. It made off due
east, cavorting and snorting until it
reached the tank-track; there it stopped
and picked a bit of grass. Presently
along comes a tank, proceeding to the
fray, and gives the mule a poke in the
rear. The mule lashes out, catching
the tank in the chest, and then goes on
with his grazing without looking round,
darn Sinn Feiner is the
limit,” said he; “lifted
my best moke off me
last night while I was
up at the batteries.
He'd pinch BALAAM's

condolences, but Monk
waived them aside.
“Oh, it's quite all
right. I wasn't born
yesterday, or the day
before for that matter.
I'll make that merry
Fenian weep tears of
blood before I've fin-
ished. Just you watch.”

Fenian, called next day.

have been, of course.
But instead of being
dead the box of tricks

on. That roused the
mule properly. He
closed his eyes and laid
into the tank for dear
life; you could hear it
clanging a mile away.
“After delivering two
dozen of the bcst, the
moke turned round to
sniff the cold corpse,

“Ye know that herrin'-gutted bush-
ranger over yonder? He'd stale the
milk out of your tea, he would, be the
same token. Well, last night he got
vicious and took a crack at my lines.
I had rayson to suspect he'd be afther
tryin' somethin' on, so I laid for him.
I planted a certain mule where he could
stale it an' guarded the rest four deep.
|J3egob, will ye believe me, but he fell
into the thrap head-first—the poor
simple divil.”
“But he got your mule,” said Albert
Edward, perplexed, -
“Shure an' he did, you bet he did—
he got old Lyddite.”
Albert Edward and I were still
puzzled.
“Very high explosive—hence name,”
O'Dwyer explained.
“Dear hearrts,” he went on, “he's

Monk lookin' 'bout as genial as a wet
hen. This is goin' to be a wondherful
lesson to him. See you later.” He
nudged his plump cob and ambled off,
whistling merrily.
But it was Monk we saw later. He
wormed his long corpse into “Mom
Repos” and sat on Albert Edward's bed
laughing like a tickled hyena. “Fun-
niest thing on earth,” he spluttered.
“A mule strayed into my lines tºother
night and refused to leave. It was a
rotten beast, a holy terror; it could kick
a fly off its ears and bite a man in half.

dore and what's-is-name with my

upper-cut it on the point, hooked it
behind the ear, banged its slats, planted
his left on the mark and his right on
the solar plexus, but still the tank sat
up and took nourishment.
“Then the donkey let a roar out of
him and closed with it; tried the half-
Nelson, the back heel, the scissors, the
roll, and the flying-mare; tried West-
moreland and Cumberland style, collar
and elbow, Cornish, Graeco-Roman,
scratch-as-scratch-can and Ju-jitsu.
Nothing doing. Then as a last des-
pairing effort he tried to charge it over
on its back and rip the hide off it with
his teeth. -
“But the old tank gave a “good-by ee”
cough of its exhaust and rumbled off
as if nothing had happened, nothing at
all. I have never seen such a look of
surprise on any living creature's face
as was on that donk's. He sank down
on his tail, gave a hissing gasp and
rolled over stone dead. Broken heart.”

IMITATION AIR-RAIDS.
Mr. Punch is glad to note that some
real efforts are being made to meet the
public needs in this matter on nights
when there is no attack by the enemy.
In particular the owners of certain
large warehouses have come forward in
a spirited manner by giving directions
for the banging of large folding-doors
at suitable (irregular) hours. Private
individuals also, especially when re-
turning home late at night, can do
something in the way of supplying
entertainment for nervous residents in
the neighbourhood. Much is expected,
too, of the large dairy companies, who,
by their control of vast numbers of
heavy milk-cans, are in a peculiarly
favoured position. By the manipu-
lation of these vessels on a stone floor
a very complete imitation of a raid can
be produced. A good deal, of course,
can be done by any ordinary house-
holder. “I have had great fun,” one
correspondent writes, “with a very de-
liberate and heavily-striking Dutch

frequently jump up and run for the

[November 14, 1917.
THE FIRE-DRILL.
ONCE a month, as laid down in
“Orders for Auxiliary Hospitals for
Officers,” or some such document, we
practise fire-drill. This consists of es-
caping from upper windows by means
of precarious canvas chutes. The only
people exempted from this ceremony
are Mrs. Ropes—who watches with
great delight from a safe distance—and
Sister, who stands sternly at the top to
make sure (a) that those patients who
don't want to go down do go down, and
(b) that those patients who do want to
go down don't go down more than once.
No excuses are taken. The fixed ration
is one slither per chute per person.
We had this month's rehearsal last
Tuesday. The patients were put through
it first, Major Stanley—to his great dis-
gust—being chosen to lead the way and
set his juniors an example. He was
told that it was possible, by sticking
out his elbows, to go down as slowly
as he liked; but he must have done it
wrong somehow, for he disappeared
with startling suddenness the instant
he let go the window-sill, and almost
simultaneously his boots shot out at the
other end and doubled Dutton the butler
up so badly that he had to be taken away
and reinflated.
Haynes, who came next, insisted on
first making his dying speech from the
window, for, as he pointed out to Sister,
when people allowed themselves to be
inserted alive into machines of this
type there was every likelihood of their
reappearing at the other end in the form
of sausages. Seymour handed Sister a
bulky package labelled “WILL" before
starting, and most of us managed to be
mildly humorous in some way or other.
Mrs. Ropes, on the lawn, enjoyed it
all immensely; and so did Ansell, who
was standing beside her with an air of
detachment. Sister's eagle eye singled
him out.
“Come along, Mr. Ansell,” she called.
“I see you—your turn next. No shirk-
ing.” - * -
“I’m not in this, Sister,” he answered
loftily.
“Oh, indeed! And why not ?”
“Because I sleep on the verandah.
If there's a fire I simply get out of
bed and step into the garden.”
“Oh, no, you don't,” put in Seymour.
“That would be entirely contrary to
regulations. The official method of
escaping from burning buildings is
down the official chute. In case of
fire your correct procedure will be to
double smartly upstairs, commend your
soul to Providence in a soldier-like
manner, and toboggan smartly down.”
(Have I mentioned that Seymour is
an Adjutant 2)
“That's right, Captain Seymour,”
said Sister from above. “Bring him
up under escort if necessary.”
After the patients came Miss Ropes,
and after her the domestic staff, be-
ginning with the less valuable members
and working up gradually to Dutton
and Cook. It was possible to trace the
progress of the younger and slighter
maids by a swiftly-descending squeal,
while that of the more portly was
visible as a leisurely protuberance. At
last Cook was the only one left—Dutton
was not feeling quite up to performing
the journey. She was a new cook,
and very precious. She had all the
generous proportions of her profession,
and with them went a placid temper
and a great sense of personal dignity.
“Oh, Cook,” said Miss Ropes, “ you
needn't go down, you know, unless
you want to.” -
There are times when official regula-
tions must be sacrificed to diplomacy.
But Cook was in high good humour,
and quite determined on doughty deeds.
Miss Ropes said no more. * - a
The task of getting a wide cook int
a narrow canvas tube proved quite
unexpectedly difficult; and, when it was
accomplished, so far from sticking out
her elbows as brakes, she had to press
them close to her sides in order to
move at all. With the aid of a friendly
pressure applied to the top of her head
by Sister she got slowly under way.
The chute bulged portentously. The
bulge travelled a few feet; then it
stuck and became violently agitated.
Sister clutched at the top of the chute,
while Dutton hung manfully on to the
other end. ' . -
“Don't struggle,” said Sister in a
stern professional voice. “Keep your
arms still, and you'll come down all
right.” A muffled screaming and a
dangerously increased agitation of the
chute was the only reply. Cook had
quite lost her head and was having
violent hysterics. Three or four of us
raced upstairs to aid Sister in keeping
the top end of the apparatus from
jerking free, while several more went
to the assistance of the flustered
Dutton.
Cook ceased to struggle for a mo-
mént, but only through exhaustion;
for when Sister seized the opportunity
to repeat her advice a fresh paroxysm
came on, and everybody “stood to ” at
their posts again. Miss Ropes con-
ceived the idea of attaching a cord to
Cook's armpits and hauling her up
again by main force. She dashed into
the house, and found a demoralised
kitchen-maid calling incoherently for
help down the telephone.
Meanwhile Cook had had her worst
spasm. We hung grimly on to the
chute, dismally confident that some-
thing would have to give way soon.
Suddenly there was a rending sound;
the seam of the canvas ripped open
and a gaping slit appeared, through
which Cook's freed arm flapped wildly.
Then the arm disappeared as the body
to which it was attached gathered
momentum; and when Miss Ropes

OF A ForM MASTER who DREAMS THAT HE HAs CALLED ON
The WAR Coritespox DENT of “THE DAILY MAIL" For A
LITERAI, TRANSI, ATION OF THE OPENING SENTENCE OF
CAESAR's DE BELLo GALLIco.
“Omnis Gallia in tres partes divisa est.” Is it fanciful
to say of the three parts into which all Gaul is divided that
by their colours may they be known, the blue, the brown
and the ghastly, ghoulish, intolerable, bestial, but, thank
God, passing, grey? Yes, thank God, the blight of greyness
cannot last long; even now the scabrous plague is being
burnt up and swept back and overwhelmed by the resist-
less flood, eager yet cautious, persistent yet fiery, of the
blue and the brown. Hideous, pitiable, soul-searing are the
scars that it leaves in its mephitic wake, but the cleansing
tide of the brown and the blue sweeps on, and the healing
wand of time waves over them, and soon the shell-holes and
the waste places and the abominations of desolation are
covered with little flowers—or would be if it were Spring.
|
The Spring ! No one knows what depth of meaning lies
in that little word for our brave fellows, what intensity of
hopes and fears and well-nigh intolerable yearnings it
awakens beneath the cheery insouciance of their exteriors;
no one, that is, except me. They tell me about it as they
pass back, privates and generals, war-hardened veterans
and boys of nineteen with the youth in their eyes not yet
drowned by the ever-increasing encroachments of the war-
devil; all are alike in their cheerful determination to see
this grim and bloody business of fighting to an honourable
| end, and alike, too, in that their souls turn frankly, as
might children's, for refreshment and relief to the kindly
breast and simple beauties of Mother Nature.
|
The key-note of their attitude is given in the sentence,
spoken dreamily and as if in forgetfulness of my presence, by
a Corporal of the R.G.A. as I cleaned his boots—it was an
honour. “The blue—the blue—the blue—and the white!"
He was gazing skywards. I could see nothing but grey
clouds, but I knew that his young eyes were keener than
mine, that he had learnt to look into the inmost heart of
things in that baptism of fire, that travail of freedom, where
desolation blossoms and hell sprouts like a weed. Through
the grey he could discern the triumph of the blue and the
white of peace, when the work of the brown shall be done.
It was an allegory. More he told me, too, in his simple
country speech, so good to hear in a foreign land: of the
daisies in the yard at home, of the dandelions on the lawn,
of his pet pig; things too sacred to repeat here. And he
told me that the great event on the Front now is the
Autumn glory of the trees. Then he departed, and as he
went he broke into deep-throated, Homeric laughter, and
I—I understood: he was mocking Death. Even thus does
laughter yap at the heels of that dishonoured king out here.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 5th.-By way of
celebrating Guy Fawkes Day the Gov.
ernment announced their intention of
compensating, up to a limit of five hun-
dred pounds, any householder whose
property has been damaged in air-raids.
How soon he will cage his “monkey"
will depend upon the Treasury, which is
morbidly anxious lest in its transactions
bis dat qui cito dat should be literally
illustrated.
The official price of potatoes is still
unsettled. According to his own state-
ment the Food CoNTROLLER is only
waiting for the decision of the War
Cabinet. “On the contrary,” said Mr.
LAw, “the Cabinet is only waiting for
Lord RHoNDDA.” It seems to be another
case of the Earl of CHATHAM and Sir
RICHARD STRACHAN ; and in the mean-
time the potatoes are rotting.
Provided that no scarcity of gas for
other purposes is caused the Govern-
ment see no objection to its use for the
propulsion of motor-cars. On receiv-
ing this information Mr. PEMBERTON
BILLING at once ordered a Zeppelin
attachment to his famous torpedo-
shaped car. No other gas-consumer
will suffer, as he is prepared to keep
the apparatus inflated from his own
retorts.
By the scheme of the Boundary Com-
missioners, the roll of the Commons,
already a hundred per cent. too big for
its accommodation, is to be increased
by some thirty Members. Various sug-
gestions for enabling the new-comers to
assist at debates have been proposed.
“Dug-outs” under the existing benches,
whence they could poke out their heads
between the legs of other Members, and
“painters' cradles” depending from the
most popular.
In the circumstances it is not sur-
prising that the HoME SECRETARY stren-
uously resisted the proposal of the
London representatives to give another
couple of Members to “the hub of the
universe,” as Mr. WATT, momentarily
forgetting the claims of Glasgow, hand-
somely called it. Among a number
of minor concessions, Mr. THEoDoRE
TAYLOR's plea that Batley should be
associated with Morley “because they
have had many a tussle at cricket"
could not be resisted.
Tuesday, November 6th.-A state-
ment that the great War Savings meet-
ing at the Albert Hall cost £3,500,
chiefly for the expenses of delegates,
shocked the thrifty conscience of
Mr. Hogg|E, who hoped Mr. BALDw1N
would discourage the PRIME MINISTER's
meetings if they were so expensive.
Mr. BALDw1N did not condescend to
ceiling, or the galleries, are among the
answer him or he might have observed
that the delegates in question were
voluntary workers who by their exer-
tions had helped to raise over a hundred
millions for the prosecution of the War.
Mr. TILLETT, the newly-elected Mem-
ber for North Salford, took his seat, and
“Forgetting the claims of Glasgow.”
MR. WATT.
there was general cheering as, under the
safe-conduct of two amply-proportioned
friends, Little Ben was introduced to
Big Ben.
When Mr. BALFour informed Mr.
JowetT at Question-time that the only
commitments of Great Britain to
w
SIR JOHN SIMON.
France are contained in the Treaty of
Alliance of September 5th, 1914, which
has been duly published, he knocked
the foundation from under the subse-
quent peace-debate. But that did not
prevent Mr. LEEs SMITH from making
a long speech, on the assumption that
by promising to help France to recover
her ravished provinces we had impro-
perly extended the objects of the war.
Mr. McCURDY, who shares with Mr.
LEEs SMITH the representation of
Northampton, plainly hinted that if
his colleague cared to visit his con-
stituents they would be delighted to
present him with a specimen of the
local manufacture.
The speeches of Mr. BALFour and Mr.
Asquith, though well worth hearing,
were hardly needed to complete the rout
of the Pacifists; and, in the division
on the Closure, the men who are pre-
pared (in Mr. FABER's pungent phrase)
“to take the bloody hand of Germany”
made a very poor muster.
Wednesday, November 7th.-I am in-
clined to echo Lord SALISBURY's regret
that Labour has no direct representa-
tive in the Upper House. The prole-
tarian peer, if there were one, would
have been both surprised and delighted
to hear how the non-proletarians, with- |
out exception, spoke of his class.
My imaginary peer would have been
especially edified by the speech of Lord
MILNER, whom a small but noisy sec-
tion of the Press persists in describing
as more Prussian than the Prussians.
Not under-estimating the difficulties in
the way of a frank and full understand-
ing between Capital and Labour, he
nevertheless believed that they would
be overcome, because he had an abiding
faith in the mass of his fellow-country-
men. Not quite what one expects of a
British Junker, is it? -
Thursday, November 8th. — When
tonnage is so scarce it seems odd that
room can still be found for consign-
ments of wild animals. Mr. PETo drew
attention to a coming cargo, including
two hundred avadavats, the little birds
about which Joseph Surface was so
contemptuous, and six hundred mon-
keys—“sufficient,” as he pleasantly
observed, “to fill this House.”
‘For once Mr. BILLING expressed a
widely-held opinion when he questioned
the propriety, in present circumstances,
of holding the LoRD MAYor's Banquet.
Mr. Bonar LAw's solemn assurance
that he only accepted the invitation
on the distinct understanding that the
feast would fall completely within the
Food CoNTRolleR's regulations, was
not altogether convincing. Members
were anxious to know the exact dimen-
sions that Lord RHONDDA has laid down
for the turtle-ration. -

GILBERT.
WE are all very fond of Gilbert.
There are, however, one or two things
about him which even his best friends
will admit make it hard for us at times
to remember how much we really love
him. Sometimes he seems almost too
good to be true. Yet I have known
wet horrible days in the trenches when
the sight of him coming smiling down
the line, exuding efficiency and enthusi-
asm at every pore, has made his fellow-
officers positively dislike him.
For, alas, he is one of those dear over-
zealous fellows whom in moments of
depression we stigmatise as “hearty.”
He has even been known to be hearty
at breakfast; to come trampling into
the dug-out with that blinking old smile
on his face, expressing immense satis-
faction with life in general at the top of
a peculiarly robust voice; to tread on
his captain's toes and slap his next-door
neighbour heartily on the back, and
then to explain to a swearing and
choking audience how splendidly he
has slept, and what a topping day it is
going to be.
Never has Gilbert been known to
spend a bad night; he is one of those
fortunate animals who can go to
sleep standing and at five minutes' down.” And by way of example he
bert's, when the distant buzz that
notice, and start snoring at once. If
you try to sleep anywhere near him,
you dream of finding yourself in Covent
Garden station, trying to board endless
trains which roar through without
stopping—that's the kind of snore it is.
And now it is time I told my story.
It happened many years ago, when
the War was young and the Bosch
comparatively aggressive; when our
big guns fired once every other Sunday
and we lived precarious lives in holes
in the ground. Our Brigadier, a con-
scientious soldier of the old school, was
dodging round our line of trenches,
and had just reached the sector allotted
to my company, which was also Gil-
generally means an aeroplane overhead

“Can you spot him 2 ” said the
General to his Brigade-major; “one of
theirs, I suppose?”
Now it is as much as a Brigade-
Major's job is worth to confess ignor-
ance at such a crisis. So, after sweeping
the skies fruitlessly with his glasses and
listening intelligently to the steady
drone, he said, “Yes!” with as much
conviction as possible.
“Heads down,” said the General
sharply, “and don't move. Pass it

sat heavily on my periscope and stayed
gazing at the ground like a fakir lost in
meditation.
Meanwhile the message was passed
along, and the trench became silent as
the grave. I was informed a few days
later that it reached the outer battalion
of the next brigade later on in the
morning, and was popularly supposed
to have reached Switzerland the same
evening.
For about five minutes the droning
continued (“Having a good look at us,”
said the Brigade-major in a sepulchral
whisper) and then suddenly ceased with

And now that the Isle of Wight milkers

PETER, THE TEMPTER.
NECESSITY does not make stranger
bedfellows than some of the changes
brought about by War. Who, for ex-
ample—and certainly not such a born
sun-worshipper as I–would ever have
dreamt that a time would come when
we in London and the Eastern counties
would desire rain and wind with a pas-
sionate keenness once reserved solely
for fine weather? Yet so it is. By reason
of that foolish invention of flying we
now, when we go to the window in the
morning and lift the blind, are dashed
and darkly thoughtful if no sky of grey
scudding misery meets ourgaze. “Please
Heaven it pours!” we say. Just think
of it—“Please Heaven it pours!”
What a treachery ! It may even come
that we include prayers for storms
in the Liturgy.
In default of bad weather we may
have to Take Cover; and it is when we
Take Cover that discoveries begin and
long-postponed adventures fructify.
For years and years, for example, I had
looked down that steep hill by the
Tivoli site in the Strand into the
yawning cavern that opens there, and
wondered about it. I had thought one
day to explore it, but had never done
so, any more than I have yet pro-
ceeded further towards a visit to the
Roman Bath, also off the Strand, than
to threaten it.
But I shall get to the Bath yet,
because already, thanks to the interven-
tion of the Hun, I have become inti-
mately acquainted with Lower Robert
Street, and the next step is simple.
In the ordinary way, short of des-
perate impulse and decision—unless by
some happy chance I had relinquished
the burden of this pen and taken happy
service with one of the wine merchants
who store their treasure there — I
should never have entered Lower
Robert Street at all, for it goes no-
where and runs under the earth, and it
is damp and mouldy, and the only
doors, leading to this vault and that,
are locked. But for all these disabili-
ties Lower Robert Street is, in Gotha
and Zeppelin times, a very present
help and refuge. There assemble, with
more or less fortitude and philosophy,
the denizens of the Adelphi, thankful
indeed that the brothers Adam estab-
lished their streets and terrace on so
useful a foundation; and there twice
recently have I joined them. And an
odd assembly we have made, ranging
as we do from successful dramatists to
needy journalists, with an actress or
so to keep us manly.
There for long hours have we waited
until the “All clear” has sounded—or,
at any rate, some have done so. As for
myself, on the last occasion, taking
advantage of a lull in the uproar, I
crept away to bed, and, after falling
into the sleep of exhaustion, had the
ironical experience of being rudely
awakened by the reassuring bugles and
my night again ruined.
Having taken cover only in Lower
Robert Street, which is open to all, I
cannot with any personal knowledge
speak of the camaraderie of private
basements; but I suppose that that
exists and is another of the War's by-
products. I take it that, in the event
of a sudden alarm, no householder with
a cellar would be so inhuman as to
refuse admittance to a stranger, and
already probably a myriad new friend-
ships and not a few engagements have
resulted. Our own camaraderie is ad-
mirable. The federation of the barrage
breaks down every obstacle; while a
piece of shrapnel that one can display
is more valuable than any letter of
introduction, no matter who wrote it.
Hence we all talk; and sometimes we
sing too—choruses of the moment, for
the most part, in one of which the
depth of our affection for our maternal
relative is measured and regulated by
the floridity of the roses growing on
her porch.
And yet, when at last friendliness is

PUNCH, or THE LONDON
upon the town, there are people—and
not only alien Hebrews either—who
have been hurrying away from London!
When London has become more in-
teresting than ever before in its history
there are people who leave it!
Personally I mean to cling to the old
city as long as it will cling to me; but
even now across one's aching sight
comes a “dream of pastime premature”
which shakes such resolves a little.
Peter, for example, has been having
a disturbing effect on me. Only now
and then, of course—when I am not
quite myself; when the two and thirty
(what remains of them) are not so
firmly gritted as they should be; when
even London seems unworthy of devo-
tion.
But these moods pass. You will
admit, though, that Peter has his lure.
I read about him in the Tavistock
Gazette, one of the few papers, I fancy,
which does not belong to Lord North-
CLIFFE ; and this is how the lyric (it is
really a lyric, although it masquerades
as an advertisement) runs, not only in
the paper but in my head: “To be let,
by Tender” (this is not an oath but
some odd legal or commercial term)
“as and from Lady Day all that nice
little PASTURE FARM known as HIGHER
CHURCH FARM, situate in the village
of Peter Tavy.” Now what could be
more unlike London under the German
invasion and all that nasty little tunnel
known as Lower Robert Street, than
Peter Tavy 2
But I must not be tempted. I must
stick it out here.
LITERARY GOSSIP A LA MODE.
THE mystification practised by
authors who have passed off as their
own work the compositions of others
is familiar to all literary students.
SHAKSPEARE's assumption of borrowed
plumes is of course the classic example.
But another and more subtle problem
is the interchange of functions between
two men of letters; and the theory re-
cently advanced by the distinguished
critic and occultist, Mr. Pullar Leggatt,
deserves at least a respectful hearing.
Briefly stated, it is that during his
hermit existence at Putney the late
Mr. Sw1NBURNE effected an interchange
of this sort with Sir W. Robertson
NicoLL; the Editor of The British
Weekly devoting himself to the com-
position of poems, while the poet as-
sumed editorial control of the famous
newspaper. If the theory thus crudely
stated sounds somewhat fantastic the
arguments on which it is based are
extraordinarily plausible if not con-
vincing.
Distinguished Pianist (with a soul above Mendelssohn). “I’M AFRAID I can't.”
Tommy. “It Is A BIT of A TEASER, AIN'T It? THES MY sistER UP IN A KNoT when-
EVER SHE TACKLES IT." -
To begin with, experts in anagrams
will not fail to notice that the names
ALGERNoN Swinburn E and W. Robert-
son NicoLL contain practically the
same number of letters—absolutely the
same if Sw1NBURNE is spelt without an
“e"—and that the forenames of both
end in “-on,” as does also the conclud-
ing syllable of WATTs-DUNToN. The
fact that the Editor of The British
Weekly has never published any poems
over his own name only tends to con-
firm the theory, as the argument con-
clusively establishes.
For it is impossible to believe that
so versatile a polymath should not at
some time or other have courted the
Muse, and, if so, under what name
could he have had a stronger motive
for publishing his poems than that of
Swinburne 2 So austere a theologian
would naturally shrink from revealing
his excursions into the realms of poesy,
and under this disguise he was safe
from detection. Lastly, while Sir W.
Robertson NicoLL has always cham-
pioned the Kailyard School, Sw1NBURNE
lived at The Pines. The connection is
obvious, as thus: Kail, sea-kale, sea-
coal, coke, coker-nut, walnut, dessert,
pine-apple, pine.
As regards Swinburne's conduct of
The British Weekly, it is enough to
point to such alliterative and melodious
combinations as “Rambling Remarks”
and “Claudius Clear.” The theological
attitude of the paper presents difficul-
ties which are not so easy to overcome,
but Mr. Pullar Leggatt has promised
to deal with this question later on.
Meanwhile the diplomatic silence main-
tained by Sir W. Robertson NicoLL
and Mr. EDMUND GossE must not be
interpreted as conveying either a com-
plete acceptance or a total rejection of
this remarkable theory.

MY PYJAMAS.
A STUDY IN THE FASTIDIOUs.
I HoPE this is not going to be embarrassing. If so, it
is not my fault. This is history, please remember, not
fiction. I wanted—I am obliged to say it—pyjamas for
winter wear. I know all about pyjamas for summer wear;
what I wanted was pyjamas for winter wear, and I decided
that Agnes should make them. For years I have been
trying to get proper pyjamas—by which I mean pyjamas
properly made—but the haberdasher always smiles deprecia-
tion and tells me that the goods he offers me are what are
always worn. Quite so; but what I say is that out of
bed and for the purpose of having your photograph taken
Trade pyjamas are all right; but that in bed they commit
untold offences. I enter my bed clothed; I settle down
in it half-naked. The jacket has run up to my arm-pits;
my legs are bare to the knee; my arms to the elbows;
the loosely buttoned front is ruckled up into a funnel,
down which, whenever I move, the bedclothes like a bellows
draw a chill blast of air on to that particular part of my
chest which is designed for catching colds. When I turn
over in my dreams I wake to find myself tied as with ropes.
Slumber's chains have indeed bound me. I am a man in
the clothing of a nightmare. The cold, cold sheets catch
me in the most ticklesome delicacies of my back and make
me jump again. Enough. -
“Well,” said Agnes, “if I am going to make your
pyjamas you must tell me exactly what you want.”
“My pyjamas,” I said, “shall be buttoned round the
ankle and capacious below the waist—there I ask a Turkish
touch. The jacket shall be buttoned at the wrists and baggy
at the shoulder; at the chest it shall strap me across like
an R.F.C. tunic, and it shall be securely clipped to the
trousers.”
“Why not have it all in one?”
“What!” I cried, “and parade hotel passages in search
of the bath looking like a clown out of a circus 2 No, thank
you.” - -
“You must make me a pattern then,” said Agnes, “ or I
shan't know what to do.”
I can't make patterns, but I can, and I did, make plans
of ground and first-floor levels, a section and back and
front elevations, all to a scale of one inch to the foot
exactly. I also made a full-size detail of a toggle-and-cinch
ge; r linking the upper storey to the lower. .
“I think,” Agnes said, “you had better come to the
shop and choose the material.”
I thought so too. I wanted something gaudy that would
make me feel cheerful when I woke in the morning; but I
also had another idea in my mind. Mangle-proof buttons !
Have the things been invented yet?
The archbishop who attended to us deprecated the idea
of india-rubber buttons. . . . - -
“What kind are you now using?” he asked solicitously.
“At present, on No. 2,” I said, “I am using splinters
of mother-of-pearl. Last week, with No. 1, I used a steel
ring hanging by its rim to a shred of linen, two safeties,
and a hairpin found on the floor.”
I chose a flannel with broad green and violet stripes,
and very large buttons of vitrified brick which I hoped
might break the mangle. These buttons were emerald in
colour and gave me a new idea. Trimmings.
“I want to look right if the house catches fire,” I told
Agnes. “Green sateen collar to match the buttons—”
“And for the wristbands,” said Agnes, catching my
enthusiasm.
“And for the wristbands,” I agreed; “but,” I added,
“not at the ankles. That would make the other people
in the street expect me to dance to them, and I don't know
how to.”
And now the good work is complete. Toggle and cinch
perform their proud functions, and I sleep undisturbed by
Arctic nightmares, for I have substituted green ties for
the stoneware buttons which reduced my vitality by
absorbing heat. My only trouble is my increasing reluct-
ance to rise in the morning. I don't like changing out of
my beautiful things so early in the day. I am beginning
to want breakfast in bed.

Now the tired planes drone homeward through the
haze, -
And distant wood-fires wink behind the ridges,
And the first flare some timorous Hun betrays;
Now no shell circulates, but all men brood
Over their evening food;
The bats flit warily and owl and rat
With muffled cries their shadowy loves pursue,
And pleasant, Corporal, it is to chat
In this hushed moment with a man like you.
How strange a spectacle of human passions
Is yours all day beside the Arras road,
What mournful men concerned about their rations
When here at eve the limbers leave their load,
What twilight blasphemy, what horses' feet -
Entangled with the meat,
What sudden hush when that machine-gun sweeps,
And–flat as possible for men so round–
The Quartermasters may be seen in heaps,
While you sit still and chuckle, I'll be bound !
Here all men halt awhile and tell their rumours;
Here the young runners come to cull your tales,
How Generals talked with you, in splendid humours,
And how the Worcestershires have gone to Wales;
Up yonder trench each lineward regiment swings,
Saying some shocking things;
And here at dark sad diggers stand in hordes
Waiting the late elusive Engineer,
While glowing pipes illume yon notice-boards,
That say, “ Nóights. You must Not Lorten here."
And you sit ruminant and take no action,
But daylong watch the aeroplanes at play,
Or contemplate with secret satisfaction
Your fellow-men proceeding towards the fray;
Your sole solicitude when men report
There is a shovel short,
Or, numbering jealously your rusty store,
Some mouldering rocket, some wet bomb you miss
That was reserved for some ensuing war,
But on no grounds to be employed in this.
For Colonels flatter you, most firm of warders,
For sandbags suppliant, and do no good,
And high Staff officers and priests in orders
In vain beleaguer you for bits of wood,
While I, who have nor signature nor chit,
But badly want a bit,
I only talk to you of these high themes,
Nor stoop to join the sychophantic choir,
Seeing (I trust) my wicked batman, Jeames,
Has meanwhile pinched enough to light my fire.

“IN a few days,” says the puff preliminary of The Coming
(CHATTo AND WINDUs), “you and all your friends will be
reading and discussing this most strange and prophetic
novel.” Perhaps. But what we shall be saying about it
depends largely, I suppose, upon our definition of the term
prophetic; also a little upon our feeling with regard to good
taste and the permissible in fiction. My own contribution
will be a sincere regret that a writer as gifted as Mr. J. C.
SNAITH should have attempted the obviously impossible.
| His theme, symbolised by a wrapper-design of three figures
silhouetted against a golden sunrise, is a second advent of
the Messiah, embodied in the person of a village carpenter
named (with palpable significance) John Smith, whom local
prejudice sends, not inexcusably, to a madhouse, where he
dies, after converting the inmates and instituting a campaign
of universal peace. Frankly, the chief interest of such a
wildly fantastic idea lies in watching just how far Mr. SNAITH
can carry it without too flagrant offence. That his treat-
ment is both sincere and careful hardly lessens my feeling
that the whole attempt is one to be deplored. Humour of
the intentional kind has, of course, no place in the author's
scheme. How remote is its banishment you may judge
when I tell you that the Divine message is represented as
given to mankind in the form of a wonderful play, which
instantly achieves world-wide fame, being performed by no
fewer than fifty companies in America alone. The problem
(to name but one) of the resulting struggle between plenary
inspiration and the conditions of a fit-up tour is only another
proof of my contention that there are more things in heaven
and earth than can be treated in realistic fiction, and that
Mr. SNAITH's good intentions have unfortunately betrayed
him into selecting the least possible.
If Humphrey Thorncot and his sister Edith had not
bored one another and grown touchy—I judge by their
reported conversations—in a house with green shutters in
Chelsea, they would never have gone to St. Elizabeth,
which is a Swiss resort, and would never have met the
East-Prussian family of the von Ludwigs in the year
before the War. And Humphrey would never have fallen
(temporarily) in love with Hulda von Ludwig, nor would
Karl von Ludwig have fallen (permanently) in love with
Edith Thorncot. The troubles and miseries of this latter
couple are related by Mr. HUGH SPENDER in The Gulf
(CoLLINs). Papa von Ludwig objects so violently to all
this love-making that he eventually succumbs to a regular
East-Prussian stroke of apoplexy which all but leads to
a charge of parricide against Karl by his base brother,
JWilhelm. Karl is really too good for this world. He
objects to atrocities and refuses at the risk of his own life
to shoot innocent Belgian villagers. Being imprisoned, he
escapes by means of a secret sliding panel and an under-
ground passage which leads him, not immediately, but
after many vicissitudes, to America. There he is joined b
his faithful Edith, who defies the Gulf caused by the War,
and marries him. Mr. SPENDER appears to have been in
some doubt as to whether he should write the story of two

souls or the history of the first few weeks of the War.
Eventually he elects to do both, and his novel consequently
suffers somewhat in grip. He certainly paints a very vivid
picture of events in the first period of active operations.
May I hint a doubt, by the way, whether in 1913 a French
Professor would have mentioned HINDENBURG as one of
Germany's most important men? Whatever he may have
been in Germany, HINDENBURG was for the outside world
a later discovery.
Further Memories (HUTCHINson) is justly called by its
publishers a “fascinating volume.” The designation will
not surprise those who enjoyed the late Lord REDEsdale's
former book, of recollections. The present collection is
a little haphazard (but none the worse for that), its
chapters ranging over such diverse subjects as Gardens and
Trees, QUEEN VICTORIA, BUDDHA, and the Commune. Cer-
tainly not the least, interesting is that devoted to the story
of the Wallace Collection, of which Lord REDESDALE was
one of the trustees. His account of the origin and devolu-
and attractively drawn, and so is the picture on the wrapper,
though it represents no particular incident to be traced
in the pages of the volume which it adorns. Writing more
strongly than is perhaps her wont, Mrs. MANN has taken
some trouble to emphasise the fact that in these cases of
uncontrolled passion the major penalty of guilt is borne not
by the offenders themselves but by the first generation
succeeding. This does need saying occasionally, I suppose,
and to that extent The Victim redeems itself from the
charge of trivial unpleasantness.
Mr. J. RATH has really discovered a new type of heroine,
new at least this side the Atlantic. His farm-bred Sadie,
a Buffalo shirt-packer, classifies men by the sizes of their
shirts, has no use for any swain with a chest measurement
under forty, and eventually in a most original way finds
her hero in Mister 44 (METHUEN), an enormous Canadian
engineer and sportsman. She is no chicken herself and
has a passion to be free of the city and out in the great
open. Sadie is more than big; she is beautiful, burnished-
tion of the famous trea-
sures will invest threm
with a new interest in
the happy days when
they shall again be
visible. Mr. EDMUND
GossE contributes a
foreword to the present
volume, in which he
draws a pathetic pic-
ture of the author, still
unconquerably young,
despite his years, facing
the future with only
one fear, that of the un-
employment to which
his increasing deafness,
and the break-up of the
world as it was before
the War, seemed to be
condemning him. Fur-

guard against this me-
nace of stagnation. It was a measure for which we may
all be glad, as we can share Mr. GossE's thanksgiving that
the writer's death, coming when it did, saved him, as he
had wished, “from all consciousness of decrepitude.”
When an unstable young wife, getting tired of a pedantic
husband in the way so familiar to students of novels, goes
off with a companion more to her taste, anyone can foresee
trouble, or what would there be to write about 2 When,
further, her detestable lover, seeking change and fearing the
financial lash of his properly indignant parent, terminates
the arrangement, even an observer of real life can guess
that her return to her rightful lord and master must entail
disagreeables; but only a reader well brazened in modern
fiction could expect Don Juan promptly to make love to
and marry the husband's sister without a word of apology
to anyone. This kind of rather unsavoury dabbling in
problems best left to themselves generally concludes with
the decease of most of the characters and a sort of clearing
up, and to this rule, after many years and pages of dis-
comfort, MARY E. MANN's new story, The Victim (Hodder
AND STOUGHTON), is no exception. Not a very attractive
programme, but all the same the volume has one or two
redeeming features. For one thing, the sister is clearly
DIVER's books I know enough about them to be worried by
the commonplaceness of Unconquered (MURRAY). Like so
many other authors she has succumbed to the lure of the
War-novel. There may be a public for tales of this kind,
but I have not yet read one that approaches artistic success.
Here we are spared nothing. Sir Mark Forsyth goes to
France in the early days, is first of all reported “missing,
believed killed,” and then officially reported “killed.” Of
course he turns up again, but such a physical wreck that
the minx whom he was to have married breaks off the
engagement. Naturally the sweet girl, friend of Mark's
childhood, undertakes to fill the gap. The minx, Bel Alison,
is so scathingly drawn that from sheer perversity I found
myself hunting for one good point in her character; but
without a find. On the other hand, Lady Forsyth, Mark's
mother, and a quiet, capable man called Macnair, are
admirably put before us. Yet at best there remains the
conviction that the War is so terribly real that these
attempts to romance about it are almost bound to be as
superficial as they are superfluous.

For China's spiritual good,

Though under any other name,
However alien to their nature,
Your people would have smelt the same,

And studiously respected
The one that in your wisdom you selected.
And now, when someone, clearly set
On flattering you by imitation,
Applies that chosen epithet
To certain units of your nation,
It seems a little odd
That you should go and clap him into quod.
Perhaps you've come to hold the view
That when you claimed to touch their level
You were unfair to heathens who
Candidly called their god a devil;
Who fought some barbarous fights,
But fought at least according to their lights.
So Huns are off. Who takes their place?

seaman-like orders of the young officer of the watch.
“Hard a-port | Midships | Hard a-starboard | Port 20 !
Steady as she goes!” And ceaselessly the engine-room
telegraph tinkled, and the handy little craft, with death and
terror written in her workmanlike lines for the seaman, for
all her slim insignificance to the landlubber on the towering
decks of the great liner, swung smartly through the crowded

day's duty has been done. Nothing apparently has hap-

eyed young officer has succeeded another on the bridge,
with tired lines on a face grey beneath the great brown
hood of his duffle—a face so youthful, yet with the know-
ledge of the command of men writ plain thereon. The
propellers have swirled faithfully and unceasingly; the
good ship, in consequence has cleft the passive waves.
But who knows what hideous lurking peril of mine or

glowered at us, itself unseen, and retired again to its foul
underworld, baulked of its thirsted prey?

which he has not been Town Major.
Between times he has been Intelligence
Officer, Divisional Burial Officer, Di-
visional Disbursing Officer, Salvage
Officer, Claims, Baths, Soda-water and
Canteens Officer.
He was once appointed Town-Major
of some brick-dust, a rafter and two
empty bully-beef tins—all of which in
combination bore the name of a village.
He assumed his duties with a bland
Pickwickian zest, which did good to
the heart. He had boards painted.

didactically, “MUsTNoTTRoT THROUGH
THE MAIN STREET.” That there was no
street there at all did not detract from
the splendour of his notices, on which
he spent much paint and happiness.
With the slightest encouragement he
would have placarded that arid wilder-
ness with “No SMoRING IN THE LIFTs,”
and “BEwARE OF PICKPoCKETs,” but he
had small encouragement, and so he
contented himself with a final placard
which warned the troops against riding
through standing crops and occupying
the houses of civilians without permis-
sion from the Town-Major.
Still, no one becomes a Town-Major . . . .
without some sort of claim to the post.
Second-Lieut. St. John's first appear-
ance in Armageddon took place during
“peace-time warfare.” An unpleasant
and quite unnecessary little bulge in
the trench-line, known as the Toadstool,
was manned by the platoon of which he
found himself second-in-command. It
is rumoured that a Hun patrol, crawl-
ing to the edge of our parapet, saw in
the ghastly glare of a Verey light the
benign and spectacled countenance of
Second-Lieut. St. John staring amiably
across No Man's Land, and came to the
hasty conclusion that they had made a
mistake as to direction, since here was
obviously one of their own officers of
the Herr Professor type. Rumour adds
that they retired to their own lines and
were promptly shot for cowardice.
Certain it is that on that particular
night Second-Lieut. St. John did a
thing the full details of which are now
revealed to the Intelligence Corps for
the first time. He fired a Verey light.
It pleased him enormously. The sense
that he, and he alone, was the cause of
all those sliding shadows and that flood
of greenish light in No Man's Land
went to his head like strong drink. He
fired another and another and another

his hands at it, and fired the second.

“The Crystal Palace,” said Second-
Lieut. St. John, “isn't in it.” And
then, because his watch had ended, he
handed over to another yawning sub-
altern and went to bed.
Over miles and miles of country wild-
eyed gunners were glaring into the
night and asking each other blasphem-
ous questions. What did it mean?
“It must be Huns,” said the British
gunners; “they're coming over.”
“That is without doubt an English
signal,” said the enemy. “We will
prepare for an attack.”
Then the Hun gunners suddenly
made up their minds to be on the
safe side, and they put down a tre-
mendous barrage on to No Man's

A Hun sentry, waking with a start,
sounded the gas alarm. It was taken
up all along the German line and over-
heard by a vigilant British sentry, who
promptly set himself to make all pos-
sible noise with every possible means.
Old Erench ladies in villages twenty
miles back from the line lay all that
night hideous in respirators. Anxious
Staffs rang up other anxious Staffs.
Gunners questioned the infantry. The
infantry desired information from the
gunners. All along the line the pri-
vate soldier was jolted from that kind
of trance which he calls “getting down
to it,” and was bidden to stand to till
morning.
And our Mr. St. John, who was a
new and superfluous officer and liable
to be overlooked, slept through it all
with a fat smile.
It was after that that they made

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.
V.
Convers ATION ON CHAPTER LXXIII.
Mary. There were two things in your
last chapter that I did not quite under-
stand—the National Debt and the
Flappers.
Mrs. M. About the National Debt,
my dear child, I think you must wait
until your papa comes home to tea,
but perhaps I can satisfy your curiosity
about the Flappers, who were indeed
amongst the most singular and formid-
able products of the age we have been
discussing. The origin of the term is
obscure, some authorities connecting it
with the term “flap-doodle," others
with the motion of a bird's wings, and
I remember a verse in an old song
which ran as follows:–
“Place me somewhere east of Suez
On a lone and rocky shore,
Where the Britons cease from Britling
And the flappers flap no more.”
This, however, does not throw much
light on the subject. Perhaps the term
Flapper may best be defined as meaning
a twentieth-century hoyden, and was
applied to a type of girl from the age
of thirteen to seventeen, whose extra-
vagances in speech, manner and dress
caused deep dismay among the more
serious members of the community. In
particular the learned Dr. SHADWELL
denounced them with great severity in
a leading review, but with little result.
They bedizened themselves with frip-
pery, shrieked like parrots on all occa-
sions and interpreted the motto of the
time, “Carry On," in a sense deplor-
ably remote from its higher significance.
George. I think it seems, Mamma,
as if the young girls of those times
must have tried to make themselves as
unpleasant as possible. How thankful
I am that Mary is not a Flapper!
Mrs. M. You may well be. But
allowance must be made for the mis-
applied energy of our ancestors. If
the Flappers excite our disgust, their
subsequent treatment moves our com-
miseration, since the Sumptuary and
Disciplinary Laws passed by the House
of Ladies dealt in drastic fashion with
the offences which I have described.
As a matter of fact many Flappers
grew up into excellent and patriotic
women. I remember my grandmother
saying to me once, “When I was six-
teen I had a voice like a cockatoo and
the manners of a monkey,” but nothing
could have been more discreet or sedate
than her deportment in old age.
Richard. Did the Flappers speak
English 2
Mrs. M. Presumably; but, judging
from the records of their dialect which
have come down to us, their speech
was made up of a succession of squeals
rather than of articulate words, and
has so far defied the efforts of modern
philologists. Indeed speech seems to
have been almost at a discount, owing
to the immense popularity of the moving
picture play, then in its infancy and as
yet unaccompanied by mechanical re-
production of the voices of the actors.
Indeed at one time it was said that
there were only three adjectives in use in
Flapper society—“ripping,” “rotten"
and “top-hole,” I think they were.
George. What stupid words! I wish
they could have heard some of papa's
adjectives.
Mrs. M. Your father, my dear, has a
copious and picturesque vocabulary,
but phrases which are pardonable in
moments of expansion in a person of
mature years are not always suitable
for juveniles.
THE TRANSGRESSOR.
I was walking painfully along a
lonely road towing my three-thousand-
guinea ten-cylinder twelve-seater. Ac-
cording to Regulation 777 X, both
brakes were on. My overcoat collar
was turned up to protect my sensitive
skin from a blasting easterly gale, and
through the twilight I was able to see
but a few yards ahead. I had a blister
on my heel. Somewhere, many miles
to the eastward, lay my destination.
Suddenly two gigantic forms emerged
from the hedgerow and laid each a
gigantic paw upon my shoulders. A
gruff voice barked accusingly in my
ear.
“You are the owner of a motor-
car 2 ''
Was it any use denying the fact 2 I
thought not.
“Yes,” I replied humbly, “I am.”
“Have you the permit which allows
you to possess this?” He waved to-
wards the stagnant 'bus.
“I have.” -
“Have you the licence which allows
you to take it upon the high road 2"
With frozen fingers I held it out to
him. He moved to the back of the car,
unscrewed the entrance to the petrol
tank and applied his nose to the aper-
ture. After three official sniffs he turned
upon me aggressively.
“There is an undeniable odour of
petroleum. How do you account for
that ?”
“Sir,” I replied, “last week my little
son had his knockabout suit dry-cleaned
in Perthshire by the petrol-substitute
process. This morning he climbed
upon the back of the car to see whether
his Silver Campine had laid an egg in
the hood.”
He glared at me.
“Ah! Have you the necessary exten-
sion which allows you to use a motor-
car as a habitation for hens?”
I gave it to him.
Then, frustrated with fury, he thun-
dered at me successively: “Have you
a towing permit 2 Have you a dog
licence? Can you produce a boot and
shoe grant? Do you hold any rubber
shares? Have you been inoculated for
premature decay ? What did you do in
the Great War 2" * ,
I gave him the necessary documents
in perfect order. For a moment he was
nonplussed. Then he asked with sly
intention, “Have you the champagne
and chicken sandwich ration which is
apportioned to super-inspectors?”
I handed it to him with a table-nap-
kin (unused) and a pair of wire-cutters
thrown in. For some minutes he re-
mained silent, except in the gustatory
sense, then he turned upon me and,
handing back an empty bottle, said
triumphantly, “You must now produce,
under Clause 5005 Gerrard, framed this
morning at 11-30 o'clock, one pint of
old ale and six ounces of bread and
cheese for the sustentation of the sub-
inspector.”
I regarded him stonily and leant
against the cold, cold bonnet of the car.
Alas! I had it not.
“Sir,” I pleaded, “I did not know
. . . give me time. The next inn is
but a few miles. If you and your com-
panion will take a seat I will bring you
to the inn door and all will be well.”
He laughed in my face.
“Algernon Brocklebank Smith,” he
said sternly, “you have betrayed your-
self into our hands.” He turned to
his myrmidon: “Get a move on you,
Herbert; it's a bit parky standing about
here.”
After all he was but a coarse fellow.
Herbert, galvanised into action, pro-
duced a small oblong object from his
pocket, lighted the end of it with the
glowing butt of one of my Corona
Coronas, and placed it underneath the
car. In a few moments all that re-
mained of my three-thousand-guinea
ten-cylinder twelve-seater was one
small nut, which was immediately im-
pounded.
I raised the collar of my overcoat
(second reeſ), shifted my face to the
eastward, and, notwithstanding the
blister on my heel, turned my steps
towards my destination.
I uttered no plaint. I had trans-
gressed against the immutable law.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 12th.-An old
Parliamentarian, when asked by a friend
to what party the PRIME MINISTER
now belonged, sententiously replied,
“He used to be a Radical; he will some
day be a Conservative; and at present
he is the leader of the Improvisatories.”
The latest example of his inventive
capacity does not meet with unmiti-
gated approval. Members were very
curious to know exactly how the new
Allied Council was going to work, and
what would be the relations between
the Council's Military advisers and the
existing General Staffs of the countries
concerned. Mr. BonAR LAw assured
the House that the responsibility for
strategy would remain where it is now,
but did not altogether succeed in ex-
plaining why in that case the Council
required other military advisers.
The SECRETARY FoR Scotland is about
the mildest-mannered man that ever
sat upon the Treasury Bench. But
even he can be “très méchant" at a
pinch, . When Mr. WATT renewed his
complaint that sheriffs - principal in
Scotland had very little to do for the
high salaries they received, Mr. MUNRo
replied that “it would just be as unsafe
to measure the activities of the sheriff-
principal by the number of appeals he
hears as to measure the political activi-
ties of my hon. friend by the number
of questions he puts.”
The Pensions Department at Chelsea
is to be reorganised. Mr. Hodge ex-
cused the delays by pointing out that
an average of thirty-three thousand
letters a day is despatched, but, as he
added that there is a staff of four thou-
sand five hundred persons to do it, it
hardly looks as if they were overworked.
Tuesday, November 13th.-The House
of Lords was to have discussed the
state of Ireland, but, owing to the
absence of its LEADER, fell back
upon the less exciting but more
practical topics of sugar-sub-
stitutes for jam, and barley for
beer. It was cheering to learn
from the Duke of MARL-
BoRough that the jam-manu-
facturers gave great care to ºs
to refer to the “stupid decisions” of the
Board of Trade, Mr. WARDLE was down
on him in a moment. With the air of
one who had been born and brought
up in Whitehall Gardens, he replied,
“Stupid decisions are not made by the
Board of Trade.”
The Pacifists had rather a mixed day.
PENSIONS. "
MR. HODGE.
They were visibly relieved when Mr.
BonAR LAw (supported by Mr. AsquitH)
declined to admit into the Bill for ex-
tending the life of this Parliament a
provision enabling constituencies to get
rid of Members who had ceased to
represent them. But they did not like
his contemptuous reference to their
argumentative powers. Mr.TREVELYAN,
who regards himself as the representa-
tive (by literary descent) of CHARLES
JAMES Fox, was particularly annoyed.

cose, and from Lord RHONDDA
that there would be plenty of
barley for both cakes and ale.
Mr. WARDLE is the latest
example of the poacher turned
gamekeeper. A few months
ago, as leader of the Labour
Party, he was instant in criti-
cism of the ineptitutes of
Government officials. This

DR. MACNAMARA.
As party-funds are rather under a
cloud just now the Government thought
they might justify their existence by
drawing on them for the campaign
against enemy propaganda. But their
custodians thought otherwise. The
Tory Whip was prepared to make a
small contribution; the Liberal would
give nothing, on the ground that the
total required was extravagantly large.
So the country will have to foot the bill.
Wednesday, November 14th. — The
knowledge that Mr. Asquith was to
“interpellate” the PRIME MINISTER re-
garding his recent speech in Paris, and
the Allied War Council therein de-
scribed, brought a crowd of Members
to the House, and filled the Peers'
Gallery with ex-Ministers scenting a
first-class crisis.
'The protagonists on entering the
arena were loudly cheered by their
respective adherents, but the expected
duel did not come off. Mr. Asquith's
questions were searching enough, but
not provocative. Mr. LLoyd GeoRGE's
reply was comprehensive and concilia-
tory, and ended with the promise of a
day for discussion. Instead of a fight
there was only an armistice, usually a
preliminary to a definite peace.
A little disappointed, perhaps, the
Peers betook themselves to their own
Chamber, there to hear Lord PARMooR
discourse upon the woes of conscien-
tious objectors. Many of them, he
thought, had been vindictively punished
for their peculiar opinions. Nobody,
in a somewhat cloudy discussion, made
it quite clear whether the Tribunals
or the Army authorities or the Home
Office were most at fault; and Lord
CURzoN's suggestion that persons who
refused not merely to fight but to
render any kind of service to their
country in its time of need were not
wholly free from blame had almost the
The Air-Force Bill passed
through Committee in one sit-
ting. The credit for this
achievement may be divided
equally between Major BAIRD,
who proved himself once more
a skilful pilot, and Mr. BIL-
LING, who spoke so often that
other intending critics got lit-
tle chance. Counting speeches
and interruptions, I find from
the official reports that he ad-
dressed the House exactly one
hundred times; and it is there-
foreworth noticing that his last
words were, “This is what you
call muzzling the House of
Commons.”

have been wiser not to have adduced
the argument that Ireland was a terra

by enforcing “a superficial quiet,” to

a thud. -

BOON FOR BUSY BRIDEGROOMS.
IN these days of military hustle, when
a soldier comes home, falls in love, gets
engaged, marries, sets up a home, and
returns to the Front in less than a
week, there is little time for the ordi-
nary courtesies of matrimonial pro-
cedure. It is felt, therefore, that the
appended printed form of thanks for
wedding presents—based on the model
of the Field Service Postcard—will
prove a great boon to all soldiers who
meditate matrimony during short leave.
It will be found sufficient merely to
strike out inappropriate words in the

ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE LETTER.
ONCE upon a time, not so very long
ago, an illustrious man of affairs—
soldier and statesman too—visited our
shores, and by his wise counsels so
captured the imagination of his hearers
and readers that one of the greatest of
all compliments was paid to him, and
anyone with a black cocker spaniel to
name named it after him ; and he had
a name rather peculiarly adapted to
such ends too.
It chanced that among the puppies
thus made illustrious was one which a
young soldier before leaving for France
to win the War gave to his sister, and
when writing to him, as, being a good
girl, she regularly and T
abundantly did, she never
omitted to give tidings
as to how the little crea-
ture was developing; and
in the whole history of
dogs, from ToBIT's faith-
onwards, there never was
a dog so packed with in-
telligence and fidelity as
Most girls' dogs

caught in the last raid, and how Uncle
Jim had influenza and couldn't go on
being a special, and how Aunt Sibyl
had been introduced to one of the
GEDDESEs and talked to him as though
it was the other, and how she herself
had met Evelyn in the street the other
day and Evelyn had asked “with sus-
picious interest after you"—and a
thousand other things such as a good
sister, even though busy at a hospital,
finds time to write to a brother over
there, all among the mud and the shells,
winning the War. And not being in
the habit of signing her name, when
writing in this familiar way, she finished
up with a reference to the darlingest
of all dogs by sending its love at the

she sighed, turning over an envelope
across which an ant seemed to have
walked and left an inky trail. “I’ve
mislaid my glass too, and shan't be
able to read a word. Where could I
have put the miserable thing?” she
asked, peering again at the ridiculous
little script.

that one of her recent letters failed to
catch up with him. That was a pity,
because it was a better letter than
usual. It gave all the news that
he would most want to hear. It said
what picture her father was working
on at the moment, and told, with-
out spoiling them, his two last
jokes. It said whom her mother had
called on and who had called on her
mother and how something must be
done to stop her smoking too many
cigarettes. It said that their young
brother, having sprained his ankle at
hockey, had become a wolf for jig-saw
puzzles. It said where their parents
had dined recently and where they
were going to dine and who was
coming next week. It said what she
had seen at the theatre last Saturday
and what book she was reading. It
said which of the other W.A.D.'s had
become engaged. It said what an
awful time they had had trying to
buy some tea, and how scarce butter

forth. -
Well, the letter, as I have said, could
not be delivered. The postal people at
the Front, and behind the Front, are
astonishingly good, but they could not
get in touch with the brother this time,
and therefore they opened the letter and
looked at the foot of it for the name of
the writer and found that of the dog,
and at the head of it for the street and

THE MUSICAL CRITIC'S ORDEAL.
[Mr. CYRIL Scott, the musical composer,
in his recently published volume on The
Philosophy of Modernism in its connection
with Music, states that the criterion of lofty
music, the method of gauging the spiritual
value of art, “is only possible to him who has
awakened the latent faculties of the pineal
gland and the pituitary body.”]
LATELY I've been reading CYRILScott's
Book on Music, modern and unmuz-
zled,
And, though solving many toughish
knots,
By one statement I am sadly puzzled,
Namely, that if we would understand
What divides the noble from the
shoddy
We must cultivate “the pineal gland,”
Also “the pituitary body.”
But unfortunately Scott refrains
(Hence my present painful agitation)
From elucidating how one gains
This desiderated consummation.
Must I fly to silken Samarcand,
Or explore the distant Irrawaddy
For the culture of my pineal gland
And of my pituitary body?
Is the object gained by force of will
Or some drastic vegetarian diet 2
Does it mean a compound radium pill
Causing vast upheaval and disquiet 2
Do I need some special “Hidden Hand,”
Or the very strongest whisky toddy
To arouse my dormant pineal gland,
My unused pituitary body?
Should I read the works of Mr. YEATs,
Or the lays of WILcox (ELLA
WHEELER) 2
Must I visit the United States
And consult the newest occult
“healer” 2
Is the tragedy of IBSEN's Brand
Or the humour of Poor Pillycoddy
Better feeding for my pineal gland
And for my pituitary body?

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
GENERALLY speaking, stories left unfinished because of
the death of the writer in mid course can only be at best an
uncomfortable, exasperating legacy to his admirers. But
by a thrice happy chance this is not the case with the two
novels upon which the late HENRY JAMES was engaged at
the time of his fatal illness. This good fortune comes from
the fact that it was the writer's habit “to test and explore,”
in a written or dictated sketch, the possible developments
of any theme before embarking upon its treatment in detail.
I get the phrase “test and explore,” than which there could
be no better, from the brief preface to the volume now
before me, The Ivory Tower (CoLLINs). It exactly suggests
the method of this preliminary study, doubly precious now,
both as supplying the key by which we can understand the
fragment that has been worked out, and as in itself giving
us a glimpse, wonderfully fascinating, of its evolution.
The Ivory Tower (called so characteristically after an object
whose bearing upon the intrigue is of the slightest) is a
study of wealth in its effect upon the mutual relations of a
small group of persons belonging to the plutocracy of pre-
war America. Its special motive was to be a development
of situation as between a young legatee, in whom the
business instinct is entirely wanting, and his friend and
adviser, whom he was presently to detect in dishonest deal-
ing, yet refrain from any act of challenge that would mean
exposure. “Refrain"—does this not give you in one word
the whole secret of what would have been a study in
character and emotion obviously to the taste of the writer?
For itself, and still more for the glimpse of what it was to
become, The Ivory Tower must have a place in every
collection where the unmatchable wit of HENRY JAMES is
honoured as it should be.
Something less successful perhaps for itself, though even
more absorbing technically, is the volume containing the
unfinished fragment of another HENRY JAMES novel, to be
called The Sense of the Past (CoLLINs). Here especially it
is the preliminary study that furnishes the chief interest;
the spectacle of this so-skilled craſtsman struggling to
master an idea that might well, I think, have been found
later too unsubstantial, too subtly fantastic, for working
out. Very briefly, the theme is to treat of a young American,
in whom this “Sense of the Past" is all-powerful; whom
the gift of an old London house and its furnishings enables
to transport himself bodily into the life of 1820. More than
this, he lives that life (and it is here that one suspects the
idea of becoming unmanageable) in the person of an actual
youth of that time, in whom a corresponding Sense of the
Future has been so strong that he has answered the curi-
osity of his descendant by an exchange of personalities. Of
course the dangers and confusions of the plan, a kind of
psychological version of one often used in farce (except that
it precisely wasn't to be any manner of dream), are such
as might well alarm any writer—and, one might add, any
reader also. It is a further misfortune that the style of
what is actually written should be in the master's most
remote and obscure manner, so much so that one is forced

to wonder whether, without the notes as guide, it would
be in any sort clear what the whole thing was about. The
transition, for example, from the actual to the supernatural
event is so abrupt that it might well have left the uninformed
helplessly befogged. But this very fact again, as supposing
some further treatment only now to be guessed at, helps to
make the unique fascination of the book as revealing the
difficulties and rewards of letters.
Whatever Mr. ERNEST THoMPsoN SEToN cares to write
I am glad to read, but there were moments in The Preacher
of Cedar Mountain (Hodder AND STOUGHToN) when the
great moral lesson of the story was as much as I could
bear. The tale reveals the spiritual and moral development
of Jim Hartigan. The author assures us that most of the
characters are drawn from life, and that some of the main
events are historical. All which IIT -
can easily believe, for Mr. SEToN's
blunt method of describing Jim
Hartigan's evolution from an
unhallowed stable-boy to a mus-
cular Christian continually sug-
gests reality. It is not a stylish
method, but it gets home, and in
a tale of this kind that is the
main, if not the only, matter
of importance. Jim's besetting
weaknesses were drink and an
overwhelming love for horses.
The former he conquered fairly
soon, but the latter tripped him
up more than once, and if he
had not been guided by the wisest
woman who ever came from the
West his end would have been
chaotic. The races at Fort Ryan
are excellently described, and as
a picture of the West of America|
some forty years ago you will
find this story of Jim's conver-
sion both instructive and intri-
guing. All the same Mr. SETON
has so often delighted me by his -
tales of the animal world that I | | | ||

NorBIs has contrived to create
yet another new story, without
infringement of his own or any-
one else's copyright. Thanks to
the incidence of War and the
author's skilful manipulation of
Europe's distresses (for once the
KAISER's intrusion into the mid-
dle of a peaceful—almost too
peaceful—narrative is not un-
welcome), the second half of The
Fond Fugitives (HUTCHINson) is
better than the first. Not, indeed,
that such a wary hand as the
writer has been so ill-advised as
to follow his hero to, Flanders,
or even to let his heroine do so;
but his wounded soldier, come

derstanding grown big enough to
realise that a girl, though in-
discreet once, may yet be adorable
ever after, is certainly more to
one's taste than the philanderer
about town, admiring other men's
wives, in July, 1914. And so the
story, slight though it is, ends
on a strong note and with fair
hope of happiness for two wiser
and not much sadder people.

been distinguished by quantity rather than by quality.
Possibly the authors, realising that the wildest flights of
their highly-trained fancies could never match the actual
machinations of the German Secret Service as revealed in
the official news, have not put their hearts into the work.
In The Lost Naval Papers and other stories º Mr.
BENNET CoPPLEston E has shown unusual boldness in con-
necting the activities of his super-policeman, Dawson, with
the more prominent events of the War. Indeed, I am not
sure that the terror he professes to feel in the presence of
: the Scotland Yard official (for he tells his stories in propria
persona) is not to some extent justified. “Dora" is very
sensitive and six months ago would never have permitted
Mr. CoPPLEstone to reveal to our enemies either the bump-
tious egoism of a nameless First Lord or the platitudinous
vacillations of an anonymous Premier, even in the interests
of popular fiction. Though we concede his audacity in allow-
ing his superlative sleuth to stop a general strike of engineers
by threatening them with martial law and to tempt the
in pathetic flight before the shadow of their daughter's
disgrace; but it is the freshness of the heroine herself,
outraging all tradition by refusing, though without bravado,
to remain for ever in the gloom of a childish error, that one
likes to remember. Altogether, the author's friends will
find this book not at all below the level of his best work.

In which your valiant legions vie
With HANNIBAL's renown, I trust

You may enjoy the Julian Alps—

And sent 'em wallowing through my

For days and days he kept the lid
Hard down upon his low designs,
Then simply walked across and did
Just what he liked with all my lines.
The fellow doesn't keep the rules;
Experts (I'm one myself) advise
That in trench-warfare even fools
Cannot be taken by surprise;
It isn't done; and yet he came
With never a previous “Are you

And caught me—this is not the game—
Bending my thoughtful gaze else-

an H.B. pencil and a Webster Dic-
tionary. The routine is simplicity it-
self. As soon as anybody informs him
of a new arrival in the area he fishes
out the dictionary, plays Tit-Tat-Toe
with the H.B., writes out the word
that it lands upon at the end of his
rhyme, and, hey presto! there is an-
other day's work done.
But one day, for the sake of greater
secrecy, it became necessary to rename
all the units of the area, and the
Literary Adviser suddenly found him-
self put to it to provide about three
hundred new Code Names at once.
Heroically he set to work with his
dictionary, his H.B. pencil, and his
little rhyme. For two days the Re-
splendent Ones in the General Staff
Office bore patiently with the muttering
madman in the corner. For two days
he fluttered the leaves of his dictionary
and whispered hoarsely to himself,
“Tit-tat-toe, my-first-go, three-jolly-
nigger-boys-all-in a-row,” picking out
work after word with unerring accuracy
until the dictionary was a waste of
punctures and three generations of
H.B.'s had passed away. Before the
second day was out the jingle had
done its dreadful work. It was as
much as the clerks could do to avoid
keeping step with it. The climax came
when the Senior Resplendent One, look-
ing down at the telegram he was writ-
ing, found to his horror that he had
written, “Situation quiet Tit-Tat-Toe.
Hostile artillery activity normal Tit-
Tat-Toe,” and so on, substituting this
abomination in place of the official stop,
“Ack-Ack-Ack”) throughout.
It was enough. Still gibbering, the
Literary Adviser was hurled forth from
- the office and told to work his witch-
craft in solitude.
Paler, thinner and older by years he
emerged from his retirement trium-
phant, and the new code names went
forth to a flourish of trumpets or rather
of the hooters of the despatch-riders.
Then it began. For days he was
subjected to rigorous criticisms of his
selection. “Signals” tripped him up
first by pointing out two units with the
same name, and they also went on to
point out that the word was spelt
“cable" in the first instance and
“cabal” in the second. The gunners,
working in groups, complained bitterly
that a babel had arisen through the
similarity of the words allotted to their
groups. One infuriated battery com-
mander said it was as much as he
could do to get anyone else on the
telephone but himself.
Touched to the quick by criticism
(when was it ever otherwise amongst
his kind?) the Adviser set aside his real
work (he was, of course, writing a book
about the War) and applied himself to
the task of straightening the tangle.
Obviously the ideal combination would
be for each unit to have a code name
that nobody could mistake no matter
how badly it was pronounced. And to
this ideal he applied himself. Often,
on fine afternoons, the serenity of the
country-side was disturbed by the voice
of one crying in the wilderness, “Soap—
Silk—Salvage—Sympathy,” to see if
any dangerous similarity existed. At
dinner a glaze would suddenly come
over his eyes, his lips would move invol-
untarily and mutter, as he gazed into
vacancy, “Mustard—Mutton—Meat
—Muffin.”
Histrionic effort played no small
part in these attempts and led to a
good deal of misunderstanding, for
he felt it incumbent on him to try
his codes in every possible dialect. In-
stead of the usual cheery “Good morn-
ing,” a major of a famous Highland
regiment was scandalised by an elderly
subaltern blethering out, “Cannibal—
Custard–Claymore–Caramel,” in an
abominable Scotch accent. Another
day (on receipt of written orders) he
was compelled to visit the line to see if
things had been built as reported, or,
if it was just optimism again. Half-an-
hour later a sentry brought him down
the trench at the point of the bayonet
for muttering as he rounded the tra-
verse, “Galoot—Gunning—Grumble—
Grumpy,” in pseudo-Wessex. Naturally,
to Native Yorkshire this sounded like
pure Bosch.
Ah! but he won through in the end.
The man who has stood five years of
unsuccessful story-writing for maga-
zines is not the kind to let himself be
beaten easily. There could be no doubt
of the final result. When the revised
list was issued the response to the
inquiry, “Hullo, is that Sink?" was
met by a “No, this is Smack,” that
crashed through the thickest intellect.
But vaulting ambition had o'erleapt it-
self. As a covering note to the new issue
he had put up the following letter:-
“Ref. G. K. etc., etc., of 10th inst.
On November 3rd all previous issues of
Code Names will be cancelled in favour
of the more euphonious nomenclature
which is forwarded herewith.”
A shriek of joy echoed through the
corps. “Euphonious!” What a word!
What a discovery in a foreign country!
The joy of the signal operators, on
whom something of the spirit of the old-
time bus-drivers has descended, was
indescribable. You had only to pick up
the receiver at any time and the still
small voices of the busy signal world
could be heard chortling, “Hullo-oo?
Hullo, Euphonious! How's your father?
Yes, give me Crump.” Or, “No, I can't
get the General; he's left his euphoni-
ous receiver off.”
Poor Euphonious (he has never been
called by anything else since)—they
have threatened to make him O.C.
Recreations for Troops.

A Long-Felt Want. -
THE opening, next week, of a Training
School for Bus and TubeTravellers will,
it is hoped, supply a long-felt want in
the Metropolis. I understand that a
month's course at the establishment will
enable the feeblest of mortals to hold his
own and more in the fearful mêlée that
rages daily round train and vehicle. I
have a prospectus before me as I write;
here are some of its sub-heads: “The
Strap-Hanger's Stränglehold,” “Foot
Frightfulness,” “How to Enter a Bus
Secretly,” “The Umbrella Barrage,”
“Explosives—When their Use is Justi-
fied,” “What to do when the Con-
ductor Falls off the Bus.” This cer-
tainly promises a speedy amelioration
of present-day travelling conditions.
Timbuctoo Tosh.
Last week, when all those ridiculous
rumours anent Timbuctoo were flying
about, you will remember how I warned
you to set no faith in them. You will
admit that I was a good counsellor.
Nothing has happened at Timbuctoo.
I doubt very much whether anything
could happen there.
Hush /
On the other hand, keep your eye on
a spot not a thousand miles away from
Clubland. Something will certainly
happen there some day, and, when it
does, bear in mind that I warned you.
Amazing Discovery.
Mr. Roosevel.T's discovery that, un-
known to himself, he has been blind in
one eye for over a year, is surely sur-
passed by the experience of Mr. Carac-
tacus Crowsfeet, the popular M.P. for
Slushington, who has just learnt, as
the result of a cerebral operation, that
he possesses no brain whatever. “It
is indeed remarkable,” said Mr. C. to
me the other day, “for I can truthfully
assert that in all my arduous political
labours of the past ten years I have
never felt the need or even noticed the
absence of this organ.” He coughed
modestly. “I have always maintained
that in politics it is the man, not the
mind, that counts.”
She Has One /
Mrs. Zebulon Napthaliski proposes
to spend the winter on her Brighton
estate. “Yes—I have received my
sugar card,” she told me, in answer to
my eager query. “More than that I
cannot say.”
Fare and Foliage.
That charming fashion of decorating
the dinner-table with foliage will be
all the rage this winter. Well-known
London hostesses, basket on arm, may
daily be seen in Mayfair garnering
fallen leaves from lawn, path or road-
side. Some very daring Society women
are dispensing altogether with a cloth,
the table being covered with a complete
layer of leaves. I doubt, however,
whether this will become popular,
guests showing a tendency to mislay
their knives and forks in the foliage.
A Bon Mot.
Have you heard the latest bon mot
that is going the round of the clubs?
Mrs. Savory Beet, of Pacifist fame, has,
as you will recall, announced her inten.
tion of taking up war work. “Ah!”

audiencesimply screamed with laughter.
Watch Out 1
Don't be surprised if you hear of
some sensational political develop-
ments in the near future. The Minister
who said recently that the inevitable
sequel to war was peace, was, in the
opinion of those competent to judge
but, by reason of their official position,
unable to criticise, hinting at proposals
which, if the signs and portents of the
time go for anything, would have far-
reaching effects on the question of
Electoral Representation. I will say
no more. Time alone will disclose
my meaning.

All, all are lightly fled and surely gone;
And their survivor lingers in his pride,
The, last of all the matches in the

For Mr. Siftings says he has no more,
And Siftings is an honourable man,
And would not state a fact that was
not so.
For now he has himself to do without
The flaming boon of matches, having
none,
And cannot furnish us as he desires,
Being a grocer and the best of men,
But murmurs vaguely of a future week
When matches shall be numerous again
As leaves in Wallombrosa and as cheap.
Blinks, the tobacconist, he too is spent
With weary waiting in a matchless
land;
What Siftings cannot get cannot be got
By men like Blinks, that young tobac-
conist,
Who tried with all a patriot's fiery zeal
To join the Army, but was sent away
For varicose and too protuberant veins;
And being foiled of all his high intent
Now minds the shop and is a Volunteer,
Drilling on Sundays with the rest of
them ;
He too, amid his hoards of cigarettes,
Is void of matches as he's full of veins.
So here's a good match in a naughty
world,
And what to do with it I do not know,
Save that somehow, when all the place
is still,
It shall explode and spurt and flame
and burn
Slowly away, not having thus achieved
The lighting of a pipe or any act
Of usefulness, but having spent itself
In lonely grandeur as befits the last
Of all the varied matches I have known.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WAY DOWN.
SYDNEY SMITH, or NAPOLEON or
MARCUs AURELIUS (somebody about
that time) said that after ten days any
letter would answer itself. You see
what he meant. Left to itself your
invitation from the Duchess to lunch
next Tuesday is no longer a matter to
worry about by Wednesday morning.
You were either there or not there; it is
unnecessary to write now and say that
a previous invitation from the PRIME
MINISTER—and so on. It was NAPO-
LEON's idea (or Dr. Johnson's or MARK
ANTONY's—one of that circle) that all
correspondence can be treated in this
Inanner.
I have followed these early Masters
(or whichever one it was) to the best
of my ability. At any given moment
in the last few years there have been
ten letters that I absolutely must write,
thirty which I ought to write, and fifty
which any other person in my position
would have written. Probably I have
written two. After all, when your pro-
fession is writing, you have some excuse
on returning home in the evenings for
demanding a change of occupation. No
doubt if I were a coal-heaver by day,
my wife would see to the fire after
dinner while I wrote letters. As it is,
she does the correspondence, while I
gaze into the fire and think about
things.
You will say, no doubt, that this was
all very well before the War, but that
in the Army a little writing would be
a pleasant change after the day's duties.
Allow me to disillusion you. If, three
years ago, I ever conceived a glorious
future in which my autograph might
be of value to the more promiscuous
collectors, that conception has now
been shattered. Three years in the
Army has absolutely spoilt the market.
Even were I revered in the year
2,000 A.D. as SHAKSPEARE is revered
now, my half-million autographs, scat-
tered so lavishly on charge-sheets,
passes, chits, requisitions, indents and
applications would keep the price at
a dead level of about ten a penny. No,
I have had enough of writing in the
Army and I never want to sign my
own name again. ... “Yours sincerely,
HERBERT Asquith,” “Faithfully yours,
J. JELLICoE"—these by all means; but
not my own. -
However, I wrote a letter the other
day; it was to the bank. It informed
them that I had arrived in London for
a time and should be troubling them
again shortly, London, being to all
appearances an expensive place. It
also called attention to my new addyess
—a small furnished flat in which Celia
and I can just turn round if we do it
separately. When it was written, there
came the question of posting it. I was
all for waiting till the next morning,
but Celia explained that there was
actually a letter-box on our own floor,
twenty yards down the passage. I took
the letter along and dropped it into
the slit.
Then a wonderful thing happened.
It went
Flipperty - flipperty - flipperty - flip-
perty-flipperty-flipperty-flipperty-flip-
perty-flipperty-flipperty—FLOP.
I listened intently, hoping for more
. . . but that was all. Deeply dis-
appointed that it was over, but abso-
lutely thrilled with my discovery, I
hurried back to Celia.
“Any letters you want posted?” I
said in an off-hand way.
“No, thank you,” she said.
“Have you written any while we've
been here?”
“I don't think I've had anything to
write.”
“I think,” I said reproachfully, “it’s
quite time you wrote to your—your
bank or your mother or somebody.”
She looked at me and seemed to be
struggling for words.
“I know exactly what you're going
to say,” I said, “but don't say it; write
a little letter instead.”
“Well, as a matter of fact I must
just write a note to the laundress.”
“To the laundress,” I said. “Of
course, just a note.”
When it was written I insisted on
her coming with me to post it. With
great generosity I allowed her to place
it in the slit. A delightful thing hap-
pened. It went
Flipperty - flipperty - flipperty - flip-
perty-flipperty-flipperty-flipperty-flip-
perty flipperty flipperty—FLop. A
Right down to the letter-box in the
hall. Two flipperties a floor. (A sim-
ple calculation shows that we are
perched on the fifth floor. I am glad
now that we live so high. It must be
very dull to be on the fourth floor with
only eight flipperties, unbearable to be
on the first with only two.)
“O-oh 1 How fas-cinating !” said
Celia.
“Now don't you think you ought to
write to your mother?”
“Oh, I must.”
She wrote. We posted it. It went
Flipperty - flipperty However,
you know all about that now.
Since this great discovery of mine,
life has been a more pleasurable busi-
ness. We feel now that there are
romantic possibilities about letters set-
ting forth on their journey from our
floor. To start life with so many flip-
perties might lead to anything, Each
time that we send a letter off we listen
in a tremble of excitement for the final
FLOP, and when it comes I think we both
feel vaguely that we are still waiting
for something. We are waiting to hear
some magic letter go flipperty-flipperty-
flipperty-flipperty . . . and behold I
there is no FLOP . . . and still it goes
on—flipperty-flipperty-flipperty-flip-
perty—growing fainter in the distance
. . until it arrives at some wonderland
of its own. One day it must happen
so. For we cannot listen always for
that FLOP, and hear it always; nothing
in this world is as inevitable as that.
One day we shall look at each other
with awe in our faces and say, “But
it's still flipperting !” and from that
time forward the Hill of Campden will
be a place holy and enchanted. Per-
haps on Midsummer Eve—
At any rate I am sure that it is the
only way in which to post a letter to
Father Christmas.
Well, what I want to say is this: if I
have been a bad correspondent in the
past I am a good one now; and Celia,
who was always a good one, is a better
one. It takes at least ten letters a day
to satisfy us, and we prefer to catch
ten different posts. With the ten in
your hand together there is always a
temptation to waste them in one wild
rush of flipperties, all catching each
other up. It would be a great moment,
but I do not think we can afford it yet;
we must wait until we get even more
practised at letter-writing. And even
then I am doubtful; for it might be that,
lost in the confusion of that one wild
rush, the magic letter would start on
its way—flipperty-flipperty—to the
never-land, and we should forever have
missed it.
So, friends, acquaintances, yes, and
even strangers. I beg you now to give
me another chance. I will answer
your letters, how gladly. I still think
that NAPOLEON (or CANUTE or the
younger PLINY—one of the pre-Raph-
aelites) took a perfectly correct view of
his correspondence . . . but then he
Never had a letter-box which went

COUNTER TACTICS.
ABOUT a year ago I paid a visit to
my hosier and haberdasher with the
intention of purchasing a few things
with which to tide over the remaining
months of winter. After the prelimin-
ary discussion of atmospherics had been
got through, the usual raffle of gar-
ments was spread about for my in-
spection. I viewed it dispassionately.
Then, discarding the little vesties of
warm-blooded youth and the double-
width vestums of rheumatic old age,
I chose several commonplace woollen
affairs and was preparing to leave
when my hosier and haberdasherleaned
across the counter and whispered in
my ear.
“If I may advise you, Sir, you would
be wise to make a large selection of
these articles. We do not expect to
replace them.”
He glanced cautiously at an elderly
gentleman who was stirring up a box
of ties, then, lowering his voice another
semitone, added, “The mills are now
being used exclusively for Government
work.” He insinuated the death-sen-

seven shirts arrived and I had to bu
a new chest-of-drawers. :
This, as I have stated before, was
about a year ago. Yesterday I paid
my hosier and haberdasher another
visit. If all the bone factories had not
been too exclusively engaged, etc., etc.,
I wished to buy a collar stud. There was
an elderly man standing in the shop.
He was quite alone, contemplating a
mountain of garments. There were
little vesties, double-width vestums and
ordinary woollen affairs. -
You could have knocked me over
with a dress-sock. -
And where was my hosier and haber-
dasher?. Had the stranger—just awak-
ened to the value of his possessions—
entered the shop and suddenly cast all
this treasure upon the counter? I
imagined the shock of this procedure
on a man like my hosier and haber-
dasher, whose heart was perhaps a
trifle woolly. Had he collapsed? I
glanced surreptitiously behind a para-
pet of clocked socks.
A moment later, from somewhere
in the back premises, he appeared
carrying a large bale of flannel, which
he cast caber-wise upon the counter.
I was dumbfounded.
Then I knew the truth.
“Sir," I said, turning to the stranger,
“I believe you are about to make a
selection from these articles (I indicated
them.individually), which you imagine
to be the last of their race?”
He nodded at me in a bewildered
sort of way. - - - -
“In a few months,” I continued re-
morselessly, “they will be absolutely
unprocurable" (he gave a start of recog-
nition), “and you, having bought them,
will sneak through life with the feel-
ings of a food-hoarder, mingled with
those of the man who slew the last
Camberwell Beauty. I know the state
of mind. But you need not distress
yourself. These garments (I indicated
them again) will only be unprocurable
because they are in your possession.
I have about half-a-ton myself, which,
until a few minutes age, would have
been quite unprocurable. But I have
changed my mind and, if you will come
with me, you can take your choice
with a clear conscience, and (I glanced
maliciously at my faded hosier and
haberdasher) at the prices which were
prevalent a year ago."
I linked my arm with that of the
stranger, and together we passed out
of the shop into the unpolluted light
of day.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 19th-Such a
rush of Peers to the House of Com-
mons has seldom been seen. Lord
WIMBORNE, who knows something of
congested districts, arrived early and
secured the coveted seat over the clock.
Lord CURzoN, holding a watching brief
for the War Cabinet, was only just in
time to secure a place; and Lord
CourTNEY and several others found
“standing room only.” If we have
many more crises Sir ALFRED MoRD
will have to make provision for strap-
hangers.
There was very little sign of passion
in Mr. Asquith's measured criticism of
the Allied Council and of the PRIME
MINISTER's speech on the subject in
Paris. His foil was carefully buttoned,
and though it administered a shrewd
thrust now and again it was not in-
tended to draw blood.
At first the PRIME MINISTER followed
this excellent example, and contented
himself with defending, and incidentally
re-composing, his Paris oration. The
Allied Council, as now depicted, was a
horse of quite another colour from what
it seemed in Paris. A further example
of camouflage, I suppose.
Only when he came to deal with his
Press critics did he let himself go, to
the delight of the House, which loves
him in his swashbuckling mood. As he
confessed, however, that he had deliber-
ately made “a disagreeable speech" in
Paris in order to get it talked about,
the Press will probably consider itself
absolved.
Tuesday, November 20th.-Like John
Bull, as represented in last week's
cartoon, Lord LAMINGtoN has arrived at
the conclusion that compulsory ration-
ing must come, and the sooner the
better. Lord RHoNDDA, however, is
still hopeful that John will tighten his
own belt, and save him the trouble.
“More Yapping and Less Biting”
should be our motto. But if we fail
| to live up to it, the machinery for com-
pulsory rationing is all ready. Indeed,
according to Lord DEvoNPoRT, it has
been ready since April last, when an
“S.O.S.” to the local authorities was
on the point of being sent, but a timely
increase in imports stopped it.
Nobody doubts Commander WEDG-
wood's essential patriotism; he has
proved it like a knight of old on his
body; but he is unfortunate in some
of his political associates, who take
advantage of his good-nature. A book
with a preface by himself had been
seized by the police on suspicion of
being seditious, and he loudly demanded
to be prosecuted. But Sir GEORGE
CAve was not inclined to set up a legal
presumption that the writer of a preface
is responsible for the rest of the book.
If he were, a good many “forewords”
would, I imagine, never have been
written.
Wednesday, November 21st.—By a
strange oversight the Royal Marines
were not specifically mentioned in the
recent Vote of Thanks to the Services.
Apparently the fact that this country
is proud of them is one of those things
that must not be told to the Marines.
But Dr. MACNAMARA assured the House
that the omission should now be re-
paired.
There has been a shortage of pro-
visions in the city where Lady Godiva
suffered from a shortage of clothes.
“His foil was carefully buttoned.”
MR. ASQUITH.
Mr. CLYNEs was prompt with a remedy.
A representative of the Food - CoN-
TRoller has already been sent to
Coventry."
Conscientious Objectors found a
doughty champion in Lord HUGH
CECIL. Rarely has an unpopular case
been fortified with a greater wealth
of legal, historical and ethical argu-
ment. Only once, when he accused
Mr. BonAR LAw of holding the same
doctrine as Herr BETHMANN-Hollweg,
did he lose, for a moment, the sympathy
of his audience. But he soon recovered
himself, and thereafter held the House
rapt with Cecilian harmonies.
To such a lofty plane, indeed, had
the debate been lifted that Mr. RoNALD
McNEILL, tall as he is, had some diffi-
culty in bringing it down to earth again;
and when the division was called the
spell was still working, and in a very
big House the “Conchies” only lost
their votes by thirty-eight.
Thursday, November 22nd.—Pending
the introduction of the promised censor-
ship of Parliamentary Questions, Mr.
Joseph KING is working overtime. No
story is too fantastically impossible to
find a shelter under his hospitable hat.
To-day it was a secret treaty between
the Russian Government (old style) and
the French Republic, by which Belgium
was to be compensated at the expense
of Holland. Lord Robert CECIL de-
nounced it as an invention of the enemy.
But I don't suppose the denial had the
smallest effect upon Mr. KING, who
probably went off and dined heartily
on a magnum of mare's-nest soup.
A tremendous accession to the ranks
of the Sinn Feiners has been narrowly
averted. When Members read the menu
which, according to Major NEWMAN,
the Irish Government has adopted for
political prisoners—three good square
meals aday, including an egg, ten ounces
of meat, a pound and a half of bread,
two pints and a half of milk, and real
butter—they were strongly minded to
enlist under Mr. DE WALERA's banner
and get themselves arrested forth with.
But Mr. DUKE's emphatic denial
shattered their dream of repletion at
the taxpayers' expense.
A final attempt to get proportional
representation included in the Franchise
Bill was heavily defeated. In a dash-
ing attempt to save it Sir MARK
SYKEs declared that the old Eatans will
methods of electioneering had gone for
ever—“no mouth was large enough to
kiss thirty thousand babies.” But the
majority of the House seemed to be
more impressed by the self-sacrificing
argument of that eminent temperance
advocate, Sir THOMAs WHITTAKER, who
feared that “P.R.” would lead to an
increasein “milk-and-water politicians.”
Always Something New From Africa.
“A Belgian East African communiqué says
that before the converging advance of the
Anglo-German Belgian columns, the enemy
retired to the south bank of the Kilimbero.”
Mombasa Times.
We seem to have met some of these
Anglo-German columns in the Pacifist
Press.
“Our machines them bombed the General,
in which the German Head-quarters at Con-
stantinople are reported to be situated.”
Times.
The General must have been stout,
even for a German.
“Not having regained consciousness the
police are left with little tangible evidence to
work upon.”—Daily Telegraph,
Let us hope they will soon come to.

LE POILU DE CARCASSONNE.
THE poilus of France on the Western Front are brave as
brave can be, - -
Whether they hail from rich Provence or from ruined
Picardie; -
It's the self-same heart from the lazy Loire and the busy
banks of Seine,
Undaunted by perpetual mud or cold or gas or pain;
And all are as gay as men know how whose wealth and
friends are gone,
But the gayest of all is a little white dog that came from
Carcassonne.
He was brought as a pup by a Midi man to a sector along
the Aisne,
But his man laid the wire one pitch-black night and never
came back again.
The pup stood by with one ear down and the other a
question mark,
And at times he licked his dead friend's face and at times
he tried to bark, -
Till the listening sentry heard the sound, and when the
daylight shone
He looked abroad and cried, “Bon Guieu ! C'est le poilu
de Carcassonne / "
So the dead man's copains kept the dog on the strength of
the company,
And whoever went short it was not the pup, though a
greedy pup was he ;
They gave him their choicest bits of singe and drops of
pinard too;
He was warm and safe when he crept beneath a cloak of
horizon-blue;
They clipped fresh brisques in his rough white coat as the
weary months dragged on,
And all the sector knows him now as le Poilu de Carcas-
Sonne.
And in return he keeps their hearts from that haunting foe,
l'enmui ;
He's their plaything, friend, and sentry too, and a lover of
devilry;
He helps them to hunt out rats or Boches; he burrows and
sniffs for mines,
And he growls when the murderous shrapnel flies screaming
above the lines;
His little black nose is a-quiver with glee whenever a raid
-1S-On, -
And they say with pride, “C'est la guerre elle-même, notre
Poilu de Carcassonne / "
There was none more glad when they went to rest in their
billet, a ruined shack,
But when they returned to the front-line trench he was
just as pleased to be back;
He's the spirit of fun itself, and so when other men feel
blue,
His friends remark, “Le cafard, quoi On l'connait pas
chez mous !”
So when you drink to the valiant French and the glorious
fights they've won
Just raise your glass to a little white dog that came from
Carcassonne.

AT THE PLAY.
“LOYALTY.”
IF you are a pernickety intellectual
(soi-disant) you may really permit
yourself to be faintly amused at the
fiery zeal of the mystery-wrapt author
of Loyalty for his (or, quite possibly,
her) country's cause in this difficult
hour. If you are cast in the common
human mould that nowadays is seen
for the glorious thing it is, you will
respond to many single-minded, whole-
some thoughts in the impassioned
statement of his thesis. And if you
happen to belong to that simple dis-
credited breed, the English, so long
overshadowed by the nimbler Britons,
you may have quite a nice little private
thrill of your own, a thrill of pride in
your precious stone, and
begin to think with serious-
ness of the advantages of
“home rule all round" in
an England-for-the-Eng-
lish mood, and of the value
of a nationalism that is as
irrational as conjugal or
mother love—and as fine.
The author's hero is an
Englishman of the wander-
ing type, assistant editor
on a crank paper. The
play is a protracted debate
in four sessions, June,
1914; July, 1914; August,
1914; September, 1916.
And here the author makes
his most serious mistake,
the mistake made by Mr.
HENRY ARTHUR Jones in
his recent squib. If he
had contrived his Little
Navy folk, the proprietor, 4***
editor and revolving cranks as some-
thing more than mere caricatures,
brands of straw prepared for his consum-
ing bonfires, he would have strength-
ened, not weakened, his excellent case.
He has quoted his enemies' mistakes
without their excuses, their texts with-
out their contexts. And that is a form
of propaganda which can only touch
the converted, or such of them as are
not stirred by a sporting instinct to a
certain mood of protest and a wish that
the other fellow should be given a better
start in the heresy hunt.
The dramatis persona, then, divide
themselves into the men of straw and
the right sort. Of the former you have
first Sir Andrew Craig, chairman of
the party in his constituency and editor
of The New Standard (there were indeed
altogether new standards of efficiency,
mentality and hospitality in that rather
imaginative newspaper office of the
First Act). Mr. FISHER WHITE gave us
the courtly-obstinate old man to the life
&
a-E
W
Frank Aylett . .
(this player has a way of removing
straw). In the dramatic passage in
which, returning after being broken in
a German prison, he relates some of
the horrors of which it is good for us
to be reminded, he rose to the height
of his fine talent. His exquisite elocu-
tion—a remarkable feat of virtuosity—
was in itself a sheer delight.
Mr. Stutchbury, the editor, pacifist
and sentimental democrat, was dealt to
Mr. LENNox PAwLE. He played his
hand well. There was never such
an editor outside Bedlam ; but Mr.
PAWLE is a resourceful person and
by a score of clever tricks of gesture
and business made a reasonable figure
of fun for our obloquy. All but broken
in the end, but still claiming that he
had “the larger vision” (as he certainly

at 9 . . .
had the larger diameter), there was a
certain dignity of pathos in his exit, a
late amende by an otherwise remorseless
puppet-maker. Mr. SYDNEY PAXToN as
a pillar of Nonconformity offered a
clever study in the unctuous-grotesque;
Mr. VINCENT STERNRoyD sketched a
portrait of a nut-consuming impenitent
disarmamentist. The author is the first,
so far as I know, to give public emphasis
to the queer fact of natural history that
there is some connection between ex-
treme opinions and the prominence of
the Adam's apple of the holder of them
—a fact on which I have often pondered.
Mr. M. MoRAND, the aggressive Scots
member of the election committee,
inspired to great heights of insobriety
by the return of his London-Scottish
nephew from the Front, sounded a wel-
come human note, as did Mr. SAM
LIVESEY, the Labour Member of the
committee, shaken out of his detach-
ment into an extreme explicitness of
language by a Zeppelin raid experience.
MR. C. AUBREY SMITH,
MISS WIOLA TREE.
Mr. GEORGE BELLAMY's Welsh Disestab-
lisher and Mr. GRIFFITH HUMPHREYs'
exuberant German press-agent of the
pre-war period were both really shrewd
studies.
Of the right sort there were but
five—and one of these, the editor's
secretary, at heart an honest patriot,
but in fact eating the bread of shame,
was perhaps not altogether of the right
sort. Still he did get off his chest at
last the pent-up passion of years, and
very well he did it, with the help of
Mr. RANDLE AYRTON, whose subtle little
touches, building up a picture of a
disheartened hack, were very adroit
indeed.
Then there was young Henry Craig,
at the beginning an undergraduate in
his last term, at the end a W.C. in his last
resting-place. Mr. PER-
CIVAL CLARKE's was an
adequate pleasant study.
So also was Mr. PHILIP
ANTHONY's of a Canadian,
full of strange idioms, who
butted in to just the wrong
corner of Fleet Street to
put the editor wise about
the intentions of a Ger-
many in which he had
spent his last two years.
And then there was splen-
didly English Frank Ay-
lett, exilereturned, unspoilt
by the cynicism of party
and paper, whose fortune
came to him just at the
psychological moment, en-
abling him to give his pro-
prietor notice and fight
and win a by-election in
the astonied man's own
constituency, besides
carrying off his daughter (Miss WIOLA
TREE), who was the fifth of the right
sort. What more plausible English
hero than Mr. C. AUBREY SMITH,
except that he had to talk a good deal
more than seemed appropriate to his
type? There was a well-managed post-
election scene when he was at his best
(as was the author). And all through
there was good and sometimes glorious
sense for those to hear who had ears.
The programme promised us about
a month's interval between Acts I. and
II. It was actually less than that;
but if Mr. J. H. SQUIRE's musicianly
orchestra had not been there to charm
us we might conceivably have been
bored. T.

“DIVERSION” IN THE BALKANs.
HEROES.
If the question were put to a company
of young women, “What is the most
thrilling experience you can have in
a London street 2" the odds are a
thousand to one that they would reply
that nothing could be more thrilling
than to meet a famous actor in plain
clothes and identify him. I am not
a young woman myself, but I should
be inclined to share their opinion.
There is something about an actor in
real life, moving along like a human
being—one of us—that always stirs
my pulse. It is exciting enough to see
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE or Mr. Asquith or
Sir OLIVER Lodge; but no one stirs
the imagination like an actor.
That is why I still tremble a little
whenever I think of my good fortune
the other afternoon in the Haymarket,
and why my pen shakes as I commit
the adventure to paper. For I met
face to face two of the most success-
ful actors in London—at the present
moment, in the world.
I was walking up the Haymarket in
the rain, hoping, in spite of the new pro-
hibitive rates, that I might see an empty
cab, when I met them coming down.
They were walking with a man whom
I did not recognise, and, like me, were
getting wet. One thinks of successful
actors as riding always in taxis; but taxis
are very rare nowadays, particularly in
the wet, and somehow it did not seem
unnatural that they should be on foot.
I am glad enough that they were, or I
should have missed my frisson; and
others would have suffered a similar
loss, for the recognition was not only
on my part but on that of several
passers-by, and it was instantaneous.
Indeed, I heard one lady tell her com-
panion the name of the play they are
in and the extraordinary length of its
run, and since she spoke loudly I
thought how delightful it must be
to be a theatrical celebrity and hear
cordial things like that as you move
about. Neither of them paid any atten-
tion, however, although their friend
showed signs that the flattery had not
escaped him; the two Illustrions (to
coin a word) merely walked on, superior
to our homage, and disappeared into
Charles Street, where the stage door
of His Majesty's is.
Pouring though it was, and grovelling
admirer of footlight favourites as I am,
somehow I never thought to offer either
of them my umbrella. But then one
doesn't offer an umbrella to a donkey
or a camel, even though they are two
of the stars of Chu Chin Chow.
Another Injustice.
From a Sinn Fein speech:-
“When Ireland was silent England did not
hear her cry out.”—Wicklow News-Letter.
“WHY SHOULD A RABBIT cost 2s. 8d. 2
This question from a reader induces me to
postpone until next week my analysis of the
high cost of onions.”—Empire News.
On the principle that it is better to
make sure of the rabbit before arrang-
ing about the stuffing.
“Stockholm, Tuesday.
News from Finland shows that the Socialist
leaders have lost control of the workmen, and
all kinds of excesses are taking place. The
present Commandant at Tornea was a sailor,
the head of the passport office was a tailor,
and the chief telegraphic censor a tinker.”
- Central News.
We miss the soldier, to say nothing of
“apothecary, ploughboy, thief.”
“Scholars and tragedians between them
seem to have appropriated the right to keep
Shakespeare's memory green. But there are
other Richmonds in the field, humble Rich-
monds, not well read . . . John of Gaunt,
crying that his England “never did nor never
shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror . . .’”
The Times.
The writer who thus deprived the
Bastard in King John of his famous
lines was, we infer, one of the “other
Richmonds.”

SUGAR.
AN ELEGIAC ODE.
QUEEN of the palate | Universal Sweet I
Gastronomy's delectable Gioconda!
Since with submission loyally I greet
And follow out the regimen of RHONDDA,
I cannot be considered indiscreet
If I essay, but never go beyond, a
Brief elegiac tribute to a sway
By sterner needs now largely swept away.
Thy candy soothes the infant in its pram;
Thou addest mellowness to old brown sherry;
Thou glorifiest marmalade, on Cam
And Isis making breakfast-tables merry;
Thou lendest magic to the meanest jam
Compounded of the most insipid berry;
And canst convert the sourest crabs and quinces
To jellies fit for epicures and princes.
Thou charmest unalloyed, in loaf or lumps
Or crystals; brown and moist, or white and pounded;
I never was so deeply in the dumps
That, once thy fount of sweetness I had sounded,
Courage returned not; even with the mumps
I still could view with gratitude unbounded
The navigators of heroic Spain -
Who found the New World—and the sugar-cane.
Sprinkled on buttered bread thou dost excite
In human boys insatiable cravings;
On Turkish (I regret to say) Delight
Thou lurest them to dissipate their savings,
Instead of banking them, or sitting tight,
Or buying useful books and good engravings;
And lastly, mixed with strawberries and cream,
Thou art more than a dish, thou art a dream.
Before necessity, that knows no ruth,
Ordained thy frugal use in tea and coffee,
Some Stoics banned thee—men who in their youth
Showed an unnatural dislike of toffee;
For sweetness charms the normal human tooth,
Sweetness inspires the singer's tenderest strophe,
Since old LUCRETIUS musically chid
The curse of life—amari aliquid.
Eau sucrée, I admit, is rather tame
Compared with beer or whisky blent with soda;
But gallant Frenchmen, experts at this game,
Commend it highly either as a coda
Or prelude to their meals, and much the same
Is sherbet, which the Gaekwar of Baroda
And other Oriental satraps quaff -
In preference to ale or half-and-half.
Nor must I fail, O potent saccharin'
Thou chemic offspring of by-products coaly,
Late comer on the culinary scene,
To hail thy aid, although it may be lowly
Even compared with beet; for thou hast been
Employed in sweetening my roly-poly—
Thou whom I once regarded as a dose
And now the active rival of glucosel
But still I hear some jaundiced critic say,
Some rigid self-appointed censor morum,
“Why harp upon the pleasures of a day
When freely sweetened was each cup and jorum,
Dre stern controllers had begun to stay
The genial outflow of the fons leporum ?
Now sugar's scarce, and we must do without it,
Why let regretful fancy play about it?”
True, yet it greatly goes against the grain,
Unless one has the patience of Ulysses,
Wholly and resolutely to refrain
From dwelling on the memory ofº: blisses;
Forbidden fruits allure the strong and sane;
Joys loved but lost are what one chiefly misses;
This is my best excuse if I deplore

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT is difficult within the ordinary limits of a review in
these columns to say all that one feels or even to express
adequately one's gratitude aſter reading the two volumes
of Lord MoRLEY’s generous and delightful Recollections
(MACMILLAN). I seem to have been sitting with him in a
large and comfortable library while the great Wiscount
rolled me out his mind, now breaking out into a glowing
eulogy of GEORGE MEREDITH, Joseph CHAMBERLAIN or
LESLIE STEPHEN, or again dashing off with a few firm
and skilful strokes a portrait of John MILL or HERBERT
SPENCER, or some other intellectual giant of that nineteenth
century which Lord MoRLEY nobly defends and of which
he himself was grande decus columenque. The book is
crammed with passages that arouse and maintain pleasure
in the reader and clamour for quotation on the part of the
reviewer. “Meredith,” we are told, “who did not know
Mill in person, once spoke to me of him, with the con-
fident intuition proper to imaginative genius, as partaking
of the Spinster. Disraeli, when Mill made an early
speech in Parliament, raised his eye-glass and murmured
to a neighbour on the bench, “Ah, the Finishing Gover-
ness.’ ” Or we are introduced to SPENCER at MILL's
table: “The host said to him at dessert that Grote, who
was present, would like to hear him explain one or more
of his views about the equilibration of molecules in some
relation or other. Spencer, after an instant of good-
natured hesitation, complied with unbroken fluency for a
quarter-of-an-hour or more. Grote followed every word
intently, and in the end expressed himself as well satisfied.
Mill, as we moved off into the drawing-room, declared to
me his admiration of a wonderful piece of lucid exposition.
Fawcett, in a whisper, asked me if I understood a word
of it, for he did not. Luckily I had no time to answer.”
Or again: “Another contributor [to The Saturday Review]
was the important man who became Lord SALISBURY. He
and I were alone together in the editorial anteroom every
Tuesday morning, awaiting our commissions, but he too
had a talent for silence, and we exchanged no words, either
now or on any future occasion.” How charming a picture
is this of two shy British publicists maintaining towards
one another, against every possible discouragement, an in-
violable silence. Not even the weather could tempt them
to break it. Yet the great characteristic of this book is
the large-hearted tolerance of comment and judgment
which makes it emphatically a friendly book. As such I
commend it with all the warmth in my power.
For her new story, Missing (CoLLINs), Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD has used her knowledge, already proved elsewhere, of
two settings, the English Lakes and a Base Hospital some-
where in France. Also perhaps her knowledge of human
nature, though I like to think that there are not many elder
sisters so calculatingly callous as Bridget. The bother
about her was that she sadly wanted her attractive younger
sister to marry a sufficient establishment, not, I fear, from
wholly altruistic motives. So she was not altogether sorry
when the impecunious soldier-husband, whom Nelly had
personally preferred, was reported missing, thus leaving the
chance once again open. Then, just as her plans seemed to
be prospering, word came secretly to her that there was a
man shattered and with memory lost in a base hospital
who might possibly be the brother-in-law whom she so
emphatically didn't want. What happens upon this you

shall find out for yourself. Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, as you
will notice, has no fear of a dramatic, even melodramatic,
situation; handles it, indeed, with a skill that the most
popular might envy. Thence onwards the story, perhaps a
trifle slow in starting, gathers force. The two visits to the
camp at X (a very thin disguise for a place that no
Jºnglishman of our time will ever forget) are admirably
vivid; the last chapters especially being as moving as any-
thing that Mrs. WARD has given us, whether in her popular,
profound or propagandist manner.
Lately, Mr. E. F. BENSON seems to have been devoting
himself almost wholly to chronicling the short and simple
annals of the middle-aged. With one exception, all his
recent protagonists have been, if not exactly in the sere and
yellow, at least ripely mature. So that such a title as that
of his latest novel, An Autumn Sowing (CoLLINs), produced
in me rather a feeling of familiar expectancy than of
surprise. Also when the wrapper artist clothes a volume
with a picture of an elderly gentleman obviously giving up
been preparing to write all his days, ever since, as a boy,
he first opened the “magic casement.” A book represent-
ing so long and ardent a devotion, and written by one
whose loyalties have always been so cordially sustained
and acknowledged, could not but glow; and it is its
warmth of feeling which, to my mind, peculiarly marks
this very distinguished work. It is more than a life; it is
a “companion ” to KEATs so complete and understanding
that one can with confidence apply to it the abused word,
“definitive.” Critical essays on the poet no doubt will
continue to appear, but this is the last biographical monu-
ment likely to be raised to him.
Your enjoyment of The Head of the Family (METHUEN)
may in a measure depend upon your capacity to appreciate
William Linkhorn and the glory of his “great flaming
beard.” To me, unhappily, William was an uncouth rustic,
just that and very little else; but he possessed some mys-
terious attraction for women; so, at any rate, Mrs. HENRY
DUDENEY tells me, though she does not explain to my
T satisfaction what it was.

his years it is idle to pre-
tend that the contents

so much, I can let myself
go in praise (as how often
before) of those qualities
of insight and gently sub-
acid humour that make a
BENson novel an interlude
of pure enjoyment to the
“jaded reviewer.” In case
the indiscreet cover may
happily have been re-
moved before the volume
reaches your hands, I do
not propose to give away
the plot in any detail.

that springs in the hitherto barren heart of one Keeling,
prosperous tradesman, husband, father, mayor, public
benefactor and baronet, by reason of the too sympa-
thetic damsel who types his letters and catalogues his
library. That library shows Mr. BENsoN's genius; without
it I should hardly have been able to believe in the sub-
sequent happenings, but, given this “secret garden,” all
the tragedy is explained. I have left myself no space in
which to do justice to some admirable characterization.
Keeling's wife is worthy of a place in the author's long
gallery of woolly-witted matrons; while in Silverdale he
has given a study of clerical futility and egotism almost
savage in its detestability, a portrait at which one laughs
and shudders together. Of course the book will have, and
deserve, a huge welcome.
The union of scholarship and sympathy, enthusiasm and
eloquence, is rare; yet these qualities are to be found in
perfect harmony in the stately volume on the poets' poet
which has just been published under the style, on the
cover, Life of John Keats, and on the title-page, John Keats,
His Life and Poetry, His Friends, Critics and After-Fame
(MACMILLAN)—a volume upon which Sir SIDNEY Colvin
has been engaged ever since his retirement from the Print
Room of the British Museum, and may be said to have
been described with more delightful irony. True that
some of the Firebraces kicked over the traces and married
whom they listed, but the family as a whole was rooted
deep enough to stand shocks which would have devastated
people of less assured position. The scenes of the story
are laid in and around Lewes, a part of England dear to
Mrs. DUDENEY's heart, and of which she writes with real
comprehension and devotion.
By a self-denying ordinance Mr. Punch declines, as a
general rule, to review in these columns the work of his
Staff. But he may permit himself to announce to all
lovers of the gay humour of “A. A. M.” that Messrs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LEAVES FROM A LONDON NOTE-BOOK.
By OUR MAN ABOUT Town.
(With acknowledgments to some of our
Metropolitan penny evening papers.)
Sugar Cards.
A highly-placed official tells me that
the discovery that a number of people
move about from place to place, that
servants sometimes leave their situa-
tions, and that households are con-
sequently liable to variation in their
personnel, is due to a very smart
member of the Sugar Commission, who
will be suitably decorated. This dis.
covery, on the very eve of compulsory
rationing in other commodities, will
mean an immense saving of national
funds. Instead of billions, only a few
millions of cards will need to be
destroyed—a very useful economy.
A Great Mayfair Effort.
The Mayfair Tableaux Association
will shortly hold a Fancy Dress Exhibi-
tion of Really Beautiful War-workers.
The subjects represented will range
from CLEOPATRA to BotticFLLI's “Pri-
mavera,” and from SALOME to the
Sistine Madonna. Preliminary photo-
graphs are about to appear in the
Society Press. The particular object
of this great sacrifice in the cause of
charity has not yet been determined
upon, but will be announced in due
COurS6.
The Submarine Menace.
No significance should be attached
to recent statistics of torpedoed ships
in view of public announcements to the
effect that the submarine menace has
been practically scotched.
International Bolo. -
The British Parliamentary Branch
of the International Bolo Club indig-
nantly deny that they have received
a single pony, or any less sum, from
German sympathisers in support of
Pacifist propaganda. They generously
recognise that Germany's economical
straits are even greater than ours, and
they would not willingly, even for the
sake of a common cause, put a strain
upon the resources of their German
friends.
Mahenge.
The other day I consulted an old
friend on the Imperial Staff as to the
pronunciation of Mahenge, the scene of
our latest victory in East Africa. From
the evasive character of his reply I
gathered that my inquiry was of the
nature of an indiscretion.
The Cabinet and the
Circle.”
Several members of the Cabinet—
“Vicious
the one that doesn't meet—have in-
formed me of their conviction that, in
the event of the War lasting on into
1920, there is every prospect of estab-
lishing an elementary co-ordination be-
tween the various Government depart-
ments. Meanwhile they ask me to
correct a confusion in the public mind
by which the “Vicious Circle” is re-
garded as a synonym for themselves.
Manhood and Moral.
Every day brings me a sheaf of
correspondence in which I am asked
to give my opinion as to our prospects
of victory in the near future. I have
one formula for reply. I refer my
correspondents to a recurrent para-
graph in The Times under the heading
“News in Brief.” It runs as follows:
“At the close of play yesterday in the
billiard match of 16,000 points up,
between Inman and Stevenson, at the
Grand Hall, Leicester Square, the
scores were,” etc., etc. After all, the
deciding features in the Great World-
Struggle will be manhood and moral.
Trotsky’s Peace Overtures.
From private sources, which corro-
borate the information given to the
public, I hear that the Spanish Chargé-
d'Affaires at Petrograd is the only
member of the Diplomatic Corps in
that capital who has taken cognisance
of TRotsky's overtures (which, of
course, must be distinguished from
Tschaikowsky's). I very much doubt
if KING ALFoNso had a hand in this,
though he has more than once inti-
mated to me his desire for peace.
Lansdowne and Lenin.
What with the aircraft strike at
Coventry and the activities of Lord
LANSDownE, LENIN and others, this has
been a great week for Pacifists and Pro-
Bosches. In Germany, where the Press
has eagerly followed The Daily Tele-
graph in giving prominence to Lord
LANSDown E's views, it is felt that our
Ex-Foreign SECRETARY ought to receive
a step in the peerage, with the title
Duke of Lansdowne and Handsup.
The Premier Abroad.
In conversation with Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE on the occasion of one of his
flying visits to England, I learned how
much he regretted that pressure of
time prevented him while in Italy from
running over to Venice and ascending
the restored Campanile. While in re-
sidence in Paris, however, he had had
the pleasure of renewing his acquaint-
ance with the Eiffel Tower.
Browning and Swinburne.
During the dark hour of trial through
which Italy has been passing, my
thcughts have often strayed to Asolo in
the Trevisan, the scene of Pippa Passes,
by the late RoberT BRowNING (whom
I knew well). “Italy, what of the
night 2" wrote my old friend Sw1N-
BURNE. “Morning's at seven "replies
Pippa. Those brave words have heart-
ened me a good deal. O. S.

remote progenitor—whether Danish, Flemish,
or British through the old English Turnspit—
the writer will nºt stay to argue.]
My faithful Peter, mount upon my knee,
And shame me with the patience of

And dealing little in true-minted coin
Tender the baser kind.
For instance, Smith (till lately Grün-

Who meets you with your mistress
all alone,
And growls a “German beast !" with
senseless scorn -
In a (still) guttural tone.
And Jones, who owes his mansion to
the War -
And loves to drown great luncheons
in champagne,
But who, to prove he loves his England
more,
Strikes at you with his cane.
The while Miss Podsnap, who in dogs
can brook
No name that smacks of Teuton,
snatches up,
Lest you contaminate it with a look,
Her Pomeranian pup.
Forgive them, Petel We are not all
well-bred,
Not all so wise, so sensible as you;
Not all our sires, for generations dead,
To British homes were true.
Yet, prizing steadfast love and fealty,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MILLIE AND THE “KAYSER.”
Millie is a “daily help.” Who it
is that she helps—whether herself or
her employer—I am not in a position
to say, for I am only temporarily a
lodger in the house where Millie helps,
and she doesn't help me much. But
to-day I have made her hear and under-
stand one whole sentence. It is the
first time during the six days that we
have known each other that I have
conveyed anything to her except by
graphic gesticulation and grimace.
I accepted the fact at the outset that
my soft and seductive tones could never
penetrate Millie's stone-deafness. Only
the loudest and angriest remarks are
audible to Millie, so I preserve an atti-
tude of silent facial amiability in all
stature and round-backed, who showed
her fifty-odd years unflinchingly to the
world; Millie with her felt slippers and
her overall and coarse hands; Millie,
the possessor of a sugar-card—and the
mighty War Lord, stern and implacable,
trying to subdue the world to his will.
And Millie only wished she could get
near him to smash him up—“the
KAYSER would come short off.” . . .
::: ::: ::: x: :
The lamp-lit cottage room faded; the
sound of November winds and swirling
leaves outside died away. For a
moment I peered through a greyish-
blue moving mist—it might have been
cigarette smoke; gradually I distin-
guished forms and colours beyond;
then the fog lifted and I looked upon
-
an electrically-lighted room, with the
into him; the rest of the company were
unknown to me. They were all engaged
in a heated discussion when suddenly
there came a knock at the door, a knock
which, to me, was curiously familiar.
During the silence that ensued Millie
walked into the room. She was still
wearing her overall and felt slippers,
and she had not waited to put on a hat
or even to straighten her hair. She
came forward unhesitatingly, with her
short, shuffling steps and, disregarding
the furious demand of a Bavarian
General as to who she was and how she
dared to enter there, she addressed
herself to the KAISER himself. She
spoke in her normal tones, but to me
there seemed something sinister about
them at this moment, and I noticed
that in her right hand she carried a
my relations with her.
BALAAM could not
have looked more sur-
prised than did Millie
this evening when, in
the act of clearing away
my latest meal, she
heard me say, “Leave
the matches.”
She stopped dead and
looked at me over the
tray of dirty crockery.
Her expression was not
unfriendly.
“But I got tº look
after myself,” she ex-
plained; “I'd be all
done up if I hadn't they
matches in the morn-
ing to light the fire and
all. You wouldn't get
no bath-water.”

said obstinately.

coal-hammer.
Now above all things
|Millie hated breaking
coal and filling scuttles,
and I knew that she
would not be carrying
a coal-hammer without
a very special reason.
Her words revealed it.
“You, KAYSER, I've
been wanting to get
near you and smash
you up, I have. You've
gone a bit too far, you
have. ... No sugar with-
out a card, and then
only half-a-pound, and
they do say it'll only
be a quarter soon. And
matches l—only one box
at a time, and they don't
strike, and how 's a
body to light a fire at
all 2 ''
She kept her hand over the box of
matches. She had not heard. I made
intelligent signs illustrative of the
lighting of a cigarette. Millie told me,
in pure Cornish:-
“You can only get a box at a time
now, and half-a-pound o' sugar I gets
when I shows my card, and they do say
we won't get that—only quarter soon.
I'd like to get at that KAYSER! I'd
smash him up, I would !” She said
this in the kindest, most benign way,
with a smile as nearly caressing as a
smile without front teeth can be.
“He’d come short off if I got to him
And he deserves it, I’m sure,” she
concluded, as she departed—with the
matches . . .
A long walk over the Cornish cliffs
in the gusty North wind from the
Atlantic had made me drowsy, and
as I sat before the fire my thoughts
wandered from Russian politics and
the Italian situation to Millie—and the
“KAYSER": Millie, who was short of
aspect of an office de lure. There were
telephones and file cases, typewriters
and all the appurtenances of business
operations; the furniture was massive
and handsome, and carpets and hang-
ings had every appearance of magnifi-
cence and costliness.
I knew without thought that this
was the private room of WILHELM of
Prussia. He himself, standing with
his back to the roaring log fire in the
deep grate, was too like the cartoons in
the English papers to be mistaken.
The iron-grey hair and upturned mous-
tache, the cold eyes and sardonic mouth
were all there “as per invoice.” He
was even wearing an aggressively
Prussian uniform, and kept his spiked
helmet on his head and his sword
hanging at his side.
The CRowN PRINCE was in evidence,
disguised as a Death's Head Hussar,
and HINDENBURG was easily recognis-
able as he bristled with the nails which
the admiring populace had hammered
With this she lifted her coal-hammer
and brought it down with all her force
on the KAISER's head. Involuntarily
I flinched; it was a terrible blow.
Several Generals, their iron crosses
jingling, rushed forward and seized
Millie, uttering guttural sounds of
horror and indignation. But the KAISER
stood unmoved—yes, unmoved. Millie
gaped at him. He ordered his satellites
to release her and, as they reluctantly
did so, Millie nodded her head at them.
“You leave me where I’m to ! He
can take up his own part,” she told
them.
The KAISER addressed her sternly.
“Presumptuous woman,” he said,
“it is not written that you shall be the
cause of my death. There is some-
thing much higher in store for me. You
deserve worse than death at my hands;
but since you are from England I will
squeeze from you all the information I
require and bend you to my uses.”
All this was obviously wasted on

PUNCH, OR THE
Millie, who heard nothing. Having
waited politely until his lips stopped
moving in speech, she again cracked
him on the head with the coal-hammer.
The KAISER ignored this uncivil re-
tort and spoke again.
“You shall go back to your match-
less country and tell them there that
we have plenty of matches in Germany;
that we have kept on good terms with
Stockholm, and our matches are made
in Sweden. We have all we need to
kindle every fire in hell. Now are you
convinced that you are beaten ?”
He was interrupted by another blow
from the coal-hammer, which made
him bite his tongue, for Millie was
becoming exasperated and put all her
strength into the stroke. The KAISER
stepped back.
“Poor fool! You are wasting your
strength, even as HAIG wastes his in
blow after blow on the Western front.”
But even as he uttered the lying
boast he tottered and fell back uncon-
scious into the arms of LITTLE WILLIE.
The Generals and Statesmen gathered
round their stricken master, gabbling
purest Prussian.
Millie appeared satisfied at last,
although the CRowN PRINCE had
scarcely glanced at her, for she was not
his type. She took advantage of the
commotion to procure two boxes of
matches which had been thrown
carelessly on the table. These she
bestowed mysteriously beneath her
overall.
“He deserved it too!” she muttered
contentedly as she hobbled to the door;
“and I don't believe so much about all
his matches either. You can only get
two boxes at a time even here.” With
this reflection she unostentatiously
departed.

Again that familiar knock. . . .
I was back in my little sitting-room
in Cornwall and Millie entered with my
candle, which she put down on the table
rather noisily. I gave her the usual
grin and nod of acknowledgment, and
she wished me good-night and went.
In the tray of the candlestick there
was a box of matches. I picked it up
and turned it over curiously. Could
my dream have been true? Or was it
only a coincidence that in blatant red
letters on that match-box were the
words:— -

BLIND folk see the fairies,
Oh, better far than we,
Who miss the shining of their wings
Because our eyes are filled with things
We do not wish to see.
They need not seek enchantment
From solemn printed books,
For all about them as they go
The fairies flutter to and fro
With smiling, friendly looks.
Deaf folk hear the fairies
However soft their song:
'Tis we who lose the honey sound
Amid the clamour all around
That beats the whole day long.
But they with gentle faces
Sit quietly apart;
What room have they for sorrowing
While fairy minstrels sit and sing
Close to their listening heart?

TO MY BUTCHER.
O BUTcHER, butcher of the bulbous eye,
That in hoarse accents bidst me “buy, buy, buy "
Waving large hands suffused with brutish gore,
Have I not found thee evil to the core?
The greedy grocer grinds the face of me,
The baker trades on my necessity,
And from the milkman have I no surcease,
But thou art Plunder's perfect masterpiece.
These others are not always lost to shame;
My grocer, now—last week he let me claim
A pound of syrup—'twas a kindly deed
To help a fellow-townsman in his need,
Though harsh the price, and I was feign to crawl
About his feet ere I might buy at all. -
But thou—although a myriad flocks may crop
By Sussex gorse or Cheviot's grassy top,
A myriad herds tumultuously snort
From Palos Verdes eastward to Del Norte,
Or where the fierce vaquero's bold bravado
Resounds about the Llano Estacado;
Though every abattoir works overtime
And every stall in Smithfield groans with prime
Cuts, from thy lips the ready lie falls pat, -
How thou art sold clean out of this and that,
But will oblige me, just for old time's sake,
With half a shin bone or some hard flank steak;
Or (if with mutton I prefer to deck
My festive board) the scraggy end of neck.
And once, when goaded to a desperate stand,
I wrung a sirloin from thy grudging hand,
Did not thy boy, a cheeky little brute
With shifty eyes, mislay the thing en route,
Depositing at my address the bones
Intended for the dog of Mr. Jones?
I sometimes think that never runs so thin
The milk as when it leaves the milkman's tin;
That every link the sausageman prepares.
Hal bours some wandering Towser unawares.
And Binns, the baker (whom a murrain seize!),
Immune from fraud's accustomed penalties,
Sells me a stuff compound of string and lead,
And has the nerve to name the substance bread.
But deaſer far to the voice of conscience grown
The type that cuts me off a pound of bone
Wherefrom an ounce of fat forlornly drops,
And calls the thing two shillings' worth of clio, s:
More steeped in crime the heart that dares to 'cece
My purse of eighteen-pence for one small piece
Of tripe, whereof, when times were not so hard,
The price was fourpence for the running yard'
Wherefore I hate thee, butcher, and would p. ss
Untempted of thy viands. But, alas !
The spirit that essays in master flights
To sip the honey from Parnassus' heights,
That daily doth his Pegasus bestride
And keeps the War from spoiling on the side,
Fails to be fostered by the sensuous sprout
Or with horse carrots blow its waistcoat out.
So, though I loathe thee, butcher, I must buy
The tokens of thy heartless usury.
Yet oft I dream that in some life to come,
Where no sharp pangs assail the poet's tum,
Athwart high sunburnt plains I drive my plough,
Untouched by earth's gross appetites, and thou,
My ox, my beast, goest groaning at the tugs,
And do I spare thy feelings? No, by jugs!
With tireless lash I probe thy leaden feet,
And beat and beat and beat and beat and beat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 26th.-Rather a
jolly day in the House of Commons.
It was pleasant to hear Lord WolMER,
ingenuous youth, explaining, on behalf
of the War Trade Department, that
there was no danger of an unusually
large consignment of rubber bathing-
caps finding their way from Switzerland
to the heads of German Fraúleins. To
Colonel YATE belongs the credit of
pointing out that people do not bathe
in Switzerland in the winter.
Where Russia is concerned Mr. BAL-
Four declines to be included among
the prophets; all he knows is that that
unhappy country has not yet evolved
a Government with which he can ne-
gotiate. He was more explicit regard-
ing the German tale of a Privy Council
in 1913, presided over by the KING, at
which Mr. Asquith and Lord KITCH-
ENER conspired with Sir Edward GREY
and Lord MoRLEy (whose “Reminis-
cences” are strangely silent on the
subject) to declare war upon Germany.
Who after this shall dare to say that the
Germans have no imagination ?
Mr. WILL THoRNE considers that
compulsory rationing ought to be post-
poned until the menus at the hotels
and clubs are cut down to two courses.
Somebody ought to invite Mr. THORNE,
who from his appearance I should judge
to have a healthy appetite, to partake of
one of these (alleged) Gargantuan feasts
and see what he thinks of it. His com-
ment would probably be, “Can't we go
and have a steak somewhere?”
When is a leaflet not a leaflet 2
“When it is an election address,” says
Sir GEORGE CAve. At the same time
he warned Mr. KING that if he thought
to get round the new regulations by
embodying his peculiar views in the
form of electioneering literature
he might still collide with “Dora.”
The warning was surely super-
fluous. The last thing any Paci-
fist M.P. wishes to do is to
submit himself to the judgment
of his constituents.
Tuesday, November 27th.-Mr.
MAC PHER so N’s statement that
officers with the Expeditionary
Force are supplied with whisky
at prices varying from 3s.6d. to
6s. a bottle may have horrified
the teetotalers, but has intensified
the patriotic desire of some of
our Volunteers to share the hard-
ships of these gallant fellows in
the trenches.
There was another long-drawn-
out duel between Mr. HoustoN
and Sir LEO CHIozzA MoREY on
the subject of shipping freights.
The House always enjoys these
encounters, although the opponents,
like the toy “wrestlers” of our youth,
never get much “forrader.” The
Member for West Toxteth has probably
forgotten more about the shipping trade
than his opponent ever knew. But for
“Can't we go and have a steak somewhere?”
MR. WILL THORNE.
all that Sir LEo keeps his end up,
though his assertion that the consumer
would not benefit if the Government
charged “Blue-book rates” for ordinary
cargo does not convince everybody.
But then everybody does not understand
Blue-books.
Wednesday, November 28th.-The
Peers were surprised to hear from
“Sir Leo keeps his end up.”
MR. HOUSTON.
SIR LEO CHIOzzA MONEY.
Lord Court.NEY that he was not of
the creed of the conscientious objector.
They had been under the impression
that his public career had been one
long orgie of conscientious objection
to everything that did not emanate
from his own capacious brain. Even
his hat and his waistcoat proclaim his
defiance of conventional opinion.
For weeks past the House of Com-
mons has been invited to believe that
German “pill-boxes” were composed
of British cement; and the case seemed
clear when a British officer wrote from
Flanders the other day that he had
discovered in the German lines a label
plainly marked “Artificial Portland.”
Members were relieved to learn that
the label came from a Belgian factory
taken over by the Germans. “If those
pill-boxes had really been made of our
cement,” said a Medway representa-
tive, “we should be hammering at
them still.”
Thursday, November 29th.-Question-
time would be much more amusing if
Ministers and Members were more ac-
complished in the art of repartee. A
few are quick enough. When Mr.
LEEs SMITH complained that one of his
statements had been described by the
Foreign SECRETARY as a mare's nest
Lord RoberT CEC.L swiftly replied that
he did not remember the incident, but
had no doubt that if his right hon.
friend used the term it was justified.
Under the Redistribution scheme as
arranged by the Boundary Commis-
sioners the name West Birmingham
would have disappeared from the roll
of constituencies. In graceful tribute
to the memory of Joseph CHAMBERLAIN
the House unanimously agreed to its
reinstatement. It also changed the
name of the Woodstock division to the
Banbury division; but the idea that
this was done as a compliment
to the junior Member for the
City of London is, I am told,
erroneous.
“In such a Questionable
Shape.”
“This, of course, brings up the
almighty question—Who wrote Shape-
speare?”—Mr. George Moore in “The
Observer.” -
A short answer to this almighty
question is—Either Mr. GEORGE
MooRE or the writer who de-
termined “to call a spade a
spape.” -

ALTHough he had been rendered ab-
solutely dumb by shell-shock the soldier
was able to earn a little extra money
by doing odd jobs. But nothing could
get his speech back. It was a very stub-
born and perplexing case. For eighteen
months he had not succeeded in uttering
a word, though understanding every-
thing that was said to him. All the
| usual devices had failed; every kind of
sudden surprise to startle him into
articulation had been attempted; elec-
tricity had been passed through the
muscles of the tongue and larynx;
doctors had discussed him with a volu-
bility only equalled by his own silence.
But he remained dumb. It seemed
hopeless.
Last week the mistress of the house
where he was mostly employed sent
him to the grocer's with, as usual, a
slip of paper. The paper was addressed
to the grocer, and it said, “Please do
your utmost to give the bearer some
sugar and tea. Even the smallest
quantity will be gratefully welcomed.”
Entering the shop the soldier laid
the message on the counter, prepared
to wait patiently for the harassed
tradesman to attend to him. He had
often been there before and knew what
it meant; but on this occasion the
grocer instantly advanced to meet him,
took the paper smilingly and read it.
“Certainly,” he replied. “I suppose
four pounds of each would be enough
to go on with ?”
“Four pounds!” said the soldier.

Old hand (supplying desired information to new arrival). “THose THINGs UP THERE.2 OH, THEY'RE CANTEENS For THE R.F.C.”
THE HUT.
As ordered, we marched the Battery
to B 35d 45.25. Reader, have you ever
lived in, or on, an unfurnished map-
reference in Flanders ? If not, permit
me to inform you that this group of
letters and numerals represented a mud-
flat pocked with ancient shell-craters,
through which loafed an unwholesome
stream under abilious-looking sky. The
Junior Subaltern, fresh from home,
asked where the billets were. We could
but bless his happy innocence and re-
mind him that as Army Field Artillery
we were nobody's children, the orphan
bravoes of the Western Front, and that
for us a bunch of map co-ordinates was
considered ample provision.
The horses, having with proper pride
sneered at the stream, were silenced
with their nosebags, and then we asked
our cook what about it? That daunt-
lessartistin bully-beef promptly brought
our far-travelled mess-table into action
in the open, and thus publicly we sat
round it on our valises and drank Vichy
water until the novelty palled. Then
the rain began and the men once more
united in wishing themselves in Ten-
neSSee.
The Captain was now driven from the
bosom of the mess to find a Camp
Commandant, and to tell him, with the
Major's compliments, that even the
personnel of Army Brigades were liable,
in the words of the book, to deteriorate
rapidly if unprotected from damp. The
officer, whom he found lurking in a
neighbouring Nissen hut, was tall and limbered cart, some smoke shell and
stately, but admitted, under pressure, the total establishment of billhooks, and
that to him was entrusted the steward- forbidden to return without sufficient
ship of our mud-flat and the adjacent
camps, and that he could give us a
mess. Through the insistent drizzle
this person, smiling now very pleasantly,
led us to a depressed wooden building
that suggested a derelict Noah's Ark
with a sinister look about the windows.
The bad-tempered sky scowled between
the planks of the roof; the querulous
wind whined up through the floor; rats
backed snarling into the corners on our
entrance.
“This is the place,” said the C.C.
“You 'll soon make yourselves very
comfortable.”
That night I dreamed I was a “U”
boat, and started up, snorting, to find
myself under a cascade, while the felt
upon the roof banged and rasped and
flapped. It sounded as if the ark were
trying to fly, but found its wings rusty.
At dawn we sent the Captain out, and
refused him breakfast till by some re-
source of ingenuity or crime he obtained
certain sausages of new felt. These
our fearless batmen unrolled and nailed
upon the roof. After his porridge we
pushed him out again with a strong
party under orders to carry the nearest
R.E. dump by force or fraud, and secure
large quantities of timber, nails, canvas
and, if possible (the up-to-date R.E.
dump secretes many unexpected com-
modities), Turkey carpets, wall-paper,
sofa-cushions and bedroom-slippers.
material for bedsteads, window-shutters,
bookshelves and chairs. By evening
the place began to feel habitable, and
the C.C., when he looked in to borrow a
horse, endeared himself to us all by his
obvious pleasure in our comparative
comfort. We lent him the best horse
in the battery.
The Major's batman devoted the
following day to the construction of a
species of retiring-room at one end of
the hut, wherein the modest members
of the mess might bathe and splash at
ease. The remainder of the servants
went out armed and returned with
(1) a zinc bath, (2) a stove, (3) a cuckoo
clock, (4) a large mirror, (5) a warming-
pan. “Once let us make a home for
ourselves,” we said, “and our energies
will be free to finish the War.” We
devoted every cunning worker in the
battery to this great end. Drill was
abandoned, stables forgotten. We in-
stalled bookshelves, bootjacks, a side-
board, hat racks, a dumb waiter, a
stand for the gramophone and a roll-
top desk for the Major. The walls were
tapestried with canvas, hung with pic-
tures, scalps, and the various decora-
tions won by members of the mess.
The original building, disreputable and
hateful, was hidden and forgotten.
And then the C.C. called again, and,
after a minute and admiring inspection
of our abode, informed us that to his

That night, as I walked about in the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO HELP OUR OTHER ARMY.
With all eyes so focussed on the great deeds of our
men in France, in Palestine and on the sea, there is a
possibility of losing sight now and then cf the constant
and devoted efforts of the women and girls at home,
without whose co-operation the War could not be success-
fully waged at all. We are the debtors not only of the
munition workers who, in their hundreds of thousands,
are toiling for victory, but of women and girls in myriad
other employments, which they have cheerfully attacked
and mastered ; and any little thing that we can do for
them should, Mr. Punch holds, be done. A practical
and very simple way of adding to their happiness and
well-being is to contribute a mite to the funds of the Girls'
Friendly Society, an organisation with the finest traditions,
which is doing its best to build rest and recreation huts
all over England, for the purpose of conserving the health

MY AUNT MATILDA.
“It's too bad,” said Francesca, “it really is. It'll spoil
Christmas.”
“The question is,” I said, “that this House do accept my
Aunt Matilda's invitation of herself to stay in it for an
º period at or about Christmas. I think the Ayes
ave it.”
“The Noes have it,” shouted Francesca.
“Francesca,” I said, “it’s no use struggling, and you
know it. We've got to have Aunt Matilda, and there's an
end of it.” - - . . .
“There isn't an end of it at all. It's only just begin-
ning, and it'll go on getting worse and worse.” -
“You do not seem to realise,” I said, “what the posses-
sion of an aunt like Aunt Matilda means. She is like all
the aunts you've ever read about in novels, only more so.
She's so true to type that you can hardly believe in her
existence. To be related to her is to have a Stake in the
Country and to be part of the British Constitution, which
she ardently believes in without knowing anything about it.
She's been a widow for fifteen years, and 1 p.
“Poor old thing,” said Francesca, “so she has.”
“— for fifteen solitary years she has battled against the
world, and managed her business affairs extraordinarily
well; and yet she believes that women are perfect fools,
and pities them from the bottom of her heart for being
women.” - -
“As far as I'm concerned,” said Francesca, “she may
pity all the other women if she'll only not pity me. If I
have a headache she not only pities me, but despises me
as a weakling utterly unfitted to manage a household. No,
my dear, I can't face it. Your Aunt Matilda's too much
for me.”
“I admit,” I said, “that she's a good deal.”
“And of course she'll bring her maid.”
“And her pug.”
“Whose name is ‘MacLachlan,' and you mustn't call him
‘Mac’ because it's disrespectful.”
“And the children won't be allowed to shout about the
house when she takes her nap. And of course they will
shout about the house, and then there'll be trouble.”
“And the children will be compared with other children
who are much better behaved.”
h “It's a queer thing, but the children don't seem to mind
er.”
“She bribes them with chocolates.”
“Well, she won't do it any more, because there are no
chocolates in the world. Chocolates are a luxury.”
“So 's your aunt,” said Francesca. “She's the biggest
luxury I ever heard of. She's rare—I might almost say
unique. She's expensive, and she can be done without.
Obviously she's forbidden by the Defence of the Realm Act.
We shall be fined and imprisoned if we conceal her here.”
“Well, you'd better sit down and tell her so, and get
it off your chest.”
“I suppose I must play the humbug.”
“Yes, do. She'll see through you all right, though.”
“Oh, I say,” said Francesca, “there's a P.S. to her
letter. She says she's saved two pounds out of her sugar
ration, and she's sending it to us as a Christmas present.
Isn't she an old topper?”
“Yes,” I said, “I forgive her everything. Is two pounds
a lot 2 ''
“It's generally supposed to be just two pounds,” said
Francesca. - C. L.
THE VENGEANCE.
INEveR liked the man at Number Nine,
But now my breast is bursting with its wrongs,
For when we had a few old friends to dine
And crowned our feasting with some gentle songs,
Instead of simply drinking in the glamour,
The charm of it, he had the cheek to hammer
The party-wall with pokers and with tongs.
Ah, me! that Art should suffer such disdainl
But what can one expect in time of war?
Mayhap our minstre’sy had given pain
To some tired patriot in bed next-door—
Some weary soul that all day fashions fuses,
To whom his sleep is more than all the Muses—
And so, for England's sake we sang no more.
No longer now the hideous truth is hid:
The man is nothing but a Pacifist;
And, what is worse, he draws four hundred quid
For representing views which don't exist,
Although in Parliament, without his poker,
I'm glad to see they would not hear the croaker,
But when he talked they only howled and hissed.
And now all Hammersmith with zeal prepares
To make a night of it when next we sing;
We shall not waste our soft romantic airs,
But the glad street with warlike strains shall ring
Of blood and armaments and Fritz's whacking,
And he shall hammer till the walls are cracking,
And the whole suburb joins us in “The King.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
At this date “The Junior Sub” fortunately needs no
introduction to a public that has long gathered him and
his to its appreciative heart. I should not like to guess
how many people read and enjoyed The First Hundred
Thousand; they all, and more, will delight in the appear-
ance of Carrying On (BLACKwooD), in which the exploits
of the famous regiment, of Major Wagstaffe and Captain
Bobby Little and the rest of them are continued. What
the precise war position of IAN HAY may be by now I am
unaware, but I should emphatically suggest his appoint-
ment to the post of Official Cheerer-Up. Perhaps (how
shall I put it?) the eye-pieces of the writer's mask are
a trifle too rose-coloured for strict realism; great-hearted
gentlemen as we know our heroes to be, are they always
quite so merry and bright as here? One can but hope so.
In any case, as special propaganda on the part of the
O.C.U., the stories could hardly be bettered. One, called
“The Push that Failed,” I would order to be read aloud to
the workers in every munition factory in the land; its
heartening tale of how the British people had, to the
paralysed astonishment of Brother Bosch, “delivered the
goods” to such effect that his projected spectacular attack
under the eyes of WILLIAM the Worst was smashed before
it began, is of a kind to strengthen the most weary arm."
| While I was yet upon the final page the bells in a famous
abbey tower close by broke into grateful clamour for the
news of victory. But IAN HAY does not wait on victory;
he has his joy-bells ringing always in our hearts.
The Tree of Heaven (CAsseſ.I.) spread its friendly branches
over a pleasant corner of a roomy Hampstead garden.
Matter-of-fact Anthony, the timber merchant, always would
insist that it was a mere common ash; but the others,
Frances, and the children, Dorothy, Michael, Nicky and
adopted Veronica, knew better, as also, no doubt, did
Jane-Pussy and her little son, Jerry, who was Nicky's most
especial pal. Miss MAY SINCLAIR, without being a con-
scienceless sentimentalist, does us the fine service of re-
minding us that the world of men is not all drab ugliness,
but that there are beautiful human relationships and un-
selfish characters, and wholesome training which justifies
itself in the day of trial. She divides her charming
chronicle into three parts—Peace, The Vortex, and Victory.
The first deals with the childhood of the happy brood of
Anthony and Frances, delicate studies subtly differentiated.
Even the little cats have their astonishing individuality,
and I don't envy anyone who can read of Jerry's death
and Nicky's grief without a gulp. The Vortex is—no, not
the War; that comes later—but the trials of a world which
tests adolescence, a world of suffrage rebellions, of Futuristic
art and morals. Then the real vortex of the War, the
Victory which means ready (or difficult, unready) sacrifice
and death for the boys and their friends and as great a
sacrifice and as cruel a thing as death for the others, the
women and the elders . . . A novel, which is much
more than a novel, packed with beauty and sincerity,
setting forth its tragedy without false glamour or shallow
consolations.
Since it is natural to expect that a much-heralded book
will fail, when it does eventually appear, to fulfil the promise
of its publishers, it is the more pleasant to find oneself
agreeing with Messrs. Hodder AND Stoughton that bash-
fulness on their part would have been out of place in regard
to Mr. JAMEs W. GERARD's memoirs, My Four Years in

Germany. As read in their completed and collected form
these papers are not only, as one could foresee, of historic
importance, but they are moreover capital reading. There
is a world of unaffected geniality and humour about them
that forms a most admirable complement to such serious
matters as the protracted negotiations over the U-boat cam-
paign, or the now famous incriminating telegram addressed
by the ALL-HIGHEST to President WILSON in the days before
the Huns had quite decided with what lies to defend the
indefensible. This document is reproduced in facsimile as
the egregious sender of telegrams wrote it for Mr. GERARD
to transmit, and is one link more in the thrice-forged chain
of evidence. But even stronger witness to German guilt is
to be found in the series of minor corroborations appearing
incidentally in the course of Mr. GERARD's narrative, whether
the author is pretending to be in awe of Prussian Court
Etiquette, or openly laughing at the Orders of the Many
Coloured Eagles, or simply detailing his work at Ruhleben
and the other prison camps. His devotion there has earned
a gratitude throughout [.. ...T -

intrusion of Itichard Pinckncy into the glorious muddle of
her Irish ménage, and irritates him so successfully that he
returns in a considerable tantrum to America, leaving her
with some friends in Dublin. So far the tale is lively enough,
but not until Phyl feels the call of her blood and goes to
stay with her relatives in Charleston does the author find
scope for his peculiar charm. Then we get a most delight-
ful picture of a starlit garden in the south of America,
where Phyl's experiences, without placing a tiresome strain
upon our powers of belief, produce a sensation at once
romantic and unusual. Memories of the past hang over
this garden, and although Mr. STACPoolE's attempt to
reconcile the period of which he writes with the years that
are gone is not uniformly successful I am cordially glad
that he made it.

The publishers of Mrs. ALICE PERRIN's new volume, Tales
that are Told (SKEFFINGTON), appear to be anxious that the
public should have no hesitations on the score of measure
supplied, as they explain that the chief of the tales is “a
short novel of over 20,000 words.” I am content to take
their word for the figure, but I agree that they were well
advised to focus attention upon “Gift of God,” which, what-
ever, its length, is an admirable and distinguished piece of
writing. The subject of it is the old question of mixed-
marriage, but treated from a new aspect. Kudah Bua (the
Gift in question) is the son of an adoring Mohamedan father;
he goes to England for education in the law, and there falls
in love with and marries the brainless daughter of a London
landlady. He is a very human and appealing figure. The
débâcle that follows his return to India with so impossible
a bride is told in a way that convinces. Here Mrs. PERRIN
is at her best. Some of the shorter tales also succeed very
happily in conveying that peculiar Simla-by-South-Kensing-
ton atmosphere of retired Anglo-Indian society which she
suggests with such intimate understanding. But, to be
honest, the others (with the exception of one quaint little
comedy of a canine ghost) are but indifferent stuff, too full
of snakes and hidden treasure and general tawdriness—the
kind of Orientalism, in fact, that one used to associate chiefly
with the Earl's Court Exhibition. Mrs. PERRIN must not

mingle her genuine native goods with such Brummagem
— ware.
My idea is that when
Mr. H. C. BAILEY called
his latest story The
Young Lovers (ME-
THUEN) he was doing
it something less than
justice. For the width
and variety of the plot
make it far more than a
mere love-tale. Arma
virique are quite as
* much Mr. BAILEY’s
theme as Cupid, who
indeed makes a rather
belated appearance at
the tag end. Before
that we have a vast
| deal of agreeable ad-
| venturing. The scene
is set in the period of
the Peninsular War; all
the characters, lovers,
parents and hangers-
- - on, are more or less
involved in the fluctuating fortunes of my Lord WELLINGTON.
There are spies of both sides, intrigues, abductions and what
not. Mr. BAILEY has a pretty touch for such matters; his
people move with an air; and, if at times their speech seems
a trifle over-burnished, dulness is far from them. More-
over, the incidents of the campaign give scope for some
vivid descriptions of war and battles, as such were in the old
days before Mars put off his gold lace and sacrificed the
picturesque. Sometimes, on the other hand, it is the simi-
larity of conditions then and now that will strike you. For
example, the passage telling how, despite apparent inactivity
and home prognostications of stalemate, the conſidence of
the Army grew from day to day—impossible not to see the
very obvious parallel there. In fine, Mr. BAILEY has given
us another brisk and engaging romance, which, if it is not
quite the kind you might expect from its title, is something
"a good deal better worth reading.

EACH to his taste: if you prefer
The KAISER's whip across your flanks;
If you enjoy the bloody spur
That rips your cannon-fodder's ranks;
If to his boots you still adhere,
Kissing 'em as you've always kissed 'em,
Why, who are we to interfere
With your internal Teuton system 2
If from your bonds you know quite well
You might, this moment, find release,
Changing, at will, your present hell
For Liberty's heaven of lasting peace;
If yet, for habit's sake, you choose
This reign of steel, this rule of terror,
It's not for us to push our views
And point you out your silly error.
Herein I speak as I am taught—
That your affairs are yours alone,
Though, for myself, I should have thought
They had a bearing on my own;
Have I no right to interpose,
Urging on you a free autonomy,
Just as your U-boats shove their nose
In my interior economy 2
I'm told we have no quarrel, none,
With you as Germans. That's absurd.
Myself, I hate all sorts of Hun,
Yet will I say one kindly word:
If, still refusing Freedom's part,
You keep the old Potsdam connection,
With all my sympathetic heart
I wish you joy of that selection. :
O. S.
AN ORDER OF THE DAY.
IN my opinion the value of the stock letter has distinct
limitations. What I mean to say is that if there is in a
Government office a series of half-a dozen standard epistles,
| one or other of which can be used as a reply to the majority
of the conundrums that daily serve to bulge the post-bag of
the “controller” or “director,” the selection of the appro-
priate missive should not be left purely to chance.
Last month I wrote to the Methylated Spirit Controller:-
“DEAR SIR,-Referring to the recent Methylated Spirit
(Motor Fuel) Restriction Order, No. 2, 1917, I wish to know
whether I am at liberty to use my car as a means of con-
veyance to a farm about ten miles away where the rabbits
are eating the young blades of wheat. A friend has invited
me to help him shoot them—the rabbits, I mean.”
Well, that was lucid enough, wasn't it? But the reply
was not so helpful as I could have wished. It opened
intelligibly with the words “Dear Sir,” but continued:—
“I am directed by the Methylated Spirit Controller to
inform you that the employment of a hackney motor
vehicle, not licensed to ply for hire, as a conveyance to
divine service constitutes a breach of Regulation 8 ZZ of
the Defence of the Realm Regulations.”
Not a word about the rabbits, you see. -
I was so fascinated by the unexpected results of my first
effort that I tried again, this time breaking new ground.
“DEAR SIR," I wrote, “Referring to Methylated Spirit
(Motor Fuel) Restriction Order, No. 2, 1917, am I at liberty
to use my car daily to take my children to their school,
which is five miles from my residence? The only alterna-
tive form of conveyance available is a donkey and cart, the
employment of which means that my offspring would
have to start overnight.”
I received a quite polite but rather chilly answer:--
"I am directed by the Methylated Spirit Controller to
inform you that the class of necessary household affairs for
which methylated spirit may be employed as a motor fuel
comprises the conveyance from the nearest convenient source
of supply of foodstuffs, fuel and medical requisites, provided
that they cannot be obtained without undue delay by any
means of conveyance other than a motor car.”
My interest thoroughly stimulated by this time, I made
yet one more attempt. I wrote:–
“DEAR SIR,-Referring to Methylated Spirit (Motor Fuel)
Restriction Order, No. 2, 1917, I wish to sell my car"—
which was true—“but how, as I am now practically de-
barred from driving it on the road, am I to give an intend-
ing purchaser a trial run ?”
This was evidently a shrewd thrust, which required con-
sideration, and I heard nothing for a fortnight, during which
I disposed of the car to the proprietor of the local garage.
At last the well-known O.H.M.S. envelope gladdened my
eyes. The letter within it, apologetic but dignified in tone,
is, I fancy, the most popular in stock. It said:—
“I am directed by the Methylated Spirit Controller to
express regret that there is no trace of the correspondence
to which you refer.” - - - -
I left it at that.
SUGAR CARDS AND WILLS. • .
To the Manager of the Legal Department, “Punch.”
SIR,--I am one of the executors and trustees of the will
of a relation who cannot, I fear, live for many weeks.
Included in his property will be a sugar card; and to you,
Sir, I turn for advice and guidance in the responsibilities
which I am shortly to assume.
1. Will the Government accept a sugar card (as they
do War Stock) in payment of Estate Duty 2
2. What is the correct method of valuation ? Does one
calculate the market price by so many years' purchase
based on one's estimate of the duration ? Or will quotations
be obtainable on the Stock Exchange?
3. My relative has left it in the discretion of his Trustees
to distribute a part of his estate for charitable purposes.
Could the Trustees, under their discretionary power, hand
the card to the Trafalgar Square authorities in reduction
of the National Debt”. Or ought they first to obtain the
consent of the residuary legatees?" -
4. There is a tenancy for life of part of the residue. If
the card is comprised in such part, and the tenant for life
became bankrupt, would the card vest in his Trustee in
Bankruptcy 2 If so, what becomes of the remaindermen's
rights? Perhaps the best plan would be to put on a
distringas with the deceased's grocer. - - 4.
5. Have the Trustees power on their own initiative to
lease the card for a term of years? Or should the approval
of the transaction by the Court, under the Settled Estates
Act, be first obtained 2
6. With whom do the Executors register the Probate,
so as to perfect their title? Lord Rhos DDA, Sir A. YAPP,
or the grocer?
7. On the true construction of the Finance Acts, 1894-
1916, do you consider that a sugar card is “Free Personal
Property,” or “Settled Property,” or “An Estate by itself,"
or “Property in which the deceased's interest was less
than an absolute interest.” The card is apparently “aggre-
gable" with something or other for the purposes of duty.
Would this be the testator's furniture ?
- Yours, etc., . A CoNSTANT READER.

THE WATCH DOGS. .
LXVII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, In the little
village I’m thinking of it is a sight on
no account to be missed to see the same
old British Tommy shopping by tele-
pathy. He doesn't speak their language
and they don't speak his, and when the
article required is not in the window or
on the counter to be indicated by the
thumb, a deadlock would appear to be
inevitable. Our Master Thomas, how-
ever, never did realise what a deadlock
is; he goes on till he gets what he
wants. So you see them in pairs, tak-
ing up a stolid position at the counter,
| obstinately stating and re-stating their
demands in a composite language of was the
which the foreign ele- |
ment is almost negligi-
ble, until the merchant
or his wife gives in and
produces the article re-
quired. I know one
simple soldier who man-
aged to reconcile him-
: self to the confirmed
habit amongst the
| French people of ad-
dressing each other in
the French language,
but could never under-
stand their addressing
horses and dogs in
such an unintelligible
tongue. “If you want
a dog to come 'ere, why
not say ‘Come 'ere !’
and 'ave done with it?”
Men may learn strange
lingoes to humour their
fellow-men, but how
can any dog be expected
intense admiration, flowers. It was
none of these things he wanted; he had
only missed his train and wanted to
know what to do about it. But how
were they to know that? When a
Latin misses his train he doesn't sit
down stolidly and think slowly.
I went to his aid. From the manner
in which he rose to salute me they
guessed that I was the Commander-
in-Chief of all the English, and were
for giving me an ovation. Thomas
explained his trouble to me in half-a-
dozen words; I solved it for him in
even fewer. Thomas and I quite under-
stood each other, and there was no want
of sympathy and fellow-feeling between
us. To the small crowd, however, this
extreme of brutal curtness.

and the general situation when they
climb over each other's garden fences
to put the matter to rights. It was the
presence of Thomas and myself which
put such an odd complexion on the
whole affair.
Between ourselves and the crowd it
was “Long live Italy'" and “Long
live England ' " Between the poilus
and the crowd it was “Long live Italy!”
and “Long live Francel" But between
the poilus and ourselves there were no
signs of any desire that England or
France might endure another day. And
yet the crowd couldn't suppose that we
didn't like each other, for the knowing
looks which passed between the hilari-
ous poilu and slowly smiling Thomas
clearly indicated some strange and in-
timate relation. The
crowd just didn't know
|what to make of it all
and what exactly was
between these odd
strangers, who seemed
to have everything in
common but nothing to
say to each other. For
ourselves, I think it
made us feel homesick,
and the home which
|Thomas and I felt sick
for (if you can believe it
of us) was a certain
estaminet we know of
and a cup of caffy-o-lay.
|It was at this moment
I first realised that, as
% between England and
|France, there are no
longer such things as
foreigners; either we've
become French or
they've become Eng-
to understand “Viens ici" 2
Three years and some odd months
have not changed this point of view;
and now for Thomas to find himself in
Italy is only to discover another lot of
unfortunate people who cannot under-
stand or make themselves understood.
A little thing like that, however, is not
going to be allowed to stand between
friends; already new words and phrases
are being coined, mutually acceptable
to both parties.
The first sign I saw of our arrival in
this country was a derelict mess-tin on
a country station platform ; at the next
station I saw a derelict rifle; at the
next a whole derelict kit, and lastly a
complete-in-all-parts derelict soldier.
He was surrounded by a small crowd
of native men, women and children,
anxious to show their appreciation of
his nation by assisting himself. They
were doing their utmost to ascertain his
needs; they were trying him with slices
of bread, a fiasco of chianti, words of
manner, quite understand each other
They now thought I was of the English
carabinieri, and that Thomas was being
led off to his execution. They were
visibly cowed.
But the situation is not so simple
and clearly defined as it was in the
first place. In the old days either we
were English and they weren't, or they
were French and we weren't. There
was no tertium quid. Now things are
more complicated. As Thomas and I
stood on the platform, loving each other
silently and unostentatiously, a cheery
musical train of poilus laboured into
the station. There was nothing silent
or curt about them : they were all
for bread and chianti and flowers and
ovations or any other old thing the
crowd cared to offer. Anything for a
jest and to pass the time of day. Be-
tween the French troops and the Italian
crowd the matter was clear enough.
Next-door neighbours, molested by the
same gang of roughs in the same brutal
lish, or else the two of us have com-
bined into a new mixture which hasn't
yet got a name to it.
I think, though one doesn't talk
much out here about glorious alliances,
some deep feelings were being felt all
round. Diversion was ultimately pro-
vided by the arrival of an imposing
figure in dark blue, with a lot of gilt
about him. The poilu put him down
as an Italian cavalry officer, and ex-
pressed the further hope that Italy
would endure for ever. The Italian
crowd took him for something English,
but not being able to judge whether
he was greater or less than myself,
contented themselves with an attitude
of non-committal reverence all round.
Thomas informed me that he was a
French Staff Officer and displayed no
further interest. Though I cannot tell
you what in the name of goodness he
was doing in those parts, he was in
fact an American Naval Officer.
In short, Charles, alliances are

T-
THE PLAY'S THE THING.
JUST outside Mrs. Ropes' drive gates
there lies a famous and exclusive golf
course, and when she turned her house
into a Convalescent Home the secretary
wrote offering the hospitality of the
club to all officers who might come
under her care.
Nevertheless, when Haynes and I
first arrived, we were both too languid
and feeble for any more exacting form
of athletics than spillikins and jig-
saws, and it was some time before the
M.O. gave us permission to go on the
links. -
“And remember,” he added, “gently
to begin with. Stop at the thirteenth
hole.” -
: : : : -
“Of course,” I said apologetically to
Haynes as we neared the club-house,
“I was pretty putrid before the War,
so I shall be simply indescribable now.”
“My dear chap, this isn't going to
be a match. Keep your excuses till we
play serious golf. To-day's just a
gentle knock round. Here we are.
I'll go and borrow some clubs; you
get a couple of caddies.”
Five minutes later he rejoined me,
carrying two sets of clubs.
“Hallo!” he remarked in surprise.
“I didn't know you'd brought your
family. Introduce me.”
“Mabel,” I said, “and Lucy—our
caddies.”
“Girls 2 '' -
“They have that appearance.

I like to be free.” y sty * * y
“Can't you be free in French for

“Most unsatisfying. Why didn't you
get boys 2" * .
. “The caddy-master says (a) girls are
better; (b) he has no boys; (c) all the
boys he has are booked by plutocrats
with season tickets.” . .
“Oh, all right. Here are your clubs
—the pro. gave me the only two sets
he had available. You're a bit taller
than I am, so I’ve given you the long
ones.” . . . º
I looked at them
“Doesn't a pair of
them 2 " I asked.
“Well, mine are worse. Just a
bundle of toothpicks. Here, catch hold,
Lucy.” "
Mabel teed up for me. I selected a
driver about the length of a telegraph
pole and swept my ball away. It
stopped just short of the first bunker.
Haynes bent himself double to ad-
dress his ball, but straightened up while
swinging and missed it by a foot. At
the second attempt he hooked it over

square-leg's head on to the fairway of
the eighteenth hole.
“Sacré bleu ( " he said with very fair
freedom, “I’m not going all that way
after it. Lucy, run and fetch it, there's
a dear.”
Lucy, highly scandalized at the idea
of losing a hole so tamely, started off;
Mabel and Haynes and I went after
my ball. -
I took the mashie, because I dis-
trusted my ability to carry the bunker
with another telegraph pole. That
mashio would have been about the right
length for me if I could have stood
on a chair while making my stroke.
As it was it entered the ground two
feet behind the ball and emerged, with
a superb divot, just in front.
“Aren't there any short clubs in the
bag, Mabel?” I asked. She handed
me a straight-faced putter . . .
Five strokes later I picked my ball
up out of the bunker.
“I’m over-exerting myself,” I said.
“We'll call that hole a half.”
Neither of us was satisfied with his
tee shot at the next hole. I picked my
ball out of a gorse-bush, and Haynes
rescued his from a drain. Then we
strolled amicably towards the third tee.
Our caddies, unused to such methods,
followed reluctantly.
“Was that 'ole 'alved, too, Sir 2"
piped Mabel with anxious interest.
“It’s a nice point. I hardly know.
Why?"
She hung her head and blushed.
sudden suspicion struck me.
“Mabel,” I said sternly, “are you—
can you be—betting on this game?”
“Yes, Sir,” she answered with a touch
of defiance. “Boys always does.” .
I told Haynes, who appeared pro-
foundly shocked. . . .”
“Good G–! I mean, Mon dieu !”
he exclaimed. “What are we doing?”
“Surely you can't hold us respon-
sible? The child's parents . . .”

money on our play, and we're treating

“Yes, Sir,”
comprehension. - - -
From this point the game became a
grim struggle. I won the third hole in
seventeen, but Haynes took the fourth
in nineteen to my twenty-two.
At the fifth I noticed a pond guarding
the green. I carefully circumvented
this with my faithful putter and holed
out in my smallest score of the round
so far.
“Hi!” shouted Haynes. “How
she answered without
many 2" He had been having a little
hockey practice by himself in the rough,
and was now preparing to play an
approach shot across the pond.
“Twelve 1 " . .
“Then I’ve this for the hole,” he
yelled, and topped his ball gently into
the water . . . -
So it went on—what the papers call
a ding-dong struggle. Suffice it to say
that at the twelfth I was dormy one
and in a state of partial collapse.
The thirteenth is a short hole. You
drive from a kind of pulpit, and the
green is below you, protected by large
stiff-backed bunkers like pews. .
“Last hole, thank Heaven,” panted
Haynes. “I couldn't bear much more.
I’m all of a dither as it is.”
Mabel, twittering with excitement,
teed up. I looked at the green lying
invitingly below and took that gigantic
putter. The ball, struck with all my
little remaining strength, flew straight
towards the biggest bunker, scored a
direct hit on the top of it, bounced high
in the air—and trickled on to the green.
Haynes invoked the Deity (even at
that stressful moment, to his eternal
credit, in French) and took his minia-
ture driver. His ball, hit much too hard,
pitched in the same bunker, crossed it,
climbed up the face of it, and joined
mine on the green. Utterly unnerved,
we toddled down and took our putts.
Haynes, through sheer luck (as he
admits), laid his ball stone dead; I had
a brain-storm and over-ran the hole,
leaving myself a thirty-foot putt for the
match. I took long and careful aim,
but my hands were shaking pitifully.
The ball started on a grotesquely wrong
line, turned on a rise in the ground,
cannoned off a worm-cast and plopped
into the tin. Mabel gave a shriek of
joy, and Lucy—well, I regret to say
that Lucy made use of a terse expres-
sion the French equivalent of which
her employer had been at great pains
to remember. Haynes and I lay flat
on the ground, overcome as much by
emotion as by our physical weakness.
At last I struggled to a sitting
posture. -- -
“Mabel,” I croaked, “I shall want
at least ten per cent. commission for
that. How much have you won 2"
“Please, Sir,” she cooed happily, “a
'a'p'ny, Sir.”

A NEW USE FOR LATIN.
BY OUR CLASSICAL ExPERT.
“Greek is in the last ditch,” writes
| Sir HENRY NEwBoLT in his New Study
of English Poetry; “Latin is trembling
at sight of the thin edge of the wedge.”
| Still a hope of saving Latin—within
| limits—yet remains, if the appeal of
“Kismet" in The Spectator meets with
a sympathetic response. He asks the
readers of that journal “to render into
Latin in two or three words the old
cricket adjuration, “Play the game.’”
He has already had some suggestions,
including “Lude ludum,” from “an
eminent scholar,”
but, like the late
Mr. ToolE in one of his most famous
songs, still he is not happy.
In rendering colloquial phrases into
the lapidary style of ancient Rome, I
| conſes; it is often hard to improve on
the brevity of the vernacular, though
the admonition “to keep your end up"
can be condensed from four words to
two in “sursum cauda.” Again the
familiar eulogy, “Stout fellow,” can
: be rendered in a single word-by the
Virgilian epithet “bellipotens.” A dis-
tinguished Latinist recalls in this
context the sentiment of the writer,
Pomponius Caninus:—
Rebus in adversis comitem sors prospera
. pinguem.
Det mihi.
And to the same authority I am in-
debted for the following version of
“Don't speak to the man at the
wheel: ”—
O silete, circumstantes
Nautas rotam operantes.
Though Latin is tottering at our
schools it occasionally pops up in un-
expected places. For example, not
very long ago I heard a popular come-
dian introduce his family motto and
translate it for the benefit of a music-
hall audience. Latin quotations, even
from HoRACE, have gone out of fashion
in the Houses of Parliament. Perhaps
they will revive on the stage. The
unfair preference for Greek shown by
doctors in the nomenclature of disease
is perhaps to be explained by the
value of unintelligibility. Did not DAN
O'Connell, in his famous vituperative
contest with a Dublin washer-woman,
triumph in the long-run by calling her
an unprincipled parallelopiped 2
Meanwhile I appeal to the Editor of
The Westminster Gazette, who, in his
Saturday edition, has done so much to
maintain the practice of classical com-
position, to offer a prize in one of his
periodical competitions for the best
Latin version, of “to buck up,” “to
stick it out,” “a bit thick,” “talking
through one's hat,” “I don't think,”
“blighter,” “rotter,” and “not 'arf.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, December 3rd.—No further
publicity is to be given to Lord LANs-
down E's letter if the Government can
help it. But the author is not to be
prosecuted and the rumour that Lans-
downe House has been raided by the
police and its noble owner's type-writer
confiscated lacks confirmation.
A long and complicated answer by
Mr. CLYNEs, describing and defending
the new sugar-cards, was not altogether
satisfying. Sir F. BANBURY's inquiry,
“Does the hon. gentleman think that
anybody will get any sugar after this?”
was prompted, no doubt, by anxiety for
the future of his famous cakes; but it
expressed the general doubt.
Lord RoberT CECIL, who has
hitherto stoutly denied that the Allies
have given ex-KING CoNSTANTINE, a
retiring allowance, admitted that the
Greek Government might make him
some payment, and that the Allies
furnished Greece with money. In
other words, Greece has given TINo a
penny to play in the next street, and
the Allies have lent her the penny.
Asked by Mr. GEORGE LAMBERT
whether the labour expended on fitting
gas-bags to motor cars could not be
more usefully employed, the MINISTER
of NATIONAL SERVICE replied as fol-
lows: “The questions involved in the
use of gas-bags, including that raised
by the hon. Member, are being con-
sidered.” And Mr. LAMBERT is now
wondering whether Sir AUCKLAND
GEDDEs intended to be personal.
Tuesday, December 4th.--In answer
to a question as to what steps the Board
of Agriculture was taking to replant
districts denuded of trees, Sir RICHARD
WINFREY replied that “surplus nursery
stock” would be transplanted by
“gangs of women.” Evidently sur-
prised by the laughter which followed,
he whispered to his neighbour, “Have
I said anything very funny?”
At the end of a long catechism by
Mr. KING regarding the literature issued
by the War Aims Committee, Mr.
OUTHWAITE inquired if it could be sent
to Members of the House. Major GUEST ||
was quite ready to oblige. In his
opinion some Members, including Mr.
OUTHWAITE himself, would be much
the better for its perusal.
Mr. PRATT is about the last Minister
whom I should have suspected of
cynicism, but I have my doubts about
him now. By his admission the British
Pharmacopoeia (war edition) contains
“Glycerins devoid of glycerin and
syrups free from sugar.” “But,” he
added, “it does not materially lessen
their value as medicines.”
Upon the House being asked to
recommit the Representation of the
People's Bill in respect of the provisions
dealing with conscientious objectors
and redistribution in Ireland, Mr. RED-
Mond, naturally anxious lest the House
should imagine that Ireland's objection

to military service was conscientious, re-
quested the SPEAKER to divide the debate
into water-tight compartments. No
artificial restraints, however, could keep
Mr. HEALY within bounds. He ranged
at large over Irish history, and declared
that the decision to impose on Ireland
a (more or less) equitable system of
representation was an outrage only to
be compared with the breach of the
Treaty of Limerick.
As a humourist on this occasion Mr.
HEALY had to yield the palm to a col-
league. The CHIEF SECRETARY incident-

ally referred to the arrangement that
no contentious business should be taken
during the War. “Except by agree-
ment,” interjected Mr. NUGENT.
Wednesday, December 5th-Not long
ago Lord Robert CECIL referred to a
rumour that the German Government
intended to encourage polygamy. Mr.
KING, shocked to discover that this
charge rested upon a statement in a
neutral newspaper, protested against
the practice of making speeches “on
such miserable foundations.” As the
bulk of the hon. Member's own utter-
ances have a similar basis the retort
was almost too obvious; and Mr. BAL-
Four in making it must have felt as if
he had shot his bird sitting.
The courage of the hero who took up
the challenge: “Whoever shall these
boots displace, must meet Bombastes
face to face,” was comparatively nothing
to that of Mr. H. W. ForsTER, who in
the interests of economy has promised
to limit the height of women's boots.
There will be much stamping of lofty
Sir John REEs
thought another order lengthening
skirts was the logical corollary, and
so it is if the Government really want
“to make both ends meet.” But Mr.
ForsTER showed no disposition to
embark upon petticoat government.
Irish Nationalists worked themselves
into seven different kinds of fury over
the decision of the Government to
apply the rules of arithmetic to the
redistribution of seats in their beloved
country. Mr. DILLON threatened the
House with the possibility that at the
next General Election he and his col-
leagues might be wiped out of exist-
ence. Scared by this awful prospect
so many Liberals voted against the
closure that the Government only
escaped defeat by 29.
Thursday, December 6th.-The pros-
pect of an all-night sitting rendered the
House unusually irritable. Mr. HEALY
fulminated at Sir E. CARson (who was
not present) in language that re-
minded Colonel SHARMAN-CRAwFoRD of
“a low police-court.” Mr. DILLON's
high top note was ceaselessly employed
in emitting adjectives more remarkable,
as Mr. BonAR LAw icily observed, for
their strength than for their novelty.
At one time it looked as if there was to
be a first-class Irish row. But wiser
counsels ultimately prevailed. The
House as a whole was in no mood for
protracted discussion in which non-
Irish moonlighters might participate.
At last there is hope that the instruc-

THE LOST LEADER.
THE Hillsbury Company of the 2nd Battalion of the
Lastshire Volunteers were being inspected for efficiency by
a Captain of the Grenadier Guards, who had graciously
come down and devoted his Sunday afternoon to this pur-
pose. Forty “A” men had obeyed their country's call and
turned up on parade, and among the officers was Alfred
Herbert, who was a second-lieutenant of the mature age of
fifty. He was enthusiastic, but a slow learner, always
confusing himself and his men. Still, he was obviously
doing his best, and the men forgave him and did their best
to cover up his faults.
“Mr. Herbert,” said the inspecting officer sharply, “be
good enough to take the company out and move them
about for a few minutes.” . - - -
Herbert's heart began to beat at the double. He had
known that this ordeal might come, but he had hoped
against hope that, if he made himself small and meek, he
would be overlooked. All was in vain; his time had come.
“Drill them as a company of two platoons,” said the stern
Guardsman. -- - - - -
“Yes, Sir,” said Herbert. “Shall I—”
“Take them out at once, Sir. We have no time to
waste.”
It was at this moment that Herbert's first dream, or I
should rather say the first phase of his treble dream, began.
He dreamt that he called the company to attention, caused
them to slope arms, and moved them to the right in fours.
So far so good.
Now they were in columns of fours and marching gaily.
“This is a good dream,” thought Herbert. “I will get
them into line. On the right, form company'.” he shouted
at the top of his voice.
He had done it. He had got the rear rank in front, and
this is a terrible state of affairs, leading to the most fright-
ful complications—at any rate in the Lastshire Volunteers.
“Move to the right in fours!” he commanded; and then
the trouble began. - - -
In less than half a minute, forty deserving men, in-
cluding N.C.O.'s, were tied up into a series of terrifically
complicated knots, in the midst of which the Company
Sergeant-Major bobbed about, an angry cork on a stormy
ocean of desperate mem. l
“Very good, Mr. Herbert,
Inspecting Officer. - - - -
At this point Herbert passed into his second phase and
dreamed that it was all a dream.
But the question remained : what was he to do?
“Double!” he shouted, and himself gave the example.
And as he ran he passed into his third phase and dreamed
it was all true; and he woke up with a start at the orderly
room, and found that it was true.
That very evening he resigned his commission, “owing,”
as he wrote, “to an incurable habit of getting the rear rank
in front.”
What happened to the men I cannot say with certainty.
I think they are still struggling. -

MEDITATIONS OF MARCUS 0'REILLY.
ON THE DANGER of PopULARITY.
The Ballybun Binnacle has ceased
publication—I hope temporarily, for I
have had to fall back on The Times.
The latter is the better paper for wrap-
ping things in, and they seem to use a
good kind of ink which does not come
off on the butter, but it's a bit weak on
its advertising side. It was O'Mullins
across the road who pointed this out
to me first. He had, he says, an adver-
tisement a whole week in The Times
for a total abstainer to make himself
otherwise useful and to mend his stable
door; but no apparent notice was taken
of it. The same advertisement had not
been a couple of hours in The Binnacle
before three tinkers tried to steal his
horse.
I have heard people speak well of the
editorials in our chief London rival, but
they are not thought much of in Bally-
bun; they haven't the flavour. Our
paper used to be strongly political, but
the increase in the number of sub-
scribers did not pay for the libel actions,
and so of late we have been cultivating
an open mind and advertisements. It
is true that even so it was impossible
for Casey, our editor, to steer wholly
clear of vexed political questions, but
his latest manner was admirably states-
manlike. He would summarise the
opposing views of our eight or nine
parties and then state boldly that he
agreed with most of them, and as for
the rest he would not shrink to declare,
in the face of the world if necessary,
that they were full of an intellectual
Zeitgeist, unfortunately only too spor-
adic. He would then sum up by draw-
ing attention to the bargain sale of
white goods at the Ballybun Emporium.
Everybody liked this, and the Ballybun
Bon Marché would send in its adver-
tisement for our next week's issue.
The Binnacle has ceased publication,
of course, before. When the editor took
his summer holiday or went to a friend's
wedding in the country he would often
leave the bringing of it out to his staff.
The latter used normally to edit the
sporting and fashionable columns and
was called Flannagan, but had only
one eye and was somewhat eccentric.
Flannagan couldn't be bothered some-
times and sometimeshe would gofishing.
Still, although the paper did not come
out just when we expected, Flannagan
might relent and bring it out two or
three days later, and at all events he
always told us the news whenever he
met us in the street.
Thus we could not strictly say that
we had no local newspaper. But now,
I fear, the case is altered, and The
Binnacle has been killed solely by its
own popularity.
It doesn't do for an editor to be too
popular. People used to drop in on
Casey at all hours of the day and lend a
hand and smoke his tobacco and try to
borrow money. His sanctum became
the fashionable lounge of the Ballybun What was left of Casey shook the dust
élite. A great gap was caused in the
front of the paper amongst the best-
paying advertisements by Kelly's trying
to clean his pipe with part of the lino.
type machine. Casey noticed this,
and further attributed the matter to
the Censor, whom he attacked vigor-
ously in a leading article for trying to
throttle the safety-valve of trade by
inoculating the thin end of the wedge;
he will do this again, he added, at his
own peril. He also told Kelly the same.
As our respected Member of Parlia-
ment is hanging tenaciously on to
life, and we could not very well in-
vite him to create a vacancy, we were
at a loss how to mark our esteem
for our popular editor in a prac-
tical manner. Casey himself suggested
a testimonial. His friends, however,
said that nothing sordid should ever
enter into the feelings with which they
regarded him, and decided finally on
electing him to the second highest
office a layman in our part can hope to
hold. He was elected Judge—“unani-
mously,” as he put it, “by 29 to 3”—
and the race meeting came off last week.
We hate to hold it in war-time, but
the breed of horses and bookies must
be kept up. Even the bed-ridden took
a day off and trooped to it.
Picture the feelings of the crowd
when Casey merged the judge into the
editor and kept declaring race after
race a dead heat. They rose at him as
one man and clamoured for souvenirs.

THE last books of Winter,
Some slim and some stout,
From the hands of the printer

In the matter of fiction

Unceasingly shot
From the press, most are piffle
And very few not.
From minstrelsy's mélée,
Its foam and its surge,
A Keats or a Shelley
May haply emerge;
Or there may be a Tupper
To leaven the lot—
Some bards are immortal

I experienced a jolt. Decause this

thing in the suggestions that follow
which may set the teeth of the reverent
on edge, it must be attributed to honest
zeal. All that I want is for the Ken-
from her pedestal for a few days only—
will be automatic.
Beginning with the postulate that
War's sinews must be forthcoming,
or HAIG and BYNG will batter at the
Hun to insufficient purpose, we can do
anything. Let then, I say,all the artists
be conscripted, whether old masters or
young. The façade of the National
Gallery is to-day one vast hoarding
advertising the progress of the Loan; let
us go inside and levy upon its treasures
too. A few pictorial suggestions will
be found on this page; others will
occur to its habitués, and doubtless
the Trustees (although Lord LANs-
Down E is one) will be only too glad
to fall in with the project.
BURNE-Jones's “Cophetua and the
Beggar Maid" hangs, for instance, in
the National Gallery — temporarily
borrowed from the Tate—at this
moment. lt would make a good piece
of propaganda. “Why is the maid a
beggar?” “Because her parents had
not provided against the future by
provident and patriotic speculation."
Close by hangs, also on loan from
the Tate, CECIL LAwson's “Harvest
Moon.” “Why on this most favour-
able of nights is there no raid 2"
“Because the success of the War Bonds
brought about Germany's surrender.”
After the authorities' most admirable
and desirable way with WHISTLER's
mother, you can do anything and should
do anything. That is my point.
And not only the National Gallery,
but the galleries of France and Italy,
and even Germany herself. Perhaps
Germany first of all, for there would
be a piquancy in thus employing
the cherished possessions of the foe.
Could not something be done, for ex-
ample, with the famous wax bust, the
glory of the Kaiser Friedrich Collec-
tion, into which LEONARDo DA WINCI,
as a finishing touch, crammed an early-
Victorian waistcoat before delivering the
masterpiece to its owner? A really in-
genious organisershould be able to make
telling use of that, perhaps with a play
on the word “investment.” But mean-
while LEONARDo would, I am sure, be
only too willing to suppress his sensitive
feelings and assist his fellow-country-
men in their stand on the Piave by con-
tributing “Monna Lisa.” Some such
words as these would serve: “Why is
she smiling that satisfied smile 2"
“Because she has bought a nice little
packet of War Donds and thus insured
a comfortable old age.” At the same
time TITIAN could help to save his
Venice by lending the “Venus" from
the Uffizi. “Why is this lady so
naked 2" “Because she neglected to
invest in War Bonds, and thus had no-
thing with which to buy clothes later
on.” Or, if a French or English picture
were preferred, INGRES’ “La Source,”
from the Louvre, or LEIGHTON’s “Bath
of Psyche" from the National Gallery,
could be used with the same touching
legend. But I feel that TITIAN should
have the first chance. And there are
living painters too who would come in.
Our own old master—AUGUSTU's JohN
(who is now, I am told, a major)—
would, no doubt, be delighted to lend
the hoardings one of the pictures from
his exhibition now in progress. The

portrait of Mr. for
seer are closed. “Why is this old
gentleman not looking at you?” “Be-
cause he is afraid you may not have
bought any War Bonds and he can't
bear to see anything unpatriotic."
But enough, has been said... The
National War Bonds must be sold, and
Art must help, and no one must wince. -

MANY years ago, when I was younger and more opti-
mistic than to-day, I thought out what struck me as
an adventure-story of wonderful promise, and confided the
plot to a friend, reputed expert in such matters. He heard
me with indulgent attention and, when I had finished,
“Capital,” says he ; “but do you propose to differentiate it
in any way from Dead Man's Rock 2 " I am reminded of
this ancient wound by the appearance of a new buccaneer-
ing book by Sir ARTHUR QUILLER-Couch ; and that not
only on account of the name of the author, but because
when a tale of this kind begins in Bristol Docks, with a
company that includes an apprentice-hero, a one-eyed
sailor and a parrot of piratical past, it is impossible not to
recall Treasure Island. However this may be, Mortallone
soon attains a development quite sufficiently original, with
an island and a secret and a noble store of buried treasure,
all in doubloons and pieces of eight, which is exactly how I
prefer it. In short a capital yarn, which did but confirm
me in an old resolve that, were I ever thinking of com-
mencing pirate or starting any unlawful business of the
seas, I should avoid apprentices like the plague. The
second part of Mortallone and Aunt Trinidad (ARRow-
SMITH) I found rather less satisfactory. Here a number
of tales of the Spanish Main are supposed to be told by a
trio of withered beldames whose youthful prime was spent
as pirate queens. A striking and novel approach; though
my belief in it was hindered by the discovery that these
untutored crones not only spoke but wrote an admirable,
if slightly mannered, prose, akin to that of STEVENSON or,
say, Sir ARTHUR himself. But these be the carpings of
age; I am sure that no boy lucky enough to find Mortal-
lome among his Christmas presents will leave a paragraph
undevoured. -
Dr. H. STUERMER is one of that small band of Germans
who have had the courage to denounce the policy and acts
of their Government. When the War began he joined the
German army, fought in the Masurian operations, was
invalided out of the army at the beginning of 1915, and
thereupon became correspondent in Constantinople of the
Kölnische Zeitung, in which capacity he acted until the end
of 1916, when his too great truthfulness proved distasteful
to his employers and he had to give up his place. Now he
resides in Switzerland and “makes use,” he says, “ of the
opportunity . . . to range himself boldly on the side of
truth, and show that there are still Germans who find it
impossible to condone, even tacitly, the moral transgression
and political stupidity of their own and an allied Govern-
ment.” This is a big undertaking, but Dr. STUERMER
attacks it manfully in his book, Two War Years in Con-
stantinople (Hodder AND Stoughton). He gives a harrow-
ing description of the sufferings of the Armenians, and
leaves no doubt that he considers Germany responsible for
the massacre of a nation. I advise those who desire first-
hand knowledge of the political schemes and ambitions of
the Germans and their Young Turkish friends to consult
this book. It is a mine of information.

conscientious study not only of his characters but of the
details of his background. That background in The Dwell-

mill district with a mixed alien population of operatives,
and trouble brewing as the result of a headstrong wage-
cutting manager, Claude Ditmar, in conflict with the I.W.W.
The phases of this grim struggle are most forcibly described,
the author holding no brief for either protagonist. And,
if widower Ditmar, man of iron, for whom the Chippering
Mill is his second and abiding mate, be no hero, Janet, his
typist, has the makings of a notable heroine. How this
girl, full of character and of passion bravely restrained,
breaks down the business preoccupation of her chief and
how her courage and steadfast honour convince him that
the liaison he promised himself will not suffice for honour
or purified desire—all this is finely told. It was, however,
but a faltering and slowly-growing conviction, and death
claims him before he can make amends for the wrong into

Fleet-Surgeon T. T. JEANs, R.N., scores heavily off most
writers of boys' adventure tales by having actually lived
the life he describes. Here, for instance, in A Naval
Venture (BLACKIE) we do get the real thing, and boys
would be well-advised to sample it and see if it is not
preferable to the kind of adventurous fiction produced so
prolifically for their amusement. Not that this yarn is
lacking in adventure; indeed it is concerned with the
Gallipoli campaign, from the landings until the evacuation,
and anything more adventurous it would be hard to
imagine. In reading this story of The Orphan, The Lamp-
post, Bubbles, The Hun, Rawlins and The Pink Rat, one
feels that the author actually knows these “snotties,” with
their high courage, animal spirits and elementary humour.
It is in fact history spiced with fiction. Of all the char-
acters my vote goes to Kaiser Bill, for although, being a
tortoise, he performed no deeds of actual gallantry, he
carried good luck with him wherever he went. Besides,
his name might annoy the ALL-HIGHEST. Mr. JEANs
made an extremely good shot when he drew his bow at

understatement. There
was Eric Wanstanley,
rising young sculptor,
who, because he didn't

ing the savings of his
friend's parlourmaid to
work a system at rou-
lette. The friend, Aus-
tim Jenner, was also an
artist and also rising.
with Maggie Coalbran, or a fight for the hopeless cause of
the Southern States in shell-torn Wicksburg, or only the
keeping of eternal lazy summer with the peons of Yucatan,
I was altogether content to go humbly forward with him,
convinced that, as it was written, so and no otherwise should
it be. Even when he deservedly failed to become a shining
light in the literary firmament to which he aspired—an un-
heard-of piece of audacity on the part of his authoress—I did
not rebel. Miss SHEILA KAYE.SMITH has an essential clarity
of visualisation, a deep and still reserve of unforced pathos
and an exquisite sense of the haunting word, that combine
with a most competent alertness of movement to make her
latest artistic success, The Challenge to Sirius (NISBET), a
book for which I can hardly find adequate words of praise.
Most admirable of all, perhaps, is a strange faculty she has
shown for making one satisfied that her people should
remain perennially rather poor and unambitious and dull,
and should even grow old without occasioning us regret.
With the deep under-drift of the writer's philosophy one
may not be completely in accord, but certainly it will worry
nobody, while the unity and beauty of her methods hold
one in willing bondage from beginning to end. This is real
literature, and everyone should read it.
Without any very exceptional gifts as a story-teller
concealment of the fact that he was almost wholly sup-
ported by remittances furnished by his hard-working
brother. Incidentally he was engaged to Eric's sister, but
abandoned her without a qualm for the beringed hand of
one Mrs. Meldrum, a rich widow, known as The B. Q.
(Biscuit Queen). Need I say that Mrs. Meldrum, moving
in these circles, and with ambitions as an art patroness,
lived in Cheyne Walk? Indeed the setting of the whole
comedy is inevitably Chelsea. Having regard to the
number of bad hats among the dramatis personae, you will
probably not be astonished to be told that their goings-on
are excellently entertaining; though I cannot but think that
to give both his leading lady and his soubrette, or Singing
Chambermaid, the handicap of morally deficient young
brothers, does look like laziness on the part of Mr. Č.
Surely there exist other avenues to calamity. But it's an

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR PACIFISTS.
FAR as my humble daily round extends,
There's none but longs to see us lay the foe low;
I cannot trace upon my list of friends
A solitary instance of a Bolo;
So that I've sometimes nursed a doubt
Whether there are such lots of them about.
But now, when that Gazette in which I read
(To learn its views on any given matter
And so avoid 'em) hints that no such breed
Exists among us, save in idle chatter,
I am convinced the country reeks
With these unnatural and noisome freaks.
Only the worst are out for German pay;
Some claim ideals on the loftiest level;
Peace (and a fig for Honour) is their lay—
Peace and the Brotherhood of man and devil;
They love all sorts beneath the sun–
Even an Englishman; but best a Hun.
They save the choicest of their tears to shed
For those who break all laws divine and human;
They'd bid the dead past cover up its dead,
Forgetful of our murdered, child and woman;
Forgetful of our drowned who sleep
Without a grave beneath the wandering deep.
I know not how or when this War will close,
But this I know: unless my brain goes rotten,
Never will I clasp hand with hand of those,
False to their blood, who'd have these things
forgotten,
Who want a peace untimely made
Before the uttermost account is paid.
Thirty years on, when weak with age, I might
Possibly talk to some repentant Teuton;
But, while I still can tell a knave at sight
And have enough of strength to keep a boot on,
Only in one way will I get
In touch with samples of the Bolo Set. O. S.
THE CADET’S FRIEND.
MISUNDERStood.—You were in the wrong. The custom
of throwing chicken-bones over the right shoulder is prac-
tised only in the mess of the 13th Bavarian Landsturm
Regiment. Still, considering that you had only joined that
day, we think your colonel acted hastily. -
As You WERE (and several other Correspondents).-The
executive order for the new combined movement of “About
turn and left incline" is given when the joint of the left
big toe is opposite the right instep (in Rifle regiments
substitute right for left and left for right).
SUBALTERN.— Your company commander is without
authority for reproving you for shaving off your moustache.
All the same, judging by the photograph you enclose, we
think you would be wise to keep as much of your face
covered as possible.
FIELD-MARSHAL's BATON.—No, you are mistaken in
supposing that a private soldier under close arrest may
spend two hours daily in the regimental canteen. The
only stimulant allowed him is one glass (2 oz., Mark IV.)
of port daily with the orderly officer when the latter
inspects the guardroom.
SUFFERER.—(1) No, White Star gas is never employed
by army dentists. (2) No, you need not take your respirator
with you. You hire the anaesthetist's at a small charge.
PINK RATs.-You assume that if you were appointed
a mopper-up you would ex-officio be put in charge of the
rum-ration. This is not the case. The function of moppers-
up is to collect souvenirs for the new Great War Museum,
to be housed in one of the four remaining London hotels.
OBSERVER.—German minnenwerfer are not dangerous if
their flight is carefully watched, as they swerve to the left,
and their landing-place can thus be fairly accurately
judged. Two varieties, however—the windupwerfer and the
hoppitwerfer—swerve to the right. The googliwerfer
swerves both ways.
SocIABLE.—The correct method of dealing with snipers
in a house is to ring the front-door bell with the thumb
and forefinger of the right hand, at the same time smartly
inserting a charge of cordite into the letter-box with the
left. Indents for postmen's uniforms for this purpose
should be rendered to D.A.D.O.S. in triplicate.
STATISTICIAN.—The world's record is held by the adju-
tant of the pioneer battalion of the 371st Silesian Foot
Regiment. There is unimpeachable evidence to prove
that he was heard drinking gravy soup from a distance
of 477 metres. The night was calm.
IF THE PAPER SHORTAGE INCREASES.
(Some Future Press Items.)
FICTION FAMINE IN THE PROvINCEs.
FROM many districts come reports of great difficulty in
obtaining novels. Yesterday in a well-known Midland town
the unusual sight was observed of long queues outside the
chief booksellers'. Several libraries displayed notices bear-
ing the words, “No GARVICE to-day"; and quite early in
the afternoon best quality BENSONs were practically un-
obtainable, even by regular customers.
FIRST ConDITIONAL SALE PRosecution.
Much interest has been roused in East Anglia over the
fine of one hundred pounds inflicted by the Bench upon a
local bookseller, found guilty of the Conditional Sale of
Fiction. The chief witness, a retired stockbroker, proved
that defendant refused to supply his order for a shilling's
worth. of O. HENRY unless he also purchased a remainder
copy of Wanderings Round Widnes (published at twelve-
and-six net). The Chairman, remarking that the case was
a specially flagrant one, expressed a hope that the result
would protect the public from such imposition in future.
VALUABLE Discovery. -
In view of the serious shortage in reliable fiction,
nothing less than a sensation is likely to result from the
reported discovery of an entirely satisfactory BARCLAY
substitute in tabloid form. Should the tidings prove well
authenticated, the patrons of circulating libraries will have
good reason for satisfaction. The new preparation is said
to be even sweeter than the original article, and equally
sustaining.
FICTION CARDs CoMING.
On inquiry at the Albert Hall (recently taken over as
offices by the Literature Control Committee), our repre-
sentative was emphatically assured that, should the system
of voluntary romance-rationing prove unsatisfactory, some
form of compulsion will become inevitable. It was pointed
out that the indicated maximum of one novel or magazine
per head weekly is amply sufficient for all reasonable re-
quirements. The attention of the public is further called
to the need of making the fullest and most economical use
of the allowance, and not wasting the advertisement pages,
which contain much readable and stimulating matter, the
patent medicine paragraphs especially being rich in the
finest imaginative fiction.

squelching of ten
containing all kinds of wonderful things
crammed with all sorts of wonderful sur-

underwent a complete change. Every-

matter of course, a bee line for the

his chair, ran to the Canteen cupboard,
popped a piece of Chockchaw into his
mouth (because he had a difficult March

an ordinary human being (who cannot
whistle). I.O. (not the gadfly, but the
Intelligence Officer) dropped in with his
usual list of suspected hostile emplace-

he was asked pertinent questions. He
has to be so careful what he gives away

name of an Excessively Resplendent

headlines in the less expensive daily

A frightful panic came over all.

function even for a minute 2 It was
unthinkable. The news would be
flashed through to all concerned and
become the subject of conversation in
ten thousand messes that evening. It
must not be. Never was there such a

while searching for the
particular dainty he fancied
broached the subject of his
visit in general terms. He
then turned to the officer he
was addressing and polite-
ly offered him the kind of
delicacy he thought would
blend best with the matter
in hand.
And then Chockchaw
arrived. It began by letting
the G.S.O.3 down badly the
first day. All unsuspicious
of its properties he rang up
a Division, popped a piece
into his mouth and waited.
In due time the call came

boots in the mud reached the indignant
Staff at the other end. After a minute's
monologue they rang off in disgust.
Yet in spite of all difficulties the
vogue of Chockchaw swept through
flavoured irresistible concoction.
It is such a ripe, rich, full-
the Corps.
Dis-
- advantages there are, of course, but, on
the other hand, if you want to be quiet,
it is easy to lure the unsuspecting in-
truder on to Chockchaw and leave it
at that. After vain efforts the poor
fellow usually creeps away like a cat
with too big a bone and chews himself
back to speech round the corner,
He
seldom returns, and if he does—there
is always more Chockchaw. Should
he refuse it this time you can take a
piece yourself and save the trouble of
answering, anyway.
Chockchaw entailed more perilous
chances than at first appeared prob-
able. Indeed at one time it looked like
seriously impeding the course of final
victory.

had no breakfast. What's the news,

Move Order done, by the way?” (No
answer.) “Why, what the Good

stood chumping in silence.
The telephone rang. The absurdity
of a dumb Staff tickled everybody. They
winked their appreciation of the situa-
tion at one another. Not to be able to

G.S.O.3 was obliged to lift the receiver.
Something of the seriousness of the
occasion must have communicated itself
to the others, for they crowded round
him, mumbling and munching sympa-
thetically. Speechless, the poor fellow

A.D.C., having cricked his
jaw in the first five seconds,
counted ten and threw up
the sponge. The voice
at the telephone became
louder and more insistent.
Flushed, hot and flurried,
the G.S.O.3 thrust the re-
ceiver into the hands of
the G.S.O.2, who handed
it on to the General, who
passed it on to the A.D.C.,
who dropped it. Nobody
spoke. Only the crackling
and cackling voice could be
heard from the receiver as
it hung face downwards at
the end of its cord. - |
It was a moment demanding imagi-
nation. Naturally the Intelligence
Officer felt the responsibility. He
stepped forward, slapped the mouth-
piece three times with the palm of his
hand, rang off, rang on and slapped it
again. The effect at the other end
must have been horrible, but it achieved
its purpose. By the time connection
had been restored and the blood of the
Signal Master demanded, the A.D.C.
had cheated with a handkerchief and
was able to gasp out that the Corps
Commander would enjoy seeing the
Resplendent One any time that day.
Thus the honour of the General Staff
was saved, the Intelligence Officer vin-
dicated and the vogue of Chockchaw
brought to an untimely end.
“You ought,” said the General
severely to the G.S.O.3—“you ought
to be unstuck for bringing such stuff
into the office.”
“I have never wished so hard in my
life, Sir, to be unstuck,” said he.

THE SUPERIOR SEX.
“You are late again,” said Clara, as I
entered our domestic portal. “What
is it this time?”
Gently but firmly I explained the
reason. A certain amount of tact was
necessary, for my wife does not care
for any remarks that appear to reflect
upon her sex.
“Owing to the present abnormal
state of things, my dear,” I said, “our
office is now almost entirely staffed by
women. In many ways this is an
improvement. Their refining influence
upon the dress and deportment of the
few remaining male members of the
staff is distinctly noticeable. But there
are, I regret to say, certain drawbacks.
Admittedly our superiors in many
respects, in others they are not, I am
afraid, equal to the situation. Take, for
instance, matters of detail where you—
I mean they—should excel. I asked
Miss Philpott to write a letter ->
“Did you post that letter for me
this morning?” said Clara. “If Mrs.
Roberts doesn't get it she won't know
where to meet me to-morrow.”
It is a woman's privilege to wander
from the point at issue. I told Clara
somewhat shortly that I had posted
the letter, although naturally I did not
remember doing so. A man who has
hundreds of petty details to deal with
every day, as I have, develops an
automatic memory — a subconscious
mechanism which never fails him.
I explained this to Clara. “Not
once in five thousand times would it
allow me to pass the pillar-box with
an unposted letter in my pocket. Per-
haps it is the vivid red—”
“And perhaps your vivid imagina-
tion,” said my wife. “Well, I am glad
you posted the letter, for Mrs. Roberts,
as you know, never received the one
you posted ten days ago.”
“I took that matter up very firmly
with the local postmaster,” I said. “He
explained to me that letters are now
almost entirely sorted and delivered by
women, and he was afraid mistakes
sometimes happened. And just to
satisfy you about this last one, which
I put as usual in my breast pocket at
the back of my other papers ” I
produced the contents of my pocket.
As I expected the letter was not there.

in your pocket? What are they all

“Candidly, my dear, I do not know.

would be unbearably monotonous. That

(After reading “Irish Memories.”)
Two Irish cousins greet us here
From BUSHE “the silver-tongued"
descended,
Whose lives for close on thirty year
Were indistinguishably blended;
Scorning the rule that holds for cooks,
They pooled their brains and joined
their forces,
And wrote a dozen gorgeous books
On men and women, hounds and
horses.
They superseded Handley Cross;
They glorified the “hunting fever; ”
They purged their pages of the dross,
While bettering the fun, of LEVER:
With many a priceless turn of phrase
They stirred us to Homeric laughter,
When painting Ireland in the days
Before Sinn Fein bewitched and
“strafed '' her.
With them we watched good Major
Yeates
Contending with litigious peasants,
With “hidden hands” within his gates,
With claims for foxes and for pheas-
ants;
| We saw Leigh Kelway drop his chin–
That precious English super-tripper—
In shocked amazement drinking in
The lurid narrative of Slipper.
l'hilippa's piercing peacock squeals,
Uttered in moments of expansion;
The grime and splendour of the meals
Of Mrs. Knor and of her mansion;
The secrets of horse-coping lore,
The loves of Sally and of Flurry—
: All these delights and hundreds more
Are not forgotten in a hurry.
Yet the same genial pens that freight
Our memories with joyous magic
Gave us the tale of Francic's fate—
So vulgar, lovable and tragic;
Just to the land that gave them birth
They showed her smiling, sad and
sullen,
|
And turning from the paths of mirth
Probed the dark soul of Charlotte
Mullen.
Alas! the tie, so close, so dear,
Two years ago death rent asunder;
Hushed is the voice so gay and clear
Which moved us once to joy and
wonder;
Yet, though they chronicle a loss
Whose pang no lapse of time as-
Suages,
The spirit of brave “MARTIN Ross"
Shines like a star throughout these
pages.
Here in her letters may one trace
The generous scorn, the gentle pity,
The easy unaffected grace,
The wisdom that was always witty;
tender,
Who marched unfaltering to her goal
Through sacrifice and self-surrender.
THE FOOD OF THE FAMOUS.
THE publication of Lord RHONDDA's
daily menu will, we hope, lead other
prominent people who are striving to
follow his good example to divulge the
details of their dietary. But in case their
natural modesty may prevent them
from doing so, Mr. Punch ventures to
supply a few unauthorised particulars.
The source of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's
boundless energy has long been a
mystery. It is now known to be
derived from a raw leek eaten on rising,
and a dinner of Welsh rabbit, made
from a modicum of Government cheese
and half a slice of war bread.
With Mr. BoxAR LAw all meals are
oatmeals. A plate of porridge at day-
break, bannocks slightly margarined,
when possible, for lunch, and a stiff
cup of gruel just after Question time
keep him alert and smiling.
Thanks to the Spartan habits formed
during his connection with both ser-
vices, belt-tightening has no terrors for
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL. A quid of
Navy tobacco suffices for breakfast, and
his only other meal consists of a slice
of bully beef with a hard biscuit served
on an inverted packing-case.
The wild rumours recently current
as to the amount of nutriment required
for the upkeep of Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON
have now been happily set at rest.
The needful calories for twenty-four
hours of his strenuous existence are
supplied by two cups of cocoa, a shred
of dried toast, a Brazil nut, a glass of
sodawater and a grilled banana.
“In one case the good cows from one herd
had an average production of 9,592 lbs. milk,
and 406 lbs. of fat, while the poor cows had a
production of only 3,098 lbs. of milk and
119 lbs. of tea.”—Farming News.
Give us the poor cows every time.
From a Church paper:-
“‘EARLY CHRISTIANs.” I am sorry you can-
not get these from the Army and Navy Stores.”
It sounds like the old tiger story.
“A certain company commander, looking
out of his quarters, saw several Germans in
possession of a dump not far away. Although
still in his sleeping clothes, he seized his
trench tick and rushed towards them. Why
they did not fire upon him is one of those
little mysteries which will probably never be
explained.”—Daily Paper.

Horrors of War, who knows all about
the fauna of the trenches.

TO “MARTIN ROSS.” %."...". "...ong ye. THE PERFECT customer.
IT was a very ordinary country sale
of work. The Countess of Bilberry de-
clared it open in a neat little speech,
and then bought generously from every
stall; her daughter, whose smile nobody
could resist, did a fine trade with raffle
tickets for the record pumpkin produced
by the local allotments; Mrs. Dodd, the
Rector's wife, presided over a pair of
scales and a strictly rationed tea, and
all the rest of the village sold vegetables
and socks and pincushions, and tried to
pretend that antimacassars and shaving
tidies and woolwork waistbelts were the
most desirable things in the world when
they were made by wounded men at the
nearest Red Cross Hospital, in whose
aid the sale was held.
But there was one unique figure
amongst all the folk who knew each
other, and each other's clothes, and
each other's clothes' cost, so well. She
arrived at the Village Hall in a pony-
carriage, drawn by the ugliest little
pony that ever sniffed oats. She was
very quietly and very tastefully dressed,
and, instead of concentrating on the
well-laden stalls of garden produce or
the orderly stacks of knitted comforts,
or the really useful baskets, she went
straight to the stall which even Mrs.
Dodd, who had the kindest heart in the
countryside, had been compelled to
relegate to a dark corner. There was
woolwork run riot over cushions of in-
credible hardness; there were candle-
shades guaranteed to catch alight at
the mere sight of a match; there were
crochet dressing-table mats, and there
was a three-legged stool on which even
a fairy could not have sat without
danger of a break-down.
The youngest Miss Dodd, a severely
practical young lady of sixteen, who
was presiding at this stall, jumped up
in surprise at the sight of a customer,
and in doing so knocked over a glass
box bound with red and white and blue
ribbon, with “Handkerchiefs” painted
across the corner in a design of forget-
me-nots. There was very little glass
box left when she picked it up, and the
splinters had made a good many little
craters in the surface of a big bowl of
clotted cream, labelled “Positively the
last appearance for the Duration of the
War,” which was at the corner of the
next stall.
The little stranger said that she would
take the box and the damaged cream
too; she bought a whole family of
crochet mats with centres of orange
woollen loops; three pincushions made
of playing cards discharged as no longer
fit for active service; a table-centre
with pen-painting of the Allied flags,
and a letter-case with the badges of the

Dominions worked in wool and “Across
the sea, A letter from thee,” straggling
wearily across one corner. Then there
was an antimacassar in purple, and
magenta sateen, with yellow daffodils
making a brave attempt to flourish in
unlikely surroundings.
At the next stall she bought a photo-
graph frame which had lost its prop in
an unequal contest with a tea-tray
which had collapsed from the heartiness
of the Rector's clapping at the conclu-
sion of the Countess's speech; and a
Noah's Ark from which the star per-

somehow disappeared.
Then the little lady paused before
the live-stock stall. -
“There isn't anything really hideous
here,” she murmured to herself; “but
I think that puppy—it's never had its
tail cut, and nobody will ever know
whether it's a sealyham, a spaniel or
even a dash of a setter—I will take the
puppy, please,” she added, “as soon as
I've had some tea. After that I will
see what is left. You have such nice
things.”
After tea she went back to the young-
est Miss Dodd and collected a few more
of the more glaring atrocities, paid her
bills, and then went off to her pony-
carriage; the youngest Miss Dodd, very
much inclined to giggle, bearing armfuls
of odd purchases in her wake, crowned
by the bowl of cream and the mongrel
pup. She handed them in and was just
going away when the little old lady
pressed a piece of paper into her hand.
“I don't like to worry people,” she
said gently, “but if you have time you
might read this. It has been a great
opportunity to-day; I don't often find
so much to be done—and I shall love
the puppy.”
The youngest Miss Dodd watched
the start of the ugly pony with a snigger
and then went back into the lighted
hall to read the pamphlet. It was a
touching little document—many people
know it well—and the youngest Miss
Dodd, who had never been known to
sentimentalize over anything before,
blew her nose rather violently when
she had read it.
“Bless her dear little soul!” she said
to herself: “I don't wonder that pup
was trying to kiss her. I only hope
she won't try to eat that cream with
the glass in it, or give it to the pup.”
For the pamphlet was the Rules for
Membership and a treatise on the Ob-
jects and Methods of the “Society for
uying What Nobody Wants.”

THE CLYDE-BUILT clipper.
[Many of the fast-sailing clippers which were making fine passages in the Australian wool trade in the 'seventies and onwards were
laid up or turned into hulks before the War. Recently, however, several have been re-fitted for sea and are once more doing good service.]
A shLP there was, and she went to sea
(Away O, my Clyde-built clipper!)
In eighteen hundred and seventy-three,
Fine in the lines and keen in the bow,
The way they've forgotten to build 'em now ;
Lofty masted and heavily sparred,
With stunsail booms to every yard,
And flying kites both high and low
To catch the winds when they did blow
(And away, my Clyde-built clipper!).
Fastest ship on the Colonies run—
(Away O, my racing clipper!)
That was her when her time begun;
Sixteen knots she could easily do,
And thirteen knots on a bowline too;
She could show her heels to anything made
With sky-sails set in a favouring trade,
Or when she was running her easting down
From London River to Hobart Town
(And away, my racing clipper!).
Old shellbacks knew her near and far
(Away O, my old-time clipper!)
From Circular Quay to Mersey Bar,
And many a thundering lie they told
About her runs in the days of old;
But the time did come and the time did go,
And she grew old as we all must grow,
And the most of her gear was carried away
When caught aback in a gale one day
(And away, my old-time clipper!).
Her masts were sprung from fore to mizen
(Away O, my poor old clipper!)
And freights was poor and dues had risen,
And there warn't no sense in rigging her new,
So they laid her up for a year or two ; -
And there they left her, and there she lay,
And there she might have been laying to-day,
But when cargoes are many and ships are few
A ship's a ship be she old or new
(And away, my poor old clipper!).
So in nineteen hundred and seventeen
(Away O, my brave old clipper!)
They've rigged her new and they've scraped her
clean
And sent her to sea in time of war
To sail the seas as she sailed before.
And in nineteen hundred and seventeen
She's the same good ship as she's always been;
Her ribs are as staunch and her hull's as sound
As any you'd find the wide world round
(And away, my brave old clipper!).
The same as they were when she went to sea
(Away O, my Clyde-built clipper')
In eighteen hundred and seventy-three,
Fine in the lines and keen in the bow,
The way they've forgotten to build 'em now;
Lofty masted and heavily sparred,
With stunsail booms to every yard,
And flying kites both high and low
To catch the winds when they did blow—
(And away, my Clyde-built clipper!). C. F. S.

I presume some Members of Parlia-

which they took on the subject were

UNDER-SECRETARY that he him-
self had attempted to use his
influence on behalf of a candidate.
Mr. PRINGLE was righteously in-
dignant. He had never asked
favours of the War Office; he had
merely “recommended men per-
sonally known to me.” This deli-
cate distinction, which should
have convinced Members of Mr.
PRINGLE's disinterestedness, only
made them laugh.
On the Vote of Credit for 550
millions the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER was invited by Mr.
DILLON to make a survey of the
military situation. He replied
that all the relevant facts were
known already. “The War is
going on ; the Government and
the country intend it shall go on;
and money is necessary to make
it go on." It is, perhaps, a pity
that he did not content himself
with this epitome and refuse to be
drawn into a discussion of the recent
operations near Cambrai. What has
Mr. DILLON done to promote the pro-
secution of the War that he should
receive special consideration?
There was a renewed discussion of
the censorship of pamphlets. Sir
GEORGE CAVE ably defended the regu-
lations, but did not convince everyone
that his preference for confiscation over
prosecution was entirely sound. The
idea that the publishers of these pam-

probably erroneous, or why was it
necessary to insist that they should put
their names to them?

THE W.C.
My cousin Agatha has been a bad cor-
respondent ever since she married my
old friend, George Thimblewell, which
means for the past five-and-twenty
years, so in ordinary circumstances I do
not expect more from her than a “hasty
line" to tell me how the youngsters
are doing (George, of course, never
writes at all). But I must say I was
surprised and not a little hurt when,
in the skimpy margin of a letter deal-
ing mainly with the difficulty of devis-
ing breakfast-dishes, she scribbled in
the most casual manner conceivable,
“George has got the V.C. at last.”
George, my dear old school-chum,
with the V.C., and his wife tells me of
it as casually as if it had been a gum-
boil! I sat with her letter before me
and looked back through the years,
seeing us two—George and myself—

knew him. Had I not fostered the

self might well take a certain amount
of credit for that decoration. And here
was his wife mentioning it as though she
scarcely expected me to be interested.
Never a date, never a detail.
I was so ruffled that I decided, since
she vouchsafed no information, to ask
for none, as became a man with proper
pride. I adopted a semi-jocular vein
to meet the case.
“I have known your W.C. longer
than you have, Agatha,” I wrote, “and
am as pleased and proud as you can
be. The strong silent type—you can
rely upon them. Quiet and domesti-
cated, requiring little attention, helpful
about the house, undemonstrative per-
haps, but all the time ready for the
most desperate emergency. Let me
know when George is to be at home,
and I shall come to dinner and hear all
about it.”
As I sealed my note it occurred to
me that George must be the first
special constable to win the Cross,
and I felt a glow of satisfaction to
realise that we must now be eligible for
that most glorious of all decorations.
A few days later came another note
time, but with a postscript which said,
“It isn't like you to chaff me, James.
I don't see that there is anything par-
|ticularly funny about George having
got the Vacuum Cleaner which he
promised me long ago.”

A CHRISTMAS MESSAGE.
So Christmas comes and finds you yet in Flanders,
And all is mud and messiness and sleet,
And men have temperatures and horses glanders,
And Brigadiers have trouble with their feet,
And life is bad for Company-Commanders,
And even Thomas's is not so sweet.
Now cooks for kindlewood would give great riches,
And in the dixies the pale stew congeals,
And ration-parties are not free from hitches,
But all night circle like performing seals,
Till morning breaks and everybody pitches
Into a hole some other person's meals.
Now regiments huddle over last week's ashes
And pray for coal and sedulously “rest,”
Where rain and wind contemn the empty sashes,
And blue lips frame the faint heroic jest,
Till some near howitzer goes off and smashes
The only window that the town possessed.
Yet somehow Christinas in your souls is stirring,
And Colonels now less viciously upbraid
Their Transport Officers, however erring,
And sudden signals issue from Brigade
To say next Tuesday Christmas is occurring,
And what arrangements have Battalions made?
And then, maybe. while everyone discusses
On what rich foods their dear commands shall dine,
And (most efficiently) the Padre fusses
About the birds, the speeches and the wine—
The Corps-Commander sends a fleet of 'buses
To whisk you off to Christmas in the line.
You make no moan, nor hint at how you're faring,
And here in turn we try to hide our woe,
With taxis mutinous, and Tubes so wearing,
And who can tell where all the matches go?
And all our doors and windows want repairing,
But can we get a man to mend them 2 No.
The dustman visits not ; we can't get castor;
In vain are parlour-maids and plumbers sought,
And human intellect can scarcely master
The time when beer may lawfully be bought,
Or calculate how cash can go much faster,
And if one's butcher's acting as he ought.
Our old indulgences are now not cricket;
Whate'er one does some Minister will cuss ;
In Tube and Tram young ladies punch one's ticket,
With whom one can't be cross or querulous;
All things are different, but still we stick it,
And humbly hope we help a little thus.
So, Fellow-sufferers, we give you greeting—
All luck, all laughter and an end of wars! -
And just to strengthen you for Fritz's beating,
I'm sending out a parcel from the Stores;
They mean to stop my annual over-eating,
But it will comfort me to think of yours.

“I wish,” said Francesca, “you would explain something
to me.”
“I am full,” I said, “of explanations of every conceiv-
able difficulty. You have only to tap me and an explana-
tion will come bubbling out.”
“I am not sure that I want the bubbling sort. On the
whole I think I prefer the still waters that run deep.”
“Those too can be provided for you. All you have got
to do is to ask.”
“What a comfort it is,” she said, “to live constantly in
the mild and magnificent eye of an encyclopaedia."
“Yes,” I said, “it saves a lot of running about, doesn't
it? Come now, fire off your question.”
“What is your opinion of the Bank of England 2"
“The Bank of England?” I gasped. “One doesn't
have opinions of the Bank of England. One just accepts
it, you know, and there you are.”
“Yes,” she said, “that's exactly what I felt about it. I
thought it was one of the signs of our superiority to
everybody else, with its crisp banknotes and all that."
“You mustn't forget its detachment of the Guards to
protect it. Many's the good dinner I’ve had with the
officer of the Bank Guard in the old days.”
“I'm afraid that leaves me cold, not being able to take
part in it.”
“If it gave me pleasure to dine at the Bank, I should
have thought the subject would have interested you.”
“Well, it wasn't exactly what I wanted to consult you
about.”
“What was it then?” I said. “You know you mustn't
cast doubts on the financial stability of the Bank. You'll
be put in prison if you do.”
“I shouldn't dream of doing anything of the sort.”
“Come, then, be quick about it. This suspense is
making me tremble for my War Loan Bonds.”
“Is the Bank,” said Francesca, “a generous insti-
tution ?” . s - - “. . .
“Banks,” I said, “cannot afford to be generous. They
are just and accurate and there's an end of it.”
“The Bank of England,” she said, “being so great, is an
exception to the rule. Anyhow, it has been generous to
me, for it has given me one hundred pounds.”
“Do you mean,” I cried, “one hundred pounds that
don't belong to you?” - -
“Of course I do. If they had belonged to me there
wouldn't have been anything to make a fuss about.” -
“This,” I said, “is one of the most breathless things
ever known. A mere woman, who is unskilled in finance
and has only the dimmest recollection of the rule of three
and compound interest, gets the better of the greatest
banking institution in the world to the tune of one hundred
pounds. It's incredible. Of course you've made a mistake.”
“That's right,” she said. “Always go against your wife
and think her wrong, even when it is only an institution
that she's contending with.”
“It's precisely because it is an institution that I doubt
your statement.”
“You're not very helpful; you don't tell me whether I'm
to sit down under the burden of owning one hundred pounds
of the bank's money that doesn't belong to me.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you must calm yourself and tell
me as clearly as possible how you came into possession of
this extra hundred pounds which is apparently burning a
hole in your pocket—if indeed you have a pocket, which
I doubt.” - -
“You're quite wrong; I've got two pockets in the dress
I'm wearing at this moment.”
“I will not,” I said, “discuss with you the number of
your pockets. Now tell me your pathetic story. I am
all ears.”
“Well,” said Francesca, “it’s this way. I put one hun-
dred pounds in the old War Loan, and then Exchequer Bonds
came along, and I put one hundred pounds of my very best
savings into them, and then came the new Five per Cent.
War Loan, and somehow or other I got converted into that.
And after that there was what they called a broken amount,
which I brought up to fifty pounds or a multiple of fifty
pounds. That cost me about forty pounds. I don't know
why they wanted me to do it or why I did it.”
“Probably they thought it would be easier for the Bank.”
“That's paltry; easiness ought to have nothing to do
with it.” -
“Anyhow,” I said, “I make out from your statement
that you ought to have two hundred and fifty pounds of
Five per Cent. Stock to your credit.”
“Precisely,” said Francesca impressively, “but yesterday
morning I received from the bank a dividend thing
“You may call it a warrant,” I said.
“A dividend warrant,” continued Francesca, “for eight
pounds fifteen shillings on three hundred and fifty pounds,

of England?”

there is one point you omitted to mention.”

“Of course,” I said, “a financial magnate like yourself
would easily forget so wretched a sum; but the Bank has
done no wrong.”
“Yes, it has; it sent out a lot of papers that were very

you going to repay what you owe me—with interest?”

THE SPREAD OF THE QUEUE HABIT.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ONE of the most interesting features, to an English
observer, in the impressive spectacle of America girding
herself for war is the sight of our great Ally passing
through all those phases of initiation that to us are now
remote memories. Such a phase is the coming of the first
war-books, exemplified for me by the appearance of From
the Fire Step (PUTNAMs). As his sub-title indicates—
Experiences of an American Soldier in the British Army—
the writer, Mr. ARTHUR GUY EMPEY, has proved himself
something of a pioneer. In a singularly vivacious opening
chapter he tells how, after waiting with decreasing expecta-
tion during the months that followed the Lusitania crime,
he decided to be a law unto himself, and came alone to
offer his personal service in the cause of freedom. You
will hardly read unmoved (by laughter as much as by
sympathy) his story of how this offer was at first refused,
then accepted. Throughout indeed you must prepare to
find Mr. EMPEY an entirely independent, though generous,
critic of our men and methods; it is precisely this attitude
that gives his book its chief interest as a survey of all-too-
familiar things from a refreshingly new angle. I hardly
suppose there will be anything in the actual matter, from
church parade to gas-attacks, which readers on this side
will not by now have seen or heard about, times beyond
number; but one can imagine sympathetically with what
concern it will all be received in the homes oversea; and
after turning its high-spirited and encouraging pages can
warmly echo the admonition of their writer: “Pacifists
and small-army people please read with care!"
Since there is probably no writer who can approach
Mrs. FLORA ANNIE STEEL in the art of telling Indian tales
about Indian people, one is specially happy to find her in
Mistress of Men (HEINEMANN) with her foot once more upon
her special terrain. Not for the first time, I think, she
has gone to the records of the House of AKBAR for her
material; the result here is hardly to be called a novel so
much as amplified history, since it is really the life story
of an actual (and wonderful) woman, NURJAHAN THE
BEAUTIFUL, wife of the Emperor JAHANGIR. Naturally the
writer has experienced not only the great advantages but
the hazards of such a building upon fact. To explain the
marriage of your heroine with the Imperial lover by whose
orders her first husband was killed, and not to lessen
sympathy for her in the process, is a problem to test the
skill of any novelist. One sees, however, even without
Mrs. STEEL's own declaration, that it has been for her
a grateful task to set down “a record of the most perfect
passion ever shown by man for woman.” This was the
adoration of the EMPEROR for his consort, an amazing
romance of Oriental domesticity, which makes the story
of the pair stranger and more fascinating than fiction.
A love-tale indeed; and, since 'tis love that makes a book go
round, one may trust the circulating libraries to see to it
that Mistress of Men is well represented on their shelves.
As a study of an alluring, dazzling and masterful person-
ality it was well worth writing.
There is a sad interest in the title-page of Irish Memories
(LONG MANs), since only by a pathetic fiction does it bear
the names, as joint authors, of E. CE. SoMERVILLE and
“MARTIN Ross,” those two gifted ladies whose association
has been such a happy chance for them and for us all.
Really the book, though in part compiled from the letters
and journals of “MARTIN,” is an eloquent tribute by Miss

SoMERVILLE to the partner whose death has robbed her of
a friend and the world of so much kindly laughter. But,
haunted as it is by this shadow of bereavement, you must
in no way think of it as wholly a thing of gloom... Looking
back into the good years, the writer has recalled many
incidents and scenes full of that genial and most infectious
merriment that we have learnt to expect from her—tales of
the wonderful peasant chorus that one remembers first in
the pages of An Irish R.M., exploits after hounds (it needs
no telling how well both authors loved them), and much
besides. There will be interest also for many uninitiated
admirers in the account here given of how the famous
stories came first into being. Of its more intimate and per-
sonal side I hesitate to speak; those who loved “MARTIN
Ross,” either through her writings or in the closer relation-
ship of friend, must be glad that her ave atque vale has
been spoken, as she would have wished it, by her whose
right it was. It will send many to read again those

gives us information which is all the more valuable because
we hear solittle of the Macedonian campaign. Mr. STEBBING
was appointed Transport Officer to a unit of the Scottish
Women's Hospitals that was sent to the Serbian Front.
Naturally he has much to say of the work done by these
brave and untiring women. Under exceptionally difficult
circumstances their courage never failed, and it is good to
remember that their arrival at Ostrovo was of the greatest
possible service to the Serbs. That is one part of the book,
and it is well told. The other is of actual war, and here
Mr. STEBBING was given ample opportunities to observe.
No one can read his account of the taking of Kajmakt-
calan without feeling the keenest admiration for the gal-
lantry of the Serbs. He also describes very graphically
the frontal attack by the French upon the Kenali lines in
October, 1916. The British public is too apt to look upon
the Macedonian campaign as a prolonged picnic, and for
them a dose of Mr. STEBBING would be excellent medicine.

ing you any adequate idea
the third of his family to
give his life for France.
The letters reveal a cha- -
racter that hardships and dangers not only strengthened
but refined. He writes with a noble French ardour of
his country in the crisis of her fate. He dreads, but
rises greatly to the height of, his heavy responsibility
as Captain at the age of twenty-one. The coveted cross
of the Legion of Honour comes to him before the end,
and he wins the affection and confidence of his men—a
soldier's highest prize.
A deep religious conviction un-
clouded by superstition sustains his courage. . He is a
product of the French Catholic tradition at its best. . He
writes intelligently of his work, and with a greater free-

so that you get an excellent picture of the daily life of a
campaigner in the greatest of all wars. He met the
- English in Flanders, admired and liked their looks, and
ways. . A very charming record of a gallant soldier, a
chosen soul.
In the first few pages of At the Serbian Front in Mace-

anecdotes that I began to wonder if he was ever going to
get there. When, however, he has got into his stride, he

Indian Prince of marvellous beauty and mysterious powers,
who, being jilted by the girl of his heart, wishes to be
revenged upon the human race. To this end he employs
the activities of a German Professor, who produces what
one might call a Kultur of the sterility germ. However,
these cheery projects go astray, though in precisely what
manner I have no very clear idea. But the end came at
a gathering where the Prince played psychic music, and a
chance union of hands between hero and heroine trans-
muted the former from “a dilettante” and “polished ladies'
man” to “a virile male filled with the blasting vehemence
of primary passions.” Incidentally it proved altogether
too much both for the Professor and his inoculated rabbits,
all of whom expired on the spot. Just about here that
most pertinent question became more acute than ever.
Fortunately it was the last page but one of the story.

- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
I Do not think there was a single
man of the ship's company who bore
the loss of poor Mnemosyne dry-eyed.
From the lieutenant down to the trim-
mer we had become sincerely attached
to this affectionate little creature, and
when unhappily, during the temporary
absence of the steward, she ventured to
circumvent the rim of an open con-
densed milk-tin, missed her footing and
succumbed to a clammy death, there
was not a more unhappy trawler pa-
trolling the North Sea than ours.
She was a weevil and I found her in
my ship's biscuit. From the first I
recognised that she was no ordinary
weevil; her stately bearing, the fine
upward curl of her moustachios, but,
more than anything else, the intelligent,
often humorous gleam in her big black
eyes elevated her at once above the
mass of her compatriots. She took to
me wonderfully; I secured her confi-
dence with a piece of boiled cat-fish, and
thenceforth we were scarcely ever apart.
Not that she resented the advances of
the rest of the crew—she was no snob,
and would eat from the hand of the
trimmer as readily as from my own,
and allow anyone to stroke her; but it
was I who taught her to sit up and
beg, to “die for her country,” to droop
her antennae whenever the name of
voN TIRPITz was mentioned, and to
wave them for Sir DAVID BEATTY. She
would often sit with me in the wireless
cabin whilst I was on watch, and never
once did she disturb me during the
receiving of a message by boisterous or
noisy behaviour.
We had other weevils at different
times, but none so intelligent or so faith-
ful as Mnemosyne. The lieutenant tamed
one, and, being a devotee of science
and despising the arts, he named him
Newton Darwin; but he was a foolish
fellow at the best and continually get-
ting into somebody's way. The lieu-
tenant offered to back him against
Mnemosyne for a race across the cabin
table, and we made a match of it. The
betting was three to two in favour of
Newton Darwin, because the third
hand, who had once been employed in
a racing-stable, had been heard to re-
mark that he had very fine quarters.
The stakes were half a plug of ship's
tobacco.
It was a walk-over. On the word
“Go "Mnemosyne positively leapt for-
ward, took a crease in the tablecloth in
her stride and completed the course,
which measured sixteen inches, in the
remarkable time of seven and two-fifths
minutes. Newton Darwin was left
standing; indecd he never attempted
to race, but, after staring about vacantly
for some minutes, ambled leisurely off
in the opposite direction, where he had
seen a breadcrumb.
This victory was very popular, and
the third hand was roundly abused for
suggesting that Mnemosyne had been
doped. Even if Newton had got away
with the pistol he would never have
stood a chance against her. “She was
the fleetest weevil I ever saw.
Another weevil was Bertie, who be-
longed to the second engineer, but he
was caught pilfering the skipper's pri-
vate supply of fresh butter, which he
kept in a jar in his bunk and was very
jealous of, so Bertie had to be made
away with. He walked the plank at
daybreak one grey stormy morning
just off the Nethermost Ruff of the
Dogger. The second was very upset for
a day or two; he said he would have
staked anything on Bertie's honesty.
We kept Mnemosyne for over two
months, and never once did she mis-
conduct herself or behave in an unsea-
manlike manner. Her one failing, if
such it can be called, was a weakness
for condensed milk, and this it was that
led to her untimely end. We had come
to regard her as one of the crew, and
had a little lifebelt made for her in case
of need. Jones, our signaller, who has
poetical moments, was inspired by her
to make verse, which began —
There is something very evil
In the war-whoop of a weevil.
This was indignantly censored as a
libel, but he excused himself on the
plea that “evil” was the only possible
rhyme to be found for “weevil,” and
declared that his very last intention
had been to be personal or to cast the
least reflection on the lovable disposi-
tion of Mnemosyne, so we forgave him
with a caution. -
Well, Mnemosyne is gone, and the
ship seems a dull place without this
exhilarating little pet. Never so long
as ship's biscuits continue to buckle
the jack-knives of British seafarers
will there be another weevil like Mne-
mosyne.
We flew the White Ensign at half-
mast from dawn to sundown on the
day she died.

IF physiognomists are right,
And faces count as half the battle,
We clearly ought not to invite
Comparison with sheep or cattle,
But rather should improve the features
That mark us off from humbler crea-
tures.
Eyebrows projecting like a bush
Are facial assets to be prized,
Denoting driving-power and push
In men however undersized
(Bear's grease or paraffin or both
Will largely stimulate their growth).
The fish-like and lethargic eye
We should endeavour to efface,
And foster visual orbs that vie
With those of eagles in its place;
While belladonna's artful use
An extra brilliance may produce.
Nor are there wanting ways and means
Enabling experts to impose
By sundry suitable machines
Fine character upon the nose;
And nasal dignity, we find,
Promptly reacts upon the mind.
But those who in this great reform
Of face and feature are engrossed
Agree that to enforce a norm
In labial fabric matters most ;
The lips that help a race to win
Unquestionably must be thin.
Therefore with pleasure unalloyed

Bore he the Rum Jar,

To the Folk in the Front Line.
Scatheful the sky
With no stars shining;
Monstrous the mud
That lay deep on the Duck Boards.
A weary while
Wandered he on ;
No wit he wotted
Of fate that followed
Stalking his steps.
So passed he the posts
All silent and sunken
In mire and murk,
Till fearful he felt for
The doubtful Duck Boards
No longer beneath him.
Then spake Sidni,
Steward of Stores:
“Now know I well
I have come to the Country
That men nanne No Man's ;
And with woe his heart
Waxed heavy within him
For horror of Hun Folk
Who crawl in the craters.
Then there arose
Dim in the darkness
The face and form
Of Heinrik the Hun
With hand upheld
Bearing a bomb.
But fear filled the heart
Of Sidni the Storeman,
And with force of fear
Raising the Rum Jar
Drave he adrad
At the face of the foeman.
Down sank the Slayer
Smitten asunder
And over his face
Unloosed ran the liquor.
Then Heinrik the Hun
Sang he this Swan Song:
"Hero, I hail thee,
Godlike who givest
Fire and Sweetness
Born of a blow.
Loki art thou,
Or Wotan the one-eyed
Coming to call me

Of the fear that was in him

“ UNION OF DEMONCRATIC CONTROL.”
Is this a misprint or a criticism”
And came by chance
Straightway to his section,
Bearing the Rum Jar
Now lacking the liquor.
Then, puffing with pride
And the pace of his running,
Told he a tale
Of the Slaying of Seven ;
But little belief
In the count of the killing
Gat Sid from the section,
Wrathy withal
At the loss of the liquor.
And one thing Erb,
Erb that erstwhile
Hight his old Pal,
Had for an answer:
“Bale hast thou brought
And rede of bale
Have I for thee.”
Then troth they took
And oath swear betwixt them
That for four years full
Or the War's duration
He should draw and drink
Sid's ration of Rum.
So doom was decreed
For the loss of the liquor.
But Sidni the Storeman
Transferred to the Transport.

THE WATCH DOGS.
LXVIII.
My DEAR CHARLEs, I don't know
that I think so much of these alliances
after all, and I'll tell you why.
When I first heard that my old friend
Italy was in trouble I paraded my
officer at once.
George,” I said, “and tell me what we
, are going to do about it."
“Oh, that 'll be all right,” said he.
“I’ve booked my seat in the train."
I think that George, my subordinate,
sometimes forgets who I am and what
importance attaches to me. I feel that
he ought at least to consult me for-
mally before he decides what instrue-
tions I am going to issue to him. After
all, I am only fifteen years younger
than he is.
“You will proceed forthwith to Italy,”
I said, “and will there study the local
conditions on the spot. You will then
take such action as the occasion seems
to you to demand.” George was clean-
ing out his pipe, so for once he didn't
interrupt. “You will report progress
to me in triplicate.”
George frowned. Having been the
Supreme White Man in some African
district for dozens of years before the
War, all his hair seems to have got into
his eyebrows, and his frown is a terrible
thing to see.
“At any rate,” I said, “you might
just drop me a post-card to tell me how
you're getting on.”
George's eyebrows stood at ease and
then stood easy.
“It’s all very well for you,” I added.
| “But what about me, when it comes
| tototting up your travelling allowances
later on 2"
George has private means, which
work out at about one-and-fourpence,
less income tax, a day. Consequently he
is a little careless about money matters.
“Oh, that 'll be all right,” he said.
:: :: ::: :: ::
George was away for three weeks.
What he did all the time I’m sure I
don't know, though I kept on reporting
to my superiors that the necessary
steps were being taken and the requisite
measures were being initiated. When
he got back he wanted to start in at
once telling me all about it. But I
said no, and insisted on getting down
to the War.
“In making out travelling claims,”
I said, producing the appropriate Army
Form, “care should be taken to comply
with the instructions contained in
the King's Regulations. We have a
quarter of an hour before your break-
fast will be ready. Let us deal with
our more formidable enemies, the Pay
People, first.”

George is the sort of person who
gets you into trouble on the very first
line of any Army Form. Asked as to
his rank, he told me he was a Second
Lieutenant in the Army, temporary
Lieutenant, acting Captain. All these
ranks get a different rate of allowance.
Which of the three was George in fact?
“A man of your age ought to know
better,” I said.
We were half-an-hour late for break-
fast, and even so George hadn't got
to the station of departure, as far as
A.F.O. 1771 was concerned.
I determined to devote the morning
to the matter, clearing the court for
the purpose. Our Mr. Booth, however,
who is intolerably precise and accurate
in these matters, had profited by my
absence at breakfast to collect a folio
of relevant Orders and Instructions,
numbered one to seventy-three con-
secutively.
It all sounds so simple, doesn't it?
You get so many francs a day for
subsistence, and so many francs a
night for accommodation, in France;
so many lire a day for subsistence,
and so many lire a night for accommo-
dation, in Italy. Ah yes, but you don't
know George when he is in action.
Not content with travelling in the
dark, and so subsisting by night when
he ought to be accommodated, and
being accommodated by day when he
ought to be subsisting, he could never
make up his mind to stay in the same
country for two days together. As
to his constant movements from one
country to the other, three times he

had supposed he had finished with
Italy and was due back in France;
each time he had got comfortably
across the frontier into France he
had been recalled to Italy. Never
once had he the sense to cross the
frontier on the stroke of midnight,
and so make a complete twenty-four
hours of it on each side, and all the
time the rate of exchange was varying
by a fraction. But, as George said,
it wasn't himself, who was manipu-
lating the rate of exchange as between
the two countries, and courtesy to
allied nations prevented him from
manipulating the trains.
It was towards teatime when he
satisfied me of his own innocence on
these points; but don't run away with

his silly journey, and how much he had

me the figure, 173 francs, and never

in my expression every time he cleared
his throat to do so. -

I wenT into a shop to buy a trench-
coat. The shopman came forward
with an air which said quite plainly,
“You are a second lieutenant. You
have just obtained a commission from
the ranks. You think you do not want
a complete outfit. It is my business
to show you that you are mistaken.
You want a complete outfit. Your
Sam Browne is second-hand. You
picked your boots up from a Salvage
Dump. Your cap was used once in
your bathroom at home as a sponge-
bag. Your trench-coat is disgusting.
The whole outfit would fail to deceive
a man's maiden aunt, so obvious an
attempt is it to mislead the unsophis-
the idea that by this
time we were well on
with the business. We
had barely as much as
started. How are you
to fix the “date of

ner as to give the travel-

accommodation in one
country, or a clear day
for subsistence in
another, when he leaves
his home at 5.15 P.M.,

That was what his
manner said. What he
actually said was non-
committal. He said,
“Yes, Sir?”
I took off my trench-
coat and let the glory
of three whole stars
dazzle him. He little
knew that one of them
was “acting,” and his
in another hotel? Old soldier though
I am, there didn't seem to me to be
a single line in a single column which
I could satisfactorily fill in. True, there
was the space for “Remarks," but our
Mr. Booth was quite sure that my
remarks were not what the Pay People
called for.
By this time I was for giving in, but
George was now the persistent one. It
was never his pocket he cared for; it
was just one of his confounded prin-
ciples not to be beaten by anything, not
even an Army Form. I expressed some
surprise that in the course of this tour
of duty he had not managed to find his
way to America for an hour or two,
if only to complicate my business with
the dollar question . . .
I read the whole Form again, from
start to finish, including the bit about
vouchers being required for any unusual
expenditure, such as cab-fares of over
ten shillings. I then told George to
hundred and seventy francs for travel-
ling expenses, 30/10/1917 to 20/11/1917,
for tour of duty to Italy.” George said
I had a dashed fine brain to have worked
out the claim ; I told him the Pay Man
had a dashed kind heart to settle it.
I hadn't been able to avoid mentioning
Italy; but for the rest the Pay Man
simply must leave thought that George
had driven all the way to the frontier
and back in cabs and done precious little
duty on the other side of it. Wouldn't

nothing else.”
His face had fallen a little as I spoke.
But it lit up again with a sort of cun-
ning excitement when I said “trench-
coat.” I wondered why—then. Now
I know. I thought that he was baffled
and would say no more, but I had
forgotten the developments of trench
warfare.
“This way, Sir,” said the shopman.
He led me to a room which combined
the architectural style of the Crystal
Palace and Waterloo Station with a
touch of the dentist's waiting-room.
There was a khaki tent in the midst of
it, and he led me towards this with the
air of a broody hen anticipating the
number of her chickens.
“The Wadecumomnibus trench-coat,”
said he.
“But it's a tent,” I protested.
“It has collapsible aluminium centre
seam,” he retorted rapidly, “which
can be used as a tent pole in severe
weather. On buttoning the top button
this pole telescopes automatically and
forms a bullet-proof spine protector.
Each sleeve can be unscrewed and used
in an emergency as a Lewis gun. This
is indispensable—”
“Of course,” I interrupted. “But I
require something quite simple and
straightforward. Just a trench-coat,
you understand.”
“We have here,” he said imme-
diately, “the Gadget coat. It possesses
three hundred button-holes and three
hundred buttons. Every single portion
of the coat can be buttoned on to every
other part at a moment's notice. The
pockets are detachable and can be used
as coffee cups or finger bowls. The
coat itself, when stretched on our
patent aluminium framework, makes
an admirable hip-bath.”
I played nervously in my pocket with
the pin of a live Mills grenade (over-
looked by the A.M.L.O.).
“A simple, straightforward trench-
coat,” I repeated.
“This,” said the shopman, handing
me something very like a slice of plum-
pudding—“this is the cross-section of
a piece of the cloth out of which our

To the dim beauty of imagined things.

THE YOUNGEST GENERATION.
“WHAT shall he have that killed the
deer?” someone asks somebody else in
As You Like It. But there is a better
question than that, and it is this—
“What shall they have that preserve
the little dears?” and the answer (if I
can do anything to influence it) is-
honour and support; for there can be
no doubt that in these critical times,
when the life of the best and bravest
and strongest is so cheap, no duty is
more important than the cherishing of
infancy.
At a Créche in Notting Hill I watched,
the other day, some of this cherishing
in progress, and it was a pleasant and
stimulating sight. The institution was
in existence in a small way before the
War, but it has recently been enlarged
and made scientific, to meet the greater
needs which the War has set up, and
it is now able to act as foster-mother
to seventy mites, from the age of one
month to four years, whose real mothers
are for the most part engaged in war
work. That is a good piece of citizen-
ship, is it not? And to watch it in
being is an education in those wonder-
ful things to the eye of man—the
solicitude and patience and capability
of woman. The noise alone, whether
of joy or of transitory grief, would drive
most men frantic ; but these devoted
souls, knowing that it is all part of the
game, proceed with an unearthly com-
posure through it all—undressing their
charges, dressing them, washing them,
feeding them, beguiling them ; in a
word, tending them, from morning till
evening.
The children begin to arrive, brought
either by their mothers, their “Little
Mothers” (I mean sisters) or their
brothers, between 8 and 9—some in
arms and some in perambulators and
some in go-carts; and then they are
immediately divested of their home
clothes, popped into warm baths three
or four at a time, and dressed in the
clothes belonging to the Créche. For
the rest of the day they wear these
clothes and sleep, eat, play and, when
it amuses them more to do so, cry,
until the time comes to be put back
into their own garments and be taken
away. By some strange instinct their
relations, I am informed, know them
again, and very few mistakes occur;
and so gradually, in the neighbourhood
of seven o'clock, peace descends on this
corner of Notting Hill once more.
The place is sheer Lilliputia; for
everything is on a reduced scale.

it for their little meals. In the centre
of the room are two little pounds, with
railings so close together as not to be
crawled through, where the more ad-
venturous ones can be kept out of mis-
chief in the company of woolly toys;
and outside is a loggia place with little
cradles for the babies who want more
air to sleep in.
Such is the Stoneleigh Street Crèche,
and in order to realise what admirable
and desirable functions it fulfils—
principally by voluntary aid, for the
capitation fee of half-a-crown a week
is, of course, quite insufficient to main-
tain it—one has only to imagine what
the lot of these helpless little creatures
would be if they were left in their
motherless homes. Not only would
they be far less happy but far less
healthy; and it is upon healthy babies
that England's future must be founded.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Those who like to read familiar letters—and I confess
it is one of my favourite literary distractions—will find
matter very much to their mind in Some Hawarden Letters
(NISBET), compiled by L. MARCH-PHILLIPs and BERTRAM
CHRISTIAN. It is a collection of letters addressed to Miss
MARY GLADSTONE before and after her marriage to Mr.
DREw. Sitting at the centre she seems to have held
together her circle by golden threads of confidence and
intimacy. Here you will learn how RUSKIN was brought to
visit Hawarden, and how he entirely altered his views on
Mr. GLADSTONE, going so far as to suppress a number of
Fors Clavigera in which slighting allusion had been made
to him. Here, too, you will find Lord ActoN, who deeply
disapproved of Mr. GLADSTONE's conduct in paying a
memorial tribute of respect and eulogy to Lord BEACons-
FIELD. ACTON's list of the hundred best books (or, to be
strictly accurate, of ninety-nine of them) is also given.
It provides heavy read. T -
ing for a hundred years at
the very least. As a set-
off to this ponderosity
there are the letters of
BURNE-Jones, fresh, ami-
able and delightful, as
also those of Professor
JAMES STUART, which are
among the best in the
collection. Mr. A. J.
BALFour appears as the
owner of four concer-
tinas, on which he was
willing “to play with
anyone who would ac-
company him through
any of the oratorios of
Handel.” RUSKIN writes
to CARLYLE, addressing
him as “Dearest Papa,”
and signing himself
“Ever your faithful and
loving son.”

moment his number, as they say, was up. Apart from
a dog-incident, which is far too prolonged, and some
rather cheap sarcasm at the expense of a wretched spinster,
this tale of John's conversion from something drier than
dust to a human being is neatly told. All the same I
prefer Miss YouNg's South African stories.
My conjecture about The Magic Gate (HUTchINson) is
that its author, MAUD STEPNEY RAwson, found herself with
two stories to choose from, one of the Gate itself, and
another of the romance of Lydia and John Wodrush. In my
opinion she chose the wrong one. The history of the Wod-
rush elopement, compressed to a couple of pages, seems to
me far more original and interesting than the present rather
unwieldy tale. The Magic Gate is a war-novel confessed,
and I can only fancy that the thronging new sensations
of the past three years have proved a little too much for
Mrs. RAwson's sense of form. She is so anxious that her
heroine and her readers shall miss nothing of it all that in
the result the plot is lost in a maze of incidents that lead
- - nowhere. The effect pro-
duced on a small coun-
try society by the early
phases of the War is
shown deftly enough.
But perhaps posterity-
will find in such a record
a more compelling inter-
est than we can to whom
it is still so familiar in
every unforgettable de-
tail. One other ground of
comp'aint I have against
the book is that its most
original and attractive
character, the American
woman to whose gener-
osity Jennet owes her
occupancy of Fullbrook
Manor, is banished at an
early page, and subma-
rined just when I was
looking for her reappear-
ance. Hers is yet another
of GEORGE WYNDHAM are a charming collection, shining
with hope and idealism yet never losing their touch
of the firm earth. This book was nearly completed
by the late Mr. MARCH-PHILLIPs, and after his untimely
death the task was brought to a conclusion by Mr. CHRIS-
TIAN. On the whole the work has been done with great
discretion, but there is a passage relating to GEORGE ELIOT
on pp. 193, 194 which ought to have been omitted.
Miss MILLs YouNG tells us that John Musgrave, the
middle-aged hero of Caelebs (LANE), “was not a prig, but
he came perilously near to being one at times.” Well, if
anyone ought to know, it is his creator, so I will accept her
word for it, though for myself I should have called him a
first-class prig. The little village in which he lived his
bachelor existence was invaded by some up-to-date people
who took the Hall, and proceeded to liven up things.
Mrs. Chadwick freely shocked the poor man; she smoked,
was a reckless conversationalist and had modern ideas,
all which disturbed the decorous manner of his life.
Moreover, she had taken upon herself the heavy task of
finding him a wife, and John's phlegmatic heart began to
flutter when he saw Peggy, her lady-gardener and niece,
standing on a ladder, in blue trousers. He was incensed
by such apparel, but he was also intrigued. From that

story with which Mrs. Rawson might have entertained
me better than by this of The Magic Gate, which I found
a trifle creaky on its hinges. -
Senlis (CoLLINs) is one of the many places that have
been systematically destroyed by the Germans. It is diffi-
cult for anyone who has not seen the results with his own
eyes to realise the business-like thoroughness which the Hun
brings to this congenial task. That a part (and the most
beautiful) of the town still stands does not imply that he
yielded either to slackness or to aesthetic refinement. True
that Miss CICELY HAMILTON relates a pleasing story that
Senlis was saved from utter destruction by the entreaties
of the curé, but, all the same, I think the real reason why
the Bosch did not complete his work was that he was
bundled out bag and baggage before he had time to add
the finishing touches. Miss HAMILTON clearly and soberly
states the case against him, and makes it all the more
damning by her frank recognition that many of the
horrors of war, whoever makes it, are inevitable. Her
delightful account of Senlis itself, admirably illustrated
with photographs, is certain to appeal to all lovers of the
charm of old French towns; and the more poignantly
when they recall how narrowly, the best of its beauty
escaped from the hand of the spoiler.

Decºunce 26, 1917. PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI 435
- - - MR. PUNCH AS PROPAGAN DIST.
I Don't know what decided him to do it. I think he must have been a little fed up with our silly British
way (rather attractive, all the same) of assuming that the whole world is bound to recognise the justice of our
point of view without the use of propaganda to stimulate its intelligence.
Or else he had read somewhere that the Bolsheviks had been flooding the Hun trenches with Socialist
literature and that the German Headquarters Staff had protested against this kind of thing as being contrary
to etiquette, and he thought he couldn't go far wrong if he did something that was contrary to Bosch etiquette.
Anyhow he started off in his Bouverie biplane to distribute a million or so leaflets of his own composition
over the whole expanse of the Fatherland. It has been my privile c to read a sample which he handed to me
just before leaving earth. It runs as follows:– -
“GERMANs—Your Kaiser has taken good care that his Press should keep you in ignorance of the feelings
with which your nation is regarded by the civilized world. I am therefore about to oblige you with a few
home-truths. -
“You have probably heard a rumour that we and our Allies have no quarrel with the German people, but
only with its rulers. Don't you believe a word of it. Possibly we still respected you when the War began, for
we had not guessed how many of you had been looking forward for years to the coming of ‘The Day.’ It is
what we have found out about you since you started fighting that has made us loathe and despise you.
“When, as a nation, you accepted without protest the filthy savagery of your armies in Belgium and other
occupied lands; when even your women were vile in their cruelty to the helpless prisoners you had taken; when
you rang your church bells and waved flags and took holidays for joy of the murder of innocent women and
children, we were not deceived by apologists who explained that your only defect was that you were the slaves
of a brutal militarism (though you were that, all right). We knew that you must have something of the beast
in your hearts. How it got there was another matter; we only knew that it was there and that while it
remained you were not fit for intercourse with decent men. -
“Another thing that you may have heard (for even some of our own statesmen, reputed intelligent, have

said it, and it has no doubt been eagerly seized upon by the officials who control your Press), is that your
form of Government, the particular pattern of tyranny under which you elect to grovel, is no concern of ours.
Well, don't you believe that either. This is no question of private taste, like the cut of your shoulder-pads or
the shape of your women's waists, which are matters of purely local interest. Your type of Government is as
much our concern as the quality of your poison-gas or the composition of the bombs that you drop on our babies.

“I am reminded of the nonsense that used to be talked by responsible statesmen at the time when you

(whatever anybody may say), that
bears immediately upon our relations
with your State is of prime concern to us. Our desire for peace is as
strong as your need of it ; but we cannot afford to make terms with a Government whose word, as we have
proved, is not worth the paper they write it on—who would treat any peace as a mere armistice to give them
breathing-space for preparing a fresh war. No, if you want peace you will have to displace your present
rulers. You are so.good at “substitutes" that you ought to have no difficulty about that.
“And the sooner the better for you. For as this War drags on we are not getting to love you more.
Even now it will take you at least a generation to purge your offence and get back into the community of
civilized nations. But there is another thought that is more likely to affect your thick commercial hides, and it
is this. Unless you take steps, and pretty soon, to put yourselves in a position in which we can treat with you,
you will be boycotted in the markets of the world, and you will go bankrupt. It is for you, the German
people, to decide whether you choose this fate. Meanwhile Time presses and the sands run low.”
Such was the matter of the leaflet that Mr. Punch rained down from his Bouverie biplane (fortunately
invulnerable) upon the cities of the Fatherland. Till now the German people, fed on windy tales of triumph
in place of solid food, had borne their sufferings patiently as trials incident to all wars even when you are told that
you are winning them. This was the first intimation they had received of the facts. For the first time they
had a chance of seeing themselves as others saw them. -
He carried no bombs, but as he flew over Potsdam he could not refrain from letting fall, by way of reprisal,
a weighty souvenir upon the purlieus of the Imperial Palace. Dropped at a venture, there is reason to believe
that it fell within measurable distance of the head-piece of the All-Highest. It was Mr. Punch's
