A FAIRY WENT A-MARKETING.
A FAIRY went a-marketing—
She bought a little fish;
She put it in a crystal bowl
Upon a golden dish;
All day she sat in wonderment
And watched its silver gleam,
And then she gently took it up
And slipped it in a stream.
A fairy went a marketing—
She bought a coloured bird;
It sang the sweetest, shrillest song
That ever she had heard;
She sat beside its painted cage
And listened half the day,
And then she opened wide the door
And let it fly away.
A fairy went a-marketing—
She bought a winter gown
All stitched about with gossamer
And lined with thistledown;
She wore it all the afternoon
With prancing and delight,
• Then gave it to a little frog
To keep him warm at night.
A fairy went a-marketing—
She bought a gentle mouse
To take her tiny messages,
To keep her tiny house;
All day she kept its busy feet
Pit-patting to and fro,
And then she kissed its silken ears,
Thanked it, and let it go. R. F.

istics were gentleness and a soft solici-
tude.
With his eyes searching my very
soul, his whole being alert to respond
to my desire, “What is your pleasure,
Madam 2 " he would ask.
In that distant past, seeing him there
inscrutable behind the bacon machine,
I have fondly imagined that one day
I would answer his question, and, lead.
ing him gently away from his sides of
bacon and his drums of cheese and out
beneath the portcullis of rabbits into
the sunlight, I would show him, in
flights of fancy, all that is my pleasure,
and ask him, was it his, wrapped in
obsequious dignity, to stand and serve.
You see, I wondered. But now—
now I shall never ask that question.
I begin with an ingratiating smile.
“Can you let me have—” I say.
He interrupts me and his voice is
hard and cold. “No butter, no bacon
and no tea,” he says. -
Thero is consciousness of power in
his voice and I seem to wilt under the
glance of contempt with which he dis-
mlSSeS Ine.
“No tea,” he repeats, turning the
knife in the wound.
“I thought you might possibly spare
me—” I dare to begin to suggest.
“Ten to-morrow prompt,” he inter-
rupts authoritatively. “And wait out-
side. You'll find a queue there.” The
note of triumph rings in his voice.
He watches me as I creep out of the
shop, says “Well?” over his shoulder
to the next customer, and lovingly flicks
the dust from the imitation stacks
of tea.
So now I am answered, and it seems
that I alone among all his suppliants
am capable of a sympathetic under-
standing.
After years of unnatural obligeance
(no, I know there isn't, but there ought
to be) can one wonder that he wallows
expands.
I seem to see him there all these
years chained, as he felt, to a vast con-
suming appetite, ministering to insatia-
bility. He saw us all as mouths,
greedy and clamorous, eating into his
life and who knows what high adven-
turous dreams. And he, counter-bound
and stifling in his own politeness, could
do no more than helpfully supply what
these maws demanded.

me how I'd never believe, and wouldn't
credit, and could scarcely imagine the
subterfuges to which the general public
will descend in an endeavour to evade
a wise grocer's liberal rationing. He
waxes wroth over a spoilt, an overfed
and self-indulgent nation.
So now I shall never ask him what
is his pleasure. For I know.
But—I wonder—will he ever again
ask me the old question?

WILFRID'S WAY.
Wilfrid is just a horse—only just.
He has the soul of a cow and the
manners of a mule. He is not even
good to look upon, and his pre-war
occupation must have been something
very civilian indeed. However, he got
into the Army with the first rush and
has been there ever since. He is a
regular old soldier by this time, and it
is doubtful whether he will be able to
settle down again between the shafts of
his growler, or whatever it was, when he
is at last discharged on the cessation of
hostilities. For one thing, he has con-
tracted some loose habits which will be
against him, and picked up so many
artful dodges that he has forgotten the
feeling of work. No respectable Jehu
wards, and it happened. There was a
swift tearing sound, his gas-helmet
satchel was rent asunder, and Wilfrid
switched away with a mouthful of
biscuits, while a large flask toppled
heavily to the ground.
But his interventions are not always
so happy. During the first few months
of his military career he actually ranked
as an officer's charger, because there
was one in the battalion who, entitled
to a horse, was yet no horseman, and
considered himself well enough fixed
with Wilfrid. Then it was that he con-
tracted the drink habit. Not altogether
a stranger to thirst himself, this officer
viewed with sympathy Wilfrid's attrac-
tion to water-troughs, and it soon be-
came quite understood that they dallied
with every one they came to, while the
will tolerate for a moment
his practice of stopping to
drink at every wayside
water-trough, nor indulge
him in his manner of evad-
ing fatigue by going sick
whenever a long journey
is toward; moreover he
will be apt to disorganise si
a busy city street by throw-
ing himself flat on the ºf
ground whenever a motor
car misses fire or an elec-
tric fuse bursts, for he will
certainly take it for a bomb
or something.
Soon after joining the
Army his mind began º
work along egotistical
lines, and his character,
previously amiable and
plastic, took a turn for the
discomfort upon the rider. However,
they progressed, and presently the Se-
cond-in-command called the battalion
to attention, while the Adjutant rode
forward to report all correct.
Then it was noticed there was some-
thing wrong. Instead of halting in
front of the battalion, according to the
C.O.'s very evident intention, they car-
ried straight on, and the pace suddenly
became faster—indeed it was Wilfrid
now who strove to hurry, and the C.O.,
purple in the face and producing other
noises more articulate but not so horse-
manlike, who endeavoured in vain to
pull him up. The pace increased to a
spanking trot. Then all at once those
of the spectators who knew Wilfrid's
way awoke to the situation, and several
mounted officers left their posts and
spurred after him in pur-
suit. Observing his line of
sight they noticed a stag-
of the ground, and to this
ºf was Wilfrid obviously
- bent. Nay, worse. Hear-

take of arguing from the “
particular to the general. Thus he
soon decided that all officers carry
biscuits, some furtively for their own
selfish ends, and others openly for the
delectation of friendly horses, with the
result that he got into the habit of
buttonholing every one within reach,
in order to investigate his possibilities.
His method is simple. Snuffling and
blowing all over the victim's person
until the goods are located, he then
concentrates his nose upon the hiding-
place with a good assurance that the
biscuits will be produced. If you have
none he takes it out of your buttons.
One day the A.D.V.S. inspected the
lines when he was in a bad temper, and
quite inadvertently some trifling mis-
use of Government property got dis-
closed. He immediately seized upon
this as the text for a proper strafe, and
waxed so passionate that he failed to
notice Wilfrid close behind him evinc-
officer smoked cigarettes and Wilfrid
quaffed. This went on daily for some
time until, as the direct consequence of
such an abuse of privilege, the incident
occurred which brought down his head
in sorrow to the ranks.
A battalion parade had been ordered,
and the C.O., discovering at the eleventh
hour that none of his own horses was
available, was forced to make a quick
choice from those still in the lines.
Wilfrid, trying to buttonhole him as he
passed, attracted attention and was
chosen.
On the parade ground the battalion

cond-in-command comparing watches

deep of the noisome beverage, keenly

The first shock disposed of the Colonel,
who disappeared for a moment before
arising, apoplectic and trailing weeds,
like some camouflaged Venus. Wad-
ing ashore, he mounted another horse
and hurried home. Wilfrid had a good
dip, threshed his way to land, shook
himself thoroughly and trotted jauntily
off in the direction of the lines, while
the Second-in-command went back to
dismiss the parade.
Wilfrid has been a pack-horse ever

AN ouTSIDER's MENTAL PICTURE OF THE MEANING OF THE NEWSPAPER PHRASE, “A SENSATION WAS CAUSED IN SOCIETY CIRCLES.”
TO A WAR-TIME PLUM-PUDDING.
PRINCE of all puddings, one time redolent That I who once leapt
Of Orient spices magically blent
With peel that was a poignant memory
blithely to the attack
Should, like a pallid schoolgirl, hang me back,
Running dank digits through my troubled hair,
Of terraced orchards sloping to the sea; And roll my . and mutter, “Give me air!”
Fulfilled of currants fresh from Zante's crates,
Raisins of Seville and delicious dates
From groves that ancient Tigris sprawls upon,
And figs that grew on cedared Lebanon;
Whose generous girth proclaimed, concealed within, Of prunes and treacle ;
Almonds of Jordan whiter than the skin
Of moon-faced houris fresh from Paradise,
And half-a-pint of brandy of great price—
Oh, I have loved thee, Pudding, and my joy
Was to walk into thee, a care-free boy,
While sobbing parents bade me give it best,
Saying no human ostrich could digest
So many or such helpings; sisters wept,
Fearing the worst; but I, unheeding, leapt
Hard on thy unbreached flank, crying, “On 1 Sir Duff,
And cursed be he who cannot hold enough !”
Age could not dim my ardour; skilled it not
How monstrous thou emergedst from the pot,
Or if thy heart were dour as driven lead—
I simply took my spoon and laid thee dead.
And all through Maida Vale my fame went forth,
And sporting uncles living in the North
Gathered about the festive board to view
The struggle, laying bets of five to two
That all my steam was gone, my footwork slow,
And fourteen rounds were more than I could go. And all of forty inches
Alas! alas! I little thought I should

Had scarcely paused till thou wast stowed away.

Thou art no more plum-pudding, but a mess
thy false curves conceal
Ground rice and grated carrots and the meal
That thrifty Scots devour. They bore thee in
With holly stuck in thy deceptive skin
And set thee down, unfit for man or brute,
A stodge, a fraud, a Hunnish “substitute.”
I gazed upon thee with a practised eye,
Prepared to pluck an easy victory;
We closed, and in one hideous trice I knew
That Whipcord Smith had met his Waterloo.
And they who gathered to the historic feast,
Deeming me good for thirteen rounds at least,
Talked of foul play and called the thing absurd
When I was going groggy in the third,
And heaped abuse on my defeated head
As I was being lifted into bed.
Enough, since I am called upon to make
This bitter sacrifice for
But some day, when the hateful strife is o'er,
Thou shalt be for it, pudding, as of yore;
Fruited and spiced and sugared thou shalt come,

FREE MEALS.
WHEN WILLIAM had not crossed the
1&hine
And food could still be found,
How often did we all decline,
If someone asked us out to dine,
Upon the smallest ground !
Because his talk was imbecile,
Because his face was plain,
One used to miss the loveliest meal
And not get asked again.
Less oft to-day do men endow
Their famished friends with food;
Free dinners are free dinners now,
And to refuse, as all allow,
Is rather mad than rude;
While prudent folk, with frank delight,
Both indigent and rich,
When asked “to come and dine some
night,”
Make answer, “Thank you; which 3"
My old friend Hubert, like some bee,
From host to host doth flit
For dinner, lunch and even tea
(I do believe he'd breakfast free
If he could manage it);
Till, having drained all other flowers
And reached an anxious point,
He flies to Streatham and devours
His Aunt Jane's Sunday joint.
In olden days he only knew
Those in the social swim,
But now he takes a broader view
And feeds with all (though very few
Have ever fed with him);
Only, I think, he has a doubt,
Only the world looks gray,
When different people ask him out
To dinner on one day. .
And surely thus shall strife conclude
When rations get so small
That peers with peasantry have chewed
And men are glad to take their food
With anyone at all; -
Though, at the worst, I don't expect
The War will thus be done:
A starving world would still object
To eating with the Hun. A. P. H.
THE MUD LARKS.
No one, with the exception of the
Bosch, has a higher admiration for the
scrapping abilities of the Scot than I
have, but in matters musical we do not
hear ear to ear. It is not that I have
no soul; I have. I fairly throb with
it. I rise in the mornings trilling trifles
of Moncktos and croon myself to sleep
o' nights with snatches of NovelLo.
I do not wish to boast, but to hear
me pick the “Moonlight Sonata” out
of a piano with one hand (the other
strapped behind my back) is an unfor-
gettable experience.
himself on the comb, bones or Jew's-
harp, and I could give A. GABRIEI, a run
for his money on the coach-horn. But
these bagpipes |
It is not so much the execution of
the bagpiper that I object to as his re-
stricted repertoire. He can only play
one noise. It is quite useless a Scot ex-
plaining to me that this is the “Lament
of Sandy Macpherson" and that the
“Dirge of Hamish MacNish;" it all
sounds the same to me.
The brigade of infantry that is camped
in front of my dug-out (“Mon Repos")
is a Scots brigade. Not temporary
Scots from the Highlands of Commis-
sioner Street, Jo'burg, and Hastings
Street, Vancouver (about whom I have
nothing to say), but real pukka, law-
abiding, kirk-going, God-fearing, bayo-
net-pushing Gaels, bred among the
crags of the Grampians and reared on
thistles and illicit whuskey. And every
second man in this brigade is a con-
firmed bagpiper. -
They have massed pipes for break-
fast, lunch, tea and dinner; pipes-solos
before, during and after drinks. If one
of them goes across the road to borrow
a box of matches a piper goes with
him raising Cain. Their Officers' Mess
is situated just behind “Mon Repos,”
so we live in the orchostra stalls, so
to speak, and hear all there is to be
heard.
One evening, while Sandy Macpher-
son's (or Hamish MacNish's) troubles
were being very poignantly aired next
door, Albert Edward came to the con-
clusion that the limit had been reached.
“They've been killing the pig steadily
for ten days and nights now,” said
he ; “something's got to be done
about it.” -
“I’m with you,” said I; “but what
are we two against a whole brigade?
If they were to catch you pushing an
impious pin into one of their sacred
joy-bags there'd be another Second
Lieutenant missing.” - -
“Desist and let me think,” said
Albert Edward, and for the next hour
he lay on his bed rolling and groaning
—the usual signs that his so-called
brain is active.
The following morning he rode over
to the squadron, returning later with
the Mess gramophone and a certain
record. There are records and records,
but for high velocity, armour-piercing
and range this one bangs Banagher.
It is a gem out of that “sparkling galaxy
of melody, mirth and talent” (Press
Agent speaking), “I Don't Think,”
which scintillates nightly at the Frivo-
lity Theatre.
“When the Humming-birds are sing-
ing” is the title thereof, and Miss Birdie
alone can, in a voice like a file chafing
corrugated iron.
We started the birds humming at
4 P.M., and let it rip steadily until
11.15 P.M., only stopping to change
needles.
Albert Edward's batman unleashed
the hubbub again at six next morning;
my batman relieved him at eight, and
so on throughout the day in two-hour
shifts. At night the line guards carried
on. The following morning, as our
batmen threatened to report sick, we
crimed a trooper for “dumb insolence”
and made him expiate his sin by tend-
ing the gramophone. O'Dwyer, of one
the neighbouring ammunition columns,
came over in the aſternoon to complain
that his mules couldn't get a wink of
sleep and were muttering among them-
selves; but we gave him a bottle of
whiskey and he went away quietly.
Monk of the other column called an
hour later to ask if we wanted to draw
shell-fire; but we bought him off with
a snaffle bit and a bottle of hair lotion.
The whole neighbourhood grew res-
tive. Somebody under cover of the dark
took a pot at the gramophone with a
revolver and winged it in the trumpet.
Even the placid observation balloon
which floats above our camp grew
nasty and dropped binoculars and sex-
tants on us. We built a protective
breastwork of sand-bags about it and
carried on. As for ourselves we didn't
mind the racket in the least, having
taken the precaution of corking our
ears with gunners' wax.
Then one evening we discovered a
Highland bomber worming up a drain
on his stomach towards our instrument.
Cornered, he excused himself on the
plea that it was a form of Swedish
exercise he always took at twilight
for the benefit of his digestion. An
ingenious explanation, but it hardly
covered the live Mills bomb he was
endeavouring to conceal in a fold of his
kilt. We drove him away with a barrage
of peg-mallets; but secretly we were
very elated, for it was clear that the
strain was telling on the hardy Scot.
As a precautionary measure we now
surrounded the gramophone with a
barbed wire entanglement, and so we
carried on.
Next day we saw a score of kiltie
officers grouped outside their Mess,
heads together, apparently in earnest
consultation. Every now and again
they would turn and glaro darkly in
our direction.
“The white chiefs hold heap big
palaver over yonder,” Albert Edward
remarked. “They're tossing up now

* WILFRID'S WAY.
Wilfrid is just a horse—only just.
He has the soul of a cow and the
manners of a mule. He is not even
good to look upon, and his pre-war
occupation must have been something
very civilian indeed. However, he got
into the Army with the first rush and
has been there ever since. He is a
regular old soldier by this time, and it
is doubtful whether he will be able to
settle down again between the shafts of
his growler, or whatever it was, when he
is at last discharged on the cessation of
hostilities. For one thing, he has con-
tracted some loose habits which will be
against him, and picked up so many
artful dodges that he has forgotten the
wards, and it happened. There was a discomfort upon the rider. However,
swift tearing sound, his gas-helmet
satchel was rent asunder, and Wilfrid
switched away with a mouthful of
biscuits, while a large flask toppled
heavily to the ground.
But his interventions are not always
so happy. During the first few months
of his military career he actually ranked
as an officer's charger, because there
was one in the battalion who, entitled
to a horse, was yet no horseman, and
considered himself well enough fixed
with Wilfrid. Then it was that he con-
tracted the drink habit. Not altogether
a stranger to thirst himself, this officer
viewed with sympathy Wilfrid's attrac-
tion to water-troughs, and it soon be-
came quite understood that they dallied
feeling of work. No respectable Jehu' with every one they came to, while the
will tolerate for a moment
his practice of stopping to
drink at every wayside
water-trough, nor indulge
him in his manner of evad-
ing fatigue by going sick
whenever a long journey
is toward; moreover he
will be apt to disorganise
a busy city street by throw-
ing himself flat on the
ground whenever a motor
car misses fire or an elec-
tric fuse bursts, for he will
certainly take it for a bomb
or something.
Soon after joining the
Army his mind began to
work along egotistical
lines, and his character,
previously amiable and
plastic, took a turn for the
worse. He made the mis-
take of arguing from the
Countryman. “Look 'ERE, MISTER, You R THREE-MINUTE coBF-cCRE AIN'T
DONE ME A BIT O' GOOD."
Quack. “AIN'T IT? WELL, I REckon You Rs AIN'T A THREE-MINUTE
COUGH."
they progressed, and presently the Se-
cond-in-command called the battalion
to attention, while the Adjutant rode
forward to report all correct.
Then it was noticed there was some-
thing wrong. Instead of halting in
front of the battalion, according to the
C.O.'s very evident intention, they car-
ried straight on, and the pace suddenly
became faster—indeed it was Wilfrid
now who strove to hurry, and the C.O.,
purple in the face and producing other
noises more articulate but not so horse-
manlike, who endeavoured in vain to
pull him up. The pace increased to a
spanking trot. Then all at once those
of the spectators who knew Wilfrid's
way awoke to the situation, and several
mounted officers left their posts and
spurred after him in pur.

nant pond at the other side
of the ground, and to this
was Wilfrid obviously
bent. Nay, worse. Hear-

self to be one of a party
now, he broke into an ex-
cited gallop which brought
him to the edge of the pond

nearest rescuer. The C.O.

particular to the general. Thus he
soon decided that all officers carry
biscuits, some furtively for their own
selfish ends, and others openly for the
delectation of friendly horses, with the
result that he got into the habit of
buttonholing every one within reach,
in order to investigate his possibilities.
His method is simple. Snuffling and
blowing all over the victim's person
until the goods are located, he then
concentrates his nose upon the hiding-
place with a good assurance that the
biscuits will be produced. If you have
none he takes it out of your buttons.
One day the A.D.W.S. inspected the
lines when he was in a bad temper, and
quite inadvertently some trifling mis-
use of Government property got dis-
closed. He immediately seized upon
this as the text for a proper strafe, and

quaffed. This went on daily for some
time until, as the direct consequence of
such an abuse of privilege, the incident
occurred which brought down his head
in sorrow to the ranks.
A battalion parade had been ordered,
and the C.O., discovering at the eleventh
hour that none of his own horses was
available, was forced to make a quick
choice from those still in the lines.
Wilfrid, trying to buttonhole him as he
passed, attracted attention and was
chosen.
On the parade ground the battalion

like some camouflaged Venus. Wad-

TO A WAR-TIME
PRINCE of all puddings, one time redolent
Of Orient spices magically blent
With peel that was a poignant memory
Of terraced orchards sloping to the sea;
Fulfilled of currants fresh from Zante's crates,
Raisins of Seville and delicious dates
From groves that ancient Tigris sprawls upon,
And figs that grew on cedared Lebanon;
Whose generous girth proclaimed, concealed within,
Almonds of Jordan whiter than the skin
Of moon-faced houris fresh from Paradise,
And half-a-pint of brandy of great price—
Oh, I have loved thee, Pudding, and my joy
Was to walk into thee, a care-free boy,
While sobbing parents bade me give it best,
Saying no human ostrich could digest
So many or such helpings; sisters wept,
Fearing the worst; but I, unheeding, leapt
Hard on thy unbreached flank, crying, “On 1 Sir Duff,
And cursed be he who cannot hold enough 1”
Age could not dim my ardour; skilled it not
How monstrous thou emergedst from the pot,
Or if thy heart were dour as driven lead—
I simply took my spoon and laid thee dead.
And all through Maida Vale my fame went forth,
And sporting uncles living in the North
Gathered about the festive board to view
The struggle, laying bets of five to two -
That all my steam was gone, my footwork slow,
And fourteen rounds were more than I could go.
Alas! alas! I little thought I should
PLUM-PUDDING.
That I who once leapt blithely to the attack
Should, like a pallid schoolgirl, hang me back,
Running dank digits through my troubled hair,
And roll my . and mutter, “Give me air!”
After three helpings—I who in my day
Had scarcely paused till thou wast stowed away.
The reason 2 Ah! it is not hard to guess:
Thou art no more plum-pudding, but a mess
Of prunes and treacle; thy false curves conceal
Ground rice and grated carrots and the meal
That thrifty Scots devour. They bore thee in
With holly stuck in thy deceptive skin
And set thee down, unfit for man or brute,
A stodge, a fraud, a Hunnish “substitute.”
I gazed upon thee with a practised eye,
Prepared to pluck an easy victory;
We closed, and in one hideous trice I knew
That Whipcord Smith had met his Waterloo.
And they who gathered to the historic feast,
Deeming me good for thirteen rounds at least,
Talked of foul play and called the thing absurd
When I was going groggy in the third,
And heaped abuse on my defeated head
As I was being lifted into bed.
Enough, since I am called upon to make
This bitter sacrifice for England's sake.
But some day, when the hateful strife is o'er,
Thou shalt be for it, pudding, as of yore;
Fruited and spiced and sugared thou shalt come,
And all of forty inches round the tum,
And I will do thee in, even to the utmost crumb.

FREE MEALS.
WHEN WILLIAM had not crossed the
l{hine
And food could still be found,
How often did we all decline, .
If someone asked us out to dine,
Upon the smallest ground !
Because his talk was imbecile,
Because his face was plain,
One used to miss the loveliest meal
And not get asked again.
Less oft to-day do men endow
Their famished friends with food;
Free dinners are free dinners now,
And to refuse, as all allow,
Is rather mad than rude;
While prudent folk, with frank delight,
Both indigent and rich,
When asked “to come and dine some
night,”
Make answer, “Thank you; which 3"
My old friend Hubert, like some bee,
From host to host doth flit
For dinner, lunch and even tea
(I do believe he'd breakfast free
If he could manage it);
Till, having drained all other flowers
And reached an anxious point,
He flies to Streatham and devours
His Aunt Jane's Sunday joint.
In olden days he only knew
Those in the social swim,
But now he takes a broader view
And feeds with all (though very few
Have ever fed with him);
Only, I think, he has a doubt,
Only the world looks gray,
When different people ask him out
To dinner on one day. . .
And surely thus shall strife conclude
When rations get so small
That peers with peasantry have chewed
And men are glad to take their food
With anyone at all;
Though, at the worst, I don't expect
The War will thus be done:
A starving world would still object
To eating with the Hun. A. P. H.
THE MUD LARKS.
No one, with the exception of the
Bosch, has a higher admiration for the
scrapping abilities of the Scot than I
have, but in matters musical we do not
hear ear to ear. It is not that I have
no soul; I have. I fairly throb with
it. I rise in the mornings trilling trifles
of MoxcKTON and croon myself to sleep
o' nights with snatches of NovelLo.

gettable experience.
himself on the comb, bones or Jew's-
harp, and I could give A. GABRIEI, a run
for his money on the coach-horn. But
these bagpipes'
It is not so much the execution of
the bagpiper that I object to as his re-
stricted repertoire. He can only play
one noise. It is quite useless a Scot ex-
plaining to me that this is the “Lament
of Sandy Macpherson" and that the
“Dirge of Hamish MacNish;" it all
sounds the same to me.
The brigade of infantry that is camped
in front of my dug-out (“Mon Repos")
is a Scots brigade. Not temporary
Scots from the Highlands of Commis-
sioner Street, Jo'burg, and Hastings
Street, Vancouver (about whom I have
nothing to say), but real pukka, law-
abiding, kirk-going, God-fearing, bayo-
net-pushing Gaels, bred among the
crags of the Grampians and reared on
thistles and illicit whluskey. And every
second man in this brigade is a con-
firmed bagpiper. -
They have massed pipes for break-
fast, lunch, tea and dinner; pipes-solos
before, during and after drinks. If one
of them goes across the road to borrow
a box of matches a piper goes with
him raising Cain. Their Officers' Mess
is situated just behind “Mon Repos,”
so we live in the orchestra stalls, so
to speak, and hear all there is to be
heard.
One evening, while Sandy Macpher-
son's (or Hamish MacNish's) troubles
were being very poignantly aired next
door, Albert Edward came to the con-
clusion that the limit had been reached.
“They've been killing the pig steadily
for ten days and nights now,” said
he ; “something's got to be done
about it.” -
“I’m with you,” said I; “but what
are we two against a whole brigade 2
If they were to catch you pushing an
impious pin into one of their sacred
joy-bags there'd be another Second
Lieutenant missing.” -
“Desist and let me think,” said
Albert Edward, and for the next hour
he lay on his bed rolling and groaning
—the usual signs that his so-called
brain is active.
The following morning he rode over
to the squadron, returning later with
the Mess gramophone and a certain
record. There are records and records,
but for high velocity, armour-piercing
and range this one bangs Banagher.
It is a gem out of that “sparkling galaxy
of melody, mirth and talent" (Press
Agent speaking), “I Don't Think,”
which scintillates nightly at the Frivo-
lity Theatre.
“When the Humming-birds are sing-
ing” is the title thereof, and Miss Birdie
alone can, in a voice like a file chaſing
corrugated iron.
We started the birds humming at
4 P.M., and let it rip steadily until
11.15 P.M., only stopping to change
needles. -
Albert Edward's batman unleashed
the hubbub again at six next morning;
my batman relieved him at eight, and
so on throughout the day in two-hour
shifts. At night the line guards carried
on. The following morning, as our
batmen threatened to report sick, we
crimed a trooper for “dumb insolence”
and made him expiate his sin by tend-
ing the gramophone. O'Dwyer, of one
the neighbouring ammunition columns,
came over in the afternoon to complain
that his mules couldn't get a wink of
sleep and were muttering among them-
selves; but we gave him a bottle of
whiskey and he went away quietly.
Monk of the other column called an
hour later to ask if we wanted to draw
shell-fire; but we bought him off with
a snaffle bit and a bottle of hair lotion.
The whole neighbourhood grew res-
tive. Somebody under cover of the dark
took a pot at the gramophone with a
revolver and winged it in the trumpet.
Even the placid observation balloon
which floats above our camp grew
nasty and dropped binoculars and sex-
tants on us. We built a protective
breastwork of sand-bags about it and
carried on. As for ourselves we didn't
mind the racket in the least, having
taken the precaution of corking our
ears with gunners' wax.
Then one evening we discovered a
Highland bomber worming up a drain

I lay in the grass and waited for the

The deputation picked his way round

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 2, 1918.
THE QUEEN OF THE ADRIATIC.
IT would not matter about meeting
Houlton every now and then in the
street, the train or a lunching-place, if
I had not chanced to run across him
a few summers ago in Venice; nor
would it matter about having run
across him a few summers ago in
Venice if I did not now chance to meet
him every now and then in London.
But, after the recent Italian reverse,
the concatenation is getting rather
deadly.
The trouble is that our acquaint-
anceship is of strictly Venetian origin.
It was of the slightest even then,
consisting chiefly in Houlton and his
wife, after breakfast, asking me the
way to some church or palace, and
in my answers—by virtue of which
I acquired in their eyes, all unwar-
ranted, an authority amounting to in-
spiration. It used to amuse me to
think how easily such reputations can
be acquired: “To have been there be-
fore" is almost the golden rule; but it
doesn't amuse me any longer. I meet
Houlton too often.
Before the Italian débâcle we merely
or ask each other when the War would
be over and shake our heads sapiently,
with inscrutable smiles, in reply, and
get disentangled as quickly as possible.
But since the Germans reinforced the
Austrians and assailed the Friulian plain
there is no getting rid of Houlton like
that. He buttonholed me on the very
next day and began the new campaign
by remarking mournfully, in subdued
tones, almost as though we were in
the room below the body, that we
should never meet on the Giudecca
again. It was there that we had first
met, in a pension kept, I regret to say,
by a German's widow (I regret, of
course, not that she was a widow, but
that she was a German at all), and it
is there, no doubt—but “under entirely
new management"—that he had been
hoping to meet me once more. But
with the onset of the Huns that hope
seemed to be extinguished. Houlton
had already surrendered Venice; not
only was her fall a foregone conclusion,
but her total destruction too. He had
been in his last gondola, eaten his last
scampi, fed his last pigeon under the
camera's eye. |
Such is the authority with which, as

the expression of the fact that I per-
sonally intended to take a much less
gloomy view immediately restored his
buoyancy.
“Then you do really think,” he
concluded a long series of Venetian
reminiscences—“you do really think
my wife and I may venture to look
forward to another holiday there?
That is wonderful. You have no idea
how you have cheered me.”
Next day he cornered me again and
wanted to know if I knew whether all
the Tintorettos (he hesitated between
Tintorettos and Tintoretti and finally
rested on Tintorettos) had been taken
away and concealed in places of safety.
A man at the Bank had told him that
that was so; but he could not feel any
confidence about it until he had my
corroboration. Again I sent him away
with a mind at ease.
At our next meeting, in the rain, in
Threadneedle Street, he stopped me to
recall the Armenian monastery on the
island on the way to the Lido.
“If the enemy gets Venice,” he
asked, “will those Armenians be mas-
sacred too?”
“Surely,” I said, “there would not be

used to pass the time of day, or nod,
such an atrocity as that. It is the

Turks who massacre Armenians, not
the Germans or Austrians.”
“But they're all Allies,” he replied,
dwelling fondly on the worst.
“True,” I said, “but I am prepared
to bet—supposing, which I doubt, that
Venice falls—that that little colony of
scholars is spared.”
He went away with tears of gratitude
in his eyes, as though it were my per-
sonal exercise of clemency that had
done it, and I had the feeling that he
would catch an earlier train home that
evening to bear the glad news.
The next time, so far as I can remem.
ber, was at BIRCH's, and he came over
to my table to ask if I thought VER-
Rocchio's statue of CoILEONI was all
right. After the bomb which had fallen
some weeks before on the Ospedale
close by, the Italians surely would
have wished to move it. But the fear
troubled him that it might be too heavy
to move. -
I agreed that it would be heavy, but,
since the statue had been brought
there and set up, obviously it could be
taken down and removed. That which
man has done man can do; and so on.
This struck him as a novel idea, and
he was again enormously relieved.
“After all," I said, “there is no reason
to suppose the Italians any less keen
about preserving their treasures than
| other nations are.”
He thanked me warmly and with-
drew.
Last week I met him again, full of
fresh forebodings about our Venice's
fate. By “our Venice" he meant his
and mine. The advantages gained by
the enemy here and there on the Italian
line had depressed him anew. The
evening before, he said, Mrs. Houlton
and he had spent two melancholy but
delightful hours looking through their
Venetian photographs and re-living
their happy Venetian fortnight. How
tragic to think that never would they
see those beautiful things again—the
Doges' Palace, the Bridge of Sighs,
St. Mark's, the Campanile.
Again I reassured him, and he told
me of the joy that would be Mrs.
Houlton's on hearing my words. But
his pleasure will be of very short
duration, and the bore will recom-
mence; for Houlton is one of those
people whose minds move in circles.
Meanwhile I am, oddly enough, begin-
ning really to want to meet him again
in Venice. I know of a secluded, dark
and very deep part of the Grand Canal
which was absolutely made for him.

How Dorty Doddles as a name for a person originated
is not quite clear. The best and most probable account of
the incident is this. It happened in the reign of the third
female tyrant of the nursery, on a New Year's Day a good
many years ago. The third tyrant had been behaving very
riotously, having even gone so far as to refuse to put on
her nightgown; had slapped her Prime Minister, the nurse,
on the cheek—not a violent slap, but an unmistakable one,
and had then careered round the nursery without a vestige
of clothing. The nurse had appealed in vain to the tyrant's
better feelings, and the two preceding tyrants, who had
each in turn been deprived of their tyrannical privileges by
the advent of a successor, had then joined forces with
number three, and the nurse had assured them all that
their parents had far too many naughty daughters.
This saying had been rapturously received, and they had
all shouted, “Naughty daughters,” in chorus as loudly and
as well as they could. In the case of the reigning tyrant
this had gone no further than shouting “Dorty Doddles”
at the top of her voice. When later on her male parent
had come in to tuck her up in bed he found to his surprise
that a new demand was made upon him. He was asked
insistently to tell her “all about Dorty Doddles.” He as-
sumed that these mystic words were the name of a person,
and told his story accordingly, and this is how it ran:—
“Dorty Doddles was a little girl of extraordinary good-
ness and kindness who lived by herself in a little cottage
near a wood. She had once had a mother, but her mother

day Dorty Doddles sought for her
mother, and every day she sought in
vain. But she was a brave little girl
and continued her search in spite of all
disappointments.
“One morning Dorty Doddles set
out quite early on her quest. She had
not gone very far when she found her-
self walking along a path that was new
to her, but she stepped boldly on in
spite of a feeling that some adventure
was about to happen. Suddenly two
huge St. Bernard dogs came bounding
along to meet her. Dorty Doddles held
up her hand and the dogs stopped and
wagged their tails. ‘We are not really
dogs,' said one of them, “but we are a
King and Queen who have been changed
into this shape by the wiles of a wicked
magician, and we cannot be restored to
our true selves until a little girl has
blown a blast on the silver bugle that
hangs above the castle gateway. “That
will I do,” said Dorty Doddles, and they
all walked on very happily together.
“They had not gone much further
when, lo and behold, two white pussy-
cats with bushy tails came leaping
along the path, and Dorty Doddles
again held up her hand, and the cats
stopped. “We are not really cats,” said
one of them, “but we are a Prince and
Princess who have been enchanted by
a wicked magician, and we cannot be
changed back until a little girl blows
a blast on the silver bugle that hangs
above the castle gateway.'
“So these two joined the procession
and all walked on together.
“Soon afterwards two large blue
birds came sailing through the air
towards them and announced them-
selves as a Duke and Duchess who had
fallen into the power of the wicked
magician and were unable to cast off
their plumage until a blast had been
blown on the silver trumpet.
“At last they arrived at the castle
gateway and there, lo and behold, high
up above the great arch hung the silver
bugle on a golden hook. “Alas', said

But the birds soon eased her mind. They seized her
by her leather belt, flapped their great wings and soared
into the air with her until she was able to take the
bugle from its hook. Then she put it to her lips and
blew a resounding note, and the birds came down
gently and placed her again upon the earth. When she
looked round, dogs, cats and birds had vanished, and in
their place stood a King and Queen, robed in purple, a
Prince and Princess of unmatchable beauty, and a Duke
and Duchess of considerable dignity. All were very happy
and invited Dorty Doddles to stay with them for many
years. But Dorty Doddles could not accept this invitation
since she had to look for her mother. So she went home
quietly, taking with her a casket of diamonds and rubies
and the silver bugle which had done such wonderful things.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“ALADDIN.”
ONE should approach the discussion
of a Drury Lane Hardy Annual with
the reverence due to a British Institu-
tion. If it doesn't satisfy you, you
must look for the fault in yourself or
your environment—advancing years,
imperfect digestion, the Duration or
what not. I must try to let this thought
govern my attitude in regard to Aladdin.
Frankly, I found it on the dull side,
with little of mechanical novelty, no
new thrill of situation, and scarcely
a single fresh wheeze. I remember
only one attempt to tell a funny story;
it was about a dog and a Daddy—and it
was old and not very good for children to
hear. There were some passable songs,
but there was hardly any good singing;
and the dances were not so brilliant as
to justify the introduction of dummies
in ridicule of the art of another Hall of
Mirth. The chief source of spontaneous
laughter was primeval; it was the merry
Widow Twankay's habit of taking up,
with studied inadvertence, a sitting
posture on the unresilient floor.
Excellent work was done by the
scene-painters and the schemers of
colour; but the beauty of the set pieces
was nearly always damaged by the in-
| tervention of some grotesque figure
that let it down. The device of contrast,
so admirable when employed intelli-
gently—as between the dignity of the
Slave of the Lamp and the buffoonery
of the Slave of the Iting—was here
merely abused. By the way, you may
have wondered why it was that the
two Slaves, each practically omnipotent
in the original, should have been so
distinct in their methods; why the Slave
of the Lamp could raise a palace for
Aladdin with a wave of his hand,
while the other had to busy himself,
with such masterly, futility, over the
|
contemptibly practical details of planks
and scaffolding. The explanation is
easy. The scene-shifters, though very
fleet at their job, were not fabulous
wizards; and something had to be done
at the front to keep us quiet while the
great labour battalion was putting up
its dome behind the scene.
The authorship of the text is as-
cribed to Messrs. F. ANSTEY, FRANK
Dix and ARTHUR Collins. I can only
guess what share was taken by each;
but I seemed to recognise Mr. ANSTEY's
hand in the diction of the genie of the
lamp, in the Gilbertian humour of the
Emperor of China, and in that general
freedom from inconsequence which is
the mark of the logical mind. For my-
self, I could have desired a little more
irresponsibility. The solitary advantage
|
formance of a thread-bare theme is
that you have no difficulty, as with a
Revue, in following the plot, and can
afford to have any number of dis-
tractions. ' Yet in a Revue they give
you all sorts of side-shows totally un-
related to the main issue (if any), and
here there was very little diversion
that did not arise out of the tale and
its traditional distortions. -
In the dialogue we had some clever
making of bricks without much straw;
but very few topical chances were
taken. Still, I hope that the many
officers in the audience gathered from
the allusions to butter and margarine
that we are bearing our terrible trials
at home with a fortitude worthy of the
race.

gallant and clean - limbed Aladdin.
Mr. STANLEY LUPINo, as the Widow
Twankay, bore the brunt of the attack
with remorseless humour. The fact that
his wounds were mostly behind is no
reflection on his indomitable courage.
Mr. WILL EVANs, as the Slave of the
Ring, was more reticent, but there was
much eloquence in his face. The
Abanazar of Mr. Robert HALE was a
joyous rogue; and Mr. HARRY CLAFF
made an admirable Emperor of China,
with a nice sense of the absurdities
of Opera.
I don't know what became of the
Harlequinade, as I left after the Na-

whose show it's supposed to be, mis-
take quantity for quality. But to me,
who come somewhere between the two
childhoods, it seemed that there was
scarcely a single scene which would not
have been the better for rationing.
And this brings me back to my intro-
duction. If there is fault to find I
must believe that it lies with me and
the peevishness of middle age. O. S

Above a score of years ago, -

Its alternating ebb and flow,
I thought extremely comme-il-faut,
And strove the instrument to handle;
But now for doggerel bards I know
The Ballade game's not worth the

If steeped in roguery and crime,
As WILLON was, or schooled by woe,
You may upon this ladder climb
To an immortal afterglow ;
But if your life be staid and slow,
Unruffled by the breath of scandal,
This is a fruitless field to hoe—
The Ballade game's not worth the

It isn't played in pantomime;
The Georgians label it “old clo',”
And leading prophets of our time,

And wearers of the bare-foot sandal,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
As a War Correspondent Mr. G. WARD PRICE has two
great merits: he gets his effects without indulging in
flowery language, and he does not congratulate himself
upon making his way into places where he had no right to
be. His book, The Story of the Salonica Army (Hodder
AND STOUGHTON), will once and for all (let us, at any rate,
hope) stop the tongues of those who twaddle that our
troops in Macedonia are having a picnic. “If it were a
picnic,” Mr. PRICE says, “one can only say that people out
there keep extraordinarily quiet about the good time they
are supposed to be having, and show praiseworthy self-
sacrifice in trying to get away from it and back to the
Western front.” Ignoring the natural difficulties of the
country, the lack of railways, of decent roads and of
practically all the necessities of quick campaigning, our
arm-chair critics have spoken of the Salonica Army as if it
had nothing to do but amuse itself. Actually, in spite of
everything, flies, Bulgars, mosquitoes, malaria, our men
have done marvellously well, and have grasped every oppor-
tunity that has come their way. When one remembers
that for a long time the Greeks were an uncertain quantity
and might at any moment have attacked us from behind,
one does not wonder at the care with which General SARRAIL
had to plan every move. As to the original undertaking
for and against, and leaves his readers to settle the question
for themselves. But when I remember how often the
All-highest has stated that he was going to hurl the Allied
troops into the sea, I fancy they must be a considerable
stumbling-block in the way of Teutonic ambitions. And
for my own part I salute gratefully these Allied armies who
have performed a thankless task with so great efficiency
and courage and reticence, and also thank Mr. PRICE for
having given us just the book for which those of us who
want to know before we criticise were waiting.
Military experts will tell you that this is a “Q.” war,
meaning thereby that the Quartermaster-General's depart-
ment is the one which matters. “Intelligence,” however,
is not without interest, and as to that some say one thing
and some say another, but all are agreed that it is very
mysterious and alluring. Mr. MAx PEMBERTON makes the
most of it in his ruthlessly exciting story, Her Wedding
Night (JENRINs). It would require some expert Secret
Servant to tell us whether there is any truth at the back
of it or not; I should say that there is at least a little,
notwithstanding that people begin whipping out pistols on
page 3 of it. Of the other stories in the book, “The Lady
of the Waxen Flower,” which deals with Intelligence nearer
“the field,” is no less exciting, but is much less convincing.
Those who are in the field themselves, or have ever been
there, will notice one or two details in which the author

of the Salonica Expedition, Mr. PRICE states the reasons
has gone wrong. The other six stories touch upon current

“WHERE shall we stow our Ministry of Air 2"—
Thus spake our Masters, plunged in contemplation;
“We want a building which the Town could spare
As doing no good service to the nation;
So that if Fritz, beneath the moon's bright sphere,
Should choose it as a proper mark to shatter,
Provided that he missed Lord Roth ERMERE,
It wouldn't really matter.
“Though the Savoy would fit us like a glove;
Though Ritz and Carlton, Claridge's and Berkeley
Are each the very place in which to shove
Our personnel, both militant and clerkly;
We would not give the public needless pain
Or wantonly deject their gastric juices,
Turning to warlike ends a hallowed ſane
Designed for holier uses."
And so the Expert Mind surveys the list
Of less important structures and engages,
As rubbish-space that never would be missed,
The garner of the wonders of the ages;
And in the shrine that Art had made her own—
Her wealth consigned to cellars, swathed in wrappers—
Shall sound the cackle, over tea and scone,
Of giddy glad-eyed flappers.
Well, if they count it just a lumber-store
For stuffy relics of the dead antico;
If all that heritage of ancient lore
Seems small beside the claims of Mumm and Clicquot;

STUDENTs of character declare that

Take Jacob. Jacob's past life was
at first shrouded in mystery; but later,
in confidential moods, he would some-
times partially lift the veil and disclose a
picturesque panorama, from which race-
course, police, magistrate and prison
would stand out in bold relief. The
really important features of his career
remained hidden.
Jacob's success was mainly due to
his physical presence and to his unique
code of honour. Loosely built, un-
kempt, he was wont to shamble through
the transport-lines, with a hang-dog
and with guilt writ T

Military policemen
would arrest him in-
stinctively and for-
mulate a charge later
at random. Though
theoretically unfair,
results usually justi-
fied the proceeding.
The odds were al-
ways heavily against
him. Jacob fully
realised this, and
would make a clean
breast of whatever
was required. He
knew that no seri-

liberty would result.

would endeavour to explain in hoarse
super-cockney accents that he was

But Mabel drives a whacking Limousine :

While they get more than Brigadiers—
No wonder now the agent sneers,
“You can't get girls to come to Turnham Green.”
Do they look back and hope that we are happy,
With no one left to fuss about our food;
And when some foreman is extremely snappy
Rather, I ween, with mirthful hoots
They think of Master cleaning boots,
And thank their stars, the little brutes,
They bear no more the yoke of housemaid-hood.

And all these women fling their swords away ?
Will the dear maids come back to us, I wonder?

And will they want Munition rates?

UNOFFICIAL LETTERS.
I HAVE been privileged to see an ex-
amination paper, set for the subalterns
of a certain Battalion, on “Military
Correspondence.” The first three ques-
tions do not intrigue me greatly, but
Questions 4 and 5 are a different mat-
ter. Here I feel that I can be of help
to my fellow-subalterns. For these two
questions deal with a point of etiquette
whose importance at this critical time
cannot be over-estimated.
“Question 4.—Write an unofficial
letter asking your Colonel to dinner.
Question 5.-Ditto to your Briga-
dior.”
Now it is obvious that if either of
these questions is to be answered satis-
factorily it will not be enough just to
give one sample letter. The manner
of your invitation will depend on many
things, as, for instance, (1) your position
in the Regiment; (2) why you want
the Colonel to come to dinner with you;
(3) what you've got for dinner—and
so on. Another point to be considered
is whether you propose to have the
Colonel and the General to dinner on
the same night. To some extent this
simplifies matters. One writes—at
least this is how I always used to do
it—one writes to the General, mention-
ing that the Colonel is coming too and
apologising for him as rather a bore,
and one writes to the Colonel, mention-
ing that the General is coming too and
apologising for him as still more of
a bore, and one puts the letters into
the wrong envelopes and forgets to
stamp either. Unfortunately one can
only do this once. It is not enough
therefore for the real lover of etiquette,
who must be master of every occasion
as it arises. Let us then postpone our
meeting with the Brigadier and con-
sider how best to deal with the Colonel
of our Battalion.
I have said that the first point to
consider is your position in the Regi-
ment; obviously the newly-gazetted
cadet of eighteen will not be in the
same position as the elderly gentleman
who has kept his one star through
years of strife, and can still remember
the day when he took the Colonel on
his knee and bade him listen to the
tick-tick. At the same time it is only
fair to suppose that the latter class of
subaltern, whether at school or Varsity,
as Editor or Member of Parliament,
has learnt to write some sort of a letter
adequate to convey even the intricate
idea that he wishes the company of
another gentleman to dinner with him.
It is therefore to the younger subaltern
not so well versed in the affairs of the
world that I propose to offer my advice.
divided into the following classes:–
(1) The Earnest; (2) The Formal;
(3) The Friendly. According to why
you want the Colonel to come to dinner,
to some extent according to what you
have to offer him, you will base your
decision as to which of these styles you
will use.
I.—THE EARNEST.
DEAR Corlox EI,_As one who is in-
terested in the welfare of the Regiment
I have long felt that there are certain
matters which I should like to talk
over with you in a more friendly man-
ner than is possible between us on
the parade ground. After nearly two
months' residence with you . the im-
pressions which I have formed of the
general tono and bearing of the Bat-
talion must be of a certain value. I
do not wish to suggest for a moment
that my knowledge of army matters is
to be compared with your own; rather
do I wish to suggest that this very
familiarity of yours with military life
must blind you to a good deal which is
most striking to the newcomer. My
impressions, then, are at your service,
and I for my part shall be willing to
listen to, and consider carefully, your
comments upon them. It seems to me
that this interchange of thought can
best take place (as they say) “across
the walnuts and the wine.” I have, as
it so happens, just laid in a pound of wal-
nuts, while my aunt last week sent me
a bottle of ginger wine as yet unopened.
Will you therefore give me the pleasure
of your company at dinner on Thursday
next at seven o'clock? In case you
may wish to prepare yourself with a
few notes, I may say that the following
are among the subjects which I hope
to raise:—
(1) The uses of an Adjutant.
(2) The language of company com-
manders. -
(3) Ragging in the Mess.
(4) Tact in our senior officers.
Looking forward to the pleasure of
your company,
I am, Yours cordially.
P.S.—A verbal answer on the parade
ground will suffice.

HoNourED SIR,--I trust you will
pardon my temerity in addressing you,
but I am hoping that you will be
gracious enough to grant me an un-
usual favour. A few relations and
very old friends of mine—Sir John
JELLIcoe, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, Sir
WILLIAM Rob ERTSON, Mr. THOMAS
HARDY, and President WILSON.—are
dining with me on Saturday. They are
all most anxious to have the honour
of meeting you, and, if you would con-
descend to come, my uncle (Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE) will drive his car round to
call for you at about eight o'clock.
I am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant.
It is to be hôped now that the sub-
altern will be able, not only to get full
marks in his examination paper, but
also to meet with assurance the many
problems of etiquette which confront
the young soldier. Should he, how-
ever, still be appalled by the difficulties
which lie in the way of a gentleman
who wants to ask another gentleman
to dinner, my advice to him is simple.
Don't ask him. A. A. M.

“I WANT I.T.”
QUEUE-MANIA.
THE suspicion that all was not well
with Old Dobson came first to me on
the day when I met him hurrying
home with a small packet of sugar.
“Waited in a queue forty-five min-
utes for this,” he said.
“Did you? Sickening,” said I.
“Oh, I don't know about that. It's
not unamusing. There's a certain
camaraderie about a queue. I rather
like it.”
I looked at him suspiciously, but he
appeared to be quite serious, and in-
deed my experience of him was that
he had never intentionally made a
joke.
About a week later I was greatly sur-
prised to see Dobson, of all people, in the
queue outside the pit of our local music-
hall. The doors were just opened, but
when he arrived at the barrier he
wriggled out of the crush and made
off down the street.
“Hullo,” I said, overtaking him,
“why didn't you go into the Empire?”
“I haven't been into a music-hall
for twenty years,” said Dobson.
“Then why 2 ”
He looked round to see that we were
not overheard and then took my arm
“The fact is, I simply can't resist a
queue,” he said.
Three days ago I looked out of my
window and to my surprise saw
Dobson's head appearing above the
fence which protects my villa residence
from the road. He was standing on
the pathway, and as I watched I saw
that every minute or so be moved
along a pace or two. -
I went out in the garden and looked
over the fence.
“Oh, that you?” said he, “Thought
I'd come round for a chat and a smoke.
But I must take my turn, of course,
like every one else. Oh, I beg your
pardon,” he put in suddenly, as he took
off his hat to an imaginary lady in
front of him ; “I fear I have trodden
on your heel. Yes, very seasonable
weather, isn't it? I hope you were not
inconvenienced by the air-raid last
night?”
While he prattled on thus I went
out at the gate and along the path to
him. -
“Dobby,” I said, “as you are an old
friend I have made arrangements for
you to come in at once in front of all
these people.”

stoutly. “It wouldn't be cricket. No,

It was twenty minutes before I wel-

“I shan't keep him long,” he called
over his shoulder as he entered the
house.
He was perfectly normal on all other
subjects, but I could not persuade him
to stay more than a quarter of an hour.
“I must make room for the next

II. W. B.
I owe a grudge to “Enid,” the
doddering old man who writes the Food
Economy Notes in my evening paper.
I had just read how to use up the odd
fragments of pheasant which bother
economical people so much in these
trying times, and then I came to a
paragraph headed, “A Useful Winter
Hint.” It said that the proper way
to treat a hot-water bottle was not just
to throw it into the bed, but to make
a kind of tent above it of the clothes.
Then the air gets warm and the bed
is equally warmed all through, instead
of having a Sierra Leone patch with
huge areas of Nova Zembla on each
side of it. I could see that “Enid "
was just filling up his column, but the
idea struck me as a useful one.
Now I am an authority on hot-water
bottles. I am responsible for the great
idea of the Mottle or motor hot-water
bottle which will run round the bed
and warm it all equally. Years ago
in these columns I placed this magnifi-
cent idea at the disposal of British
manufacturers. Alas for their lack of
I am, as I say, a confirmed hot-water
bottler, and if anyone alleges in Eliza-
bethan language that I am a “luxur"
I reply that the bravest man I know
always has three hot-water bottles in
his bed when he comes home on leave,
and would have six only he does not
wish to be considered greedy. Why,
the most cheering thing about the War
to me is the fact that all the rubber
hot-water bottles in Berlin have been
commandeered. It shows the German
higher authorities must be getting cold
feet. . . . - . .
Naturally it was my first impulse to
test this novel idea. I rang the bell
immediately after dinner. “Jane,” I
said, “fill the largest hot-water bottle
we have with boiling water and bring
it to me.” - -
“Yes, Sir,” said Jane, without turn-
ing a hair.
When the bottle was brought I took
it up to my bedroom and with the aid
of a fishing-rod joint made a kind of
marquee of the bed-clothes. Then, con-
fident that the bed would be warmed
equally all through, I went downstairs
and forgot all about it.
shriek upstairs and Q cry of “George,
burglars!" from my wife. I put on my
special's helmet to overawe the in-
truders, grabbed my truncheon to lay
them out and rushed upstairs.
“In our bedroom,” gasped my wife,
“and I've sprained my ankle on the
stairs.” .
I burst in, and there in the dim
light I saw a strange white figure on
the bed.
“Hit the burglar first and argue with
him afterwards” has been my motto
ever since I joined the specials.
Crash came my truncheon. The
fishing-rod broke into smithereens and
one fragment perforated the hot-water
bottle.
Then I had to explain matters to
my wife, who, disregarding my refer-
ence to “Enid,” said that it was the
kind of mad thing that only a man
would do.
It is “Enid " who, to use the classic
sentence of Serjeant Buzſuz, has been

ANOTHER FAIRY.
The pages of Punch give, every now

When “R. F.".sees a fairy, whether
it is shopping, or playing at the bottom
of the garden, or frolicking on a foun-

looks like a fairy--that is, a tiny iri-
descent crystal drop of sublimated
humanity. But my fairy looked so
unlike anything that is associated with
the word that I am beginning really to
think of myself as being something
rather special in discernment to have
recognised him at all. “R. F.," at any
rate, has to do no detective work: her

READING BETWEEN THE LINES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I write in some
haste in order to provide your readers
with a helpful little note about the
Brest - Litovsk Peace Negotiations.
There are many points about this dip-
lomatic debate that the Entente Allies
find it difficult to understand. And one
is this. The German delegates pro-
pose that the future government of the
occupied provinces of Russia should be
determined—while German troops are
still in possession—by “a plébiscite
on broad lines" (auf breite Linien).
It is clear enough, of course, that the
breadth of the lines will be assured by
the presence of enemy troops and the
absence of half the natives; still the
phrase has puzzled many readers. May
we not cull a few parallels from recent
history?
Any close student of the German
Press must have observed, for instance,
that it was on broad lines (bei weite
Reihen, in the vernacular) that the
enemy lamented the sinking of the
Lusitania. It was also on broad lines
(zu freie Zeilen, in the original) that he
kept the treaty regarding Belgian neu-
trality. One may go further and say
that it was on the very broadest lines
(zu gröbste Striche, in his own language)
Putting these instances together you
will conclude that these interesting ex-
pressions (which are in hourly use in
the streets of Berlin) may be freely
rendered by the British phrase, “I don't
think.” I am, yours helpfully,
STATISTICIAN.

“A new order fiaetted last night gives the
power to the Minister of Munitions to direct

THE JIB CRANE.
(An incident of last Summer.)
AT an hour that seemed immediately
after sunrise there was a kind of vol-
canic upheaval in the cot alongside my
bed and a high voice piped out vigor-
ously:
“Hallo, Daddy, is this to-day?”
“No,” I muttered drowsily, “it’s last
night. Go to sleep, you young beggar.”
But the young beggar climbed relent-
lessly on to my bed, sat upon my chest
Napoleonically and continued:
“What day is this, Daddy? Is this
Saturday? Are you goin' to the office?”
It was Saturday. I was not going
to the office. I was contemplating a
restful day at home. He knew all that,
and without giving me time to equivo-
cate he demanded, “Well, will you
make me a crane 2"
“A crane?” said I.
mean—a crane?”
Only too well I knew how he meant.
I recalled a day at the seaside when
my young hopeful saw a boy with a
toy crane lifting buckets of sand on to
a gangway which the fishermen had a
fancy to use for getting at their boats
and where none but he desired sand.
The boy was such an obvious nuisance
to the men that the sight of him in-
spired my son to an instant demand
for such a toy as that crane. In a large
paternal way I had replied to his eager
request:
“You wait until we get home, old
chap, and I'll make you a crane, a
better crane than that.”
I meant it at the time—I did really.
I saw, at that moment, exactly how I
should construct the crane with cotton-
reels for pulleys, you know, and an
effective but simply-designed winch
made out of oh, any old thing. I had
felt that I could not continually refuse
the child everything he wanted, having
already rejected his plea for a live
donkey and a motor-car to take home
with us.
So now, in bed, when I feebly parried
with “How do you mean?” my son
promptly explained how he meant.
“Like you said at the seaside, Daddy,
an' a boy was liftin' luggids when the
boatmen tried to walk on that little
wooden road an' x *
As if a man wanted to be reminded
of what he had said at the seaside
There was no escape, however. We
rose and dressed. I found that the
construction of that crane was not to
be a leisurely artistic job. I was ex-
pected to make it now, before break-
fast. No, the boy did not want to eat
his porridge—all he wanted was that
Daddy should make his crane. Simi-

on the garden-seat, I gazed at it, trying
to see in it the embryo of a crane.
But I couldn't. -
The boy watched me with the critical
coldness of a police magistrate; his
gaze pierced to my guilty soul.
“Don't sit on the seat, Daddy,” he
urged; “make my crane.”
“Be quiet,” I snapped, “ or else I
won't.”
He gazed at me for about ten seconds
and inquired :
“Are you thinkin', Daddy?”
“Trying to,” I grunted.
“Don’t think, Daddy,” he mildly
suggested ; “make my crane.”
I drew out a bit of paper and a
pencil and began to sketch something
that an imaginative and sympathetic
person might mistake for a crane. The
youth regarded my doings with obvi-
ous suspicion.
“What are you writin', Daddy?” he
inquired. “Don’t write; dyust make
me a crane.”
“I’m drawing a crane.

“13ut I don't want a crane drawed,”
he responded, “I want a real crane to
lift luggids, like you said at the seaside,

“Look here, young man,” I sternly
declared, “you just go and play sea-
side on the sand-heap. How can I
make a crane with you dancing all
over me?”
With feverish haste I rummaged in
the wood-pile and found a six-foot lath,
an inch wide, half-an-inch or so thick.

Each year is to be divided into ten

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. JoHN MASEFIELD has already to his credit one finely-
told chronicle of the War. If The Old Front Line (HEINE-
MANN) hardly gives scope for the picturesque writing that
delighted us in his Gallipoli, it is none the less a profoundly
moving record of scenes and places which not for genera-
tions to come will our people think upon unthrilled. The
writer's aim in this small book has been a careful descrip-
tion of the old British line, as it existed at the beginning
of the Battle of the Somme, with the prospect that in the
future it may be needed for aid in identification. “Even
this war will some day end, and the ruins will be rebuilt,
and the fields full of death will grow food, and all this
frontier of trouble will be forgotten. One summer with its
flowers will cover most of the ruin man can make, and then
these places from which the driving back of the enemy
began will be hard to trace.” Here is a book from which
emotion has been almost as of purpose excluded, but in the
passage above you may see what Mr. MASEFIELD the poet
makes of such a theme. I should mention that his nine
chapters are illustrated with some war-photographs, more
dramatic, I think, than anything of their kind I have yet
seen. Also there is a map, one of those queerly polyglot
charts wherein a path may run from “Flat-iron Copse” to
“Bazentin-le-Grand.” The writer mentions his hope of
following up this description of the old line by an account
of our share in the battle. It is a hope that will be
I am a little puzzled by A German Deserter's War
Experience (GRANT RICHARDs). It purports to be written
by a young man who in civil life was a miner, but was
doing his second year of military service as a sapper in
garrison at Coblenz when the War broke out. He was
with the forces that invaded Belgium and afterwards
poured into France, and for fourteen months he took part in
every kind of fighting. At the end of this time he had had
enough of it, and, having secured a furlough, he went away
and never came back, but escaped into Holland and event-
ually got clear away to America, where, as I gather, this
book appeared in serial form. I see no reason to doubt
the genuine character of the document, though it is pos-
sible that here and there the writer was helped. Since
ERCKMANN-CHATRIAN's Conscrit there has been no more
powerful indictment of War and its makers than is to be
found in this volume. The anonymous author of the
Preface apologises for the deserter's lack of literary art.
No apology, was required, for some of the descriptions (as
of the Belgian horrors and of hand-to-hand fighting) are
extraordinarily vivid and direct pieces of writing. The
German defeat in the battle of the Marne and the utter
chaos that ensued are also brilliantly described. No words
of hatred and contempt are strong enough for the author
to apply to the German officers with whom he is brought
into contact, from the CROWN PRINCE down to his own
company commander; he puts them all down as brutes
and cowards. Incidentally I observe that, in war-time, dis-

few have done it with so fierce a pen as this German

When Rose Whitelands, impoverished but rich with
every maidenly charm, journeying to an unpromising situa-
tion as nursery governess, found herself in the same rail-
way compartment with Vera Wayne, film-star and war-
widow, who had been married and left at the church door,
and was now going to her own even more unpromising
position as the daughter-in-law of a family she had never
seen and didn't in the least care about, what do you sup-
pose they did? Miss BERTA RUCK tells us that they
agreed to swop identities, or rather that Vera suggested
the plan and Rose was bluffed by a variety of circumstances
into carrying it out. Presumably, as Miss RUCR fixed the
affair, she has got to be believed; though I admit that the
change did impose something of a strain on my credulity,
despite the ingenuity with which she has handled the
circumstances. Anyhow,
Rose is welcomed with
open arms by the delight-
ful parents of her sup-
posed husband, and goes
with them to Paris “to
meet a relative,” and in-
cidentally to be decked
out in all the loveliest
clothes that the imagin-
ation of woman could
compass. One observes
here that when Miss
RUCR called this story

that destiny had been awaiting him all the time at the
place from which he started. But this is by the way; it
is the visits of Thomas that form the attraction of the book,
and the various establishments that welcomed him, each
with its distinctive atmosphere very happily suggested,
from the ducal mansion (where a house-party of the smart
stole his evening trousers) to that abode of dogs where his
adventures moved me to the laugh acknowledged above.
Certainly so cheery a guest deserves an immediate place
on your own list of week-enders. -
Those who know Mr. STEPHEN GRAHAM through his
Russian books realise that his resilient mysticism sees the
good which he wishes to see, and will always appeal rather
to an emotion than to a reason. In quite the queerest

anyone who wants a cheerful fairy tale all about pretty
clothes and nice meals I fancy Another Girl's Shoes will
be found very comfortable wear.
These are days when a new humourist—so he be genu-
inely amusing—should find his welcome assured. That is
one reason why I expect you to thank me for an intro-
duction to Mr. H. B. CREswell, whose book, Thomas
(NIsbBT), has brought me one laugh, several chuckles, and
a pleasant sufficiency of smiles. These last are indeed
Mr. CREswell's staple commodity; he is no farcical jester
to attack your sides with impossible buffooneries. Granted
Thomas and his circle of friends, the adventures that befall
him during his visits to them are all within practicable
limits. Thomas was, in ascending degrees, a civil servant,
a motorist, and a visitor. Before and above all else he was
the born visitor. It follows that this book, which is the
record of a holiday spent by Thomas, partly in his car,
partly in the spare bedrooms of a varied acquaintance,
contains so much garnered wisdom on the topic that it
might well be called the vade-mecum of the dropper-in.
There is also a certain slight story and some flavouring of
and the like as had ceased to mean much to us here, and
with them to build up a suitable religious background over
there. With him goes Hampden, a licensed lay-preacher
of the Church of England, and, I am afraid I must say it,
a chartered prig, appraising these treasures and showing
how much more they really mean to us than our apparent
casualness would lead you to suppose. I take it that what
is chiefly wrong with the book is the form—and its
amazing lack of humour. The people in it might be quite
tolerable to those of their spiritual kin. To me Hampden
was merely a woolly-brained blameless ass, and this cannot
have been the effect intended. But what I should like to
testify to is Mr. GRAHAM's love of England, and that may
well be allowed to cover a multitude of artistic sins.
I commend The Thistle to your notice not only because
it is the Souvenir Book (No. 2) of the Scottish Women's
Hospitals, but also because it is a bargain at the eighteen-
pence charged for it. The illustrations are really wonder-
ful, and the letterpress escapes that taint of the patch-quilt
which experience teaches me to look for in such produc-
tions. I am not going to mention any names, for the
simple reason that if I began I should not know when and
where to stop. But I urge you to discover for yourselves

love-interest, but as this latter is quite obviously settled in
what good work is here, and so help a really fine cause.

IT gave me a distinct shock when I
read it.
Sunday afternoons at the Zoo, always
taken at its face value the air of nour-
ished ease that sits so well upon the
more popular of its denizens. My own
favourites had never received me with
anything but friendly if expectant
smiles. How was I to know that
tragedies of pent-up longing, unfulfilled
desire, corroding nostalgia lay beneath
the mask of friendship, indifference or
contempt? I mention indifference and
contempt because it would be idle to
pretend that I am accorded the same
warmth of greeting in all quarters of the
gardens. The wart-hog, for example,
plainly regards me as a mere cipher.
He does not like buns, and an earnest
attempt to propitiate him with a pail
of nice ripe swill merely led to a mis-
understanding with the officials of the
Underground Railway.

For myself, after my initial failure to

mouse on a string, I have simply
passed by on the other side where the
mongooses live.
But these surly or indifferent ones
had always seemed to me the exception.
In the main I had always found my
friends, furred, feathered or scaled, to
be possessed of a generous share of
cheery philosophy, sparkling wit and
even of undisguised but never ill-bred
levity. Were their lives, then, mere
travesties of existence, tragedies of
prison yard and cell, an endless beating
against bars of tortured spirits crying
to be free? I should never have sup-
posed it, and yet Mr. John GALsworthy
assures me it is so, and on such subjects
as prison bars, wife-beating navvies, un-
just judges, defaulting solicitors' clerks
and other symbols of oppression he
has always been to my simple mind an
authority from which appeal seemed
superfluous. How could he be mis-
taken about it? And yet
I took the first train to Regent's
Park. On the way I thought out a
plan of campaign. My friends—biped,
quadruped and multiped—should hide
nothing from me in the goodness of
their hearts. Their painful seeret, if
it existed, I would compel them to
share with me at all costs.
I decided to begin on James, the
more or less one-sided, and, while his
dry humour appeals to me, it has
always seemed to me to savour un-
necessarily of the mordant.
“Well, James,” I began, “I suppose
you have seen it?” James eats the
paper every day, being interested, or so
he says, in some relatives who are
fighting in Mesopotamia. James is
inclined to swank about the War, and
likes to pretend that he is waiting to
be called to the colours. The fact is
he is well over military age and would
never be categoried higher than B 3.
“Of course I saw it,” replied James
somewhat testily. “Rather a lot of
bilge, between you and me,” he added,
carefully measuring the distance be-
tween the lapel of my coat and the top
of the railing.
“Are you sad?” I asked, gently dis-
entangling the brim of my hat from
James's upper lip. (His length is as
good as ever, but his direction isn't
what it used to be.)
“Personally, I am never sad,” he
replied. “There is so much of interest
within our grasp if we only keep our
outlook unimpaired. But you must
not expect me to speak for these wild
animals. Of their crude emotions I
know nothing.”
James, who has eaten more keepers
than anyone else in the menagerie,

“What, not one?” he demanded dis-
gustedly. I explained that no buns
were to be had, but finally compromised
on an old tobacco pouch which I had
intended to throw away. James ex-
pressed a grudging satisfaction.
I passed on to the abode of an old
and tried friend, Grumpy, the venerable
bison, whose shaggy exterior and repel-
lent demeanour hide a heart of gold.
Grumpy is never subject to moods.
This is partly because his rations have
not been curtailed by the War. Buns
he never cared for, and the occasional
lump of kitchen salt that I bestow on
him suffices to keep us on terms of
closest intimacy. On the other hand
no one has ever suspected Grumpy of
being flippant or Laodicean.
“Will you please give me your views,
i. real views, on captivity?” I asked
im when the customary greetings
had been exchanged. Grumpy snorted,
who can snort like Grumpy, and that
is an elderly Conservative M.P. whom
I sometimes meet at the club. He
snorts just like that when anyone men-
tions Disestablishment.
“As a matter of fact,” replied Grumpy,
“I was born in captivity, old as I am.
But my father used to tell me of the
old days before he was—er—civilized.”
“Did he miss them much 2 "I asked.
“I mean the 'far-rolling prairie' and
all that 2" - -
“He never said so,” replied Grumpy.
“He used to boast of all the fights he
had won; but between you and me I
think they–er—brought him into the
fold just in time. He had been badly
mauled the week before by a big young
bull, and it's almost certain the coy-
otes would have got him.”
“But the “thunder of a million
hooves,’ and so forth 2 " I murmured,
faintly mindful of my MAYNE REID
and FENIMORE Cooper. “Oh, that,”
said Grumpy shortly, “that's all moon-
shine. Father said they only ran when
Indians were after them or there was
a fire. What he liked was to sit all
day in the mud.”
I derived much satisfaction from my

I determined to speak to Isabella, the
hippopotamus. But Isabella was peev-

warm. Besides, we are not particular
friends. Giving Isabella a bun is like
handing a ten-shilling note to a War
Bond Tank. Nothing less than a myriad
such contributions makes enough im-

buns to produce what the patent medi-

ape, I was scarcely more successful.

THE BUNS OF EXILE.
[“To me the Zoo is one of the saddest sights
in the world.”—John GALsſyonTHY.]
IT gave me a distinct shock when I
read it. I have always enjoyed my
Sunday afternoons at the Zoo, always
taken at its face value the air of nour-
ished ease that sits so well upon the
more popular of its denizens. My own
favourites had never received me with
anything but friendly if expectant
smiles. How was I to know that
tragedies of pent-up longing, unfulfilled
desire, corroding nostalgia lay beneath
the mask of friendship, indifference or
contempt? I mention indifference and
contempt because it would be idle to
pretend that I am accorded the same
warmth of greeting in all quarters of the
gardens. The wart-hog, for example,
plainly regards me as a mere cipher.
He does not like buns, and an earnest
attempt to propitiate him with a pail
of nice ripe swill merely led to a mis-
understanding with the officials of the
Underground Railway.
The Egyptian cat, again, has never
been ordinarily pleasant with me. In-
deed this irascible personality, I am
informed, has only once been known to
smile, and that was when a bibulous
bus-driver called him “pretty pussy"
and tried to tickle his neck. The
keeper declares it was what the bus-
For myself, after my initial failure to
arouse his interest with a clockwork
mouse on a string, I have simply
passed by on the other side where the
mongooses live.
But these surly or indifferent ones
had always seemed to me the exception.
In the main I had always found my
friends, furred, feathered or scaled, to
be possessed of a generous share of
cheery philosophy, sparkling wit and
even of undisguised but never ill-bred
levity. Were their lives, then, mere
travesties of existence, tragedies of
prison yard and cell, an endless beating
against bars of tortured spirits crying
to be free? I should never have sup-
posed it, and yet Mr. John GALsworthy
assures me it is so, and on such subjects
as prison bars, wife-beating navvies, un-
just judges, defaulting solicitors' clerks
and other symbols of oppression he
has always been to my simple mind an
authority from which appeal seemed
superfluous. How could he be mis-
taken about it? And yet
I took the first train to Regent's
Park. On the way I thought out a
plan of campaign. My friends—biped,
quadruped and multiped—should hide
nothing from me in the goodness of
their hearts. Their painful seeret, if
it existed, I would compel them to
share with me at all costs.
I decided to begin on James, the
more or less one-sided, and, while his
dry humour appeals to me, it has
always seemed to me to savour un-
necessarily of the mordant.
“Well, James,” I began, “I suppose
you have seen it 2" James eats the
paper every day, being interested, or so
he says, in some relatives who are
fighting in Mesopotamia. James is
inclined to swank about the War, and
likes to pretend that he is waiting to
be called to the colours. The fact is
he is well over military age and would
never be categoried higher than B 3.
“Of course I saw it,” replied James
somewhat testily. “Rather a lot of
bilge, between you and me,” he added,
carefully measuring the distance be-
tween the lapel of my coat and the top
of the railing.
“Are you sad?” I asked, gently dis-
entangling the brim of my hat from
James's upper lip. (His length is as
good as ever, but his direction isn't
what it used to be.)
“Personally, I am never sad,” he
replied. “There is so much of interest
within our grasp if we only keep our
outlook unimpaired. But you must
not expect me to speak for these wild
animals. Of their crude emotions I
know nothing.”
James, who has eaten more keepers
than anyone else in the menagerie,
rather overdoes, in my poor opinion,

thetically while I unfolded my troubles.
His replies were a masterpiece of con-
sidered logic.
“Wo animals,” he observed, “have
been rightly described by a French
philosopher as “happy little stomachs.'
All our other emotions are transitory,
but hunger is with us always. When
not actually asleep we are either eating
or looking for something to eat (thank
you). Hunger is the mainspring of all
our actions. In the next cage but one

to travel every year from Greenland to
Patagonia and back in search of food.
He tells me that they went in flocks, and
tho chance of surviving the journey was
less than that of a soldier going over
the top in Flanders (thank you).
“You ask,” he went on, “if we are
happy in captivity. Once we realise that
we are not to be hurt and that food is to
be had for the asking, we are happy pro-
vided we are not sick. Mark you, I do
not say that all captivity is pleasant.
Even here there is room for improve-
ment. Insufficient variety of diet (thank
you), too close confinement, the sub-
jection to improper temperature, the
proximity of unpleasant neighbours—
all these drawbacks occur more or less.
But they are remediable. Confinement
as such, if accompanied by plenty of
food, opportunities for exercise, com-

“your respectable business man, who

a little maliciously, it seemed to me—
“is at least consistent. He shackles
himself with habits and conventions
and needs and encumbrances as much
as he imprisons us with bars and wire-
netting.”
Tom paused expectantly. There was
only the cockroach left.

WHEN we are slow in effort, weak in will,
Querulous in the lesser strains of war
Or craven in the greater, when the hill
Of Destiny seems higher than her star,
When from the clay that bears their impress still
Depart the dreams that were, the ghosts that are—
When this befalls—if ever this might be—
England, seek thou the Tower of Memory.
When babbling fools, for Russian follies ripe,
And chinless knaves, more full of words than wit,
Play on the hills of Hell their oaten pipe
And sing of sweet pools in the sunless pit,
When the long sword is loosed in Honour's gripe
By the cold fingers of the hypocrite,
And faint forebodings frustrate her decree,
England, climb thou the Tower of Memory.
Walk there awhile, before the day is done,
Beneath the banner and the battered casque
Where carven heraldry in bronze and stone,
With lily and with cross and leopard's mask,
Spandrils the arch. Thou shalt not walk alone;
There dead men live again and dead lips ask,
“What of the isles of England and her sea?”
Till whispers fill the Tower of Memory.
From brows burnt dark by Syrian sun and wind
Flash the blue eyes that awed the Saracen;
Souls long since given to God in utmost Ind

Lords of the world and masters of the mind,
Who sailed beyond the sea-mark of their ken,
And for their England dreamed all things save three--
Dishonour, ruin and darkened memory.
Stand in the Tower of Memory till the West
Breaks round the dropping sun in splintered flame;
There is a chronicle deciphered best
By crimson light—the inerasible shame.
Of traitor foeman and, far bitterest,
Of alien hearts clad in a kindly name;
- Know who are bondsmen, know that thou art free
While thou canst hold the Tower of Memory.
Across the epic arras curves the trace
Of fading vows in counterfeited gold;"
There hangs the cast of every traitor face,
With every cunning line and evil fold.
Look long, O England, for that very race
Peers o'er thy foaming frontiers grey and cold;
Look long, for who shall blind or baffle thee
If thou but hold the Tower of Memory?

MY DEAR CHARLEs, I have come to
the disinterested and impersonal con-
clusion that I am IT. Other men may
be General Officers Commanding; I
am the Particular Officer commanding
A. B. A. S. Jones.
That is the whole of him: “A. B. A. S.
Jones.” I have changed his name, of
course, but the initials I wouldn't alter
for worlds. Whatever he may think of
them himself, they are the joy and
pride of my life. Jones is a sailor, a
real pukka nautical and naval sailor,
and I, a soldier, command him.
I have always held myself out to
command any old thing you like, from
an infantryman to a third-class air
mechanic, from a gunner to a driver,
from a sapper to a nondescript civilian
who was found to have got into uni-
form so quickly that he had omitted
to take the oath of allegiance. Some
come from overseas, and with one I
have to hold converse in French, because
he can't speak my native language and
I can't speak his. But the climax of
when, recently, my office door burst
open and, preceded by a strong smell
of ozone, in blew A. B. A. S. Jones.
We got to the essence of the thing
at once, over the matter of the initials.
At once I took exception to the excess
of Christian names and absence of
descriptive prefix. “Come, come, my
lad,” said I, “you cannot go about
these days in that naked sort of way.
You must be a private or a gunner, or
a sapper or something. You seem to
forget that there is a war on.”
He was disguised, I should tell you,
in khaki. Even so he would stick to
it that he had given me the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the
truth about himself. Cross-examined
on the point and reminded that he was
upon his oath, he declared that he was
a naval rating. Our Mr. Booth, who
has never yet been found wanting,
thereupon remembered that he had
urgent business with the Quarter-
master-Sergeant and left the office
hurriedly. George was silent for the
first time in his life, and refused to
venture an opinion in the presence of a
superior officer. I was left to battle
“And what,” I asked, “is a naval
rating, when you've caught it?”
Jones referred to the initials again and
said he was an able seaman, and the .
only little rift there has ever been in our
mutual lute goes back to that. He will
have it that he has got the letters in
their proper order, prefix first and Chris-
tian names next. For my part I can
never bring myself to spell sea with a
“B” when there is an “S” handy.
“And so you are a sailor 2" said I.
“Yes, Sir,” said he.
The correct answer, I pointed out,
was “Ay, ay, Sir.” But Jones didn't
tumble to it; to be honest, it was quite
apparent that he was in reality just
another darned civilian, like the rest of
us. Personally, I refuse to be honest
on this point. I insist upon the pre-
tence being kept up ; if a war is worth
making at all it is worth making
properly. It was necessary to show
A. B. A. S. Jones that one was a strict
disciplinarian.
“You are a sailor 2 " I said.

“Then,” I admonished him, “you
should give your trousers a hitch when
addressing an officer. Stand down.”
George congratulated me on my
manner of handling a difficult situation,
without having committed myself to a
technical phrase. The “Stand down”
particularly impressed him; it had, he
said, a professional smack about it,
though it might not be the right
profession it smacked of. Jones later
on unburdened himself to our Mr.
Booth, pointing out that he was in the
Army now and had left his ship.
“You should have brought it with
you,” said our Mr. Booth. “It would
have come in handy for our next leave.”
In fact, the whole department thought
it had thoroughly defeated the Senior
Service. “You wait,” said I; “there's
the Admiralty to be reckoned with yet.
I bet that all those Model Dwellings
in Whitehall aren't full of people doing
nothing.”
I was right. There was the usual
preliminary lull, during which the new-
comer went about his work, drew his
rations and grew fat and rosy. But
meanwhile the trouble was accumu-
lating, and Army forms were collect-
ing on some distant unfriendly desk.
Eventually some Admiral or other came
ashore, went to his office, saw the Army
forms there and at once burst into such
language as is entirely foreign to us
soldiers. Slowly but surely his nautical
clerk reduced this language to the more
seemly but no less biting form of the
official minute, and we were right in
the middle of it. . .
George pushed off to Italy; our
Mr. Booth went sick; I found excuse
to be elsewhere than in my office,
which I left in charge of a new recruit.
The correspondence continued to pour
in, insisting on the point that naval
ratings cannot be transferred to Army
units, and had Admiralty sanction
been officially obtained for this man's
discharge?
I was at last compelled to return to
business on receipt of a piteous note
from my good friend at the War Office
who obtains and delivers to me from
time to time these specialists, snaffled
from any available source. If I didn't
do something to help him, he said, he
would fraternise, and bang would go

It was a long and a bitter battle. My
pursuers were far away, it is true, but
these nautical fellows are used to shoot-
ing with deadly aim at victims they
cannot see. Eventually we compro-
mised; for all their outward harshness
the seafaring ones recognised, and, no
doubt, understood, my affection for my

THE NEW INDUSTRY.
I WAs never taken so unawares, never
so bewildered and abashed—I may even
say outraged—as when, at the break-
fast table the other morning, in the
house of a friend hitherto notable for
the quietness and refinement of his
own and his family's demeanour, I
was suddenly made the target of the
loudest combined roar of protest that
ever split the welkin. And what do
you think I had done? No more than,
after reading a letter (to do which I
had, I hardly need say, asked and
obtained my hostess's permission), to
begin, as usual, to tear it up. No
sooner had my thumbs and fingers
arranged themselves to perform this
simple and very normal action than
the united lungs of T
my so-called hosts—
father, mother and
children—uttered
what I can describe
only as a howl of ex-
ecration, unearthly in
its volume and sud-
denness. And all this,
I learned, after I had
come to myself and
my shattered nerves
were calming down,
merely because, if you
please, owing to the /
scarcity of matches, º/,
spills have to be made; 7//
and I was wasting a |" º
piece of paper. //#!.
“Good heavens ! ” iſ ſº
I said to myself, “to
think that the delicate
decorum of such nice
people as these can go -
by the board at the thought of the loss
of one, or perhaps two, spills? This is
war indeed.” And then, being—what-
ever else I may be—no slacker, I flung
myself also into the fray and became
so keen and, I may add, so expert
that I too am preparing a somewhat
similar vocal effort with which to
check and admonish others as reckless
as my dead self. -
I am also in a position to assist an
industry which will soon be spreading
even into the homes of profiteers and
munitioners, and must occupy most of
the energies of our youngest and our
oldest. For spills catch life at both
ends; only the newest babes are too
immature, only the centenarians too
ripe, to fold them.
For the use of beginners a few hints
are now offered as to the manufacture
of spills—-styles, materials and so
forth—the whole calculated, if care-
fully assimilated and (with or without
mitted to memory, to convert even our
old friend, the veriest ignoramus, into
a perfect spiller in the course of a few
minutes.
To begin with, the implements.
These are inexpensive and to be found
everywhere. If not in evidence they
may, as a rule, be obtained from the
nearest pockets. In short, and without
being too funny about it—the hands.
Next, the material—paper, of which
ever since a paper shortage was an-
nounced there has been no lack. The
best paper of all for this purpose is
perhaps that on which bills are made
out; but begging circulars are also
good. Letters from admonitory aunts
often burn brightly; catalogues of bar-
gain sales give good results.
And now for method, where, I regret
“YEs, THE PostAL service Is IN A whetchED cond ITION. WHY, LAST MonTH I
SENT out NEARLY A HUNDRED STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT, AND, so FAR As I CAN
LEARN, oxEY TWO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.”
to say, controversy comes in. For there
are no fewer than three distinct schools
of spill-making, two of which un-
doubtedly disseminate heresy. If I
am to be your mentor, you must fold.
Disregard all soft counsels in the direc-
tion of rolling, and fold, fold, fold.
Spills, it must be remembered, should
not be too long or too thick. One
side of a sheet of ordinary octavo note-
paper should make two serviceable
specimens. The method which I advo-
cate and shall never depart from is to
tear the sheet in half, downwards, and
then fold the two halves, long-ways,
into four folds, firmly pressing the edges
with the thumb-mail. Those who, all
mistaken and astray, favour the rolling
system require rather larger pieces of
paper and therefore are less economical,
or, if you prefer it, patriotic, than I.
There is also a third party, utterly
obscurantist, pinning its faith to an
aggrandised form of rolled spill re-
which neither flames nor goes out, but
smoulders and smokes. I have seen
a young mother—with her children
about her watching the deplorable
operation—on her knees on the carpet,
rolling a whole Morning Post (a two-
penny paper now, mark you) into one
of these inefficacious tubes; and then
we all had to use matches.
So much for the actual manufacture,
in the best way, of spills. Next, their
use. The chief use of spills is to ignite
what used to be known as “The Indian
Weed,” but has lately, by an Oxford
professor of the highest standing, been
called “The Sister of Literature”—I
refer to tobacco. And I may say here
that it has been decided by the Com-
mittee of the Thirteen Club that the
bad luck which inevitably followed the

that the means of

the penalty has been

THE DUTY OF THE DIARIST.
[“The Diary is a form of literary activity
in which the competition of the great is not
to be feared. A great man has neither the
leisure nor the inclination to record the events
of his time. He leaves that to others, and if
we can only become personally acquainted with
people whose sayings and doings are worth pre-
serving, there is no reason why we should not
all be successful diarists.”—Observer.
LoNG haunted by a vague desire
Of literary fame,
But lacking themes to lend me fire
Or clarify my aim,
At last I am relieved of doubt;
No more I grope and beat about
The bush; I've learned the true way
out—
A Diary's the game !
One great advantage of this mode
Of labouring with the pen
I learn is this: you take a road
Untrod by famous men;
They haven't time to note or job
Down interesting things red-hot
(Though PEPys and GREVILLE, MooRE
and SCOTT
All did it now and then).
Again, if anxious to succeed,
You need not cut a dash
By tilting at each cult and creed
Or venturing on rash
Predictions of the race you'll run—
Pope, Caesar, Devil all in one;
That sort of diary was done
To death by MARIE BASH.
But while you need not be a star
To be a Diarist,
The method will not take you far
Without the proper grist;
In other words, you've got to mix
With people who have gifts or tricks,
Whose views on life and politics
Deserve an annalist.
Here The Observer's counsel ends;
The problems still remain,
How to acquire these brilliant friends
Who common folk disdain; - - -
How one whose intellect is dim
Can work his way into the swim—
The world where wisdom, wit, and
whim
And “all the talents” reign.
No matter; though I’m growing grey,
And though my friends are few,
And for the things they do or say
Unnoticed hitherto,
Who knows but I may hail the birth
Of some new minister of mirth,
Some village WILcox, or unearth
A rival to LE QUEUx!

THE BALLAD OF CODSON'S BEARD.
I'LL tell you a yarn of a sailor-man with a face more fierce
than fair
Who got round that on the Navy's plan by hiding it all
with hair;
He was one of a hard old sailor-breed and had lived his
life at sea,
But he took to the beach at the nation's need and fought
with the R.N.D.
Now Brigadier-General Blank's Brigade was tidy and neat
and trim,
And the sight of a beard on his parade was a bit too much
for him.
“What is that,” said he with a terrible oath, “of all that
is wild and weird 2"
And the Staff replied, “A curious growth, but it looks very
like a beard.”
And the General said, “I have seen six wars and many a
ghastly sight,
Fellows with locks that gave one shocks and buttons none
too bright,
But never a man in my Brigade with a face all fringed
with fur;
And you'll toddle away and shave to-day”—but Codson
said, “You err. -
“For I don't go much on wars as such, and living with
rats and worms,
And you ought to be glad of a sailor-lad on any old kind
of terms; -
While this old beard of which you're skeered it stands for
a lot to me,
For the great North gales and the sharks and whales and
the smell of the dear grey sea.”
New Generals crowded to the spot and urged him to
behave,
But Codson said, “You talk a lot, but can you make me

For the Navy allows a beard at the bows, and a beard is
the sign for me
That the world may know, wherever I go, I belong to the

Town Major jobs that break men's hearts and billets at

But whenever he knew a fight was due he hurried there by

And when he'd done for every Hun they sent him off again.

Some small foundation of truth.
Marshal Hindenburg. I don't know what particular one
among the thousand rumours you refer to, but if I might
be allowed I should advise you to disbelieve them all.
B. But this is a rumour that grows stronger every day,
since it is very pleasant to the ears of those who hear it.
It declares that peace is already on the way, there being
now a broad basis for negotiation. - -
H. That rumour I advise you to believe less than any of
the others. Not if I can help it shall there be negotiations
for peace until we have achieved a complete and crushing
victory over all our foes, and especially over England.
B. A pleasant prospect indeed you hold out to us. For
three years and a half we have poured blood and treasure
into your military machine. Millions of our best and
bravest have gone to feed your ambition and that of your
master, and of our hardly-earned substance but little is
left. Things cannot go on like this. We have secured the
alliance of Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria, which means
that, in addition to defending ourselves, we are forced to
defend them too. So well have you and your friends
managed affairs that we are hated and opposed by the rest
of the world; and all that has been won for us by a whole
generation of industry lies about us in ruins; and even if
we were to win the victory you speak of we should find it
almost impossible to keep a place among the nations of
the world.
H. This is fine talk for a loyal German subject. Your duty
is to obey when the KAISER commands, and not to oppose
your petty interests to his will. Germany above everything.
B. That, I suppose, is the reason why you added America
to our enemies. It was not enough that we should have
to fight England and France and Italy, but you and your
friends must seize America, unwilling as she was, and drag
her into the conflict. You pretend to laugh at America
and talk of fighting her with the Potsdam Fire Brigade;
but I know Americans and you do not, and I tell you it
was a black day for Germany when you forced America to
take her stand against us. - -
H. You had better leave policy alone and go back to your
ships, which perhaps you understand. .
B. My ships | Where are they? What has become of
them? They, with everything else that made Germany
respected, have been thrust into the fire, and nothing is left.
H. The army is left, and so long as we have that I fear
nothing.
B. The army The army I tell you I am tired of all
your heel-clicking and sword-rattling, and there are many
who agree with me. What is the use of your army to us
if all our industry is to perish and we are to live for ever
in a circle of enemies? Even in Russia you cannot make
any progress, and so it is everywhere. You win a little,
and then you are checked, and it is all to begin over again.
And then, when the basis for an honourable peace is
suggested, all you can do is to cry for everlasting war.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
No library of works about the War can be considered
decently equipped without a copy of The Complete
Despatches of Lord French, which, beautifully printed
(in a limited edition) by the Westminster Press and illus-
trated with excellent maps and portraits, to which is added
a full list of “mentions,” have been published by Messrs.
CHAPMAN AND HALL. Even a layman has the right to admire
the simple and restrained idiom, the orderly arrangement,
the essential modesty of these despatches. Two qualities
of the well-loved Commander who bore the shock of the
most desperate days of the War stand in especial relief—
generosity in his tributes to his subordinate commanders,
and tact in dealing with the difficulties and inevitable dis-
appointments of liaison, such as the “most unexpected
message" from General JoFFRE as to the overwhelming
advance of the German divisions on the eve of the retire-
ment from Mons, and the “fatigue” of General SoRDET's
horses. Of Sir Douglas HAIG and his divisional and
brigade commanders, the Field-Marshal, in a rare de-
parture from the plain level of his narrative, says, “Words
fail me to express the admiration I feel for their conduct,
or my sense of the incalculable services they rendered [at
the first battle of Ypres]. I venture to predict that their
deeds during these days of stress and trial will furnish
some of the most brilliant chapters which will be found in
the military history of our time.” Of the poison gas at
ing: “As a soldier I cannot help expressing the deepest
regret and some surprise that an army which hitherto has
claimed to be the chief exponent of the chivalry of war
should have stooped to employ such devices against brave
and gallant foes.” It must be good to have been called to
such a burden, to have carried it so finely, to have recorded
the story of it with such a simple candour.
It is not to be denied that Mr. HARRY TIGHE has at least
the courage of his convictions. These teach him that
women are as sheep, happiest in following the well-worn
path marked out for them by generations—love, matrimony,
maternity. The book that he has written to prove them is
called, inevitably, The Sheep Path (WESTALL). Its heroine,
Arethusa—Mr. TIGHE is clearly a counter-revolutionist;
none other could have dared such a name!—is shown
hesitating between love in the commercial equivalent of a
cottage, and £800 a year with the encumbrance of a
middle-aged husband. A conquering passion for plenty of
butter with her bread (it's all right; this is a pre-war tale)
drives Arethusa to turn her back on the sheep-path and
choose Jonathan Jones and comparative affluence. The
result shows Mr. TIGHE as an author with a very real gift
of observation; the development of Arethusa from girl to
womanhood, and the whole relations of the wife and her
husband are quite admirably drawn; the story here is at
its best, sympathetic and sure in scenes where it would
have been fatally easy to blunder. In the end, of course,
Arethusa returns d ses moutons. Widowed and im-

Old Lady (to post-office clerk). “Do You HAPPEN To BE ABLE To obLIGE ME witH A STAMP THIS MORNING, Miss? AND I could Do
WITH A couple of POSTCARDs IF YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THEM."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
No library of works about the War can be considered
decently equipped without a copy of The Complete
Despatches of Lord French, which, beautifully printed
(in a limited edition) by the Westminster Press and illus-
trated with excellent maps and portraits, to which is added
a full list of “mentions,” have been published by Messrs.
CHAPMAN AND HALL. Even a layman has the right to admire
the simple and restrained idiom, the orderly arrangement,
the essential modesty of these despatches. Two qualities
of the well-loved Commander who bore the shock of the
most desperate days of the War stand in especial relief—
generosity in his tributes to his subordinate commanders,
and tact in dealing with the difficulties and inevitable dis-
appointments of liaison, such as the “most unexpected
message" from General JoFFRE as to the overwhelming
advance of the German divisions on the eve of the retire-
ment from Mons, and the “fatigue" of General SoRDET's
horses. Of Sir Douglas HAIG and his divisional and
brigade commanders, the Field-Marshal, in a rare de-
parture from the plain level of his narrative, says, “Words
fail me to express the admiration I feel for their conduct,
or my sense of the incalculable services they rendered [at
the first battle of Ypres]. I venture to predict that their
deeds during these days of stress and trial will furnish
some of the most brilliant chapters which will be found in
the military history of our time.” Of the poison gas at
ing: “As a soldier I cannot help expressing the deepest
regret and some surprise that an army which hitherto has
claimed to be the chief exponent of the chivalry of war
should have stooped to employ such devices against brave
and gallant foes.” It must be good to have been called to
such a burden, to have carried it so finely, to have recorded
the story of it with such a simple candour.
It is not to be denied that Mr. HARRY TIGHE has at least
the courage of his convictions. These teach him that
women are as sheep, happiest in following the well-worn
path marked out for them by generations—love, matrimony,
maternity. The book that he has written to prove them is
called, inevitably, The Sheep Path (WESTALL). Its heroine,
Arethusa—Mr. TIGHE is clearly a counter-revolutionist;
none other could have dared such a name !—is shown
hesitating between love in the commercial equivalent of a
cottage, and £800 a year with the encumbrance of a
middle-aged husband. A conquering passion for plenty of
butter with her bread (it's all right; this is a pre-war tale)
drives Arethusa to turn her back on the sheep-path and
choose Jonathan Jones and comparative affluence. The
result shows Mr. TIGHE as an author with a very real gift
of observation; the development of Arethusa from girl to
womanhood, and the whole relations of the wife and her
husband are quite admirably drawn; the story here is at
its best, sympathetic and sure in scenes where it would
have been fatally easy to blunder. In the end, of course,
Arethusa returns d ses moutons. Widowed and im-

Rome and a villa at Portofino must be stretching the eight
hundred dangerously thin) she takes up again her old
work and the love she rejected in chapter one, thus
providing a fine exception to the rule about eating your
cake and having it. Mr. TIGHE has written a clever and
sincere story, on which I congratulate him heartily, with,
however, an entreaty that in his next he will guard against
a slovenly use of English that gives cause to the judicious
to grieve and obscures his real talent.
There is a story of an English author who, on arriving at
Khartoum, informed the Governor that he could only stay
for forty-eight hours, but that he wanted “to get at the
back of the Arab mind.” Mrs. T. P. O'Connor, though
she hails from Texas, where they live and act quickly, and
though she stayed for more than a year in Ireland, does not
Calder and its people, Mr. WATson changes to a note of
grave beauty that makes the end of his book unexpectedly
impressive. There is no great matter of plot, except the
love of two men for a delicate girl—a middle-aged minister
and the young son of a rich Southerner who is trying to
buy out the girl's father. These two parents, by the way,
are excellently drawn foils: the old laird, a dreamer, un-
practical, beaten on all sides by circumstance; and the
climbing opportunist, who bends circumstance to his own
ends and watches, not unsympathetically, the futile struggles
of his antagonist. But the book abounds in good portraits.
It has atmosphere, too, so that you can all but feel the keen
damp air, full of peat and ling scents, that seems to blow
through its pages. And by his art Mr. WATson can repro-
duce not only the wild landscapes of Scotland, but the
tenderness and the unconscious humour of her people. In

The Heritage of Elise
(ARNOLD) is concerned with
a question which I suggest
for discussion in cellars and
tubes, or wherever people con-
gregate and are allowed to
argue. Elise was a girl of the
streets, and Roger Arkwright,
a young man of philanthropic
instincts (but cautious withal),
suddenly discovered that she
was his cousin and entitled to
the millions which he had in-
herited. What ought he to do?
On the spur of the moment you
would say that there is only one
thing to do. But once begin to

however, one of his best say-

named Lynch: “Nature gave her an inch, but she took
an L.”) It is a vivacious, unmethodical chronicle, rich in
digressions, personal and even intimate sketches of her
friends and travelling companions, shrewd remarks and not
a little guide-book padding. Her tone is mainly uncritical,
which is the safest way in dealing with Ireland at present,
and she is not always accurate. For example, Parknasilla,
as I have good reason to know, is not situated on a low cliff;
and Mrs. O'Connor's reproduction of the brogue is more
vigorous than faithful. But criticism is disarmed by her frank
admission of her limitations and her modest comparison of
her book to the hors d'oeuvre served before a banquet.
One might perhaps pardonably say of Mr. FREDERICR
WATson that, as the son of IAN MACLAREN, he had been
educated in the Kailyard school. What use he made of
this upbringing he has already proved, and now does so
again with his new story, Children of Passage (METHUEN).
It is a tale of Scotland and of Scots folk, told with a very
pleasant charm of style and much quiet fun, at least in the
Roger as a mere mercenary, but recognizes and appreciates
his motives. It is a thoughtful tale, and though its subject
is not too pleasant the seriousness with which it is treated
saves it from the fear of offence. The most dramatic touch
comes at the end, when Elise, in ignorance of her wealth,
bequeaths all she possesses, to a benevolent and broad-
minded parson, who finds the will and tears it up. Roger
had some luck.

ENGLAND'S GALL TO THE RABBIT.
CoME out, come out, and play the game;
Boldly vacate your burrow;
Slack not nor shirk for very shame,
But be your watchword “Thorough”;
Step forth as briskly as you can
And face the music like a man.
Stay not to share the Cuthbert's ſate,
But chuck your rôle of coward;
We watch you, knowing well how great
The sacrifice and how hard ;
In all your paws your courage take
And do your turn for England's sake.
Shall she, the land that gave you birth,
Go short of food and sicken 2
She needs you for her hollow girth
Disguised as curried chicken;
Come, ere the precious hour is lost,
And join our patriot holocaust.
We are prepared to comb you out
By way of fuse or ferret, -
But you would sooner earn, no doubt,
- The meed of willing merit—
Posthumous knighthood (K.B.E),
Or damehood, as the case may be.
Yonder the Boy-Scout waits to shoot
(Dulce pro patria mori !);
Give him the moribund's salute
And rush to death and glory,
Passing, amid ecstatic Cheeros,
Straight to Walhalla's hall of heroes.
And should the errant scatter-gun
Wherewith he hopes to hit you
Misjudge your swiftness as you run,
Halt and remain in situ,
And let him pop and pop and pop
Until you ultimately drop. -
Or, if you have no strong desire
To meet a death so messy,
And feel that in a noose of wire
Your corpse would look more dressy,
Insert your neck within a trap—
It's all the same to ARTHUR YAPP.
So shall your valour save the race
And strike the KAISER stony;
And o'er your carcase, singing grace,
We'll bless the name of coney,
And say, “His end was very good;
He died as British rabbits should.”

THE MUD LARKS.
A JAP halibut fisher who landed at asked,
Big Silver Camp four years ago told
me that he found a family of skunks
housekeeping in the office and a grizzly
licking berries off a bush by the engine-
shed.
In my day it was a lusty camp.
Two hundred and seventy there were
of us on the pay-roll, men of all nations,
nesting, like cormorants, on cliff ledges
high above the Pacific surf.
Big Silver, king of the Coast Range,
loomed over us, forest-flanked, snow-
bonnetted, his hoary head, like that
of Mr. W. B. YEATs' friend, “hid among
a crowd of stars.” -
It was a pleasant camp in summer.
Gulls swooped and cried about the
crane head; seals sunned themselves
on the flat rocks below the cliffs; now
and again on the lazy swell seaward
a whale would blow. But in winter
it was altogether another story. The
Pacific woke out of its trance and sent
its white horses charging landward in
foaming squadrons that nearly shook
our little 'shacks off their perilous
perches. -
Rain fell for weeks on end; snow
buried us six foot under. Winter on
that coast was, in the vivid language of
the West, “a ring-tailed snorter.”
I lived in a six-bunk shack known
as “Little Dublin" along with a brace
of machine men, a powder monkey and
Mike Duggan, the shifter.
We were “all - white ” in “Little
Dublin" and very exclusive, and, as
we saw nobody who came up to our
dizzy standard, the sixth bunk remained
empty all the summer.
Mike Duggan was the bright star
of our galaxy. He was the best type
of Western “rough neck,” six foot of
wire and raw hide, humour and effi-
ciency. He had prospected from the
Arctic Circle to Mexico, from Korea to
the Porcupine. When a “mucker” put
his pick into a missed hole and all was
| flying rock, blackness and groans it
was Mike's cool voice ringing through
the inferno that kept the Dagos from
stampeding.
When the Camp Liar told a tale of
the cold on Hudson's Bay that froze
the steam at a kettle's spout into a
bubble of ice it was Mike who had put
out a fire in Alaska by chopping the
frozen flames off the back of a stove
with an axe. I never saw a situation
he couldn't master or heard a yarn he
couldn't cap.
When the first frost of winter nipped
us by the nose Mike cast his eye on
the empty bunk and voted that it be
filled. “The more the warmer,” said
he. We were in complete agreement;
but who should be the lucky man 2
“How about John the Bohunk?” he
We stared at him, aghast. A
Bohunk' A wild, jabbering foreign
animal from some dark Central Euro-
pean hinterland, who in his natural
state had very probably dressed in
woad and hair, slept in a tree, devoured
his young and drunk his bath-water.
Such a one in “Little Dublin,” the all-
white, the exclusive' We told Mike
that he had gone mad, or, speaking the
language of the land, had ants in his
attic, bats in his belfry. He let us
have our hiss, all of us; then, when our
steam was spent, calmly proceeded.
“Listen, you mutts. Winter has
done arrived and somebody's gotter do
bull-cook round this joint, sweep the
floor, shovel the drifts, tote wood, light
the stove and keep her roarin'. Whose
goin' to do it? You? He Any of
us? No, sirree, we're all too high-fed
and noble-minded. Now I've been
takin' account of this yer John, and
he's just a poor, simple ignorant
Bohunk with one bug in his bonnet
and that is to be mistaken for a white
man. We'll have the silly dub in
here, make out to learn him how to
behave white, and in return he does the
chores, all of 'em. Does it go?”
We made a show of objecting, but
Mike was Mike, and next night the
sixth bunk was no longer empty. Our
victim was originally a denizen of
Hungary, I believe, but we made no
subtle racial distinctions in the North-
West ; all that was not white, Dutch
or Dago was Bohunk to us. He was
a squat touzled creature, with bow
legs, hairy paws and the pathetic eyes
of an Aberdeen terrier, ever upturned
to his hero, Mike, in dog-like devo-
tion.
If anyone ever had to work his way
through college it was that wretched
Bohunk. Never did the door open but
an avalanche of snow fell within. A
trail of slush followed every pair of
boots across the floor. The stove was
tricky to light and a glutton when lit;
a night's supply of fuel necessitated at
least six trips to the wood-pile, fifty
yards away down the cliff path. And
all these details had to be faithfully
attended to by the Bohunk in return
for the inestimable advantages he was
receiving by living in our company.
Sometimes when the so-called Pacific
was booming against the jetty with
exceptional fury and the Behring gale
whooping like a drunken cow-puncher
down the stove-pipe he would falter,
turn sulky, and mumble that it was
someone else's turn to tote wood. Then
we would shake our heads sadly and
tell him what a disappointment he was
to us after all our trouble. “Gee,

The rainbow beauty of a dream,

From peaceful worlds above,
Against the onslaught of despair

A WAR SACRIFICE.
WHEN at the beginning of the year
my wife suggested that we should both
make a further war economy, I had no
difficulty in deciding what to do. I
determined at once to give up smok-
ing. The resolution, momentous as it
was, cost me little effort. Naturally a
man of strong will, I have long accus-
tomed myself to acts of self-denial,
particularly in connection with my
smoking career. For the last ten years
I have on each 1st of January definitely
forsworn tobacco for the future in
every form, and in 1916 I burnt my
pipes behind me on at least four dif-
ferent occasions. A fairly good record,
you will agree.
My wife was dead against the idea.
She was sure I should never keep to
my resolution. Besides, she liked to
see me smoking; a man about the
house without a pipe in his mouth,
she said, always reminded her of a dog
without a collar. I confess that her
attitude surprised and pained me. But
was I, merely in order to give her the
pleasure of seeing me pulling at my
pipe, to go on spending on tobacco a
weekly sum which should have been at
the service of the country 2
Finally I hit on a compromise. On
all occasions when I was not actually
with my wife I would give up tobacco;
but in order to seem to comply with her
wishes I would, when in her presence,

pipe. Thus I should have the satis-
faction of feeling that I had made a
double sacrifice—first, in conquering a
bad habit, and, secondly, in denying
myself, for my wife's sake, the total
abstention on which my heart had been
set. You may judge of the amount of
hard thinking it cost me to reach this
decision when I tell you that, though I

piece, and took a stroll in the garden till
she should come downstairs. Already I
was beginning to miss my wife terribly.
A pang of regret shot through me as
I reflected how often I had neglected
her in the past. Life at the best was
all too short. For the future I would
make amends by spending as many of
its hours as possible in her company.
I was just on the point of going up-
stairs (with my pipe) to see if I could
help her when she entered the kitchen.
I immediately sat down and lit up.
We spent a very happy three hours
together in the kitchen, and at lunch I

to mid-day we might effect an economy
in fuel, since there would be no need to
have a study fire going. She seemed
a little doubtful about it, I thought,
but promised to give the matter her
consideration.
It is my wife's custom to rest a while
after lunch on the Chesterfield in the
drawing-room. As she does not allow
smoking there, I decided at first this
afternoon to go for another stroll in
the garden. But it was a cold raw
day, and soon I found myself inside
the house again. Something seemed to
impel me irresistibly towards the draw-
ing-room door. I opened it softly
and listened. Yes, she was how shall
I put it?—she was breathing deeply. I
proceeded on tip-toe across the room,
sat down close by the fender and lit my
pipe. For an hour or so I sat there,
affectionately regarding the face of my
sleeping wife.
At last she stirred. Within three
seconds I had stuffed my pipe into my
pocket, plunged into an armchair and
buried myself behind the newspaper.
She opened her eyes and started slightly
on seeing me.
“Is that you, Horace?”
“Yes,” I answered truthfully.
She sat up and sniffed. “I can
smell smoke.”
When presence of mind is needed I
am seldom at a loss. I sniffed too.
“Something burning in the kitchen' "
I exclaimed, and, leaping up, I dashed
from the room.
It was on the eighth day, I think,
that my wife struck. Returning home
to tea that afternoon after a brisk
walk into the country, I found a note
for me on the hall table. She had
gone, she wrote, to stay (she hoped
only temporarily, but the duration of
her visit depended on myself) with her
mother. Much as she loved me, she
felt that there were limits to the num-
ber of hours that any husband, however
devoted, should spend in the society of
his wife. She had guessed my secret,
she said, and proposed an alternative,
which was that I should reverse my
procedure and confine my smoking to
occasions when we were not together.
If I would agree to this she would
come back to me.
In a crisis where rapid and decisive
action is imperative I am (as I just
now hinted) always at my best. I
seized my hat, strode to the post-office
and telegraphed as follows: “Accept
suggested arrangement. All forgiven.
Please return immediately.”

A DEAD LANGUAGE.
LookING decidedly worried, the young
French Lieutenant, after a rough pas-
sage along the corridor of the South-
ward-bound night express, precipitated
himself into the compartment occupied
by the English Colonel who had been
so polite to him at Edinburgh.
“Pardon, mon Colonel, mille pardons!”
he gasped as the train, taking a curve
at high speed, playfully flung him on
top of the Colonel, who had been doz-
ing peacefully in a corner. “There is
danger,” he added, saluting as he re-
gained his equilibrium.
The Colonel, shocked and breathless,
fortunately remembered that the French
are our Allies, and refrained from ex-
pressing his heartfelt opinions.
“It is my duty to report to you, my
Colonel, that there are two very sus-
picious characters travelling by this
train,” the Lieutenant proceeded hastily
in his precise English, and paused dra-
matically. “I believe them to be Ger-
man spies, my Colonel, and I thought
you would wish to investigate,” he
continued impressively, lowering his
voice. “They talk a strange language
which I cannot identify. It is neither
English, French, German nor Italian
—I comprehend and speak all these—
and each man has with him a bag of
strange tools or weapons.”
“Humph 1 Sounds mysterious,” com-
mented the Colonel, now thoroughly
awake and quite interested. “Where
are these foreign workmen 2"
“They are not workmen, my Colonel,
and they are travelling by the first-
class in my compartment,” explained
the Lieutenant. “That is what aroused
my suspicions. They are dressed
strangely also, these men, in grotesque
costumes. I think they are masquer-
ading as English sportsmen.”
“They may be German spies,” said
the Colonel, “disguised as English
sportsmen returning from their allot-
ments. Have you questioned them 2"
“One of the men endeavoured to
engage me in conversation, but I
could not understand well. He spoke
the English with what you call the
accent—guttural, n'est-ce pas ?—and
when I responded brusquely he com-
ments to his companion in his own
language. It is an extraordinary lan-
guage, my Colonel, interspersed with
words which sound like English.”
“Probably one of the Scandinavian
tongues,” said the Colonel thought-
fully. “I'd like to have a look at the
fellows and see what I can make of
'em. Go back to your own carriage
and I'll come along in a few minutes,
ostensibly to ask you for a match.”
parted. He found on re-entering his own
compartment that his mysterious fellow-
travellers were still engaged in an ani-
mated discussion in their own tongue.
The strange men merely glanced at the
Colonel when, a few minutes later, he
entered the compartment and, having
successfully borrowed a match, sat
down beside the Lieutenant to listen.
“Aff the fourth tee ower the burrn I
sclaffed my drive and had to tak' the
niblick to get oot,” the stranger in the
hairiest and loudest suit was explaining
to his companion. “The rough 's a'
whins, but I put the ba’ on the pretty,
chanced a baffie shot although I'd got
a hanging lie, and got a pull on it, but
it just slithered ower the bunker on the
left o' the fairway—the ane they ca' the
Maiden—and the mashie took me bang
up to the pin and I got a four. Halved
it, mind ye, and got a bogie after Sclaff-
ing my drive.”
“No' an easy bogie either,” com-
mented his companion; “but you get
as far nearly wi' your mashie as I do
wi' my cleek.”
“I used to play a fine shot with a
mashie-niblick myself.” broke in the
Colonel, to the amazement of the
Lieutenant, and proceeded to converse.
with the strangers in their own lan-
uage.
“Well, what do you make of them,
Sir?” inquired the Lieutenant eagerly,
half-an-hour or so later, when he had
followed the Colonel back to his com-
partment.
“One of them is a plus three man
and the other is scratch,” the Colonel
answered absently. “They've been at
Carnoustie. Once I did a ninety gross
there myself and I was rather off my
pº. -
He became aware of the fact that
the Lieutenant was gazing at him in
blank perplexity, and he laughed.
“You don't understand even now.
Those chaps are survivals of a pre-war
period, and they've made me feel quite
young again. It was a dead language
we were talking, Lieutenant. Jove'
I liked those baggy Harris tweeds, and
it brought back old memories to argue
about Dunlops and Challengers and
BRAID and VARDON.”
“But—but the language, my Colonel,”
inquired the Lieutenant, completely
mystified—“what was the language?”
“Golf, my friend, golf,” said the
Colonel. “You should learn it; but don't
use the idiomatic phrases in drawing-
rooms.”

Where once the godsend glistened
Lone, lone amidst a shop-bought crew
There was one egg superbly new
And longed for; now there isn't.
The egg that Mildred used to lay !
How tenderly she tucked it --
Each morn within its bed of hay,
When all her pals for many a day
Had got cold feet and chucked it.
But now by winter's icy trance
Poor Mildred too is smothered ;
And now at breakfast is no chance
To spot, to seize by bold advance,
The egg that Mildred mothered.
For always, having broached his shell
With mute but anxious features,
Someone would say, “I am not well,”
And someone rise to ring the bell,
Crying, “Remove the creatures!”
But always someone would bespeak
St. GEORGE or else St. PATRick,
And, helped by heavenly favour, sneak
The egg, the glorious egg. Last week
But now no more, or not again

Think that she will, “Lor' love her!!”
Then let us hang large cabbage stalks
For her to jump and eat 'em,
And charm her with instructive talks
| And take her out long healthy walks
All around the arboretum, -
And mix her puddings made of scraps
More succulent than ever,
And tie her throat with many wraps
Till triumph at the last, perhaps,
Shall crown the great endeavour;
Till hot-foot she shall come to say
In accents arch and sprightly,
“Something has fallen in the hay !”
And, if the boon be mine that day,
I hope they'll boil it lightly.

[JANUARY 23, 1918.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, January 14th-TheTheatre
1 Royal, Westminster, has resumed the
“two-houses - a-night” system. The
Lords, who have been putting in over-
time while the Commons were rest-
ing, were again busy with Woman's
Suffrage; in the Commons Sir Auck-
LAND GEDDEs was in charge of the
Combing-out Bill.
Singularly unlike his brother, the
FIRST Lord of THE ADMIRALTY, both
in voice and mien, Sir AUCKLAND re-
sembles him in distrust of his oratorical
ability. What he humorously called
his “notes” lay in a huge pile on the
brass-bound box, and to them he stuck
most religiously for the hour-and a-half
that his speech lasted. -
It was a good speech, crammed full of
important facts and figures, and showed
that its author had thoroughly mastered
his difficult subject. But one could not
help wishing that, following the PRIME
MINISTER's recent example, he had
consulted Mr. Asquith—that artist in
condensation—before he made it.
I am afraid, however, that Mr.
Asquith, being a cautious mán and
morbidly timid of Labour, would have
struck out the passage in , which
Sir AUCKLAND, rising for once to his
full height, fulminated against the
young men sheltering in the shipyards
and munition factories who were quite
willing to let their fathers fight for
them and wounded men be sent to the
Front again and again.
When the DIRECTor of NATIONAL
SERVICE at last sat down, no one rose
from the Front Opposition Bench either
to criticise or to pay the usual compli-
ments to a Minister making his maiden
speech. Happily Mr. PRINGLE is equal
to any emergency and promptly filled
the breach, though, needless to say, the
proportion of compliment to criticism
in his remarks was as the poor penny-
worth of bread to the intolerable deal
of sack in Falstaff's tavern-reckoning. ||
His rebuke of some of the less judicious
obiter dicta in Sir AUCKLAND's oration
—there was a passage about casualties
and another about Russia which cer-
tainly would not have survived the
Asquithian blue-pencil—was a little
like a certain gentleman rebuking Sin,
but in the main it was a good debating
effort, and freer than usual from the
cocksureness which is the self-imposed
obstruction in the way of Mr. PRINGLE's
Parliamentary progress.
Tuesday, January 15th. — In the
Upper Chamber a final effort was made
to defeat Woman's Suffrage. Lord
BERESFORD supported the opposition,
not because he thinks women indifferent
will take to them too kindly. He drew
a gloomy picture of the future, when
women would conduct all the business
of the House of Commons, while mere
men had to look on from behind the
bars of a reconstituted grille. But only

sixty-two Peers supported his view, and
the Suffragists surmounted their last
obstacle by a majority of 28.
The independence of Finland has
already been recognised by the Ger-
man, Swedish and French Govern-
ments, but news of it has apparently
not yet reached our Foreign Office.
At least Mr. BALFour spoke of Finland
being now “in process of constituting
herself an independent Republic,” and
intimated that the British Government
MR. G. N. BARNEs siTs on THE WINSTON
were waiting until the process was
complete. Further pressed, he said
that before according formal recogni-
tion they ought to know “what the
Russian people think on the subject,”
but omitted to explain whom in present
circumstances he means by “the
Russian people.”
To a question whether unity of
command, in the sense of the appoint-
ment of a generalissimo, had been
established on the Western Front, Mr.
BoNAR LAw replied in the negative.
“An incredible answer,” said Mr.
LYNCH; and when an identical question
regarding the Italian Front received
the same reply, he strode out of the
House after ostentatiously tearing up
his Question-paper. It is generally
thought that his anxiety to win the
War would have been more completely
demonstrated if he had converted the
fragments into spills.
Captain CoIIN Coote took his seat
for the Wisbech division. So little
interest is taken now-a-days in by-
elections that hardly anybody could put
a name to this tall slim figure in khaki.
Would it not be a good idea if, “for
the duration,” at any rate, the SPEAKER
were formally to announce to the House
the name and constituency of the
newly-elected 2 I put aside, as un-
worthy the dignity of Parliament, the
suggestion that these details should be
flashed upon a cinema-screen.
Wednesday, January 16th.-Mr.S.Now.
DEN, as they say, “has a nerve.” He
actually wanted to know why the Con-
scientious Objectors in the Non-Com-
batant Corps do not receive the full
increase in pay recently granted to the
fighting-men, and seemed surprised
when Mr. ForsTER informed him that
as they were not employed in the
danger-zone their pay would only con-
form to their liability.
A new official reason has been found
for the continuance of horse-racing.
Hitherto the necessity of keeping up the
breed of horses has been the principal
motive alleged; but the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER now stated that, in
his mind, the main consideration was
non-interference with the “habits of the
people.” Were it not for the beneficent
existence of bookmakers they would
not know what to do with their spare
cash and might be clamouring for
Premium Bonds.
Without waiting for the permission
of the PREss CENsor The Daily Mail
announced the sinking of a hospital

Mr. CHURCHILL had quite a full day.
First he found his name in all the
headlines in consequence of a speech
delivered about him by Mr. BARNEs in
Glasgow. Then he came down to the
House and learnt that the Government
had decided to publish the final report
of the Dardanelles Commission, the
mere mention of which always gives
him goose-flesh. After that he dis-
creetly withdrew while Mr. BARNEs,
under the guise of a personal explana-
tion, made a hearty meal of everything
that he had said the day before.
It was all the fault of the Scotch
reporters—notoriously inaccurate fel-
lows. They ought to have known that
when he referred six or seven times to
Mr. CHURCHILL's order he was really
referring to the Cabinet's order; that
when he said “Mr. CHURCHILL butted
in " he meant “we butted in "; and
that his description of the Govern-
ment as “living on the top of a
veritable volcano" had no reference
to the MINISTER of MUNITIONs, who,
as everybody knows, cannot be sat
upon.
Thursday, January 17th.-Members
learned with some concern the FooD
CoNTRoLLER's intention to reduce the
price of fish. They fear it will have
| the effect of driving this wholesome
food from the market, and would
sooner have a herring in the hand
than two in the queue.
The Board of Education is composed
of many eminent persons who never
hold a meeting. Sir CHARLEs BATHURST
considers that it isotiose and ought to be
disbanded; but Mr. FISHER deprecated
interference with “this dignified body,”
which never interferes with him.
On the new Military Service Bill the
Ulstermen's plea for conscription in
Ireland was rejected after Sir AUCK-
LAND GEDDEs had declared that it
would be of no use as a solution of the
present difficulty. He did not give his
reasons, but they are believed to be
Conventional.
The rest is silence, for, on the motion
of Mr. PRINGLE, the House went into
Secret Session in order that Mr. Hogg|E
might use language presumably unfit
for publication. Whatever it was it
did not prevent the second reading
being carried without a division.

cheerfully these sensible folk will stand
outside the early doors for hour after

though it rains and snows. An object-
lesson indeed!
But to the wonder of the programme,
which seems to me—perhaps I am
wrong, but that is the impression con-
veyed—to improve every week. Think
of such a galaxy of stars in one
evening as Bonnie Bessie Rabia, the
| Great Little Much, the Eight Imbecile
| Grocers, Reely and Trewly, Posco, and
those favourite mirth-makers, the Levi
| Lewis Co. in a side-splitting sketch,
|“The Best 'Ole.” Imagination boggles
at it. It is too lavish. But that is
the Melodium way.
The head and front of the evening
was, of course, the one and only Bessie
|Rabia, who was at the top of her form
|—over the top, I might say, to use a
phrase which will appeal to the many
military patrons of this favourite house
of entertainment. I don't know what
it was—probably the electrieity that
this woman of genius always infuses
into an audience—but her effect was
astounding. Always topical and tren-
chant, I hardly need say that she has
a song about Food Control. More than
a song—an epic, with such a tune to it!
We all came out humming it, while
those who were fortunate enough to
remember the words sang it too, revel-
|ling in the sly satire of its lines:—
Now RHoNDDA is a wonder, I don't think;

Feats of dexterity are always fasci-

quite such perfect juggling as that
evinced by Posco, the marvellous boy
equilibrist. CINQUEv.ALLI in his palmy
days was a master, but I venture to
consider Posco even greater than he.
Certainly some of his tricks—notably
balancing a walking-stick on the very
tip of one finger for nearly a minute of
time–CINQUEvaLLI never offered the
public at all.
And then the back-chat couple—

many exponents of this difficult art in
my time, from the Two MACs onwards,
but none of them can compare in
wit and alertness with the Melodium
humorists, Reely and Trewly. Which
is the funnier it would be hard to say.
Go and make up your minds about it

THE HERO-BIGAMIST.
“WHAT,” said Francesca, “does the Recorder really do?”
“The Recorder?” I said. “I am not quite sure about
him, but I think he does quite a lot of recording.”
“Do you mean that he fills up his spare time with it?”
“No,” I said, “I don't mean that. In fact I mean just
the opposite. It's his business to record, and he fills up his
business time with it. But we never see him recording.
He does it in the dark, you know, and then in his spare
time he acts as a Judge—at least that's how I fancy it's
managed. But what has made you so keen on Recorders
| this morning?”
“This paper says that the Recorder had before him a
man charged with bigamy.” - -
“They will do it,” I murmured. “They find it difficult
to keep away from marriage when they've once got started.”
“Well, this man had fought at Mons.”
“A splendid exhibition of heroism,” I said.
“That is exactly what the Recorder said; he said that
the man was a hero, and he was going to treat all Mons
fighters brought before him as heroes. So he discharged
him and - 1 - -
“And there was loud applause in court, and the Recorder
said the court was not a theatre, and if it occurred again he
would have the court cleared ' "
“No,” she said, “I don't see that.”
“That's odd; they mostly say that.”
“Perhaps,” she said, “it’s only full-blown Judges who
say that kind of thing. Anyhow, I don't see that the
Recorder said anything of that kind. He just told the man
he was a hero and let him go; and he added that he meant
to deal with all similar heroes in the same way.” . . . . .
“It’s a grand recognition of courage,” I said. “In these
namby-pamby days we ought to reward a display of the
primitive virtues.” - - - - -
“But what,” said Francesca, “about the poor second
woman 2 She doesn't get much of a show, does she?”
“No,” I said, “she doesn't ; but then, you see, she never
ſought at Mons.”
“Then of course,” said Francesca, “she isn't a hero, and
so she has got to take her punishment for having believed
a hero who deceived her.”
“The Recorder didn't say anything about her, did he?”
“No,” said Francesca, “I can't find that he did. He just
invited all heroic bigamists to trot up before him and he'd
see that nothing was done to them. That sounds like abol-
ishing the Ten Commandments in favour of the old army.”
“It means more than that... If it is logically carried out
it means abolishing the Criminal Law of England.”
“But perhaps Recorders are not logical.” : -
“I don't think they have to pass an examination in logic
in order to become Recorders.” . . - -
“No,” she said, “I should think not. And yet women
are not allowed to go to the Bar or to be promoted to the
Bench.” - - -
“But you can soon alter that. In about a quarter of an
hour from now six millions of you will have votes, and you
will then be in a position to tell the Recorder what you
think of him.” -
“I shan't think too much of him,” said Francesca, “even
if he does allow heroes to dabble in bigamy.” R. C. L.

Spanish Proverb.
“He that hath a nimble tongue may even get to Rome.”
So say the lightfoot gipsy folk who know all Earth as home.
But since the world is very big they drift about in Spain
And take their fill of wandering and then set out again.
Some lead, along the Seville road, a life of dusty ease,
Some cross the rolling Mancha and the snowy Pyrenees,
And northward to the Puy de Dôme and eastward to
Marseilles
They clip the mules in patterns and they dock the donkeys'
tails.
Alas! the world has lost its way, as never gipsy could,
And shells are blasting from our sight deer-track and
beechen wood,
Where FRANÇois PREMIER loved to hunt and soothe his
- soul of old -
When sated with an Entente's pomp and sick of Cloth of
Gold. -
The little twilight winds at dusk which stirred the sleeping
leaves
Now moan around each riven branch while all the forest
grieves - -
That where the wood-smoke used to rise from gipsy fires
a glow
The starshells and the Verey lights now hissing come and go.
Yet you may find the gipsy men spread far from sea to sea;
'Tis still the land of Romany wherever they may be;
And some are back in Egypt, whence the earliest Gippy
Came ,
They may take the field as soldiers, yet the wandering's
their game.
And, though the chals must risk their lives in many a bitter
fight,
Still on Piave's blood-stained banks their brazier glows at
night, -
For under arms the wander-folk yet find a chance to roam
Where he that hath a nimble tongue may even get to Rome.
SALWAGE,
JUST now the authorities are taking a keen interest in
salvage. This means that we, the 2nd Royal Fermanagh
Fusiliers, when not actively engaged in fighting battles, sally
out in parties of thirty, forty and sometimes more, and mop
up any material that may be lying about—shells, shell-cases,
corrugated iron, bully-beef tins, picks, shovels and rifles.
Yesterday, X Company, led by Captain O'Neil, set forth at
6 A.M. with instructions to collect shells, shells and yet more
shells from a certain corner of Y area. At 3 P.M. the party
returned, the men had their dinners, “got down to it,” and
all was peace. - - * - - - - -
At 5 P.M. our Adjutant received instructions “to report
in person at Division H.Q. (Q) without delay." Q did not
keep Maloney long, but passed him on to another dug-out,
two doors off, where a Brigadier-General of Artillery, com-
plete with Staff-Officer in attendance, awaited him.
“Ah, are you the Adjutant of the Fermanaghs?” he
began. “I wish to congratulate you on the magnificent
way your men worked this morning.”
Maloney, glowing with pride, waited for him to continue.
“Two thousand shells did they shift from Y area; and
my men have had to spend the whole afternoon shifting
them back again. You collected the whole of one of my

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THESE German writers! Well might the one just
inhabitant of the Fatherland (supposing such an indi-
vidual to exist) cry aloud to be saved from his propagandists.
The latest solo upon the Teutonic trumpet is played by no
less high-sounding a performer than Lieutenant-General
Baron voN FREYTAG-LoRINGhoveN. This gentleman occu-
pies, it appears, the position (to which however there
are other claimants) of “the most distinguished soldier-
writer of Prussia,” his expositions of the noble science of the
jack-boot having procured for him, by a deliciously native
touch, the decoration Pour le Mérite (Peace Class). The
exalted Herr Baron has embodied his most distinguished
conclusions upon the world-tragedy (which is not at all
what he would call it) in the little book before me, Deduc-
tions From The World War (CoNSTABLE). These deductions
could hardly have appeared at a moment more unhappy for
their author or more fortunate for a world that was perhaps
in some danger of believing the Prussian wolf repentant.
To all who have been conscious of the lure of such an
amiable folly let me commend the deduction which sums
up the Baronial philosophy: “Any such agreements [to
prevent future wars] will aſter all only be treaties which
will not on every occasion be capable of holding in check
the forces seething within the States. The idea of a uni-
versal league . . . would be felt as an intolerable tutelage
by any great and proud-spirited nation.” So there you
have it. Not for the first time, but seldom more forthright,
I suppose that what C. N. and A. M. WILLIAMSON don't
know about the dramatic possibilities of the motor-car is
hardly worth knowing. Their new volume of stories, Tiger
Lily (MILLS AND BooN) shows their store of petrol-adven-
tures to be still unexhausted. Probably, but for considera-
tions of crispness, the book would have been called He Who
Stole and Rode Away, since this is the title of the longest
and most important tale in the collection. It is a brisk
affair of an heiress, of fortune-hunters and (of course)
a god in the car, and gets its topical interest from the fact
that the scene of it, ranging from Innsbruck to the Piave,
has lately attained some tragic notoriety. Some of the
other stories are concerned with gambling at Monte Carlo,
always a background rich in suggestion and intrigue; but
though these provide usually a promising situation they
left me, for the most part, with a feeling that the dénoue-
ment, explanation, or whatever it is, had scarcely fulfilled
this promise. Can it be, I wonder, that Mrs. WILLIAMSON
murders the victim, or arranges the coup, or generally
complicates matters after this exhilarating fashion and then
leaves poor Mr. W. to find the best solution he can 2 One
other story tells of the trick played by a rich young woman
upon an equally rich young man who criticised her philan-
thropic methods; it is called “A Cure for Wealth"—a bad
title, since the young man was so far from being cured that
his relapse (he married the millionairess) left him richer
than ever. It is a merry little piece of nonsense that would
make a good curtain-raiser.

:
SABATINI has done a shrewd thing in his Historical Nights'
Entertainment (SECKER), gathering together for our delec-
tation, in a sanguinary sheaf, some horrific tales of sundry
nights of terror, and presenting his historical characters
in a setting of known fact with plausible embroideries
of conjecture. Of these thirteen tales—ominous number–
no fewer than eleven are tales of murder, private or
judicial, achieved or attempted. This would perhaps seem
a somewhat morbid idea of entertainment; but the author
does not focus on the horrors, but rather on the play of
motive and the traits of character. And I must say, who
am no expert and can oppose no counter-contentions to his
audacious theories, that he has contrived a very respecta-
ble entertainment. RIZZIO, DARNLEY, Lady ALICE LISLE,
CoLIGNY's Huguenots, GUSTAvus III., CESARE Borgia's
brother GANDIA and some three thousand citizens of Nantes,
are among the list of the victims, and the tragedy-comedy
of the great Affair of the Diamond Necklace and an escape
of CASANov.A from prison |
are the only two bloodless
episodes. I think I dare
commend the book even to
the gentle. The average
unregenerate man ought to
enjoy it all hugely.
Mr. GERARD FIENNES, in
Sea Power and Freedom
(SKEFFINGTON), states that
“the British boy, taught
history in the schools, can
name five British victories
on land to every three at
sea,” and goes on to remark
that the proportion is a
strange one for the greatest
Sea Power in the history
of the world. If his book
compels attention to the
elementary fact that the
British Empire has de-
pended for its development
upon its sea-power it will
do a sound piece of service.

is not glorious adventure I do not know what is, and it
would seem that there still may be glamour in war. As a
history of General SMUTs's sweep down the Pangani river,
beginning later than the conquest of the Kilimanjaro country
and ending before the approach to the Central Railway, the
book is a businesslike account of a fighting retreat by the
Huns and of resistance much more strenuous on the part
of tsetse and mosquitos; yet when it is told by the author,
new home from listening to strange bird-songs in a land
where the stars are strange, it is no wonder that it becomes
something infinitely more. There is a glow of tropic heat
and beauty about it, a vista of dry desert and hard blue
mountains, and a sense of the bigness of the new crude
land that has gained a soul from the fighting travail of lean
suffering invaders. And the book has a hero, or rather
two. One is the writer, though little enough he seems to
guess it, and the other is the General whose greatness
warred with the greatness of waste Africa and wrought
- upon it victory. Not often

our Navy for granted. Mr. FIENNES, though very rightly
claiming the Battle of Jutland as a British victory, argues
that, if it was not so decisive as a people nourished on the
traditions of the Nile and Trafalgar were inclined to expect,
the fault did not lie with the Navy, but with the loose
talkers who have never appreciated the changes which
modern developments have brought with them. We want
to be educated before we have any right to criticise, and I
suggest Mr. FIENNES’ book as a pleasant and profitable
study for those of us who have neglected to instruct our-
selves in naval affairs. Here you will find an account of
both ancient and modern Sea Powers, a carefully considered
judgment upon our Navy's actions in the present War,
and some excellent illustrations. “Whenever,” says Mr.
FIENNEs, “a tyrant has come into conflict with sea-power
it has broken him.” It is a consoling thought, and I
recommend it as a tonic to the most determined pessimists.
Capt. BRETT YouNg's latest romance, Marching on Tanga
(CoLLINs), deals with all manner of fascinating things such
as sound boys choose for their literature; yet it is no novel,
but a volume dealing in all seriousness with a part of the
the popping of the novelists' six-shooters in the Alaskan
wilderness. All of which is a prelude to the practical state-
ment that you should buy The Triumph of John Kars
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), read it and send it to the Y.M.C.A.
for the delectation of our fighting men. You may be too
sophisticated to enjoy it yourself—that is your misfortune—
but they will not be, and the important thing is that you
should send it to them. Mr. RIDGwBLL CULLUM is a past-
master of this type of fiction, and his story of the Yukon
lacks none of his accustomed entertainment. The lure of
gold, the glamour of saloon and dance-hall, Indians and
trappers, fur traders and prospectors, all contribute to our
entertainment. The villain is perhaps a little too villainous,
and the hero rather more heroic than mortal hero could
reasonably be expected to be. That is of no consequence.
The types are truthfully drawn, their talk is real talk, and
we are made to realise the enduring warfare between the
iron North and the unconquerable soul of Man the Pioneer.
More than that for five shillings no decent reader would
demand. — "

For joy of punctures blown in Goeben's side,
Or (if you like it better) Sultan Selim's.
Beached on the Narrows' shore she lies a wreck,
Having, in Teuton parlance, “lightly grounded,”
And there, I hear, she gets it in the neck
All day and night by British airmen pounded.
Never again, we'll hope, the beastly thing
(This is indeed a providential loss for us)
Snug at her moorings off Stamboul shall swing
And stain with German bilge my balmy Bosphorus.
No more her alien officers, I deem,
Shall here behave like little gods on castors,
Or train their curséd guns on my hareem
To mend my manners to my German masters.
No more emerging from a year's repose
(The time to readjust a damaged piston)
Shall she decline conclusions with her foes
And run for harbour with a heavy list on.
Tracing to her the source of all my woe,
I might have worn a visage yet more shiny
Had she but definitely gone below,
“Spurlos versenkt" beneath the open briny.
Still, as a stranded hulk, she suits my game,
And scarce had pleased me more by disappearing,
For I can now declare a foreshore claim
And do a little salvage profiteering.

Alluding to his natural annoyance,

A PATRIOT POACHER.
BEFoRE the War old Abe was our village outcast. The
Squire glowered on him when they met. When the Vicar
preached on dishonesty everyone said what a pity it was
that Abe was not there to hear the sermon; for he usually
spent his Sunday mornings supervising his snares. The
only person who loved Abe was Grimmond, our policeman.
He proposed to rise by means of Abe to the giddy height
of an inspectorship. Abe was the only person in the
neighbourhood who could be relied upon to give him a case.
Every few months he and the policeman walked off to
the Petty Sessions together. It is true that Abe from the
dock usually denounced Grimmond as a gross perjurer, but
when the Chairman had said that it was quite time this
poaching nuisance was stopped and had commended Con-
stable Grimmond's vigilance and had fined Abe forty
shillings and costs then policeman and prisoner walked
amicably home together. - " -
When Grimmond went off to the War, Abe was quite
lonely. His only friend had vanished. He made a des-
perate attempt to enlist, but the British Army has no use
for a recruit who has lost two fingers from the right hand
through the premature explosion of a shot-gun carried
under the coat. And even the recruiting officer whistled
when Abe described himself as thirty-six, and advised him
to go home and teach his grandchildren to speak the truth.
Life became very dull for Abe. Instead of the wily and
indefatigable Grimmond, Abe merely had to circumvent our
two specials—the Squire, whose rheumatism kept him
indoors on all damp evenings, and the Vicar, who mooned
round his beat meditating on sermons. As Abe said, “It
ain't worth troubling to shove the rabbits under your coat.
He jus' looks at you and says, “Finally, brethren." A
rabbit! I could take a elephant past 'im.”
It was not till the food shortage began that old Abe
revived. Now, instead of sneaking away a few rabbits
in the publican's cart, he walks boldly up to the station
with a couple of dozen. “See here, Mr. Simmonds, I
want these sending off by first train to Middleden. Don't
let 'em miss it now. Those poor folk'll 'ave nothing for
their Sunday dinners if we don't keep up food supplies.”
The village was thrilled at our War Bond meeting when
Abe rose and said, “Put me down for twenty pounds' worth,
if you please, Sir. And I think we ought to remember our
'eroes at the Front, so I'd be glad if you'd let me buy a
War Certificate—one of them that keeps on growing—for
Constable Grimmond.” -
The Squire's wife thanked Abe personally when he came
round just before Christmas and presented two brace of
pheasants to our Red Cross Hospital; and Abe replied,
“Don't mention it, Mum; you're 'eartily welcome; and if
they 'adn't stopped breeding pheasants round 'ere it's not
two brace but twenty brace you should 'ave 'ad.”
Then Abe came to church in a top-hat and frock-coat he
had bought second-hand, and the Vicar, not knowing him,
shook him by the hand and said he was always i. to
welcome new residents in the parish. -
But the climax came one evening when the Squire
addressed our Food Economy meeting and old Abe rose
unsolicited from the back to support him. People hung
on his memorable words: “We got to save food. We got
to increase food supplies. What we want is more 'ares and
rabbits, and what I says is that, if this 'ere Ministry of
Munitions keeps on 'olding up thin wire, we shall lose this
blinkin' War.”
Before it is over I expect that old Abe will be made at
least a Member of the Order of the British Empire in

THE MUD LARKS.
WE fell asleep with goose feathers
of snow whirling against the carriage
windows, and woke to see a shot-silk
sea flinging white lace, along a fairy
coast on one side and pink and yellow
villas nesting among groves of palm
and orange on the other.
“Of course this sort of thing doesn't
happen in real life,” said Albert Edward,

“All the same I wish we could thank

Albert Edward thought he did.
“Used to swot up a lot of Italian
literature when I was a lad; technical
military stuff about the divisions of
Gaul by one J. C.EsaR.”
“Too technical for everyday use,” I
objected. “A person called D'ANNUNzio
is their best seller now, I believe.”
“Somebody'd better hop off the bus
at the next stop and buy a book of
the words,” said the Babe.
At the next halt I dodged the depu-
tation and purchased a phrase-book
with a Union Jack on the cover, en-
titled The English Soldier in Italy,
published in Milan.
Among military terms, grouped under
the heading of “The Worldly War,”
a garetta (sentry-box) is defined as “a
watchbox,” and the machine-gunner
will be surprised to find himself de-
“Then long live liberty.”
Very young subalterns with romantic
notions may waste good beer-money on
foreign phrase-books and get them-
selves enravelled in hopeless inter-
national tangles, but not old Atkins.
The English soldier in Italy will speak
what he has always spoken with com-
plete success in Poperinghe, Amiens,
Cairo, Salonika, Dar-es-Salaam, Bagdad
and Jerusalem, to wit, English.
But to return to our train. At night-
fall we left the fairy coast behind, its
smiling sigmorinas, flags, flowers and
fruit, and swarmed up a pile of perpend-
icular scenery from summer to winter.
During a halt in the midst of moonlit
snows our carriage door was opened
and we beheld outside an Italian officer,
who saluted and gave us an exhibition
of his native tongue at rapid fire.
“He’s referring to us,” said the
Babe. “Answer him, somebody; tell
him we're on his side and all that.”
“Vira l'Italia,” William exclaimed
the luckiest chance, struck a language
which the Italian recognised with a glad
yelp. In a moment explanations were
over and I had swung him into the
carriage and slammed the door.
The new-comer was a lieutenant of
mountain artillery. He was returning
from leave, had confided himself to the
care of an R.T.C., had in consequence
missed every regular train and wanted
a lift to the next junction. That was
all. I then set about to make him as
comfortable as possible, wrapping him
in one of the Babe's blankets and
giving him his maiden drink of whisky
out of William's First Field Dressing.
With tears streaming down his cheeks
he vented his admiration of the British
national beverage.
In return he introduced me to the
Italian national smoke, an endless cigar
to be sucked up through a straw.
Between violent spasms I implored the
name and address of the maker. We
were both very perfect gentlemen.

boasting about the terrific depths of
snow in which he did his battling, while
I boasted about the Flanders mud. We
broke about even on that bout. He
gained a bit on mountain batteries, but
I got it all back, and more, on tanks.
He had never seen one, so I had it all
my own way. Our tanks, after I had
finished with them, could do pretty
nearly anything except knit.
Defeated in the field, he turned home
to Rome for something to boast about.
I should see St. Peter's, he said. It
was magnificent, and the Roman art
treasures unsurpassable.
I replied that our cathedral at West-
minster was far newer, and that the
art in our National Cold joriº had
cost an average of £5,473 19s. 144. per
square foot. Could he beat it 2
That knocked him out of his stride
for a moment, but he struggled back
with some remark about seeing his
Coliseum by moonlight.
I replied that at ours we had modern
electric light, MURPHY and MACR, WESTA

Whether he would have recovered
from that I know not, for at this
moment the lights of the junction
twinkled in at the frosted windows and
he took his departure, first promising
more whisky if in return I would crawl
up his mountain and meet the chamois
and edelweiss.

STAFF-WORK.
“Is this the Officers' Hospital?”
Ronny called out as he came up the
“carriage sweep" (vide House-Agents'
advertisement) by which my temporary
residence is approached.
“No, it's one of the stately homes
of England,” I answered. My bed is
pushed into the window in the daytime,
and from this O.P. (it is on the first
floor) I command the carriage sweep
and a short piece of the main road.
“I arise from dreams of thee,
And a spirit in my feet
Has led me—who knows how 2–
To thy chamber window, sweet"—
sang Ronny. I threw an empty cigar-
ette box at his head and bade him come
up. Ronny's high spirits had to be
excused, for this was the first of his
fourteen days' leave from France.
“Slacker!” he said as he entered my
room. “Why aren't you under military
supervision ?”
“The military authorities have
wearied of me,” I answered, “and now
I enjoy half-pay and comparative free-
dom. Only comparative, for my sister
is a veritable dragon.”
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Ronny.
“Why should you get off scot free while
I bear the heat and burden of the day?”
He came and looked out of the
window, and as he did so the girl with
the yellow jersey passed along the road.
“Who's that 2" asked Ronny.
“I don't know. She passes every
day to do her marketing in the town.
I'm always weaving romances around
her. Sometimes I imagine her a Cin-
derella ill-used by her ugly sisters—”
“She didn't look very ill-used,” put
in Ronny.
“—or else the pampered niece of a
fabulously rich uncle. Or, in my less
cheerful moments, when my leg's very
troublesome, I imagine her the wife of
some fat ſellow with a cushy job at the
base.”
“What a horrible idea!" said Ronny.
“But I think you ought to get to
know her. I've read in some rotten
then hastily affixed his sheet of paper to
the gatepost and hid behind the laurels.
The next minute the girl in the yellow
jersey appeared, stood a moment read-
ing Ronny's notice, and passcd on.
Then he emerged from his hiding-place,
took down the notice and returned to
the house.
He came into my room surveying his
sheet of paper with every appearance
of satisfaction.
“Very good staff-work,” he said.
“If all doesn't go according to plan it
won't be my fault.” Then he dis-
played the following to my horrified
gaze — -
“OFFICERS' HOSPITAL.
GIFTS OF Fix UIT AND FLOWERS GIRATEFULLY
RECEIVED.”
“Ronny,” I said severely, “this is
beyond a joke. This is obtaining goods
under false pretences.”
“We haven't obtained them yet,” said
Ronny. “But I hope very much that
we shall.”
“Well, I hope very much that we
shan't.” -
“I rather fancy you must have lost
your nerve a bit,” he said, regarding me
with a speculative eye. “And of course
you haven't been able to observe the
girl in the yellow jersey so closely as I
have. When I told you that I thought
she was a vivid personality I was, if
anything, understating the case. You
should see her eyes. By Jove, they're

himself in the looking-glass. “I wonder
if I'd better put my new tie on,” he
said, smoothing his hair.
“Luckily it's a thousand to one
against her bringing fruit and flowers,
which I suppose is your idea,” I said.
“And if she does I shan't let you butt
in.”
“My dear old thing,” said Ronny,
“I have one sole advantage over you
at the present time. You are warm
and dry and well-fed, and you are re-
garded by everyone who doesn't know
you as a No. 1 size hero. But I have

That's why I came down to see you;
and I'm almost certain that the girl in
the yellow jersey is a vivid personality
too. I shall have to devise a scheme
for introducing her to you.”
“For Heaven's sake don't,” I cried,
knowing Ronny's schemes of old. But
he remained sunk in deep and, to me,
ominous thought.
“I have it,” he said at length and
left the room, and a little later I saw
him in the carriage sweep with a large
sheet of paper in his hand. He stood
take, while you must wait here in the
office for me to report.”
“Well, she won't come, any way,” I
said. “If she does anything she'll
send her gifts by an underling.”
“I see you don't understand good
staff-work at all,” said Ronny. “We’ve
provided for that. I should take the
parcel back myself. You will see that
within twenty-four hours the objective
will be attained.” -
“And the objective is to introduce
me to the lady in the yellow jersey?"
“Well, I've known the Staff to err
on the side of optimism before,” I said.
The morning and a good part of the
‘aſternoon passed without anything to
report in our part of the line. Then
my sister, who had been lunching out,

“You will be interested to hear I
have met the girl with the yellow
jersey,” she said. '
“You haven't l” cried Ronny and I
together. Then, “Bringing fruit and
flowers?” asked Ronny.
“No,” said my sister. “Why should
she 2. But she did make rather an
extraordinary remark. She said she
had meant to call on us to-day, having
heard we were respectable—that was
before Ronny arrived, of course—but
that she had seen a notice on our gate
that this was an officers' hospital, so
thought she must have made a mistake
in the address.”
There was silence for a space, and
then I murmured, “Very good staff-
work,” to no one in particular. But
Ronny was already at the door.
“Where are you going?” we asked.
“To explain about the notice, of
course. Where does she live 2 ''
“Oh, this was one of your stunts,

occasionally into the vernacular. “I
shan't tell you where she lives.”
Ronny put on his most engaging

“You’re not going to be so inhos-
pitable as that 2" he said.
“I am. But it doesn't matter,” she
added after a pause, “for she's coming

At that moment a light step sounded
on the gravel below.

THE NEW DIPLOMACY.
“OLIM,” writing in all the dignity of
big print in a recent issue of The
Times, pleads for the abolition of all
Embassies, on the ground that “an
Ambassador is a pompous and expen-
sive form of envoy" and “a survival
of the dead past.” But is not “OLIM "
knocking at an open door? A good
many of our Embassies have been
ended by the War, and the new
arrangement by which our Ambassador
at Washington has been replaced by
a High Commissioner with unpre-
cedented powers who still retains the
post of Lord Chief Justice of England,
undoubtedly points to a reorganisation
of the Diplomatic service on the lines
suggested by “OLIM.” Indeed the
mission of Lord READING is, we under-
stand, only the first of a number
of similar appointments, dictated, in
“OLIM's" own phrase, both by con-
venience and economy.
Thus we understand that Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL will shortly pro-
ceed as Grand Plenipotentiary and
British Government to the seat of
the Government of the Ukraine, with
the view of establishing friendly re-
lations with the anti-Bolshevist ele-
ments. Mr. CHURCHILL's distinguished
record as a cavalry officer renders him
peculiarly qualified for negotiating with
the Cossacks. And in the interests
of convenience and economy he has
generously offered to retain his post as
Minister of Munitions.
Another appointment which is prac-
tically settled and will doubtless win
the approval of the entire British
Empire is that of Lord RotherMERE
to the Governorship of New Guinea.
Here again the dictates of convenience
and economy will be most happily
consulted, for, having a most efficient
astral body at his command, Lord
RotherMERE will continue as Air
Minister to provide for the urgent
aerial needs of the Navy and Army,
and devote all the resources of his
subliminal consciousness to the solv-
ing of the problems involved.
We have also good authority for
and the War Cabinet, will shortly pro-
ceed on a great propagandist and
publicity campaign to Tibet. The
exact designation of his new office
has not yet been decided upon, but it
will probably be “Supreme and Un-

Britain in the Far East.” A special
feature of his mission will be the
founding, staffing and organising of a
number of newspapers, a sphere of
activity in which the Tibetans have
hitherto been deplorably backward.

I FAINT, I languish. Set me on an isle
Where only nut-shells pop beneath the palm,
And turtle unto turtle all the while
Says, “Where did that one go to?”—yet is calm
(Knowing which tree it was the young ape shinned

And storms are not nor strafes, nor any wind up.

Where the ripe cane drips juices all day long,

I do detest this shortage of molasses.
And there the maple shall be also found
No whit less nectar'd than the Orient sweet -
And just as nutritive, and all around
The woods be carpeted with bashful beet,
And vast refineries and mills be handy

And bind the barley-sugar's golden braid,
And sticky both my hands and both my cheeks
And sport with Demerara in the shade, -
And cut great cubes like glittering alabaster,
And quite forget at last the fume, the fuss
Of this unsweetened twilight where we groan,

Or “You shall have one lump and one alone,”
Or “Herbert is a dear boy, greatly gifted,
But oh, so careless with the moist and sifted.”

That honeyed atmosphere in dreams at least,
And tread those spicy avenues and wreathe
My head with caramels and make a feast;

When I put fourteen cubes into my teacup.
And pale but happier let me hear the call
Of duty after dalliance and awake

[JANUARY 30, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, January 21st.—In the pre-
sent state of our relations with Russia
it is fortunate that we have a Foreign
Minister who is especially acute in draw-
ing nice distinctions. When Mr. KING,
rushing in where even an archangel
might fear to tread, inquired whether
Russia was still an Allied State for the
purposes of the War, Mr. BALFour re-
plied, “As far as treaties can make her
so, she is.” Even Mr. TRotzky could
hardly take exception to that admirably
diplomatic sentence.
St. James's Square, once a sylvan
retreat for cats and clubmen, is now a
wilderness of bricks and mortar. In
reply to Sir ARTHUR FELL, the FIRST
COMMISSIONER OF Works disclaimed all
responsibility for the transformation,
which is the work of the American
Y.M.C.A. The blame, if any, attaches
to the nouveau monde and not to our
own Sir ALFRED.
Several Members intended to oppose,
for all they were worth—not a large
amount in some cases—the passage of
the Military Service Bill. Their prin-
cipal objection was that it gave too
much power to the Director of National
Service. But Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs
has not forgotten the use of a good
bedside manner, and by promising his
patients to show them the prescription
—that is, to lay his regulations on the
Table of the House—he induced them
to swallow what they seemed to regard
as a disagreeable dose.
Tuesday, January 22nd.—In a care-
fully-balanced speech Lord CURzoN
admitted a platonic affection for Pro-
portional Representation. It was
“complicated ” but not “unintelli-
gible"—as if anything could be unin-
telligible to that massive brain —
“difficult” but not “impracticable.”
He would like to see the experiment
tried, but nevertheless advised their
Lordships to vote against it. Lord
CREwB said “ditto to Mr. BURRE,” but
the Peers preferred the arguments of
Lord CHAPLIN and Lord CourTNEY (for
whom “P. R.” has furnished, probably
for the first time in their political lives,
a common enthusiasm), and carried
the proposal by a majority of ninety.
Thus for the second time in a fort-
night, Lord CURzoN found himself in
the unenviable position of Bo-Peep.
By way of answer, I presume, to the
charge that the politicians interfere too
much with the conduct of the War, the
Government have decided that the
soldiers shall have a chance of taking
their part in politics. Accordingly to
any soldier, commissioned or not, who
is adopted as a Parliamentary candidate,
is anticipated that this new method of
“wangling” a few days' leave will be
very popular in the trenches.
Another injustice to Ireland has been
discovered by Mr. FIELD. Ordnance-
workers under the Agricultural Depart-
ment in his peaceful country are, it

seems, paid only twenty-nine shillings
a week, while similar workers at Wool-
wich are paid forty-seven shillings. It
was delicately explained to him that
the Ordnance Survey to which the
Irishmen belonged was concerned with
the manufacture of maps, while the
special business of Woolwich was to
construct the means of altering them.
The CHANCELLOR or THE ExchEQUER
had “nothing to add " to his previous
answer about the increase in race-
meetings; but, lest he should be ac-
cused of encouraging gambling, assured
the House immediately afterwards that
the Government had no intention of
issuing Premium Bonds.
Mr. TREVELYAN complained that
among the pamphlets seized in a
recent raid was one containing a
message to the British Labour Con-
ference from the Bolshevist “Ambassa-
dor" in London, and demanded that
the pamphlets should be at once
returned, “in order that the Russian
representative might be allowed to
address the British working-class in
what words he pleased.” As his words
seem to have included “gross mis-
representations of the attitude of the
British Government to the Russian
people” the HoME SECRETARY declined
the request, and added that he was
considering the question of prosecu-
tion.
The House loudly cheered the
discovery that there are limits to the
privileges of those who “lie abroad for
the good of their country.”
|Wednesday, January 23rd.—In the
absence of Sir LEO CHIOzzA MoREY
the SECRETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY re-
ceived the full force of Mr. Houston's
daily cascade of Shipping Questions.
An attempt to divert it, by the request
that histormentor should put his views
in writing, was met by the reply that
he had already done so to the extent
of ten pages of manuscript; and Dr.
MACNAMARA, fearing trouble with the
Paper Commission, did not press the
suggestion. But I noticed that he
seemed quite interested a little later
on, when Mr. MACPHERSON, in the
course of an answer on Army dentistry,
spoke of the care now taken “in the
treatment of jaw-cases.”
On the motion for the adjournment
a number of Members went head-hunt-
ing. This classical sport, as practised
by the Dyaks in Borneo, involved the
discharge of poisoned darts through a
blow-pipe, and the House of Commons
has not materially altered the method.
As the attack was led by Major DAVID
DAVIES, formerly Private Secretary to
the PRIME MINISTER, it is supposed
that the Head of the Government was
the object aimed at ; but most of the
shots went wide and hit the Head of
our Army in France. Mr. MACPHER-
soN's defence would have been more
effective if he had not been careful to
explain that he was “not speaking for
the War Cabinet.” The head-hunters
included Mr. KENNEDY Jones, who
(teste Mr. RochE) “moves in the best
political circles,” and Mr. KING, who


special furlough is to be granted. It
only argues in them. -
LORD CURZON.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Thursday, January 24th.-Echoes of
last night's debate were still rumbling
through the House this atº
Mr. BonAR LAw, on the invitation of
Sir HEdworth MEUx, strongly depre-
cated Press attacks upon distinguished
sailors and soldiers, but when further
invited to put the CENsor into motion
described the suggestion as “easier to
make than to carry out.”
Mr. Houston's latest complaint
against the shipping authorities is that
a cargo of “premier jus” has been
held up in Argentina. Members who
had jumped to the conclusion that the
commodity was a species of “ginger"
specially intended for the stimulation
of Prime Ministers, were disappointed
to learn that it was only “refined ani-
mal fat.”
A notable addition to the many ex-
cellent maiden speeches delivered this
Session was made by Lieut.-General
Sir A. HUNTER-WESTON. “Forcible,
eloquent, and vivid,” as Mr. HERBERT
SAMUEL rightly described it, this fresh
breeze from the WESTON front blew
away all the remaining opposition to
the Military Service Bill.
THE “SPOKE.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-An article re-
cently appeared in your pages, entitled
“The New Industry” and dealing with
the manufacture of spills, which must,
I think, have deeply shocked all careful
students of this subject. It cannot
have been the writer's intention to
mislead, yet it is strange that he should
not be aware that the spill, in which
he takes so childlike a delight, is
already obsolete and went out, in the
best circles, some time before queues
came in. It has been finally super-
seded by the very device to which he
so contemptuously refers as an “ineffi-
cacious tube,” namely the spoke.
I freely admit that a spoke made out
of a whole Morning Post is impossible
and indeed ridiculous. It must be
made of a single whole sheet of news-
paper, and should be light and firm,
crisp and hollow, and some four feet in
length.
It can hardly be necessary at this
time of day to give any detailed account
of the properties of the spoke, but I
may perhaps point out its leading
features—namely, that it lies in the
fender and lasts for a week.
Would you picture it in action ? I
take it up absent-mindedly as my pipe
goes out, and without rising from my
armchair, without taking my eyes off
my book, I prod gently in the grate,
pluck up a little head of flame, bring it
with a turn of the wrist in contact

My dear wife, who is the most ingeni-

she is confident, if her researches can
be sufficiently prolonged, of finding
substitutes for substitutes for substi-

I warn the Government none the less
that we can be tried too far.
Mr. MELDownNE INMAN (the Billiard

Realising the seriousness of the situ-
ation I have reluctantly given up eggs.
It may not generally be known that a
most excellent substitute for an egg is
an old billiard-ball soaked in vinegar
for a day or so to soften it. I often
make a dinner off two of these.
A Society War-Worker writes:—
It distresses me so to think of poor
me to come out in the open, at, say, an
Aldwych Club lunch, just to assure
people that there should be no need
for queues at all, and so forth, but

possibly our friends the YAPPs. For

pose briefly to relate the last of these
—his effort to secure a foothold in
journalism. There was no reason why
he shouldn't have succeeded, as he
had a trick with the pen and a nice
taste, beyond the fact that he was the

of a mad tea-party, and he would
always sacrifice the main chance to his

editor of The Appreciator. A month
later he came to report progress and
greeted me with effusion.
“Uncle Dick,” he said, “you are a
real benefactor.”
“Well,” I replied, “I suppose this
means that you are now prosperously
launched on the sea of literary journ-
alism 2"
“That's a rather large deduction,”
said the Hatter; “but, anyhow, I've
written a review for The Appreciator.
It hasn't appeared, and I don't think it
will. But no matter; ‘more was lost
on Mohacz field.' I've had a great
time with old Crawley Bland. I took
your letter of introduction. I was
shown up into his sanctum, and he
“minowdhered and minandhered and
blandandhered,’ as Mulvaney would
have said, for the space of a quarter of
an hour on the privileges and duties of
criticism. Finally he handed me a
book for review, with instructions that
as far as possible I should give due
prominence to the personal note, and
I bowed myself out in a super-fatted
condition.”
“And then you went home and
butchered the book?” -
“Oh, no, Uncle Dick. I didn't cut it
bottle of brandy with the proceeds, like
Bludyer. I faithfully carried out my
instructions, and did so all the more
easily because it happened that I had
been at school and Oxford with the
author. So I began by observing that
knowledge of an author's antecedents
and environment was always helpful
in appraising his work, and described
how Mr. Blank, owing to the sudden
failure and imprisonment of his father
as a defaulting solicitor, had been
obliged to cut short his academic
career and take to journalism under an
assumed name.”
“You put that in the review 2"
“Yes. You see it was greatly to
his credit. Besides he never liked his
father.”
“Any other personal notes ?”
“Not much. I said that, although
he suffered from epileptic fits, he was
the best bridge-player of his time at
Oxford and a master of the art of
ornamental objurgation—rather a good
phrase that, I thought. And then at
the end, after saying the book was
marked by ‘vitality’ and ‘artistry,'.. I
expressed surprise that, having pub-
lished his first novel with Broadwood,
he had issued this through the house of
just for people to read between the
lines, for you know the sort of bilge
that Pougher habitually prints.”
“So the Editor turned you down?”
“Yes, I meant him to, after the way
he had turned me up at our interview.
But he wrote me a priceless letter, re-
gretting that in the exuberance of youth
I had so crudely misinterpreted his
instructions.”
“Hatter, you are incorrigible. What
would you have done if Crawley Bland
had printed your review 2"
“‘Imagination's widest stretch in
wonder dies away.' But I knew my
man. Journalistic soap-boilers don't
run those risks.”
“So literary journalism is “off” now, I
suppose. And what's the next move?”
“I don't quite know. I'm thinking
of becoming a professional singer—
oratorio, Albert Hall, you know.”
But he didn't. Six weeks later the
Hatter deserted the Muses for Mars
and has remained methodically sane
ever since.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWO LITTLE ADVENTURES.
ON Friday last it became my duty to convoy to Buxford
a lad aged ten years and a-half who acknowledges me as
his father and is convinced that my proper task in life,
during his holidays, is to minister to his amusements and
to afford him my companionship. Ordinarily he is of a
lighthearted, not to say rollicking, disposition; but on this
occasion he was going back to school, and his high spirits
were slightly dashed by the knowledge. I do not say he
was gloomy, for that would be untrue, but he was conscious
every now and then of life's seriousness when it has to be
lived under the eyes of masters, and there came into his
face, like a cloud sweeping over a sunny landscape, a tinge
of regret for the less severely regulated joys of houne. I do
not blame him ; I like to see a boy put a bold face on his
return to school, but it is pleasant also to know that he
appreciates his home. - -
Well, we jogged along in our cross-country train, and at
last, after many stoppages, we arrived at Buxford as the
shades of evening were closing in. Our school was two
miles distant, but in the station-yard there were no taxis
or vehicles of any kind. A porter who was consulted
proved to be a pessimist. “Sometimes,” he said, “you
could get a conveyance, sometimes you couldn't ;” and this
apparently was some time when you couldn't. Was it any
use waiting? “Well, you never could tell whether a fly
mightn't turn up.”
As he uttered these philosophical reflections I became
aware of a movement, and up the hill there came slowly out
of the heart of the shadows a-no, it couldn't be—yes,
indeed it was—a HANSOM How had it come here, this
shabby disused gondola of the ancient streets of London 2
Old memories came flooding back at its aspect. I hailed
it and became its temporary possessor, and the boy and I
tucked ourselves into it as best we could.
It is not too much to say that our drive was a lurid
one. The driver began by handling a lever and closing
the doors on my fingers. All the old fears and all the old
inconveniences were there. The horse, poor beast, was the
slowest and the laziest in the world. It never fell down,
but was always on the verge of falling, and constantly in
imagination I saw myself and the boy describing parabolas
in the air and landing on our heads in the middle of the
slushy road.
Besides, the driver owned and used a whip the lash
of which often missed the flanks of the horse and showed |
a tendency to entangle itself in our eyes. This led to an
interchange of amenities with the driver, and what between
anger, terror and strong words he and I were fairly ex-
hausted when at last we arrived at our destination. The
boy alone was calm, and I afterwards strove to impress | -
upon him the memory of the historic occasion when he
drove in a ghostly hansom with a demon driver to his school.
For myself I marvel how men endured this terrifying sort
of carriage for so long. This was my first small adventure.
My second had taken place before the first began, but I
place it second because it was slighter and not so full of
violent emotions. During part of our journey we had as a
fellow-traveller a very young officer, over whose feet I
tripped as I entered the carriage and with whom I ex-
changed reciprocal apologies. He appeared to think that
this incident had given me some claim upon his courtesy,
for when next he produced his cigarette-case he offered me,
with a most winning smile and with extreme politeness, a
cigarette. Here, I thought to myself, is a youngster who
has no use for the alleged surliness of the travelling
Englishman. He is probably on leave from the Front and
is determined to make everybody else as happy as he can,
and with this view he gives me a cigarette.
I watched him with a sympathetic interest. As our
journey proceeded he became restless, and at last, when we
stopped at Fiddington, he sprang up, seized his belongings
and flew rather than stepped out of the carriage on to the
platform. There he gave a shout, a loud and joyful “Ah!”
and, rushing forward, was gathered into the arms of a lady
whom I guessed to be his mother. I had only a glimpse,
for the train quickly moved on and the light was beginning
to fade, but that glimpse kept me happy until we came to
Buxford. If this should happen to catch the eye of a young
and good-looking officer who on Friday week travelled to
Fiddington I should like him to realise how much pleasure
he gave to a fellow-traveller by his giſt of a cigarette and
by his joyous greeting of a gentle lady. R. C. L.
THE HELLES HOTEL.
WHEN I consider how my life is spent
In this dark world of sugar-cards and queues,
Where none but babes get proper nourishment
And meanly men remunerate the Muse,
I dream of holidays when Peace is sent,
But not such dreams as common persons use—
I know a headland at the Dardanelles
Where I shall build the best of all hotels.
I know a cliff-top where the wealthy guest
From languid balconies shall each day view
Far over Samothrace the tired sun rest
And melt, a marvel, into Europe's blue,
To come back blushing out of Asia's breast
And hang, at noon, divided 'twixt the two,
While shuttered casements looking out to Troy
Shall faintly stimulate the Fifth-Form boy.
There shall they have, with those delicious skies,
All that rich ease for which the Armies prayed,
Nor dust nor drought nor shortage of supplies, .
But long cool glasses in the cypress' shade,
And starlight suppers, and, of course, no flies,
And in their bathing-place no mules decayed;
Shall swim in the AEgean, if they want, .
Or go and do it in the Hellespont.
There shall they hear from olives overhead
The cricket call to them and no shells sing,
While painted lizards flash before their tread
And in green gullies trills the sudden Spring;
Shall walk, unblinded by disease and dread,
Where myrtle beckons and rock-roses cling,
And find it difficult to tell their aunts
The proper names of all these ſunny plants.
There shall they see across the storied Sound
Some snow-peak glisten like a muffled star,
And murmur, “That's Olympus, I'll be bound,”
And tread old battle-fields where vineyards are;
With scarred young veterans they'll amble round
.. The Turks' entanglements at Sedd-el-Bahr,
And practise at a reasonable charge
Heroic landings in the hotel barge.
But there are dates when tourists shall be banned,
High dates of April and of early June,
When only they that bear the Helles brand,
A few tired Captains and the Tenth Platoon,
Shall see strange shadows in that flowery land
And ghostly cruisers underneath the moon:
And only they shall scale the sunny hills,
is going to see his home. Being therefore very happy he
And they alone shall have no heavy bills. A. P. H.

“So 'UD YOU BE IF YOU SAW. A BLINKIN’ CIVILIAN FANNING YoUI. BEST GIRL WITH HIS BEASTLY EXEMPTION CARD."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Though I have found The Stucco House (UNwiN) a singu-
larly depressing work, this is less my ground of complaint
than a suspicion that the gloom is there for its own sweet
sake, and without the excuse of any more artistic purpose.
The house was that in which Jamie and Catherine con-
tinued the troubled existence which you may recall from a
previous book, and brought up, very badly, an increasing
family. Detestable, every one of them (the picture on the
wrapper does them no more than justice, and I can't say
anything worse than that), so that I found myself pain-
fully indifferent to the long-drawn shipwreck, mutual
loathing, drink, lunacy and every kind of disaster that
finally overwhelms the group. But what I should like to
ask of Mr. GILBERT CANNAN is (so to speak) some statement
of his war-aims. What is he out for 2 Is the tale an
indictment of conventional morality, of ºtºl stucco-
plastering, of the commercial idea or what? Surely in
any case Jamie himself, who cared for none of these things,
might have been presented as a rather more endurable
character. The fact seems to be that Mr. CANNAN's people
lack humanity; they impress me as figures of tin cleverly
painted to look like men and women, but empty, so that
their fall produces clatter but no sense of tragedy. The
pity of this is the greater because Mr. CANNAN as artist has
just that quickening sense of beauty which should save
him from his present fault of cold cleverness. He can give
you the essentials of a scene or a situation unforgettably,
whether it be like the home-coming of Jamie in the begin-
ning of the book, with its wonderful sketch of Mersey-side
landscape, or a sordid grotesque such as the cheese-cake
should compare him to TCHEKov, but he misses the Rus-
sian's sympathy and affection for his characters. It is
perhaps the absence of this that makes Mr. CANNAN's
catastrophes so hollow-sounding.
My reading of Dust (DUCKworTH) has produced in me
the sensation of an unexpected encounter with the antique.
Perhaps because I had supposed that these careful records
of Lancastrian or Yorkist domesticity had had their day.
Far from it, however; here is Mr. John L. CARTER detailing
for us the home life of Leeds, the intolerant manufacturer-
parent, the uncomprehending mother, the revolting (in
both senses) daughter—in fact the whole dreary ménage,
as though we were back in 1890 and the Repertory Drama
yet slept within the womb of Time. I hardly think I need
give you any precise report of it all. You know by now
how the son's evening hours and courtships will be resented
by the stern parent, how the business will decline, the
daughter marry the curate, and all the trivial uninteresting
round of it. True, when Mr. CARTER allowed us to observe
his paterfamilias embracing the girl from the confectioner's,
I anticipated some ray of novelty; but all that came of this
was (inconsequentially) a resolve on the part of Mr. and
Mrs. Curate that theirs should be a union in name alone,
which of course plunged us straight into a convention even
older than the Manchester School. The fact is, I am
afraid that these Northern parlours are no longer the happy
hunting-ground for realistic fiction that they once were;
nor perhaps is Mr. CARTER equipped with the manner that
would enable him to tell an arid tale refreshingly. Dust,
in short, is a title all too fatally apt.
New and Old (CoNSTABLE) is a volume of hitherto un-





episode that marks his domestic downfall. For this I

SICHEL led a double life as a laborious scholar and versatile
critic and as a friend of the poor and unfortunate, a
friendship not bounded by gifts and easy patronage, but
expressed in austere, constant, self-denying work and
sympathetic companionship with her protégés. It was a
beautiful life, sustained by a deep religious faith, lighted
with a fine intelligence and enriched by varied interests
and staunch loyalties. Of the letters—and she belonged
to a generation that used the pen, not the typewriter, so
that they have a gracious leisurely air—I enjoyed especi-

ing with it, that I most cordially commend. Some of us who
have talked glibly about the delight of caravans and the
open road will, after reading Miss CROSBIE's book, recognise
sadly that this is not our natural sphere.
In the early pages of The Tempting Thought (MILLS AND
Boon) Mr. (or Miss) HYLTON CLEAVER tells us how Betty, the
accomplished and industrious junior typist to an engineering
firm in the City, is oppressed by her superior, the wicked
Miss Barkshaw, and is rescued by John, the junior partner,
who shortly afterwards marries her and drops out of the
book. John is a veritable preur chevalier. Bill and Peter
are also of this kind, only more so. Bill secures little
Margaret Cannon as his own without much difficulty; but
Peter, a confirmed romantic, gets started on the wrong
path and does not find it easy going. He has once seen an
attractive girl-child in a black bus outside a public-house,
and he hunts for her all the world over. Eventually he
finds her (but he doesn't really find her, you know) at a

heiress, believes herself disgusted with the world of flunkey-
dom, and buys a small island somewhere off the S.W. coast
of England, on which she means to forget all about tiresome
lovers and live the simple life. On her way to the island
she meets a trio of strolling vagabonds, and promptly takes
them with her. All three are types, and in their special
line perfectly delightful. Justina, a middle-aged lady who
has left her rich husband because she longs for freer scope,
is nominally in charge of this troupe, but as at critical
moments she is always talking hot air or painting cloud
effects there is no depending upon her. Her adopted
daughter, Jill, is really the mainstay of the party, the only
one who has the true spirit of vagabondage in her, the
untamed creature loathing bridle and bit. Henry, Justina's
son (also adopted, and no one was ever more adopt-
able than he), struggled hard with a poem of gigantic
dimensions, and tried for all he was worth to be unconven-
tional. But he had a suburban mind, and when attacked
by measles was practically dome for as a vagabond. Of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WILLIAM II. ON DEMOCRACY.
Not for myself; I little care
For loud Imperial pomp and show;
None of the uniforms I wear
Affords me satisfaction, no;
My throne and crown, my high degree,
My busts that figure many a column
On,
All are but vanity to me
Just as they would have been to
SolomoN.
From time to time I long to slough
The regal state that wraps me round,
To be reborn of common stuff
And move, like mortals,
ground ;
To seek, beyond the sacred pale,
Those joys that never gods like me
know,
And lead in some sequestered vale
The simple life as led by TINo.
on the
But oh, my people ! 'Tis for them,
For their dear sake, I may not shed
This tedious orb and diadem,
Leaving my sheep unshepherded;
How would they miss, with me away,
The fold that now my flock I pen in,
And wander off, an easy prey
To Socialistic wolves like LENIN |
Being a simple German breed,
They're not at present ripe for that ;
A guiding hand is what they need
Before they play the democrat;
As I observed to TRotsky's crew,
I'm all for “self-determination,”
But any step with this in view
Must first secure my approbation.
So here I am and here remain,
And, should they bleat for better food,
I must, though mine the harder pain,
Adopt a blood-and-iron mood;
Their rebel ranks with guns I'll sweep
And into mutton have them pep-
pered,
Which is the just reward of sheep
That strike against their loving shep-
herd. O. S.
“A shoal of herrings unexpectedly made
their appearance off Deal.”—The Times.
In future Lord RHONDDA would be glad
to have notice.

THE PASSING OF POLYDORE.
WE had been pulled out of the battle
—right out of the mud into the snow-
drifts, into a rural area where the tiles
were on the roof and the pigs at peace
in the pleasaunce. We could hardly
believe it. The two junior subalterns,
who joined us last Autumn, spent hours
in speculation before they realised what
gave the landscape its unnatural look—
the absence of crump-holes, shell-cases
and army clothing awaiting salvage.
The dear lads had forgotten that there
existed fields of this unscarred and un-
littered variety. For we belonged to
an Army Field Artillery Brigade, who
require neither rest, rations, re-drilling
nor recreation like common gunners.
The youngsters thought that peace
must have been declared since there
were no longer shell-splinters in their
morning tea.
Obviously the occasion clamoured for
celebration. At first we thought this
might take the form of an illuminated
address to G.H.Q., in a casket specially
made by the Battery fitter, but various
considerations decided us instead to
have something special to eat. Plainly
a pig must die. Pigs in this blessed area
were prosperous and prolific. Family
parties of them foraged grunting before
every threshold; the straw of innumer-
able stables rustled to their obesity.
But there are pigs and Pigs. The
Mess Secretary, whose naturally aesthe-
tic taste had been perverted by months
of thankless eatering, had his eye on
the very Pig we wanted—an adolescent
hog in whom he saw, as the sculptor
fellow saw the angel in the block of
marble, innumerable savoury meals.
The family who were the guardians of
this noble creature we interviewed en
masse. It consisted of husband and
wife and three be-pattened daughters,
all bi-lingual and expert pig-dealers.
Thus they had us at a disadvantage, for
while we stated our terms in French
they discussed them in Flemish, re-
turning to the language of diplomacy
only when their conference resulted in
a decision. -
We were still in a semi-stupefied con-
dition from the surprise of being brought
out of action, and finally agreed to pay
a price satisfactory to them.
So the Pig, who will live in my
memory under the name of Polydore,
had to be weighed. Having neglected
to train him to sit patiently on the
scales, his guardians had to coax him,
still unconscious of his destiny and
grunting amicably, into a sort of crate,
the weight of which had been scrupul-
ously balanced by an equal weight of
bricks; but we didn't insist on his being
was an even hundred kilos. A day
earlier or a day later and his price would
have involved calculation and decimals.
. It was rather sad to see how many
volunteers there were to perform the
dreadful deed of his execution amongst
the very gunners whose billet Polydore
had so often shown his willingness to
share. They must have employed some
summary method far deadlier than the
ordinary civilian massacre; we heard
no cry, no soprano protest, no reproach-
ful swan-song. The spectacle of his
corpse was spared to us. One morning
we saw him as Polydore—plump, rosy
beneath his camouflage, bristling with
vitality; that afternoon we inspected
him as mere pale impersonal joints.
These were for the men. Our choice
was his head, for we remembered appe-
tising pictures of refectory-tables lined
with round-paunched fathers smiling
with one accord to see the ceremonial
entry of the Boar's Head.
I will place it on record here that
Polydore was a great success with the
troops; he may be said to have gone
down with them. Let that be his epi-
taph. But his head' First of all the
estaminet-stove proved too small to
contain it entire, and it had to be cleft
vertically. This of course marred Poly-
dore's jovial expression and made cere-
mony impossible. Then the senior sub
altern suddenly swore off pork for life,
having realised, in one of those strange
flashes of insight that come to thinking
men, that crackling was neither more
nor less than the material for saddlery
misemployed. And finally our discou-
ragement was completed by the carver's
exclamations of astonishment and even
horror when the moment came for him
to set about his business.
Whether all the pigs of France are
similar I know not, any more than I can
say whether our Mess-cook had treated
Polydore's head in some abnormal
fashion, but as it was presented to us
upon our plates none but an Eskimo
could have contemplated it without
quaking. All the most succulent and
adipose-forming constituents of Poly-
dore's diet seemed to have gone to his
head. We do not happen to number
any avowed Eskimos in the Battery,
and so we abandoned the dreadful re-
mains of our feast to the limber gun-
ners, who were at the time short of
lubricant for their axles. Next day the
axles of every gun-carriage but one were
lavishly over-greased, while the limber
gunner responsible for the exception
figured, dreadfully bilious, on sick
parade. Never again shall I see the
familiar fatuous full-faced smile of the
porker without a shudder and a dis-
quieting internal emotion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LITTLE BIT OFF THE TOP.
“WHEN is a semi-silvan retreat not
even that?”
There are doubtless several answers
to this poignant conundrum, but the
one which concerns me the most is,
“When a private munition factory sits
down within a bomb's throw of it.”
If the space between my hedge and
the factory wall were not piled up with
the mortal remains of disembowelled
motor bicycles, superannuated hip-
baths and other gew-gaws of civilised
life it would be more bearable.
Narrow as this space is, it was wide
enough for a bomb (unnoticed by the
Press) to drop into during the last
air-raid. The resulting distribution of
favours and a wish for a little relaxa-
tion caused me to write to the Managing
Director of the works TT
(Drainford Munitions,
Ltd.).
DEAR SIR (I wrote),
—Doubtless you are
aware of the attack on
the Drainford front
last night. That your
Company's delightful
| edifice was unoccu-
pied and that my
household had fore-
gathered in the wine
cellar at the time are
matters for congratu-
lation to all concerned.
My particular ob-
ject in writing is to
ask if your Company
can give me any in-
formation as to the
whereabouts of one of

James seemed to be entering into
the spirit of the thing, so I thought I
would carry on a bit more, and sent
across the following reply at once:–

with which you and I used to decorate
our heads in happier days) which has
mysteriously disappeared since (and, I
believe, owing to) the explosion of a
bomb belonging to your Company; but
chiefly as to the present habitat of a
patent cowl, its complement and con-
stant companion for many years, which
seems to have accompanied the chim-
ney-pot in its flight.
Eagerly awaiting your favourable
reply, -
I am, Yours faithfully,
AUGUSTUs WINTER.
P.S.—Thanks for the half bicycle,
the bucket of perforated design, and the
two cans deposited on my lawn, which
however I do not require. Perhaps
you will send for them.
This drew a formal reply in the fol-
lowing terms:—
DEAR SIR,--I am in receipt of yours
which was undoubtedly their (your
Company's) property?
This is how I look at it. The Huns
were clearly aiming at your Company's
esteemed works (and it wasn't a bad
shot either), therefore the bomb was
intended for your Company, ergo the
bomb was ipso facto presented to and
belongs to your Company as aforesaid.
From these premises (not my house,
you understand; I'm using the word
in its legal bearing) it follows that, if
any part, piece or portion thereof alien-
ates the affections of any of my pro-
perty or causes it to leave my demesne,
thus depriving me of its use, functions,
and, if I may use the term in this con-
nection, usufruct (and the cowl was a
particularly fruity design of my own,
carried out by Simpson Brothers, of
the London Road), then and in that
case I hold that your Company is
morally bound to inform me as to
where your bomb has taken my pro-
matter and make a clean breast of it,
I remain, Yours hopefully,
AUGUSTU's WINTER.
James, as I happen to know, is prac-
tically the sole proprietor of Drainford
Munitions, Limited, and also an iron-
|monger in what is known as a large
way of business in Market Street,
| Drainford. He is quite a decent chap,
but as keen as mustard to do business.
| Next evening I received from him the
following letter (with enclosure):—
DEAR MR. WINTER,--I am writing to
you in a friendly way to ask why you
persist in writing such absurd letters
to my Company. The Government are
holding themselves liable for air-raid
| damage up to five hundred pounds, and
I should suggest your
writing to them on
the subject.
In the meantime I
am sending you our
current catalogue, and
trust that, should you
- obtain pecuniary sat-
ºf isfaction from the
- Government, you will
favour me with your
esteemed commands.
Mrs. Baldwin joins
me in kind regards and
best respects.
Yours sincerely,
JAMEs J. BALDWIN.
I found this answer
most disappointing,
and I sent a reply to
it by hand, addressed
to James at the shop
in Market Street:—
DEAR MR. BALDw1N,-Thank you for
your letter and interesting catalogue;
but surely these are spring and summer
cowlings, and I want one that will do
for hard winter wear as well. The
sample on page 231 is the nearest in
appearance to my lost treasure, but is
too rococo in design to suit my rather
severe chimney-stack, I am afraid. If
you have some of those delightfully
designed carpet tacks shown on p. 160
kindly let bearer have about half-a-pint.
Yours faithfully,
AUGUSTUS WINTER.

Director of Drainford Munitions, Ltd.:

have made it sufficiently clear that my

One morning on the training-ground,
When fixing bayonets, he found
The fatal day already round,
And, even as he fixed, he
Decided then and there to state
To Sergeant Brown (at any rate)
His longing to congratulate
His sire on being sixty.
“Sergeant,” he said, “we’re on the eve
Of Father's birthday; grant me leave”
(And here his bosom gave a heave)
“To offer him my blessing;
And, if a Private's tender thanks—
Nay, do not blank my blanky blanks!
I could not help but leave the ranks;
Birthdays are more than dressing.”
The Sergeant was a kindly soul,
He loved his men upon the whole,
He "d also had a father's rôle
Pressed on him fairly lately.
“Bravo Chadd,” he said, “thou speakest

O happy day! O pious youth !

The Sergeant took him by the hand
And led him to the Captain, and

THE MINISTRY OF ENTERTAINMENT.
THE suggestion of the manager of the
Coliseum, made at lunch at the National
Liberal Club (luncheon-rooms generally
having become the new forum), that his
employer, Mr. Oswald Stoll, should
be appointed Ministerof Entertainment,
quickly led to developments. A meet-
ing of the entertainers and managers
of London was called on Sunday to dis-
cuss the matter. The new knight, Sir
HENRY Tozer, was in the chair, sup-
ported by a galaxy of talent.
The Chairman opened the proceedings
by a few remarks as to the gratifying
recognition recently accorded by the
Crown to the Music Hall profession.
(Hear, hear.) Doubtless, he said, a
Minister of Entertainment would be a
useful functionary. It was notorious
that the soldier on leave and the tired
war-worker found their greatest relief
in theatres and music-halls—(Cheers)
—and the propaganda play had, he was
sure, a fine future—if done rightly.
(Laughter.) So far, judging by the speci-
mens which had been produced at the
Coliseum, these plays could not be said
to have been a shining success. What
they had now to do was to select with the
utmost care the right man. (Hear, hear.)
Lieutenant GRossMITH said that the
Minister of Entertainment must be
someone in touch with the world—one
who moved about and was seen, not a
mysterious recluse. He proposed Mr.
|
Mr. LAURILLARD said that he greatly
valued the proposition which had been
so unexpectedly—(Cheers)—made by
his friend, whom they were all very
glad to see there to-day, knowing as
they did how difficult it was for him to
snatch a moment from his naval duties;
but he, the speaker, did not feel quali-
fied to fill the post alone. With Lieu-
tenant GRossMITH to share the burden
he might consider it.
Mr. C. B. CochRAN said that he failed
to see what a Minister of Entertainment
would do. Every manager who knew
his own business and was at all alive
was a Minister of Entertainment as it
was. What would Mr. STOLL do if he
were appointed 2 Would he impose a re-
volving stage on every theatre? Was the
propaganda play to be a staple? If so
he, the speaker, was entitled to be heard,
for he was the only person present who
had been successful with it.
Mr. ALFRED BUTT said that he con-
sidered the suggestion of a Minister of
Entertainment a good one, even though
he might not approve of the particular
way in which it was made; but obvi-
ously a man should be chosen who not
only was at the head of the profession
but had already been entrusted with
Government administrations.
The Acting Manager of the Palace,
following, proposed Mr. ALFRED BUTT
as the best possible Minister of Enter-
tainment.
Mr. GEORGE Robey said that in his
manager.
Try as they might to avoid
it, managers were almost certain to do
something beneficial to their own places
of amusement; whereas a comedian
had no such axe to grind. He named
no names, but he would remind them—
as something of an augury—that there
was present a comedian who not only
had been successful in organising a
number of War concerts, but who had
earned the significant title of “Prime
Minister of Mirth.” (Cheers.)
Mr. STOLL, rising with a dignity all
his own, said that he was both pained
and surprised by some of the remarks
to which they had listened. He had
understood that his own appointment

(FEBRUARY 6, 1918.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, January 28th.-By way of a
little gibe at the usual effect of Lord
RHoNDDA's regulations Mr. WRIGHT
inquired whether he would fix a price
for wood-pigeons, sparrows and rats.
Feigning an obtuseness which I am
sure he does not possess, Mr. PARKER
replied that it was a question for
the Food-Production Department, and
drove the questioner to explain that if
only the FooD-CoNTROLLER would fix
prices for these pests they would imme-
diately disappear.
Armagh virumque cano. Mr. JAMES
LoNSDALE took his seat to-day in the
room of his brother, now Lord ARMAGH-
DALE. He was escorted up the floor by
Sir Edward CARson, who looks twice
the man he did before he decided, a
week ago, to practise his well-known
virtue of resignation. When he left the
previous Temple of Coalition it was to
act as a battering-ram. Now, it is
understood, his rôle will be rather that
of a flying-buttress.
The Commons got through a lot of
work in a short time. Mr. WHITEHouse
and other patriots opposed the clause
in the Registration Bill which em-
powers a policeman to require any man
to produce his card. This, they said,
was “sheer Prussianism”—a thing
which, except in Prussia, they cannot
abide. But the House accepted Mr.
HAYES FISHER's assurance that the
British constable, like another cele-
indignant. “It was,” he said, “another
instance of the Englishman bullying
the downtrodden Scotsman.” Mr.
CLYNEs, whom he accused of this
tyranny, is, I should estimate, just about
half Mr. WATT's fighting weight.
The House of Commons owes all its
powers to its control of finance, yet,
except on Budget nights, finance is

the one subject which is sure to empty
it. There was hardly a quorum while
Mr. SAMUEL and other Members of the
Select Committee dilated on the growth
of national expenditure and suggested
means of curbing it. The CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER listened patiently,
even when Mr. SAMUEL quoted “A
chiel's amang ye” in an accent which
BURNs (RoRERT, not Johs) would have
failed to recognise. This may have up-
brated character, “is not a Prussian,”
and passed the Bill.
Tuesday, January 29th.-In view
of a recent magisterial utterance, to
which Mr. Punch has already drawn
attention, I ought perhaps to say
that the Marriages Provisional Order
(No. 2) Bill is not a statute for the
encouragement or condonation of
bigamy. It is the Order that is pro-
visional, not the marriages.
Mr. ForstER rejected as absurd the
report that in a stone quarry near
Calais, now worked by the Labour
Corps, a dentist could possibly be em-
ployed. Yet one would have thought
no profession would feel so much at
home in a stone quarry.
Letters on purely family matters
are occasionally delayed by the CEN-
sor's department because, according
to the HoME SECRETARY, they are too
long to be read, or too illegible. “But
if they are illegible,” asked Mr. Hogg|E
with the adamantine logic of the Scot,
“what harm can there be in passing
them 2 ”

for potatoes had been fixed at ten
shillings less in Scotland than in

his recent speech on the conscription
of capital will hardly increase his repu-
tation as a sound financier. Students
may be interested in the “psychological
movements in the mind of the CHAN-
CELLoR of THE ExchEQUER,” as Mr.
AsquitH called them, but investors pre-
fer a more tangible security.
Wednesday, January 30th.-Where
the fair sex is concerned the Senior
Service never forgets its chivalry. On
learning that pheasants might be shot
during the close season Sir HEDworTH
MEUx hoped that Mr. PROTHERo would
discriminate in favour of the hens.
I regret to say his example was lost
upon Mr. KING, who, in drawing atten-
tion to the food difficulties in boarding-
schools, laid special stress on the desir-
ability of not reducing the rations of
growing boys. “And why not grow-
ing girls, too, Mr. KING” came in an
audible whisper from where the grille
used to be.
When the Lords' amendments to
the Representation of the People Bill
came up for discussion the Government
temporarily abdicated its functions and
left Proportional Representation to a
free vote. With the reins on its neck
and no fear of the Whip, the House
kicked up its heels in fine style. All
the party-households were divided
against themselves. Tory twitted Tory,
Radical railed against Radical, Labour
belaboured Labour. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
who was cradled in the Caucus, was
sure that under “P.R.” party-organisa-
tions would be more rampant than ever.
Lord Robert CECIL, who sees in
“P.R.” an umbrella against “the dan-
gerous storms to come,” denounced
his late colleague as a “vehement and
violent obscurantist.”
Similarly when Sir GEORGE CAvE,
most moderate of men, ventured to
mention a few of the practical diffi-
culties in the way, he was promptly
accused of “unintentional exaggera-
tion ” by Mr. BALFour, whose enthu-
siasm for “P.R.” is partly caused by
the reflection that had it existed in
1906 he might still be Member for
Manchester.
I rather think that Members in
general shared the view of Mr. As-
QUITH, who was all for trying “P.R.”
experimentally in somebody else's
constituency, but recoiled in horror
from the thought of its introduction
into his beloved Fife. In the end
“P.R.” was knocked out by 110, the
largest of the many majorities re-
corded against it this Session.

loudly demanded a further “comb-out”
of the embusqués in Government offices,
and declared that “Whitehall sticks in
the gizzard of the public.” Then a
voice from the Labour benches, in quiet
but penetrating tones, asked, “Does
the over-anxiety on this question come
from Ireland 2’’ and Mr. LYNCH col-
lapsed into silence.
The efforts of the Peers to improve
the methods of election to the Lower
House met with a further rebuff. Non
tali auzilio was the feeling of the
majority of the Commons, who decided
to reinstate the “Alternative Vote ''
which their Lordships had eliminated.
The debate revealed some ignorance as
to the exact meaning of the subject-
matter; but it is not true that a Scot-
tish Member, much concerned about
food substitutes, was heard to inquire,
“What are these Alternative Oats, and
are they any good for porridge?"

THE LAWS OF MUSIC.
[Dedicated with profound reverence to the
author of the coruscating article on the same
subject in a recent number of The Times.]
“Rules and schools are made for
fools,” as Squinchler says in his Aphor-
isms for Artists—a work proscribed at
all academies, but of priceless value in
encouraging fruitful revolt against sys-
tems and soulless precision. Music has
its laws, but they cannot be stated with
mathematical exactitude. Thus the
law of centrality, the first law which the
composer obeys, can easily be misunder-
stood by formalists. Of three things
in a row one must be in the middle,
but that does not make it central.
And as with geometry so with arith-
metic—its rules are a broken reed to
the musician.
The laws of music stand apart from all
other laws, since they are most triumph-
antly obeyed by those who are entirely
unconscious of their obedience or of
the existence of the laws themselves.
MozART, as we showed recently, knew
nothing of the law of centrality, but
if we look at the texture of his work,
the density of the stuff, the quality of
his fibre, or at the period, the sweep of
the effort and preciousness of the mo-
ments, we recognise that he was at
least subliminally conscious of its para-
mount and insistent value.
This then is the first of those laws
to hearken to which is better than the
fat of rams—that things which are in
the middle are not necessarily central,
and that conversely things which are
central must not be middling. There are
four others of hardly less vital import-
ance, all of which are splendidly obeyed
by our younger composers.
The law of antinomy, which Squin-
chler in one of his luminous prefaces
defines as a reconciliation between the
categorical imperative and the cosmic
paulo-post-futuristic permissive, is that
which young composers follow when
they synthesize divergent planes of
emotional content instead of leaving
them to emerge independently in their
intrinsic fluorescence. It is this law
which Squinchler himself nobly illus-
trates by the two immortal semiquavers
that intrude upon the quavers in the
penumbra of his Aldebaran. The law
of obscurity, which darkens without
hiding and produces an atmosphere at
once fuliginous and translucent, sug-
gesting a º twilight, is better
displayed in Bobolinkoff's excursions
into the crepuscular inane than in such
square-cut tunes as “John Brown's
Body” or “O Dem Golden Slippers.”
As Percy Cornstalk observes in one of
his homely but pregnant apophthegms,
“It is better to aim at nothing and hit

AT THE PLAY.
“LOVE IN A CoTTAGE.”
I IMAGINE the author of A Man of
Honour and Human Bondage, tongue
in cheek and one eyelid mischievously
pendulous, spreading his elbows to the
roguish work of writing Love in a Cot-
tage. “I will give them,” says he, “heaps
of money; Como and Paris; some titles;
some amusing lines and a few little
quips of my own; a few of other peo-
ple's, well worn, so that they at least
will be recognised with the tribute of
familiar laughter. I have done this
sort of thing before, but this time I
will not be merely artificial, I will be
preposterous; not just pleasantly and
flippantly shallow but deliberately and
conspicuously insincere; my satire shall
not be merely obvious, it shall be posi-
tively crude. And you will see they will
come and eat it out of my hand. . . .”
In the First Act the Hotel Splendide
on the Lake at Como shows you a
disgruntled millionaire; his spouse, a
tyrannical hypochondriac; a sweet run-
away wife, hired nurse of this unattrac-
tive patient; ..sundry women whose
tongues wag against so unsuitably
pretty a dependent; and sundry males
competing for her favour and mitigating
the severity of her bondage. The only
soft spot in the old millionaire's money-
bound heart, by the way, is his fatherly
affection for our charming Sybil. A
letter announces the suicide of her un-
satisfactory husband and her inherit-
ance of half-a-million, subject to the
condition of her not remarrying.
Act II. gives us our heroine charm-
ingly gowned. Toadying to the new
rich takes the place of the feline
gossip and tyranny. Our Sybil flip-
pantly accepts the hand of a fortune-
hunter who doesn't know of the will's
limiting clause and who beats an igno-
minious retreat when he does; she
refuses the proper hero, a pleasant
philosophical young doctor who neither
covets nor possesses the wealth that
everybody else, including Sybil, thinks
so desperately important. He takes his
refusal without dismay, biding his
Fourth Act. And Sybil, after distribu-
ting largesse to the parson and two
shameless spinsters, stretches out her
arms to Paris and freedom with a full
urse.
And then (Act III.) comes disillusion-
ment. At her famous fancy-dress ball,
to which an exiled minor king is coming
incognito, one of her guests borrows
ten thousand francs and another blandly
proposes that she shall be his mistress
to save him the trouble of working for
a living. So that when a telegram from
the young Como doctor bids her come
leaves her house by the window while
the already announced royalty is mount-
ing the stairs. Possibly she is appre-
hensive as to the size of the loan he
will require or the nature of the liaison
he will propose. The curtain deprives
us of the sight of the royal chagrin–
which is a pity.
It is, then, a disillusioned beauty that
in Act IV. comes back to the azure

loves the rich—poor things. They are

son interrupts to beg her for help for
his church, and the two spinsters try to
negotiate a loan, which so annoys the
old man that he goes off and shoots
himself. And the doctor has hardly
certified life to be extinct before he
returns to press his rejected suit and
the twain declare for Love in a Cottage.
A most convincing sermon, is it not, on
this misery of riches? -
Miss MARIE LöHR makes her first
trial of the adventure of management.
She has every reason to read the omens
as favourable. “Her fortunate keel ”
should “touch golden sands,” in the
words of her modest and polite pro-
gramme sonnet. She has the one in-
dispensable quality for success on the
London stage—a charming prettiness,
which she uses with excellent effect in
the many changes of becoming costume
for which her thoughtful author had
moods of quiet roguishness. If she
did not seem to feel the more solemn
passages—well, perhaps she had such
excuses as I have indicated.
Mr. MULCASTER's doctor was a very
pleasantly handled young man, the
most satisfactory of the author's cha-
racters. Exquisite touches of humour
and tenderness in Mr. WALENTINE’s grim
millionaire were good to see. Miss
HAIDEE WRIGHT had to waste her fine
powers on that foolish puppet, the
millionaire's invalid wife, and Miss
ELLEN O'MALLEY's cleverness had little
or no scope in the peg part of a com-
panion. Mr. GAYER MACKAY scored
excellent points as the asinine and mer-
cenary lover . . . I cannot think the
players believed in their play, which
should have an excellent run. T.

“WHo's HE, FATHER2" “HE 'S A BEEFEATER."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Free Press (ALLEN AND UNwiN) is a reprint in volume
form of certain articles by Mr. HILAIRE BELLoc which
I remember in the trenchant pages of The New Age. In
them he sets out to prove that the Common (or Capitalist,
as he calls it) newspaper is useless and dangerous, and ought
to be abolished; and conversely that the hope of the future
lies in a Press genuinely free both from the shackles of
private ownership and the tyranny of advertisement. In
one respect at least I should join issue with Mr. BELLoc.
Never, I fancy, was what we call the influence of the Press
so apparently great but in reality so slight. We may all,
or most of us, buy more papers than ever before; but as
for that pathetic faith, which I seem to recall from the
early days of 1914, by which a statement read in The Daily
Something became ipso facto more probable than not.—
where, oh where is it now 2 Still, after making allowance
for Mr. BELLOC's prejudices (notably that eagerness cher-
cher le juif which is still an obsession with him) the fact
remains that he has stated clearly and well an exceedingly
strong case; though I cannot think that he is altogether
kind in his comparison of the notes in The Spectator to
“the conversation of commercial travellers in a railway car-
riage.” That any indictment of the “advertisement-run”
papers naturally resolves itself more or less into a puff of
certain organs notoriously not thus supported is perhaps
unavoidable. Mr. BELLoc's little book is a half-crown's
worth of special pleading over which anyone, with whatever
result to his convictions, may spend a stimulating hour.
In a dedicatory letter Mr. HUGH WALPoDE explains that
“Is THAT why Lond RHoNDDA shut HIM UP IN THE ToweR 2"
and almost excuses himself for allowing it to be published
Both explanation and excuse are unnecessary. Mr. WALPoDE
is dealing with a subject which will be as vital when the
War ends as it ever was. It is not so much a story of
family life (though it is that) as of Family. The Trenchards
—we have here their history through three generations—
were obsessed with the Family Idea. (Incidentally I may
say that longevity was a habit of theirs, and to crowd
uncomfortably under one roof was another.) Unfortunates
who were neither Trenchards nor connected with them
simply did not count. Whether in London or Cornwall,
which for some unintelligible reason is called “Glebeshire,”
the Trenchards fortified themselves against the outer world.
Through their defences a young man thrusts himself and
has the temerity to fall in love with Katherine, of the
youngest generation, the joy of the whole Family. How
the intruder is absorbed into and deadened by the Trenchard
atmosphere is cleverly told; though the process of assimila-
tion would have been more impressive if he had had a
really strong will of his own. The triumph of the book is
Katherine's mother. Till now I never appreciated how
devastatingly selfish a devoted mother can be. Though
Mr. WALPoLE's wealth of detail is doubtless justified by
the nature of his theme, I confess that at times it strained
my patience. On the other hand I would gladly have been
told more about Vincent Trenchard, who is announced to
be coming home from Eton, but (though I anxiously looked
for his arrival through many pages) never puts in an
appearance. An Eton boy's breezy presence among so
many ancient and middle-aged people would have been a
welcome tonic. It is a great pity that he got mislaid.

“Who's HE, FATHER2" “HE 's A BEEFEATER."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Free Press (ALLEN AND UNwiN) is a reprint in volume
form of certain articles by Mr. HILAIRE BELLoc which
I remember in the trenchant pages of The New Age. In
them he sets out to prove that the Common (or Capitalist,
as he calls it) newspaper is useless and dangerous, and ought
to be abolished; and conversely that the hope of the future
lies in a Press genuinely free both from the shackles of
private ownership and the tyranny of advertisement. In
one respect at least I should join issue with Mr. BELLoc.
Never, I fancy, was what we call the influence of the Press
so apparently great but in reality so slight. We may all,
or most of us, buy more papers than ever before; but as
for that pathetic faith, which I seem to recall from the
early days of 1914, by which a statement read in The Daily
Something became ipso facto more probable than not—
where, oh where is it now 2 Still, after making allowance
for Mr. BELLoc's prejudices (notably that eagerness cher-
cher le juif which is still an obsession with him) the fact
remains that he has stated clearly and well an exceedingly
strong case; though I cannot think that he is altogether
kind in his comparison of the notes in The Spectator to
"the conversation of commercial travellers in a railway car-
riage.” That any indictment of the “advertisement-run”
papers naturally resolves itself more or less into a puff of
certain organs notoriously not thus supported is perhaps
unavoidable. Mr. BELLoc's little book is a half-crown's
worth of special pleading over which anyone, with whatever
result to his convictions, may spend a stimulating hour.
In a dedicatory letter Mr. HUGH WALPole explains that
“Is THAT why LoRD RHoNDDA SHUT HIM UP IN THE ToweR 2"
and almost excuses himself for allowing it to be published
Both explanation and excuse are unnecessary. Mr. WALPOLE
is dealing with a subject which will be as vital when the
War ends as it ever was. It is not so much a story of
family life (though it is that) as of Family. The Trenchards
—we have here their history through three generations—
were obsessed with the Family Idea. (Incidentally I may
say that longevity was a habit of theirs, and to crowd
uncomfortably under one roof was another.) Unfortunates
who were neither Trenchards nor connected with them
simply did not count. Whether in London or Cornwall,
which for some unintelligible reason is called “Glebeshire,”
the Trenchards fortified themselves against the outer world.
Through their defences a young man thrusts himself and
has the temerity to fall in love with Katherine, of the
youngest generation, the joy of the whole Family. How
the intruder is absorbed into and deadened by the Trenchard
atmosphere is cleverly told; though the process of assimila-
tion would have been more impressive if he had had a
really strong will of his own. The triumph of the book is
Katherine's mother. Till now I never appreciated how
devastatingly selfish a devoted mother can be. Though
Mr. WALPoLE's wealth of detail is doubtless justified by
the nature of his theme, I confess that at times it strained
my patience. On the other hand I would gladly have been
told more about Vincent Trenchard, who is announced to
be coming home from Eton, but (though I anxiously looked
for his arrival through many pages) never puts in an
appearance. An Eton boy's breezy presence among so
many ancient and middle-aged people would have been a
welcome tonic. It is a great pity that he got mislaid.

Foreign Legion. These episodes, sometimes blood-curdling,
in the outlandish careers of individual legionaries, be they
English, Scottish or American, serve indirectly as an indi-
cation of the fighting spirit of France. If her stepsons
are like this what must her sons be 2 The tales are said
to be true, but I find it hard to believe that the gay and
lively imagination of the author has not had some play.
True, the depôt of this regiment was once the ultimate
collecting-place of the world's most reckless, adventurous
and abandoned rips. Even for them, however, life could not
have been such a concentration of brutality and romance,
terror and humour. But no matter if Captain WREN has
touched up the picture a bit; these infantry units of the
grand French army deserve to be advertised on flaming
posters. I hope he will do the same for the other magnifi-
cent troops to whom he refers from time to time; in par-
ticular the Chasseur Alpin requires to be better known
out of his own country. Meanwhile it should be noted
Miss SHARP is far too intelligent not to estimate such
rubbish at its proper value; one recalls work of hers in
the past, contributions to The Yellow Book, for example, as
proof of this. And one feels sorry for her to-day.
Elizabeth Allenby in An Officer's Wife (JENKINs) was the
victim of a vexatious will, which made her whole income con-
ditional upon her remaining single. No doubt it was right
in principle, but somehow it wasn't made to seem natural in
fact, that, having roused her Tony up to an enthusiastic pro- |
posal, she should lie about this in the fear that the proposal
might be held up by chivalrous feelings on her account.
After all, he was very, very young and she was very, very
pretty, and they were together in a conservatory, and the
lights were low and the palms were accommodating; it
only needed an “I’d sooner be as poor as poor with you,
darling, than as rich as be blowed by myself,” and I don't
think Tony would have given the matter another thought

touch upon the present

word of advice, in conclu-
sion, to Louise HEILGERs:
she should not permit her
women to use improbable
cattishisms; and next time
detestation of war that is of course common to us all.
Whether she objects to the present War chiefly, or to wars in
general, is a point that may be left obscure. What is by no
means obscure is the perplexed irritation of the author over
the fact that the majority of her fellow-countrymen should
have found even the horror of war preferable to certain
other unpleasantness, to national dishonour for example.
On every page that she devotes to this problem you will
read plainly the vexation of a clever pleader devoid of argu-
ments; in their place she can give us nothing but vain
reiteration of the physically revolting aspect of bloodshed
(as if there was a man or woman to-day who did not under-
stand as much '), mingled with uneasy sarcasm at the sim-
plicity of mind that would brave such terrors for an ideal
incomprehensible to the better-informed writer. There is a
certain sameness, not to say monotony, about the method of
Miss SHARP's propaganda; the “quiet” puppet, generally
“in the corner," figures largely, with what the author clearly
intends as unanswerable objections. “Why are the Ger.
mans called Huns? And why have we gone to war with
Hunland?' proceeded this tiresome young woman. The
she should get a man to edit her slang and bring it up to date.
Tony, meaning to be intensely human, appeared at times,
by reason of his selection of words, to be slightly common.
The Chronicles of St. Tid (SKEFFINGTON) gives us yet
another opportunity to admire Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts in
his out-and-out West-Country mood. Here we have sixteen
sketches of St. Tid, which is the Phillpottsian for Delabole,
and although none of them is remarkable all are readable.
Possibly the characters are not quite so quaint as we are
accustomed to find them in the author's West-Country
tales, but what we lose in humour we gain in trueness to
life. For my own part I am never more content than when
Mr. PHILLPoTTs has seated a bevy of his creations com-
fortably in an inn, and I may stay with them
“Until the clock with muffled chime asserts that it is closing time,
And o'er the fields now white with rime the company retires.”
In this book there is not much bar-parlour gossip, but the
tale which appeals to me most is suggestively called “The
Green Man' and “The Tiger.’” However low this taste of
mine may be, Mr. PHILLPoTTs is responsible for having

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS FROM THE HOME FRONT.
MY DEAR REGINALD,--I sometimes
fear that in the ordered conditions of
your trench life you lack imagination to
picture the cruel rigours of war as we
suffer them at home. You who, except
when you leave the beaten track for a
few days’ excursion into the enemy's
lines, can always count upon that re-
gularity in the service of meals which
is so essential to a right assimilation
of food—it is difficult for you to grasp
what it means to be uncertain where
your next pat of butter is to come from.
Will you believe it that last Friday a
friend of mine, after an exhausting
round of golf, could get nothing more
sustaining at the club than a dozen of
oysters, a medium-sized sole (Diep-
poise), an omelette aux fines herbes, and
a couple of péches Melba? No cheese
at all, mark you. -
You cannot have figured to yourself
what is likely to be the effect upon one's
self-respect of being forced to live on
a diet of vegetables for five or six hours
on end (it may come to this!), when all
one's life one has ridiculed the fanati-
cism of those who adopt the vegetarian
creed. Nor can you conceive the humi-
liation endured by the citizen of a free
country when he is compelled to present
an official sugar-card before he can be
served with sweetening matter. You
are indeed fortunate to have none of
these disintegrating anxieties to distract
you from the performance of your daily
duties.
And what do you know of the in-
describable horror of the queue, you
who have never so much as seen one,
except outside a cinema palace or a
music-hall? . For you can hardly call
it a queue, in our bitter sense of the
word, when you move in single file up
a communication trench to relieve some
unit in the firing-line. In the first
place your forward progress is relatively
swift and continuous; and, secondly,
you are at least fairly well assured, as
we never are, of attaining your object
at the end. You seldom arrive to find
disheartening notices posted up on the
enemy's parapet: “No whizz-bangs to-
day”; “No snipers”; “No gas,” and
so forth. -
Still, you must not think that we are
complaining. Rest assured that we bear
these sacrifices, however involuntary,
with a reticence worthy of the race.
You should be proud of us. Grumblers
there are, of course, here and there; but
I for one have no patience with those
who protest that they would give a
good deal for a week or so at the Flan-
ders front.
I naturally say nothing of the perils
Front. After all, your own life out
there is not entirely free from danger.
You too run a certain risk from enemy
bombers. But you have your compen
sations which I think you may be apt
to overlook. You engaged yourself to
be a soldier and it is your business—
and therefore, no doubt, your pleasure
—to be bombed. With us civilians it
is what I may call an extra–an im-
position which we never undertook to
tolerate. In your case, again, it is
part of a daily routine which has by
now, I hope, become an unconscious
habit with you. With us, on the other
hand, these air-raids are so desultory
and spasmodic in their incidence that
we have not yet acquired the familiarity
which breeds indifference. --
Further, unless you deliberately pro-
ject yourself into the zone of your own
barrage you are largely immune from
the attacks of British guns. Whereas
we, as often as once a month or even
more, are compelled to seek cover from
the devastating duds of our Metropoli-
tan artillery. -
You will recognise, then, my dear
Reginald, that, though you and I share
the common burden of Armageddon, it
presses on us in very different ways.
You are engaged, if I may so say,
upon an interesting expedition after big
game in foreign parts, where everything
has a spice of exotic adventure. But
here the War (which we never went out
to meet) comes home to our very doors.
Once more I am not complaining.
Nothing could be further from my
thoughts than to wish to unman you
by the tale of our sufferings. I only
want you to understand what we are
bearing for your sakes, because, if I
know anything of your sympathetic
nature, a full comprehension of the
facts will only strengthen you in your
determination to complete the over-
throw of an enemy who is causing so
much inconvenience in the home circle.
Ever your affectionate Guardian,

so, until my day-dream is interrupted
by the voice of the Sergeant-Major
crying aloud that the company is ready
to have its feet inspected, I will talk to
you about my most memorable wicket.
. It happened at a house in Sussex,
where I was the only civilian—I mean
layman—in a Pan-Anglican team of
clergymen. -
I was a stranger, and the prospect of
meeting the clergy in bulk made me very
nervous, so before starting I wrote my-
self a short but warmly expressed testi-
monial of character from the Bishop
of Sodor and Man as moral support.
However, they proved a most cheery
company—and they could certainly
play cricket. We stayed in the whole
of the first day, making over four
hundred.
Our opponents had several first class
bats, and their first three wickets pro-
duced two hundred runs; then there
was a slump in the standard, and the
innings closed for two hundred and
twelve. They followed on at three
o'clock, determined to play out time if
they could.
The heroes of their first innings—a
gunner Major and a Cambridge Blue—
came in again and gradually took root.
Bowler after bowler was tried without
success. Runs came slowly, but runs
had ceased to count; the whole question
now was, could we get their first three
wickets down in time for the subse-
quent procession to repeat itself?
As usual, I had at the beginning of
the game warned my captain that no
useful purpose would be served by
putting me on to bowl.
On this occasion, however, things
were desperate. The captain came up
to me. “Have you never bowled?” he
asked.
“Hardly ever, unless I was captain-
ing the side.”
“Well, have a go this end. How do
you want your field? Are you fast?"
“Far from it.” I gave a glance
round the field. “They'll do as they
are, except that I want one man on the
leg boundary to stop the pulls.”
“Right. Hugh, you go.”

passed me; “I’m horribly short in the
wind.”
My first ball to the Blue was a superb
long-hop to leg. The batsman smote
it contemptuously past the square-leg
umpire, and Hugh, after a wild sprint
of fifty yards, failed by inches to save
the boundary. The Major at my end
grinned. Hugh was not a graceful
l’llnner.
I signalled to him to stay where he
was and bowled again ; the thing

“What about having another

the captain.

I may begin to do so in fact.”
“Um ' " he said. I don't
know what he meant, but the
Major, who seemed to have a
strong sense of humour, gave
a gurgle of laughter.
My third delivery was a
short one just wide of the leg
stump, and the batsman, with
the careless certainty of habit,
whacked it to the old place
behind the square-leg umpire.
I didn't see anything to laugh
at, and I'm sure Hugh didn't,
but the Major lay on the ground
and shouted.
“Bowler's name?” piped
our host's thirteen-year-old
daughter suddenly from the
score-tent.
“Other,” I said hastily.
“A. N. Other.” But it was useless to
try to hush it up. Everybody on the
field seemed to be shouting my name
for the next ten minutes, covering me
with confusion.
As I took off for my next ball I
suddenly noticed that the captain had,
without further consulting me, rein-
forced the apoplectic Hugh with a long-
legged prebendary from extra-cover.
Annoyed by this insult, I determined
that, at any rate, the next ball should
pitch on the off side of the wicket.
It did.
Point was very nice about it, but I
could see that he was more hurt than
he would admit. He insisted, however,
that it was his own fault entirely; he
ought to have been on the look-out.
Mid-off pointed out that the previous
balls had each scored four to the bats-

one to the extras; which showed a very
gratifying improvement on my part.
I delivered my next amid a tense
hush of expectation. It was (at last)
according to schedule, a slow one, pitch-
ing on the off and breaking in. But
the batsman—a man of few ideas and
hawk-like eye—hooked it round straight
at the unfortunate Hugh, who was wip-
ing his dewy spectacles and continued
serenely to do so while the ball trickled
between his legs to the boundary.
A roar of laughter went round the
field, and the Major showed signs of
hysteria. He was so far.gone that the
fact that my next two balls were good
began to laugh and was bowled. He
staggered back to the pavilion with the
tears streaming down his cheeks.
This was the turning-point of the
game. We won ten minutes from time
by an innings and thirteen runs. No
arguments of mine could persuade the
youthful scorer to credit me with my
wicket, but I think no right-minded
person will deny that
“Oh, all right, Sergeant-Major. I'm
just coming.”
A MATTER OF TEMPERATURE.
I HAD not seen Frederick since we

the other day, when I came

I told Frederick so. I said he

“Not fuel,” said Frederick,
turning a pale eye on me.
The temperature of our Mess,
I remarked, was so inhospitable
that I felt I could not possibly
ask a long-lost friend into it.
So he led the way into his little
office, where we sat before a
roaring log fire.
I talked about the dear old
school. I quoted the senti-
ments of the Eton Boating
Song. I said how well we held
together—always ready to ex-
tend a hand to one another in
the hour of need. I regretted
my slackness in the old days
and discovered an admiration
for the virtues of application
and perseverance which had al-
ways characterised Frederick.
length and had to be treated with
respect seemed to him to be the crown-
ing absurdity of the whole incident.
The field changed over and the cap-
tain came up to me.
“Reluctantly,” he said, “I must take
you off. We have all enjoyed your
over very much, and if we only had a
little more time to spare. . . . How-
ever, you must come down later on and
do it for us again, and we'll ask Hugh
down for the day.”
Our fast left-hander began his run. ...
“But look here,” you say, “if you
were taken off at this point, what about
your wicket 2"
Well, as a matter of fact it was, so to
speak, a posthumous wicket, but still
mine by all the laws of cause and effect.

ball to the Major, that happy warrior
I put in some violent coughs, attributed

from yet another direction, I quoted a
report which argued that moral was a

ature of the blood. Now I come to
think of it, I'm afraid I did most of
the talking. I got little more than
monosyllables out of Frederick, cer.
tainly not so much as a handful of
shavings.
Clearly Frederick was not a case for
diplomacy. Timothy, my batman, who
overheard my impotent ravings later
in the day, also came to this conclusion.

ments that night in friendly converse
with one who stayed to chat in spite
of the dark and the cold. “Did he
know,” this one asked, “a bloke called
'Emery Coleman—a little fair chap with
a ginger moustache?” No, he did not.
He knew Bert Coleman, who was in
the same section. Bert Coleman was
a little chap, but you wouldn't hardly
call his moustache ginger; it was
darkish-like. There was also a Corporal
Coleman in the Umptieth Company—
the same Division. Corporal Coleman
was fair, but hadn't got no moustache.
And so on until two shadowy figures,
heavily laden, had crossed out of the
dump behind the sentry and were lost
in the blackness of the night.
The quest of 'Enery Coleman was .
resumed twenty-four hours later. The
sentry, touched by the pathetic story
of Mrs. Coleman, who sighed for news
of her 'Enery, forgot his duty, forgot
the dump and forgot even to blow his
fingers and stamp his feet. He was
helpful ; he suggested that 'Enery
might have shaved his moustache,
might now be a corporal. He gave
elaborate directions to the place where
Corporal Coleman might be found.
Timothy could hardly get away from
him, he was so interested in the Cole-
man CàSe.
Then Timothy tried daylight, for-
swearing the aid of 'Enery Coleman.
With two men and a hand-cart he
trundled briskly into the dump just as
Frederick emerged from the other side
of it. Timothy owed much, I under-
stand, to the moral effect of the hand-
cart.
“Cold morning, Corporal,” Timothy
said politely. “I just seen your officer.

a piece of paper. “Shall we take 'em

“No, my lad,” said the N.C.O., who
regarded a private of infantry as some-
thing very easy, “you'll take 'em from
'ere.” And he carefully selected nine
particularly twisty pit-props that might
have been designed by ARTHUR RACK-
HAM. “Now you can sign for 'em,”
he added.
“That'll take us three journeys,”
says Timothy. “I’ll sign when we got

and I was very stern with him. I cited

after I had received a note from
Frederick which had followed us to
billets in another village. “A series of

THE SIMPLER LIFE.
I.
A RAT OFFENSIVE AND A CountER-
ATTACK.
IF anybody had told me a few weeks
ago that Elizabeth was ever likely to
be of the faintest use either to us or
to any other family of human beings,
I should merely have smiled. Our
latest general and the worst who has
ever commanded us, a veteran of forty-
six, combining a most forbidding ap-
pearance with every fault domestic
flesh is heir to, she had, at the time
of our move into the cottage, success-
fully baffled three several attempts on
our part to dismiss her. On the first
occasion she had informed us next day
(with tears) that she forgave us; on
the second she had declared that she
never accepted notice on a Sunday; on
the third she had refused to deal with
us in the matter save through the
medium of her solicitor. Finally we
took her with us to the cottage. It was
just possible that the kitchen range
might kill her; at any rate there could
be no harm in trying.
Rats are really rather romantic ani-
mals till they take to shedding their
fur on the butter. Then it is time to
put your foot down. The great diffi-
culty is to put it down in the right
place, that is, on the rat. Hardly
any man has ever done it successfully
except by a fluke. And of course women
never attempt such a thing ; they pre-
fer to leap on to the mantel-piece.
We might have known that there
would be rats in a country cottage. It
was true that our landlord had omitted
to mention the fact ; but now I come
to think of it almost the only matter
he did mention was the rent. He is
a man of few words, disregarding in-
essentials and going straight to the
heart of things.
On the third night after our arrival
they started. It seemed to be a race-
meeting, and was possibly one of their
ordinary fixtures, though from the
number of events and competitors I
was inclined to regard it at the time
more in the light of a joy-gathering to
celebrate our advent. The course was
roughly circular and embraced the
whole of the ground floor below the
boards. Next day we missed a loaf of
bread, a pound of margarine and part
of a ham, so no doubt refreshments had
been included in the programme.
On the following night proceedings
were quieter, but morning brought evi-
dence of still greater activity in the
larder and the store cupboard. We all
felt that something must be done.
The problem was, what. Of course
#. “to destroy the vermin and
ve absolutely no odour behind.” I
bought a bottle; but my wife disliked
the idea of leaving poison about the
house, even at night, since the younger
of our two children had more than
once been known to walk in her sleep,
and, as every parent knows, there is
scarcely an hour of the twenty-four
when a little girl of three years old is
not hungry. Elizabeth advised us to
pour tar into their dug-outs. No rat,
she said, could abide tar on its feet.
My objection to this was that the
enemy could easily counter by con-
structing fresh dug-outs, so that such
a plan of campaign would merely end
in the eventual honeycombing of the
whole place.
“Why not try a trap 2" suggested
my wife.
I shrugged my shoulders. “I do not
know,” I said, “the precise number of
rats there may be at the present moment
in and about this cottage. Possibly it
runs into hundreds. With a trap we
might, or we might not, catch a couple
a week. Is it worth it 2"
“No," she agreed.
That was really my point all through.
Half-measures, I felt, were useless.
By hook or by crook I must devise
some fearful devastating blow which
would either slay them or drive them
from the cottage en masse. Nights
and days dragged wearily by, nights of
fitful sleep broken by the horrid riot-
ings of our invisible foe; days of deep-
ening anxiety and desperate aimless
resolves. And then quite unexpectedly
it fell, the blow I dreamed of dealing.
But it was not I who inflicted it.
One morning at breakfast-time Eliza-
beth announced that two rats had run
over her face in the night. I did not
believe it, and for a very good reason.
She said that in her dread of the crea-
tures she had gone to sleep with her
candle alight by her bedside. Had the
room been in darkness I could have
understood the accident happening.
But on her own confession the woman's
face must have been visible. She stuck
to her story, however, and a little later
to my surprise I came across a dead
rat just outside her bedroom door.
There was no mark of violence on the
body, which appeared plump and well-
nourished. Suddenly I understood.
Elizabeth had spoken the truth. I
picked it up by the tail, carried it into
the kitchen and showed it to her.
“Heart failure,” I said.
Presumably its companion survived
the shock and got off with nothing
worse than a bad scare. But the word
must have gone round, for since that
night there has been no trace of a rat
THE PHRASE OF THE
MOMENT.
WHENEVER there's a notice in the paper
Of trouble in the country of the Hun
Which makes me cut an optimistic
caper
Or fancy that the “cracking” has
begun,
Some leader-writer, promptly interven-
1ng,
This deadly phrase discharges at my
door :
“'Twere rash to overestimate its mean-
1ng ; -
'Twere foolish its importance to
ignore.”
If Labour in some influential section
Displays a wholesome hatred of the
Dolsh;
If weighty words, condemning insur-
rection,
Fall from the lips of, say, Archbishop
WALSH ;
Our Mentor, still oracularly screening
His vacillation, takes again the floor,
And begs we won't attach a serious
meaning
To statements which we oughtn't to
ignore.
Or if again some reassuring cables
Hint at a healthier attitude in Spain,
Or indicate the turning of the tables
Upon the Trotsky crew in the
Ukraine;
Or if we get a lull in submarining,
That fatal phrase again is to the fore:
“We ought not to exaggerate its mean-
ling,
Nor º its true significance ignore.”
Suppose I read that Austria is seething
With discontent, that Turkey's in
the dumps,
That LITTLE WILLIE's youngest child
is teething,
That HINDENBURG is smitten with
the mumps;
As sure as death or taxes or spring-
cleaning
It comes just like the raven's “Never-
more '': -
“'Twere rash to overestimate its mean-
1ng ; -
'Twere folly its importance to ignore.”
The need of duly sifting fact from fiction
Cannot be too persistently upheld
In dealing with a foeman whose ad-
diction
To “shamming dead” has never been
excelled;
But though our mood should not be
overweening
There's no excuse for this eternal
bore
Who bids us not to overrate the meaning
there are several varieties of poison, all
Of something that it's folly to ignore.

WAR-TIME APPAREL.
THERE is a shop in Holborn that I
find it very difficult during war-time
poverty to get out of. Even in these
days of high prices everything is ab-
surdly cheap there. There are baskets
of socks costing almost less than a
leash of sausages a pair; silk ties at
fourpence-halfpenny each hang in ser-
ried rows above one's head; pyjamas
that would startle a cab-horse to be
had for the price of a pound of tea, and
gloves for next to nothing at all.
I was passing the door the other
day, at least I hoped I was, but a
basket of ties at the door drew me in
to see if there were others less garish
at the same price inside, and I was lost.
When I had bought two ties, one
black with white spots and one ditto
with purple ditto, I paid ninepence
and prepared to walk out. As I got
near the door the string which was
holding up the port-side of my trousers
gave notice and I turned back. A
bunch of rare and refreshing braces
met my gaze and I retired to a secluded
part of the basement to fortify my-
self with tenpence-halfpenny-worth of
trouser anchorage.
My next attempt at leaving was
more futile than the first, and I found
bowler at four-and-elevenpence. With
the silk lining of my old bowler marked
“Superfine” inside my new purchase
I felt like a temporary gentleman.
By this time my loose silver was
thinning, and a nail-brush and a comb
reduced my exchequer by another ten-
pence-halfpenny.
“Do you mind leading me out?” I
said to a rather attractive French or
Belgian shop-assistant, extending my
hand and shutting my eyes. But she
was evidently “the girl who took the
wrong turning,” because when I opened
my eyes I found myself in front of
boxes of wash-leather gloves, and she
was saying enticingly, “Look, Sare,
only two-and-eleven pence and wash
like new. Try a pair on. Ah, zey fit
you perfectly.”
Whether the engaging smile made
the fit seem more satisfactory or not, I
certainly parted with another two-and-
elevenpence and made a determined
rush for the exit; but, chancing to
bump into a short stout gentleman who
was apparently in charge of the Sock-
enclosure, I was fined one-and-twopence
for my carelessness, ºf in ex-
change a pair of socks that will compel
me to show a few inches of them on
the least provocation, so fascinating
are their clocks, which almost tell the
I then gave myself up for lost and
ran amok. By the time I reached the
door I was staggering under a load of
haberdashery and outfittings; my over-
coat pockets were full of ties, collars,
studs, socks, gloves, a nail-brush, a
tooth-brush, a comb and the remains
of my old braces, which I was ashamed
to leave behind, and the string on
them was too useful to be abandoned.
I had under my arm a parcel contain-
ing a pair of purple-and-white-striped
pyjamas, a pair of ditto dittos of an
even rarer vintage and a cotton shirt
of choice blend.
As I mét the chilly air of Holborn I
found that all my loose cash had melted
away, and, in order to raise enough
capital for my bus fare to Charing
Cross, I was obliged to re enter the shop
and realise a couple of collar-studs.

so on da capo, until, at the end
of a far from perfect day, all
that remained of the unfor-

which Mar’s hired man, who
had taken the place of his

say that to-day the corpus vile
was in the custody of the Peers and
that, on the motion of Lord SEL-
Born E, boldly seconded by Lord LANs-
Down E, who advised their lordships
not to be afraid of “the bogey men at
the other end of the corridor,” they
once more flung it, curtailed by the
omission of the counties, back to the
Commons.
Content with this assertion of their
powers, the Lords proceeded to pass sun-
dry other Bills brought from the Lower
House. On the Redistribution of Seats
(Ireland) Bill some of them protested
against giving two more members to
that already over-represented country;
but they did not insist on a division,
and meekly acquiesced in the Govern-
ment's proposal to amend the schedule
by substituting “Parnell Street” for
“Great Britain Street.” It was only
“a drafting amendment,” as Lord PEEL
explained; yet to those who remember
1886 and 1893 it symbolises a revolu-
tion.
Tuesday, February 5th.-Before re-
suming the contest with “another
place” the Commons had a little busi-
ness of their own, in a list of 184
Questions. The information extracted
from Ministers was, as usual, in inverse
ratio to the curiosity of the questioners.
Still the House as a whole was glad to
hear that if the Germans transferred
their officer-prisoners to air-raid areas
we should not hesitate to do the same.

“WHY SHOULD I BE THE MOP2’”
MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN'S REPLY TO
Mac re. was alleged to have received two suc- to make the boroughs the subject of
this electoral experiment. Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, who,
untrammelled by office, is be-
coming quite a lively speaker,
referred to an argument ad-
vanced in the Upper House
that “P.R.” would be a safe-
guard against revolution. “Let
them try to keep out the At-
lantic if they like,” he ex-
claimed, “but why should I
be the mop 2"
Having knocked out “P.R.”
by a majority of 97 the House,
as a sop to the Lords, decided
to confine the Alternative Vote
to the Boroughs. The voting
was on strict party-lines, the
proposal being carried by 195 Liberal,
Labour and Nationalist Votes, to 194
Conservative. It was a great chance
for Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING to show
the importance of a really Independent
Member. But, alas! he was absent.
Wednesday, February 6th.--"Last
day, take it all in play,” as we used to
say at school. I suppose there was a
good deal of make-believe about the
vehement oratory heard in both Houses
on this the final day of the Session.
When Mr. BALFour heard Mr. CHAM-
BERLAIN fulminating against the Peers
(who had again inserted an attenuated
version of “P.R.” and again knocked
out the “A.V.”) for their audacity in
trying to tinker a Bill for the election of
the Commons he must have imagined
that he had somehow got back to 1884,
and that the voice was the voice of
Joseph, not AUSTEN. For the moment
it looked as if rather than allow the
Lords to insert even the thinnest end
of the wedge of “P.R.” the Commons
would sacrifice the Bill altogether and
refuse the franchise to eight million
people, three-fourths of them women.
[But are there really six million
women prepared to make statutory
declaration that they are over thirty?]
Some pleasant chaft by Mr. BALFour,
who had no idea that his right honour-
able friend and late colleague held such
strong views about the House of Lords,
and by Mr. Asquith, who only wished
he had had his eloquent assistance eight
years ago, brought the House to a more
businesslike mood. A final effort to

IT's a long step round by the Crucifix for a man with a
mighty load,
But there's hell to pay where the dead mule lies if you go
by the Bailleul road,
Where the great shells sport like an angry child with a
litter of broken bricks,
So we don't go down by the Dead-Mule Tree, but round by
the Crucific.
But the wild young men come bubbling out and look for
an early grave;
They light their pipes on the parapet edge and think
they're being brave;
They take no heed of the golden rules that the long, long
years have taught,
And they WILL go down by the Dead-Mule Tree when they
know that nobody ought.
And some of us old ones feel some days that life is a tiring
thing,
And we show our heads in the same place twice, we stand
in a trench and sing;
We lark about like a kid just out and shatter a hundred
rules,
But we never go down by the Dead-Mule Tree, we aren't
such perfect fools.
And the War goes on and the men go down, and, be he
young or old,
An English man with an English gun is worth his weight
And I hate to think of the fine young lads who laughed at
you and me— -
Who wouldn't go round by the Crucific but died at the
Dead-Mule Tree. A. P. H.
HIS FINAL ARROW.
(With apologies to Sir ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle and
“His Last Bow.”)
MY name is Potson, as all the world now knows. I am
only a poor doctor and suffer from the consequences of a
wound received in a border skirmish in Afghanistan many
years ago. It is not for any merits of my own that my
name has become celebrated, but because I have enjoyed
the friendship and the society of the most illustrious and
most detective man known to this or any other age. That
man, as every reader will have guessed, was Picklock Holes.
It was his custom, when engaged on one of those marvel-
lous feats of investigation which made Continents shudder
and Scotland Yard grow green with envy, to take me with
him, not so much to help him—I never aspired to that—
as to be the recipient of his confidences and the foil for his
humour. “Potson,” he would say to me, “you are not
clever; in fact, not to put too fine a point on it, you're a
fool; but if I want any one to tell me how many beans
make five you will do for the job as well as any other man.
Of course you ask silly questions, but they don't worry me
now and therefore I can endure you.”
“My dear Holes,” I used to murmur, “I love your
quaint harshness and could not do without it. Lead on and
wherever you go I'll follow.”

striking example of my wonderful friend's genius. Every-
one will remember the sensation that was caused a year
or two ago by the discovery that there was a shortage in
the accounts of the Food-CoNTROLLER of one lump of sugar
and three standardized bread-crumbs. All kinds of guesses
were hazarded to explain the deficiency and to discover the
culprit who was responsible for it, but none was successful.
It was thought at one time that German spies, whom this
country, by the way, has never sufficiently hated, were
responsible for the loss; but this supposition proved to be
untenable. At last the War Cabinet decided to call in the
assistance of Holes, and he, as usual, summoned me to his
side. Without a moment's delay I repaired to the Baker
Street room on which Holes had conferred the dignity of
his presence. I found him deep in calculations. Without
looking up or even responding to my greeting he continued
to cover sheets of paper with mysterious formulae until at
last he noticed that F. there.
“Potson,” he said, “we learn from the arithmetic books
that nine times twelve is a hundred and eight.”
“Are a hundred and eight,” I ventured to object.
“Brainless chatterer,” he hissed, “is this a time for
grammatical subtleties? Can you tell what this is?” and
he handed me a fragment of something green.
“It belongs,” I said, looking at it carefully, “to the
Vegetable kingdom.”
He gave me one of his piercing looks. “Any fool,” he
said, “could have told me that. Do you not see that it is
a strawberry leaf, and do you not remember that, accordin
to my Detective's Manual, a strawberry leaf is always a clue
of the first importance? Let us proceed. We will eliminate
g
the strawberry and the cream, because there is no cream to
be had, and the strawberry has already been eaten, and we
then find ourselves brought up against a ducal coronet.”
“Holes,” I said, “you are a perfect marvel.”
He waved me aside and continued: “Proceeding twice,
according to the well-known theory of “Next Things,' we
find that the next thing to a ducal coronet is a Duke, and
the next thing to a Duke is a Marquis. This leaf was found
in the back-garden. Therefore it was found outside. Now
fetch Who's Who, and look at this entry, “Outside, family
name of the Marquis of Bobstay.' Ah, Henry Brabazon
Beltravers, Marquis of Bobstay, I think we have got you
fixed at last, and shall bring your career of crime to a
close.” In a moment we had flung ourselves into a taxi,
and in about ten minutes we had arrived at the palatial
mansion of the Marquis of Bobstay. We found his Lord-
ship at home and were ushered into his library. He is a
stout man and evidently well fed. Holes grappled with
him at once, and after a short struggle produced from the
Marquis's breast-pocket a glistening lump of sugar. The
bread-crumbs were discovered in the ticket-pocket of his
Lordship's overcoat. On the following morning the
º man paid the penalty of his wickedness.

AT THE PLAY.
“NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH."
THE statement in an advertisement
column (reproduced from a critical judg-
ment) to the effect that the new farce
at the Savoy was “one BIG SCREAM,”
might have excused the gloomiest fore-
bodings. And at first they appeared
to be justified when Mr. PAUL ARTHUR,
as an American speculator, started with
an irritating smile (directed into open
space) long before anything funny had
been said. We had also to suffer a good
many preliminary platitudes on the
social necessity for telling lies. But as
soon as that delightful artist, Mr. A. E.
MATTHEws (in the part of Robert Ben-
nett), registered a bet of ten thousand
dollars that he would speak “nothing
but the truth” for four-and-twenty
hours, we knew that all was well. Only
to watch the eloquent spasms of his
knee-joints always gives me confidence.
Some of the embarrassments that
were bound to follow from his deadly
candour—as when he was forced to tell
a charming young lady that her hat was
“awful” and her singing “terrible"—
were easy enough to foresee; but there
was a touch of freshness about the
ironic satisfaction which he took in
exposing the frauds of his partner
Ralston—an exposure which in the
end cost that unscrupulous financier
a good deal more than his share of
the wager. For Bennett, in love with
his daughter, had undertaken to in-
vest the sum of ten thousand dollars
which she had raised for a charity and
turn it into twenty thousand, Ralston
having guaranteed to double any sum
that she collected from twenty thousand
dollars upwards; and the exposure of
his attempt to plant shares in a worth-
less quicksilver mine on some of his
friends determined a number of them
to subscribe heavily to the charity and
so get back on the guarantor.
I kept wanting to ask Mr. MATTHEws
why he did not run away and hide
himself till the twenty-four hours were
up; but the answer to this question, as
to so many other obvious ones that I
am often tempted to ask from my stall,
is that, if playwrights were as intel-
ligent as their audiences, there would
never be any plays at all.
Apart from the fun of things, our
sympathies were kept all the while at
high tension. Would Bennett hold out
to the end, even unto 4 P.M. 2. As the
curtain rose on the last Act the clock
was at 3.25. Thirty-five more minutes of
agony for him and for us! Happily Mr.

part as leader of the offensive. Mr.
MATTHEws, defending the beleaguered

For the first time in the history of English letters a
book has been written capable of inspiring me with a wish
to visit China. This epoch-making result followed upon
my perusal of The Wanderer on a Thousand Hills (LANE),
a story of the modern Orient so sympathetic and know-
ledgeable and showing such an insight into the life that it
describes, that I should place it well above any attempt
to translate China for Western minds that has previously
come to my notice. Miss EDITH WHERRY has, I believe, an
earlier tale of the same genre to her credit, which I appear
to have missed; this is certainly a misfortune that must not
occur again. The present plot—an English child found by a
mourning Chinese mother, brought up as her own son, win-
ning the greatest honours of learning in the Celestial Empire,
and then (inevitably for story purposes, but how I regretted
it!) learning the secret of his birth and giving up all to

Throughout, too, you will be fascinated by Miss WHERRY's

and he has contrived a book which, if it is not distinguished

112 PUNCH, OR THE L
ONDON CHARIVARI. [FEBRUARY 13, 1918.
Captain BRITTEN AUSTIN is one of the few writers of
war fiction whose perspective has not been spoiled by his
experiences. I do not mean to suggest that in Battlewrack
(HodDER AND STOUGHTON) he does not see war as it is.
That he does, and can depict it powerfully and even terribly,
such stories as “Verdun" and “Pro Patria” in the volume
before me sufficiently attest. But he never makes the
mistake of giving way to that atmosphere of sombre
realism with which most war-tales are so easily and so
naturally clothed, which adds so much to their value as
heroic literature, but takes away so much from their worth
as fiction. In romance, whatever its theme, if it is to perform
the common function allotted to this kind of light litera-
ture, not only must the incidents and the actors be largely
imaginary, but the whole must be informed with a spirit of
pleasurable adventure not always very notably apparent in
the real thing. In advancing this safe platitude I am far
from implying that fiction cannot find, in the monstrous
system of chemical annihilation that we call war to-day,
rather than a strictly historical account of a given period;
and it is natural enough that the writer should now and
again be tempted aside into fascinating digressions. So,
though she has invited her readers to Central America,
they have to play a rather irritating follow-my-leader to
China or Flanders or Finland as she chooses, and return—
sometimes along the track of almost identical phrases—to
the deeds and policies of her hero, the great President. Not
that the smoothness of her narrative suffers much, for
certainly there is little enough smoothness in the brutal
procession of recent Mexican politics, but it did seem at
times that the writer would have made better use of her
material had she been less willing to lecture for their good
various people all round the world—myself and President
WILsoN, for instance. Mrs. TweeDIE declares herself as,
first and most, an admirer of DIAz, and, secondly—with
reservations—a supporter of HUERTA, who might, she con-
tends, have pulled his country together but for the action
of the United States; while of course she is not slow to
something of the same
allure that it found when
war was a comparatively
bloodless, and picturesque
affair of battleaxes or bell-
mouthed blunderbusses. At
any rate we may hope that
Captain AUSTIN will con-
tinue to see things through
the romantic spectacles
which every good novelist
carries in his pocket, and
that his next sheaf of
stories will maintain the
excellence of his first.

from our seats and leaving the theatre for a breath of fresh
air.” By such silent protests he considers that managers
will understand that these performances are unpopular, and
will remove them from their programmes. This then is
Mr. LoNDON's purpose, and a sound one without any doubt.
Michael, in the hands of his beloved master, Dag Daughtry,
sails the high seas and performs tricks from sheer love of
life and his master. But Dag, the dearest of old villains, had
stolen Michael, and in turn his idol is stolen from him. Then
the painful incidents in Michael's career begin. He falls
into the hands of animal-trainers, who cannot find out the
wonderful trick he possesses, and treat him with abominable
cruelty. At last they discover it, and eventually he gets
back to a more friendly atmosphere. But his cheerful spirit
is crushed, and no soberer dog ever stepped the face of
the earth. The author's sincerity and skill make this tale
of Michael's tortures intensely moving. When Mr. JACK
LONDON died, animals lost a very true friend and the world
of letters a spirited writer. And never again can I watch
a performance of trained animals.
In her delightfully illustrated book, Mexico: From Diaz
to the Kaiser (HUTCHINson), Mrs. ALEC TweedIE gives us

she opens a telegram, addressed simply Trevor-Ward, to
find that it is for her brother, announcing the imminent
arrival of a lady who signs herself “Wife.” As nobody
had supposed him married (as a matter of fact he was
not), and as the lady, when met by Emily, turned out to
combine every manifestation of the socially impossible, you
will perceive that Mrs. HoRACE TREMLETT's latest story,
Emily Does Her Best (LANE), opens with a sufficiently
intriguing situation. I wish I could add that it continues
as well; but the fact is that, while the setting and the side
issues are bright to brilliancy, the main problem of the
relationship between Jack Trevor-Ward and Pipsy (the
deplorable name of his alleged spouse) remains both
obscure and, to my old-fashioned taste, not quite what one
expects from an apparently harmless comedy of light-
hearted adventure. But all the rest is capital fun. There
are some excellently vivid scenes of life in the Portuguese
town during the early months of the War, a sufficiency
of espionage, and one admirably arranged surprise for a
startling finish. Mrs. TREMLETT writes evidently of things
she has known and seen, and with an infectious gaiety of
style that I should have enjoyed whole-heartedly had not
the plot of her tale kept me always a little out of ease. But

a personal study made by the light of her own experiences
at least her freedom from convention is undeniable.

THE SIMPLER LIFE.
II.
- WILLIAM RUFUs.
William Rufus is our pig. Why we
called him that I do not know; he is
not red or even pink, but yellow. By
all the rules he should have been bacon
some time ago. Apart, however, from
the firm hold he has obtained on our
affections he is far too valuable an
animal to think of killing. One hears
sometimes of pigs being experts in
arithmetic or thought-reading or danc-
ing the minuet, but how many, I won-
der, even of those more gifted of their
kind, could catch a rabbit? Very few,
I venture to assert. William Rufus's
bag for the past three months has
averaged a steady five per week. How
does he do it? I will tell you.
At one end of the paddock where we
allow him to range with Spearmint,
our donkey, there is a bank riddled
with rabbit-holes. Worming his way
cautiously along the hedge to the mouth
of one of these, William Rufus lies flat
on the ground, tucks his legs beneath
him and buries his head under a tuft
of grass. As his skin is almost devoid
of hair these are all the preparations
necessary to complete his impersona-
tion of a giant vegetable marrow. Thus
he lies, absolutely motionless, the only
trace of the excitement under which he
labours being a slight extra tightening
of his tail into two rings instead of its
customary one. Presently a rabbit
pops out, pops back, pops out again
and has a good stare at the succulent-
looking object. At this point a third
ring usually appears at the end of
William Rufus's tail. -
Finally Bunny's mind is made up.
“Ha!” he says, and goes greedily for-
ward. “Ha!” replies William Rufus,
and grabs him by the neck. Then he
brings him to the back door, lays him
carefully on the mat and rejoins Spear-
mint. That is all. Simplicity itself, isn't
it? But genius lies in doing simple
things that no one else has thought of.
With mice he is equally successful.
In dealing with them he adopts the dis-
guise of a Stilton cheese, an effect pro-
duced by humping his back into a sort
of circle. He regards the mice as a
perquisite and keeps them for dessert.
- But it is not merely as a game-
trapper that William Rufus excels.
Besides keeping an eye on the children,
to prevent their running across the
paddock into the wood, he never fails
to open the gate for them and to close
it securely behind them when they go
for their daily drives with Spearmint;
and every evening at sunset he col-
lects our six fowls and directs them to
tomed to him in his rôle of general odd-
jobber that when he develops some
fresh activity, as he is constantly doing,
it passes now almost unnoticed Yet I
confess I was a little surprised when, a
morning or two ago, I discovered that
he had plaited the litter in his sty into
a really artistic straw mat.
In one respect William Rufus is indis-
pensable. Every Sunday morning, while
we are away at church, Elizabeth bakes
us what she calls a war-cake. Why
she does this we do not know ; what
she puts into it we have never dared to
ask. Every Sunday afternoon it is on
the tea table. We accept it, as we have
accepted Elizabeth herself, as one of
the horrors of war. But we never eat
it. As soon as the meal is over I stroll
casually out into a corner of the pad-
dock invisible from the kitchen window.
William Rufus is waiting for me there.
It seems more patriotic than burying
it, and apparently he does not mind
obliging me. Nor does his health
suffer; but I suppose a fellow who
can eat coal is proof against almost
anything.
SENTIMENT FOR THE HALLS.
THERE were three persons in the
room—a short fat man, who sat close
beside the piano holding a note-book and
a stubby pencil; a tall thin man, who
occupied the music-stool and occasion-
ally touched the keys of the instrument
tentatively, much as an engineer might
test the working of his machine before
letting her go; and a third man, both
fat and tall, who seemed to occupy the
position of general overseer. The three
had recently lunched, expensively, and
were now smoking very long cigars,
the smoke from which filled the room—
fumes, one might say, of an industry
working at full blast.
The little man with the note-book
had been writing in it for some minutes,
only pausing occasionally to moisten
the stubby pencil, which he contrived
to do rather cleverly without removing
his cigar.
“Now,” he said at last, “how about
this 2– -
“The thought of you will keep me true,
Though parted many a mile;
I want no prize but your sweet eyes,
No booty but your smile.”
The tall thin man stroked the piano,
and nodded approvingly. “Herrick at
his best,” he observed.
“Eric who?” snapped the big-both-
ways man. “Dunno his stuff; but
anyhow that sounds the goods. Play
it.”
On the instant the tall thin man be-
came amazingly animated. He played
it. Probably other tenants of the
fact, since, once heard, it is practically
impossible to forget it. That in this
they are still a matter of some few weeks
ahead of the rest of London may be a
consolation or may not.
“Yes,” repeated the large man
thoughtfully, “it sounds all No l’’
He became suddenly emphatic and ges-
ticulated with his cigar. “I knew
there was something wrong. It's that
“smile' at the end. Too weak alto-
gether. Lets the thing right down.
Can't you manage to get more punch
into it there?”
The poet nibbled his pencil. “Love
—heaven above–seas roll—soul,” he
murmured to himself in an experi-
mental undertone. All at once he
brightened visibly.
“Got it !” he cried. “Change the
second and last lines and the thing's
done :—
“The thought of you will keep me true,
Though seas we two may part.”
“ Us two,” murmured the tall thin
man, unheeded.
“I want no prize but your sweet eyes,
No booty but your heart.” -
“Pravo!” The overseer was moved
almost to enthusiasm. “That's an
A1 cert. anywhere. Nothing like a
good old hearty finish.” He chuckled
obesely at his own humour. “Play
it again, Charlie, and let's have the
twiddly-bits this time.”
So Charlie played it again, and the
twiddly-bits were duly introduced—
minor thirds and consecutive some-
thing - elses of a wistful and fatally
haunting pathos. And once again the
voice of the expert was lifted on a note of
justifiable satisfaction. “If you ask me,
boys,” he said, “we’re on a winner.”
That was some days ago. Soon, in
any one of a dozen theatres, a sudden
darkness will fall upon the crowded
house, and rows on rows of second-
lieutenants, clasping each the hand o'
an adjacent flapper, will thrill to that
adhesive melody, and, as the lyrics
reach at length their cardiac climax, will
murmur, a little awestruck as at some
miracle of wonder,
“Whoever wrote that might have
known us.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE EVIL EYE: A TRAGEDY.
“Look at that blinkin' bird, Sir,”
said the Mess-cart driver.
The magpie sat on the head of the
horse and regarded the world with a
jaundiced eye, as one who has drunk
deep of the cup of life and finds the
dregs distasteful.
I approached, wishing to exchange
greetings with him, but the bird fixed
me with such a baleful glare that I
faltered in my stride and hesitated.
At that moment the Mess-cart horse,
angered by a fly on his nose, flung up
his head, and with a bitter curse the
magpie dived into the depths of the
Mess-cart and was hidden from view.
Some weeks before, while we were en-
from an enormous appetite, and, reck-
less of dyspepsia, would seek out and
devour the most unusual articles to
satisfy his craving. Thus on one occa-
sion he appeared at the window of the
Headquarters Mess during breakfast,
and before the astonished and bulging
eyes of the Colonel removed from his
plate a sausage of noble proportions
and made his exit unmolested.
At the same time he showed him-
self to be an ardent collector of trifles
of any and every kind, and frequently
caused severe heart-burnings by his
habit of collecting some small article
that took his fancy, and which was, on
more than one occasion, its owner's
most cherished possession. For in-
stance, one day he was observed to
gaged in one of our periodical attempts cross the transport lines with unsteady
to cross France on foot, the magpie
gait, bearing with an air of unctuous
casting evil glances around him, and
by the wicked and sardonic glare in his
eye causing the inhabitants of several
villages through which we passed to
hurry indoors, crossing themselves.
Arrived at our destination, he re-
sumed his old mode of life, established
a new “cache,” levied a toll on every
house in the village, and appeared
thoroughly to revel in his depraved
and debauched existence; till one day
a distinguished General, at a parade of
the entire Brigade, informed an inter-
ested audience that we had been chosen
to return to that very spot from which
we had come, and, giants refreshed, to
throw ourselves anew into the fray.
'Rastus, who had attended the parade
in the pocket of the R.A.M.C. Corporal,
was observed to appear slightly de-
pressed as we left the field, but in the
where in particular and
attached himself firmly,
but without ostenta-
tion, to the transport.
At one moment there
was the transport and
no magpie, and the next
there was the transport
and the magpie. Like
that.
The men took to him
at once, though some-
what awed by his pon-
tifical appearance and
his remarkably evil eye.
He was christened'Ras-
tus for no reason in
particular, and deve-
loped a fondness for
riding in the Mess-cart,

“'ELLO, 'ERBERT, GOT A JoB, OR ARE YER FOOD 'UNTIN'?"
upheaval caused by
the General's words I
thought no further of it
until that afternoon I
was informed that the
Mess-cart driver wished
to speak to me.
“It's that bird, Sir,”
he said; “'e's com-
mitted suicide.”
As he obviously
wished me to accom-
pany him to the scene
of the tragedy I fell into
step beside him and
asked for the dreadful
details. It appeared
that 'Rastus had been
seen to walk across the
transport lines, wearing
an air of settled melan-
slightly to the embar-1
rassment of the Mess-cart driver, for,
as the latter pointed out to me, “Does
what 'e likes, 'e does, Sir. I can't argue
with 'im. Fair mesmerizes me, 'e does,
with that eye of 'is.”
So 'Rastus settled down and became
a notorious member of our flock, and
his fame was noised abroad throughout
the whole Division. And it was felt
that, could he but speak, it would be
well worth the while of even such a
hardened reprobate as the Mess-cart
driver to listen to him. Indeed the
transport Sergeant himself, hitherto a
confirmed sceptic in such matters, ap-
proached me soon after the bird's arrival
in a fruitless endeavour to negotiate
the loan of a silver sixpence wherewith
to slit the tongue of the bird in order
that his speech might be loosened.
It soon became evident that the mag-
pie was not bound by any stringent
rules of morality, but was possessed of
a deep cunning and an abiding lawless-
ness that would not have shamed one
pride a scarlet carpet-slipper, one of a
pair belonging to the Adjutant, tried
veterans that had weathered the first
battle of Ypres. The hue and cry aris-
ing from this particular outrage re-
sulted in the discovery of the criminal's
“cache,” a battered and rusty biscuit-
tin, lying beneath the bunk of the
unsuspecting transport Sergeant, and
containing, in addition to the carpet-
slipper, a comb, the property of his
ally the Mess-cart driver, three handker-
chiefs of various hues, one tooth-brush
of great age, a number of nails, several
repellent pieces of food in an advanced
stage of decadence, and a recent copy
of Battalion Orders.
So matters stood when the battalion,
covered with mud and glory, was re-
moved from the line for a short rest.
'Rastus appeared to share in the general
rejoicing and wore an air of conscious
rectitude and intelligent anticipation
that was more than human. On the
march to our new home he rode pomp-
- choly and disappear
behind the cook-house. Later in the

FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENTS.
Two moments of financial embarrass-
ment have recently been mine.
One occurred about a fortnight ago
in the Strand (where they are said to
be very common), and I blame no one
but myself. But then I go on my
blundering way through life blaming
no one but myself. It happened that I
wanted an evening paper, and, seeing
ahead of me a ragged but far from
unhappy-looking boy with a number
of Stars, I decided to place my order
with him.
There was something about him so
characteristic of the London street—
he had so much of the recklessness of
our young adventurers—that, under a
generous impulse, as I handed him a
penny, Isaid, “Never mind the change,”
accompanying the remark, no doubt,
with an expression appropriate to such
benevolence. His own expression how-
ever was very different, having in it
elements of incredulity and scorn.
Holding the penny in his hand, he
maintained an odd but distinctly cen-
There being nothing so trying to the
pure philanthropist as to have his pure
philanthropy unacknowledged, I said
sharply, “You might say “Thank you'
for it, anyway.”
“Thank yourself,” he replied. “Wot
is there for me to thank you for 2 The
Star's a penny, ain't it?”
And it was. The price had just been
raised and I had not heard of it.
I walked on, looking far bigger than
I felt.
My other experience was in one of
London's Town Halls, where I was
engaged on that most pathetic of enter-
prises, the pursuit of a Food Card.
After inquiring of many well-informed
people I was ultimately directed to
this abode of civic consultation, and
there met with a stranger who turned
out to be the friend of my life—the
hall porter. Not only did he instruct
me in the whole mystery, but he him-
self fetched one of the forms which I
should long ago have filled up, and
supplied pen and ink and blotting-
paper, and then proposed that he should
hand it in and save me the trouble of
While he was thus talking my fingers
in my pocket were busy stealthily identi-
fying among the coins a sixpence with
which to reward him, when he startled
me by remarking, “Oh, no; there's no
need to give me a shilling. It's all in
my day's work.”
I have used the word “startled,” but
it must not be thought, even although
a tide of hot blood rushed through me
as I realised how narrow had been
my escape, that I showed any sign of
discomposure. On the contrary, for it
is wonderful how rapid our muscular
reactions can be and how swiftly we
can readjust ourselves to new con-
|ditions, my fingers instantly, even as
he spoke, relinquished the sixpence and
found a shilling, and this I presented
to him quite as though there had been
|no interruption of intent. But it was
a narrow shave.

George. Pray, Mamma, was the
famous Raffles one of these “pro-
fiteers ” 2 I think he must lave lived
about the time you are speaking of.
Mrs. M. No, my dear boy, his time
was over before the reign we have been
discussing. He is said to have been a
man of good birth and position, and to
have squandered his patrimony. He
then became, if I may use such a phrase,
a sort of gentleman robber, and pacified
his conscience by robbing only the rich.
But his fame is more traceable to the
play made about him than to any of
his own good or bad deeds.
Ičichard. Is it true that everybody
used to smoke in those unsettled times?
Mrs. M. Smoking was then a uni-
versal practice. In earlier times men
of fashion affected cigars or long rolls
of leaf tobacco, but were seldom to be
seen with them in public places. But
in this reign all ages and both sexes
engaged in a public and promiscuous use
of the cigarette, a small paper cylinder
filled with cut tobacco, often, I regret
to say, mixed with other deleterious
ingredients. Lady Babbleton, in her
Memoirs, speaks without shame of her
daily consumption of fifty cigarettes.
The embargo formerly laid on smoking
in places of business was removed, and
even small boys were seen puffing at
these noxious cigarettes at all hours of
the day. The cult of the tobacco-pipe,
which had previously been regarded as
a vulgar and unrefined mode of smok-
ing, attained extravagant dimensions.
The ſashionable pipe-makers rose to a
position of fabulous wealth and import-
ance. Their shops were fitted up with
a sumptuous and semi-sultanic extrava-
gance; young men and women of the
highest birth and the most polished
manners were retained as assistants
at very high salaries, and the power
and influence wielded by the heads of
these firms was so great that one of
them was appointed Chief of the Staff
as the result of a movement initiated
by the leading paper, and another was
appointed Archbishop of Canterbury,
though he was not ordained until after
his elevation. .
Mary. What a droll idea! I cannot
imagine you, Mamma, smoking a pipe.
Mrs. M. I hope not, my dear, though
my grandmother was given several
pipes amongst her wedding presents,
one of which I believe cost fifty pounds.
The craze ultimately reached such pro-
portions as to call for legislative inter-
ference. It began with the Act for-
bidding the use of cigarettes by all
it was impossible to expect the young
to abstain unless their elders set them
a better example. Unfortunately this
method did not answer, and the age
limit was reduced in successive Acts
until, by the prohibition of infantile
smoking and the conscription of pipes,
smoking was finally stamped out.
Richard. I do not think anything
entertains me more than hearing about
these old customs. Pray tell us some-
thing about the books which they used
to read in these days.
Mrs. M. At this period perhaps the
most remarkable feature of literature
was the reverence paid to young writers.
I remember my grandfather telling me
that he made quite a hit by a novel
which he published while still at a
preparatory school, but that by the
time he went up to Oxford his vogue
had entirely ceased, and he resigned
the career of letters for that of scientific
agriculture. Nearly all the most popu-
lar books of the time were written by
authors who were still in their teens,
and those who had the misfortune to
be over twenty were driven to falsifying
their birth certificates in order to satisfy
the requirements of publishers. Most
of the famous books of this period took
the form of onslaughts on established
institutions. Marriage was impeached
in the nursery, the revival of child-
bishops was advocated from the per-
ambulator, and the tyranny and bru-
tality of the Public School system was
held up to execration by members of
the Lower Fourth Form. It was, in
the cant phrase of the time, the era
of the boom of youth, of the assertion
of the right of unrestrained self-ex-
pression. It was triumphantly shown
that age had no monopoly of wicked:
ness and vice, and that in varied and
vivid profanity the vocabulary of youth
stood supreme.

At his employer swore,
And so did Thomas Jenkins
And half a million more ;
They swore at their employers,
They swore to go on strike,
With one accord their tools to down,
Because the bread was much too brown,
And bade their friends in London town
To come and do the like.
Then forth from Nelson Circus,
Queen's Cross and Charing Bar,
From Londonpool and Liverbridge,
And the Hill of Trafalgar,
In all their countless myriads
Poured the swiſt hurrying feet;
Through Piccadilly Place they ran,
A pair of feet to every man,
And met in Oxford Street.
In Regent Square the windows
Were battered sash by sash,
And the tall towers of SELFRIDGE's
Fell with a sickening crash;
Thy roofs, O princely MAPPIN,
Lost every single slate,
And Swan and Snelgrove, Limited,
Then up rose England's Premier,
And rode with all his might
To call the Scots from Sheper Bush,
To call them to the fight.
“Sir Scots,” quoth he, “come forth
with me,
Ride at your fullest speed,
And spifflicate our civic foe,
Who thus would strike a caitiff blow
In time of England's need.”
The Scots with their shillalas
From Sheper Bush they came,
And from the National allery
The Irish did the same;
From Buckingham's proud Palace,
The Abbey and the Mint,
What troops soe'er were quartered
there, -
They also took the hint.
They struck those caitiff strikers,
They fought them might and main,
Till all of them were wounded -
And most of them were slain ;
The rest they put in prison—
Old Bailey or the Fleet,
For that they served their private
greed
In this the hour of England's need,
And ruined Oxford Street.
When the Pilsener is opened
And the IRauchtabak is lit,
And the sausage glows on the embers
And the Jungfrau gloats on it,
With “Hoch" and “Hic” and “Him-

Still is the story told

All red with blood the roaring spate
Of Revolution rolled.

HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED WALENTINE SENT TO MR. BONAR LAW LAST WEEK.
Tuesday, February 12th-Some ma-
licious sprite—probably a species of
printer's devil—took occasion of the
opening of the eighth Session of this
painfully protracted Parliament to play
his Puckish pranks. First he so mal-
treated the Speech from the Throne
that when His MAJESTY came to read
it there was no trace of its most import-
ant passage—the summons to repre-
sentatives of the Dominions and the
Indian Empire to take part in the
deliberations of the War Cabinet.
Next he turned his attention to the
Mover of the Address in the House of
Commons. For the most part General
LowthER's maiden speech was an ex-
cellent blend of humour and common-
sense, fully deserving the encomiums
bestowed upon it by the Front Bench.
But just once the imp of malapropin-
quity managed to trip him up and made
him speak of our “unfounded”—instead
of “unbounded "-admiration for the
Navy and the Merchant Service.
The ensuing debate degenerated into
a series of personal attacks upon the
PRIME MINISTER by Members who, not
without high example, regard this as
the easiest road to fame. The only
late themselves on the discussion are
the Members of the German General
Staff, who may not have learned any-
thing that they did not know before, but
have undoubtedly had certain shrewd
suspicions confirmed.
Wednesday, February 13th-There
was a distinct drop in the temperature
of the House. This may have been
partly due to the absence of the PRIME
MINISTER, whose incandescence is apt
to be catching; but chiefly, one hopes,
to the consciousness that yesterday's
scenes had not done much to help the
country's cause. No disturbance of
the new mood came from Mr. HERBERT
SAMUEL, who is emphatically not a fire-
brand, but a coldly-calculating critic.
In a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger style
he contrasted the comparatively meagre
performances of the Administration with
the perfervid prognostications of its
ebullient Chief.
Of all the Ministers Mr. PROTHERO
alone came in for a word of praise—not
entirely, I trust, in order that Mr.
SAMUEL might fire off his one and only
joke about Sir ALFRED MoRD sowing
his wild oats in Richmond Park.
Mr. BoNAR LAw, accepting a chal-

BELIEVED LOST IN THE POST.
refrained from issuing, declared that
his speech amounted to a condemna-
tion of the Government, and that if the
House of Commons agreed with Mr.
SAMUEL it was its duty to find another.
Then in one of his engaging bursts of
self-revelation he observed, “I have no
more interest in this PRIME Man ISTER
than I had in the last.”
The House generally seemed to
agree with Mr. ADAMSoN, who, before
changing horses again, wanted to be
sure that he was going to get a better
team. At the end of a statesmanlike
speech the Labour Leader declared the
comforting conviction that the over-
whelming majority of people, while de-
siring an end to the War, were opposed
to peace-at-any-price.
This declaration, coming from so un-
impeachable a source, should have given
pause to Mr. HoLT and the little knot
of Pacifists below the Gangway. But
they persisted in pressing their Amend-
ment in favour of entering upon immedi-
ate negotiations with the enemy; and,
though receiving some unexpected sup-
port from Lord HENRY BENTINCR and
Colonel AUBREY HERBERT, both of
whom seemed for the moment to be

Pressmen at home than of Prussians
abroad, they were beaten out of sight
when it came to the division.
The falling away of the Opposition
was in some measure due to a con-
ciliatory speech from Lord Robert
CECIL, who incidentally remarked that
he had himself prepared a scheme for a
League of Nations, but begged not to be
cross examined about it. Lord RoberT
had fortified himself with a gigantic |
file of The Times, but no special signi
ficance is attached to this precaution
Thursday, February 14th.-This being
the first day for Questions, Members had
prepared a formidable catechism, com-
prising 134 items. Mr. PENNEFATHER,
who desired to know what Germans
meant by “the freedom of the seas,"
was referred by Lord Robert CECIL to
the definition by Count REVENTLow,
who regards it as synonymous with
the possession by Germany of the coast
of Belgium and Northern France; but
some Members appeared to consider
that in quoting the Count as an auth-
oritative exponent of the German mind
the Foreign Office might be laying up
trouble for itself. Would Britons like
to be identified with the utterances of
some of our own fire-eating publicists?
If Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING is to be
trusted, ex-King CoNSTANTINE still gets
his wardrobe from London. “Any-
thing in reason, WILLIAM," he is re-
ported to have said to his Imperial
brother-in-law, “but I draw the line at
Berlin-cut trousers.” There is reason
to believe, however, that wherever TINo
procures the garments in question it is
Sophie who wears them.
The House discussed food with much
gusto, and Lord RHONDDA, sitting in
the Peers' Gallery, was the typical list-
ener who hears little good of himself.
He smiled when someone alluded to
that Food-Controller of Ancient Rome
who began by setting up his own statue
and ended by decapitation. A “bust”
of any kind is totally foreign to his pre-
sent aspirations. -
ANOTHER DENIAL.
“HAvE you heard,” said to me a
man with a strong sense of rumour,
“that most of the animals in the Zoo
have been killed, to save food?”
“Not really?" I replied.
“Absolutely,” said he.
In case this statement has reached
other ears I wish to put it on record
that I, a truthful person, visited the
Zoo a few days ago in order to see for
myself. And my report, made before a
Commissioner of Oaths and signed and

|ARTHUR PINERO, doyen of dramatists,
straining after the grotesque and plant-

have been mid-Victorian.
By an incredibly far-sought artifice,
which I haven't the patience to report,
he introduces a company of travelling
freaks to the hospitality of a large
suburban villa. They consist of a giant,
a brace of midgets, a living skeleton
and a girl who can tie herself into knots
L(but never does). Now I have nothing
against freaks as freaks; they are
among the accidents of nature that
claim our pity; and though I should pre-
fer them not to exploit their physical
deformities in public I know they may
be driven to this painful course by
necessity, and in any case are no worse
than those who do the same thing with
their physical charms. But happily I

of an itinerant circus. When, however,
Sir ARTHUR PINERo pushes them at me
on the stage, then I'm done.
For an “Idyll” (the play is so de-
scribed in the programme) it was a
rather ugly spectacle, not sufficiently
excused by the author's anxiety to ex-
plain to us that even a freak may be
human ; may actually entertain senti-
ments of loyalty and self-sacrifice. But
did anyone doubt it? I was reminded
of those revelations of the intimate life
of exceptional people from which we are
supposed to learn with surprise that
a famous actor is fond of snowdrops,
or that a distinguished warrior is decent
to his dog. The concern which the
other freaks felt about the health of the
sick giant (though I could not share it,
having had so little of his acquaintance)
was the most natural thing in the world.
All the same, since my eyes are more
sensitive than my moral vision, these
marks of spiritual beauty did not
console me for the sight of so much
physical ugliness. I could have borne
it far better in a book.
Not that the freaks were all repellent.

CowIE, who never looked like tying her-
self into a knot, can't help being attrac-
tive; and the giant was just a harm-
less figure out of pantomime. But the
three-foot-six midgets were pure-freaks.
For some reason not confided to us they
had also a touch of the automaton
about them ; the gentleman midget was
most uncertain on his feet and both of
them had to be hoisted into their chairs.
I assume that they were children dis-
guised, and it was a very natural error
of judgment by which the young
daughter of their hostess, in a spasm
of almost maternal tenderness, lifted
the male, aged forty-one, on to her lap.
She was rebuked by the lady midget,
who protested in a rich American ac-
cent, “I will tha-ank you to put my
husband down.”
It was not easy to see how we were
to get any love interest out of the
scheme; yet Sir ARTHUR contrived,
with perfect seriousness, to make the
boy of the house (played very naturally
by Mr. LESLIE HowARD) fall in love
with the girl freak, despite her habit of
speech, half cockney, half nigger; and

“No, I am under no such delusion. I am not yet on

I have a nodding acquaintance with it.”
“Tell me,” I said, “how many coupons are there in a
sirloin of beef ?”
“If you will put the sirloin on your writing-table I will
endeavour to weigh it with my mind's eye; but of course
you will first have to get the sirloin.”
“Is the sirloin like a rabbit, then 2" -
“What do you mean? I never noticed a resemblance.”
“Oh, don't you know?” I said. “Rabbits were men-
tioned at an earlier stage of these proceedings, and they
became so bashful that they all disappeared and haven't
been seen or heard of since.” -
“Well,” she said, “if you put it in that way sirloins are
like rabbits, and so are legs of mutton and ribs of beef and
sugar and butter and lots of other things. As soon as you
mention them they retire, and to all intents and purposes
cease to exist. However, it's a great comfort to know that
the German ration is only half that of the Londoner.”
“Yes, that's a great score, and I've no doubt that the
German rabbits have disappeared as completely as ours.”
“Of course they have. Only a pacifist would attempt to
deny it.” * - . . . -

“No,” I said, “but it will. It is sure to spread from

up and discover that somebody has issued a decree as a
result of which our innocent village is under the coupon
system, and then we shall regret too late that we have
made no preparations for it. Come,” I said, “expound it
to me with your usual force and brevity.”
“Well, it's something like this.
Everybody has got to
get a card with so many coupons attached to it.” .
“So many ? Can you not give me the exact number 2"
“No, that's just what I can't do. Let's call it four.”
“It doesn't matter,” I said, “what we call it. It's what
Lord RHONDDA calls it that matters.” . . . . . . .
“Well, let us imagine that Lord RHoNDDA calls it four.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It was of course inevitable that the humours—the surface
humours—of a W.A.D. hospital should before long provide
material for a book. Indeed, I pleasantly recall that the
thing has been done already, from the patient's point of
view; and now here is Mr. Robert ERsTone Forbes giving
us the official aspect in Mrs. Holmes, Commandant (ARNOLD).
Having just devoured every word of it, practically at a
sitting, I can testify to its entire and delightful success.
From the moment when that wonderful lady, Mrs. Holmes
(whom I thought, mistakenly, that I was going to dislike),
sets out to bully a hospital out of the indolent inhabitants
of Fairbridge, through all the bustle of preparation and the
months of active work, to the quite charming climax, you
will find your attention held, as mine was, with tenderness
and laughter. Perhaps the best achievement of Mr. Forbes
is that his people—the commandant herself, the staff, the
teller of the tale, and the varied procession of patients—all
live individually and most convincingly. Moreover (and I
am not sure that this isn't even a greater exploit still)
through obvious dangers he carries his theme breast-high
above even a suspicion of sentimentality. The best chapter,
to my mind, is that which tells of “The Romantic Career
of Lance-Corporal Rainey;” in this especially the facile
sigh could have been cheaply bought; but it is to Mr.
For BEs's credit that Rainey marches out of the hospital,
every man and woman in which he has reduced to helpless
adoration, as human and unidealized a figure as when he
entered it caked with the mud of Flanders. Briefly, my pre-
sent trouble is that there are some fifty odd hospitallers to
whom I wish immediately to lend my copy of Mrs. Holmes,
publishers need be under no apprehension. I shall do
nothing so unfair—or so altruistic.
The heroine in the Baroness von HUTTEN's Bag of
Saffron (HUTCHINsoN) is in effect a study of the perfect
little beast. Not that Cuckoo hasn't her good points, but
her conduct to her husband, whom she deserts in his sick-
ness and poverty for that Magnificent Old Rake, Sir
Peregrine Janeways, pushes beyond credible limits of
callousness. Duly divorced, remarried, richly gowned and
begemmed by the flamboyant baronet, she finds that her
ex-husband is dying of consumpton. Peregrine, asked for
a thousand pounds to save his predecessor, suggests that
his latest present, a pear-shaped ruby, is worth about that
and may be sold for this kindly purpose. Finding that
Cuckoo, confronted with a choice between her discarded
George's life and the ruby, is all for the ruby, he begins to
wonder whether she can be quite a nice girl. But this
was a hasty judgment. For, learning that her George was
really dying in a pool of blood (but still saveable by money
apparently), she nobly surrenders the jewel. And then Sir
Peregrine shows himself an—an optimist. He hangs round
his complex Cuckoo's neck the Bag of Saffron, which (like
the V.C.) is a little bauble of no intrinsic value but has a
chain of diamonds attached. It is given by a Janeways to
none but a really peerless wife (Peregrine's two first were
merely so-so). From which you will gather that the fond
author doesn't share my view of Cuckoo. But, at any rate,
she will admit that her creations are no ordinary mortals,
and I in turn will handsomely allow that here is an
extremely entertaining and romantic volume.

backwards with regret rather than forwards with anticipa-
tion, the Right Hon. G. W. E. Russell's Politics and Person-
alities (UNWIN) will make its strongest appeal. And even
the younger generation, though it may mildly resent the
author's designating as “politics” those dead issues which
have long since been relegated to the glass-cases of the
Political Natural History Museum, will find food for reflec-
tion in his detached and philosophical if somewhat archaic
views. Mr. RUSSELL is at pains to tell us that, like his
distinguished ancestors, he is a Whig ; but it is difficult to
be really enthusiastic over such political cadavers as the
Hawarden Kite, Cobdenism, Dynastic Succession, Aristo-
cracy, etc., dissected according to the formulas of 1884. In
other chapters we find the author struggling rather pathet-
ically to fit Armageddon into a middle-Victorian microcosm
under the title, “Ideals and the War,” the ideals being
those of the Athenæum Club in the eighties, and the War
being the same little disturbance that has made Mr. H. G.
WELLs's Republicanism sound like an essay on the divine
right of kings. It is in T. UNI - - - -

land that lies midway
between history and

RUSSELL is most com-

longs to the “silent strong” type beloved by certain lady-
novelists. He is all right in the matter of silence, but is
neither so strong nor so attractive as he was meant to be.
Boy Woodburn, the heroine of the story, was the daughter
of a delightfully astute horse-trainer and a puritanical
mother. Bred from such stock she was naturally some-
thing of a hybrid; but whether she was grooming horses or
riding them, or superintending a Sunday Bible class for
stable-boys, I believed in her all the time. Her father too
is admirably drawn, and though the pictures of life in
a racing stable convey the impression that it is a rogue's
game, I am not prepared to say that their colour is too
thickly laid on. But Jim Silver, who easily checkmated
the arch-villain of the piece times and again, left me stone-
cold. However he really does not matter much, and only
seemed to be there because a novel must have a hero of
some kind. Where Mr. OLLIVANT shows at his best is in
his descriptions of the Sussex Downs and in his sympathy
with animals. And his account of a very sensational Grand
National stirs the
pulses, although one
knows that Boy's horse
is simply bound to
win. Even that best
seller, Mr. NAT Gou LD,
might be jealous of
such a sequence of
thrilling incidents.

things he saw during the big push of 1916; and this
narrative has since been offered to the world at large under
the title A Subaltern's Letters from the Somme (CLowes).
I confess he worried me a little when he began, in notes
beneath his first few pages, patiently telling me what is
the weighty significance of such symbols as “N.C.O.”
and “C.B.,” but before long we were very good friends.
As they were received one by one at a time when news was
scant, these letters must have been of absorbing interest;
but Mr. HAWKs would be the first to admit that by now
one would be hardly justified in claiming much novelty for
them in the eyes of a public pretty well informed on such
matters as “billets" and “brass-hats" and “kite-balloons.”
All the same there is a touch of intimacy about the volume
that some of our more ambitious war-books have lacked.
Moreover the writer has the good taste to place some verses
from Punch on his first page. With this modest recom-
mendation one may leave it.
There is plenty of good work in Mr. ALFRED OLLIVANT's
Boy Woodburn (JENRINs), but coming from the author of
merciless intimacy of a double bedroom at an economical
private hotel. Told drily, but with understanding and a
half-cynical pity, it is a picture of woman's inhumanity to
woman that only one of the same gentler sex could have
written. So much for “The Separate Room”; the rest of
the stories—with one exception—are more comfortable, if
less artistic. What point there exists in the not-specially
apt title is furnished presumably by the “room " headings
of the various sketches, as “Four Ballrooms,” “Three
Rooms,” etc. Candour constrains me to say that most of
Miss MAYNE's rooms contain nothing peculiarly worth the
trouble of entering for. Perhaps the silliest is that which
shows an unfortunate doctor-lover confronted with the
prospect of having to give gas to the one woman, Experi-
ence teaches him that she will look far from her best under
the ministrations of the tooth-extractor. This seems quite
seriously meant. If Miss MAYNE really supposes anaes-
thetists to be of this fatuous kind, I can only sympathise
with her in an experience clearly less fortunate than my own.

THE WISE AND FOOLISH VIRGINS.
I KNEw a Virgin passing Wise;
No one could call her dissipated;
Never her course was known to drift
From those high principles of thrift
With which, in case of rainy skies,
IIer brain had been inoculated.
She husbanded her frugal store; ,
Her lamp with oil was well provided ;
So were her tins of sprat-sardines—
Not stocked in view of submarines,
But garnered prior to the War
Against whatever chance betided.
I knew a Foolish Virgin, too,
With habits nothing like so proper;
Her lamp was woolly round the wick;
She lived from hand to mouth on tick;
Her ready cash she always blew,
And never saved a single copper.
- From letting things serenely go
No fear of stringent times debarred her;
If but to-day supplied good fare
The morrow for itself might care,
And consequently there were no
Sardines collected in her larder.
Which was the better Virgin? She
Who made of life a game of skittles,
Reckless of Want that follows Waste ;
Or she who resolutely faced
The problems of econom
And practised Virtue with her victuals?
Alas! the latter Virgin's found
Inferior in the moral order;
Her dozen tins of sprat-Sardines
Have been a source of painful scenes,
And RHONDDA's fined her fifty pound
As a confirmed and shameless hoarder.

#inancy there was little to mark it as of different clay
from the common run of bears. Even Joan Minor at the
first introduction, preoccupied with scientific research as
to the nature and arrangement of her own toes, remained
unimpressed. But gradually, as acquaintance ripened into
friendship and friendship into love, we who were privileged
to be its intimates recognised that here was indeed one born
to greatness. It was not so much its moral character,
though the faults were always those of a great and generous
soul; it was rather the self-reliance and quiet dignity that
shone undimmed through every adversity and survived even
the impertinent assaults of the kitten.
But the day of parting came. Uncle Gerald was sent to
France and Teddy was sent with him to comfort him and
bring him back safe, a trust which so far he has most
faithfully performed. He has also found time to arrange
for Uncle Gerald's advancement from a mere private to the
rank of captain, and about a year ago secured him a
transfer to the R.F.C., followed by a heavenly period of
home-training, during which Joan Minor spent several
in becoming proficient pilots; and now Uncle Gerald's
last letter brings news of Teddy's crowning achievement.
DEAR PUDGE,-You will be glad to hear that Adam Zad
has been just splendid. I told you that I had tied him on
to my aeroplane right in front, where he can see every-
thing. I had to tie him very tight because I was afraid he
would try to jump at the German fliers, and if he had
slipped he would have had a terrible fall and I might not
have been able to find him, again. Besides I don't think
Germans would be nice for him to eat. Do you?
Well, the other day he and I were flying all alone, when
suddenly a lot of Germans came swooping down out of
nowhere. He shouted to me that they were coming, and I
tried to shoot them with my gun, which is just behind
where he sits; but something went wrong with the gun
and it wouldn't shoot. The Germans were all round us,
and we had to dive to get away from them as we couldn't
shoot them. We went very fast, ever so much faster even
than you and Adam Zad used to run when you were at
home together, and when we stopped I noticed that he
wasn't in his place. He had broken his string and was
clinging on to the gun.
As soon as I had time I leaned forward and caught
hold of him to put him in the seat beside me, as he
didn't look very safe where he was. One of his legs was
wedged tight in the gun and it tore a little as I pulled him
away, but it is nearly well now. And then when I tried
the gun again I found he had been putting it right. Wasn't
that clever of him, Pudge? Aſter that, of course, we went
back and shot at the Germans and killed two and drove
the rest away and came home to tea.
And now they are going to give him a ribbon and we shall
be able to cover up the place on his chest where the kitten
scratched him. It's quite a nice ribbon with two white
stripes and a violet one in the middle. I was very sorry to
hear about Belinda's nose. I told you it wasn't good for
her to sit too near the fire.
Your loving Uncle, GERALD.
That is the plain unvarnished account of the affair by an
eye-witness. Imagine our astonishment when we read this
official perversion:—
“Awarded the Military Cross.-Captain Gerald T.
Smith, Royal Loamshire Regt., att. R.F.C., for great gal-
lantry and presence of mind. While flying alone over
enemy ground Captain Smith was attacked by a formation
of at least six hostile machines of the Albatross type.
During the encounter Captain Smith's gun jammed. He
then descended to a lower altitude and coolly corrected the
fault under intense enemy fire. Resuming the engagement
he brought down two of the enemy aircraft and dispersed
the remainder in flight.”
Not a word, you see, about Teddy; and now we are
wondering whether the stupid people will arrest him for
wearing a military decoration without authority.

but the supplies in one shop are greater than the supplies

get more meat than those in the other queue, which is
ecstatic week-ends at the town where they were engaged

WHEN I was young I was extremely
handsome. I have documentary evi-
dence to prove as much. There is in
existence a photograph of a young
gentleman standing with his back to
a raging seascape, one hand resting
lightly on a volume of SHAKSPEARE,
which in turn is supported by a rustic
table. The young gentleman has wide
innocent eyes, a rosebud mouth and
long golden curls (the sort poor dear
old RoMNEY used to do so nicely). For
the rest he is tastefully upholstered in
a short-panted velvet suit, a lace collar
and white silk socks. “Little Lord

I went, and was admitted by a hand-

towards a selection of doors, murmur-
ing, “Wait there, please.” I opened
the nearest door at a venture and
entered.
In the waiting-room three other
handmaids were at work on photo-
graphs. One was painting dimples on
a lady's cheek; one filling in gaps in a
Second-Lieutenant's moustache; one
straightening the salient of a stock-
broker's waistcoat. Presently the first

curtly (I was waiting in the wrong

with the clamp, but it clave like a
bull-terrier to a mutton chop. In a
moment he had me by the head and
started to mould it nearer to his heart's
desire with plump powerful hands.
He crammed half my lower jaw into
my breast pocket, pinned my ears back
so tightly that they wouldn't wag for
weeks, pressed my nose down with his
thumb as though it were the button of
an electric bell and generally kneaded
my features from the early Hibernian
to the late Graeco-Roman. Then, before
they could rebound to their normal
positions, he had sprung back, jerked
the lanyard and fired the camera.

Don't want to have to undress in the

that I did not—not before June, any-

again and frowned.
“Couldn't call it a speaking likeness
exactly, this little pen-picture of you,
could one? If you only had a photo-
graph of yourself now.”
“I have, Sir,” said I brightly.
“Good Lord, man, why didn't you
say so before ? Here, take this and

THE MUD LARKS.
WHEN I was young I was extremely
handsome. I have documentary evi-
dence to prove as much. There is in
existence a photograph of a young
gentleman standing with his back to
a raging seascape, one hand resting
lightly on a volume of SHAKSPEARE,
which in turn is supported by a rustic
table. The young gentleman has wide
innocent eyes, a rosebud mouth and
long golden curls (the sort poor dear
old RoMNEY used to do so nicely). For
the rest he is tastefully upholstered in
a short-panted velvet suit, a lace collar
and white silk socks. “Little Lord
Fauntleroy,” you murmur to yourself.
No, Sir (or Madam), it is ME–or was
me, rather. When I was young no
girl thought herself-
properly married un-
less I was present at
the ceremony, got up
like a prize-rabbit and
tethered to the far end £ys
of her train. Nowa- sº
days I am not so hand-| yº
some. True, you can
urge a horse past me
without blindfolding
it and all that, but
nobody ever mistakes
me for LILY ELSIE.
Personally I was
quite willing to be re-
presented at the Na-
tional Portrait Gallery
by a coloured copy of
the presentment de-
scribed above, but my
home authorities
thought otherwise,

and done tricks with an indiarubber
monkey to make me prick my ears and
appear sagacious. This man had the
mane of a poodle, a plush smoking-
jacket with rococo trimmings,...satin
cravat, rings and bangles like the lads
in La Bohème, and I knew myself to
be in the presence of True Art, and
bowed my head.
At the sight of me he winced visibly;
didn't seem to like my looks at all.
However he pulled himself together and
advanced to reconnoitre. He pushed
me into a chair, manipulated some
screws at the back, and I found my
head fast in a steel clamp. I pleaded
for gas or cocaine, but he took no notice
and prowled off to the far end of the
pleasing portraiture, an objet d'art, an
ornament to anybody's family album.
The man Walpré was an artist all right.
A few days ago the Skipper whistled
me into the orderly-room. His table
was littered with parade states, horse-
registers and slips of cardboard, all
intermingled. The Skipper himself ap-
peared to be undergoing some heavy
mental disturbance. His forehead was
furrowed, his toupet rumpled, and he
sucked his fountain-pen, unconsciously
imbibing much dark nourishment.
“Identification cards,” he explained,
indicating the slips. “Got to carry 'em
now. Comply with Italian regulations.
Been trying to describe you. Napoo.”
He prodded the result towards me. I
scanned it and decided he had got it

said; “he is so artistic.” So to Walpré
I went, and was admitted by a hand-
maid who waved a white hand vaguely
towards a selection of doors, murmur-
ing, “Wait there, please.” I opened
the nearest door at a venture and
entered.
In the waiting-room three other
handmaids were at work on photo-
graphs. One was painting dimples on
a lady's cheek; one filling in gaps in a
Second-Lieutenant's moustache; one
straightening the salient of a stock-
broker's waistcoat. Presently the first
handmaid reappeared and somewhat
curtly (I was waiting in the wrong
room, it seemed) informed me that the
Master was ready. So I went upstairs
to the operating theatre. After an im-
pressive interval a curtain was thrust
aside and the Master entered. He was
lend any enchantment. Apparently
it would not. The more he saw of
me the less he seemed to admire the
view.
Suddenly the fire of inspiration lit his

THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.
VII.
CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER LXXX.
(continued).
IRichard. Was it not in this reign,
Mamma, that there was the Ministry
of All the Talents, or some such name?
Mrs. M. The title you refer to was
applied to a Ministry in a much earlier
reign. You are probably confusing it
with the famous “Ministry of all the
Ministries,” which held office in this
period. The tendency of Ministries
to increase in size had reached what
was supposed to be the limit in the
case of its predecessor, which contained
no fewer than twenty-two members,
which, as some of its critics remarked,
might be cricket but was not politics.
George. But I thought the great ob-
jection to politics was that so often it
was not cricket, which it ought to be.
Mrs. M. That is a point, my dear
boy, which I must leave you to discuss
with your father when he comes in to
tea, as my recollections of cricket are
growing rather hazy. Anyhow, while
the Ministry which succeeded the large
one I have maentioned was nominally
much smaller, as only a few members
formed the inner Cabinet, the number
of Ministries or Departments went on
increasing more rapidly than ever. I
remember my grandfather telling us
that whereas in the early stages of
this development the familiar comment
about once a week was, “Great Scott
Another new Ministry | " later on this
surprise gave place to a languid curiosity
expressed in the daily question at the
breakfast-table, “Well, what's the new
Ministry to-day ?”
Mary. Pray, Mamma,
“Great Scott " ?
Mrs. M. The origin of this phrase,
as of another in vogue about the same
time, “Great Caesar's ghost,” is wrapped
in mystery. Moreover, the investiga-
tion of oaths or ejaculations is seldom
edifying. To resume: some of the new
Ministries, the formation of which
was suggested by immediate national
urgency, were harmless and necessary
enough. Such, for example, was the
Ministry of Margarine, the head of
which presided over a Board of Synthe-
tic Experts; or the Pork Board, directed
by the Minister of the Piggeries. But
after a while the founding of new Depart-
ments seemed to be no longer dictated
by utilitarian or business motives, but
by the desire of mere multiplication, as
though some special credit attached to
State intervention in and control of
as many fields of human activity as
possible.
Thus there came into existence the
who was
was avowedly to harness imagination
to the service of the State, to issue
licences to writers and to provide
them with suitable themes for the
exercise of their talent. This was a
most laudable notion in the abstract,
but the attempt to carry it out led to
the famous strike of the novelists, which
was only settled, after much effusion
of ink, by a compromise, in which the
Minister of Fiction was forbidden him-
self to publish novels, and his Advisory
Board was elected by the votes of
writers with a certified circulation of
at least fifty thousand copies per vol-
ume. On these terms the Rev. H. G.
Wells, who had accepted the post of
Minister, resigned his office and things
went on very much as usual.
The Ministry of Millinery, formed to
discourage undue extravagance in dress,
was in existence for six weeks and only
cost the country about half a million
pounds sterling. Its fall was precipi-
tated by the patriotic but perhaps in-
judicious attempt of the Minister to
enforce the universal adoption of a
standardised suit of papier-maché—a
material in the manufacture of which
he took a deep personal interest—in
the month of February.
Then there was the Ministry of Patri-
otic Psychology, employing a staff of
six thousand brilliant journalists, under
the direction of a great newspaper pro-
prietor, the aim being “to mobilize the
sympathies and antipathies of mass
opinion in the interests of the Govern-
ment.” Their efforts were so successful
that a Ministry of Conciliation had very
shortly to be established with a view
to counteract the influence of the six
thousand, to tranquillize public opinion
and compose the constant friction and
collisions which arose.
Mary. I am getting rather tired of
all these old Ministries. Can't we get
on to something more interesting?
Mrs. M. Your impatience does not
surprise me, and I will try to finish the
subject as quickly as I can. In the old
days the distinction between the Gov-
ernment and the governed was broad
and clear. Under the “Ministry of all
the Ministries” it had largely disap-
peared. Not one man in ten thou-
sand could have given a list of Minis-
ters and their functions, and the same
was true of the Ministers themselves.
Many of them did not know each
other by sight, and when they did were
not on speaking terms. So finally
the Government had to appoint a
special Minister of Ministries, whose
duty was to answer questions in the
House about the new Departments,
what their powers were and by whom
they were appointed. As the Minister
to state who was responsible for the
appointment, was discreetly vague in
defining the powers of the new Minis-
ters, and could never give a better
reason for their selection than that
they were “believed to be better quali-
fied for the post than anyone else,”
the questions on the subject became so
numerous as to threaten to occupy the
whole time of Parliament. Ultimately,
by the joining together of some Depart-
ments and the suppression of others,
the number of Ministries was reduced
successively to 150, 100, 75 and ulti-
mately to 22.
THE BATTLE OF BUNNINNADDEN.
[According to The Pall Mall Gazette, the
Sinn Feiners have taken over two hundred
acres of grazing land in Sligo, disregarding
the objections of owners. PHIBBs DooBEG,
near Bunninnadden, refused to give them any
land, and trouble is expected in the district.]
MUCH have I mused on men of old
Who wrote their names on Memory's
pages,
Unflinching heroes, uncontrolled
By the nice precepts of the sages,
Whô never failed when rebus in angustis
To stand foursquare for Freedom and
for Justice.
And of this breed I hail Doobed,
Who cared not, though the odds were
fearful,
But stuck it bravely out, good egg,
Scorning the counsel of the tearful,
And utterly refused to give his acres
Into the hands of traitors and law-
breakers.
And then, O Phoebus ! what a name
And what a place too, Bunninnadden,
To fill the sounding trump of Fame
And with its inspiration madden
To rarest ecstasy the living lyre
And set the fat a-fizzling in the fire.
While others made no show of fight,
But meekly, weakly, knuckled under,
PHIBBs, standing firm upon his right,
Defied the advocates of plunder,
Staunchly resolved at any cost to quash
The tyrannous edict of the Celto-Bosch.
The issue still remains in doubt;
But whether PHIBBs should keep his
end u
Or be o'erwhelmed and driven out
And Fate unkind his number send up,
Yet still the name and deed our hearts
shall gladden
Of PHIBBs Doobec, the Boy of Bunnin-
madden.

AS YOU WERE. BETTER LEAVE HIS STOMACH ALONE A BIT-IT's
CIVIL SERVICE.
“TALKING of narrer squeaks,” said
Sergeant Buttle, “the narrerest as
ever I had by a long chalk was out at
Passchendaele, back in the Autumn.
You remember that bit o' rising ground
where you was hit, Sir? Well, when
we went into the line again a fortnight
later, the Bosch had got that bit back,
which, seeing the trouble we'd had over
it, was annoying. The orders to the
Brigade was, “You took it before, and
you must take it again.” “As you were,'
in a manner of speaking.
“We had a toughish job round them
pill-boxes on the right, but after they
was took Fritz didn't put up much of
a show. You know what he is, Sir, a
good fighter from cover, but when it
comes to close quarters hoppin' it pretty
Smart. I took a dozen men forward to
See if we couldn't cut off some of them
coming out of the pill-boxes, and sure
enough, as I scrambled up out of a shell-
hole, there was a Bosch not ten yards
from me, looking this way and that like
a frightened hare. I rests my arms on
the rim of the crater and draws a bead
on him.
“‘Got you, my boy,' thinks I, and I
looses off. You'll remember some of my
Scores for the Company Cup before the
War, Sir. I didn't used to drop more
than a point or two at six hundred
yards as a general rule. But peace is
one thing and war's another, and if I
didn't go and score a bloomin' miss!
Gee, I was angry. I lep up and rushed
upon Fritz with my bayonet, feeling
like a wild beast, rather overlookin' it
wasn't his fault I'd missed him.”
“I thought you said you'd had a nar-
row squeak,” I said. “It looks to me
almost as if the squeak was Fritz's.”
“Wait a moment, Sir. He hadn't
had time more than to turn his head
when I was on him ; but at that mo-
ment I put my foot in a hole and come
sprawling down at his feet with my
rifle bouncing down the hill. “Your
number's up, Buttle,' thinks I to my-
self, ‘and all thro' scoring a miss at
eight yards in a good light on a still
day.' And then what d'yer think hap-
pened 2 If old Fritz didn't dash for-
ward, help me up, dust me down, and
then run and get my rifle and hand it
back to me. I never felt such a fool
in my life. “What's yer game?' I
sez. “But anyway you're my prisoner;"
and he gives a grin and shuffles off
along with one of the men what I was
sending back to report.
“We had a discussion in the evening
about that man. The Sergeant-Major
said that Fritz had just come to the
conclusion that it was high time the
War was over, so far as he was con-
cerned, like a good many of his pals
had. Young Thompson, what I'd had
to dress down that morning, said Fritz
had very likely mistook me for the
KAISER; but I don't think he meant
me to hear it.
“Well, the next day when we went
back blowed if I didn't see the very man
in one of the cages. I gets hold of an
interpreter and explains about it to him
and gets him to ask Fritz why he acted
as he did; and you wouldn't guess the
answer in a hundred years. It seems
that in private life that man was an
attendant at a skating-rink in Berlin,
and he done it just from habit.”

To the Memory of Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson.
Mr. Punch would like to give further publicity to an appeal
for the New Hospital for Women, Euston Road, in memory
of the late Dr. ELIZABETH GARRETT ANDERson, who founded
it in 1866. In recognition of Mrs. ANDERsoN's work on
behalf of women—it was she who pioneered the women's
medical movement and won for them a professional status
—this appeal is made in particular to all women who
are earning their own living in whatever profession or
occupation.
The War has greatly enlarged the scope and needs of the
New Hospital for Women, which receives the overflow of
patients from other hospitals that have been taken over for
military purposes. It is hoped that funds may be raised
for the endowment of fifty new beds, at a cost of £1,000
each. H.R.H. Princess Louise has consented to preside at
a meeting of the Appeal Committee to be held at the
Hospital on March 14th. Donations should be addressed
to the Hon. Treasurer of the Appeal Fund, Lady HALL, at
the New Hospital for Women, Euston Road, N.W.1.
The Refinement of Cruelty.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 18th.-In view of
a possible “crisis,” Members listened
with ill-concealed impatience to the
usual string of trivial Questions. Scot-
tish Members, however, were aroused
when Mr. GULLAND was informed that
the Board of Trade could not amend
the Motor Spirit Order in order to
allow motor-car owners to drive to
church. You may still take a taxi to
the theatre, but that, according to Mr.
WARDLE, is quite a different matter.
It is presumed that he was referring to
the fact that attend-
ance at divine worship
brings no grist to the
revenue; but the ru-
mour that the CHAN-
CELLOR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER, in order to
remove this anomaly,
is contemplating the
extension of the en-
tertainment - tax to
churches and chapels
—the amount to vary
inversely with the
length of the sermon
— has not yet been
confirmed.
Mr. FABER was re-
quested to postpone
his demand for a
specific statement as
to how far our mili-
tary chiefs approved
of the recent decisions
at Versailles. Sir
HENRY DALzIEL was
more fortunate. With
that passion for accu-
racy that character-
ises the PRIME MIN-
Is TER's journalistic
cronies he inquired
whether there was any
foundation for the ru-
mour that Sir WILLIAM Robertson had
accepted an important military post.
The LEADER OF THE House, with a
satisfaction that he did not attempt to
conceal, admitted that there was: Sir
WILLIAM Robertson had that day ac-
cepted the Eastern Command.
This Command is not to be despised.
Commonly regarded as a feather-bed
for weary warriors it has proved a
spring-mattress for Sir HENRY WILsoN,
who leapt from it to his present post
of Chief of the Imperial Staff. May
it preserve its resilience.
Tuesday, February 19th.-It is no
disparagement to the many eminent
orators in the House of Lords to say
that not one of them could have
attracted such an audience as filled the
Peeresses, Commoners and journalists, to promise any relief, and it is felt
had all come to see one slender boy, that the difficulty of preventing the
whose ducal robes barely concealed the atmosphere of the Convention from
nobler khaki beneath, take his place becoming unduly heated has been
among our hereditary legislators.

scheme and to become Houses of Short
Commons. In the Lower Chamber the
Kitchen Committee will insist upon
carnivorous Members producing their
coupons, if their wives will let them;
while in the Upper
all days will be meat-
less days.
The House listened
with keen appreci-
ation while Mr. MAC-
PHERSON described the
multifarious activities
of the War Office. It
is now the biggest tex-
tile manufacturer in
the world, and has
made enough khaki to
put a girdle round the
earth six or seven
times over. It uses
quinine by the ton
and cotton-wool by
the thousand tons,
while the steel that
used to go to the
manufacture of jam-
tins (now replaced by
wood-pulp cartons)
would have sufficed to
build a 3,000-ton ship
every year. An extract
from an officer's letter

cluding a cavalry-
charge not less heroic

ful than that of the

Imperial Staff. It is hard to say
whether their Lordships were con-
vinced. As Lord MIDLETON expressed
a desire for a Secret Session it may
be inferred that he would have liked
to use language unfit for publication.
In the House of Commons the PRIME
MINISTER was simultaneously engaged
in the same task as Lord DERBY,
but with greater success. Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE has no equal in the art of per-
suading an audience to share his faith
in himself.

quarters. Mr. TENNANT wistfully re-
called the days when he sat in Mr.
MACPHERson's place, and was not
allowed nearly the same latitude.
Thursday, February 21st.—In pre-
senting for the first time the estimates
for the Air Force, Major BAIRD made
a speech which Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING
characterised as “nonsense,” and which
therefore needs no further testimonial.
The gist of the reply to Sir CHARLEs
HENRY's inquiry whether the food-
restrictions would apply to domestic
produce was that, if you consume your
little boy's pet rabbit, it will be counted
as part of the meat-ration, but if you act

A WARNING TO PARENTS.
THIS is a warning to all parents, and
in particular to those who have ex-
pectations from wealthy but nervous
relatives. It applies also to all times,
but in particular to those nights when
the moon is more or less full.
Perhaps I shall best achieve my
purpose if I narrate the tragic experi-
ence under which my wife and family,
to say nothing of myself, have lost the
interest of my wife's Aunt Letty. The
calamity occurred last week, when dear
Aunt Letty was paying a daylight visit
before hastening back to the compara-
tive security of Oatlands Park, where,
since one of the early raids scared her
nearly to death, she has resided. It
happens that our house is at the mo-
ment blessed by, in addition to its
of my son Roderick, whom an epidemic
of mumps has driven back to a home
circle which parted from him at the
end of the Christmas holidays without
any regret whatever. Other parents
will, I am sure, bear me out when I
say that a healthy boy who is at home
when he ought to be at school comes
nearer manifesting the condition of
perpetual restlessness than anything
on earth, a fox-hound's tail not ex-
cluded.
But I make the story too long.
Enough to say that I left the house
after lunch on the best possible terms
with Aunt Letty, and walked to the
Club, perfectly secure in my mind that
certain little benefactions from her
(not to be disregarded in war-time)
were bound to materialise; and that
I returned before dinner to find that
she had left, with palpitations of the
heart, in a rage that nothing was
likely ever to moderate, vowing that
no persuasion would ever get her under
my roof again.
And the cause ? The cause was a
packet of parlour fireworks with which
Roderick had been experimenting, en-
directions for the proper exploitation of
which I will now copy from a printed
slip: “To show the effect of The
Dragon's Breath place one teaspoonful
of the powder in a tube and say nothing
about it, then walk carelessly toward a
naked gas flame or lighted candle and,
while your friends are thinking about
matters far removed from Dragons, put
the tube stealthily to your mouth,
point it towards the flame and blow a
strong and sudden blast of air into the
tube. The effect will be extremely start-
ling, as a stream of fire will be produced
reaching half across the room, and
before they have time to see anything
everything will be the same as before
and the tube can be secreted again.
Note—Be careful not to point the tube
towards any person, but direct it rather
to a vacant part of the room, to avoid
any chance of accident.” What had
happened was that Roderick, in his
zeal as a practical joker, had pointed
the tube towards Aunt LETTY.
To all you parents, then, and especi-
ally to those who have their boys on
their hands at this moment—a patheti-
cally numerous class—I say, beware of

regular normal occupants, the presence

Ertract from letter of conscientious householder in reply to appeal. “DEAR SIR,--I REGRET DEEPLY THAT I AM UNABLE To coSTRIBUTE
To You R Noble cAUSE, BUT MY Local HospitaL HAs LATELY BEEN MARING HEAVY CLAIMS UPON ME."
WILLIAM'S GADGET;
Or, ETIQUETTE AND ELECTRICITY.
EveRY morning for the last two
weeks William has walked out of the
hospital with me at 11 A.M., wearing
on his left side what the nurses call a
splint, but he, with a surer grasp of
technical terminology, prefers to de-
scribe as a gadget. It consists of a
kind of semi-circular straight-waistcoat
made of japanned tin and nicely padded
with felt; it keeps the left elbow of
William at the same elevation as his
left shoulder by means of a small tray
projecting to the flank on a metal strut;
another small tray projecting in front
supports William's left hand. The
machine is fastened on to William by
means of three broad bands of white
webbing. Removed from William it
looks a little like a portion of an out-
rigger, but still more like the left-hand
side of a dentist's chair. It is on the
little tray in front, you see, that the
glass of tepid water would be placed
if it were really a dentist's chair. It is
on the other little tray—exactly, yes.
William does not like his gadget. He
it; (b) that he feels like a half-opened
tin of Maconachie ration.
In answer to these two points I have
advanced two considerations—(1) that
I can easily use all the matches the
pair of us are able to buy, and (2)
that, anyhow, Macomachie rations are
better than meatless days. Besides,
we all like watching William being
interned in his great-coat every morn-
ing and having it removed from him
at night. The operation requires two
nurses. One of them holds William
firmly by the head, whilst the other
carefully draws the tarpaulin envelope
over the metal frame. It is a curious
and instructive spectacle, the taking
down and reassembling of William.
At 2.30 P.M., having partaken of
lunch, William returns to the hospital
by himself for massage, and it appears
that this journey is another tribulation
to him. Strung out over a distance of
three-quarters of a mile he encounters
a matter of seven hundred other ranks
of all regiments in twos and threes who
have finished their dinner and are now
leaving the hospital. Dogged perti-
nacity shines on every face. They are
wear red ties, but unfortunately for
William they are not all Socialists.
They salute him, and he has to answer
their salutes.
The other evening at 9 P.M., having
been extricated from his great-coat and
his gadget, he came over to my bed to
complain.
“How many times do you suppose
I have had to lift my right arm between
‘The Blue Boar’ and the hospital?” he
asked, sitting down wearily on my toes.
“I don't know, I’m sure,” I said.
“Were you carrying any refreshments
on the little tray in front?”
“Two hundred and fifty three salutes,”
he cried wrathfully, putting a pillow
over my face; “and nearly every one
of them smiled. Do they suppose I'm
wearing the thing for fun ?”
“Probably they think it's the com-
bined body-shield and rifle rest that is
being sold so much just now,” I replied,
removing the gas-mask, “ or else the
One-man Tank.”
“What would you do if you were in
my place 2" he said.
“First of all I should get up off my
toes—I mean off yours,” I answered,

“And what happens when I get to
the massage-room 2" he went on, pay-
ing no attention to my advice. “To
begin with, they take off my gadget
and put my arm into a little china bath
with two wires attached. They turn
on some taps and it tickles. I sit there
wriggling and laughing and saying,
‘Don't, please don't, for about half-an-
hour. Then I move on to another
electrical which-was-it, and they pull
a lever and dab me all over with a little
pad like an orderly-room stamp for

“If I were censoring you,” I began—
“Do shut up,” said William. “After
that they squirt hot air at me with
a thing that's called radial heat.
Then I get hand massage; then I am
thoroughly slapped ->
“You probably did something to
deserve it—”
“And then my arm is twisted about
in a most Hunnish manner for about
ten minutes until it's time for tea.
I tell you I've had enough of it. This
afternoon I spoke to the doctor. I
made a brilliant and original suggestion
to him. I said I wanted an entirely
new gadget, one to fit on my right-
hand side and support my right elbow
and right hand.”
“What did he do?” I asked, feeling
a little more interested. “Send for
your temperature chart?”
“He asked mewhat the deuce I meant,
and I told him. I said that if I could
have a gadget on my right arm I should
be obliged to salute with my left, and if
I took salutes with my left arm all the
way between lunch and the hospital I
should get exactly the same remedial
exercise for my left-arm muscles as I
now derive from being tapped and
hauled about and galvanised with his
beastly machinery. And what is more,
it would save voltage. I told him that
Lord RHoNDDA says we are short of
volts.”
“And what did he say to that?” I
asked.
“He was rather curt with me,” said
William. “He said I was a grumbler.
He said I had much better wear gad-
gets on both my arms and so save the
trouble of saluting at all. He said
there were lots of worse gadgets than
mine. He said he had seen one that
would keep my arm above my head in
the permanent position of a man stop-
ping a bus. He asked me how I should
like to wear two of those at once.”
And what did you say to that?” I
asked him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CRIMINALS.
THE scene of the drama which I am
about to unfold was a certain London
hotel, and the time was the eve of a
meatless day. We were five in number
—all men—and we sat down to the
dinner-table with the hunger that a
meatless day engenders, but with little
of that agreeable anticipation which
empty carnivora enjoy. For although
on meatless days there is often more
to eat than usual it neither fills nor
sustains, and most assuredly it does not
excite. -
With the assistance of conversation,
nonsense and the juice of the grape
we got through the first two or three
courses, in which fish and eggs and vege-
tables played their monotonous part;
and then came a dish which caused each
of us to glance furtively at his neigh-
bour's plate, to see if it were an accident
or if he had some too. Could it be true?
our eyes inquired as they met in wild
surmise. Could there be a substitute
for bacon as exact as this, or was it
the identical goods? It was. Beyond
all doubt we were doing that astonish-
ingly infrequent thing: eating bacon,
beautiful adorable bacon, the authentic
flesh of the authentic pig!
Naturally the talk at once turned
to the question, “What is meat 2" and
all kinds of dialectical skill and in-
genuity were brought to bear upon the
theme. “Meat,” said one, “is solel
that kind of meat which butchers sell—
beef, mutton, veal. The ‘flesh of swine,
however fine,' is not meat within the
meaning of the Act.” Another held
that the only meat which is not meat
is that of birds—poultry and game. It
was, however, generally agreed that,
whatever was not meat, anything apper-
taining to cattle most certainly was.
Judge of our dismay and delight when
the waiter brought the next course, and
we were again rapt away into an incred.
ible Elysium; for the basis of this dish
was tongue, indisputable tongue, and,
so far as my own portion was con-
cerned, tongue at its best—that part of
the light and tender tip with which the
ox says its wittiest things.
With so palpable a contradiction be-
fore us of all the decisions which we had
reached, we gave up the discussion; and
I made a private note of this hotel as
a place to remember when Tuesdays
and Fridays seem to be coming round
too often or (as I shall certainly do) I
lose my meat-card. And then this
most satisfactory and stimulating of
recent meals having come to an end,
we moved to another room and forgot
about it in the fumes of tobacco. The
thought of guilt, even if it ever crossed
one was to blame it was obviously the
landlord.
That was last Tuesday. This morn-
ing (Friday) I have a very different
feeling, and I am sure that those other
four malefactors will also be trem-
bling if they too read The Times. For
look at the subjoined cutting:—
“MEAT ox A MEATLLss DAY.
Mrs. Eugenie IIardiman, of the Hoe Man-
sions Hotel, was charged at Plymouth yester-
day with serving bacon and sausages on a
meatless day, and ten of the guests at the
hotel were summóºned for consuming the meat.
For the defence it was pleaded that bacon and
sausages were not meat for certain purposes,
and that Mrs. Iſardiman had been misled by
a newspaper article. Mrs. Hardiman was
fined 20s. on this charge and 10s. for not keep-
ing a proper register, and nine of the guests
were fined 10s. each.”
And it isn't as if ten-shilling notes
grew on every tree. -

You see, ’tis the way wi' these aowd

out o' this yere bathroom winder an'
take a short cut to church, if you'd
a-minded, 'stead o' goin' downstairs an'
trapesin' round the drive, which is
seemlier 'owever. Aowd Mrs. Belcher
tried it to-wunst, not long arter this
winder were put in ; but 'er got stuck
till Mas'r 'Erbert, as were clerk in
them days, come out at chancel door
to see who 'twas a-spilin' the Te Deum
wi' 'er 'ollerin'. So 'er wuz laate
arter all.
Aowd Squire Belcher 'ad the winder
put in as a sort of a safety-valve, along
o' the story I'm a-goin' to tell you.
There 'adn't used to be nobbut tother
winder, which nobody cuddn't get out
on, as you may see fer yourself.
Squire Belcher were a aowd-fash-
ioned gen'elman an' dead set agen

fell foul o' the matter even wi' Miss
Tyack, as rented Tudor'Ouse offen 'un,
an' were a 'ooman as 'e respecked fer

“But you'm a-do same as you'm a-doin'
of now an' same's what me an' ivery
Christian an' all does. Can't the maaids
bring 'ee up all the hot waater as you
do want?” 'a says.
“No, Squire,” says 'er, very peart-
like. “I doan't allow of no maaids
comin' in when I'm i' my baath and
wants mwore hot waater, an' yeou
'adn't ought to neether. I wunner as
Mrs. Belcher allows of sich goin's on,”
'er says. - -
Well, Squire Belcher 'e 'ooldn't give
in to she ner to no other faddy tenant
as waanted baaths put in. An' then,
begad, if 'a didn't goo an 'ave a baath
put in 'isself—this 'ere very baath 'twas
as is 'ere to-day. 'E called my aowd
father, as were i' the plumbin’ line afore
me, an' 'e egsplains to 'm as the Doctor
'ad swore as there warn’t no way for it, if
Squire wanted to 'unt the pack another
year, but settin' in 'ot waater up to the
chin three days a wik, along o' his suf-
ferin' from stiffness o' the jints. Doctor
defied 'im to sit i' the saddle else. So,
fer the sake o' the 'Unt, 'a was agree-
able—on'y'e vowed as 'twere to be kep'
secret 'bout him havin' a baath put in,
or hout they sh'd arl goo, workmen and
maaids, come Lady Day.
Well, now, you'll agree wi' me as
'twere mortal foolish o' Squire to go
fer to make a secret o's chin-up ad-
loosh'ns, 'specially seein’ as 'ow in my
aowd father's opinyun Miss Tyack
were privy to the hwole affair, 'er
bein’ a monstrous mishtiful 'ooman
and iver so thick wi' th' advd Doctor.
My father had used to saay as 'twas
she as set he up to 't, and anny road
'twas rather better nur even 'lections
on the hwole affair comin' out. Fer
you caan't kip no secrets i' Dovedale
par'sh, not if you tries iver so.
Well, this yere baath were put in,
though Squire kip iffing an' offing, say-
ing as 'e'd allus believed in gi'in' 'is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
His Job (LANE) starts with the severe handicap of having
to live up to the promise of an altogether charming picture-
wrapper. While I will not go so far as to say that this
promise was wholly fulfilled, there are at least two points
upon which I may unreservedly congratulate Mr. HoRAcE
BLEACKLEY—his obvious command both of the inner
workings of the dye industry and the intricacies of Lanca-
shire idiom. Indeed, a half-dozen chapters of His Job are
enough to give the most uninstructed reader a grounding
in the mysteries of colour production; while I have seldom
met a novelist who seemed so securely at home amid the
hazards of dialect. After this introduction do I need to tell
you that His Job is the managing of the dye business that
came to the hero in hereditary succession, when he would
emphatically rather have been doing almost anything else?
He is one Ronald Egerton, plucked untimely from the
delights of Harrow and vowed to the uncongenial task of
revitalizing a dwindling enterprise. Incidentally we see
this, if you have a taste for such fare, and then turn to
one of the short stories, called “The Day of Days”;
sentimental, I will not deny it, but for charm and delicate
artistry this gentle little tale of two old spinsters squander-
ing their last savings on a motor-drive for wounded
soldiers easily attains a success that the Duchess and her
convulsive coterie pursue in vain.
Mr. ANTONIO DE NAVARRo divides his book, The Scottish
Women's Hospital at the French Abbey of Royaumont (ALLEN
AND UNWIN), into two parts, the first of which gives us the
history of the Abbey itself, while the second tells us of the
noble work which is now being done there. The author
has been at infinite pains to collate the records of this
historic monastery, and he has told his tale in a style and
with a sympathy alike admirable, so that we approach the
main subject of his book with a real feeling for the senti-
ment of the place and the romantic environment of the
hospital that is established within the Abbey walls. I have
already had the privilege of writing in praise of the Scottish
Women's Hospitals, and it is a theme which anyone
as may be found in a
love-affair (which comes -
to nothing) and some mild
flirtations with the stars
of Manchester pantomime.
Eventually, subdued to
what he works in, Ronald
is left, the perfect dyer,
heroically refusing the
temptations of a combine.
Perhaps the obvious moral
is susceptible of varied
interpretations. There is
much careful observation
in the story, notably in the
relations between Ronald
and his father; and, as I
say, Mr. BLEACKLEY knows
his theme. On the whole,

"I who reads of their wonder-
ful work is glad enough
to be allowed to renew.
With unfailing tact Mr. DE
NAVARRo tells the story
of the Hospital at Royau-
mont (the only one “run
entirely by women”), in-
spiring us with his own as-
surance that the work done
by such devoted women on
behalf of such devoted men
must be twice blessed. The
sorrow of the patients when
they have to leave is the
best tribute to the kind-
ness and skill that abound
to-day in the Abbey. My
only regret is that a book so
however, I should call His Job (the title continually tempts
me to add “or what a young man did") more interesting
as a treatise than entertaining as a romance.
The Duchess in Pursuit (MILLS AND Boon) is one of those
volumes agreeably made up of a short novel and a cluster
of shorter stories. I take it that the reason for this custom
is that fiction, like war-bread, is sold by weight, and that,
as The Duchess's pursuit lasts for less than a couple of
hundred pages, Miss I. A. R. WYLIE had to throw five odd
pieces into the scales. Anyhow I have rightly called the
result agreeable, if only for the impression that it pro-
duces of giving full value. It has also the advantage that,
if the novel fails to entertain, you have still more than one
further chance within the same covers. I am afraid I must
go on to say that this latter consolation was needed in the
present instance, since I found Miss WYLIE's chief con-
tribution almost too wild for even the best-natured credulity.
A widowed and white-haired Duchess, with a “modern"
daughter, escapes from Park Lane, dyes her grey hair black,
captures the affections of the young poet whom her
daughter has just offended, goes to Paris and has amazing
adventures with a pair of lovers and a derelict baby, finally
ending up by accepting her life-long admirer, and backing
herself and him to beat another elderly just united pair in
a grotesque race to England. Frankly the scheme is too
preposterous for me to do more than acknowledge the
--- delicately and delightfully
written should be burdened by so cumbrous a title.
The three stories that go to the making up of Cute
McCheyne (CHAMBERs), by J. L. WAUGH, are but slight
and unsubstantial things so far as mere plot and incident
are concerned. In the first story, indeed, which gives its
| title to the book, no sooner has Mr. WAUGH laid the
foundations of a sound and interesting (if somewhat old-
fashioned) plot, than, hey-presto, he whisks it away and
leaves the reader foiled and gasping. This is not to say that
Mr. WAUGH has not a pretty gift for narrative by dialogue.
He has that and something more. He can tell a simple tale
in a simple and straightforward manner, and if he uses
sentiment he does so with discretion. But his chief merit
—in my eyes at least—is his delightful employment of the
Doric, the Scottish dialect that binds Scotsmen together
all the world over. In this point Mr. WAUGH is unsurpas-
sable. His dialect is the authentic stuff, crisp and forcible
and redolent of the soil on which his characters are bred.
Having read Cute McCheyne I feel that I could pass an
examination in the vernacular, for I know the meaning of
“kenspeckle,” “fremit,” “jalouse” (as a verb), “the haill
rick-ma-tic,” and many another bit of Scots, for which and
for his stories I am grateful to Mr. WAUGH.
“CAILLAUx's SAFE,” says a newspaper heading. With-
out wishing to prejudice the result of his trial, we do not




nimbleness of Miss WYLIE's invention. Skim through
endorse this forecast.

fierce light in his eyes was faintly reflected on his elbows
and knees. He had a soft felt hat on his head and a good
deal of camouflage on his chin. He told me that he had
recently come from Russia, and had spent some time in
Finland disguised as a Swede. I was not surprised to hear
it. He looked to me the kind of man who could have

Mrs. M. Not exactly, my dear boy,

doubtedly the potato attained to great
importance owing to the shortage of
meat supplies and the variety of pur-
poses to which it was turned. Flower-
gardens were dug up and T
potatoes were planted every-
where. More than that, a
group of influential news-
papers devoted their entire
energies to the promotion
of potato-planting, and the
principal proprietor was ele-

the title of Lord Tuberstock
in recognition of his services.
Manufactories were estab-

this was discouraged as inter-

Mrs. M. I am sorry not to have used
a simpler word, but amalgamation,
which means joining or mixing together
in one composite body, was a special
feature of this age. Ultimately all
newspapers were amalgamated into one
great corporation and editors ceased to
exist. Only journalists and proprietors
were left. So too with the Government.
Coalitions gave place to Amalgamated
Ministries, and the Premiership was put

THE SECRET OF GERMANY'S MAN-POWER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have now at
last solved the problem of the hour,
and I make haste to adopt my invari-
able custom of handing on my solution
for the benefit of your readers. It has,
of course, puzzled them to understand
where all the German soldiers come
from, or how it is that, at a time when
(as is clearly indicated by their adver-
tisements) they are in train to launch
an overwhelming offensive in the West,
they should also be able to undertake
a fresh invasion of Russia.
Where, in short, have these
soldiers come from who are
flooding Russia 2
| The truth has leaked out.
They are not soldiers at all.
Though it has more than
once been hinted at, the first
clear statement of this singu-
lar development occurs in an
appeal from the Bolshevist
Government for the defence
of the Revolution, which,
they said, must shed its last
drop of blood “against the
adventurous march of the
German capitalists.”
So there you have it; it is
by a colossal experiment in
dilution that the Germans
have achieved their concen-
tration against us.
Three pregnant reflections
occur to me:—
1. That German exhaus-
|tion in man-power must
surely be far advanced before
the capitalists were combed
out en masse.
2. That from what I have
seen of German plutocrats
they would be a fine sight on
a forced march.
3. That this is a war of
exhaustion, and so I hope our
own capitalists are getting
into training.

A DRAMA OF DORSET.
ONCE upon a time, in the old days
before ration-cards, there was a quarter
of a pound of butter. It was as patri-
otic a little pat as was ever born in
Dorset and it yearned to do its bit. To
be spread on hot toast for a soldier home
on leave; worked into a wedding cake
for a W.C. and his bride; sent in a
mustard tin by a mother to her boy in
Flanders, met by a shell on the way
and blown into his dug-out side by
side with a French roll and a barrel of
oysters—these were some of its day-
dreams. But it never breathed them
to anyone; it lay quite quiet on the
counter behind the rasher machine, and
it didn't contradict Mr. Jones when he
said “No butter to-day ” to seventy-
five customers. It knew its time would
conne.
And it did. Lord de Courcy Mangles
carried it home in his waistcoat pocket.
He wasn't in the queue. He merely
looked in to inquire after Mrs. Jones
and the children and to remark how
well Mr. Jones was standing the strain
and he was sending him a brace of
pheasants.
“I shouldn't do it for ourselves, of
course,” he said to Lady de Courcy
Mangles, “it’s for the poor old Mater's
sake; you can't eat cart-grease at
seventy-three, and perhaps I haven't
been as good a son as I might have
been. I wish it was twice as big.”
Then, as luck would have it, he hap-
pened on the following recipe in the
Press:–
“How To Double YoUR BUTTER.
To a quarter of a pound of warm butter
take a quarter of a pint of warm milk and |
half a teaspoonful of salt. Work all together
into a paste with a spatula. Leave until cold,
when you will find the butter is twice its
original size.”
It was quite true. The pat was very
proud of itself when Lady de Courcy
Mangles had finished with it. It was
rather pale and its sides trembled a
little, but it tasted all right, she said,
when she licked the spatula and gave
Lord de Courcy Mangles a bit on her
thumb. “Darling Mum,” he wrote,

set. Stick to it yourself; don't let 'em
handle it in the kitchen.”
But the Duchess was a selfless old
lady. “As if I could swallow a mouth-
ful with a Convalescent Home for
Wounded Officers just opposite,” she
said to Miss Gibbs, her companion. “I
only wish there was more of it; I'm
afraid half-a-pound won't go round.”
“I’ll make it a pound,” said Miss
Gibbs, who was a walking encyclopædia
of war recipes. And she did. The pat
of butter went p.’” than ever and it

Mrs. M. Not exactly, my dear boy,

importance owing to the shortage of
meat supplies and the variety of pur-
poses to which it was turned. Flower-

papers devoted their entire
energies to the promotion
of potato-planting, and the
principal proprietor was ele-
vated to the peerage under
the title of Lord Tuberstock
in recognition of his services.
Manufactories were estab-
lished to make paper out of
mashed potatoes, and an at-
tempt was made to print books
on prepared potato-skins; but
this was discouraged as inter-
fering with the food-supply.
A rival group of newspapers
took up the cause of parsnips
with equal energy.
Mary. Oh, Mamma, how
could they? I simply hate
parsnips.
Mrs. M. My dear child, it is
very foolish and ungrateful to
speak disrespectfully of any
vegetable. The parsnip is un-
usually rich in what are called
“vitamines,” or vitally nutri-
tious properties. In the end,
however, the two groups of
newspapers were amalga-

THE SECRET OF GERMANY'S MAN-POWER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I have now at
last solved the problem of the hour,
and I make haste to adopt my invari-
able custom of handing on my solution
for the benefit of your readers. It has,
of course, puzzled them to understand
where all the German soldiers come
from, or how it is that, at a time when
(as is clearly indicated by their adver-
tisements) they are in train to launch
an overwhelming offensive in the West,
they should also be able to undertake
Tº a fresh invasion of Russia.
|W. in short, have these
soldiers come from who are
flooding Russia 2
| The truth has leaked out.
They are not soldiers at all.
Though it has more than
once been hinted at, the first
clear statement of this singu-
lar development occurs in an
appeal from the Bolshevist
Government for the defence
of the Revolution, which,
they said, must shed its last
drop of blood “ against the
adventurous march of the
German capitalists.”
So there you have it; it is
by a colossal experiment in
dilution that the Germans
have achieved their concen-
tration against us.
Three pregnant reflections
occur to me:—
1. That German exhaus-
|tion in man-power must
surely be far advanced before
the capitalists were combed
out en masse.
2. That from what I have
seen of German plutocrats
they would be a fine sight on
a forced march.
3. That this is a war of
exhaustion, and so I hope our
of amalgamation. What does it mean?
Mrs. M. I am sorry not to have used
a simpler word, but amalgamation,
which means joining or mixing together
in one composite body, was a special
feature of this age. Ultimately all
newspapers were amalgamated into one
great corporation and editors ceased to
exist. Only journalists and proprietors
were left. So too with the Government.
Coalitions gave place to Amalgamated
Ministries, and the Premiership was put
into commission; that is to say, the
nominal Premier was in reality only

able that they were incorporated under
the joint title of Duke of Brockenbourne.
Lord Pulpington, again, discovered the
true principles of military strategy, and
a syndicate of distinguished statesmen
rediscovered the existence of the for-
gotten island of Ireland, which had
eluded the attention of the Government
under the alias of “Sinn Fein.” In the
domain of literature a number of new
epithets were coined or popularised by
Sir HARold BEGBIE, the great apostle of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE JOKE : A TRAGEDY.
CHAPTER I.
THE Joke was born one October day
in the trench called Mechanics, not so
far from Loos.
We had just come back into the line
after six days in reserve and, the after-
noon being quiet, I was writing my
usual letter to Celia. I was telling her
about our cat, imported into our dug-
out in the hope that it would keep the
rats down, when suddenly the Joke
came. I was so surprised by it that
I added in brackets, “This is quite my
own. I've only just thought of it.”
Later on the Post-Corporal came, and
the Joke started on its way to England.
CHAPTER II.
Chapter II. finds me some months
later at home again.
“Do you remember that joke about
the rats in one of your letters?” said
Celia one evening.
“Yes. You never told me if you
liked it.”
“I simply loved it. You aren't going
to waste it, are you?”
“If you simply loved it, it wasn't
wasted.”
“But I want everybody else
Couldn't you use it in the Revue 2"
I was supposed to be writing a Revue
at this time for a certain impresario.
I wasn't getting on very fast, because
whenever I suggested a scene to him,
he either said, “Oh, that's been done,”
which killed it, or else he said, “Oh,
but that's never been done,” which
killed it even more completely.
“Good idea,” I said to Celia. “We'll
have a Trench Scene.” -
I suggested it to the impresario when
next I saw him.
“Oh, that 's been done,” he said.
“Mine will be quite different from
anybody else's,” I said firmly.
He brightened up a little.
“All right, try it,” he said.
I seemed to have discovered the
secret of successful revue-writing.
The Trench Scene was written. It
was written round the Joke, whose
bright beams, like a perfect jewel in a
perfect setting However, I said all
that to Celia at the time. She was just
going to have said it herself, she told me.
So far so good. But a month later
the Revue collapsed. The impresario
and I agreed upon many things—as,
for instance, that the War would be a
long one, and that HINDENBURG was
no fool—but there were two points
upon which we could never quite agree:
(1) What was funny, and (2) which of
us was writing the Revue. So, with
mutual oxpressions of goodwill, and
hopes that one day we might write a
That ended the Revue; it ended the
Trench Scene; and, for the moment, it
ended the Joke.
CHAPTER III.
Chapter III. finds Celia still at it.
“You haven't got that Joke in yet.”
She had just read an article of mine
called “Autumn in a Country Vicarage.”
“It wouldn't go in there very well,”
I said.
“It would go in anywhere where
there were rats. There might oasily
be rats in a vicarage.”
“Not in this one.”
“You talk about ‘poor as a church
mouse.’”
“I am an artist,” I said, thumping
my heart and forehead and other seats
of the emotions. “I don't happen to
see rats there, and if I don't see them
I can't write about them. Anyhow,
they wouldn't be secular rats, like the
ones I made my joke about.”
“I don't mind whether the rats are
secular or circular,” said Celia, “but
do get them in soon.”
Well, I tried. I really did try, but
for months I couldn't get those rats in.
It was a near thing sometimes, and I
would think that I had them, but at
the last moment they would whisk off
and back into their holes again. I even
wrote an article about “Cooking in the
Army,” feeling that that would surely
tempt them, but they were not to be
drawn. . . . -
CHAPTER IV.
But at last the perfect opportunity
came. I received a letter from a
botanical paper asking for an article
on the Flora of Trench Life.
“Hooray!” said Celia. “There you
are.”
I sat down and wrote the article.
Working up gradually to the subject
of rats, and even more gradually inter-
twining it, so to speak, with the subject
of cats, I brought off in one perfect
climax the great Joke.
“Lovely ' " said Celia excitedly.
“There is one small point which has
occurred to me. Rats are fauna, not
flora ; I've just remembered.”
“Oh, does it matter?”
“For a botanical paper, yes.”
And then Celia had a brilliant in-
spiration.
“Send it to another paper,” she said.
I did. Two days later it appeared.
Considering that I hadn't had a proof,
it came out extraordinarily well. There
was only one mis-print. It was at the
critical word of the Joke.
CHAPTER W.
“That's torn it,” I said to Celia.
“I suppose it has,” she said sadly.
now. It's had it wrong, but still it's
had it and I can't repeat it."
Celia began to smile.
“It's sickening,” she said: “but it's
really rather funny, you know.”
And then she had another brilliant
inspiration.
“In fact you might write an article
about it.”
And, as you see, I have.
LPILOGUE.
Having read thus far, Celia says,
“But you still haven't got the Joke in."
Oh, well, here goes. -
Ertract from letter: “We came back
to the line to-day to find that the cat
had kittened. However, as all the rats
seem to have rottened we are much as
we were.”
“Rottened" was misprinted “rat-
tened,” which seems to me to spoil the
Joke. . .
Yet I must confess that there are
times now when I feel that perhaps
after all I may have overrated it. . . .

THE MYSTERY SHIPS.
To “THE CoASTERS AND MERCHANTMEN who Accompany THE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL.”
THERE's order and law in a battleship's might;
The cruisers proceed on a logical plan;
While even destroyers go gay to the fight
By tactical units as well as they can;
But far away out in a world of their own,
Where logic and limit are shivered to bits,
You'll light on the ladies who labour alone,
The jocular gipsies who live by their wits.
Disciples of DRAKE and DUNDoNALD,
The sea in their blood and their bones,
They sail in the wake of BoscAwen and BLARE
And hail as an ally PAUL Jon Es;
For better than honour and glory
They reckon the frolics and quips
Which daily illumine the story
That comes from the Mystery Ships.
They're nautical zealots who never suppose
That right is defended by leisure and ease;
The submarine, quaking wherever she goes,
Can tell they're abroad by the feel of the seas;
There's ominous oil in the wake of their work;
The soles on the Dogger take cover amain,
And cry, as the stranger alights with a jerk,
“The Mystery Ships have been at it again!”
Untutored, but versed in the oldest of creeds,
The King's Regulations decay on their shelves;
Between the Addenda, which nobody reads,
Their pictures and pranks are denied to the Dress,
Till out of the offing as blithe as can be
A weather-worn sea-dog of twenty or less
Blows in to the Palace to get a W.C.
The family fought in ELIZABETH's time
From Bristol and Dover and Harwich and Leigh;
From Barnstaple, Yarmouth and London and Lyme
They hurried away at the call of the sea;
Their titles are writ in the Rolls of their Race,
With laughter and love we can picture them still;
Is mystery work to be done for HER GRAcE 2
My lord in the Flagship can summon at will
The Lark and the Lamb and the Moonshine,
The Hazard and IIappy Pretence,
The Wraith and the Smoke and the Merlin and Joke,
The IRiddle and Royal Defence;
As quick as a cradle could spare them
They scuttled away from the slips,
For England, the mother who bare them,
The first of the Mystery Ships.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 25th. — Fifteen
Gas Bills had been put down for Second
Reading, but not one got through. As
each title was read out by the Clerk
the fatal words, “I object,” came from
below the Gangway. Some Members,
it is clear, are not disposed to facilitate
any infringement of their monopoly.
This being the first day of compulsory
rationing the House was even more
than usually interested in questions of
food. A suggestion by Mr. MACMASTER
that the Army Council should fatten
their own pigs was resolutely de-
clined by Mr. ForsTER, who does
not fancy himself as a swineherd
on an extensive scale. One Hogg|E
at a time is his motto. His hand-
ling of the Member for East Edin-
burgh, who had been rooting riot-
ously among the Army Estimates,
was very deft.
At the end of the evening Mr.
BILLING attacked the Air Board
for, as he averred, keeping far too
many types of aeroplane engines
in stock, instead of standardizing
half-a-dozen and sticking to them.
Though he reeled off his list of
machines with a great show of
authority he did not make much
impression on a small House. He
succeeded, however, for once in
getting Major BAIRD to take the
gloves off. Members who had
accepted the volatile critic's capa-
city as an aviator at his own valu-
ation were surprised to hear Major
BAIRD's very different description
of it. When Mr. BILLING urged
the Air Board to go in heavily for
reprisals he did not mean to be
taken so literally.
Tuesday, February 26th.-As
soldiers on leave have to be pro-
vided with emergency ration-cards,
Captain CARR - GoMM suggested
that these should be given them
before they start; otherwise, judging by
this week's experience, we shall have
to introduce a new word of command,
“Form—Queues.”
There seems still to be room for
further co-ordination—blessed word l—
between certain departments of the
Government. Mr. BARNEs once more
attempted to explain his attitude to the
12% per cent, bonus conferred by the
generous-hearted MINISTER of MUNI-
TIONs, but did not entirely succeed.
The impression that I gathered was
that he approved of the bonus, but
did not approve of Mr. CHURCHILL.
At any rate Mr. KELLAWAY thought it
necessary to come to the aid of his
Chief with a spirited speech, in which
have spoken as he did. It is an odd
world in which junior Under-Secre-
taries rebuke members of the august
War-Cabinet.
Wednesday, February 27th.-In the
course of a detailed defence of the Food
Regulations Lord RHONDDA observed
that he had no desire “to curry favour,”
but omitted to state whether he had
any substitute in view.
The Foreign SECRETARY is some-
times accused of undue reticence, but
he admitted this afternoon that the
Government do not regard ex-King CoN-
STANTINE as a friend of the Allied cause.
HOSTILITIES ON THE HOME FRONT.
MR. HERBERT SAMUEL GETS ON WITH THE WAR.
Mr. BILLING was so pleased at this
announcement that he offered to pay for
TINo's clothes provided that they were
not despatched to Switzerland. It is
not known whether the Hon. Member
proposes to wear them himself, and if
so whether they include a fustanella.
Mr. CLYNEs often reminds me of
BRET HARTE's hero—“he was a most
sarcastic man, that quiet Mr. Brown.”
To-day a Scottish Member invited him,
when allowing increased rations to
invalids, to “consider the case of men
suffering from mental debility.” Mr.
CLYNEs politely replied, “I did not wish
to import any kind of personal reference
into my answer.”
Undeterred by previous rebuffs Mr.
the Government on its various sins of
commission and omission, varying from
too much beer to too few ships, and
including, of course, the appointment
of the new Directors of Propaganda.
On this last point Mr. BoNAR LAw, while
personally indifferent to the matter, con-
sidered that if propaganda be necessary
at all, people connected with the Press
would be the right people to deal with
it. For the rest, if Mr. SAMUEL and his
friends thought the Government so in-
competent, it was their plain duty to
turn them out, instead of indulging in
far from helpful criticism.
The subsequent debate was
chiefly remarkable for the glowing
testimonial given by Mr. LYNCH, of
all people, to Lords NoFTHCLIFFE
and BEAVERBRook; and for a
searching analysis by Mr. BALFour
of the German CHANCELLOR's latest
peace-effusion. “Why,” he asked,
in reference to Count HERTLING's
demand for guarantees from Bel-
gium—“why is Belgium to be pun-
ished because Germany is guilty?”
Even Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD was
driven to admit that “there must
be no humbug about Belgium ”—
reserving to himself, I suppose, the
right to talk as much humbug as
he pleased about other aspects of
the world-war.
Thursday, February 28th. —
Questions were many, but not con-
spicuously important. Mr. ARTHUR
SAMUELS regretted that it had been
found impossible to develop certain
anthracite deposits in Cork, as the
seams were much twisted and con-
torted, and the coal contained a
lot of sulphur. Irish coal would
appear to be painfully like Irish
olitics. -
The Ministry of National Service
is considering the recruitment of
women for the Air Service. No
difficulty about nomenclature, such
as occurred with the “Waacs”
and the “Wrens,” is anticipated in this
case, for the flying ladies will inevit-
ably be known as the “Angels.”

LXX.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, I am afraid my
letters will be few and far between, for
I am at the moment further away from
you than ever, very busy on my own
in Timbuc (Censored).
It all started by a request to report
to the War Office. I had nothing par-
ticular to report about, but I know it
is no use arguing with people, so I said
to myself, “If they want me they shall
have me,” and wrote a sharp minute
to myself to tell me to do as I was
told and be quick about it. I packed
up as many of my belongings as would
go into my bags; distributed the re-
mainder amongst those to whom they
properly belonged; said good-bye to my
little staff and gave them each a belong-
ing or two to carry to the station ;
told my successor that, though he could
never be like me, he must be as like me
as he could ; handed over the current
correspondence and directed that it
should all be held up for a fortnight
in order to give me time to get well
away; made up my accounts to give
them a superficial appearance of in-
tegrity and fair play; opened the office
door, paused, sighed heavily; went out;
closed office door; opened office door;
went in again to do all the things I
had forgotten; was forcibly ejected by
my successor, who was engaged in tear-
ing up all my files and starting a new
and a better set of his own; and eventu-
ally found myself in Whitehall, entering
the imposing front-door of an eligible
villa residence, and ultimately going for
a long, long walk with an even more
eligible flapper in a brown suit.
I think her name must be Flossie. If
she isn't Flossie, then it is either little
Clara or Ermyntrude who takes hold
of me when I drop in at the War
Office to have a chat with the manage-
ment, and makes me follow her about.
I'd follow any of them anywhere, up-
stairs, downstairs, in the lift, along
thousands of miles of unsympathetic
corridor; obeying their slightest whim,
advancing till they tell me to stop,
stopping till they tell me to advance.
To me they are the Goddesses of Battle;
to them I am a ne'er-do-well, with
whom they would never consent to be
seen walking but for the exigencies of
war. Oh, yes, my lad; it is all very
..What a waste of time, when he ought
well for you people, sitting in your nice
armchairs away from it all, to write
impudently that Sir WILLIAM RoBERT-,
son must go, and the A.G. must go, and
the Q.M.G. must go, and everybody
must go, and what we must have is a
BUSINEss MAN. But just you step
into the lion's den yourself and do a
route march behind Flossie's haughty
pigtail, and at the end of half an hour
of her superciliousness you will look
forward to the time when you may be
allowed to go yourself.
Flossie handed me over to a Colonel,
glad, obviously, to get rid of me, but
not apparently thinking much of the
Colonel. He said, “Good morning.”
to have been getting on or getting
under. I said “Good morning" back,
thinking that as it was the same morn-
ing it might just as well be good for
both of us. He asked me what I
wanted. “Nothing,”Isaid. This caused
a stir; it was a most unusual request.
Why had I come? To report. What
for? Duty. And so the War dragged on.
The Colonel sent someone to look me
up on a card index, being too lazy to
carry two or three hundred thousand

names in his head. He gave me a
cigarette. The Business Man would
have let me smell the smoke of a cigar.
That just shows, doesn't it? However,
I smoked it while they were finding
out about me. Meanwhile the Colonel
went on with his work. Just fancy
that—working when he ought to have
been getting on with the War.
The man who looked me up on the
index found I hadn't been previously
convicted, so we all got down to busi-
ness. They wanted me to run over to
Timbuc and do a job of work. I
rubbed my chin and said I wasn't sure
I wouldn't do it. They were glad to
hear that, because they had already
arranged the journey, booked the tickets
and announced my coming at the other
end, I said I should want a day or
two at home to get my things together.
Things do get so apart, don't they?
They had thought of that and had
allowed me a week. I wasn't for wast-
ing any of it on them, so I rushed off
home and spent the next days telling
people, in an off-hand modest sort of
for the most important job in the War.
Everybody congratulated me and called
to mind brothers, husbands, fiancés
and things who had each and all been
specially selected for the most impor-
tant job in the War.
On the last morning I hustled a
collar or two into a bag and then got
into a train. From that I got into a
tube, then into another train, then into
a boat, then into another train, then
into three more boats and four more
trains, and then, when I was quite sure
I had shaken the Hun off my track—
arrived.
And what do you think I ran into
on the doorstep of the hotel? A real
fat and unmuzzled Hun himself, walk-
ing about just as you or I might do,
the very thing I'd been itching to
meet these last three and a-half years.
And what do you think I did about it
when I did meet it? Took off my hat
to it and said, “Après vous, Monsieur.”

expect to be believed when I say that
he can recall not only 1913 but 1914;
yet he can ; and he allowed me to
draw him out. It was really a most
remarkable experience.
“I understand,” I began, “that you
are about to publish your memoirs.”
“That is so,” he said. “I fear that
unless I do so the record of social
England in the early teens of the
twentieth century may be utterly lost.”
“Tell me,” I said earnestly. “I so
long to know what life was like then.
Give me some idea of the scope of your
book.”
“It will read like a fairy tale, I fear,”
he replied musingly. “But it is all

A DRAMA OF DORSET,
ONCE upon a time, in the old days
before ration-cards, there was a quarter
of a pound of butter. It was as patri-
otic a little pat as was ever born in
Dorset and it yearned to do its bit. To

for a V.C. and his bride; sent in a
mustard tin by a mother to her boy in
Flanders, met by a shell on the way
and blown into his dug-out side by
side with a French roll and a barrel of
oysters—these were some of its day-
dreams. But it never breathed them
to anyone; it lay quite quiet on the
counter behind the rasher machine, and
it didn't contradict Mr. Jones when he
said "No butter to-day" to seventy-
five customers. It knew its time would
come.
And it did. Lord de Courcy Mangles
carried it home in his waistcoat pocket.
He wasn't in the queue. He merely
looked in to inquire after Mrs. Jones
and the children and to remark how
well Mr. Jones was standing the strain
and he was sending him a brace of
pheasants.
“I shouldn't do it for ourselves, of
course," he said to Lady de Courcy
Mangles, “it's for the poor old Mater's
sake; you can't eat cart-grease at

been. I wish it was twice as big.”
Then, as luck would have it, he hap-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 25th. — Fifteen
Gas Bills had been put down for Second
Reading, but not one got through. As
each title was read out by the Clerk
the fatal words, “I object,” came from
below the Gangway. Some Members,
it is clear, are not disposed to facilitate
any infringement of their monopoly.
This being the first day of compulsory
rationing the House was even more
than usually interested in questions of
food. A suggestion by Mr. MACMASTER
that the Army Council should fatten
their own pigs was resolutely de-
clined by Mr. ForsTER, who does
not fancy himself as a swineherd
on an extensive scale. One HoggE
at a time is his motto. His hand-
ling of the Member for East Edin-
burgh, who had been rooting riot-
ously among the Army Estimates,
was very deft.
At the end of the evening Mr.
BILLING attacked the Air Board
for, as he averred, keeping far too
many types of aeroplane engines
in stock, instead of standardizing
half-a-dozen and sticking to them.
Though he reeled off his list of
machines with a great show of
authority he did not make much
impression on a small House. He
succeeded, however, for once in
getting Major BAIRD to take the
gloves off. Members who had
accepted the volatile critic's capa-
city as an aviator at his own valu-
ation were surprised to hear Major
BAIRD's very different description
of it. When Mr. BILLING urged
the Air Board to go in heavily for
reprisals he did not mean to be
taken so literally.
Tuesday, February 26th.-As
soldiers on leave have to be pro-
vided with emergency ration-cards,
Captain CARR - GoMM suggested
that these should be given them
before they start; otherwise, judging by Mr. BILLING was so pleased at this
this week's experience, we shall have announcement that he offered to pay for
to introduce a new word of command,
“Form—Queues.”
There seems still to be room for
further co-ordination—blessed word –
between certain departments of the
Government. Mr. BARNEs once more
attempted to explain his attitude to the
12% per cent, bonus conferred by the
generous-hearted MINISTER of MUNI-
TIONs, but did not entirely succeed.
The impression that I gathered was
that he approved of the bonus, but
did not approve of Mr. CHURCHILL.
At any rate Mr. KELLAWAY thought it
necessary to come to the aid of his
Chief with a spirited speech, in which
have spoken as he did. It is an odd
world in which junior Under-Secre-
taries rebuke members of the august
War-Cabinet.
Wednesday, February 27th.-In the
course of a detailed defence of the Food
Regulations Lord RHONDDA observed
that he had no desire “to curry favour,”
but omitted to state whether he had
any substitute in view.
The Foreign SECRETARY is some-
times accused of undue reticence, but
he admitted this afternoon that the
Government do not regard ex-King CoN-
STANTINE as a friend of the Allied cause.

HOSTILITIES ON THE HOME FIRONT.
MIR. HERBERT SAMUEL GETS ON WITH THE WAR.
TINo's clothes provided that they were
not despatched to Switzerland. It is
not known whether the Hon. Member
proposes to wear them himself, and if
so whether they include a fustanella.
Mr. CLYNEs often reminds me of
BRET HARTE's hero—“he was a most
sarcastic man, that quiet Mr. Brown.”
To-day a Scottish Member invited him,
when allowing increased rations to
invalids, to “consider the case of men
suffering from mental debility.” Mr.
CLYNEs politely replied, “I did not wish
to import any kind of personal reference
into my answer.”
Undeterred by previous rebuffs Mr.
the Government on its various sins of
commission and omission, varying from
too much beer to too few ships, and
including, of course, the appointment
of the new Directors of Propaganda.
On this last point Mr. BoNAR LAw, while
personally indifferent to the matter, con-
sidered that if propaganda be necessary
at all, people connected with the Press
would be the right people to deal with
it. For the rest, if Mr. SAMUEL and his
friends thought the Government so in-
competent, it was their plain duty to
turn them out, instead of indulging in
far from helpful criticism.
The subsequent debate was
chiefly remarkable for the glowing
testimonial given by Mr. LYNCH, of
all people, to Lords NorthcLIFFE
and BEAVERBRook; and for a
searching analysis by Mr. BALFour
of the German CHANCELLOR's latest
peace-effusion. “Why,” he asked,
in reference to Count HERTLING's
demand for guarantees from Bel-
gium—“why is Belgium to be pun-
ished because Germany is guilty?”
Even Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD was
driven to admit that “there must
be no humbug about Belgium ”—
reserving to himself, I suppose, the
right to talk as much humbug as
he pleased about other aspects of
the world-war.
Thursday, February 28th. —
Questions were many, but not con-
spicuously important. Mr. ARTHUR
SAMUELs regretted that it had been
found impossible to develop certain
anthracite deposits in Cork, as the
seams were much twisted and con-
torted, and the coal contained a
lot of sulphur. Irish coal would
appear to be painfully like Irish
politics.
The Ministry of National Service
is considering the recruitment of
women for the Air Service. No
difficulty about nomenclature, such
as occurred with the “Waacs”
and the “Wrens,” is anticipated in this
case, for the flying ladies will inevit-
ably be known as the “Angels.”

MY DEAR CHARLEs, I am afraid my
letters will be few and far between, for
I am at the moment further away from
you than ever, very busy on my own
in Timbuc (Censored).
It all started by a request to report
to the War Office. I had nothing par-
ticular to report about, but I know it
is no use arguing with people, so I said
to myself, “If they want me they shall
have me,” and wrote a sharp minute
to myself to tell me to do as I was
told and be quick about it. I packed
up as many of my belongings as would
go into my bags; distributed the re-
mainder amongst those to whom they
properly belonged; said good-bye to my
little staff and gave them each a belong-
ing or two to carry to the station;
told my successor that, though he could
never be like me, he must be as like me
as he could ; handed over the current
correspondence and directed that it
should all be held up for a fortnight
in order to give me time to get well
away; made up my accounts to give
tegrity and fair play; opened the office
door, paused, sighed heavily , went out;
closed office door; opened office door;
went in again to do all the things I
had forgotten; was forcibly ejected by
my successor, who was engaged in tear-
ing up all my files and starting a new
and a better set of his own; and eventu-
ally found myself in Whitehall, entering
the imposing front-door of an eligible
villa residence, and ultimately going for
a long, long walk with an even more
eligible flapper in a brown suit.
I think her name must be Flossie. If
she isn't Flossie, then it is either little
Clara or Ermyntrude who takes hold
of me when I drop in at the War
Office to have a chat with the manage-
ment, and makes me follow her about.
I'd follow any of them anywhere, up-
stairs, downstairs, in the lift, along
thousands of miles of unsympathetic
corridor; obeying their slightest whim,
advancing till they tell me to stop,
stopping till they tell me to advance.
To me they are the Goddesses of Battle;
to them I am a ne'er-do-well, with
whom they would never consent to be
seen walking but for the exigencies of
well for you people, sitting in your nice
armchairs away from it all, to write
impudently that Sir WILLIAM ROBERT-
son must go, and the A.G. must go, and
the Q.M.G. must go, and everybody
must go, and what we must have is a
BUSINEss MAN. But just you step
into the lion's den yourself and do a
route march behind Flossie's haughty
pigtail, and at the end of half an hour
of her superciliousness you will look
forward to the time when you may be
allowed to go yourself.
Flossie handed me over to a Colonel,
glad, obviously, to get rid of me, but
not apparently thinking much of the
Colonel. He said, “Good morning.”
..What a waste of time, when he ought
to have been getting on or getting
under. I said “Good morning" back,
thinking that as it was the same morn-
ing it might just as well be good for
both of us. He asked me what I
wanted. “Nothing,”Isaid. This caused
a stir; it was a most unusual request.
Why had I come? To report. What
for? Duty. And so the War dragged on.
The Colonel sent someone to look me
up on a card index, being too lazy to

them a superficial appearance of in-
carry two or three hundred thousand
war. Oh, yes, my lad; it is all very

names in his head. He gave me a
cigarette. The Business Man would
have let me smell the smoke of a cigar.
That just shows, doesn't it? However,
I smoked it while they were finding
out about me. Meanwhile the Colonel
went on with his work. Just fancy
that—working when he ought to have
been getting on with the War.
The man who looked me up on the
index found I hadn't been previously
convicted, so we all got down to busi-
ness. They wanted me to run over to
Timbuc and do a job of work. I
rubbed my chin and said I wasn't sure
I wouldn't do it. They were glad to
hear that, because they had already
arranged the journey, booked the tickets
and announced my coming at the other
end, I said I should want a day or
two at home to get my things together.
Things do get so apart, don't they?
They had thought of that and had
allowed me a week. I wasn't for wast-
ing any of it on them, so I rushed off
home and spent the next days telling
people, in an off-hand modest sort of
for the most important job in the War.
Everybody congratulated me and called
to mind brothers, husbands, fiancés
and things who had each and all been
specially selected for the most impor-
tant job in the War.
On the last morning I hustled a
collar or two into a bag and then got
into a train. From that I got into a
tube, then into another train, then into
a boat, then into another train, then
into three more boats and four more
trains, and then, when I was quite sure
I had shaken the Hun off my track—
arrived.
And what do you think I ran into
on the doorstep of the hotel? A real
fat and unmuzzled Hun himself, walk-
ing about just as you or I might do,
the very thing I'd been itching to
meet these last three and a-half years.
And what do you think I did about it
when I did meet it? Took off my hat
to it and said, “Après vous, Monsieur.”
Well, I mean to say . . . really Now

THE DIM AND DISTANT PAST.
Most of us, it is well known, have
lost our memories during the War, so
that we have no recollection of what
took place before it. But I met a
man the other day who has preserved
the clearness of his mind. I don't
expect to be believed when I say that
he can recall not only 1913 but 1914;
yet he can ; and he allowed me to
draw him out. It was really a most
remarkable experience.
“I understand,” I began, “that you
are about to publish your memoirs.”
“That is so,” he said. “I fear that
unless I do so the record of social
England in the early teens of the
twentieth century may be utterly lost.”
“Tell me,” I said earnestly. “I so
long to know what life was like then.
Give me some idea of the scope of your
book.”
“It will read like a fairy tale, I fear,”
he replied musingly. “But it is all
true. For instance "—he paused and
lowered his voice—“do you know that





















way, that I had been specially selected
even as late as July, 1914, you could

walk through the streets of London all
day and never see a soldier?”
“Nonsense,” I replied.
“It is true. And you could occasion-
ally find a girl under nineteen who
didn't smoke.”
“No 2"
“And people wore full evening dress
in the stalls.”
“I don't believe it,” I said. “And how
did things go generally? Smoothly?”
“Fairly. The year was marked by
certain functions that were never inter-
rupted. In the early Summer, for ex-
ample, all the world went to Epsom to
see a race called the Derby.”
“Epsom ? Yes, I have heard of
it. There are camps there now. And
hospitals. One on the very top of the
hill, beside a grass track.”
* “Yes, that is where the race was
run. Between horses. Why, I can
remember—it was 1913 or 1912, so
long ago that even my memory is hazy
—being present when a Suffragette
impeded the KING's horse.”
“A Suffragette?”
“Yes, in those days, you know,
women wanted the vote and stopped at
nothing in order to get it. Those who
wanted it were called Suffragettes.
Then there was what was called ‘Cowes
Week,” when all Society flocked to the
Solent to see people race with yachts."
“Yachts 2 ”
“Yes, pleasure-boats. There were
cricket-matches then, too; what was
called first-class cricket was played be-
fore large concourses of people. An
eleven chosen from one county met an
eleven chosen from another county, and
sometimes they played for three whole
days. The Universities also met in the
cricket-field, at a place called Lord's,
in St. John's Wood, once a year.”
“You bewilder me,” I said.
“But I have only just begun,” he
replied. “What do you say, for ex-
ample, when I tell you that you could
get a glass of beer for twopence?”
“Rubbish 1”
“And a whisky and soda for six-
pence?”
“Incredible.”
“And butter was on every table?”
“I simply don't believe it.”
“Some of my most cherished mem-
ories,” he said, “are of meals. In those
days—I refer to the early nineteen-hun-
dreds—there was no lack of food. I
can distinctly recall entering a restau-
rant in Regent Street, ordering a rump
steak and getting it. There were joints
too, from which one could have two or
even three helpings if one wished.”
At this point I believe I must have
fainted, for the next thing that I heard
had no reference to eating at all, but
Sergeant. “Now, THEN, You on THE RIGHT! Don't Fong ET THAT we MARCHES BY THE
LEFT. So KEEP TOUCH WITH THE LEFT, OR YOU'LL BE TRIPPING UP THE TRAMs ' "
“You have no idea,” he was saying,
“how excited people would get over
party politics.”
“What are they like?” I asked. “I
have heard of politics, but not party
politics.”
“Well,” he said, “the country was
divided in those days—I am speaking
now of 1913 and even 1914—between
what were called Unionists and what
were called Liberals or Radicals. To
the Liberal all things done or said by
Unionists were black, and all things
said or done by their own leaders were
white, and vice versä, England was
really an odd country then. Why, I
can remember when the present PRIME
MINISTER said the most awful things
about the very men who are now hon-
oured members of his Government.”
But this was too much for me.
“No, no,” I said. “Don’t tell me any
more. I can't bear it.” And I began
to move off.
“Why, do you know,” he persisted
with all the implacable cheerfulness of
the reminiscent, “do you know—"
But the next moment I was out of
More Iron Rations.
From a report of Mr. MACPHERSoN's
speech on the Army Estimates:—
“The jam rations alone needed for monthly
consumption as much steel as was required to
build a 300-ton ship. They had experimented
successfully, and were now using for this pur-
pose wood pulp board, instead of steel, saving
60 tons of steel a week.”—Yorkshire Post,
From a sale catalogue:— -
“Our ‘Blue Bird’ Crepe-de-Chine Night-
dress, good quality, flesh pink embroidered
blue bird and finished blue ribbons. Actual

Well, you couldn't expect to get all
these colours in a “white sale" without
paying a bit extra.
Controlled Weather.
From a London Bank’s “Yearly
Review,” just published:—
“It must not, however, be overlooked that
in agricultural matters much depends on the

have not failed to take steps to deal with the
situation, and have issued decrees with a view
to increase the output.”
The prospect of having our weather

A RATIONAL EXAMINATION PAPER.
WE understand that it has been decided to allot posts in
the Office of the FooD-CoNTRoller according to the results
of an examination, and we have been able with great diffi-
culty to secure one of the papers recently set. We learn
with considerable gratification that Lord RHONDDA has in
this matter set an excellent example. His Lordship and
Lady RHONDDA at once went in for the examination, and
passed brilliantly in every paper. O şi sic omnes / Here
is a specimen paper:—
1. Show by the application of Grimm's Law to the
Binomial Theorem that the system of rationing by coupons
is (a) necessary, (b) desirable, (c) simple. Give in detail the
points distinguishing the existing British system from the
German and other systems. Do you consider the British
system superior? If not, why not?
2. A City man named Alfred Adamson travels to London
from Surbiton by the 9 A.M. train on a Friday. When he
reaches Waterloo he discovers that he has left his ration
card at home, and telegraphs to his wife requesting her to
send the gardener's boy with the card to his office. State
what in your view are the chances (a) of the gardener's boy
reaching the office, (b) of Mr. Adamson getting any luncheon.
If Mr. Adamson had telephoned, would it have made any
difference? [Note.—In answering this question it is to be
assumed that Mr. Adamson's card has been entirely lost,
by being blown out of Mr. Adamson's dressing-room win-
dow, and that Mrs. Adamson will send her own card by
the gardener's boy. Is this lawful? If not, who should
be punished, and how 2)

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN an admirable introduction to The Lowland Scots Regi-
ments (MACLEHosk) Sir HERBERT MAxwell, complains that
the War Office has systematically maltreated them for
many years. It obliged them to adopt a hybrid uniform,
consisting of Highland doublets and tartan trews, and then
refused to allow them to garrison their own capital, lest
the Southern tourist should be disappointed by the absence
of philabegs and sporrans. His remedy would be to “take
the breeks off" the Lowlanders and clothe all Scottish
regiments in the “garb of old Gael.” They would look
more picturesque, no doubt; but that they would fight any
better no one who reads these stirring pages will be in-
clined to believe. Very wisely the various authors have
confined themselves to the doings of the regiments before
August 1914. Their exploits in the present War will be
recorded in another volume—if indeed one will be sufficient.
For the present campaign has furnished abundant evidence
that the Lowland Scots of to-day are one in spirit with
their gallant forbears. For an example of their discipline
it is sufficient to quote WELLINGTON's statement that not
a single man of the Scots Guards was brought before a
general court-martial during the Peninsular War, and the
almost identical tribute that they earned nearly a century
later in the South African campaign. Of their courage
one story is typical. At Balaclava an excited A.D.C. rode
up to the Colonel of the Scots Greys and told him that “ten
men who dare go anywhere and have no fear” were needed

onians, whose records are contained in this sumptuous
volume. My compliments to all concerned in its produc-
tion, not forgetting Mr. GEORGE KRUGER, whose pictures
in colour of the old uniforms are a pleasant reminder of the
days before “the pomp and panoply of war” had become
a meaningless phrase.
In Martic the Unconquered (MURRAY) Mrs. KATHLEEN
NoFRIs has chosen a simple and almost commonplace
theme, the struggle of an energetic and ambitious girl
towards self-expression, and made of it a very human and
moving record. The upward progress of Martic—not in
worldly prosperity so much as in development of person-
ality—is no unreal affair of “roses all the way.” From the
moment when you first meet her, youngest daughter of a
decayed Californian family, Martie is the born fighter.
Jilted, unworthily mated, threatened with utter ruin,
bereaved, she struggles on, never more than temporarily
daunted, to the end that leaves her fighting still, but placed,
established, the captain of her soul. 1 can praise the
book unreservedly; but I can do no more than hint at the
sense of poise and serenity behind all the stress of the
actual happenings which remains my clearest impression.
Mrs. Norris is scrupulously fair to her.characters. Even
the less worthy are given their share of good, so that they

page; for observation and selection and (to express it in
one word) dignity, I have no hesitation in calling it one of
the best novels that has come to my notice for a great while.
Miss OLIVE WADSLEY's latest novel, rather quaintly
called Nevertheless (CASSELL), is a story about nice affluent
people and nice times; one might also add, in a somewhat
different sense, Nice Goings On—a tale of love and politics
and the romantic emotions, all as these were understood
in the piping days of a decade ago. There is a handsome
hero, who, on learning that his mother is unmarried, behaves
like a cad to her; engages himself to and is jilted by a
smartly objectionable Lady Carolyn; finally taking up with
a middle-aged woman, who, having counted the smart
world well lost for love (how, you may ascertain at first
hand), gets soundly rated by this unheroic swain and
deserted in her turn on the last page. Have I mentioned
the word “smart,” perhaps more than once 2 If so it is
because this remains my prevailing impression of Miss
WADSLEY's well-groomed and slightly waxworky person-
ages (at an emotional crisis it struck me as significant that
throughout uncertain, and even amateurish, to an almost
maddening degree, and yet one has further to admit that,
in the words of a celebrated tribute, she “gets there all the .
same.” Perhaps this is the reward of sincerity; in part it
is certainly due to her feeling for atmosphere. Singing
Sands contains, some pen pictures of Canadian landscape
that are suggested with quite wonderful beauty. I am
bound to repeat, however, that in this crowded episode of
Lyndon's visit to her remarkable relations you may find
the places more attractive than the plot, the setting than
the very unsatisfactory set. Which of course, being precisely
what Miss Fox SMITH intended, is only another proof that,
against every handicap, she has done what I knew she
would, and reached her objective.
Green and Gay (LANE) is an excellently readable little
war-comedy that may commend itself to you even more for
the charm of its mise-en-scène than for the not specially
original thrills of its intrigue. The life at the old Convent
of Paix, converted into a war-hospital, is delightfully told;

When a novelist is modestly content to label his or her
story as “An Episode,” one must of course admit that
criticism is to some extent disarmed. At the same time
I feel bound to observe that any episode that includes in
its tumultuous course a murder, an elopement, a romance,
a desertion, not to specify many other considerable events,
is in some danger of becoming overgrown. All these things
happened during a little visit that Lyndon Travess, the
heroine of Miss C. Fox SMITH's new story, Singing Sands
(HoddRR AND STOUGHTON), paid to some relations who
lived at this spot of the romantic name. It may save you
from the disillusion that awaited Lyndon and myself to
say at once that Singing Sands—the place, not the story—
by no means carries out the exquisite promise of its beauti-
ful title. As for the book itself, that I must confess has
put me into some sort of quandary; I think I should be
inclined to compromise by calling it a good tale badly told.
Miss Fox SMITH's manner seems at times to combine every

Mr. LEE Holt's overwork of the “dropped clue.” The
way in which his conspirators sprinkle the ground with
their most confidential documents seems to suggest either
some lack of invention on the part of the writer, or a
maladresse rare even in the records of the German secret
service. Also I do wish that he would revise his proofs |
(of the novel, not the conspiracy) with greater care.
Twice in the first chapter I had to cope with passages of

gardens or creepy caves could make me wholly forgive.
Another Injustice.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARch 13, 1918.
LETTERS FROM THE HOME FRONT.
MY DEAR REGINALD,-From certain
phrases dropped by you on the eve of
your return from your last leave I
gathered that you had formed curious
misconceptions of the War-conditions
which we are enduring at home. “Well,
old dear,” I overheard you say to your
sister, “there doesn't seem to be much
wrong with England; I've never known
her in better form.” It seems that your
friends had given you a champagne
dinner every night, followed by a revue
or a dance, or both, with a race-meeting
and a day or two with the hounds
thrown in, and you came to the unwar-
rantable conclusion that the War had
left us intact. -
My dear boy, this is all what you would
call camouflage on our part. We put
on a brave face to hide our hearts, for
fear that we should unnerve you by
the exposure of our trials. Apart from
the fatigue which we suffer in the
service of the country we naturally
have no taste for such frivolities and
self-indulgence; but we sacrifice our
own inclinations for the sake of the
dear boys from the Front, who have a
first claim upon us. This means a
constant strain, moral and physical,
for hardly a day passes but what we
have some friend or relative home on
leave, for whom we have to make a
pretence of gaiety.
And this applies not only to Society,
but to those professions, such as that
of the actor or the jockey, whose duty
it is to provide entertainment and re-
creation for our fighting men—a duty
bravely borne but very irksome to those
who are aching to be in the trenches
or to take up some form of work which
would appear to bear a more immediate
relation to the War.
I am sending you a photographic
weekly largely devoted to the recogni-
tion of these sacrificial types. You will
be interested in the full-page portrait
of your cousin Gladys, in a most attrac-
tive tea-gown, with the legend under-
neath, “A BEAUTIFUL WAR-WoRKER.”
She is, perhaps, not looking quite her
best, having over-taxed her strength
with assisting at charity matinées
and visiting Homes for Convalescent
Officers; though, with characteristic
self-effacement, she attributed her air
of fatigue to the fact that she had been
up dancing for six successive nights. I
happened to hear indirectly, for she
would never have confessed it herself,
that she had taken upon her this addi-
tional duty for the sake of a young
friend in the Household Cavalry who
was having a brief respite from Divi-
sional Staff work and stood in sore
So you see, my dear Reginald, you
must not be misled by disguises which
we wear for your sake to keep up your
fighting spirit. Nor has it ever been
consonant with the genius of our race
to advertise its virtues. Noblesse oblige.
The food-restrictions and the shortage
of petrol are begining to tell upon my
figure, a fact to which my tailor drew
attention the other day when taking
my Spring orders. Naturally the
obsession of this World-War absorbs
my mind to the exclusion of trivial
matters such as dress; and it is only
from motives of economy, in view of
the rising prices of clothing material,
that I allow myself to renew my ward-
robe. It enables me also to dispose of
my last year's clothes among the de-
serving poor, a form of charity which
always attracts me by its intimate
personal note.
In consequence of the rationing sys-
tem. I am compelled to dine at home
with regularity, having at a consider-
able sacrifice contributed my meat-
coupons to the family ménage. I miss
my dinner at the Club and that fellow-
ship of congenial spirits of one's own
age and way of thinking which is so
fruitful a source of mutual sustainment
in these dark hours.
I am averse, as you know, from any
change of habit; but the War has
compelled many changes, even heavier
than this, in the ordered tenour of one's
life. In the circumstances I have found
it beneficial to take an extra glass of
port. It stimulates optimism and en-
larges one's outlook. I am sure you
will agree with me that it is the first
duty of a good citizen to employ every
means in his power to preserve and
strengthen his moral.
In conclusion, I have forborne to
dwell upon my personal efforts and
sacrifices. After all, you have your own
responsibilities, scarcely less exigent
than ours. By the time you receive
this letter you may be engaged in de-
livering or repelling an offensive on
which our very existence, yours as well
as mine, may depend. If anything
that I have said should serve to hearten
you with the knowledge of what some
of us, in our quiet unobtrusive way,
are doing on the home front for your
support, I am content.
Your affectionate Guardian,

of the familiar dictum ascribed to Mary
Antony is vividly illustrated by Bismarck's

SPEARMINT.
OUR donkey is called Spearmint, after
the well-known racehorse. I christened
him this myself, to stir his ambition and
give him something to live up to. But
so far his speed limit appears to be four
miles per hour forwards, four and a half
batkwards, and five sideways (right or
left); unless you approach him with a
parsnip or a round of hot buttered toast,
when he makes for you like an overdue
express train.
As donkeys go, Spearmint is really
rather a nut. The prevailing note of
his colour scheme is a warm mahogany,
deepening into old-oak legs. His face
however is a dead-white from the ears
downwards, except for the small jet.
black moustache which by way of
piquant contrast covers his upper lip
and the entrance to his nose. His eyes
are dark and brilliant.
One reason why I am attached to
Spearmint is that, I am sorry for him.
I know (though none of the others
does) that he may at any moment
be taken from us. He is living on
the edge of a volcano, or perhaps I
should say all round a volcano. Some
little while ago he swallowed a bottle
of rat-poison. Why he should have
done such a thing (unless out of sheer
bravado), or how he managed it, I
cannot explain; but the fact, like the
bottle, remains. I can vouch for it,
because I saw him do it. Fortunately
the thing was corked and sealed, and
presumably it is still in the same con-
dition.
I am doing what I can for him. The
obvious thing is to shake the bottle as
little as possible, and so when he starts
out of an afternoon with my wife and
the children my last words to them are
always the same, “Don’t bustle him."
In the execution of this command they
always have his loyal assistance.
So far he has invariably returned in-
tact. I am not sure whether he realises
his position, but occasionally, when I
have taken him out of the trap and
turned him gently into the paddock,
his expression seems very thoughtful
as he strolls to the fence and stands
gazing over it towards the distant hills.
Does he know? I hope not.
“Even according to cautious estimates,
Russia has now to reckon with a loss of terri-
tory comprising over a million square mille-
metres, or double the extent of Germany."

This calculation is, we are afraid, too
cautious. According to the latest in-
formation the extent of Germany is

giving instructions as to when and how

On this occasion I felt through my

drew blank. “What's the matter with
the bird, anyhow 2 " I asked.
“Looks a bit dahn-'earted,” said the
carrier; “dejected-like, as you might

I promised not to, caught up the
basket and fled.
I reached the neighbourhood of the
line at about 2 A.M. It was snowing
hard and the whole front was sugared
over like a wedding-cake, every track
and landmark obliterated. For some
hours I groped about seeking Battalion
H.Q., tripping over hidden wire, tobog-
anning down snow-masked craters into
icy shell-holes, the inimitable Eustace
with me. Finally I fell head-first into
a dug-out inhabited by three ancient
warriors, who were sitting round a
brazier sucking cigarettes. They were

giving me his seat by the fire and a

of their conversation here and there:
“Shall us toast 'im over the brazier a

At length Eustace's circulation was
declared restored and the three set
about harnessing themselves for war,
encasing their legs in sand-bags, wind-
ing endless mufflers round their heads
and donning innumerable odd overcoats,
so that their final appearance was more
that of apple-women than scouts.
We then set out for the battle, Bert
leading the way towards the barrage
which was cracking and banging away
in yellow flashes over the Bosch lines.
Presently we heard a muffled hail
ahead. -
“Wazzermatter, Bert?” Alf shouted.
“They've quit — slung their 'ook,”
came the voice.
Fifty yards brought us bumping up
against Bert, who was prodding through
the débris of a German post with the
point of his bayonet.
“So the swines have beat it 2 ” said
Fred. “Any soovenirs 2"
“Nah!” said Bert, spitting, “not a

“Is this really our objective 2" I
asked. -
“It is, Sir,” Bert replied. “Best sit
down and keep quiet; the rest of the
boys will be along in a jiffy, and they'd

I put my hand in the basket and
dragged Eustace forth. He didn't look

tive was reached, and obedience is
second nature with me. -
I secured my message to his leg,
wished him luck and tossed him high
in the air. A swirl of snow hid him
from view. -
I didn't call at H.Q. when I returned.
I went straight home to bed and stayed
there. As they did not send for me and
I heard no more about it I conjectured
that the infallible Eustace had got back
to his bus and all was well. Never-
theless I had a sort of uneasy feeling
about him. I heard no more of it for
ten days, and then, out walking one
afternoon, I bumped into the pigeon-
fancier. There was no way of avoiding
the man; the lane was only four feet
wide, bounded by nine-foot walls with
glass on top. So I halted opposite him,
smiled my prettiest and asked after
Eustace. “So glad he got home all
right,” said I; “a great bird that.”
The fancier glared at me, his sour
eyes sparkling, his fists opening and
shutting. I felt that only bitter dis-
cipline stood between them and my
throat.
“Ay, Sir,” said he, speaking with
difficulty, “he's a great bird, but not
the bird he was. He got home all right

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MARK IV. LIGHT POCKET
CIGARETTE CASE.
IT was the eve of my oral examina-
tion in the Lewis gun.
I was sitting in my billet with a large
note-book on my lap, testing myself
with questions of “Mechanism,” of
“Points after Firing,” of “General De-
scription”—in fact with all kinds of
questions which might in any way be
connected with the “Light Automatic
:303 inch Lewis Machine Gun.” I was
trying to practise concentration and
hardly looked up when the door opened
and a Staff-Sergeant-Instructor entered
the room. He did not, I think, salute,
though I am sure that his cap was on,
but, producing an oblong cigarette-case
(which, now that I come to think of it,
was, I believe, my own), he arrested
my attention. I had no time to say
anything, for he started off with his
lecture straightaway:—
“'Ere we 'ave the MARK IV. LIGHT
Pocket CIGARETTE CASE. Take it down
in your note-book, please, Sir, under
the heading ‘General Description.' It
is made of aluminium for lightness;

full, 3} ounces. It consists of two
slightly curved hoblong pans—the
HUPPER PAN and the Lower PAN. The
hupper pan is convex and the lower
pan is concave.” -
Here he paused; then with great
emphasis he went on : “The reason

a HINGE and a HAXIS-PIN. The haxis-
pin may be removed with the aid of a

“At the hopposite side of the lower
pan we 'ave a STUD, which protrudes
through a SLOT or cut-away portion
of the lip. It is a matter of hin-differ-
ence which way you call it. This stud
is known as the CATCH-SPRING-HACTUAT-

catch-spring. -
“In order to hactuate the catch-spring

ing stud with the thumb of the right
'and—in this manner; and be sure you
remember, Sir, on the day of the exam-
ination, that in horder to be a good
instructor you must illustrate as well
as demonstrate.
“I now hopen the cigarette-case—so
—and on the hinside of the lip of the
lower pan we see the catch-spring,
which consists of a steel spring RIB and
a PROJECTION which is hundercut.

is fitted to this case. .
“It is 'eld in position by two small

on the right is known as the RIGHT

“Each screw is marked with a num-
ber. One screw is marked with a on E

He paused as though leaving me to
complete the limerick. Without look-
ing up from my note-book I blurted
out “a on E.”
“Wrong and hincorrect, Sir," he re-
plied. “The right catch-spring-rib-
fixing-screw is marked with a Two and
the left catch-spring-rib-fixing-screw is
marked with a ONE.” * *
“Why on earth didn't they mark
them the other way round?” I pro-
tested. -
His answer upheld the oldest tra-
ditions of the Army.
“Because, Sir,” he said, “there was
a Liberal Guv-er-mint in power at the
time. And we will now go on to consider
the projection which is hundercut. It
is dovetailed into the steel spring-rib
and is hundercut in horder to provide
a flange which springs into a corre-
sponding clearance or ree-cess on the
inside of the lip of the hupper pan

right 'and on the catch-spring-hactuat-
ing-stud is released.”
“One minute, Sergeant,” I said;
“what 's that little scratch intended

He hesitated, and for a moment I
thought that I had caught him out,
but only for a moment. “That small
groove, Sir," he replied, with an air of
finality, “is for the Harmourer,” which
of course settled the question.
“The Mark IV. Light Pocket Cigar-
ette-case,” he went on, “contains, when
full, twenty-eight rounds, fourteen
rounds in the hupper pan and fourteen
rounds in the lower pan—twenty-eight
in hall. Each pan is provided with a
strip of Mark VII. RussiaN SILK ELAS-
Tic, which holds the rounds in position.

in one hand, holding it open, and
started to shake it—gently at first, then
more and more violently. Apparently
some of the rounds refused to be shaken
out, and, losing all control of him-
self, he banged the cigarette-case on
the table; even my chair seemed to
vibrate.
Then at last I opened my eyes.
Russell was standing over me shaking
my shoulder. . .
“You’ve been snoozing, old dear,”
he said. “Get a move on or it will be
midnight before you've finished your
notes. Have a gasper?”
He drew a cigarette-case from his
pocket as he spoke.
“Thanks,” F. looking at it sus-
piciously; “I prefer a pipe.”
THE PLEASURES AND PAINS OF MEMORY.
THE correspondence on “Facial
Memory” in The Spectator seems to
have infected our readers also. At
least this seems to be the only expla-
nation of the budget of letters bn the
subject which Mr. Punch has lately
received and from which he publishes
the following selection:—
THE PREDom INANT FEATURE.
Much Boreham, Herts.
SIR,--It is an interesting question in
connection with facial memory which
feature impresses itself most deeply on
the recollection. Personally I am in-
clined to give the preference to the
nose. This may be due to the fact
that my own family is remarkable for
the prominence of that organ. Indeed
I had an uncle, a well-known entomo-
logist, whose nose was so long and set
at such a peculiar angle that he could
not smoke a cigarette without burning
the tip. He was a bachelor, a man of
considerable means, and I never forgot
him. The colour of people's eyes I
rarely notice, but I find a squint a de-
cided assistance to memory. Thus I
recognised an old schoolfellow who was
afflicted in this way after an interval of
upwards of forty years. But I ought
to add that he also had a pronounced
nose and a game leg. Voices, again, I
seldom forget. Jowett's voice, as I
have noticed in my Conversations with
Celebrities (Vol. III. page 289), was of
a cheerful chirping timbre that at once
arrested the ear, and his nose too,
though not pronounced, was character-
istic (see page 294). Indeed I cannot
help thinking that it would be a safer
method for our police to take impres-
sions of the noses of criminals than to
rely on finger-prints. But as I have
dealt exhaustively with this subject in
my Luminous Lucubrations (Vol. IV.
Mark I. pattern is shorter in length

Emperor's Gate, S.W.
SIR,--I much sympathize with those
whose memory for faces plays them
false, having long suffered from this
defect. It is not that I forget faces (in
this respect my memory is truly royal)
but that I am unable to pigeon-hole
their owners. For example, I remember
meeting a smartly-dressed man in Pall
Mall years ago whose face was perfectly
familiar. As he showed symptoms of
recognition I stopped and shook hands
with him, when to my horror it turned
out that it was my tailor, to whom at
the time I owed a rather heavy bill. I
am bound to say that he seemed even
more embarrassed than I was ; but I
don't think that tailors ought to fre-
quent Pall Mall during the daylight.
Yours faithfully,
A STRANGE STORY.
The Oaks, Gullingham.
SIR,--This correspondence on the
subject of memory is most interesting.
Perhaps you will allow me to contribute
an experience of my own. As a rule,
my memory for names and faces is
excellent, but it is subject to occasional
lapses. For example a few years ago
a young man accosted me in the street
as I was leaving my house, reminding
me that he had once been in my service
as a boot-boy. He knew my name,
though I had forgotten all about him,
and asked my assistance to enable him
to pay his railway fare to Gloucester,
where his father was lying dangerously
ill. I lent him a sovereign, which he
promised to repay me; but from that
day to this I have never heard from or
of him. Strange to say I found that
he had told a similar story to several
other residents in the neighbourhood.
As his narrative was most circumstan-
tial and his manner convincing, it has
ing from a lapse of memory, although
his last words to me were that he would
never forget my kindness.
I am, Sir, yours truly,
SAMUEL Swallow.
“LEST we REMEMBER.”
Look-ahead Institute,
794, Kingsway.
SIR,-Most contributors to this corre-
spondence proceed on the assumption
that a good memory is a blessing and
a thing to be cultivated. Personally I
am of opinion that it is far more im-
portant for success in life to cultivate
the art of judicious oblivion. As the
poet says, “'Tis madness to remem-
ber, 'Tis wisdom to forget.” Acting on
this view I have organised a School of
Scientific Forgetfulness. Full particu-
lars will be sent on application to me
at the subjoined address; but I may
say that my main aim is to disburden
the mind of useless knowledge and to

SIR,--I much sympathize with those
whose memory for faces plays them
false, having long suffered from this
defect. It is not that I forget faces (in
this respect my memory is truly royal)
but that I am unable to pigeon-hole
their owners. For example, I remember
meeting a smartly-dressed man in Pall
Mall years ago whose face was perfectly
familiar. As he showed symptoms of
recognition I stopped and shook hands
with him, when to my horror it turned
out that it was my tailor, to whom at
the time I owed a rather heavy bill. I
am bound to say that he seemed even
more embarrassed than I was ; but I
don't think that tailors ought to fre-
quent Pall Mall during the daylight.
Yours faithfully,
A STRANGE STORY.
The Oaks, Gullingham.
SIR,--This correspondence on the
subject of memory is most interesting.
Perhaps you will allow me to contribute
an experience of my own. As a rule,
my memory for names and faces is
excellent, but it is subject to occasional
lapses. For example a few years ago
a young man accosted me in the street
as I was leaving my house, reminding
me that he had once been in my service
as a boot-boy. He knew my name,
though I had forgotten all about him,
and asked my assistance to enable him
to pay his railway fare to Gloucester,
where his father was lying dangerously
ill. I lent him a sovereign, which he
promised to repay me; but from that
day to this I have never heard from or
of him. Strange to say I found that
he had told a similar story to several
other residents in the neighbourhood.
As his narrative was most circumstan-
tial and his manner convincing, it has
ing from a lapse of memory, although
his last words to me were that he would
never forget my kindness.
I am, Sir, yours truly,
SAMUEL SWALLow.

SIR,-Most contributors to this corre-
spondence proceed on the assumption
that a good memory is a blessing and
a thing to be cultivated. Personally I
am of opinion that it is far more im-
portant for success in life to cultivate
the art of judicious oblivion. As the
poet says, “'Tis madness to remem-
ber, 'Tis wisdom to forget.” Acting on
this view I have organised a School of
Scientific Forgetfulness. Full particu-
lars will be sent on application to me

say that my main aim is to disburden

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 4th. —In moving
that a grant of twenty-five thousand
pounds be made to the widow of Sir
STANLEY MAUDE the PRIME MINISTER
paid a noble tribute to this very perfect
gentle knight who, after deeds that
restored the Nation's faith in itself, fell
a victim to his own chivalry. The
motion was approved memine contradi-
cente, Mr. SNowden being nobody.
My congratulations to Lieutenant-
Colonel WILL THoRNE on his new rank
and to the 1st Battalion Essex Volun-
teers on having a C.O. who, in addition
to other merits, has a voice that should
be the envy of the sergeants' mess.
The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE was
much heckled regarding the shortage
of pigs, and when told that not a single
sty should be left unfilled, was under-
stood to say that that depended more
upon the sows in the country than
upon the bores at Westminster. The
House had a further proof of Mr.
PROTHERO's practical knowledge of
farming when, in alluding to the relax-
ation of local by-laws, he casually re-
marked that “no man minds the smell
of his own pig.”
Tuesday, March 5th. — Of all the
Members of the House the last I should
have suspected, primd facie, of sym-
pathy with Bolshevism is Mr. MoRRELL,
who is the brother-in-law of a Duke
and dresses the part to perfection. But
Pacifism, like Poverty, introduces one to
strange associates, and Mr. MoRRELL,
it appears, has in public meeting
advised the British proletariat to adopt
Russian methods. But if he wants to
be taken seriously he must grow a
beard d la LENIN and eschew clean
collars and soap.
It was, of course, very ungenerous of
Mr. LYNCH and Mr. PRINGLE to com-
plain that Sir ERIC GEDDEs was read-
ing his speech, and the SPEAKER was
quite right in rebuking them. All the
same I think the FIRST Lord, who can
make a very good speech if he cares to,
would find that his statements of naval
policy would gain in effectiveness if he
trusted more to his memory and less
to his manuscript.
For one Parliamentary innovation,
however, he deserves our thanks, and
that was the exhibition of an immense
diagram, illustrating the downward
tendency of the U-boat depredations.
There are other orators who might
with advantage imitate this method.
In fact there are some whose speeches
would be more enjoyable if they were
all diagrams.
The best news that Sir ERIC had to
impart was that the Allies have at last
naval as well as military policy; the
worst was that owing to labour troubles
(for I didn't gather that he attributed
any blame to Admiralty methods of
dealing with the shipbuilding trade) our
output had fallen far below last year's
record.
THE ENVY OF THE SERGEANTS’ MEss.
LT.-COL. WILL THORNE.
Wednesday, March 6th.-Visitors
who repaired to the Upper House in
the hope of hearing some brilliant
epigrams from Lord RIBBLESDALE, who
sought a return of the Government's
“semi-ministerial, semi-departmental,
and semi-official” appointments, had
first to sit through a debate on the
important but seldom exhilarating topic
of foot-and-mouth disease. This de-
ERIC; OR, LITTLE BY LITTLE.
“There's as bad fish in the sea as ever came
out of it.”
pressing prelude may have taken the
sparkle out of Lord RIBBLESDALE, who
was not nearly so sprightly as usual.
In fact the best joke of the afternoon
came from Lord HYLTON, who on behalf
of the Government refused to give the
return because it would use up too
much paper.
On this subject Parliament is waking
up. In the Commons complaint was
made that a pamphlet published by the
Board of Agriculture contained two
pages of complimentary matter, and
Sir R. WINFREY promised that such a
lapse from official frigidity should not
occur again. In future the motto of
the departments will be that of the
Dictionary of National Biography, “No
flowers, by request.” ".
Like all popular assemblies the House
of Commons passes rapidly from mood
to mood. Members of all parties were
plunged in sadness this afternoon by
the untimely death of John REDMoND,
snatched away just when his distracted
country most needed his moderating
influence. Of the many tributes paid
to his memory none was more moving
than the few simple words in which
Sir Edward CARson told of a friend-
ship begun when they went on the
Leinster circuit together and lasting
unshattered by all the storms of poli-
tical controversy.
Within an hour Sir Edward was the
centre of a very different scene. Chal-
lenged to say whether he approved of
the supersession of Lord JELLIcoe he
startled the House by the revelation
that, though a member of the War
Cabinet at the time, he had never been
consulted on the subject, and that he
considered it “a national calamity.” Sir
CHARLEs SEELY was not expressing a
solitary view when he said, “May I ask
whether there is any Government?”
From Mr. BonAR LAw we learned
that there is a Government, but that it
is not considered necessary to consult
it over such trivialities as the appoint-
ment of the director of our naval
strategy. That is a matter solely for
the civilian who happens to be First
Lord, who may, however, and in this
instance did, take the opinion of an-
other civilian who happens to be Prime
Minister.
Thursday, March 7th.-Mr. BYRNE
seemed to be disappointed to learn
that in Ireland (where Mr. DUKE has
been engaged in teaching the young
idea not to shoot) no prisoners are now
being forcibly fed, and that those who
refuse to take food have to take the
consequences instead. He does not
approve of these substitutes.
That indefatigablesleuthhound, Major
HUNT, scored a notable triumph. His

Even in these days a Vote of Credit
for six hundred millions is rather a
large dose to swallow at a single gulp,
but Mr. Box AR LAw sugar-coated his
pill with the explanation that it would
enable the House to have a long holiday
at Whitsuntide. As he also announced
a slight but welcome diminution in the
daily rate of expenditure, and furnished
a candid but, on the whole, encouraging
account of the position on our numer-
ous fronts, there was little criticism,
and the Vote was carried just in time

PEOPLE who say that there is any
lack of enterprise in the thousand-and-
one Ministries of economy and propa-
ganda are wofully out of it. Energy
is conspicuous everywhere. An idea
of the thoroughness with which the
Food-Control authorities are doing their
job may be gathered by a few extracts
from the advance proofs of a series of
new versions of favourite tales for
children which are about to be issued
on the principle that you cannot catch
the mind too tender. -
We do not quote the stories in full,
but merely those parts where the hand
of the FooD-CoNTRoller has fallen
heaviest. Here, for example, is a vital
passage from the revision of
“Little Red Riding-Hood":—
“Now, Riding-Hood,” said her mother,
“I want you to take this basket of eat-
ables over to your grannie's.”
“What have you put into it, mother?”
asked the little girl.
“There's a pound of butter, a dozen
eggs and six sausages,” was the reply.
“But, my dear mother,” exclaimed
the child, “have you not read about
rations? This is a very unpatriotic and
dangerous proceeding.”
“Nonsense !” said her mother; “the
only danger is the Wolf.”
Riding-Hood, “I consider the Wolf as
comparatively negligible. What I fear
is Lord RHONDDA. My conscience also
forbids me to contravene the regula-
tions.”
“Bless you, my daughter!” said her
mother. “What a treasure you are
I was only testing your character and
now I am satisfied.” -
And with these words Iittle Red
Riding-Hood was presented with a new
shilling, a beautiful doll and a packet
of Lupicide. J
A somewhat similar motive is to be
found in the next extract:—
From the new “Hansel and Gretel.”
The two hungry children were walk-
ing hand-in-hand in the dark forest.
At length they saw in front of them a
clearing among the trees.
“A house!” cried Hansel; and they
both began to run towards it.
“Such a curious little cottage,” they
exclaimed when they came near it.
In a few minutes they had reached
it, and Gretel, struck by something odd
about the appearance of it, touched the
wall with her hand. “Why, it's built
of cake,” she cried delightedly.
“And the roof is made of butter-
scotch,” said her brother as he broke
off a piece. “And it's good too,” he
added as well as he could with his
mouth too full.

left them. Then, being well brought
up, they began to reflect that perhaps
they were doing wrong. “No, little
sister,” said Hansel gravely, “we will
not go to the front-door. This is food-
hoarding—a crime against the State.”
“Yes,” said Gretel, “and peculiarly
ingenious too, for who would think of

DEEDS THAT OUGHT TO WIN THE V.C.
THE SUB-LIEUTENANT TAKES THE ADMIRAL's QUEEN.
THE FAMILY MOTTO.
“Ab uno disce omnes,” remarked the
Adjutant, who had been examining
some German prisoners and was dis-
coursing on the manners of the Bosch.
In the old days, when we despised
margarine and matches, the Adjutant
was a classical master at a public school,
and he still talks, as the Colonel once
told him, “like the end pages of the
dictionary.”
“Your knowledge of Latin makes
you the best misunderstood man in
the division,” observed the Captain.
“Yesterday, for example, my orderly
asked me where Quoante was, and what
it had to do with the War. That
floored me, but on making inquiries I
found he had heard you remark that
we seemed to be fighting now chiefly
to restore the status quo ante. He was
under the impression that you said the
• State of Quoante,' and thought the
place must be one of the South Ameri-
can Republics.
“The Sergeant-Major, by the way,
seems to think your Latin tags are an
original form of swearing. It would be
a revelation to you, old chap, to hear
him freely interpreting them to de-
faulters. And you should notice the
are talking like a Roman senator. Re-
minds me of young Fudge, who hadn't
enough Latin to enable him to trans-
late his family motto.
“Fudge, in spite of his unhappy
name, was quite a nice lad, the son of a
Midland manufacturer who had adapted
his plant to make aeroplane parts in-
stead of household ironmongery; and
soon after the youngster joined us as a
subaltern his father got a knighthood
because he paid such a lot of excess
profits tax. With the knighthood he
promptly acquired from the College of
Heralds a coat-of-arms and a family
motto—of the “canting" kind, in
Latin, of course.
“The fellow who prepared the motto
must have been a bit of a humourist,
and he took advantage of old Fudge's
ignorance of Latin to explain that its
meaning was, “Death has no fears for a
Fudge.’ The old chap wrote to his son
—his stationery was embellished with
the new coat-of-arms—urging him to
memorise the motto and say it when he
found himself in a tight corner. Young
Fudge, as I have said, had no Latin,
but he got the family motto by heart,
and always used it when he was just
about to go over the top. The men of
his platoon thought it was a prayer or
some of them even took to shouting it
themselves as they went into action.
The Bosches must have revised their
opinion of British culture when they
heard our men bawling Latin, and they
usually bolted like rabbits.
“That motto certainly seemed to
inspire Fudge. He did well, was twice
mentioned in despatches, got his second
pip, and was awarded the M.C. Then
one night in Mess, when in an expan-
sive mood he quoted his family motto,
‘Melius fugere quam mori,’ another
man told him that it meant ‘'Tis better
to fly than to die’; and poor Fudge
crumpled up.”
“Your moral seems to be that ignor-
ance of Latin is a good thing,” re-
marked the Adjutant. “But in the
end it let him down badly.”
“Not at all,” responded the Captain.
“When he recovered from the shock
he had an inspiration. Under the im-
pression that “fugere’ indicated flight
through the air, he transferred to the
Flying Corps, and now flaunts his
family motto with greater conviction
than ever.”

The E. of A. Oh, you've been very kind to me, you
know, in initiating me into the deepest secrets of state-

came over me. But you're quite sure you don't mind?
The G. E. Quite sure. (Aside) What is he driving at 2
(Aloud) And shall we now begin our lecture?
The E. of A. Yes, Uncle, directly. But first, as your
dutiful nephew, I want to tell you something which struck
me as rather witty. Mind you stop me if you've heard it.
The G. E. I own I don't much care for witty strokes.
The E. of A. No, I know you don't. But you're sure to
like this one. It's really funny, and made me laugh a
good deal.

The E. of A. Yes, I know. Well, they say about him

The G. E. I wish I could think so.
The E. of A. You don't quite mean that, do you, Uncle?
Because, you know, if he were alive I should not be where
I am, and you and I would not be holding sweet converse
together. -
The G. E. Oh, in that sense of course I did not mean it.
But proceed with your witty stroke.
The E. of A. Well, they say in Vienna that our revered
FRANCIS Joseph is not dead, but that he sold his soul to
you in order to be young again, and that I, the Emperor
CHARLEs, am not myself but am only a continuation of
FRANCIS Joseph, and that some day you will fetch me
away with an army of little goblins. Ha! haſ But I see
you don't laugh. -
The G. E. Laugh, indeed! How should a German
Emperor laugh when he finds himself compared to Mephis-
topheles 2 For that is what it comes to.
The E. of A. How clever of you to see it at once! But
I am sorry you don't think it funny. It really means that
you are the devil of a fellow, and that I am only the slave
of your will. If I don't mind I don't see why you should.
But some people never get accustomed to our Viennese
lightheartedness. -
The G. E. (aside). A strange idea of lightheartedness
this young man seems to have. (Aloud) I must find out
if there is any witty story about you in Berlin, so that I
may tell it to you. . * * -

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
PERCEIVING that Simple Souls (CASSELL) was going to
amuse me, I said to myself that I would turn down the
corner of any page that held a specially quotable or enter-
taining passage—a practice, I hasten to add, only permis-
sible to the reviewer. Somewhere towards the end of
chapter two, however, I abandoned this plan. Moderation,
even in dog's-ears, must be observed. The fact is that
Mr. John HASTINGs TURNER has, as befits a dramatist, an
aptitude for “lines” that makes Simple Souls one of the
most titillating stories that I have met for a very long
time. I wish I could add that the tale is as credible as it
is amusing; but I think that even Mr. TURNER can hardly
have hoped for many souls so simple as to believe in the
idealistic Duke of Wynningham and his quixotic union with
a daughter of the people to whom he had once given tea at
the Zoological Gardens. But despite this unreality some
quality of a whimsical fairy-tale beauty in the drawing of
the two chief characters, and, above all, Mr. TURNER's gift
of fantastic dialogue, give the book an appeal greater than
anything that its improbable scheme would suggest. I am
not saying that the wit, admirable as it is, does not some-
times get a little in the way of the story. The epigrammatic
facility of almost every character may prompt a suspicion
that they are only Mr. TURNER himself in different dis-
guises; I say almost every character, for there is one excep-
tion at least in the Duchess's alcoholic father, a tiny portrait
of admirable fidelity and observation. Now and again the
the result that some wildly audacious mot leaves the reader
so dissolved in happy laughter as to be forgetful of the
situation. But as an irresponsible entertainment Simple
Souls remains a notable and indeed brilliant success.
Though Mulberry Springs (UNwiN) is officially, and no
doubt in fact, a first novel, I believe I am right in saying
that its author, Miss MARGARET Storrs TURNER, is no
novice in publication. She has now proved that she can
write a very agreeable comedy of intrigue, which would be
more than twice as good if it were rather less than half as
long. When Marie Louise was so abruptly deserted by
her fascinating father, on their way to the English home
that she had never seen, I looked forward (encouraged by
this excellent start) to a book full of the most entertaining
adventures. But somehow, when the now impecunious
heroine had been installed, under an alias, as social
organizer to the rising health-resort of Mulberry Springs,
most of the pleasant possibilities of the situation seemed
to melt away in floods of not very interesting talk. To
be mistaken first for a princess, then for an adventuress,
seemed an insufficiently distinguished fate for so altogether
charming a heroine. And by the time we passed to more
strenuous happenings, not without drama, I have to con-
fess that the verbosity of everyone had begun to get a little
on my nerves. “I think you have the gift of springing
straight into the middle of things, without troubling about
the beginning or thinking of the end,” the mother of Marie
Louise said to her. I have to repeat the same criticism
to Miss TURNER, with a regret that, once in the middle

ever, she has already by nature; brevity will come by art,
| and fulfil in a second novel (I hope) the promise of her first.
If you are an enthusiast for action untrammelled by the
probabilities, The Man of Silver Mount (CAssell) is just
the book for you. Never, I venture to say, has hero wrung
from a modest allowance of time and space a tithe of
the adventures, hairbreadth escapes, desperate encounters,
bolts from the blue and gods from the machine that young
Harry Diron, its hero, enjoys. From the moment that
the good ship Dunbar sinks beneath the wave, leaving him
at the mercy of the elements and a couple of blood-
thirsty Mexicans, life for him may be described as one
continuous vaudeville. Far be it from me to do Mr. MAx
PEMBERTON the disservice of telling you how Silver Mount,
an island of the blest in the middle of the Atlantic, came to
be inhabited by the old Man and his band of desperados.
These and the cockatoos are -
but a few of the objects of
interest to be encountered in

still in the thick of it. When
the German fleet arrives (sub-
sequent to August, 1914) and
prepares to massacre every-
body, Master Diron, reinforced
by an American detective, re-
mains in active eruption.
Finally, when the British fleet
appears and obliterates the
enemy, he is to be found
assisting at the obsequies.
And as it is patently impossi-
ble for anything to happen to
the British fleet there is no-
thing left for it but that every-
thing and everybody should
end happily, everybody, that is,

The Lynwood Affair (HUTCHINsoN) “another of those

tery it is, but of such an anaemic kind that very little excite-
ment is to be had out of it. Lady Lynwood, who for sub-
stantial reasons was unpopular with the family into which
she had married, died suddenly in her bed about 3.30 A.M.,
and on the same date and with equal abruptness her hus-
band died in a railway carriage at 3.45 A.M. Hence com-

predeceased his wife; but he failed—to my great satisfaction,
for he really was a prince of bounders. Still I have a
grievance against Miss SILBERRAD for making me more
interested in Syd's failure than in anyone's success. And
that in a book of this genre is not quite right. Where, as
always, Miss SILBERRAD triumphs is in the drawing of
character and in easy natural dialogue. I wish she would
leave mysteries to writers of less distinction.
Dixon Scott already has an enduring memorial in his
posthumous volume of brilliant studies of Men of Letters,
to which the versatile and appreciative MAX contributed a
preface. Follows a friend—Mr. BERTRAM SMITH-with a
sheaf of the young soldier-journalist's thoughts on A Number
of Things (Foulis). This handsome book betrays the fact
that for all his skill in the handling of words he was better
journalist than essayist. His essays seem to miss the calm
reflective mood. They are restless, crammed full of good
T things, be it admitted, but still
crammed, uneasy and over-
elaborate. But a too vivid im-
agination is a fault rare enough
: to count as a very considerable
virtue, and it is here found in
conjunction with a capacity
for taking exquisite pains.
| And Scott could see. Perhaps
; the best instance of this power
is the uncannily perceptive
“Motoring by Night”—though
I would hazard that this would
# be by no means his own fav-
ourite. He would no doubt have
preferred those studies of the
country by the ecstatic towns-
man which seem a little unreal.

I wish to treat Problems of
the Peace (ALLEN AND UNwiN)
with scrupulous fairness, but I
confess that it contains hardly
|an argument that does not
leave me violently uncon-
vinced. The writer, WILLIAM
HARBUTT DAwson, is an ex-
ponent of the “concessional”
school at (I should suppose)
its highest development. Be-
ginning with some admirable
- __' generalities about the world's
need of a peace, founded, not on treaties, but ideals, he
proceeds to elaborate this theory into a policy that in-
volves the concession to Germany of practically all the
points at issue. If, therefore, you retain any lingering
hopes of punishment for brutal aggression you must pre-
pare, under Mr. DAwson's tuition, to shed them now, or else
leave the book severely alone. When a writer heads almost
all his chapters with a quotation from RICHARD Cobden it
can hardly astonish anyone to find the contents of those
chapters fiercely antagonistic to the “economic weapon.”
The author happens also to be gently impartial on the sub-
ject of Alsace-Lorraine, and sympathetic towards the Impe-
rial aims of all Empires but our own. I hope I am not unfair,
for example, in taking Mr. DAwson's attitude towards the
German Colonies, which he would, of course, return practi-
cally en bloc, as typical of a policy that would not only
hasten to “grasp the blood-stained hand,” but tactfully
press into it a substantial honorarium. It is, I confess,

DILEMMA OF AN ANTI-PATRIOT.
WHEN Britain first at their command
Who swear by Jingo's name was
led on - - -
Against my wish to take a hand
In Europe's ghastly Armageddon,
I urged with all my vocal powers
That this was no affair of ours.
Though Germany's aggressive views
I could not greet with acclamation,
In taking sides one has to choose
One's own or else the other nation ;
And I've contended all along
That England always must be wrong.
And when they talked of Teuton shame,
Of Belgium butchered by the enemy,
I called for proofs, reserved my blame,
And would not let these tales en-
Venom me, - -
Or change the burden of my song
That England anyhow was wrong.
* -
She claimed to follow Freedom's ways
And do to death the foe that barred
'em ; -
I pointed, in a pregnant phrase,
To Liberty in league with Tsardom
What were we doing in this galley 2
And none could face that crushing sally.
At length the Bolsheviks appeared,
Standing as Russia's liberators;
I waved my cap in air and cheered
These noble self-determinators;
On peace-at-any-price I found
Their attitude was very sound.
And now my two loves fight like cats,
And I between am torn asunder,
Not knowing which to shout for—
that 's
The horrid doubt I'm labouring
under; -
Which am I (both can't well be right),
Pro-German or Pro-Trotskyite 2
THE WATCH DOGS.
LXXI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Oh, what a
tangled web! First I disguise myself in
khaki, grow a bristling moustache and
a tapering waist and pretend to be a
soldier; and then, when I am really
beginning to deceive everybody, includ-
ing myself, I am thrust into a gent's
winter suiting and a soft hat and have
to pretend to be a quite harmless
civilian. And now I ask myself, what
am I really 2 War is indeed an odd
thing and plays queer tricks with a
man. If they gave me a sou'-wester
and a torpedo and told me to push off
and be a sailor, I've got to such a state
that I'd do it and ask no questions—
except about pay and allowances.
It is a most peculiar thing, but all
have large flapping ears. . There is in
our own hostel a peculiarly long-eared
young man, dressed just like a gentle-
man, who has come to sit at the next
table, in order to hear all about it.
I say some very indiscreet things about
my pay; and I'm quite sure he is re-
porting to his chiefs, who sit at the
other end of the room and pretend they
don't know him, that there is a growing
discontent among officers in the British
Army as to their financial position, and
that a mutiny on the subject may be
expected at any moment. * -
He is a most fascinating lad, and I
can hardly take my eyes off him ; I
notice that whenever he is near a mirror
he can hardly take his eyes off himself.
He never realised he could look so pleas-
ing to the eye until the Central Powers
dressed him up to impress Neutral
States; and now he knows that he is
a blond Teuton god; he can tell by the
crease in his trousers. As for us, it is
pathetic to see how he and his country-
men work themselves up to scowl at
us. An American here, who was in
Berlin till the split, says he told the
Germans what is their trouble; they
are just in love with the English, and
it is their pique which makes them
carry on so. Upon my word, I am
not so sure he was wrong, and maybe
their animosity now is nothing to what
their clinging affection will be later on.
For myself, I prefer the animosity;
one sees the Austrians here getting the
other thing, and it appears to give no
inner satisfaction. I have one of them
under my notice who belongs to the
breed of arch-nut, the kind that evokes
that telling phrase of the novelist,
“spotless evening dress.” You know
what I mean. When I put on a stiff
shirt it is only to find that there is one
more laundry-woman gone mad; and
it takes a couple of steel clamps, with
a series of nuts and bolts, to hold the
two halves together, even in the middle,
where there used to be a soft job for a
small pearl stud. Then there is always
the other fellow, who gives you the
idea that in his life there are no such
things as laundry-women at all, and he
starts new, all over and through, every
evening. That is our splendid Austrian,
even more spick than he is span. He
has to submit to being surrounded by
all his overdressed allies, who will
shake his hand and won't take the
bands off their cigars before smoking
same. Us it amuses, but our American
friends can hardly sit still and do no-
thing about it. Terrible people for get-
ting to business, these U.S.A. fellows.
“Can't we steal their grease-cards.”
they say, “and watch them disappear
gradually 2” --
am sure I can't say. You know how
unpopular we always say we English
are when we get abroad 2 Yes, it is
just possible we are a little conserva-
tive, a shade too critical of anything
which happens to differ from our own
idea. But anyhow we don't bluster,
and I have the feeling that we are not
nearly so unpopular as the other fellows.
The other day there was an affair in a
teashop. Two Prussian gents, thinking
they'd got nothing but a small woman
up against them, started on the Domi-
nators - of-the-Universe tack. They
shouted for coffee and cursed the maid
audibly when she failed to bring milk
with it. And when she did bring the
milk they cursed even more noisily at
her attempts to take the sugar away.
She pointed out that, owing to laws and
wars and submarines and things, you
couldn't have milk and sugar in the
same coffee in that place these hard
times. So they did one of their big
offensives on her, and when they ||
thought they'd knocked all the life out
of her they got up and said they
wouldn't have anything more to do
with the coffee or the milk or the
sugar or anything else in the place, not
even the bill. - -
But, making to go, they forgot abou
the door porter, a large quiet prize-
fighter. He just barred their way,
tapped one of them on the shoulder and
said, quite nicely and amicably, “Now,
you just go back and pay for your
coffee.” The Prussian is as much diplo-
mat as soldier; he knows when to fight
and, again, he knows when not to fight.
In this case he returned and paid for
his coffee and came back to the door
again. But the natives of this place are
very methodical and orderly of mind;
they like to see things done neatly and
completely. The porter wasn't for let-
ting them go just yet. “Now look here,”
he said, almost affectionately this time,
“you just go back and drink your
coffee.” And, by HINDENBURG, they
did. Yours ever, HENRY.

OUR GREATEST NEED.
IT will be remembered that, under
the heading of “A Grave Warning,” a
leading organ of the Press recently
issued this momentous announcement:
“It is hoped to reduce the output of
the to one hundred and twenty
thousand copies daily, whereby a saving
of about five tons of paper per diem
will be effected. If this reduction is
not effected within a reasonable period
after Monday next, March 11th, when
the increase in price takes place, it will
be necessary to adopt a drastic ration-
ing system, whereby the can only
be supplied to those whose need is
greatest.” -
As might have been expected, the
demand to be enrolled among the fav-
oured one hundred and twenty thousand
was so terrific that the rationing sys-
tem had to be adopted forthwith and a
Need Ministry appointed to decide con-
flicting claims. -
At the first meeting of the Need Board
on Wednesday last the first case that
came up for hearing was that of the
Archbishop of CANTERBURY, who applied

George. You promised to tell us
more about the revival of pig-keeping,
Mamma. -
Mrs. M. Yes, and I will keep my
promise. The pig, my dear children,
is a very remarkable animal, and has
not always received fair treatment from
mankind. Some races, as you are
doubtless aware, hold it in positive ab-
horrence. Others, while freely availing
themselves of its many useful qualities,
do not hesitate to revile the animal
itself; and even the English are not
free from reproach in this respect. .
Ičichard. Yes, Mamma; only yester-
day Papa called Mary a “greedy little
pig" when she asked for a third help-
ing of pudding.
Mrs. M. That only shows how deeply
this prejudice has spread, for your
father, as you know, is a most humane
and tolerant man. And yet pigs are
not wanting in intelligence. Indeed
the old hostility was considerably
modified by the appearance from time
to time of learned pigs, who were able
to tell the time, do simple sums in
arithmetic and even spell out sentences
in answer to questions. -
Mary. Oh, Mamma, do give me a
learned pig for my next birthday pre-
sent
Mrs. Mſ. I will consider it with your
father. But to resume. Pigs are not
merely intelligent but highly palatable.
Perhaps no animal provides meat so
widely varied in flavour. Pork, bacon,
ham, brawn, sausages have all qualities
of their own.
George. Yes, Mamma; but are saus-
ages always made from pig 2
Mrs. M. My dear boy, strange stories
are told of the ingredients used by un-
scrupulous manufacturers, but in this
household, at any rate, sausages are
above suspicion.
Mary. Mamma, why do we always
have sausages for breakfast on Sunday?
Mrs. M. That is a question, Mary,
hardly in accordance with the dignity
of our subject, though your father may
be able to throw light on the prevalence
of this curious custom. As I was say-
ing, pigs gradually came to establish
themselves in popular favour in the
reign we are now discussing, owing to
the shortage of imported meat. Indeed
their value was so generally recog-
nised that a Ministry of Pig-Production
was created, and the first holder of that
office showed such a patriotic sense
of his responsibilities that, being the

CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER LXXXIII.
George. You promised to tell us
more about the revival of pig-keeping,
Mamma. - -
Mrs. M. Yes, and I will keep my
promise. The pig, my dear children,
is a very remarkable animal, and has
not always received fair treatment from
mankind. Some races, as you are
doubtless aware, hold it in positive ab-
horrence. Others, while freely availing
themselves of its many useful qualities,
do not hesitate to revile the animal
itself; and even the English are not
free from reproach in this respect. .
Ičichard. Yes, Mamma; only yester-
day Papa called Mary a “greedy little
pig" when she asked for a third help-
ing of pudding.
Mrs. M. That only shows how deeply
this prejudice has spread, for your
father, as you know, is a most humane
and tolerant man. And yet pigs are
not wanting in intelligence. Indeed
the old hostility was considerably
modified by the appearance from time
to time of learned pigs, who were able
to tell the time, do simple sums in
arithmetic and even spell out sentences
in answer to questions.
Mary. Oh, Mamma, do give me a
learned pig for my next birthday pre-
sent
Mrs. Mſ. I will consider it with your
father. But to resume. Pigs are not
merely intelligent but highly palatable.
Perhaps no animal provides meat so
widely varied in flavour. Pork, bacon,
ham, brawn, sausages have all qualities
of their own.
George. Yes, Mamma; but are saus-
ages always made from pig 2
Mrs. M. My dear boy, strange stories
are told of the ingredients used by un-
scrupulous manufacturers, but in this
household, at any rate, sausages are
above suspicion.
Mary. Mamma, why do we always
have sausages for breakfast on Sunday?
Mrs. M. That is a question, Mary,
hardly in accordance with the dignity
of our subject, though your father may
be able to throw light on the prevalence
of this curious custom. As I was say-
ing, pigs gradually came to establish
themselves in popular favour in the
reign we are now discussing, owing to
the shortage of imported meat. Indeed
their value was so generally recog-
nised that a Ministry of Pig-Production
was created, and the first holder of that
office showed such a patriotic sense
of his responsibilities that, being the
principal proprietor of a great group of
newspapers, on his appointment he
control of these organs. This exhibi-
tion of integrity and independence was
not without its reward, for the PRIME
MINISTER immediately raised him from
the rank of Wiscount to that of Earl,
and conferred on him the Order of the
Garter. -
Richard. While we are on this sub-
ject, Mamma, why is it that you have
told us so little about the great dis-
pute whether BACON wrote SHAKSPEARE,
beyond saying that it convulsed liter-
ary circles in this reign 2
Mrs. M. Because the theory, though
widely embraced, does not rest on good
authority, and, as I have often said—
for example, in connection with the
story of HUBERT's going to put out
Prince ARTHUR's eyes in the prison—I

FURTHER HOSTILITIES ON THE HOME FRONT.
“Through my heart first.”
MR. LEIF JONES.
MR. CLYNES.
Monday, March 11th.--The debate in which Irish Nationalist Members was not a question of support but of
on the relations between the Govern-
ment and the Press duly took place,
but, contrary to the advance-notices ap-
pearing in rival organs, did little either
to shake or strengthen the position of
the Government. -
For a moment it appeared as if Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN was going to drive home
his charge that the Administration was
under the thumb of certain newspaper
trusts. But premature cheers from the
Lloydophobists below the Gangway
warned him that he might be going
too far. “Non tali auxilio,” he muttered
in a scornful aside, and thenceforward
diluted his indictment until it became
as thin as Government ale.
Any gravity that was left in it was
dispersed by Mr. SPENCER LEIGH
HUGHES, who in his best “Sub Rosa"
manner proved to demonstration that
if a Department of Propaganda was
required you did not want a person
like GEORGE WASHINGTON to conduct
it. His little hatchet would have cut
no ice at all.
their own axes and not hampered by
“needless scrupulosity.”
The most surprising feature of the
You must have stalwart
backwoodsmen, accustomed to grind
tumbled over one another in paying
tributes of admiration to Lord North-
CLIFFE, whose faith in himself, if at all
shaken by previous speeches, must have
been restored by Mr. McKEAN's touch-
ing confession that he had “always
believed in The Daily Mail.”
Lord BEAVERBRook came in for less
attention than his noble colleague. In
fact Lord HUGH CECIL was principally
concerned about the manner in which as
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
he would administer his ecclesiastical
patronage. As a result of to-day's debate
candidates for livings within his gift
have been warned against the further
use of that favourite hymn, “The roseate
hues.” -
Tuesday, March 12th. —In their
anxiety not to interfere with the deli-
berations of those patriotic Irishmen
who are trying to settle how Ireland
shall be governed in the future the
Government are allowing it to become
ungovernable by anybody. That was
the point of a vigorous speech delivered
by Lord SALISBURY, who incidentally
remarked that the Irish Constabulary
would have no difficulty, if they were
properly supported by the Government.
numbers. How could nine thousand
constables keep in order a population
of four and a-half millions 2
A concrete example of this arith-
metical problem had been supplied a
few minutes before in another place by
the CHIEF SECRETARY. It had been
reported that the town of Kiltimagh, in
Galway, had been captured and held
for two days by Sinn Fein volunteers.
The true facts of this “mischievous
tale,” according to Mr. DUKE, were that
three hundred young men from outly-
ing districts met at Kiltimagh, did a
little drilling, and then dispersed. “The
two constables who were on duty have
duly reported the occurrence.” But
they do not appear to have followed
the famous example of their colleague,
who on a similar occasion “surrounded
the crowd.”
On the Consolidated Fund Bill Mr.
LEIF JoMEs made his annual attack
upon beer. The best thing in his speech
was a quotation from a medical report
on the effects of alcohol. Among these
are “loquacity and an argumentative
frame of mind” and “uncritical self-
satisfaction of the subject with his own
performances.” But as even temper-

subsequent speeches was the manner

play these symptoms the House was
not much impressed.
Wednesday, March 13th.- The Lords
spent a useful half-hour in a discussion
on fresh-water fish. Lord BUCKMASTER
displayed a remarkable knowledge of
their habits, due, it is supposed, to his
former association with the Great Seal.
The Army Council, in order to get
on with the War, bas prohibited the
sale of the high boots beloved by
"flappers," except during June and
July. Sir John Rees protested, on the
ground that such footgear is “particu-
larly comforting in the winter," but Mr.
FORSTER claimed to be even better ac-
quainted with the subject-matter, and
declared that "quantities of the goods
in question are only suitable for sum-
mer wear.” The incident will, I trust,
be duly noted as an example of how
Britain met the crisis in her fate.
In some districts a new terror has
been added to death by the refusal of the
Registrars to issue a certificate except
in exchange for the deceased's sugar-
card. The practice has now been
officially forbidden, but not until a
rumour had gained credence that no
male citizen between the ages of six-
teen and sixty-five would henceforth be
allowed to die without a permit from
the DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL SERVICE.
The case for Mr. Fisher's Education
Bill is so strong that it hardly needed
Mr. Acland's vigorous advocacy. It
was not seriously threatened by Mr.
Peto's objection that certain plays by
SHAKSPEARE and Sir JAMES BARRIE
could not be produced if child-labour
were prohibited; or by the frank obscu-
rantism of Sir F. BANBURY, who de-
clared that higher education was often
a positive hindrance to a business man,
and implied that if by an unkind fate
he had proceeded froin Winchester to
Oxford he would now be sweeping a

A concrete example of this arith-
metical problem had been supplied a
few minutes before in another place by
the CHIEF SECRETARY. It had been
reported that the town of Kiltimagh, in
Galway, had been captured and held
for two days by Sinn Fein volunteers.
The true facts of this “mischievous
tale,” according to Mr. DUKE, were that
three hundred young men from outly-
ing districts met at Kiltimagh, did a
little drilling, and then dispersed. “The
two constables who were on duty have
duly reported the occurrence.” But
they do not appear to have followed

Wednesday, March 13th.-The Lords
spent a useful half-hour in a discussion
on fresh-water fish. Lord BUCKMASTER
displayed a remarkable knowledge of
their habits, due, it is supposed, to his
former association with the Great Seal.
The Army Council, in order to get
on with the War, has prohibited the
sale of the high boots beloved by
“flappers,” except during June and
July. Sir John REEs protested, on the
ground that such footgear is “particu-
larly comforting in the winter,” but Mr.
ForsTER claimed to be even better ac-
quainted with the subject-matter, and
declared that “quantities of the goods
in question are only suitable for sum-
meer wear.” The incident will, I trust,
be duly noted as an example of how
Britain met the crisis in her fate.
In some districts a new terror has
been added to death by the refusal of the
Registrars to issue a certificate except
in exchange for the deceased's sugar-
card. The practice has now been
officially forbidden, but not until a
rumour had gained credence that no
male citizen between the ages of six-
teen and sixty-five would henceforth be
allowed to die without a permit from
the DIRECTOR of NATIONAL SERVICE.
The case for Mr. FISHER's Education
Bill is so strong that it hardly needed
Mr. AcLAND's vigorous advocacy. It
was not seriously threatened by Mr.
PETo's objection that certain plays by
SHAKSPEARE and Sir JAMES BARRIE
could not be produced if child-labour
were prohibited; or by the frank obscu-
rantism of Sir F. BANBURY, who de-
clared that higher education was often
a positive hindrance to a business man,
and implied that if by an unkind fate
he had proceeded from Winchester to
Oxford he would now be sweeping a
crossing. -
Thursday, March 14th.-It was satis-
factory to hear from Mr. CLYNEs that
our wheat stocks compare favourably

UP IN THE MORNING.
Second-Lieutenant Jerry and I share
a room in a farm. When we inspected
it for the first time by the light of an
electric torch, at the end of a march
one Arctic night, it looked a suitable
place in which to store a broken-
down reaper-and-binder, preserved for
sentimental reasons; but our two ser-
vants set about it and turned it into a
retreat that suggests the interior of a
shack in a backwoods film. We have
each a bedstead of wood and hen wire;
a strip of camouflage webbing disguises
the bleak nudity of the stone floor; the

water and little bergs, and then drops
in a sponge like a crackling mass of
brown coral. By the time Jerry, even
a double quantity of shaving water for
him every morning. He has come to
regard it as a matter of course that his
master, or “bloke,” lingers in bed till
the first lot is frozen over. Jerry
watches it as who should time him-
self by an egg-boiler, and when the
once steaming mug is cold and skinned
with ice, then Jerry rolls, vocal, from

Jerry has two faults as a stable com-

is his habit of singing as he dresses,
and the second his morbid persistence

as a series of studied taunts. When I

THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 189
PUNCH, OR
THE PILLAR-BOX.
INTo the theory and philosophy of
letter-writing this is not the time to
enter. The theme is placid and there-
fore inopportune when a war is raging.
But, were the occasion fitting, much
could be said as to the differences in
human character where the epistolary
art is concerned: how this man will
answer letters punctiliously, and that
one, taking refuge in the dictum that
after a fortnight all letters answer
themselves, will write none at all; how
this woman will tell all the news that
matters, and that one all the news that
doesn't matter. But the present is not
the time; a war rages.
None the less, but for the War the
predicament with regard to letter-writ-
ing in which the family of X finds
itself at the moment would never have
come about, and therefore it is better
that the story should be told now or
never. (“Never!” you perhaps say;
but you are too late, for, see, it is
already in print.)
The X family live in the country,
in a house remote from postal con-
veniences; and it was a boon beyond
price when, just before the KAISER
contracted hydrophobia from one of the
maddest dogs of war, a pillar-box was
erected at the gate of a neighbouring
farm by a not ordinarily too considerate
Postmaster-General.
After a while, in the dearth of able-
bodied postmen, the aged substitute
whose duty it is morning and evening
to empty this box began to suggest
that, since very often it was empty to
start with, it would be wiser to close
it altogether.
“What's the sense,” he would say,
“of my coming these extra two miles
either for nothing at all or for a single
postcard?” and “Why shouldn't these
here folks be made to walk to the next
post-box, same as they used to ? Don't
they know there's a war on ?”
When these sentiments penetrated to
the X family there was general panic.
Mr. X was in a panic because no man
likes to see comforts and conveniences
receding from him, and also because he
entertained the hope of getting rid of
his house to some Londoner who had a
distaste for air-raids, and the adjacency
of the pillar-box made such a transfer
more likely.
Mrs. X was in a panic because she
did not like the girls to have to walk so
far as the next pillar-box on dark nights
and in wet weather.
The girls were in a panic for 'the
same reason, and the servants shared
the sentiment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EVEN IN OUR ASHES--—
I PROPost, to relate a passage in the life of Ben Butterworth
of this parish. Unfortunately it is not very creditable to
Ben, but that is not my fault. Ben is of an immense age
and is very proud of the fact. “I am turned eighty-five,”
he is accustomed to say, “but I am good for a fair day's
work yet.” He adds that he don't go rumbusting about,
like some, but keeps 'isself to 'isself and don't push his way
we're he ain't wanted. He is looked after by a widowed
daughter of uncertain age and stern principles, who keeps
him respectable and lets him out into the air with a short
clay pipe and a screw of tobacco. -
Old Ben's great days come in the winter, for it is then
that the parish fathers draw him out of his leisure and
provide him with a real job. There is in this parish, on
the very edge of it, a narrow public footpath, some three
hundred yards in length, which leads to a river and is
heavily overhung by trees. In Winter, when the leaves
have all fallen or been blown down, the pathway is clogged
with a thick and sodden carpet of decay, and hither comes
old Ben with a little barrow, a stumpy broom, a rake and
two bits of board which he uses for transferring to the
barrow the heaps of leaves which he has raked together.
To what mysterious place he finally consigns them I
cannot say. He works slowly but steadily, and in the
result he clears every vestige of leaf from the path and
makes it once more a pride and a pleasure to the parish.
“'Tain't everybody,” he says, “as could get through with a
job like this. You've got to know how to handle a rake
and how to make the most of your barrow. Some others
might think it was easy, but they ain't got my experi-
ence. I done this bit of work fifteen year and I knows
the ways of it.”
Last December, when the appointed time for the path-
cleaning came round, old Ben was kept at home on account
of an illness which he called “Bronicle Toobs,” and his
place was taken by a frosty-faced white-haired lad of
eighty, who executed his work with decent celerity and dis-
patch. So far as I could see he was hardly, if at all, inferior
to Ben in any of the finer points of their common art.
Ben, however, was of a different opinion. A week or two
after the last leaf had been removed he emerged to con-
template his rival's work. I came upon him as he was
critically observing every inch of the ground, and passed
the time of day with him. He made no secret of his con-
tempt for the usurper. “This young feller who done my
job,” he said, “don’t seem to know how to set to it. They
might as well have give it to a child to do. He 've leſt
these here leaves lying in 'eaps and 'eaps, ah, and waste-
paper too, Sir-you're standing on a bit yourself, Sir. He
oughtn't to have undertook the work. It's deceiving
people, that's what I call it, and I shall tell him so if I
come acrorst him.” - - -
I tried to soothe the old man by telling him that the
whole parish had noticed and deplored his absence. This
however had but little effect upon him, for he had
already assumed that everybody must have been sensible
of the loss. - --
As I came home the same way a few minutes afterwards,
the old man's back was turned and he did not hear me.
He was engaged in an absorbing occupation. He had col-
lected from somewhere a great accumulation of leaves,
which he was laboriously distributing over the footpath,
obviously in order to depreciate the effect of his rival's
work. When at last he saw me he pointed to his handi-
work and said triumphantly, “He calls this cleaning a
º Why, he don't know how to clean 'isself, let alone
a path.”
MORAL.
WHEN all the land was waking up to war
And thousands rushed to put a tunic on,
Young Jimmy sat in drinking-shops and swore
He'd be in civvies when the world had gone;
He had no use for patriotic stuff,
And what was Belgium when a man had beer?
“Just wait until they take you by the scruff,
But never volunteer.”
Yet next week saw him sweating with the rest,
Presenting arms and padding it for leagues; . .
He did the rifle business with a zest, -
But what he couldn't stomach was fatigues;
Yet when the Sergeant wanted someone quick
Young Jimmy was the first to answer, “Here!"
Though afterwards he'd say it made him sick–
“Don’t ever volunteer.”
Young Jimmy was a terror at the Front
For digging-jobs and bombing and patrols,
Though all along he said, “A stunt's a stunt,
But don't go asking for a brace of holes.”
And then one night he tried too big a thing—
I saw him on his stretcher at the rear—
And what I think the lad was whispering
Was, “Never volunteer.”
Old soldiers sit and grumble in the barns
And tell their wisdom to the young men round,
And this is all the burden of their yarns.— .
“Don’t do a blessed thing until you're bound; ”
But when there's something dirty to be done
It's wondrous how this wisdom disappears;
Of all the multitude I don't know one
Who never volunteers. A. P. H.

THE WELFARE OF THE BLIND.
At the request of Sir ARTHUR PEARsos Mr. Punch calls
the attention of his readers to the following scheme:–
On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on
the Welfare of the Blind the Local Government Board
have decided to compile a register of all blind persons—
that is, of all persons who are too blind to perform work
for which eyesight is essential.
Circular letters have been addressed to all Public Health
and Local Education Authorities, Institutions and Socie-
ties for the Blind, Nursing Associations and Poor Law
Guardians, asking them to co-operate by forwarding parti-
culars of the blind persons who have come under their
notice. But, as the value of the Register will depend
largely upon its approach to completeness, it is hoped that
any blind person who is not in touch with any of those
bodies will communicate either with the Local Authority of
his area or with the Local Government Board, Whitehall,
direct. It should be clearly understood that the informa-
tion to be furnished will not be used, otherwise than for
statistical purposes, except upon the application or with
the consent of the person concerned.
At the same time the Local Government Board are
drawing up a list of Institutions, Societies and Agencies
for the Blind, with a view to the compilation, in the in-
terests of the public and the blind themselves, of a Register
of approved Societies, and any such Society which has not
already been invited to do so is asked to communicate at
an early date with the Secretary of the Local Government
Board.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN A History of Departed Things (KEGAN PAUL) Mrs.
HENRY HEAD has put to her credit a considerable achieve-
ment. She tells her story mainly in the form of letters
from one person, and she creates an effect so lifelike that
the story cannot possibly be anything but fiction. Bettina
is the “heroine" round whom as a centre such action as
there is takes place. For more than half the book I sub-
mitted with delight, almost with enthusiasm, to the charm
of this fascinating widow. There is about her letters a deli-
cate aroma of lavender and roses, and her comments on her-
self and her friends are both genial and humorous. So she
goes on, creating her own particular atmosphere, and being
steadily spoilt, I am sorry to say, by all who are brought
She bitterly resents her daughter Fanny's engagement to
Ambrose, and when Fanny dies (quite wantonly and un-
necessarily) she herself, Bettina the beloved, the gentle and
generous, catches Ambrose's heart on the rebound and mar-
ries him ' Mrs. HENRY HEAD may plead the example of
Colonel Esmond and Lady Castlewood, but I cannot admit
any palliation on that ground, for I have never reconciled
myself to Lady Castlewood's second marriage. She may
say further that she is entitled to do what she likes with
her own. I reply that she must observe the rules. If
she meant Bettina to turn out inconsiderate and selfish and
disloyal she had no business to cause me to fall in love with
the said Bettina. Mrs. HEAD did this of set purpose, and
I owe her a grudge for having brought me up with a round
turn. Still I forgive her out of gratitude for the pleasure

MENDING THE THATCH.
(For the Repertory of the “Irish Players.”)
ACT I.
SceNE.—The kitchen of Michael Bourke's cottage in Kerry;
a wild might, with rain. Michael Bourke and his friend
Paddy O'Shea sit by the remains of a turf fire on very
rickety chairs. The fire is the only light in the kitchen,
and there is practically no furniture. Rain drips from
the roof and occasionally hits Michael Bourke on the head.
When the curtain rises the two men are singing scraps
of old songs.
Michael Bourke. Do you mind this one, Paddy? (Tries
a mote or two and then begins in a quavering voice)
And they locked the pride of Erin's Isle
In cold Kilmainham jail-l-l-l-l.
(He hangs on to the last note until a drop of water from the
thatch hits him on the head.) Bad cess to it! - -
[He looks around on the floor for his hat and puts it on.
Paddy O'Shea (gazing into the fire and after deep thought).
Wouldn't it be the grand thing now, Michael, if you would
be after putting a bit of something on the thatch the way
you wouldn't be destroyed with the rain and it falling on
ou ?
Michael Bourke (with the water running from the brim
of his hat). That's the grand notion you've got, Paddy
O'Shea. (He relapses into thought.) But sure the wind would
only be blowing it off again (again relapses into thought),
or maybe the hens would be flying up and destroying it
On nine. -
Paddy O'Shea (getting up with a certain amount of de-
cision). It's yourself that has the head on you, Michael.
(A pause.) Is it true that Murphy below is after getting a
new barrel of porter? .
Michael Bourke (rising with alacrity). As true as God's
in heaven. [Both men go out.
CURTAIN.
ACT. II.
Scene.—The same as before, only worse. I’ive years have
clapsed. One of the two chairs has now only three legs,
and the hole in the thatch is bigger. A wild might. Still
raining. Michael Bourke and Paddy O'Shea, looking a
little older, are sitting by the fire with their hats on their
heads. Both get liberally sprinkled with water from time
to time.
Michael Bourke (singing).
Oh, I knew she had consented
By the roll-ll-ll-lling of her eye-e-e-e.
Paddy O'Shea (who has been beating time with his feet).
'Tis a great song entirely.
Michael Bourke (with the water running from his clothes
to form a pool on the floor). As fine a song as you'll hear in
the kingdom of Kerry. Many's the time herself would
sing it before the rheumatics took her, and her not able to
move a finger till her death. (Gazes into the fire.) Maybe
we should go down to Murphy's below, or they'll have the
stuff drunk on us and us not getting a drop at all.
Paddy O'Shea. 'Tis yourself that has the grand head on
you, Michael. [They go out.
CURTAIN.
- ACT III.
Scene.—Worse than ever. Again a wild night and still
raining. Another five years have elapsed. Half the roof
has gone and the rain splashes on the floor. One chair
has now two legs and a boa: to rest on, and the other is
Both men have their hats crammed down over the ears.
Locks of grey hair straggle out over the collars of their
coats. -
Michael Bourke (singing).

Michael Bourke. -
[Michael Bourke sings on, while Paddy O'Shea turns
wp the collar of his coat. The floor is now deep in
water and the wind whistles in through the hole in
the roof.
Paddy O'Shea (hesitatingly). Wouldn't it be the grand
thing now, Michael, if you would be after putting a bit of
something on the roof? -
Michael Bourke (interrupted). The divil fly away with the
roof What with Dublin Castle and the hens flying up on

earth [Gives it up and goes on with his song.
Paddy O'Shea (hesitatingly). The young peeler's after
telling me this very day that Murphy below has the grand
stuff straight from GUINNEss in Dublin. (A pause.) Would
you be thinking of stretching your legs, Michael?
Michael Bourke (rising with alacrity, but not to be out-
done in circumlocution). Maybe we would be hearing from
the young lads of things that does be going on in foreign
lands across the water. Let you be coming now, Paddy
O'Shea.
[They go out and leave the rain splashing on the floor.
CURTAIN.
THE SENTIMENTALIST.
I LIKE to think of my true love, remote from everything,
In some secluded silken room where she may play and sing,
And dream for hours and hours of me, yet never find it
palls;
But, alas! she's cleaning windows in a suit of overalls.
I like to think of my true love all lonely in a bower
Of roses, how she lingers there to pass a sunlit bour
Amid the perfume and the bees, dreaming she will be mine;
But, alas! she's in a smock and breeks and she's off to
feed the swine. -
I like to think of my true love a-riding every day
All in her slender shining coach with prancing horses grey—
A-riding stately through the town thinking of her dear
man ; -
But, alas! she's in a motor-coat and she's gone to drive a
Wan,
I like to think of my true love however she's employed,
For somehow just the thought of her it makes me over-
joyed;
I wish I had her stowed away and adequately dressed,
But, coat or breeks or overalls, I will love my true love best.
Another Impending Apology.

BOLSHEVISED LITERATURE.

It is particularly requested that the hero
should not be of higher rank than sergeant
and that the heroine should belong to the
proletariat. The deluded husband should be

macassar, Cinderella was sitting. As
she sat there she sighed to herself, for
she was very unhappy. Why was she
little bourgoise like you? Why, they'd
turn you out at once.” And then they
tramped off and left her.
As she sat there sighing, suddenly
the door opened and her Fairy God-
mother appeared before her.

bourgeoise. She belonged to the
proletariat as much as they did.
She too would have loved to go
to the Committee of Commissaries
of all the Soviets of Soldiers and

She wanted to make a speech.
Every day her sisters and her step-
mother made speeches, all speaking
together. Sometimes they issued
proclamations addressed “To All."
Oh, how she longed to issue a pro-
clamation “To All"! But her step-

at once. Suddenly the figure of a new
Commissary was seen standing on a
table. In her hand she held a pro-

“Comrades,” she cried, and her voice
was so clear that everybody stopped to
listen to her, “the Revolution is in
danger. I have made a great discovery.
It is this—you are all bourgeois.”
There was an appalling sensation.
“Yes,” she went on, “you think

THE WHIRLIG|G.
I MAY warn you at once that there is
Thothing at all in this little episode save
as illustrating an experience that is,
I suppose, common to many of the mid-
dle-ageing in these tumultuous days.
“John is home on short leave,” his
mother wrote, “and we both want
you to dine here on Tuesday, to meet
some friends of his, Major and Mrs.
Packenham.” -
This, of course, was very pleasant.
John's mother is one of the most
charming hostesses in the world; and
I have known John himself since he
was in sailor-suits. I accepted, as they
say, with alacrity.
All the way to the house I kept on
telling myself to be sure and remember
that John was now a grown man. It
is indeed obviously impossible to regard
as anything else a war-worn veteran
who has already collected two gold
stripes and as many stars. But one
had to be careful. Only that morning,
with secret blushes, I had emptied my
pocket-book of a little collection of
foreign stamps which, following an
ancient custom, I had continued to set
aside for him . . . - -
Of course all this clearly ought to
have prepared me for the Packenhams;
but somehow it didn't. Since the name
was unfamiliar to me, I had been won-
dering (perhaps with a touch of jeal-
ousy) how long they had been intimates
of the household, and forming, as one
does at such times, a mental picture of
the pair. I am afraid indeed that I
detested them both cordially before-
hand.
And then—the disillusion. I say
nothing about John, because he is
another story, and (to those of us who
care) a very proud and thrilling one.
But those Packenhams . . . At first
I thought they hadn't come, and that
the pair of attractive children who
smiled shyly over our introduction must
be last-minute substitutes. Then I
caught the words, “Major and Mrs.,”
and began to realize . . . . . .
It certainly was the queerest shock.
Possibly both uniform and knee-skirts
have a tendency to rejuvenate; but, so
far as appearance went, if either of the
couple had seen twenty, that was the
limit of it. I took Mrs. Packenham in,
and in the pauses of a conversation
chiefly devoted to rabbits (as pets, not
provender) occupied myself with sensa-
tional speculations as to how long her
hair had been up. - -
But it was the gallant Major who
furnished my chief problem. “Where
were you,” I asked him suddenly, “be-
fore the War 2 ”
He blushed (I had already noticed this moment, no,” I confessed.

this habit of his when addressed). “In
the fifth–with John,” he said.
“Fifth–division ?” (You see how
slowly my mind was working.)
“No—form. School, you know. We
were there together.” .
I apologised, but not before his
natural embarrassment had deepened
the blush perceptibly. All at once the
sight roused in me a sympathy almost
paternal; and to feel paternal to a
Major was an experience so bewilder-
ing as to hold me silent for a long while.
“You’re very quiet,” said John's
mother at last in a concerned under-
tone. “Is anything the matter?”
“Nothing,” I assured her. “Only
I'm trying to see life.”
“And can you?”
I contrived a wistful smile. “ }:

“For me, too,” said John's mother.
But she of course was looking at John.
A RATIONAL WIEW,
WHERE'ER One goes, one hears the
question
What food to eat, and just how much,
And many an impotent suggestion
The vital problem fails to touch.
Don't think me all too vain, my brothers,
If I should venture to opine
That, after sampling many others,
No method's quite so good as mine.
This is my system—I'll repeat it
To guide your palate when in doubt:
When there is food to eat, I eat it,
And when there's none—I go without.

TO MY LADY IN SPRING
(After much reading of Communiqués
from the Western Front).
If no artillery of vows
Nor creeping barrages of prayer
Compassion in your breast may rouse,
But I am still a stranger there
On bended knees with outstretched
hand
In No Man's Land;
If, when I only wait the sign
To compass with outflanking curve
The chosen portion of your line,
You summon up your coy reserve
With rosy S.O.S.'s flame
And spoil my game;
If labouring thus I may but win,
Prepared by batteries of art,
A temporary footing in
The outpost trenches of your heart,
That is not good enough for me,
Hermione.
For somehow I must surely seize
The full objective I desire;
The buds have raided all the trees
And Spring has burst the Winter's
wire; - -
A strong offensive round us thrills
Of daffodils. :
The lark has stormed the skies with
song, - -
Delivering each time the goods;
Last Sunday as I strolled along
I found a primrose in the woods;
It gave no kind of warning shout—
It just came out.
Then plague on all cajolings sweet
And drumfire of continued woe,
I'll rush you, lady, off your feet
And take you prisoner ere you know;
Triumphant, forcible and frank,
I'll play the Tank. Evoe.
A WAR-TIME CHILD.
I THINK that, to start with, Anne's
interest in me was first aroused by the
fact that I was possessed of only one
leg; so you see there are compensations
in leaving one's limbs behind one in
Flanders. -
“Poor ole leg,” she used to say pity-
ingly; “he got lost at France, didn't
he'? Won't he never come back
again?”
She seemed so absurdly miserable
when I told her that he wouldn't that
I hastened to assure her that I didn't
mind in the least—should, in fact, much
prefer the new bought leg that was
coming, which would never ache or be
cold or tired. - -
“Never ache no more?" she echoed.
“I’m glad,” and so she was comforted.
Anne was born thirty years later than I
was. There are so few Annes among
my contemporaries; besides it saddens
me to feel that she really hardly remem-
bers the time when there was no war.
Even her toys and dolls she plays with
under war conditions. -
“No butter and no margarine this
morning,” I heard her cheerfully telling
her special favourite, Dolly Dumps, “so
you must just eat your breakfast with-
out; there's treacle or honey, an' that's
all. 'Coz of the War.”
Anne cherishes a pair of white ban-
tams which live in a little pen in a
corner of the paddock; she feeds them
herself in the afternoons unless she
happens to be out or away, when some-
one looks after them for her. One
afternoon the gardener, thinking she
was out to tea, fed the bantams for the
night, and Anne, not knowing what he
had done, gave them several of her
small handfuls of food when she came
in later. She was terribly distressed
when she discovered that they had had
a double meal and for a long time re-
fused to be comforted. “I know Whitie
and Nobs has 'ceeded their rations;
what will the Food 'TROLLER think of
me?” she asked pathetically.
“You must pull down the blinds,” I
heard her severely admonishing the
dolls who live in the smart red dolls'
house in the corner of the nursery; “I
have told you before. Guv'ment will
have you if you don't.” *
To her Golliwog she was even more
emphatic.
“I’m ashamed of you,” she told him,
“taking away Dolly Dumps' biscuit.
I'm afraid you must be a Food Hog,
and that's nearly a German, you know."
In the middle of the morning, yester-
day, I found her in the act of putting
her Teddy Bear (clad in bright pink
pyjamas) into the small wooden bed in
which he sleeps. -
“Teddy ill?" I inquired sympatheti-
cally. - -
“No, he's been naughty."
voice sounded rather hard.
“What's he done now 2'' I asked.
Anne finished arranging the rose-
patterned eider-down smoothly over
Teddy's recumbent form, then, coming
over to me, she said, “I told him for a
great treat he might light the fire in the
dolls' house this morning, and,” here
she lowered her voice portentously,
“he used a match for it!”
“Well,” I said, “why was that
naughty? What ought he to have
done?” -
She looked at me in hurt surprise.
“Why, used a spill, of course. Mustn't
use matches in war-time." -
“But perhaps there weren't any
Anne's
pal of mine and I didn't like to feel he
was in trouble.
“Oh, yes, there was,” said Anne re-
lentlessly; “there was lots and lots.
Me and Nurse made them yesterday,
and Teddy knew, 'coz he helped do the
twiddly bit at the end.” -
So there was no explaining away
Teddy's unfortunate lapse from the
paths of patriotism, and he stayed in
bed till luncheon-time.
I was watching Anne, the other even-
ing, carefully manoeuvring her little
flock of Noah's Ark animals up the
narrow gangway into the Ark.
“Do you know,” I asked her idly,
“why the animals went into the
Ark 2'' - -
She paused in her occupation and
looked round, a gaudily-painted leopard
poised between her small pink finger
and thumb.
“Of course I know—Air Raid,” she
said, and pushed the leopard in through
his little doorway. * - -

Mrs. M. I think I told you that
playing-cards were introduced into
England in this reign. They were
invented, so it is said, to divert the
melancholy of Lord Southmount, caused
by the attacks of his ungrateful fellow-
countrymen. “Beggar my Neighbour”
and “Nap" were the names of two of
the simplest of these games, but there
were many others, such as “Whist”
and “Bridge.”

Mrs. M. I really cannot tell you for

this game was specially prescribed as
an antidote to sleeplessness, which has
so often proved detrimental to the
health of those who work their brains
too hard. .

Mrs. M. Yes, quite colossal. It
weighed two hundred pounds, or ounces,

largest on record. Indeed there is a
legend that in order to preserve his bal-
ance he was obliged to weight his boots
with lead. Cards, however, were not
played merely as a distraction from care.
Many people indulged in the pastime
out of sheer lightheartedness, and the
craving was so strong that they played
cards at all times and in all places, even
to the extent of going out for “whist-
drives,” which I believe were a form of
“joy-ride,” as it was called. Another
feature of this reign was the revival of
old country songs and dances. People
collected folk-tunes from the oldest in-
habitants of remote villages, and the
number of centenarian singers was
quite remarkable. In the dancing
movement WILLIAM MoRRIs, who in-
vented wall-papers,was very prominent.

Mrs. M. Very few, I fear, as chil-
dren were mainly occupied with writ-
ing poetry; but fairy-stories were very
popular with adult readers, and panto-
mimes, as they were called, though
originally intended for a juvenile audi-
ence, were almost exclusively attended
by people of mature age. The influence
of youth was also markedly shown in
the domain of art. Children, as I have

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 18th-Sir ALFRED
Mond gave a portentous list of the
premises that he has commandeered
for the Air Ministry in various parts of
the Metropolis, and, to judge by his
complaint that Mr. KENNEDY Jon Es
had prevented him from acquiring the
- British Museum, it would seem that he
has not finally abandoned his designs
upon that institution. His hope, º:
haps, is that when the Trustees find
themselves entirely surrounded by the
enemy's outposts they will surrender
at discretion. -
The shrinkage in the size of eggs has
not escaped the vigilant gaze of Mr.
HARcourt. His suspicions that Lord
RHoNDDA is in some way responsible
for it has been deepened rather than
removed by Mr. CLYNEs' assurance
that the only specimens which weigh
less than twenty-four ounces a dozen
come from Egypt; for was not Egypt
the home of the first Food-Controller 2
Members heard with satisfaction
tempered by envy Dr. MACNAMARA's
statement that the Central Billeting
Board has acquired twelve hostels in
Glasgow, where, for the modest sum of
23s. a week, residents can obtain three
square meals a day. It is confidently
anticipated that the shortage of labour
in the shipyards will be speedily reme-
died by a large movement of popula-
tion from the West End restaurants to
Clydeside.
The debate on the Education Bill,
which passed its Second Reading, was
one long eulogy, in various keys, of its
author, Mr. Fisher, who would be well
advised, in view of the hazards of the
Committee stage, to offer a sacrifice to
Nemesis.
Mr. MARRIOTT led off with an excellent
speech; though it was a little odd to
hear him in the presence of the Labour
Party inviting the House to “consider
what might have been lost to the
country if, instead of going on from
their private preparatory schools to
Eton and Winchester, Members of this
House had been forced prematurely
into an industrial career.”
An appropriate reply was furnished
by Mr. O'GRADY, who recalled his ap-
prenticeship to “the art and craft of
cabinet - making.” Who knows?—he
may yet find it useful.
“I do not rise,” said Sir Edward
PARROTT, “from the mere impulsion of
an itch for speaking.” That was for-
tunate, for even without this stimulus
his speech filled nine columns of the
official report. It was full of classical
allusions, but I missed my old friend,

the public welfare that caused Lord
HALs BURY to resist the passage of Lord
BUCKMASTER’s Bill enabling women to
become solicitors. Ninety-two years'

stages of a quarrel which so often pre-
vent it from developing into litigation.
It is distressing to record that the
| Peers by a substantial majority refused
to endorse this idyllic view of the
typical “solicitor's letter.”
Their Lordships then settled down to
an academic discussion on the League
of Nations, in the course of which Lord
LOREBURN revealed his entire agree-
ment with Lord LANSDow NE's famous
lètter; and Lord LANSDown E himself,
while accepting the description of Ger-
many as “the anarchist of Europe,”
“THE LADIES.”
nevertheless urged her inclusion in the
League.
In the Commons Mr. TREveLYAN
and other gentlemen who think that
war can be ended by talk once more
attacked what they call secret diplom-
acy. If the mysteries of foreign affairs
were regularly confided to Mr. KING and
Mr. PRINGLE there would, they believe,
be much less danger of disputes ending
in war. Mr. BALFour differed. For
one thing, he said, the House, with all
its merits, lacked a sense of proportion.
In his view “open diplomacy” would
lead to open quarrels, and so long as
he was Foreign Minister he would have
nothing to do with it.
Question-time, as usual, was largely
devoted to food. Mr. STANTON received
the comforting assurance that fifty
thousand tons of damaged grain, &c.,
will be available for “utility fowls";
Mr. Tyson-WILsoN complained of the
action of the FooD-CoNTROLLER in raid-
ing a house where the only evidence of
hoarding was a single pound of pepper
(believed to be part of the peck picked
by Peter Piper); and Mr. TURTON was
informed that in the matter of sugar
His Majesty's Judges were treated
exactly in the same way as humbler
members of the community. Hence
the vogue in assize-towns of that well-
known ditty, “A little bit of sugar for
the beak.”
Wednesday, March 20th.-Lord CUR-
zoN made an earnest appeal to the
Peers to save paper by foregoing the
daily supply of “Votes and Proceed-
ings.” If they pine for light fiction
let them satisfy themselves with the
War Cabinet's apologia pro vita sua,

Eloquent upon many topics, the
volume is silent upon the luxuriant crop
of peerages and other titular distinctions
produced in the year 1917. Lord SEL-

logue raisonné, recording the public
services of the recipients. But Lord ||.
CURzoN was obdurate. The public did
not ask for reasons when a TENNYsoN or
a LISTER, a FRENCH or a JELLICoE was
ennobled; why should it do so when

drops upon Lord Blank or Lord Dash 2
In the matter of shipbuilding Sir
ERIC GEDDEs declined to sit on the
stool of repentance. In fact at one
time he seemed more likely to throw it
at his critics, in the manner of the
famous JENNY of the same ilk. While
admitting that we had lost a fifth of
our tonnage, and wanted an additional
100,000 tons a month to make up our
leeway, he claimed that in the circum-
stances the Admiralty Controller of

OUR FRIENDS THE BIRDS.
A GREAT deal of publicity has of late
been given to the Army's pigeons, some
of which acted as bank messengers
when the Tank was picking our pockets
in Trafalgar Square the other day;
but no one has yet said a word for
another very remarkable ornithological
war organisation, which has its head-
quarters at Polperro.
It is not, of course, wise to divulge
all the activities which our propa-
gandists are prosecuting with so much
zeal and, it is to be hoped, success, but
the CENsor having decided that the
time has come to let the public into
the secret of those vast structures which
have for so long puzzled the passers-by

‘the whole ground of patriotic and civic

“‘Splendid!' I said. “And where do
you get the birds?’
“‘We have breeding stations all over
the place,' said Colonel Bryant. ‘There
is one, for example, in the House of

necessary that the members of our
corps should be in uniform and also
should attract as little notice as pos-
sible, and we therefore have to adopt
this course. The birds naturally don't
like it; their vanity is touched, and some
of their expressions of disgust are most
forcible. But being wise creatures they
come to recognise the necessity, and it
is really very interesting to see their
patriotic efforts to show that even
without fine feathers they can be fine
birds.'
“And when do they start on this
mission ?' I asked.

of the long embargo of

to promote the conservation of the na-

THE PROBLEM OF THE GOAT.
I wonDER if we have kept our bonne
bouche too long . . . .
I should point out that the fact of
my being in possession of a reasonably
young and, as I believe, edible goat is
purely "fortuitous. I have no normal
traffic in goats. My energetic sister-
in-law is entirely to blame. She set
on foot about a year ago a tremendous
scheme for furnishing goats' milk for
the needy. Consequently she became
a keen, almost a perfervid, collectress
of goats, My farm was called upon to
act as a place of assembly—a sort of
rail-head. And there this kid was born
ten months ago. He should, they say,
have been eaten in adolescence, but no
one about the place could be found to
kill him, and ‘indeed he was such a
bewitching little beggar that he must
have touched the heart of a Hun.
Now he has lost his charm. He is
clumsy and ungainly, with an insolent
manner and no self-restraint. He
climbs trees, jumps dykes, devastates
the garden, steals anything he can find,
and, in a word, it is high time he went.
I have never eaten goat, but I have
always supposed that it can be eaten
so long as it is “seethed.” But how
do we stand in the matter? Does a
goat come within the scope of meat

think we can be accused of hoarding
him so long as he is alive, but as soon
as he becomes meat he puts us in a
very awkward position. Having bred
and reared him ourselves we had not
supposed that there was any question
in the matter until I came across some
paragraphs the other day as to the
handling of self-produced food. As
producers of the goat I gather that we
have only a claim as to one-third of
him, provided of course that he ranks
as pig, fowl or rabbit.
And if he ranks as sheep or cattle it
is not now legal for a farmer himself to
kill him. He must be sent to a public
market and “graded.” I have not
gathered if I should be permitted to be
represented at the grading in order to
ensure that he was not given too high
a category. -
However here is another thing. It
seems that all these difficulties would
be evaded if I simply had the goat out
and shot him.

pigeon. And quite right too. I can
vouch for it that his mother came off
a neighbouring mountain and was as

But I don't like the idea of shooting

OUR FRIENDS THE BIRDS.
A GREAT deal of publicity has of late
been given to the Army's pigeons, some
of which acted as bank messengers
when the Tank was picking our pockets
in Trafalgar Square the other day;
but no one has yet said a word for
another very remarkable ornithological
war organisation, which has its head-
quarters at Polperro.
It is not, of course, wise to divulge
all the activities which our propa-
gandists are prosecuting with so much
zeal and, it is to be hoped, success, but
the CENsor having decided that the
time has come to let the public into
the secret of those vast structures which
have for so long puzzled the passers-by

“‘In fact,’ the Colonel remarked,
‘the whole ground of patriotic and civic
duty is to be covered.’
“‘Splendid ' ' I said. “And where do
you get the birds?’
“‘We have breeding stations all over
the place,' said Colonel Bryant. ‘There
is one, for example, in the House of
Commons. And here,' he added, throw-

of their expressions of disgust are most
forcible. But being wise creatures they
come to recognise the necessity, and it
is really very interesting to see their

Colonel Bryant, who is
in charge of this interest-
ing and very ingenious
branch of public service,
willingly put his informa-
tion at the disposal of our
representative—the more
willingly, perhaps, because
of the long embargo of
silence placed upon him,
silence and his ordinary
avocation being not too
compatible. - -
“The Colonel took me,”
writes our representative,
“first to the class-rooms,
where the parrots are in-
structed in the sentences
which they are to repeat as
they fly about the country.

“WOT DO THEY 'AVE THEM VANS So LoNG FOR 2"
“’Ow’D THEY BE ABLE TO CALL 'EM THAT IF THEY DIDN'T 2"
Here we found one of the lecturers
addressing his pupils, all remarkably
attentive and intelligent-looking. They
were not at desks, as in an ordinary
educational chamber, but each occupied
a perch, and there were some hundreds
in all. At the time I entered, the pro-
vocatory class was in progress, and the
words which the lecturer was instilling
were these: “Don't you know there's a
war on ?”; “We’re at war, you know;’
‘You seem to forget we're at war'-
all delivered with a sarcastic inflexion
that cannot fail in its purpose.
“In the next room, a food economy
class was acquiring phrases calculated
to promote the conservation of the na-
tion's supplies: ‘Eat less bread,' ‘Eat
less meat,” “Remember the U-boats.'
It is considered, not, I think, without
reason, that a voice from the sky or
the upper branches of a tree enjoining
recollections of the menace of the Ger-
man submarine will have a curiously

Colonel : ‘Lord NorthcLIFFE. The
birds are being taught phrases in Ger-

Allies, and when proficient they will be
released to fly to Germany and begin
the good work.’
“But how will they find their way
to Germany ”
“‘They have been crossed with Ger-
man homing pigeons. It was an idea
of his Lordship's,’ said my cicerone.
“‘We will now,' he proceeded, “visit
the Camouflage Department.’
“Here a strange sight met the eye.
On one side of the vast hall were myriad
parrots of all the colours of the prism.
In the middle were a number of men
standing beside huge cauldrons of some

IF A “DoNT-TRAVEL PROPAGANDA" IS STARTED.
WOULD-BE HOLIDAY-MAKERS BEING URGED TO FORGO THEIR EASTER TRIPS.
THE PROBLEM OF THE GOAT.
I wonDER if we have kept our bonne
bouche too long . . . .
I should point out that the fact of
my being in possession of a reasonably
young and, as I believe, edible goat is
purely ‘fortuitous. I have no normal
traffic in goats. My energetic sister-
in-law is entirely to blame. She set
on foot about a year ago a tremendous
scheme for furnishing goats' milk for
the needy. Consequently she became
a keen, almost a perfervid, collectress
of goats. My farm was called upon to
act as a place of assembly—a sort of
rail-head. And there this kid was born
ten months ago. He should, they say,
have been eaten in adolescence, but no
one about the place could be found to
kill him, and ‘indeed he was such a
bewitching little beggar that he must
have touched the heart of a Hun.
Now he has lost his charm. He is
clumsy and ungainly, with an insolent
manner and no self-restraint. He
climbs trees, jumps dykes, devastates
the garden, steals anything he can find,
and, in a word, it is high time he went.
I have never eaten goat, but I have
always supposed that it can be eaten
so long as it is “seethed.” But how
do we stand in the matter? Does a
goat come within the scope of meat
rations, and if so is he cattle and sheep,
sparrows and rats.
think we can be accused of hoarding
him so long as he is alive, but as soon
as he becomes meat he puts us in a
very awkward position. Having bred
and reared him ourselves we had not
supposed that there was any question
in the matter until I came across some
paragraphs the other day as to the
handling of self-produced food. As
producers of the goat I gather that we
have only a claim as to one-third of
him, provided of course that he ranks
as pig, fowl or rabbit.
And if he ranks as sheep or cattle it
is not now legal for a farmer himself to
kill him. He must be sent to a public
market and “graded.” I have not
gathered if I should be permitted to be
represented at the grading in order to
ensure that he was not given too high
a category. - -
However here is another thing. It
seems that all these difficulties would
be evaded if I simply had the goat out
and shot him. Then he would rank
as game, like any other wild duck or
pigeon. And quite right too. I can
vouch for it that his mother came off
a neighbouring mountain and was as
wild as a hawk. -
And then, again, I have every reason
to put him down as a pest, along with
He has destroyed

for the destruction of goats, after the
Sparrow Club model, I suppose I can
shoot him, if I can get together enough
beaters to put him across country in
good style. Any time would do; there
is no close season now for deer.
And that raises another point.
all I know he may be venison.
But I don't like the idea of shooting
him. I don't know if I can bring my-
self to do it. He has often eaten out
of my hand.
I should have no hesitation at all in
writing direct to the FooD-CoNTRollBR
for enlightenment, but I am con-
vinced that he would think I was pull-
ing his leg. I don't know why, but
there is always supposed to be some-
thing funny about a goat. He seems
to rank in that way with the banana
and the Gorgonzola, and, perhaps one
should add, the township of Paisley.
But there is nothing funny about my
goat.
Something will have to be done at
once. I feel that the thing is closing
in on me... I feel that after a few weeks'
delay, even if he met with a fatal acci-
dent, I should find myself helpless to
deal with him until I had laboriously
collected coupons to cover every par-
ticle of his anatomy. BIs.

AN INDISPENSABLE.
DREADFUL things have been happening in our village,
and we are not sure at all that the metaphorical sunshine
in which we are at this moment basking indicates anything
more than a temporary alleviation of our troubles. We
hope for the best, but we have been tossed about and
cheated so often that even our hope has become diluted.
We therefore invoke the sympathy of Mr. Punch, being
certain that he at least will, so far as he can, refuse to see
some of his most regular readers ground to powder between
the upper and nether millstones of circumstance and fate.
There is in our village one butcher's shop with one
butcher attached to it. Other butchers there are in the
parish, who live miles away, have their own lists of cus-
tomers and declare that they can take on no others. They
might, they say, though with some difficulty, make a hard
push and accommodate one or two; but even if they could do
this they would find it all but impossible to deliver at such
a distance, and for all practical purposes they may be ruled
out. We are therefore reduced for our rationed amount of
meat to our own solitary butcher. If he were removed we
should be plunged into absolute meatlessness. All of us,
no doubt, would suffer tá the same extent—squire, parson,
barber, grocer and peer; and that would, of course, be a
good thing, though the price of it would be prohibitive even
to the richest. --- . . . . - -
Our own butcher is a young fellow on the right side of
thirty. His complexion is of a ruddiness such as I have
remarked in all butchers with whom I have become ac-
quainted. His hair is magnificently greased and shines
with an enviable lustre, and he is altogether an agreeable ||
young fellow and a kind-hearted one, except when in the
course of business he is compelled to slaughter. Still, the
necessity of his business being admitted, I am certain he
carries that business out with promptitude and dispatch
and with as much mercy as it admits. Earlier in the War,
when the great appeal was made for men, young Tadworth,
for that is our butcher's name, responded with the rest.
Iike many others, but with better reason, he was per-
staged, however, that his business was indispensable for the
community. He appealed to the Local Tribunal and was
granted exemption for some months. In the meantime he
had been medically examined and had been passed fit for
general service. This was a fatalºthing for him, for the
military authorities were determined—and small blame to :
them—not to let ruddy-complexioned and obviously healthy ||
men like Tadworth escape from their net. . In the course of
time his period of exemption drew to an end and he applied
again to the Local Tribunal. This time he was exempted
for two mónths, and was ordered not to appeal again with-
out the leave of the Tribunal... I do not propose to follow
him through all the ins and outs of his subsequent appear-
ances before one or the other of the Tribunals. Suffice it to ||
|say that there came a moment when, all his power of appeal
having been exhausted, he was faced with the certainty that
he would be called upon to join up within about a week, and
we in the village. were faced with the certainty of being
deprived of such butcher's meat as the Food ControLLER
purported to allow us.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -
: It is all very well to say, as Lord RHONDDA does, that we
shall have so much meaf per week, but the apportionment
is bound to be illusive if there is no meat of any kind to
be got, owing to the departure of our butcher to the stricken
|fields of france. The village will be surrounded with other
villages eating their fair'share of meat, while we, owing to
Tadworth's painful and immoderate conditions of health,
are forced to do without meat altogether. I have omitted to
say that Tadworth has made most gallant efforts to dispose
of his business, but all in vain; nor has he been able to
find anyone who would take it over temporarily. The
other day we heard with despair that he had received a
final calling-up notice, and the spirits of the village sank
to zero. No sooner had this happened than he received
another notice bidding him consider the former one can-
celled, and so we swing from hope to gloom and back again.
What will happen to us in the end I cannot say, for, as
Mr. Barlow, the grocer, puts it, “the end is not yet.” We
may have to live surrounded by a comparative plenty in
which we shall have no share. Are we right in counting
Briefly the story is as follows:–

FOR BRITISH PRISONERS OF WAR.
Mr. Punch begs to make an appeal, to his London
readers in particular, on behalf of Prisoners of War of the
London Regiment. Lady VICTORIA HERBERT's Scheme
has upon its books between nine hundred and a thousand
Prisoners of War, to each of whom a parcel of food, costing
nine shillings, is sent three times in every fortnight. More
than half of these parcels are supplied by the guarantee of
individual “adopters,” and it is for four hundred and fifty
men belonging to eight different Battalions of the London
Regiment that Lady VICTORIA HERBERT is now making
appeal. The parcels are made up in her own house by her
own staff. Mr. Punch begs his kind readers to give some-
thing to this good cause, making their cheques payable to
Lady Victoria HERBERT's Scheme, crossing them “Lloyd's
Bank, Oxford Street,” and addressing them to 5, Stratford
Place, W.1. -

HAviNG delighted greatly in Capt. F. BRETT YouNG's
most artistic work on the War in East Africa, Marching on
Tanga, I was much intrigued to find him, in the greater
freedom of a novel, The Crescent Moon (SECKER), returning
to the same adventurous scene. I know no author who
presents so vividly the strangeness (he objects to its being
called the “mystery”) of waste crude Africa, and when, on
his background of strange scents, strange stars and strange
bird-calls, he projects some quite admirably-drawn char-
acters in a high state of melodramatic animation, he goes
far to satisfy the most rapacious of readers. Certainly its
atmosphere and characterisation are the best of the book,
and one has to confess to as little belief in the likelihood of
an English missionary and his sister ever being planted,
fresh from home and entirely without instruction in the
ways of the country, in the centre of what was German
East Africa, as in that astronomical novelty, a new moon
that persistently rises at sunset. But if Captain YouNg
occasionally allows himself to appear uninformed he does
not lack imagination or even a qualified sympathy for that
celestial heathen deity, The Crescent Moon, so necessary to
his story, and for the Christian priest. Not unnaturally
the two came into violent conflict, since the obscure tribe
to whom the priest ministered still persisted in weird
moon-worship, involving—it would be hardly proper to say
what, but you can take my word that your own parson
would never have approved of it. You may even find it a
strain to take it all quite seriously, but, at any rate, the
Hunnish conduct of the German officer who egged on the
natives is quite convincing, and for the rest, atmosphere,
action and one or two charming people well compensate
for a dash of the improbable.
The Question of Alsace-Lorraine (Hodden AND STOUGHToN)
appears at an appropriate moment, for, although none of us
is likely to forget the wrong done in 1871, it is just as well
that a temperate statement of the case should be put before
us when the enemy is asserting a false historical claim to
these borderlands. It is true that in his little book M.
JULES DUHEM has a special cause to plead, but there is a
notable restraint about his advocacy. The truth is that he

Let her, before sitting down to her next story, make an
opportunity to hear two or more persons speaking ordinary
conversational English, and note the vocabulary that comes
naturally to their use. If (to take one example from a

was something in the scheme. Very well it worked too on

her young lady companion was as nice a heroine as even
a W.C. could require. Further there was a German dug-out
on the premises, crammed full of empty cases labelled
“high-explosive” (a circumstance neverexplained; but why
worry about such a trifle in these stirring days?), and finally
there was a Zeppelin raid timed with the most absolute

THE little things of which we lately chattered—
The dearth of taxis or the dawn of spring;
Themes we discussed as though they really mattered,
Like rationed meat or raiders on the wing:-
How thin it seems to-day, this vacant prattle,
Drowned by the thunder rolling in the West,
Voice of the great arbitrament of battle
That puts our temper to the final test.
Thither our eyes are turned, our hearts are straining,
Where those we love, whose courage laughs at fear,
Amid the storm of steel around them raining,
Go to their death for all we hold most dear.
New-born of this supremest hour of trial,
In quiet confidence shall be our strength,
Fixed on a faith that will not take denial
Nor doubt that we have found our soul at length.

Best when you face the odds and stand at bay,
Now show a watching world what stuff is in you!
Now make your soldiers proud of you to-day !

A BRIEF ROMANCE.
“THE return of the prodigall" cried Peter as my manly
form darkened the entrance to the dug-out. “But we shall
not kill the fatted calf at present. Luckily for Tony.”
Tony looked up from the fervent pages of Love Tri-
umphant.
“Why luckily for Tony?" he asked.
“Because of his curious resemblance to the fatted calf.
There might be some unfortunate mistake. But come in,
old son,” Peter went on, addressing me—“come in and
sing us songs of Kensington, and tales of far Mayfair."
I was, as you will guess, newly returned from leave,
and, with a reminiscent sigh, I settled myself in the
COrner.
“For fourteen glorious days I have lain upon silken
divans,” I began, “while lovely maidens danced before me
or brought nectar in golden goblets.”
“Very unwholesome. I don't care for the sound of it,”
said Peter. “I want something pastoral—something with
fields in it and hedges and simple farming folk and cool
dairies and—and all that."
But Tony protested. “Nonsense,” he said; “we have
pastoral pleasures enough and to spare. Me for the divans,
as our good Allies would say.”
“I have one story,” I said, “which will combine both
and thus suit the tastes of all my patrons. It is the story
of Mirabelle.”
“Mirabelle !” murmured Tony with his eyes closed, and
there rose before his mind—this is pure conjecture, of
course, but I feel confident of its truth—there rose before
his mind the picture of a resplendent figure, all green sequins
and bare arms and raven tresses and diamond tiaras.
“Mirabelle !” murmured Peter, and there rose before his
mind—pure conjecture again—the picture of a slim land-
worker in smock and corduroy breeches, backed by a thick-
set hedge, and all about her the scent of the good brown
earth.
“Mirabelle,” I said, “loves the country.”
smiled an appreciative smile.
“Good girl,” said Tony.
“She lives in London in a house not a hundred miles

“But she lives in London.”
“No house in London—” Tony began, but I went
straight on. - -
“Mirabelle is the most enchanting person in the world.”
“Dark or fair?" asked Tony. -
“Both. Dark eyes and fair hair. If you knew her you
wouldn't wonder that on my arrival, as soon as I'd
cleaned up, I went off to see her. She received me with
acclamation.” -

“Yes, or a parrot,” said Tony. “You remember it said
‘Hurrah!' Or the Australian mynah at the Zoo. That
talks, and the Zoo isn't a hundred miles from Grosvenor
Square.” -
“You’re quite wrong,” I said.
“Well, what is it?” ... *
“It’s a human girl. Why not 2" -
“And she said “Hurrah!' when she saw you?
well, we must take your word for it,” said Tony.
“You must,” I said. “And you must take my word
for it that she got off early from her hospital most days,
so that she could play about with me, thinking it right
that soldiers on leave from France should have special
privileges. We had a topping time. Mirabelle enjoys
everything and looks so nice while she's enjoying it. I
told her about you, Peter.”
“Did you, though 2"
“Yes. And she said she'd like to meet you, and when
were you coming on leave?"
“I say, did she really 2 I believe we should get on rather
well together. You say she likes the country?”
“Yes. I told her about you too, Tony, and she asked
when you were coming on leave.”
“How ripping of her!!”
“I expect you'd fall in love with her at once.”
“I've done so already,” said Tony.
“It's no good,” said Peter. “I'm first for leave, and
I've practically made up my mind to propose to her.”
“Oh, no, you can't do that. I spoke first,” said Tony.
And they began an argument which became so heated that
I was obliged to intervene.
“I’d better settle this at once,” I said. “Under dif-
ferent circumstances she would no doubt have been pleased
to accept either of you fine handsome young officers, but
as it is she cannot."
“And why?"
“Because I am engaged to her myself.” I said it quite
quietly and casually, but I was unable to keep from my
face a smile which I fear must have appeared idiotic.
“And this is your cruel way of breaking it to us,” said
Peter rather bitterly.
But Tony was utterly dejected.
“To think,” said he, “that the romance of my life should
have ended like this.”
Hurrah!' and

UNHAPPY RETURNS.
THE Captain and the Lieutenant sat
on opposite sides of the table in the dug-
out and regarded each other gloomily by
the light of a remnant of candle stuck
on the crown of the Captain's steel
helmet where it lay on the table. The
Captain sat with his hands in his
pockets and sucked repellently at an
empty pipe. The Lieutenant withdrew
his gaze from the depressing spectacle
of his companion-in-arms and let his
eyes wander round the walls of the
dug-out, decorated with fungus-covered
photographs, culled from the leading
weeklies, of ladies high in the theatrical
| world, in strange attitudes and stranger
apparel.
“Happy days," said the Captain
suddenly and with great bitterness.
“Listen to it.”
Outside (and in one or two places
inside also) the rain fell steadily, just
as it had been falling for the greater
Yart of a week. At the door there
egan a duck-board track, which wound
away into the gloom of the evening, its
progress apparently governed by no
law save its own fancy and untram-
melled by any necessity of ever arriving
began the mud, which extended as far
as and a good deal farther than the eye
could see in all directions. It was the
very best kind of mud, soft, liquid, de-
ceptive mud, and one wondered, looking
at its evil exterior, how many unsus-
pecting souls had met their end beneath
its surface.
“Rations ought to be up soon,” said
the Lieutenant. “Good luck to 'em.”
“To-day,” observed the Captain,
with the air of one for whom death
cannot possibly have any sting, “is my
birthday. Twenty-six years ago the
little old-world country village was
electrified by the news that I had been
born. Flags were hung out, bells were
rung, the verger bought a clean collar,
and my father debated with the Vicar
at some length on the rival merits of
Percival and Erasmus as names for the
future Prime Minister.”
“Ay, grandad,” interposed the Lieu-
tenant.
“And now,” pursued the Captain,
“here I sit, a palsied hulk, the wreck
of a man that once was wont to cause
fair ladies to turn in the street to gaze
after him.”
“Your back-view is the best,” mur-
mured the Lieutenant.

as he warmed to his subject. “No.
And again, No.”
“I think I shall,” said the Lieutenant.
“To-day will be exactly like yester-
day and exactly like to-morrow, as far
as I am concerned,” went on the
Captain, moodily hurling his revolver
at a rat of mammoth proportions that
was seeking to drown its sorrows in a
pool of rain-water on the floor. “Where
are the costly gifts? Echo answers,
Search me. No one will send me the
silver-backed brushes, the trouser-press
mounted in platinum, the silk pyjamas
or the last year's calendar. These
things are not for me. I am forgotten;
and here I lie, passed over by the
hurrying throng, a mildewed wreck.”
“Oh, is that mildew 2 º' asked the
Lieutenant with interest. “I just
thought you hadn't shaved for a week.”
At this point the candle expired
abruptly, and the Lieutenant, after
vainly striking nine matches, lighted a
second fragment. “Those rations ought
to be up by now,” he said.
Even as he spoke there arose in the
distance a tumult of voices, obviously
proceeding from some little distance
down the duck-board track. “That

PUNCH,
The voices drew nearer, and it be-
came plain that they proceeded from
two persons engaged in heated converse
as they walked. The occupants of the
dug-out listened with interest to the
peculiar squelching noises that marked |
the progress of the procession, which
pursued its way until apparently within
some forty yards of the dug-out.
Even the face of the Captain had
begun to show traces of faint interest,
when on a sudden came a quick sliding
sound, a thick oily splash, one hurried
but forcible remark, and then silence.
But not for long. In a few seconds
the evening air was rent and ripped by
the most masterly and inspired flow of
language that it had ever been the
Captain's privilege to listen to. On
and on it went, rising to undreamed-of
heights of eloquence for over a minute,
and then faltered, died down and finally
ceased, to be followed by an urgent
demand for assistance. The other voice
now joined the anthem, and the sounds
that followed indicated to the relieved
listeners that some wretched man was
being saved from a horrible end.
Presently there came a knock at the
entrance to the dug-out; the waterproof
'sheet which served as a door was thrust
aside, and a face, round, heated and mud-
besmeared, appeared at the opening.
“Good evenin', Sir,” said the face.
“Good evening, Quartermaster-Ser-
:geant,” said the Captain; “and why
have you shed the light of your pre-
sence upon us in this wise? Come
inside and narrate to us of your adven-
tures upon the road.”
Thus adjured, the face entered,
followed by what at first sight the
Lieutenant took to be a section of the
bank of the Thames at Wapping at low
water, but which on closer investiga-
tion proved to be the remainder of the
Quartermaster-Sergeant.
“Fellorf them perishin' boards, Sir,”
said the warrior. “And there's a parcel
for you near as big as this dug-aht,
which I thought as 'ow I'd better bring
up myself, seeing as 'ow I was passin'
, this way.”
The Captain started, glanced at the
Lieutenant, and, pouring some whisky
into an aluminium cup, handed it to
the muddy Mercury.
“Thank 'ee, Sir,” said the latter,
and, wiping his moustache on the back
of his hand, thrust his head through
, the doorway and hailed some person
unseen. Whereupon there staggered
in a small rotund private, tottering
under the weight of an enormous sack,
entirely covered with mud, which he
let fall on the floor with a crash. This,
when opened, disgorged a very large
parcel, securely bound in canvas and

large knife.

“If you have finished the preliminary
address,” said the Lieutenant, “what
about revealing the glories that lie hid
beneath that calm exterior 2"
The Captain cut the cord and emptied
the contents of the parcel out on to
the table. For a second there was
utter silence in the dug-out, and then
two loud gasps, as the Captain and the
Lieutenant regarded with protruding
eyes one steel body-shield (warranted
to turn a bullet at fifty yards), five
tins of antiseptic tooth-paste, one large
box-periscope, seventeen Oxo-cubes,
three copies of The Church Times, and,
wrapped in cotton-wool, a large framed
photograph of a stout old gentleman
with long white whiskers and a bene-
volent smile.
With a shaking hand the Lieutenant
picked up a small card that lurked
beneath a tin of tooth-paste, glanced
at it and handed it to the Captain, who
had sunk back into his seat and was
reaching feverishly for his revolver,
forgetting that it lay on the corpse of the
gigantic rat in the pool of rainwater.
The Captain took the card and re-
garded it with the expression of one
who sees a snake in his bath. On it was
inscribed in a clear round hand:—
“With birthday greetings from Uncle
Jasper" =
WAR-TIME ECONOMICS.
WE had been to the meeting of the
local Food Vigilance Society, and when
we left the hall it was raining. My
wife said she was glad that she had
married a man who always carried an
umbrella.
It did not take me a minute to put
it up; it is a peculiar umbrella, but I
am used to it.
“But why do you carry a thing like
that 2" she asked, as she took my arm.
“That, my dear, is your fault,” I said.
I have always been unfortunate with
umbrellas. My average is about four a
year, but I rather spoilt it last summer
when I lost three in two months.
The third was a birthday present
from my wife. It was a gorgeous thing
in green silk, with a gold waistband
and a tortoiseshell handle. I prefer
them plain. The third time I took it
out I left it in the train. When I told
my wife about it she said it was time
I economised, and I promised to do so.
Accordingly I went to my umbrella
shop, and told the proprietor, who had
come forward with the affable smile he
reserved for his best customers, that I
wanted a cheap umbrella.
He said he quite understood, and
with a lightning flap he opened one.
“A plain serviceable article like this,”
he said. “Quite a good silk at the
“A cheap one,” I repeated.
His smile fell ten degrees. He said
the best was the cheapest in the long run.
“But it won't have a long run,” I
said. “An umbrella lasts me barely
three weeks.”
“In that case this might suit you.”
He unrolled another. “A good strong
mixture. Twelve-and-sixpence.”
“The cheapest you have,” I said.
He savagely produced another.
“Seven-and-sixpence,” he said.
“You have nothing cheaper than
that, I suppose?”
“Oh, yes, we have,” he said, with a
sneer. “An umbrella we keep for
people who say they only want one to
go home with. Cotton. Five-and-six.”
I took it. I could afford to lose ten
of these a year and yet save money; and
also gain a reputation for independence
of character and common sense, like
George Withers. Half the respect we
have for George is due to his umbrella.
It is a family heirloom, with a whale-
bone frame; and the stick is a weighty
oak sapling. We joke about it, but we
are almost as proud of it as he is.
No one joked about my umbrella. I
noticed one or two furtive glances as I
placed it in the rack; and afterwards
I saw people trying not to look at it.
I attempted one or two jokes myself,
but they fell flat. It looked what it
was a cheap umbrella. Never mind,
I should soon lose it.
It was neither ornamental nor useful.
Quite early two of the ribs came out
of their sockets and had to be replaced
each time I opened it. Then the stick
warped, and it was difficult to put the
thing up. Nor would it stay up. The
spring catch refused to act. I had to
brace the handle against my back and
hold the frame in position while I
fished for the spring.
Of course I did not leave that um-
brella in the train. I simply could not
forget it, try as I would. You may
forget to remember a thing, but you
cannot remember to forget it. Not if
you play the game, as I did with that
umbrella.
Once I nearly succeeded. I was
talking eagerly to a friend as I left the
train, but an officious person ran after
me with the thing.
Several times when the light was
bad in the hall I managed to lend it to
friends, but they always sent it back
the next day.
And I found that while saving on
umbrellas I had to spend more on
other things. My friends could afford
to wear old clothes, but I could not
while carrying that umbrella.
As with bent heads we struggled
homewards against the rain I summed
“A summer suit which I could have
done without; a new overcoat—my old
one is still good—at least three pairs
of gloves, and two hats—one way or
another that umbrella has cost me—"
“Mind 1" cried my wife.
Too late | Another umbrella crashed
into us. Mine got the worst of the
collision: it collapsed—an utter wreck.
The stranger hastily apologised; said
it was entirely his fault, and he could
not allow a lady to suffer through his
clumsiness; thrust his umbrella into
my hand, seized what was left of mine,
and disappeared.
The umbrella he left with me was a
very superior article. It had a silk
cover, an ebony stick mounted in silver,
with a malachite ball at the top; and
it had a tassel.
I lost it next day.

Once “on leaf" he went ashore,
Drank one glass of ale—no more
(That's what all defaulters do,
One glass, yes! but never two);
Yet, alas, there's more to come,
For he got the maximum.
Reader, wait until you've heard
His account of what occurred;
How it was he came to make
Such a ludicrous mistake,
Such a lamentable slip—
Brought his gal off to the ship,
Got himself into a mess
Just through absent-mindedness.
After several hours ashore
He forgot that “leaf" was o'er
Till he saw the “Liberty

That was quite a sad mishap,
For his gal was on his lap

“Small, yer know, but proper smart”),
Sitting restful-like quite near,
Not a cable from the pier.

TRIALS OF OUR AIRMEN.
Stolid Highlander. “HAE YE BROKE YER MACHINE”
A CALL0P THROUGH AMERICA.
BY AN IILUSTRIOUS IAWYER.
I.—THE TROTTING Ostrich.
WITH so much to prepare and occupy
my mind—for my programme included
three months of continuous oratory,
broken only by luncheons, dinners,
suppers, Turkish baths, train journeys
and visits to remarkable men—I don't
know how I could have endured the
voyage but for the trotting ostrich.
At first there was the novelty of the de-
parture, as we sailed on, the destroyers
on each side, puissant symbols of the
ancient sea-power of Great Britain, our
own vessel ploughing a majestic course
through the purple sea, the enchanting
coastline of Ireland on our beam, and
the shimmering airboats glittering in
the wintry sun. Having strained my
eyes through my field-glasses, a parting
gift from dear BEAVERBRook, for a last
view of the Convention, I hastened to
the gymnasium and, carefully selecting
the same saddle as that used by Mr.
BALFour, I mounted the trotting os-
trich and never left his back—I mean
voluntarily—until Sandy Hook appeared
in sight. Try as I would, however, I
could never induce him to break into
| my speeches with such success that in
all the campaign I never repeated a
single sentence. Nulli secundus.
III.-STERN NEw York.
Of New York in the grip of the real-
ities of war I say nothing. But I saw
much. Let me indeed state that but
for its eminent men, its beautiful
actresses, its dances and its supper-
rooms, such as SHERRY's and the
Cocoanut Grove, New York might have
been too depressing. The members
of the NorthcLIFFE Mission, chief of
whom was Mr. GEOFFREY BUTLER, who
organised so wonderfully all our travel-
ling, had, however, paved the way, and
nothing that could be done to make a
simple English traveller bear up was
omitted. Never shall I forget the
charm of Miss MAXINE ELLIOTT or the
graceful convolutions of one of the
Spanish ladies.
After a Turkish bath I made my first
speech at a lunch at the Millionaires'
Club. I was on my feet for three
hours, and the spirit shown by all the
listeners was admirable. That was,
however, the only spirit present, for
America is gradually falling to Prohi-
bition. To me it made little difference,
but my secretaries were far from pleased.
I persuaded him to stay, especially
as we were assured that St. Louis, one
of the cities on our list, was still im-
penitent. Ad astra.
WI.-ColonBL House.
I now quote occasionally from my
diary:-Dec. 27th, 1917–To-day saw
Colonel House. He really is a very
remarkable man. I could see that he
was pleased when as I left I pressed his
hand and said, “You are more, Sir, than
a House; you are a Terrace.” In re-
sponse he said very kindly that he
looked forward with despair to the time
when, after my departure, there would
be only Smithless days.
To-night was the night for the ban-
quet at SHERRY's. It certainly was a
most amazing assembly if measured
by the importance of the guests, who,
numbering ninety-two, sat around the
vast table, and represented I know not
how much wealth, learning and im-
portance. Their kindness and enthus-
iasm were so great as quite to carry
one away. They stood up several
times, cheered loudly in the course of a
speech I made and altogether showed
so much warmth that I was deeply
affected. Tears sprang to my eyes.
No jury could have resisted me. Never

a gallop. Thus occupied I composed
before had I so realised how emotional

war can make one. Nothing but the
blank looks of my secretaries at a side
table, unable to procure any but tee-
total beverages, brought me back to
earth. HAROLD later went so far as to
say that because the country was dry
there was no need for my speeches to
be; but I attributed that merely to
brotherly affection. Arcades ambo.
XIII.-MR. SECRETARY LANSING.
December 31st, 1917.-This being New
Year's Eve my secretaries were natur-
ally anxious to celebrate it, but no facili-
ties being at hand I went instead to see
Mr. Secretary LANSING. We discussed
foreign policy for some seconds, and I
left him greatly impressed. He is a
very remarkable man. Like everyone
else that I met in this hospitable coun-
try he gave me letters of introduction
to a Judge. It is an American habit.
Cedant arma togae.
On leaving Mr. Secretary LANSING I
lunched off gold plate with the MoRGAN
Partners, to whom I made one of my
lighter speeches—only two hours—and
gave incidentally some valuable finan-
cial advice. Among leading Americans
present was Senator B. KELLogg, who
was delighted to hear of his cousin
SHIRLEY's success in London. I have
just mailed him an extract from her
theatre programme, stating that her
return to revue was at once the
“bravest” and “finest thing” that
“any actress has ever done in the
history of the modern stage.” This
will, I know, give the Senator pleasure.
Paz nobiscum.
XVII.-CINCINNATI.
January 1st, 1918,-After a delight-
ful evening in the enormous house of
the proprietor of The Washington Post,
where two hundred guests dined and
four hundred danced, we left for Cin-
cinnati, where my real work was to
begin, and in due course for St. Louis.
But we had to wait three hours at the
station in the cold. The train was late.
BUTLER had at last failed us. But I
managed to get my Turkish bath and
be in time for lunch at one of the
Rotary Clubs which have become such
a feature of American business and
national life. They are so called from
the fact that, in order to circulate, the
members keep on moving their seats,
as in the tea-party in LEWIS CARRoLL.
Although I must have addressed a dozen
of these clubs I never quite got over
my feeling of dizziness. Nisi prius.
In the evening I spoke at a mass
meeting. It was my first real oration
and lasted for five hours. The friendli-
ness of the audience towards us ex-
ceeded belief. I have not seen more

our old, far-away election days. As a
result I was offered the famous LINcoLN
statue by BARNARD, over which there
has been so much discussion, and which
is situated in this city, but I declined
to deprive them of it. The feet are too
big. Ea: pede Herculem.
XXI.—ST. Louis.
January 5th, 1918.-St. Louis at
last ! My secretaries immediately dis-
appeared. I was taken to a club where
the best cocktail-mixer in America is
to be found, and he gave me free his
little monograph on that fascinating
science. St. Louis, however, may not be
In the evening I spoke for several
hours at a dinner given by the American
Bar Association.
XXIII.-CHICAGo AND TAY PAY.
January 6th, 1918.-We arrived at
Chicago in a terrible snowstorm, which
I must speak to BUTLER about, as it was
much colder than I like. Not even
Mr. INSULL, with all his influence, could
abate it. INSULL is an Englishman who
is now one of Chicago's kings of industry.
Although business affairs have forced
him to become an American citizen he

defect to be so incapable of tempering

enthusiasm at any public meeting since

One result was that T. P. O'Connor,

Nil desperandum. He came, however,
to lunch the next day, and his hospitable
snuff-box made me feel at home. With
perfect tact he refrained from any
allusion to galloping. Nota bene.
XLIX. —THE RETURN.
The expedition being over I sailed
for home on February 23rd, after having
spoken on an average seven hours a
day. Nothing could exceed the enthusi-
asm of my meetings and I shall think
kindly of America as long as I live.
And America, I fancy, will not forget
me. I'inis coromat opus.
From a letter received by a subaltern
from his tailors:–
“We are in receipt of your favour to hand,
and beg to state that our charge for turning
a British War is approximately 45/-.”
The CHANCELLOR of THE Exch EQUER
ought to find out how they do it.
“People inclined to disbelief in the existence
of a gun firing from such a distance may be
reminded that the difference between 75 miles
and the greatest previously-recorded range of
about 25 miles is less than the difference be-
tween the maximum range of our naval guns
and those of Nelson's day.”—The Globe.
The fact that NELSoN's guns had ap-
parently a range of minus twenty miles
or so explains his preference for board-

“I was the hero,” said William, “of
a rather moving little drama yesterday
morning.”
“Release the episode,” said [.
“You know the four cross-roads on
the way from the hospital to the town?”
“Two cross ones, William, and two
nice quiet ones with tall hedges. T

“Well, I've been meeting the Padre
there every morning at almost exactly
the same time. “Shoulder better?' he
shouts. ‘Yes, thanks,' I say; ‘sermon
easier, I hope,’ and we pass on with
mutual esteem. But about a week ago
he pulled a little black book out of his
pocket and asked me to write my name
in it and quote a line or two of poetry
opposite the date of my birthday.
‘Frightfully sorry, Padre,' I said next
day, “but I only remembered it once
when I was depositing some more over-
draft in the bank and there was too
much nap on the nibs to suit me. You
shall have it to-morrow.'
“Next morning I awoke with the
sense of something terrible impending,
but I couldn't think what on earth it
was until I was two hundred yards
from the hospital. There was only one
thing to do then and I did it. I doubled
smartly down to the cross-roads, beat
him by about two minutes, and took a

- dodge lasted me for four days. Yester-
day, to my consternation, I saw him
already at the cross-roads when I was
half-way there. Fortunately I am a
pretty cool hand in a crisis. I jumped
over the three-foot wall on the right,
lay down flat on my front and bit the
grass.
“Talk about barrages! I don't think
I can ever have had the wind up worse
than I had as I listened to the thud-

nearer. They came right up to me, and
then the worst happened. He stopped.

nothing happened. After a bit I very
slowly turned my face round and looked
upwards. You'll hardly believe me,
but I'm blest if he wasn't sitting on the
wall sixteen inches away, with his back
to me, making notes in an A.B. 153
with a fountain-pen. I fancy he was
doing a turn of scout-work about the
lambs and daffodils for Sunday morn-
ing. I don't blame him. It was a

in, you remember, but a bit damp under
face.

on the wall, and began to do a sort of
reverie stunt with his head in his hands.
Immediately a bright thought came to
me. I wriggled the birthday-book out
of my pocket, reached up ever so cauti-
ously (with my game arm too) and
collared the ink-grenade. I got my
name down all right, though it was a
bit wobbly, and then for some extra-

tively I could only remember two com-
binations of verse in the whole code-
book. One was—

which struck me as a bit fulsome, and
the other—

ence to the dump to complete it.
“Then I had a sudden inspiration,
got it down with one rapid ink-burst,
and returned his weapon to the wall.
“The worst part of the programme
of course was still to do. I gave the
thing several minutes to dry, and then
began to wriggle backwards very slowly
and quietly through the grass. Even
with two perfectly good arms it would
have been worse than a night patrol in
front of the wire. I hardly dared to
breathe; I had my heart and a ration
or so of cowslips in my mouth, and I
made about two yards a minute, with the
buckle of my Sam Browne strafing the
worms all the way. At last I got back
to a gap in the wall by a pretty thick-
hawthorn bush, crawled out, got up
and straightened myself, and came as
jauntily as I could down the path.
“Hallo, Padre,' I said. “Day-dream-
ing?'
“‘Isn't it glorious weather 2' he
said. “Have you noticed how the
flowers are coming up in the fields?’
“‘No; are they really ” I said,
brushing the unexpended portion of
greenery out of my moustache. ‘By
the way, I've been wanting to meet
you for days. I've got your docket
signed.'
“He thanked me and turned to the
place. “But I see you didn't get a very
good pen after all,' he murmured, look-
ing rather sadly at the areas under ink.
“‘I'm sorry, Padre,' I said, “but
it was the best I could find.' Then I
waved farewell and left him.” |
“Thank you, William,” I said, “but
you haven't told me yet what your
final quotation was.”
“‘Lest we forget,’” replied William
with much feeling, “‘Lest we forget.”

owns a very large number. In the field
adjoining our paddock, for instance, he
was, when we arrived, camping out
forty-six. As a rule I cannot count
cows or sheep in the mass; there never
seems to be any definite point at which
one can begin or leave off. But in the
present instance I had no difficulty.
Anxious to establish friendly relations,
I presented one of them across the
paddock fence with an ounce of some
tobacco which my sister had sent me
the year before as a birthday gift. The
look of gratitude in the lady's eyes as
she rapturously chewed the quid amply
compensated me for the sacrifice I was
making. Next morning there was an
orderly queue of forty-six expectant
cows ranged along the fence. I shall
never forget the moan of disappoint-
ment with which they turned away
when I explained that I was out of
tobacco offal.
It was rather a shock to us when
after our arrival our landlord told us
he could not spare us more than a pint
of milk a day, and that we should have
to fetch that ourselves. Our normal
consumption is two quarts. *
“Never mind,” said my wife; “there
are two milkmen in the village.”
It is always a difficult thing to catch
a milkman at home, unless one calls
before dawn; and we were a mile and
a half from the village. But I had the
luck to run into both of them on their
morning rounds. Number One had
halted at a garden gate and was stand-
ing in the road behind his cart reaching
for a half-pint measure.
“Can you supply me with milk?” I
asked politely.
Apparently he did not hear my ques-
tion. I repeated it. He turned and
waved to a female figure at the other
end of the garden path.
“Coming, Miss, coming,” he called,
and without a glance in my direction
he hurried in through the gate.
A few minutes later I made the same
request of Number Two. He was com-
ing from a kitchen-door to his cart.
“Can you supply me with milk?”
He paused and looked at me curi-
ously.
“Milk?” he said.
“Milk' " he exclaimed in a tone half
of pity, half of contempt, and climbed
into his cart and drove rapidly away.
As I walked home every field I passed
seemed full of cows.
. To my wife, who wept over my
failure, I offered brave words of solace.
“The tide will turn,” I said hopefully.
I am not sure that this is the right
phrase to use about milk.
During the next fortnight I went
every day on my bicycle to the dairy
which had supplied us, in the pre-
cottage era. It took me just the whole
morning to get there and back. And
then, as I had prophesied, the tide
turned. It was the postman who res-
cued us, a very affable man with far-
away eyes. He had heard, he said, of
our difficulty with the landlord and the
milkmen. “As luck would have it he
had a brother-in-law in the trade, from
whom he thought he could procure
what we wanted. It was too far for
his relative to deliver, but he himself
could bring us the milk with the letters.
The only question was the price. Of
course it was a long way.
“The usual price is sixpence a quart,”
said my wife. -
The look in the postman's eyes grew
yet more remote as he gazed dreamily
over her shoulder up the valley. “This
would be a shilling,” he murmured.
We closed with the offer.
I have since learnt by a side wind
that his brother-in-law is the Number

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Where England Sets Her Feet (CoLLINs) is, as indeed
you might suppose from the title, a staunchly imperialistic
tale, set in the spacious days of the Virgin Queen, and
containing much pleasant if rather disjointed adventuring,
and one very attractively-drawn character. Not the hero,
though he is pleasant enough in a colourless way; and
certainly not the heroine, who is throughout practically an
absentee (after her boy-and-girl love-scenes with the hero
she fades entirely out of the story till its finish); the great
creation of the story, upon whom Mr. BERNARD CAPEs has
lavished both art and obvious affection, is Master Clerivault,
the “dear fantastic” patriotic worshipper of that England
whose son it was his wish to be thought; dreamer, brag-
gart and Empire-builder in one. Most of Master Clerivault's
speeches have an excellent ring, though that about lands
where English blood is shed becoming fiefs to England,
“for there each grave becomes a plat of English mould,”
struck me as a halting paraphrase of certain lines in which
the same thought has been more nobly expressed. As for the
actual story, that, as I have said, is an affair of episodes;
of Brion's upbringing in the lonely house, his introduction
(very prettily done) to Romance; his encounter with my
LORD of LEIcESTER, whose natural son he was ; thereafter
some voyaging to the Spanish main, and the rediscovery of
the heroine in the nick of time to round off the tale. Truth
to tell, picturesque as all this is, I found the pace of the
author's palfrey rather jog-trot for adventure of such
quality; the book throughout is at its best in the quieter
passages, and especially those that introduce the admirable
Clerivault, as aforesaid. One final complaint: surely the

(GRANT RICHARDs) is Mr. AUGUST ScHvAN, who says of
himself that “he happens to have been born in the capital

that he assumes no responsibility for this fact, and I may
as well assure him at once that I don't dream of blaming
him for being a Swede. Had he been consulted he might
perhaps have arranged matters differently. It is quite
certain that he numbers amongst his ancestresses the late
CAss ANDRA, for a large part of his life has been spent in
prophesying true things which nobody believed until they
had unfortunately happened. He also gave good advice to
those who refused to take it. “Only four months before the
outbreak of the War the author told a well-known Conser-
vative and Military Club in London that the British Army
was totally inadequate to meet the German Army.” It is
also to be noted that “he had taken occasion to publish an
article on Scandinavia in The Nineteenth Century magazine
which was so true that it made the King of SwedEN deprive
the author of his title of Chamberlain.” This, however,
has not prevented him from developing his plan for ensur-
ing peace. The State, according to him, is the universal
enemy and must be abolished, so that men may live under
a system of “Supernational Law,” nations being considered
“as autonomous administrative subdivisions of humanity,
and armed forces being limited to those necessary for
maintaining law and order.” Mr. SchvaN is in deadly
earnest and has a detestation of the KAISER and his people
which is most refreshing.

in Maw's life about which I mean to be as reticent as he
was. When Diana married him she was well aware that
he could not disclose this secret to her, but all the same
she was soon suffering from a very reasonable jealousy.
The conditions offered peculiar encouragement to an emo-
tional atmosphere. Diana had one of the most superb
voices in the world; Maw was a distinguished playwright
and wrote his plays for Adrienne de Gervais, who was a star-
actress and—but that is the secret. It is a high tribute to
Mrs. MARGARET PEDLER that she compels one to believe in
the beauty of Diana's voice, and indeed her picture of musical
life in London, if rather highly coloured, is really well-
drawn. A passing word of praise is also due to the minor
characters, who fit satisfactorily into the back-seats allotted
- - - to them. But Maac's secret
never seemed to me to deserve
all the fuss that was made
about it.

the fact about the public's atti-

For the most part the stories

problem of what a lady should do whose husband has
deliberately saved his own life at what might have been

hardly tell you that the solution judged correct is that she
should wait till the author has done with the husband,
and then marry the hero. In fine you will light here upon

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE KAISER GIVEN AWAY.
It was a little awkward, you must own.
Just as your sabre started off to rattle
Prior to carving up the enemy zone
In what was boomed as WILLIAM's battle;
Just as you told us how you hated war,
How you, whose heart all bloodshed tends to harrow,
Obvious victim of the lust for gore
That permeates the British marrow,
Proposed (and here your eyes with warm tears ran
Such as the beasts of Nile exude with unction)
To end the grisly fight which GREY began
Whose perfidy knew no compunction;
It was unfortunate (we all see that)
When, at an hour ill-timed for truth's exposure,
Out of the Envoy's bag emerged the cat
And on your legends clapped the closure.
| For now from German lips the world may know
Facts that should want some skill for their con-
founding—
How Potsdam forced alike on friend and foe
A war of Potsdam's sole compounding;
How you, who itched to see the bright sword lunged,
Still bleating peace like innocent lambs in clover,
In all that bloody business you were plunged
Up to your neck, and something over.
And, having fed on little else but lies,
Your people, with the hollow place grown larger
Now that the truth has cut off these supplies,
May want your head upon a charger.
THE RIGHT COLOUR.
| THE argument began in a trench somewhere on the Cam-
brai. Front. It might still have been proceeding but for
the fact that a few hundred thousand Bosches came over to
argue a bigger point, and made it necessary for Jock Fraser
and Alf Hayes, to say nothing of the rest of the nth Fusi-
| liers, to retire under protest—very violent protest.
Jock started it. Jock delights in theological disputes,
and being a Glasgow man regards himself as an authority
on most subjects. When therefore, during one of the peri-
odical discussions regarding the finding of Moses in the
bulrushes, Alf recklessly referred to the Prophet as a “black
baby,” Jock pounced upon him instantly.
“Ye needna show yer ignorance,” he said in pitying
tones. “Auld Moses wasna black, Alf. He wis as white
as you an' me.”
“Garn Wot d'you know abaht it?” retorted Alf ag-
gressively. “Egyptians is black; leastways, not exactly
black like niggers, but a kinder coffee-colour. You can't
tell me nothin' abaht the colour of Gippies, my lad. I've
served in Egypt an' seen 'em.”
Although he is only twenty-six, Alf proudly terms him-
self “an old sweat,” and is inclined to pose as a patriarch
because he has seven years' service to his credit and was
|
soldiering in the East when the War started.
| “Moses, wasna, an Egyptian, ye fule,” Jock explained.
“Mosks wis a Hebrew, and Hebrews are no' niggers.”
| “Egyptian 'Ebrews is black, I tell yer, and a pal o' mine
wot's in Palestine says the Jews there are nearly black, so
you can't kid me Moses was white.”
“He wad be kind o' tanned, maybe, but he wis as white
Jock had not washed for four days, but Alf failed to notice
the opportunity this presented, although he did make several
impolite remarks concerning Jock's personal appearance,
habits and ancestry.
“I tell yer Moses was an Egyptian, and Gippies is
browny-black,” he reiterated.
The argument became heated, and most of the men of
the platoon joined in and took sides. Some of them
strongly supported Alf's view, for the fact that Alf had been
in Egypt carried weight. For an hour the voice of Jock
Fraser could be heard raised in protest, and he was still
vainly striving to convince Alf of the whiteness of Moses
when the Germans came their way.
For a time the colour of the Hebrew Prophet became
of secondary importance, but Jock was determined not
to let the matter drop. As he hurled bombs among the
masses of grey men he could see through the mist he
thought of a new argument which would, he believed, con-
vince Alf. *
It was in the evening, after the regiment had withdrawn
to a new position, that Jock suddenly discovered Alf was
missing, and he began to make agitated inquiries. A man
had noticed Alf drop out in the open and mentioned the fact
wearily.
“I’m going back to find him,” Jock announced. “I
canna let auld Alf die wi'oot convincing him that Moses
wasna black.” -
They called him fool and other names, tried to dissuade
him and pointed out the hopelessness of finding Alf, even
if he was still alive; but Jock would not listen and even
ignored the Sergeant's commands.
Nearly an hour later he crawled back, shot through the
left arm and the right leg, but dragging with him Alf, who
was badly wounded, unconscious, but still living. Then
Jock collapsed, after muttering something incoherent about
the infant Moses.
The bearers took him and Alf away to the same clearing-
station, and eventually they were sent down together to
the base hospital, and happened to be placed in the same
ward. When Alf recovered enough to take notice, it was
to find Jock sitting up in the next bed.
“It was you wot brought me in, Jock, wasn't it 2"
inquired Alf. “You lugged 'old o' me just as them two big
Fritzes was comin' to get me?”
“Ay, I shot them,” Jock answered in matter-of-fact
tones. “Noo, Alf, aboot Moses. I'm wantin' to convince
ye that Moses wis as white as me.”
“I reckon you know more abaht Moses than I do, old
chum,” said Alf. “And if he was like you he was a white
man—all through.” And he held out his hand.
Jock, pleased more by the concession than by the com-
pliment, leant across and with a shamefaced grin shook
hands.

KIDNEYs For THE MESS.
OF all the General Staff Officers
Third Grade that had recently been
created, Pink William was the nicest
and the ruddiest. He presented such
a picture when, flushed and a little
timid, he first arrived in the No. 2 Mess
of the Division that they made him
Mess President on the spot, a post
which he accepted gracefully, there
being no other course open to him.
Horrified at first at the dissatisfaction
openly expressed at a Mess which any
regimental officer would envy, he never-
theless put heart and soul into his task
and in a very short time achieved won-
ders. Yet in spite of all his efforts
Pink William could not but be aware
that behind all the nods and
expressions of approval he re-
ceived, there was a peculiar
element of reserve. He knew
it—he felt it. Yet, rack his
brains as he might, this inde-
finable something eluded him
completely. In despair, one
night after his second glass of
port, he surprised the Great
Ones present by breaking down
| utterly and demanding to be
told at once what more could
be expected of him. Had they
not fish, flesh, fowl, seventeen
kinds of drinks and real lump
sugar? What was the elusive
something 2
And the answer came, short

pie-dish, lay the remains of a steak-

Fearful of being denounced as a food
spy of the baser sort and of being done
away with secretly in consequence, he
rushed back to headquarters and let
loose the sleuth-hounds of war. Recon.
noitring parties which investigated the
wilds of back areas presently brought
back the joyful news that without doubt
kidneys were in the country; that in
certain cases sheep had left the base
with th; organ in question intact.
The joyful news came only just in
time, for the agony, of having to face a
barrage of eyes bawling “Kidneys” at

upon his health. That night, again
over the second glass of port, he off-

a sleepless night.
Morning brought determination.
Sheep were in the country and sheep
had kidneys; ergo the long-felt want
could easily be supplied. Alas for his
untimely optimism, a visit to the
Senior Supply Officer dashed all his
hopes to the ground. “Kidneys?” He
poured cold scorn upon him ; seemed
indeed to take it as a personal affront.
“Kidneys? Ha!” he laughed hollowly
at him. Army sheep didn't have
kidneys.
Well, how did they get on without
kidneys? Why, just as British oysters
got on without pearls.
Discouraged beyond measure Pink
William made his way back, and, pene-
trating into the purlicus of a large farm
standing well back from the road in its
own midden, came upon an outhouse
of the kitchen department, occupied
by Mess cooks and bottlewashers, and
there—there in the broad light of
loaded the story of his vicissitudes upon
the astonished members of the Mess.
He gave them a moving picture of his
discovery in the outhouse. Patrols
had, he explained, reported a suspected
kidney-dump in this vicinity, but cross
observation by special observers had
failed to obtain the necessary confirm-
ation. Number 1 Section Kidney-
Detectors (a branch of the Sound-
Ranging section) were also at a loss,
while the Fifty-first Sub-section of the
Tenth Messenger Dog Company, after
getting hot on the trail, had dashed all
his newborn hopes to the ground by
wantonly destroying the evidence in a
spasm of greed. But the vitally im-
portant consideration which he wished
to lay before the Mess was that kidneys
were in the country, and he begged
that the question might be gone into
sympathetically.
Having thus unburdened himself of
the responsibility and made a special
—ºr Staff - Lieutenant), , who was
the Senior Supply Officer, he returned
to the office, signed a location report
upside down, and went sick.
Left alone the senior members of the
Mess did the proper thing as a matter
of course. They held a conference.
“This,” began the representative of
the General Staff as usual, “is obviously
a ‘Q' matter.”
“On the contrary,” said “Q" firmly,
“as a question of supply it might possi-
bly be ‘Q,' but as a question of policy
it is obviously ‘G.' If, on the other
hand, it is considered a matter of dis-
cipline, it is obviously ‘A.’”
“On the contrary,” said “A,” “this
is a question of diet, and should there-
fore be referred to the Director of
Medical Services.”
- “On the contrary,” said the
A.D.M.S., “as it has reference
to animals in particular, I
think the advice of the Weterin-
+ ary Service should be sought.”
ºf The D.A.D.V.S. could not
see it. It seemed to him that
the matter involved questions
of traffic control and should be
referred to the A.P.M.

tight, wondering how on earth
they were going to shift it on
to him.
The Area Commandant, a
Brigadier (graded for pay as a

was one which obviously

the General Staff with a Napoleonic
flash of the eye—“there is but one way
to bring our enemy to his knees. We
must strike at the most vulnerable part
of his armour. Now what is the ten-

The question was met with silence.
Nobody had thought of such things in
connection with Supply Officers. .

on the General Staff, “all branches will

Joan is two to-day, and I think it is
quite time she began to take life more
seriously. Until recently she has occu-
pied a position of splendid isolation,
but last week her nose was suddenly
and violently dislocated, and she is now
only my elder daughter. Since the
arrival of the interloper, in another
place, Joan and I have been left to our
own devices at home, and it has be-
come her regular habit to call me in the
morning, to watch me eat my break-
fast and to hustle me off thereafter,
“in puff-puff,” en route for my White-
hall desk.
So she has had unlimited opportunity
for unburdening her soul to me at
leisure, and debate has often waxed hot
between us. But, much as I appreciate
the unburdening of her soul, I really
have to draw the line at her emptying
armfuls of dolls all over me, particularly
Tussups. I really dislike Tussups now.
To save further mystification I may
explain that “Tussup” is Joanese for
“Cuthbert,” which is the name of a
certain type of rabbit-doll. This doll is
an effigy of , but I needn't labour
it; the fact is I am, broadly speak-
ing, a “Tussup” myself, for the reason
that I am of military age and at the
same time tied by the leg to a Govern-
ment desk. Now I don't pretend that
my dislike for this particular type of
doll springs from a guilty and craven
conscience, because it doesn't. When
I first saw one in a shop window my
sense of the fitness of things was tickled,
and I straightway purchased one and
bore it home in triumph to Joan.
But unfortunately some waggish re-
lative also happened on this same type
of doll in a shop soon afterwards, and
a second Tussup arrived to swell Joan's
family. I think it was this reduplica-
tion which first aroused her interest in
the Tussup species, for she and the
two of them became inseparable.
This last week it has been nothing
but Tussups at every turn—on my
pillow in the morning, on my lap at
breakfast, in my chair in the evening;
and I have got surfeited with Tussups.
It was the occasion of Joan's birthday
that gave rise in me to hopes of divert-
ing her tastes elsewhere.
Yesterday a most engaging present
came for her from her grandpapa–a
doll baby in a large cot, all complete.
Joan was thrilled to the marrow, and
the Tussups were cast to the winds.
Whereupon I impounded the unholy
pair and buried them away privily.
The cot was a great attraction, and
Joan would not be parted from it all
day. This morning, too, though she
moment, the sight of the cot made her
perfectly happy. In fact it only seemed
to require one other really new and
exciting toy, to take turn-about with
the baby and the cot, to make her com-
pletely forget her old loves. I was
wondering what I could do about it in
town to-day, when the post arrived
and with it a letter for Joan's Mummy,
which seemed quite providential.
“My dear Winnie,” it ran, “I be-
lieve to-morrow is my goddaughter's
birthday, so I have bestirred myself
and sent her an offering. I fancy it is
rather a good line. It is very original
—a character from Alice in Wonder-
land. . . .”
This, I thought, will be the very
thing; probably the Mock Turtle or the
Duchess, and Joan will dote on it. An
hour later the parcel came and was
handed to Joan with becoming cere-
mony. Palpitating and jigging with
excitement, she bore it off to a chair
and rent it open. I watched her sym-
pathetically. “Well,” I asked, “what
about it?” The inner wrapper yielded
with a splutter of tissue-paper, and I
saw Joan's countenance irradiated with
a sudden ecstasy.
“Tussup!” she screamed. I leapt
up in horror even as she brandished it
in the air. It was an unmistakable
Tussup, with his exemption badge and
his hateful little cane, just like the
other two. Character from Alice in
JWonderland, indeed!
Joan rushed and planted it on my
knee. “Daddy hab it !” she offered
with her usual generosity. -
::: 3: ::: :: ::
After that it was no good. The cot
has taken a back seat and the two old
Tussups have resumed their front ones.
Joan is devoted to the three of them,
and I daresay by the end of the War
there will be thirty of them.
There is only one consolation left to
me. Some day, I suppose—if we can
believe what we are told—Joan will
say to me, “And what did you do in
the Great War, Father?” Then my
hour of triumph will have come. I
shall draw myself up to my full height
and say, “My child, modesty has
always been my foremost virtue; but I
cannot tell a lie. In the Great War I
was a Tussup.”
And if Joan is consistent she will
think far more of me than if I had laid
claim to a hundred doughty deeds.

Richard. You have said nothing of
the philosophers of this time. Were
there no philosophers?
Mrs. M. On the contrary there were
a considerable number. Perhaps the
most notable was Mr. BALFour, who
in spite of his attainments as a thinker
rose to the highest offices of state.
Richard. Ah, Mamma, I have heard
of Mr. BALFour, and I should like, when
I am a man, to be just such another.
Mrs. M. My highest ambition for
you, my dear boy, could not go further,
for he was a very interesting and re-
markable man, though not without
some peculiarities. For example, it was
said of him, some people say by him,
that he never read the newspapers.
And some people went so far as to say
that this more than anything else was
a proof of his greatness. The news-
papers were always saying that he
must go, and he did not want to stay,
but the country did not seem able to
do without him. His extreme modesty
and gentleness of temper were perhaps
more extraordinary than even his talents

Mrs. M. Certainly. There was Mr.

Mrs. M. No, my dear, there you are

and many serious people took him at
his own valuation. Thus for many
years he represented a Scotch consti-
tuency—Dundee. Some people, how-
ever, explained this on the ground that
Dundee was famous for the manufacture
of marmalade, and he knew all about
Blenheim oranges. But that was in
the days before marmalade was made
from turnips and glycerine.

George. What is a kilt?
Mrs. M. A kilt is a sort of petticoat
formerly worn by the Highlanders, a
primitive race of Scotsmen. There are
various accounts of its origin, but the
most authentic attributes it to the phy-
sical conformation of the ancient Picts,
the ancestors of the Highlanders. It
is said that their feet were so large
that when trousers came into fashion
they tried to put them on over their
heads, and, becoming entangled in the
process, were obliged in self-defence to
resort to the kilt.
Mary. But what did they wear before
trousers came into fashion ?
Mrs. M. There, my dear child, you
are allowing your thirst for information
to outrun your discretion. The pre-

Official (to applicant for post). “I’M SORRY, Miss SMITH, BUT As You R FATHER WAS NOT IN ANY Govers MENT DEPARTMENT I'M
AFRAID YOU WILL NEED SOME INTELLECTUAL QUALIFICATION.”
FOR LOVE OF FRANCE.
I was shown the other day a new
kind of map of France—the pleasant
land of France that is being so cruelly
maimed and scourged. Instead of the
names of towns it had merely the few
great cities, the Departments, and nine
hundred tiny red dots. I did not count
them—life is short—but I was assured
that that was the number, and that
each represents a place where there is
a hospital, or hospitals, whose stores of
the necessaries of healing and of comfort
have been enriched by the French War
Emergency Fund, an English associa-
tion whose sole purpose is the ameliora-
tion of the lot of our nearest Ally. I
had heard already much of this Fund
and of the thoroughness and thought-
fulness with which it has been ad-
ministered, but the extent of its activity
had never been made so vividly realis-
able.
These dots, then, indicate hospital
sites where French soldiers, broken in
the task of defending their beautiful
suffering country, lic or creep about.
The Fund has also its civilian minis-
trations, which every day grow in range
and usefulness: to rebuild or make
has destroyed, to re-establish the cot-
tagers and provide them with cooking
utensils, clothing, food, blankets and
seeds. That this is work of the greatest
importance we in England, even with
no experience of invasion, must agree.
Although we have some first-hand
knowledge of the horrors of war, it is
mercifully incomplete; the Germans
are not within sixty miles of London,
as they are of Paris; none of our square
miles has been laid waste. No one
who has not witnessed it has more than
a vague idea of the utter desolation
that can follow in the enemy's wake:
far greater than France, with all her
genius for rapid smiling reorganisation,
has at this tragic and fateful moment
time to handle.
Such until a little while ago were
the two main lines of neighbourly help-
fulness along which the Fund worked,
and this map is evidence enough that
thoroughness has not been wanting.
But now, at the request of the French
Government, which has again and again
expressed its appreciation of the Fund's
assistance and gratitude for it, the
provision of canteens at the railway
stations where wounded detrain, and
of canteens and recreation rooms wher-
is to be added to its responsibilities.
The hospitals of France unhappily do
not decrease either in number or in
the need of accommodation—since for
every wounded man who comes in a
healed man does not, alas, go out; but
as the patients improve in health there
is the more need for the means of be-
guiling their time. Canteens in the
grounds for the supply of refreshments,
and rooms where papers and books may
be read, games played and gramophones
listened to, are therefore desirable. A
few of these have already been erected
or adapted by the Fund; as many more
as possible are to follow, all of which
will have to be furnished and fitted, at,
of course (and the cloven hoof of the
mendicant now obtrudes"), a certain
expense.
Every contribution that reaches the
Fund is of value, especially just now,
when there are so many travelling
wounded to be succoured, and the
appeal cannot be too wide; and yet
as I looked at this very interesting
map and was told the names of some
of the nine hundred places for which
the red dots stood, it was borne in upon
me that if only those English people
who have made holiday in France and

a magnificent revenue would result.
Love of France would unfold so many
cheque-books, open so many purses;
the effect of the happy memories which
this list of nine hundred towns re-
kindled would be irresistible. Paris
alone should suffice; but with Nor-
mandy and Brittany, Provence and
Touraine, the Seine and the Loire, the
Riviera and the Cevennes to lend their
influence to the impulse of generosity
(or gratitude), such a torrent of votive
offerings would flow as would render
all further begging needless.
For pure “love of lovely words” and
at the risk of being made too “home-
sick,” I am tempted to quote from the
list down to date—March 21st, 1918–
just before the great battle broke out
which, by so desperately increasing
the work of French hospital staffs and
adding to the privations of the civilians,
must spur the Fund to new efforts. If
I mention but the first town under
each letter you will realise both what
I mean and how widely flung are the
Fund's ministrations: Abbaretz (Loire
Inférieure), Bacqueville (Seine Inféri-
eure), Cabourg (Calvados), Danne-
marie (Alsace Française), Eaubonne
(Seine et Oise), Falaise (Calvados),
Gaillon (Eure), Hadol (Vosges), L'Ile-
de-Noé (Gers), Jansé (Ille et Vilaine),
Lagny (Seine et Marne), Macon (Saône

selle), Ognan-par-Barbéry (Oise), Paim-
boeuf (Loire Inférieure), Querqueville

Sable (Sarthe), Tain (Drôme), Uriage
(Isère), Vadelaincourt (Meuse), Wesser-
ling (Alsace Française), Yssingeaux
(Hte. Loire), Zuydecoote (Nord).
Should the authorities of the French
War Emergency Fund find it neces-
sary to issue a four-lined financial
whip, as I fear is inevitable, I commend
to their notice the wisdom of adding
this list to it. Poetry is not too com-
mon; the reanimation of old joys is
not too easy in these bitter times. Per-
sonally I should be unable to withstand
such an appeal, and, apart from love of
France in general, I should associate
my own contribution with the green-
and-white village of Barbizon, in the
forest of Fontainebleau, and the little
walled town of Moret, where the nuns
made barley-sugar before ambition and
rapacity blasted the world.

“THE PRIME MINISTER."
I HAVE moved so little in the society
of enemy aliens that I cannot say with
confidence how a German family re-
siding in Soho would conduct itself in
the domestic circle at the outbreak of
another war between England and the
Fatherland. But if their behaviour
corresponded at all to the picture of the
Schiller family, as seriously presented
by Mr. HALL CAINE (relying, I must
assume, on his gifts of imagination),
then I feel that even the horrors of a
second Armageddon would have their
humorous compensations.
My experience again fails me
when I try to visualise a group of
Cabinet Ministers awaiting the
expiration of an ultimatum; but
unless their natures undergo a
total change in these exception-
ally trying circumstances I can-
not believe that they would sit
there like so many dummies, ex-
changing rhetorical platitudes on
the ravages of war; or that one
of them, in the temporary absence
of the Prime Minister from the º/,
room, would seize the occasion to -
throw off a brief summary of that
gentleman's career for the benefit
of colleagues certain to be equally
well instructed in the facts.
Once again, my limited know-
ledge of the vie intime of Downing
Street does not permit me to say
whether a Prime Minister would
be likely to welcome an enemy
alien as governess to his little
daughter with full knowledge
(imparted by the police) of the *
history of her family of suspects,
and after a frank admission on
her part that she had introduced
herself into his house from motives
of espionage. And even if the
discovery that he had commuted
the death sentence of her late father, a
convicted spy, should change her atti-
tude and create a bond between them,
and in a burst of perverted Quixotism
he should overlook her original designs,
I should never expect him (unless, of
course, he happened to be Mr. HALL
CAINE himself) to seal the bond in the
following terms: “Remember that not
with bread but with blood” I have
bought your soul.” Mr. CAINE may
say things like that, but Prime Ministers
don't.
After this encouragement you will
naturally anticipate some melodrama,
including an attempt, foiled by the
sacrificial devotion of the heroine, to
assassinate the protagonist of the title-
rôle; and you will have all that. You

The Prime Minister (Mr. C. Mſ. HALLAnn). “THE ANswer:

It was difficult to take sympathetic-
ally the venomous spite that hissed
from the lips of his enemy aliens; and
the only way for us seemed to be to
treat it as Thomas in the trenches
treats the Bosches' Hymn of Hate.
And I am almost sure that this was
not the way in which we were meant
to take it.
Finally, it was depressing enough to
have Mr. HALL CAINE's authority for
the view that the present war is to be
followed by another on the same lines;
but even more disheartening to find him
labouring under the ingenuous belief
that this new war gave him an oppor-
tunity of saying quite freshly all the
things that we have been saying, for
the best part of four years, about the
the command of the Captain-
hero; the wireless was the job
of the villain Major, who sold his
country to pay his gambling
debts. The whole fate of France
apparently hangs by the leg of
one of the Captain's pigeons;
and the General of Division, a
nice old thing, and the Colonel,
a silly old ass, have nothing ap-
parently to do but come and
discuss the odds on the pigeon
in alternating spasms of maudlin
credulity, hopeless despondency
and appalling indiscretion.

the rest of the wireless station
was hospital. Naturally he was
present at the most intimate
discussions of the over-anxious
officers, as was his chief, the charm-
ing Lady Doctor, whose medi-
cal knowledge I suspected from
the first. I found later that she
got it by instalments, as occasion
arose, over the telephone from
a medical friend. Once indeed,
when a traitor (I am anticipating)
, committed suicide by throwing
himself off the wireless tower, she
did, without telephoning, solemnly pro-
nounce life to be extinct, having ex-
amined the body from the top of the
tower. Perhaps, though, she wirelessed.
For the rest she was chiefly engaged
(assisted by the spy orderly) in listen-
ing to every consultation, reading every
despatch and telegram, and offering un-
sought advice.
In general she was extremely re-
sourceful, except in any real emergency,
such as the struggle between her lover
and his enemies, when she could only
tango ineffectually about the room and
faintly bleat. Mr. PAGE is evidently a
ferocious anti-feminist.

THE CATCH.
PAssiNG through a bit of desolate
and shell-stricken bog I came across
him. He had the air of just the typical
Tommy, as he sat there on an empty
biscuit-tin and on the sharpest part of
it. Had one remonstrated with him
on the matter he would have remarked,
with the cynical indifference of his kind,
“Well, it doesn't matter, Sir; they're
only Army breeches.”
Perched precariously on the edge of
an evil-smelling and sinister shell-hole,
he was engaged in fishing the foul
depths below. A slender branch did
duty as a rod, and the line consisted of
a series of knotted strings, to which
was attached a small stone, pre-
sumably as a float. Patiently he sat
gazing into nothingness, his plumb-
line hanging idly in mid-air.
I smiled and made to pass on, and
then with startling suddenness the
awful truth flashed upon me. A shell-
shock case. -

There ! I am not so grey after all. Indeed my mous-

it might be just a leetle fiercer. I must practise it half-an-

The Courtier. I beg your Majesty ten thousand pardons.
I had no idea your Majesty was in this room, otherwise
your Majesty may be sure I should not have dared to in-
trude. -
The K. I forgive you for your intrusion, but must ask
you to remember next time that any door which is closed is
a door behind which I might possibly be found, and must
not therefore be rashly opened or approached. Now go.
The C. I hasten to withdraw myself from your Majesty's

The K. Stay, stay a moment.

The K. Have you been in the streets this morning 2
The C. Yes, your Majesty, I spent an hour in walking
about l’erlin.
The K. Tell me, what do the people say? How do they
take the latest news 2 -
The C. They are elated with joy because of your Majesty's
most recent victories.
The K. Did you hear them say anything?
The C. I did. I heard one officer say to another, “We
shall get on with old HINDENBURG in charge.”
The K. (obviously annoyed). Oh, they put it all down to
HINDENBURG, do they 2 They forget that it is I who am the
War Lord and who am in command of everything. Do
you hear me, of everything 2 It is time that people knew
that no victory can get itself won without my having
organised it. Even when there are two victories in a day,
one in Russia and one on the Western Front, though I
cannot be present at more than one, I am responsible for
both. People are far too much inclined to drag in the
name of HINDENBURG and to forget that of their All-Highest
Emperor and King. I must warn IIINDENBURG, who is
quite an honest fellow, but rather thick in the skull, not to
let himself be deceived by flatterers.
The C. The warning, your Majesty, will not come a whit
too soon. There are certain things that a man should not
allow himself even to think. It was only the other day
that I checked the Field-Marshal as he was saying—but
for the Field-Marshal's sake I will not relate what
saying.
The K. (assuming his most terrific aspect). Not relate!
That you shall, and in full. Out with it !
The C. Pardon me, your Majesty. A private conversation.
The K. I do not care how private it may have been.
What was it? Quick
The C. The Field-Marshal, your Majesty, happened to
say that if he was constantly interfered with, as he now
was, he could guarantee defeat in a very short time.
The K. Did he say who interfered with him 2
The C. No, your Majesty—that is, yes, your Majesty.
There was no doubt left on anyone's mind that he meant to
reſer to your Majesty.
The K. Monstrous !
The C. That is exactly what I permitted myself to say,
and I added that he seemed to forget that you were the
Lord's Anointed, and that everybody was aware how
splendidly and nobly you had performed your task in a war
he was i.
The K. Did he make any reply?
The C. He did. He said that, as to beginning the War,
it was plain from Prince LICHNowsky's memorandum that
it was you and your Ministers who had begun the War, but

THE WINDMILL.
A SoNG OF VICTORY.
YEs, it was all like a garden glowing
When first we came to the hill-top there,
And we laughed to know that the Bosch was going,
And laughed to know that the land was fair;
Acre by acre of green fields sleeping,
Hamlets hid in the tufts of wood,
And out of the trees were church-towers peeping,
And away on a hillock the Windmill stood.
Then, ah them, 'twas a land worth winning,
And now there is nought but the naked clay,
But I can remember the Windmill spinning,
And the four sails shone in the sun that day,
But the guns came after and tore the hedges
And stripped the spinneys and churned the plain,
And a man walks now on the windy ledges
And looks for a feather of green in vain;
Acle by acre the sad eye traces
The rust-red bones of the earth laid bare,
And the sign-posts stand in the market-places
To say that a village was builded there.
But better the French fields stark and dying
Than ripe for a conqueror's fat content,
And I can remember the mill-sails flying, -
'et I cheered with the rest when the Windmill
went.
Away to the East the grass-land surges
Acre by acre across the line,
And we must go on till the end like scourges,
Though the wilderness stretch from sea to Rhine;
But I dream some days of a great reveille,
When the buds shall burst in the Blasted Wood,
And the children chatter in Death-Trap Alley,
And a windmill stand where the Windmill stood.
And we that remember the Windmill spinning,
We may go under, but not in vain,
For our sons shall come in the new beginning
And see that the Windmill spins again.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
| HAVE you ever, when confronting some well-known scene,
tried the simple experiment of bending sideways so as to
observe it horizontally? The probable results will be two-
fold—(1) the view will take on a new and astonishing bril-
liance of colouring; and (2) the spectators, if any, will regard
you as the unhappy victim of dementia. It is the first of
these effects of which I am always reminded by the more
successful of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT's descriptive passages.
| Take, for example, his latest story, The Pretty Lady
(CASSELL). Here you will find a number of pictures of war-
time London, relief-committees, air-raids, charity pageants
and the like, all of them but too sadly familiar, presented
with exactly this vivid effect of a fresh angle of vision. So
much for the background, which contains as good report-
| ing—the air-raid chapters especially—as anything in this
kind that even Mr. BENNETT has yet done. The story I
Venture to think less satisfactory. The two chief characters
are finely presented—up to a point. The Pretty Lady her-
self (for the warning of households where the censorship
| still survives I may mention that the term is technical and
| generic) is an understandable personality; her relations,
both to the middle-aged bachelor who is her fellow-pro-
|tagonist and to the other aspects of her withdrawn and
Specialised existence, are shown with obvious sincerity,
also at times with a somewhat startling indecorum. Mr.
|BENNETT, having selected a pretty lady as his central
figure, was clearly not going to be hampered with reticence
and evasions. This I should mind less but for the fact that
the end of the book is itself so flagrant an evasion. Having
developed the interest to a point at which at least two
scènes à faire are, or should be, inevitable, Mr. BENNETT,
as though his concern in it had suddenly ceased, brings the
whole business to an abrupt and most inconclusive finish.
My irritation at this was perhaps a tribute to what seemed
an artistic success wilfully spoilt.
“He had made his choice between Ireland and Salissa.
It certainly seemed as if he had chosen wrongly.” This is
a remark by “GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM " about a character
in his latest story, The Island Mystery (METHUEN). By
a coincidence it also embodies very much the criticism
that I have to make upon the author. Remembering so
many Irish comedies of pure delight from his graceful pen,
I was the more disappointed with what candour compels
me to call an entirely undistinguished and conventional piece
of cheap tushery. The imaginary kingdom, the impecunious
monarch, the multi-millionaire Poppa from America, the
lovely daughter—what, I felt inclined to exclaim, is the
creator of Spanish Gold doing with these faded puppets?
Above all, the mysteryl Will you credit me when I tell
you that this turned out to be nothing more than a cave
full of petrol tanks for replenishing U-boats? Really
something will have to be done about the abuse of petrol
in war-fiction. Nowadays especially it is intolerable that
our novelists (even those who should know better) continue
apparently to regard it as the inexhaustible fountain of
thrills. Perhaps the PETROL-ControLLER could issue an
edict on the matter. But to return to the tale. Personally I
owed my only smiles to the character of King Karl and some
ingenious if mechanical fun in his attempts at English
slang. But as for the rest, the purchase of the island and

what happened there—well, look at my list of the chief
characters above and you will be quite able to forecast'
every step of the plot. And as this is precisely what no one
has ever been able to say of a best quality “BIRMINGHAM "
it confirms me in thinking the present story altogether
unworthy of its distinguished parentage.
M. CHARLEs Rivet, journalist of Paris, in an arresting
study, entitled The Last of the Romanofs (CoNSTABLE), sets
forth many things that needed to be said and must by no
means go unobserved either in his own country or here.
The pathetic confidence of the free and peaceful French
people in a colossal autocracy that never was a colossus
and cared for nothing but to be autocratic is now a thing
of the past, but it could never for one moment have existed
where there was the smallest real understanding of a Court
that was based on absolutism, served in corruption, inspired
by infatuation and governed by hysteria. M. Rivet tells,
with an hostility that one may, of course, decline to share,
but with a reality of knowledge that one can hardly doubt,
no pity. It is difficult to pity Grégoire, and yet he is so
pitiable. Do not forget; Auger is touched with grace; but
Grégoire will be damned if you do not hold out your hand
to him.” Auger and Grégoire are types. How many visitors
to hospitals hasten to the one “who gives you confidence,
restores your peace of mind,” rather than to the other, who
seems “to be bearing the misery of an entire world.”
The tendency of young lady novelists to find their
dramatis personae among literary men has often been noted.
Miss G. B. STERN, the writer of A Marrying Man (NISBET),
has shown this tendency before and now does so again;
and if she persists, and becomes any more searching and
caustic than she now is, the Authors' Society will have to
take protective action. Gareth Temple, the central figure
(I could not say hero) of the book, is not only a novelist
but a publishers' reader, and a very dishonest one to boot;
and his peculiarity is that, like the man in the Hindu fable,
he can neither do with women nor without them. I should
not recommend the history of his failures as exactly amus-
ing reading, but it is done remorselessly, with power and
of that circle of intrigue and abomination, inspired by the
unspeakable º
- - -nºº"
monarch whose very vir. º-º º º
tues became, in an auto- *- º
crat, disasters, and whose 7-- -
absolutism was a tyranny
hardly less intolerable for Fº
himself than for his sub- º'
jects. From the larger
liberty of exile in Siberia
the last of the Romanofs
must look back on Russia,
ripe for a Napoleon, with
feelings, one would think,
of relief rather than of
regret. For the Russians
who, making incredible
efforts in their struggle
against the Hun, were
compelled to reckon their
own governors amongst
their country's enemies,
the author has only love
and respect; and, though
sharing one's own disgust - -
for the miserable exaggerations, or worse, of the Leninist
section, he is clear that the Revolution, whatever its inter-
mediate stages, will prove in the end to have been the
greatest blow that could have been struck at Kaiserism.

congratulate Miss FLORENCE SIMMONDs upon her work, and
advise anyone unacquainted with the original to read her

Army; he is also (though he would not thank me for calling
attention to the fact) a brave man endowed with the finest
sympathies. He loves and glories in the splendid men
entrusted to his care; and if more than once I could not
suppress a feeling that I was learning secrets in their
struggles for life which I had no right to know, I hasten to
add that M. DUHAMEL writes so lovingly and simply that
these stories are redeemed from the slightest suspicion of
bad taste. Read “Histoire de Carré et de Lerondeau” and
“Le Sacrifice,” and you will understand. M. DUHAMEL also
offers one piece of counsel which deserves a wide advertise-

- MY PAPERS.
I AM now in a position to establish my identity, and
when the War is over I am going back to Paris to be rude
to a postal official. I have the greatest admiration for our
Allies and a profound respect for the Entente Cordiale, but
I have a grudge against that postal official, and I cherish
the hope that he will live through the War, in order that
I may cover him with confusion.
He had the manners of a Prussian, and when I presented
my money-order to him in those memorable days at the
end of July, 1914, he regarded both it and me with suspicion,
and informed me that the advice had not arrived. Next
morning I again presented myself and the money-order,
and he condescended to find the advice note. Then he
demanded my papers.
I explained to him that Englishmen do not carry papers,
gave him my card and showed him letters; also I explained
that I must return to England immediately. He shrugged
his shoulders with profound disdain. If I had no papers I
might be a murderer or a spy, and I must be identified by
two persons of repute before he would pay anything. Filled
with anxiety, for I needed the money, I returned to my
apartment in the Quartier Latin and appealed to the
concierge to come and identify me and to find me another
person of repute.
The concierge was an obliging old fellow and he enlisted
the services of a garçon from the Café Coq d'Or on my
behalf, and, after consuming apéritifs, for which I paid, we
presently entered the post-office in a miniature procession.
The concierge identified me, produced his military service
ticket, his marriage certificate and other papers in order to
identify himself, and I prepared to collect my money. Alas!
the garçon from the Coq d'Or proved a broken reed. His
papers were not in order—it appeared he could not even
prove that he had ever been born, so the official behind
the grille became rude. He commanded us to leave the
office, made scathing remarks about foreigners without
papers, and hinted that I was probably an Allemand. .
The garçon and the concierge fled, and I demanded to see
the Postmaster, was denied, but insisted, and the official
became more and more rude and sardonic. Finally I was
admitted, under protest, to the bureau of the sub-post-
master. I produced my money-order and demanded cash.
The official was called in and explained matters to his own
satisfaction. I had no papers, I could not identify myself,
and I had brought to identify me a man whose papers
were not in order and who could not identify himself. For
I dislike being compared with the GERMAN EMPEROR
even in peace times, and said so loudly. I banged the table
of the sub postmaster, talked about the rights of English-
men, about the Union Jack, about our Army and Navy and
about the British Constitution, while, the postal official
shrugged his shoulders, looked more sardonic than ever,
and murmured that England would not ight and that men
without papers always had loud voices. The sub-post-
master remained comparatively calm, but decided eventually
that I was probably an impostor who had robbed myself—
yes, that must have been what he meant, for he suggested
that I might have stolen the money-order from the person
named in the advice—and dismissed me abruptly.
Raging, I went to the British Embassy and demanded
papers; also I demanded the blood of the postal official.
A beautifully-groomed young gentleman listened patiently
and smiled a tired smile. Then he proceeded gently to ex-
plain that he could not give me papers and could not
identify me, as he had not the honour of my acquaintance.
He mentioned incidentally that only in the event of war
would the Embassy have to issue papers to British subjects,
and advised me to go and see a banker.
I begged him not to have a war on my account, assured
him I should be quite satisfied if he sent me the head of
the postal official, and went to see a banker. He, good
man, gave me money in exchange for a cheque, and I
hurried back to England without cashing my money-order.
Then came war, and—well, things happened.
But, as I have said, I am going back to Paris as soon as
the War ends—and I am going to cash that money-order.
I dream of the day when I shall walk into that post-office,.
and the official, after examining the money-order with sus-
picion, will demand my papers. Then will come my great
moment.
I shall produce my National Registration Card, my
Birth Certificate, my Army Discharge Certificate, my Pen-
sion Paper, my wife's Marriage Lines, my Sugar Ticket,
my Meat and Margarine Cards, my Dog Licence, my Special
Constable's Warrant, my War. Savings Certificates Book,
and my Passport with photograph attached. I shall re-
mind the official that he once suggested I was an Allemand,
and I shall be exceedingly rude to him. Ah! a delightful
prospect. And I shall feel that the War has not been in
vain, since it has provided me with identification papers
and the opportunity of squaring accounts with a Paris
postal official.

THE Government's decision to allow only a small sum to
be spent on any building operations during the War has
made no difference to the activities of the black-coated fra-
ternity whose new settlement is so close to me. House
after house has been going up during the past fortnight, both
with steadier progress than is customary and a greater
amount of conversation among the workmen. In fact, dur-
ing business hours they have never stopped talking at all,
and I would give probably more for a dictionary of their
tongue than would Mr. Asquith for a glossary by Mr.
Thomas of the terms used in Labour slang. Were a fairy to
offer me a wishing cap for the compassing of minor impos-
sibilities, I am not sure that the power to understand the
language of birds—and rooks in particular—would not be
my first request.
For the first time in the memory of local man the rooks
are building in the cherries, a series of five or six venerable
and lofty trees, close to the house, amid whose million blos-
soms they take on an even darker tinge of blackness, night
upon night; and I have found them and their mysterious
ways more than ever one of the most engaging spectacles
of the Spring. But, watch them howsoever closely, I could
not discover which were the builders and which the archi-
tects. All seemed equally to be workers. All seemed equally
to be talkers. When, the other day, a quarrel began and
one of the birds was for a while driven away I thought I
had placed him; but on his return with a twig I knew my-
This morning, however, looking again, more narrowly,
through some field-glasses and seeing how rapidly and
efficiently the buildings were proceeding, I have come to the
conclusion that there can be no architect at all.
THE DAPHNE BUSH.
ALL about the daphne bush the happy fairies went,
And spread abroad their silken hair to catch its magic scent;
They chanted little silver tunes, they danced the whole day
long,
The rosy bush was ringed around with chains of coloured
Song.
They danced, they sang, they flung about their tiny fairy
names, -
Till swiftly over all the sky there ran the sunset flames;
Then high into the glowing air they leapt with joyful shout,
And with the ruddy shreds of mist they wrapped themselves
about.
Into my quiet garden close they swiftly dropped again
(The music of their merriment tinkled like falling rain);
Laughing they swayed, while from their hair they shook
the warm perfume,
Till all the place seemed filled with clouds of drifting daphne
bloom. - R. F.

FIL VOLANT.
Bill Harkom has always been touchy
regarding his physique. He is of the
flag-pole build; has length and position
(for he is Mess Secretary), but abso-
lutely no breadth. We never see him
in his entirety save out-of-doors. In a
nissen-hut or a pillbox he has to fold
up like a carpenter's pocket measure—
a most inconvenient man with whom
to share one of those battle Messes
which consist of a sheet of corrugated
iron and two sandbags. We have to
indent for extra R.E. material simply
to provide him with cover. During
the winter we used to remind him
about his legs, and ask if he wouldn't
have them folded up and brought in
out of the sleet.
From time to time we anxiously
inquire if he is still in touch with his
extremities, in view of the length of his
lines of communication. No ordinary
bed will contain him. Poor fellow, those
soft, luxurious, canopied and feathered
couches which occupy the greater part
of the interior space in even the hum-
blest French cottage are no use to him.
He once tried to fit himself into one of
them and go to sleep folded up, but
this brought on such awful cramp that
he had to shriek for his man to jerk
his joints straight again.
The Major himself is often tempted
to exercise upon him a pretty gift of
badinage. I have heard him on a damp
morning request his long-drawn sub-
altern to stand up and report if visi-
bility was any better above the ground
mist.
From his extreme youth up he has
been persecuted about his length and
his laziness. But doubtless the one is
the result of the other. As his school-
masters explained to him, the seat of
his mental processes is so remote from
his outlying members that he could
never hope to impart to them anything
like punctual activity.
He has been seen trying to run—an
extraordinary spectacle. Despite a wide
and reckless abandon in the movement
of his individual and apparently inde-
pendent limbs, the man, Bill Harkom,
as a whole makes little progress.
Not long ago we went out to rest,
and Harkom's man sent his master's
underclothing to a little local laundry.
The day when the clean things were
returned, with the usual account,
Harkom came to me with his distant
face scarlet, like an angry planet.
“Look at this,” he shouted. “Nick-
names from a French washerwoman.
I'll sign a separate peace.” -
I glanced at the document thrust
under my nose. It showed that Lieu-

six francs for the washing of well,
for washing. And at the foot of the
paper were the words, “Fil volant.”
No wonder he was annoyed. It de-
scribed him exactly. But lest he
should lose his zeal for the Entente I
begged him to let me see the new-
washed raiment. There, on every item,
I pointed out to him a little piece of
cotton secured by a knot, the end flying
free—a "fil volant.” It cost me some
pains to persuade him that this was
simply the identification mark attached
by the careful blanchisseuse, and not a
personality.

cigar. He beamed amiably upon me.

SoME SUGGESTIONs.
It is reported that the Government's
standard suits for men's wear will soon
be available. In the hope that it may
not be too late for cutters and tailors
to embody them in the finished article
the following suggestions are offered:—
Cut.—All standard suits should be cut
under the customer's present measure-
ments, and those that are supplied
ready-made should be cut under the
normal stock sizes. In any case some
device should be provided for taking in
a reef.
The waist-line should be well defined
in order to absolve stout customers
|from any suspicion of food-hogging :
but, on the other hand, it should not
be too accentuated in the case of men
under the age of fifty-one.
The trouser legs should have a per-
manent turn-up to act as a crumb-
collector in restaurants.
In view of the laundry difficulty the
waistcoat opening should be cut high.
Pockets.—The standard suit should
have no fewer than nineteen pockets.
In addition to the present ten pockets
used for general utility, special pockets
should be provided for meat cards, bacon
cards, sugar rations, national regis-
tration cards, travel permits, call-up
notices, gas and electric light meter
diaries, electric torches, the new skele-
ton Bradshaw and other vade mecums.
Accessories.—A duplicate attachable
lapel for flag-days.
A match-striker, coated with tri-nitro-
toluol, should be attached to the firmest
fitting part of the standard suit for use
in dealing with the present breed of
matches.
A steel-hook with telescopic action
should be fitted in one of the sleeves,
thus leaving both arms of the wearer
free in public conveyances.
In view of the paper-bag shortage
householders would welcome the in-
sertion under the jacket of a washable
hold-all.
Finally it is desirable to provide an
inclusive sandbag attachment, camou-
flaged with protective stripes and spots,
for evening wear.
Attention to these little refinements
would help vastly to popularise the
standard suits. -

ES S E N C E OF PA R L | A M E N T.
FORWARD THE BHOYS OF THE OULD BRIGADE |
DoN QUIxotº, O'BRIEN AND SANcho PANzA DEvlin on THE wan-PATH.
Tuesday, April 9th.-Parliament re-
sumed business after the Easter Recess.
Some people apparently think it should
have been summoned earlier, in view
of the situation on the Western Front.
After to-day's proceedings others may
possibly regret that it was necessary to
summon it at all. The House of Com-
mons began by giving a Second Read-
ing to a Drainage Bill and ended by
finding itself in an Irish bog.
The PRIME MINISTER’s account of
the recent offensive on the Somme was
given, perhaps deliberately, in very
gloomy tones, and listened to in almost
stony silence. The success of the Ger-
man attack was attributed, first, to the
enemy possessing the initiative, and,
secondly, to the weather. Even the
Wizard from Wales cannot control the
weather; but Members found it a little
difficult to understand why, if even at
the beginning of March the Allies were
equal in numbers to the enemy on the
West, and if, thanks to the foresight of
the Versailles Council, they knew in
advance the strength and direction of
the impending blow, they ever allowed
the initiative to pass to the Germans.
Surely they cannot have forgotten that
homely adage— -
“Twice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
But three times he who gets his blow in fust."
GEORGE's qualifications as a military
strategist his eminence as a Parlia-
mentary tactician has never been dis-
puted. I assume, therefore, that his
method of handling Irish conscription
was more astute than it appeared at
first sight. The powder of compul-
sory service is to be followed by, and
not wrapped up in, the jam of Home
Rule. Sir Edward CARson described
this proposal as “camouflage,” though
that much-tried substantive seemed
singularly inappropriate; and his Na-
tionalist fellow-countrymen, with a
unanimity which would have pleased
Mr. GINNELL (now languishing in gaol
again), refused to look at the jam and
declined to smell the powder. The War
might be a just war, and Ireland's free
dom be at stake as much as Belgium's,
but never would they allow the young
men of Ireland to fight at the orders
of any but an Irish Parliament. Mr.
WILLIAM O'BRIEN described the Bill
as “a declaration of war upon Ireland,”
and Mr. DEVLIN, not to be outdone,
said his beloved country would never
allow such a stamina to be inflicted
upon her brow.
Nevertheless leave to bring in the
Bill was accorded on a division by
299 to 80.
At Question-time the CHANGELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER informed Mr. Row-
theatres and music-halls would not
affect the House of Commons. Con-
trary to the popular impression it is not
regarded as a place of entertainment
within the meaning of the regulation.
Commander BELLAIRs has shaved off
his moustache. Now that the Ad-
miralty, thanks to his pertinacity, has
decided to promote officers by merit
instead of seniority, he desires to be
ready for any emergency.
Wednesday, April 10th.-Mr. ByRNE
furnished a good illustration of the
charming inconsistency of his delight-
ful country. At Question-time he was
urging upon the War Office the neces-
sity of according to its Irish employés
exactly the same privileges and pay as
were given to their British confrères.
A few minutes later, when Sir GEORGE
CAVE was commending the Bill, which
inter alia extends to Irishmen the privi-
lege of joining in the fight for freedom,
Mr. ByRNE protested so loudly and fre-
quently that the SPEARER had to warn
him that he was destroying his chances
of catching his eye.
I suppose the HoME SECRETARY
was entrusted with the conduct of the
Bill because of his experience in hand-
ling Conscientious Objectors. He de-
clined to take the Nationalist threats
over-seriously. No doubt conscription

epitomized as “the higher you go the
fewer.” -
Some chilly criticisms from Mr. As-
QUITH included one gleam of humour.
He questioned the policy of embracing
Ireland in the Bill unless you could
get" general consent.” Half-a-dozen
speeches from the Nationalist benches
of varying merit but unvarying hostility
supplied the answer. Mr. DILLON,
however, carried the House with him
when he declared that if conscription
was right now it ought to have been
applied to Ireland long ago. Unionists
were particularly vociferous in their
cheers.
Shaken a little by the Ex-PREMIER's
hypothetical doubts the House was
restored to its balance by a vigorous
speech from Mr. BonAR LAw, who said
quite plainly that if Ireland was not to
be called upon to help in this time of
stress there would be an end of Home
Rule, and that if the House would not

received the doubtful help of the Paci-
fists and the Young Scots party, and
though Mr. Asquith and most of his
colleagues declined to vote at all, they
were beaten by three to one majorities
every time.
Thursday, April 11th.-Mr. FIELD is
another Member who declines to let his
hostility to the British Government
interfere with his endeavours to get
something out of it. His complaint that,
owing to the action of the Department
of Agriculture, there was a shortage of
Irish bulls (the four-legged variety) met
with discreet but sympathetic treat-
ment from the CHIEF SECRETARY, who,
after a glance at the Ladies' Gallery,
promised to include the answer on this
evidently delicate question in the
Official Report. -
There had been some anxiety among
the Pacifists and Young Scots as to
the answer that would be given to Mr.
John HoPE's request for an assurance
“that all Members of this House of
military age and medically fit will be
called upon to serve in the same manner
as the public"; and they were not a
little comforted when Mr. BECK said
that it had already been officially laid
down that attendance in Parliament
might be considered “work of national
importance.”

wisdom of raising the age to fifty. But
the Government stuck to their point,
though Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs declared
that for the present not more than seven
per cent. of the men affected would be
removed from civil life.
On the adjournment Mr. BonAR LAw
explained the position of General Foch.
He is not a Generalissimo, but is merely
exercising the powers of a General-in-
Chief. This appeared to satisfy every-
body but Mr. Hogg E, who does not
appreciate, I am afraid, these nice dis-
tinctions.

AT THE PLAY.
“BELINDA.”
It was nineteen years since John and
Belinda Tremayne had separated on the
ground of incompatibility of tastes in
the matter of hair. She had taken a
dislike to his beard; he to her coiffure.
Having heard nothing of him in the
interval she had got into the habit of
regarding herself as a widow. Frisky
with all those years out at grass, it was
an embarrassing moment for her when
her daughter, Delia, suddenly arrived
home from her school in Paris. For
Belinda was loved by a statistician
(Barter) and a stage-poet (Devenish),
who were unaware of the
daughter's existence, and the
statistician, being accustomed
to the study of figures, would
be almost certain to regard the
daughter as evidence of the
mother's maturity. So she ar-
ranged that Delia should be-
come her niece (tempy), under
the name of Robinson, the first
that occurred to her quick mind.
Urged by her two suitors in
her presence and in that of one
another (like the witnesses to
a last will and testament) to
decide between their respective
claims to her hand, she puts
them off by setting them a
quest. Her niece, she tells
them, has mislaid her father,
and she (Belinda) will under-
take to marry the man who first
retrieves him. He may be recog-
mised by a mole on his forearm.
The quest is admirably chosen,
since by its very attainment
the successful knight must
sacrifice all hope of reward.
Scarce have they mounted John Tremayne (alias “Robinson") . . .

their chargers to set forth on
the trail of the family Robin-
son, when a stranger appears in Be-
linda's garden. He is, of course, her
missing husband; but recognition is on
his side only, and when asked for his
name he says “Robinson,” the first that
occurs to his quick mind.
The Second Act shows us the knight-
hood on the quest, waylaying all who
bear the rather popular name of Robin-
son, and demanding, with many unfor-
tunate results, to see their forearms.
Our soi-disant Robinson reappears, and
the conversation chances to turn upon
lions. He confesses to having once
strangled the king of beasts, and, baring
his arm to show the marks of the
brute's annoyance, he reveals a mole.
It is the stage-poet who has attained;
but, having meanwhile transferred his
affections to Delia, he puts his rival
In the Third Act the statistician is in
turn displaced by the old husband, and
Belinda is re-united to her Enoch
Arden, whom she mixes up with Eugene
Aram, being uncertain about everything
except the initials “E. A." A rather
attractive little plot.
At its best the play was very good,
but there was a moment in the First
Act when it hung fire, and was only
saved by a clever recovery just as we
were looking for the curtain to come
down. The fun of the Third Act, too,
was rather attenuated, and will no doubt
be pulled together.
The charming thing about Mr.
MILNE's dialogue is that its humour

follows naturally upon what goes be-
fore, and never suggests lucubration.
“I thought you were coming next
Thursday, not this Thursday,” says
Belinda to her daughter; “so confusing
having them both called Thursday.”
The author was a critic and parodist
of plays before he ever made any him-
self; and one can trace in him a ten-
dency, as a playwright, to burlesque the
methods of his new medium. How far
does this tendency go? and at what
point does it merge into that other
tendency of all parodists to become
conventional when they themselves at-
tempt to exploit the art which they are
in the habit of burlesquing 2
I am thinking in particular of his
poet, looking and gesticulating and
talking as no poet ever did on land or
tion (except perhaps Mr. W. B. YEATs).
He may say that he is ridiculing con-
vention; but is not his ridicule itself
conventional? Anyhow, I found his
poet, in the person of Mr. DENNIs
NEILson-TERRY, rather irritating.
I hope that Mr. MILNE will always
write for Miss IRENE WANBRUGH, for
nobody could be in closer sympathy with
the lightness of his touch; his pleasant
habit of understatement is admirably
reflected in her quiet undertones—in-
deed, in my seat adjacent to the Pit, I
missed a good deal of the entertainment.
I hope, too, that he will often have
his humour interpreted by Mr. Dion
Boucicault, who did so well by him
in Wurzel - Flummery, and
again does good service in the
less distinguished part of the
statistician, Baacter.
As the daughter, Miss Iso-
BEL ELSoM was excellent in the
scenes with her Mummy, but
was unfortunate in having to
be paired off with the poet. In
the part of John Tremayne Mr.
BEN WEBSTER offered a suffi-
ciently solid contrast to the
prevailing levity. It was not
quite clear, unless there had
been a change of coiffure on
her part, why Tremayne should
want to return to his discarded
mate; but I dare say that,
when you have had nothing
but the society of lions for
nineteen years, even an old
wife has her attractions.
Belinda was preceded by
Monica's Blue Boy, a nice little
wordless idyll by Sir ARTHUR
PINERo and Sir FREDERIC
Cowen. It had nothing to
do with MAETERLINck's Blue
Bird, but was concerned with
a war-time Cinderella and a
wounded soldier for her Prince.
It “featured ” Miss MARY GLYNNE,
Mr. ERIC LEwis and Mr. MARTIN LEwis.
I say “featured” because Sir ARTHUR
had, most unhappily, to call in the aid
of a cinema trick to explain to us that
the obscure Private was actually Sir
Lancelot Lovejoy, Bart., the sort of
information that is always difficult to
convey without words. O. S.

I suspect Mr. ZANGWILL's trouble to

serious a person for a farce-maker.
He has, of course, a pretty wit: can

MARMADUKE AND MILLICENT.
I ought first perhaps to explain that the arrival of Milli-
cent took us all by surprise. We supposed that we were
to welcome Marmaduke and Maximilian, but it appeared
that at the last moment Maximilian developed so strong
a dislike to shifting his headquarters that Millicent was
substituted for him. It was obviously much better—at least
according to Peggy—that we should enlarge our family circle
by the addition of a boy and a girl, thus securing a proper
balance between the sexes. Only the gardener seemed to be
seriously affected by the change that had taken place. He
was for sending Millicent back at once. Millicent, however,
had so far ingratiated herself with the family at sight that by
unanimous vote she was retained on the strength of the
establishment. We all felt that it was impossible to allow
a lady with so much native charm to go out of the family.
Maximilian might be all that the gardener's fancy painted
him, but Millicent was on the spot, and there, more or less,
she remained.
We welcomed them in full force on their arrival. They
had been conveyed to the pleasaunce in which they were to
disport themselves in a handcart and a suit of dittos made
of strong light-brown sacking. That is to say, each of
them had a suit of that kind, in which their limbs, the
delicate limbs of Marmaduke and Millicent, were so rigor.
ously constricted and concealed that the newcomers made
no sound either of protest or of greeting. They were soon
debarrassed of their garb, and one after another slid and
scrambled lightly to the ground amidst the hearty cheers
of the spectators. As soon as they felt the earth under.
their feet they leapt away and continued their course until
they had put as much space as was possible between them.
selves and us. It was very noticeable how, even under
these distressing circumstances, Millicent maintained the
gentleness and Marmaduke the impetuous roughness of
their respective sexes. Both seemed to declare that
friendly relations between us were impossible until the
indignity of their conveyance and clothing had been duly
apologised for. They might be black, but that colour was
honourable to them as marking their proud descent from
a line of funereal ancestors. Until explanations had been
given they were bound to maintain social distinctions and to
remain as far as possible from the rudeness of our scrutiny.
At this point John, who had been engaged in a flanking
movement under cover of some bushes, shouted out to us
that Marmaduke had a ring in his nose and Millicent had
no kink in her tail. The ring was joyfully welcomed, as
giving us a firm status in the ranks of those who keep the

not to overtax our brains. The important point, however,
is that he puts the causes of Russia's present collapse
clearly before us. He shows that, when the War was
thrust upon her, she was rotten at the core because there was
no “organic bond of union between ruler and people.” It
is obvious to anyone who studies her condition that what

NEW MEN AND OLD STUDIES.
[A volume has recently appeared under the title of The Value of the
Classics, in which “three hundred competent observers, representing
the leading interests of modern life” in America and including three
living Presidents of the United States, WILsoN, TAFT and Roosey ELT,
testify their conviction that classical studies are of essential value in
the best type of liberal education.]
O YE Humanists half-hearted, now reluctantly resigned
To concede the claim of science to control the youthful
mind,
Once again cry Sursum corda—reinforcement comes at last
From an unexpected quarter in a wondrous counterblast.
If there is a modern country which effete tradition hates,
Surely 'tis the Great Republic known as the United States,
Home of. hustlers and of boosters, home of energy and
“vim,”
Filled with innovating notions bubbling over at the brim.
Nowhere else can we discover, though we closely scan the
map, -
Such a readiness in scrapping anything there is to scrap ;
Yet the pick of her progressives boldly swarm into the lists
As the most unflinching champions of the harried Human-
ists.
WILsoN, TAFT and TEDDY RoosevELT figure in the foremost
flight,
Followed by three hundred chosen men of leading and of
light— -
Men of great and proved achievement in diversified careers,
Statesmen, lawyers, doctors, bankers, railwaymen and en-
gineers.
Dons of course may be discounted, also College Presidents,
But the most impressive statements come from scientific
gents, - - -
Who admit that education on a humanistic base
Gives their students vast advantage in the specializing race.
Botany relies on Latin ever since LINN.EUs' days;
Biologic nomenclature draws on Greek in countless ways;
While in medicine it is obvious you can never take your
oath -
What an ailment means exactly if you haven't studied both.
Heads of business corporations, magnates in the world of
trade, .
'Neath the banner of the Classics formidably stand arrayed,
Holding with a firm conviction that their faithful study
brings -
Knowledge of the art of handling men and regulating things.
Courage, ye depressed upholders of the old curriculum,
Quit your mood apologetic, bang the loud scholastic drum,
For the verdict of the Yankees queers the scientific pitch
When the Humanists were struggling in their last defensive
ditch. -

MARMADUKE AND MILLICENT.
I ought first perhaps to explain that the arrival of Milli-
cent took us all by surprise. We supposed that we were
to welcome Marmaduke and Maximilian, but it appeared
that at the last moment Maximilian developed so strong
a dislike to shifting his headquarters that Millicent was
substituted for him. It was obviously much better—at least
according to Peggy—that we should enlarge our family circle
by the addition of a boy and a girl, thus securing a proper
balance between the sexes. Only the gardener seemed to be
seriously affected by the change that had taken place. He
was for sending Millicent back at once. Millicent, however,
had so far ingratiated herself with the family at sight that by
unanimous vote she was retained on the strength of the
establishment. We all felt that it was impossible to allow
a lady with so much native charm to go out of the family.
Maximilian might be all that the gardener's fancy painted
him, but Millicent was on the spot, and there, more or less,
she remained.
We welcomed them in full force on their arrival. They
had been conveyed to the pleasaunce in which they were to
disport themselves in a handcart and a suit of dittos made
of strong light-brown sacking. That is to say, each of
them had a suit of that kind, in which their limbs, the
delicate limbs of Marmaduke and Millicent, were so rigor-
ously constricted and concealed that the newcomers made
no sound either of protest or of greeting. They were soon
debarrassed of their garb, and one after another slid and
scrambled lightly to the ground amidst the hearty cheers
of the spectators. As soon as they felt the earth under,
their feet they leapt away and continued their course until
they had put as much space as was possible between them-
selves and us. It was very noticeable how, even under
these distressing circumstances, Millicent maintained the
gentleness and Marmaduke the impetuous roughness of
their respective sexes. Both seemed to declare that
friendly relations between us were impossible until the
indignity of their conveyance and clothing had been duly
apologised for. They might be black, but that colour was
honourable to them as marking their proud descent from
a line of funereal ancestors. Until explanations had been
given they were bound to maintain social distinctions and to
remain as far as possible from the rudeness of our scrutiny.
At this point John, who had been engaged in a flanking
movement under cover of some bushes, shouted out to us
that Marmaduke had a ring in his nose and Millicent had
no kink in her tail. The ring was joyfully welcomed, as
giving us a firm status in the ranks of those who keep the
aristocrats of the grunting world for profit or for susten-
ance. The absence of a kink from Millicent's tail was ob-
served with regret, but it was felt that we must not expect
everything, and it was probable that the lady had qualities
of heart which would amply atone for this minor deficiency.
Possibly too a kink might develop later on, when she had
become more accustomed to her surroundings. To be tied
up as she had been in a tight and blinding sack was enough
to make any tail limp and kinkless.
Thus we have become members of the pig-keeping fra-

us the chance—to help her to help herself. Mr. WILTON's
picture of the almost incredible bravery of loyal Russians
gives me a real hope that the next chapter in this story
may see the country purging herself from corruption and
rising above the calamities which traitors, both within
and without, have brought upon her.
Under the title, Paris Through an Attic (DENT), Mrs.
A. HERBAGE EDWARDs has written what might be described
as a little epic of contented poverty, or, if not exactly
poverty, the restricted means with which young people
often have to begin life, but enjoy their “golden slumbers"
none the less. Having courageously decided to take each
other—the husband a youthful philologist with an eye to
distinction at the Sorbonne, and the wife a manager of
almost uncanny aptitude—for better or for worse, they
dashed off to the Boule. Mich. direct from church, and there,
with infinite good humour, set up “cubby-hole” house-
keeping, furnishing and maintaining this mansarde abode
on an incredibly minute ex- - -
penditure and having all the 2.

one wants to know now, when

parative wealth has come to the

his brave ally any happier, or
do they, like one Elia and his

through South Wales and some Southern English counties,
the revelation of an interesting and unusual personality, some
whimsical points of view, and that naive simplicity and direct-
ness which made his former diary so entertaining. And you
will not be disappointed. But I am enough of a Philistine
to be frankly bored by entries like the following: “When I
reached the Three Blackbirds at Llantarnum, I had my first
glass of beer of the day and enjoyed it very much. It was
a good brew, mild and yet ... frothy and yet without
gas. I would most certainly have had a second glass if any
company had been present. But as I was the only customer
it was not long before I left.” And I wish I could say that
such passages were rare. Details of this kind are for the
lovers of small beer of a future generation to dig out of the
forgotten notebooks of their literary protégés, but are scarce
matter for contemporary history. Even tramp poets ought
to keep a sense of proportion. But I hasten to add that I
enjoyed the most of it quite unreservedly, and can advise
the reader to make acquaintance with this kindly simple
soul if he has not already done so. He will share my per-
petual wonder as to where the poet stowed away all the
pennies that he gave to the children and his fellow-travellers.

done gallant work in the New Army, has collected a number
of fugitive short stories into a small volume with the in-
genuous title of Back Numbers (SIMPRIN). Because the
experiment was a bold one, and because I like short stories,
I wish I could give these a more whole-hearted welcome.
The fact is, however, that I find Mr. WESTBRook's manner
considerably better than his matter; he is essentially one
of those raconteurs who can tell a tale for all it is worth—
and a good deal more. Thus, while his dialogue is crisp
and his personal asides often expressed with the happiest
humour, the argument of his stories is generally so involved
and unhuman as hardly to escape a charge of silliness.
Several of the episodes, and these the best, are concerned
with theatrical or cinematograph affairs. “The Circuit,”
for example, which I prefer to anything else in the volume,
is a well-observed little study of a music-hall singer. But
I must return to my verdict that most of these “fugitives”
display no very urgent reason for their recall. But let not
Mr. WESTBRook be discouraged. He has already a pleasant
---- - - ---- | style and an invaluable gift
of making the commonplace
sound almost amusing. With
these advantages and a better
equipment of material he
should contrive a work of real
humour that I look forward
to reading.
In Some War Impressions
(SAMP so N Low, MAR ston)
modern journalism is seen in
its best form and serving its
most useful purpose. To col-
lect the copy for his little bro-
chure, Mr. JEFFERY FARNoL
clearly went forth, a Press-
reporter undisguised, with his
notebook in his hand and his
eyes and ears wide open. He
toured the Munition Factories,
he went to sea, and he walked
over the battlefields of Flan-
ders; and at the end of the day
he recorded what he had seen
and how it had made him feel,
and published it all in the English and American Press,
that so the peoples of these two great nations might realise
the facts of the War and for ever cease from quarrels amongst
themselves. The whole series of impressions is now col-
lected in a paper cover and makes a hundred-and-eighteen
pages, which you will read at a sitting and not forget in a
lifetime, if you are one of those who speak English and love
liberty. You may think at moments that the eloquence
becomes a little over-eloquent, even artificial, and that the
facts are blurred rather than emphasised thereby; but you
will remember that Mr. FARNoL wrote at a time when the
Anglo-Saxon affections seemed to be in want of the nourish-
ment of propaganda and when the main issues and the
deciding factors were not so clear as they are to-day.

TO THE KAISER'S VICTIMS.
Over the barriers of your dead you climb,
Flung wave on wave across the tortured plain;
And pay for every rood of reeking slime
Its myriad toll of newly-slain.
And ever, where your legions on us broke,
Close-packed to give them courage, drugged and
driven,
Our line has held as when a forest oak
Rocks to the storm but stands unriven.
How long before the horror grows too grim 2
Before you tire of playing the dumb slave's part,
Sent to his death to suit a master's whim,
And something snaps within your heart?
For you have lost the old illusion's spell,
The faith that you were called of Heaven to fight
Against the onset of the lords of hell
Leagued to destroy the sons of light.
Now, when that faith is blown to barren dust,
How long, I wonder, will you care to die,
Having no King whose word a man may trust,
Nor any Cause except a lie?
APPLIED MILITARISM.
THE retired Colonel is of a very different calibre from his
civilian contemporary, who passes the evening of his life in
comfort of body and peace of mind. His mind dwells upon
slaughter and sudden death. He lifts up his nostrils and
scents blood afar off. When he chances momentarily to be
silent it is probable that he is meditating on martial law
and discipline.
The Colonel of our Reserve Battalion has retired. No
official explanation was given to camouflage the real cause,
which was an open secret among his admirers. Our Colonel
retired because he felt that the trivial round of Reserve
Battalion duties was eating into his heart and gradually
killing off his white battle-corpuscles; because he knew that
the only remedy for purging apathy and restoring the mili-
tant nerve-tissue lay in retirement.
That tonic is apparently working wonders. The Colonel
is at present busily engaged in applying the finishing
touches to a monograph, entitled The General Application
of Militarism. He has not yet found a publisher, luckily;
but should he do so and should his book—duly expurgated
of enthusiastic but unconventional expletives—at last find
its way into print there will undoubtedly be a certain per-
centage of adverse criticism, if it be taken seriously. In
the meanwhile our Colonel, realising the revolutionary ten-
dencies of his theories, has kindly permitted a few extracts
to be published in advance as a sort of “Take Cover”
signal, so that the public may have some warning before his
literary shrapnel bursts over them.

DANNY MEAHAN.
A TRUE HISTORY.
WHEN the news came that Danny
Meahan was “missing,” Ballymell,
though sorry for his old mother in her
cabin down the boreen, was, on the
whole, inclined to regard it as a dis-
tinction, and when a week or so after-
wards he was reported “found" again
a vague feeling of public disappoint-
ment prevented her neighbours from
showing much interest in the matter.
This explains perhaps the wealth of
detail with which, when I went to feli-
citate her, Mrs. Meahan unfolded the
story.
“Glory be to goodness, Ma'am,” she
said, “it’s afther growin' a terrible war,
so it is, and very thriflin' men some of
thim generals must be, one day losin'
a soldier so they'd not know where to
put their hands on him and findin'
him the next. That's what they've
put past my Danny, and a quare sthory
it is. You that does be knowin' Danny
since he was the height of me hand
and him wid two black eyes more often
face for Mass in hopes His Riverence
might be apt to think it was just dirt
he had on him and not fightin' at all
—you'd believe that Danny was half
out of his mind wid temper when his
great tooth schemed on him—the one
Peter Hanrahan was afther catchin'
wid a great lump of turft one day and
they waiting wid the ass and cart to
dhrive old Mrs. Rafferty to chapel.
Danny's riginent was sittin' face to
face wid thim Germans that time and
he had the fear in him that there'd be
fightin' and he not in it, for his great
tooth was afther gettin' outrageous on
him the way he couldn't keep himself
from bellowin', and Captain Quinn all
the while sayin', 'Howld yer din or
you'll be aſther yellin' worse and you
a corpse.' So he told his Captain, and
the Captain he sent him back to where
the doctor officer was that thravels wid
the riginent. Whin he got there the
doctor officer was very civil, and says
he to the young doctor that was there
thrainin’ himself on the boys says he,
“It's the basemint for this felly and
not too soon at all.'
Sir," says the young doctor; ‘och, look
at the eye he has and him seemin' quite
calm.”
“Danny, as you know, your honour,
Ma'am, has the best manners in him
of any bhoy between here and Cork, and
he didn't like to conthradict the gintle-
men, but he had to spake up at that.
“‘Beggin' your pardon, Sir, sez he,
“but doin' any sort of altheration on
me eyes would take too long at all. If
you'd just be so kind as to lift out me
great tooth that’s schemed on me I'll
be gettin' back to the threnches.’
“‘Quite so, sez the doctor officer,
“but givin' a lift to a great tooth like
yours, Danny, isn't a thriflin' job at all,
and the little doctor here and meself
are not the men we were, what wid the
privations we're afther endjurin' and
all, and you'll have to go down to the
basemint where they kapes the doctors
safe on purpose, and they'll wrestle the
great tooth out of ye and set ye up.'
“So Danny he went down to the
basemint and there was another doctor

‘Peter Hanrahan aimed at it wid a
lump of turft and me laughin' so it
was outside me face and it's never had
the clane colour to it from that day to
this.'
“‘Quite so, my man, quite so,' says
the doctor; “it’s easy seen that you've
the rights of the matther. Just go
along wid this doaty Corporal here
that's afther takin' a great fancy to ye
and in a while we'll have ye well.'
“So Danny went along wid the
Corporal, who was that fond of him
he'd never lave him day or night, and
the next mornin' they went out arm-in-
arm, and the Corporal he began walk-
in' up some ould sthairs that led into
a ship.
“‘What's this at all 2’ says Danny.
“‘Just an ould ship, so it is,’ says
the Corporal.
“‘But what's in it at all?' says
Danny, sthandin' where he was, “It's
a dintist I’m wantin' and go back to
the riginent.’
“‘Faith, but they've lovely dintists
on here,' says the Corporal, pulling at
his arm.
“They wint on and another Corporal
met thin.
“So it's yourself's the dintist?’ says
Danny.
“‘God save us,’ says the second Cor-
poral. “What's gone wid ye lookin'
for dintists here 2'
“Whisht now,' says the first Corporal,
him ye mind as was holdin' Danny's
arm, “don’t be conth radictin' him or
there'll be holy war, for he's a sthrong
one an' no mistake. Just take him
down inside and lave him see where the
dintist is.'
“So thin Danny saw what they were
manin' and he started to run, but he
was too late. They had him bate and
took him on the boat.
“Three weeks he was out of it all,
and thin one day his officer was count-
in' up his men, and he says, says he,
“‘Colonel, I misremember to have

“Thin the Colonel looks at his papers
and he says,

tain Quinn.

we've not heard hair or hide of him—

the Captain. 'Meahan's not a slow

they looked again, and the way it was

A DOG'S AGREEMENT.
[Imposed on a man, not his master, who
offers to take him for a walk in the country.]
1. Any attempt on your part to as-
sume the attitude of a master will be
regarded, for the purposes of this agree-
ment, as an offence against the liberties
of my species. - -
2. I will walk one hundred yards
behind you, and, upon being called, I
reserve the right to smile with my tail,
and decline to decrease the distance.
In view of the fact that you have the
power to exhibit anger and other in-
firmities, you are to be considered, for
the purposes of this walk, dangerous
and, possibly, hostile.
3. I reserve the right, on the ap-
proach of a motor car, traction engine,
or other vehicle, to stand directly in its
path until my position has become
appreciably perilous, and, on your
calling me, to wag my tail to its full
extent until such vehicle has passed.
If necessary I shall be at liberty to
dodge among the wheels. Any re-
sponsibility for my possible decease to
remain entirely with you.
4. On the approach of a hostile dog
the fight to ensue shall be conducted at
your risk and at sufficient distance
from you to obviate your intervention,
and I am at liberty to receive such
injuries as may render me an object of
sympathy in the eyes of my Missus,
and induce her to view the episode in
the light of a delinquency on your part.
5. Any pause in the walk on your
part shall be strictly observed by me,
the interval of one hundred yards re-
maining undiminished. On your giving
satisfactory evidence of an intention
to retrace your steps homeward I have
the right to turn about and precede
you, increasing the distance between us
so that I may arrive home at least a
quarter-of-a-mile in front of you, with
the full appearance of having been lost.
6. Upon your eventual return I re-
serve the right to greet you, before my
Missus, in a manner indicative of com-
plete forgiveness. The injuries received
on my casual adventures shall not
prejudice the situation so far as I am
concerned.
7. I reserve the right to accept in a
spirit of tolerant fatigue any attempt
on your part to put blame upon me.
8. In the event of your showing a
disinclination to abide by any of the
articles of this agreement I am en-
titled to exert such moral pressure
on my Missus as may cause a tempo-
rary strain in your normal relation to
each other, regard being always had,
however, to your possible influence
over her in the matter of my food.

as may occur for making use of you

SONNET OF SPRING THOUGHTS.
TIME was when in sweet Spring my
thoughts would rove
O'er hill and dale, and meditate the thrill
Of springing Life in all things; and the
shrill
Sweet note of birds that strive to sing
their love;
They lingered in the primrose-scented
l'OWe
And dallied with the merry daffodil
That shakes her yellow skirts out frill
by frill;
They circled iridescent as the dove.
But whither, this sweet Spring, do my
thoughts fly?
Roam they o'er fields abloom—in prim-
rose woods?
Or greet they with delight the game-
some lamb 2
Not so. They linger near the well-
loved sty
In which reposes — chiefest of my
goods—
A noble PIG ! (Oh, fragrant hopes of
ham!)
TRAIN TACTICS.
A costEMPORARY having thrown out
much advice as to travelling on crowded
trains and dealing with the alien rush,
a few additional points which have been
overlooked may not be out of place.
While waiting for a train do not ex-
hibit any signs of restlessness lest you
be mistaken for an alien. Take a little
rest while waiting by leaning up against
one of the bookstalls. No charge is
made for this.
To board a crowded train wait until
it stops at your station. This is most
important. Do not run down the line
to meet the train, even if you have not
met for a long time.
Once in the train leave your name and
address with the guard in case you may
be mislaid in the rush of debarcation.
Remember that courtesy costs noth-
ing, and while there is no law to prohibit
your standing on a fellow-passenger's
feet you should not loiter about on them.
Should he attempt to strike you step
aside as smartly as the crowd permits,
and, having worked your way to the
door without attracting attention, drop
off the train unobtrusively.
“Eggs from guaranteed sisters to Snowden's
competition leaders.”—Glasgow Paper.
Is this an intelligent anticipation of the
treatment that the Pacifists will receive
from the women-voters at the General
THE THREE PEIRASES.
“WHo'll have a cooler?” the late
FRED LESLIE (of immortal memory)
used to ask, flinging a handful of torn-
up paper into the air and shivering as
the flakes came down. Another com-
edian, not less famous, has also just
invented a reducer of heat, but in his
case it is mental heat rather than
physical; and the cure consists of three
phrases.
These phrases, he maintains, if ap-
plied systematically and rhythmically
—no matter what the argument or
cause of the dispute or the height of
the other party's thermometer—are
bound to bring about either perfect
peace or the rout of the enemy, prob-
ably in silence. It may be a taxi-
driver smarting under the justice of
the fare paid him; it may be a too offi-
cious official; it may merely be a rude
stranger—the same result is guaranteed.
These are the phrases:—
1. Don't say that.
2. Don't be unkind.
3. Now you're being humorous.
For the sake of an example let us
take the case—perhaps the most prob-
able—of a taxi-driver. But an Emperor
would do as well. The cabman's fare
is three shillings and you have given
him a shilling tip, but, owing to the
lateness of the hour, or his distance
from home, or the rain, he considers
himself underpaid.
“Here,” he says, “the job's worth
more than that, isn't it 2"
“Don’t say that.”
“But I do say it. A gentleman who
was a gentleman would make it worth
my while.”
“Don’t be unkind.”
“Unkind ' What do you mean? If
I'd known I wasn't going to get more
than this I wouldn't have taken you.”
“Now you're being humorous.”
“Humorous be — . I'm not
humorous.”
“Don’t say that!”
“Oh, go to - ?
“Don’t be unkind.”
“If ever you hail me again, strike
me pink if I drive you—no, not for a
quid a mile.”
“Now you're being humorous.”
“Humorous! I tell you I'm not
humorous. I’m serious.”
“Don’t say that.”
By this time any ordinary cabman
will be moving off. In the case of the
extraordinary ones the three phrases
must recur a little oftener, that's all.
I mentioned an Imperor just now;
let us try his case. The same prescrip-
tion applies.
“I offer you a German peace."
9. None of the articles of this agree-
“Don't say that.”

Why should these three phrases be
so deadly? Their first merit is to lift
their user into a position of superiority
which cannot be without its effect on
the other. Then they give him the sem-
blance of a pained reasonableness, and a
pained reasonableness is both offensive
and defensive, being one of the most
difficult armour-plates to penetrate and
also, in time, an irresistible siege-gun.
* >
We leave humour to you,
always has you at a disadvantage and
must in time wear you out ; while to
go on to accuse you of humour is even
subtler. You know perfectly well that
you had no intention of being humor-
ous; you even know that you were
not; but since the desire to be thought
humorous is a prevailing human pas-
sion you come in time to wonder if,
after all, you may not have brought off
something rather good, and in that fond
hope your anger fades.
As a matter of fact, although there
must always be moments of irascibility,
the War has not, so far as one's ob-
servation goes, increased bad temper;
rather the reverse. Probably our ever-
present consciousness of so stupendous
a calamity has made individual bicker-
ings too petty, or we have been stunned
into equability; whatever the reason
the fact remains that one may pass
about this great city of conflicting am-
bitions and see only human beings in
amity. Here and there the driver of
one vehicle may snarl a sarcasm at the
driver of another (who obviously ought
to have brought out his mother to hold
the reins in his stead), but, take them
all round, tempers are being amazingly
well kept.
Although the inventor of the Three
system in order that those who practise
it may triumph over their antagonists,
one may entertain the suspicion (for
he is a great philosopher) that part of
his purpose was that those who practise
it should triumph over themselves too.
For it would be impossible to put it
into effect without absolute calmness,
and to maintain calmness in disputation
is more than the beginning of wisdom
and victory.

Augustus was a plucky little thing,
But so ill-made for purposes of war
That never a crisis could persuade the KING
To put him into any kind of corps;
So, failing sadly to unsheathe the sword,
He got a billet on the Drainage Board.
The years rolled by. His friends received W.C.'s,
And D.S.O.'s, and multitudes of Bars,
And all their clothes were covered by degrees
With braid and badge, with chevrons and with
stars;
The only wear that showed what he had done
Were two twin elbows shining in the sun.
And then the coupons came; but he used none,
For always in his other coat they lay,
Or else he had not heart to squander one,
And, when he had, all meatless was the day—
A common tale, but this is what is sad,
That in this case it drove the young man mad.
Or so I gather, for I met him last
With four strange objects to his sleeve attached;
He said, “I may not be the soldier-caste,
But nowhere is my patriot spirit matched,
Of which these emblems eloquently speak,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 15th.--The coinci-
dence of the German offensive in
Flanders with the Gatwick Spring
Meeting emboldened Mr. GEORGE LAM-
BERT to make a renewed appeal to the
Government to put an end to horse-
racing. Mr. MACPHERSON gave him
the stereotyped answer: racing, he
alleged, was necessary to maintain the
breed of horses. Mr. CHANCELLOR's
reminder that it also maintained the
breed of bookmakers was ruled out as
irrelevant.
In a Question appearing in
the name of Sir John REEs
the Government of India was
spelt with a little “g.” Sir
John assured the House,
almost with tears in his
voice, that he was not re-
sponsible for depriving it of
its capital. Even Lord MoR-
LEY, that well-known icono-
clast, who once trifled with
the same initial, would hardly
have been guilty of such an
outrage—not, at any rate,
during his own occupation
of the India Office.
If Mr. LYNCH is not care-
ful it will be said of him,
as of another long-winded
orator, that he relies on his
imagination for his facts and
on his memory for his jokes.
His suggestion that the Do-
minions were annoyed by s
the use of the term, “My N
Army,” in Royal proclama-s
tions was curtly dismissed
by Mr. BonAR LAw with the
remark that it was “common
form "; and Mr. LYNCH could
think of no more original
retort than “Why does not
the right hon. gentleman
say, ‘My National Debt"?”
The War, which has laid
low so many ancient monuments, has
spared one pillar of the British Consti-
tution—the doctrine that if a difference
of opinion arises between the amateur
and professional heads of a fighting
service the amateur stays and the pro-
fessional goes. General TRENCHARD,
late Chief of the Air Staff, has now
retired into the limbo that temporarily
contains Lord JELLICoE and Sir WIL-
LIAM ROBERTSON. But Lord Rother-
MERE remains, and all is well. The
enemy possibly thinks it even better.
The discussion on the Military Service
Act chiefly turned upon the abolition of
exemptions and the reconstruction of
tribunals. A good many Members
shared Mr. ANDERSON's disinclination

of NATIONAL SERVICE. Even Mr.
HAYES-FISHER admitted that the clause
under review was open to suspicion,
and urged in its defence that the tri-
bunals would be appointed by himself,
and not by Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs, who
might be regarded as too much of a
recruiting-sergeant. Mr. SMALLwood
declared that for his part he preferred
bombs to bureaucracy.
Who said Ireland is not united 2
What Sir HoRACE PLUNKETT and the
Convention had failed to accomplish

º
SIR EDWARD CABSON.
Hardly had Mr. HEALY concluded a
caustic analysis of some of the pro-
posals in the Bill—particularly the
conscription of the clergy—when the
House was half-delighted, half-startled
to hear Sir Edward CARson deliver a
slashing attack upon the Govern-
ment, declaring that by their secretive
methods they were causing grave
anxiety in Ireland and were playing
fast and loose with both parties in that
country. The Nationalists, with Mr.
DILLON at their head, could not contain
their joy at seeing their ancient foe
join forces with them. Once again
they were Irishmen all, and all “agin'
the Gov'mint.” Sir GEORGE CAVE with
difficulty got a hearing, so instant were

MR. HEALY.
was allowed to announce some im-
portant concessions. The right of
appeal is to remain, and the clergy are
not to be conscribed.
Tuesday, April 16th.-Ireland again
dominated the proceedings. One as-
pect of the Irish character was illus-
trated by Sir THOMAs EsmondE, who
presented a petition against conscrip-
tion by five hundred inhabitants of
Ballindaggin; another by Mr. MAC-
PHERSON in his story of an Irish sixteen-
year-old who had camouflaged his age
in order to go on foreign service. It
makes one wonder if the authorities
would not have obtained
better results from Ireland
if they had posted up, “No
Irish Need Apply” on the
front of the recruiting offices
—and left the back door
open.
Mr. KING added two par-
ticularly fine mare's nests to
his unequalled collection. His
complaint of the “inexplicable
persecutions” inflicted by the
British Government upon a
philanthropic Serbian lady
called Popowitch, who had
gone out to Malta to aid refu-
gees, was countered by Mr.
BRUCE with the information
that the woman was a German
agent and a very dangerous
enemy to this country. Of
another of Mr. KING's ques-
tions, vividly describing the
horrors of a Home . Office
camp for Conscientious Ob-
jectors, it was stated by the
#" UNDER-SECRETARY that it was
º “inaccurate from beginning
to end.” To this Mr. KING
brilliantly retorted that it was
". inuman to err.
Still a little doubtful of the
Government's sincerity Sir
Edward CARson neverthe-
less announced that he would
consent to be put under the control of
the Nationalists, or even the Sinn
Feiners, rather than come under the
domination of Germany.
A grave but determined speech from
the PRIME MINISTER, who declared, on
General Foch's authority, that we had
as yet lost “nothing vital,” wound up
the debate; and the Military Service
Bill passed its Third Reading by 301
to 103.
Wednesday, April 17th.-On its arri-
val in the other House, most of the
Peers seemed to look upon it as a dis:
agreeable medicine, to be swallowed
hastily and with a wry face. Lord
SALISBURY was concerned at the mys-
terious connection between Conscrip-

hitherto unsuspected acquaintance with
the opinions of the British working-
man, averred that Labour cared little
for Irish aspirations. Lord CREWE, as
a matter of personal taste, would have
preferred Home Rule first and Con-
scription a long way afterwards. The
exemption of the clergy aroused the
wrath of His Grace of CANTERBURY,
who assured the House that the de-
mand for it had not come from the
Church Militant of England. Lord
LANSDown E was doubtful about Con-
scription for Ireland. Not long ago this
might have sealed the fate of the Bill.
But since he took up the rôle of polite
letter-writer the Peers no longer tremble
at his frown. Lord DERBY expressed
his confidence in the patriotism of many
of the Nationalists and prophesied that
Ireland could and would repair the
wastage of the present battle.
Thursday, April 18th-The House
of Lords passed the Military Service
Bill. Lord DUNRAVEN, as “a very ardent
Home Ruler,” produced the most in-
genious excuse for his countrymen's
unwillingness to fight that has yet been
heard. Ireland had been contaminated
by the British refugees who had fled to
that country to escape military service.
An equally ardent Unionist, Lord
Irishmen's refusal to enlist was simply
due to “funk"—not their own, be it
understood, but that of the British
Government, whose policy towards
Ireland for the last ten years had
brought them into contempt.
The Commons heard with anxiety
that Sir DAVID HENDERson had followed
General TRENCHARD into retirement.
Lord RotherMERE, however, still re-
tains the confidence of Mr. BILLING.
With feelings akin to horror I read
Sir HEdworth MEUx's charge, that the
Government, by limiting the importa-
tion of steel, were ruining the corset
industry. Is Britannia to be deprived
of her bulwarks at a time like this and
become as amorphous as a German
Haus-frau ? It was comforting to learn
from Sir ALBERT STANLEY's reply that
the Government had no such sinister
intention; and that Sir HEDworTH, a
little out of practice in the niceties of
navigation, had “missed stays.”
The House held its breath while Sir
ALFRED MoSD recounted his intrepid
adventures on the roof of Westminster
Hall, but was less impressed by his
statement that the method of repairing
it was so ingenious that “Members
would wonder where the money had
gone.” That is no novelty in Govern-

AT THE PLAY.
“THE NAUGHTY WIFE.”
Hilary Farrington, possessed by that
craving for solitude which is apt to
occur with married literary artists, pro-
posed to run down for the night to his
country bungalow. It was a lucky
mischance for us that he forgot the
little despatch - case containing the
manuscript of his new creation and
had to return for it, otherwise we
should never have had this delightful
play. For he is just in time to learn
that his wife is about to elope
that very night, her intention
being confirmed by a letter
that comes prematurely into
his hands—a letter composed
on traditional lines, bidding
him farewell and ending with
“Yours faithfully.”
There is no scene. On the
contrary he at once adopts the
attitude of a mari complaisant,
actively and altruistically com-
plaisant. Her happiness is his
only consideration. Has she
selected the right man to run
away with ? “I must be satis-
fied about this other fellow,”
he says; “he must be worthy
of you.” Is she taking enough
pretty frocks with her? Pretty
frocks are an essential stimu-
lant on a honeymoon. He
enumerates several that he re-
members as having been worn
by her on particular and ro-
mantic occasions; makes her
maid bring them out and pack
them in a large trunk before
his eyes. (Incidentally Icom-
mend this device for introduc-
ing on the stage more costumes
than could possibly be worn
by any one actress within the
time-limits imposed by the
curfew). Her maid, too, must
go with her, not for the sake
of appearances, but to enhance the
lady's comfort. Nor will he hear of
her suffering the inconvenience of a
long night journey in a stuffy, train.
He will place his bungalow and his car
at the disposal of the runaways.
All this, which is of course contrary
to the rules laid down for outraged
husbands, is most embarrassing to the
wife; also to the tertium quid when he
punctually appears to fetch her. But
they must needs accept the scheme of
Paradise which has been sketched for
them, since the only alternative is a
revolver-shot which will send the lover
to the “place where he belongs.”

sisting the adversary, but giving way to
his pressure that he may the better trip
him up and confound him. The couple

fore he has collected a house-party on
the telephone—his wife's uncle (a pre-
late) and an enterprising widow who has
just been thrown over by the philan-

in another car at express speed for the
bungalow. Arriving in advance of the
elopers, he has just time to light the

flowers and prepare a succulent meal
for their greater content.
What follows is more on Palais Royal
lines (with a difference in favour of the
proprieties); and though the play is
always kept going it cannot quite pre-
serve the freshness of its opening irony.
In the end, after taking some very sport-
ing risks, Hilary wins for the angels.
Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY's perform-
ance as the husband was extraordinarily
piquant. I have never known him to
show a keener interest in his work. I
did not pretend to take seriously his
|lapses into solemnity, but they were
very rare; and it was a pure delight to
watch him laying himself out to give
these two the time of their lives, and in

miserable till their shame and discom-
fiture were past bearing.
To give him so perfect a holiday
somebody had to be butchered, and
Miss GLADYs Cooper bore the sacrifice
with a noble patience. The third party
in these ménages is seldom heroic, but
Mr. STANLEY LoGAN accepted his
ridiculous situations with such bravado
as the case admitted. Miss ELLIs
JEFFREYs, as a forward-fighting widow
who knew the man she wanted and
meant to get him, however damaged,
was irresistible, and nobody grudged
(or envied) her the triumph-
ant recapture of her spoil. I
must add that Mr. HIGNETT
made, as usual, a very admir-
able man-servant, and this
time in circumstances which,
as you might guess, demanded
a more than usual discretion.
The play—whose title by
the way is not very satisfac-
tory, for it is the wife's head
and not her heart that gets
loose—is written by Mr. FRED
JACKson, “elaborated and re-
vised” by Mr. EDGAR SELwYN
and “produced " by no fewer
than four conspirators. Its
scenes profess to be placed in
New York and Long Island, but
there is nothing American in
it except a few cocktails and
an exotic phrase or two, as
when the lover, outwitted by
the husband, complains more
than once that “he's putting
something over on us.”
In case the title, or the im-
pression conveyed by a crude
outline of the plot, should ex-
cite false hopes, I feel bound
to say that even the scene

IN days when Bellona less madly

I find a brief respite in turning
To Barchester Towers.
How good are the women, how various,
As slowly their natures unfold !—
The feudal Miss Thorne; the gregarious
And amiable Eleanor Bold;
Mrs. Quiverful,dauntless though dowdy,
With fourteen young ravens to feed,
Who managed to melt Mrs. Proudie,
So great was her need.
Mrs. Proudie, of course, is prodigious,
A terror to friends and to foes,
Ambitious, correctly religious,
Yet leading her lord by the nose;
Very far from an angel or jewel,
Very near to a feminine Pope,
And priceless in waging the duel
That smashed Mr. Slope.
And who would not willingly linger
With you, O Signora, who twirled
Round the tip of your white little finger
Staid clerics and men of the world !
Commanding the spells of a Circe;
Bewitching, though crippled and
lame;
Redeeming your malice with mercy
And playing the game.

Reveal to our view no SEBASTIAN,
No martyr, and hardly a saint;
Though perhaps, by so freely discarding
Preferment and riches and fame,

With kindly and tolerant eyes;
You never set out to be witty,
Though seldom you failed to be wise;
You were neither ornate nor elliptic,
But most unaffectedly shrewd,
For the art that is consciously cryptic
You strictly tabooed.
Your outlook is certainly narrowed
To lives that are never sublime;
Our hearts are not haunted or harrowed
With desperate anguish or crime;

“DORA" AND THE IMPRESARIO;
OR, CURFEw Must BE RUNG To-NIGHT.
LoNDoN's sun had set as usual o'er the house-tops in the
West;
Weary ploughmen at Stoke Poges had attained their well-
earned rest;
But the toilers of the city blithely passed from work to play
And with ardour unabated strove to turn the night to day.
On the margin of the joy-tide stood a man whose cheeks
grew white -
As his stern companion murmured, “Curfew must be rung
to-night.”
“But my new revue,” he faltered, pointing to a gilded dome;
“Underneath my humble roof-tree mirth and beauty have
their home ;
Colour sets the drab world glowing, music weaves its magic
owers,
Art and nature toil together to improve the darkling hours.
Art is long and life grows longer when the day renews its light
Where the mystic lime effulges. Curfew can't be rung
to-night.”
Cold her eye and cold her accents as she bade his prating
cease ;
“You forget there is a war on ; these are but the toys of
peace.
Duty at the root of pleasure striketh with remorseless axe
(Nay, I mean the moral duty, not the entertainment tax).
Light and fuel must be rationed; we can only win the fight
By retirement on the home-front. Curfew must be rung
to-night.”
“Yet in times like these,” he pleaded, “human nature
needeth cheer;
What refreshment for the war-worn in the subtle contrast
here,
Where the problem-stage rehearses dramas of domestic strife
And the movie holds the mirror upside-down to actual life.
Would you chain the luckless Briton, in humanity's despite,
To his own depressing fireside? Curfew can't be rung
to-night.”
“‘Fireside?' Nay, the private coal-box will be rationed
too,” she said;
“He who does his daily duty should be glad to crawl to bed;
Work of national importance leaves no morbid lust for play;
Stern necessity compels us whither nature points the way,
England now expects, nay, orders, every man—and Eng-
land's right—
To fulfil his measured slumber. Curfew shall be rung
to-night.” -
“Dora.” turned with stately footsteps, strode within the old
church-door, - -
And her strong hands grasped the bell-rope worn by
Norman hands of yore. -
Far across the roaring city tolled the curfew long and loud,
Sending awe and taxis flying through the gay, unthinking
crowd. -
“This,” he muttered, “is the limit. Freedom's in a pretty
plight;
Summer-time dictates our rising—Curfew now is rung at
night.”

Came the lynx-eyed Coal Controller, grim and grimy sentinel.

used by one of my illustrious ancestors and have therefore
certainly contributed to the glory of my House. It is
absurd to suppose that I am constantly to place myself at
the beck and call of a person like the German KAISER. I
intend to act independently, be the consequences what they
may. At present conditions in Austria are of the most
alarming nature. Have ordered Count Czern IN to make a
peaceful speech, and in the course of it to hint as broadly
as he can, without actually saying so, that the great
obstacle to peace is WILLIAM THE WARRIOR-so they call
him at Headquarters. I hope to be with him when he
reads Czr:RNIN's speech, and shall much enjoy seeing him
rage and bluster. He does this kind of thing every day,
but nobody cares. Have also written a letter to my
brother-in-law, Sixtus, which he is to show to the French
PRESIDENT. In this letter I have expressed the greatest
possible admiration for the French, and have pledged
myself to support the just claims of France as regards
Alsace-Lorraine. This letter, of course, will come out, and
we shall see WILLIAM squirming more than ever. The fact
is I cannot become fond of WILLIAM, however hard I try.
He thinks I worship him. Really he is the vainest creature
in the world. - - * - - -
Monday.—CZERNIN made a peaceful speech to-day. As
regards Alsace-Lorraine he said there could be no discus-
sion on that point and no concession. There will be some
fun when my letter comes out. -
Tuesday.—Told CZERNIN I could not agree with him as
to Alsace-Lorraine. He asked me whether I was in favour
of restoring the provinces to France. I told him not to be
too inquisitive, but to go on making peaceful speeches in
the meantime. They effect nothing practical, but create
an impression of reasonableness which serves to distinguish
us from the Northern barbarians and their tinsel Emperor.
Wednesday.—Such a game! My letter to SIXTUs is
published in full in all the foreign papers. Telegrams have
been pouring in. One in particular came pouring in from
Berlin. It wanted to know whether I'd really written the
letter. Replied that I really had, but not in the form in
which it was published. Two words were misspelt so as
entirely to alter the sense of the letter. WILLIAM said he
was coming to see me. Let him come.
Thursday.—CzERNIN furious about my having written
the letter. Told him he must resign, which he at once
did, though he declared that he agreed with every word I
had written. “Why so angry then 2" I asked him.
“Because,” he answered, “Your Majesty did not consult
me as to the writing of that letter.” Begged him to withhold
his resignation till he had had time to telephone to Berlin
that the letter was a forgery.
Friday.—There is still a great to-do about the letter, but
the official view is that it is a forgery. The Big-wigs in
IBerlin are furious. If it gives them any pleasure to think
that I forged my own letter I do not wish to stand in their
way. However, I did say that the French claims to Alsace-
Lorraine were just, and that I would support them.
CzernIN has resigned again, and the Berlin Bogeyman is
threatening me with a visit in Vienna. Shall not encourage
him to come. Have thoroughly enjoyed myself during this
past week and have still a few surprises left in the basket.
CzERNIN keeps on resigning, and the Berlin Wonder sticks
fast to the telephone. How I detest that man!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.) -
THERE is a genial, let's-all-get-together atmosphere about
A Book of Remarkable Criminals (CAssell), written by
Mr. H. B. IRVING and dedicated to Mr. E. W. LUCAs, that
may go far to reconcile you to a society whose collective
character it were gross flattery to call dubious. Certainly
Mr. IRVING has assembled as rare a gallery of rogues as
ever figured in the Chamber of Wax Horrors, with this
difference, that while the art of the late Madame TUSSAUD
could do no more than show us the candle-hued counten-
ance of crime, here you have it analysed with a subtle and
highly skilled appreciation. Of the interest of the book
there can be no question—like torture it simply teems with
it; nor need you feel qualms about such a leaning towards
low company after the statement in the Introduction that
TENNYSON and Jowett once talked into the small hours
on the engrossing theme of murders. One agrees with
Mr. IRVING that this would have been a conversation worth
hearing. You will find material in plenty here, from the
life-history of CHARLEY PEACE, “the outstanding popular
figure in nineteenth-century crime,” to such amazing and
fantastic tales as the episode of the widow GRAs and her
“wounded pigeon.” They are told with a dramatic effect,
and especially, as you would expect from such a source, a
chuckling appreciation of the grim humour that is never far
away from such sordid tragedies. Mr. IRVING reminds us in
his Introduction that even all the horrors of the present time
may in expert hands “make very good reading for posterity.”
I thought I did not quite like Miss CLEMENCE DANE's
introductory chapter to First the Blade (HEINEMANN). It
seemed a trifle arch and artificial. On re-reading it after I
had finished the book I changed my mind, and I fancy the
main reason for the change was that I felt that so aston-
ishingly capable a craftswoman must be right and I wrong.
For here, believe me, is a little gem of a book. No story
to speak of; just a slight sketch of the childish and adol-
escent years of beautiful, sensitive, tender Laura Valentine,
and handsome, admirable, stodgy Henry Justin Cloud; a
broken engagement, and the promise of a better under-
standing—if he comes back safe from the wars. But
I have never seen a more complete vindication of the
modernist preference for analysis and characterisation dis-
played through trivial incident; while a delicate perception
has enabled the writer to avoid anything like the vain
repetitions or elaborated irrelevances of the fashionable
ultra-realists. It's the kind of book, in short, that makes
a jaded reviewer, freshened by the first twenty pages of
it, promptly write his “Ex libris" on the fly-leaf and
settle down to enjoy himself immensely. . . . But if Miss
DANE were interned for the rest of her natural life I should
guess that her friends and acquaintances would walk easier.
Her penetration, though not unkind, is uncanny, disquieting.
The best bit of work that's come my way for many a long
week. There must be a sequel, please, Miss DANE. It is
absurd to think I have seen the last of Laura Valentime.
Since DoRothea CoNYERs is bold enough to place The
Blighting of Bartram (METHUEN) in some happy time

may regard her story as yet another forecast of the post-
bellum condition of Ireland. It appears to be much as it
was in the beginning, or at least up till August, 1914.
Ugly little houses, full of dirt and inconvenience, will still
advertise themselves as “desirable hunting boxes”; there
will still be a vast quantity of muddled hospitality, more than
enough brandy-and-soda drunk in remote country houses,
some excellent sport after hounds, and an almost alarming
uantity of horse-talk. These at least are the constituents
of The Blighting of Bartram, which might more aptly
have been called his unblighting, since it was a heart
soured by rejection that first drove Bartram Marjorybanks
to bury himself in Cahervalley, and its gradual sweetening,
under the kindly influences of fresh air and friendship,
that forms the argument of the tale. You will hardly need
to be told with what a cheery and sympathetic zest the
author carries through the treatment.

the ultimate fate of Margot
Symes, a heroine so well drawn as to be both virtuous
and attractive at the same time. The intervention of the
equally lifelike Imogen Westbrook, “a hot-house flower with
some of the unpleasant beauty of the orchid about her,”
did not stir my indignation as it should have done, and the
scene in Derek Maitland's Indian bungalow, where Margot
was decoyed at dead of night, gave me no real thrill of any
sort. Indeed, Miss MARGARET PETERson herself dismisses
the last affair, in reality the turning-point of her story, as
a mere “social crime,” and appears to wonder, as I did,
why Uncle Tom Symes, the district judge, carried on about
it as he did. And yet here are all the makings of a stirring
romance, with a touch of the mysterious about it; conflict-
ing emotions, plausible misunderstandings, turbulent events.
The theme of self-sacrifice is developed in a manner not
open to adverse criticism; incidents follow in a sequence,
natural and dramatic enough; the style is quite sound and
there are no faults with the grammar; and yet I think
Miss PETERSON was not very closely interested herself, and
that is why she failed to enlist my sympathy in the destiny
of her characters, whether in the English family circle or
the wider life of India.

provincial existence for the strenuously unwholesome career
of an actress in a travelling company we know that she is
asking for trouble. But Miss Hall is a young person whose
ingenuousness is protected by a fund of pawky common-
sense and a restrained gift of humour, and she survives her
experiences at least sufficiently to be able to recount them
to us in the first person singular. Naturally Miss Hallam,
as she is now, falls in love with the leading man, and the
discovery that he is already burdened with wives in excess of
the legal ration causes no lasting estrangement, his tempera-
ment being such that a semi-platonic affection suffices the
needs of all parties concerned. For the rest Miss Hallam
has no particular difficulty in modifying her narrow and
censorious code of village morals to suit her new environ-
ment. That she should discard her village fiancé, an
impossible young prig, who asks her if she has grown
“less pure” because she suggests dining at a restau-

By blood and other local ties,
But oh, I ask you, was it wise?
Was it a happy thought to leave
Upon the Budget's punctual eve,
And waste your gifts of tooth and claw
Running amok against the law 2
The DEVLIN knows; but I, for one,
Deem that the thing was not well done.
For Irish hearts, if rumour's right,
Are volatile as air, and might
At any moment change their views
On Ireland's grievances and choose,
In lack of likelier heads to break,
To fight the Hun for fighting's sake;
Might even, while the mood is new,
By way of practice start on you—
You who deserted duty's post
When men of weight were needed most.

To waive the rights of Irish whiskey,
And in these parlous days of drought
To make no stand for Irish stout.

(Showing how they keep their spirits up

AN American aviator, recently cap-
tured on the Western Front, expressed
great surprise at hearing that he was
fighting against the Germans. He had
been informed that he was taking part in
a punitive expedition against the Mexi-
cans, and it was only on this under-
standing that he had consented to fight.
Had he known that America was at
war with Germany, he would have re-
nounced his citizenship rather than
take arms against a nation whose
Kultur he admires so immensely. He
expressed the opinion that, from what
he had seen of Germany since last
Tuesday, the Central Empires were
much better provided with foodstuffs
than either America or Great Britain.
The crew of a British tank captured
near St. Quentin say that it is impos-
sible to obtain any volunteers for the
Tank Corps now, and men will only
serve in it on condition that they have
six months' leave after every journey
which they make in the tank. They say
that everybody in England wants peace,
and that the War is only going on be-
cause certain manufacturers in Ber-
mondsey wish to capture the sausage
trade. They expressed the opinion
that, from what they had seen, there
was obviously plenty of food in Ger-
many, and that the country was in no
danger of starvation.
The English continue to sacrifice the
Australians and Canadians rather than
expose themselves to danger. In the
recent fighting a whole battalion of
Australians was exposed to the full
weight of the German onslaught, while
in another part of the line an English
division was resting in a safe position
many miles behind the Front. Austra-
lian prisoners recently captured had no
real knowledge as to why they were
fighting, but thought it was something
to do with President KRUGER. They
expressed the opinion that Germany
had never been in a more flourishing
condition than it was now, and that
the food obtainable in Berlin was
marvellously cheap at the price, and
much better than it used to be before
the War.
A French soldier, taken prisoner in
the recent fighting near Noyon, said
that everybody in France was tired of
the War, and that it was only owing
to the threats and bribes of the British
that they continued to fight. He was
plentifully supplied with food, and ex-
pressed the opinion that the Central
Powers could hold out much longer
than the Entente Countries.
An English soldier, recently captured,
expressed the opinion that from what he
could see of it the German nation was
in serious danger of suffering from over-
feeding. He said that the English
were tired of the War, and only con-
tinued to fight because of the bribes and
threats of the French. .
A Belgian soldier, captured last
Thursday, expressed the opinion that
the War would be over by Wednesday
week. He gave no reason for this
statement, beyond saying that from
what he had seen of Germany in the
last twenty-four hours the country was
amply provided with food for at least
another three years. -
The facts of the sinking of the
Spanish steamer San Sebastian have
now come to hand. It appears that
a torpedo belonging to His Imperial
Majesty the GERMAN EMPEROR was
proceeding in a southerly direction off
the coast of Spain, when it was de-
liberately rammed and sunk by the
San Sebastian. In the explosion which
resulted the San Sebastian, whose
movements all through had been very
suspicious, assumed the disguise of a
British submarine, contrary to Inter-
national Law, and submerged herself
without further warning. One of the
crew was picked up, and expressed
the opinion that the Central Empires
would undoubtedly win the war.
The recent naval engagement at
Zeebrugge gives some idea of the straits
to which the English have been 1 e.
duced by the destruction wrought
among their shipping by German
U-boats. It is now definitely esta-
blished that, owing to the lack of
merchant ships, the five Dreadnoughts
sunk by us at the entrance to the canal
were actually engaged at the time in
carrying cement to the British Army in
France, in order to strengthen the de-
fences there. A marine who was taken
prisoner on the Mole has confessed
that, from what he saw at that spot,
the food problem in Germany was by
no means so serious as had been sup-
osed. He was of opinion that the
War would be over by Friday.

“WELL,” I said, for his great honest
round brown face was looking very
disconsolate, “what's the matter?”

fore the Budget, but now I'm done

“Haven't you read BoNAR LAw's

“But there's not much difference
between a penny and a penny-half-

He was indignant. “Oh, isn't there!”
he said. “That's where you're wrong.
A penny is a penny—a great idea. A
single coin. You put your hand in
your pocket, pulled it out and it did
all kinds of wonderful things for you.
Once. To pull out two coins isn't the
same at all. The penny was a great
servant; but it's so no longer. “Penny

METEROLOGY.
CALLING on my friend Mayson to
drag him out to the allotments I found
him lying prostrate on a settee in his
study. Normally a cheerful, dapper
little man, his aspect was miserable,
his clothes were dusty and grimed, there
was a black mark on his chin and a red
scratch on his nose.
“Good heavens' you've been in an
accident 2 " I cried.
In reply Mayson handed me a brace of
letters. They were from his gas com-
pany and his electric light company;
they told him his maximum allowance
of heat and light; they warned him of
the consequences to himself should his
household exceed that allowance; they
advised him earnestly to take imme-
diate readings of his meters and to
repeat the precaution regularly.
“You will observe,” said Mayson
bitterly, “the cynical audacity with
which these letters imply that the
householder is a reckless consumer of
gas and electricity. Remember the
attitude of gas and electric light com-
panics before the War. My own gas
company was always circularising me
with reminders of how I could use
more gas. I ought to have gas fires in
my bedrooms; it was a reproach to me
that I had no cheery blaze in my hall.
As for the electric light company, it
never let me alone. I ought to make
toast with electricity at the breakfast
table, to curl my hair with electricity
in the bath-room, to light my cigars
with electricity and to keep myself cool
with an electric fan.
“Whenever, in the old days, I com-
plained of my gas or electric light bills,
the companies sent supercilious envoys
to tell me that I consumed only half as
much as any of my neighbours. Never
was one of those fellows known to enter
the house without conveying the accu-
sation that I was a niggard whose cus-
tom was not worth having. Have you
read your meters yet?”
“No, I can't say that I have. I don't
even know where they are.”
“Of course you don't,”he cried. “Gas
and electric light companies are not
such fools as to stick meters up in the

barometers, or against the dining-room
mantelpiece, where you could hear them
ticking like clocks. Meters are always
purposely hidden in the most inacces-
sible corners of the house, in places
where you can only find them by either
crawling or climbing. In nine homes
out of ten the only people who know

who come upon them when they pla

letters I went to read my meters. I
found the electric light meter crouching
in an obscure angle of a cupboard under
the stairs. No one ever guessed it was
there until this morning; we never use
the cupboard except to shut the cat in
it during air-raids. I had to crawl
in on my stomach, with a lighted candle
in one hand and a pencil and a piece
of paper in the other. The meter has
no fewer than five faces, or dials, or
whatever they call them. I took read-
ings of a sort from the dials, wrote
them down in that horrible position
and crawled out. Then I couldn't make
head or tail of my readings and had to
crawl in again; and I still do not under-
stand the rotten little dials. According
to my reading I have consumed over
a thousand units since Ladyday. If
that's right they won't fine me; they'll
shoot me in the chill dawn.
“Then when I could move my limbs
I went to read the gas-meter. I found
it perched up in a sort of bird's-nest
under the ceiling of the coal-cellar—
you know the coal-cellar of an up-to-
date house like this, a cubicle eight feet
long and three feet broad. A maid
brought the kitchen steps; there wasn't
room enough for the steps to be strutted
out. I climbed them and began to read
the meter; the steps collapsed and I
fell on the coal.”
Mayson rose, dusted himself, sur-
veyed himself in a mirror, removed his
black mark and tenderly dabbed the
scratch on his nose.
“I’ll tell you something I've dis-
covered, though,” he endoff morosely;
“it may interest you as a householder.
In addition to their five offensive little
faces your gas and electric light meters
each have another smaller face. If
you look at the instructions upon “How

hide behind the meters (why can't they
leave that in the hall, anyway?) it tells
you not to bother about the sixth little
face; it remarks that the sixth face is
only for the company's guidance. Shall

invention that tells gas and electric

ings of his meters. I'm saving my
strength for to-morrow.”

MALE relations with more garments
than they can wear out are assets in
these days. -
I have acquired, or perhaps inherited
by Salic Law, as it were, an under-
stood right of seizure over the cast-off
suits of my sister Mary's husband,
Arthur by name.
He is an outsize for length, and dis-
cards from his weakest suit as soon as
the least spot of grease, say, appears
on it and impairs its peach bloom ;
hence many a useful pair of culottes
has fallen to me, requiring but three
inches to be taken off each leg to be
ready for my installation.
A very choice thing in shepherd's
plaid came to hand in this way last
Friday, just as I was preparing for my
bi-weekly visit to town.
“These would have been the very
thing for to-morrow's bazaar,” I re-
marked to my sister Elsie. “Absolutely
without a blemish that ordinary mortal
could discover. I suppose you couldn't
cull the usual three inches off the legs,
could you, dear? Think how pleased
the Vicar would be.”
“It's a tailor's job.”
“The job was made for the tailor,”
I said, “not the tailor for the job, un-
fortunately, in these days. They're
all too busy trying to keep up with the
new development in Air Force uniforms
and other war-winning efforts. None
of them would promise to do a simple
thing like this under a week.”
I wandered into the kitchen, where
another sister, Marjorie, was weaving
a custard.
“I suppose you've noticed a pair of
shepherd's plaid trousers on a chair in
my room?” I said.
“Yes, very choice,” said Marjorie.
“Arthur's getting quite sporting in his
old age.”
“I suppose you couldn't dock the
usual——”
“No, indeed I couldn't,” Marjorie
interrupted. “I'm cooking all the morn.
ing, and I've a meeting in Wingbury
this afternoon.”
“Then I must wear these to-morrow,
whiskers and all, so that's that,” I said.
I was disappointed in my usually
helpful sisters, went to town in an
unhappy mood, and had a thoroughly
bad day's sport among my editors.
But Marjorie cheered me up when I
got home. “I've a surprise for you,"
she said.
“It's been a perfect day of 'em,” I
replied rather testily.
Then the truth dawned on me.
“Perfect flower of sisterhood,” I said,
“the bazaar will be a success' "
I rushed up and tried the trousers
on. As I sallied from my room I met
Elsie.
“I repented,” she said, “as soon as
you'd gone, and without saying a word
to anyone I—— Oh!”

to hear him that they filled the floor
and brimmed over into the
Galleries. Now when he has
increased his demand to 842
millions all the Nationalists
and a good many British
Members preferred to make
holiday.
As it was, the long list of
increased taxes met with little
protest. An increase of a shil-
ling in the income-tax and
super-tax was mitigated by
the announcement that in
future the small taxpayer
would be entitled to get a
rebate of twenty-five pounds
for a wife as for a child.
Lest the growing tendency
to bigamy should be encour-
aged by this concession the
CHANCELLOR made it clear
that it applies only to one
wife at a time.
We are to pay more for our letters,
our cheques, our sugar and our tobacco.
The duty on this last commodity is
now so high that the CHANCELLOR said
that “in importing tobacco we are
almost importing money.” The report
that in order to save tonnage he him-
self now fills his favourite briar with
Treasury Notes soaked in nicotine so
far lacks confirmation.
Members made full use of their oppor-
tunity to advertise their own financial
fads, but as they rarely agreed with one
another little effect was produced. The
Luxury Tax of twopence in the shilling
was generally approved, and Mr. BonAR
LAw's astuteness in leaving to a Select
Committee the invidious task of decid-
ing what is a luxury was much admired.
The oddest statement in the debate
came from Mr. J. H. THOMAs, who
declared that nothing was more likely
to discourage our soldiers than the
knowledge that whilst they were fight-
ing we at home were piling up a debt
of which they on their return would
have to bear the burden. Mr. THoMAs
has visited the Front and ought to
know; but this is the first time I have
ever heard it suggested that our brave
defenders in Flanders are losing their
sleep for thinking of the ever-growing
National Debt.

Wednesday, April 24th.--
The word Ottoman still sug-
gests a rather pleasant languor.
From Lord NEWTON's racy
account of his negotiations
with the Turkish envoys over
the exchange of prisoners
we gathered that they were
charming fellows, ready to
talk about anything but the
business in hand, and par-
ticularly about a mysterious ailment
called the “barbed wire disease,” sup-
posed to be rampant in British intern-
ment camps. But they had only the
vaguest notions of the number of their
British prisoners and showed no desire
to part with them. At last an agree-
ment was reached, but it took four
months to ratify, instead of a few hours,
and how much longer we shall have to
wait before it is actually carried out
no wise man will venture to prophesy.
To have a reputation as a humourist
is often embarrassing. Major HUNT
was doubtless quite serious in asking
whether the efficiency of the War Cabi-
net might not be improved by including
in it one or two persons with a practical
- knowledge of war. But Mr. BonAR LAw
said that was “a difficult conundrum,”

Personally, I thought it much more
amusing to learn that among the 1,800
high-mettled racers who are allowed to
consume 13 lbs. of oats a head every
day—solely, as we have been assured, in
order that the breed of horses may be
maintained—no fewer than 228 are
geldings.
It was a bad day for those persons,
whether landlords or tradesmen, who
have been taking advantage of the War
to feather their own nests. The former

affluent Gothaphobes; while, under the
Food Profits Bill, tradesmen will no
longer be able to extort thousands of
pounds from their customers in the com-
fortable knowledge that at the worst
they could not be fined more than a
hundred pounds.
Thursday, April 25th.-Mr. Hogg|E
is, of course, an adept in putting ques-
tions to which no answer is desirable or
perhaps desired. A propos of a consci-
entious objector who had been ordered
to find work fifty miles away from his
home, he inquired sententiously, “What
difference does geographical distance
make to a conscience?" But no one
made the obvious reply that as “absence
makes the heart grow fonder” it may
have a similar effect upon the con-
science.
It is not easy to reconcile Ministerial
utterances regarding the recent German
“push.” At Question-time Mr. MAC-
PHERSON, in explanation of the despatch
of young soldiers to the Front, said,
“This crisis came on like a thief in the
night.” A little later Mr. CHURCHILL,
in describing the wonderful work of the
Ministry of Munitions in making good
the losses of material, observed that the
German offensive had opened a month
later than we had calculated, and con-
sequently our reserves were correspond-
ingly larger than they would have
been.
The lost guns, tanks and aeroplanes
had all been more than replaced; the
stores of ammunition had been com-
pletely replenished; and at the same
time munition workers had been re-
leased for the Army at the rate of a
thousand a day. These results were
largely due to the wonderful work of
the women, who turred out innumer-
able shells of almost incredible quality.
On the question of cost Mr. CHUR-
chill, while reminding the House that
“no accounting, however strict, would
be any substitute for vigorous action
in the field,” made a stout defence of
his Department. Earlier in the sit-
ting Sir WoRTHINGTON Evans had ex-
cited derisive laughter by his remark
that “the Ministry of Munitions cannot
give away public funds,” but he now
elaborated that daring postulate with
many striking facts and figures, and
confirmed the favourable impressions
made by his chief.

It is little enough that we who live at home in safety can do to
compare with the sacrifice made by those who have given their lives
for their country. But we can at least give of our dearest treasures;
and Mr. Punch earnestly appeals to the women of the United Kingdom,
the Dominions and India to offer their pearls to be set in the necklaces that
are to be sold for the funds of the Red Cross Society. Their Majesties
the Queen and Queen Alexandra and H.R.H. Princess Victoria have
each set a gracious example by the presentation of a pearl in aid of our
wounded. A string of pearls from which one is taken for such a service
will gain in worth and lustre by the sentiment of sacrifice in a great
cause. Many women have given their pearls in honour of husbands,
fathers, sons or brothers who are fighting or have fallen in our defence,
or as a tribute to the gallantry of individual regiments. Gifts should be
addressed to “The Red Cross Pearl Necklace,” to the care of one of the

at their own inane jokes. But about
their jokes there appeared to be a forced
element and about their laughter there
was a hollow mirthless ring . . .”
We cannot remember who mudged
whose ribs, Charles, but we admit to a
certain amount of gaiety at one par-
ticular moment. It was by way of
relief after about a week of tension,
and you will bear in mind in our de-
fence that we had been labouring under
the impression that there was no British
Army left, except a few of those in the
rear, who were now floating about in
the sea. Our first intimation of any-
thing to the contrary was an official
communication to myself from my old
H.Q. It was marked “Urgent” and
an immediate answer in writing was
required. It stated clearly and unmis-
takably the serious difficulty which was
†. the attention of our Staff.
The bicycle motor, Douglas, which had
been taken over by me in happier times,
bore the number 73737; the bicycle
motor, Douglas, handed over to my suc-
|cessor, bore the number 73757. Until
this matter was righted the condition
of the B.E.F. could not be regarded as
satisfactory.
This communiqué was dated April 1st.
Had intercourse with the enemy not
been forbidden, I should have certainly
passed it to Herr von Schmidt, marked:
“For you, please, as I understand that
the B.E.F. and Douglas are now on
your charge.” Yours ever,

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(The GERMAN Crow'N PRINCE and a German-Irish Expert.)
The Crown Prince. Do you know, my fine fellow, that I
am pretty nearly fed up with all this Irish teaching that I
am going through 2
The Expert. Your Royal Highness will come to it in
time; and it must be remembered, moreover, that I am
acting as your teacher only on the express orders of your
All-Highest Father and Emperor, whom may God have in
His keeping.
The C. P. That is what you are always telling me.
The E. It does not become any the less true by being
repeated. It is the wish of His Imperial Graciousness that
you should be ready at a moment's notice to take your
place as Viceroy of Ireland, and for that purpose His
Majesty desires that you should be steeped in the Irish
manner of thinking, speaking and acting, so that you may
be acceptable in the eyes of your subjects. I am the man
whom His Majesty has selected to instil Irish lessons of
all sorts into you, so that in obeying me you obey your
glorious Father, and give an example of submission which
is very necessary in these days. Shall we proceed?
The C. P. All right! All right! Have it your own way,
but please cut it as short as you can. -
The E. When we were interrupted I was endeavouring
to explain to Your Highness the true nature of what is
known as an Irish bull. Generally speaking, the Irish bull
does not involve any reference to an actual bull, that is to
say, to the kind with horns on his head and four legs
of the usual description. It is the combination of two
manifestly incongruous ideas which yet have a certain
measure of congruity, as when one would say, “There is a
fire raging; we will stamp it out by directing water upon
it.” Does your Royal Highness follow me?
The C. P. Not only do I follow you, but I also precede you.
The E. Bravo, Your Royal Highness, bravo! You have
yourself composed a most brilliant bull.
The C. P. Sometimes, when I am in the humour, I can
compose quite a lot of such things. At Verdun, for instance,
I used to do two or three a day.
The E. It is wonderful to think that in the midst of your
glorious victories Your Highness could find time for such
strokes of wit, which show that we are not the brutal bar-
barians imagined by our enemies, but that we have time
for the higher things of the intellect. Civilization must
profit by such an example.
The C. P. Let us now proceed to the next subject.
The E. The next subject, Your Highness, is the use of
the expression, “Bejabers.” Colloquially this expression
is of the utmost importance. It is composed of the Gaelic
root “bej,” meaning “passionate,” and “abers,” meaning
“trees”; so that when an Irishman says “Bejabers” he
is unconsciously indicating that he is equivalent to two or
more passionate trees, the implication being that, unless his
wishes are attended to, he will allow himself to become a
passionate forest, in other words that he will be passionate
many times over, and will refuse to be responsible for the
consequences.
The C. P. Really that is very interesting. Is it invented
by yourself?
The E. Not entirely, Your Highness. Professor Grund.
schläger claims a share in the discovery, but I may say
with truth that I invented the greater portion of it entirely
without aid from anybody.
The C. P. Let us call in one of the Irish prisoners and
ask him what he means when he uses the expression
“Bejabers.”
the thick-skulled fellow denied that he ever used such an
expression or knew what it meant.
The C. P. Is there anything further to-day ?
The E. I had thought of taking Your Highness through
a short excursus on the expressions “Arrah” and “Faix."
But Your Highness has made such brilliant progress this
morning that we may permit ourselves to postpone these
and other matters until to-morrow. Only a little more work
and Your Highness will be a complete Irish scholar.
The C. P. Yes, I already feel bulls growing all over me,
and could say “Bejabers” forward or backward with the
greatest ease.
The E.. I will report accordingly to Your Highness's
most gracious Father.
NIRVANA.
THIS tale of one named Peter Smiler Smee
(Not by his godpapas, but just by me)—
This tale, this idyll, lighted up the course
Of my official labours, and perforce—
Rather to charm a chuckle than compel it—
Pushed by the god of Gentle Japes, I tell it.
Oh, Smiler Smee he served at sea, he served at the doors
of hell,
At the stokehold doors where the white heat roars with a
strong grilled-stoker smell,
And Smee, as he swinked in the sweltering hive with the
dews of his anguish pouring,
Said, “If ever I get out of this alive it's me for a job cold-
storing !
“Ah, me pals may bawl for a ice-cream stall or a bathin'-
machine-man's job,
An' there's some that's yellin' for grotters to dwell in,
with lilies around their nob;
But my idea of a flowery path, my notion o' dissipation,
Is a sort of an anti-Turkish bath, which they calls refrigera-
tion.
“I shall spend me days in a dreamy laze, with chilblains
blessin' me toes,
With a icicled brow where the sweat blooms now, among
butter an' meat 'ard froze;
I shall end me days with a Jack Frost 'ead at a real ole
reggiler 'oar age—
O Lord, be good to a bloke 'arf dead an' put me in cool cold
storage ' "
To travel hopefully, said R. L. S.,
Is better than to arrive. Not so, I guess,
With Peter Smee ; nor him for whom, when starved
On swinish husks, the fatted calf is carved;
Nor him who from the bottom of a queue,
Waiting for Cheddar since the evening's dew,
Achieves it after dawn; but none there be
Who e'er attain like Peter Smiler Smee.
To whom indeed the Lord was good. For lo!
Filed mid the ice-men of a Cold Store Co.,
Under the name which his godfathers gave, he
Proclaims his past: “Stoker–discharged from

HOW SPLENDID ! TELL ME WHO DID IT FOR YOU."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Miss E. M. DELAFIELD, from whose former book, Zella
Sees Herself, I snatched an almost fearful joy, has now
turned the searchlight of her observation upon another
subject—I had nearly said another victim. The War-
Workers (HEINEMANN) is, like Zella, a brilliantly satirical
study of a type—here the energetic and successful worker
who becomes, if I may permit myself to say it, intoxicated
with efficiency. This was precisely the case of Char. Vivian,
Director of the Midland Supply Depôt ; and as you read
of her devastating activities, her methods of routine,
and the sacrifice to duty that reduces all in contact with
her to a condition of self-accusing wonder, your mind will
no doubt supply a dozen possible originals for the portrait.
Compared with the too-energetic Miss Vivian, the rest of
the cast, mostly underlings from her hostel, are of relative
unimportance, though the varied characters of the girls are
excellently suggested. The great interest of the book is
found in the spectacle of Charmian, confronted with that
most bitter of all unpalatable truths—that no one is indis-
pensable. Altogether, the Director of the Midland Supply
Depôt, whether in her official capacity welcoming and even
unconsciously making work in order to enjoy the pride of
mastering it, or as the rebellious daughter of a mother who
laughs at her with an exasperated understanding, is an
altogether human figure, well worthy to rank with Miss
DELAFIELD's earlier case. I confess to some curiosity over
the next work of this clever lady. There must, I imagine,
be a lively competition amongst certain feminine types to
hope that the next victim will provide analysis as enter-
taining as that of her two predecessors.
If my memory serves me, the first occasion on which I
had the pleasure of seeing Miss GENEVIEve WARD upon the
stage was as Margaret of Anjou in the Lyceum Richard III.
This seems already a great while ago; but I notice that the
record of the event (I mean, of course, the performance, not
my personal assistance thereat) comes well into the latter
half of the considerable volume called Both Sides of the
Curtain (CASSELL), in which this clever and fortunately
still active lady has set down her recollections. Naturally
the book covers a long period of stage history, as it follows
the progress of its heroine from grand opera in the fifties to
her latest memorable performance of the old Duchess in
The Aristocrat. Fate has given a sad interest to these
final pages, since it is natural that Miss WARD should have
much to say about the manager and kindly friend whose
request brought her back to the stage at the St. James's
Theatre. Elsewhere you will find a host of anecdotes, the
gleanings of a long, strenuous and varied life. For one of
the strangest of these, the story of her romantic marriage,
we have the aid of Miss WARD's lifelong friend, RICHARD
WHITEING. There is neither space nor need to follow in
any detail a record that all lovers of the drama will cer-
tainly read for themselves. Its most sensational chapter is
perhaps that which relates the amazing fortunes of the play
Forget-me-not (“not exactly a perfect piece” is Mr. WHITE-
ING's surely very charitable verdict upon it), over which
London and America poured out what seems to-day the
singularly simple enthusiasm of the early eighties. I should

escape an almost uncannily penetrating eye. I can only
add that this very well turned-out volume is illustrated

It is a pity that MARGUERITE BRYANT, in The Shadow on
the Stone (METHUEN), couldn't manage to be a little more
definite as to what Niel Meredith, the man with the won-
derful eyes, wanted to do on the island of Mora with his
settlement and his formidably named International Society
for the Promotion of Racial Advance. A pity, because the
book is informed by a real sincerity and generosity of out-

we're going to hear all about it,” she floated away on a tide
of the very vaguest generalities. ... However Farr, the

going under. A copy should be sent to General von

deductions. Captain WILLIAMs treats his subject in an
orderly manner and has evidently had access to official
records and figures. It will always be good to remember
that five million men were with the colours before the
passing of the Conscription Act, a measure which—so the
author judges on the evidence—would not have been wisely
advocated at any earlier stage. He lets the public behind
the scenes to understand the scheme of Army organisation
and see the processes of training in a way that has not
been done before, nor has there been before presented such
a detailed story of the famous tanks. I surmise this book
to be an apologia for the War Office. And I fancy that,
like a discreet advocate, Captain WILLIAMs admits a few
light errors, omissions and strokes of bad luck that he may
steer his critics the more easily from seriously debatable
ground.

then after a few hours' ecstasy discovered that Kathleen

[MAY 8, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS FROM THE HOME FRONT.
May 4th, 1918.
MY DEAR REGINALD,--I was a little
surprised, though I endeavoured not to
be pained, at the total omission, in your
last letter from the Western I'ront, of
all reference to the new Luxury Tax. I
trust I make due allowance for what
I may call your local preoccupations;
but I am more than ever convinced
that our failures in the past have been
largely attributable to a narrowness of
outlook which allowed us to study the
interests of a particular sector of the
line to the neglect of the Front as a
whole. I have no doubt that the Tax
to which I have referred has not escaped
the attention of General Foch, but I
had hoped that the effect of his appoint-
ment as Co-ordinator of Strategy would
have penetrated more appreciably into
all branches of the Service. In this
hope I have been disappointed, and it is
rather for your benefit than for my own
satisfaction that I now propose to give
you one or two examples of the fresh
strain that is about to be put upon the
fighting spirit of the Home Front.
I have long envied you the relative
simplicity of your wardrobe, which re-
lieves you every morning of the anxiety
attendant upon the choice of garments
to be worn for the day. Indeed I under-
stand that the same limitations apply
to your night-wear; that not infre-
quently you are content to sleep in the
very clothes that you have worn dur-
ing the daytime. It may therefore be
difficult for you to appreciate the posi-
tion of those, like myself, who live
in residential chambers and are some-
times compelled to exhibit themselves
in their sleeping apparel in the public
basement, the resort of both sexes dur-
ing a nocturnal air-raid. The new tax
which menaces the higher grades of
silk pyjamas and flowered dressing-
gowns will bear very hardly upon such.
Again, I view with diffidence the
rumoured intention of the Luxury Tax
Committee to extort revenue from the
sale of golf balls. This I regard as a
grave error of judgment. I suppose that
nothing has disheartened the enemy
more than the high spirit with which
so many of our best golf-clubs have car-
ried on, showing a fine contempt for the
existence of warlike conditions. And,
to envisage the matter from the point
of view of national health and moral, I
can conceive of nothing more beneficial
to the tired war-worker than to spend
his afternoons—if only some three or
four times a week—on some suburban
course, or a Friday to Tuesday week-
end further afield.
Large numbers of my friends have
in preference to joining the Volunteers,
and they assure me that in the demands
it makes upon quickness of eye, resource-
fulness, courage, self-restraint and other
soldierly qualities, golf is a true image
of life in the trenches. They are con-
fident that the experience they have
gained on the golf course, especially in
bunkers, will stand them in good stead
when called upon to join the colours
under the new Military Service Act.
I consider, therefore, that it is most
unwise to treat as a luxury what is
so essential to the development of the
manlier virtues.
There is talk, too, of imposing a con-
tribution upon cameras, one of the most
important industries with which Society
is concerned. If this should cause a
falling-off in the use of these admirable
instruments it will be a sad blow to
those who do good service by making
the faces and gestures of our upper
classes better known to the public. For
the masses cannot always find time to
walk in the park or attend race-meetings
in support of the maintenance of our
thoroughbreds. I fear also that such
an impost, should it curtail the enter-
prise of our photographers, might tend
to discourage among our social leaders
the more refined forms of war-work.
I have returned to this subject, dis-
cussed in a previous letter, because I
feel very strongly about it. ...}
as I disapprove of self-advertisement,
have always held the view that if any
woman of social position—preferably
one who is connected, however re-
motely, with our nobility, old or new
—is engaged in assisting at charity
matineés, visiting convalescent officers
or serving in a popular canteen, she
ought not in this democratic age to be
suffered through false modesty to hide
her light, so to speak, under a bushel.
I very greatly fear that the discourage-
ment already offered to our photo-
graphic Press by the notorious reluct-
ance of the smarter type of war-worker
to appear in its pages may now be
perceptibly increased by the proposed
treatment of cameras as a luxury rather
than a necessity.
But I have perhaps spoken enough
of the heavy calls that seem likely to
be made upon us here on the Home
Front. You will not imagine that we
allow them to distract our attention
altogether from other sections of the
fighting line. I understand that you
are once more engaged in the defence
of Arras. I take a personal interest
in Arras. I can hardly expect you to
share it, as you have never seen the
place in its original beauty, and there-
fore it cannot affect you with the same
sentiment of association which I feel
while on a tour through France during
the long vacation of my Freshman's
year at Oxford. Still, I hope you will
do your best to keep it out of the
enemy's hands, if only for my sake.
Your affectionate Guardian,
O. S.
THE TIDE.
To THE ROYAL NAVAL DIVISION.
THIS is a last year's map;
I know it all so well,
Stream and gully and trench and sap,
Hamel and all that hell;
See where the old lines wind;
It seems but yesterday
We left them many a league behind
And put the map away.
“Never again,” we said, * -
“Shall we sit in the Kentish Caves;
Never again will the night-mules tread
Over the Beaucourt graves;
They shall have Peace,” we dreamed—
“Peace and the quiet sun,”
And over the hills the French folk
streamed
To live in the land we won.
But the Bosch has Beaucourt now ;
It is all as it used to be—
Airmen peppering Thiepval brow,
Death at the Danger Tree;
The tired men bring their tools
And dig in the old holes there;
The great shells spout in the Ancre
pools,
The lights go up from Serre.
And the regiment came, they say,
Back to the selfsame land
And fought like men in the same old
way.
Where the cookers used to stand;
And I know not what they thought
As they passed the Puisieux Road,
And over the ground where FREYBERG
fought
The tide of the grey men flowed.
But I think they did not grieve,
Though they left by the old Bosch
line
Many a cross they loathed to leave,
Many a mate of mine;
I know that their eyes were brave,
I know that their lips were stern,
For these went back at the seventh
wave, -
But they wait for the tide to turn.

I could not but admire the place, but
more than once I was conscious of a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ALPHONSE.
THE exigencies of war have deprived
me of much, but until Alphonse dis-
appeared I felt that no sacrifice was
too great if the cause were in any way
served. Since my youth he had prac-
tised his artistry on my diminishing
hairs. His scissors would slip smoothly,
almost mesmerically, about my head
while he whispered to me the minor
scandals of Bond Street. Alphonse was
no ordinary barber . . . and he disap-
peared. I very nearly became a pacifist.
I cannot tell you exactly how I came
to visit M (no tortures would drag
the name from me), but it is sufficient
that I did go there. This particular
corner of England is so deeply at peace
and so remote from all strife that in it
one gains a sense of quiet security
even from the longest tentacle of war.
It was there on one stupendous Spring
morning that I, sleepy with the sun-
shine, leant upon a moss-grained gate
and gazed at some ancient farm-build-
ings—bright straw, weather-stained
tiles and deep chrome walls. Near by,
in an emerald green meadow, a man
was shearing chrome sheep. There
was nowhere in all that landscape a
sign of new bricks, raw paint, corru-
gated iron or patent wire fencing. Even
the hurdles forming the sheep-pen were
of the old hand-fashioned variety, and
from the pieces of ash-bark still cling-
ing to the unplaned bars I knew they
had been made in the spinney behind
the farm. I felt that everything there
had been for all time just as I saw it.
I turned my gaze to the sheep-shearer
and wondered for how many centuries
his shepherd forefathers had shorn their
flocks in that same meadow. I walked
over to where he was at work. He
wielded his shears dexterously and his
black beard bobbed up and down in
rhythm with his hands. A Celt, I
thought, or perhaps the descendant of
some dark-haired Phoenician of old.
He flourished his shears, and the
manner of it struck a familiar note in
my memory. Presently he finished
shearing, smoothed his hands over the
shorn body, leaned back from his work
and watched the ewe scramble to her
feet, naked and indignant. Then with
a little un-English sigh he looked up
at me. His eyes became round with
amazement.
“MI'sieu !” he gasped, “what sur-
prise! I am so astonish I cannot spek.”
Had the lately-shorn sheep addressed
me I should hardly have been more
astounded, but eventually, having made
allowances for a beard and a full smock,
I recognised Alphonse.
I was mute. I smoothed away a stray
“What are you doing here 2 " I at
length asked.
Alphonse stood up, shrugged his
shoulders at my inanity and with the
shears indicated the sheep.
“I give them 'air-cut–army 'air-
cut,” he beamed at me.
I inquired how long he had been a
shepherd. - -
“I am not ze ship'erd,” he replied.
“Tree munt ago I volunteer for Na-
tionale Service. I am ze farm-'and.”
“You take on anything that comes
along?" I suggested.
“JIais mon, M'sieu ! I’ave 'ad some.”
Alphonse has a particularly wide know-
ledge of the English idiom. “When
I first come,” he explained, “Mistar
Farmer Brune say what can I do? and
I say, ‘Everysing,' so I milk ze cow
wiz ole Jean, but ver little milk come,
and Madam put her 'oof in ze pail, and
ole Jean say I tickle 'er, and Mistar
Farmer Brune say “Damn,' so next
day I go out wizze plough. 'Ave you

I shook my head.
“Well, ze plough is not ver easy. I
go up and down, up and down, and
presently ze field look like a beauti-
ful 'air wave. I was entrance.
Mistar Farmer Brune come along and
say what 'e think about it. I 'ad what

“So now I 'ave to do all ze cutting.

and last wik I dress Madamo Brune's

great sensation. I do 'im a la Pompa-
dour. But you understand I am farm-
'and.” Alphonse shrugged a shoulder
and smiled as one who, though swept
by the tides of Fate, had remained in-
violate.
Should you by some freak of fortune
chance upon the remote village of
M (I shall never divulge the name),
and should it happen upon the first
Monday of the month, you might, if
further favoured, see me in a sunny
corner of the rick-yard, comfortably
seated in one of Farmer Brown's best
chairs, while, bending over me with
unstudied grace and scissors scintillat-
ing, is the incomparable Alphonse,
whispering discreetly the small scan-
dals of the Home Farm.
Contempt of Court P
From a police-court report:-
“THE PASSING OF ARTHUR.”
BEFore the War he had been a
schoolmaster. He hopes to be one
again when the War is over. But after
three years in the A.S.C. he began to
feel uneasy about the state of his mind.
A friend suggested a bracing course of
Mnemonics. Not being a General, still
less an Admiral, he felt this to be above
him, so he ordered a TENNYSox.
It arrived on a Tuesday. On the
Wednesday morning he was evacuated
as a shell-shock case, chiefly on the
evidence of O.C. Signals, to whom he
had sent this wire for transmission:
“To Town-Major Avilion. Herewith
Arthur passed to you please aaa.” But
the really damning evidence as to his
deplorable condition was furnished by
the following document subsequently
discovered on his desk:—
[Candidates must write on one side of
the paper only and submit their answers

1. “Then rose the King and moved his host
by night.”
Reference above, explain what mea-
sures this move would necessitate on

3. “The old order changeth, yielding place

What is the average life of (a) a
General Routine Order, (b) a Divis-
ional Routine Order on the subject of
Dripping?
4. “. . . King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the
Lake.
Nine years she wrought it. . . .”
Sketch an imaginary correspondence
(expurgated) between O.C. Round Table
and D.A.D.O.S. Camelot with reference
to the delay in the delivery of Excalibur.
5. “Then murmured Arthur, “I’lace me in
the barge.’”
What steps should he have taken
to obtain the sanction of the Deputy
Director of Inland Water Transport?
6. “. . . the island valley of Avilion,
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies

Richard. You promised to tell us
more about the animals which infested
England in this period.
Mrs. M. I told you something about
what were then known as the elusive
rabbit and the priceless pig, but may add
a few more details. Cows were already
rapidly becoming extinct, owing to the
discovery of synthetic milk. A large
number of monkeys were imported into
the country by itinerant musicians of
foreign extraction ; but the rigour of
our climate proved detrimental to their
health and, though provided with suit-
able clothing, they frequently suc-
cumbed to pneumonia and similar com-
plaints.
George. But I thought you told us
that foreign musicians had become un-
popular.
Mrs. MI. True, my dear boy, but it was
very difficult to distinguish foreigners
from natives in these times, owing
to the mutual interchange of names.
Natives, generally from the large towns,
passed themselves off as Savoyards and
disguised themselves by speaking broken
English. On the other hand, undesirable
aliens, as they were called, frequently
assumed English names by the process

land the prefix Mac entirely ceased to
be a proof of Scots origin, and was
nearly always traceable to the German
Max. -
Mary. But why did the musicians
import monkeys 2
Mrs. M. That is certainly puzzling.
It cannot have been as an article of food,
for they were generally of small size,
and their flesh is not specially pleas-
ing to the taste. I can only surmise
that there must have been some instinc-
tive sympathy between musicians and
monkeys, or that monkeys by their
quaint appearance and tricks distracted
the attention of the audience from the
imperfections of the instruments em-
ployed. The dancing bears which had
been a common feature in these islands
at an earlier date had died out. Their
extinction was partly due to the grow-
|ing refinement of taste which followed
the introduction of Rag-time measures,
and partly to the insurmountable diffi-
culties which the bears experienced in
adapting themselves to this syncopated
in usic.
Ičichard. What sort of instruments
were these that you speak of 2
Mrs. M. Originally they were called
hurdy-gurdies, which made a noise
like a bad harmonium. These were
chanical substitutes for the pianoforte,
a keyed instrument played with the
fingers. Pianofortes have long been
extinct, but they lasted on for a con-
siderable time as articles of furniture.
Indeed, in the period which we are now
discussing, two pianofortes might often
be seen in the house of a working-man,
not to be played on, but as ornamental
adjuncts to the more practical equip-
ment of the household.
An Old Sport Revived.
From GILBERT WHITE's Natural His-
tory of Selborne :-
“Some young men went down to a pond
on the verge of Wolmer Forest to hunt
flappers . . . Several of which they caught.”
Nowadays, the rôles are reversed, and
the flappers do the hunting.

The Report stage of the Budget
resolutions gave occasion for many
criticisms of the Government proposals.
But, like the insects in the famous story,
the critics did not pull together, and
they were easily dealt with by the

BALDw1N's ingenuity in explaining that
the heavier sugar-tax was more than
counterbalanced by the allowance for a

his Chief's comprehensive defence of

will mean larger revenue for the Ex-
chequer, increased profits for the manu-
facturers, and more matches for the con-
Sumer. Even Mr. PRINGLE was molli-

recognising that for that sum he could
get not one stud merely but a whole
set, promptly accepted the proposal,
and Mr. KING was left lamenting his
hasty generosity.

good idea to develop a conscience and

The Report stage of the Budget
resolutions gave occasion for many
criticisms of the Government proposals.
But, like the insects in the famous story,
the critics did not pull together, and
they were easily dealt with by the
CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer and

BALDw1N's ingenuity in explaining that
the heavier sugar-tax was more than
counterbalanced by the allowance for a

his Chief's comprehensive defence of
the increased duty on matches, which
will mean larger revenue for the Ex-
chequer, increased profits for the manu-
facturers, and more matches for the con-
sumer. Even Mr. PRINGLE was molli-

new matches would really light.

recognising that for that sum he could
get not one stud merely but a whole

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“ UNCLE ANYHow.”
IN Uncle Anyhow Mr. SUTRo designs
the wholesome sentimental comedy.
Ingredients: two daughters of a very
poor and proud and (if you ask me)
highly improbable inventor of aero-
planes; Ermyntrude (help!) is in the
chorus, “second row, fourth from the
end,” for sake of two-pound-ten a week,
not for love of the thing, “well able to
take care of herself” and keep at arm's
length impulsive impresarios and man-
agers (“Rude Myn,” they called her
in the chorus with their ready wit) and
shepherd her motherless lamb of a
little sister; brainless but very decent
young sportsman (who was after the
lamb); his craven father under thumb
of his entirely odious wife, who, dis-
approving of both chorus and poverty,
forbids the banns; and a retired don,
very ugly, odd and middle-aged, ex-tutor
to the young sportsman, who with his
irreverent fellows dubbed him Uncle
Anyhow at Oxford.
The two nicknamed characters are
the centre of Mr. SUTRo's (shall I say?)
tactful little romance, and he has spent
some pains upon them. Uncle Anyhow
drifts back and forth, desperately shy
and out of place (in the author's inten-
tion), never having seen a pink stocking
(there were, of course, none in Oxford in
1914), helping the young lovers, him-
self making love to “Rude Myn" under
a barrage of whimsical lectures on
natural history and detached observa-
tions on life, sending five-pound notes
at critical moments (as when papa
broke open the cash-box—with a chisel
too—and borrowed from the rent hoard
eight sovereigns to pay for his aeroplane
model), and generally comporting him-
self like an old dear. And there is “Rude
Myn,” impish, motherly, appallingly
candid, full of grit and lovableness.
Now, if you share my respect for
Mr. DENNIs EADIE's skill, you can well
imagine him building up the character
of some odd, elderly, untidy, shy, ultra-
donnish, gradually humanised person
(as per author's schedule) with sub-
tlety and conviction. But, alas, for
some reason which I am absolutely
unable to fathom, Mr. EADIE appeared
well-preserved, well-groomed, for the
most part imperturbably at ease and
quite good-looking. There is no point
in Mr. SUTRo's hero if he is as present-
able as Mr. EADIE. Can it be that this
artist has joined the sartorial school
of acting and daren't face a matinée
audience with baggy knees or an arti-
ficially unsymmetrical nose and ruffled
hair? Surely it should be quite obvious
to him that this queer, lapse of his
players, with their constant references
to his age and eccentricity. I do seri-
ously ask him to alter all this, for it is
an important matter of principle going
deeper than the merits and chances of
this particular comedy.
Miss ATHENE SEYLER made an en-
tirely charming figure of “Rude Myn.”
This attractive character, with more
stuff to it than is ordinarily served to
comedy heroines, gave her versatility
and vivacity a good chance, which she
took quite brilliantly. Her quiet un-
stressed playing in the rather dull open-
ing (and this dulness offered a tempta-
tion to let go too soon) led artistically
to the emotional and lively passages as
Hazelt Cº.

the character unfolded itself. This
actress plays with her head, taking
risks, I admit, but I hope she will go
on doing so. I don't think she quite
conveyed to us the gradual dawning of
her love, but (to be fair), looking back,
I don't see that Mr. SUTRO allowed her
much opportunity. -
Mr. FEw LAss LLEWELLYN gave a
quite delightful little study of a com-
mercially-minded toy - manufacturer
with a (self-assisted) sense of humour.
Mr. DAwson MILwARD as the husband
henpecked to the point of abjectness
saved, by the most skilful and restrained
handling, a character that might easily
have been made unpleasantly impos-
sible.
Mr. RANDLE AYRTON, I am afraid, is
developing an incurable tendency to
over-act, and his disgruntled inventor
of aeroplanes positively swallowed the
ends of his words in the vehemence of
that it throws him out of the perspective
of the whole and mars the pleasure
which a considerable talent should give.
I liked Miss ENID TREvoB's Eliza Jane
very much; and Miss Rosa SULLIVAN did
an inconceivably cattish snob of a step-
mother with a really fine tact. Miss
LILA MARAVAN will realise that the
author has, for reasons of his own,
overshadowed her part with that of her
rude sister, and that makes it diſlicult
for her. Her name is new to me, and
her work seems of good promise. T.
PROTEST DE LUXE.
(the League of Protest Against Luxury
Taxes) was held in Taxton Hall, West-
minster, last night, when a represen-
|tative company of luxurious people
passed a number of resolutions against
what was happily described as “tor-
pedo legislation.”
In his opening remarks the Chair-
man said that they were to exert all
the vigilance of which they were cap-
able to prevent the new Luxury Tax
falling upon the wrong articles. (Loud
cheers.) Confidence in the Govern-
ment, collectively and individually, hav.
ing long ceased to exist, they could
approach the subject with a candour
not always possible. (Hear, hear.)
Fveryone there, he imagined, was suffi-
ciently patriotic and desirous of winning
the War to offer no objection to taxa-
tion where it was right and proper;
but what they were met to resist was
taxation that was wrong and improper.
(Loud cheers.) Take, for example, rac-
ing. There was a sinister rumour that
some kind of new revenue was to be
exacted from the tired war-workers who
found their relaxation and an outlet
for their spare cash on the racecourse.
Fortunately they had with them that
evening Sir Tailupp Stout (loud cheers),
who would tell them why this must be
resisted tooth and nail. He would not
detain them further but call on Sir
Tailupp to address the meeting.
Sir Tailupp Stout, on behalf of the
Jockey Club, moved that the strongest
possible representation be made to the
CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer to
refrain from putting a luxury tax on
race-horses and racing. Racing was
an essential to the country, especially
during war. It was perhaps true that
trials of speed could be made in private
and thus effect the only purpose for
which the sport notoriously existed;
but was that the British way 2 (Loud
negations.) Were we to be as hole-and-
corner as that? (Renewed protests.)
And more, would it be fair to the
horses? (Sensation.) The horses' feel-
ings must be considered too. (Hear,

hear.) The horse was a noble animal,
his passion. I feel sure he must see

unaccustomed to race in private. No,
not only should racing go on, but it
must be treated in a lenient spirit by
the Government. It was cruel—may,
he would go farther and say it was un-
sportsmanlike—to ask a beautiful fiery
creature, already burdened with a
jockey and numberless “shirts,” to
carry a luxury tax as well. (Cheers.)
Humanity cried out against it. The
R.S.P.C.A. would not allow it. (Great
applause.) -
Mr. Alf Oddson, on behalf of the
Bookmakers' League of Pity for Them-
selves, begged to support the gallant
gentleman whose breezy speech they
had so much enjoyed. (Applause.)
Speaking as a sportsman he held that
racing was not only so essentially a
British gentleman's pursuit as always
to be entitled to preferential treatment,
but that the spectacle at the present
time, during critical battles, of crowds
of people hurrying to Newmarket with
plenty of money for gambling purposes
could not but hearten our Allies. (Re-
newed applause.) - - -
Colonel CoE, speaking on behalf of
Turf journalists, who surely were as
hard working a class of men as any in
the country (cheers), considering that
many of them had never seen a race-
horse in their lives until the exigencies
of Fate got it between the shafts of a
London cab, begged to support the last
speakers. Racing was a Fleet Street
industry and must not be hampered.
(Loud cheers).
After further remarks on the topic of
racing, marked by a pronounced unan-
imity, the Hon. Ernest Redd Potter rose
to take up the cudgels on behalf of all
those who find their relaxation, after
long hours of toil, in playing billiards or
snooker's pool. Some one, he said, had
been so unimaginative as to suggest
that that useful and necessary adjunct
to civilised life, the billiard table, should - -
be taxed also as a luxury. Luxury ! - ... --

TWO PICTURES.
DEAR MR. FooD-CoNTRo1.I.E.R.—At this moment I am
not very sure of your name. For a time you were Lord
DEvoNPort, and then you became Lord RHONDDA, and then
made by famous manufacturers of dog food that the biscuits
so much relished by dogs are made up of ingredients abso-
lutely unfit for human food, so that there can be no ques-
tion that, if dogs are still to be fed on food specially
made for them, any human being will be nearer to
there came a devastating rumour that you were to be starvation by the fraction of a crumb. No, my dear Lord
somebod
back to
that name you had done the State some service, people
had got used to you, and, though a few here and there
grumbled and groused—what will men not grouse about
even in these days?—the vast majority at home recognised
your decrees as being necessary and were glad to note how
smoothly the new machine worked in your hands, and how
easily the people accommodated themselves to what was
required of them. It is no small feat to have accomplished
this in a world suspicious of even the slightest change. So
here we are, living under the coupon system and, on the
whole, very little the worse for it. Some of the credit of
this must go to the people who are affected by it; but even
when that deduction is made a large proportion must
remain with you. So please stick to your post, Lord
RHoNDDA, and keep on giving us a generous display of
common-sense. That's that ; and I fancy I have got you
into a good temper and that you are willing to listen with
an open mind to the little complaint that I wish to bring
before you. -
I had a letter from the Western Front the other day from
a friend who in happier days was an efficient solicitor, and is
now an efficient Major in a London regiment. He spoke
with intense admiration of the fighting quality of his men
and praised their cheerfulness and kindness to one another
under difficult circumstances. “One thing,” he said, “will
amuse you. About a week ago we were marching through
what had once been a village and was now a mere collection
of ruins. There wasn't a trace of life in the whole place so
far as we could see, except that, as we passed, a lean and
famished little dog issued from a farmyard and stood
watching us. Everybody whistled to him or called to him,
and at last he seemed to make up his mind and took his
place in the ranks and stepped it gallantly between Bert of
Peckham and Alf of Camberwell. From that moment he
has remained with us, and is being fed back into robust
health by our particular portion of the great British Army.
All the men are devoted to him and see to it that he gets
his food. It is little enough now and then, but still he gets
it; and the men would resent as offensive any suggestion
that their new little friend should not be allowed to draw
his ration. They tell one another anecdotes showing his
brilliant intelligence, and feel in some obscure way that the
luck of the section with which he marches is bound up
with him. One of the corporals has manufactured for him
an anti-poison-gas outfit, which he wears very ludicrously
and very proudly.”
That is one picture. Here is another of a very different
sort. During the past week or so a painful and deplor-
able rumour has come to our ears, and we have been
told with varying degrees of assurance that no more dog
biscuits are to be manufactured, and that, on the exhaustion
of the existing stocks, dogs will have to go without food,
which means, of course, that the vast majority of dogs
will have to come to an end, for our own food ration
has been so greatly cut down that, even if we were allowed
to share it with our dogs, it could not be done. Dogs
therefore will have to starve, or will be “put down,” or,
as a third alternative, will have to be taken to Flanders,
and attached to some generous body of soldiery. And mind
you, Lord RHONDDA, this offensive against our gentle and
else, name not stated. Now you have harked RiiONDDA, let us observe some measure in our rationing
ord RHoNDDA, and this is good hearing, for under processes, and let us not rejoice the hearts of the Germans
by reducing our dogs to starvation and ourselves to
absurdity. Can anyone give me a sound reason why stuffs
that are good for dogs and bad for human beings should not
be made up into dog food 2 I venture to call your attention
to this matter because I know that it is deeply felt by many
who are friends of the friend of man. Do pray look into it,
and don't give way to the man who, having once been
barked at by a Pekinese, sees himself pursued by Great
Danes and wolfhounds through the remaining period of his
existence. - -

I Got SCRATCHED CUTTIN' THE BARBs of F THE ENEMY's WLRELESS WHEN I 'ADN'T MY GLOVES ON."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM rather inclined to call Second Marriage (SECKER)
the best, because certainly the most direct and compre-
hensible, story that I have yet read over the signature of
VIoDA MEYNELL. The marriage in question was that of
Ismay Hunt and Arnold Glimour. This Ismay was one of
a large family of girls, and just before the opening of the
tale had wedded Hunt, of whom we are told that he was
rich beyond dreams and adored his wife so fervently that,
believing her disappointed with the union, he promptly
died, and from motives of delicacy left her but a bare three
thousand of capital. A hint here of the old subtlety. Much
more obvious is the uncomfortable situation of poor Ismay,
who, faced with a general expectation that she should
finance her sister's love-match and generally play the
goddess in the gilded car, has to tell the assembled two
families that it simply won't run to it. (Only of course
Ismay expresses herself more elegantly than this.) It runs
to it less than ever after she has met and fallen headlong
in love with Arnold, because thenceforward the three thou-
sand becomes definitely assigned to his projects for a
pumping-engine to drain the fens among which the scene
of the story is laid. Much of the charm and cleverness of
the book comes from the part that the manipulation of this
water-power plays in the plot; else what you may admire
most is the skill with which the two protagonists, with
their almost violent individuality, are made to stand out
like each other and everybody else as possible. Ismay
especially doth bestride the story like a female Colossus;
and her vitality is, I feel, of enormous benefit to a society
that but for these strenuous lovers would remain a little
devoid of any conspicuous activities either of mind or body.
Mr. W. PETT RIDGE is the wise bird. He sings his
songs twice over, and many times more than twice, but
always with some touch of freshness. Moreover he has
in full measure the careless rapture that comes from an
apparent enjoyment of his own themes. For example, the
latest story, Top Speed (METHUEN), which treats of precisely
the type of kindly Cockneys, small tradesmen with large
hearts, whom the author has made peculiarly his own. This
time it is the Mayor of a London Borough and his family
whose development—but especially that of the Mayor and

of course, that characteristic figure of the observer within

I have often been tempted to this inquiry.) Through
domestic trials and the hazards of public life, in the fierce
light that beats upon a scarlet robe, the upward progress of

go quite so fast or be so uniformly efficient? Also I record
my conviction that the otherwise admirable mot describing
diaeresis as “a complaint that brings out two black spots,” is
an unlikely contribution to dialogue in a milk-shop parlour.
If Mrs. GEORGE WEMYss could have abandoned the rather
tiresome staccato of her phrasing and the pursuit of infi-
nitesimal jokes almost to the verge of facetiousness I should
have enjoyed her Impossible People (CoNSTABLE) more whole-
heartedly. I think Parson Templar and his wife Joanna (he
used to preach ex-tempore sermons from her notes—which
was awkward when the third page was part of a letter to a
friend) are really so impossible that they must have existed;
and perhaps that's why, for all their queerness—a nice
kind of queerness which took the form of an all-embracing
charity and tolerance—they are more alive than some of
the other people whom I am not sure (such is my dulness)
the author meant to be quite as impossible as they are.
The Templars adopted a girl-child who turned out ill—or
illish—and a sort of housemaid who did exceedingly well,

Duncan Ferrier rescues damsels in distress, confronts
villains, hobnobs with highwaymen and displays a marked
propensity for getting himself knocked on the head, besides
contriving, thanks to some rather roundabout steering by his
author, to be present at a sea-fight, in which that fascinat-
ing scoundrel, or hero, JoHN PAUL Jones, plays the leading
part; yet somehow it does not do. Even the freest use of
such recognised incidents of everyday life in the eighteenth
century as robberies, duels and smuggling affrays does not
save the book from being almost inconceivably wooden, so
that when that dull dog and weathercock lover, Duncan,
finally arrives at present felicity and a prospective earldom

selected for her victim another young plutocrat, who, if not
equally spoilt, is equally in the habit of going some when the
occasion calls for going in any form. Being not unnaturally

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAURIGE AFFAIR AND OTHERS.
“RECRUIT.”—You say that you con-
sider your duty as a citizen to be more
sacred than your duty as a soldier,
and that was the reason why you ab-
sented yourself from parade in order
to assist at the killing of your first home-
grown pig. We are afraid we cannot
take up your case.
“Politics UNDER ARMs.”—You are
misinformed. There is no intention of
finding a new post for General MAURICE
as Director of Political Operations.
“PARTY UEBER ALLEs.”—We note
your satisfaction, as an ex-member of
the late Ministry, at the establishment,
for the first time since the inauguration
of Armageddon, of a definite Opposition,
organised with full equipment of Whips
and Party funds to harass the Govern-
ment which is responsible for the con-
duct of the War. This satisfaction is
cordially shared by the enemy, and
their disappointment over the failure
of your recent attack, from which they
hoped great things, is very bitter.
“DIVIDED DUTY.”—You are engaged
on important national service and find
the greatest difficulty in attending at
the House of Commons for the weekly
crisis. Have you consulted Mr. As-
QUITH or Mr. PRINGLE 2 We are con-
fident that if you put your case to them
they would consider it favourably, and
possibly arrange for these crises to
occur only once a fortnight, at any rate
during the present offensive at the other
Front.
“HARD CASE.”—We appreciate your
scruples. You are in the early forties
and perfectly fit for general service,
yet so long as you are drawing four
hundred pounds a year as a Member
of Parliament you hesitate to indulge
your ardour for the trenches to the
neglect of duties nearer home. Our ad-
vice to you is to ignore these scruples,
however manly and creditable to you.
On the other matter which you raise—
the difficulty of finding house accom.
modation at Maidenhead—we have no
useful advice to put at your service.
“ANTI-GEORGE.”—We agree with
you that war has its drawbacks. But
when you go on to say that the chief
of these is a tendency to distract the
Opposition from its purpose in life,
namely, to embarrass the Government
of the day, we cannot follow you. We
think you have greatly overrated this
alleged tendency.
“UNDER THE CLock.”—Many thanks
for the unsolicited paragraph in The
Daily News describing our language to-
wards the enemy as being in the Billings-
buke, and at the risk of offending the
readers of your patriotic organ by hurt-
ing the feelings of the Huns, we propose
to go on saying just what we think of the
KAISER and his friends. By the way,

“BRIGHTONIAN.”—We feel sure that
the Board of Trade will consider your
claims to the privileges of a season-
ticket holder if you point out that you
have for some time been a bond-fide
resident in Brighton during the more
prominent phases of the moon. It
will not be necessary for you to re-
mind the authorities of the national
importance of the Gatwick race meet-

WAR-TIME DISEASES.
UNDER existing circumstances and
with the present shortage of doctors a
self-made physician thinks it wise to
warn the public that new diseases are
springing up amongst us every day.
The following are a few of the most
common, which in many cases lend
themselves to simple home treatment:
Quack Fever.
This is caused by eating vegetable
duck. The symptoms include a ten-
dency to waddle and to flat feet, with a
shortening of the legs. Change of diet
is essential.
Bright Disease.
This is an offal disease, caused by
eating lights and other bright objects.
The patient complains bitterly when
asked to protrude his tongue.
Sausageria.
The symptoms include snatching at
stray animals. Visits to the Zoo should
be prohibited.
Daymare.
The patient suffers from hallucina-
tions. He fancies that small parcels
of all shapes and sizes are hanging
from every finger, toe and button. There
is a great feeling of restriction and
pressure. Rending, bursting and tear-
ing sounds are heard continuously. A
brain sedative may be tried to relieve
the discomfort.
Allotmumps.
The sight becomes impaired, with a
tendency to magnify or see double. The
Jealousy is a serious symptom. The
disease may lead to insomnia and man-
slaughter if not taken in time. Cooling
drinks relieve the tension.
Couponenza.
The senses reel and there is difficulty
in making the mind act. There is an
increase in appetite, but the digestion
is upset. There may be a marked an-
tipathy to rice and eggs. Change of
scene and diet is essential.
Polyphasia.
There is considerable tension of the
tonsils, which the patient tries to re-
lieve by talking to strangers in omni-
bus, tram or train. The discomfort
may be reduced by sucking anti-con-
versation lozenges.
Cuthbertitis.
There is a tendency to anaemia and
chattering of the teeth. A lack of
interest is shown in anyone or anything
but the sufferer. Soft or feather beds
should be avoided, and alcohol, tea and
smoking prohibited.
Pushulismun.
This disease is prevalent in crowded
places. The temper is much affected
and physical and vocal powers are
temporarily increased to an abnormal
extent. The elbows tend to sharpen
and the feet to stamp. The pain may
be relieved by long walks, or by soli-
tary confinement and the avoidance of
stimulants.
Neurataria.
The patient is subject to sudden
spasms of apprehension and betrays a
disposition to burrow in the bowels
of the earth. He may become unintel-
ligible or speak in a foreign tongue.
The sufferer should be withdrawn from
his favourite haunts. Quiet is essential
and a course of barbed wire may be
necessary.
“In the Spring . . .”
“Wanted, Young Lady, for fancy."
Provincial Paper.

high German officers who are arranging things
from afar through telescopes down which they
shout their orders.”—Liverpool Daily Post.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE voyage of H.M.S. “PRESIDENT.”
A DREAM.
[Mr. Punch means no disrespect to H.M.S. President, which, being
moored in the Thames off Bouverie Street, he has always looked upon
as his guardship, but he has often wondered what would happen if
only a few thousands of the officers and men borne on her books were
to issue from the Admiralty and elsewhere—but especially from the
Admiralty—and go on board their ship; hence the disquieting dream
that follows.]
It was eighteen bells in the larboard watch with a neap-
tide running free, - --- - -
And a gale blew out of the Ludgate Hills when the Presi-
dent put to sea; - -
An old mule came down Bouverie Street to give her a
helping hand, --
And I didn't think much of the ship as such, but the crew
was something grand.
The bo'sun stood on a Hoxton bus and blew the Luncheon
Call,
And the ship's crew came from the four wide winds, but
chiefly from Whitehall;
They came like the sand on a wind-swept strand, like shots
from a Maxim gun,
And the old mule stood with the tow-rope on and said,
“It can't be done.”
With a glitter of wiggly braid they came, with a clatter of
forms and files,
The little A.P.'s they swarmed like bees, the Commodores
stretched for miles;
Post-Captains came with hats in flame, and Admirals by
the ell, -
And which of the lot was the biggest pot there was never
a man could tell.
They choked the staggering quarter-deck and did the thing
no good; -
They hung like tars on the mizzen-spars (or those of the
crowd that could);
Far out of view still streamed the queue when the moke
said, “Well, I'm blowed
If I'll compete with the 'ole damn Fleet,” and he pushed
off down the road.
And the great ship she sailed after him, though the Lord
knows how she did, -
With her gunwales getting a terrible wetting and a brace
of her stern sheets hid,
When up and spoke a sailor-bloke and he said, “It strikes
me queer,
And I've sailed the sea in the R.N.V. this five-and-forty
year;
“But a ship as can't 'old 'arf 'er crew, why, what sort of a
ship is 'er 2
And oo's in charge of the pore old barge if dangers do
occur 2 - -
And I says to you, I says, ''Eave to, until this point's
agreed';" -
And some said, “Why?” and the rest, “Ay, ay,” but the
mule he paid no heed.
So the old beast hauled and the Admirals bawled and the
crew they fought like cats, -
And the ship went dropping along past Wapping and down
by the Plumstead Flats;
But the rest of the horde that wasn't aboard they trotted
along the bank, - -
Or jumped like frogs from the Isle of Dogs, or fell in the
But while they went by the coast of Kent up spoke an
aged tar—
“A joke's a joke, but this 'ere moke is going a bit too far;
I can tell by the motion we're nearing the ocean—and
that 's too far for me; "
But just as he spoke the tow-rope broke and the ship
sailed out to sea.
And somewhere out on the deep, no doubt, they probe the
problems through
Of who's in charge of the poor old barge and what they
ought to do; -
And the great files flash and the dockets crash and the ink-
wells smoke like sin, -
But many a U-boat tells the tale how the President did
her in.
For many have tried to pierce her hide and flung torpedoes
at her,
But the vessel, they found, was barraged round with a mile
of paper matter; * - -
The whole sea swarms with Office Forms and the U-boats
stick like glue,
So nothing can touch the President much, for nothing at
all gets through.

HOW A WOMAN BAULKED AN AIR-RAID.
SUDDENLY above the diminishing chatter sounded from
the corner cot the three sharp whistles of the hostile aero-
plane warning, and upon ears not so startled as they might
have been broke the pulsing hum of a Bosch engine. In a
moment the chiaroscuro of the ward was pierced by four
rays of brilliant light as the Perforated Sapper, the Fusilier
of the Thousand Patches, the Gassed Grenadier and the
Gunner with the Game Leg switched on their electric
torches. The questing beams searched and swept hither
and thither, from the blanket ridge which marked the
Colonel's corporation to the spotless ceiling. Undismayed
the nurses stayed bravely at their posts. To and fro, up and
down, peered the searchlights, till “There he goes!” said
the Malaria Major, and clear in the white radiance hung
revealed the crimson shape of a German Scout.
As the white beams converged and steadied upon the
sinister form (cut from the cover of a popular monthly)
there woke from cot after cot the racket of Archie and
machine-gun fire. Astonishing effects can be produced with
a long pencil against a wooden locker, and the Perforated
Sapper's imitation of an Archie had many a time, he swore,
provoked genuine competition. There was an angry croak
from the Gassed Grenadier, “Put out that light there!”
addressed to the glow of a foolhardy cigarette. Louder
rattled the machine-guns; more angrily woufed the Archies;
the red shape in the searchlights hovered menacing above
the Blightied warriors; and the intrepid nurses, mastering
their laughter, opened a fire of vain expostulation.
Then came the crash of a bomb (as the Fusilier slammed
the lid of his locker), and simultaneously a commanding
question, “What is the meaning of all this noise 2 " .
That first bomb was the last; the Bosch's engine stopped,
the Archies and machine-guns ceased, the staring search-
lights were cut off as with a knife. Of all the clamour there
survived no murmur; only muffled snorts from beneath
pillows showed where British officers were cowering under
cover. And under cover they remained till the stately Sister
had passed through the swinging doors again, when the
stream and sank.
Gassed Grenadier blew, softly and timorously, “All clear!"

Wednesday, May 8th. — Lord
BEAVERBRook made his maiden
speech in the House of Lords
and surprised the peers by the
ease with which he overcame
its acoustic difficulties. Too
often the baffled reporters have
to record that “the noble lord
was imperfectly heard,” but the
DIRECTOR of INForMATION was
audible throughout, whether he
was complimenting Lord DEN-
BIGH as a born propagandist or
recounting his own efforts in the

Minister in difficulties looked like off
the stage. Mr. Asquith was sur-
prised and pained to discover that the
Government interpreted his motion for
a Select Committee as a vote of censure
upon them. He honestly thought that
they would have jumped at it, as being
far preferable to their own proposal of
a judicial tribunal.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, however, jumped
upon it instead, and made it plain that,
after the attacks upon him in the Press,
no dilatory inquiry of any sort would
now suit him. So he told his story, forti-
fied with official statements coming from
General MAURICE's own department,
and left it to the House to
vindicate his veracity. Sir
Edward CARson made an elo-
quent appeal to Mr. Asquith
to withdraw his motion and
to the House to “close up our
ranks.” But, though this was
endorsed by such staunch Lib-
erals as Mr. SPENCER HUGHEs

MY DEAR CHARLEs, There are three
men, the Frenchman, the Englishman,
and the American, are there not ? I
am lucky enough to have met them all,
and to-night I have just let myself go
in the attempt, as an Englishman,
to tell the American all about it. It
was not a success; I found he had it
already from the Frenchman.
When I had finished my lecture the
American, whom we will call David,
since that happens to be his name, told
me something about our own immortal
Thomas which I had never heard before.
He met one of them returning from
England to France off leave. It was
one of those dark and unforgivable
days when everythin --- -

goes up and down, up
and down; when an
land, even the Nort
of France, is prefera-
ble to the sea. The
closely-packed party
was not a happy one.
Myfriend David, never
a pessimist, was him-
self asking if that
thing called Life was
really worth worrying
about, and the trench-
hardened warriors in
khaki who surrounded
him were plainly of
opinion that it was
not. Suddenly, when
it appeared that there
was no turn for the
worse that

things " " ' "
Yes, bit by bit I got it out of David many a “Mon Commandant,” was that
that he had begun as a Legionary (not
“soldat,” if you please), and had had
twelve months' service in the Legion
itself and other months' service lent to
other regiments of the French Army.
All French regiments of attack have
seen life, but the Foreign Legion in
particular has missed none of the fun.
It is not as foreign as all that, really.
Though there is the stranger element,
some hundreds of David's kinsmen, for
example, there is also a proportion of
it which is the very best French,
especially the officers. This, as we all
know, is a hard best to compete with,
though our fellows at the moment are
seeing what they can do about it. The
picture that David drew, for instance,

you can't march if you have no feet
to march with. The Major's point was
simply “Marchez' " and it was empha-
sised, not brutally but plainly, by a
lethal weapon. And so they did as
the Major suggested, and never again
thought of doing anything else.
But do not run away with the idea
that the Legion is merely unkind in its
methods; its management is as good
as its discipline. Their field kitchens
are brought up to them at the gallop,
wherever they may be at meal-times
and however many field kitchens may
be damaged in the process. -
As to Jo-Jo-there was an affair of
scouts on a hard high-road. A patrol

warrior who had probably experienced
every evil which humanity can contrive,
turned to David, and with a grey sickly
smile said, “This brings the War ’ome
to yer, don't it, mate?”
Why “mate "2 Because he too was
in uniform, but not an English uniform.
Indeed our officials had shown them-
selves rather sticky about passing him
on to the boat, for he was clearly neither
a civilian nor a member of the IB.E.F.
“proceeding.” There was, in fact, a
regrettable delay of twenty-four hours
before he could get on to any boat at all.
He was in a hurry to get back to his
regiment at the Front, not from any
passionate longing for the Front, but
because he knew what a penchant his
regiment had for punctuality in such
matters. Our own authorities are pe.
dantic enough on these points, but they
are quite casual, it appears, compared
my fancy.
But first as to David's initiation.
When all the men in Europe suddenly
went out to fight, David, who found
himself idling away his time in those
parts, thought this was an opportunity
of becoming a man himself, and, as he
put it, “growing some hair on his
chest.” So he went gaily into it and
found himself in no time attempting
to march twenty-five miles a day, carry-
ing on or about himself a weight
which in peace-time you would pay
two railway porters sixpence each to
carry between them from one train to
another. After about a couple of days
of this he and his friend found that
their feet were no longer feet at all, and,
greatly daring, they determined to fall
out, So they fell out, and the hard-
bitten Major came to them to have a
talk on the subject.
His address was
short and easily understood: “Mar-
Dog-faced Man, in particular caught anyone near enough to hear, “Go on,
my children; I too shall be there in
one instant.”
At another time the section were
taking an hour's rest from the fight.
They were disturbed by the guns, and
the order went out to construct shrapnel
cover at once. David, by now an old
soldier, saw a dog-kennel near by, whose
roof appeared to be the easiest and
simplest means of achieving his task.
So, with a friend, he made off to it,
and started to lift the roof with en-
trenching tools. The thing was just
coming apart when there was an ugly
noise from within. They peered through
the cracks; inside, on the straw, was
Jo-Jo, sleeping with his habitual aplomb.
The parting from the Legion was
the most touching incident in David's
whole career. In the middle of the
battle it was decided to transfer the
American part of that particular unit
to another regiment, also a regiment of

back. He and his friends were phrall
before the whole and thanked; the
parting was sad, as all such partings
must be; but these are hard matter-of-
fact times, when men may be allowed
to think a little of their own particular
comfort, and there was a touch of
pleasure, even a feeling of advantage,
in going ten miles back, far from the
moise and fuss of it all. Some repartee
took place, in which David and his
friends had the upper hand.
That night they found themselves
lodged in comfortable billets, thinking
with a comfortable pity of their old
Legion up in the line. The following
morning they received orders to march
back to the line themselves, with their
new regiment. You rarely get the real
best of repartee with Frenchmen; the
unit they found themselves relieving
was their same old friend, the Legion!
Yes, Charles, there are three men—
the Frenchman, the Englishman, and
the American. And they are all as bad
as each other, and none of them will
ever be got to treat this War as an
entirely serious matter.

THE MOVIE LIBRARY,
THE successful filming on Long Island i

there is nothing outside the power of

be our old friend, BILI, NYE, who dealt
so faithfully with the Heathen Chinee,

at the first performance in Washing-
ton, at the White House, “the audience
persistently called for Mr. Gerard, who
in response" (the quotation is from an
official source)“made a speech—a fitting
finale to so worthy a subject.”
If, then, on distant Long Island, all
the atmosphere and high personages of
Berlin and Potsdam can be accept-

Kaiser (angrily). I will not be dictated to. If any orders
are to be given I will give them myself and will brook no
interference from anybody. I am the Kaiser and it is my
duty to command, and this duty I will fulfil in spite of
everybody. A pretty pass things are coming to when it is
said that the KAISER must share his responsibilities with
his advisers! -
Kaiserin. My dear WILLIE, do not be so angry. A man
to be so angry as you are must wear at least a Field-
Marshal's uniform. It's no use being violently angry in
a shirt and a pair of trousers and a dressing-gown, it looks
too funny. I have always told you not to be angry just
before you go to bed. -
Kaiser. Now you are abandoning me.
Kaiserin. Oh, my dear WILLIE, what on earth put such
an absurd notion into your head 2 I only hinted as a little
joke that it is more suitable to be angry in a uniform than
in a dressing-gown, but you are so touchy to-day that
really one doesn't know what to say or how to say it.
Kaiser. You said something about peace.
Kaiserin. I did.
Kaiser. Such a word is enough to make any soldier
furious.
Kaiserin. I don't know why any soldier should be angry
at such a word; even if one is not allowed to say the word
the thing itself must come sooner or later.
Kaiser. But not a bad peace.
Kaiserin. You know I am beginning to think that there
is no such thing as a bad peace. When one reads of all these
splendid young men of ours being shattered to pieces by
thousands and thousands, when one knows of the grief and
misery of half the mothers of the land, one begins to think
that even victory may be bought at too big a price.
Kaiser. The enemy brought it upon themselves by attack.
1ng us.
Kaiserin. Yes, I firmly believe that our cause is a just
one; but I believe too that we have done almost enough to
prove it, and that it is time this dreadful slaughter came to
an end.
Kaiser. Bah! You are only a woman. . .
Kaiserin. Yes, you always say that, and it is-true that
we women do not fight, but it is true also that we women
suffer not less than the men, though in a different way.
Kaiser. Do not say such things to me; peace at this
moment is unthinkable. Never unless our offensive fails
in the field—and I have given instructions that it shall not
fail—will I resort to peace negotiations. There is nothing
for it but to let the German sword speak, as it has already
gloriously spoken in many a great battle.
Kaiserin. But are you not fighting in order that there may
be peace? You all say so, but as soon as anybody begins
to strive for peace you all fall upon him and abuse him.
Kaiser. And rightly so. You don't mean to say that you
defend our poor-spirited Austrian ally who wrote that
infamous letter the other day? -
Kaiserin. No, I cannot defend the manner in which he
did it. He is young and inexperienced. But, at any rate,
he realised that the Central Powers want peace and must
have it, the Germans as much as anybody else. As you
say, I am only a woman, and I cannot understand how you
men, who have all the power in your hands, have got your-
selves so miserably tied up in war that you cannot devise
any means for extricating yourselves and us. We may
be women, but we think we could have managed better
than that. -
language is almost treasonable, and I cannot think why I
have allowed you to continue so long. -
Kaiserin. You have allowed me to continue because you
know I am right, and you are now stopping me because
you cannot find any answer to what I say.
Kaiser. Not at all.
Kaiserin. Good night then, and may your dreams be
pleasant. -
SAVED FOR SEVEN-AND-sixPENCE.
Captain Angus McAllister sat in the Mess, a brimming
tankard of vin blanc at his elbow. Only yesterday there
had been added to his already enormous list of decorations
that crowning distinction, the Order of the British Empire.
No wonder the junior officers of the squadron regarded him
with all the reverence to which his fame so justly entitled
him. No wonder the Huns from Montdidier to the sea
fled wildly from the sky at the first symptom of the approach
of his purple polyplane.' -
To-day he was not long to rest from his deadly work.
An orderly approached him and, saluting with the smart-
ness characteristic of the R.F.C., said that his presence was
requested in the C.O.'s room. " .
“So be it,” said McAllister sternly, and strode from the
room, the deathly silence only broken by the dull clanking
of the medals on his chest. A moment later the grey-haired
Commander had imparted his instructions. The pilot's lips
set in an even sterner line, and, drawing himself up to his
full height, he saluted rigidly. -
“Very good, Sir,” was his grim response.
Another moment and he was seated in the machine.
“Petrol off, switch off, suck in,” cried the mechanic.
“Contact,” snapped McAllisterand roared into the sky ...
In less time than it takes me to get this into print his
work was done, that heroic act that was so soon to ring
through the world and bring the mighty house of Hohen-
zollern in utter ruin to the ground. He had scattered two
million porcelain door-knobs, painted to resemble poached
eggs, over the streets of famine-haunted Berlin. Revolution
was a matter of hours.
- His work had been well done indeed, and his return
would mean another bar to his M.V.O.; but every moment
his position became more perilous. Every moment new
anti-aircraft guns joined in the hideous din below till the
whole sky was ablaze with bursting shells.
Angus McAllister's lips were set in a still sterner line
as his polyplane rocked to the blast of the high-explosive.
Six of its wings had already been torn from the tortured
machine, and the propeller was a mere parody of its original
design.
A blaze of dazzling light, a deafening detonation, and a
seventh wing dropped into the void below. The machine
faltered; it was rapidly losing its buoyancy. Lower and
lower it sank, and Angus knew that with its present load
it could never hope to cross the British lines.
“Save the 'bus" is the motto of our intrepid birdmen,
and McAllister's decision never for a moment wavered.
The machine must at all costs be saved for the nation.
Riddled with shrapnel as it was and appreciably reduced
in value by the loss of so many wings, it might still be cut
up and used for colanders.
Setting his lips in a line of indescribable sternness,
McAllister leaped from the machine. He felt himself
falling—falling. . . .
But what is this? Can this be the same gallant officer,
drifting gently downwards, wafted by the friendly breeze
across the lines to home and safety? Yes, it can, because
he was wearing a Pottifer's Patent Parachute (a Boon to
Kaiser. I will not listen to you any more. This kind of

“BLooy LN' SLow PLACE THE world would BE, JIM, IF THERE NEVER 'ADN'T BEEN No GERMANs."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ALGERNoN BLAckwood's insatiable characters have
(if I may be forgiven the flippancy) broken out again.
After exhausting the creepy possibilities of earth and fire
and water, it was only to be expected (especially with all
this flying-chat about) that their fancy should lightly turn
to The Promise of Air (MACMILLAN). The result is a book,
admirably written, full of grace and dignity of thought—
but, to my mind at least, entirely lacking in any kind of
thrill, either human or supernatural. The idea, which (if
I have it right) concerns the liberation of soul from the
limitations of earth bondage, is fine enough, almost indeed
too fine for story treatment; and, as always with Mr. BLACK-
wooD, the chief characters who develop it are drawn with
a great measure of artistic care. Here they are the over-
worked father, Mr. Wimble, cumbered with the ties of
earthly matters, but pursuing afar off a dream of freedom;
his wife, who has abandoned dreams for the “muddy”
details that make up real life for her; and Joan, the daughter,
nearer to the air than either, leading her father eventually
to—no, this I confess was a bitter blow to me, since, despite
all sorts of hints and promises, they never actually and
physically flew—at least I think not ; but it must be ad-
mitted that Mr. BLAckwood in uplifted mood is rather easily
misunderstood. What constitutes my complaint against
the book is this, that it falls between the stools of allegory
and romance, being something too profound and slow-
moving for frank make-believe, and hardly direct enough
to be acceptable as pure ethics. Perhaps the real trouble
lies in the mistake of having stretched a beautiful episode
especially Joan, who was pleasant enough to make me
wonder whether Dear Brutus may perhaps have set a
fashion in attractive daughters.
The Narrow Strait (HUTCHINsoN) has a trifle more body
in it than most of those gentle Kensingtonian romances to
which Mr. W. E. Norris is in the habit of restricting the
wide circle of his admirers. Yet even here the action moves
but slowly to a placid sound of teacups in the drawing-rooms
of good houses; while the addresses of practically all the
cast could obviously have been discovered from the Red
Book. But the central character, Felix Roden, financier and
politician, is drawn with firmer strokes than Mr. NoFRIs is
wont to employ, and rouses a proportionately greater sym-
pathy. This Felic, son of a rich ironmaster with ambitions,
had married a French woman of the old nobility, an achieve-
ment that his son Gerald is in process of imitating, when
his death at the Front ends his rather too protracted court-
ship and his father's hopes for him in one blow. The
publishers are well justified in saying that The Narrow Strait
“is chiefly concerned with the inherent difficulties attend-
ing an Anglo-French marriage”; though they might have
added that these obstacles are, in the second example, not
so much due to international incompatibilities as to the
incurable tardiness of Mr. NoFRIs's lovers. You will pro-
bably find your interest stirred less by the son's delayed
romance than by the ruin of his plausible, unscrupulous
and very human father. Mr. NoFRIs, in his long record,
has not, I think, any scene more genuinely moving than
that in which Felic Roden receives the news of his son's
death. Rogue, almost scoundrel as he had been, Felix in
that moment drew from me both sympathy for himself and






into an attenuated novel. Still, I enjoyed much of it,
admiration for his author.

“BLoomin' SLow PLACE THE world would BE, JIM, IF THERE NEVER 'ADN'T BEEN No GERMANs."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ALGERNoN BLACKwooD's insatiable characters have
(if I may be forgiven the flippancy) broken out again.
After exhausting the creepy possibilities of earth and fire
and water, it was only to be expected (especially with all
this flying-chat about) that their fancy should lightly turn
to The Promise of Air (MACMILLAN). The result is a book,
admirably written, full of grace and dignity of thought—
but, to my mind at least, entirely lacking in any kind of
thrill, either human or supernatural. The idea, which (if
I have it right) concerns the liberation of soul from the
limitations of earth bondage, is fine enough, almost indeed
too fine for story treatment; and, as always with Mr. BLACK-
wood, the chief characters who develop it are drawn with
a great measure of artistic care. Here they are the over-
worked father, Mr. Wimble, cumbered with the ties of
earthly matters, but pursuing afar off a dream of freedom ;
his wife, who has abandoned dreams for the “muddy”
details that make up real life for her; and Joan, the daughter,
nearer to the air than either, leading her father eventually
to—no, this I confess was a bitter blow to me, since, despite
all sorts of hints and promises, they never actually and
physically flew—at least I think not ; but it must be ad-
mitted that Mr. BLACKwood in uplifted mood is rather easily
misunderstood. What constitutes my complaint against
the book is this, that it falls between the stools of allegory
and romance, being something too profound and slow-
moving for frank make-believe, and hardly direct enough
to be acceptable as pure ethics. Perhaps the real trouble
lies in the mistake of having stretched a beautiful episode
especially Joan, who was pleasant enough to make me
wonder whether Dear Brutus may perhaps have set a
fashion in attractive daughters.
The Narrow Strait (HUTCHINsoN) has a trifle more body
in it than most of those gentle Kensingtonian romances to
which Mr. W. E. Norris is in the habit of restricting the
wide circle of his admirers. Yet even here the action moves
but slowly to a placid sound of teacups in the drawing-rooms
of good houses; while the addresses of practically all the
cast could obviously have been discovered from the Red
Book. But the central character, Felix Roden, financier and
politician, is drawn with firmer strokes than Mr. NoFRIs is
wont to employ, and rouses a proportionately greater sym-
pathy. This Felix, son of a rich ironmaster with ambitions,
had married a French woman of the old nobility, an achieve-
ment that his son Gerald is in process of imitating, when
his death at the Front ends his rather too protracted court-
ship and his father's hopes for him in one blow. The
publishers are well justified in saying that The Narrow Strait
"is chiefly concerned with the inherent difficulties attend-
ing an Anglo-French marriage”; though they might have
added that these obstacles are, in the second example, not
so much due to international incompatibilities as to the
incurable tardiness of Mr. NoRRIs's lovers. You will pro-
bably find your interest stirred less by the son's delayed
romance than by the ruin of his plausible, unscrupulous
and very human father. Mr. NoFRIs, in his long record,
has not, I think, any scene more genuinely moving than
that in which Felic Roden receives the news of his son's
death. Rogue, almost scoundrel as he had been, Felix in
that moment drew from me both sympathy for himself and

into an attenuated novel. Still, I enjoyed much of it,
admiration for his author.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Three of Hearts (HopDER AND STOUGHToN) is a mild and
harmless story of life and love in an English garrison town,
which may serve to occupy a spare hour or two of the
average novel-reader. Captain Hunter, the M.O. of the
Loamshire Light Infantry, had what is known as a “down”
on Second-Lieut. Billy Somers, and sought to discredit him
in the eyes of his C.O. by making him drunk, using to this
end a powerful drug. The only noticeable effect of this
was so to stupefy Billy as to make him propose to three girls
in the course of the same dance. The three girls were of
widely divergent types—Nora Wynne-Pritchard, heroine;
Lorne Halliday, the local dean's daughter, of the purest
deanery type; Lily Goosey (sic, if you will believe me!), one
of the many fluffy children of the vulgar builder of the neigh-
bourhood. All this occurred in the pre-war days of 1914,
and was complete in the first twenty pages of the book.
The rest of the book is occupied with the development and
solution of the little difficulties that naturally followed on
such an excess of simultaneous engagements. In her latest
book “Miss BERTA RUCK.” would not herself claim, I fancy,
to be a very profound student of humanity, its more subtle
I think that I should not be going far wrong in calling
Miss FRANCES RUMSEY at least an admiring student of the
late HENRY JAMEs. Certainly her novel, Mr. Cushing
and Mlle. du Chastel (LANE), reveals even in its title that
sincerest form of flattery that may be either deliberate or
(as probably here) unconscious. It is all about the reasons
why Mr. Cushing did not “hit it off" with the French
wife, Anne Marie, whom he had brought to share his
American home; and the further reasons that induced her
to desert her husband and elope with somebody else.
Naturally the success of someticulous a study depends on
the writer's ability to persuade you that the game is worth
the very lengthy candle, and while I am not denying to
Miss RUMSEY both insight and an obvious sincerity I con-
fess that sometimes her method did recall to me that old
jest about exhausting both subject and reader. Also of
course there remained the feeling of a borrowed mantle, of
which the scheme of the tale, its setting, and the little cast
of wealthy and cultivated French-Americans who formed
its personnel, were all so many reminders. But for this
suggestion of the second-hand I should no doubt have en-
tendencies and more in-
tricate affairs. She re-
cords merely the simple
life of her own locality
in a chatty style. She
gives me the impres-
sion of looking at things
from the rather narrow
point of view of a
British military milieu
established in the pip-
ing times of peace and
not greatly affected by
the Great War. On
the whole I am bound
to say that I regard

a pretty wit (I liked

If you have the heart to go over the prologue and sundry
acts of a tragedy which has brought upon us the dark days
through which we are passing let me commend to you a
sheaf of collected papers on War and Revolution in Russia
(CoNSTABLE), by Mr. JoHN Pollock. Perhaps there are
too many of this kind of book, which necessarily lacks con-
secutiveness and covers too much ground; but the chapters
on Russia in Revolution are of exceptional interest. The
author writes well, can observe acutely and sift wild rumour
from confirmable fact. A declaration, “I am in politics a
Liberal and by conviction a Republican,” gives point to
opinions which do not harmonise with the assumption, too
easily made by our progressives, that all that was opposed to
antocracy was wise and white and glorious. He puts the
final blame upon the system of repression which prevented
the growth of any sense of constructive statesmanship
and bred a race of fanatical leaders in opposition who can
see nothing but the abstract glories of their impossible
ideal without reference to any of the actual facts of the
situation. Mr. Pollock relates all this with patience and
tolerance, and without bitterness. The sobriety of the
author also gives value to a chapter on GREgoRY RASPUTIN,

TYNAN” is not to be flurried by the times in which we
are living, and in Miss Gascoigne (MURRAY) she has
given her admirers yet another opportunity for quiet and
sane enjoyment. In the days when Miss Gascoigne was
the lady, of the Manor of Goldcups a drive in a motor-car
was still an adventure, and little things mattered very
much. Here we have the gossip of the country-side,
and its love affairs and daily episodes related with an
easy grace that conceals its art. , Mrs. HINKSoN is
indeed supreme in making a delightful story out of the
slightest material. Only once was I brought up with a
jerk, and that was when the heroine spoke of “the dura-
tion of John's recess”—the John of this pompous phrase
being just a small cadet at Osborne. I have no further
comment to make, but simply commend Miss Gascoigne
with great confidence to the faithful.
From the Zoo's Annual Report:-
“The rations of animals that were accustomed to receive food
from visitors have been increased, and although it cannot be doubted
but that such animals have had a duller time, their health has not
suffered. The elephants used for riding were accustomed to receive
buns and bread from visitors in the Broad Walk, and, cspecially at
first, they caused some trouble by taking bags, articles of clothing
and so forth.”
The ostriches have entered a protest, we believe, against the

unconsidered gossip.

ALFRED’S TRENCH BOOTS.
ON the day that Alfred came back from leave we were
sitting in the Mess dug-out after lunch. Suddenly the still-
ness was broken by sounds of splashing and commotion in
X3. It grew louder.
“A horse,” said John.
“Elephants,” suggested somebody else.
“Tanks,” I ventured.
“Huns, perhaps,” said the Major.
to be some large body in motion.”
Our faces blenched as we fumbled for cigarette-cases and
revolvers. Then it came round the corner. X3 is a spacious
trench, about four feet wide, with a raised duck-board
running along the middle and a small river along each side.
Right up the bed of the left-hand river marched Alfred.
When he came opposite us he climbed out on to the duck-
board and shook his feet at us. “Well, what do you think
of them 2" was his greeting. “Genuine Norwegian pedi-
gree, comprising the stoutness, durability, impermeability
and ruggedness of Scandinavia blended into one.”
“Poor old thing,” said John. “Tell us how it happened.
O. S.
“Anyhow, I take it
“No," replied Alfred, “I just went into a shop to buy
a boot-lace, and while I was there I happened to see them.
The lad behind the counter followed my gaze, and he
said . . .”
“Yes,” we interrupted as one man, “and he said . . ."
“He said, ‘That's a nice boot, Sir," and that of course
settled it. I couldn't very well leave them behind after that,
could I ?”
We agreed, and poured him out a drink while we ex-
amined the boots.
I believe they are what are known as Gent's Trench
Bootings. They reach to the knee, have soles about three
inches thick, enormous rounded domes for toes, laces each
nine feet long, and their heels are shod with old horseshoes.
From the day he rejoined us Alfred was absorbed in his
boots, if the phrase is not ambiguous. He deserted his old
friends and gave himself up entirely to boot-culture. We
seldom saw him abroad, and when we did he was always
standing in a shell-hole up to his knees in water to put
their impermeability to the test. If, on the other hand,
you went to see him in his dug-out, you would find him
almost any morning busy at work on the G.T. Bootings.
Stuggs, his valet-de-chambre, was never allowed to go near
them. - *
He used to keep a little bag of blunt scalpels and
bistouries and odds and ends with which he removed such
portions of France as stuck to them when he went walking.
He scraped them, oiled them, brushed them, massaged
them, stroked them, counted the stitches to see that none
had been mislaid, and took them to bed with him at night,
so that the rats should not bite them. At these times
they disappeared into sand-bags, caught up at the top with
natty bows of pale blue ribbon.
One of our best parlour-games was to introduce strangers
to Alfred and get up a sweep on the time it took him to
work round to the subject of boots.
“Now feel mine,” he would say: “tender as a woman's
heart.” But let us get on with the story.
One night the Bosches came over. It was quite an in-
formal affair; we weren't really expecting them at all. Not
unnaturally the noise disturbed Alfred, who woke up to
find a massive Hun blocking the door of his bedroom. He
decided that there was no time to put on his boots, so he
just sprang at the stranger with one in each hand. Fritz
parried the right boot by impaling it on his toasting-fork,
but round swung the left, weighing umpteen pounds, com-
plete with horse-shoe, and he was counted out.
Then Alfred let the Viking from Scandinavia have his head.
He ran amok. In two minutes the trench was cleared.
After breakfast the next morning I went round to see
him. I found him sitting alone, slowly paying out eighteen
feet of boot-lace on to the floor.
“That's a nice boot, Sir,” I said, picking up the one that
belonged to his left foot.
“Yes," he answered sadly; “but what about the other?
They said it was impermeable, and it hasn't stood the test."
Of a recent V.C. :—
“The Gazette says that he ‘displayed almost superham powers of
endurance.’ ”—Daily Paper.
We, too, have “superham powers” at breakfast-time, but
have never yet received any decoration for them.

“They carry the hundredweights about with smiles on their com:

Betty's grandfather, being a Volun-
teer, was earnestly rehearsing a few
physical exercises for the better enter-
tainment of his drill-sergeant when
next they met on parade. Somehow
Betty did not seem fully to appreciate
the great privilege of being in the same
room with him while this strange busi-
ness was going forward. She was five,
and as she lay there face-downward
on the floor it was with marked dis-
approval that she watched him remove
his jacket briskly, and without apology.
“You shouldn't never take off your
fings when people is in the room,
Gran'pa,” she observed. “Miss Jackson
wouldn't let you if she was here.”
Miss Jackson was the nursery gover-
noss.
“She wouldn't be here,” retorted
“Gran'pa,” and took a deep prelimin-
ary breath.
“I shan't look at you,” said Betty
sternly ; and she swung round with
her heels towards her offending relative,
who, spreading his arms out, proceeded
to squat and rise cautiously.
Betty found a picture that attracted
her in an illustrated weekly. The print
“Is this about the War, Gran'pa 2"
she asked.
“Gran'pa,” not being able to see,
risked “Yes” for an answer.
“J-o-h-n,” she spelt out with the
help of a small forefinger. “What's
that, Gran'pa 2"
“John.”
Betty looked at John's portrait for
some moments with increased interest,
then continued :
“B-u-l-l. What's that ?”
“Gran'pa' wasn't paying much at-

Betty's grandfather, being a Volun-
teer, was earnestly rehearsing a few
physical exercises for the better enter-
tainment of his drill-sergeant when
next they met on parade. Somehow
Betty did not seem fully to appreciate
the great privilege of being in the same
room with him while this strange busi-
ness was going forward. She was five,
and as she lay there face-downward
on the floor it was with marked dis-
approval that she watched him remove
his jacket briskly, and without apology.
“You shouldn't never take off your
fings when people is in the room,
Gran'pa,” she observed. “Miss Jackson
wouldn't let you if she was here.”
Miss Jackson was the nursery gover-
ness.
“She wouldn't be here,” retorted
“Gran'pa,” and took a deep prelimin-
ary breath.
“I shan't look a you,” said Betty
sternly ; and she swung round with
her heels towards her offending relative,
who, spreading his arms out, proceeded
to squat and rise cautiously.
Betty found a picture that attracted
her in an illustrated weekly. The print
“Is this about the War, Gran'pa 2" |
she asked.
“Gran'pa,” not being able to see,
risked “Yes” for an answer.
“J-o-h-n,” she spelt out with the
help of a small forefinger. “What's
that, Gran'pa 2"
“John.”
Betty looked at John's portrait for
some moments with increased interest,
then continued :
“B-u-l-l. What's that ?”
“Gran'pa' wasn't paying much at-
tention.
“Can't you—guess,” he panted, “from
the picture? What sort—of animal—
is it 2'
“It's a gemply man,” said Betty.
“O.oh.” “Gran'pa' was sitting trem-
ulously on his heels.
Betty turned her head.
“You do look funny,” she remarked
gravely, and at that juncture he over-
balanced.

with his spine for a pivot.

from an angle of forty-five degrees to

J|M–MARK I.
His haversack, rifle, gas mask, tin
hat and other impedimenta lay under
the seat with the mud of Flanders still
adhering to them. In one hand he
poised a pewter pot, in the other he held
an absurdly small cage, in which was a
bedraggled but very chirpy canary.
“That,” he replied in answer to my
inquiry—“that's a ‘Canary, gas-detect-
ing, tunnellers, for the use of; Mark I.’
Maybe by this time they've issued a
Canary Mark II., seeing as how they're
always improving our weapons, but I
ain't met it yet.” - -
He held up the cage to the admir-
ing gaze of the other occupants of the
private bar.
“Jim 's his name,” he went on, “and
I saved his blessed little life; yes, Sir,
that there bird was in one of the biggest
engagements on the Western Front and
nearly lost us a division.
Not, mind
you, that he's a pro-German or a
Pacifist; he's British all through, but
it was just carelessness like. The same
thing might happen to me or you, if
we was awkwardly placed, same as he
was.”
He paused to refresh himself and
proceeded.
“I belong to a Tunnelling Company,
which is to say, a Company that digs
tunnels under the ground. Then the
Engineers comes along, fixes up charges,
electric wires and other gadgets, which,
if the Bosch ain't swift, blows him
back to the place he didn't ought to
have left. Well, as I said, we have
an issue of Canary, Mark I., which we
takes with us to test for foul air. If
the air is foul the canaries fall off their
perches and we clears out.
“All right. Well, we was tunnelling
one day near the Bosch lines, and among
our canaries was this here old lead-
swinger, Jim. I tell you, he's a proper
schemer is that there bird, if you only
knew it. Well, Sir, we comes out of
the tunnel, quite unawares that Jim
here had took to his wings and flown.
A deserter he was, liable to a court-
martial.
“But that wasn't the worst—oh no.
Not satisfied with legging it, or wing-
ing it, so to say, what must he do but
perch himself in No-Man's-Land, and
start serenading like a gramophone; yes,
he did, chirped away as if there wasn't
a war on, nor no fighting nor nothing.
And him Government property too !
“Well, the IBosch is all sorts of things
I won't name in this company, but he
ain't altogether a fool. And if he was
to notice this here canary-bird, Mark I.,
tootling away in No-Man's-Land, he'd
guess we must be digging a tunnel
his feet. At any rate, that's what the
O.C. thought, and he orders six of his
best snipers to get to work on Jim and |
put him out of action.
“So they gets on a fire-step and
brasses off at Jim—six of 'em, mind
you, and all crack shots. But could
they hit him 2 No, Sir, not for toffee
they couldn't. There he was, hopping
about as merry as a midge and chirp-
ing fit to bust. The bullets splashed
all around him, but that didn't make
no odds to Jim ; he didn't care a fig
for them. Well, after the snipers had
had a go, the O.C. gets a Lewis gun to
work. But, bless you, Jim here didn't
give a brass button for it, and you'd
think it was just a gentle shower of
rain pattering around him instead of
solid lead–-yes, you would that. And
nothing happened except that Jim
sang louder than ever, and the Lewis
gunner swore more hearty even than
the snipers.
“Then it came the turn of the
machine guns, and they reckoned they'd
soon put an end to young Jim's
capers. So they started in with their
umpteen bullets a second and fairly
cut the ground from under Jim's feet,
but—you may believe me or believe me
not—he didn't turn a feather. No, Sir,
they might have been throwing bird-
seed at him—only he'd have taken
more notice of that.
“Anyway, the O.C. lost patience at
last. “Send an S.O.S. to the Artillery,’
says he, ‘and see if they can't finish off
that wretched bird.'
“Well, Sir, a battery of six-inch
howitzers switched on to Jim and
blazed away with high explosives, hard
as they could go. And did Jim give a
cuss for their H.E. shells 2 No, Sir, he
did not. The splinters were flying
about him like rice at a wedding, but
he never even made a false note or lost ||
a bar. There—just like he's doing it
now,” shouted the soldier, making him-
self heard above a sudden full-throated
burst of song from the canary.
Everyone perforce had to listen until
the song ceased as suddenly as it had
begun, and Jim turned his attention to
a more pressing matter on his left front.
“Well?” I suggested. -
“Well, Sir, as I was saying, come night
—after snipers, Lewis gun, machine-
guns and siege artillery had all failed—
I crept out into No-Man's-Land and
found this here bird perched on a broken
bit of H.E. shell, fast asleep. I collared
him, and here he is discharged from the
Army.” -
The soldier finished his beer, picked
up his kit and tucked the bird-cage
under his arm. -

REM UNERATIVE RHYMES.

it is stated that Rob ERT TREAT PAINE, the
Boston poet (1773–1811), enjoyed such a repu-
tation “that he could command five dollars a
line for his verse, a price never before ap-
proached in America and perhaps never since
equalled."]

WHEELER,
That you, the blameless Sappho of
the West,
Stricken humanity's most potent healer,
Consoler of the doubting and dis-

Passion's intense, impeccable revealer,
Of all best-sellers quite the very best,
Than TUPPER's self far sweeter and
sublimer,
Were equalled by an early Boston
rhymer ? -
It cannot be that such ecstatic yearning,
Such pure domestic raptures uncon-
trolled,
Such lavish use of old proverbial learn-
1ng,
Of ancient saws cast in a modern
mould,
When measured by the crucial test of
earning,
By market value, reckoned up in gold,
Never secured you, prophetess benign,
More than a bare five dollars to the line.
Tried by this test, how meagre was the
gleaning -
Of MILTON.—just five “jingling ting-
ling quid"
Paid for his I’a radise; but then his
meaning
Was wilfully from artless readers hid;
Besides, he wrote blank verse and from
a leaning
To heresy was never wholly rid;
Your creed is crystal clear and orthodox,
Your rhymes salute us like a postman's
knocks.

That clearly cannot murk your maxi-

The current price of your coelestia mella
Must far surpass that negligible sum;

Believe it, I am sure it cannot come

For one of your incomparable lays.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 13th.-Mr. BALFour in-
troduced a pleasing innovation in Minis-
terial practice. The Pacifist group
showed much interest in Lord Robert
CECIL's recent speech to the American
reporters, and Mr. SNowden was par-
ticularly anxious to know whether the
Foreign SECRETARY agreed with his
subordinate's statement of policy. Mr.
BALFour said he had not discovered
one, and then turning upon his ques-
tioner asked, “IIas he 2''
is it?” Mr. S.Now DEN was
about to jump at this op-
portunity of improving the
Ministerial mind, but the
SPEARER jumped first and
bade him defer his answer
till the debate on the ad-
journment.
Mr. Low THER knows his
own powers to a nicety and
has no desire to enlarge
them. A suggestion that
he should constitute him-
self a censor of Questions
likely to give information
to the enemy was put aside
with the remark that, “as
an ordinary member of the
public I have no know-
ledge of what is desirable
to appear and what is.
not.” So, unless the House
takes the matter into its
own hands and sets up a
Committee of Censorship,
I suppose Mr. and
Mr. will continue to
cumber the Notice-paper
with Questions which,
whether answered or not,
must be read with great
satisfaction at Potsdam.
| Sir WILLIAM WEIR,
though a member of the
Government responsible
to Parliament, is at present a member
of neither House. A position analogous
to that of MAHOMET's coffin is not,
perhaps, altogether inappropriate to
the Head of the Air Force; but Mr.
BonAR LAw intimated that he will
shortly be brought down from it,
though he did not say at which end
of the corridor the landing would be
effected.
Another attempt to get the House
to adopt Proportional Representation
furnished an opportunity for a tribute
of respect to its most consistent cham-
pion, the late Lord CourTNEY. In a
sense his own career was a contradiction
of the argument that special represen-
tation is required for minorities, for,
despite a rugged independence, equally
and “What
clothes, he was returned continuously
to the House of Commons for twenty-
four years.
Freed from the menace of the Whips
the House enjoyed a capital debate.
Mr. HERBERT Fish ER, speaking in his
private capacity and not as Minister of
Education—or, as Mr. Asquith pointed
out, he could never have allowed him-
self the solecism, “the scheme contains
some omissions"—earnestly advocated
the adoption of the strictly-limited
proposals of the Commissioners. Mr.
Asquith's manifest satisfaction that his

beloved Kingdom of Fife was not in-
cluded gave his support of the proposal
rather a perſunctory appearance.
The attack was led by Mr. BURDETT-
Coutts, who roundly declared that
“majorities must govern,” and was
vigorously seconded by Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN, who, though Birmingham was not
one of the Commissioners' corpora culia,
was determined to make assurance
double sure. Sir MARK SYREs poked
much fun at the party organisations and
declared that the Whips' definition of a
crank was “a wealthy man who does
not want a knighthood, or a nobleman
who does not want to be an Under-
Secretary.” But neither arguments
nor epigrams had much effect upon
Members, who had made up their minds
tually “P.R.” was knocked out—for
the fifth and last time in this Parlia-
ment—by 166 votes to 110.
Tuesday, May 14th. —There was
general satisfaction when Mr. MAC-
PHERSON announced that every en-
deavour would be made to grant leave
to soldiers who had spent “two hot
weathers” in Mesopotamia. Only Sir
John REEs demurred. According to
his account the cold weather in that
region is “so bracing" as quite to
counteract the effects of the hot. All
the same I believe the railway authori-
ties have decided to wait
until aſter, the War before
substituting Baghdad for
Skegness in the famous
advertisement.
Mr. HANDEL Booth,
who has popped up again
with unabated resiliency,
was informed that, al-
though Guernsey had
adopted Compulsory Ser-
vice, no provision was
made for Conscientious
Objectors, since the species
hardly exists in the island.
The CHANCELLoR of The
ExchEQUER will please
note the stimulating effect
that cheap tobacco has
upon the moral of an in-
sular people and reconsider
the recent increase in the
tax.
Mr. OUTHwaite was
surprised to learn that the
War Aims Committee has
nothing to do with the
§ cinema film, now being ex-
§º hibited, which depicts the
life-history of the PRIME
MINISTER from the cradle
to the Cabinet. The idea
that the film was designed
by the Inland Revenue
authorities for the purpose
of boosting the Entertainments Tax is
also erroneous.
Hitherto the Allies have declined to
consider the exchange of able-bodied
prisoners on the ground that it would
lengthen the War; but as the French
have altered their minds on the sub-
ject, and have recently made an agree-
ment with the Bosches, Lord NEwton
announced that our Government have
come into line. Good news for our
poor fellows, but some of the well-
fed Teutons at Donnington Hall and
other luxurious retreats will probably
consider it a subtle form of reprisals.

plaint that, owing to the lack of division-
bells, three Members were left out of last
Thursday's division with the airy obser-
vation that he hoped they would have
voted in the wrong lobby.
It was a pity Mr. Hogg E was not
present to hear the reply to his
rather ungracious suggestion that the
MINISTER OF PENSIONs had exceeded
his functions in raising a fund to assist
disabled men to re-establish themselves
in business. It gave Mr. HoDGE an
opportunity of narrating the history of
his fund. Beginning with three hun-
dred pounds raised at a London Club,
with which a legless miner had been
transformed into “a hand-sewn boot-
maker,” it had now risen to ninety
thousand pounds, and had enabled Mr.
HoDGE to put nearly a thousand men
on their financial legs again. The
recital was much cheered, especially the
broad hint at its conclusion that hon.
|Members, instead of carping, should
subscribe.
On the Board of Trade vote Sir
| ALBERT STANLEY reviewed the course
of industry during the War. The aggre-
gate output was now very little less than
it was in 1913, for, though there were
fewer workers, they were working harder
and longer.
The million and a half
women now doing men's work received
much praise, but must nevertheless pay
more for their season-tickets.
ALL my life I have wanted to meet
a real philosopher. Not one of the
academics who occupy chairs of philo-
sophy at universities. They are prob-
ably just as other men in the face of
a broken bootlace or a missed train.
No, my mind ran to the real philosopher
—somebody who keeps his balance and
Serenity when he is suddenly trans-
ported to fresh surroundings, and his
outlook on life, determined by accumu-
lated experience, has to be adjusted
so that he can continue his work un-
disturbed; somebody who can accept
change with perfect goodwill and a
smiling resignation.
Well, I have found my philosopher.
He is of light build, quick in his move-
ments when roused to action, yet with
a capacity for perfect repose; point
device, but without a suspicion of the
dandy; a high-browed shapely head,
with narrow aquiline nose and un-
fathomable brown eyes, the kind that
are called soulful by the lady-serialist.
Since his earliest days he has been
brought up to serve and to rule a
Section of the community whose lives
are commonly laid in open and lonely
places, far from the hustling crowd and
yet contributing an almost vital share

To-day he finds himself set down
within three miles of Charing Cross,
remote from the wide skies and rolling
downs which his soul loves; faced with
the same problems, but under what
altered conditions.
Yet is my philosopher entirely serene,
wholly philosophical. I watch him
closely. His quick eyes and ready in-
telligence scarcely seem to wander for
a moment; you can see that his mind
is still solely occupied with the care of
those committed to his charge. The
roar of the passing motor-buses, the
murmur of the populace, the prattle of
children, he heeds them not; the blan-
dishments of a frivolous world are lost
upon him. Gravely courteous to those
who actually intrude upon his task,
yet endlessly aloof, absorbed in his one
subject.
I don't suppose he ever read a word
of MARCUs AURELIUS ; he can write
no degree after his name; he would not

philosopher for all that, as you may see
for yourselves—Gyp, the very perfect
gentle collie dog who guards the sheep
grazing amongst the railings and peram-
bulators of Kensington Gardens.

ringing cheer from the onlookers."—The Scout.
We are not surprised.
“It has been decided to release tripe, which
includes “sheep's paunches' . . . from the
meat ration . . . This concession, together
with the release of low-grade flour for biscuits,
will make the position of sheep and sporting
dogs secure.”—Times.
This new security which our sheep (as
indicated in the last sentence) are to
enjoy seems to follow directly upon the
release of their paunches from the meat
ration ; and it is hoped that with the
reduction of losses by submarines this
emancipation may eventually be ex-

to the needs of the nation.

334 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[May 22, 1918.
FELINE CHIVALRY.
WE have received some interesting information with
regard to a remarkable movement which has been for some
little time in progress in this country. Our informant is a
gentleman whom we have long known and whose bona fides
has been proved on many an occasion. Even with this
assurance we can well believe that some of our readers who
have not had our opportunities of testing the veracity of our
informant will be disposed to treat our news as one of those
“stunts” in which the journalism of the present day so fre-
quently indulges. We desire to affirm in the strongest pos-
sible manner that we believe our information to be absolutely
trustworthy. -
Briefly, then, what we have been told is this: The cats
of England have been roused to indignation by the appeals
which have recently been made on behalf of our dogs.
Those who so lightly have suggested that the dogs of Eng-
land should be starved out of existence will perhaps pause
in their mad career when they know that cats have put
aside their age-long traditions of animosity and are even
now ready to make common cause with their secular enemies.
You cannot, as our informant said, tell what is going to
happen next. If those who have started the campaign
against dogs should have even the slightest success, the
inevitable consequence will be that they will turn their
attention to cats, and will demand the sacrifice of animals
whose only fault is a belief in the kindness and magnani-
mity of man. The cats have therefore decided to form a close
association with their hereditary foes and to support them
with all the power of their claws in this crisis of their fate.
They have formed a Cynophil League, the object of which
is to defend the existence of dogs. This new league, we
understand, was inaugurated at a meeting held in the
Tilehurst Room of the Feline Central Hall. The meet-
ing was a large and representative one. The IHonourable
Thomas Carabas, the last scion of the bluest blood of
Catland, was voted to the Chair, and proceedings began
with the singing of “Discordia,” the cats' National Anthem.
After the enthusiasm called forth by this chorus had to
some extent subsided the Chaircat began his speech, ex-
plaining the objects of the League and the absolute need
for its existence. They all knew, he said, that dogs were
blundering animals. (“Wow, wow!” from a Great Dane
who had somehow secured admission.) His honourable
friend would not, he was sure, misunderstand him. No-
body had a livelier admiration for dogs at a distance than
he, the Chaircat, and he begged to assure the interrupter
that he himself was prepared to go all lengths for the
defence even of a Yorkshire Terrier. These attacks on dogs
were certainly the preface to the elimination of cats. Jam
proacimus ardet Ucalegon. (“Now construe,” from a Persian
Tom.) He referred the honourable gentleman to a dictionary
of quotations. For himself, he had decided not to purr for
a month unless something were done to show the detesta-
tion and loathing with which every true cat must regard
such base and unc thy proceedings. He begged to move
the first resolution, stating the necessity for the League and
appointing a committee.
This was seconded in a few words by Lady Mary Musci-
pula, and was supported by Lord Meux, and was carried mem.
com. amid a scene of unparalleled excitement, a young cat
being heard to declare that he had decided to place his first
mouse at the disposal of the committee for use in relieving a
distressed Fox-Terrier of his acquaintance. We may have
further statements to make with regard to the League, but
we feel sure that our readers will agree with us when we
say that it is no small thing to have united in bonds of
LIEUTENANT SHELLBACK, R.N.R.
HE has learnt the ways of the ships at sea
In most of the sorts of ships there be—
In most of the kinds of deep-sea craft,
Steam and square-sail and fore-and-aft,
A Liverpool crack and a London barque
As bluff as a barge and as old as the Ark,
A tramp, a tanker, a Yankee schooner,
He ‘s served in all of 'em later or sooner. . . .
And there isn't a build and there isn't a rig,
Be it fast or slow or little or big,
From Chapman Light to the Bay of Bengal,
But Lieutenant Shellback knows 'em all.
He has learnt the ways of the seas that roll,
Broad and narrow and deep and shoal,
Gulf and channel and bight and strait
From the Barrier Reef to the Golden Gate;
He has learnt the ways of the winds that blow
Off palm and coral and Polar snow,
The typhoon sweeping the China seas,
And the Trades and the stormy westerlies. . . .
And there isn't a port the wide world round,
From London River to Puget Sound,
From Sand Heads Light to Wallipo Bay
13ut Lieutenant Shellback's passed that way.
And some he learnt from an old-style skipper
That once cracked on in a China clipper,
And a blue-nose mate like a live cyclone,
All fist and boot and muscle and bone;
To reef and furl and hand and steer
He knew full well by his seventeenth year,
To liſt a chantey and patch and darn,
And carve a model and spin a yarn. . . .
And there wasn't so much those old salts knew,
“Sails” and bo'sun, skipper and crew,
From trimming yards to a fancy knot,
Dut Lieutenant Shellback learnt the lot.
But he learnt the most, when all's been told,
Where his fathers learnt the same of old,
In the sun and storm, in the wind and rain,
Twice round the world and home again.
He learnt it here and he learnt it there,
He learnt it foul and he learnt it fair,
Both inside out and upside down,
'Tween the Tail o' the Bank and Frisco town. . .
And there isn't a death that sailors dare
From Carrick Roads to the Straits of Le Mair,
Nor a kind of a risk that seamen run
I3ut Lieutenant Shellback's faced each one.
That's what has made him tried and true,
IIardened and tested and proved him too;
Born and bred to the sailor's trade,
Hemp to the core and cable-laid,
Like the nine-strand stuff that a seaman knows

Mess Orderly. “It's ALL RIGHT, BILL; THEY’RE THE DIRTY ONEs."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I THINK that one of the reasons for Miss MARJoBIE
BowFN's success with historical romance must be sought
in her sense of actual colour. Again and again you will
find her writing in pictures, so that the mind's eye is
continually at work illustrating her vivid phrases. This
capacity has full play in her latest story, Kings-at-Arms
(METHUEN), which concerns the campaigns and varying
fortunes of three monarchs, PETER of Russia, AUGUSTU's
of Saxony, and especially that amazing young man,
CHARLEs XII. of Sweden. This last portrait of the King
who “was like an animal—or a god” in his superb, almost
inhuman calm, is one of the finest and most haunting
pictures in Miss Bowen's gallery. There is here nothing
about him that can be called an arranged plot; facts rule,
and the facts concerning CHARLEs of Sweden are certainly
stranger than most fiction. Episodical love-interest you
get in the two women who controlled the destinies of his
rivals, and one of whom, the voN KoeNIGSMARCK, made so
conspicuous a failure of her attempt upon CHARLEs himself.
But for the rest Miss BowFN has been content to rely for
interest upon the figure of her superman and upon her
power of restoring the faded hues to which it has been
reduced in the tapestry of history. The result is a series of
scenes that have an added interest now, as dealing mostly
with the profession of arms in the old chivalrous and pre-
Prussian days. My best congratulations to the author,
I can start off cheerfully about Sunshine Settlers {º.
by saying that it certainly lives up to its title. In other
words, the author, Mr. CRosBIE GARSTIN, has written a
book of genuine open-air humour, whose unforced gaiety
will keep you amused from the first page to the last. The
settlement is South African, and the time immediately
before the War; which indeed breaks out in the final
chapters (as not infrequently with modern fiction) and
enables the three chief characters to carry their good spirits
to Flanders. But it is their life in Africa that makes up
the greater part of the book—the flora and fauna of their
surroundings, their servants, pets, sports (including donkey-
polo) and adventures generally. I hazard a guess that
Mr. GARSTIN is himself an animal-lover—the sympathy
with which he writes about dogs and the pleasant anecdote
of the infant antelope and the held-up express would alone
prove as much. Naturally no funny book can be at its
highest level on every page, and now and then you may
find the sunshine of the settlers a trifle overcast; but at its
best it is both grateful and comforting. Mr. GARSTIN is
destined for popularity with those wise readers who treasure
the memory of laughter. I may add that he displays, as
it were thrown in, a very pretty turn for occasional verse.
My trouble with Lady STANLEY's story of Miss Pim's
Camouflage (HUTCHINSON) is that it is an attempt to mix
farce and tragedy in a method only possible for dreams; to
which category of course the idea of Miss Pim and her
invisibility really belongs. Indeed, I suppose we have
most of us dreamed it for ourselves more than once during
the War, as an alternative to exploding Essen with a secret
ray, or capturing the All-Frightfullest, or any other of
the flattering tales that sleep can whisper to the pillowed
patriot. In dreamland all things are possible—and con-

gruous; but when Lady STANLEY transfers her vision of
the gentle English spinster, who can render herself invisible
at will, and is sent to Germany as a spy, from the unsub-
stantial fabric that is its proper medium to the solidity of
print, at once difficulties appear. Of course as imagination
the idea is glorious fun; and nothing that you can expect
in the way of adventure for so well equipped a heroine is
denied you. Submarine plans, details of HINDENBURG's
scheme of retreat, even the most private papers from the
Imperial library, are hers for the taking; nor is anyone
allowed to knock at her door with hot water (a contre-
temps that has irretrievably damaged similar exploits of
my own) before the fruits of victorious daring are safely
garnered and conveyed to the English command. But,
here at last I reach my objection: pleasant monsense like
this simply will not mix with the horrors of German besti-
ality. They call up an atmosphere of loathing in which
no dream can live. All of which comes perhaps to no more
than this, that the reader who looks, and not in vain, to
you they'll say when they find him held in matrimonial
leash by the wench of the tailor of Wantage?” Anyway
I began to suspect that the author was really not an
authentic tusher, and I was confirmed in this impression
when I found myself following the adventures of the
naughty James rather as a matter of duty than from a
tormenting desire to know what happened. What did
happen was that, after playing a lot of scurvy tricks on
all and sun iry, he got tired of piracy and squinting down
his nose at folk, and became master-gunner on Admiral
BENBow's good ship Breda, quitted him like a man and a
true bart.'s son, and went to his account with an excellent
final entry on the credit side.
-
Mr. Webster and Others (CoLLINs) is the title of a small
and inexpensive volume, in which Mrs. W. K. CLIFFord has
assembled ten short stories, four of which are enjoying the
dignity of book-form for the second time, and all (I sup-
pose, but am not sure) have previously appeared in print.

The British heroine of In
Russia's Night (CoLLINs)

country-house and married
the son of her hostess before,
she knew anything about
Russian or any other kind
of life. I found her too nega-
tive for my taste; was neither
intrigued by her failure to
love her husband nor im-
pressed by her precipitate
infatuation for another man.
On the other hand, Dmitri
Annenkov, her casual and
unfaithful spouse, is extra-
ordinarily well-drawn. The
scene of the story is trans-
ferred from Russia to Flor-
ence, and there Dmitri and

things happen. It is not OLIVE GARNETT's fault that these
events, reviewed in the light of to-day, seem very mild and
insignificant. One feels instinctively that she understands
the temperament of the Russian, and one is inclined to accept
her evidence that his craving for liberty might have been
appeased by ordinary liberal measures. As a novel Mrs.
GARNETT's book is in certain respects unsatisfactory, but the
sincerity of her attempt to deal with questions of the first
importance gives it a value beyond many better romances.
I am much prejudiced in favour of books which open
like The Wasp (HoddRR AND Stoughton) of Mr. THEoDoRE
G. Roberts: “James Burnham had been in London a
matter of three weeks when, one October morning in the
year 1698, he stepped into the doorway of a Cheapside
shop to let a company of jail-birds from Newgate go by
with their guards.” James was a bad hat, though the son
of a baronet, and had white rages and frightened people

OUR NEUTRAL NATIONALISTS.
[In a recent interview with the New York Press the Leader of the
Irish Nationalist Party is reported to have said, “We believe that the
cause of the Allies is the cause of Freedom throughout the world.”
At the same time, while repudiating the policy of the Sinn Feiners,
he admitted that he had co-operated with them in their resistance
to the demand that Ireland should defend the cause of Freedom.]

Of men with treason-germs infected 2

Leaned to his felon lips and kissed him,
Smiled on his flag, together banned
The law that threatened to enlist him,
And cursed the tyrant when he came
And conjured us to fight in Freedom's name.

D.A.M. N.
A NIGHTMARE OF 192—.
D.A.M.N.—or, to give it its full though less expressive
title, “The Department for Abating Ministerial Nuisances”
—came into existence about the tenth year of the War, to
combat the predatory onslaughts of the Accommodation
Committees of the various Ministries.
It was set up by the Government as a result of the popular
outcry raised at the eviction, at three hours' notice, of the
Royal Family from Buckingham Palace, to make way for
the Minister of Inter-Departmental Warfare, a functionary
whose activities were first brought to public notice when
the Premier raised him to Cabinet rank for his services in
saving the Treasury offices from an enveloping movement
of the Ministry of Munitions—this department having
secured a footing in Downing Street and begun conduct-
ing a simultaneous drive southward from the Admiralty
Arch.
The growth of Government departments had been allowed
too long to continue unchecked, until it had become no
uncommon event for whole sections of a department to
lose touch with their headquarters and to establish them-
selves in outlying parts of the Metropolis, whence they
harried the unfortunate inhabitants with requisitions for
accommodation and forced labour. In the early years of
the War the provision of accommodation for Government
but latterly departments had taken matters into their own
hands, and, having furniture no longer provided for them
and being unable to obtain sufficient staff by voluntary
methods, they had adopted the easier course of com-
mandeering houses with their contents and even their
occupants.
To combat this state of affairs D.A.M.N. was founded;
but it differed in many respects from any other department
created during the War, and in every respect from any
department created in pre-war days. To begin with, its
birth was not heralded by any Press notices; further, it
had no generally recognised headquarters, and its staff was
almost exclusively composed of burglars, house-breakers
and other men nimble with their fingers. Finally it cost
the public little or nothing, and its actions, whenever they
were brought to light, met with unfailing public approval.
The business of D.A.M.N. was to lop-off the numerous
and unnecessary excrescences of Government departments
and to reduce them to the limits of efficiency and usefulness,
and its method was somewhat as follows: The particular
branch or section or group of sections to be “lopped " was
first of all isolated from its headquarters by the simple
expedients of disconnecting the telephone wires and com-
mandeering the fleet of motor-cars standing in serried ranks
about its doors. This done, the next step would be for a
special squad of D.A.M.N. representatives, introduced into
the building in the guise of furniture removers, to win over
or, if need be, to overpower (for violent methods had become
usual in those days) the registry and messenger staffs.
Pandemonium would then ensue for a short time, as tele-
phones were vainly rung and rung again, while urgent
papers piled themselves in every “out” tray and drifted like
snow on to the floors. Within an hour however the work
of the “isolated '' branch would have come to a standstill,
and that work being of interest to no one but itself it
would be no one's concern to set it going again. With a
final powdering of noses the staff would sadly and silently
vanish away, and D.A.M.N. would then proceed quietly
but effectually to eliminate all traces of their previous
occupation. -
As no accurate statistics had ever been compiled of the
personnel and offices of the larger Ministries, it is not easy
to convey an accurate impression of the magnitude of the
task accomplished by D.A.M.N. from its creation up to the
present time. It may, however, be of interest to record
that the Ministry of Munitions has been restricted to two
palaces, three railway termini, fourteen hotels and ten
streets of houses, and that in the process a male staff
equal to two Army Corps and a female staff sufficient to
form ten divisions of W.A.A.C.'s have been made available
for work of national importance, and sufficient petrol has
been saved to restart the majority of the motor omnibus
services in London.
The Air Ministry too has been pruned down to such an
extent that it is hoped that St. Paul's Cathedral and one or
more museums may shortly be reopened to the public, and
that the headquarters .* may not be greatly in excess of
the numbers of the R.A.F. in the field.
Lastly, with the reductions recently effected at the
Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office, Board of Trade, etc.,
it is confidently expected that parts of St. James, the Green
and Hyde Parks, together with some sections of the Em-
bankment, will be permitted to resume their normal functions
as “lungs” of the Metropolis. -

deplorable, were not without reason,

trumpets, tootling the salute, and a
dazzle of gold and scarlet, like a TURNER
sunset, blazed into view—the General
and his Staff. -
At the same moment Antonio Giuseppe
espied us from his observation post and,
getting it into his head that we were
picnicing out (it was about lunch-time),
hastened to join us. As the General
reached the leading squadron Antonio
Giuseppe reached the near squadron
and, sliding unobtrusively into its ranks,
looked about for the hay-nets.
However the Second in Command
noticed his arrival and motioned to his
trumpeter. The trumpeter spurred for-
ward and pinked Antonio Giuseppe in
the hindquarters with his sword-point
as a hint to him to move on. Antonio,
thinking the line-guards were upon
him and with a new type of broom,
loosed a squeal of agony and straight-
way commenced his puss-in-the-corner
antics in and out and round about the
horses' legs. They didn't like it at all;
it tickled and upset them; they changed
from the horizontal to the vertical,
giggled and pawed the air.
Things were becoming serious. A hee-
hawing tatterdemalion donkey, playing
“ring o' roses” with a squadron of war-
horses, tickling them into hysterics,
casions and is no fit spectacle for a
General. A second trumpeter joined
in the chase and scored a direct prick
on the soft of Antonio Giuseppe's nose
as he dived out under the tail of a
plunging gun-mare. Antonio whipped
about and fled towards the contre
squadron, ears wobbling, braying an-
guished S.O.S.S. The two trumpeters,
young and ardent lads, thundered after
him, swords at the engage, racing each
other, knee to knee for first blood. They
scored simultaneously on the butt of
his tail, and Antonio, stung to the quick,
shot clean through (or rather under)
the centre squadron into the legs of the
General's horse, tripping up that ma-
jestic animal and bringing the whole
stately edifice ruining down into a
particularly muddy patch of Italy.
Tremendous and awful moment' As
my groom and countryman expressed
it, “Ye cud hear the silence for miles.”
The General did not break it. I think
his mouth was too full of mud and
loose teeth for words. He arose slowly
out of the ooze like an old walrus lift-
ing through a bed of seaweed black as
and limped grimly from the field, fol-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MATTER OF PRECEDENCE.
Touisa is greatly distressed. She
tells me she will never have another
moment's peace until the War is over,
and she is inclined, unreasonably I
think, to blame my conduct in the
matter. Recalling the quite uncommon
circumstances I do not see how a man
of honour and chivalry could have acted
otherwise than as I did.
Briefly, the facts are these. Louisa
is a slave to superstition. Not a day
passes but she does something or
refrains from doing something else with
the notion of averting misfortune from
herself and her faumily. Naturally I
smile at her childishness, but since our
only son, Gerald, went to Flanders I
have so far humoured her as to cease
using my portable shaving mirror, to
make doubly secure our hanging pic-
tures, to avoid spilling the salt, or,
having spilt it, to throw a pinch over
my left shoulder, to remove my glasses
before bowing to the new moon, and to
forbid admittance into the house of any
sprigs of black or white thorn.
Having indulged her whims to this
extent it was but natural I should go a
step further. When Louisa was laid up
with bronchial asthma this spring and
was prevented from following her usual
custom of going out into the country to
hear the call of the cuckoo and there-
upon at once opening a gate to “let in
the luck,” I volunteered to go instead.
Louisa was greatly relieved. “You’re
almost sure to hear it round Hammer
Down Copse,” she said, “and there's a
gate close by leading to a farm. When
you hear it—just one 'Cuckoo'—don't
lose a moment; run to the gate and
open it. Think of our boy and open it
wide and let in all the luck.”
It was nonsense, of course, but, after
all, opening a gate is a very simple
matter, and I am not the man to shirk
a promise to a wife with bronchial
asthma and a boy in Flanders.
I set out for Hammer Down Copse.
For seven evenings in succession I sat
on the gate leading to the farm ready
to jump down and fling it wide open at
the sound of the spirit voice. But no
cuckoo broke the silence.
Touisa was in despair. “Try Dipper
Dell,” she said. I tried it. It was a
balmy night, a trifle warm for walking.
I took it easily. I was barely fifty
yards from the spot when suddenly the
clear soft call, “ Cuckoo,” was waſted
to my ears, and facing me, leading to
the dell, I saw a five-barred gate.
I ran. I have never run so hard
since I ran for the doctor when Gerald
was born. I took the road in leaps.
But out of the dell's green depths came
full fifteen years my senior. And he
also leapt.
We met across the gate. The intro-
duction was abrupt, and we were both
temporarily short of breath. The gate
was fastened in the usual simple fashion
of country gates. To open it one had
merely to jerk it upwards on its hinges.
I was about to do so when, with the
agility of a monkey, this venerable
gentleman climbed upon it and hung
with all his weight across the topmost
bar. With as much gentleness as was
consistent with firmness I took him by
the shoulders and obliged him to de-
scend. Instantly he attempted to raise
the gate. There was no alternative but
to assume a leaning position over the top
bar myself. With a dexterity beyond
his years he succeeded in dislodging me.
The situation threatened to become
undignified. I addressed myself to him
with quiet appeal. “Sir," I said, “I
have a son at the Front. Need I ad-
vance a further claim 2"
“One son " " he replied. “I have
three, and my youngest just going.”
And Louisa blames me because I
turned home without a word and left
him to open the gate.
THE SUM OF CHIVALRY.
WHAT shall be said of him, your friend,
That very perfect gentle knight
Whose fair life, crown'd with such an
end,
No graven scroll could praise aright?
There is a simple line can tell
Of the great spirit proud and free,
Whose steadfast vision still would dwell
Upon the star of Courtesy.
No shining warrior prince of old
Whose glory lit the knightly days
But this brief epitaph had told
The perfect measure of his praise.
Yet him we mourn a courage graced
That finds no ancient counterpart;
What knew they of the deaths he faced
With laughter from a boyish heart?
There needs no marble; just the small
Rude cross of wood that soldiers rear,
And this for proud memorial,
An English Gentleman lies here.

CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER LXXVIII.
Richard. Tell us something more
about the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, Mamma, and the great
reconciliation between them in this
period.
Mrs. M. Very well; but it is a long
story. The antagonism between them
was mostly friendly and was expressed
in athletic contests, but it occasionally
led to harsh mutual criticism. Thus
it was said, on the one hand, that
Oxford could only produce a manner
and a marmalade, and, on the other,
that Cambridge was only famous for
sums and sausages. -
Mary. Well, I think that sausages
and marmalade are both very good
things. But I hate sums and I don't
understand what you mean by a
in annel”.
Mrs. M. My dear child, it is not
seemly to speak of food with such
enthusiasm, and by abusing arithmetic
you render yourself ridiculous. But as
you ask for information on the subject
of the Oxford manner I will endeavour
to enlighten your ignorance. It was
supposed to reflect a consciousness of
intellectual superiority to those who
had been educated elsewhere, and un-
doubtedly in some instances caused
considerable irritation, especially as the
majority of the great poets were edu-
cated at Cambridge, while three of the
most distinguished bards who entered
Oxford — SHELLEY, Sw1NBURNE and
CALVERLEY-found the conditions so
uncongenial to the development of their
talents that they left or were obliged to
leave without obtaining a degree. I
am bound to admit, however, that two
out of the three were decidedly uncon-
ventional—I had almost said Pagan–
in their opinions.
George. Well, give me CALVERLEY
every time.
Mrs. M. Your expressions are rather
odd, but the sentiment is defensible.
CALVERLEY, as you perhaps know,
migrated to Cambridge, where he had
a brilliant academic career. But to
revert to this criticism of Oxford, I find
it expressed in a most pointed manner
in the writings of an eminent Cambridge
professor of the period, BATEsoN by
name, who, after complaining of the
neglect of science by the sister univer-
sity, traces the evil back to the public
schools. “Boys who are marked out
as leaders,” he observes, “rarely have
much instinct for science and avoid
such teaching, finding it irksome or
unsatisfying.” And the Professor con-
tinues: “These it is who, going after-
a man, a bent and grey-haired man,
wards to the Universities, in preponder-
specially invited.

BATEsox's indictment was rather unfor-

up in a noble emulation which turned
all the undergraduates into fighting-

Berlin that, “with the exception of the

the Government to go away for the

absolved the recruits from all blame.

THE NEW SPIRIT IN SPORT.
[Being a few extracts from the papers of the
near future, illustrating novel
in war-time sport.]
“The Clydeside Rivetters' Cup Final
was played at Dalmuir yesterday before
a crowd of sixteen thousand, and re-
sulted in a draw. Fairfield Furies, who
started favourites, gave a great display,
putting up a score of one hundred-and-
fifty thousand rivets, MacAndrew being
top-scorer with eight thousand, which
places him at the head of the averages.
Set an almost impossible task to win,
Brown's Bustlers (Clydebank) tackled
the proposition brilliantly, and stood a
good chance of drawing level when the
supply of ships ran out, and as nothing
other than rivetting on ship-
board is allowed under Lloyd's *
rules the game was abandoned.
We understand that three mem-
bers of the Fairfield team have
been selected to represent Great
Britain against the American
team that is to come over next
month and attempt to recover
the cinders.”
“Greater public interest than
ever is being displayed in the

opened yesterday in the North

passenger liners crowded with
enthusiastic spectators accom-
panied the Fleet, and betting

WHAT THE SUN DIDN'T SEE_
FOR FAR TOO LONG.
“ONCE upon a time,” said the Sun,
who has lately been in a very good
humour and full of stories, “there was
a meadow surrounded by a flint wall,
where I caused the buttercups to shine
like burnished gold, and where the
grass was high and green and as long
as the pony and the donkey who in-
habited the meadow would allow it to
be. Here and there was a cowslip;
while near the house were hen-coops
with old hens in them whose anxious
heads protruded through the bars quer-
ulously shouting instructions to their
fluffy children.
“Such,” said the Sun, “was the
meadow, which was interesting to me
chiefly because it was the playground of
a small but very vigorous and restless
boy named Nobby, whose merry in-
quiring face it gave me peculiar pleasure
to tan and freckle.
“A small boy,” said the Sun, “can
do a thousand things in a meadow like
this, even without the company of a
donkey and a pony, and Nobby did them
all; while his collection of performing

even an aeroplane manoeuvring in the

lure both to young and old—but no
Nobby. The wood-lice crept about or
rolled themselves into balls, all un-
noticed and immune.
“This is very odd, I heard the pony
say; “he's never neglected us before.’
“‘Passing strange,' said the donkey,
who at times affected archaistic speech.
‘And on so fair a morn too."
“So saying they resumed their
eternal meal, but continually turned
their eyes to the garden-gate through
which Nobby would have to pass. I also
kept my eyes wide for him ; but all in
vain; and what made it more perplex-
ing was that Nobby's mother came in
and fed the chickens, and Nobby's aunt
came in with a rug and a book and
settled down to be comfortable; and
that meant that the boy was not absent
on a visit to the town, because one of
them would have gone too. -
“‘That settles it,” said the donkey
who had, for an ass, quite a lot of sense;
‘Nobby is ill.'

in bed, because that morning he had
sneezed—not through looking up at me,
but for no reason at all—and his mother,
who was a very careful mother, had at
once fetched the clinical thermometer
and taken his temperature, and behold
it was a hundred. So Nobby was not
allowed to get up, but now lay there
watching my rays pouring into the room,
and listening to the buzz of the aero-
plane, and longing to be out in the
meadow with the donkey and the pony
and the woodlice.
“That, however, would never do; for
‘It all comes,’ his mother had said, ‘of
sitting about in that long grass so
much, and so early in the year too '—
a line of argument hardly likely to
appeal to a small and vigorous boy who
does not reckon summer by dates and
to whom prudence is as remote as
Treasury notes.

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“PRESS THE BUTTON.”
“A little nonsense now and then
is relished by the wisest men.” Gaily
quoting this remark, to ease his con-
science, Mr. Robert HICHENs proceeds
to unbend in a Three-Act “absurdity”
of incredible boisterousness. Let no one
complain that he does not give full
measure. The house “literally” rocked
with laughter, as the artless reporter
has it.
Lord and Lady Anthony Fitzurse are
leading a perfectly intolerable life in
their luxurious Park Lane mansion,
completely under the thumbs of their
butler, Maynard, a sinister fellow with
an evil eyebrow, parchment complexion,
thin lips, elastic-sided boots and white
socks. Relief suggests itself in the form
of an installation of the automatic de-
vices of one Talbot Bulstrode, whereby
the affluent householder, pressing but-
tons labelled “Make bed,” “Put on
coals,” “Spread dust-sheets,” “Bring
rich food from ForTNUM AND MASON's,"
can run his establishment with no
more than a cook and a clever char.
(I suspect the char was introduced as
an excuse for bringing in Miss Poi.1.11.
EMERY. Good idea too.)
Here obviously is material for fun of a
jolly primitive kind. It was seasoned by
the introduction of a lady of wayward
impulses, Ec-Queen of the Paradise
Islands, the complexity of whose flirta-
tions had apparently scandalised even
the islanders to the point of deposing
her. She falls in love with the master-
ful Maynard, and when I tell you that
Miss Lott IE WENNE is cast for this
engaging part you can picture the pos-
sibilities of the situation. After much
play with Bulstrode's apparatus, which
the inventor had perversely arranged
so that it could be thrown out of gear
at will to the extent, for example, of
delivering great quantities of coal when
you pressed for “rich food," the indomi-
table Maynard, who has discovered Bul-
strode's disconcerting contrivance, re-
mains in possession, and all (for reasons
unexplained) is peace in 1’ark Lane.
It was sporting of Miss MARIE LöHR
to give us this absurdity, seeing that
constant racket and ludicrous situations
do not tend to show a pretty woman
at her best. She carried off her part
with a lively air that helped to pull the
joke through successfully. Mr. ALIAN
AYNEsworth spread himself over his
make-up (the other way about, really,
but you know what I mean) and pro-
duced a genuine triumph in the way of
a bizarre butler. This is a real creation
of Mr. HICHENs, but Mr. AYNEsworth,
who always manages to convey that
thoroughly enjoying himself, must share
the credit with him.
Miss Lottle VI:NNE as the susceptible
ex-queen, asking if every noise (and there
were plenty of them) was a revolution,
continuing to hint at the depths of
naughtiness in the Paradise Islands,
and pursuing with a perfect shameless-
ness the queer object of her affections,
was at her excellent best. Mr. E. M.
Robson as Bulstrode, a little Cockney of
gorgeous effrontery, inventor, burglar
and blackmailer; Mr. STANLEY CookE
as a dyspeptic chauffeur, and Miss
Polli E.I.M.ERY as the perfect char, kept
the fun going with gust and ability.
I think perhaps that you need to bring
some high spirits of your own to keep
up with all this to the very end, but if
you can do that you will go away
refreshed by a couple of hours of easy
laughter. And it is emphatically the
kind of piece that will improve with
frequent playing and the acquired slick-
ness so essential to noisy farce. I ought
to add, in justice to a deserving and too
little appreciated body of craftsmen, that
the stage carpenters did their share of
the business quite admirably. T.

Land Worker. “You ToI.D ME TO BE SURE TO USE A ‘DANDY BRUSH," AND THIs Is THE DANDIEST I could FIND.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. FREDERIC Col.BMAN is the gallant American gentle-
man who, immediately upon the outbreak of the War,
volunteered for service with the British Army, and thence-
forward was seen wherever shells came thickest and ex-
plosives were highest, driving into every imaginable danger.
Emerging unimpaired, he wrote, with incredible rapidity,
two books which are amongst the best of those deal-
ing with the early phases of the War on the Western
Front. It then occurred to him to go to Siberia and to
Japan, and to embody his experiences in ancther book,
which is entitled Japan Moves North (CASSELL). Mr. Cole-
MAN advocates the sending of Japanese troops under certain
conditions to Siberia; but he points out that Japan is not
in the War for the attainment of vague objects. It is
necessary for Western statesmen to walk very warily in
their dealings with this proud and efficient country, and
Mr. ColeMAN's book will help them to clear their minds.
It is a lively record and stuffed full with information.
Here, by the way, is an episode from a chapter on Russian
discipline. Mr. CoIEMAN was being rowed out from Port
Arthur to a Russian man-of-war—this was long before the
Revolution. He was seated beside the coxswain and on
his other side sat a Russian officer. The question of
discipline was being discussed, and Mr. Col.BMAN made
some reference to the well-trained crew which was convey-
ing them. “To illustrate just what he meant by discipline
man full in the face with his clenchod fist. I winced,” says
Mr. Col.EMAN, “as though I had been the one struck.”
The coxswain however took the blow unflinchingly, and the
officer struck him again twice. “Blood ran down the face
of the man at the tiller, but he set his lips and with his
eyes straight ahead kept his hands on the tiller-ropes.”
Mr. CoI.EMAN lost his temper, and is of opinion that such
incidents go far to explain why there is now a relaxation of
discipline in the Russian forces.
It seems to me that the life of a King's Messenger, in
fiction especially, is full of difficulties. For one thing a
capacity of unstaled wonder must be his. It must per-
petually astonish him that the attractive young female
traveller who shares his compartment proves, if unsus-
pected, to have designs upon his luggage; and, contrariwise,
should he detect in her a sinister purpose, will almost
invariably turn out to be a friend in disguise. I have been
prompted to these conclusions by a book called The Ited
Passport (CHAPMAN AND HALL), in which Sir John Foster
FRASER has collected a number of stories relating the ad-
ventures of one Gresham, carrier of despatches. The
tales are quite brisk and lively little affairs, suffering of
course slightly from the fact that, while the settings vary,
the style of the intrigue is of necessity liable to repeat
itself. Indeed, for my own part I found my chief pleasure
in the scenes. Sir John FRASER, like Cupid, is winged and
doth range, and the wanderings of his hero, from Malta to
Mandalay, provide incidentally a flavour of Imperialism



the officer turned towards the coxswain and struck the
very agreeable. If I had to select any one as best, I think

that is another story, or rather a variant of one of those
indicated above. I am afraid I shall have to put down
despatch-carrying as among the monotonous professions;
though this is by no means to say that I found the book
about it a dull one.
Penny Scot's Treasure (CoLLINs) is an unambitious and
agreeable mixture of love, blood, humour and adventure in
wilder Canada, blended by Mr. FREDERICK NIVEN’s practised
hand. Any wholesome boy from sixteen to sixty should find
it entertaining, and, as the War, with its swift creation of
professional and respected tomboys, will make many a
strenuous maid less content than before with the old Gar-
vician formula, our author should increase his circulation.
Penny Scot was a canny prospector who died out on the
road, and big blond Norseman Olson and his friend
Jefferies follow up his track in the hope of discovering a
cached hoard. They find more than

Indian maid who for sudden
love of the blond giant sets
out to warn him at great
peril to herself. All ends
well, with wealth quickly
gotten—the destined end
of all pioneering romance.
The two heroes determine
never to do a stroke of work
for the rest of their lives—
a dull and immoral conclu--
sion, I am afraid. . . . In

asides are refreshing.

resolved that Timothy should be removed from his father's
influence. As the approaches to his son were practically
mined against him and his wife avoided him as much as
possible, one is forced to entertain some sympathy for
the indefensible Mr. Deyne; and indeed the author is no
advocate, but puts the case with a refreshing impartiality
and a fine disregard for popular taste. In some essential
they bargained for. features this is a remarkable book. The author sees with-
out flinching the sadness of
the world as it is to-day, but
she also sees the splendour
of it. Through these Twelve
Birthdays, which are hap-
pily not consecutive, we
have the advantageoffollow-
ing Timothy from cradle to
camp—and after. At Eton
he gave me a momentary
shock. Even to-day—and
this was a dozen years before
we talked like that—surely
no Etonian would describe
his school as “some place.”
At any rate I hope not.
The affairs of those who
try to climb into American
high society—" high” is
"PLEASE, Dappy, Polus not quite the correct word;
is called Americanese. It -
comes from Swift's Gulliver's Travels.”
I admit a certain hesitation over The Humphries Touch
(CoLLINs). There were moments when the central idea
tickled me so pleasantly that I had to smile aloud. It was
then that I would give it the higher praise of a comparison
with Vice Versa. But again there were moments, nay
half-hours, when I became conscious that Mr. FREDERICK
WATson was playing a little too obviously for farce at any
price, and buying his laughs at the expense of all coherence.
The main theme is, as I say, excellently promising; the
introduction to an ancient and ultra-conservative public
school of a small boy with a genius for, and much experi-
ence of, stock-manipulation gives scope for any quantity of
admirable fooling, not the less funny for being all of it a
little obvious. George Andrews, with his entirely mature
outlook and vocabulary, facing the perils of an existence
which he regards as at once barbarous and contemptible,
will inevitably remind you of the deathless Bultitude.
Even better than George Andrews (in whom, of course, one
can never really believe) are some quite brilliant caricatures
of certain magisterial types, from the head downwards.
Upon them Mr. WATson has exercised so nimble and
caustic a wit that I regret the more his occasional lapses
into such stale buffoonery as, for example, the cinema com-
- - “moneyed society” is per-
haps better—do not offer very promising material for
the novelist who is not a master-hand at the delineation
of character. One has only to read a few pages of The
Fifth Wheel (CAssell) to realise that Miss OLIVE PRouty
intends that we shall be more interested in the adventures
of her heroine than in a close analysis of her mentality or
emotions. The Wars family are thrusters of a most ignoble
type, and Ruth Wars is a pushing young vulgarian whose in-
trigues to secure the affections of a wealthy but grammarless
lout disgust the reader nearly as much as they do the young
man's mother. But she is a thruster only by environment,
and a series of adventures or misadventures give her an
opportunity of developing into a very sane and wholesome
young woman and marrying a good if stodgy husband. The
transformation occurs very naturally and easily, and the
latter part of Miss PROUTY's story is much more attractive
than the first, though none of it can strictly be said to be
of “gripping interest,” as the publishers phrase it. I have
a suspicion that this is Miss PROUTY's first attempt. If
so there is every reason to hope that, given a subject of
greater consequence, its author will soon win a larger
measure of popularity than The Fifth Wheel is like to earn.

DISILLUSION ON THE HOME FRONT.
(Affectionately dedicated to the Inns of Court Reserve Corps.)
BLARE of bugles and throb of drums
Herald our column where it comes
With rhythmical pulse of hob-nailed feet
Debouching into Victoria Street—
Men, to judge by their martial air,
Ripe for valorous work “out there.”
Traffic is stayed; the surging crowd
Threatens to voice its pride aloud;
British tradition alone restrains
The ardour that almost bursts its veins
As it breathes God-speed to a gallant corps
Apparently bound for the seat of War.
Glad eyes down from the windows glance
Where you turn to the left to entrain for France;
Flanking the kerb where the two ways part
We can hear the beat of the flapper's heart;
Brave is her smile, but her cheeks are wan;
The turning comes—and we keep straight on.
The glamour pales as the crowds remark
That our main objective is just Hyde Park;
They have spent illusory hopes and fears
On a veteran party of Volunteers

ut for their Saturday exercise. O. S.
THE NEW DRAFT.
SoMEwhere in England—and, incidentally, miles from
anywhere and anything, to the utter boredom of the junior
Subs—stands the usual orderly ugly Hutment Camp. On
this day of May the sun is shining, the lark's on the
wing, the fair breeze blows through the heather, and the
dust—but why spoil a pretty idyll” The Second-in-Com-
mand stands at the gate of the potato garden and gazes
fixedly down the long road over the moor. Presently a
pillar of dust, suggesting to his military eye a body of
troops on the march, tops the horizon and slowly advances.
The new draft is undoubtedly approaching. A raw lot,
evidently—not much sign of military formation here. The
N.C.O. in charge has all his work cut out to keep his
party together. As they draw near, the Major, with an
amused smile, notes the lack of march discipline—stragglers
down and all over the road, urged on by a perspiring Lance-
Corporal (who is none too sprightly himself, for he is a war-
worn veteran and carries his three gold stripes); others, the
youngsters, larking with one another; others again even
halting on their own account, as if the four miles' climb
from the station had been far too much of a good thing for
independence no longer in the first bloom of youth. The
Major however continues to smile tolerantly.
At last the party is rounded up into some sort of forma-
tion and halted, while the senior N.C.O. salutes and reports
the safe arrival of his charge.
The Major proceeds in a leisurely manner and with the
same tolerant smile to look over the new arrivals.
“Not so bad, Corporal, not so bad. They'll be all right
after a week or two here. What's that ? A lot of trouble
in coming through the town 2 Well, well, a little disci-
pline will go a long way, eh?” (Appreciative guffaws from
the Major at this pleasantry and dutiful grin from the Cor-
poral). “What's the matter with this fellow 2 Sore feet?
H'm, better see to that as soon as they've got into quarters.
healthy life will work wonders with 'em. March 'em off
and see they have a good feed as soon as possible.”
“Very good, Sir," and off they go, hobbling and shuffling
weary feet through the dust, and looking about them with
mingled wonder, distrust and apprehension, like so many
mothers' darlings dumped down in a big public school for
their first term.
The usual fatigue man in the usual slops surveys them
with a dreamy eye from his comfortable resting-place under
the lee of a hut; then, as the interest of his discovery
filters through to his quiescent brain, he removes his short
black pipe from his mouth and whistles to a fellow-toiler
stretched near by on the heather; and as the kites collect
from nowhere out of the blue to share the find of a more
fortunate companion so do the “Regimentally Employed,”
the “Excused Duties,” the “Light Duties,” the “Quarter-
master's Fatigues,” and all other and sundry, the bugbears
of the Adjutant and the Regimental Serjeant-Major, flock
to the scene to take their share in the feast of wit. Some-
what coarse, it is to be feared, and cruelly personal, for the
soldier is no kinder than the schoolboy, his father, in his
reception of the raw and innocent.
The two N.C.O.'s in charge of the new-comers make no
attempt to protect their charges—they even join in the
laughter at the more direct hits. But at last the pink
rookies have run the gauntlet of comments on their appear-
ance, behaviour and personal peculiarities, and, accompanied
only by the less lethargic of their tormentors, have come to
a halt at the door of their new home. The Corporal roughly
pushes his way through the huddled mob and throws open
the door.
“Now then, my beauties, in you go"—and in they go, or
most of them, in a scrambling rush, remarking in twenty
different and querulous keys on the bare clean-swept floor,
the neat piles of bedding and the lime-washed walls. The
luckless stragglers, loudly protesting, are whipped in by the
Corporal with his stout ash-plant, aided by the well-directed
boots of the laughing hangers-on. Then he shuts and bolts
the door. “Well, Bill, that's settled the blighters. What

The consolidation was pro-

sauntered on the scene, picking
his way delicately through the
débris of the main street. He
lounged up to a group of Loam-
shire officers, yawned, told them
how tired he was, cursed the
drizzle for dimming his buttons

with the object of sheltering
there. He got no further than

Trelawney tore up handfuls of a ruined
wall and bombed him out of it with
showers of brick-bats. Away went the
chase again, cheered by shrill yoicks
and cat-calls from the spectators.
Suddenly there was an upheaval of
planks and brick-dust, and both runners
disappeared.
"Gone to ground, down a cellar,”
exclaimed the brother-officers. “Oh,
look! Fritz is crawling out."
The white terrified face of the German
appeared on the ground level, then with
a wriggle (accompanied by a loud noise
of rending material) he dragged his
body up and was on his way once
more. A second later Lionel Trelawney
was up as well, waving a patch of grey
cloth in his hand. «Molly's ripped
the seat out of his pants," shouted
the grand-stand. “Yow, tear 'm, Pup!”
“Good ole Collar and Cuffs!” chorused
the Loamshire Atkinses.
Lionel Trelawney responded nobly;

chips off the architecture and pushing
Ti over houses that got in the way;
and the Loamshires, followed
after, distributing bombs among
the cellars.

N ceeding when Lionel Trelawney
\|| sauntered on the scene, picking
"|| his way delicately through the
* débris of the main street. He
lounged up to a group of Loam-
shire officers, yawned, told them
how tired he was, cursed the
drizzle for dimming his buttons
and strolled over to a dug-out
with the object of sheltering
there. He got no further than
the entrance, for as he reached
it a wide-eyed German came
scrambling up the steps and
collided with him, bows on.
For a full second the two stood
chest to chest gaping, too sur-
prised to move. Then the Hun
turned and bolted. But this
time Lionel Trelawney was not
too bored to act. He drew his
revolver and rushed after him
like one possessed, firing wildly.
|Two shots emptied a puddle,
one burst a sandbag, one winged
a weather-cock and one went
just anywhere. His empty 19.

Trelawney would say to his batman,
“Have you got the boot and brass
polish, the Blanco, the brushes? Sure?”
(a sigh of relief). “Very well, now we'll
be getting on,” and so would send his
lads scrambling over the parapet grin-
ning from east to west.
“Where's 'ole Collar and Cuffs 2 "
some muddy warrior would shout after
a shrieking tornado of shell had swept
over them. “Dahn a shell-hole clean-

and the battered platoon chuckled
merrily. “’E's a card, 'e is,” said his
Sergeant, admiringly. “Marched four

the odds, but nobody paid any attention
to him. The Hun, badly blown, dodged
inside a shattered hen-house. Lionel
Trelawney tore up handfuls of a ruined
wall and bombed him out of it with
showers of brick-bats. Away went the
chase again, cheered by shrill yoicks
and cat-calls from the spectators.
Suddenly there was an upheaval of
planks and brick-dust, and both runners
disappeared.
“Gone to ground, down a cellar,”
exclaimed the brother-officers. “Oh,
look! Fritz is crawling out.”
The white terrified face of the German
appeared on the ground level, then with
a wriggle (accompanied by a loud noise
of rending material) he dragged his
body up and was on his way once
more. A second later Lionel Trelawney
was up as well, waving a patch of grey
cloth in his hand. “Molly's ripped
the seat out of his pants,” shouted
the grand-stand. “Yow, tear’m, Pup!”
“Good ole Collar and Cuffs!” chorused
the Loamshire Atkinses.
Lionel Trelawney responded nobly;
he gained one yard, two yards, five, ten.
The Hun floundered into a row of rasp-
berry canes, tripped and wallowed in
the mould. Trelawney fell on him like
a Scot on a threepenny bit and they
rolled out of sight locked in each other's
embrace.
The Loamshires jumped down from
their crazy perches and doubled to see
the finish, guided by the growlings,
grunts, crashing of raspberry canes and
jets of garden mould flung sky-high.
They were too late however. They
met the victor propelling the remains
of the vanquished up a lane towards
them. His fawn breeches were black
with mould, his shapely tunic shredded
to ribbons; his sleek hair looked like a
bird's-nest; his nose listed to starboard;
one eye bulged like a shuttered bow-
window; his eye-glass was not. But
the amazing thing about it was that he
didn't seem to mind; he beamed, in fact,
and with a cheery shout to his friends
—“Merry little scamper—eh, what?”—
he drop-kicked his souvenir a few yards
further on, exclaiming, “That'll teach
you to slop soup over my shirt-front,
you rude fellow !"
“Soup over your shirt-front!" bab-
bled the Loamshires. “What are you
talking about?”
“Talking about?” said Lionel Tre:
lawney. “Why, this arch-ruffian used
to be a waiter at Claritz's, and he
shed mulligatawny all over my glad-
rags one night three years ago—aggra-
wated me fearfully.” PATLANDER.

DEAR SIRs, Thanks for your letter.
I don't like the sound of your client's

terms. However, I happen to have
heard of a house that might be just
the place for Mr. Steinwicz. I will put
him on to it if he writes. Though I

suitable, for three months, with right

Letter from J. Cayley-Gibbons to
I. Steinwicz.
Beaconsford.
DEAR SIR,--I have received your
letter, but have decided not to let my
house for the moment.
I know, however, of a house which
might be just the place for you, though
it is not in Beaconsford itself, but right
in the country some miles from here.
I cannot give you definite information
about the rent, but fear it is rather a
large one. A cousin of mine is the
present tenant, but is leaving shortly,
I believe. I have never had a chance
to visit him there, so have not seen the
place, but believe it is roomy, and there
are good cellars, which no doubt would
serve as an air-raid shelter. I may add
that, though it is some little distance
from a railway station, there are plenty
of near neighbours. I could not give
you his address without permission,
but I am writing to him to-night, and
will ask his leave.
Yours faithfully,
JAMES CAYLEY-GIBBONs.
Letter from Moses Steinwicz to Isidore
Ditto.

MY DEAR BROTHER,--I hope you
have found another safe retreat, and
am glad to hear that you are leaving
Brighton soon, in any case, as I do not
think the South Coast will be safe much
longer. I hear that the next raid, which
I am told may be expected on London
shortly, will be more terrible than ever.
I and Rebecca are moving next week
to Hampshire, and I am leaving the
Stepney factory in charge of my fore-
man till things have settled down.
Why do not the Government make
peace at once, and let us all get on
with our business? It is terrible. Thank
goodness, I am over age, even for this
disgraceful new Act.
If things get much worse our beloved
Galicia would be a safer place than
England to live in.
Letter from J. Cayley-Gibbons to
I. Steinwicz.
Beaconsford.
DEAR SIR,-Since writing to you I
had an unexpected note from my cousin,
which must have crossed the letter I
sent to him last night. I was not cer-
tain before exactly when he thought
of leaving, but now find that circum-
stances may compel him to leave almost
at once. I gather from his letter that
there are several people after the place,
so fear you may be too late, though of
course, even if they take it, the new
tenants may not remain long.
However, I could let you know fur-
ther when I hear from my cousin in
reply to my last.
Yours faithfully,
J. CAYLEY-GIBBONs.

DEAR SIR,--I received your telegram,
but in the meantime have heard again
from my cousin, saying that he has
already left the house, and that the new
tenants are moving in.
If you care to make them an offer to
clear out I am permitted to tell you
that their family name is Fritz, and
the address, so far as I know it, is

Somewhere in Flanders.

ousting the Fritzes, as I think a two

England and I had conquered. I had
bagged my first bird; there he lay on
Mudsey Marsh a shattered wreck, a
terrible warning to Germany. This
meant fame. Two or three more dust-
ups of the same kind and I should have
a back-page photograph in The Daily
Mail; letterpress, “One of our Wizard
‘Archies': the Man who cannot Miss.”
Even before I was out between the
guns again news had been whispered
to the jackpost, thence to the detach-
ments, who broke into a cheer. I
quieted their uproar, dashed off my
report of action and turned in for two
hours' well-earned enjoyment of the
British cuckoo's beautiful dawn-song.
. A field-instrument in my tent started
tinkling briskly half-way through the
porridge course. The disturber was
Crookeman, of “B” Section.
“Congratulate me, old man. The
Mudsey fellow, you know—absolutely
mine! I heard his engines go all to

And the humour of it is that ass Wool-
!erson thinks it was his Why, dash
it all he couldn't have been even in

My next caller-up was Woollerson,
of “C” Section.
“I say,” he began, in deeply injured
tones, “has Crookeman been talking to
you? Fearful rot, of course, but he's
trying to make out the Mudsey “bird'
was his. As a matter of fact I believe
both Crookeman's breeches werejammed
when the fellow came over, and that he
didn't fire a shot. I only hope London
has the common decency to let me
claim; but you never know. Good-bye,

At 10.15 the following message was
handed to me: “Reference Mudsey

next line behind us—“have strong

By lunch-time I had learned it was
almost definitely established that a
monitor patrolling off-shore had shot
down the Mudsey Gotha. By noon
next day I had lost count of the number
of unquestionable victors. Then I re-
membered young Fatterby.
We all used liberally to punch young
Fatterby's head at school. Strange
vicissitudes of human fate: young
Fatterby now wears tabs.
After an hour's stern telephony I got
on to the Intelligence Section, and
quakingly asked for a private call to
the great young man.
“Ye—es,” he said—Fatterby's drawl
is owned to be one of the finest on the
Staff—“eh? Oh, you? How do?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, May 28th.-With LUDEN-
DoRFF again on the war-path Members
Whitsuntide recess were in no mood to
discuss trivialities. They readily ac-
cepted the intimation of Mr. MoRTAGU,
just returned from India with a deeper
bronze upon his complexion, that his
scheme of reform for the Dependency
must wait the PRIME MINISTER’s pleas-
ure before it can be revealed ; nor were
they seriously upset by Mr. BonAR
LAw's announcement that Home Rule
for Ireland was still in the drafts-
man's hands.
With his shining spectacles and his
ample corporation the MINISTER of
PENSIONS looks the very embodiment of
the spirit of benevolence. Unfortunately
there was a very small house to listen to
him as he told the moving history of
what had already been done to restore,
so far as money and care can do it, the
broken heroes of the War. Already
three hundred and forty thousand men
have received pensions. Thousands of
them have in addition been supplied
with artificial eyes and limbs, taught
handicrafts or re-established in busi-
ness. Already the estimate of the cost
is forty-six million pounds a year, and as
applications are still coming in at the
rate of fifteen thousand a week that sum
may easily have to be doubled. But pro-
vided the money is wisely and sym-
pathetically administered no one
will object. In fact the chief criti-
cism that came from Mr. Hogg|E
and other Members was that the
mouth of the Chelsea cornucopia
is still too much narrowed by red-
tape insertions.
The House of Lords was en-
gaged upon a cognate work of
war-benevolence. • Some weeks
ago Lord NEWTON announced that
France had suddenly, and with-
out notice to its Allies, entered
into an agreement with Germany
for a large exchange of able-
bodied prisoners; and at the same
time intimated that the British
Government would shortly enter
into similar negotiations. Since
then a section of the Press has
been conducting a violent agita-
tion with the object of forcing an
open door, and has not scrupled
to suggest that Lord NEWToN
himself was an obstructive.
What his Lordship has done to
deserve this treatment nobody in
the Upper House seems to know.
Even Lord DEvoNPoRT, who pro-
duced a milk-and-watery version
of the newspaper attacks, ab-
returning to Westminster after the
from blame; and most of the other
Peers who spoke paid a high tribute to
his work for the prisoners.
My own impression is that Lord
NEwtoN owes his unmerited position
as whipping-boy to the fact that he

does not suffer fools gladly, even if they
come in the guise of newspaper-re-
porters; and that, unlike his illustrious
namesake, he has no use for the theory
of gravity.
His speech to-day, for example, was
a little light in tone for so serious a
subject, and some of his audience would
have liked to hear less about the Press
and more about the prisoners. Among
his critics was Lord STAIR, who, hav-
ing been himself in the hands of the
Germans for two years, advocated the
widest possible exchange of prisoners,on
the ground that none of our men, after
what they had gone through, would
ever allow themselves to be captured
again, while the pampered Germans
would be ready enough to repeat the cry
of “Kamerad.” That expert view should
help to dispose of the military objections
to the exchange.
Wednesday, May 29th.-The Govern-
ment were asking for trouble when,
not content with upsetting the time of
day, they sought to interfere with the
“Seasons.” Mr. WARDLE had to with-
stand a chorus of protests from cham-
pions of various sections of “com-
muters,” as Americans call them. Even
Colonel WILL THoRNE's warning that
this question might bring the Ministry
to grief failed to move him.
Perhaps, if rightly interpreted, Mr.
CHURCHILL's explanation of the Army
Council's refusal to adopt the MADSEN
machine-gun may be regarded as cheer ||
ful. It might be a better gun than our
present one—he rather implied that it
was but it could not be produced in
the enormous numbers immediately re-
quired. Better a LEwis in the hand
than two MADSENs in the bush. May
we infer from this explanation that, in
the opinion of the Army Council, the
War is not going on long enough
to make it worth while for the
gun-factories to alter their ma-
chinery?
The ill wind blowing across the
Aisne had the negative merit of
enabling good progress to be made
with the Education Bill. Mem-
bers were too busy in the smoking-
rooms and on the Terrace airing
their opinions of the Allied strat-
egy to pay attention to the pro-
ceedings within the House.
There was a little discussion
on Clause 4. Mr. Tyson WILSON
objected to the phrase “young
persons . . . enjoying the benefits
of education,” and moved to sub-
stitute the word “receiving,"
which does, I am afraid, more
accurately express the juvenile
attitude of mind. At any rate
Mr. FISHER, however reluctantly,
accepted the amendment. The
next three Clauses were added to
the Bill almost automatically,
and when Clause 8 was reached
the sub-section abolishing the
“half-timer” went through with-
out a hostile word from Lanca-
shire and with only a feeble pro-
test from Sir FREDERICK BAN-

Thursday, May 30th.-Mr. ShoBTT
made his official début under unusually
favourable conditions, for not a single
Nationalist Member was in his place.
Mr. KING, seizing the opportunity of
adding Ireland to his extensive réper-
toire, attempted to deputise for Mr.
DILLON, and put a few questions
about the Sinn Fein prisoners. The
only result was to show that the new
CHIEF SECRETARY has a clear voice and
a crisp manner.
Further progress was made with the
Education Bill. A belated protest from
Lancashire Labour against the abolition
of the “half-timer” was not followed
up in the division lobby; but there
was a good deal of opposition to the
proposal to limit the right of parents to
send their children to private schools.
Mr. WILSON Fox's remark, that of all
cranks the pedagogic variety was “the
most unpractical, stubborn and fero-
cious,” met with a good deal of approval.
An active part in the discussion was
taken by Mr. PETo, in spite of an acci-
dent which had temporarily lamed him
and compelled him to speak from his
seat. But the Government declined to
accept his utterances as er cathedrá.

sprang up and trilled out a tiny song,
to a very ordinary minute casket, com-
posed of silver and two pieces of trans-
lucent agate, such as

MENTALITY.
AT Bow Street yesterday Miss Amelia K. Slottery was
prosecuted under the new Purification of English Act for
that she, in a thesis written for her degree at Swottenham
University, had made use of the word “mentality,” contrary
to the provisions of the said Act as laid down in Clause 1,
sub-section 25.
Sir ARCHIBALD BoDKIN, who appeared for the Crown,
said this was a very bad case. The prisoner, it appeared,
had caused her name to be entered for the examination in
modern English, of which one of the chief features was the
submission of an original essay on the Revival of Poetry in
War. She had expressed her intention of using the word
“mentality” in connection with the KAISER, but had at
first been dissuaded by her friends, who pointed out to her
that it was the duty of patriotic citizens to obey the law
without hesitation or question. The word against which
the Act was directed had obtained great vogue in America
as well as in this country.
The Magistrate asked for enlightenment as to the forma-
tion of such a word. Did anyone propose to say “gentality"
when referring to a nation, or “dentality" when speaking
of teeth 2
Sir ARCHIBAL.D. No, Sir.
The Magistrate. Very well, then, what is the defence 2
It is a most disgusting word. Mentality—pah!
Mr. Jones said his client was carried away by the ardour
of composition. She now recognised the folly of her action
and undertook not to offend again. -
The Magistrate said he could not altogether overlook the
| charge. The prisoner must pay a fine of five hundred
pounds, and might consider herself fortunate to have

THE ADVENTURERS.
THE other day, when I was out with
the Junior Run, I felt an awful stitch
in my side, due to potato scones, just at
the bridge that crosses the stream
through Highwayman's Copse, and sat
down on the mossy parapet to rest.
There isn't any copse at all now, for
the trees have been cut down for the
War and carted away, and that part of
the world is completely spoiled. Pre-
sently two people came walking along
and stopped at the bridge. One was
Major Hewlett, who fought at Mons,
and went on fighting till he lost his leg
on the Somme, and the other was old
General Morrison, who won the V.C.
in the Boer War and has whole rows
of war medals. Both of them were at
my school once, and so they nodded
to me politely and asked about the
run. Major Hewlett won the Ten
Mile Cross-country Championship of the
school when he was here, and General
Morrison often watches the Big Sides,
so we were all friends, sort of. They
stared at the stumps of the trees, just
as I was doing, and then General
Morrison said in his husky old voice,
“By Jove, Hewlett, I remember my
most exciting adventure to - day, as
vividly as if it had taken place yester-
day. I shall never forget it. My heart
still jumps to think of it.”
“Tell us, General,” said Major Hew-
lett, looking a little puzzled; “you never
would give me the yarn of your W.C.,
ou know.”
“W.C. 2 Tut !” said the General.
“Listen. At the time I have in mind
I was in command of a band of hunters
in the depths of Brazil. We were
searching for a famous Blue Tiger, and
no peril of savage man or beast could
daunt us. I was known as Rolf Sure-
hand, and was equally expert with rifle,
revolver, sabre, boomerang and scalp-
ing-knife. - - - -
“For weeks we followed the spoor of
the BlueTiger, which was easily recog-
nisable by its enormous size and the
piled skeletons of rival hunters which
marked the monster's meal-hours. We
lived on what we killed and gathered—
moose, ibex, armadillo, wild turkey,
turtles, salmon, breadfruit, yams and
custard-apples.”
“Had you no pemmican 2" asked
the Major.
“Of course we had pemmican,” the
General snapped, very crossly, I thought
—“and also the liquorice and cake we
had saved from the wreck. Did I tell
you we had been wrecked 2 Anyhow,

Morgan's treasure amongst the West
Indian Keys. A brother pirate of mine

“General,” interrupted Major Hew-
lett with a funny smile, “you have
reminded me of an exploit of my own
which won't wait. I must tell you
about it at once, and this other ruffian
here. At one time I was the leading
spirit of a band of Gentlemen Adven-
turers who spent their time roving all
over the world. Sometimes we fought
naked cannibals in Fiji, sometimes bar-
tered for silver fox with the flat-nosed
Esquimaux. One day we careened our
schooner beneath the tossing palms of
a tropic lagoon, the next our camp-
fires scared the prowling timber-wolf
in the hard North-West. At length
finding ourselves in the heart of New
Guinea, we chanced upon a stream
sanded with gold, but crowded also
with alligators, devilfish and water-
snakes, and fringed by virgin forest
ceaselessly whispering with stealthy
savage life.
“Our ship—we too had been wrecked
—was far behind us, but we had salved
the brass what-d'-you-call-it 2–ah,
carronade—and planned to build our-
selves a stockade secure against attack.
But, alas ! my lieutenant, Amyas of the
Iron Arm, who was also the crew,
was stricken down with the mumps,
and I was put in quarantine. Then
came the holidays, and the project was
abandoned. -
“And now they've cut down my
New Guinea forest, General, and your
Brazilian bush, and the palms and the
banyans—just look at the place | "
. They both stared at the tree-stumps
and the stream as if they saw other
things. . -
“There's the very pool where we
knew the Blue Tiger slaked his thirst.
Didn't just drink, mind you,” said the
General; “he was superior to that. He
slaked his thirst.”
“It's the same pool, Sir,” said Major
Hewlett, “where I was nearly caught
by the Giant Python.”
And what do you think? They were
both pointing to a little pool in the
stream which used to be hidden from
the road by the trees and which I call,
just for fun, of course, the “Black
Lagoon.” -
And they didn't say a single word
about the War.

A STONE's-THRow from the College gate
There lives a very noble lady;
A cottage-lawn her whole estate,
Without a tree to keep it shady ;
For thirty years she served the school
In quite a number of positions,
And by her character and rule
Upheld its very best traditions.
School generations came and went,
Head followed Head—but in this
story
'Tis foreign to my main intent
To say which gained the greatest
glory; "
Enough that minds of every size,
Hustlers and scholars, bloods and
boobies, -
All came in time to recognize
Her price was far above all rubies.
For, though immersed in household
cares
And such extremely mundane matters
As washing, packing and repairs
Of wardrobes normally in tatters,
She found with unobtrusive tact
A hundred ways of help and healing,
And never overlooked an act
Of cruelty or double-dealing.
Her office and her Spartan breed
Forbade her to be sentimental,
But in an hour of real need
She could be wonderfully gentle;
To fashion, to the swift or strong
She was incapable of truckling,
But helped the lonely soul along
And comforted the ugly duckling.
Robust in body and in mind,
Free from all feminine caprices,
Seeing the best in all her kind,
Though loving nephews more than
nieces,
She made no pets; if haply one
Appealed to her beyond another,
It was the orphan or the son
Neglected by a selfish mother.
Too fond to quit a scene so dear,
Too wise to fancy she was slighted,
Loth to intrude or interfere,
Though always helpful when invited,
She is the first whom boys on leave
Greet when they seek their alma
mater, -
The last they part from on the eve
Of their return to trench and crater.
For in her strong and homely face,
Her life supremely self-forgetting,

Their debt to Founder, Saint and

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Government and the War (CoNSTABLE) is not an example
of “wisdom after the event,” for most of its chapters were
written before August, 1914. They represent the con-
sidered opinions of a man who has devoted a lifetime to the
study of the nature of war, and the best part of a genera-
tion to the endeavour to persuade his countrymen to follow
his example. It would be tempting, did space permit, to
try to sketch what would have been the probable course
of the present conflict if the principles that Professor
SPENSER WILKINson enunciates with so much force had
been a part of the mental equipment of our political rulers.
Unfortunately our statesmen, with very few exceptions, were
so much immersed in domestic and party problems that
they never seriously considered the question of war. They
did not realise that war is a continuation of policy—“one of
the modes of human intercourse,” the author calls it; that a
State intending to retain its independence must always be
prepared for a conflict in which all its resources may have to
be engaged; and that consequently it is necessary for the
Government at all times to have at hand and constantly
refer to “a thinker-out of wars” if policy is not to end in
disaster. Under the rough tutelage of Germany our rulers
have perhaps learned these lessons; but there are other teach-
ings of military history that they do not seem yet to have
fully assimilated, e.g. that there is no limited liability in
modern war, that the problem of making an army is the pro-
blem of the education of officers, and that the temptation to
dissipate energy must always be resisted. One of Professor
fundamental condition of success is a vital cause”; one of
the most depressing, that “victory cannot be won by a
Government of amateurs.” With the view of ensuring that
our cause should meet the success it deserves I should like
the PRIME MINISTER to insist that every member of the
War Cabinet—himself included—should devote a couple of
hours before its next meeting to reading a volume whose
clearness and cogency entitle its author to be described as
the British CLAUSEwiTz.
I cannot but think that, so far as plot is concerned, Mary
Plantagenet (CASSELL) shows some retrogression from the
themes, both original and strong, which I have hitherto
associated with the name of Mr. J. C. SNAITH. The present
is what one might not unfairly call a Romance of the House-
keeper's Room, and turns very largely upon that antique
problem of fiction—ought the scion of a ducal house to
marry a heroine of mysterious parentage? In this case the
heroine, Mary of the title, is a foundling, discovered on
a doorstep of Grosvenor Square by a kindly policeman, who
arranges for her upbringing as one of his own family.
Afterwards she becomes what the publishers call a “famous
actress,” and is beloved by the heir of the Bridport straw-
berry-leaves. Naturally in an affair of this kind you will
not expect that the heroine's origin is going to rest perman-
ently on a doorstep; nor does Mr. SNAITH allow you to be
disappointed of any of the obvious eventualities. The whole
thing, with its concern over coronets, strikes me as belonging
really to the least expensive type of fiction, though here
disguised by the skill of an author who has shown himself
able to handle material better worthy of him. We know
--

WILKINSON's most, encouraging statements is that “the

in Belgrave (here Berkeley) Square, as anywhere else; but
the cardiac activities of Mary and her exalted connections
certainly impressed me as dependent rather upon mechan-
ism than any human blood, blue or other. Surely the
author of The Sailor can hardly have regarded them
altogether seriously.
Mr. PHILIP GIBBs maintains his standard as chief inter-
preter of the day-to-day moods, actions and argot of our
armies in France. The history that will be written will
contain many things which the hamstrung correspondents
of these days either do not know or may not say; but it
will not give us the pathetic or savage or humorous streaks
of intimate local colour, the very heat and hurry and des-
perate fatigue of these and those actually fighting men.
So that From Bapaume to Passchendaele, 1917 (HEINEMANN)
will be a good book to have by one as a detailed com-
mentary on battles too hopelessly big to allow of any but
general treatment. This is a book of victory with scarcely
a set-back, and whatever the imperturbable long-view strate-
gists may say it is mournful to read of the heroism that
gave us Kemmel, Mes- - -
sines, Wytschaete and º º º
a score of storied places - ºff, Uſ
now, alas, lost to us. º gº
But the moral of these º * /º
pages is that the men
whose tails “you
couldn't get down with
a crowbar” are still
carrying on with the
laughing courage which
Mr. Giºisillustrates in
a hundred anecdotes.
Let me say that there's
not a page in this re-
cord that doesn't make
the pulse beat faster
and the proud tears
rise; but also that the
writer sees, below the
brilliant heroic surface -- ~~ -
of the great struggle, * * **** -
the grim depths of horror, terror and decay. His funda-
mental seriousness corrects any tendency to Fleet Street
flamboyancy and prevents abject surrender to the telling
headline and the artless alliteration.
I know no book better calculated to provoke a nostalgia
among shooting men for the scenes and incidents of the
sport they love than Shooting Days (MURRAY), by Captain
ERIC PARKER. For four seasons there has been virtually no
shooting. Shooters old and young have been after bigger
game. They have almost succeeded in beginning to reconcile
themselves to the abandonment of their favourite sport,
when, lo, here comes Captain PARKER with his book, and
revives our regret in all its keenness. And Captain PARKER
is Shooting Editor of The Field; he knows what to write
about and how to write, it; he can touch the spot more
skilfully than another. He can speak of “the chances of
covert-shooting at its best . . . the accidents, the unex-
pected, the wilder, happier part of it all,” and can think
“again and again of wet boots, the joy of being utterly
tired, and sunset lighting orange lamps in the mosses and
the pools of the bog.” Briefly, Captain PARKER has written
a most delightful book in a very charming style of pleasant
reminiscence. It is a compendium of sporting information,
and a mine of knowledge which can be minted into agree-
Lieut. Smythe (of the W.T.C., who is also an allotment enthusiast). “I WANT You

you see, that some day we shall shoot again and discuss
such questions as “Do partridges drink?”
One might say that from a literary point of view the
Principality has lately been coming into its own, with
rhaps a further guess that the inheritance seems likely to
i. a not altogether agreeable one. Already one very candid
critic has dealt faithfully by the dwellers in South Wales;
and now Mrs. EDITH NEPEAN follows with a story, Gwyneth
of the Welsh IIills (STANLEY PAUL), whose characters abide
in the country round Moel Siabod. There is however little
resemblance, beyond certain tricks of literally translated
idiom, in the two writers. Not for Mrs. NEPEAN the stark
realism of Mr. CARADoc Evans; rather one might describe
her as a romanticist who has listened to Bow Bells, and in
whose ears the silver trumpet of The Family Herald has
sounded not in vain. Aptly does the wrapper-artist depict
Gwyneth as standing tip-toe upon a mountain top, clad in
a scarlet cloak and a tall hat. Gwyneth was that kind of
heroine; the kind, moreover, that will enter a story as a
foundling and leave it as the daughter of a lord. I wish
− I had space to tell you
of her adventures be:
-* tween these extremes.
ºf She was pushed into a

º | bad young man who

had married her, and

y that Gwyneth was so
• far from being drowned
that, having secretly
emerged from the lake,
within a comparatively
short time she was be-
ing presented by her
noblesire to the nephew
whom he considered
- - her suitable mate; and
that this individual was none other than the gentleman
who had originally submerged her—well, you will perhaps
endorse my verdict about realism. If the Land of My (or
rather of Mrs. NEPEAN's) Fathers is in fact anything at
all like this, much seems to be explained.
ºr,
The nine sketches to be found in Windswept Farm
(RouTLEDGE) are dainty enough and quite well written;
they reveal a loving intimacy with domestic animals and
birds, and occasionally a nice sense of humour. But they
are very slight, and more than once the attitude of the
recluse into whose mouth they are placed by Mr. WILLIAM

THE TRANSFORMATION.
LET me confess at once that I was not popular in the
battalion. The unfortunate and involuntary habit of saying
“Thanks” to the person who transferred my allowance of
“swipes” from his pail to my tin earned for me the name
of Algy the day I joined up at Winchester, and it was as
Algy that I, a true son of County Cork, landed in France.
I did my best to retrieve my first mistake, but an incau-
tious admission that I could speak French completed my
ruin, and after that a firm resolve not to use words of more
than two syllables failed to redeem my character.
My arch-enemy (when the Huns were not about) was
Private Brown. Twice within a week he practically saved
my life, but I knew him too well to thank him; indeed he
threatened to stand on my face if I did. I suspect he
preserved me in order that he might have an objective for
his devastating sarcasm.
“Yer lookin' rotten, Algy,” he said cheerfully the day
we arrived at what was called with fine irony a rest camp.
“I’m really ill this time,” I said, and wondered why
my body did not rattle when I shivered, “and I shouldn't
be surprised if I died in a bed after all.”
“That's jest the sort o' thing you would do,” he retorted
in shrill ill-humour—“dyin' comfortably in bed when every
other chap is stoppin' a "Un bullet ! But you always was
particular, Algy."
A sleepless night made me decide to seek out the M.O.
on the morrow. I had hitherto hesitated to call on that
over-worked autocrat, for “swinging the lead" was the
most popular of pastimes, and the M.O. was seldom sympa-
work of the “rest” camp did not prevent the occupants
forming themselves into debating societies and holding
violent meetings far on into the night.
I was wandering back from the M.O.'s quarters, having
failed to do more than receive a promise from the doctor
that he would “look at me" later, when I ran into Private
Brown. I gingerly protected my swollen neck with my
left hand. He stood still for a fraction of a second, stared
hard at me, and then without a word he turned and fled.
When I reached our hut he was talking loudly, his remarks
being punctuated by many “Algys.” Plainly he was telling
my fellow-huttites about his encounter with me, and I was
endeavouring to solve the puzzle of his retreat when two
Scotties from No. 14 stopped to ask me if there was a
chance of interviewing the M.O. Simultaneously a hoarse
shout came from the window of No. 15.
“Blimy,” cried Private Brown, “the blighters are tryin'
to steal our Algy.”
The next moment I was surrounded by a dozen of my
hut-companions, who pressed upon me cigarettes, café au
lait in various stages of temperature, oranges and cake, at
the same time heaping insults on the inoffensive Scotties.
“Good old Algy " said Brown, linking his arm in mine
affectionately; “you belong to us, and we don't mean to let
you go. You won't fergit yer old pals, will yer?” Forty-
eight hours previously he had offered to present me to the
KAISER in exchange for a lighted match |
I thought it was one of his heavy jokes, for Brown hails
from Aldgate; but when he insisted upon changing beds—
mine was in the draughtiest position near the door—I came
to the conclusion that his heart had been touched by our
common danger.
For the remainder of that day Brown and the others never
let me out of their sight, taking turns in fours to accompany
me wherever I went. It was done very nicely, and they
made me feel that it was inspired by personal regard. All
my needs were supplied from a common fund, to which I
was not permitted to subscribe, and my conversation was
listened to with studied respect.
Then I realised that I was popular at last, and I was the
proudest man in the battalion. I revelled in the unique
sensation. It pleased me immensely to notice how jealous
my pals were if anyone from another hut came near me.
Intrusive strangers were elbowed off, and an unfortunate
Tyke who asked me for a light nearly lost his life in the
argument that ensued. His eloquent disclaimer of the rôle
of Algy-snatcher was the only jarring note in that never-
to-be-forgotten afternoon.
Next morning I asked Private Brown for an explanation.
He was lying lazily on his back in the hut, orders having
come that not a man was to be allowed to leave it until the
M.O. had been ; indeed there was a sentry on guard to pre-
vent us going to work.
“Why am I popular, Brown?” I asked, seeing that he
was in an expansive mood.
“Why, you silly perisher"—this expression was clearly
intended to be genial—“you've got the mumps, 'aven't
you? I spotted 'em at once. And your mumps means that
every man in yer 'ut is in quarantine for ten days. Ten
days doin' nothin' 'cept eatin'an' drinkin'an' sleepin', whilst
the other blighters are workin' theirselves to death in this—
I don't think—rest camp. We wasn't goin' to let anyone
steal yer an' smuggle yer into their 'uts. Algy, yer done
us a good turn, and we shan't forget it."
From that day forward I was the darling of the battalion.

THE WATCH DOGS.
LXXIV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Pausing in the
heat of the battle a man may well ask
himself, “For what am I fighting?”
There can only be one answer: “The
cause of Freedom.” And wherein con-
sists the evil thing standing between
humanity and this natural right? In
that most narrow and most malicious
of all tyrannies, militarism. What do
we mean by militarism? That harsh
and harsh. It is the first of very many
bits of mere nonsense, our not giving
immediate attention to her case. The
indignant applicant therefore, rejecting
the proffered hand of false friendship,
takes up a firm attitude on the other
side of the inquisitor's table and gives
the inquisitor a look, as if to say, “Now,
get on with your oppression of the de-
fenceless, for I am in a hurry to be
oing.”
The first thing to be done is to accept
the whole responsibility for the absurd
control of the individual by
the bureau which prevents *.
former going his ways as a free
man and developing himself
according to his innate tenden-
cies. And who is the typical
representative of this oppres-
sion of the People? Leaving ||
LUDENDoRFF out of the ques-
tion for the moment, I think I
may fairly say that the Accus-
ing Finger points at myself.
I, Henry, am for the moment
a Military Control Officer. It
is I and my sort that the
world is out to exterminate,
that I myself originally armed
myself to do down. I am the
oppressor who prevents hon-
est Englishmen going where
they want to or coming back -
again, if they happen to have ||
slipped through when I wasn't
looking. It is to me that
trembling applicants address
their moving prayers for per-
mission to go and join their
families, to seek out and save
their ruined businesses, to
move to healthier climes where
alone, as their doctors certify,
they can hope to recuperate
their broken health. It is I
who subject them to every
form of delay, inconvenience,
annoyance, pettifogging rou-
tine, interference and imperti-
nence, only at the end to refuse
their just claims and throw
them relentlessly out of my diabolical
office. I will tell you how I do it.
To give the most lurid reality to the
description of the brutal business we
will take, for choice, a female applicant.
It gives the last touch that militarism
should be seen trampling on the weaker
sex. Besides which the people who
are under this pressing necessity of
going to and fro seem to be almost
entirely of that gender.
There is the sense of a bitter un-
sympathetic encounter from the very be-
ginning of the interview. Ten minutes'
impatient waiting in the outer room
has shown the lady that she is up

“DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I write to appeal to you to put forth
all your influence to check the irritating use, except, of course,
when military matters are referred to, of the word 'camouflage.”
Yours, etc., etc., ONE WHO HAs suffer Ed.”
In my efforts to carry out instruc-
tions and practise the arts of oppres-
sion I have tried many devices. The
process of reasoning is the one first
attempted. But I don't know what
it is about. Military Exigencies—they
always fail to make any impression
as against harrowing family histories.
What is a mere war compared with
the necessity for a lady to be with her
sister-in-law who is very much feeling
the absence of her husband all day at
a Munitions' office? If all the boats
Tº coming from England are full

surely there must be many a

Eº devil at refusing by letter. But
no, she came on the Monday

with her, and we spent the day
together getting everybody else
to visa the passports, booking
her tickets, looking up the
trains, discussing the food
system of passports and visas and to question, getting her luggage registered

You then rise from your seat, go round
to the other side of the table and pick
up from the floor the odd papers, letters,
five-franc notes and trinkets which the
lady has scattered in her search for her
passport. Even thus early in the inter-
view I am in that state of mind in which
I count myself a lucky man in not
being given a rap on the head with her
umbrella for my impudence. I am
indeed happy to be on my hands and
knees beneath my own office table; it
is a sort of respite from that terribly
uneven argument I know I am about
and tipping the porters. She reported
me, of course, for not knowing my busi-
ness and so causing her delay. I got
told off for ever allowing her to go at
all. But there, what am I for but to be
reported for one thing and told off for
the other?
Once I tried the simple ruse of losing
the rubber stamp for “Granted” at the
critical moment, but the Oppressed, one
of the smiling artful sort, was sure I
wouldn't mind her coming round to my
side of the table and helping me to look
for it. And before I knew where I was
or where she was she had found it and


against something essentially unjust
done the stamping herself. She smiled
to maintain.

at me so nicely as she went out and
told the lady secretary at the door what
fools men were.
Yes, Charles, I have had the idea of
setting a thief to catch a thief, and
when one dangerous young thing had
lost the argument and was about to
resort to tears I called in the lady
secretary, old enough to be her mother,
to hear the case and decide. She heard
it all and decided against me. Women
don't believe in militarism.
I hit upon the solution by luck. In
a desperate moment I evolved a rubber
stamp of my own and had it made at
my own expense: “Go where You LIKE,
WHEN YOU LIKE AND HOW YOU LIKE,
AND IF ANY MAN SUCCEEDS IN STOPPING
YOU EN ROUTE I TAKE OFF MY HAT TO
HIM.” The lady secretary objected to
this; women are tidy creatures who
love regulations for their own sake.
When she insisted on my exercising
discrimination I told her that anyone
who had a hard case (they all have)
and who knew the PRIME MINISTER per-
sonally (they all do) could not be re-
fused. She said they could ; I said it
was impossible. She said she would do

rubber stamps. I passed the whole lot
to her and said that if she applied the
“APPLICATION REFUSED " it would be
against my whole sense of reason and
justice. Since then she has used no
other. “Sign, please,” she says to me,
and stands over me while I do it. Then
she shows the distressed victim out,
kind and sympathetic to the last. “I
am dreadfully sorry this should have
happened,” I hear her say at the door;
“but then you know what men are.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CAP'N CALEB'S CAMOUFLAGE.
HE was an object of interest in the
bar of “The Sloop,” for he was one of
the crew of a vessel which had been
torpedoed off the headland during the
night, and he had been landed with
other survivors at the fishing village
that morning.
“Yes, it gives yer a shock being tor-
pedoed,” he said in answer to a ques:
tion; “but I'm orlright now, and I'll
be better when I've 'ad some more
beer. I ain't lost my thirst, not that
you could notice, though I was blown
up in the air when the torpedo 'it us,
and came down in the sea.”
The questioner took the hint and
ordered another pint of beer, which the
shipwrecked mariner drank deliberately
with the air of a connoisseur.
“It ain't bad beer that, boss,” he re-
marked politely to the landlord; “but
I reckon a man would get water-logged
before 'e could get drunk on it."
The landlord smiled and discreetly
turned the conversation back to the
subject of the submarine menace.
“No, I ain't afraid o' submarines,
but my missus is,” said the mariner;
“that's why I'm 'ere. I've been tor-
pedoed twice this year, and my missus
is to blame. But it serves me right
for listening to 'er and leavin' the old
Saucy Anne.
“It all comes o' this cammy flage
idea,” he went on with a heavy sigh.
“If it 'adn't been for old Cap'n Caleb's
a-cammyſlagin' the Saucy Anne the
missus’d never've got the wind up
about submarines and I'd never've
been torpedoed, And I wouldn't be
standin' 'ere now with a empty glass
in me 'and.” -
It was the landlord who took the
hint this time and hastened to remedy
the defect.
“It was like this, y'see,” resumed
the victim of camouflage when he had
again refreshed himself. “I was third
mate on the Saucy Anne—not that
third mate meant much, 'cos the crew
was only four all told and the Saucy
Anne was a little old steamer o' two
hundred ton gross. But she was a nice
little craft, and old Cap'n Caleb Collins,
what was master and owner, was one
o' the best—treated us more like pals
than a crew, 'e did.
“Five year I'd been third mate on
| the Saucy Anne when the War started,
bringin' coal from Cardiff to Port Car-
bis, and home reg'lar every ten days.
Cap'n Caleb 'ad been doin' that for
twenty year, and he jest went on doin'
it and never worried hisself about the
War.
“Then the German submarines started
boat; but our old man took no notice
and kep' on sailin' reg'lar—said he'd
like to see any blinkin' German tryin'
to sink 'im. Well, two more Port Car-
bis vessels was sunk, and some o' the
other skippers starts what they calls
‘protectin'themselves'; but Cap'n Caleb
never did nothin'. Then a chap in uni-
form comes down to Port Carbis and
he starts explainin' this 'ere cammy-
flagin' idea to the owners.”
He paused to empty his glass once
more, wiped his mouth with the back
of his hairy hand and proceeded with
his story.
“The officer, or whatever he was, tells
Cap'n Caleb about paintin' the Saucy
Anne to cammy flage 'er, and the old
man listens attentive. ‘Yes,’ says 'e,
“I sees the notion, Sir. The old ship
could do with a coat o' paint, 'er not
'aving 'ad much this seven year, and
I'll see about cammyflagin' 'er myself.
We've got some artist chaps 'ere in
Port Carbis,’ says the Cap'n, “and I'll
'ave the Saucy Anne cammyflaged
proper,' 'e says.
“So Cap'n Caleb 'e lays the old ship
up for a week, runs 'er inter a boat-
builder's yard and gets an artist and a
sign-painter from the town to come and
'ave a go at cammyflagin' the Saucy
Anne. He never let none o' the crew
nor nobody see 'er, and when the
painters was done 'e 'as 'er refloated,
but with big tarpaulins 'anging down
'er sides to protect the new cammyflage
paint, 'e says. Not till we was loaded
and casting off from the quay does 'e
let us reef them tarpaulins.
“I knowed there was something
funny about us as soon as the Saucy
Anne starts steamin' out o' the 'arbour,
'cos the crowd on the jetty starts run-
nin' along to watch us, and some of
'em cheered and waved their 'ats. So
I takes "a good squint overside to see
what our new cammyflage looks like—
and I nearly fell overboard with the
shock when I sees what Cap'n Caleb
'ad 'ad done.
“There was a big Union Jack painted
right down the bows o' the Saucy Anne;
'er sides was painted bright blue; and in
white letters on 'em—big white letters
you could have read a mile away almost
—right along from the bows to the
stern, there was painted:—
• BRITISH-AND DAMN YOUR
SUBMARINES ' ' "
The listeners in the bar of “The
Sloop" gasped, restrained an inclina-
tion to cheer, and some of them almost
struggled for the privilege of buying the
shipwrecked mariner more beer.
“Surprised? You're right,” he re-
sumed with a reminiscent grin. “I
was surprised, so was the rest of the
Carbis. When the bloke at the Admir-
alty station on the point outside the
bay saw us 'e nearly 'ad 'ysterics and
starts wagging flags at us; but Cap'n
Caleb takes no notice. “I’ll give 'em
cammyflage,’ he says, looking as proud
as Punch.
“Well, we gets to Cardiff, and a fine
how-d'-ye-do there was there, I can tell
yer. “I reckon they think the Saucy
Anne is the Royal yacht,' says the
Cap'n solemn-like, when they starts
cheerin' us from other ships and blowin'
sirens, and a crowd comes down to the
wharf to welcome us. We all had
plenty o' free beer that night—all 'cept
the Cap'n, 'im being a teetotaler and
never drinkin' nothin' but gin.
“In the morning down comes an old
chap with gold braid and brass buttons
to the wharf, just as Cap'n Caleb was
standin’ admirin' the Saucy Anne. 'E
takes a look at our ship, then 'e goes
red in the face.

A SoNG of Wisdom.
THEY tell you it ain't no good
A-wondering when you'll die,
Or lying low as a soldier should
When aereoplanes is by:
For whether it comes in a sudden way,
Or lingering long and late,
You won't go under until the day
That's settled before by Fate.
Ah, well, and it may be true—
But the lads I like to see
Are the ones that do as they're told to do
And stay where they ought to be;
For Fate may fix on a far-off date
And a death of an easy kind,
But it ain't no use encouraging Fate
To change her feminine mind.
I've been out many a day
And seen"too many a mate
With a leg or an arm blown clean away
By a thing he thought was Fate;
But when six men will monkey about
With a rusty old bomb gone bad,
Then what is it knocks the six men out?
|So I keep my rifle clean
And I use my eyes and ears,
And I don't go wandering off the scene
A-looking for sooveneers;
And may-be the bullet that bears my

Is meant for a distant day,
But I don't get playing the idiot game
When the other ones come my way.
And it's better alive than dead
You'll serve the old platoon,
So try to do as the officer said
And not to die too soon.
Though you may not add to your earthly

It's a thing worth trying to do;
You take good care of yourself, young
Inan,
And Fate won't matter to you.

you that your family spectre is now withdrawn from

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 3rd.—The war-situation
may be as serious as the newspapers
represent it, but to look at the House
of Commons no one would think so.
With traditional British phlegm Mem-
bers devoted themselves to such topics
as the ukase forbidding brides-elect to
cross the ocean for their nuptials. Dr.
MACNAMARA explained that it had been
issued simply out of regard for their
personal safety; but a Scots Member
thought it illogical that women who
now possessed the franchise should not
be allowed to go to the Pole if they
Want to.
There was much criticism of the
Government for undertaking not to
bomb the German towns on Corpus
Christi Day without insisting upon a
reciprocal pledge from the enemy. One
Member observed that the
Germans must think we
are a lot of fools' Mr.
BonAR LAw did not at-
tempt to deny the implica-
tion, but quietly remarked
that in acting as they did
the Government had not
attempted to make a bar-.
gain, but had simply done
what they thought right.
This seemed to strike the
House as a novelty in
official procedure, for no
more questions were asked.
A request made by Mr.
HoDT that the posters
issued by the War Aims
Department should be ex-
hibited in the Tea-Room,
so that Members might
see for themselves their “disgraceful
character,” was refused by Mr. LAw.
It is difficult to imagine any sort of
advertisement in support of war-aims
which would not outrage the eminent
Pacifist's delicate artistic sensibility.
Sugar is a form of carbon which, as
Mr. BALDw1N observed, “often gener-
ates a certain amount of warmth.”
Strenuous efforts to induce the Govern-
ment to drop the increase in the tax
were made by Mr. Lough, who in his
zeal for sweetness, if not for light, com-
mitted himself to the statement that
the CHANCELLoR of The ExchEQUER
had already got a great deal more money
than he wants; and by Mr. ADAMSON,
the new Privy Councillor, who developed
an ingenious theory that the moral of
the nation depended upon its consump-
tion of sugar.
After listening for an hour to com-
plaints of the meagreness of the In-
come Tax allowance for wear-and-tear,
Mr. BALDw1N confessed that he felt

man of courage as well as humour
he did not go into the garden and
eat worms; he went into the Division
Lobby instead, and found that he still
had enough friends left to defeat the
opposition.
Tuesday, June 4th.-Several weeks
have elapsed since Mr. SAMUEL YoUNG,
the doyen of the House, passed away at
the age of ninety-six. Since then East
Cavan has been without a representa-
tive in the House of Commons. In the
ordinary course it would be for the
Nationalist Whip to move for the writ,
but Mr. DILLON has apparently no
hankering for an election in present
circumstances. The Sinn Fein M.P.'s,
though spoiling for a fight, are immo-
bilised by their refusal to come to West-
minster. So Mr. WILLIAM. O’BRIEN,
never averse from putting a spoke in
Mr. Dillos's wheel, has despatched

one of his “Independent’’ henchmen to
do the needful.
The lot fell upon Mr. CREAN, who
evidently felt his position acutely as
he rose from the Nationalist Benches,
“whence all but he had fled,” to recite
the customary formula. No opposition
was offered, so East Cavan will shortly
be able to add another recruit to the
Irish Parliamentary army of absentees.
Recruiting for the other Irish army
—the one that does not run away—is
to be stimulated by grants of land.
Sir JAMES CRAIG wanted to know the
exact location of the Promised Land,
but Mr. Shortt could not at present
inform him; and Mr. PRINGLE's pertin-
ent inquiry as to whether British soldiers
would have equal access to it was also
fruitless.
Mr. Holt protested against the CHAN-
CELLOR whittling away his resources
by certain trifling abatements. All
he wanted was the abolition of the
Excess Profits Tax. Unfortunately Mr.
moment to abandon three hundred
millions of revenue.
In the House of Lords, Lord SouTH-
wARK moved the Second Reading of his
Bill to establish a decimal system of
coinage. The motion was supported
by some ingenious arguments, but the
majority of the Peers shared the
historic opinion of Lord RANDoIPH
CHURCHILL, who “never could under-
stand what those d d little dots
meant,” for they unanimously agreed
to the adjournment of the debate.
Wednesday, June 5th.-Mr. PEMBER-
Tox BILLING, fresh from his strange
triumph in the law-courts, was early
on the scene and plainly anxious to put
himself in evidence. But the SPEAKER
is not Mr. Justice DARLING, and success-
fully suppressed most of Mr. BILLING's
Supplementary Questions.
A white hat of remarkable dimen-
sions adorning the capaci-
ous brow of Sir ARTHUR
FELL gave rise to a theory
that the worthy knight is
the gentleman who went
to Epsom yesterday to see
the Derby run. But there
is no more truth in that
than in the other story
that the unusual size of his
headgear is due to its con-
taining a section of the
Channel Tunnel, with
which he essays to convert
the sceptical.
The War has produced
no stranger paradox than
the case of the gentleman
who within the space of
seven days was sentenced
to six months' imprison-
ment for a breach of the Defence of the
Realm regulations and recommended
for the Order of the British Empire on
account of good service to the country.
The fact that the recommendation was
withdrawn hardly justified Mr. OUTH-
wAITE's assumption that a sentence
under the Defence of the Realm Act
was regarded as the higher honour of
the two.
Thursday, June 6th.-None of the
Birthday Honours was more worthily
earned than the Privy Councillorship
bestowed upon Mr. CLYNEs. The
Ministry of Food is immensely in-
debted to the unassuming manner and
sound commonsense of its Parlia-
mentary Secretary.
His review of #. work of his depart-
ment was clear and encouraging. The

As the next step in the course of its
rapid development into a Universal Pro-
vider, the Ministry will shortly under-
take the wholesale collection, distri-

In certain critical or captious quarters.

From the vernacular, and write in Attic

Words of balm these to middle-aged
recruits on a torrid May morning. Moist
and weary and surfeited with militarism,
I threw myself down on a green level
where the long grass looked cool and
inviting; and there I lay, smoking a
cigarette and picking daisies and dande-
lions abstractedly. Suddenly I became
conscious that I was being addressed.
“Thank you, Sir. You're a gent.

they asked questions about the War,
about London and about the great

answer them. -
. It was high if premature summer;
the sky was blue, the hedges and the
grass were growing almost audibly, the
birds sang, the sun blazed and I walked
up two or three hills without the faintest
enthusiasm. -
Just after the top of the last hill,
when I had again resumed my seat (at
the risk once more of lifting the pony
into the zenith), the ladies simultane-
ously uttered a shrill cry of dismay.
“Look!” they exclaimed; “there's

as white as a recent ratting foray in a
wet ditch would allow. |
“Bunty 1 Bunty' you wicked dog!"
To this question Bunty made no reply,
but merely subsided under the hedge,
where a little shade was possible, into
an attitude of exhaustion tempered by
wariness.
“How very naughty!” said my
hostess. “I left her in the house.”
“Yes,” said the daughter, “and if
she's going to go off hunting like this
what on earth shall we do? There'll
be complaints from everyone. She's
never done it before.” -
“Come, Bunty!” said my hostess,
in the wheedling tones of dog-owners
whose dogs (it is notorious) obey their
slightest word. But Bunty sat tight.
“If wedrive on perhaps she'll follow,”
said the daughter, and we drove on a few
yards; but Bunty did not move.
We stopped again, while coaxing
noises were made calculated to soften
the hearts of rocks; but Bunty refused
to stir. -
“She'll come on later,” I suggested.
“Oh, no,” said her elderly mistress,
“we couldn't risk leaving her here,
when she's never gone off alone before.
Bunty Bunty' don't be so naughty.
| But Bunty merely glittered at us
through her white-hair entanglement
and remained perfectly still.
Strange dogs are not much in my
line; but since my hostess was no longer
very active, and the daughter was driv-
ing, and no one else was present, there
seemed to be a certain inevitableness
about the proposition which I then
made that I should get out and bring
the miscreant in.
“Oh, would you mind?” my hostess
said. “She won't bite, I promise you.
She's a perfect dear.”
Trying hard to forget how painful to
legs or hands can be the smart closing
of the snappy jaws of dogs that won't
bite, I advanced stealthily towards
Bunty, murmuring ingratiating words.
When I was quite close she turned
over on her back, lifted her paws
and obviously commended her soul to
Heaven; and I had therefore no diffi-
culty in lifting her up and carrying her
to the trap.
Her mistresses received her with rap-
ture, camouflaged, but by no means
successfully, by reproach and reproof,

they cried; “how dare you go hunting?”
and we were beginning to drive on
Come along, there's a dear little Bunty.”

again, when an excited voice called
upon us to stop, and another lady, of
the formidable unmarried kind, with a
very red face beneath a purple parasol,
confronted us.
“What,” she panted, “is the mean-
ing of this outrage? How dare you

“Your dog, Madam?” I began.
“It's no use denying it,” she burst
in, “I saw you do it. I saw you pick

Meanwhile, it cannot be denied, the

“We ought to know our own dog

does not disdain a fight.
“Certainly,” said the angry lady, “if
you have a dog of your own.”
“Of course we have,” said the
daughter; “we have a West Highland
named Bunty.”
“This happens to be my West High-
land, named Wendy,” said the lady,
“as you will see if you look on the
collar. My name is there too—Miss
Morrison, 14, Park Terrace, W. I am
staying at Well House Farm.”
And it was so.
It was on the tip of my tongue to
point out that collars, being easily ex-
changeable, are not evidence; but I
thought it better that any such sugges-
tion should come from the owners.
“It is certainly very curious,” said
the daughter, submitting the features
of the dog to the minutest scrutiny;
“if it is not Bunty it is her absolute
double.”
“It is not Bunty, but Wendy,” said
Miss Morrison coldly; “and I shall be
glad if you will give her to me.”
“But ” the daughter began.
“Yes, give the lady the dog,” said
the mother.
SolomoN would, of course, have cut
the little beast in two; but in his
absence there was nothing for it but
to surrender; and the pair went off
together, the dog exhibiting every sign
of pleasure.
Meanwhile the daughter whipped up
the pony, and we soon entered the gates.
In the drive we found Bunty await-
ing us.
“There!" cried the ladies, as they
scrambled out and flung themselves on
her.
“Of course she's not a bit like that

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Return of the Soldier (NISBET) is really a story of a
single situation; but that situation is so full of dramatic
possibilities, and, I may add, so well handled by the author,
that on every page I kept asking myself how it was to end.
There are not many pages, less than two hundred all told,
so that you can quite easily see the thing through at a
sitting; and I shall certainly be surprised if you do not.
Let me briefly give you a start with the situation, avoiding,
in justice to Miss REBECCA WEST, any hint as to its develop-
ment. Shortly, then, it concerns a very charming officer,
verging upon middle-life, who lives in the home of his
ancestors with a pleasant sister and a pretty, rather too
fastidiously perfect wife, both of whom adore him. Now
suppose the man to incur a form of shell-shock which
obliterates from his mind all events of the past fifteen years,
so that, while retaining his own individuality, he regards
his perfect wife as an entire stranger, and (worse than this)
reverts to a youthful passion for the daughter of a riverside
inn-keeper, a lady who (worst of all) proves to be living,
quite unattractively to eyes not love-blinded, within far too
easy proximity to the perfect home. Well, there you are. As
I say, I shall leave you to pursue the intrigue for yourself;
the delicacy and skill of its working out will abundantly
reward you. Miss WEST writes strongly and with an
agreeably sure instinct for the right word; her comparisons
in particular are both original and trenchant. It was there-
fore the greater shock to find her employing that hideous
and detestable vulgarism, to “swank,” whose admission to
any considered prose (however modern in tone) is nothing
It has been said that anyone should be able to write at
least one readable book—the story of his own life. When
the writer is a person who has not only been successful
beyond the ordinary measure in his chosen profession, but
is able to bring to what is clearly an agreeable survey
trained literary tastes and perceptions, the result is assured.
Sir Edward CLARKE, in The Story of My Life (MURRAY),
adds to these qualifications the last touch necessary, a most
admirable frankness. He asks for neither praise nor blame;
denies neither his exceptional gifts nor his fair and favour-
able opportunities; is nowise concerned to minimise defeat
or to under-rate victory, but presents his history with a
completeness of philosophy as marked as his freedom from
the habit of philosophising. In the result he gives, how-
ever unconsciously, an impression of real British inde-
pendence and solidity, more sane than brilliant, rather
balanced than constructive, made lovable by a touch of
obstinacy, saved by a wealth of common sense. With such
a character it is perhaps no wonder that he succeeded more
completely at the Bar than as a politician. It might even
have been foreseen that sooner or later he was bound to
separate from any stereotyped political party, and it is
a tribute to his honesty (whatever the merits of the par-
ticular controversies) that on at least three notable occasions
he refused to follow his leaders. Sir Edward CLARKE's
chapters bring back memories of many famous trials, the
Penge mystery, the Baccarat case and others; but to-day,
when it is not very easy to realise the possibility of con-
centration on matters relatively so trivial, it is the man
himself, sturdy old warrior that he is, whom one cares most
to meet in his pages.

“Boyd CABLE” chiefly excels; indeed I sometimes think his
humour a little laboured. He is the constructive historian
of the heroic detail of the War—detail that helps the civilian
to understand, and detail that will be crowded out of any
future history, and might therefore be without record if it
were not for such an imaginatively truthful chronicle as Front
Lines (MURRAY). I don't see how any direct account of a
dress-rehearsal attack, of an ordinary crawling reconnais-
sance, of the work of a labour battalion, of gunners in a
water-logged area, or of the Red Cross rank-and-file could
be as actually informing as “According to Plan,” “In the
Mist,” “A Roaring Trade,” “Bring up the Guns !” and
“Stretcher-bearers.” You get an astonishing effect of truth-
fulness quite beyond the range, it seems to me, of a more
artful story-teller. We owe it to our fellows out there at
least to understand what they are going through, and to
I am beginning to be impatient with authors who write
books and then apologise for publishing them. In nine
cases out of ten this deprecatory tone is quite unwarrantable,
and By-Ways on Service (CoNSTABLE) is certainly not a
tenth case. Very quietly and shrewdly Lieutenant HECTOR
DINNING relates his experiences in the Australian Imperial
Expeditionary Force, and his chapters on Egypt alone make
his apology superfluous. He sees things with fresh and
observing eyes, and he has a most receptive mind. From
Egypt he went to Gallipoli, thence back again to Egypt,
and from there to France. And all the time he was taking
notice, and now he gives us his impressions straight from
the shoulder. “War is not fun; neither is it ennobling,”
he writes, and his whole attitude is a protest against the
fluff and flummery with which some of our writers have
tried to hide its agonies. But no one can read these pages
ourselves lest at any time we
should think of the ludicrously
trivial inconveniences of the
war-régime on the home front
as anything to grumble about.
And “Boyd CABLE" gives us
this understanding.
Since to shepherd a play to
successful production is, even in
ordinary circumstances, among
the most baffling of enterprises,
I have the greater admiration
for the hero of Lord John in
New York (METHUEN), whose
triumph as dramatist—“when
the applause forced the curtain
up again and again”—was won
under conditions which it is
only fair to call altogether ex-
ceptional. This Lord John had
written a detective play, or
rather a novel from which some-
body else had made a detective
play; and on the eve of its
American production he received
a cable saying that one, Roger
Odell, an all-powerful press-
magnate, had sworn, for no dis-
closed reason, to smash the
entire show. What was Lord
'ohn to do? Personally, being
Critical Butcher. “WHO EVER SAW FEATHERS ON A SKEWER2"
without feeling that, although
Mr. DINNING realises the horrors
of war, he also is proud of the
share the Australians have taken
in it and will take in it until
the evil is scotched. Perhaps
in these hurrying days it is
hopeless to expect a popular
acclaim for a book so thoughtful
as this, but some day it will
come into its own.
In the early days of the War,
when the United States were
being drenched with German
war literature, a remarkable
series of articles by MARY
Roberts RINEHART, a special
correspondent of The Saturday
Evening Post, did much to
acquaint Americans with the
Allies' war efforts. At that time
|British officialdom regarded pro-
|paganda as bad form and was
playing stolidly into German
hands. It was as a novelist,
however—one of that brilliant
galaxy of story-tellers which has
|built up, chiefly through the
medium of The Saturday Even-
ing Post, a spirited school of
American fiction—that Mrs.
of a cautious nature, I should have abandoned New York
as unpromising and despatched the play to WYNDHAM's
in the hope that Roger Odell and Mr. GERALD DU
MAURIER might be mutually unacquainted. This, however,
was not the method of Lord John. On the contrary, invalid
as he was, he caught the earliest boat to the States, and
by the end of the first chapter (mark me, the first chapter')
of his adventures there he had not only settled the play
difficulty but tracked down a double murderer and united
Odell to the girl of his heart. Chapter Two brings us to the
opening night, whose brilliance was something marred by
Odell's sister, who fainted in a box because (so far as I could
gather) she had observed a gentleman in the stalls with an
eye at the back of his neck. Somewhere about also were
a lady in a grey mask and ă child in a collapsible trunk;
but do not ask me who or why, since before the end of this
episode I had abandoned all hope of keeping pace with the
incredible absurdities of the intrigue. Its publishers call
this farrago of impossible melodrama a “typical” C. N.
and A. M. WILLIAMSON book. In mere justice to the repu-
RINEHART made her reputation. I wish I could go on
to say that Long Live the King (MURRAY) fully sustains
that reputation and does ample justice to the art of the
creator of the inimitable Tish, but the fact is that what
may be called the “Ruritania” novel, though it still has
power to entertain, no longer offers scope for brilliant or
imaginative writing. Long Live the King has the finished
manner of the accomplished novelist, but the characters are
all out of stock. Karnia is the semi-Balkan principality
seething with revolution, General Mettlich the blood-and-
iron Chancellor; and we have all the other old puppets, the
unscrupulous lady-in-waiting, the necessary anarchist, the
princess (heroine) and handsome young lieutenant (hero).
Of course one is always young enough to enjoy this sort
of story and Mrs. RINEHART tells it well, but I hope she
will go back to Tish.

THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
I DISAPPROVE of profiteering;
Though envy never stirred my bile,
I own I've done a lot of sneering
At patriots who have made their pile;
Virtue (I hold with him who said it)
Its own unique reward should be;
But still I count it no discredit
To pouch an M.B.E.
I camouflaged my sense of duty;
It's not my fault if I have been
Selected as a thing of beauty;
I did my best to blush unseen;
But merit, though you may disguise it,
Will out at last and earn the fee
Bestowed on worth by those who prize
it,
And so I'm M.B.E.
Others in manhood's prime were
tempted
To challenge fate across the foam,
But I preferred to be exempted
And help my country nearer home;
I felt that I could better serve her
By noble deeds this side the sea;
And now they've recognised my fervour
*And made me M.B.E.
I had a friend who took a fancy
For the delight of battle's shock,
And, being shelled to bits in France, he
Got his discharge—a hopeless crock.

While I'm an M.B.E.

I AM an inveterate pipe-smoker. I
find that tobacco has a soothing effect
on the brain, though my greatest friends
tell me that I smoke a good deal more
than is absolutely necessary for the pur-
pose indicated.
My actual needs in matches are one
big box every two days, and during the
shortage I have made a rule of asking
in every tobacconist's for a box. The
answer has been almost invariably the
same, but as there is usually a lighted
gas-jet on the counter I come away
satisfied—for the time being.
This is, however, a tiring amusement,
so when, the other day, I discovered a
shop with a good supply of wooden
vestas I bought a box and kept the
information to myself.
Two days afterwards I went in for
another box.
“Oh, no, Sir, not to-day,” said the
tobacconist. “We’re rationed. I must
let my other customers 'ave some. I
don't mind if you come, say, twice a
week.” As I went out he fired off:
“There's a war on.”
“Two more matchless days,” I said;
“never!” And, my mind working
quickly, I went westward to a theatrical
costumier's.
Making my way to the face-fringe
counter I asked for a complete set of
hirsutes.
After a good deal of adverse criticism
(from the proprietor) of my features as
a setting for his artistic growths, I
chose a slightly forked beard with upper
and side panels to match, and called a
dress-rehearsal for eleven o'clock.
I debated with myself as to a favour-
able person on whom to test my dis-
guise, and finally selected my old friend,
Harold Potter, as being innocent and
without guile; a solicitor—need I say
more ?
As an amateur actor I have always
prided myself on my elocutionary
powers, and, arriving at Sloper, Son,
Nixon & Nephews (under which title
my friend solicits), I summoned from
the vasty deep the bass voice I keep for
“Third Citizens” and “Voices With-
out" and inquired for Harold.
I was ushered into the presence
under the name of Tomlinson. For-
tunately the voice held as I said, “Mr.
Harold Potter, I believe?”
“That depends,” he said. “If you've
anything to do with a subscription I'm
only Mr. Potter's clerk, and if you're
connected with the Income Tax people
I'm simply ‘out.’”
“In the matter of Vestas Limited,”
I said briefly. -
“Ah, that 's better,” said Harold,
a vigorous course of ablutions with in-
visible soap. “Yes, I'm Mr. Potter.
You wish to consult me about this case,
I suppose 2"
“I merely wish,” I said, “to make
sure of my ground before appealing.”
“Ah, I see,” he said, “you are acting
for one of the parties and * -
“I’m acting for you, my dear old
sport; and I think I've acted jolly
well,” I added, working the control
lever and removing the hirsuflage.
When Harold had recovered from
his seizure I re-entrenched myself be-
hind my wire-entanglement and moved
On
I received additional evidence of dis-
guise en route to the tobacconist's. I
passed, unrecognized, several acquaint-
ances and even obtained a light from
one of them.
Boldly I entered the vestal halls,
boldly I asked for a box of matches,
leaning at the same time, from force of
habit, towards the gas jet to light my
1 Oe.
º do not think it fair in these days,
when nerves are not what they were,
that motor tyres should be allowed to
burst with a noise like the first-fruits of
a daylight air-raid close at hand. Such
an explosion occurring at the moment
when I was leaning almost over the gas
jet, my body responded to the shock by
a forward movement, and nothing short
of the instant removal of my expensive
face-fittings prevented a serious con-
flagration. My exposure was complete.
The tobacconist said nothing; he just
smiled an easy smile of recognition.
But as I regained the street the old
formula floated after me through the
open door: “There's a war on.”
-
CEDRIC.
THERE are times when I feel I could
say something very cutting to Cedric.
Cedric came into my life a few weeks
ago, and I have a suspicion that he
came in because somebody left the
garden gate open. As a matter of fact
we are running an allotment between
us, and I can honestly say that his
ideas are not mine. When I saw him
at work the other morning I turned over
a flower-pot and sat down thinking
hard things about Cedric.
Then I decided to give him a stiff
drink of germicide, and Cedric merely
looked up and asked for more.
But there is a bad time in store for
him. I have just painted an iron stick
to look like a cabbage-stalk. Now I
am going to sit down and watch him

rounded like an Arab, coal-black, with
a silky tail reaching to her fetlocks,

we called her.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BEST SMELL OF ALL.
WHEN noses first were carved for men
Of varied width and height,
Strange smells and sweet were fashioned
then
That all might know delight—
Smells for the hooked, the snub, the fine,
The pug, the gross, the small,
A smell for each, and one divine
Last smell to soothe them all.
The baccy smell, the smell of peat,
The rough gruff smell of tweed,
The rain smell on a dusty street
Are all good smells indeed;
The sea smell smelt through resinous
trees,
The smell of burning wood,
The saintly smell of dairies—these
Are all rich smells and good.
And good the smell the nose receives
From new-baked loaves, from hops,
From churches, from decaying leaves,
From pinks, from grocers' shops;
And smells of rare and fine bouquet
Proceed, the world allows,
From petrol, roses, cellars, hay,
Scrubbed planks, hot gin and cows.
But there's a smell that doth excel
All other smells by far,
Even the tawny stable smell
Or the boisterous smell of tar;
A smell stupendous, past compare,
The king of smells, the prize,
That smell which floods the startled air
When home-cured bacon fries l
All other smells, whate'er their worth,
Though dear and richly prized,
Are earthy smells and of the earth,
Are smells disparadised;
But when that smell of smells awakes
From ham of perfect cure,
It lifts the heart to heaven and makes
The doom of Satan sure.
How good to sit at twilight's close
In a warm inn and feel
That marvellous smell caress the nose
With promise of a meal!
How good when bell for breakfast rings
To pause, while tripping down,
And snuff and snuff till Fancy brings
All Arcady to Town |
But best, when day's first glimmerings
break
Through curtains half withdrawn,
To lie and smell it, scarce awake,
In some great farm at dawn;
Cocks crow ; the milkmaid clanks the
pails;
The housemaid bangs the stairs;
And BACON suddenly assails
The nostrils unawares.
Noses of varied width and height
Doth kindly Heaven bestow,
And choice of smells for our delight
Noses and smells for all the race
That on this earth do dwell,
And for a final act of grace
The astounding bacon smell.
THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY.
“HULLo, my boy-eel" came from
the O.P. to the battery; “that you,
Mumbo-o 2"
And then suddenly the voice changed
to a deep basso profondo:
“Oom-ah—your—Commander—sa-
lutes you!”
“And who are you, my good man?”
replied Mumbo in a voice evidently
meant for a counter-imitation of the
same voice, although it lacked some-
thing in timbre—“who are you? Oom-
ah, yes, the Forward Observer. Do you
know what you are, my good fellow 2
You are the eyes of the guns—remem-
ber that. Shake hands with me. Now
write home and tell your people about
it.”
“Rotten; absolutely rotten imita-
tion; not a bit like him,” came from
the O.P. “Now listen to this.”
But Mumbo did not listen, for, turn-
ing, he had caught sight of a pair of
splendid sparklingfield boots descending
into the dug-out. Breathlessly he waited
for the rest to appear. Heavens ! it
was the Great One himself.
“Well, my boy,” said the well-known
voice, “and where is your battery com-
mander ?”
“He's visiting the battalions, Sir,"
said Mumbo, thanking Heaven that
probably the gas-proofing blanket had
prevented his being overheard.
“Oom-ah | " (Heavens ! it was like
Steve's imitation, astonishingly so).
“Sorry to have missed him. Tell your
Battery Commander that your General
has visited the battery. Let all the
men whom I have not seen know that
I, their General, have visited them.”
Burr-burr went the telephone.
“Oom-ah who is that ?”
“Only the O.P., Sir.”
“Ah, the Forward Observer. Let me
speak to him. Are you there?"
“Is that you, Mumbo?” called Steve
in the distance.
“No, no, my boy,” roared the General
heartily, “this is not—oom-ah, Mumbo;
it is your GENERAL speaking. It is your
GENERAL ringing up to congratulate
you personally. You, my boy, are the
eyes of the guns, remember that . . .”
“Rotten" was the word that cut
short this eulogy. “Rotten, old son;
not a bit like it.”
“What!” The pained surprise in
the General's voice sent a cold shiver
down Mumbo's back.
“Not a bit like it,” reiterated Steve
“Not a bit like what, Sir? Do you
know who I am? It is I, your GENERAL,
ringing up . . .”
“Oh, chuck it, old bird; you'll
damage your larynx.” -
“What—what the devil do you mean,
Sir 2" -
“That's a bit better,” admitted Steve
grudgingly. “You've got the intona-
tion all right; but the voice, my boy,
the voice—put more body into it, try a
little E.F.C. port.”
“I–I—I-” began the General.
“No, no, no, don't hurry it; do it by
numbers. On the command “One," lay
back your head on your collar; ‘Two,"
press down the uvula; ‘Three,' open
the mouth wide and—and pull the
string, as it were, and let the voice roll
cut from the chest.”
“Look here, Sir wn -
“No, no, you'll never do it like that.
Listen to this now : Oom-ah, and who
are you, my boy 2 " (and at the sound
of his own voice, apparently, the General
started violently). “A sentry? No, my
boy, you are more than that, my boy.
You—are one—of the furthest outposts
—of the whole—British—Empire, my
boy! Remember that. I, your General
—salute you ! That's a bit more like
it—what?” he broke off triumphantly.
“Confound your impertinence!” came
the full-blooded explosion of wrath.
“Ha! hal Splendid—that's ever so
much better, old cock.”
“What!” the tone rose to a squeak.
“There, now you've gone off again,”
said a disappointed voice. “You must
—lay—your—head—back on your collar
and 1 p.
“Cease this damnable impersonation,
Sir.”
“Damnable! It's better than you
could ever get it, anyway.”
. But Heaven in its mercy, through the
medium of the infamous Hun, decreed
that a perfectly good General should not
throw away his life in a mere attempt
to express the inexpressible. At that
moment the line to the O.P. went to
bits.
It appeared (after a befitting pause)
that the General had a sense of humour.
He admitted as much ; he also stated
that he could always see a joke, even
against himself; but just as Mumbo
was beginning to breathe more freely it
also began to appear that this was not
one of those particular jokes. It was
in fact a clear case in which discip-
linary, action should be taken. Dis-
cipline, he feared, seemed to be lacking
throughout the whole battery.
Meantime, far off, and by devious
routes unknown to Great Ones, there
scurried an orderly, hot and perspiring,
to bring the news to the O.P. that it
That all some joy may know;
had been the General himself speaking
decisively.

and that a personal visit to the O.P.
was projected. It was a lonely and de-
pressed Mumbo who returned to the
dug-out after seeing a suspiciously
polite General off the premises.
Burr-burr–through at last to the
O.P.' A gleam came into Mumbo's
eyes. The opportunity was too good
to be missed, and the General could not
be at the O.P. for half-an-hour at least.
“Hullo-oo! Is that D.K. 2”
“Is that O.P. 2” said Mumbo gruffly.
“Yes, who—who is that ?” asked
Steve with extraordinary politeness.
“It is I, your GENERAL, speaking,”
said Mumbo ominously.
“Oh I—I–I'm sorry, Sir. I'm
afraid I didn't know your voice just
now.”
“Oom-ah! You seemed to have a
very fair idea of it,” replied Mumbo,
grinning at the absolutely helpless
humility in the other's tone.
“I—I’m sorry, Sir. I—I had no
idea you were coming to us, Sir. I
mean to say, as they had been shelling
us, I—I couldn't possibly expect that
you would.”
“Confound it !” roared Mumbo, “do
you think that I, your GENERAL, fear
to go where my men can go? Do you
think that if my place were not else-
where I should wish to be anywhere
“I'm—I'm sorry, Sir. I didn't mean
that—” -
“Then what the devil did you mean?”
“I—I don't know, Sir. I'm awfully
sorry, Sir. I hope you won't take it as
disrespectful, Sir; it was only a joke,
Sir—bad joke, Sir, of course, Sir, but
meant—er—kindly, you know, Sir. I'm
sure we're all very—er—proud that you
should come to see us, especially when
there's shelling going on—no, I don't

rather we're glad they're shelling be-
cause you're here—that is, I'm sure
you would—er—come through a bar-
rage, Sir, to see us if you thought we'd

This was too much.
“Idiot!” howled Mumbo in his own
voice. “Who said my imitation wasn't
any good?”
“What—is that Mumbo 2 I say,
wasn't it awful ? Did he catch you
at it 2 ”
“No, I'm all right, but you're for it,
my boy,” gloated Mumbo; “he was
very nice to me, but I expect he's
saving all the other things for you.
Did you tell the old boy to lay his head

“Lordy, I told him to try E.F.C.

MIR. PUNCH'S WAR L’ICTURES.
“THE ONLY FIT PLACE REMAINING FOR A GENTLEMAN TO LIVE IN.”
Monday, June 10th. — The moving
history of GoLDSTEIN BEY was narrated
by Mr. BALFour with much gusto.
This Jewish gentleman, born in Alex-
andria of Hungarian parents, had been
in the Egyptian Postal Department for
thirty-two years when the War broke
out. Being technically an enemy alien
he was then dismissed from the Service,
but three months later he had the
happy thought of being naturalized as
a Russian, and was immediately rein-
stated in his employment. As the
For EIGN SECRETARY appeared to see no
objection to this arrangement I infer
that, despite all his permutations of
allegiance, GoLDSTEIN BEY, in his
sympathies at any rate, “remains an
Englishman.”
The latest Irish grievance, as pre-
sented by Mr. RoNALD McNEILL, is
that the railway companies refuse to
convey fruit to Ireland. This may be
intended as an additional incentive to
Irishmen to enlist, for, according to
Mr. TICKLER, the Government have
played old gooseberry with the fruit-
trade, and there will be no jam for
anybody but sailors and soldiers.
Mr. McCURDY complained that all
the meat in cold storage at Northampton
has been condemned as unfit for food,
and that his constituents are faced with
the prospect of permanently meatless
plorers have been known to eat their
boots; but the citizens of Northampton,
though notoriously of opinion that for
most purposes there is nothing like lea-
ther, shrink from being reduced to such
extremities.
Tuesday, June 11th.-The attendant
Peers smacked their lips over Lord
WILLough BY DE BROKE's picture of
Ireland, where every form of sport,
from horse-racing to cock-fighting, flour-
ishes unrestricted; where the meat-
card is unknown, and where, for Sinn
Feiners at any rate, petrol flows as
freely as whiskey; in short “the only
fit place remaining for a gentleman to
live in.”
Lord CRAwFoRD thought the picture
overdrawn. Ireland was subject to
exactly the same regulations (whether
she observes them or not) as Great
Britain, save as regards food; and to
impose a rationing system upon her
would not be worth the trouble. In
fact the Government's attitude might be
summed up as Hoc volo, sic jubeo; sit pro
ratione voluntas, or, as some would read
it, voluptas. Lord SELBoRNE attributed
the Government's leniency to “the in-
sane view of creating an atmosphere in
which something incomprehensible was
to occur,” a phrase which might stand
for a good deal of British policy towards
Ireland since the Act of Union.
that the able-bodied denizens of this
fortunate isle should require some more
tangible inducement to leave it than
the mere honour of fighting for free-
dom. The Irish ATToRNEY-GENERAL
partly filled in the outlines of Lord
FRENCH's promise of land to Irish
recruits, but failed to satisfy the curio-
sity of a host of questioners.
Mr. ALEXANDER RICHARDsoN took the
oath on his election for Gravesend, in
succession to Sir GILBERT PARKER, who
has, on the advice of his doctor, aban-
doned his political connection with
“The Seats of the Mighty.” The House
could better have spared some of its
other exponents of the art of fiction.
“I should have thought everybody
knew where Bohemia is.” Thus Lord
Robert CECIL to Mr. OUTHWAITE, who
had pleaded for more public enlighten-
ment on this point. Lord RoPERT's
confidence in the geographical know-
ledge of his countrymen may be justi-
fied, but I rather doubt it. Most of
them only know of Bohemia as the place
where the Bohemian Girl came from.
Wednesday, June 12th.-A refreshing
innovation in Government procedure
was announced by Mr. MonTAGU. The
War Cabinet, being too busy just now
with other matters to give proper con-
sideration to his scheme of reform for
India, have decided to publish it first

days. In like circumstances Polar ex-
and form an opinion about it after hear-
One may deplore, but cannot wonder,

ing the criticisms. Of these there should
be no lack. Our Anglo-Indians are look-
ing forward to the time of their lives.
The multiplication of Departments
makes it increasingly difficult to know
to which of them any particular ques-
tion should be addressed. Still I don't
know by what mental process Colonel
BURN decided that the Ministry of Food
was the proper quarter in which to lodge
a complaint about newspaper restric-
tions. Lord RHoNDDA's jurisdiction is
ever widening, but up to the present it
does not include our mental pabulum.
Time was when the PostMASTER-
GENERAL's annual review was invari-
ably spiced with anecdotes about the
number of people who posted five-
pound notes in blank envelopes, and
similar facetiae. Possibly Mr. ILLING-
worTH, as the unwilling slayer of the
Penny Post, thought it would be in-
decent to move the House to mirth.
He resisted the temptation so success-
fully that several Members took excep-
tion to the dreariness of his speech.
Mr. SPENCER HUGHEs, on the contrary,
was delighted with it. As a professional
humourist I suppose he considers jocular
Ministers to be very little better than
blacklegs.
Mr. HERBERT SAMUEL, who urged Mr.
ILLINGworth to support the decimal
system, nominally on the ground that
by adding twenty-five per cent. to the
value of the penny, it would largely
increase the revenue of the Post Office,
but really, I am sure, in order that he
might drag in the old rhyme—
“‘You owe me five farthings,”
Said the bells of St. Martin’s.”
Thursday, June 13th.-Mr. BALFour
announced that Mrs. PANKHURST had
been granted a permit to visit the
United States because it was thought
advisable in the interests of the Allies.
Mr. KING's nimble intellect at once
leaped to the conclusion that she was be-
ing sent to repair the failure of previous
missionaries, e.g., his Grace of York.
But Mr. BALFour said that Dr. LANG's
visit had been a great success, and the
SPEAKER remarked that it was “a great
jump from Mrs. PANKHURST to the Arch-
bishop.” Not a greater jump, however,
than from the Militant Suffragette of
1914 to the peaceful envoy of 1918.

What can I do, queen, queen,
To hasten the hours along
When you grow weary of woodland

Weary of woodland song?
A cage of gossamer gold I will tie
On to a skylark's wing,
And there you shall hang in the midst

And tremble to hear him sing.

This is the boon that I ask—
Let me do service, mighty or mean,
Give me a task, a task.

Are there no dragons to fight?

And razors are not now what once they were.

And he returns, that he will find us shaved.
Shaved, did I say?—not duly, truly shaved,
But pranked with whiskers and bedecked with beards.
Oh, then what pleasure will be his to set

And strop the trenchant razor, and begin

A PUBLIC DEBT.
Mr. Punch invites the kind attention of his friends to the
Theatrical Garden Party which will be held in the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Regent's Park, on Tuesday, June 25th.
The weather, he understands, has been guaranteed, and the
programme includes a lavish assortment of most fascinating
stunts, to be presided over by the very flower of the Stage.
The Acting Profession has been so generous in the services
it has given on behalf of other charities that it has every
right to ask the help of the public for a cause of its very
own—the Actors' Orphanage. Tickets at 3s., free of tax
(on the day they will cost 5s, at the gate), may be obtained
at the Box Offices of all London Theatres. Those who
cannot go to the Theatrical Garden Party themselves will be
glad to buy tickets for the admission of wounded men. These
tickets should be sent to Sir JohnstoN Forbes-RoberTSON,

There shall be no more chats while we submit
at the Actors' Association, 32, Regent Street, W.1.

[JUNE 19, 1918.
AT THE OPERA.
“PHOEBUS AND PAN.”
THE late PoET LAUREATE would have
been much gratified if he could have as-
sisted at the Drury Lane adaptation of
BACH's cantata, Phoebus and Pan. He
might not have been greatly interested
in the composer's personal attack upon
his frivolous rivals, but he would have
thoroughly appreciated the triumph of
official poetry over its wanton critics
and parodists. -
I need hardly say that my own sym-
pathies were with the beaten side. I
don't pretend that the rather primitive
and German humour of Midas, who
adjudicated in favour of Pan (each
competitor is naively permitted to ap-
point his own judge), belongs to the
best type of refined badinage, but it
was more effective than the dull aca-
demical effusion of Phaebus. The
strangely arbitrary sentence by which
Midas was condemned to wear a pair
of asses' ears for his devotion to the
losing cause reminds me of a case, re-
cently reported from California,in which
the counsel who defended two prisoners
arrested for expressing pro-German
views was rebuked by the Bench for
his sympathies and awarded five years'
hard labour in a penitentiary.
Even Sir Thomas BEECHAM could not
persuade me that BAch's allegorical
cantata lends itself very happily to
operatic treatment, though a rather in-
different ballet was thrown in for relief.
As a sporting production I commend
it, but should have been well content
with my evening's entertainment if it
had been confined to the really admirable
performance of La Bohème. Madame
JEANNE BROLA as Mimi, and Mr.
WEBSTER MILLAR as Iºudolph, sang
delightfully. They were not MELBA and
CARUso, but they made up for that
defect by looking their parts and play-
ing them with great sincerity. I beg
leave to join a very enthusiastic audi-
ence in its appreciation of the fine work
that Sir THOMAS BEECHAM is doing at
Drury Lane. - O. S.

MR. MARcus BLANDFord's
GREATEST Novel,
THE MODULATIONs of
MEPHISTOPHELES.
The basic idea of this gorgeous and
Gargantuan romance is that all the per-
plexing dissonances of modern life can
be resolved by the adoption of a system
of Satanic polyphony, based on the
Rosicrucian principle of macro-cosmic
modulation.
First Review. “An abysmal work . . . pro-

who cannot teach and thinkers who will not

MR. MENANDER PAMPINGTON's
Most topical Book,
PATA GONIAN PERILS.
At the present juncture this narrative
of Mr. Pampington's adventures in Pata-
gonia is of unique topical interest. No
Englishman knows the country better,
and, owing to his great height (six feet
seven inches), he has been peculiarly at
home among the Patagonian giants.

In this exhilarating volume Miss East

received with mixed feelings; but mix-
tures are often essential to the mainten-

Who is “Somebody”? This ques-

mystified Mayfair since the appearance
of his or her first volume. The general
mark of a famous writer that there is
“Some” body in Somebody's vintage.
But the secret has been kept. Wild
horses would not drag it from Mr.
Jingle, though if the truth were known
“imagination's widest stretch" would
assuredly “in wonder die away.”
THE BI, EATINGS OF BUMBLEPUPPY.
The discovery of a new author, Mr.
Benjamin Snelgrove. “We want such
books as these,” writes a well-known
O.B.E. in a Foreword. “It exudes

says:—
“I think the Minister of Entertainment
ought to read this terrible book. I look for-
ward to the first sermon of the Rev. H. G.
WELLs upon it.”
PONDER OF PONDER'S END.
A first novel by Messalina Trotter,
of whom The Caviller remarks, “Her
book is worthy of her name.”
TO A NEW KNIGHT.
MoMENToUs sage of Mona's Isle,
Pride of your fellow-Manx,
Renowned alike upon the Nile
And by the Tiber's banks—
What though the critics, whom it irks
To watch your widening reign,
And elders of illiberal kirks
Affect a harsh disdain;
What though fastidious souls declare
Your style distinction lacks,
Or, boldly sacrilegious, dare
To mimic it, like “Max”;
So long as countless myriads hold
Your lucubrations dear,
And, side by side, the copies sold
Would circumvent the sphere?
Let pert reviewers carp and jibe,
Let jealous pens deride,
The interviewers, noble tribe,
Are solid on your side.
Have you not shown in all its bloom

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT was apparent early in the War that one of Germany's
industries which would have to be tackled very seriously
was the manufacture of guide-books. As the traveller's
mentor the late Herr BAEDEKER had established himself in
a position of strength equalled only by his compatriot, the
late Baron TAUCHNITZ, as the traveller's beguiler; and hard
work would be necessary to displace both. I see signs of
the most laudable enterprise and the most careful toil in
the substitute for Baedeker which the English publishing
firm of MACMILLAN and the French publishing firm of
HACHETTE have united to issue under the general title of
The Blue Guides, or Les Guides Bleus—London and Its
Environs, by FINDLAY MUIRHEAD. It is not quite so com-
pact a handbook, using the word in its strict meaning, as
the old red product of the Fatherland—the bulk is greater,
the paper is not so thin, the cover is a shade less limp—
but it is a wonderful compilation. One could wish, perhaps,
that the German model had not been followed quite so
closely, because, although that is a compliment to the
enemy, it also offers him a handle for some rather pointed
criticism of a kind which we in England prefer, as a rule, to
deliver rather than to receive; but I suppose that when
one is out to replace thoroughly one must be derivative
restaurants “exactly in the ancient way,” and I suppose
that the proprietors, when their stars—like the new one
above us—begin to disappear, will have just the same old
heartburnings; and there is the detachable little pamphlet
of coloured maps at the end and the survey of national art
at the beginning. Turning over the leaves of this book and
hunting (like a conscientious humane reviewer) for omis-
sions, and finding none, I am filled with admiration equally
for the Editor's thoroughness and for the indomitable
spirit of a publishing man, who, amid all the obstacles set
in his way by military requirements, can contemplate and
carry through so vast and exacting a task. And now may
the dogs of war speedily return to their kennels, so that
travellers from all over the world (except two or three
countries in Central Europe) may hasten to London and

Mr. MARMADUKE PICKTHALL has for some time been one
of our literary specialists upon Eastern topics. His latest
volume, Oriental Encounters (CoLLINs), is really a fragment
of autobiography that explains this happy choice. In his
short preface, a piece of reminiscence naively self-revealing,
Mr. PICKTHALL tells us how at eighteen, having already
“failed in one or two adventures” (one reflects that he must
have started rather early), he found himself through parental
generosity launched upon a course of Oriental travel. With

luring effect one can imagine, given an impressionable and
sensitive lad of the disposition that the author shows him-
self to have had. Indeed, apart from the obvious appeal of
these picturesque scenes of Judean and Syrian wanderings,
I myself found a special charm in the sense of youthful
adventure that they most vividly convey. There is a holi-
day, even truant-playing, atmosphere about Mr. PICRTHALL's
recollections, wonderfully rejuvenating. Thus in each varied
encounter you may draw your pleasure not only from the
strange types, the dragoman, the soldier, judge, mountain-
chief, and a score of others whom this adolescent critic
sketches so brightly, but fully as much from the spec-
tacle of the boy-errant watching with unstaled eyes all
the colour and pageantry of a life that others of his age less
fortunate know only in books or dreams. It is this unusual
combination of traveller's tale and youthful memory that
gives the book its unique appeal.
I have already pleasant knowledge of the skill of Mrs.
turely and mis-shapen in its growth, it is sent out upon the
world immature and apologetic.” I hope I shall never
think of being as rude as that to any book, and indeed
I have no hard things to say of this one, except that I
did not feel comfortable about its facetiousness. When
however you grow accustomed to Mr. LEARY's brand of
humour you will be quick to admit that he has something
very considerable to say. He makes us understand and
appreciate the independent nature of the New Zealanders,
and we can see them at Samoa developing from an undis-
ciplined crowd of patriots into the real thing. Of course
the question of saluting is discussed, and here we get to
the root of the matter. For myself I am glad enough to
salute this “mis-shapen” child of Mr. LEARY because it
has in it the spirit which is going to beat the Hun.

Mrs. DUDENEY is without her sterner, even hauntingly
grim moods; “Good Grape Wine” proves the contrary–
a quite ugly yet compelling picture (tragedy on a Thumb
Nail) of maternal devotion gone wrong, which you will not
find it easy to forget. Throughout, the War is used by Mrs.
DUDENEY in its only legitimately artistic way as a solvent
of character. One sees that even in such lighter sketches
as, for example, “The Invasion,” which forms an interesting
companion picture to certain almost exactly similar inci-
dents in HARDY's Trumpet Major. A coincidence of casual
reading brought this comparison home to me, emphasising
how almost exactly a centurylater our island history has thus
repeated itself. It may well happen that posterity (already
so greatly in our debt) will owe something to Mrs. DUDENEy
for her Thumb Nail sketches of conditions happily by that
time become only a half-credited legend.
I am tempted to quote Mr. L. P. LEARy's description of his
book, The New Zealanders in Samoa (HEINEMANN), because
it is the frankest criticism I have ever known an author to
pass upon his own work. “A child of chance,” he writes,
a prospect of many years.
Tumblefold (JENKINs) purports to be a record, by one
who has climbed from the pit, of memories of childhood in a
Wolverhampton alley. He tells of the friendship and adven-
tures of five boys, four of the normal, rough-and-tumble,
quarrelling kind, and the fifth, delicate and gentle, slipping
out of the alliance before childhood was over, because there
was something badly the matter with the drains. The
writer, Mr. Joseph WHITTAKER, is at his best when he
is simplest. When the more dramatic episodes are em-
broidered in retrospect, such as the murder in Irish Row,
he produces an effect of unreality and strain after effect—
easy enough faults where the subject-matter is full of tragic
possibilities. But I must not give the impression that the
book is overshadowed with gloom. It is chiefly concerned
with the games, the tricks and the feuds of the five friends,
who had in their own way quite a good time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“JUNE AND THE GENERAL STAFF.”
Away went the representative of the
Junior General Staff, over hill and
dale, through ditch and hedge, climb-
ing in and out of shell holes, heedless
of barbed wire and oblivious of loose
cables. Scarcely pausing to take a
briar from his neck he pressed on and
on, groping blindly for obstacles that
were not and stumbling, kicking and
squirming over obstacles that were.
Soon, however, his distress became
more acute, his footsteps began to flag
and then suddenly, as a more violent
paroxysm than usual overtook him,
he sat down helplessly on a coil of
wire and sneezed and sneezed—and
SNEEZED !
Alas, poor Pink William' the cry
of “Summer is here" brought no an-
swering thrill in his bosom. Every
year at 9 A.M. on the 1st of June (the
very day when the sport of “clout-
casting” begins) it started—the dreaded
hay-fever—and then no longer did the
brightest, gayest and pinkest of the
Junior General Staff wend his way along
the line with a cheery word for C.O.'s
and a deprecating smile for Tommies
eating things out of a tin. No longer
was it a thing of joy to chase round
historic localities to see if the infantry
had put as much work on the ground as
they had on paper. With streaming
eyes and nose aglow he would wander
on, maintaining some sort of direction
only by an occasional opening of one
saturated eye, and all the time blowing
fearful blasts into his corduroy hand-
kerchiefs, that being the only fabric
capable of withstanding the terrible
explosions. When Pink William threw
back his head to sneeze strong men
flung themselves on their faces.
So there he sat mopping his moist
eyes and sniffing desperately at bottles
of menthol and eucalyptus. It was a
bad day, but the fault was more or less
his own—he was the first to admit that.
If you are careless enough to anoint a
sensitive and tingling nostril with anti-
septic toothpaste instead of the sooth-
ing “Nasarine,” what can you expect 2
Yet, rolling in agony as he was, his
sense of duty prevailed. Come what
might he must get his reconnaissance
done and be back at the Corps by
3 P.M., in order to mount guard at
the telephone while his superior officer
did his usual liaison work on the polo
ground.
So, burying his face in his sixteenth
handkerchief, he plunged boldly forward
again, recklessly trampling down the
double apron wire fences of reserve
lines as he went. Behind him toiled
Buzzy Harrison, a grim and perspiring
be very near now,” thought Buzzy,
“when the Staff gets the wind up as
much as this.” “Soon, soon it will be
over,” was all that was in Pink William's
mind as he retrieved his twentieth hand-
kerchief from the hedge into which
he had sneezed it. This comforting
thought brought them to a company
headquarters situated in a ruin close to
the reserve line.
In a croaking voice he asked if things
were all right.
“Yes,” said the Company Com-
mander; “but he's been shelling us all
the morning. Sends them over regu-
larly every hour - r

trench, went the covey.
“Gas!" shouted the Company Com-
mander, dashing along the trench. Get
your helmets on, everybody " And in
thirty seconds everybody had disguised
himself as a truffle-hunter.
But who was that ? Who was that
officer there, careless of all danger,
standing up in the open like Ajax defy-
ing the gas-precautions?
It was Pink William. The acrid
smoke and a whiff of gas had set him
off again. Gone was his gas-mask,
blown into the middle distance by one
mighty crashing sneeze. Careless of
the consequences he turned deliberately
in the direction of the enemy's gas and
sneezed and sneezed—and SNEEZED.
Whew - whop, whew - whop, whew-
whop ! came the shells thicker than
before; but nobody noticed them, for,
quicker than most thoughts, down
came Pink William's counter-barrage
of “Atishoo, Atishoo, ATIs Hoo-oo!'"
The Hun demurred. What was the
use of wasting good gas shell if it was
going to be dispersed harmlessly?
Again he tried, a wicked little bunch
of 77's, 4.2's, and 5.9's mixed. Pah !
it seemed the merest zephyr by com-
parison with this human Boreas.
He stopped. With a few well-directed
sneezes Pink William effectually dis-
posed of the lingering fumes and then
with the help of able and willing hands
staggered into the trench, where he lay
for so long without breathing that they
became alarmed. Only his poor nose
glowed; otherwise he showed no sign
of life.
“Give him respiration drill," cried
the Platoon Sergeant. “No, not “respir-
ator' drill, you fool.”
But suddenly Pink William began to
“I can't tell you how grateful we are
to you, Sir, for your assistance,” said
the Company Commander fervently.
“I do hope, Sir, you will come and see
us again, and * *
“I want—want to—” began William,
but, alas, he could not go on ; he seemed
to be sinking fast.
“Take his last words down, pore
feller,” groaned a little corporal, and
the truffle-hunters nozzled and wagged
their hideous heads sympathetically.
“I want—” -
“Yes, Sir 2"
“I want to—I must—"
“Yes, Sir, say it; and I'll get it
down.”
“I mus-er-ust—”
“Yes, Sir, what ?” .
“Sneeze — ATIshoo —oo!” shouted
William and blew the Company Com-
mander over.
And then he felt better. The irony
came when he got back and they asked
him wilat he had seen.
O FOR A BOOK!
“O for a book and a shady nook!”
You recollect the rhymes,
Written how many years ago
In placid happier times?
To-day no shady nocks are ours
With half the world at strife
And dark ambition laying waste

But still the cry for books is heard:

INSTRUMENTAL TRAGEDIES.
AN amorous youth of Athlone
Told his love in a way all his own;
But the medium employed
Made his suit null and void,
For it happened to be the trombone.
There was once an Italian named
Niccolo - -
Who played with great power on the
piccolo;
But his tones were so shrill
That the neighbours fell ill,
And he had to migrate to Co. Wickolow.
There was a persistent old barionet
Who practised for years on the
clarionet; -
But at his decease
He had learned but one piece—
“The Funeral March of a
Marionette.”
There was a young lady
named Lola
Who thought she could
play the viola;
But the sounds of her
Strad
Would have driven
BACH mad
And demoralised SAvoN-
AROLA. -
There was a young native
of Cuba
Who devoted himself to
the tuba;
His tone was quite
grand,
But when one of a
band
He produced an orchestral
Majuba. -
There was an old Trinity Fellow
Who drew horrid groans from his 'cello;
But his friends, though distressed,
One and all acquiesced,
For his port was exceedingly mellow.
There was a renowned Senior Wrangler,
Of problems a great disentangler;
But in music his skill
Absolutely was nil
Except as a sort of triangler.
A rash Caledonian gent
Played the flute on two Sundays in
Lent :
On the third coming round
To his sorrow he found
That the bore had been filled with
cement. -
“An English officer at my table was ex-
changing English slang for American. And
was very pleased with a few got the blinkers
off now,' and ‘That's got the blinkers off no,'
and ‘Hhat's the stuff to give them.’”
Eastern Morning News.
AT THE PLAY.
“MARMADUKE.”
Marmaduke was the unsatisfactory
son of a very dear mother; and on the
day that his millionaire and absentee
stepfather, Gregory, a bushy-eyebrowed
juggernaut of a man, is expected, and
great hopes are entertained of his provid-
ing the scapegrace with a job—behold
there is no Marmaduke. But his portrait
is in The Mirror—a lost-memory case
in a London hospital. Off posts little
cousin Patricia to retrieve him. Ar-
rival, just in time to appease the punc-
tual juggernaut, of a handsome urbane
young man with a perfectly blank
memory but a quite ready wit, who,
instead of abjectly feeding out of the
millionaire's hand, is rather inclined to

pull his leg. Consternation of all but
Gregory, the unpleasant but fundament-
ally good sort, who seems rather im-
pressed by this unusual treatment.
Meanwhile “Marmaduke” is well con-
tent to let go his past for such a present,
such a perfect dear of a mother (Miss
|MARY JERRold at her most gracious
and tender), such a charming cousin,
such a comfortable bungalow. Yet the
mother is puzzled by a quite different
look in her boy's eyes, and housekeeper
Dawson sniffs suspiciously. On the
other hand Aunt Susan and the credu-
lous and incompetent family doctor ac-
cept the newcomer uncritically, and
only little rogue Pat really knows that
it isn't their Marmaduke, but lets him
stay on to save the situation till her
cousin's reappearance. An excellent
gambit, Mr. ERNEST DENNY"
So “Marmaduke,” unenlightened as
to the real facts, snuggles down into a
very pleasant home, makes love to a
not unwilling Patricia and suspects
has made a furtive and unsteady en-
trance by the window, in his bed. A
cleverly - contrived complication, and
certainly a First and Second Act as
neatly finished off as any of recent
years. If the unravelling processes of
the Third Act were not quite so skilfully
handled—well, that's a perennial diffi-
culty, and there was nothing in the
least ignominious in the author's partial
failure. I think that some judicious
cuts and some swifter playing might
ease the situation a little.
Did Miss MARY JERRold as Lady
Althea Gregory do, say or look anything
but just the right thing? If so I did
not notice it. A charming, delicate
performance, enough to make any play.
Mr. DENNIs EADIE's “Marmaduke” was
very attractive, and his little study of
- the unsatisfactory original
cleverly contrasted. The
ruthless millionaire was so
obviously cut to Mr. SYD-
NEY WALENTINE's pattern
that it would have been
an impertinence for any
other actor to have played
it. Miss MARY O’FARRELL
gave us a pretty study of a
very charming Irish maid,
and Miss HELEN Rous as
Lady Susan boomed ex-
planations and protests
in the background. Mr.
RANDLE AYRTON put in a
clever sketch of a family
solicitor, and Miss MURIEL
. Pope most effectively dis-
guised herself as that
unpleasant basilisk, the
secretary to the million-
aire. An admirably cast
play, received with enthusiasm. T.
MARBLE HEART-BURNINGS.
HAVING heard that the preferen-
tial protective treatment accorded by
Sir ALFRED Mond to the statue of
CHARLEs I. at Charing Cross had caused
jealousy and recrimination among cer-
tain other of London's stone and bronze
adornments, a Punch man set forth to
test the rumour. He found it painfully
true: a distinct suggestion of griev-
ance pervaded the sculptured world.
All, or nearly all, the statues considered
that either too much honour is being
paid to the figure of a king who was
found not fit to rule, or too little is
being paid to them.

That thou'rt my stockbroker, his mien discloses
No deference that is not due to thee.
The day has vanished when the hungry masses
Brought thee flat-irons and father's Sunday suit;
When all the wild oats sown by wilder asses
Crowded thy coffers with attractive loot;
And lo! the shadow of thine argis passes
To the protection of the middle classes
And keeps our countenance in good repute.
I do not know what art of divination
Made thee aware that I had spent my all,
And bade thee pen that brief communication,
Saying, “Our Mr. Montagu will call”;
I only know with what profound elation
I sped thee to the local railway station
With our épergne (a wedding gift) in thrall.
Where now the furtive mien, the stealthy speering,
The haunting of thy watch-festoonéd pane,
The popping in, the sudden reappearing
Minus the sleeve-links or the Albert chain;
The wondering—was it just a trick of hearing
Or had we really caught the newsboys' yelling,
“Old bottlenose has soaked the clock again”?
All that is gone. Instead, our James with proper

And old McDsquebaugh, a man of slow wit,
Who had nice Sheffield plate and liked to show it,
Has “left it at the Bank"—a likely tale!
For it is thou, O Montagu (or Moses),
Whose kindly hand alleviates our ills;
Within whose strong-room temptingly reposes
The wherewithal to pay our weekly bills;
And if my piano goes—why, where it goes is
Not the affair of folk with prying noses
And excess profits bulging in their tills.
Perhaps they would not lie to save their faces;
To us it seems the natural thing to do—
To carry on and not show any traces
Of what it costs to see the business through;
So, while the Hun a troubled world disgraces,

And bless the name of Mr. Montagu. ALGOL.

Thursday, June 20th-For several
weeks it has been a popular pastime
in the House of Commons to ask when
the promised Home Rule Bill was to be
introduced, and Mr. BonAR LAw has
shown much good-humour and versa-
tility in constructing suitably varied but
invariably evasive replies. However,
the game is now over, for in the House
of Lords this afternoon Lord CURzoN
frankly admitted that the policy of
running Home Rule and Conscription
in double harness had been abandoned.
Better things are expected from the new
pair—Firm Government and Voluntary
Recruiting.
In the Commons Mr. MoRBELL once
more raised the dingy standard of
Peace-at-any-price, and Mr. SNowDEN
gave the most abject exhibition of “de-
featist” tactics that the British Parlia-
ment has yet witnessed. In his view
Germany is a badly-maligned country
which cherishes no idea of world-dom-
equally impossible and undesirable.
The only merit of his speech was to
stir Mr. BALFour to a righteous indig-
nation which warmed and vivified an
admirable restatement of our war-aims.
The Pacifists did not venture to go to
a division.
Later on Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs
vigorously defended the National Ser-
vice Department against the attacks
of Mr. McKENNA and Sir DoNALD
MACLEAN. If anything it was under-
staffed rather than over-staffed; and its
responsibility was confined to seeing that
men were up to the standard of fitness
accordant with their age; it was the
business of the War Office to take care
that they were properly used. Once
more we seem to be up against the lack
of co-ordination—blessed word l—be-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WE most of us know by now, and have cause to respect,
Mr. STEPHEN GRAHAM's childlike openness, his unabated
optimism and his generous pity for the under dog. These
qualities he offers us again in another volume of self-
revelation, The Quest of the Face (MACMILLAN). But I feel
that we have a right of protest against his loose method
and his quite appalling discursiveness. The study which
gives the book its title is extraordinarily obscure in inten-
tion; it describes, I should suppose, the writer's quest of
the Christ in his fellow-man. Christ has the face of every
man, and every man the face of Christ. It also is largely
concerned with canvassing the opinion of the passers-by

Mr. John L. GRIFFITHS was one of those brilliant and
high-principled men with regard to whom his fellow-country-
men make a mental reservation when, as sometimes happens,
they abuse politics and politicians. After a useful career in
his own country he was, in 1905, appointed Consul at
Liverpool, which one of his predecessors—no other, indeed,
than HAWTHoRNE—once described as “a very pleasant place
to get away from.” Four years later he was made American
Consul-General at London, and in 1914, before the out-
break of the War, he died deeply regretted by a body of
friends numerous in America and scarcely less numerous in
this country. The Greater Patriotism (John LANE) is a
collection of the public addresses delivered by this most
remarkable man in England and America. The cause to
which he chiefly devoted himself was that of reconciliation
and friendship between his own country and ours, and for
this purpose he spent over and over again the magnificent
gift of eloquence with which he had been so lavishly en-
dowed. Twice did I who write these lines hear him, and
on each occasion he left me amazed by the oratory he had

A RUNNING ACCOUNT WITH THE ENEMY.
“AND what is a “clean' Peace?” I asked. “Is it anything like a “clean slate'?” Of course I knew it
wasn't a bit like it, but when one is interviewing somebody one has to ask these easy questions.
“People talk rather loosely about a “clean' Peace,” replied Mr. Punch. “Those who object to a boycott of
German trade after the War, as implying a reservation of malice and animosity, seem to forget that in the Peace
of 1871, which they would call a “clean' Peace, the Germans demanded an indemnity which was meant to cripple
France for at least a generation. It is rare enough for a ‘clean' Peace to be made even with a foe that has
fought cleanly, as France had fought. But when you have been fighting a dishonourable enemy you cannot treat
a war like a football match where teams that have fought with the utmost fury cheer one another at the finish
and there's an end of it. That, of course, is in the spirit of British sport; but it assumes the same spirit in
your opponents. How are you to make a “clean' Peace with a dirty enemy?
“That great sportsman, Thomas Atkins, is a little too apt (all honour to him for it) to take his wars as if he
were playing a friendly match. But that is not the way to win them, especially when your enemy is German and
doesn't mind what rules he breaks. Some of us recognised this at a very early stage and tried to inspire in our
troops a right abhorrence for such a foe. For this we were rebuked by certain good people who reminded us that
we ought to love our enemies, and would have us make a distinction between the sinner, who deserved our affec-
tion, and his sin, which merited our strongest detestation. That is a distinction which is not very practicable on
the battle-field. We are not simply fighting against the abstract principles of treachery and murder; we are fight-
ing against actual traitors and murderers, and we have to see that they don't do it again. This must be the
one thought in our minds on the battlefield and in the Peace conference.
- “And killing is not the only way to reach this end, though it is a very good way, and though no security
is possible unless the enemy has first been well beaten in the field. There is another and surer way—lots of
quite average people have thought of it—by which you may bring things home to an autocracy that is not greatly
concerned about the sacrifice of its cannon-fodder; and that is through its pocket.
“Perhaps it is one of those ideas which are so obvious that only simple people, like myself, apprehend them, but
I have always marvelled why we don't take a leaf or two out of the books of the Sibyl; why we have not said to the
enemy: ‘Such and such are our irreducible terms, which include the expiation of your offences by full recompense
to your victims and by the bringing to justice of those in high places who are responsible for your filthy crimes.

Accept these terms and, though we cannot pretend to guarantee that any decent man will want to hold inter-

course with you for a few decades, we shall take no official action to prevent him if he has a morbid fancy that
way. But decline our terms and for every month that you keep us waiting you shall have a year's boycott in
the markets of the Allies.' That would touch the Teuton in his tenderest spot.”
“Perhaps,” I suggested, “the peoples of the Allied nations will take matters into their own hands and
make their own private arrangements for a graduated boycott. What about the Union of Sailors and Firemen 2"
“A very hopeful instance,” said Mr. Punch. “They have the right, if any men have, to choose their own
way of dealing justice. These gallant fellows of the Mercantile Marine, of ‘The Fleets behind the Fleet,' have
had a more bitter experience of German savagery than any other body of men in these Islands. I had a talk
with some of them the other day, and they struck me as a type that would not be likely to repudiate its debts.
As you know, they have faithfully promised the enemy that for a term of years, capable of indefinite extension
at the enemy's pleasure, they will not convey any German on their ships or any goods coming from Germany
or consigned thereto. Their scheme, which has been openly advertised, announces a definite tariff for German
crimes at sea—so much additional boycott for each fresh one.
“Our 'softies' may call it revenge if they like, but it is not that; it is not even reprisal in kind—an eye for
an eye; it is just a salutary way of teaching an inhuman enemy, by the only method that he is capable of
appreciating, that there are certain accounts which cannot be closed by the signing of any Peace; that it
is impossible to have dealings with him or anything that is his until he has purged at least some of his offence.
As for the duration of this lesson, that lies entirely within his own choice. He knows the tariff, and he can
have as much lesson as he wants.
“It doesn't worry me in the least to be told that such action on the part of HAVELock WILsoN and his Union,
as being in the nature of a conspiracy against trade, may not be smiled upon by the authorities. I should be
sorry for the Government that attempted to put down this sort of strike. Indeed, if we may judge by the quick
response of French sailors to the appeal of their British comrades to join hands with them in this matter, it
begins to look like being the first practical item in the programme of a League of Nations.
“I was greatly impressed by the quiet resolution of these men of our Merchant Service. Their purpose is
irrevocably fixed; and their language on the subject was characterised by the extreme of candour. But they
think more than they talk, as is the way with men who go down to the sea in ships; and these have faced
worse perils than ever the cruellest sea devised.
“I hope, if they will let me, to visit them again, for it is a rare thing in these days to talk with men who
know their minds. And next time I shall ask leave to present them with a small personal tribute of my unbounded
respect and admiration. It will take the form of—” -
“Stay, I can guess,” I interrupted. “I have long suspected that you have been utilizing this interview for
your own ends. You have, in fact, been rehearsing a Punch Epilogue; and now you have reached the hallowed
climax where you present to a receptive audience your latest half-yearly volume.”
“I congratulate you,” replied the Sage, “on your penetrating observation of my methods. You have
indeed rightly surmised that I propose to present these brave seamen with my
One jumbrel and fifty-fourth Uolume."
