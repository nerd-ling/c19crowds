“No intelligent man,” said Herr voN

tertained the wish that Germany should
attain world-domination.” There was
a time when this frank reflection on the
Hohenzollern intelligence would have
constituted lèse-majesté,
The same authority stated that “the
idea of world-domination in Europe is
Utopia.” Not U-boatia, as originally
promised. :: ::

côTE 204 (AISNE).
I HAVE held my slopes in peace,
Summer sunlight, drowsy Winter,
Spring's increase;
I have kissed the feet of children, run-
ning barefoot out of school,
With my grasses, petal-cool;
And the lark has nested on me, brood-
ing, dreaming on my heart,
Ere she soared to sing her part;
And I know that once again, when this
agony shall cease,
I shall hold my slopes in peace.
I have held my slopes in war,
Trench and shell-hole, gaping crater,
ruin sore ;
And I lay in waiting silence, like a wild
thing in a snare,
While the field-grey hordes were there,
Till my own returned about me, swift
as dawn when night-winds die,
Tender-hued like distant sky,
And their hearts shall beat to my heart
in contentment evermore
When I free my slopes from war.
I shall hold my slopes in trust,
Gift of heroes, grave of martyrs, noble
dust.
My full heart enfolds the selfless, those
who gave their lives for France;
Over them the light winds dance,
And the little flowers that seek the sun
their memory shall keep
Bright as smiles in happy sleep.
Never blade more fierce than crocus-
spears its flaming point shall thrust
Where I hold my slopes in trust.

If the numbers are correctly stated
why not give them the bonus and have

LEAVE.
THERE was no leave—there had been
no leave for many a long day. Yet, as
it had been on the day before that and
the one before that, and as it would be
on the morrow, and—but the vista is
too bleak—the topic of five sixths of
the conversation was leave. Leave and
the manner of it, how it came, how one
prepared and set off for it, what one
did on it, regulations concerning it,
men lucky with it, men unlucky with
it. And then, again, leave in the French
Army, the Belgian Army, the well,
all that, amounting to one sixth of the
five-sixths.
The other five-sixths of the five-
sixths was concerned with when leave
would start again. As to this there
were rumours, rumours and rumours,
half-facts, quarter-facts, lies, vague re-
ports of knowledge imparted and im-
bibed under pledges of strictest secrecy,
rumours from headquarters, from bases,
from England, and again more lies,
despairing lies, hopeful lies, brave lies.
There were all these, and more, much
more; but there was no leave.
Then one day came a fact. The
dweller in the office where the brain of
the unit throbbed rushed out with an
Order. As is the way with Army Orders,
this said nothing of itself, but drew
attention to another Order (G.R.O.
variety)—Subject, Leave. This would
arrive by despatch rider in the evening.
The proportion of leave talk jumped
from five-sixths to eleven-twelfths, and
had it not been for the condition of the
bully at dinner-time the other twelfth
would not have been wasted. Argu-
ments even grew heated as to the
despatch-rider's rate of speed, his ap-
pearance, antecedents, and any general
information which might bear on the
possibility of his actually bringing or
failing to bring G.R.O. 26387 ZRA.
At last, as the shades of evening fell,
he arrived, or would have done so had
he not been prematurely torn from his
machine by willing hands and his
G.R.O. wrenched from his prostrate
form.
“26387 ZRA,” read out a broken
voice from the centre of the group.

non-pouched mammal's voyage.

Er-Professional Pugilist (ancious to please Medical Officer who has patched him up). “IF ANY TIME You would LIKE A LITTLE go
WIV THE GLOVES, SIR, I'LL BE VERY 'APPY TO PUT YER FRoo IT."
PLAYING “BALL.”
WHEN I saw Clarence E. Prayler
for the first time he was vigorously
“rooting" at a baseball game, directing
cold-blooded and studied insult at the
pitcher of the opposing side.
“Who told um he could play ball?”
he inquired. “Make um quit an' git a
real pitcher!” -
“Ball,” called the umpire, as Dab
Pinkney, the pitcher, delivered a deadly
shot at the batter's shin.
“Rah! rah!” yelled Clarence. “Quit
ut! quit ut! Play marbles! You cyant
pitch wuth a cent.”
Dab shifted his chewing gum into
his cheek and whizzed in a lightning
throw dead over the diamond. It was
safe in the catcher's hands before the
batter realized it was not an insect
buzzing by.
“Ster-rike ' " called the umpire.
“Learn the game!” bellowed Clar-
ence, transferring his abuse to the
umpire. He had so many cutting and
intimate details to impart to that im-
passive official that for five whole
minutes he left Dab in peace.
It was with considerable surprise that
I saw Clarence and Dab the same even-
ing amiably splitting a bottle of cider
outside the Café à la Vache Noire. As
I moved to occupy a vacant chair near
them Dab rose.
“Guess I must be quittin', Clarrie,”
he said. “Me for staff parade ce soir.”
“See you later, bud,” replied Clarence
pleasantly.
As Dab moved away the other re-
garded his broad back and huge shoul-
ders with a look of real affection.
“Say, bud,” he said to me, “ef
GEORGE WASHINGTON was put through
a bleaching plant he wouldn't come out
a whiter man 'n that l”
“Well,” I answered, “I gathered the
impression from your remarks this
afternoon that you thought his per-
manent address ought to be Sing Sing.”
“A man doesn't have to let his
private opinions influence him at a ball
game,” said Clarence gravely. “He
has to sink all that. Fill yourself with
the foamin' cider. It don't bite none.
As I was sayin', Dab's a white man,
and some pitcher.”
“But I heard you say he couldn't
pitch worth a cent.”
“He was playin' agin us this after-
noon,” said Clarence pityingly. “It's
easy to see you don't play ball. He
was playin' fer the sergeants agin the
enlisted men, and Iwus out to break up
their moral effec'.”
“I see,”Isaid. “Sollab is a sergeant?”
“Wal, I should say. Why, he pitched
two seasons for Brooklyn Banditti in all
the big League games' "
“Oh ” I said.
Something in my tone seemed to
convey to Clarence that I didn't follow
the sequence.
“See here, bud,” he said patiently.
“I’ll explain. But first of all lemme
make the necessary vocal sounds for
Ma'mselle to bring some more of this
yellow diluted kali water. “Encore un
bottle,' it is ; an' one of your corp'rils
says a man kin go through the whole

if ever you're in Schlatery's saloon in
Broadway après la guerre I'll apologise
handsome fer drinkin' it in sech di-
spirituous licker. As I wus saying, a
man who plays ball well is nach'rally
bound to be a sergeant ef he ain't
suthen higher in the Field-Marshal line.
It takes brawn an' brain to be a ball-
player, an' it requires jest that very
same fer a sergeant. Guess when Dab

mand in the neck coming back.
“An' resource! Sure, I'll tell you.
You know the usual hay-yaggon rate
of locomotion in this country. Well,
me an' Dab struck a most extrawordi-
nairy curiosity once. It was a train
that moved like a trottin'-match, or
tenement-holders at quarter-day, an'
didn't have to take no intervals fer re-
cooperation. Jest as luck would have
it we had to jump fer it, an' we jumped
fer different compartments. By the
time I'd got over the shock of findin'
it wus a hurricane-train and that it
wus scheduled to go without re-windin'
for four hours, I remembered I was
mighty hungry, and I also remembered
that the commissariat department, re-
presented by Dab, wus in the next
coach. So I put my head out of the
winder, established trunk-wire com-
munication with um and pointed out
me emaciated condition. But that
didn't bring the rations. Ef we had
only been in different compartments I
mote have done the mountain antelope
business along the footboard, but there
wus a two-yard gap between the coaches
an' I'm no cinema star.
“Wal, bud, here 's where a ball-
player's resource comes in. Dab jest
makes up those rations into three little
passels and hollers to me, ‘Stand clear.'
Then he gathers himself for a pitch like
as if it wus the last innings an' the
game all square. He jest jedges the
distance to a finger's breadth, with that
twelve inches of swerve that gets all
the star-batters guessin'. It curls in
at the carriage-winder an' sits on the
seat as nice as pie.
“‘Strike one,' hollers I, an' Dab gets
the next passel ready. Three times he
does it, dead on the mark every time,
an' I never enjoyed a meal better.
That's dandy pitchin' fer you.”
“Neuf heures, M'sieurs,” interrupted
Ma'mselle. -
“Guess that sounds like an invitation
to quit,” said Clarence. “Wal, me fer
the camp. S'long, Cully.”
I said good-night and left him, but
in a few minutes heard his heavy foot-
fall behind me and stopped.
“Say, bud,” he said quietly, “I’ve
been thinkin'. Mebbe in two-three
weeks, mebbe two-three months, you
an' me will be going over the top at
the same time. It don't seem the
square game to put gas over a feller
who's battin' in the same team. It's
all pink frills about Dab pitchin' those
rations through the carriage-winder;
but, believe me, Cully”—he made an
impressive pause—“believe me, Dab's
some pitcher.”
SONNET.
(In the Ella-Cruscan manner.)
THE love that has not Heaven for its
oal
Is like a house without a staircase
built;
Though it be nobly planned and
carved and gilt,
With ample cellars stocked with wine
and coal; -
Though on the tables stand the flowing
bowl
And music rises with voluptuous lilt;
Though every couch can boast a satin
quilt,
Though art surround it with an aureole;
Yet when the night arrives and need for
rest
Bids the tired revellers to their rooms
repair
The way is barred; they wail and beat
the breast;
No access to the upper floor is there.
So love by no uplifting purpose blest
Grovels on earth and cannot find the
stair. -

SUGAR-CARDS FOR INFANTS.
I HAVE just had a rather one-sided
correspondence with our local Food
Committee. At the time when food-
cards were first brought out my house-
hold consisted of my wife, myself, one
son and one daughter, all good trencher-
men and women. One is a non-sugarer,
but two out of the other three consume
enough sugar for four ordinary people,
so that we are always rather short of
this commodity, especially during those
weeks when we have visitors.
A short time age there was an ad-
dition to the household—infant, male,
One. -
“He shall have his 'ickle sugar-card,
bless him, he shall !” This was one of
the first remarks I made on learning
of his arrival. It was not perhaps an
altogether altruistic observation, as I
am one of the two sugar-hogs men-
tioned above.
I wrote to the secretary of the local
Food Committee within a few hours of
my youngest's birth as follows:—
DEAR SIR or MADAM, As there has
been an increase in my family to-day
kindly send me another sugar-card.
Yours faithfully,
TIMOTHY S. CoSBOTTLE.
In three days I received this reply:—
DEAR SIR,-Yours of the 24th inst. to
hand. The matter shall receive atten-
tion in due course.
Yours faithfully,
E. MARSDEN, Secretary.
After a week of suspense and con-
tinued sugar shortage I wrote again:-
DEAR SIR or MADAM, I shall be glad
of your attention, as promised, to mine
of the 24th ult, as our family increase
is still without his modicum of sugar.
He is at this moment sending up a
most piteous wailing, which your
prompt attention to my request would
no doubt stifle.
Yours faithfully,
TIMothy S. Cosbottle.
P.S.—Aunt Emma, among others, is
coming on the 12th to the christening.
She never brings her own sugar, and
she insists on three lumps in every cup
of tea, war or no war. We cannot
afford to annoy a godmother.
After waiting another three days I
received a form to fill in. But we had
not yet decided on the infant's names,
and so, being unable to fill in all the
required details satisfactorily, I returned
the form with this covering note:—
DEAR SIR or MADAM, I am obliged
to address you in this manner because
I am uncertain whether the signature,
“E. Marsden," hides one of the sterner
or the weaker sex. Surely the former,
as no woman could so long withhold
such a simple gewgaw as a little piece
of pasteboard from a puling infant.
I have been compelled, you will note,
to put down alternative Christian names
for the youngster, because, as I more
than hinted in my last, he has not yet
been baptized, and a furious battle is
raging here as to what he shall be
called. My wife insists on Timothy |
(after me) Alexander (after him of
Macedon) and Wickham (after god-
mother Emma). I want to substitute
Richard (after Coeur de Lion) for Alex-
ander, so you see my difficulty.
Trusting that you will waive all
further ceremony and send the card
at once, I am, Yours hopefully,
TIMOTHY S. CosboTTLE.
P.S.—If you have no sugar-cards or
sugar in stock, for Heaven's sake send
us a few saccharine tablets to go on
with. Our chemist hasn't got any.
The reply to this was typical of the
official mind. Unfortunately I tore it
up at once and cannot remember its
exact wording, but it stated in the most
formal and cold-blooded departmental
language that no sugar-card could be
issued unless it was to bear the precise
name or names of the holder, for pur-
poses of identification and for the pre-
vention of fraud.
The eventful 12th dawned with mat-
ters in this unsatisfactory state. Im-
mediately following the conclusion of
hostilities between my youngest and
the Vicar at the font I sent the follow-
ing telegram — -
Kindly send sugar-card at once for
Timothy Wellington Wickham Cos-
bottle Laburnum Lodge Washingstead
aged 18 days 64 hours.
TIMOTHY S. CosboTTLE.
But the baptismal tea-orgy was
ruined. Aunt Emma, who stayed the
night, was as disagreeable (on one
lump per cup) as she could be, and the
wretched sugar-card arrived by post.
just as she was leaving the house.

TO PADDY, A WAR-PIG.
Paddy, small and pampered pigling,
As I watch you in and out
Of the palings ever wriggling
Your exploratory snout,
Much I marvel at the curious
Fortune that on you bestows
Such a brief but most luxurious
Prelude to a tragic close.
Admirably hygienic
Is the structure of your sty,
With a purity Hellenic
That enthralls the artist's eye.
Here your charming mistress daily
Brings you appetizing meals,
And you greet her coming gaily
With appreciative squeals.
Though you cannot boast the beauty
Of the panther or the deer;
Though your voice is not so fruity
As the voice of Chanticleer;
Though you sport no fur or feather—
Just a simple nasal ring—
And in every kind of weather
To the same attire you cling;
Though you lack the erudition
Sometimes gathered by your kind,
And reveal no premonition
Of the doom to you assigned;
Still, by all the standards measured
That impress the porcine vet,
You are worthy to be treasured
As a temporary pet.
Hence, in fine, I count you happy,
Though a prisoner and a pig,
For your share of food, though scrappy,
Rationally viewed is big.
And, unconsciously fulfilling
Duty's call, you do your bit
By your eating and your swilling
Till for curing you are fit.
From a report of Herr voN KUEHL-
MANN's speech:— -
“I do not believe that any responsible Ger-
man (not to speak of the Kaiser or the Imperial
Government) ever, thought they could win
world-domination in Europe by unchaining
war. The idea is Uptopian.”—Daily Mail.
Uptopia—the place where the top-dogs
come from. We are glad Herr von
KUEHLMANN at last realises that it is not
Germany.
The Times, in reporting that one of
the vessels engaged in the banana im-
port trade carries twelve hundred tons
of this fruit, informs us that “1,200 tons
means at an outside estimate 700,000
bananas.” So the average banana
weighs 3-84 lbs. This may be good
enough for an outside estimate, but it
is contrary to our inside experience.

GREAT GADGETS.
Big Bertha has been making such a
lot of noise in two senses that I am
afraid that you will be thinking that the
Bosch monopolises all the inventive
genius of the world, and therefore
hasten to tell you something about the
great brain waves which are coming
from people on our side, even at the
risk of giving away some carefully-
guarded secrets.
There was the Tank, of course. That
was a purely British invention, and, if
you remember, the wonderful thing
about it was that it was simultaneously
thought of by nearly ten per cent. of
our population. That just shows you
that we have quantity as well as quality.
Then there is the Harrison-Leycester
Crab Projectile. I don't know who
Harrison or Leycester are, but all really
good gadgets have double-barrelled in-
ventors. It is far more swish.
This is a projectile for naval use.
When fired at an enemy ship it finds
its target unfailingly by means of
magnetic attraction. On arrival it
crawls up the side and along the deck
to the engine-room hatch, severely
stinging anyone who may venture to
interfere with it. It then proceeds down
the hatch and perches itself on the
h.p. cylinder, where it sings the National
Anthem of the enemy in rag-time.
Should there still be any sign of re-
sistance it explodes with great violence.
Again we have the Bannerman-
Lambert Magic Searchlight—once more
the double-barrels, you observe. This
is probably the most frightful weapon
which has yet been contemplated.
By means of a special searchlight,
the construction of which is so secret
that it has never even been done, life-
like portraits of the more dread chief-
tains on our side are paraded before the
eyes of the enemy ships, a proceeding
which, it is confidently expected, will
ruin the nerves of their crews beyond
repair. It is considered that the sud-
den and inexplicable appearance of Mr.
PRINGLE, for instance, in the turret of

General PAGE CROFT fulminated freely

equal vehemence by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE

the PRESIDENT of THE BOARD of TRADE

that remarkable name was changed by
his father for the greater convenience
of his American neighbours; and it
hailed, not from Germany but from

On the vote for the National Service
Department, Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs re-
plied to some of his critics, and made
a manful effort to explain the mysteries
of “grading.” Briefly it is the business
of the medical authorities to decide the
degree of physical fitness that a man
possesses; and of the military authori-
ties to decide how he may most use-
fully be employed. Judging by the
subsequent speeches a good many of
his hearers seemed to think that either
the medical authorities or the military,
or both, would be none the worse them-
selves for a “grading” in commonsense
before being entrusted with these deli-
cate decisions.
From a speech by the Italian PREMIER:

MY DEAR BELLE,-You must make
up your own mind about coming to stay
here, but really I think you should
forget your fears. The moon is getting
quite tiny again, and we must all be
fatalists, mustn't we? There is a room
for you whenever you want it.
No news in particular. Frank is
still a Special, and I see him only occa-
sionally, but, although tired, he keeps

as a penny one on any letter, whereas

no chance of any sea for them this year,
and we must do the best we can with
the Botanical Gardens and the Round
Pond and now and then the Zoo.
Sooner or later I suppose Billy's ton-
sils must come out. What are tonsils
for, anyway?
The great joke is Auntie, who, after
experimenting with all kinds of war-
work, has now settled down as a sales-
woman at a Gift House. She has done
everything in her time. She has made
swabs and bandages, sitting in the
most cloistral headdress, or has read to
soldiers and written letters for soldiers;
she has tried to learn the typewriter,
and tried to learn shorthand, and tried
to learn to drive a car. But these three
last accomplishments beat her, and now
she is selling cast-off property in a great
Gift-house in Bayswater.
You know the idea. People send
the things they don't want to these
places and other people buy them, and
the proceeds go to war charity. The
most extraordinary thing is not that
anyone should now want them, but that
anyone should ever have wanted them;
but I suppose they were wedding pre-
sents or what are called “Seasonable
Gifts.” All kinds of things under glass
shades, for example. “Art” things.

One never realised so clearly the
meaning of the saying, “Tastes differ,”
as when one goes there—as I often do,
to see how Auntie is getting on. She
thinks I go to cheer her up, and is full
of gratitude; but really I go for my own
amusement, because she is so funny.
You know her passionate desire to be
truthful. Always giving the other side
the benefit of the doubt and all that.
Well, that is not the best kind of mind
for a good saleswoman, and if Auntie
were in real trade she would starve.
But for charity she makes an effort to
we get understamped ones from other
The children are fit, but there seems
compromise, because it is for charity,
although I have no doubt that she
suffers for it when she is alone with
her conscience afterwards.
This very afternoon I found her talk-
ing to a man who had taken a fancy to
an earthenware negro, through whose
anatomy an electric wire could be run
to a lamp. Nothing more boring can be
imagined in the way of parlour decora-
tion; but the man liked it. To Auntie
it was, of course, a horror, but her duty
was to extract money for the cause.

face of the obvious difficulty of giving similar

“That's what I call quaint,” the man
said—he looked like an inspector or rate
collector. “An amusing idea, don't
you think?”
Auntie swallowed and said it was
very amusing.
“The wife would be tickled to death
by it,” the man said.
“And the children 2" Auntie sug-
gested: rather cold-bloodedly I thought.
When they saw it, they would, the
man agreed; but he wasn't one for
allowing young children in the drawing-
room, where there were so many pretty
things about.
“Not that this is exactly pretty,” he
went on, “but it's quaint.”
Auntie affirmed that it was one of
the quaintest things that they had had
in the place.
“I wonder you don't buy it for your-
self,” the man said.
This was a surprise attack and
Auntie bent under it, but, quickly re-
covering, she said that her house was
already too full. Nor, she added, would
she like to deprive him of it.
“Well,” he said, “I’ll think it over.
I'll look in again.”
Poor Auntie! This phrase, it ap-
pears, is the most dreaded of all by
sellers of White Elephants. Their one
mastering desire is to prevent people
from thinking anything over.
“You had better take it now,” Auntie
said, adding with an ingenuity that I
shall never sufficiently admire, “three
or four other people have looked at it
and may be back at any moment.”
The man examined it again.
“You’re sure it's a good thing?” he
asked. “It's clever ?”
“I think it's wonderful,” Auntie re-
plied, “wonderful. I never should have
thought to see a negro so—so counter-
feited. For those who like such things
I think it's amazing.”
“I’ll have it,” said the man.
When he had gone with his treasure
under his arm, Auntie and I had tea
upstairs. She looked years older.
Do write the old dear a line saying
you hear great things of her new work.
And you had better come and stay with
me and risk the Hun.

But knew my doom impending if you

Instead, I left my heart where you

Upon my snowy quilt; but woe is me!
You sent it to the pack-store ruthlessly.
Wowing my tribute should not thus be

I set it on my locker. What you did
Was just to pop it in and close the lid.
Then, on myash-tray, bitterly perplexed:
Only to hear you murmur, gently vexed,
“Whatever will they leave in ash-trays

I tried my plate, well-nigh of hope bereft,
And, as you came to clear with fingers
deft,
You said, “Oh, wasteful! This must
not be left.”
So now, when you sweep near me, as
you must,
Your careful broom, true to its precious
trust,
Will find a heart abandoned in the dust.

THE RUMOURIST.
THERE were three of us in a first-
class carriage, the little man with the
bulging eyes, the young Staff-Captain
in the R.F.A., and myself. For some
little time we travelled in silence, but
for eyes that bulge to that extent a pro-
longed silence is impossible, and the
little man, who had been eying the
officer as if he wanted to eat him, at
last made the plunge and began to talk.
“Been at the Front, I suppose?” he
said.
“Yes,” said the Staff-Captain.
“Going out again soon?”
“Got another four days.”
“Been in many of these offensives?”
“One or two.” -
“I imagine you'd think that one was
enough. I know I should. I'm not
saying, you know, that I haven't got
the courage to stand it, because I'm
not more of a coward than anybody
else. I should be right enough if
they got me out there; but they won't
call me up, me being over age and hav-
ing a one-man business to look after.
Besides, I've given two younger bro-
thers and a second cousin to the War.
They're all out at the Front somewhere
and having a lively time of it. But
the Germans lose three times as many
as we do, so everybody says. A friend
of mine whose son's just gone out tells
me our Staff work is what's wrong
with us. Five Generals were sent home
after the last attack.”
“Oh, you heard that, did you?” said
the Captain.
“Yes, I heard that; but it was sort of
half private and confidential. That's
why it hasn't come out yet. But you
can't keep a thing like that dark. The
Germans know it already right enough.
He says—”
“Who says?”
“My friend who's got a son out
there. He says the Germans know
everything. We're not so good as they
are in spying, because we insist on
fighting in a gentlemanly way. Now
you know well enough that that kind
of fighting doesn't pay in these days,
now does it 2."
“I haven't seen any of it myself,”
said the Captain. -
“Ah, but it might be going on all the
time and you mightn't see it on account
of being in a different sector.”
“No,” said the Captain, “I don't
think that's likely.”
“Anyhow,” said the little man, “I
hear we've got the better of them in
gas."
“Really?” said the Captain.
“Yes, our gas kills anything within
a couple of hundred yards. It's abso-
lutely deadly, if we had only got enough

“ONLY THEORETICAL, SIR.

I UNDERSTAND, FoR INSTANCE, THAT ONE SHOULD MAKE
of it. We never do have enough of
things to start with.”
So the conversation rolled on, if in-
deed you can call it comversation where
all the talking is on one side and the
other merely puts in a word or two
expressive of polite doubt. When we
arrived at our terminus the officer dis-
appeared, and the bulgy-eyed gossip
button-holed a friend on the platform,
and he and I and his friend found our-
selves together on the top of a 'bus.
“I’ve just had a most interesting
conversation,” said the little man, “with
a General whose name I am not allowed
to mention. If I told you who it was
you'd be startled. He tells me that
five of our Generals have been actually
dismissed the Service for doing their
work badly during the last offensive.
He said our gas was absolutely deadly.
He talked quite freely about it. Also
he told me that we'd got a lot to learn
from the Germans. He says that one
of our chief faults is that we make war
in too gentlemanly a way. Now you
know I always said that, and it was
very interesting to have it confirmed on
such high authority.”
“Did he tell you anything about the
Americans?” said the friend.
“Oh, yes. He said the Americans
were arriving at the rate of two or three
hundred thousand a day."
“It's almost incredible, isn't it?"
“It would be if anybody else had
made the statement.”
It is quite unnecessary to add that
the young officer had not said a word
about the Americans; but a little thing
like that does not stop a rumourist
when he is out for an airing. -

“NURSE BENSON.”
I CAN imagine cases where high pro-
fessional skill in a nurse is a better quali-
fication than even youth and charm for
the curing of a wounded warrior. But
not so with Captain Marmaduke Tib-
benham, V.C., whose only trouble was
a damaged knee-cap; and it fell out
very happily for him that Nurse Benson,
who had the best of testimonials, but
also a plain face and at least forty
years behind her, was prevented at
the last moment from coming to make
him whole. For this gave Lady Gillian
Dunsmore the chance she wanted. The
W.C.'s portrait in the Press had in-
trigued her, and her curiosity had been
further piqued by the
account she had heard
of him from their mu-
tual friend, Brooke Stan.
way, who, from mixed
motives — partly per-
sonal, for he was in
love with her himself,
and partly loyal, for he
knew the levity of the
lady's nature and feared
that Tibbenham might
add a broken heart to
his other damage—had
discouraged her from
the pursuit of the hero's
acquaintance. So, hav-
ing had a smattering
of V.A.D. culture, and
being just then at a
loose end for congenial
war-work, she assumed
the identity of Nurse
Benson and got herself
installed in the Tibben-
ham ménage, having
first arranged an alibi for the deception
of Lord Messiger, her guardian uncle.

probable, some of them, but they
served their purpose of carrying us into
a Fourth Act. Lady Gillian's air of
possessive authority had not tended
to make her popular in the household,
which included two very unlikely guests
whose eavesdroppings and other machi-
nations had the true Surrey-side flavour.
And when finally a certain Sergeant
Hinks turns up with the idea of courting
the real Nurse Benson (of whose merits
he has heard from her brother at the
Front), and produces a photograph of
her, stained by trench-mud, but with
her solid virtues shining through, Lady
Gillian is denounced as an impostor
and sent about her business; though
nothing but the necessity for a Fourth

Act debarred her from revealing an
identity which would have been most
acceptable to the Tibbenham family.
Had they learnt that they had been
entertaining unawares a future peeress
in herown right she would have been em-
braced with inconceivable enthusiasm
by the parvenue mother, who so adored
the aristocracy that she had given the
name “Marmaduke” to her son, for the
pure joy of calling him “Duke” for
short. (By the way I note that Marma-
dukes and repellent photographs are in
the theatrical air just now : see the
Haymarket and Royalty plays.)

quite so scintillating as I had been led to
expect, offered a delightful change from

outstanding threads. It owed its suc-
cess to a really brilliant performance
by Mr. FRED KERR as Lord Messiger.
To him it was as easy as drawing his
breath, but no other actor could have
played the part with such distinction.
Miss MARIE LöHR had two excellent
chances in the contrasted personalities
of Lady Gillian, gay, irresponsible,
fancy-free, and “Nurse Benson,” busi-
nesslike and practical, keeping her
head while she lost her heart ; and she
took these chances with both hands.
Charming at all times, I found her best
in her lighter mood, when she makes
you almost forget (except for an occa-
sional trick of voice) that she is, or ever
has been, on a stage.
Mr. DAwson MILwARD, as Brooke

passion of the hero. In this part Mr.
PENNINGTON-GUSH had a more difficult
task. He tackled it with the admir-
ably calm courage that you would ex-
pect of a W.C.; but, though I mention
him in my despatch, I would not go
the length of recommending him for a
bar to his cross. The authors, Messrs.
R. C. CARTON and JUSTIN HUNTLY
McCARTHY, were not too kind to him
in the Fourth Act, where they kept
him standing far too long on his poor
leg, doing nothing at all to justify his
existence.
Miss Lotti E WENNE, as the Captain's
doting mother, very conscious of weak-
ness in the matter of aspirates, was
just herself, which is always good
enough for me. I must go again, if

in reference to the re-
ported engagement of
Lady Gillian and
Brooke Stanway: “It
distinctly said so in The
Sunday Trumpet.” As
it doesn't look so very
funny on paper, it must
have been the way she
said it. -
In spite of a few
obvious flaws — not-
ably the crudity of the
female villain's part and
the sketchiness of her
husband's — the play
has all the elements,
from fresh humour to
familiar romance, that
make for popularity;

hope that her manage-

and fixing with a singular precision and setting forth with
lucidity and persuasive enthusiasm its salient points. No
one who thinks at all, whether plain man or superior person,
should miss In the Fourth Year (CHATTo AND WINDUs), with
its brilliant summary of the case for a League of Nations.
One finds the usual allowance of hasty generalisations and
(I am afraid) the usual traces of omniscience. I should
suppose that few would agree that Lord LANsdown E's
letter “was a feeler from the pacifist Tories who loathe all
the cant about a world safe for democracy;” and it is rather
disquieting to come across such ill-supported statements.
But the author does put into eloquent form the idealism of
the genuine believers in democracy; does bring home to the
thoughtless Imperialist the changed balance of the world,
and to the Big Interests that we are not fighting for markets
but ideas. He does wholesomely indicate that this War
has, so far from exhausting the horrors, only begun to
indicate what they will be when there is leisure to make the
right deductions and work out their logical consequences,
and does wholesomely remind the “governing classes” and
the “old tradition” of diplomacy that their right and their
unique capacity to make a settlement will be challenged
not only by Labour but by a nettled and disillusioned bour-
geoisie with a passion hitherto unsuspected. An appen-
dix on the implications of democracy and a vehement
defence of P.R. as an instrument in its purification complete
a valuable if piebald book.
I had thought that the literary lodes of Cornwall were
by now too exhausted for further working; but Wastralls
(HEINEMANN) proves me wrong, for it contains all the old
Cornish material, lonely farms, mysterious castaways from
the sea, and, finely caught, the atmosphere of half-sinister
romance that belonged to the Delectable Duchy before it
became an art school. I perceive that already I have my
metaphors somewhat involved; to return for simplicity to
the story you will find it a tragic and an impressive tale of
an outcast man's passionate love for the land upon which
he had been flung, and of the process by which this great
love gradually bred in him an equal hatred for the woman
who seemed to be thwarting it. This is what Mr. C. A.
DAwson-Scott has told with great sincerity and power, iſ
occasionally in rather too many words. The situation that
results from the marriage of Byron, the waif from the sea,
and Sabina, heiress of the land he so desired, is inten-
sified to grimness when an accident reduces the wife to a
helpless cripple, whose half-quenched vitality still stands
between the husband and his ambitions. There is a genuine
and horrible force in the long fight between these two, shut
up together in the lonely manor-farm of Wastralls; the man
brooding and revengeful, the woman understanding and in a
half-cynical way forgiving his mood. In short the Cornish
mine seems once more to have been worked with success;
and one hopes (if I dare suggest this faint pleasantry)
that the effort may be rewarded as were those of the Phoeni-
cians, and I leave you to remember what they got by it.

familiar story of German brutality in Belgium, with, as he
explains, the object of showing “the deliberate strategic
purpose underlying the policy of cruelty”—a policy that
produced such horror as, to the uninstructed world of 1914,
seemed altogether beyond belief. The “Triangle” of the title
is that part of the map lying within the points Malines,
Charleroi, Liége, a country of vital importance to the com-
munications of the German armies rushing Westward for
a great turning movement against the French left. It
was this importance that brought tragedy to the innocent
victims of “Prussian necessity,” since time after time it
seems to have been the considered policy of the Hun High
Command to make this unhappy district an example of such
ferocity as should “terrify the Belgians, soldiers as well as
civilians, into a submissive despair.” I take the quoted
words from a letter written by Lord BRYCB to the author,
in which he thanks him for giving in brief space so clear
and forcible a statement of the facts—a testimony by one
knack of representing facts in a manner calculated to attract
the infant mind, and I’ve been attracting it ever since.”
If this surmise is correct, put me among the infants. I do
not refer literally to the 1930 class, but to that degree of
childhood which a man may achieve, if he is lucky, in the
later teens. Readers who have a taste for the gayer reali-
ties of life touched upon in a vein of dashing improbability
will enjoy “A War Pixie,” “A Fellow-Feeling,” “The Wood-
Nymph,” stories which have all the attributes of the fairy-
tale, save that they omit the tiresome fairies. Other readers,
not yet old enough to love the nonsensical for its own sake,
will appreciate the more sedate cheerfulness of “The Meet-
ing of the Years;" and all will, I fancy, sympathise with
me in the particular, if they differ from me in the general,
when I say that I am rather afraid of women in the mass,
but should very much like to meet Mrs. WAIzEY. If I do
I shall beg her never again to risk such a good collection by
giving her first pages to so misplaced and abortive an
whose experience has made him an unwilling expert in the
investigation of atrocity. If any hearts are apt to forget
—and the fever of War has shortened the memories of
most of us—the tonic grim- TT
ness of this little volume
packed full of horror should
serve to renew the righte-
ous anger and indignation
of those early days.
In choosing such a title
as The Eclipse of Russia
(DENT) Dr. E. J. DILLON
made one expect a detailed
account of the revolution
or the military operations
preceding it, but really it is
nothing of the sort. His
book prefaces rather than
records the occurrences of
the last two years, and
might, in the best sense
of the phrase, be termed a
prophecy after the event.

twice as long) he is con-
tent to bring home to us

simplicity the sort of life

certain that Tsardom could not for ever persist in the
face of modern civilisation, and is illustrated mainly by
reference to those chapters of Russian history which cul-
minated in the Japanese war. If no more than a tithe
of the miseries which he associates with the old régime
were true—miseries that put all our old stereotyped anar-
chist stories to the blush—then disruption was inevitable.
Dr. DILLON's hero is the late Count WITTE, for whose
statesmanship he has a tribute of praise contrasting
pleasantly with his opinion of things Russian as a whole;
but, if his judgment is generally a gloomy one, yet the
sympathy of his analysis is as keen as its subtlety, and
after our wild and now almost incredible trust in the mili-
tary magnificence of the Tsars the plain truth is bracing.
It is well, when Russian affairs seem a mere jumble of
unintelligible policies, to have an observer who can state
clearly, if not just what to-morrow will bring forth, at any
rate the reasons for the developments of yesterday.
Mrs. G. DE HoRNE WAIzEY has the knack of telling a good
story with a pleasant surprise at the end of it, and does so
fifteen times out of twenty in The Right Arm, and Other
Stories (MILLS AND Boon). She is, I imagine, half thinking
of herself when she writes in “The Country Cottage”:
“After I left Newnham I discovered that I possessed a
time in the Mess. I doubt if the spirit of our airmen,
which to stay-on-the-ground people must always seem
astounding, will ever be more happily presented than it is
here. The arrangement of the sketches requires a little
alteration—I refer especially to “Salvage,” which would be
better placed at the end of the book.
Unlike most of the war-fiction that has come my way
Billie Impett and Doris (Hodden AND Stoughton) can be
unreservedly recommended. Billie as depicted here was a
delightful boy who had the confidence of his superior officers
and the love of his men. From the word “Go" he was a
trier, and his irresistible charm lay in his modesty. If he
is not drawn from life he lives in these pages, and, although
as a lover there were moments when his diffidence must
have been as exasperating to Doris as it was to me, you
have only to see him at his real job—which was war—to
forgive him for being but an amateur canoodler. This is
the second book that Captain EUSTAGE AINsworth has
written about Billie, and I hope that he will stick to his
Impett like a limpet.

THE TRIAL.
Those carefully timing their passage past the Orderly
Room at the moment of Alfred's ejection therefrom feared
that he had fared badly, that the Old Man at last had had
more than enough of a case-hardened offender regarded
hitherto with a somewhat lenient eye. For it was observed
that he looked shaken, and, had anything on earth been
able to abate the brick-red of his complexion, the opinion
was that it would have been a pale moment for him.
Awe ran through the spectators. For in Alfred a man to
whom court-martials were an almost weekly sustenance
as necessary as his rations, had been brought low. What
dread verdict, what harsh rigour of military law. . . . Thus
the anxious murmurs. . . -
Alfred, with drawn set face, refused consolation, refused
indeed to make any sort of a statement. But those privi-
leged to know the great criminal, to whom Army Acts and
K.R.R.'s in all their sections and their sub-sections were
as an open book, knew that it was not theirs to force Alfred
from his brooding, or there might easily be another crime.
That night, round about the fourth seat, third bench, wet
canteen, they would foregather with more hope of success.
At his accustomed hour Alfred was there, newly emerged
from seclusion, his face chiefly expressive of a cynical
thoughtfulness. He accepted many drinks with the man-
ner of one to whom tribute is inevitable, but must not be
accepted too lightly. -
Then, broodingly, “Four days' C.B.' "Tain't a bloomin' |

The electricity spread—“Alf's only got four days"—and
the crowd hung breathless.

Alf stopped speechless within an ace of a complete break-
down. He emptied two pots fiercely.
“I did it an' told 'im I did it. I give 'im every charnst.
Never made no defence 'cept ‘Old, Soldier,' an' there he
might easily 'ave said, ‘That makes it worse, my man.'

The sympathy of twenty pairs of eyes roused him afresh,
though still in morbid strain: “Ain't actually against Regs.,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HEAVY WORK.
EvERY now and then doctors slap
me about and ask me if I was always
as thin as this.
“As thin as what?” I say with as
much dignity as is possible to a man
who has had his shirt taken away from
him.
“As thin as this,” says the doctor,
hooking his stethoscope on to one of
my ribs, and then going round to the
other side to see how I am getting on
there.
I am slightly better on the other
side, but he runs his pencil up and
down me and produces that pleasing
noise which small boys get by dragging
a stick along railings.
I explain that I was always deli-
cately slender, but that latterly my ribs
have been overdoing it.
“You must put on more flesh,” he
says sternly, running his pencil up and
down them again. (He must have been
a great nuisance as a small boy.
“I will,” I say fervently, “I will.”
Satisfied by my promise he gives me
back my shirt.
But it is not only the doctor who
complains; Celia is even more upset
by it. She says tearfully that I remind
her of a herring. Unfortunately she
does not like herrings. It is my hope
some day to remind her of a turbot
and make her happy. She too has my
promise that I will put on flesh.
We had a fortnight's leave a little
while ago, which seemed to give me a
good opportunity of putting some on.
So we retired to a house in the country
where there is a weighing machine in
the bathroom. We felt that the mere
sight of this weighing-machine twice
daily would stimulate the gaps between
my ribs. They would realise that
they had been brought down there on
business.
The first morning I weighed myself
just before stepping into the water.
When I got down to breakfast I told
Celia the result.
“You are a herring,” she said sadly.
“But think what an opportunity it
gives me. If I started the right weight,
the rest of the fortnight would be
practically wasted. By the way the
doctor talks about putting on flesh, but
he didn't say how much he wanted.
What do you think would be a nice
amount 2 ''
“About another stone,” said Celia.
“You were just a nice size before the
War.”
“All right. Perhaps I had better
tell the weighing-machine. This is a
co-operative job; I can't do it all my-
self.” -
The next morning I was the same as
before, and the next, and the next, and
the next.
“Really,” said Celia pathetically, “we
might just as well have gone to a house
where there wasn't a weighing-machine
at all. I don't believe it's trying. Are
you sure you stand on it long enough?"
“Long enough for me. It's a bit
cold, you know.”
“Well, make quite sure to-morrow.
I must have you not quite so herringy."
I made quite sure the next morning.
I had eight stone and a half on the
weight part, and the little thing you
move up and down was on the “4”
notch, and the bar balanced midway
between the top and the bottom. To
have had a crowd in to see would have
been quite unnecessary; the whole ma-
chine was shouting eight-stone-eleven
as loudly as it could. -
“I expect it's got used to you,” said
Celia when I told her the sad state of
affairs. “It likes eight-stone-eleven
people.” -
“We will give it,” I said, “one more
chance.”
Next morning the weights were as I
had left them, and I stepped on without
much hope, expecting that the bar
would come slowly up to its midway
position of rest. To my immense
delight, however, it never hesitated but
went straight up to the top. At last I
had put on flesh -
Very delicately I moved the-thing-
you-move-up-and-down on to its next
notch. Still the bar stayed at the top.
I had put on at least another ounce of
flesh
I continued to put on more ounces.
Still the bar remained up! I was eight
stone thirteen. . . . Good heavens, I
was eight stone fourteen'
I pushed the thing-you-move-up-and-
down back to the zero position, and
exchanged the half-stone weight for a
stone one. Excited but a trifle cold,
for it was a fresh morning and the
upper part of the window was wide
open, I went up from nine stone ounce
by ounce. . . . .
At nine-stone-twelve I jumped off for
a moment and shut the window. . . .
At cleven-stone-eight I had to get
off again in order to attend to the
bath, which was in danger of overflow-
1D C . . . .
At fifteen-stone-eleven the breakfast
gong went. . . .
At nineteen-stone-nine I realised that
I had overdone it. However I decided
to know the worst. The worst that
the machine could tell me was twenty-
stone-seven. At twenty-stone-seven I
left it.
Celia, who had nearly finished break-
fast, looked up eagerly as I came in.
“Well ?” she said.
“I am sorry I am late,” I apolo-
gised, “but I have been putting on
flesh.”
“Have you really gone up 2"
asked excitedly.
“Yes.” I began mechanically to
help myself to porridge, and then
stopped. “No, perhaps not,” I said
thoughtfully.
“Have you gone up much 2"
“Much,” I said. “Quite much.”
“How much 2 Quick!”
“Celia,” I said sadly, “I am twenty-
stone-seven. I may be more; the
weighing-machine gave out then.”
“Oh, but, darling, that's much too
much.”
“Still, it's what we came here for,”
I pointed out. “No, no bacon, thanks;
a small piece of dry toast."
“I suppose the machine couldn't
have made a mistake 2"
“It seemed very decided about it. It
didn't hesitate at all.” -
“Just try again after breakfast to
make sure.”
“Perhaps I’d better try now,” I said,
getting up, “because if 1 turned out to
be only twenty-stone-six I might ven-
ture on a little porridge after all. I
shan't be long.”
I went upstairs. I didn't dare face
that weighing-machine in my clothes
after the way in which I had already
strained it without them. I took them
off hurriedly and stepped on. To my
joy the bar stayed in its downward
position. I took off an ounce . . .
then another ounce. The bar remained
down. . . .
At eighteen-stone-two I jumped off
for a moment in order to shut the win-
dow, which some careless housemaid
had opened again. . . .
At twelve-stone-seven I shouted
through the door to Celia that I
shouldn't be long, and that I should
want the porridge after all. . . .
At four-stone-six I said that I had
better have an egg or two as well.
At three ounces I stepped off, feeling
rather shaken.
she
I have not used the weighing-machine
since; partly because I do not believe
it is altogether trustworthy, partly be-
cause I spent the rest of my leave in
bed with a severe cold. We are now
in London again, where I am putting
on flesh. At least the doctor who
slapped me about yesterday said that
I must, and I promised him that I
would. A. A. M.

A PRISONER OF HOPE.
My body lies, as dead men lie,
On the cramped prison bed,
But with a clear unsleeping eye
I watch the pale moon shed
Its little silver shaft of light
Across the anguish of the night.
They will not fling the window wide
To show a heaven of stars,
| But still the pulsing world outside
Reaches my prison bars,
And as I cross the ghostly streak
I feel the salt spray on my cheek.
Swift as an arrow to the gold
I make my silent way
To where the guarding cliffs unfold
Their line of silver-grey;
I need no glimmer of a spark
To guide my footsteps through the dark.
I know of old the purple hill
Under the wind-swept skies,
Where, like a dream, serene and still
The gleaming water lies;
The rugged broken fretted line
That shows the sentinels of pine.
I see the track of long ago,
The brown enchanted burn;
I hear it singing soft and low
Long after I return,
And hold again, in stern control,
The winged impatience of my soul.
I know that I shall feel once more
The wind across the sea
When Peace unlocks the prison door
And sets the captives free,
And my imprisoned feet shall press
Out of this hell of loneliness.
I shall not need the faintest gleam
To guide my feet that day
Across the leaping red-brown stream
By the familiar way,
To where the still loch sleeping lies
Beneath the misty wind-swept skies.
MISTAKES ABOUT THE ARMY.
NoTHING pains me more than the way
in which our army is misunderstood and
maligned by its critics.
Ever since I became a soldier I have
been sorry for it. For the army, I
mean. It is a good army and it is doing
its best. I can see that. I couldn't at
one time, but I can now. The army and
I understand one another; consequently
I can see what is wrong. It is not the
army; it is the other people. They
are all wrong. There are more mis-
takes made about the army than any-
thing else. When I read what the
comic papers say about it I want to
cry; when I read what the serious
papers say about it I want to laugh;
and when I am neither crying nor
laughing I feel that I ought to put in a
Staff Officer (inspecting scratch collection o

HAT CAMPAIGN IS THAT’"
some of the illusions about it which are
cherished by the other people.
Take for example that most popular
illusion of all, the so-called waste of
talent. Nearly every critic of the army
declares that it does not make the best
use of its men. But it does.
Any fool can see that every man can-
not go on doing in the army exactly
the same work that he did in civil life,
and I am not going to pretend that when
it gets hold of an architect the army
lets him go on architecting, or that every
coster in khaki is allowed to go on cost-
ing, or even that every man who ought
to have a room to himself at Whitehall
gets it. I have not got one myself yet.
But put yourself in the army's boots
for a moment—you will not want to
keep them on longer than that. What
would you do if you were an army and
had to deal with all sorts and conditions
of men? Suppose a lot of recruits came
along and said, “We are writers of
fiction.” That would rattle you a bit.
It is a hundred to one that you would
not know what to do with them, and it
is a thousand to one that you think the
army wastes them. But if you knew
the army as well as I do you would not
think that. If you had studied the
beautiful diet sheets the army puts up
in its mess-rooms you would not ask,
“Where are our writers of fiction ?”
You would know.
Then again, take the question of com-
fort. Over and over again you say,
“Why does the army make its men so
uncomfortable?” I have heard that
question asked till it makes me tired.
The army gives me uncomfortable
clothes and a hard bed, drills me, shouts
at me, swears at me, and plays pranks
with my pay-book with a very definite
and laudable object. It wants to make
me wild. When I am wild I want to
fight someone, and that is just what the
army requires. When I am really mad
it turns me loose on the Germans. And
there you are.
At least, if you were there, you would
be sorry for yourself, but you would not
be likely to ask any more silly questions.
You can take it from me that the
army is all right. It knows perfectly
well what it is up to, but of course it is
impossible for an army to please every-
one, especially when there is a war on.

Second-Lieut. Augustus Gore
Was a don before the War,
Who in one of Oxford's attics
Crammed the young with mathe-
matics.
Gussie was a dreamy lad,
Otherwise he wasn't bad;
If he had a fault at all
He was unmethodical;
But a sum to him was play,
So he joined the R.G.A.,
And attended several battles
Minus all the goods and chattels
Which are commonly in use
When a war has broken loose.
“Some," quoth lie, “want guns be-
side 'em
In a fight; I can't abide 'em.
What's the use of guns to me?
I rely on formulae.”
In his turn he had to go
To the Front as F.O.O.;
Would he feel a trifle small
If the Germans paid a call?
You might think, when shells are
flying
And the Bosch his bomb is plying,
For offence in war's grim game
Telephones are rather tame;
More to watch than hit the foe;
Sextants, too, in self-defence
Don't inspire much confidence.
Yet he asked for nothing more,
Weapons being such a bore.
Glasses were designed, you know,
Ere his work had well begun
Suddenly appeared—the Hun
Gore was standing all alone
By his little telephone,
Thinking of the luscious stout
Drunk before he'd started out;
At his side most temptingly
Hung a flask of eau-de-vie,
And a Bosch who strove to gain it
Pricked Augustus with his bay'net.
This, of course, was quite unfair
And Augustus lost his hair;
Shrieking out, “Take that, you
lound !” -
Swift he felled him to the ground
(Giving Fritz good cause to hate us)
With his ranging apparatus.
Then our hero, breathing battle, -
Rounding up the Huns like cattle;
Rushed into the worst of babels,
Waving logarithmic tables;
Blasting men with sec. and sine,
Broke clean through the German line;
Found a pill-box, which he cracked or
Rather prised with his protractor;
Steered, with murder in his eye,
Through the winding length of “T”
Right up to the thousandth decimal;
Calculi infinitesimal
Rolled in torrents from his tongue
With a force that none could bung
(STOP PREss-Franco-British line
Everywhere has reached the Rhine).
That is how Augustus Gore
Practically won the War.
Straight to Oxford he retreated,
Where you'll find him calmly seated
In the dingiest of attics
Rubbing up his mathematics.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 1st.—M. KERENSKY’s
sensational appearance at the Labour
Conference last week was a mystery to
most of us, until Mr. RICHARD LAMBERT
explained it. The ex-Dictator, it seems,
was lured over here by the Govern-
ment in order that, being of mili-
tary age, he might be forced
into the British Army under the
Anglo-Russian Convention. Lord
RoberT CECIL had no informa-
tion regarding M. KERENSKY’s
age, and dismissed the sugges-
tion as purely fanciful; but the
fact that our Russian visitor
promptly left London for Paris
has confirmed Mr. LAMBERT's
suspicions.
A somewhat similar point was
raised by Mr. WATT in regard
to certain Italians in Scotland
who, though exempted by the
Tribunals, have been called up by
the War Office. It is reported
that Mr. WATT's interest in the
matter was prompted by a belief
that Macaroni was a Highland
chieftain.
In these times the programme of
business is a Government monopoly
tempered by motions for the adjourn-
ment. No fewer than three attempts
to switch the Parliamentary train on
to a siding were made this afternoon.
To General PAGE CROFT the burning
question of the day is the recent raid
on the offices of the National Party;
but the SPEAKER thought that its ur-
gency had evaporated, and the General
had to content himself with a personal
explanation, more personal than ex-
planatory.
Even less fortunate was Mr. BILLING.
His desire to call attention to the con-
tinued toleration of aliens in our midst
was baulked by the appearance on the
Order Paper of a resolution on the same
subject. Apparently he thought that
this ancient Parliamentary device for
the “blanketing” of bores had been
specially invented for his annoyance, for
he protested so loudly and insubordin-
ately as to get himself “named " and
suspended. His exit from the House
—forcibly assisted by four stalwart
officials—was, in the opinion of the
House, the most salutary movement
with which he has yet been connected.
Mr. Roch finally succeeded in moving
the adjournment in order to call atten-
tion to the danger that threatened the
harvest through the calling-up of skilled
agriculturalists. He drew a fancy
picture of Mr. PROTHERo cowed into
submission by the forceful personality
of Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs. But the

gretfully admitting that there was a
risk to the crops, pointed out that there
were other fields than those of Britain,
and Mr. BonAR LAw silenced the critics
with the plain statement that it must be
for the Government to decide where our
diminished man-power could most use-
fully be employed.
THE ARMY v. AGRICULTURE.
MR. PROTHERO.
... Before and after this interlude Mr.
FISHER succeeded in adding seven
| clauses to the Education Bill. There
was a lively debate on Mr. WHITE-
House's proposal that the physical
training of children should be of a non-
military character. The Member for
| Haggerston was horrified at the notion
that children should be taught to regard
themselves as soldiers, from which I
infer that this most susceptible Chan-
cellor turns his eyes away when he

wr:LL 2 MR. SPEAKER is, we understand, more

meets a party of Boy Scouts or of the
Church Lads' Brigade.
Tuesday, July 2nd.—The Peers were
much cheered by Lord EMMoTT's com-
parison between British and German
finance. If the War came to an end
to-morrow we should be able to pay our
way on our existing taxes. The Ger-
mans would have to face a deficit
of between three and four hundred
millions, and would be driven to
the conclusion that war—Prus-
sia's leading industry — was not
a paying proposition. As proof
of Germany's parlous condition
Lord EMMoTT affirmed that the
quantity of beer consumed there
- was only one-tenth of the pre-
war figure. Temperance enthu-
siasts will probably attribute Ger-
many's continued endurance to
their enforced abstention; if so, it
might be good business to flood
the enemy's trenches with this
enervating beverage.
The Commons continue to make
merry over the sandbagging of
King CHARLEs's statue. Mr.
PRINGLE considered that OLIVER
|CROMwFLL was entitled to similar pro-
tection, but Mr. Holt assumed that the
Government's sympathy was confined
to personages who lost their heads.
Wednesday, July 3rd.—Mr. BonAR
LAw revealed the astonishing fact
that only 288 Members of the House
of Commons have received titles, de-
corations or offices of profit since it
was elected in December 1910. The
unnoticed residue are wondering whe-
ther it is their own modesty or the
myopia of Ministers that has caused
them to be passed over. But there is
yet time for the omissions to be made
good, for Mr. LAw has introduced a
Bill to extend still further the life of
this Parliament.
Loud cheers greeted the HoME SEC-
RETARY on his safe return from the
Hague. Sir HENRY DALziEL, a mem-
ber of the Committee which, during
the Home SECRETARY's absence, has
been appointed to sit upon our aliens,
was anxious to know whether the re-
commendations of the existing Advisory
Committee (including two members of
the High Court) had always been car-
ried out. Not invariably, was the reply;
the responsibility for action rested
solely with the SECRETARY of STATE.
Sir HENRY is now wondering whether,
when it comes to the point, the views
of himself and Mr. JoyNson-Hicks (not
to mention Mr. KENNEDY Jon Es and
Sir Rich ARD CoopFR) will carry more
or less weight than those of His
MAJESTY's judges.

Committee. Members have shown a
wise restraint in their efforts to im-
prove it, and Mr. FISHER has been quick
to respond to any general desire for
an alteration. For example Mr. Row N-
TREE this afternoon brought up a
new clause obliging local authorities to
provide medical treatment for the chil-
dren whom their inspectors reported as
being in need of it. Mr. FISHER was
not inclined at first to take another
long step on the road to State parent-
hood. But the majority of the House
was evidently of opinion that, if the
constitutions of our future citizens were
looked after, the Constitution of the
State would take care of itself; and
the Minister was not sorry, I think, to
be persuaded by their arguments.
Thursday, July 4th.-Mr. D. MASON
developed a keen curiosity as to the dif-

was supported by nobody. That is
how, while the Fourth of July was

pendence Day of his own.
HIS BIT.
Peter the groom was lank and thin,
But Peter was hard and fit,
And Peter sat on the stable bin
And polished a racing bit;
He rubbed and polished it, ring and bar,
Till it shone with a silver sheen,
Then hung it up like a glancing star,
A whip and a girth between;
And, cutting a fill of his favourite brand,
His pipe he fondly fed
And lighted a match behind his hand
And sucked for a while and said:
“A chap that's knowin'
May do his bit
Safer than goin'
Where bullets hit;
I'm twenty-five an' I'm sound
an' fit,
But the trainer's a toff
An' he sees to it
That he gets me off,
For I'm doin' my bit—
Which is Click o' the Latch's big ringbit.
“For horses, you see, was bred to race,
An' fellers must feed and ride—
Handicap, sprint and steeplechase,
An' walk on the Bury side.
There's some has joy in a bursting shell
An' the roar o' the answerin' gun,
But give me the sound o' the saddlin'-
bell
An' the roar when the race is run.
They tell me the Huns is ten to three
An' talk o' the nation's need,
But I tell 'em the Squire's the man
for me,
With his “Must keep up the breed.'
An' a chap that's knowin'
Can do his bit
Better than goin'
Where shells can hit;
I’m twenty-five an' I'm sound
an' fit,
But the trainer's a toff
An' he sees to it
That he gets me off,
So I'm doin' my bit—

“It would be most satisfying to the worried
and abused taxpayers if Mr. Lloyd George

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(Herr von KUEHLMANN, Dr. WEKERLE, Hungarian Premier,
and Dr. von SEIDLER, Austrian Premier.)
Von Kuehlmann. At any rate, my dear WERERLE, it cannot
be said that you have not spoken with frankness. If every-
body were allowed to speak like that I doubt if this accursed
War would last five minutes longer. But you have an
easier task than others, for your young chief is on your side.
Dr. Wekerle. He does not dare now to admit that. He
was whipped in to heel by your chief, who threatened him
in language that was almost blasphemous, so that now he
doesn't dare to call his soul his own.
Von K. You have struck the fetters off his soul by your
speech. It is no small thing that you should have admitted
| an Austro-Hungarian defeat in Italy. The loss of a hundred
thousand men, besides thousands of prisoners, is no trifle.
Dr. W. The weather
Von K. Oh, the weather—we know all about that. Every-
body gets the weather he deserves. We have employed it
a good deal ourselves.
Von Seidler. Well, here we sit, three more or less intelli-
gent men, and we cannot advance our objects even by an
inch. We are in the grip of circumstances and we cannot
shake ourselves free.
Von K. Say rather that we are in the grip of the German
KAISER. My speech the other day to the Reichstag was a
small performance, but it was the first of its kind and it
pointed out facts. Well, you cannot conceive how difficult
it was to persuade him to let me make it. He was in one
of his most vainglorious moods, bristling with texts and
stuffed full of vanity. What is one to do with such a man?
Von S. Is there nothing more to be done in the direction
of peace? I cannot say myself that I am looking forward
to the meeting of our Reichsrat. We have a fearful crisis
both in regard to military affairs and to the question of food,
and it is difficult to see where a majority is to come from.
All parties are disgusted with the way in which the War
has been carried on, and yet no one can say how matters
should be improved. You can imagine with what enthusi-
asm I, who have been forbidden to resign, approach the
task. If only we could get rid of your KAISER for a week I
believe there would be no obstacle whatever to peace.
Von K. Imagine him coming back after an absence of a
week and finding that the whole world has made peace and
that all the speeches he was going to deliver are become
quite useless. He doesn't yet know how terrible are the
pangs of an undelivered speech. At any rate I have tried
to talk sense. Peace is what we want, all of us, and yet we
do not bring it any nearer. All this talk of smashing victo-
ries is the merest moonshine. We get victories of a sort, but
they lead to nothing. It's time we tried some other way.
Dr. W. I agree most heartily.
Von S. And I.

THE SPARROWS’ FRIEND.
THE fair city of Paris for too long
has not been on our visiting lists, nor
is it, I fear, likely to be reinstated there
just yet; but for some of us, at any
rate, it will never be quite the same
again, by reason of the absence of
M. PoſL. -
If you entered the Tuileries any fine
morning (and surely the sun always
shone in Paris, did it not 2) by the
gates opposite FREMIET's golden arro-
gant Joan of Arc and turned into the
gardens opposite the white Gambetta
memorial, you were certain to see a
little knot of people gathered around
an old gentleman in a black slouch hat,
with a deeply furrowed melancholy
face, a heavy moustache and the vast
comfortable slippers of one who (like
so many a wise Frenchman) cares no-
thing for the opinion of others. All about
him, pecking among the grass of the
little enclosed lawns, or on the gravel
path at his feet, or fluttering up to his
hands and down again, were sparrows
—les moineaux–for this was M. Pol,
the famous “charmeur d'oiseau.r.”
There is a certain attraction about
Nôtre Dame, its gloom and its glass
and its history; Sainte Chapelle is not
without an alluring beauty; the Louvre
contains a picture or two and a statue
or two that demand to be seen and seen
again; but this old retired civil servant
with the magic power over the gamins
of the Parisian eaves and chimney-
stacks was far more magnetic to many
a tourist. Those other of BAEDEKER's
lions were permanent and would endure
(I speak of fondly assured days before
Big Bertha was dreamed of), but a
frowsy unhappy old man in scandalous
slippers who not only charmed the
sparrows but quite clearly had intimate
understandings with each was a marvel
indeed and not to be missed. Nôtre
Dame's twin towers on each side of
that miracle of a window would be
there next time; but would M. Pol, ?
That is how we reasoned.
We did well to see him as often as
we could, for he is now no more; he
died a few days ago.
For some time the old man had been
missing from his accustomed haunts
through blindness, and Death found
him at his home at Chandon-Lagache,
in the midst of the composition of
rhymes about his little friends, which
had long been his hobby, and took him
quite peacefully.
I have stood by M. Poſ, for hours,
hoping to acquire something of his
mystery; but these things come from
within. He knew many of the birds
by name, and he used to level terrible
charges against them, as facetious
Husband (to wife in the Q.M.A.A.C.s). “Look HERE, MARJORY, I WISH To GooDNESS
YOU wouldN'T HANG YOUR BEASTLY TUNIC ON MY PEG !”
uncles do with little nephews and
nieces. More French ; that is all. One
very innocent mite—or as innocent as
a Paris sparrow can be—was branded
as L'Alcoolique. Never was a bird less
of an inebriate, but no crumb or grain
could it get except upon the invitation,
“Wiens, prendre ton Pernod 1" Another
was Marguerite, saucy baggage; an-
other, La Comtesse; another L'Ang-
lais, and this one was addressed in our
own tongue. Now and then among
the pigmies a giant pigeon would
greedily stalk: welcome too. But it
was with his sparrows that M. Pol,
was at his best—remonstrative, mina-
tory, caustic; but always humorous,
always tender beneath.
Latterly he sold a postcard now and
then, with himself photographed on it
amid verses and birds; but that was a
mere side issue. Often strangers would
engage him in conversation, and he
would reply with the ready irony of
France; but he displayed little interest.
His heart was with those others, One
felt that the more he saw of men the
more he liked sparrows.
The French have a genius for gay
commemorative sculpture. If a statue
of M. Pol, were set up on the scene
of his triumphs (and many things are
less likely), with little bronze moineaua.
all about him, I for one should make
it an object of pilgrimage.

“Re — Street. Our man called at the

[JULY 10, 1918.
NOVEL FAMINE THREATENED,
SYMposiuM of CELEBRITIES.
IN face of the threatened increase in
the price of the novel from six shillings
to nine shillings, Mr. Punch has been
at pains to collect the opinions of repre-
sentative leaders of the literary pro-
fession. It will be noticed that on the
whole they take a serious but not hope-
less view of the situation.
Sir THoMAs HALL CAINE, in the course
of a long and interesting statement,
which we greatly regret being unable
to reproduce in full, remarked, “It is
notoriously rash to generalise from in-
dividual instances, but, judging from
my own case, I am sure that the en-
hanced price, should it be adopted, will
lay an extra responsibility on the con-
scientious artist, and impel him to give
proportionate value, if not in bulk at any
rate in quality, for the increased price.
Where the highest level of achievement
has already been attained this is no
easy matter. But it should always be
the aim of genius to achieve the impos-
sible. If the price should have to be
raised I must say, as a strong supporter
of the decimal system, that I should
prefer the figure to be ten shillings
rather than nine shillings.”
Mrs. ELINor GLYN observed: “Any-
thing that interferes with the greatest
happiness of the greatest number is to
be deprecated. To be more specific,
any change calculated to withhold the
emollient and elevating influence of
high-class fiction from the suffering
masses would be little short of a cala-
mity. People talk of the paper famine,
but they hardly realise the spiritual
scarcity that would ensue from a short-
age of that uplift which is provided by
great novels. As SHAKSPEARE says,
they ‘knit up the ravelled sleave of care.'
I can only say that I have the greatest
confidence in the benevolence, the sa-
gacity and the resourcefulness of my
publisher. If a way out can be found
he will find it.” . . .
“Callisthenes" is inclined to agree
with a writer in The Westminster Gazette
that sales would probably be reduced,
but, as he puts it, “What generous
reader can fail to make the sacrifice 2
Think of what three shillings means—
the price of a pound of tea or a box of
sardines. We cannot afford to dispense
with intellectual pabulum.”
Mr. II. DE WERE STAcpoolE was en-
gaged in writing a letter to The Morn-
ing Post, but kindly interrupted his
labours for a few moments to ejacu-
late the following comments: “It all
depends on the national importance
of the writer. If Mr. HUGHEs—great
heavens, what a man l—would only
write a novel I should like to see a law
passed rendering it obligatory on every-
body to purchase the book, no matter
what the price.”
Mr. John Oxex HAM obligingly dashed
off the accompanying impromptu :—
“Those who write for the hall, not the hovel,
Will have no occasion to weep;
But I think that nine bob for a novel
Is just a bit steep.”
The PoET LAUREATE writes: “I can-
not spare much time from my researches
into metre to consider the economics of
publishing. But nine, as the number
of the Muses, has at least that to recom-
mend it, though I think that in the
interest of letters ninety shillings would
be better still. Why not agitate for a
Ministry of Fiction?—unless indeed one
exists already.”
VOCAL TRAGEDIES.
A MAIDEN whose talent was choral
Craved “tributes” exclusive and
“floral;”
She appeared on the scenes,
But was greeted with greens,
And rashly resorted to chloral.
The eminent vocalist, Chianti,
Stood high mid the bassi cantanti;
But he made it his aim
To live up to his name,
And went irredeemably “Fanti.”
Professor Marcellus P. Otis
Attracted a great deal of notice;
His pupils, 'tis true,
Couldn't sing, but they knew
All about the soft palate and glottis.
There was a young tenor named Jones
Who produced the most exquisite tones;
But his height was no more
Than a bare five feet four,
And his weight was at least sixteen
stones. - - - -
A contralto from far Demerara
Appeared on the gay Riviera,
But, among other “buts,"
Couldn't warble for nuts, - - -
Though christened auspiciously Clara.
I knew an old bass who could floor
At sight the most crabbèd full score;
His science was great,
But I grieve to relate . -
That he never obtained an encore.
There was a young diva whose smile
Was as sweet as her singing was vile;
Her voice was half cracked,
But then—she could act,
And could dance in the Muscovite style.
On the picturesque slopes of Lugano
Lived a girl with a gorgeous soprano;
But the tragical thing
Was she never could sing
In the key that was played on the
piano.
AT THE OPERA
(SEMI-GRAND).
“IL SERAGLIo.”
I Fou ND it a sufficiently sharp con-
trast to Tristan of the night before.
Not that MozART's Musical Comedy is
any funnier than WAGNER's Tragedy—
I speak of course of the stage and not
the orchestra. For in the action of
Tristan there are moments (or perhaps
I had better say half-hours, for on the
Wagnerian stage you don't have mo-
ments) of an exquisite humour—King
Mark's portentous homily for one, and,
for another, Tristan's interminable out-
pourings at the top of his voice in the
very article of death. But the garrulous
gaiety of the music of Il Seraglio makes
more than amends for the primitive
humour of the plot and libretto.
Perhaps Mr. ALFRED HEATHER, who
played Pedrillo, would have done better
to leave it at that and not introduce
what he seemed to regard as “topical”
allusions to Medical Boards and Food
Coupons. I admit that several of the
characters, though retaining their exotic
names, had become naturalised English
folk for the occasion; but Pedrillo per-
sisted in wearing what I took to be a
Spanish costume, and was at the time
attached to the hareem of a Turkish
Pasha; so that I shouldn't have thought
he would want to worry about food-
shortage in remote England, even if he
had been in the right century for it.
However the music, and not the
play, is the thing, and though it kept
on recapturing its fluent phrases its
charm never cloyed. Miss AGNES
Nicholls, as the constant Comstanza,
sang with a rare and refined sweet-
ness, and in the part of Blonde Miss
DESIR£E ELLINGER, light of heart and
foot, warbled like a linnet. Mr.
MAURICE D'OISLY gave distinction to
the conventional part of the lover
Belmonte by the ease of his methods,
and Mr. RADFord's mellow voice lent
a rich colouring to the banalities of
|the comic Vizier. Sir Thomas BEEchAM
O. S.
conducted most sensitively.
“Varium et Mutabile . . .”
A provincial theatre poster:—
“THE GIRL, WHO
Chang Ed HER MIND
Twice Nightly.”
A correspondent in Umtata, Cape of
Good Hope, sends us an extract from
the local Territorial News, giving, under
the heading “WAR. The Latest,” an
account of the Vindictive's feat at
Ostend. “Our losses,” it says, “was
only a motor lunch.” Happy Umtata,
that can talk so lightly of wasted food!

“WAITER, I wish You 'D BRING ONE OF THOSE FOR our whisky. I THINK IT MIGHT Do IT good To LIE Down.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To-DAY a new book by LEONARD MERRICK must be read
with mingled sadness and delight. I have experienced full
measure of both over While Paris Laughed (Hodder AND
Stoughton), the volume of posthumous stories forming
part of the collected edition in which this rare artist has at
length come by his own. The tales themselves, merry
adventures of one Tricotrim, poet and Bohemian gallant,
show their author in that mood of whimsical and genial
cynicism in which perhaps he was at his best. These
pranks of Tricotrim and his impecunious friends, sallying
forth from some bare attic in Montmartre to make the
world, especially the bourgeois world, their oyster, have a
careless gaiety that catches the very spirit of youth and
spring and Paris. Second-rate stories of poor students are
so much the commonplace of the magazines that the
genius of these comes as a delightful refreshment. One
feels that, to extract their full flavour, they should be read
over a bock or a tumbler of coffee and a caporal. There
exists a fashion to call LEONARD MERRICK an author's
author, as though his method held some subtlety of tech-
nique only to be fathomed by the expert. No impression
could be more false. Style such as that of these Tricotrim
tales, light as froth and exhilarating as champagne, surely
demands no training for its enjoyment, though the crafts-
man may discover an added excellence in the art with
which some quite ordinary phrase will be quickened by
an unexpected and irresistible turn. While Paris Laughed
remains, in short, a wholly delightful volume that leaves
one longing vainly for more.
The publishers of That Which Hath Wings (HEINEMANN)
seem greatly concerned to assure any purchaser that, in
bulk at least, he will get value for his money. Three times
on the paper jacket do they print a stimulating guarantee
of “500 pages.” In imagination I have seen Mr. RICHARD
DEHAN bravely struggling to carry out his share in the
bargain; and, not in imagination but in fact, I observe a
promising story spoilt by a superabundance of chatter—
though who is actually to blame I will not presume to
guess. The author has called his book “a novel of the
day,” a title permitting considerable latitude, of which he
certainly takes full advantage. Thus, beginning with a
brilliant, if rather too sensational, picture of the hectic
spring of 1914, and a very promising story of two young
married lovers, we presently drop Franky and Margot
almost entirely, and plunge into a quite different affair,
of which Patrine, victim of Prussian brutality to woman, is
the unhappy heroine. Even her woes however would hardly
run to five hundred pages; and as a result we have whole
chapters of disquisition upon any subject (apparently) that
the author feels urged to write about, from Catholic dogma
to twilight sleep. The most holding episode in the tale is
that of young Bawne (son of the hero of Mr. RICHARD
DEHAN's The Dop Doctor) and his adventures behind the
German lines. I should sum up That Which Hath Wings
as a story composed of some vivid patches, rather in the
tuppence-coloured style, and a great deal of dullish matter
whose only reason for existence seems to be the one which
I have suggested above.
If Mr. J. D. BERESFORD has taken a pathological subject
for the hero of God's Counterpoint (CoLLINs) , he has

first-class misunderstanding when Philip marries a really
diagnosed his case with singular skill and discretion.
Philip Maning has been brought up by a tyrannical father
and a nice but negligible mother in an atmosphere in which
discussion, instruction and even frank thinking on sex
perplexities are absolutely taboo. The whole business is
evil, root and branch, and there's an end of it. Add a
perfectly appalling priggishness and a pseudo-romantic illu-
sion about woman as a detached and pedestalled goddess a
little higher than the angels and you have the elements of a
finely-tempered, thoroughly human and sensible woman.

not wholly evil, and that what Evelyn might give is some-

If anyone wishes to know, more or less, how the organism
called the German Empire is constructed and how it func-
tions under the stress of war he cannot do better than
consult Wilhelm Hohenzollern & Co., by WILLIAM LYELL
Fox (HURST AND BLACKETT). Mr. Fox has a vivid style of
the American kind, and possesses the knack of assimilating
facts and turning them oit as information in double-quick
time, which is only another way of saying that he is a good
journalist. He frankly admits that he writes favourably of
the Germans when truth seems to require it, but the bulk of
the book was written before America had actually declared
war against Germany. Incidentally he quotes from a French
soldier who had escaped from German hands at Charleroi a
small but interesting piece of information about WILHELM
the Magnifico. Says the Frenchman: “He [the Emperor

And, as the virgin counterfoils you sign,
However limited your education,
Though authorship is not your line,
You'll seem to catch the spark divine
And claim the credit of collaboration.
Lastly, let no man barter it for pay
On pain of durance under prison-warders;
But guard it closely night and day,
Wearing it next your heart alway,
Until released by Death—or Further Orders.

FORCED CORRESPONDENCE.
A RECENT article in Punch, entitled “The Pillar Box,”
recalls to my mind the case of a family similarly condi-
tioned and actuated by similar motives—the desire to con-
duct a vast amount of correspondence to prevent a pillar-
box being closed as unnecessary.
I have been privileged to peruse a portion of the corre-
spondence and give a few specimens. These specimens may
suggest a plan of campaign to other country residents who
are nervous about their pillar-boxes.
The Family to Blank and Co.
Having seen your advertisement regarding your cycle
enamel I would ask, Is your enamel applied with a brush 2
Blank and Co. to the Family.
In reply to your favour of the 5th inst, we beg to state
that our cycle enamel is applied with a brush in the usual
way. Particulars are enclosed and we should be glad to
receive your orders.
The Family to Blank and Co.
Your advertisements state that your enamel is a gloss
enamel. What is gloss?
Blank and Co. to the Family.
In reply to your favour of the 7th inst. gloss is the effect
produced by our enamel. Particulars are enclosed and we
should be glad to receive your orders.
The Family to Blank and Co.
Kindly send a small free sample of your enamel by
passenger train.
Blank and Co. to the Family.
In reply to your favour of the 11th inst. we regret that
we are unable to send out samples, owing to the War.
Paeawsbgtryo [I have adopted this formula for the words
“Particulars are enclosed and we should be glad to receive
your orders,” which come in at the end of the majority of
the letters written by Blank and Co. This will save the
printer's time and economise paper].
The Family to Blank and Co.
If you cannot send a small free sample can you send a
large free sample?
The Family to Blank and Co.
I am surprised that you have not replied to my letter
of the 14th March. Please let me have a reply by return
of post. If I paint the rims of my cycle with your enamel
will the action of the rim-brakes rub the enamel off? Can
an amateur apply your enamel?
Blank and Co. to the Family.
We regret the unavoidable delay in replying to your
letter of the 14th inst., and beg to refer you to ours of the
11th regarding samples. Our enamel should not be applied
to the brake path on the rims of a cycle. In answer to
the last portion of your letter you can put it on yourself.
Paeawsbgtryo.
The Family to Blank and Co.
I am deeply interested to hear that your enamel is suit-
able for application to human beings. Our postman is old
and would be improved by renovation. Do you think a
bright yellow would be satisfactory, or would a delicate
Rose du Barry be more suitable?
Blank and Co. to the Family.
In reply to your favour of the 19th inst. you apparently
misunderstood our letter of the 17th. What we intended to
convey was that our enamel can be applied by an amateur
painter. Paeawsbgtryo.
The Family to Blank and Co.
Perhaps you are right. The postman might object. He
is rather touchy sometimes. I have a number of White
Leghorns which I should like to sell as rare tropical birds.
Would your enamel be suitable for this purpose? If so
please send by post small tins of brilliant red, light and
dark blue, old gold and puce.
Blank and Co. to the Family. - -
In reply to your favour of the 24th inst, we do not re-
commend that our enamel be applied to poultry. All the
colours you mention, including brilliant reds, are out of
stock, although we expect to have a supply ready in a day
or two. Paeawsbgtryo.
The Family to Blank and Co.
Kindly let me know by return whether brilliant red is in
stock now. If so please quote for one gallon. And can you
guarantee that your enamel would be suitable for repainting
our pillar-box”

THE WAR-TIME VALUE OF WORDS.
“HURRY UP THERE, PLEASE
PLENTY OF ROOM, DOWN THE CENTRE OF THE CAR.”
ISHMAEL, R.G.A.
IT was nearing the end of the Per-
fect Day, and the Brigadier of Heavy
Artillery was sitting in the little office
in his château at tea. He had killed off
the day's allowance of Bosches and had
deleted on the map the hostile batteries
that had ceased to exist.
Into this haven of rest came an officer
with a little black bag. Said he, “Are
you aware, Sir, of the futility of our
efforts 2 ”
“I guessed it,” thought the General;
“I shall find Harrogate Salts at the
bottom of the page.”
“My name is Dale, and I have a
scheme here which, if adopted, will
enable anyone, after a correspondence
course, to strafe anything from a bottle
in a shooting-gallery to the citadel at
Lille.”
He opened his bag, brought out a
that, one could calculate where it would
have fallen if one hadn't.”
The General didn't understand this
a bit, so he looked as wise as he could
and said, “Quite.”
“Now we arrest the shell by making
it burst in the air, then by means of
my simple method, guaranteed to pro-
duce results every time, the rest is easy.
Thus—”
The General had fallen asleep. A
crash on the table as Dale's fist met it
woke him in a fright to hear:—
“The tangent of the apparent angle
of descent equals the tangent of the
true angle of descent, divided by the
sine of the apex angle > y
The General shuddered. “I thought
you'd gone. Look here—I'm only a
poor simple fighting man, and it's no
use your blaming me for it at all. You
go and see Colonel Powis. He loves
figures and repeats tables to himself

one could arrest the projectile along So Dale packed his little bag with the
paper and wire, pinched the General's
Vie Parisienne, and went into the night.
:k :: -k :: ::
Colonel Powis, of the 300th H.A.
Group, had resisted the temptation of
an after-tea game of bridge, borrowed a
cigar from the padre, and was nailing up
some KIRCHNER postcards. In walked
Dale. He said nothing, but opened the
bag, brought out the bit of wire and the
papers, put back a German dud, and
began, “I have here a scheme—”
“I don't like schemes myself,” said
the Colonel. “It’s people like you who
spoil a decent war.”
“One minute, Sir. The General sent
me to you because you are the keenest
gunner in the Army. This is a plan
for resolving the apparent height of a
burst in the air into the distance burst
short, calculated by solid trigonometry.”
“Ah, yes. Great thing that last.
You want to see Chapman of the West
Midlands—he's an engineer, and he'll
love you, and probably leave you in his
will if he dies first, which isn't likely.
Atkins, give him his tram fare and tell
him where to go.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Dale plunged once more into the
muddy darkness with his optimism and
his little black bag.
The battery headquarters of the West
Midlands was in the pangs of labour.
It was Saturday night and it had been
a busy week. Chapman had murdered
Huns in scores, but he'd taken no notice
of the heap of correspondence that had
accumulated. Threats of prosecution
had left him unmoved, and it was only
the Staff Captain's tearful references to
his starving wives and children that
had touched him. Behold him now in
his shirtsleeves adding up figures and
filling up forms out of his own head
like a bookmaker's clerk at Hurst Park
on a Bank Holiday.
Enter figure bearing bag. It is
muddy and wet, but the gleam in the
undefeated eye proves it to be Dale, my
dear Watson.
“This is not the public bar,” said
Chapman, who was a coarse irreverent
person. “What is it, tea or insurance
policies?”
“I have here a scheme—” began
Dale.
“No good, old chap. I’m awful busy,
and they're going to send me home if
I don't get all these sums done by to-
night. If it's gunnery you're on, see
Maguire at the right section. He's
been doing it for years and years and
ears, ever since there was a war, and
e's very keen. Goes over at night
and hits his duds with a hammer to
make 'em go off. He'll follow you
about like a fox-terrier after a bit of
liver if you've got anything new.”
The reel ends with Dale once more
trudging through the darkness towards
better things.
Unluckily for Dale, Maguire was at
the O.P., and the captain of the battery
had been fetched away from his horses
to look after the section. It was demd
dull, but by mixing together a little
from every bottle on the shelf and set-
ting fire to the result he made a passable
cocktail, and tided over the bad patches.
with the aid of the gramophone.
During the evening in walked the
weirdest object he'd ever seen. It was
covered with mud, and it opened a little
black bag full of waste-paper and wire
that had come from a dustbin, and
began to talk. It did talk, and the
Captain couldn't understand a word.
He kept the bayonet handy that they
used for a poker in case it was a
German or a civilian visitor to the
Front. At last he led it out to the
guns. Just at that moment one of
the guns fired; some of the mud on the
figure cracked and came off, and he
recognised it for an officer. Then it

began to dawn on him that it hadn't
come to tune the piano, but that it was
talking about Geometry. He stinted
and said, “Maguire is it you want?
Keep straight up the road, turn to the
right at the first trench, and you'll find
him in Dog's Nose Willa. Hurry, in
case he hears you coming and commits
suicide.”
And on, ever on, went the pilgrim.

The elusive Maguire was chatting to
some pessimistic infantrymen when the
pioneer of efficiency arrived, so the latter
poured all his ideas into the ear of the
telephonist. The telephonist had once
been doorkeeper to an editor and force
of habit stepped in.
“Yes, Sir. Keep straight on till you
get to the front line. Take the first
opening in front of you, crawl under
the wire across by the shell holes and
go straight forward. Never mind the
bullets. It's only the fellows clearing.
out their rifles. Drop into the next
trench you come to and ask again.”
Maybe the Herr Oberleutnant in

he's still wandering on; but his memory
lives with certain sterm soldiers to this
day. -

THE 0STRICH AND THE PASTRYC00K.
[“Successful experiments have been made
in this country for the use in confectionery of
liquid ostrich eggs.”—Daily Chronicle.]
THE ostrich is a curious fowl,
Unlike the peacock or the owl;
He runs with a prodigious speed,
Outstripping barbs of Arab breed.
His appetite is catholic,
For, if you heave at him a brick,
A bottle, or a nail or shoe,
He swallows and digests 'em too.
The ostrich is robust and tall
And active, but his brain is small;
His way of playing hide-and-seek
Is quite pathetic, though unique.
He is not, simply viewed as meat,
Particularly good to eat;
But yearly plucked and curled and
sold -
His feathers fetch their weight in
gold.
So much I knew before the War
Of ostriches and ostrich lore,
But only learned a week ago
Of other boons which they bestow.
For now confectioners, a clan
Who comfort much-enduring man,
Have enterprisingly bestirred
Themselves to utilise this bird,
And from its large and liquid eggs,
Hermetically sealed in kegs,
They draw profuse materials, which
In proteids are extremely rich.
Then let us hail with joyful tunes
The ostrich for its latest boons,
Including, though their products vary,
The emu and the cassowary.

THE GRUMPET HOUND.
To my humble and incurious ear
has come the first faint whisper of a
new Army sensation. Officialdom and
bureaucracy have once more attempted
to legislate for the human heart, . It
seems that there are those in high
places who suppose that mere plenitude
of braid and badges may fit a mortal
man to sit in judgment upon another's
dog.
From a horrified depôt in France one
Cooperthwaite, a man universally hon-
oured by dogs gentle and simple, writes
to me with a fountain-pen that splutters
from sheer bewilderment.
“Read this,” he writes, “which was
circulated a week ago by our new com-
mandant, and never ask again why the
War takes so long to win:—
“‘All Officers desirous of keeping a
dog will please parade their dogs at this
office at 9 A.M. to-morrow, so that the
C.O. may decide.'
“How and what did the C.O. propose
to decide?” asks Cooperthwaite rheto-
rically, well aware of my inability to
answer. “Were he a connoisseur I
should see in this order a dark design,
and keep my invaluable Behemoth
strictly under my eye till the C.O., had
a dog of his own. But he is not. Never
a dog in the depôt follows any pattern
familiar to him. He is perhaps know-
ledgable concerning standard dogs,
dogs of family, conventional types vary-
ing conventionally, such as terrier, fox,
Mark I and Mark I*, but has his chill
heart room for that unique and com-
panionable scallywag, that sport (in the
biological as in the popular sense), the
Active Service Dog of whom the Kennel
Club takes no cognisance? -
“We know him and his qualities, his
discrimination, his camaraderie, his
Mark Tapleyism, but upon his origins
who will theorise? Who dare legislate
regarding points which will never be
repeated 2 Seldom indeed are his beau-
ties physical. The frank and unem-
barrassed soul that laughs through the
brown windows of his eyes owes its
happiness to no pride of pedigree. He
is not a prize-winner; he is a philo-
sopher. “And the O.C. would decide!'
Is he a seer to read the hearts of dogs
and men, and comprehend the basis of
their love 2 How could his young ex-
perience enable him to judge the suit-
ability of my Behemoth as a companion
for me—Behemoth, who met me at
Levantie and knew a kindred soul?
Or to appreciate Macpherson's shape-
less Susan, who threw in her lot with
him at Kemmel? Or Russell's Pongo,
faultless ratter and devoted friend,
though of preposterously ungraceful
presence? Such as these we vowed
we would parade for no man. For that
matter, were it not presumptuous to
boast that we “kept 'such creatures as
these? They share the vicissitudes of
life and rations with us, but we do not
and could not ‘keep' them. Did they
wish to do so they could leave us to-
morrow as they came, vanishing into
the unknown whence, smiling and with
agitated sterns, they came to us.
“We held a little meeting and decided
upon a course of action. Each officer
paraded a dog, but the same dog, the
Sergeant-Major's indescribable Heinz,
so-called because his appearance sug-
gests at least ‘57 varieties in pedi-
gree. He is like—but he is like nothing
you have ever seen; and is more in-
telligent, far more, than any creature
who dissipates his thought in speech.
“The C.O. was caustic when Heinz
was shown into his office for the first
time, but when he had seen him seven
times it was plain that he recognised
the peril of condemning over-hastily a
strain so consistent in its ugliness.
‘What do you call these dogs?' he asked
Huggins, Heinz's seventh introducer.
‘Not dogs, please, Sir," said Huggins,
shocked; “hounds. Crumpet hounds.
The Flemish keep them to watch their
crumpets toasting, and bark when they
are brown. I call mine Alfred.’
“When he had inspected Heinz nine
times the C.O. grew weary. “I won't
see any more to-day,' he said; “some
morning next week we'll have the pack
out and make toast for the depôt.'
“We still await that parade, George.
Meanwhile we begin to like the new
Commandant, who has struck up a
close friendship with an animal I can
only describe as a Skye-Fox-Poodle,
and not one of us has lost his dog.”
MY CHERRY-TREE.
THE blossom of my cherry-tree
Was an enchanting sight to see
(When you could tellit from the snow);
Along this row
No other house had such a show ;
The birds would come and chirp for
hours
About the dietetic promise of those
flowers.
But yesterday I went to see
The produce of my cherry-tree;
The harvest seemed to be just one,
And not much fun
In that, for it was underdone.
A blackbird pinched that green eve- |
lamb
And now regrets it in his little dia-
phragm.

“I see,” said the City man, “that
someone has invented an instrument
for cutting coupons. That seems to me
a perversion of brain-power. What can
be easieror simpler than cutting coupons
with a pair of nail-scissors?”
“Or tearing them off?” someone
said.
“Yes, or tearing them off. Still,
here it is, in black and white. “A
handy instrument for cutting coupons.”
Now that may supply a long-felt want,
or it may not, and personally I deplore
it, because it suggests that the War is
going on for ever; but,” the City man
continued, “there is, as a matter of fact,
one invention that really is needed.”
He paused so long that one of us
simply had to say, “What is that ?”
“A clip,” said the City man, “to be
clamped on to telephones to hold the ear-
piece so that, while a message is being
waited for, one can go on writing or
reading letters. As it is you have only
one hand free instead of two. I am
continually ringing up people who have
to be fetched to the telephone from
distant parts of their offices, and all the
time I am waiting for them is lost,
just because I have only one hand free.”
“There are gadgets for the purpose,”
someone said.
“Anyhow, what I want is merely a
piece of bent iron that can be fixed to
any telephone, with a cradle for the
ear-piece. Surely that shouldn't cost
more than half-a-crown. Why, I'd
finance the thing myself.”
“Is there any invention you want?”
the City man suddenly asked, turning
to his neighbour.
“Most decidedly not,” he replied.
“All inventions are detestable to me.
But I can't think,” he continued wist-
fully, “why those memory mind-train-
ing people have chosen just this time
for appealing to the public. I've no
doubt it s a splendid system—in fact,
after reading all the literary swells on
its merits, I'm sure it is—but why now 2
why now 2"
“Why not?” I asked.
“Because,” said he, “these are times
when one wants not to learn how to
remember but to learn how to forget.
I'm always recalling things that I
would give anything to leave in ob-
livion; chiefly the old happy days before
the War—the days that can never come
again. The backward look was always
melancholy, but before the War one
could make some effort to repeat old
joys. Now one can't. Take cricket, for
example. I went to see that match at
Lord's the other day, but what was the
use of it? It was all wrong. It wasn't
cricket; it was a memorial service in
honour of a game long since dead. It
made me perfectly miserable, whereas,
if I had taken a course of honest
memory-destroyer, I should have been
perfectly serene. I should have come
to it fresh. And that 's not all,” he
went on. “There are discreditable pas-
sages in one's own life that one wants
to forget. Isn't that so?”
“Speak for yourself,” we said.
“I do,” he replied. “Well, one
couldn't forget them, before, and one
will forget them even less if one goes
in for the sinewy mind-training course.
Now why doesn't someone start a Nir-
vana System or a Nepenthe System,
or a Lethe System, or whatever you
scholarly fellows may call it, and give
some of us a chance to be a little at
peace with ourselves?”
“What about alcohol?” someone
suggested. “Don't you remember
HENLEY's line:—
‘Let us be dumb and for a while forget'?”
“That's no good,” he said testily.
“Only millionaires can be drunk now
on wine; or, on spirits, only men with
an unlimited capacity for absorption,the
stuff's so weak. No, it's mind-training
I want, not body-drenching. I want a
system that undertakes to make me
forget what I don't want to remember.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 8th.-The popular re-
cipe for winning the War is to intern
such enemy aliens as still retain a cer-
tain measure of restricted freedom. It
found an enthusiastic exponent in Lord!
BERESFORD and a vociferous
critic in Lord BUCKMASTER,
who refused to be a party to
interning everybody who had
a name which was difficult
to pronounce—a rule which
would press hardly, by the
way, upon the holders of
some undoubtedly British
patronymics, such as Sir
HENRY DALZIEL, the fugle-
man of the alien-hunters in
the Commons.
Originally elected for seven
years, the present Parlia-
ment promptly reduced its
statutory term by two years.
Mr. AsquiTH, a little hyper-S
bolically, described this as
“an act of rare self-sacri-
fice.” However, the War
prevented the sacrifice from
being consummated and Par-
liament has since on five
occasions lengthened its own
existence until with the ex-
tension approved to-day it
bids fair to last on into its
eighth year. But though no direct op-
position was offered there was a general
sentiment running through the speeches
that this must be “the last time, Clem,
my boy,” and that the new voters must
soon have a chance of electing a new
House of Commons—a prospect which
Mr. Ponson BY, of all people, appeared
to welcome. Now that is self-sacri-
fice.
Tuesday, July 9th.-You remember
the story of the over-insured shop-
keeper who, to the congratulations of
a friend on “his beautiful fire last Tues-
day,” replied, “Not last Tuesday, you
fool; next Tuesday!” It came into my
mind when Mr. Hogg|E, a propos of a
question put by Mr. PRINGLE, began to
recite in impressive tones an obviously
prepared “supplementary.” He was
pulled up by his confederate's agonized
whisper, “Not this question, you—”
[I. failed to catch the term of endear-
ment employed], and the ensuing
laughter. Most men would have kept
quiet after that; but Mr. HoggE, nothing
if not pachydermatous, repeated his
“supplementary” after Mr. PRINGLE's
next question.
Lord Robert CECIL had quite a
pleasant afternoon. Upon Mr. KING's
expressing anxiety lest the reticence of
the Foreign Office should cause it to
be unjustly blamed for the mistakes of
other departments he gratefully replied,
“I am sure if my department is blamed
it is blamed unjustly.” Next he pooh-
poohed the same hon. Member's appre-
hensions regarding the public utterances
of some British emissaries to America,
and assured him that “more harm is

done by certain speeches and questions
in this House.”
Finally, he explained the much-can-
vassed concessions to the Dutch convoy
in a manner which seemed to satisfy
most of the critics; though it was not
quite easy to understand why, if the
conditions agreed upon gave us more
substantial security than we could have

obtained by the exercise of the right of
search at sea, we should have been at so
much pains to inform the Netherlands
Government that the arrangement was
not to be taken as forming a precedent.
A good many Members looked askance
at the Maternity and Child Welfare Bill
on the ground that it might
prejudice the proposal for a
Ministry of Health, on which
they have set their hearts.
Mr. HAYES FISHER had to use
a good deal of tact to get it
through Committee. If it
were “a shabby little Bill,”
as someone had called it, it
would, at any rate, he said,
comfort a good many “shab-
by little” mothers.
Wednesday, July 10th.-If
the present House of Com-
mons could bind its succes-
sors we might hope that pen-
sions would be permanently
divorced from party politics.
The American system, of
which Sir MonTAGUE BAR-
Low gave some racy illustra-
tions, might add to the gaiety
of the nation but would cer-
tainly corrupt its honesty.
Mr. Hogge, who knows a
good deal about pensions and
politicians, was convinced
that, whatever the House
might decide, candidates would not re-
sist the temptation to bid against one
another for the pensioners' vote.
Incidentally the debate revealed the
fact that, when the Pensions Ministry
was formed, its now pertinacious critic
asked for or was offered—on this point
he and Mr. BoNAR LAw contradicted one
another flatly—the post of its Under-
Secretary. Whether the hon. Member
refused to sacrifice his independence or
whether the Pensions Minister declined
to work tali auxilio—again the authori-
ties differ—Mr. HoggE must be regarded
as a Stickit Minister, and all allowances
made for him.
The rest of the evening was taken up
with an attack on the National Ship-
yards, which so far have cost several
millions of money without producing a
single vessel. But if the House ex-
pected to see another volte-face on the
part of another GEDDEs it was dis-
appointed. Brother ERIC was as stiff
as Brother AUCKLAND (in the matter of
Grades) had been pliant, and, declaring
that the project had the support of Lord
PIRRIE (who sat in the Peers' Gallery),
announced his determination to see it
through to the end.

their peaceful object they seem to have
gone in largely for drilling and rifle-

I HAVE told you once before
How Augustus (surnamed Gore)
Practically won the War.
Now if you will listen well
I will try my best to tell
How Augustus in a fit
Of abstraction finished it;
How, when the persistent Bosch
Wouldn't budge, the wily Foch,
Sending straight to Oxford's attics,
Dragged him from his mathematics.
The result, as you may guess,
Was a most complete success.
Brave Augustus boldly ran,
Dealing death with cot. and tan.
Straight through all the Hun's de-
fences,
Lines and lines and lines of trenches,
Till he noticed Kaiser BILL
Standing on a little hill.
Possibly Augustus may
Have been overwrought that day;
Dusty were his riding breeches
And his cap was crooked, which is
Hardly what you'd call correct,
Nor what Emperors expect.
It has even been disputed
Whether Mr. Gore saluted.
Then the KAISER in a pet
(For on points of etiquette
He is quite absurdly fussy),
Glaring angrily at Gussie,
Cried profanely, “Peace, be still! I am
The All-HighestWar-Lord WILLIAM!”
It had certainly been wiser
If the mild and saintly KAISER
Had resolved at once to go;
But he lost his chance and so
Fell, 'midst torrents of abuse,
Base over hypotenuse,
And of further life gave no sign—
Gore had pinked him with a cosine.

FABULOUS FRIENDS.
I MET Prince Charming on the wind-
ing white chalk road that led from
the railway-station. He was really and
truly Prince Charming, though he was
disguised as a subaltern home on leave
from the Front; but even had I doubted
I should have been reassured by the
bow with which he at first met my
greeting, a bow that was straight from
the old book of French fairy tales in the
dimmest corner of the schoolroom book-
shelf. Then he remembered our actual
setting and saluted in the ordinary way.
Next, he offered me a cigarette, and we
sat down on a green hump to renew our
old acquaintance.
“Is this your first leave?” I asked.
“Oh, no, I have had two leaves in
France and one in Eng- |T
land before this. Last time
I came to see Cinderella— =
she's a temporary mortal
too—in her boot and shoe
shop. She was losing cus-

her glass slipper on all
customers first, by way
of taking a measure, and
those it didn't fit didn't
like it. She encouraged
rats and mice too, on the
ground that they were old
friends; and they were
simply eating up the shop.
I got her to take Puss-
in-Boots into partnership,
which settled the rats and
mice, and made the whole
business look up. She's
keeping it on for a man

wasn't fair to let it all slip

the matron must needs put her on night

the only remedy, and anyway it would

Then I asked that silly question:
“When do you think the War will end?
What about peace?”
Whereupon he sat up laughing and
said, “We must get on now or Ishan't

So now I've prayed—yet wherefore have I prayed,
Being myself the mouthpiece of my God,
So that the will to speak is His, not mine?
He stirs the vocal chords, and parts the lips,
And moves the tongue, that words may issue forth,
And thus the words I speak are God's, not mine—
God's, and none else's, I am sure of that.
There was a time, when I was very young,
Before I climbed the HoHENzoLLERN throne,
When I might be in fault, nay, was in fault
Just here and there, as mortals always are,
Though I, a prince, was not so much in fault
> As others are, who are not princely men;
But, from the day that I was throned, my words
Are not mine own, but speak the mind of God;
And those who stand against me thwart not me,
But mar the purpose and the power of God.
But someone nudges at his neighbour's ribs,
Hearing this speech and, “Softly, Sire,” he says;
“You find the purpose and the power of God
By consultation with yourself alone,
And when you've found it, there's an end of it.
The Great White TsAR had words to speak from God,
And they were different from the words you spoke;
And now his kingdom's gone and he is stripped
Of wealth and might and all that makes life good.
Was he deceived, and are you always right?”
“Yes,” I reply, “so long as I succeed,
God's favour's clearly with me, and I march
From strength to strength, while he retires apace
Into the outer blackness, where he lies,
A mockery and a warning to my foes.
So I have prayed, and now I go to fight;
And woe to those who stand across my path,
And strive against me, being God's own King.”
And, if in mine own time I turn my thoughts
From War, which now is goodly in my eyes,
To Peace and all that Peace may bring to us,
Lo, in that very moment War must end,
And Peace once more must reign as once she reigned;
But not when England or when France appoints,
But when we choose, my good old God and I.
Till then, who dies for me and my decrees
Is blest, and Heaven lies open for his soul.

Letter received by an officer on active service from a firm
of saddlers:—
“We beg respectfully to acknowledge the receipt of your letter and
to inform you that the brick was put in the parcel as a make-weight.
The mummah saddle weighed over 7 lbs., and could not be sent out
by parcel post, as 7 lbs. is the limit of weight allowed. The Trans-
port Officer, Southampton, will only accept parcels which are not
under 11 lbs. in weight and do not exceed 56 lbs. We are afraid
that our packer put in a heavier brick than was necessary to bring
it to the weight that the Transport Officer will accept, and we sin-
cerely trust this has not caused much inconvenience.”
When serving with the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force

OUR RED CROSS PAGEANT.
“How do you write to an under-
taker?” said Daphne, brushing back a
Bolshevik curl.
“An undertaker!” I gasped, recoiling
from the dish before me. “What on
earth 2 ”
“Oh, didn't I tell you," she said,
with a complacent smile, “that I've
been asked to organise a Tudor Pageant
in connection with the Red Cross Fête
at Pigleigh Park on the 25th 2 Lady
Cashlow is to be Kathleen of Aragon.”
“Katherine,” I murmured, and again
the Bolshevik curl came into action.
“Yes, of course, I meant Katherine.
Please don't interrupt me. And I'm
to be Ann Boleyn. I have to cast the
other characters.”
“I hope you haven't put me down,”
I began gloomily.
“I'm leaving you to the last,” she
said, “in case anyone fails me. If not,
you'll have to keep an eye on the men
at the gate, to see they don't pass their
friends in without payment. But you
haven't told me how I'm to address
Mr. Stone,” she added impatiently.
“Will this do? “Dear Mr. Stone '-
it sounds familiar, but I daren't be
standoffish—“will you kindly under-
take * > * -
“Undertake' is hardly the right word
in the circumstances,” I ventured.
“Why not say, “assume the rôle'? It
would be more tactful.”
“Very well,” said Daphne, and com-
pleted the letter. “I’m going to ask
Mr. Griggs to be Cardinal Wolsey, and
Mr. Smith to be Henry VIII. He's
been so generous to our W.A.D. hospital
that he must be given a leading part in
the pageant. Sir George and Lady
Dow are helping too, and I don't ex-
pect any difficulty in finding plenty of
people to form the crowd. The pageant
is to be entitled ‘The Meeting of
Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey at
Pigleigh.’” . . . "
“I didn't know Henry VIII. was
ever in Pigleigh,” I observed. -
“He must have been,” Daphne re-
torted. “Hadn't he six honeymoons,
and isn't it more than likely that he
spent at least one of them at Pigleigh'
I wish you wouldn't try to spoil my
scenario. You'll see how well I've
managed to bring in all the leading
characters. Listen.” - -
A sheet of notepaper was produced
from under a plate and Daphne read it
through at a breathless rate, leaving
no chance for criticism. -
“Henry and Katherine are staying at
Pigleigh Park when Cardinal Wolsey
and Cardinal Campeius call unex-
pectedly to tell him that the Dukes of
Norfolk, Buckingham and Suffolk, and
lots of Lords and Ladies are plotting
against him, because they object to his
plan to divorce Katherine and marry
Ann Boleyn, who arrives with her
father at that moment. A fierce argu-
ment ensues, indicated by dumb show,
of course, in which the Lord Chancellor
and the Lord Chamberlain take part.
Katherine is sent away. The tableau
ends with her farewell procession,
Henry gazing after her, Ann Boleyn
at his elbow, and Wolsey smiling
triumphantly. What do you think of
that ?”
“It ought to be effective,” I answered
discreetly, “and I wish you luck.”
An advertisement in our local paper
elicited numerous offers of help.
Daphne requested all her correspond-
ents to choose their own costumes
and bring them to the rehearsal, which
was fixed for 6.30 P.M. on the 20th.
But troubles quickly came, and in
less than a week Daphne seemed to
age from twenty-five to thirty-five.
“I wish people weren't so sensitive,”
she said, frowning. “Mr. Smith has
resigned the treasurership of the hos-
pital and won't have anything to do
with the pageant, just because I asked
him to be Henry VIII. How was I
to know he'd been married three times?
He thinks I did it on purpose. Then
Sir George insists upon being Cardinal
Wolsey, because he has a mule and
wishes to ride it; but he's so small
and stodgy that he'd look too absurd
for anything.” -
“Poor Daphne !” I said.
“That isn't the worst,” she went on
desperately. “Mr. Stone tells me he
has a funeral on Monday half-an-hour
before the pageant begins, and he can
only appear if I let him be the Cardinal's
gravedigger. It's out of the question,
and I said so. But it's MacLush the
blacksmith who's the greatest worry.
Because The Comet once described him
as being of Herculean proportions he
wants to figure as Hercules. I told
him that Hercules died quite a long
time before HENRY VIII., but he didn't
appear to believe me. I tried to com-
promise by suggesting that he should
pose as a statue of Hercules and stand
on a pedestal all the afternoon; but that
didn't seem to please him either. I
wish I'd never undertaken the wretched
business. My only hope is that the
dress-rehearsal will solve every pro-
blem.” -
But it didn't. The most succinct
comment, however, on that memorable
rehearsal at Pigleigh Park is the follow-
ing list of characters assumed by the
volunteers, few of whom would retire
because they had already paid Mr.
Barkson for their costumes:—
No Henry VIII. at all. One Cardinal
Campeius. Twelve Katherines of Ara-
gon. Five Cardinal Wolseys. Nine
Dukes of Buckingham. Twenty-five
Ann Boleyns. Four Jane Seymours
and two Katherine Parrs (assumed by
ladies who expressed surprise when in-
formed that Henry VIII. did not marry
all six wives at once). Eight Crom-
wells (five in the garb of Oliver). No
Old Ladies. One Member of the Crowd.
One Court Lady.
After a protracted debate the re-
hearsal was adjourned; but when the
village of Pigleigh was sleeping peace-
fully that night trusty men placarded
its walls with the following home-made
poster:—

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE name of Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick on a title-page
always is to me like the arrival of a welcome friend. It
revives so many pleasant memories. Nor do I ever re-
member an occasion when it prefaced serious disappoint-
ment. So if I call Karen (CoLLINs) not quite equal to its
author's best this must still be understood as leaving it an
interesting and well-written story. It is one that Mrs.
SIDGWICK tells not for the first time—but now with a
difference. The high-spirited English heroine, visiting
German friends, and capturing the most conspicuously
eligible man in the district, is a gambit that has served her
before; but instead of leaving Karen happily married to
Graf Wolfram von Hohenroda, she now begins at this
point, and continues the history through all the tragic results
brought about by racial prejudice and finally war. (I have
occasionally caught myself wondering how events since
1914 would have modified previous Sidgwickian happy-
endings. . Now I know.) You will be prepared to find in
such a theme not quite the same holiday humour that
enlivened earlier German visits; also you may find yourself
worried, as I was, by Mrs. SIDGWICK's apparent anxiety to
leave out nothing. All the instances of German brutality
that we have known during the last four years she presses
into her picture of one small community, with an uncom-
fortable effect of congestion. Not that even now she
permits resentment to blind her to the possibilities of
good. Karen's husband and poor overdriven little Mac are
characters most sympathetically drawn; while it must be
admitted that Karen herself would have been in many ways
a trial even to a family less hide-bound in arrogance than
the Hohenrodas. On the whole however I confess to a
preference for Mrs. SIDGwick before the great disillusion,
when we still pictured the Teuton as a well-meaning ab-
surdity, rather amiable than otherwise.
I should like very warmly to commend to all who are inter-
ested in art or letters Mr. CLIVE BELL's Pot-Boilers (CHATTo
AND WINDUs), a collection of (chiefly reprinted) papers on
letters, the drama and painting. I think it could be demon-
strated beyond dispute that nobody could be quite so clever,
quite so persistently right, with the rest of the world so irre-
trievably wrong, as the author. The insolence and egotism
of WHISTLER and Mr. G. B. SHAw take on a wan pallor in
the glare of Pot-Boilers. Mr. BELL's detachment from such
things as the War, which the foolish and human amongst
us are inclined to think important, is infuriating. But it is
genuine. The obsession that art, the creation of significant
form, matters more than politics or virtue or duty is, no
doubt, a passionate reaction against the common British
doctrine (denied, of course, by common British convention)
that it hardly matters at all; and it may well take such a
fanatical perversion of common values to get over to us some
notion of the provincialism and imperturbable complacency
of our long-current views about art, of the supreme snob-
bishness of our cultured and moneyed patronage of it, and
of the pretentiousness of the rapidly succeeding groups of
satellite painters revolving round a selected star which have

given so much matter for ridicule to our Philistines. Mr.
CLIVE BELL can see, can feel and can write. He has the
creative critic's very rare gift. It would take more than
the offensive egotism and sublime cocksureness of this book
to destroy its real value.
What, I wonder, is the reason for that curse of aridity
that seems inherent in fiction dealing with life upon the
stage? One would suppose the dramatic career to be at
least as full-blooded as, say, stockbroking; yet, while tales
of high finance can and frequently do hold me thrilled, I
have hardly met the theatrical story that did not stifle
all emotion beneath a dust of unreality. Something of
this defect clings to the collection of incidents which Mr.
RoDAND PERTwer has called, from their central character,
The Old Card (CASSELL), even though these enjoy the
advantage, denied to so many similar efforts, of łº,
written by one who knows his subject at first hand. The
“Card” of the title is an actor-manager of the provincial
rather than the “old” school, one who has attained a
limited fame and for-T T-
tune through long years
of touring the Number
One towns. Mr. Eli-
phalet Cardomay, as
depicted by his author,
is a character both con-
vincing and attractive;
in his gentle vanities,
his kindness, his entire
lack of genuine artistic
perception, and in the
rest of the qualities that
make up the man he
stands out as a very
real figure. The same
perhaps can hardly be
said of all the adven-
tures of which he forms
the centre. Some of
|simian bestiality which has become characteristic of the
Germans during this War. What they didn't break or
defile they just stole and carried off with them. Madame
WADDINGTON spent herself in relief work for the soldiers and
had at the same time a large part in bearing the domestic
burdens of the immediate family circle—a daughter-in-law
and two grandsons, her son having gone to the front at
once. I strongly recommend this book, which is written

Egypt would soon finish, “and then the good boys out

THE COMMANDEERING OF JOY-BElls.
[“German authorities have ordered a sup-
| plementary requisition of those church-bells
which were exempted when the first confisca-
tion was made.”—The Times.]
WHEN through Belgium (“roses, roses
All the way")your path you hacked,
Dealing death with flaming hoses
Through the towns your brutes had
sacked, - -
|Merry rang the loud carillons till the
steeples nearly cracked.
You were flush of fighting metals;
Steel and iron filled your stores;
No one commandeered your kettles,
Prised the knockers off your doors,
Or with sacrilegious purpose clamb your
belfries' holy floors.
But the stock went falling, falling—
Bronze for cannon, lead for shot—
Till the bells so sweetly calling
To the praise of “Unser Gott"
Had to mix with meaner objects in the
common melting-pot.
Stern officials wrenched the thimble
From the Frau's protesting hand,
Tore the trombone, pinched the
cymbal -
Off the plaintive German band,
And the church-bells joined the sauce-
pans to defend the Fatherland.
Now on each exempted steeple
Comes a supplemental raid;
But the thought that cheers a people
Deadly bored with hope delayed
Is that, when the lot is melted, no
more peals can well be played.
Still, in case this loss of music
Might, in triumph's apogee,
Tend to make some sausage-queue
sick,
We will do our best to see
That we give you no occasion for a
joy-bell jubilee. O. S.
THE ARMY SCH00L.
“You are going on a course,” said
the Adjutant, “at the Army School.”
“I know what that means,” said
O.C. “B” Company. “It means stand-
ing to attention for five hours every day
and having pieces bitten off your face
by a Guards' Sergeant-major. How-
ever——”
One has to say “However” in the

The thirty-mile journey to the school
took only five days, and he didn't have
to change his cattle-truck more than
fourteen times. -
He arrived at the school without any
mishap except that he was unshaven
and starving and had broken a small
blood-vessel which had been unable to
stand the strain of his efforts to humble
himself before an R.T.O.
::: ::: ::: × :
He found things were not quite as
he had expected. Their decorations in-
cluded a W.C. The instructors actually
knew the front line and they took their
war with the required pinch of humour.
“I can stick this,” said O.C. “B”
Company; “I can stick this for the
duration.”
O.C. “B” Company is running a
little to fat, and he brushes his hair
very carefully to hide a thinning spot.
Six hours' daily drill and bayonet-fight-
ing made him tired. The fact that he
had to get up at 7 A.M. and career for an
hour round the country on a strange
horse worried him. After giving the
beast an hour's steady amusement he
found himself so stiff that he had almost
to be lifted out of the saddle bow-legged,
like a lead soldier. The Major who
“took " the riding sang gently to him
to do things which he obviously couldn't
do, and he was a little annoyed that his
horse had not been long enough at the
school to do as he was told without
reference to his rider.
O.C. “B” Company hates horses.
He says they scrape you off against
walls and then look surprised about it.
He says they will go blandly over pre-
cipices to a messy death and blame you
for it because you pulled the wrong
string. He says that people who know
how to ride a horse think that all other
people also know how to ride a horse,
but that certain of them are stubbornly
determined not to do so. These they
naturally consider to be fools. The
Major in charge of the riding school
knew how to ride a horse. He con-
sidered O.C. “B” Company a fool and
cracked a ten-foot whip behind him
when he was clinging with his teeth to
the mane of a runaway cavalry charger.
After trotting without stirrups, and
jumping what he declared to be five-
barred gates, O.C. “B” Company was
so sore that he could hardly stand at
ease without bursting into tears. He
was obliged, indeed, to go to the Chief
Instructor and beg him most earnestly
to make no more jokes as it hurt him so
to laugh.
“However,” said O.C. “13 '' Com-
pany, “I can stick it.”
And then someone mentioned soccer.
O.C. “B” Company decided that he
might be able to hollole as far as the
footer field to watch the others play.
A faint uneasiness lest he might be
expected to play himself was socn swept
aside as ridiculous.
And then someone mentioned hockey.
Also he was asked his boxing weight.
Rugger, basket-ball, cross-country
running, jumping, putting the weight,
fencing, throwing the duck-board, push-
ball, lacrosse, water-polo, curling, fives
and wrestling were canvassed for.
O.C. “B” Company began to find
himself entering the Mess furtively and
starting violently if anyone spoke to
him. -
His laugh, when he said, “Haven't
played for years, you know,” lacked
heartiness. He began to slink up side.
streets when he met lusty young men
striding down the road in inadequate
shorts. He felt exactly like the wrong
sort of boy at school.
It was this feeling which induced him
to enter for the boxing. He had boxed
a little at school. . . . -
“One minute rounds,” said the Army
Gymnastic Staff seductively. “And
only three rounds altogether. It doesn't
matter how little you know of boxing...
Just for the sport of the thing. . . ."
He little knew that he was to be
butchered to make a British holiday.
The details are rather horrible. It was
like the National Sporting Club, with
the judges smoking cigars and his own
batman grinning out of a sea of khaki.
He felt very naked until they said,
“Seconds out. Time.” And then he
was conscious of nothing but that a
minute can be amazingly long. . . .
The doctor thinks that his face may
recover in time.
And then next day, after his horse
had bolted with him, gone over all the
jumps seven times just for the fun ol
the thing, and finally dropped him con-
temptuously into a puddle, he read the
following order: “All those who have
hitherto not played any games will
take part to-morrow in a tug-of-war.”
Then O.C. “B” Company did an
awful thing. In the middle of the town
square, in full view of the Commandant
and all his Staff, he deliberately walked
up to a member of the W.A.A.C. and
spoke to her.
He just said, “How do you do?” in
a very clear and audible voice, but that
was enough.
He was returned next day to his
unit, where he settled back, with a
sigh of immense relief, into the rustic
peace of the front-line trenches. But
he is, of course, a marked man.

0UR MENTAL MUNITION-MAKERS.
A CRITICAL SURVEY.
(After a well-known model.)
CASTING a retrospective eye on the
output of the Summer season and the
impact of that output on the public
mind, one is irresistibly struck by the
continued predominance of the novel.
Novels “touch the spot,” in the vital
phrase of the patent-medicine - man,
more poignantly than any other literary
form. They set up a pulpit in the
public ear whence, from the first filter-
ing of grey dawn to the last expiring
sob of the nightlight, they carry on
their unrelenting offensive on the pit of
the great heart of the million. And in
the mid-welter of Armageddon, when
the heart quits its normal ambit to in-
vade the sphere of mind, the “hearty”
writer wins in a canter.
THE BEST SELLERs of THE SUMMER.
Hence there is nothing to wonder at
in the primacy of Mr. HANLEY STAF-
FoRD, as evinced in the forty thousand
copies already sold of his Young Wife's
Tale. The house of Cashel—firm as
the rock of that ilk—is indeed to be
congratulated on a triumph which is
equally grateful and comforting to
author, publisher and “stockist.” Pos-
terity? Ah! that is another story.
But why bother about posterity? As
Sir Boy L.E. Roche said, “What has pos-
terity done for us?” Less resound-
ing but still resonant in their success
have been The Lure of the Leviathan
by ESTHER DALE and Purple Pangs by
LIONEL WooF—fine titles both of them,
with a tang of salt realism that titillates
us voluptuously. They give us full
measure too, for, as 'Swoggle remarks

While on thy face from time to time
I turn an anxious eye;
Oh, Little Dud, sing lullaby,
Sing lulla-lullaby.
So still thou sleepest, Little Dud,
Throughout the breathless night;
Almost I feel that thou art dead,
But when I think how light
A touch would wake thee into life
Most earnestly I sigh:
Oh, Little Dud, sing lullaby,
Sing lulla-lullaby.
Then slumber on ; the world is rude;
In slumber thou dost keep
Thine innocence, sweet Dud; but, oh!
How thin a veil is sleep !
Within thy form, so round and smooth,
What lurking passions lie!
Oh, Little Dud, sing lullaby,
Sing lulla-lullaby.

“OR BOTH.”
“Cold dinner l’exclaimed Frederic.
“I'm sick of cold salmon and salads
and blancmanges.”
“Cherchez la femme,” I replied.
“Not Dora again?” he groaned.
“Yes, Dora again,” I sighed.
“Why don't you give her notice?
I'd make a better cook myself.”
“Unfortunately,” I said, “I’m un-
able to give this Dora notice. I'm
speaking of the Dora who threatens
a hundred-pound fine or six months'
imprisonment, or both.”
“What is it this time 2'' asked Fred-
eric.
“Gas,” I replied.
“It's all gas,” said Frederic.
“No, it isn't,” I said. “It’s electric
light too, and shortly it will be coal. I
have had a notice from the gas com-
pany, warning me to keep a constant
watch on the gas-meter in case I exceed
the rationed allowance. If I do exceed
they must report me to the Board of
Trade, who will fine me a hundred
pounds or imprison me for six months,
or both. I've been to the gas office
and they've given me half-an-hour's
careful instruction on reading the meter,
but I don't understand it in the least.
There are three faces. On the right
one the hands always go forward like a
clock. On the middle one they always
go backward like the barometer. The
third, I believe, is neutral. But I defy
anyone to understand them. I'm sure
the gas company must be deploring its
lost opportunities now it is for the first
time awake to the utter inability of the
public to read their meters or check
their consumption of gas. I was won-
dering, dear, if you would mind if I
had the meter hung in the hall, where
the barometer is, or stood on the
dining-room mantel-piece in place of
the clock. Or I might have the coal-
cellar turned into a sitting room for me.
The meter is there already, and we shall
not want the coal-cellar for coal, as we
shall be able to keep the coal ration in
the scuttles. The only question, as far
as I can see, is which of us will go to
prison,” I continued.
“I shall, most certainly,” said Frederic
eagerly. “I am the head of the house
and as such responsible for its actions.”
“No, dear,” I said tenderly, “I must
accept responsibility for the confidence
you repose in me. I will go to prison
and you shall pay the hundred-pound
fine."
“Pardon me,” said Frederic stiffly,
“but I insist on going to prison. I
will consent to no half-measures. I will
gladly pay the hundred-pound fine on
condition of being sent to prison for
six months.”
“Frederic,” I said, “how can you be
so selfish? You know it is my turn
to go to prison. I gave way to you
about food-hoarding and obscuring
lights at dusk and everything else, and
now it is my turn. I can't help it that
they wouldn't prosecute you. My inno-
cent and quiet mind longs for the her-
mitage of a prison cell. Think of it.
No shopping, no servants, no catering,
no bacon, no lard, no cheese, no syrup,
no offal, no responsibility. Your meals
brought hot to you by a servant who can-
not give you notice. It would save my
reason, which I feel is just going when I
buy leeks and artichokes at the grocers',
and the butcher's window is full of daffo-
dils and blackberry jam ; and I bought
the marmalade yesterday at the oilshop
and the kippers from the baker. And,
Frederic,” I said, “I believe they compel
you to have a hot bath in prison, at least
I know they do in the workhouse, and I
expect it is the same in prison. There
will be no more hot baths here with the
limited gas and coal ration.”
A groan from Frederic made me
pause. The agonised expression on his
face wrung my heart. “I expect I'll
have to let you go to prison, Frederic
dear,” I said, “now that I think of the
baths. A bath you must have even if
you have to go to prison for it—you
shall go.”
The light of inspiration broke over
Frederic's face.
“Why couldn't we both go?” he
cried.
“Why not 2 " I said; “it certainly
says or both.’”

tactical situation on that part of the line
is already familiar history. But the
inspiration which prompted this bril-
liant feat has hitherto escaped pub-
licity. -
It is not known when the rite of kit
inspection was first introduced into the
British army. We suspect, however,
that the English bowmen who won
Creºy were acquainted with it, and that
it was not in view of the coming battle
but on account of an impending inspec-
tion that they protected their arms so
well during that fatal thunderstorm.
It is also well known in the army that
it was only by frequent kit inspections
that WELLINGTON maintained discipline
among his big-hearted rascals in the
Peninsula. All this may seem puzzling
to the layman, but let him know that
kit inspection as carried out in the
British army is a ceremony as painful
and embarrassing for its victims as any
ever held under the auspices of the
Spanish Inquisition.
The officer who usually conducts kit
inspection in the 7th Battalion the
Plumshire Regiment was a vivisector
in civilian life.
“There will be a kit inspection"—
so his orders ran—“in the Square at
9.30 A.M. to-morrow.”
The men of the 7th Plumshires, who
had just outfought Fritz in a bloody
rear-guard action, suddenly ceased from
their merrymaking in the estaminets of
B As the orderly sergeants went
from door to door with their warning
a dead silence settled down over the
village. The voice of the distant guns
seemed to take on a more sinister note.
Wondering what ill-tidings from the
line the sergeants had shouted the good
people of B made anxious inquiry.
Tom and Dick and Harry made the
Gaelic gesture of despair and explained,
“Inspection—no bon 1" And the kindly
natives looked even graver still. They
had known the British army for three
years.
Now the 7th Plumshires were in
particularly evil case. Save for their
arms and the clothes on their backs the
bulk of their equipment lay behind the
German lines, in the village of La
Napoo, which they had been compelled
to evacuate the previous evening.
Thither eyes began to travel furtively.
Presently some of the weaker spirits
could be seen proceeding with ostenta-
|tious aimlessness down the La Napoo
road. Later on, military policemen
were viewing with dismay the rest of
the battalion, half-armed, unofficered,
and in an obviously ugly mood, travel-
ling in rough formation in the same
direction. Believing it to be a case
of wholesale breach of discipline they
rushed back and gave the alarm.
There was no overtaking the 7th,
however. They passed swiftly through
the rear British defences and on to the
front line, much to the amazement of
those who had relieved them there some
hours before. Then they went over the
parapet, crashed through the German
elements in front and flung themselves
in silent ferocity on the village. The
garrison never had a chance. They
were not merely up against the 7th
Plumshires. Behind the Plumshires was
that which had turned the bowmen of
Crecy pale and made the stormers of
Badajos quake. In ten minutes the
village was won, just as the officers of
the 7th dashed up and took control.
The kit inspection was duly held,
with only one untoward incident. This
was when a very young soldier exhi-
bited a housewife, German pattern, in
place of that originally issued to him.

LETTERS OF A BOY SCOUT.
I.
DEAR UNCLE,--I have become a boy
scout and I have to do one good turn a
day so I write to cheer you in hospital.
Our motto is “Be Prepaired,” and
Belfitt, our petrol leader, says that if
only Lord HALDEEN had been prepaired
we could have made war on Germany
instead of Germany making war on
us which would have been a great
advantage.
A boy scout is kind to animals and I
saved the lives of a lot of wasps yester.
day which some crool boys were going
to kill. But I said, “Scouts are not
crool,” so I fixed a paper bag over the
nest and caught a lot and took them to
school, and when they were let loose in
algebra one of them stung the master
on the head so he left the room for
half an hour which shows that kind-
ness to animals pays.
Scouts never allow bad or low lang-
widge. This is kept very strict and a
tenderfoot who said his uncle had two
blast furnisses had a jug of water pored
down his neck to keep him from being
low, and some of the things he said
then would have meant a lot more
water only the jug got broke. Still you
see that it is good for manners to
be a scout, and our petrol leader says
that it would be a better world and far
more interesting if we could go about
poring water down everybody's neck
who used low langwidge.
We go rout marches every Saturday
and the petrol leader encourages our
powers of observation by giving marks
to any one who sees a thing first. A
horse counts one, a black cat two, a fat
lady three, a wounded officer four, a
goat five and so up to elefants which
score fifty only not being common they
do not score often. I should have won
the prize last week only Jenkins know-
ing the way we should march got his
two ſat aunts to stand in his garden
and scored six which was not fair. And
he got his young brother to bring a
goat, too, but the goat bit a hole in
his trousers while waiting so the young
brother give up and climbed a tree be-
cause he did not like his trousers to
be seen. I hope that you will come
here soon and then I will arange for
you to hide on Saturday afternoons so
I can score four every time I see you
and it will be very interesting for you
to know you are develupping my powers
of observation.
Every scout is expected to save and
put money in the War Lone. I am sav-
ing very hard but it is differcult because
our petrol is trying to buy a tent so we
can be prepaired for the invasion. And
it is very hard to keep up War Lone
and save for the tent. You see if an
invasion took place and we hadn't a tent
we should not be prepaired and Belfitt
says he doesn't know what would
happen. Really good tents cost forty-
five shillings carridge forward. I send
a cataloge to show the sort of tent we
think of buying as you know all about
|tents being at the War so much. All
our petrol say you are the very man
for advise. But we have only got one
and nine so far and we all lie awake at
night wondering if the invasion will
come when we are unprepaired which
makes me behind with my lessons.
Only Belfitt, our petrol leader, says
that it is quite likely that some one who
knows how we put down low langwidge
and croolty will give us a tent. He
says it is very often done by kind
people. The one in the cataloge we
want is on page 3. I have put a mark
against it so that you will know.
Your loving Nephew
JIM.
Floor-boards are 7s. 6d. extra. But
Belfitt says we can't expect any kind
person to give us floor-boards though
they would keep off roomatism which
saddens a mother's heart. If any kind
person did give them he could send
them to the Cuckoo Patrol here to our
house, carridge paid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 15th-One of the best
finds of the alien-hunting season is to
be credited to Major NEWMAN, who has
discovered a firm of naturalised Germans
manufacturing catgut and sausage-skins
at Barking. The combination suggests
horrid possibilities; but the rumour
that the firm in question was behind
the recent demand for an increase in
the dog-tax, in the hope of enlarging
the supply of raw material, lacks con-
firmation.
While all the other enemy countries
have taken power to sequestrate British
property and put British-owned busi-
nesses into liquidation Turkey had up
to the beginning of this year taken no
that we ought to reply in kind to the
enemy's peace offensive with a “terse
concrete formula.” I should have
thought Lord WIMBORNE's success in
promoting peace in Ireland was hardly
so conspicuous as to justify him in
setting up as an expert in this subject
on the larger stage of Europe.
A report that the applications for
War Savings Certificates from Scotland
compared unfavourably with those from
England and Wales distressed Mr.WATT,
who began to fear that his countrymen
were losing their well-earned reputation
for judicious economy. Happily the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER was
able to inform him that the average
sales per head in Scotland this year
were 27s. 3d, as compared with 27s.6d.
“There is no foundation whatever,”
Dr. MACNAMARA began, and for a
moment the House thought that the
hon. Member for North Somerset had
for once discovered something that was
not a mare's nest. But the next words,
“for the suggestion,” removed the illu-
sion and Mr. KING's record is still
unbroken.
When the Aliens Bill got into Com-
mittee the House resembled a Cave of
the Winds, with the difference that the
winds blew towards the CAVE and not
from it. But the HoME SECRETARY
manfully withstood the breezes. His
hardest fight was to resist the attempt
to deprive him of his discretionary
power to revoke certificates by substi-
tuting “shall” for “may " in the prin-
similar steps. This
leniency is probably
due to the character-
istic dilatoriness of the
Ottoman rather than
to any disinclination to
acquire other people's
property. The KAISER
is said to be very cross
about it, and to have
written to the new
SULTAN, offering him
the loan of LIT T L E
WILLIE to help him to
get a move on.
Members were so
busy discussing the re-
newed German offen-
sive in Champagne

gress. -

RYLAND ATKINs, who at last reminded
him that “the fretful repetition of one's
own opinion is not always equivalent
to argument.” ,
The best part of the debate turned
upon the employment of children out
of school-hours. Those distinguished
playwrights, Mr. HEMMERDE and Mr.
HARold SMITH, championed the claims
of the theatrical child to special treat-
ment. Unless caught and trained
young, he or she, it seems, is liable to
become a prey to self-consciousness, a
thing which is notoriously fatal to
success in the profession. -
Tuesday, July 16th.-In Lord CUR-
zoN's absence through illness some of
the Peers were inclined to kick up their
heels a little. But Lord CRAwford
proved to be a most effective under-
study to the Leader of the House, and,
in particular, dealt firmly with Lord
WIMBORNE, who gave it as his opinion
in England and Wales. But Mr. WATT
will not rest, I hope, until he has found
out how and why that missing three-
pence was “banged.”
The Education Bill passed its Third
Reading with many deserved compli-
ments to Mr. FISHER.
Wednesday, July 17th. — Although
very little was left of Lord WIMBORNE
after Lord CRAwford had done with
him yesterday, Lord CURzoN thought
it necessary to rise from his sick bed to
administer further castigation. Aſter
explaining the reason for his previous
absence, he added, “Nor ought I to be
here this afternoon"—the only one of
his remarks with which the writhing
victim cordially agreed.
On the question of National Ship-
yards Dr. MACNAMARA was heavily
heckled, but he got a little of his own
back when Mr. KING alleged that serious
mistakes had been made in regard to
the foundation of one of the slipways.
Nevertheless, for the sake of the country
I am glad to record the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER's reply, that the calcu-
lation is not correct, and that the exact
amount which the multi-millionaire
would save by thus cooking his accounts
is ten shillings and sixpence.

intended and none was likely to accrue
to the bloatered aristocrats of that
district.
A long and acrimonious debate on

had been expected. But Mr. PROTHERo's
review of its work was so frank and,
on the whole, so favourable that even

OF HUMPHRY, A “RUNNER."
AGAINST the old domestic duck
Some people always had a scunner,
In days before they had the luck
To grow familiar with the “runner.”
For runners forage for their needs;
They are no trial to the thrifty;
Their annual yield in eggs exceeds,
In many instances, two-fifty.
In form the penguin and the goose
Upon a smaller scale suggesting,
They really justify the use
Of such an epithet as “arresting.”
Indeed the Indian runner drake
Described in The Spectator lately
Was mentally as wide-awake
As WELLs or as Archbishop WHATELY.
'Twould need a volume to relearse
The gifts of this engaging critter,
Who with his mistress would converse
In a subdued ecstatic twitter;
Who curtsied, quacked and raised his
crest
To greet his friends, romped with the
kitten,
Paid visits on his own, a guest
By shyness utterly unsmitten;
Who with the gardener for hours
Would gravely walk behind the roller,
And, though he made too free with
flowers,
Never defied the Food-CoNTRoller.
On snails and slugs he used to fall
With fire and fury unremitting,
Consuming thirty, shells and all,
Of various sizes at a sitting.
Moreover, though from time to time
He erred, yet fortiter peccavit,
And in the manner of his crime
There always was a grace to save it.
In short, the intellect displayed
By Lesbia's overrated sparrow,
Compared with Humphry's stock-in-
trade,
Was negligible, mean and narrow.
And yet, alas! there came a day
When this incorrigible roamer
Was lured too far afield to stray
And failed for once to prove a “homer.”
Yet there is solace in the thought
That the unconscionable sinner
Who Humphry's downfall basely
wrought
Found him a tough unwholesome
dinner.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE CHINESE PUzzDE
IF I had been consulted about the
title of this play after assisting at the
first half of the introductory Act, I
should have proposed to call it “A
British Puzzle!” (repeating the authors'
note of exclamation). No visitor from
Mars descending suddenly upon a semi-
political house-party could have felt
dizzier than I did after the first bad
quarter-of-an-hour of rattled dialogue.
Out of the Stygian darkness, to which
all sorts of nationalities had contri-
buted their flashes of obscurity, there
at last emerged the salient fact that a
Chinese Ambassador and a representa-
tive of our Foreign Of-
fice were about to nego-
ciate a loan from the
Chinese Government
for the British Navy.
(You might have
thought it would more
reasonably be the other
way about, but that is
how it reached my
dazed ears).
The document em-
bodying the deal, being
of an extremely con-
fidential nature, is left
lying about in a side
room. Here it is ne-
fariously photographed
and the result con-
veyed to the Press in
time for the morning
issue. The guilty party
is a girl who is in love
with the son of the
house, and she does it
with a very natural re-
luctance, under fierce a Regulations.”
pressure from a mother | – -
who is in immediate need of ready
money to hush up an inconvenient past.
The blame falls on the girl's lover, who
is incontinently discharged from the
Government service. They marry; but
the knowledge, on her part, that she has
ruined him, and, on his part, an obses-
sive desire to prove his innocence, dis-
tract them from the full enjoyment of
their union.
After a lapse of some ten months
the Chinese Ambassador, as a tribute
to an old friendship for the man's
father, takes upon himself the guilt of
an act which he could never conceiv-
ably have committed, and prepares to
retire to Pekin, there to live in disgrace
tempered by philosophy and a sense of
incredibly heroic sacrifice.
There is an original touch in this con-
clusion, as indeed there is in most of
the things His Excellency does and
says; but for the rest—and notably
–
the handling of the plot on what one
may call its detective side—the play is
curiously amateurish. And I can give
you no idea of the haziness and
triviality of the minor characters, in
particular a precocious flapper and a
person referred to as “dear old Billy”
(he was neither dear nor old), who kept
on taking the liberty of assuming that
I was likely to be diverted by their
obscure intrusions.
I hazard the not very daring con-
jecture that Mr. LEON Lion, who wrote
the play in collaboration with Miss
MARIAN BowFR, concentrated his efforts
on the rôle of the Marquis Chi Lung,
which he played himself. And a very
attractive figure he made of this philoso-
THE RIGHT SPIRIT.
Corporal in charge (on arrival at bridge). “DE—TACHMENT, BREAK–STEP 1" -
[“When crossing a military bridge Infantry will break step.”—Extract from
pher-diplomat, who spent his time in
throwing off Oriental epigrams with a
fluency which, in spite of their apposite-
ness, savoured of preparation. It was
all very well for him (and for us so
so long as he was on the stage), but the
others had a thin time of it—Miss
ETHEL. IRVING, for instance, as the cri-
minal, though they gave her a “strong”
scene or two to catch her breath in, and
Mr. EILLE Norwood, the negociator of
the loan, who made little pretence of
taking more than a perfunctory interest
in the recitation of his lines.
To me the real “Puzzle” is the
mental condition of a certain distin-
guished critic whose unqualified eulogy
of the play persuaded me to go and
my debt to the author-actor who played
(and presumably wrote) the LEoN LION's
part. O. S.
THE OTHER TWO.
IT is my good or ill fortune to have
taken a furnished flat at a dizzy alti-
tude in the neighbourhood of the West
End London terminus which is at once
nearest the sea and the Promised Land.
Immediately above the flat is a spacious
roof, which, when the raider is not with
us, affords a pleasant retreat in the
cool of the evening, and where, at most
hours, toy dogs may be met. The flat
itself consists of a number of rooms,
the walls of which are covered with
photographs of men, women and
children almost as thickly as the
--~
pages of a school-boy's album are
covered with stamps. The men have
--- obsolete beards; several
- - - of the women seem to
. be sisters, and have
been taken together in
pairs with their heads
inclining towards each
other at an affectionate
angle. This attitude
still permits each sister
to be secretly convinced
that she is the hand-
somer. There are also
sets of children grad-
| uated like organ-pipes.
| These photographs not
only hang on the walls
but they swarm about
the mantel-pieces and
§ the occasional tables.
# The latter are so nume-
iſ rous and varied in size
that one might imagine
this a breeding estab-
lishment for them. I
suspect the place of
being also a stud farm
for cushions.
- The beginning of my
tenancy was marked by a tragedy.
The larder window having been left
open by the previous occupants, a
large slate-coloured pigeon, with plans
for a family, had made a nest inside
and laid an egg in it, and when I
suddenly opened the door was obviously
proposing to lay another. To this
I personally should have had no objec-
tion whatever; but the porter, who
was showing me round, and who has
a sense of decorum more proper to
such apartments, had other views, and
before I could interfere had removed the
egg, brushed away the nest and closed
the window. This ended his share of
the drama; but mine was to begin, for
ever since that day the pigeon, with a
see this very unequal production. But depth of reproachfulness in its eyes that
I should be ungrateful not to record is extremely distressing, has sat on the
kitchen window-sill making desperate
efforts to get in, so that I creep about
feeling like HERod. During Baby Week

it was almost unbearable. Even when
I am far from the kitchen I can hear its
plaintive cooing.
In addition to numerous other advan-
tages, such as a night porter to work
the lift, who is never visible, and a day
porter who, since I took possession, has
been forbidden by the authorities to use
the lift before two o'clock in the after-
noon, and scrupulously obeys the new
regulation except when he has to ascend
to an upper floor himself—in addition to
such advantages the flat has windows
that refuse to be lifted by any but a
Hercules, and doors (ten in all) not
one of which will remain open except
by artificial means. Whether or not
this is a peculiarity of Westminster
architecture I cannot say, but all the
doors are alike.
remorselessly close, yet so gently that
the latch does not catch, and every
breath of draught (and we by no means
stop at breaths) sways them noisily
to and fro with a sound that is irri-
tating and vexing to the nerves. One
has therefore either to go to the door
and fasten it or find something with
which to fix it open. Normally, I use
a chair or a weight from the kitchen
scales; but two of the rooms—the draw-
ing-room, where the occasional tables
and cushions are most prolific, and the
dining-room, where I do everything but
dine—are supplied with door-stops of
their own, consisting each of an ele-
phant's foot mounted with a brass han-
dle. Picture me then, the most Occi-
dental of men and less of a big-game
hunter than anyone you could imagine,
moving about this intensely sophisti-
cated flat carrying the foot of a mam-
moth of the Indian jungle or the African
forest in order to prevent a London door
from banging. And what a fate for a
noble pachyderm. Imperial Caesar's
destiny was not more incongruous.
If there were four of these feet I
might be more at ease. But there are
only two of them, and elephants are
quadrupeds. Where then are the other
two? That is the question which is
wearing me out. I lie awake at night
wondering, and then falling into an
uneasy sleep hear a heavy stumbling
tread on the stairs and wake in terror
as the door bursts open and the other

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 24, 1918.
AN EXILE IN MONACO.
(Ertract from “The Monaco Gazette” of July 16, 19–.)
YESTERDAY, in accordance with the decision of the Allied
Powers and in virtue of an agreement with the Prince of
MonAco, the Ex-KAIs ER WILHELM made his formal entry
into his allotted territory of Monaco. The ex-imperial bath-
chair was in waiting to receive him as he landed from the
- French man-of-war, Tallien ; and the military band was
there, playing patriotic music of the French and Italian
nations. The two Belgian Commissioners and their Serbian
colleagues were also in attendance to see that everything
was carried out according to plan.
The Ex-KAIs ER was much moved by these evidences of care
for his comfort and made a speech in which he dwelt upon
the glories that had illuminated the history of Monaco.
“These, however,” he said, “are not comparable in any
degree with those splendours which will be the lot of
Monaco in future, owing to the fact that Monaco has been
chosen as my residence. I trust she is fully sensible of the
new and almost overwhelming dignity.”
The Ex-KAISER then entered the bath-chair and was con-
veyed rapidly to the palace, his future residence, which he
entered. Thereupon he assumed the new and splendid
uniform which had been made for him as Regent of Monaco.
In twenty minutes he was ready and came out, calling
loudly for the Army to appear and swear allegiance to its
new War-Lord. Half the Army did promptly present itself,
but the remaining fifteen preferred to stay away. As such
a case is not provided for in the constitution it is not easy
to see what could be done. -
The Ex-KAISER looked as black as thunder, but, fifteen
soldiers having assembled, he determined not to rob them
of the speech which he had prepared for the occasion. In
this he spoke of the Army as being his support in the
stormy times that might at any moment come upon
Monaco. The soldier of Monaco must, he continued, put
aside every thought of self and think only of his Regent,
determined to obey him blindly in whatever he might
command. If the Regent ordered the soldier to shoot
his father and mother the soldier must do so without a
moment's hesitation. Hereupon fourteen members of the
Army out of the fifteen that were present immediately
resigned their position and their uniform, saying that they
would have nothing to do with such bloodthirsty sentiments.
The Ex-KAISER was furious and threatened to immure the
commander of the Army in the dungeon of the palace; but
the key could not be found, and as a matter of fact no gaoler
had for many years been appointed. : WILLIAM must be
more careful with regard to his speeches, for he is restricted
to three a day, and the Serbian representative is entrusted
with the duty of seeing that he does not exceed this
allowance.
The Ex-KAISER then proceeded to his favourite game of
choosing and dismissing Chancellors and Ministers. It is
stipulated in the treaty that the Ex-KAIsrR shall be suffered
to choose one Chancellor or two Foreign Ministers a week.
These are to be responsible for his actions and his words
during their tenure of office, and are not allowed to resign,
the proposal being that they shall allow themselves to be
harried and abused, and thus keep the Ex-KAIs ER in a moder-
ately good temper by giving him a semblance of despotic
authority. We do not envy the holders of these offices, and
in fact we do not see how this part of the treaty can be
carried out without friction. Whatever may be the case
in Germany there is no citizen of Monaco who would care
to accept so mean a position.
In the evening there was a grand Court banquet and the
Ex-KAISER made another speech.
A MOAN FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CLERK.
[A Register of Labour has been instituted on board H.M. ships,
some thousands of trades being arranged in forty-one groups.]
ALL yesterday my office door was darkened by a mob
Of men professing skill in some fantastic-sounding job;
A mulcher and a gossard, a darricker, a tout,
A pontysticker, jinney-tenter, scuppler, taker-out.
A man aged forty years at least declared he was a nipper;
Another said it was his pride to be a good dog-whipper.
Then sighed a gloomy-visaged man, “In peace-time I'm a
jollier ; " - - - -
A tº: was followed by a wuzzer and a trollier.
Said one, “You've called me sticker-in on this here blessed
form, . . . -
But really I'm a sticker up, though once I used to gorm.”
I have the honour to submit, to hospital we've sent
A feeder and a dribbler, and a kincher has been lent
For service to another ship which lost a man last week
(A pretty rotten sailor, but he knew the way to keek).
Oh, yes, and there's a man who's just deserted to the shore;
He always was a runner-off; we'll see his face no more.
My head is full of callowmen, sad ironmen, rudder boys;
Speech with a caustic finisher has stripped my life of joys;
In fact, if this strange registry goes on as it's begun,
By Peace I'll be a competent bird-scarer (see Group One).)

DEAR DADDY, -I am quite well.

So runs the latest adaptation of the field postcard which is
obtainable at Infant Welfare Centres and is now arriving at
the Front. It saves the time and paper required for letter-
writing and, besides the more intimate details, it conveys a
gratuitous little advertisement (thoroughly well deserved)
of the institution responsible for its issue. If we might
suggest an improvement it would be that a blank should be
left after “Dear,” so that Auntie and Grandad in France
might also have their postcards.
The enterprise shown by the I.W.C. will certainly not
escape the notice of other institutions which work for the
public good, and we may confidently predict that postcards
on the following lines will shortly be available for despatch-
ing to the Front:—

tracts.

“Laddie stopped to light his pipe. The match, its work
dome, glowed, warped and snapped off.” After this quota-
tion, the italics of which are my own, do you need telling
that The Anchor (CoNSTABLE) is not a story of the actual
moment? Incidentally also it illustrates that passion for
detail, relevant or otherwise, which Mr. M. T. H. SADLER
has not yet apparently quite learnt how to hold in check.
Apart however from this want of selection and a general
excess of exuberance, I have nothing but praise.for a story
whose scheme and treatment reach an unusual level of dis-
tinction. Starting with an exquisite passage from DoNNE
as text Mr. SADLER follows the spiritual development of his
hero, through sundry adventures that threaten shipwreck,
to a safe anchorage in the arms of the one woman. It is,
you may observe, a voyage that other novelists have essayed
before. Fortunately Mr. SADLER has certain gifts, sincerity,
enthusiasm, and (I venture to guess) youth, all of which he
has been able to transfer to his story, with the result of
giving it a refreshing originality. His pictures of journal-
istic London and of Berlin in the War-August read con-
vincingly genuine, though I am thankful to say that good
fortune compels me to take the latter on trust. As for the
style, that, after all, is but another symptom of youthful
enthusiasm, an incapacity to resist the lure of the startling
phrase, with such results as “The Midland train lay like a
tired redworm, leaning against the platform edge,” or the
picture of the heroine “crumbling her unresponsive bread"
(unresponsive in 1914. What must it seem to her now 2)
But when all is said these are but small and generous faults
to set off against the honesty and freshness of Mr. SADLER's
outlock.
I suspect that the title of General Foch at the Marne, by
CHARLEs LE GoFFic (DENT), owed its origin not so much
to anything that the book (a translation from the French)
itself contains as to the fact that it happened to be pub-
lished at or about the time when General Foch's name
became the centre of a certain amount of controversy,
which has now happily died down. M. LE GoFFic's book
gives us an account of the fine and confused fighting
which has since come to be known as the battle of the
Marne, but of General Foch it gives no special account,
mentioning him merely in an incidental manner like any
other General. Still, a book has a right to be judged
by what it contains, not by what it calls itself, and
therefore I owe it to M. LE GoFF1C to declare that his
battle-pictures are admirable, especially that particular one
which is concerned with the capture by the French of the
Castle of Mondement, as splendid a piece of fighting as even
this War can show. Before one of the unsuccessful attacks,
“Major de Beaufort, ardent Catholic as he was, felt the
need of commending himself and his men to God. He
called a soldier-priest, Corporal Gallard, from the ranks,
and asked him to give final absolution to such as wished to
receive it. These soldiers were Wendeans. They all fell on

their knees. . . Major de Beaufort had drawn on his white
gloves. He took one proud look at his battalion, then he
liſted his cane: “Forward for France Charge!'” And
thus did this great gentleman go to his death.
If you share my own happy memories of a volume of
country-life sketches called Through a Dartmoor Window,
you will call it cheerful news that Miss BEATRICE CHASE
has been encouraged to re-open her magic casement and
give us a companion book, The Dartmoor Window Again
(LONGMANs). I do not know that I can say anything better
of this than that it exhibits all the qualities, good and—no,
not bad, but say less good—of its fellow. Miss CHASE writes
with an almost startling fidelity to fact. Her chapter, for
example, about the visitors whom the success of the first
window-book brought to the -- -
scene of it, displays very enter-
tainingly the compensations of
popularity; while the account
of the ill-bred behaviour of cer-
tain intruders will, one gladly
thinks, be as a lash of scorpi-
ons to deserving backs. You
shall find here all the former
friends—the Rainbow Maker,
for example, Mr. Bluejacket,
and others. As before also
Miss CHAs: displays a very
palpable sympathy for the land
in which she has made her
home. If indeed Iwere to say
that her style is wholly free
from sentiment, you, remem- -
bering, would very rightly de- \\
cline to believe me; but the
impulse is always genuine;
and, if an allegory on the
banks of the Dart has for her ||
a fascination too compelling to
resist, she can at least capture
it with dexterity.

Pencil Speakings from Peking, by A. E. GRANTHAM (ALLEN
AND UNWIN) seems to me something very like a Pacifist
tract disguised as a rambling history of China. He enforces
his moral by ignoring all that is evil in the Eastern con-
ception and conduct of life, and emphasising all that is good.
About the only Western thing praised is the patriotism of
Prussia (the Prussia of the early nineteenth century, I must
in fairness add; but there is a long passage which I read as
a very subtly veiled apology for German aggression); the
only Western artists named are NIETzsche and STRAUss.

T0 IRELAND IN NEED OF A BYRON.
[The Cologne Gazette admits that Germany

their own to lead the cause of a purely Irish
movement in favour of Home Rule.]

Greece " " -
So sang the bard in Juan's story;
But who will sing the sad decease
Of your superb ancestral glory,
All that you were or might have been,
O Isle of Green, O Isle of Green 2
Anxious to take your people's part
Against the British brutes that bleed
'em,
Germany seeks a man of art
Dowered with a vocal lust for Free-
dom;
But surely Erin's bitter moan
Demands a music all her own.
And yet the harp you used to strum
Hangs mute within the halls of Tara;
The voice of minstrelsy is mum
As in the silence of Sahara;
Where is the patriot full of rhyme
To boom (in Erse) your ancient prime?
DEvLINs you have who talk in prose;
You have your dull pedestrian
HEALYs;
But none to versify the woes
Of that fair haunt of pigs and mealies,
Or galvanize with Gaelic songs
Your sense of unrequited wrongs.
You need—to biff the tyrant foe—
A tootler like the late TYRTAEUs;
You lack for inspiration's glow
To rouse the local MAccABAEU's,
To stir your passions deadly sick
Of DILLON's dismal rhetoric.
Ah! yes, for your distressful land
You badly want, just now, a BYRON
To step aloft and take his stand
In the Rotunda with his lyre on,
And swear, by Liffey's lucid waves,
You never, never shall be slaves.
Fill high the bowl with Irish stout
And pledge the quest of such a poet !
What, have your minstrels petered out 2
Has none a trumpet who can blow it?

Where is your W. B. YEATs 2

LETTERS OF A BOY SCOUT.
II.
DEAR UNCLE,--It was ripping of you
to send a tent with floor-boards. I
only sent the cataloge asking for advise.
All the scouts of our petrol sent cata-
loges to their uncles asking for advise,
and you are the only one who gave us a
tent instead.
We camped out last night waiting
for the invasion. There was no inva-
sion except of tom-cats which howled
awful. Belfitt, our petrol leader, says it
isn't croolty to throw boots at tom-cats,
because the tom-cat has a sporting spirit.
Only he didn't throw his own boots, be-
cause the leader must be always pre-
ared. One of my boots went down a
well and the pater was very stuffy about
it, though Belfitt says that the other
boot would be most useful in case I lost
a leg in the invasion, but I must be
careful to lose the right leg.
We have done a lot of good work.
We trailed a fat policeman who Belfitt
said was too fat to be a real policeman
and that it was proberble that he was a
German spy. He went round to the
back door of a public house and tapped
and a hand came forth with a pot of
beer. Belfitt says it was a signal and
obviously arranged. So he is going to
the public house disgised as an ordinary
boy, and all our funds are to be spent
on ginger-beer for him till he finds the
secret. Belfitt says he doesn't care how
much he spends if he saves England.
It is a great strain being a scout.
You see a scout has to be truthful and
honnerable and curteous to women, and
when you've got to do all at once it's
pretty tough work. For instance, Aunt
Jane asked me what I thought of her
new baby, which looks like a red pig.
So I was curteous and truthful and said
if she didn't mind I'd rather not say
what I thought about her baby and she
said I was most insulting.
We also have to smile under all cir-
cumstances and this is hard. When I
was sent to the Head because during the
preparation for the invasion I forgot my
home-work, he gave me six, and when
I smiled he said I was hardened and
defiant and gave me six more. I broke
that smile rule then and BADEN Powell,
would do the same if he got twelve.
The pater has been put Grade Three
because of bad eye-sight, and when I
asked him if he didn't feel like giving
us a trek-cart or a drum and bugels for a
thank-offering he said it had been the
dream of his life to slaughter Germans
and that his disapointment was so great
that he was blessed if he'd give a
thank-offering. Yet he came home from
the Medical Board whistling and took
the mater to a theatre.
The trek-cart I wanted him to give is
on page six of the cataloge. I know you
will be interested to see it. It would
be an awful thing if tho invasion came
and we missed it because we couldn't

you come out of hospital we could
wheel you to camp with us, and you
could tell us tales of your galant deeds,
and even if your leg was bad still when
the invasion came we could rush you
down right into the front of it. Only

Also carrying the tent and floor-boards

Small Boy (to toothless veteran). “WHAT DID You Do IN THE GREAT WAR, GRANDPA 2"
Small Girl. “S-SH !
CAN'T YOU SEE 2 HE HAD ARMY BISCUIT.”
SISTERLY ASSISTANCE.
I was talking to a very stupid man
the other day. He was the stupidest
man I have come across for many years.
It is a hard thing to say of any man,
but he appeared to me to be entirely
lacking in intellect.
It was Celia who introduced me to
him. She had rung up her brother at
the flat where he was staying, and,
finding that he was out, she gave a
message for him to the porter. It was
simply that he was to ring her up as
soon as he came in.
“Ring up who?” said the porter.
At least I suppose he did, for Celia re-
peated her name (and mine) very slowly
and distinctly.
“Mrs. who?” said the porter, or
“What ?" or “I can't hear,” or some-
thing equally foolish.
Celia then repeated our name again.
There followed a long conversation
between the two of them, the audible
part of it (that is Celia's) consisting of
my name given forth in a variety of
intonations, in the manner of one who
sings an anthem—hopefully, patheti-
cally, dramatically, despairingly.
Up to this moment I had been rather
attached to my name. True, it wants a
little explaining to shopkeepers. There
are certain consonants in it which re-
quire to be elided or swallowed or
swivelled round the glottis, in order to
give the name its proper due. But
after five or six applications the shop-
keeper grasps one's meaning.
Well, as I say, I was attached to my
name. But after listening to Celia for
five minutes I realised that there had
been some horrible mistake. People
weren't called that.
“Just wait a moment,” I said to her
rather anxiously, and I picked up the
telephone book. To my great relief I
found that Celia was right. There was
a person of that name living at my |
address.
“You’re quite right,” I said. “Go on.” |
“I wish I had married somebody
called Jones,” said Celia, looking up at
me rather reproachfully. “No, no, not
Jones,” she added hastily down the
telephone, and once more she repeated
the unhappy name.
“It isn't my fault,” I protested.
“You did have a choice; I had none.
Try spelling it. It spells all right.”
Celia tried spelling it.

nounced very distinctly down the tele- |

“Come away,” I said, seizing the
telephone; “leave it to me. Now then,”
I called to the porter. “Never mind
about the name. Just tell him to ring
And I looked at Celia
triumphantly.
“Ask him to ring up his mother,”
said the porter. *... well, Sir.”

“You’ll have to spellit,” said Celia.
“I’m going to spell it,” I shouted. -
“Are you ready?... S for—for sister.”
“Now you're going to muddle him,” |
murmured Celia.
“S for sister; have you got that? . . .
No, sister, idiot. I for idiot,” I added
quickly. “S for sister—this is another

No, two. Two anything—two more
sisters, if you like. E for—E for—”
I turned helplessly to Celia : “quick, a
word to begin with E! I've got him
moving now. E for—quick, before his
tympanum runs down.”
“Er—er ” Desperately she tried
to think.
“E for er,” I shouted.
“That'll be
certain he'll spell it with an ‘H.” Can't
you think of a better word?”

was getting interested in those sisters.
Rose, I think, will always be my

DEMOBILISATION.
Schools of INSTRUCTION.
O.B. 495/96.
September, 1925.
1. A cAsF occurred recently of an
ex-officer of His Majesty's Forces who,
on being provided with a finger-bowl
at a public dinner, committed the grave
solecism of demanding soap and a towel.
2. The prospect of the resumption of
civilian life generally, causing, as it
must, a tremendous upheaval in our
present orderly and well defined military
existence, renders it imperative that
immediate steps should be taken to pro-
vide Schools of Instruction for officers
and men in order that their difficulties
and responsibilities may be made clear
to them.
3. Our Standing Army of experts is
at present little more than the members
of the original Expeditionary Force
which crossed to France at the out-
break of the Great War. From these,
however, it is hoped that sufficient in-
structors will be available for the pur-
pose of training a large number of really
good civilians capable of freedom of
action and thought and also of acquit-
ting themselves at the table of the strict-
est observer of etiquette as if civilian
manners had ceased to be an effort.
4. These courses will be held at the
Army Schools, which are now in process
of disbandment owing to the conclusion
of hostilities (August, 1925).
Junior Courses will be held for those
who have never known adult civilian
life before the War; but officers for this
course should not be above the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel.
ARMY Schools.
The following syllabus has been ar-
ranged provisionally. Please forward
any suggestions or amendments you
have to make as soon as possible.
GENERAL course (three weeks).
Many years of impromptu ménage
in the field have considerably blurred
the finer points governing the inter-
change of conventional amenities, par-
ticularly at the table.
Special attention will be paid there-
fore to the following points during meals
(which will throughout the course of
instruction be treated as parades):—
(a) The use of the pre-war napkin.
(b) The employment of the special
knife for the butter.
(c) Circumventing the elusive green
pea with the fork proper.
(After the first three days all ranks
will be warned and the knives
sharpened.)
(d) The soup will be silent. Mous-
taches will be trimmed accordingly.
FOOD HINTS.
Students will be informed of the
different kinds of civilian foods.
A special feature of this class will be
the development of the national char-
acter by a return to the nutriment upon
which oursturdy manliness was founded.
The promiscuous partaking of the “om-
elette and café au lait ’’ will therefore
be discouraged, whilst the importance
of preserving the national custom of
making our Sunday dinner off roast beef,
brown potatoes, Yorkshire pudding,
cauliflower and apple tart, will be im-
pressed upon all.
Part of the time may be profitably
employed in giving general lessons in
food extravagance.
There will be special courses of plain
living for Staff Officers.
DEPORTMENT AND DRESS.
(a) Special lectures on the carriage
of the civilian will be given by civilians
and actors who have been unable
(through varicose veins or the necessity
of amusing the soldier on leave) to take
any part in the Great War.
(b) Dress.-Dress is a most important
item, especially for those who have
never worn adult civilian clothes.
Instruction will be given by the lead-
ing newspaper sartorial experts.
Colour Schemes.—The simple rules
governing the correct selection of shirts,
ties and socks will be explained.
How to put on Civilian Dress.-If
necessary this will be taught in squads
(by numbers) until proficiency has been
attained.
The Hut habit of dressing upwards
must be discouraged.
SIMPLE RULES FOR PEDESTRIAN
POLITENESS.
After the English rules of the road,
our national coinage and the status of
the policeman at home have been ex-
plained, the following points will receive
special attention —
(a) Raising the bowler hat with
ease and grace. This may very
well be included in the morning
parade for Swedish exercises.
(b) Practice in passing officers
without saluting. The hands will
be strapped to the sides to begin
with (except in the case of repre-
sentatives of the Dominions).
The London General Omnibus Com-
pany have already asked that the
attention of all ranks may be drawn to
the necessity for entering the bus from
behind, rather than attempting to board
the front seat as if it were a lorry.
EDUCATIONAL.
(a) A thorough grounding in civilian
English will be given, with special
attention to the pronunciation of the
alphabet, which will in future supersede
all signs, as “ack,” “pip emma,” etc.
(b) Officers and men will be required
to pass the test of ten minutes' polite
conversation without military idiom.
(c) It must be impressed upon all
that a knowledge of a foreign language
sufficient for the purchase of eggs and
chocolate will not justify an application
for a post as linguist or interpreter.
(d) Special classes for conversation
without invective will be held for Ser-
geant-Majors.
Psychological, CIAss (advanced).
Designed for those who have been a
long time divorced from any form of
civil life.
(a) The possibility of choosing
one's associates (as distinguished
from having to put up with people)
must be brought to the notice of
all.
(b) Shirkers must be instructed
that in private life “swinging the
lead " with the local doctor does
not pay (except the local doctor).
(c) Normal ideas of personal
value, suitable to their status in
the life to which they are return-
ing, will be inculcated in temporary
Staff Officers.
REFRESHER COURSES FOR MARRIED MEN.
How to live on £300 a year, instead of
£80 a fortnight's leave, i.e. the differ-
ence between Leave Income and Annual
Income explained.
Hints on general conversation at
breakfast imparted to those who have
come to regard grumpiness as essential.
Instruction on the probable effect of
military grousing if applied to the
home.
How to rough it; or the difference
between the civilian servant and the
military batman. -
Note.-Revolutionary though the idea
may seem, it must be impressed on all
Staff Officers that travelling by motor-
car is a luxury and not a necessity.

SHOULD ASK HIMSELF BEFORE LEAV-
ING THE HOUSE.

I ForgFT what we were talking about
when dinner began—it was one of those
pleasant tables where conversation is
general, and not divided until half-time
between twos and twos and then in the
second half between other twos and
twos—but needless to say that before
very long we were exchanging our views
on food. This ultimately is the most
enthralling topic of all. Plays, books,
money (and how on earth other people
get their money), dress, law-suits,
scandal, even the War—these may hold
us for a time; but food is the con-
quering theme. Our own meal was
simple and frugal enough—rationed and
couponed and all the rest of it—but our
imagination did not soar the less for
that; rather, perhaps, the more.
There were six of us—the host and
the hostess, a barrister and his wife, a
pretty girl and the insignificant person
who is now recording what occurred.
Except that the host and hostess usually
talked simultaneously and did not wait
for a silence before they began, we were now, but they are not worth eating. A
a coherent party with respect for each really plump duckling

is only too rare.

the pretty girl. “What I mean to
have is some pâté de fois gras and an
iced meringue. Nothing else at all,
except the best toast, made of course
of white bread.”
“White bread, oh, white bread ' " we
cried in unison, in a kind of groaning
despair.
“Yes, white bread, and the freshest
of butter and plenty of it.”
“And what will you drink 2" I
asked.
“Just water,” she said, with that as-
tounding unreasonableness which pretty
girls so often display.
“Water 2" I repeated dully.
“Yes, water; but it must be ver
cold. And some black coffee after.”
The barrister's wife addressed us next.
“Jack and I have worked it all out,”
she said. “We are going to begin with
salmon, with a Hollandaise sauce and
new potatoes. Then we are going to
have a duckling. One can get ducklings
“— with stuffing and peas, and then
a chocolate soufflé.”
“Chocolate l" exclaimed the pretty
girl. “I had forgotten that. I shall have
that too.”
“As well as the meringue?” I asked.
“No, instead. Or perhaps as well.
I can't decide at the moment. It re-
quires thought.” -
All this time, I ought to state, our
host and hostess had been giving us
their views; but first the pretty girl,
being pretty, naturally held our atten-
tion; and afterwards the barrister's
wife who, being a barrister's wife, had
learned to command attention. But I
was able to gather, healing through their
remarks, that our host's thoughts, both
waking and sleeping, were set upon a
sirloin with an underdone undercut. It
was to be of a redness, and horse-radish
sauce was to be its concomitant. So
far as I could ascertain our hostess was
longing once again for bread sauce, and
that naturally involved the death of a
chicken.

A BREACH of THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT.
“AM I To UNDERSTAND, SERGEANT-MAJOR, THAT THESE Boys were CAUGHT Robbing MY ORCHARD?”
“YES, SIR. AND To THINK THAT ALL THESE weeks I've BEEN TEACHING 'EM TO TAKE COVER, SIR."
“And we shall drink champagne,”
the barrister's wife continued. “I don't
like champagne, but on such an occa-
sion, yes. And then some very good
black coffee—coffee for eight in cups
for two, you know—and a cigarette. I
haven't smoked for a long time, but I
shall smoke then.”
She leaned back with such an air of
triumph as might almost have followed
the meal itself, instead of its mere
scenario.
“I’ve got it all right, haven't I,
Jack 2" she asked her husband. “You
see,” she added to us, “we often talk
about it.”
“I’m not sure,” he said. “I’ve been
wondering about one or two things.
I'm doubtful whether turbot with a
Mousseline sauce wouldn't be a better
choice, after all. A finny bit, all
gelatinous.”
“Don't!" we exclaimed again in uni-
son and agony. “Don't!”
“And I've substituted canard d la
presse for the roast duckling.”
“Oh, yes,” our hostess cried, “of
course—canard a la presse. We must
have that too, George.”
But George was adamant. “No,”
he said, “red undercut of roast beef for
me—that is what I miss most now—
with horse-radish sauce and baked po-
tatoes. The horse-radish sauce really
well made, not scamped.”
“Then I must have the canard d la
presse alone,” said his wife, pouting.
“Never mind,” I said, “you'll be
able to have too much.”
“No,” she replied; “you dine with
us and help me to eat it.”
“Impossible,” I said, “because my
programme is wholly different. I am
intending to confine myself to roast
saddle of mutton, of which, when I have
had a good deal, I shall have more. It
will be accompanied by the best claret

temperature, and followed by - 1
Here the pretty girl, who had com-

“Good,” I replied; “ and fol-

smoke a very long and costly cigar.”
“What, no sweets?” the pretty girl
inquired.
“Certainly not,” I said; “the claret
will be too good.”
She made a face, but was still pretty.
“By the way,” said our host, “doesn't
anyone want oysters?”
“Good heavens !” exclaimed the bar-
rister, “I had forgotten them.”
And so we had to begin again and
revise Qur menus; all but the pretty
girl, who hates oysters as other people
hate rhubarb. “Like eating bad
pennies,” she remarked.
But I have reported enough, or pos-

then, the signal being given, the ladies
rose to leave. But on their passage to
the door our host stopped them.
“By the way,” he said, looking at
his watch and making a rapid calcula-
tion, “it might interest you to know
that while we have been sitting here
and talking and eating, the War has
been going on for an hour and a-half,
at a cost to Great Britain alone of some-
thing over £400,000."
Not very tactful, was it?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 22nd.—The demand
for a single authority to control enemy
aliens will be strengthened by tworeplies
given this afternoon. Satisfaction at
the announcement that a certain enemy-
owned business had been wound up
and sold to a gentleman with the emin-

little dashed by Sir ALBERT STANLEY's

Government had not yet made up their

to cause no sort of excitement; prob-
ably because the ladies are confident

watching the progress of the Bill,
which they regarded as the first mea-
sure of reconstruction.
Lord CRAwFoRD's outward appear-
ance hardly suggests that his latest
hobby is poking into dustbins, but it is
so; and his investigations lead him to
the conclusion that the British public
is again guilty of bread-wasting.
Twice this week Mr. BURNs has
broken his self-imposed silence in order
to talk about gas and the nefarious con-
duct of the Companies in trying to in-
crease their statutory charges. His first
speech was harmless enough, though it
did not carry the House with it; but the
second brought him into sharp collision
with the SPEAKER. Some years ago
the Member for BATTERSEA said of cer-
tain newspapers that they were “owned
by blackguards, edited by ruffians and
read by fools.” He was so pleased with
his phrase that he repeated it more than
once. To-night he essayed to use it
again; but the SPEAKER, though he had
passed it on the first occasion, now
thought it “disorderly, unparliamentary
and unprovoked,” and insisted upon its
withdrawal.
Thursday, July 25th.-Hitherto the
new CHIEF SECRETARY has had a com-
paratively easy time in the House, for
Mr. KING and Mr. MoRRELL, who have
been doing their little best to keep Irish
affairs to the front, lack the special
knowledge and the determination to
drive their questions home. But now
Mr. ShortT was called upon to with-
stand the concerted attacks of men
who used to be past masters in the
game of pinpricks. Possibly three
months' absence from Westminster has
made them a little rusty, or it may be
that the atmosphere of the House is
no longer favourable; but anyhow the
CHIEF SECRETARY kept up his end very
well, and indeed seemed to be quietly
amused at the whole proceedings.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE TITLE.”
IF I emphasise the fact that Mr.
ARNoLD BENNETT's little joke, seasoned
with a lively wit free from malice, on
the ever-fresh subject of Honours Lists
has the defects of its excellent qualities,
I do it of course in the interests of a
professional reputation for nice dis-
cernment. Its very air of spontaneity
marks it as written with a racing pen.
I fear a few tired jests do make their
appearance, including the pale ghost of
one that, faintly improper, crossed the
bars some seasons ago; but as a whole
The Title is a first-class rag, and when
we were not laughing outright we were
smiling, which is even better.
Arthur Culver, comptroller
of accounts, pattern type of
public-spiritedman of business,
has the strongest views on the
honours question and the usual
stock of honest forthright criti-
cisms of “The Government"
—any Government. The real
business of a Ministry, it would
seem, is not to govern (even
in war-time), nor directly to
win the War, but to live. It
is in constant danger of death,
and needs, for its elicir vitae, a
compound of jobs and titles
applied externally. If the dan-
ger be particularly acute the
Honours List is more than
usually full of profiteering
scallawags and third-rae wire-
pullers. But even the worst
list has to be salted with a
few really respectable names.
And he, Arthur Culver, is in-
vited to be a part of the exigu-
ous salt ration in a peculiarly
long and unsavoury New Year's List,
And he is resolute to refuse the proffered
baronetcy.
His son John, who, inspired by his
prowess in the school debating society,
is for a political career, and strongly
disapproves of the hereditary principle,
stands with the father. So does his
sister, Hildegarde, who, indeed, unknown
to the family, is the author (pseudonym
of “Sampson Straight”) of some very
trenchant articles—in a paper owned by
the purely apochryphal nephew of three
(no doubt, equally apochryphal) titled
newspaper proprietors—on the subject
of the traffic in honours. But there is
a Mrs. Culver, a perfect dear and as
clever as they make 'em (which is very
clever), with the adroitest little finger
in all Mayfair. Culver daren't tell her
till he has drawn her into an impas-
sioned denunciation of all and sundry
titles bestowed by corrupt Governments.
If he supposed he had cleared his path
this way he was a most sanguine man.
You had only to look at Mrs. Arthur
to see that she meant her denunciation
to apply only to titles for other people.
As to her Arthur, hadn't he got to win
the War, and wasn't it won by accounts,
and didn't he control them 2 And—
and she did so wish to be called
“Milady,” to hear the actual parlour.
maid actually call her “Milady.”
Culver being a man of principle, there
is a rumpus—an arch-rumpus, running
to different sleeping arrangements and
things not ever being the same again.
For Mrs. Arthur roused is a Hun, out
for victory, not the game. As to who
won and how, I forbear to tell. The
match is extraordinarily worth while

going to see. I don't like Mr. BENNETT's
diabolus ea machiná in the shape of the
ex-convict, Sampson Straight (and I am
sure that a joke about Sampson crooked
which fell like a dud in mud ought to
be cut), but I suppose the author felt
that, as he had so heavily overdrawn
his indictment against the Honours
List, he must effect a purely bizarre
solution for the sake of balance.
Mr. AUBREY SMITH and Miss Eva
MooRE together, as the devoted pair of
middle-aged lovers, gave us a fine ex-
hibition of technical skill reinforced by
the quality of personality. Rarely can
either of them have been more happily
cast or in better fettle.

withal, a delicacy in Miss Eva Moore's

Remember that la donna & mobile, and
that even strong women can weep like

you are not a penny-a-liner, for the rate

Though I have been writing for the
best papers for thirty years I often stay
awake all night thinking over the ex-
ordium of a Daily Flail article. But
it is worth the sacrifice. Remember
that MILTON only got five pounds, not
º for writing the whole of Para-
ise Lost, and try to think what he
would have got if he had lived to-day,
written it in prose and submitted it as
a series of articles to the Editor of The
Daily Flail. Think, too, of the enorm-
ously wider appeal he would have made
—e.g. the effect of his work on flappers.

been getting truer and truer ever since Your Majesty has
deigned to interest himself more closely in our doings on
the Western Front.
The K. Ha! I thought so. What means then this per-
sistent rumour of a German retreat across the Marne 2
H. What do you say, LUDENDoRFF 2
L. I say that it is not worthy of the slightest attention.
Here is the latest bulletin, which I was just about to sub-
mit to Your Majesty. Perhaps Your Majesty will be good
enough to read it 2
The K. Yes, yes, let me have it. (Takes it and reads)
“Yesterday was a day of brilliant victories for our brave
troops. All the enemies' counter-attacks broke down with
sanguinary losses before they could develop. Manoeuvring
according to a plan long settled we lured the enemy
into Château Thierry and there annihilated him. Advanc-
ing vigorously from the South to the North we crossed
the river Marne with complete success, thus foiling the
enemy But I say, is that right? I thought we
were moving from north to south 2
H. What do you say, LUDENDoRFF 2
L. I say that it is quite right. Tactically we are moving
from south to north, but strategically we are moving from
north to south ; that is the difference between the French
and ourselves. We allow them now and then to win a
skirmish tactically, in order that we may win a campaign
strategically. -
The K. Oh, I see. Then I suppose I am to assume that
any French victories do not count because they are tactical?
H. What do you say, LUDENDoRFF 2
L. I say as I am bound to say that His Majesty is quite
right, and I say further that His Majesty shows a wonder-
ful grasp of the principles on which war is conducted.
II. I agree entirely. If all were like His Majesty on
this point the War would very soon be over.
The K. But this system of fighting must not last too
long; it would be unwise to lure them too far.
L. That is all provided for, your Majesty. There comes a
moment when the strategic and the tactical are combined
into one. -
The K. How do you know when that moment has come?
H. What do you say, LUDENDoRFF 2
L. That is my secret.
The K. Well, I hope your secret will have satisfactory
results when it is put into action, for, according to our
expectations, we ought to have been in Paris by now, and
here we are as far away as ever. -
L. If Your Majesty is dissatisfied with the manner in
which the campaign is conducted I can easily resign.
H. And I can say ditto to LUDENDoRFF.
The K. Come, come, don't let us quarrel; you know you
can always resign tactically and keep your positions strate-
gically.
H. What do you say, LUDENDoRFF 2
L. I say that we will say no more about it.
The K. Very good; I will now go and make a speech to
our storm-troops. -

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
So deserved a popularity was attained by a little book of
letters called A Hilltop on the Marne that it is hardly sur-
prising that “persistent and sympathetic demands for news
of us after the battle” have impelled Miss MILDRED ALDRICH
to collect a further series under the title of On the Edge of
the War Zone (CoNSTABLE). For the benefit of those who
missed the earlier volume I may explain that Miss ALDRICH
is an American lady, who in June, 1914, settled down in a
charming old house (you can see it drawn in the new book)
overlooking the Marne, with the pleasant intention of leading
a life of literary rusticity. You may imagine that her actual
experiences have been somewhat different. The earlier
letters, written to a friend in America, carried events as far
as the first victory of the Marne; these present continue the
story for the two and a-half years following. They give a
picture of peace in the midst of war that is both fascinating
and strange. Miss ALDRICH is careful to describe herself
as no longer young (in reality she quite obviously possesses
the eternal youth of all brave and kind and humorous
ladies); and her account of a life spent, almost alone, in
quiet gardening, jam-making, mothering pleasant young
French officers who were billeted at La Creste, and between
whiles stepping out upon her hill-side lawn to glance (as it
were casually) at a battle—these things furnish a picture
as odd as it is attractive. The writer makes no attempt
at a serious history of events—she was perhaps too near to
them for that—though her letters contain at least two facts,
or rumours, that were startlingly new to me; but as an
intimate sketch of one corner of the world-war, viewed at
close quarters over a garden hedge, these little books will
have earned for themselves a place apart.
Whether you regard Little Miss Muffet (DUCKworth) as
a somewhat amateurish and indifferently written novel or
as a penetrating study of a certain type of feminine tempera-
ment, will depend, I suppose, upon your angle of vision.
For my own part it kept me in an alternation of moods.
Now I would be almost angrily put off by ELIZABETH
KIRBY's too frequent asides, her appeals to the reader, and
generally the Victorian manner of her nods and becks and
wreathed smiles; and again something in the very ingenu-
ousness of her tale would convince me of its honesty. The
plot could hardly be more simple. Miss Muffet (there you
are, at the very beginning—how could one's interest not be
handicapped by such a name?) is a young woman who sets
out to pursue fame and fortune as a writer; falls in with
two male pursuers whose intentions towards her are strictly
dishonourable; has a nervous break-down, and eventually
marries the doctor. Behold all. Yet however you may
think, with me, that the author's experience of literary
society must have been exceptionally unfortunate, and
however much you may be tempted to mock at her over-
emphasis, there remains a disturbing truth about her

picture of the lonely girl, demanding youth's heritage of
pleasure, and drifting almost to ruin for no better reason
than that of boredom. But, having said so much, I desire
that nothing in this tribute shall be taken as implying any
belief in the two literary villains of the author's drama.
They are, and remain to the end, scarecrows of most
palpable straw.
Mr. BELFoRT BAx's Reminiscences (ALLEN AND UN win) is
not what you would call everybody's book and even a
student of politics is likely to fall to wondering how so
interesting and forceful a personality should so nearly have
achieved dulness. Partly due this, I fancy, to a charming
habit of not obtruding his ego. In fact his egotism takes
the shape of prejudice. He can't be fair to opponents; to
the Nonconformist ascetic jingo, for instance, with mining
shares and a stake in war (I confess I was unaware of the
existence of this as a type). Nor is he fair when he attri-
butes to “the terror of the rich " the increase of the Mansion
did so stand out, and this was due as much to the extra-
ordinary charm of his personality, I think, as to his record-
making feats of battle in the air. His history and quoted
letters show him to have been in action an expert exter-
minator of Huns, terrible and fearless, and yet at leisure a
normal, straight, entirely unaffected and perfectly natural
boy, at once tremendously serious and cheerfully incon-
sequent. He is in himself the type of all the best that is
in the B.E.F. The book is based upon his own letters, and
is written by Messrs. WALTER A. BRIscoe and H. Russell,
STANNARD, with a foreword by an eminent statesman, and
appreciations by certain distinguished officers. I trust that
I shall be neither prosecuted nor courtmartialed if I say
that these gentlemen, with their testimonials and all,
do their unconscious best to spoil the impression of the
reader, and only one thing saves the book from failure, the
spirit of BALL himself, shining always through his simple
letters and not to be extinguished by a flood of superlatives
and portly phrases.

our vigorous author's atti-

is the record of Mr. BAx's

sympathetic may chortle over the fact that friends of
humanity have their full share of the individualist weak-
messes of spleen and petty spite. But it is a pleasure to
record that the author is a passionate defender of the
justice of the Allies' Cause in the War. By the way, as
Mr. BAx is very severe on loose thinking, I venture to
point out to him a startling non-sequitur on page 273, d.

this War, or, if you prefer the plainer term, of one of our
“absolute toppers.” British officers, old army or new,
regular or irregular, territorial or aerial, are not as a class
unpleasant fellows, lacking in vitality, gaiety and courage;
self-satisfaction and self-assertion and a passion for self-
protection are not their main characteristics. Moreover, it
is fair to say that, if every one of them at the fighting front
who ought to have received the D.S.O. or the M.C. had
done so, all would have both, and most would have the W.C.
too. Consequently they are such that a man must have a

In a preface to Gentlemen-at-Arms (HEINEMANN) “CEN.
TURion '' informs us that “The writer makes no claims—
and possesses none—to be considered a writer of fiction.”
At the risk of being rude I am compelled to disagree with
him. The majority of these tales are based on actual inci-
dents of the War, but the best of them are the two imagina.
tive chapters called “The Husbandmen.” Here the author
compares favourably with Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts at the
top of his form. The War-stories, some of them almost in-
tolerably grim, are unequal in merit; but when “CENTURION"
does get home he gets right there; and he is helped along
his way by an admirable economy of words. He knows
what he is writing about and he can write. And you are
not to miss “The Husbandmen.”

- “ACCORDING TO PLAN.”
To THE GERMAN PEOPLE FROM THE HIGH CoMMAND.
CIVILIANs there lies in the virtue
Of patience an infinite balm;
No rumour of horrors can hurt you
If only you smile and are calm ;
Though you find us apparently waiving
The offensive we lately began,
Bear up; we are simply behaving
According to plan.
Did you suffer a pain in your liver
When you saw some invincible corps,
After gallantly crossing a river,
Resume the original shore?
'Twas a mere reconnoitring excursion;
We went and we saw and we ran ; , ,
Yes, we did it (including immersion)
According to plan.
In those very identical regions
That sunder the Marne from the Aisne
We advanced to the rear with our legions
Long ago and have done it again ;
Fools murmur of errors committed,
But every intelligent man
Has accepted the view that we flitted
According to plan.
If you doubt our traditional fitness
For hacking our way in the West,
Château-Thierry may serve as a witness
That our culture is still of the best :
For our Prussians made hay of its treasure
(As only a gentleman can
Whose duty is one with his pleasure)
According to plan.
With feats such as these to inspire you,
Don't talk of the turn of the tide;
With the fame of our record to fire you,
Let patience be sister to pride;
Though the look of affairs be misleading
(Like your bread, which appears to be bran),
Rest assured we are always proceeding
According to plan. O. S.
WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
- THE JONAH.
His name was Albert and he joined the ship as a deck-
hand in place of one of the crew who, seeing a petty-officer
of the ex-R.N.A.S. in amiable conversation with a sergeant
of the ex-R.F.C., had taken an unauthorised extension of
shore leave under the impression that the War was over.
The Second-Engineer said afterwards that he suspected
Albert of being a Jonah as soon as ever he noticed the
downward droop of his moustache-ends. He says that
somehow or other you can always tell Jonahs like that. It
seems there's nothing like a moustache for bringing good or
bad luck. A cheerful moustache, he says, is as good as a
depth-charge aboard any ship, but a drooper is fatal. There
was certainly something horribly depressing about Albert's.
It was impossible to look at it without thinking about tor-
pedoes and submerged mines. It cast a gloom over the
whole ship's company. - -
On that trip misfortune dogged our trawler's footsteps
(in a manner of speaking) from the first. We had to go to
sea in the teeth of a stiff gale from the nor'-east; the first
day out the steward slipped down the cabin steps, squan-
dering a tin of delectable soup into the skipper's sea-boots
before our famished eyes; and the same evening it was dis-
covered that the monthly issue of tobacco had not come
aboard, and we were faced with the prospect of ten days at
sea with scarcely enough to provide a smoke-screen capable
of obscuring the German Mercantile Marine. The crew
passed some very unpleasant remarks.
“It's that new deck-hand,” declared the Second-
Engineer. “Look at his bloomin' whiskers; did ever you
see the word ‘Jonah' writ plainer on any object in your
life? If he had any proper feeling he'd either shave 'em
off altogether or else twist 'em up a bit more lively-like.
|The ship hasn't a fair chance with a cargo like that aboard.”
“It ain't no Jonah,” protested Albert indignantly. “I've
had the same whiskers all my life and they've never
brought no bad luck. Do you think I'd have 'em a-sticking
up like that Kaiser BILL and my own brother-in-law been
fired on in an open boat 2 Not if I knows it.”
But the crew muttered ominously.
One evening at dusk we were having a peaceful game of
cards down in the cabin. The Skipper, whose luck had
been out, had just triumphantly declared his intention of
going “Nap,” when sounds of excitement were heard from
the watch on deck. -
“Fritz ahoy!” someone shouted down the companion-way.
I always like to think that when the news of the Armada's
coming was announced to DRAKE on the bowling-green at
Plymouth the gallant Admiral had a little wager on the
game and stood in a winning position. Unfortunately for
the Skipper, U-boat tactics do not allow of the little delays
that were possible in the more spacious days. We dropped
our cards and rushed to action stations.
When I had got the news away to the base I sat in my
wireless cabin listening to the gun hard at it and smoking
a cigarette in careless bravado. After a while the noise
ceased and I considered I might venture on deck for a look-
see. Albert was leaning dejectedly against the mast.
“Have we sunk him 2 " I asked eagerly. -
“It wasn't no sub,” he replied; “it was only a boundary
buoy they mistook for a conning tower.”
Away aft the skipper was saying bitter things about a
hand of Ace, King, Queen and two more trumps he had been
prevented from playing, and from the bridge came sounds
strongly reminiscent of a scythe being sharpened. I think
it was the Lieutenant gnashing his teeth.
The final blow came when we were ordered to remain at
sea three days beyond our lawful period of patrol. The
crew were in a state of almost open mutiny. I quite ex-
pected that some morning would find Albert missing and
yet another dark mystery added to the long tale of ocean
tragedies.
The day we eventually came into dock the Lieutenant
sent for him on deck. He had a razor in his hand, and
I closed my eyes in horror. -
“Take this,” said the Lieutenant grimly, handing him
the razor. “Now, go down the fo'c'stle and remove that
moustache. If you leave enough hair on your face to trip up
a weevil your name goes down in the Commander's Report.”
Silently but with tears in his eyes Albert withdrew.
We passed through the jetty, and as we were coming
to our moorings an ex-mate of the ship, who was seated
on a bollard smoking his pipe, hailed us. - " -
“What cheer, Skips?” he called out to the Captain.
“I see you're on the list for dry dock this time in, and ten
days' leave for all hands.”
In the enraptured silence that followed this joyful an-
nouncement, Albert, looking the very picture of misery and
shame, emerged from the fo'c'stle. His countenance was
as innocent of moustache as the surface of a new-laid egg.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS FOR POULTRY KEEPERS.
(By our Scientific Expert.)
DURING the present month many
fowls drop into grump, especially broody
hens. Food should be given sparingly
until grumping is in full swing, and all
rich and stimulating food should be
omitted, such as fresh-water mussels,
eels, crayfish, whelks, sardines or short-
bread. Green food should be provided
in abundance, especially green peas,
which are now plentiful; they assist the
feather-growth, which is a great drain
on the hen's constitution but an essen-
tial factor in its well-being, for, as the old
proverb says, “A hen without a feather
is like a boot without leather.” Bombay
ducks are especially liable to grump, and
a valuable preventive in their case is
a little clam chowder dusted in sulphur
mash, with a dash of ammoniated quin-
ine. The treatment is as follows: Spray
the gills every hour with warm rum and
milk and rub a little radium on the
nostril. Also give either “Grumpo"
pills or powder in guava jelly night and
morning. In acute cases isolation is
absolutely necessary.
The poultry-house should be lit
preferably with acetylene gas at night,
as the delicate odour of garlic in this
illuminant is much relished by ban-
tams, cockerels, pickerels, pangofflins,
porbeagles and other heavy layers. The
needs of runner ducks must be carefully
studied, as they are liable to be alarmed
by a strong artificial light. Smoked-glass
spectacles, which can be procured at
10s. 6d. a pair from any good optician,
are indispensable, as inflammation of
the eye, if not promptly dealt with,
passes rapidly to the mesenteric tract
and exacerbates the solar plexus. At this
stage hot fomentations of hydrochloric
acid sometimes effect a cure; but it is
perhaps safer to blow up the bird with a
small dynamite charge, and saturate the
infected area with tincture of cinnamon.
Some strains which are immune from
grump suffer from migraine, Spanish
influenza and botulism. Buff Orping-
tons, for example, are curiously botul-
istic in their diathesis, but if properly
fed and housed in hygienic conditions
they enjoy a remarkable freedom from
these troubles. . The formula for air
space may be crudely expressed by say-
ing that in the perfect poultry-house
the cube root of the hypotenuse should
never exceed the º of the rotat-
ing focus, otherwise disaster is sure
to supervene. All poultry-houses should
have a continual supply of pure air,
not draught. The open-air treatment
for fowls of every age is now recom-
mended by all aviculturists. Revolving
shelters, with electrically-driven fans
in the hot weather, demand a certain
initial outlay, but they work wonders
with backward bantams. The main
poultry-house should be open in front
with a plate-glass wind-screen and a
buffet for light refreshments at either
end. The walls should be of encaustic
tiles. - -
Imperfect voice-productionin roosters
can be remedied by the employment
of model crowing records periodically
emitted by a gramophone. Fowls are
essentially imitative and amenable to
discipline. Cruelty to ugly ducklings
should be vigorously suppressed and in
every way an atmosphere of cordiality
and mutual good - will encouraged.
Prizes for good conduct, regular laying
and lustre of plumage should be insti-
tuted, and suitable decorations awarded
to the winners. In this way the
friendly co-operation of poultry and
their keepers can be materially pro-
moted, and the satisfactory solution of
the problem of food-supply reconciled
with the dictates of an enlightened
humanitarianism.

upon him by the Government's plough-
ing activity early in the year and recent
vacillations concerning the value of
crops, to do the work of three men and
so be ready for the harvest. There
have, it is true, been placards on the
walls and lectures have now and then
been delivered; but the yokel mind
moves slowly. Fortunately, however,
the yokel eye is quick, and this is the
Propagandist's chance.
We understand that the new measure
proceeds from the report of a roving
Commissioner in an agricultural dis-
trict, who wrote as follows: “I have
been much struck by certain wasted
opportunities for influencing rural opin-
ion against the Hun, and in particular
the Arch Hun. Never before have I
seen so many scarecrows in the fields,
and never scarecrows so badly con-
structed. Surely it would not be too
difficult to set up a factory where scare-
crows (or boggarts, as they are called
in some places) could be made in large
numbers in the likeness of the KAIs ER.
These, if supplied free to farmers, would
serve the double purpose of frightening
the birds and perpetually reminding the
country people of the deplorable per-
sonality of our enemy; and since a
scarecrow is one of the lowest terms
that can be applied to a human being
a healthy contempt for everything Ger-
man would be fostered."
It is the task of translating this
admirable suggestion into fact that
(unless, as we say, rumour is a lying
jade) has made all the O.B.E.'s in the
Propaganda Department so busy just
now. Heaven help their enterprise !

[A high authority has pronounced that D.O.R.A. will automatically
expire at the close of the War. The following memorial verses māy
seem a little premature, but Mr. Punch, forestalling his contemporaries,
who keep reams of memorial matter ready pigeon-holed against the
decease of distinguished personages, proposes to publish these lines at
once as an example to the nation of perfect readiness for Peace.]
WEEP, weep, O England, and from shore to shore
Let the loud bells their crude carillons cease,
For she that did resist all storms of War
Lies stricken in the very hour of Peace.
Now all our songs are silent, and no wonder,
For poor old Dora has at last gone under.
Bring ye no cypresses nor yew-leaves dark;
Only with palm shall Dora's pyre be stacked;
For lo! it seems superfluous to remark
The Realm she loved is happily intact;
Ah, sorry ſatel she only lived to win, - * * * *
And it was victory that did her in.
Not oſt in history, when Great Ones pass, -
Does all their life-work perish with themselves;
The humblest bard must wither like the grass,
But leaves his legacy on someone's shelves;
And Dora's work was admirable, but
She kicked the bucket and it all went phut.
For hark, what laughter jars upon our pain
Now that the gaols eject into the sun
Bosch, Pacifist, Objector and Sinn Fein,
And the best work of Dora is undone;
While all acknowledge, as they dry the tear,
It is less difficult to purchase beer.
Hark, in the clubs, how everybody knows
The secret mysteries that used to be,
While rapturous Editors unscathed disclose
That England too had submarines at sea,
And Correspondents are no more confined
To vivid pictures of the way they dined.
The lights begin to twinkle from the bars;
The slow moon climbs, but no one cares a blow;
Men ride in most unnecessary cars
And reckless quaff two whiskies at a go;
Life without Dora, love itself seems drab,
And one may whistle for a taxi-cab.
Yet shall she live in patriotic minds;
Haply at even, when, the church-bells boom,
Will old men start and guiltily draw the blinds
And snap the lights out in the dining room;
Will speak of Dora when their sons demur:
“It was her wish; I do it, lad, for her.”
* -
Haply munitioners will tell the tale
Of the old days, the piping times of war,
And humourists and profiteers bewail
The trench-jokes dead, the surpluses no more;
Shall say, “Old Dora would have sympathised;
'Twas Peace that killed her—and I'm not surprised.”
And how commend her? for she used to seek
No people's flattery, no vulgar pars. ;
We did not see her picture week by week,
With notes about her war-work at bazaars;
This be the praise no caviller can rob,
“She wore no chevrons, but she did her job."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 29th.-The more strait-
laced Peers were a little shocked at the
spectacle of Lord LANSDown E, hitherto
regarded by them as a pattern of pro-
priety, introducing a Bill to re-establish
lotteries. It seems that the Red Cross
Society has lately come into the posses-
sion of some three thousand pearls, pre-
sented by a multitude of distinguished
donors, and of a solitary pig, the gift
of an allotment-holder to Her Majesty
the QUEEN (his Lordship, despite a re-
cent experience, still persists in putting
pearls before swine); and it is assured
that the only effective way of turning
these treasures into cash is to
raffle them. But that, though
it is done every day, is illegal.
Hence the Bill, which received
a Second Reading, despite an
animated protest from His
Grace of CANTERBURY. But I
tremble for its fate if it ever
reaches the other House. As
Hon. Secretary of the Anti-
Gambling League Mr. Hogg|E
will have all his bristles out.
Colonel THORNE, as a repre-
sentative gas-worker, implored
the Ministry of Munitions not
to encourage the employment
of women in retort houses; the
work, he averred, was not suit-
able for them. But Mr. KEL-
LAWAY assured him that he was
mistaken; under certain con-
ditions women were most suc-
cessful in retort work. As Mr.
KELLAway is a married man,
while the Colon EL, I gather
from Debrett, is still a gay
young bachelor, I am backing
Mr. KELLAway.
Not content with Mr. BonAR
why a General or an Admiral could not
go about in a small car? Nobody could
think of an answer to this pertinent
question.
If Mr. DILLON got a chilly reception
for his indictment of the Government
he had only himself to blame. You
can't desert the House of Commons for
three months and expect it at once to
take you to its bosom on your return; and
if your wooing is conducted in alternate
wails and whispers it is still less likely
to be effective. The Nationalist leader
had to be content with the punctual
applause of his faithful followers, the
silent approval of Lord WIMBorn E in
the Peers' Gallery, and the bright green
LAw's assurance that the whole ques-
tion of the use of motor-cars by Public plain truths about themselves. In
Departments was under inquiry, Mr. vain Mr. DEVLIN endeavoured by rasp-
HoustoN asked for an immediate pro-
hibition of the use of large cars in Lon-stroke. Smiling and implacable Mr.

socks of which Mr. Roch, sitting exactly
opposite, made prominent and sympa-
thetic display. Almost the only passage
in his speech which evoked general ap-
proval was his tribute to the patriotic
services of his predecessor; and even
that, I fear, suggested unfavourable
comparisons.
There was very little left of the mo-
tion aſter Mr. SHORTT had done with
it. For years past the House has been
so much accustomed to seeing the
Nationalist Party kowtowed to by
statesmen on both sides that it was
almost as much delighted as surprised
to hear the new CHIEF SECRETARY-an
avowed and unrepentant Home Ruler

MR. DILLON RECEIVES A SHORTT Hook.

SHORTT rubbed in his points—that they
had made no effort to turn the Home
Rule Act into a practicable measure;
that, instead of denouncing Sinn Fein,
they had followed its lead; that they had
attacked the Irish Executive when they
should have supported it, and by their
refusal to help recruiting had forfeited
the sympathy of the British working-
classes.
Many other speeches were made.
Sir GEORGE REID purred statesmanship,
Sir MARK SYKEs scintillated, Mr. As-
QUITH temporized, and Mr. HERBERT
SAMUEL prattled of the Peace Confer-
ence. Half-a-dozen Nationalists said

division they were handsomely beaten.
Of the few Liberals who joined them in
the Lobby most, I fancy, voted, not
because they loved Ireland more but
because they loved LLOYD GEORGE less.
Tuesday, July 30th.-The Lords spent
a lively couple of hours in debating its
own procedure. A recent speech of
Lord CURzoN's had suggested to Lord
RIBBLEs DALE that the immemorial
right of the Peers to ask questions was
to be curtailed by D.O.R.A., and that
their historic Chamber was to become
a “controlled establishment.” Lord
LoNDoNDERRY joined in the protest.
He declared that the Lower House was
tending to become a subservient body
of Coalition placemen, and
then, by a process of reasoning
too subtle for anybody but an
Irishman to follow, argued that
the best way to save the Upper
House from a similar fate was
to put more Ministers into it.
Lord CurzoN disclaimed any
intention to reduce their Lord-
ships' privileges, which includ-
ed the right to put down a
question on one subject, make
a speech about another, and
wind up with a motion of
which no notice had been
given. No wonder that newly-
created Peers, fresh from the
control of the SPEAKER, felt
as if they were roaming in a
spacious park after being con-
fined to the trim alleys of a
Dutch garden. All he asked
was that when they were po-
litely requested to postpone
an inconvenient question they
should do so and not grumble
about freedom of speech “and
all that rubbish.”
In the Commons Mr. DILLON
endeavoured to raise as a question of
privilege the regulation that requires
intending travellers to Ireland to obtain
Incidentally
it meant that his friend, Mr. Swift
MACNEILL, had been obliged to have his
photograph taken, though it is only fair
to say that on this shocking outrage be-
ing brought to the notice of the author-
ities they had modified the order. Irish
Members were no longer required to
produce their portraits, but still had to
obtain passes before they could return
to Ireland. The SPEAKER, however,
ruled that the subject, if of importance, |
should have been raised six weeks ago.
An attempt by Mr. Swift MAcNEILL
to reduce the Secret Service Vote—the
thought of that photograph was still
rankling — suffered defeat; and the
House then passed all the remaining
Votes in Supply—unimaginable mil-
lions—in a quarter-of-an-hour.

AT THE OPERA.
“THE WALKYRIE.”
IN the triumphal finale of the
BEECHAM Opera Company's season
the brilliant orchestra and their con-
ductor once more carried off the honours.
But Mr. Robert PARKER, as the Wall-
Eyed One, sang nobly and with a high
seriousness. This is no easy matter when
one regards the humour of Wotan's sit-
uation, compelled as he is by his wife
Fricka to uphold the sanctity of mar-
riage vows (so rudely outraged by Sieg-
mund), and electing to utilise for this
purpose one of his
own numerous illegi-
timate children.
It is a sadly rare
thing to find youth
and slimness and
grace of motion in a |
Wagnerian heroine;
but these qualities are
possessed by Miss
GLADYs ANCRUM, and
her Sieglinde was a
very delightful figure.
I wish I could report
that her lover, Sieg-
mund, in the person of
Mr. WALTER HYDE,
conveyed a like sug-
gestion of romance, or
that Miss PERCEvaL
ALLEN's Brünnhilde
corresponded to my

Not for this face " Oh, not for such as I
Didst ripen into beauty, radiant sphere;
Rather, methinks, it is thy lot to lie
Beneath the zone of some rich profiteer,
Or haply some internment-fretted Hun
Fed to the teeth with weekly jaunts to town
And being well supplied with legal tender
Will hold thee cheap at fifteen and a bender,
And Lofthouse Parkward bear thee, beauteous one,
And there with the beakered bubbly wash thee down.
Not mine to indulge the grosser appetite,
But, being in love with beauty all my days,
I view thy shapeliness with sheer delight
And ſain would crown it with a wreath of praise.
Let whoso will devour thee; I will keep
Unsullied by desire the soul of me,
Singing, “O ripe round rosy one! O redolent
Of dappled kine and sunshine and sweet meadow
lent
A deeper charm of greenness by the deep
Delft blue of sky and zephyrless Zuyder Zee."
Not in the hives of men, but in some rare
And aromatic dairy wast thou churned,
And she that wrought thee—in her aureoled hair
A smouldering fire of ruddy amber burned,
Lighting an answering flame in thy red heart;
And when they brought thee to the market-place
The wise old doppers dwelt upon thy rounded
Flanks and the skill with which thou wast com-
pounded,
Acclaiming thee a masterpiece of art, . . .
A wonder-cheese, the pride of the Edam race.
And many sought to buy: the pro-Hun Swede
Was ſain to bear thee to his Northern-land;—
The blustering Teuton, mingling guile with greed, ""
Offered huge sums—in German notes-of-hand—
And threatened Schrecklichkeit should he refuse º
Who owned thee. But he was a stalwart wight
And vowed that thou shouldst go to swell the
rations - * *
Of those who fought to save the little nations,
Putting new power in honest British thews
And heartening British stomachs for the fight.
Vain hope! Methinks the Hun will get thee yet,
Some Schweinstein guiltless of his country's Kraut
Will guzzle thee or some Home Office pet
Whose name was Schmidt before the War broke out,
Who holds up Prussia's economic ends
And “Hochs "the KAISER at his German club,
Will wolf thee down with Kalbsfleisch und Kar-

With Plockwurst oder Wieneraturst (née offal),
Thanking his stars and influential friends
For life and liberty and lots of grub.

One patriot bosom leaped to thy allure? -
Thou canst not, but thy memory shall grow green
Shrined in the living verses that endure;
So, though men swallow thee, thou shalt not die,
But unborn generations, sitting near

At Mr. Punch's peerless brisket-splitters,
Will read of thee and pause; then, with a sigh—
“There was a cheese; we shall not know its peer.”
ALGOL.
“LITLE FILL.”
AT intervals of five or six years a new Minister of Educa.
tion arises and resolves that education shall at last be placed
upon a permanent basis. One of these efforts has, as I
understand, been made quite recently by Mr. Fisher, and
we are allowed to hope for wonderful things from the
provisions of the new Act. I hope with the rest, but I
have seen so many efforts made in this direction and have
seen so many promises only half fulfilled that I hope with
an enthusiasm which is perhaps more reasonable than the
sanguine hopes of earnest men and women who keep the
lamp of idealism alive in our midst. One thing I am sure
these idealists will not be able to do: they will not succeed
in reducing the spelling of the English language in our
elementary schools to a dead level of conformity. Indeed,
I am sure that our public schools, if they were examined
in spelling, would show considerable variations from the
normal. For my own part I trust that, in spite of
Mr. FISHER, such examples of picturesque spelling as that
which I am about to submit to Mr. Punch's readers will
not be rendered utterly impossible. There is about this
MS. a wild lawlessness which is extremely attractive.
Mrs. Bliss, the writer, is a charwoman. She is incorrect in
her spelling to a point that one would have thought almost
impossible, for she gives herself great trouble to produce
the most amazing results. The “Litle fill " to whom she
refers is her grandson, Philip, and the “Conadunt"—how
felicitous is this wonderful word l—is the Commandant at
the military hospital for which her services have been
engaged. Here, then, is the letter, which Mrs. Bliss wrote
to a lady of my acquaintance. -

takes his heroes through every kind of experience, nor is
that cheery pen of his always particularly squeamish about
shaking his readers' nerves. He has obviously no use for
the dressed-up version of war's horror. On the whole, for
those who are not satiated with war-writing, and especially
for any having associations with the Australian forces, I
can cordially recommend this engaging account of their
outlook and adventures. I should add that, though his
book was primarily intended, I suppose, for the Antipodean
reader, the author finds life on the Western front only one
of a number of strange experiences—others being Cambridge
in June, or a Queen's Hall concert during an air-raid.

do not propose to reveal) leads to a peck of trouble for all
concerned, and effectually pulls the story out of a slight
danger of stagnation which was just becoming apparent.
Mrs. RICKARD has a considerable sense of character; her
people, even when they are dull, are alive and capable of
being roused. I liked especially the whole conception of
Sylvia, who is a refreshing change from the super-perfection
of most heroines; a girl who begins by stealing jewels from
her dead aunt is at least above suspicion of conventionality.
But perhaps I was prejudiced by my delight at her quota-
tion of an exquisite and too little appreciated poem that has
long been a favourite of my own. After that, Sylvia might
have murdered her aunt before robbing her, and been
assured of my forgiveness.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Winged Warfare (Hodder AND SToughTon) is a thrilling
account of the many air-fights that Major BISHOP, V.C.,
D.S.O., M.C., has had with the Huns, and to a mere earth-
lubber like myself it is a marvel that he should still be alive
to tell the tale. In the first instance he came from Canada
with a cavalry detachment of the Second Canadian Division,
and the Flanders mud, which has done us so many bad
turns, has, at any rate, to its credit the fact that it gave us
one mighty flier. “Ordinary mud,” the Major writes, “is
bad enough when you have to make your home in it, but
the particular brand of mud that infests a cavalry camp has
a meanness all its own.” So he made up his mind to get
out of it into the air. When he left France he had forty-
seven victories to his credit, and you must read of them to
understand what such a record means. I like particularly
the way in which he grieves over himself when he has missed
what in his opinion was an opportunity to bring down a Hun.
Apart from the adventures we have here a considerable
amount of advice on flying in general and on the particular
necessity for practice in shooting. Major Bishop's book
breathes a fine courage, I-
and it is written with a
determined effort to be
as modest as the truth
would permit.
Resuscitated Pha-
raohs are no new thing
in fiction, but in A King
in Babylon (HUTCHIN-
son) Mr. BURTON E.
STEVENson has handled
the theme in a con-
vincingly original man-
ner. We may believe
that SEKENYEN RE and
his “Christian Slave”

possibly, indeed, there already exists upon the Transatlantic
stage a theatrical version of the escapades of these singu-
larly theatrical characters. If not, Mr. P. G. Wodehouse
should certainly rectify the omission at the earliest possible
moment. So much I can tell you off-hand, but as for
relating the plot—well, have you ever tried to recount the
complications of American crook-farce to even the most
sympathetic listener without regretting the venture? Picca-
dilly Jim is precisely that sort of story. The scene being
laid in New York, the dialogue is naturally written in
Freedom's tongue, as this medium is understood in the less
realistic style of dramatic entertainment. Of the cast
there are (to name but a few) a sporting young lead in the
title rôle, who, being on the “other side" under an assumed
name, conspires with the principal girl to pretend to be
himself. And so when his father, who was pretending to
be his own butler, recognized him as Jim, of course the girl
thought—what I mean is, when the thief who was pre-
tending to be Lord Wisbeach saw Jerry pretending to be him-
self, of course he couldn't give him away, so he stole the explo-
- - - sive; and after all, when
the dog bit him and he
dropped it, it didn't ex-
plode. And there you
are! I have an idea that,
if played very quickly
by persons in the visi-
ble flesh, this intrigue
would have a better
chance than in the de-
laying fetters of type.

the whole affair to excessive emotionalism begotten of
the Egyptian climate and a highly exciting scenario. The
author is cleverly nebulous, commits no material assaults
on our credulity, and at the same time avoids an excess
of mysticism. Naturally he must pay the penalty of
steering this non-committal course and face as best he
may the dilemma of disposing of the afflicted pair. Even
allowing for the difficulty of ending all mystery stories
it cannot be said that he tackles the problem in a manner
which does justice to the rest of the story. By sending
the young people off to a neighbouring oasis with a sub-
stantial retinue of camel-drivers, but with no money and
apparently no object, he gets rid of them, it is true; but
that is all that can be said of it. And the cheerful incuri-
osity with which their friends wave them farewell is a little
hard to swallow. Mr. STEvenson might at least have sent
a sandstorm to lend some colour to their failure to reappear
at Shepheard's Hotel when the charms of the oasis had
. to pall. On the whole, however, the story is an ex-
cellent one, though one is jarred by a few minor lapses, such
as the introduction of a chimpanzee into an Egyptian ruin.
My theory about Piccadilly Jim (JENKINs) is that if ever
a story was really a play disguised, this is that tale. Quite
my dictionary, at any rate, used to associate with it. Per-
haps she is thinking of the high altitudes where shepherds
may be supposed to lead their flocks, for certainly the
atmosphere of her book is that rare ether where royalties
—mostly minor—mingle in small—mostly very small—
talk with other persons of pedigree. Ordinary mortals
could hardly be expected to breathe in so rarefied a
heaven. To be included in the Olympus of her pages is
in itself a kind of deification, for a more liberal largesse of
adjectival appreciation can rarely have been lavished on
any writer's fortunate friends. In just compensation they
will have to endure, in reading a volume which the general
public will probably decide to leave to them alone, a good
many trite quotations and reiterated favourite expressions,
not to speak of other minor sources of irritation. All the
same, squeezed in among much dreariness, they may find a
few quite vivid sketches of places as opposed to personages,
and of events as contrasted with occasions. Lady JEPHson
has travelled and lingered, sketching, in places as far apart as
French Canada, where she was born, and Corfu; in Burgos
and in Cowes; has been honoured as a guest at a Turkish
wedding and detained as a prisoner at a German spa; and at
times she ceases from her hobby of collecting acquaintances
among the nearly great and tells us what she saw. -

RATS.
“Do any of you fellows happen to
know a good way to get rid of rats?”
I asked. “The huts in our camp are
simply full of them ; life's absolutely
not worth living there.”
“We haven't got any here,” said my
host.
“But you're only five minutes' walk
from us,” I said. - “It sounds in-
credible.”
“Nevertheless the fact remains,” said
he. “I was overrun with them too a
month ago, and to get rid of them
offered a stick of chewing-gum for
every tail. I was nearly broke in a
week.” -
“Talking about chewing-gum,” I
said, “do you know a couple of old
reprobates called Ah Sin and Dam
Li, who x -
“I should think I do,” interrupted
my host; “they got about a thousand
sticks apiece.”
“I thought they wouldn't be far
away if there was any chewing-gum
going,” I murmured.
Later on I sought out these two gen-
tlemen to try to discover how they had
earned it.
“Lats,” said Dam Li, “him velly
hungly. You give um good dinner,
catch um plenty much.”
“They're eating me out of house
and home already," I replied. “Look
here,” I went on, “if I give you two
fellows a stick of “Wrigley's' for every
tail will you get rid of them for me?”
Ah Sin and Dam Li looked much
hurt at such a mercenary suggestion.
“China boy no wantee plesent,” said
Ah Sin reproachfully. “'Sides, him
gottee plenty too much chewing-gum
allee longa now. No wantee chewing-
gum.”
However it appeared that they were
willing to do their rat-catching for love,
and the next aſternoon they arrived at
my camp and set to work.
“You givee China boy big ballel,”
said Ah Sin.
“Cut um top off,” interpolated Dam
Li, producing a roll of stiff parchment
from a capacious pocket.
The barrel was procured and Ah Sin
proceeded to pour water into it, while
Dam Li came over to me.
“You givee China boy one blick,”
said he.
“What on earth do you want a brick
for 2 " I asked.
“China boy puttee blick in watee for
lat to sit,” replied Dam Li.
Having got his brick and put it in
the bottom of the barrel, Dam Li then
spread his parchment all over the open
top and tied it down firmly.
“How do you expect the rats to be
able to go and sit on the brick if you
tie that stuff over the top 2" I asked.
“Him sittee on blick plenty latee
four, five days,” said Ah Sin.
“To-mollow, him sittee on paper,”
said Dam Li. “You givee plenty good
dinnee, allee same blead and cheese–
velly good lations."
At first I demurred, but in the end I
agreed to let them have their way, and,
the two Chinamen departed with a
promise to come again the next after-
noon to see how things were going.
On their arrival we all went to the
barrel against whose side there now
lay a sloping plank for the rats to get
up by. -
Ah Sin inspected the barrel from
afar. -
“Him velly beauty ballel,” he an-
nounced. “Lats eatum allee lations.”
“Give um meat, biscuits, allee same
officee's dinner,” said Dam Li, turning
an excited eye towards me and clapping
his hands together in anticipation of
joys to come.
What these joys were did not appear
till three days later, when, their pre-
parations complete, Ah Sin and Dam Li
carefully cut a large cross in the parch-
ment cover of the barrel.
“What's that for ?” I asked.
“Lat, him comee up allee same for
dinner an' fall allee long into watee,”
explained Dam Li.
“Then him cleep on blick,” said Ah
Sin darkly.
“Then 'nother lat gettee down in
watee an' go to blick allee same as
first,” said Dam Li with a far-away
look in his eyes.
Ah Sin's eyes were by now positively
sparkling.
“Then um fight,” he shouted.
“Then allee lats in countly hear him
scleam, an' lun plenty too much quick
to fight allee same as firs' lats," went
on Dam Li in a frenzy of delight.
“Then there plenty big low,” resumed
Ah Sin.
“An' to-mollow me dlessee tin hat
allee same Blitish soldiee man," pro-
phesied Dam Li.
“An' me dlessee beauty kilt allee
same Scotchee man," vaunted Ah Sin.
I couldn't get the kilt, but he allowed
himself to be content with a couple of
pair of “tlousees.”
Dam Li got his tin hat.

My DEAR CHARLEs, The other day
I was sitting in the foyer of the hotel,
talking to a spy and smoking one of his
cigars . . . . Yes, my dear boy, a real
spy and a real cigar. Does this take
your breath away, unnerve you a little?
Very good; we will go slow.
This was once a beautiful innocent
little country, with cows yodelling at
each other playfully, large honest moun-
tains bathing their feet in nice clean
lakes, and pure wholesome milk nest-
ling snugly in its tin. Now the whole
place is a mass of spies; you never saw
anything like it in your life;
rows of people in the street
with their hats pulled down
over their eyes, spying away
day and night and overtime
on Sundays. And so it came
about that I, dropped into this
country by chance, have at last
found myself chatting with a
spy about one thing and
another.
He was spying on me and I /
was spying on him out of com-1/
mon politeness. It was satis- ?
fying to my pride to be spied
upon at last. I have been in
this sordid place for six months
now, wearing an important
look and waiting to be accosted
by strangers (fair strangers
hoped for) and never a soul has
evinced the slightest interest
in me, save Artful Annie, the
Turkish Patrol. But I suspect
that woman, Charles; I have
always distrusted her, and now
am sure that she is not a spy at
all. Carried away by the atmo-
soul ask one a word about anything.
There was one really thrilling moment,
I must confess; a matter of bedroom
doors, corridors, two men pitting their
wits against each other—a grim silent
struggle. About 7.30 P.M. on a Satur-
day evening I found myself in my
bedroom, contemplating a bath before
dinner. The bathroom was full, so I
had the more time to contemplate.
Peering casually round the door of my
room you may conceive my horror at
catching sight of a man of German ex-
traction, indeed official position, looking
round his door at the other end of the
corridor—looking at me, but ceasing to
do so and withdrawing hurriedly the

getting to the bathroom first. What
with this and Artful Annie being ejected
from the hotel for not paying her bill,
you can imagine I was just about fed
up, when at last I was offered a real
cigar by a real spy.
How do you tell a spy when you see
one? By your flair. Very few persons
have the gift, the peculiar instinct, but
so far I have not yet met anybody who
was not one of the very few. It is the
undefinable something, the extraordi-
narily undefinable something which tells
you that a man or a woman is up to no
good. There is only one form of no-good
in war time, and that is spying. A man
may attract your suspicion by being
reluctant to fill up his hotel
bulletin, pretending that he
wants his dinner and is sick to
%|death of filling in forms. A
woman may blush uncomfort-
|ably under long relentless scru-
%, tiny, or your suspicions of a
|neutral may be aroused by his
% nodding to a Militaerischer-
undiplomatischeroffizieran-
|derspitzedesamtesfuermilitaer-
ischeundhandelsfragen; a sure
sign, since no man would do
that unless he was bribed to.
Or, lastly, it may just be that
you have the inhuman gift of
telling a spy without any signs
at all. It is generally that way.
Any old how, this fellow of
mine was a spy, and if you are
going to argue about it you are
not the patriot I have always
taken you for.
Talking to enemy agents,
you button up your coat firmly
and feel a sort of hot feeling.

to make-believe; she is pretending that
her being here for her health is all a

When she smiled at me the knowing

taking up a paper at random, sat and
watched her round the corner of it. I
very soon discovered that she too had
taken up a paper at random and was
sitting watching me round the corner
of it. What gave her away, as not
being really in the profession, was the
fact that she was holding the paper
upside down. I recognised this as the
act of one not in the business, because
when I got tired of watching her watch-
ing me and settled down to read my
own paper I discovered that this too
was upside down.
It is depressing to know all about
everything and never have a sinister
to develop the affair; you know how
one's instincts tell one when there is
something afoot. I withdrew my head,
waited a little and then had another
look. There he was again looking at
my door. There was no doubt about
it, he was looking at me; I was looking
at him; we were looking at each other.
I left my door slightly ajar and waited,
listening.
All was still. Then I heard the
bathroom door open and the occupant
come out with a noisy joviality entirely
in contrast to our stealthy proceedings.
I had forgotten about the bath; but
this reminded me that it would now be
consistent with perfect innocence and
uprightness to saunter casually forth,
a move so cunning in its sheer sim-
plicity that it was more than likely to
lead to my discovering the German
doing something sinister. It did; I
discovered him running like a hare and
from your breast pocket the Secret and
Confidential Draft of the Allies' Peace
terms ? You are rather afraid he will.
Incidentally you are rather annoyed
with yourself, in your curiosity to know
what these terms might be, for having
omitted to have a look in your own
breast-pocket yourself. That however
is by the way. Is he going to worm
your secrets out of you, or isn't he ”
You determine not to give yourself
away; but sooner or later you have to
unbutton that coat in order to assure
yourself, and button it up again slightly
more firmly. You then feel relieved
but hurt to find there is no Secret
Draft there after all.
We had got into one of those chance
positions in which you have got to
say something to a man. When I had
found there was nothing in my breast-
pocket I fixed my eye on his. One
must conform to the fashionable habits,
must one not? As I looked at it it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE INSECT PATRIOT.
ATTEND, war-workers all, to this my song,
And, charitable patriots, give ear -
While I set forth his praise who midst the throng
Of labourers was not the least sincere,
Nor passed unworthy of a poet's tear—
The insect (saving your gentility)
Known in our village as the Red Cross Flea.
No random strain is mine; I prayed the man
Who trained the flea to come and give his show ;
“It would,” I said, “be quite a pleasant plan
For you to charge us nothing.” He said, “No:
'E've got our bread to earn, 'ave Romeo;
There's times 'e finds it 'ard too—seems to fret
For 'is pore mate wot I called Juliet.”
I paid him what he asked, and oh, the mite,
The nimble Romeo, was worth it all !
He washed his face, he sparred in mimic fight,
He drew a quaint coach infinitely small,
He—well, he took by storm the village hall;
From Bill the poacher to the gurgling Squire,
They rocked with laughter to my heart's desire.
And I–I rose and took my old cloth hat;
“No one need pay,” I said, “who's feeling bored,
But all who've raised the roof stump up for that.”
Pounds, shillings, pennies, ha'pence, in they poured;
Still Romeo performed, still people roared;
But ah! methinks we pressed too close to see
And roused the dormant savage in the flea.
He sprang on whom he deemed a likely prey—
On Bill; and that inept and thankless lout,
Who must have harboured dozens in his day—
At the first puncture William gave a shout
And with one swipe the little life crushed out.
O cruel fate' to labour half the night
And then be killed for natural appetite.
Judge him not harshly; in his trainer's phrase,
“That hinsec' were a patriot—must 'a' been,
For never in 'is 'ole performin' days
'Ave I known Romeo wash 'isself so clean,
Nor 'aul 'is coach so quick as wot you seen.
An' now 'e's done in, 'coz for once he thought
'E'd draw 'is rations where 'e didn't ought.”
WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
THE SILENT MENACE.
No one knows where the Silent Menace came from
or why he chose our trawler for his abode. He walked
aboard one morning in a casual manner as we were casting
off from the quay-side and has stayed with us ever since.
My own opinion is that the pleasures of life ashore had
palled for him and he desired solitude and the untainted
sea. None of us understands him in the least, and his
nature is not of the sort that easily awakens affection,
but I think we should all miss him if ever he were to
desert us.
He is, we think, a dog. As he is obviously not a cat
or any known kind of rabbit, and as the third hand, who is
an authority on all matters connected with the Turf and
once won a bet, declares that he is not a race-horse, he
must, as the Second-Engineer said, be a dog or nothing.
In breed he is a cosmopolitan. In his younger days he
must have lived a very knockabout sort of life; one ear
is sadly tattered, one eye is missing, and his tail, which
reminds one of a tallow dip that has been kept in a warm
cupboard, is attached to his person obliquely as though
stricken with a sudden paralysis in the act of wagging.
It never wags now.
His manners are unsociable and he is utterly indifferent
to all circumstances. Nothing seems to please or annoy
him; he is occasionally bored, that is all. If you venture
to pat him on the head he looks at you with his only re-
maining orb, as much as to say, “Please don't be idiotic,"
and edges away. You feel foolish. If he shows any par-
tiality at all it is that he prefers as a couch the duffel coat
of the Teddy Bear to any other garment aboard. The
Teddy Bear, a rotund woolly-haired deck-hand, quite obvi-
ously escaped from a nursery to join the Trawler Reserve,
has often to borrow a watch-coat because his own has been
requisitioned by the Silent Menace.
When the ship is at sea he behaves much like the rest
of us; he takes his regular watch on deck and watch below.
He has a habit at times of running on to the bows, placing
his fore-paws on the rail and sniffing the air vigorously.
“Smellin' for submarines,” the Teddy Bear says he is.
Once and once only has the Silent Menace betrayed any
sort of feeling, and that was on the occasion of a visit from
the Inspecting Officer of Armed Trawlers and Drifters.
The Inspecting Officer, as befits one who holds a shore
billet, has dignity and wears yellow gloves. I think it was
the gloves that upset the Menace.
As the I.O. stepped aboard the Silent Menace emerged
from behind the winch, stopped dead and then deliberately
“pointed" at him. The I.O. was obviously confused, but he
mastered what must have been an overwhelming impulse
to take cover, and began to inspect. Whereupon the Silent
Menace followed him round the ship at a distance of three
feet, never once removing his intense gaze from the Inspect-
ing Officer's left ankle. It was positively uncanny. The
I.O.'s nerves were so overstrained that he forgot to register
a single complaint, a thing unknown before in the annals of
the Service. He also left one of his yellow gloves lying on
the after-hatch when he finally left the ship. The mate
was just going to pick it up when the Silent Menace anti-
cipated him. Reaching the glove at a single bound he took
it delicately by the thumb, walked to the rail and delib-
erately dropped it overboard. Then, with an impressive
glance in the direction of the Inspection Officer's retreating
figure, he turned to the crew and solemnly winked his
solitary eye, and sauntered away in search of the Teddy
Bear's duffel.
“I tell you that dog ain't human,” remarked the skipper.
He is certainly one of those that say little and think much
—a characteristic of all great British seamen.
FOR THE CHILDREN.
At this holiday season, when their own children are enjoy-
ing the air of sea and country, Mr. Punch begs his kind
readers not to forget the needs of the children of the poor.
The Children's Country Holiday Fund finds hospitality
for them in country homes, where their flagging health,
which has suffered in many cases from influenza, may be
restored. It is pitiful that any child of the town should
miss this chance for lack of help ; but subscriptions to the
Fund have fallen off during the War, while expenses have
unavoidably increased.
Mr. Punch knows of no cause that is more certain to appeal
to the hearts of his readers and he very confidently prays
that liberal cheques, made payable to the Children's Country
Holiday Fund (of which Lord ARRAN is Hon. Treasurer),
may be sent to the Secretary, C.C.H.F., 18, Buckingham
Street, Strand, W.C.2.

THE PLURALIST WAR-WORKER.
I LEANED upon the garden fence, sur-
prised at the spectacle of Jenkins dig-
ging in his back-yard.
“Are you,” I asked, “preparing for
the interment of a household pet 2"
He did not condescend to answer.
“Or are you prospecting for min-
erals 2" I hazarded; “treasure-hunting,
perhaps?”
“I am,” he said.
The excavation of a mouldy claret-
bottle engaged his attention for a mo-
ment; but with a sideways glance he
had observed my pitying smile. -
“Let me tell you,” he said, digging
deeply for a pre-historic coffee-pot,
“that you are privileged to watch a
man working on behalf of four depart-
ments of His Majesty's Government—
responding with a single gesture,” he
continued, driving his fork into the
ground, “to four distinct appeals to
win the War.”
He exhumed what was once a kettle
and added it exultingly to his other
mineral treasures.
“Exhorted by the Director of Na-
tional Salvage,” said Jenkins, “I am
recovering what was previously dis-
carded as waste. I am conserving
national resources.” And he bayonetted
a sardine-tin.
“These waste products,” he went on,
“will presently be sold and the money
will be invested in National War Bonds.
I am therefore working for the Trea-
sury. . . .”
“Splendid!” I exclaimed, leaning
less heavily on the garden fence, which
seemed inclined to collapse as the hole
in the back-yard yawned deeper.
“You have not heard all,” he went
on. “This stuff will be eventually
utilised as material of war. I am

“And the hole?” I asked eagerly.
“Yes, that too will help,” said Jen-

You are marvellous, Jenkins,” I said,
and in my excusable enthusiasm
brought down the fence.
But Jenkins, preoccupied by some
new discovery, disregarded the catas-
trophe.
“In saying that I am working simul-
taneously for four Departments,” he
informed me, “I was, in fact, under-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 5th.-Lest the Peers
should get a bit above themselves on the
good news from France, Lord INCHCAPE
thought it necessary to warn them
of the gloomy financial future that
awaited them. Their Lordships' de-
pression was deepened by Lord Ashton
of HYDE, who urged the Government
to inquire into the practicability of a
levy on capital. Lord EMMOTT, who a
short time ago was dilating on Ger-
many's financial difficulties, was now,
with fine impartiality, almost equally
eloquent about Great Britain's, and
urged the importance of cut-
ting our coat according to our
cloth so soon as that cloth had
ceased to be khaki-coloured.
The Peers would have gone to
their dinners in melancholy
mood but for a few heartening
words from Lord CURzoN, who
cheerfully declared that though
we should have to spend a lot
of money after the War in re-
building a shattered world we
should find it a very good in-
vestment. -
The little group of Bolshev-
ists below the Gangway in the
Commons are apparently per-
turbed by the prospect that
Russia may be helped on to her
legs again by the Allies. Mr.
BALFour assured them that our
aim was to bring about the
political and economic restora-
tion of Russia “without inter-
nal interference of any kind”;
but when Mr. LEEs SMITH in-
vited him to translate this
proviso into an undertaking
that we would not assist any-
body to overthrow the Soviets
he turned a deaf ear—rather
fortunately, since at that very
moment the Allied forces in
Archangel were engaged upon that iden-
tical enterprise.
The long-promised debate on the
Ministry of Information was a little
disappointing. Lords BEAVERBRook
and NorthcLIFFE were expected to
figure as the villains of the piece. But
Lord NorthcLIFFE had already publicly
dissociated himself from its deeds, whe-
ther good or evil. As Chief Propa-
gandist in Enemy Countries he reports
direct to the PRIME MINISTER—or the
PRIME MINISTER reports direct to him.
As for the other noble Lord he only
came to the Ministry in March, and
therefore was not responsible for most
of the crimes laid to its charge, including
the expenditure of thirty-one pounds
on alcoholic liquor by a party of pro-
pagandists in Dublin, an incident which
sorely vexed the temperate soul of Mr.
LEIF Jones.
Tuesday, August 6th.-The India Re-
form Report was discussed at large in
both Houses. It was a pity that Mr.
MonTAGU could not have been at both
ends of the corridor at the same time.
The Commons were quite disarmed by
his account of what India had done for
the Empire during the War, in money,
provisions and men. If the native
really wants a vote who would grudge

cate reminder to Members who had
served in the Peninsula that conditions

departure also helped to stave off some
liverish comments. Even Sir John REEs
was mollified and gave the Report his
blessing.
In the Lords, on the contrary, the
official defence was postponed until
after Lord SYDENHAM had delivered a
heavy indictment against the Report.
In his opinion Mr. MoRTAGU's visit to
India had been “a real misfortune,”
and his so-called reforms were “a
concession to a denationalized intel-
ligentzia "-which I take to be a peri-
phrasis for Mrs. BESANT—and would
if carried out end in the destruction
of the Indian Civil Service. Happily
other returned pro-consuls took a less
melancholy view. Lord LAMINGTON
admitted that, having now read the
Report, he found it less dangerous than
might have changed since their lamented
he had expected. And as Lord CURzoN
said that the Government had not yet
made up their minds on the subject
and no legislation need be expected for
some time, the Peers went home with
the comforting reflection that the Brit-
ish raj was good for a few years longer.
In spite of an earnest appeal by the
HoME SECRETARY to bring the law into
accordance with the facts, the House
of Commons in its wisdom threw out
by 81 votes to 77 the Bill which was
to have enabled charitable societies to
hold raffles during the War. The hos-
tile majority was, I imagine, largely
due to the compelling eloquence of Mr.
THEoDoRE TAYLOR. Who could
neglect the warnings of a his-
torian capable of drawing a
parallel between the diamond
necklace of MARIE ANToINETTE
and the pearls that Sir ARTHUR
STANLEY has collected for the
Red Cross, or doubt the sin-
cerity of a Dissenter who ex-
pressly disclaimed “the Non-
conformist Conscience and all
that sort of rot ”? What the
Red Cross will do now with its
pearls—and incidentally its pig
—remains to be seen. Per-
sonally I should brave Mr.
TAYLOR and all the other deni-
zens of Tooley Street and hold
the raffles just the same, in the
confident hope that Sir GEORGE
CAve will continue to turn a
blind eye on such innocent
speculations.
Wednesday, August 7th.-The
announcement that the House
would adjourn until October
15th–a week later than had
been anticipated — confirmed
Mr. PRINGLE's hopes, or fears,
of impending Dissolution and
caused him to inquire, “Will
the right hon. gentleman give
an undertaking that we shall
ever meet again?” Mr. BonAR LAw is
beginning to acquire the “pawkiness”
of the late Sir H. CAMPBELL-BANNER-
MANN. “I cannot give an undertaking
that we shall all meet again,” was his
reply.
Whether the PRIME MINISTER means
to go to the country—in the political
sense—is a secret at present unrevealed.
There was certainly no electioneering
flavour about his review of the War,
which was in the main a record of the
achievements and the sacrifices of the
British Empire by sea and land through-
out the whole of the past four years
—and not specially during the period
since he became Premier. A warning
was given to the peacemongers not to
expect their efforts to succeed until the
enemy knew he was beaten. But of

vote-catching I saw no sign, and I was
rather surprised at the querulous tone
of some of Mr. SAMUEL's comments.
Fresh from America, Mr. T. P.
O'Connor made a clever balancing
speech, demonstrating to his own satis-
faction that the cause of the Allies was
the cause of freedom, but that Hibernia
irredenta could not be expected to fight
for it. His elaborate compliments to
Lord READING (in the Peers' gallery)
would have been more grateful to the
recipient, I fancy, if they had not been
accompanied by a savage attack upon
another eminent lawyer-politician, who,
according to “men in Wall Street"—
notoriously experts in ethical problems
—“ought to have been shot or hanged
long ago.”
Thursday, August 8th.--To Lord
Robert CECIL's complaint that a
certain Question contained “implica-
tions not in accordance with facts,"
Mr. King indignantly replied that he
had no implication in his mind. The
cerebral convolutions of that majestic
intellect are unmarred by a single kink.
On the adjournment motion the Paci-
fists made another futile attempt to
convince the House that the Germans
were ready to make an honest peace if
only our Government would listen to
them. Their principal spokesman, Mr.
ANDERson, was well answered by Mr.
J. M. Robertson, who was a Pacifist
himself until this War converted him ;
and by the Foreign SECRETARY, who
declared that we were quite ready to
talk to Germany as soon as Germany
showed any indication of a change of
heart. Up to the present there has
been no sign of it.
The news of Sir Douglas HAIG's
advance on the Somme was ringing in
our ears when the House adjourned.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE FREEDOM of THE SEAs.”
Apophthegms are in the theatrical
air just now. At the New Theatre it
is Chi Lung who is throwing off epi-
grams of Oriental philosophy; and here
at the Haymarket we have Adoniram
Wallace, captain of a tramp steamer,
delivering a series of tropes purporting
to be drawn from “the Good Book.”
There is a pleasant irony about this
alleged derivation, for Adoniram is a
godless rogue who has lost his certifi-
cate through drink and is now in league
with two other rogues—one of them
the wireless operator—to scuttle, his
ship, whose cargo he imagines to be a
bogus one, for the sake of the insurance
money.
But he is a true British rogue and in-
nocent of the other conspirators' scheme
for handing over the precious cargo to
the crew of a Hun submarine. The
clever device by which the enemy plot
was defeated I will not divulge, but
merely say that it was a great piece of
luck that secured for our Navy in mid-
ocean (where the tramp had picked up
a few relics of a torpedoed liner) the un-
rehearsed services of a perfect lady who
had been brought up as a telegraph
clerk and could read a wireless message |
by ear while it was being tapped out
by somebody else.
To turn to the hero, George Smith.
Starting life as an indifferent clerk to a
solicitor, he is persuaded to believe that
only a strong and original initiative will
enable him to achieve his ambition of
marrying his employer's daughter. So
he gets a commission (I don't know how)
in the R.N.V.R., and ultimately finds
himself placed, at a moment's notice,
in charge of Adoniram's tramp, and
incidentally in control of the fates of
his late master and that gentleman's
daughter, who are on board, having
been rescued from the submarined liner.
The atmosphere is heavy with remin-
iscences of Admirable Crichton; but
Smith is not much better as a sailor
than he was as a solicitor's clerk, his
two- and - a -half-years' experience in
opening envelopes at the Admiralty
having taught him very little about the
handling of ships. He does nothing
really nautical, and could not possibly
have carried out his own instructions to
alter the course of the tramp so as to
avoid the attentions of a submarine. At
the moment of crisis, when guns are
booming, he is safe under cover, making
love to the solicitor's daughter, whose
rather worthless hand he eventually
wins without performing a single heroic
action. To an average audience, eager
for the poetic justice of melodrama, this
is bound to be most unsatisfactory.
I ought perhaps to give him credit
for his victorious struggle with a villain
twice his size; but it was done in the
dark, and I think the result must have
been arranged.
However, we had some pretty humour
in the dialogue and several really ex-
cellent character - sketches. Notable
among these was Stanley Bolton, a
Canadian with a fine gift of worldly
wisdom, who induced George Smith to
strike out on a line of his own, explain-
ing to him that if you want to be a
first-class squirrel you mustn't stay on
the ground. Mr. ToM REYNoLDs played
the part most admirably.
Another entertaining study was that

of Jenny Weathersbee, U.S.A. (inter-
preted with a nice sense of humour by
Miss MARION Lorn E), whose wardrobe,
on which she largely depended for
her recognition as a lady, had been
torpedoed. “I was a telegraph opera-
tor," she privily admits, “but people
think by my manner that I come of a
a very good family.” Mr. VINCENT
STERNRoyd was delightful in the too-
brief part of Horatio Gamp, veteran
clerk to George Smith's firm; and as the
pompous head of the firm Mr. HolMAN
CLARK had the sort of part that fits
him like a maillot
But the outstanding figure was Adomi-
ram Wallace, and I cannot remember
ever to have seen Mr. SYDNEY WALEN-
TINE in better form. As for Mr. DENNIs
EADIE, I have known him more happily
suited. Probably it was my fault for
not being better acquainted with the
ways of second-rate solicitors' clerks
and amateur Naval officers, but I found
it hard to believe that he was anybody
but just Mr. DENNIs EADIE, though
that is always a very nice thing to be.
The minor characters—in particular
Mr. RANDLE AYRTON's wireless operator
—were well played, though I must
confess that neither Miss BILLIE CAR-
LETON nor her love affair very greatly
intrigued me.
I have an apprehension (groundless,
I hope) that the many excellent qualities
of Mr. HACKETT's play that appealed to
the quick and generous sympathies of a
first-night audience are not solid enough
to ensure for it a very firm residence in
the general British bosom. O. S.

To-DAY Is oup SILVER weddixG, AND I HAVE BROUGHT OUT THE
FAITHF UL CHARGER WHO CARRIED US WHEN WE FLED TOGETHER FROM MY FATHER'S CASTLE.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC IF
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I FIND myself tempted to join issue with the publishers of
Up and Down (HUTCHINson) when they call it “a new book
by the author of Dodo.” Decause, though it is certainly
signed by Mr. E. F. BENsoN, this is by no means the same
Mr. BENSON whose engaging satires have moved me so
often to laughter. Up and Down is at once more and less
than these; indeed it is hardly to be called a story at all,
since there are but two characters, Mr. BENson himself and
a friend, and for the most part it is a record of the mental
experiences common to us all during the last four years.
Such a book, dealing as it does with the most intimate
emotions of a man's soul, stands or falls by one simple
test, that of sincerity. No one can ever be certain of this
quality in the work of another; but what Mr. BENsoN finds
to say of the hazardous and disquieting problems that
these evil times have called up, of patriotism, friendship,
survival of personality, and so on, has all of it the ring of
a genuine conviction. Glancing at the volume after reading
it, I see a number of pages dog-eared for quotation (a
foolish habit, since there is hardly ever enough room) and
find that I proposed to draw your attention to the author's
views upon middle-age, the spirit of houses, Germany as a
mirth-provoker, and a dozen other wise and witty com-
ments, which now you must find out for yourselves. Up
and Down, as its title hints, is not a very equal work; it
has, to be frank, its superfluous moments; but at its best
(and apart from some wholly delightful pictures of life on
the delectable island of Capri) it has both charm and, to
employ a detestable word that for once seems appropriate,
helpfulness.
If library subscribers wish a change of fare in the direc-
tion of truth which is stranger and lovelier than fiction, let
me recommend them For Dauntless France (Hodder AND
StoughtoN). This is a record by Mr. LAURENCE BINYoN
of the work done by British men and women for the French
wounded and the victims of the War in the devastated
areas. It is rare that records of the kind are couched in so
felicitous an idiom or ordered with so nice a sense of propor-
tion. “Record,” indeed, is too dull a name for so interest-
ing and human a story, pointed with anecdote and charm-
ingly documented with letters that bring forcibly before you
the courage, the stress, the zeal and patience of the work—
work in hospitals and ambulances in and behind the fighting
areas, in canteens, refugee shelters, maternity homes; work
done—and we are not so much proud as grateful to recall
it—by British volunteers in the service of France and the
French. Differences of language and custom, little racial
prejudices, the effect of contemporary legends, e.g., of the
British as proud sad dogs, all had to be overcome, and you
cannot read these pages without realizing how completely
they have been overcome and how firm a cement for the
future entente has been manufactured as a by-product of the
contact between sufferers and healers. And you get some
measure of the scale of this process by the fact that over
seven thousand five hundred British workers were in the
service of the French Red Cross by the end of 1917. Nor
should you miss some fine lines in a dedicatory sonnet of
the poet-recorder, nor a preface, the perfect pattern of such
hazardous things, in the simplest, most lucid and most
graceful French, by M. PAUL CAMBON.
It seems hardly decent that “Q,” having become a learned
professor, should have had the effrontery to turn out a book

so full of excitement and humour as Foe-Farrell (CoLLINs).
I enjoyed every word of it, from its dedication, “To any one
who supposes that he has a worse enemy than himself,”
down to the epilogue on the demoralising factor in hate.
Farrell, reckless Radical and successful tradesman, has
ruined the life-work of Foe, the scientist, through a false
charge of vivisection practices. That charge led to a riot
and a fire which burnt Foe's records of an eight-years'
research. The latter's revenge is to pretend to be recon-
ciled, to win the artless man's friendship, and at the well-
prepared moment to explain the intensity of the hate which
impels him, and to promise that he will never desist from
studying, and thereby torturing, him at close quarters. The
perpetual fellowship of an enemy, bitter to the point of
madness, but much too clever to do anything which would
justify appeal to police protection, with the hinted possi-
bility of a sudden death, of which the victim may be only
too glad at the end of it, that is the prospect of Farrell at
demobilization. It is that you may inform yourself on these
facts, and possibly pass on the information to some quarter
where it is needed, that Mr. Punch most warmly commends
to your notice a publication that costs half-a-crown and
offers (though this incidentally) many literary and artistic
attractions — a cartoon by MAX, a playlet by Sir JAMEs
BARRIE, and so on—which, even unsupported by patriotism,
would be cheap at four times the price.
I gather that Mr. T. R. St. JoHNSTON, the author of The
Lau Islands (Fiji); and their Fairy Tales and Folk Lore
(“TIMEs.” Book Co.), was for some time District Commis-
sioner in Fiji, and was lately Medical Officer to the Fijians
in France. The duties of his commissionership often took
him to the Lau Islands, where he made it his pleasure to
collect from the very lips of the inhabitants such myths and
fairy tales as were still a part of memory. These he has
now put together. The result is a most fascinating book,

constitutes a problem whose gravity and importance it
is impossible to over-estimate. But not everyone is aware
of the precise nature of the problem or of the means that
are being adopted to overcome its difficulties. This is
the reason for the appearance of a new, or rather a rein-
carnated, quarterly magazine, named Reveille, issued by
the War Office under what seems to Mr. Punch the re-
markably able editorship of Mr. John GALsworthy. Put
in few words, the object of Reveille is to rouse and in-
struct popular opinion about the after-war position of the
disabled sailor or soldier—what that position threatens to
be. The wise measures offered by the authorities for the
continued physical treatment and re-training of discharged
men, and the obstacles (mostly inherent in human nature)
that prevent full advantage being taken of these, are all set
out in Mr. GALsworthy's very powerful and convincing
editorial...The greatest difficulties appear to be two—the
fatal facility with which, owing to the present labour
shortage, any discharged man not wholly incapable can
obtain a job for the time being, and the very understandable
reluctance of men already weary of treatment and disci-
pline to subject themselves to the further re-training that
would fit them for the changed conditions that must follow
Johnston's book, to which I extend a cordial welcome.
Should The Secret of the Navy (MURRAY) chance to fall
into the hands of a Hun he will be rudely disappointed if
the title leads him to look for any indiscreet disclosures
within its pages. Discretion, indeed, is one of Mr. BENNET
Copprestos E's qualities, and fair-mindedness is another.
Proud as he is of our Navy, he does not hesitate to praise
German sailors and seamanship when he thinks they de-
serve it. “Count von Spee,” he writes, “though a Prussian
Junker, was a gentleman and worthy to serve under the
White Ensign.” To belong to our Navy is to be as near
heaven as is permitted on this earth, and even a German
when he plays the game is considered fit to enter that
charmed circle. The sea-battles of the War are here des-
cribed in detail and with scrupulous impartiality, and it may
be a tonic to those gloomy people who croak that we never
have any good luck to find that in more than one instance
the author considers that fortune has been on our side.

[AUGUST 21, 1918,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TRAIL OF THE HUN.
To J., WITH AFFECTIONATE REMEMBERANCES.
THERE is a garden in my dream—
I dare not name its actual site—
That hangs above a little stream
Made great by many a grisly fight;
I see it, on a golden day,
Untouched amid the big guns' traces,
Where on the fringe of War it lay,
A really rather nice oasis.
A year ago; and once again—
Ah! happy moments, far too few,
Snatched from your high task's deadly
strain— -
I walk its shadowed ways with you;
And bring you (did I bring?) release
A little while from ties that tether,
Talking as when, with hearts at peace,
We paced your English lawns toge-
ther.
A year ago; and then the Hun
Over our thin defences strode
In whelming myriads, five to one,
Until your Army blocked his road;
And, where we walked and talked but
now,
These swine (a mark for nosing Ne-
mesis)
Doubtless have made, as Huns know
how,
The usual piggery of your premises.
But soon they'll need a change of styes
And try a new address. I hear
They're busy mapping out a wise
Strategic movement toward the rear;
So if the spot's not blown to dust,
And there your Staff is reinstated,
Please ask me back; but first, I trust,
You'll get the place well fumigated.
— O. S.
“WILLIE WAS A WANTON WAG.”
Peter arrived at my O.P. just before
dawn to relieve me.
“Any news?” I asked.
“Only a short and sharp encounter
with the G.O.C. Umptieth Infantry
Brigade. He wanted our dug-out for
his H.Q.”
“What astounding impudence I
hope you told him off and sent him
about his business.”
“I said exactly what I thought of
him. We all did.”
“After he'd gone, perhaps?”
“Well, after we'd gone. Yes, we
had to go.”
“How rotten' What is he called,
this Brigadier person?”
But the sky was lightening and
already Peter, was gazing intently
through a loophole hastily improvised
with boulders.
“Oh, we've got the high ground,
An' they've got the low ground,
So they've got a thin time afore 'em,”
he murmured.
Then he proceeded to give an order
to the telephonist and waited. Through
a smaller crack in our sangar I saw a
cloud of dust and smoke rise from the
plain below.
“Good,” said Peter. “There's a
Turk ammunition dump we shall never
meet again on the bonnie, bonnie banks
of Loch Lo–mon'.”
“So it's up with the bonnets o'
bonnie Dundee,” said I.
“If bonnie Dundee ups with his
bonnet here he'll disclose the position
to a watchful enemy and it'll be up
with bonnie Dundee as well,” said Peter.
“That is so,” I said. “I merely
mentioned him to show that I also am
conversant with the contents of the
Star Album of Scottish ballads, price
one shilling.”
“Well, try to be more apposite next
time.” . *
“I will,” I said, preparing to de-
part; and, undeterred by a cry of
“Stop that frightfulness,” from Peter,
I began to chant, “Rolling home,
Rolling home.”
It was thus that it came to me, as I
took my inconspicuous way back to the
battery, that a useful item in our next
Divisional concert would be an appro-
priate pot-pourri of Scottish songs, and
I spent a morning, which should have
been spent in sleep, in the agonies of
composition. “The Camels are com-
ing,” though vieur jeu, seemed indis.
pensable, and I had just incorporated
“Charlie is my Darling” in a some-
what uninspired manner, when I be-
thought me of “Willie was a wanton
wag." I could remember nothing of
this song except that it was included in
our Scottish Album and that when we
were young we used to shout it in what
we believed (quite wrongly) to be a
lifelike imitation of the Highland
accent; but it seemed so extraordinarily
apposite that I was longing to impart
my discovery to Peter. He came in
the following evening.
“Do you know “Willie was a wanton
wag ’7” I asked.
He looked at me doubtfully.
“Have you been in the sun without
your topee, old chap 2" he asked.
I intimated somewhat curtly that I
had not.
“Then what the-”
“It's a song, you fathead—a Scots
song. You told me to be apposite next
time and I'm being it.”
“Are you?” he said coldly.
It had been a hot day and I felt
aggravated with Peter.
“Perhaps you didn't know that the
German CrowN PRINCE is called WILLIE
and that ‘wanton wag' is a very happy
description of him.”
“Ah, now you've explained, I see.
You ought always to explain your
jokes.”
“It isn't a joke.”
“Then I'm afraid I’ve missed it
again.”
“It's a parody, you silly ass,” I said,
now thoroughly roused. “I'm going
to write a parody of the well-known
song, ‘Willie was a wanton wag,' and
sing it at the next concert. How's
this for a start 2–
‘Willie was a wanton wag;
Willie loved to scoop the swag."
That, combined with 'Charlie is my
Darling' and “The Camels are coming,'
ought to make a very effective little
song-cycle.”
Peter regarded me thoughtfully.
“‘Willie was a wanton wag,'" he
murmured. “Am I to understand that
the alleged reference is solely to LITTLE
WILLIE 2'' -
I sighed heavily. “Of course it is,"
º perhaps a little irritably. “Who
else wn
“All right, all right,” he said; “have
it your own way. Only don't blame
me if they take you wrong.”
There seemed no possible fear of that,
and indeed “Willie was,” etc., went with
especial éclat—among the men, that is.
Among the gilded ones of the front row
there seemed, I thought, an atmosphere
almost of disapproval which I could not
understand.
“Very fine effort,” said Peter, as I
subsided into a seat beside him. “Good
bold piece of work. Showed a praise.
worthy disregard for absurd old-time
respect-for-authority notions.”
“What are you drivelling about?" I
asked.
“Merely that the Brigadier who
pinched our dug-out is called William
Wagge,” Peter laughed softly. “You
promised to be apposite next time,” he
said, “and certainly a wonderful success
has attended your efforts.”
I laughed myself, but a little bitterly.
I was thinking of the power that lay
with William Wagge to hurt me. Sup-
pose he forbade me all leave for seven
years? It was highly improbable that
he would allow the incident to affect
him in any way; but suppose— I
sat there unsmiling, unheeding, looking
into a future clouded with doubt, though
a man was singing a really humorous
song about the cruelty of the Armen-
ians to the Turks.

The little Captain is the son of that
Captain Quinn who in Mrs. Meahan's
eyes, since he is her Danny's Captain,
is the British officer of whom all others
are only more or less faulty imitations
save the little Captain who is accounted
for by his paternity. Mrs. Meahan's
intention in introducing the subject
appeared in her next sentence.
“That's the way of it . . . wasn't I

tin', savin' your presence, your honour,
ma'am, where ye are to-day ? Wasn't

“‘An' thrue for you, Mrs. Meahan,'
says the little Captain; “you have it
said, and it's not a soldier here nor
there that will speak against your word.
'Tis a terrible sthrong fight I'm afther
havin' wid the War Officer mesilf, but
I've got him down,' he says, “and out,'
he says, “and I've clicked intirely.
“‘Look at thim,' he says, and shows

Limerick, that wouldn't know his own

“‘Captain dear,' I says, wid no other
thought in me head but they'd got
another leg off him, ‘have ye no legs at
all, at all 2'
“‘I'm afther losin' another,’ says he,
“but it 's the one I lost before.' And he
telt me how it was.
“Him havin' lost the one thrue leg
they wouldn't be lettin' him dhrive a
machine by his own, so he and another
one were there ridin' low down—"bank-
in, he says, above the Germins—seemin'
like his machine took off from the
a fox.”
Ballymell has never yet seen a flying
machine, but Mrs. Meahan has beard
of biplanes and has a conception of
them as a kind of heavenly bicycle, for
which the little Captain is probably not
to blame.
“Up they were, an' a Germin ridin' a

[AUGUST 21, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ORDEAL.
To my mind one of the most touching and pathetic sights
in London is the group of young officers to be seen any day
gathered round the entrance to Cox's. True, they seem
gay enough, and the casual and unthinking observer might
imagine they had met at Charing Cross to exchange jokes
and reminiscences and to fight their battles over again.
Not so. In spite of their fine air of sangfroid, these gallant
fellows, who would rush a Bosch machine gun or lead a
night raid without a qualm or a quickening of the heart,
conceal within them—or so I imagine—that sinking feeling
which is commonly experienced by those who enter a bank
without full confidence in the state of their balance.
I sympathise with them, for I can share their morbid
fears and appreciate their desire to postpone the ordeal as
long as possible. In me a bank induces a feeling of awe
the like of which I do not experience in Westminster Abbey
or St. Peter's, and a banker in his sanctum seems more
impressive than the Lord Chancellor in his robes of office.
Even when I have no haunting fears that I may be over-
drawn, I shrink instinctively from entering the bank, and
find cashing a cheque almost as great an ordeal as having
a tooth stopped.
Whether, since a recent extraordinary experience, my
strange dread will now leave me and I shall be able to
swagger into my bank, as I have seen City men do, toss a
cheque across the counter, exchange airy greetings with the
cashier, and accept my money with an air of magnificent
nonchalance, time alone can prove. As it is, I am still
shaken by my adventure.
Truly, it was a very disturbing experience. I needed
money—a goodly sum—and was compelled to visit the
bank instead of cashing a cheque at the club. I strode into
the place with an air of bravado, determined not to be
intimidated by the atmosphere and the marble pillars; but
the sight of women-clerks made me even more nervous than
usual, and I know I must have worn a furtive air as I
wrote my cheque.
A handsome young lady accepted it, and when she
glanced at my signature she started visibly, gazed hard at
me, then hastened away to whisper excitedly to an elderly
man engaged in solemnly turning the pages of a ponderous
volume. He in turn looked at me searchingly and strolled
across to whisper to a radiant girl with red hair who seemed
to be brooding over another huge ledger.
I wilted beneath their combined gaze and my heart began
to fail me. Obviously something was seriously wrong.
Wild thoughts flashed through my mind. My account
was overdrawn; someone had been forging my signature;
or possibly I had written so badly in my nervousness that
I was myself mistaken for a forger. It seemed certain
... that I had in some way transgressed the laws of the bank
and was a marked man. I was already meditating flight
when the handsome young lady returned to the counter.
“The manager wishes to see you, Sir," she announced
with a strange smile, still eyeing me curiously.
As she spoke she signalled to a burly porter in livery and
instructed him to conduct me to the manager's office. To
me it seemed she had something of the air of a President of
a Field Court-Martial who had just sentenced a prisoner
to be shot at dawn and was ordering the guards to remove
the poor wretch to the cells.
Vague ideas of making a desperate dash for the door, of
appealing for mercy or attempting to overpower the porter,
darted through my brain; but I remembered I was a
Briton and innocent, and determined to see the thing
through.
Three minutes later I stood in the manager's sanctum,
pale, nervous, but fairly collected, prepared for the worst,
yet wishing fervently I had followed my grandmother's
example and kept my money in a stocking instead of
entrusting it to a joint-stock bank. ** *
I met the manager's glance apprehensively as he rose
quickly from his chair, resisted an inclination to recoil as
he advanced, and fought down an impulse to struggle when
he seized my hand., - - - -
“Delighted to meet you, Sir!” exclaimed the manager
with a beaming smile. “I have read some of your work,
and when I found you were one of our clients. I told the
cashier to ask you to step in when next you called. I wanted
to make your acquaintance, if you will forgive me. Won't
you sit down 2"
He wrung my hand again, and I sat down limply, trying
to recover myself while he discoursed on books and authors,
and assured me how greatly something I had written had
impressed him. I made some nervously fatuous remarks,
told him I was proud to meet the man who had bought a
copy of my book, and escaped after shaking hands again.
I had sufficient presence of mind left to collect my money
on my way out, and when the handsome young lady slid
the notes across the counter to me she slid across at the
same time an autograph album.
“I am sure you won't mind writing a line,” she said with
a ravishing smile. “I shall treasure it.”
What I wrote then I suppose I shall never know, but the
lady seemed pleased, and I passed out with head erect, con-
scious that whenever I enter the bank I shall be pointed out
as The-Man-Who-Wrote-The-Book-That-The-Manager-
Read.
Nevertheless I am still suffering a little from cheque-shock.

From the canyon where pools of the White River foam.
Your thirty-pound salmon sent ne'er such a thrill
Through the proud man that played him by Rutherford

As is throbbing this moment right home to the heart
Of the tiniest angler from Tummel to Dart.
Your seven-pound trout had no power as a prize
To kindle such light in his conqueror's eyes
As is lit in the deeps of those blue ones that gaze
On “the trout that I catched"—on this day of all days.

That atom of silver that gleams in the grass. W. H. O.

PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“MOTHER, I THINK I'LL Go To sleep Now.
BE SURE TO WAKE ME UP, WON'T YOU, WHEN I WANT ANOTHER sweeT."
A PIG'S GREETING.
LAST Spring, when the Germans
became greatly offensive, War invaded
many a placid depôt that had never
thought to receive so ugly, a visitor.
Well behind the front line, ours had
rested more or less immune from its
touch. Now, however, we could almost
hear the tramp of Jerry's hosts. “We
shall have to break up the happy home,”
said our O.C. in effect; and the farm-
labour of the winter months was undone
in an hour. Rabbits, ducks and wad-
dling turkeys—dignified even in their
alarm—were rounded up and slain by
Tommies who thirsted for blood and
had no prospect for the moment of
tasting the German brand. Not much
was left alive for the enemy when we
had finished.
The same evening the Mess sat downto
such a meal as is nowadays but dreamed
of. In the manner peculiar to his kind,
Mac, our Mess President, had gone forth
and gathered the pick of the wines of
a dozen cafés whose proprietors had
been only too glad to take the cash in
hand and waive the rest; and the Major
had found time to re-read LAMB's
“Dissertation on Roast Pig" as an
apéritif. Everyone savoured that our
exit was being conducted with the
requisite aplomb.
“This is my masterpiece,” observed
Mac complacently. “The greenest
laurel in my abundant wreath.”
But alas for human hopes just as
the piglet was brought in, gorgeous in
all its garnishings, the scurry of a
motor-bike was heard. The Major read
the despatch that was brought to
him : “Evacuate personnel at once.”
Abruptly he broke the tidings and we
knew that our dinner was sacrificed.
“Are we going to leave all this be-
hind for Fritz 2 cried Mac. “What a
horrible war !”
“The blighter 'll have a square meal
for once, that 's all,” said the Major,
shrugging his shoulders in resignation.
“Very annoying and all that ; but
better a dinner of herbs where love is,
my son, than roast - pork and high-
explosive hatred therewith.”
In the midst of the labours of evac-
uation a car brought the General and
Staff of the Division which was fighting
over that sector. The General's troops
were even then drawing back towards
the ordered paths of the depôt ; but
when he opened conversation with our
O.C. he thought it worthy of mention
that it was damned hot. Destiny
ordained that he should add: “Makes
one so peckish too. I haven't fed for
twenty-four hours.”

THE CALL.
THERE's an office back in London, and the dusty sunlight
falls -
With its swarms of dancing motes across the floor,
On the piles of books and papers and the drab distempered
walls -
And the bowlers on their pegs behind the door.
There's an office-stool in London where a fellow used
to sit -
(But the chap that used to sit there's oversea);
There's a job they're keeping open till that fellow's done
his bit,
And the one that job is waiting for is—Me!
And it may be black ingratitude, but oh, Good Lord, I know
I could never stick the office-life again,
With the coats and cuffs and collars and the long hours
crawling slow
And the quick lunch and the same old morning-train;
I have looked on Life and Death and seen the naked soul
of man,
And the heart of things is other than it seemed,
And the world is somehow larger than the good old office
plan,
And the ways of earth are wider than I dreamed.
There's a chap in the Canadians—a clinking good chap
too—
And he hails from back o' nowhere in B.C.,
And he says it's sure some country, and I wonder if it's
true,
And I rather fancy that's the place for me.
There's a trail I mean to follow and a camp I mean to share
Out beyond the survey, up in Cassiar,
For there's something wakened in me that I never knew
was there,
And they'll have to find some other chap to fill that
vacant chair - -
When the boys come marching homeward from the War.

A PLEA For HospitaLITY.
Nobody, Mr. Punch believes, would care to think that
any soldier from overseas who is fighting our battles finds
himself lonely and neglected in London when he is on leave
from the Front. To offer entertainment to the guests
within our gates, so that they may have a sense of com-
radeship and feel themselves at home, is the object of the
Overseas Hospitality Fund. Its agencies arrange excursions
about the Mother City and its neighbourhood under qualified
guides; visits to theatres and museums; receptions in
private houses. In one way or another some 25,000 over-
seas soldiers have been entertained. . Offers of hospitality
would be very gratefully received; but the chief need is
money to meet the growing claims upon the Fund. Every
penny subscribed goes directly to the entertainment of our
visitors, all help being given freely. It is a service that
finds ample recompense in the appreciation shown by those
who accept it. Mr. Punch's own recollection of a visit
which a party of overseas soldiers did him the honour to pay
to his Mahogany Tree is that he got far more than he gave.
Contributions to the Fund (of which Lord DENMAN is Hon.
Treasurer) should be sent to the Hon. Auditors, Messrs.
Woodhouse AND WILKINson, 28, Queen Street, E.C.

TANTALUS EN VOYAGE.
IT is generally agreed that, although
doubtless God could easily have made
a more exciting flavour than the mush-
room's, doubtless He never did. Hence
the heightened pulses when this most
desirable of fungi begin to appear (after
a blend of hot sun and a little rain in
August) and the lifted dish-cover reveals
the unfamiliar ecstasy of stewed or
fried. For the mushroom should be
served alone; those cooks who consider
it an adjunct to other food do not know.
News that the season had begun,
with unusual suddenness and in great
abundance, was reaching us from vari-
the meadow next to my home, which,
although I don't happen to rent it, is
obviously more mine by sheer right of
proximity than any one else's, except
the farmer, who sensibly looks upon all
mushrooms as toadstools (or toads'
meat as he confusedly but very luckily
calls it)—in this meadow the Vicar him-
self has been seen in the small hours
suspiciously peering and stooping,
whereas he has no fewer than five mead-
ows of his own. The Vicar, the ap-
pointed custodian of our souls, the indi-
cator of the road to virtue! I ask you.
Legally he is within his rights; but
morally? Decently? No. For although
it is true, owing to some short-sighted
ous quarters; but we had
no luck ourselves. Round

(satiety') the economy was

we ourselves had no luck.
Capricious things, mush-
rooms; they will grow in
one meadow like daisies,
while in those all around
it, where the conditions
would seem to be precisely
similar, never a sign of one.
And there is something
besides mere caprice, too;
there is, alas! the greed of
man. And not only the
greed, but the inhuman

Then we reached a station where a
London paper could be obtained, and I
had that. Then, disregarding the book
I had brought, I began to look out of
the window, at first listlessly, but later
with intense interest, for I was gradually
conscious that the meadows were full
of mushrooms. Although the hour was
between ten and eleven, mushrooms
were still there, and so plentiful as to
catch the eye even in an express train.
More than catch it—bemuse it, madden
it. The situation became almost un-
bearable. I thought of the liſted covers
of dishes, I thought of the stewed and

mind's eye exactly how
those big white ones would

rible thought. This won-

and yet so far ! For the
train was tearing along and
we were not due to pause
again for many miles.

a ray of hope, for I caught
sight of the communication

it? I could pull it, scramble
out, pick as many mush-
– rooms as I could eat—and
willing to put himself in
order to gratify his palate. Honour
—even unselfishness—there may be
among thieves (so complex are we')
but I assure you that there is none
among mushroom-gatherers; not, at
any rate, about us. Why it should
be so is an ethnographical problem
which I am incapable of solving, but
the fact remains that in our neighbour-
hood there are people who actually
take pleasure in getting up at four in
order to pick the mushrooms which
otherwise would be picked by those who
get up at five or, more reasonably, like
myself now and then, at six. Surely
six should be early enough With
such competition how can one enjoy a
savour which was clearly intended to
be equally for the benefit of all?
To indicate to what lengths the appe-
tite for mushrooms will take people, let
me herewith place it on record that in
legislation that has never been corrected
(and we give the impostors £400 a year
apiece'), mushrooms may—unless it
can be proved that they are under
scientific cultivation—be trespassed for
without the normal consequent prose-
cution, yet none the less there should
be a certain respect for prescriptive
rights. The contiguity of residences
should be sympathetically considered
and Preferential treatment should be
given to people in the immediate neigh-
bourhood, whether they are prepared
to get up before six or not. The world
however having got into a very bad
state, the fact remains that I have had
no mushrooms yet. Either they are
not growing hereabouts (but rumour
says otherwise) or infamously early
risers secure the whole harvest.
But that is not all.
all for a fiver !
The other day I had to visit town,
Was it worth it? I
had as a matter of fact five pounds
with me to spend on books; but what
are books? Dooks may be made of
paper that is white, but when they are
cooked do they shrivel and turn black
and distil amazing and indescribably
alluring essences? I rose and reached
for the cord, but at that moment we
rushed into a tunnel, and when we
emerged the whole country was changed
and barren.
That evening, in London, I had some
mushrooms at a restaurant. But mush-
rooms at a restaurant are useless.

“HIMMEL! THE ALL-HIGHEST HAS THE TRUTH SPOKEN-THE WORST IS BEHIND US."
TO A PAN-CELT.
I HAVE an ancient friend, a placid man
Who hands the plate and adds his
modest shilling,
Sound on the War and, since it first
began,
Averse alike from BERNARD SHAw
and BILLING:
Yet he has turned a votary of Pan—
Pan with an eminently modern fril-
ling;
To be precise, he now by day and night is
Afflicted by persistent Panceltitis.
Pan had his merits as a piper, though
His conduct was occasionally trying;
For great Panjandrum still inspires a
glow
Of reverence and sympathy undying;
Pancakes, a dish beloved by high and
low,
Are palatable, wholesome, satisfying;
But as a prefix Pan has lapsed from
grace
Since its adoption by a bestial race.
How the Pan-Celts propose to serve
the State
I haven't got the foggiest of notions,
Unless it be a help to stimulate
Vague local aspirations and devotions,
Promote bilingualism in debate
And foster strange crepuscular emo-
tions;
But when the world is in the pot of
melting
I find it otiose to go Pan-Celting.
Meanwhile my friend writes letters,
stacks on stacks,
About the coming neo-Manx re-
vival,
Or prophesies to ardent O's and Macs
A super-OssiaN's imminent arrival.
He finds in Erse what simple English
lacks,
Glamour and picturesqueness adjec-
tival;
Attends Eisteddfods, is immensely
thrilled,
And advocates a Cornish-speaking guild.
A harmless hobby? Not perhaps with
all
Of these convinced vernacular cam-
paigners,
For some who pit the Gael against the
“Gall”
Are more or less, and mostly more,
Sinn Feiners;
But others, dressed in kilts and sandals,
fall
Into the blameless class of boot-ab-
stainers;
And my old friend, when all is said and
done,
Has sent three boys to help to smash
the Hun.
THE LUXURY TAX.
A coRRESPONDENT suggests the fol-
lowing addenda to articles taxable
under the above head:—
Anglers to pay one shilling in the
pound on every salmon over eighteen
pounds caught in the smoking-room.
Burglars to pay twopence in the
shilling on every silver article stolen
from a town residence and a penny in
the shilling if stolen from a country
residence, the reduction being made in
view of additional cost of transport.
Villains in melodrama to pay two-
and-sixpence for every murder com-
mitted at each performance in excess
of three, and heroes for every hair-
breadth escape in excess of five.
Music-hall comedians to pay one
shilling per mother-in-law used at each
performance and three-halfpence each
for kippers, however frayed at the edges.

A GENTLEMAN’S WAR.
To those who have been on any of
the Fronts the chief interest of a picture
intended to represent a scene or episode
of the War lies in the chance of recog-
nising the precise spot. After spending
several of the best years of my life on
the Western Front, I took the trouble to
cross the street the other day to study
a War picture displayed in a window,
driven not by a yearning to see more
war, but by this curious desire to
locate the spot chosen by the artist as
worthy of reproduction and to find what
sort of recognisable incident had fired
his imagination. But in spite of all
my wanderings and experiences this
picture beat me.
The smooth condition of the
landscape suggested that it be:
longed to some training area, but
this surmise was made absurd by
the heavy shelling going on in
the neighbourhood. A big gun,
drawn by a stylish team, was
crossing the middle distance at a
rattling pace, its appearance sug-
gesting that it had wandered
into the battle zone, having lost
its way to a “turn-out” compe-
tition and so forfeited a certain
first.
I could not imagine what oc-
casion was supposed to have
collected in such an unhealthy
locality the remarkably repre:
sentative group of British officers
forming the human interest of ,
the picture. Shells were burst-
ing within easy splinter-flight,
but the artist had not permitted

—at his very elbow. Perhaps the regu-

fit of their uniforms were supposed to
have melted his heart towards them.
The best dressed of the lot—if there
might be comparison where all were
perfect—were two youngsters (obviously
twins) belonging to the R.A.F. They
were standing aloof, watching, without
the astonishment it was calculated to
excite, a quite unprecedented type of
aeroplane cruising overhead.
The boots of all these officers shone
with spotless lustre; their uniforms
were without stain or crease save for
the ideal knife-edge exhibited by those
who had paraded in slacks. As for the

—the title “Military Uniforms.”
NATURE MUSINGS A LA MODE.
BY our SUMMER DIARIst.
August 15th.-This is a halcyon day,
and to measure its charms aright one
should spend it on the banks of a river.
The stillness is wellnigh unbroken, save
for the distant drone of an aeroplane or
the buzz of a motor-tractor; the voice of
universal Nature is subdued to a pian-
issimo. Suddenly a kingfisher shoots
across the pool, like a living jewel,
snaps an insect from the glassy
surface and shoots on, leaving at
the point of contact a nest of con-
centric rings which widen and
widen until they are smoothed
away into the calm. No trout
are rising, but a water-rat plops
into the stream, and at intervals
the scuffle of dabchicksis heard.
|But the birds are strangely
hushed to-day. Even the robin's
engaging impudence yields to
the prevailing languor. We miss
the cuckoo's “two-fold shout,”
but cuckoos are rarely, if ever,
heard in August, even by writers
of Nature Notes. It is sad to
think that the swifts are due to
leave us so soon, but an inexor-
able law ordains that migrants
must migrate; meanwhile the
peewits wheel overhead and, in
spite of their plaintive cries, life
must be very pleasant and full
for them up there, untroubled by
|food shortage or the need of keep-
|ing a diary. Below, all creatures
pride, to exhibit the slightest
emotional disturbance of their notably
regular features.
The officers were grouped in front of a
very carelessly camouflaged piece of ord-
nance unfamiliar to me. One of them, an
immaculately dressed padre, was stand-
ing so close to the muzzle as to be in
imminent danger, of which the superb
gunner-major, not far away, ought cer-
tainly to have warned him. It occurred
to me however that perhaps the artist
wished to depict this officer as malici-
ously expectant of the nasty jar shortly
to be received by the statuesque non-
combatant whose toilet and features
seriously rivalled his own. The Major,
who had turned out wearing a sword,
was talking to a splendidly-plumaged
Brigadier with a similar taste for fancy.
dress. The artist had shown this eccen-
tric Brigadier quite unmoved by the
conversation of three subalterns — a
sapper, an infantier and a tank-wallah
as yeoboys, with all youth's illusions,
used to dream about in pre-war days.
Their indifference to the mud on which
they were standing was explained by
the fact that it was very nice mud, not
the ordinary G.S. stuff supplied with
most landscapes I know. Was it pos-
sible that the artist was satirising some
more successful brother of the palette 2
Was this intended to be a group of
officers who, having heard that a certain
ſashionable portrait-painter was touring
the Front, had deserted their posts and
made appointments with him all at
the same hour?
Anyhow, I envied the painter who
in fact or fancy had been privileged to
witness such a scene in such a locality,
and who knew such a bevy of officers
with nice regular features and admirable
batmen. Had I been asked to find a
title for this problem-picture I think it
would have been “The Cadet's Dream ”
seem to be taking a rest-cure.
| The moles abate their strenuous labours,
but a colony of red ants, on which I
have inadvertently intruded, resent the
encroachment, their massed attack re-
minding me of Gulliver among the
Lilliputians. Waves of shadow, as
dear old TENNYsoN says, pass over the
wheat, but even the wheat has no voice
to-day; not a sound in all that forest
of the staff of life. A cow moos gently
in an adjoining field. The day is built
up of just such little incidents, not
exactly soul-shaking, but none the less
infinitely helpful as supplying useful
grist to the mill of the Summer diarist.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MARSHAL.
YES, it was the Marshal who did it, and when I say
“Marshal” I must be understood to mean the great Marshal
Foch, who has been driving the Germans back helter-skelter
towards the place where they belong. Of course the Marshal
has no notion of his responsibility for my affairs. Like the
gallant gentleman he is, he is all for fighting. He will never
be aware, unless he should happen to be a careful reader of
these pages, that it was his influence which put a stop to an
embittered domestic controversy and sent a British family
to the seaside. -
It happened in this way. Dad and Mum said they had
made up their minds. There was to be no seaside this
year, or, rather, the seasides might be as many as usual,
but there was one thing certain about them all, which was
that we were going to pay none of them a visit. Soon
after the discussion began, Mum basely deserted Dad, and
left him as it were high and dry on an inland desert. She
was moved to this abandonment, she said, by the sight
of the children's faces. “Look,” she said, “how pale they
are. They must have a change.” And as sea air produced
red and glowing complexions in the quickest time, to the
seaside they must go. On the other hand, Dad said that
nothing could move him. He was sure that results as good
could be produced by staying at home as by going to
that place which showed the largest percentage of ozone.
“Besides,” he added, “things are different now. The family
is growing up with extraordinary rapidity, and the old
pleasures of the seaside pall on them.” (Loud dissent of
the younger members.)
It was all very well to make a noise like that, but had they
considered the tremendous expense, and that at a time
when the Income Tax stood at six shillings in the pound,
and when the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER was shouting
at them from every hoarding or insinuating himself into
their confidence with every dividend warrant and urging
and Dad was urged to remember that this particular family
had abstained from the seaside last year at his special
request, and therefore must have saved something with
which they could meet the financial strain. The fact was,
said Mum, that Dad owed them all a visit, and that it was
the duty of a father to fulfil all his promises, even if it was
temporarily difficult for him to do so. To this Dad replied
that the promise about the seaside was rashly given in order
to make last year's abstention easier for all of them. Any-
how they were not going to the seaside this year, and there
was an end of it.
Then suddenly came Marshal Foch's great stroke. The
Germans were sent pell-mell to the right-about, and things
kept on happening in the most marvellous way at several
points of the Front. Dad's face cleared as soon as he read
the morning paper. “Children,” he said, “I have been
thinking it over, and I believe it is just humanly possible
for us to go to the seaside this year. And mind whenever
you build a sand-castle, when you bathe in the sea, when
you catch prawns, when you go out fishing, when you see
a dead star-fish, you must return thanks inwardly to Marshal
Foch for having made these things necessary for your health
and desirable for your souls.”
And thus it comes about that we are due at the seaside
to-morrow, and are to occupy our old lodgings of the year
before last. Some things, of course, there are of which we
never shall recapture the first fine careless rapture. We
shall never, for instance (“we” being the younger members
of the party), be carefully dressed by the nursemaid and set
out each on a different chair against the wall, so as to be
out of the way while the last inches of packing are being
completed. Was there ever anything in the world so stiff
as those legs which protruded from every chair? And
then the gloves, worn as preventers of smudginess! They
looked more frightfully inappropriate than anything else
which could be worn on a child's person. Still, they were
the nursemaid's idea of high-toned respectability.
But, gloved or gloveless, we are for the seaside to-morrow
—thanks to Marshal Foch.

“THEY Do, BUT NOT AT Home.

PAPA's BALANCE IS AT THE BANK."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
PERHAPs more than any of those young and gracious
figures sacrificed in the war RUPERT BRookE has taken
hold of popular imagination. So the appearance of the
long-promised Collected Poems and Memoir (SIDGwick AND
JAckson) will find many readers anxious for some personal
sketch of one whose brilliance and the circumstance of his
death have made him famous not only as a poet but as a
symbol. Those of us who remember RUPERT BRooKE
differently will perhaps best appreciate how well Mr.
Edward MARSH (revealed here only by initials) has carried
out his task of friendship. The result is an admirable
picture of one whom the gods loved and gifted generously.
Somewhere RUPERT BROOKE confessed, in one of those
flashes of self-amusement so characteristic of him, to the
happy consciousness that when he came into a room where
there were new people “the chances were that they would
like him.” If there is any sound of conceit in this nothing
could be more remote from his character. Never was any-
one more youthfully delighted with success or less spoilt
by it. Adulation (and he had much) he would meet with a
mingling of gratitude and a wholesome derision that purged
it of all danger; one has heard that almost his last words
were a jest at his own increasing fame. It was in talk
that he found his easiest expression, but, though lacking
the help of a radiant presence, his letters, of which there
are many here, reveal him intimately as full of kindli-
ness and mirth and all generous enthusiasms. RUPERT
BROOKE spoke once with the voice of England, because in
him were embodied all that we like to think most typical of
her sons. In this book, that holds both his short life and
his work, you have two memorials—one written by those
who loved him, the other by himself.
Mr. GALsworthy's Five Tales (HEINEMANN) shows no
falling off in that fastidious—almost over-fastidious—crafts-
manship, that sense of pity—almost, if that were possible,
exaggerated pity—for the unfortunate, that unmeasured
disapproval of respectability which his admirers know so
well. The first of the sheaf tells how a murderer proves a
better man than his barrister brother; the second, how a
fallen captain of industry and obstinate gourmand outwits
his enemies by an original and to him congenial form of
suicide; the third is an exquisite idyll of first-love with a
faintly cynical ending; the fourth describes the conversion
of a stockbroker through sitting on a jury—all excellent
fare. But I would sacrifice them cheerfully for the last
bonne bouche, “Indian Summer of a Forsyte,” a pendant to
that finest of the author's novels, The Man of Property.
Old Jolyon, the only decent Forsyte, finds a new lease of
life and the long-forgotten flavour of romance in his friend-
ship for Irene. This will be something obscure to those
who don't know their Man of Property. But can there be
any such 2 I think Mr. GALsworthy immensely enjoyed
this going over of happily remembered ground, and he
communicates that enjoyment to the reader.
How long ago is it, I wonder, since the evening when I
found myself very pleasantly confronted by some mountain
scenery, embellishing a comedy of courtship between, I
think, Mr. H. B. IRVING and Miss IRENE WANBRUGH 2 At
all events it was sufficiently long ago to give me an oddly

dream-like sensation on finding the dim intrigue of that
evening refashioning itself in the pages of the latest, if not
newest ANTHONY HoPE story, Captain Dieppe. All which, of
course, simply means that the author, like most prudent
dramatists nowadays, has decided to emulate the thrush
and tell his tale twice over. Or shall we say thrice, for I
understand — though the publishers (SKEFFINGTON) say
nothing on the subject—that it appeared many years ago in
a Summer Number of The Illustrated London News 2 An
admirably bustling tale it is, too, of an adventurous captain,
a matrimonial tangle, some fighting, and a love interest
which, just when you think it can't possibly come right,
suddenly springs a surprise upon you, and ends as the love
affairs of gallant adventurers always should. I have a
recollection of wondering why the stage version of this
agreeable little affair enjoyed but moderate success; perhaps
in visible action it was difficult to render plausible the de-
ception by which—but I must be careful; the secret was
nearly out then. Anyhow, as a holiday companion who
makes no pretence at more than entertainment for your idle
moments Captain Dieppe should, I think, come at length by
by-ways, foremost in her love for England, for divorce, for
hospitality, for chatter and for good fare. With apologies,
but with almost too urgent an intention of calling a spade
at least a spade and perhaps a spade and a half, the author
presents her as the most prone to adipose tissue, mental
and physical. The clue to the whole he finds in a certain
lack of temperament, of nationalistic and sporting instinct,
of anything, in fact, beyond the bread-and-butter (the best
bread-and-butter) outlook. Though I have read Mr. DEs-
Mond's book with the keenest enjoyment and appreciation
of its literary excellence, it is to be confessed that the con-
tinued absence of the expected chapter on Denmark and the
War was annoying. The author admits that the moral
changes due to war are hardly less apparent there than
here, but her attitude toward the Bosch is unstated. He is
clearly too well informed not to know all about it, so per-
haps it is that Denmark really has no attitude. But one
had thought that there waited, amongst other round-table
problems, a question of Schleswig-Holstein.

of their kind. Indeed Mr.

zines. Mr. Roberts is one of the few, and in such stories as
“The Disintegration of Apilene Bill” and “The Resurrection
of Beardy Thompson " we have the style as well as the
atmosphere of BRET HARTE and his successors. In “The
Acting Duchess” and “The Ace of Hearts" again we have
a touch of that farcical humour that made Lady Penelope
a perfect cure for the blues. But it is the first and last
stories in the volume, “The Man who lost his Likeness”
and “The Madonna of the Beech Wood,” that will endear
the author to his readers new and old. Pure idylls, they
carry us into that charming land of half-realities, of tree
magic and wind mystery, that still beckons to the grown-
up children of the world. - -
I should never have believed that one little country could
contain so many superlatives as Mr. SHAw DESMOND piles
together in his study, The Soul of Denmark (FishBR
UNWIN). Denmark, it appears, is not only the most demo-
cratic country in the world, but also the least socialistic;
the most co-operative as well as the most individualist.
That is a pretty good start; but, further, she is the best
educated and the laziest, the most sceptical and the most
laughter-loving, and, through all manner of paradoxical
will suffer if he is to be obsessed by one idea.
The thousands of friends that Miss Rose FYLEMAN

DEMOCRACY ON ITS TRIAL.
[Showing how the behaviour of certain
slackers and strikers appears to a soldier who
belongs to the so-called “privileged classes,”
and has been reminded that he is fighting in
order to “make the world safe for democracy.”]
HE chanced to come of ancient birth;
His fathers called the King their liege;
In open field they proved their worth ;
Their legend ran, “Noblesse oblige; "
Like them he keeps his scutcheon fair,
Proud of the line his kin can trace,
But prouder still to be the heir
Of loyalty to land and race.
They did not nicely weigh the laws
That govern abstract right and
wrong; -
But, wrong or right, for England's cause
They went to battle with a song;
He too, for her—no question made—
Would give his body to the dust,
Yet is his faith more firmly stayed
Knowing at heart her cause is just.
Heavy on him, as on his peers,
The War has fallen; yet his pride,
Unenvious of the profiteers,
Makes light of fortune's ebbing tide;
Only at times he tends to chaſe
A little when his weary eye
Pictures the goal—a world made safe
For democrats to occupy.
These future masters of the State—
He sees them loaf in shop and mine
When on their labour hangs the fate
Of England in the fighting line;
And wishes, while their ease they take
And life “out there" is deadly grim,
Democracy would try to make
The world a bit more safe for him.
He sees them strike for softer tasks,
And “If such things are done in War,
What will they do in Peace,” he asks,
“The Peace that I am fighting for 2"
Not less he fights—be sure of that—
For honour and, if God so please,
The chance that your true democrat
May be of better stuff than these.

JUST as I was getting off to sleep the

“Off"cer wants you, Sergint.”
I finds him sitting on a tipped-up
ammunition-box throwing stones into
the wadi below.
“Well, Sergeant,” ses he, “an out-
break of peace seems threatened.”
That's rather a favourite joke of his,
so I turns on my laugh-officers' jokes,
for the use of and waits. - “In other
words,” he goes on, “here's a chit come
round headed “Demobilisation.’ Please
ensure that each man's trade and class
is entered in his pay-book. Fall in the
platoon in the fig-garden, where they'll
be under cover."
So I falls them in and tells them to
get out their pay-books and make up
their minds what trade they belongs to,
some of them not being very sure of it,
never having had one. Just as I goes
off to fetch the officer I hears Johnson
(who used to be attached to Brigade
H.Q. and knows a lot) saying some-
thing about going home first, but it
didn't strike me as anything out of the
way at the time.
Well, the officer comes along and gets
to work at once.

Barnes and Berry steps out.
“What's your trade, Barnes?" he
asks.
“Engineer, Sir.”
“What sort 2"

he didn't seem too sure about it.
“Berry 2”
Berry has got ploughman written all
over him. Red face, clumsy walk, huge
hands, and a devil to work.
“What for you, Berry 2"
“Eh, Sir?"
“What trade?”
“Plough—I mean engineer, Sir."
“General, electrical or marine 2"
“Er, er—the last, Sir.”
“Stop that laughing. Any more B's?
C's 2 D's 2 Well, Devlin, what's your
trade 2"
“Soldier, Sir.” -
“Yes, yes, but what were you before
you came out here?"
“Soldier, Sir.”
“Yes, I know. But what I mean is,
what were you before the War?"
“Soldier, Sir.”
“What—can't you—" Then he
spots the three good conduct stripes on
Devlin's arm. “Oh, I see. Sorry, Dev-
lin, but it's so rare to find a soldier in
the army nowadays, you know.”
Well, by the time we gets to the
J's there'd been seven engineers, one
But
farm-labourer, a soldier and a tic-tac,
which, as the officer remarked, wasn't
a bad average of skilled trades for an
agricultural district. There was some
trouble about the tic-tac; the officer
wanted to put him down as a riveter's
mate, until Henderson tells him that
his job was on the race-course and not
in the shipping yards, and that he came
in the same class as artists' models—
which we found to be O.K.
“Any J's 2"
Jeffries and Johnson steps out.
“Well, Jeffries 2"
“Hengineer, Sir."
I gives a cough just to remind Jeffries,
who comes from the same place as me,
that I know what he really does do.
“Leastways not quite a hengineer,
Sir. I drive a milk-cart, Sir.”
“You're quite right, Jeffries; hardly
an engineer. What do you think, Ser-
geant 2 Carter or dairyman 2 John-
son 2''
“Engineer, Sir."
“What '''
“Engineer, Sir.”
“What sort 2 ''
“Just the ordinary sort, Sir.”
“Do you remember what happened
to ANANIAs and SAPPHIRA” They lived
quite close here.”
“It's true, Sir; honest."
“Then how is it you went to Brigade
Headquarters as a chef ?”
Johnson goes a bit green, and in the
end he was put down as a chef and got
seven days' sanitary fatigues into the
bargain. After that there weren't half
the number of engineers, and the job
gets finished in no time, and I goes
back to my bivvy for forty winks.
When I wakes up there was the
whole ruddy lot of engineers sitting on
top of something which turns out to be
Johnson.
“What the hell's up?" I asks Barnes
as he came up for a breather.
“That Johnson, he tells us that
engineers is going to be the first class
home. Well, we're all ploughmen or
farm-hands, but we calls ourselves en-
gineers, except Gibb, who says he was
a farm-labourer, and Henderson, who
called himself a tic-tac, and the off"cer
puts the two down Class 1 and us
Class 27."
With which Barnes turns round and
goes for the only part of Johnson that
wasn't getting attended to, which hap-
pened to be the top of his head.

CALL YOUR HUSBAND.”
Child (who has been made much of ly father home on leave for first time for two years). “MUMMY DEAR, I LIKE THE MAN You
THE ALIEN QUESTION.
ABOUT three months ago the powers
that try to be decided I could do my
bit in the Great Stunt by living in a
little cottage which formed the centre-
piece of an old-word garden trimmed
with roses and honeysuckle. I believe
I am officially supposed to do other
things besides live, but my category is
such that this takes up most of my
time.
Sweetheart and I lived an idyllic
existence here; but now this has all
come unstuck. The serpent, or a cousin
of his, has walked into our Eden and
blighted our young lives.
Behind Matchbox Castle, which was
our country seat, there was a field of
clover, and last month a gang of Ger-
man prisoners came and cut it. I had
suspicions in the morning that all was
not A 1, to speak categorically, for
my shoes had been moved from the
place where I had paraded them over-
night and had been badly bitten. Ex-
amination by the BERTILLON methods
failed to fix the teeth-marks on to any
of the family when they came in to
breakfast, and I was wondering who
sweetheart shrieked in E in alt—“Ooh
There's a blackbeetle !”
It was even so, and he was just
sparring for wind in the second round
with the cat. In the end his superior
defence won, and he planted himself
down in front of the kitchen fire and
started to wash himself. He was the
advance guard of hordes of these fierce
animals that have come to stay with
us, driven from their home in the clover-
field by the Hun attacks.
They have established a reign of
terror that makes Russia look like a
Sunday-school treat. One waited on
the milk-boy and bit him so that he
dropped the milk, and they thereupon
lapped it up with great gusto. I could
tell the guilty one by the fact that he'd
got bits of trousers sticking round his
whiskers. They read the morning paper
before we get up, and if they don't agree
with the leading articles they tear it up.
I am almost afraid to have The Daily
Mail; it makes them so peeved.
One of them walks about now with a
large bump on his head that I caused
with a coal-hammer when he pinched
a chop representing a week's coupons.
He's the biggest of all, and the ugliest.
on earth could have done it, when We call him Ludendorff, because he
orders the others about. I've an idea
that if I can get him alone and murder
him I shall shake their moral. I shot
at him yesterday with a pistol, but
the bullet bounced off and punctured a

The gardener gave me specifications

they crawl up, and when they are on

AUNTIE'S OATH.
AFTER many attempts and as many
misgivings—perhaps indeed one more
misgiving than attempt—Auntie ob-
tained an appointment as an author-
ised helper of the American Red Cross
in France, and was at last sufficiently
furnished with the necessaries of that
calling to be ready to leave.
If you knew Auntie you would under-
stand what her friends have been through
these last few weeks; but as you are so
unfortunate as not to know the sweetest
and gentlest creature on earth, and the
most utterly lacking in any capacity for
furthering her own interests, fighting
for her own hand, feathering her own
nest or performing any of the other
myriad self-protective acts—although
tireless in her efforts for others' ad-
vancement and happiness and comfort
—let me say that she is very small and
fragile-looking, very liable to mistrust
in herself, and so diffident and so unwil-
ling to give trouble, that for a ruder
spirit to go shopping with her, for ex-
ample, is to suffer positive agony. Not
the kind of helper needed in a war hos-
pital, you might think; but there you
would be wrong, for Auntie can be a
lion of strength where duty is.
ordeal of the passport office was to be
endured, and I went with her to be of
what assistance I could and prevent
any final and irrevocable panic.
The ritual included, in addition to the
usual signatures, a solemn declaration
of acquiescence in a number of regu-
lations drawn up for the guidance of all
American Red Cross assistants. Auntie
began to read it tremblingly; to the
timid feminine eye so terribly formal
was it and so threatening. Nothing
was said about shooting at dawn, but
obviously nothing less than that would
be the destiny of any defaulter.
“But, my dear,” she said, “supposing
that one involuntarily did something
wrong—something that would “give in-
formation to the enemy'? How dread-
ful that would be It would undo all
that I am wanting to do.”
I reassured her, but she read on in
trepidation. And then suddenly she
brightened. -
“I must, of course,” she said, “do
my best; but, at any rate, I can put
my name to this one with perfect con-
fidence. I know I shall never transgress
here, consciously or unconsciously,”
and she pointed to the sixth clause on
the paper:—

Who wrote to the precious TAGORE:

An eccentric C.O. of West Ham
Who was pained by the shortage of jam
Heard that armies and fleets
Had abundance of sweets,
So he went to the Front like a lamb.

Who possessed a political snail;

But emerged when you mentioned The

SULTANAS.
“IT is very strange,” said Mr. Brown
on the way home, “very strange indeed
that the Robinsons should manage so
much better than we do.”
“You may as well say than I do,”
answered Mrs. Brown. “That's what
you mean.”
“Anyone would have imagined there
was no war,” he persisted. “I never
enjoyed a dinner more in my life.”
“What I should like to know,” said
Mrs. Brown bitterly, “is where Mrs.
Robinson got those sultanas. When I
asked the girl at the stores for some
yesterday she was quite rude.”
“Well, you had better find out,” said
Mr. Brown; and this at the earliest op-
portunity Mrs. Brown proceeded to do.
It was tantalizing to learn that Mrs.
Robinson had purchased the sultanas
at the identical stores where her own
vain attempt had been made.
The grocery department was thronged
the following morning and the girls
behind the counters (pretty girls, some
of them) were having a rather busy
time. At last, however, Mrs. Brown
succeeded in making her way to one of
them (the prettiest) and, putting on
her most ingratiating smile, said that
she wanted some sultanas.
“No dried fruit of any kind,” answered
the girl with her head in the air.
“But I know a lady who bought
some here ->
“No dried fruit of any kind this
morning," said the girl, and as Mrs.
Brown turned disconsolately away she
saw Mrs. Robinson enter the grocery
department. But not alone. By her
side was a remarkably good-looking
Second-Lieutenant with his left arm in
a sling. As Mrs. Brown advanced to
open her heart he detached himself
from his companion, making his way
alone to the counter. -
“How very annoying,” said Mrs.
Robinson, in the midst of Mrs. Brown's
lamentations, but she did not appear to
be listening very attentively, her eyes
being fixed on the back of the good-
looking Second-Lieutenant, who was
addressing himself to the prettiest girl.
Mrs. Brown could overhear every word
quite distinctly.
“Good morning,” he said with a
smile ; “what about some sultanas” ”
“How many would you like?” she
answered with gladness in her eye;
and Mrs. Brown turned to glare into
Mrs. Robinson's triumphant face.
“And not five minutes before,” she
remarked to her husband the same
evening, “that wicked girl told methere
was no dried fruit of any kind. I call
it perfectly diabolical.”
“No," said Mr. Brown, “only human."

CHATTER ABOUT WILHELM.
THE enterprise of The Times in secur-
ing the reminiscences of the KAISER's
American dentist (or gum-architect, as
he is called in his native land) is tº
be subject to the usual sincere flattery,
and several other daily papers are
negotiating for similar articles. The
late American AMBAssador in Berlin
having set the example, it is considered
that any divulgence of private matters
is permissible, and an absorbing series
of revelations may be expected shortly.
It has not yet been decided whether,
when they reach book form, to call the
Times disclosures “Inci-dental Talks”
or “Acei-dental Conversations.” “Ivory
and Pearl” has been suggested, but is
thought to err on the poetical side.
It may not be generally known that
the KAISER for many years employed
an American barber—not for his hair,
which was cut by a taciturn native,
but for his moustache. This gentle-
man, whose services are of course no
longer required, is now at home again
and is busy with his reminiscences of
his august client, who now and then,
while the operator was at work, spoke
his mind with an easy freedom which
he will probably have cause to regret.
| An American chiropodist who once at-
tended the KAISER is also engaged in
recording some very valuable recollec-
tions of the EMPEROR, to be published
under the title “Imperial Footnotes;”
the American College of Pedicure, of
which he is an honoured member, having
formally released him from his pro-
fessional oath of secrecy. Editors are
vying with each other for the right to
publish both these manuscripts. And
there are others.
Many publishers have, we are told,
competed for the privilege of issuing
the gum-architect's work in book form.
It is rumoured that the House of DENT
has secured it.
Plans for the filming of the dentist's
narrative, both as entertainment and
propaganda, are in active preparation,
and some such success is hoped for
it as attended Mr. GERARD's famous
work. No one who has not seen the
Ex-AMBAssADoR's story as it is thrown
upon the screen can have any idea of
the Teutonic verisimilitude which can
be obtained by an ingenious producer
in a trans-Atlantic studio. For all
practical purposes it is Berlin itself.
No doubt the molar narrative will
receive equally careful treatment, and
additional interest will be given by the
spectacle of the KAISER in the chair,
beneath the forceps or the drill. The
only fear is that the presentment of him
in such a situation may excite com-
passion here or there in some misguided
breast. Pity is not a feeling to be en-
couraged with regard to the KAISER,
but if ever one experienced it it would
be when watching him at the gum-
architect's mercy and knowing that he
was to be served up on toast in print
afterwards.
Meanwhile we understand that the
KAISER has stated in no ambiguous
terms that if after the War any Amer-
icans are to be given access to him,
from ambassadors downwards, they
must be able neither to read nor write.

CRICKET IN FRANCE.
I Used rather to pride myself on my
gifts as a batsman. Admiring friends
would tell me that my cutting and
glancing were a dream to watch and that
they never saw a man less ruffled and
nervous when approaching the coveted
century.
But I doubt if I shall ever swing the
willow again. My nerve is so shaken
after the other day's Inter-Company
match that I can scarcely sleep at
night, and the sight of cricket gear
makes me shiver all over.
We were just far enough behind the
line to risk a game, though on a clear
day we could see the Hun balloon peep-
ing at us over the ridge. But it was no
fear of Fritz which made me what I
In OW ann.
Of course I captained my Company's
team, and, winning the toss, at once
elected to bat. Private Bloggins and
I walked to the wickets amid general
applause, telling each other confi-
dentially that we hadn't touched a bat
for years, and that really it would be
small wonder if we failed to do justice
to our reputations.
The third ball hit me hard on the
ankle and, trickling on to the stumps,
just dislodged one of the bails. I sat
down the better to nurse my injured
limb; but our opponents, though very
sympathetic, would not overlook the
incident of the bail, and, after a last
appealing look towards the umpire, I
slowly hobbled off the field. This,
however, was but a light affliction
compared with what was to come.
We made rather a poor show on the
whole in spite of a fine hit for sixteen
by Private Smith. On this occasion
the ball got firmly wedged in a neigh-
bouring water-cart and half the team
was ultimately required to effect its
release.
Our total, however, was substantial
enough to give us a sporting chance of
victory and I led my team out to field,
resolved to use all my strategy to keep
the runs down and demoralize the
enemy. Little did I dream how success-
ful I was to be.
Corporal Bouncer was to commence
the attack for us—Bouncer, who had
stood by my side in many a hot corner
and loved me like a brother; Bouncer,
who on this unhappy day was to drag
my honour in the dust.
Two batsmen retired hurt in the first
over. I looked anxiously at Bouncer,
but he would not meet my gaze.
The next batsman arrived well sand-
bagged about the vulnerable parts of
his anatomy. He at once received a
snorter on the elbow, and the man who

followed in took a long hop on the fifth
rib. Both left the wickets in anguish.
The crowd began to get uncomplimen-
tary and the O.C. Company walked
over to me and said, “Excuse my men-
tioning it, old chap, but don't you think
your man is a bit too dangerous for this
wicket 2"
“I quite agree,” I said; “but this is
only his second over, and I can't take
him off till he finishes it.”
“Well, for heaven's sake, tell him to
be careful; my C.S.M. is on his way to ||
hospital and the R.A.P. is becoming
hopelessly congested with casualties.”
“Bouncer,” I said, “be gentle; these
fellows aren't really up to your stand-
ard.”
But Bouncer was seeing red, and I
knew he would take a lot of restraining.
“Very good, Sir,” he replied; “but
I'm not arsking 'em to put their car-
cases in the way, Sir, and yer can't
change a 9-2 into a “flying pig' at a
moment's notice.”
I felt it was useless to say more.
Private Podgers was the next arrival.
He took his guard a yard in front of the
crease and set about to retrieve the
waning fortunes of his side. But, alas!
he only caught the blow at a higher
speed, and while he was fairly hopping
round himself the wicket-keeper had
him smartly stumped. By this time

there were stretcher-bearers present,
and a party of them rushed on to the
field and solemnly removed the injured
Podgers. The band, which hitherto
had been making a cheerful noise, now
commenced the well-known selection
from HANDEL's “Saul.”
I knew there would be trouble, and
I saw the C.O. come down from the
grand stand.
He walked straight up to me and
said, “You must really take that man
off. Let him finish the over; but if
harm comes I shall hold you directly
responsible.”
“Bouncer,” I said, “ease off; send
down the tamest ball you can think of ;
imagine it's your little sister at the
other end.”
In came the Company cook, his head
just appearing over the top of a well-
padded tunic, wearing his box-respir-
ator at the “alert.” I prayed forlornly
for his safety.
The fifth ball was well out of his
reach and he was only too glad to leave
it alone. The sixth was a very slow
full toss just outside the leg stump.
The poor man was so terrified when
he saw the ball approaching him that
in trying to run away he caught his
foot in the crease tape and literally
staggered head-first into it. Unhappily
he had omitted to don his steel helmet
and he fell like a log. A Red Cross
scene followed, and I saw the C.O. get
up and leave the ground. Simultane-
ously the band played the National
Anthem — determined, it seemed, to
secure at least a short respite from the
prevailing frightfulness.
But with victory so close we were
not to be baulked or put off, though we
at once stood smartly to attention.
The remaining wickets fell in a few
overs, without the assistance of Bouncer,
and we allowed a full five minutes for
the “retired hurts.” But they were
most of them well on their way to
Blighty, and we had won with sixty
runs to spare.
There was no outburst of cheering as
we left the field, and it grieved me to
see how unpopular I had become. My
head swam with the thought of the
suffering I had been instrumental in
º and I at once sought the solace
of my bed. Next morning my temper-
ature was well over 102 degrees, my
brain reeling and my nerve quite gone.
I am now slowly recovering in the same
hospital as my poor victims. -

Decked with blossoms and armed with

With gossamer banners floating far
And a radiant queen in an ivory car.
The beeches spread their petticoats wide
And curtseyed low upon either side;
The rabbits scurried across the glade
To peep at the glittering cavalcade.
Far and farther I saw them go
And vanish into the woods below;
Then over the shadowy woodland ways
I wandered home in a sweet amaze.

Pepita lay back luxuriously in her
red velvet siesta at the cinema. Only
that morning the new Governor had
arrived, the previous one having died
mysteriously about the middle of the
fifth star. Already the Management
were exhibiting pictures of the pro-
cession of welcome. Pepita's father had
mingled with the crowd, but she had
only caught a passing glimpse of it from
her window. Nevertheless in that in-
stant she had seen and loved the young
Governor with all the yes, every bit
that was left. This is the last time.

ing the Lisbon postmark lay
before him, and a good way

The door opened softly
and Pepita entered. She
was surpassingly lovely.
Her hair hung in clustering
guerrillas about her head,
and was bound by a single
banderillero. Poor child,
though she could speak fluently, she
had been deaf from birth, and was accus-
tomed in conversation with her father
to read his answers from his lips.
Swiftly and emphatically Don Miguel
was speaking. “Caramba 1" he mut-
tered; “Gloriana / Sancho Panza /
Ohé !” and then more fiercely, “Cas-
pita / O Sole Mio !” Realising that
he was drifting imperceptibly into
Italian he recovered himself by a mag-
nificent effort and began at “Caramba"
again.
“What has vexed you?” inquired
Pepita. -
“My child,” said her father dismally,
while over his brow crept an expression
of settled sombrero, “we are ruined.

“How DID YOU GET YOUR PACKET, MATE *"

!Come, we will send a prospectus to

Pepita smiled to herself. Once she
had met that sinister and ambitious
politician returning late from his cabal-
lero, and had loved him ever since with
all the romantic ardour of her tropical
disposition.
At breakfast next morning Señor y
Bañanos drew from its envelope a
tasteful circular, worded as follows:–
“CAN YoU STAND You R RELATIONs 2

| He was speaking earn-
estly to his companion,
none other than Señor y Bañanos, and
Pepita recalled a rumour that the Señor
had not been averse from an offer of
the Governorship for himself. The deaf
girl ceased to take an interest in the
backs of the crowd on the screen, and
from sheer force of habit began to read
what the two figures on the film were
whispering to each other.
“At ten, then,” said Señory Bañanos,
in level accents (he only used the curly
ones on his visiting-cards), “I will
send the disguise to your house. The

are not the American Ambassador or
dare to risk a diplomatic breach by re-
fusing any courtesy you offer. Come,
my friend! Venezuela 1 One Flor di

The conspirators slid off the screen,
and their place was taken by a study of
the native seguidilla feeding a nest of
young with worms from its peccadillo;
but Pepita was blind to its educational
attraction. Her heart beat a wild sierra
as she sprang from her peseta and

rushed from the building. With the
speed of a young hidalgo she ran to
the Governor's palace. The hour-hand
pointed to ten o'clock; already her
father would be at his deadly work,
sheltered under the disguise of the
American Ambassador. Down the echo-
ing corregidors she sped to the Go-
vernor's private room and burst within.
Don Miguel, bearing across his chest
the stars and stripes of the United
States and on his chin a false goatee,
was standing before the fireplace, lean-
ing carelessly against the mantilla.
Opposite him, in an armchair, lay his
victim, his face already sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought, his eyes
glazing. From his lips protruded one
of the deadly Flor di Cabbagios.
With a cry Pepita flung herself upon
it and dashed it to the ground. Open-
ing the window she allowed cool
draughts of buenos aires to flow into
the vitiated atmosphere. Then and not
till then did she turn to the stupefied
policemen who had run up at the
doubloom and stood wiping their feet
on the matador, and with a single
gesture pointed to the would-be mur-
derer, her father.
But Don Miguel had recovered from
his surprise, and before they could
divine his intention he clapped his
hand to his pocket. The firelight glinted
on ice-cold metal; there was a splutter,
a blinding flash, and when the smoke
cleared away he stood before them with
the last and deadliest of the Flor di
Cabbagios pressed between his ashen
lips. On the floor lay his cigar-case; it
lay quite still, without a guadalquivir.
A moment he stood thus, sublime in
defeat, and then slowly reeled forward
and fell dead into the outstretched
armadas of the chief constabulero.

came of her? Ah, reader, have you

TAKEN ABACK.
I HAD often wondered whether, if some really important
event came upon me quite suddenly, I should be able to
face it with that entire appropriateness of speech and action
which its nature deserved. Various minor incidents by
which I have been surprised have proved me singularly
unready, though apt enough in the display of esprit
d'escalier. But last week I failed miserably in a test of
the first magnitude. - -- ~ :
The day was one of scorching heat and we had appointed
for it a short walk with an interlude of tea at a rustic house
of refreshment not too far away for comfort. The walk took
place without any hitch. We had sent forward an advance-
guard of the juveniles to secure for us the good room of the
inn, and there we waited while a substantial tea was pre-
paring for us. In due course the tea-pot and the rest of
the paraphernalia for eight appeared and were promptly
fallen upon. Ample justice was done to everything, for
everything was served with neatness and despatch, and
the crockery, emblazoned with views of Portsmouth and
NELSON's Victory, was particularly attractive, until sud-
denly one of the children, who had been inspecting his cup,
said in a voice of horror: “It's made in Germany. Look!
It says so on the bottom of the cup.” . . . .
There, sure enough, were the tell-tale words which proved
that the proprietor of the inn had at one time, possibly
through the medium of an itinerant salesman, had commer-
cial intercourse with the enemies of mankind. The dreadful
revelation was there to prove it and the fact could not be
gainsaid. What ought we to have done under these distress-
ing circumstances? The classical instance was of course that
of Lord BERESFORD, who, at some luncheon or dinner given
at a London restaurant, discovered that he himself and the
company generally had been served on plates thus terribly
marked. Acting on a sudden and patriotic impulse, and
undeterred by the fact that reporters were not present,
he lifted his plate and dashed it to pieces on the floor
beneath the noses of the astonished waiters. That, I sup-
pose, is what I too ought to have done, but at the moment
it did not occur to me, and, to my eternal disgrace, I left the
cups alive. Looking back upon it now, I can see that this
solemn smashing of cups and saucers would have taught the
proprietor a much-needed lesson, and would have afforded
great amusement to the boys of our party. All I did, how-
ever, was to pay the bill and depart as I came.
To those who may now be tempted to visit the place
and inflict proper punishment I can only say that the
maid who served us had a pleasant smile, and that the
proprietor of the inn is a big man with plenty of muscle in
his make-up. -
THE TALE of A Tune.
It was a very hot day and, besides the butter-making,
Madame Berneval had the Brigade H.Q. billeted upon her
to consider. No doubt these were the reasons why Madame
felt irritable. Coming to the door to get a breath of fresh
air she encountered Rifleman Buddle. Now Madame held
severe views about private soldiers; moreover, to be caught
mopping your brow with a duster is to be taken at a dis-
advantage, and Madame suspected that she saw the ghost of
a smile on the face of the meek little man at her doorstep.
Clearly he wanted to buy something, and though his French
was limited his powers of expression were varied and he
soon made it clear that butter was the object of his visit.
Madame disliked men who looked meek but proved per-
sistent; as he talked and gesticulated it dawned upon her
that the idea was enormous, preposterous, that she, wife
of a sergeant, should part with her beautiful fresh yellow
butter, made with her fat white hands and the sweat of her
own fair brow—oh, but it was hot to-day!—to any mere
rifleman; she would teach him to come bothering her for
butter. - -
When she paused for breath Buddle saluted respectfully
and sadly and turned away. As he went he began to
whistle, just to affect an indifference which he did not feel.
It was a wistful little air, and the heart of Madame
Berneval was - suddenly-softened. For a moment she
listened incredulously, since it was her first meeting with
a soldier of that regiment; then she ran after Buddle, led
him back to the house, and poured forth a torrent of re-
miniscence. Was it not the very tune which her dear
mother and grandmother had hummed to her in the cradle?
Had not her good Pierre whistled it beneath her window
in their courting days, and had not the travelling fiddler
played it at their wedding dance? Ah, but it had been hot
that day, such a day as this. Now she remembered herself
it was this very day two-and-thirty years ago. And how
her new shoes had pinched—she could recall the blister on
her heel now ; but the fiddler had gone on fiddling and all
the world had had to dance when he played that tune.
Her own man Pierre might be whistling it this very mo-
ment before Rheims—but never before had she heard it
from an Englishman' He had only to ask, and all that she
had should be his—butter, but yes, as much as he could
carry; cheese, eggs, a bowl of the little pointed strawberries
that grew under the windows; and for his comrades—ah,
but to think that they whistled it too; that it was to that
tune they had marched to the help of the beautiful France.
Tears of delight rolled down her fat cheeks at the senti-
ment of it all, and Buddle went back with bulging pockets
and a puzzled mind. But then he had never heard that
long ago, when the Cockney Rifles were a volunteer regi-
ment, a certain Colonel had gone a-touring in France, and,
hearing the haunting little tune as he sketched outside a
café in some sleepy hamlet, had brought it back and made
of it a marching tune for his men.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I FIND it unusually difficult to codify the impressions
produced in me by A Romance of the Western Front
(HEINEMANN). The title, of course, could hardly be worse;
but, if you disregard this you will not have turned many
pages before finding yourself unexpectedly interested. The
book is a love-story, of love triumphant over obstacles; and
GABRIELLE M. WASSAL has told it with a direct and stark
simplicity that never allows your attention to wander.
Graces of style she has none; dialogue is rare; for the
most part the book is plain narrative, broken by an occa-
sional chapter of letters. What is thus told is the history
of the efforts made by an Englishwoman to be near her
lover, a French soldier on active service in the Motor Trans-
port. As can be imagined, the difficulties in her way are
almost beyond overcoming; how she grapples with them,
the thousand hardships of her hurried and uncertain
journeys, the hazards, in short, of modern camp-following,
rewarded by rare meetings between the lovers, are told
with a compelling and unforced sincerity that produces all
the effect of truth. I should perhaps have explained that
the whole affair is illicit, Isabelle having already a husband
in America, from whom she appears to have been estranged
under circumstances never sufficiently elucidated. It is
indeed an odd peculiarity of the book to pre-suppose the
reader conversant with all the former history of the two
persons who are its only characters. War-realism and a
cleverly-shown contrast in character between the (very
unpleasant) de Gaurival and the woman upon whose
devotion he ruthlessly tramples make this a book which,
willingly or not, one is bound to remember.
I confess to some curiosity as to the real feeling in Ger-
many towards the now justly famous author of J'accuse !
and The Crime, of which latter book the second volume
(Hodder AND STOUGHTON) has just appeared, and put me
upon this wonder. Not yet, I fear, have we observed signs
of that chastened mood, charitably foreshadowed in these
pages, when she will find satisfaction in the thought that
her most merciless critic was himself a son of the Father-
land. Meanwhile, as you probably know from the first
volume, The Crime is an amplification of the author's previ-
ous work, especially as affected by German apologists. The
second volume is devoted to the “antecedents of the crime,”
and deals first with the theory (and practice) of the Pre-
ventive War, then with the contrasted German and English
attitudes towards the idea of European conflict, and finally
with certain notable utterances by the spokesmen of militant
Germany. To read it is precisely as though one listened to
the demolition in a court of justice of the evasions and fabri-
cations by which counsel for a prisoner of palpable guilt
has endeavoured to twist the evidence of fact. We have
long known our enemy as deficient in humour; surely only
a people so handicapped could have conceived some of the
grotesque apologies that are here logically exposed in their
true character. I notice that the original scheme has so

far outgrown itself that yet a third volume will be needed
to complete The Crime. The three of them, with the
author's former work, should constitute one of the most
damning verdicts in history; one, moreover, that the pre-
varications of the accused have (as is here shown) only
strengthened a thousand-fold.
Having enjoyed Mr. WILLIAM HEwleTT's Introducing
William Allison, I opened Simpson of Snell's (SKEFFINGTON)
with a sense of pleasurable anticipation. Simpson was a young
fool of a clerk in the counting-house of a patent dog-food
company and was supposed to have been pushed into the
curiously inappropriate and quite unplausible career which
his begetter describes by an advertisement in a Peckham
hosier's—“Our Ties Have Temperament. Wear One and
Rise above the Ruck.” I have a better opinion of Simpson
than Mr. HEwlETT seems to have. I don't think he would
have been so foolish or so dull. And it wasn't till page 241
that the author remarked, “I fancy I can detect some
slight impatience among my readers here.” It all seemed
to me like careless hurried ITT T. -

der the title of “The Selfish-
ness of Unselfish People.' I
forget from whose pen it
emanated, but I do remem-
ber that it contained some
very arresting truths” º
This observation did not
“emanate” from a charac-
ter, but from the author
himself, and it broke this
reviewer's patient back. So

Brigadier-General CRowe, the author of General Smuts'
Campaign in East Africa (MURRAY), modestly but truthfully
says that his book is “little more than a diary of the events
of the campaign.” This, however, is perhaps an advantage,
for I am growing very tired of writers who conceal the
facts of war in a foggy barrage of words. General CROWE
was in command of the artillery in the East African
campaign, and accompanied General SMUTs during the
operations. Thus no one is better qualified to give an
accurate account of the difficulties which our troops had
to fight and overeome. Not only were we opposed by a
well-trained army, but also by a wretched climate which
played havoc with man and beast. To General SMUTs'
credit these difficulties were overcome, or, at any rate, so
far overcome that ultimate
victory became only a ques-
tion of time and patience.
It is really a wonderful re-
cord that is given here, and
no student of the War can
afford to miss what is one
of the most remarkable of
its phases. An introduction
|by General Smuts and four
maps are included. As for
certain other aspects of the
East African campaign, I

I have seen few publications to which the term “sumptu-
ous,” so beloved of reviewers, could more truthfully be
applied than the collection (one can hardly call it a book)
of drawings that Mr. PERCY BRADSHAw has assembled in
the twenty portfolios that make up The Art of the Illustrator
(PREss ART SCHOOL). The scheme of it is at once educa-
tional and general: to give a record of the work of twenty
leading illustrators, and at the same time to provide the
student with a comprehensive instruction in the technique
of the masters of his craft. To this end each portfolio
exhibits, in a series of separately mounted reproductions,
one or more examples of a single artist, so arranged that
the drawing is presented in its successive stages, from the
first roughly suggested idea to the finished picture. Add
to this a preface by Mr. BRADSHAw dealing with the career
and the method of each artist, and you will see that the
series forms a unique and regal road to learning for the
student of illustration. Mr. BRADshAw is a very palpable
enthusiast; and if at times the keenness of his appreciation
betrays him into the language of the showman (or, say, the
Rose Catalogue) it has also helped him to carry a difficult
to a great-great-aunt's portrait that it is no privilege to hive
with a personage, The Wishing Ring Man (Hodder AND
StoughTox) came round the corner and advised her very
kindly to “keep hoping.” Although he, too, escaped
almost at onee, leaving no address, I never doubted from
that moment that on the last page I should find them
arranging to marry each other. This kind of story
(generally, as here, of transatlantic origin), written with
plenty of “so you see's" and “couldn't you's,” to make
the reader feel at home, never does end miserably. Perhaps
you couldn't make a tragedy of it if you wanted to. Any-
how everything here is so much the daily round in the best
of all possible worlds that Phyllis's quite unnecessary acci-
dent seems to have slipped in somehow from somewhere
else. Just one rose-leaf crumpled a little. Having con-
sidered my feelings so carefully most of the time the
authoress did yet unkindly hint at knowing much more
about the Harringtons than I do. That, of course, is one
of the vices of sequels. All the same, I don't see any
particular reason why MARGARET WIDDIMER shouldn't go
on writing about the same people over and over again,
but with fresh heroes and heroines. I hope she won't
mind my borrowing her own adjectives and saying that,
task to a striking success. On the practical side I may add should they be such “nice purry” books as this one, it
that, though the price (perhaps one should rather call it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
CHANGES IN AMERICA.
(By Hank Dilton, our Special Corre-
spondent at Washington.)
MR. T. P. O'Connor, M.P., has given
a touching picture of the shrunken pro-
portions of Members of Parliament in
his “first impressions” of England on
his return after a year's sojourn in
America. It is not, he is careful to
say, the result of any food shortage.
With characteristic modesty he refrains
from indicating the true cause—his
own absence. I say the true cause
advisedly, for precisely similar symp-
toms have begun to show themselves
over here. Let me not, however, be
misunderstood. America is all right;
whole-hearted in the prosecution of the
War; unrelenting in her resolve to
down the KAISER. But the departure
of Mr. O'Connor and Lord READING
has left a great gap. Nothing like it
has been known since the death of
LINCOLN. I have endeavoured in my
previous articles to adumbrate, however
feebly, the colossal impact on the
American mind of Mr. O'Connor's
Gargantuan bonhomie, of the matmmoth
magnetism of Lord READING's radiant
personality. Their influence remains,
but life is poorer. Mr. TAFT has lost
forty pounds in the last two months.
HENRY Ford looks older and EDIsoN
is deafer. Talking to the PRESIDENT
yesterday I found him as keen as ever,
but with an added note of seriousness.
He said to me wistfully, “I miss my
daily TAY PAY.” It is the same with
everyone, from the highest to the lowest.
This morning in Central Park I saw a
policeman, a spiendid specimen of hefty
humanity, crying like a child. I asked
him what was the matter, and he replied,
“Sure I'm grieving for Mr. O'Connor.
Life isn't the same since he went back.”
He was a Galway man, he told me. But
this feeling is not confined to Irish-
Americans. The Lithuanian who oper-
ates the elevator in my hotel has grown
distrait. In the Far West the cow-
puncher punches sadly; pork is canned
and packed perhaps as fast as ever in
Chicago, but without the old zest; even
the skyscrapers scrape the sky less.
There is no failure or loss of activity, but
the joie de vivre is abated. Mr.TUMULTY,
the PRESIDENT's secretary, seems to me
to have grown hollow-cheeked, and his
conversation is no longer on the level of
his splendidly stimulating patronymic.
As in England, there is no falling
off of food supplies. The cause is
purely moral. But a hopeful reaction
has already set in, prompted by Mr.
O'ConnoR's statement in The Daily
Chronicle that he was homesick for
America. A powerful movement is on
foot, supported by influential represen-
tatives of all the leading interests, in
favour of inviting Mr. O'CoNNor to take
up his residence permanently in the
States. It is pointed out that the
habitual tension of American life de-
mands the presence of men who are all
heart, and act as perpetual lubricators
of the social and political machine. It
is proposed that a stately pleasure-dome
should be erected and placed at his
disposal in the Yellowstone Park. But
the difficulties cannot be overlooked.
Can Mr. Shortt get on without him 2.
Can Field-Marshal HAIG, or the Arch-
bishop of CANTERBURY, or Mr. HEALY,
whose devotion to him is as that of
DAVID to JonATHAN ? I fear not, and
can only suggest as a compromise that
Mr. O'Connor should, if possible, live
henceforth in a great balloon, securely
moored in mid-Atlantic, whence he
could radiate wireless uplift and unction
with impartial zeal to the New and
Old World alike.
THE NEW BIOGRAPHY.
A wave of relief is said to have passed
over the country on hearing the official
statement that the cinema story of the
Life of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE which, in
ten reels, is to be exhibited throughout
the country in October, is not a piece
of political propaganda, but private
commercial enterprise. Taken into con-
nection with the rumoured autumnal
General Election and a certain alert-
ness in the Prime-Ministerial character,
it was feared that the film, coming just
then, might have exerted undue influ-
ence. The danger is not over, but we
now know that if such a consequence
should occur it will be pure accident.
As to the performers in this great
production we have been told nothing;
but the leading part, we take it, since
Mr. LLoyd GEorg E is to be followed
from the cradle to Downing Street, has
had many players, beginning with a |
baby. That should be a proud man who
impersonated the protagonist in his
later stages as a winner of the greatest
war in history.
Meanwhile other cinema companies
are displaying the customary imitative
zeal, although unfortunately they have
only inferior material to work upon.
The rose has been plucked. Life-
stories, however, are to be the fashion
until the public tires—as it may do all
too quickly—and we are therefore des-
tined to share the earthly pilgrimage
of—well, not exactly Tom, Dick and
Harry, but assuredly of Thomas, Rich-
ard and Henry, all certainly O.B.E.
and probably higher, and most of them
in Parliament. Questions of local colour
may, of course, enter into the final
selection of heroes, for in the earlier
episodes the background is important: a
baby that is being carried about among
wild Welsh scenery, for example, being
more attractive than another (or pos-
sibly the same child) being carried
about in Battersea or New Brunswick.
But public interest will be the deciding
factor, and one can imagine some very
deadly debates as to the fitness of this
or that candidate for film honours among
the managers and their staffs. That is
where reputations are examined with
washen eyes, and summed up in un-
ambiguous phrase. Those are the men
that know. A few names will, however,
win through. ... “From the Cradle to
Printing House Square;” “From the
Cradle, vid Canada, to Horrex's Hotel;”
“From the Cradle to the Woolsack":
of these three we may feel fairly confi-
dent; and we have more than a sus-
picion that the progress of one whom
we will call as a child John Calf, from
extreme youth to fullest Bullhood, will
not be denied us.
But whether the cinema is thereby
to become a more joyous entertain-
ment is problematical. -
To DOCTOR MASEFIELD.
[The University of Yale has conferred an
honorary Doctor's degree on Mr. John
MASEFIELD.]
WILL this latter-day gift
Of a Doctor's degree
Give his genius a lift
That was sprung from the sea?
Will he start a fresh cruise
In the teeth of the gale
With his salt-water Muse—
Doctor MASEFIELD of Yale 2
Will he write us in verse
More Tales after CRABBE,
In each stanza a curse
Or a blow or a stab?
Or will he now feel,
When we suffer and ail,
'Tis his duty to heal—
Doctor MASEFIELD of Yale 2
But whatever the theme
He may happen upon
I can't even dream
Of his playing the don;
For the clarion and fife
In his music prevail,
Strong singer of strife—

SURE THING.
I oxCE wrote (having occasionally
induced an editor—and even a publisher
—to accept something for print) I once
wrote that clever women always tell
a man that he looks overworked.
I was younger then. As years ad-
vance one grows (sometimes) in know-
ledge, and I am now in a position to
add another verbal weapon to the clever
woman's armoury—should she need any
such assistance. The solicitous phrase,
“You are looking overworked,” is unc-
tion perhaps more for the young than
the middle-aged and elderly. No young
man, however conscious of his own
abysmal laziness, can resist it, or want
to resist it.
But the maturer man—the man to
whom Father Time's chief gift is an
increase of girth—must be differently
handled. He may or may not be over-
worked, but to be told about it, how-
ever seducingly, does not much interest
him. He is a little too old for any
flattery but the kind of flattery he is
not too old for. Therefore the clever
woman, in dealing with him, must do
otherwise. Taking him by the hand,
she must look at his features with
a close and careful scrutiny which,
although it is all assumed, can be ex-
tremely comforting, and then say, in
a tone almost of triumph, “You’re
getting thinner.”
“Parliament is mortally dead.”—Herald.
It would be if it were, but it isn't.

of misery.
“Why, what on earth's wrong, Ah

“Ah Sin welly sick,” replied that
worthy. “Cly all-ee night.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” I began.
“Dam Li him number one big

Dam Li never no more.”
“What has Dam Li been doing?” I
asked.
“Him one big thief man,” announced
Ah Sin, vindictively champing his
chewing gum. “Him stealum my
tlousers.” -
“But you've got them on,” I said.
“These lation thousers,” replied Ah
Sin pityingly. “Him stealum number
one top-side thousers.”
“Do you mean the khaki ones I gave
you for catching those rats for me?” I
asked.
“All-ee welly same,” agreed Ah Sin.
“Him coolie thiefnman,” he added, to
show the depths to which Dam Li had
fallen.
“It certainly does seem rather shabby
of him,” I admitted. “Have you asked
him to give them back again 2"
Ah Sin looked at me reproachfully.
“Ah Sin not beggar man,” he told
me. Then, after a pause, he took pity
on my confusion and continued. “But
spose you tellum Dam Li thiefnman go
to hell, him too muchee flighten'. Give
um back plenty too quick.”
“Very well, I'll try it,” I said doubt-
fully, and Ah Sin retired with a broad
smile and a profusion of thanks.
I had hardly got back into my hut
when Dam Li was announced.
“Dam Li welly sick,” he began ;
“cly all-ee night.”
“I’m glad to know you're ashamed
of yourself,” I said severely.
Dam Li gave me a look of the most
injured innocence.
“Me no shamed,” he said; “me
sick.”
“If you're not ashamed you ought
to be,” I told him. “What are you
sick about 2."
“Ah Sin number one big luffian,” he
answered.
“Plenty too much thief-
man. Stealum my beauty tin hat.” So D.O.R.A. has a human side after all.
“But he told me you had stolen his
trousers,” I gasped.
“Ah Sin plenty too much dam liar,”
said Dam Li scathingly. “First him
stealum my beauty tin heat, then me
fetchee thousers.” -
Put thus it seemed a just retribution,
but I thought I would still have a try
to bring about a reconciliation.
“Well, why don't you exchange back
again 2 " I suggested.
“Me wantee thousers,” said Dam Li,
shaking his head.
“An' me wantee tin hat,” said a
voice behind me—Ah Sin's.
I began to see daylight.
“And I suppose you think I'm going

said the two together.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BIRTHDAY;
OR, FATHER V. UNCLE.
I AM blessed with a little “girl-niece”
who, when she was a very little girl-
niece indeed, spent some happy years
at a school kept by a lady who was
then very old and seemed, forgotten by
Death, to be the last survivor of some
fragrant older and more gracious world.
There one day in grammar lesson, the
class, reading “examples” aloud, de-
claimed the sentence, “Daphne is a
good and kind little girl with soft brown
hair,” and at that all the small boys
and girls turned as one upon the little
girl-niece, whose name chances to be
Daphne, and expressed in various ways
their conviction that in this sentence
the person who composes grammar
books had for once indited sense and
truth. This by way of prologue, that
beneath the roof-tree of the little girl-
niece's home. Several times when she
should in mere politeness to her host
have laughed aloud the little girl-niece
was silent. Once when she caught
from behind its protective pince-nez
that host's astonished eye she asked
what “they" were laughing about. Of
course if I had fallen into error with
regard to the chocolates the failure of
the entertainment might have been
explained, but for them I had nego-
tiated beforehand, presenting them with
the flourish they deserved to the little
girl-niece, who thanked me “polite-
fully,” as her family phrases it, and
when the play was over carried them
home absently under her arm with their
brown and shining rows still drawn up
in close order.
As we stood upon the doorstep of
her home waiting for the feet of those
COUNTING YOUR CHICKENS.
Ethel having declared that we have
ten chickens, and I holding out for
twelve, we had a really exciting time
last night about sunset trying to settle
the matter. In the middle of the grass
plot (known at tea-time as the lawn)
the mother-hen had persuaded her pro-
geny to rest beneath her wings; and I
am now convinced that it would be
much easier to build a fresh coop over
the family after dark than to attempt
to hustle them into their proper quar-
ters as we did. We managed to get the
hen inside, and immediately innumer-
able flying spots of yellow distributed
themselves actively over the garden.
“You stand by the box and shoo
them in,” said Ethel, “and I'll go to
the end of the garden and shoo them
towards you.”
you may understand what
manner of little girl-niece
the little girl-niece is, and
why the birthday seemed
such an extraordinary affair.
It was the little girl-niece's
birthday, and the person
or persons whose business
it obviously should be to
arrange for her entertain-
ment upon such an occasion
having been called to the
Continent of Europe upon
urgent business of the
KING's, their duties de-
volved upon me.
To begin with there was
lunch. That I acknowledge
was a purely spectacular

customer). “LUMME, IF we'D TAKEN As LoNG GoIN' over: THE TOP As
You Do, so NNY, THE BLoom IN''UNs woulD BE IN PICCADILLY BY Now."
“Right-o,” I said; “shoo
—- on.”
º: The first minute was a
huge success. With spaci-
ous and impressive sweeps
of my arms I directed several
apparently intoxicated mor-
sels home to bed, while the
henclucked prodigiously her
approval of the show.
“Here they come, the
little darlings,” said Ethel.
“And there they go, the
little beasts,” said I, as four
of them sprinted between
my legs and disappeared.
“Try that big push again,”
I said.
A procession of fluffy balls
affair, the result being entirely dispro-
portionate to the outlay, mental, phy-
sical and financial, by which it was
achieved. The little girl-niece, instead
of seeing how funny it was, which
surely on her birthday was nothing
more than her duty, chose to regard it
from the point of view of the weary
war-worker trying to obtain a cheap
and nourishing mid-day meal—and
made it tragic. By that time the little
girl-niece had apologised for wearing
her second-bestcoat and skirt—“tighty”
in the clergyman's wife's category of
“highty, tighty and scrub”—on the
grounds that “highty" had not seemed
worth while. From all this you can
see how strangely she was behaving.
Then there was the matinée. The
seats were excellent. None of that un-
naturally long-backed and large-headed
race of persons who inhabit theatres
where successful plays are running
obstructed the view, not one actor or
actress mumbled, and the comedy it-
self was a bubble blown by a dram-
atist whose phrases are a part of that
peculiar language of intimacy spoken
who let you in, the little girl-niece
spoke correctnesses from an unmoved
heart.
“It has been awfully nice . . . thank
you very much . . .” but for all her
gentle breeding she was not able to
carry the matter through as she should
have-she did not look at the person
to whom she was speaking. The door
was open now and on the dark hall
table lay the afternoon letters. Un-
mannerly did the little girl-niece pounce.
For her there was only a field-postcard,
and mostly crossed out at that ; surely
a very slight insignificant thing from
the point of view of a little girl-niece
with a birthday. She looked at it, then
at me, then cast herself, field-card and
all about my neck.
“Hasn't it been a perfectly gorgeous
afternoon 2'' she said. “I can't remem-
ber when I've enjoyed a birthday so
much." —

scurried round and round the lawn,
followed by Ethel. In due course they
came my way, and, taking my cue, I
pocketed each ball accurately. Ethel
gave a sigh of relief.
“That's the lot,” she exclaimed.
“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight Hullo, what's that ?”
“A chicken,” I hazarded, turning
round. “One moment while I remove
my coat; this is some job. There—
behind the radish.”
“Two,” she said. In another second
there were four—I can't think why.
“Now let's see how many are inside.”
She counted five ; I prodded the hen
and found two more.
“That makes eleven,” I said. “Seven
in and four out.”
A half-hour of the best hunting
followed.
“Now let's count again to make
sure,” said Ethel.
We bent over the coop; the hen
winked at me deliberately and gave an
irritating chuckle.
“There's eight,” said Ethel.
“I make it ten,” I said. “There's

that under the cabbage?”
“That makes nine,” said Ethelgrimly.
“When we've caught it,” I agreed
morosely. “Sit on the coop while I
wheedle the latest one homeward, or
we shall have the lot out again. I
believe that hen is laughing at us.”
After five minutes' exertion I had
the belated one in hand, and deposited
it safely with the remainder of the
brood, hearing as I did so a distinctly
derisive noise in the hen's throat.
“I make it ten,” said Ethel. “You
count, will you? They won't keep still.”
I counted up to twelve, and received
only sarcasm for my pains. So we
gave it up and started for the house
and cooling drinks.
Iºthel says we have ten chickens; I
prefer to think that we have twelve;
the probability is therefore that we
possess eleven. A Third Party, with a
gift for the higher mathematics, gave it
as his opinion that we have seventeen
and a few odd bits. I have always sus-
pected that the higher mathematics is

154 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[SEPTEMBER 4, 1918.
THE MUD LARKS.
Not long ago a notice appeared in
Part II. Orders to the effect that our
Army had established a Rest Home at
X where invalid officers might be sent
for a week's recuperation.
Now X is a very pleasant place, con-
sisting of a crowd of doll's-house châlets
set between cool pine-woods and the sea.
The châlets are labelled variously
“Villa des Roses,” “Les Hirondelles,”
“Sans Souci,” and so on, and in the
summertimes of happier years swarmed
with comfortable bourgeois, bare-legged
children and Breton nannas; but in
these stern days a board above the gate
of “Villa des Roses” announces that
the Assistant-Director of Agriculture
may be found within meditating on the
mustard-and-cress crop, while “Les
Hirondelles " and “Sans Souci" har-
bour respectively the Base Press Censor
(whose tar-brush hovered over this per-
fectly priceless article) and a platoon
of the D.L.O.L.R.R.V.R. (Duchess of
Loamshire's Own Ladies' Rabbit Rear-
ing Wolunteer Reserve).
X, as I said before, is an exceedingly
pleasant place; you may lean out of
the window o' mornings and watch the
D.L.O.L.R.R.V.R.'s Sergeant-Majoress
putting her platoon through Swedish
monkey motions, and in the afternoons
you can recline on the sands and watch
them sporting in the glad sea-waves
(telescopes protruding from the upper
windows of “Villades Roses” and “Sans
Souci" suggesting that the A.D.A. and
the B.P.C. are similarly employed).
The between-whiles may be spent
lapping up ozone from the sea, resin
from the pine-woods, and champagne
cocktails which Marie-Louise mixes
so cunningly in the little café round
the corner; and what with one thing
and another the invalid officer goes pig-
jumping back to the line fit to mince
whole brigades of Huns with his bare
teeth.
X, you will understand, is a very
admirable institution, and when we
heard about this Rest Home we were
all for it and tried to cultivate fur on
the tongue, capped hocks and cerebral
meningitis; but the Skipper hardened
his heart against us and there was
nothing doing.
Then one morning MacTavish came
over all dithery-like in the lines, fell
up against a post, smashed his wrist-
watch and would have brained himself
had that been possible.
He picked himself up, apologised
for making a fool of himself before
the horses, patched his scalp with
plaster from his respirator, borrowed
my reserve watch “Pretty Polly,” and
carried on.
“Pretty Polly” can do two laps to
any other watch's one without turning
a hair-spring. Externally she looks
very much like any other mechanical
pup the Ordnance sells you for eleven
francs net; her secret lies in her spring,
which, I imagine, must have been in-
tended for “Big Ben,” but sprang into
the wrong chassis by mistake.
At all events as soon as it is wound
up it lashes out left and right with
such violence that the whole machine
leaps with the shcck of its internal
strife and hops about on the table after
the manner of a Mexican dancing bean,
clucking like an ostrich that has laid
twins. - -
It will be gathered that my “Pretty
Polly” is not the ultimate syllable in
the way of accuracy, but as MacTavish
seemed to want her and had been kind
to me in the way of polo-sticks, I
handed her over without a murmur.
The same aſternoon MacTavish came
over dithery again, dived into a heap of
bricks and knocked himself out for the
full count.
We put him to bed and signalled the
Wet. The Wet reported that MacTavish's
temperature was well above par and
booming. He went on to state that
MacTavish was suffering from P.U.D.
(which is Spanish for “flu") and that
he probably wouldn't weather the night.
The Skipper promptly 'phoned O.C.
Burials, inviting him to dine next even-
ing, and Albert Edward wired his tailor,
asking what was being worn in head-
stones.
William, our Mess President, took
up a position by the sick man's side in
hopes he would regain consciousness
for long enough to settle his mess-bill,
and the rest of us spent the evening
recalling memories of poor old Mac,
his many sterling qualities, etc.
However, next morning a batman
poked his head into the Mess and said
could Mr. MacTavish have a little
whisky, please, he was fancying it, and
anyway you couldn't force none of that
there grool down him not if you was
to use a drenching bit.
At noon the batman was back to say
that Mr. MacTavish was fancying a
cigarette now, also a loan of the gramo-
phone and a few cheerful records.
The Skipper promptly 'phoned post-
poning O.C. Burials, and Albert Edward
wired his tailor, changing his order to
that of a canary waistcoat.
That evening MacTavish tottered
into the Mess and managed to surround
a little soup, a brace of cutlets and a
bottle of white wine without coming
over dithery again.
But for all that he was not looking
his best; he weaved in his walk, his
eye was dull, his nose hot, his ear cold
and drooping, and the Skipper, gazing
upon him, remembered the passage in
Part II. Orders and straightway sat
down and applied that MacTavish be
sent to X at once, adding such a graphic
pen-picture of the invalid (most of it
copied from a testimonial to some-
body's back-ache pills) as to reduce us
to tears and send MacTavish back to
his bed badly shaken to hear how ill
he'd been.
The Skipper despatched his pen-pic-
ture to H.Q. and forgot all about it,
and so did H.Q. apparently, for we
heard nothing further, and in due
course forgot all about it ourselves, and
in the meanwhile MacTavish got back
into form, and MacTavish in form is
no shrinking lily be it said.
He has a figure which tests every
stitch in his Sam Browne, a bright
blue eye and a complexion which an
external application of mixed weather
and an internal application of tawny
port has painted the hue of the beetroot.
Then suddenly, like a bomb from the
blue, an ambulance panted up to the
door and presented a H.Q. chit to the
effect that the body of MacTavish be
delivered to it at once to bear off to X.
The Skipper at the time was out hack-
ing and Albert Edward was in charge;
he sent an orderly flying to MacTavish,
who rolled in from his tent singing
“My Friend John ” at the top of his
voice and looking more like an over-fed
beetroot than ever.
“Dash it all, I don't want to go
to their confounded mortuary,” he
shouted; “never felt fitter in my life.
I can't go; I won't go!”
“You’ll have to,” said Albert Edward;
“can't let the Skipper down after that
pen-picture he wrote; the Staff would
never believe another word he said.
No, MacTavish, my son, you'll have
to play the game and go.” -
“But, you ass, look at him,” wailed
the Babe; “look at his ruddy, ruby,
tomato-ketchup, plum-and-apple com-
plexion. What are you going to do
about that ?”
“I’ll settle his complexion,” replied
Albert Edward grimly ; “tell his man
to toss his toothbrush into the meat-
waggon; and you, Mac, come with me.”
He led the violently protesting Mac-
Tavish into the kitchen. The cook
tells me Albert Edward pounded two
handfuls of flour into MacTavish's
complexion and filled his eye-sockets
up with coal-dust, and I quite believe
the cook, for in five minutes' time I
came on Albert Edward dragging what
I at first took to be the body of a dead
Pierrot down the passage towards the
waiting ambulance, at the same time
exhorting it to play the game and
wobble for the Skipper's sake.

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR
The wretched MacTavish, choking
with flour and blinded with coal-dust,
wobbled like a Clydesdale with the
staggers.
1 saw a scared R.A.M.C. orderly
bound out of the car and assist Albert
Edward to hoist MacTavish aboard,
trip him up and pin him down on a
stretcher. Then the ambulance coughed
swiftly out of sight.
The allotted week passed but no
MacTavish came bounding back to
us like a giant refreshed with great
draughts of resin, and we grew anxi-
ous; which anxiety did not abate when,
in reply to the Skipper's inquiries, the
Rest Home authorities wired denying
all knowledge of him.
Goodness knows what we should
have done if a letter from MacTavish
himself had not arrived next morning,
to say that he had lain on his back in
the ambulance digging coal-dust out of
his eyes and coughing up flour till the
car stopped, not, to his surprise, at the
Rest Home, but at a Casualty Clearing
Station.
Some snuffling R.A.M.C. orderlies
bore him tenderly to a tent and a
doctor entered, also snuffling. Mac-
Tavish is of the opinion that the whole
of the medical staff had P.U.O., and
the doctor was the sickest of the lot
and far from reliable.
At all events, on seeing MacTavish's
face, he ejaculated a bronchial “Good
Lord!” and tearing MacTavish's tunic
open, stuckatrumpet against his tummy
and listened for the ticks.
Apparently he heard something sen-
sational, for he wheezed another “Good
Lord!” and decorated MacTavish with
..a scarlet label.
Within an hour our hero found him-
self on board a Red Cross train en
route for the coast.
There were a lot of cheerful
on the bus, getting all the soup and
jelly they wanted; but MacTavish got
only lukewarm milk and precious little
of that. From scraps of hushed con-
versation he caught here and there he
gathered that his life hung by a thread.
He was feeling very bewildered and
depressed, he said, but, remembering
his duty to the Skipper, played the
game and kept body and soul together
on drips of jelly surreptitiously begged
from the cheerful wounded.
Next morning he found himself in
hospital in England, where he still re-
mains. He says he has been promoted
from warm milk to cold slops, but is still
liable to die at any moment, he under-
stands.
He has discovered that he was sent
home with “galloping heart disease,”
but nobody in the hospital can get even
a trot out of it, and boards of learned

physicians sit on him all day long, their
trumpets planted on his tummy listen-
ing for the ticks.
MacTavish says he thinks it impro-
bable that they ever will hear any ticks
now, for the excellent reason that he
threw the cause thereof—my “Pretty
Polly,” to wit—out of the window the
day he arrived.
In a postscript he adds that he con-
siders he has played the game far
enough, and that if the Skipper doesn't
come and bail him out soon he'll bite
the learned physicians, kiss the nurses,
sing “My Friend John ” and disgrace
the Regiment for ever. PATLANDER.

IMITATIVE EVOLUTION ON THE MUNITION-WORKER'S ALLorMENT.
THE CHASE OF THE STUNT.
[“Stunt-hunters are somewhat prone to ride
past their proper quarry in order to be in at
the death of a red herring.”—Sunday Paper.]
SAID the Stunt unto the Herring: “I
am blown;
I can hear the wild-eyed huntsman
drawing near; --
I have not your elasticity of bone;
Go and leave me, I will stay and
perish here.”
Said the Herring: “If you've lost
your silly nerve
You can creep into that mare's-nest
up along,
But I thank the Great Chimera whom
I serve
That I'm personally going very
strong."
So the huntsman, splashed with ink
unto the eyes,
Caught a whiff of an aroma that he
knew, - -
And he blundered through a thicket of
surmise,
And he made the welkin ring with
his halloo.
In a frenzy of destruction past he
spurred,
And the Stunt, emerging ashen from
the nest, -
Tottered East (so my communicant
inferred),
Whilst the Herring in a haemorrhage
went West.
THE DISSEMBLER.
“AUGUST always was an unlucky
month with me,” said Jimmy, extract-
ing a cigarette and lighting it, though
not without difficulty, for the fingers of
his left hand are still of little use to him.
“What's happened now 2 " I asked.
“Don't you know that we've run
out of marmalade 2"
“Is that all 2’’ -
“All! Isn't it enough 2 But as a
fact it's not all. There's as bad, if
not worse, to follow. I am passed for
General Service.”
“You’re not,” I cried. “What about
your arm 2"
“I exploited it all I could, but it's
not considered sufficient excuse to keep
me at home.”
“Surely there's some mistake,” I said.
“Not a bit of it. I'm for G.S., that 's
certain. As certain as that we’ve no
more marmalade. There'll be a third
misfortune before the day's out, you
mark my words. The boiler will burst
and there'll be no more baths, or some-
thing frightful like that.”
“Well, it beats me how you've been
passed fit,” I said. “But I confess that
your tone shocks me, Jimmy. I don't
think you can have read my poem
beginning
“Sons of Britain, now awake,
From the sword the scabbard take.'”
“I have,” said Jimmy," and I should
have thought it was the third mis-
fortune, only I read it yesterday. Still,
we'd better carry on, I suppose. Let's
ge to some low place of amusement this
evening.” . . .
That was a week ago. To-day I met
an ancient medical man who sits on
Boards and such.
“Did you have one Jimmy Bray, a
Captain in the Wopshires, before you
lately 2” I asked.
“With a badly smashed-up arm 2''
He didn't put it quite like that ; he
used several mysterious words like
“sutured” and “atrophied"; but that
was the general idea.
“That's the man,” I said. “How
the deuce was it you passed him G.S. 2”
“It's very irregular in you to ask
me about it,” said he. “But as a matter
of fact he seemed so awfully keen to
get back that we hadn't the heart to
refuse him.”
I'm afraid Jimmy must have got a
touch of camouflage this hot weather.

Letter from Major Sir Fawcett Gear, R.A.F. (Deputy

Ministry, to Messrs. Proffitt, Proffitt and Proffiti, Aero-
nautical Tailors, Savile Row, W. :—
DEAR SIRs, With reference to my order for five tunies,
three breeches and six slacks, will you please note that
these garments are now required to be in pink georgette
and no longer in ninon 2
With regard to the belt on the tunic I hear the material
and colour are shortly to be changed again, but as it will in
this case be possible to “wear out” the existing tunics,
would you kindly supply three extra belts—one of black-
and-white overcheck, one of green charmeuse with the lace
insertions, and the other of white buckskin 2
In this way I shall be able to utilize each pattern as occa-
sion may necessitate.
As to the cap-badge, I have been making inquiries and
have heard to-day that I shall have to wear a 1/100-scale
kiwi, in full flight, of nickel; but as nothing has been de-
cided yet, please hold the cap back until you hear further
from me. Yours faithfully,
- FAwcETT GEAR.
P.S.—Kindly note that I need a second bar to my O.B.E.
“WANTED, Comfortable Home, by elderly gentleiman, not invalid,
in clergyman's, doctor's, or Christian family.”—Times.
On behalf of clergymen and doctors we protest against the

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(The GERMAN KAISER, the CRowN PRINCE and
General von BERNHARDI.)
The Kaiser. Things are looking blacker and blacker. It
is most extraordinary that it should be so, but so it is. We
retreat constantly and are losing all the time in immense
numbers. -
The Crown Prince. Ah, but we don't let the people know
that. The Censor keeps his eyes open and allows no bad
news to be published. -
The K. Bad news does get itself known all the same.
The people become anxious and rumours of all kinds fly
about, and in this condition of mind one can no longer look
for the same efforts. I tell you frankly I don't at all like
the way things are going and I heartily wish we were well
out of it. - * ,
The C. P. It's too late to talk like that. You should
have thought it out before. • . . .
The K. You whipper-snapper It is not for you to talk
against war. Was it not you who made my life a burden
by trying to form your own party and to oppose my
Government 2 -
The C. P. I protest. -
The K. No protest of yours can alter facts, and the facts
are as I have stated them. -
The C. P. All I admit is that I have sometimes suggested
a greater and more vigorous display of energy in high
quarters, but there is no disloyalty in that." …
The K. There are more ways than one of being disloyal.
The C. P. I declare I know none of them, and have
always been animated by the most complete deference to
my War Lord. *
The K. Well, we won't argue that old question out again.
Things are too serious for that and there is BERNHARDI
listening to us. - *
General von Bernhardi. I thought your Majesty desired
my presence, but I can go at once if your Majesty wishes it.
The K. No, no, I was only joking. I did want you to
be here, for I wish to ask you if you still adhere to the
opinions expressed in your famous book.
Von B. Which book does your Majesty mean?
The K. Oh, so you have written more than one famous
book, is that it? At any rate I mean the one in which
you speak of war as necessary to a nation, and all that
sort of nonsense. -
Von B. Certainly I adhere to those opinions, and I had
the best reason for believing that those opinions found
favour not only in your Majesty's exalted mind but also in
that of his Royal Highness the CRowN PRINCE.
The C. P. I was induced to read some of the stuff, but I
didn't think much of it, as it was mostly composed of
platitudes about the benefits that war confers upon a nation.
Von B. Your Royal Highness is pleased to be facetious.
What I have asserted remains absolutely true, only the
leadership must be strong and intelligent. Is that so in
this case? Who can assert that it is 2 Your Hindenburgs
and your Ludendorffs are mere jugglers, and are responsi-
ble with your royal selves for all the blood that is being
uselessly spent. You are both hated—no, I will not stop—
all over the civilized world, and that hatred falls heavy on
the head of the German people. It would have required
only a small amount of good will and a little intelligence
to have kept America out of the war. But no, you were
not satisfied until you had added America, with her in-
exhaustible resources in men, money and munitions, to the
number of our enemies. That seals our doom in this War,
unless you and your Chancellor can devise a method of
obtaining an immediate peace. That will be a humiliation
to Germany, and your own arrogance will feel the wound.
But it is better that there should be humiliation than that
our people should be for ever ruined by the incompetence of
the ruling House.
The K. You have allowed yourself a singular liberty of
expression; and now, General, it is time for you to retire.
Von B. I obey, your Majesty. [He leaves the room.
The K. A very wordy gentleman. He does not weigh
his sentences.
The C. P. Still, there may be something in what he
says—at any rate so far as you yourself are concerned.
The K. You too can leave the room. I alone can deal
with this situation.

THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER, 1918.
“MY BIRD, I THINK ?”
our BookING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I MAKE free to confess that as far as I am concerned
Mr. E. PHILLIPs OPPENHEIM is at his best when he is
leading me breathless through the capitals of Europe in
pursuit of some tortuous intrigue of the Corps demi-diplo-
matique. I like it all, the diamonds and the champagne,
the limousines and the Browning automatics, the waiters
who are chiefs of police, and the countesses who are pick-
pockets, the international conspiracies, and the assassin-
proof hero who appears at the psychological moment to
save Europe from another conflagration. But the con-
flagration has arrived and is with us, and tales of diplo-
matic intrigue are no longer intriguing. So it is both
natural and intelligent of Mr. OPPENHEIM to leave his
familiar haunts and in The Other Romilly (HodDER AND
Stoughton) give us a mystery story which involves no
other issues than the happiness of the persons concerned.
As far as construction is concerned the story is not up to
the level of his previous work. Possibly because more
realism is necessary for dealing with common people than
with the nebulous royalties of fiction. The punctual
appearance in the last chapter of everybody who is neces-
sary to clear the hero just as he is on the point of being
haled off to jail rather smacks of the cinema. But
Mr. OPPENHEIM is never dull and never amateurish, and
his constant readers will no doubt find the brothers
Romilly as good candle-burners as the scheming denizens
of Montmartre or the furtive minions of the Wilhelmstrasse.
Verdun Days in Paris (CoLLINs) is not a very appropriate
title for Miss MARJoRIE GRANT's delightful little book.
Verdun is here only a background for what is an informing
account of Paris in times of great stress. There is real
value in this book, for apart from the descriptions of work
among soldiers and refugees it will correct, and indeed
entirely obliterate, any tendency we may still have to think
of Paris as we thought of it in the days before the War.
To Parisians our determination to regard it as merely a
city of pleasure has always been a source of annoyance,
and if Miss GRANT can ever be furiously angry (which I
doubt) it is because she believes that the old British idea
still persists that “France is a land of feverish gaiety,
sickly sentimentality, lax morals, endless suppers, and
dancers of more than Oriental mystery. How complete a
misunderstanding,” she adds, “of a nation inexorably
logical, sternly industrious, abstemious, parsimonious,
w.th only one real sentimental passion, that of patriotism."
Eloquent advocate as she is, Miss GRANT has not mentioned
the French quality of being able to laugh when tears are
very near the heart, a quality that asks the finest cour-
age. You must read Verdun Days in Paris not only for
its information, but because the author never misses
the humorous side of life, which she presents with a quiet
and most attractive charm.
Pacifists, Defeatists, Bolsheviks and others who favour
a patched-up peace are apt to look on the German colonies
mainly as counters with which to bargain with the Hun;
and to persons of that kidney any evidence bearing on the
treatment of the natives by their German masters will be
hardly welcome. But fortunately these types are few and
may, it is hoped, be ignored. Even so the Dark Continent

this well-informed and un-
cerned with her story than
is a subject about which too many Englishmen are in the
dark, and any book that throws light on it is of value,
especially when its style is straightforward and its evidence
unquestionable. This much at least can be said of The
Prussian Lash in Africa (Hodder AND STOUGHTON), in
which “AFRICANUs” briefly describes both the methods
and effects of German rule. To many readers the horrors
may appear exaggerated and so filthily savage as to be
beyond belief in the case of any country that calls itself
civilized. This would have been my own impression had
I not seen something of the results both in peace and war;
but most men who have taken part in any African cam-
aign will feel that these statements of “AFRICANUs,” so far
rom being overdone, are almost unduly mild and moderate.
At first, of course, when we entered a native village in
German territory the cry of “Jambo, Bwanal” (“Welcome,
Master!”) with which we were greeted by the civilian
natives was regarded merely as a polite pose and incom-
patible with the attitude of their Askaris. But we were
not long in learning better; and if you want to know why
It happens that two books dealing with the vexed topic of
education have arrived on my table simultaneously. These
are The German School as a War Nursery (MELRose), by
W. H. ERIEDEL, and Political Education at a Public School
(CoLLINs), by WICTOR GoLLANcz and DAVID SoMERVELL.
Reading these titles you will be prepared to find that,
apparently at least, the books contradict one another; only
apparently, of course, as it does not in fact at all follow that
because an educational system has bad results in Germany
its effect will be the same in civilized countries. “Educa-
tion,” says Professor SADLER, in his admirable brief intro-
duction to the English translation of M. FRIEDEL's book,
“is a great power. If you can canalize it you can use it
hydraulically for public works.” Substitute for “public
works” another aim, military aggrandizement, and this is
precisely what Germany has been doing with that ugly
but momentous force the Teutonic educational canal. M.
FRIEDEL, as Director of the Musée Pédagogique of Paris,
writes with authority; his book, largely made up of extracts
from German educational writings published since 1914,
the British were warmly
welcomed and loyally served
by the mass of the popula-
tion, while the native troops
put up such a bitter re-
sistance, you need only read
pretentious little book. You
will also realise how fatal
it would be to British pres-
tige throughout Africa if
the colonies were handed
back to the Hun.

The Desired Haven (MEL-

in life is to marry a gentleman (her absentee father, so
her mother had told her, was one, but he went to the bad
and turned up in a Paris café as a waiter and was killed
by a bomb just when Isoël had come in from the ends of
the earth to have a cup of coffee, so that she recognised
him by a strawb–no, a tattooed snake on his arm). A
lucky windfall enables her to go to Venice, where the people
say Buon giorno and Subito and Che sarà sard 1; and to
Paris, where they say Tiens and Mais oui and Merci, non

of scruples in the pursuit of her ideal for Isoël. Conceal-
ments and hair-raising perversions of the truth, mitigated
blackmail, bold advances, coy withdrawals—all these she
uses to hook her fish, a wealthy W.C.; and, having hooked
him, she uses discreet confessions to land him. I don't
share the author's evident affection for this artful child of
nature, but I do like monocled Judy Dalgleish, the mas-
culine reluctant lover who yields to her patient American
millionaire in the end. Money and snobbishness are very
prominent in this story, which thus establishes actual

LEslie MooRE (whether Mrs. or Miss I do not know, but cer-

of changing the religion of her heroine. I was ready to lay
a small wager from almost the start that Philippa was
ultimately to be received into the Roman Catholic Church.
Personally I am not altogether in love with religious propa-
ganda in a novel. But if you do not share this fastidious-
ness the career of Philippa is well enough. The author
has a considerable sense of character and knows how to
construct a novel. Best of all, she shows a real under-
standing of children.

JAMOUFLAGE.
CASTING an early-morning and dis.
gruntled eye upon our war-breakfast
table, I remarked sadly, “No jam, no
jelly, no marmalade.”
“Also no muffins, and no flowers, by
request,” said Doris pleasantly. “On
the other hand you have two kinds of
margarine, some of last week's and
some of this.” -
“Surely you could manage a little
honey.”
“I could manage quite a lot, if we
had any. But I can't get it. You
forget that the bees have now been
controlled. The Apiary Commissioner
has commandeered all the hives, to be
set up in aircraft factories as an exam-
ple. I can't afford to make marmalade
with oranges uncontrolled at 5d. Be-
sides, they are going to sell them next
week without the skins. The skins are
wanted for high explosives or some-
thing. As for jam * >
“Well, what about jam 2"
“Fruit crops a failure; sugar short;
so many more men in the Army.”
“Please don't talk like a newspaper,”
I said plaintively. “Even if there are
five million more men eating jam in
France than there were last autumn,
there must be five million fewer men
eating jam in this country.”
“But they eat more jam in the Army.
They are hungrier than civilians.”
“They can hardly be that,” I said.
“Of course I don't grudge them a
single pot that they eat, but in Flanders
I believe they use the best strawberry
for dubbin. WHY is there no jam 2 I
ask you as man to jam n >
“You can't make it without fruit.”
“Pardon me, you can make it out
of turnips and a little ginger. Have
the swedes been a failure ?”
“They are still neutral, if that is
what you mean. As for ginger, you
forget that the Ginger Controller has
taken up all available supplies. The
Government needs it.”
“It does indeed. But isn't there
anything you can do? Surely your
former Highland servant's old aunt in
St. Kilda could lend you one pot of
gooseberry to tide us over the winter.”
“Silly,” said Doris. “You’ve no
memory to-day. All the gooseberry-
bushes on St. Kilda were taken over by
the Afforestation Board this summer.
The Coal-mines Maintenance Commis-
sioner is to get them for pit props.”
“How thorough of him 1"
“Yes,” said Doris. “Ellen Macarthur
told me at the canteen yesterday that
her brother, who is 29 and Grade 1,
but not really very strong, expects to
get a job as a Timber Commissioner
for the Outer Hebrides.”
“Nonsense!—I should say ‘Hoots
and havers!' There are no trees in the
Outer Hebrides.”
“Not very many, perhaps," Doris
agreed. “But I expect there is an
Outer Hebrides Chief Commissioner
for Timber, with so much a year, and
six Assistant Commissioners with so
much a year, and twelve Sub-Assistant
Commissioners, and I don't know how
many inspectors. They will probably
stay in Oban during the summer and
have quite a decent time. You see,
the less timber there is in a place the
more men are needed to take thorough
good care of it and see that it isn't
used by civilians for toothpicks.”
“Quite so. But is there nothing
sweet in the house?”
“Ah, well,” said Doris coyly, “you
used to say . . . but no matter . . .
Try a little mustard on your second
inch of toast.”
She pushed a large silver mustard-
pot towards me. I opened the lid
apathetically. Then I grasped the
nearest spoon. The pot was nearly
full of strawberry jam.
“Hooray!” I cried. “More camou-
flage. No visitor would ever guess
what was in that pot.”
Doris swiftly removed the treasure
untasted.
“I was afraid, even after your solemn
promise, that you couldn't get through
breakfast without that world-weary
word. But if you don't camouflage
anything in my hearing for twenty-
four hours I promise you a whole tea-
spoonful to-morrow morning.”
“Good,” I said. “Jam to-morrow.
Any cheese on the dinner horizon 2"
“Well, the grocer hoped yesterday
that he would be able to oblige me
to-day with half-a-pound of a new sort
of cheese, Gorgonmargo.”
“I know,” I said. “Breadcrumbs,
rancid waggon-grease and a pinch of
salt. Well, well. More cam ” I
pulled up just in time.
But I know I shall never keep off
the fatal word for twenty-four hours
on end. The strain will be too great.
No war-jam is worth it.

VALEDICTORY: TO A W.A.D.
TAKE off, my nurse, the band of blue
You sewed upon my sleeve;
Repaired and patched as good as new
I make this last request of you
And then I take my leave.
Pathetic fancies may not grace
My little vacant bed;
There comes another lucky case
To bless his “blighty" in my place,
Your patient in my stead.
While willy-nilly I must go
A-hunting of the Hun,
You'll carry on—which now I know
(Although I've helped to rag you so)
Means great work greatly done.
And if, when you're fed up some day,
As even you must be,
When tumblers tumble from the tray,
When Sister has too much to say
(She may have, even she);
When on the quilts you've made so neat
Some silly asses sprawl;
When weights are on your weary feet,
The dinner-trolley has you beat
And nothing's right at all;
Then, if an unseen crutch you hear
Come tapping lightly up,
And if, by means that don't appear,
That trolley should be taught to steer
And caught that falling cup;
If somehow pillows are put straight
Or wrinkly quilts are smoothed;
If something shares the teapot's weight
Or rolls a bandage when you're late,
Or Sister's strangely soothed,—
Be well assured that one you knew
(Though which you may not guess),
Who came and went as hundreds do,
Has sent a wish to wait on you
In friendly thankfulness.

inexorably refused.

THIS 'ERE GRADE III, CHAP WILL COOM AS ME SUBSTITOOT.”
I Do not mind admitting it, we
have been considerably alarmed about
William. William, en passant—though
he seldom passes but just comes in
and has a meal—is my wife's brother.
He is far, far more than that, however,
for he ranks with the elect, that chosen
coterie of favoured mortals who never
work. He drives in taxis and owes
his tradesmen for purple and fine linen.
William has frequently in my hearing
spoken of work, but that is as near as
he ever got to it. This was why I was
swept off my fest when Mary told me
what he had been chatting to her
about.
“William wants a job,” she said.
“He thinks that perhaps you might
find him something—fairly easy; he is
not strong. . He seemed to fancy it is
time he settled down.”
“Well, for a bright young fellow of
forty-seven perhaps he is right,” I said.
The more I dwelt on the matter of
this yearning on the part of William
for work the more unreasonable it
seemed, for he always appeared to get
along very nicely, thank you, as things
were—a fiver borrowed in his well-

known gracious way whenever he ran

short ; week-ends for the asking
(William used to do the asking); and
a fine and airy diplomatic touch with
him which enabled him to rise superior
to debts, tailors and the common ills
of insolvent humaniuy. It was not sur-
prising that it all caused us some little
uneasiness. I told him frankly that
we, his relatives, felt anxious about
him.
“It is not like you, William,” I said
impressively. “I am afraid you are
taking the times a bit too seriously.
It has just struck you, perhaps, that
there is a war on ; but don't go and
over-exert yourself. Still, I know of
a berth for you. Brooks wants a man
to help him in the office.”
But we need not have worried our-
selves. William is all right. At the
last moment he said he felt he could
not avail himself of my kindness. He
said he had been hasty and he apolo-
gised handsomely. He had been think-
ing things over.
You will never guess his reasons.
Even I was outwitted, and I have lent
money to William for years and years.
William told me the plain truth over
a glass of port—my port. He said he
should have liked nothing better than
this job, but he had been thinking about
the Man Power Act, and he felt that,
with the chance of being called up, he
would be putting his employer in a
position of unfair risk.
This is very noble of him, but I wish
William were not quite so high-prin-
cipled. It comes very expensive for
his friends.
“Awfully sorry, old chap,” he said
regretfully, “but I can't bring myself
to do it. It would not be playing the
game. Brooks seemed a decent sort,
and the work would have just suited
me; but there is this new Act. I may
be called up, you see, and that would
leave the poor chap in a corner. I will
come down and see you this week-end.
We can talk things over. You see I
am in a bit of a difficulty, not knowing
what the Government may do with me.”
But the Government won't do any-
thing with William—not if it knows
its business.
From a feuilleton:—
“He paused, and held her a little way from
him, gazing into her tea-dimmed eyes.”
The result, we suppose, of a slip be-
tween the cup and the lip.

VISION.
I've seen her, I've seen her
Beneath an apple-tree;
The minute that I saw her there
With stars and dewdrops in her hair
I knew it must be she.
She's sitting on a dragon-fly
All shining green and gold;
The dragon-fly goes circling round
A little way above the ground–
She isn't taking hold.
I've seen her, I've seen her,
I never, never knew
That anything could be so sweet;
She has the tiniest hands and feet,
Her wings are very blue.
She holds her little head like this
Because she is a queen;
(I can't describe it all in words)
She's throwing kisses to the birds
And laughing in between.
I've seen her, I've seen her—
I simply ran and ran ;
Put down your sewing quickly, please,
Let's hurry to the orchard trees
As softly as we can.
I had to go and leave her there,
I felt I couldn't stay,
I wanted you to see her too—
But oh, whatever shall we do
If she has flown away 2

THE LANGUAGE DIFFICULTY.
The servant question has reached
India.
here on leave and acquired the only
available attendant, a Tamil youth who
knows no English and very little of
anything else. I imagine that it is
only the general scarcity of everything,
including servants, which has embold-
ened Moonuswamy to offer himself as
dressing-boy even to that predestined
employer of the incapable, the “Arficer
Jintlman from Basra.”
Leave is too short and far too pre-
cious to permit of my making any
attempt to learn a language which
offers for the simple obvious word “is”
i–s, is, the horrible polysyllable irre-
keradu. One lesson in Tamil decided
me on that point. But the language
of signs has its limitations, and things
were rapidly reaching an impasse when
Moonuswamy produced the Domestics'
Manual. It was not an inviting book
as it lay amid the dust and crumbs of
Moonuswamy's favourite tin salver,
and I gazed with a cold reluctance at
first upon the lavish grease-spots which
darkened its brown - paper wrapper.
Then, grunting strange Tamil grunts
in disapproval of my apathy, Moonu-
swamy laid it open and pointed proudly
to the parallel columns of Tamil and
English wherein were to be found just
IR. F.
I discovered it when I arrived
those useful and intimate remarks which
he and I were longing to exchange.
For a time mine was the joy with
which Crusoe must first have heard
Friday speak; but as the days go by
I realise that the manual has not given
me all I hoped. Its value to us is limited
by Moonuswamy's lack of intellect.
The leader of the dialogues is a person
of a vagrant and vacillating habit of
mind, who constantly introduces a
subject only to let it drop again at
once in the most irritating way; still,
when I do light upon what I want I
am able to read the English at a glance
and point to the Tamil counterpart with
the severity which the occasion may
demand. Moonuswamy, on the other
hand, has intense difficulty in spelling
out the Tamil to which I have referred
him, and if it is pretty to see the triumph
grow in his face as he strings his horrid
sounds together and discovers that they
are really making words, it is pitiful to
watch it fade when he realizes that all
told they represent “There is no oil in
the lamp,” or, if I am unable to find the
appropriate words for a more definite
charge, “You are not a very clever
boy." -
But it is over his answers that Moon-
uswamy gets into the most serious
difficulty. Unable to read rapidly
enough he notes the position of my
accusation and trusts to the next con-
secutive sentence to furnish the fitting
excuse. In this he is not often lucky,
because the antiphonist of the book,
like the leader, is given to a reckless
irrelevance. But also Moonuswamy
seldom misses the mark by less than a
couple of lines—a serious miss when
topics change so quickly and completely
as those of the Manual—and oftener
than not goes wider still.
Only yesterday, for instance, when I
approached him with a buttonless shirt
and pointed severely to the remark,
“The handle of this thing is broken"
(the most suitable reproof which I could
find at the moment), the fellow missed
three sentences and indicated the absurd
reply: “To have you with me will be a
hindrance to my work.”
This morning, again, I burst out of my
room and found Moonuswamy squatted
on his heels beside an undarned pile of
socks, breathing stertorously as he bent
over the Manual. I seized it, and,
having hurriedly invited his attention
to the inaccurate statement, “To-day I
am to take physic,” and then to the
more truthful but equally irrelevant
appeal, “You know that I am a family
man,” I found what I wanted and
pointed indignantly to the words, “This
water is not hot.”
Moonuswamy mouthed laboriously
over the Tamil in a guttural whisper and
two minutes later laid a black-tipped
olive finger upon the comment: “On
this account he is cross and a little
feverish.”
He had lost his place again and was
referring me to the matter of the baby's
teething, which occurs suddenly a little
farther on. I snatched the book and
turned to the dog's-eared page on
which is to be found the safe and
almost universal appeal: “If you do
not see to everything, who else will?”
This never fails to rouse in him an
almost tearful anxiety to please me. He
took up the jug and went in search of
hotter water, pausing only to turn a
page and plant his left thumb for a
moment upon the unexpected senti-
ment: “Nothing that is impure will
enter Heaven.”
Brooding over the precise interpre-
tation to be put upon this I looked for
the more strictly literary portion of the
Manual which lies towards the end of
the book, and had just discovered some
entrancing proverbs when Moonuswamy
returned with his little jug of lukewarm
water.
“‘Even a rat has five wives in
harvest time,’” I murmured, my eyes
on the book, wondering whether this
is indeed a zoological fact; and then
Moonuswamy, panting respectfully over
my shoulder, pointed further down the
page. I looked and read: “Will the
temple cat worship the deity 2"
I think of reverting to the language
of signs. He

IN THE BEST OF CAUSES.
Mr. Punch desires to appeal very strongly on behalf of
our Royal Navy Prisoners of War. The Ladies' Emer-
gency Committee of the Navy League, under the presidency
of Lord BERESFORD, sends parcels of food, clothing, books
and money regularly to every R.N. prisoner of war in
Germany and Austria. Four guineas a month is spent on
each prisoner. An added attraction is lent to these gifts
where the giver “adopts,” either entirely or partially, some
particular prisoner and thus creates a personal relationship
which is greatly appreciated. The Committee has tried
to avoid public appeals, and has carried out its work as
silently as the Service to whose needs it devotes itself.
Mr. Punch greatly hopes that some of his kind readers will
make themselves individually responsible for the assistance
of these gallant men, to whose courage and endurance we
owe our safety. All contributions, however small, will be
welcome. Cheques should be made payable to The Ladies'
Committee of the Navy League, and addressed to the
Hon. Secretary, Mrs. HERBERT FULLER, 56, Queen Anne
Street, Cavendish Square, W.1, who will gladly supply
any further information.

..] indeed at the crisis of Jack's
AT THE PLAY.
“THE LAW DIVINE.”
MR. H. W. Esmond's new comedy is
a love-play pure and simple—a de-
scription to be qualified by the recogni-
tion of some intriguing doubles ententes
and a rather muddled (if any) plot.
Love is the only thing that matters in
the wide wide world; Woman's busi-
ness and glory is to hold and inspire
Man. The Mohammedan hypothesis,
briefly, and Mr. ESMOND's version of
the Law Divine.
Jack La Bas, novelist, thirty-eight,
temp. captain, three wounds, is at the
moment acting Controller of Potatoes
at the War Office. What he doesn't
control is his habit of discuss-
ing his domestic troubles and
his sense of grievance that his
pretty committee-ridden wife,
Edie, thinks the telephone the
most important thing in her
(separate) bedroom. We assist
fate. This sort of thing has
been going on for a year in
Hampstead.
The author affects the unities.
“With the exception of a
period late in the evening when
Jack La Bas takes the boys to
the theatre the action of the
play is continuous.” It is in-
deed a crowded hour and three-
quarters for Jack when it really
gets going. (1) Colloquy on
love with the amazingly frank
young woman, Claudia, which
has all the air of a serious flirta-
tion, in which the agitated Jack,
apparently much to her dis-
appointment, manfully keeps
himself in hand. (2) Prophecy
by Claudia that at any moment
a woman may enter his life.
(3) Instantaneous entry of woman, who
performs the odd evolution of turning
out all the sitting-room lights and stand-
ing — a very exquisite white-furred
widow—in the abnormally fierce light
of the hall, for effect. This is something
like coming into a man's life, and I
don't wonder at (4) Claudia's bouncing
out of the room and slamming the door.
(5) Tender love scene between hero
and widow, ending in particularly im-
passioned kiss and impounding by hero,
who gets a bit above himself, of key of
widow's flat, restored under pressure
of virtue (or prudence) triumphant in
owner of key. (6) Entry of a woman
into wife's life. It is the mother of
the widow (she also turns out all the
sitting-room lights: a family custom
apparently, light-saving mania perhaps
—unless, indeed, could it really have
been a brainy “idea" of the actor-

author-producer? If so he can have no
notion of its preposterous effect). She
has come to warn the wife of her man's
goings-on. (7) Visit of Jack (with boys)
to His Majesty's Theatre, still fed-up.
(8) Air-raid. (9) Return to champagne
supper utterly unexpected, to find a de-
voted, soft, gauzily-gowned provokingly
attractive woman in place of the untidy,

automaton of the past year and after-
noon. Alternative title—Cupid's Quick

There was a pretty scene between Jack
(Mr. H. W. Esmond) and the widow

was less effective (with no excuse pro-
vided by Miss JEssIE WINTER, who
looked charming), he attitudinised too
much, and I may say that in this
connection the pose of the Discobolus
is not appropriate.
Particularly good was a little scene
between the widow's, mother (Miss
MARIE ILLINGTON.—easily distinguished
from the widow's mite) and Jack's wife,
well written and excellently played.
And the very amusing turns of the two
boys, Ted of the senior service (Mr. PAT
SoMERSET), and Bill, surely the very
youngest private in the British army
(Mr., or perhaps Master, WILLIAMs), in
the main a sort of Humpsti-Bumsti-
Two-Macs affair, was very generally
appreciated. And it was jolly to see

“EYES OF YOUTH.”
We should all have been glad to
welcome Miss GERTRUDE ELLIoTT at
the St. James's in a play of more con-
spicuous interest than Eyes of Youth.
One understands perfectly the tempta-
tion to a leading lady of a part which
enables her to appear as (in the present
drama) a young girl hesitating between
three suitors—poor Peter, rich Robert
and dubious Louis; her dull duty to a
duller father; a great career as a singer.
She is also offered (in glimpses of alter-
native futures with the aid of the crystal
of a mysterious and accommodating
Yogi) existence as a jaded school-marm
(this through waiting for Louis), as
an unnecessarily naughty opera-singer
(this for choosing the stage
“career”), and as an innocent
divorcée reduced to beggary
with a dash of Ophelia's wit-
lessness (this owing to a mar-
riage with the opulent Robert).
But it is a temptation which I
could wish had been resisted,
for it seems to me that the kine-
ma-inspired authors, Messrs.
MAX MARCIN and CHARLEs
GUERNoN, were restrained by
no laws of plausibility or sense
of character, and were masters
rather of mechanical than dra-
matic contrivance. Why should
the faithful Peter, for instance,
have died in South America
because Gina, the heroine,
selected Louis, and why should
she have become a prosperous
haunter of smart restaurants if
she married Robert 2 While
the school-mistress, the star,
the injured wife were not one
woman after five years of three
differing environments but
three frankly and fundament-
ally different women.
Had Gina had more than three
guesses we might have been there yet.
Irather wished she could have seen her-
self after five years with Peter; or five
years after poisoning her father, which
really seemed the most urgent business,
for I have rarely seen a stage-father of
such unplumbable futility. He had
just failed in business (even this is un-
plausible: he would have failed years
ago); but let no one say that he was
not a man of a receptive mind, for
when Gina pointed out that, instead of
closing down the business, he had only
to look at the matter with Eyes of
Youth and let his son Kenneth build
it all up again, he received the sugges-
tion with enthusiasm, though it simply
hadn't occurred to him before.
It remained to one to enjoy the good
patches. Miss GERTRUDE ELLIOTT was
at her best in the dressing-room scene

in the Paris Opera House—in fact as a
detached effect the whole scene was
excellent of its kind, with a sudden
death from one of those fatal bullet
wounds in the foreleg which are so
common in stage murders. Mr. DAG-
NALL's study of the impresario, Salvo,
was not only a quite admirable piece
of impersonation, but, by appearing
throughout in the same character, he
contrived to create the illusion that one
was sitting in one place at one play
rather than visiting a succession of
kinemas in a nightmare.
Certainly the team of school-children,
trained by Miss ITALIA CoNTI, did great
credit to their coach. They were the
perfect little beasts they were meant to
be. I am curious to know whether
little American girls in real life are
called (forexample)“Sunday,” “Dinka”
and “Pippyn,” or only when they be-
come little actresses. None of the other
players had long enough innings to get
well set and show their form, but the
kind-hearted detective of Mr. ALEc
ALVES, the Opera House manager of
Mr. HERMAN DE LANGE and the Russian
Tenor of Mr. ARTHUR WIRoux seemed
to be meritorious short studies. I

Sergeant-Major Caleb Hawker
Is a most prolific talker.
Could he wear a tighter dress
P'raps he'd talk a little less;
But I cannot think—can you, Sir?—
What would happen were it looser.
Always talking to a crowd
Makes his voice a trifle loud.
It, in fact, is like the full
Mellow bellow of a bull,
And the cows in fields hard by
Quite instinctively reply.
When he comes upon parade
Brigadiers and Colonels fade;
Gilded hats grow very pale,
Rookies' knees begin to fail;
Roaring Sergeants cease to rant,
Puny is the Adjutant.
Once I saw some young recruits
Make a mess of their salutes;
Hawker didn't say a lot,
But he said it loud. 'Twas not
What he said that scared the boys,
Not the substance, but the noise.
After merely two short hours
Those recruits resembled flowers
Plucked at noon in summer's heat—
Prone they lay at Hawker's feet.
Nevermore they made reply

Never could I disobey;

“No,” said Mr. Brown, tapping his
second egg, “it is not a mistake. Jones

He knows that the additional stamp
may be affixed by the payee, and he is

the cheque and remind him of the new
regulation,” he added with a frown,
and on sitting down to write to Jones
the same evening satire seemed to be
indicated as the most satisfactory
method.
“But you told me,” Mrs. Brown
expostulated when he read the letter
aloud with not unnatural pride, “that
you felt certain Mr. Jones had not
made a mistake.”
“He can't have forgotten that since
the first of September every cheque
requires an extra penny stamp,” was
the answer.

that he has 2."
“That,” said Mr. Brown, “is irony.”
“What is the difference between
irony and a falsehood?" asked Mrs.
Brown.
“The one seeks to hide a fact and
the other to show it more plainly,” he
replied.
When three days had passed without
an answer, Mr. Brown wrote again,
and towards the end of a week he
began to show symptoms of irritability,
coming down to breakfast a few minutes
earlier than usual to examine the post,
and remarking emphatically that he
“couldn't understand Jones.”
“Perhaps your letters have mis-
carried,” Mrs. Brown suggested. “You
know how very irregular the posts are
just now.”
“The best way will be for you to go
and call on Mrs. Jones and introduce
the subject casually in the course of
conversation. Not too plainly. Just a
hint,” said Mr. Brown; and his wife
dutifully set out the following afternoon
in the rain. “Did you hear anything
about the cheque?” he asked on her
return, whereupon Mrs. Brown opened
her handbag and laid the draft on the
table. “Ah, that's better,” he said,
regarding the additional penny stamp
with approval. “I should like to know
why he didn't send it back before.”
“He said you told him on no account
to hurry, but to take his own time
about it.”

rubbing his palms together.
“Still,” was the answer, “he did say
there was something ironical in the
situation.”
“How 's that ?”
Brown.
“You were so anxious to save a
penny that you didn't mind spending
five shillings: in addition to the two
three-half-penny stamps you used on
your letters to Mr. Jones.”
“Five shillings " " exclaimed Mr.
Brown.
“He was thinking of my taxi,” said
Mrs. Brown. “It was raining so fast
that I felt bound to keep it waiting.”
“That's the worst of a man like
Jones,” Mr. Brown retorted. “He can
never understand that it is the principle
of the thing that matters, and there's
nothing I dislike so much as pro-
crastination.”
“If you give me a ten-shilling note,”
said Mrs. Brown, opening her bag
again, “and I give you five shillings,

WE are back again and we know it, having spent three
weeks of mixed weather close to the coast. Even if all
memory of our departure and our three weeks' stay were
wiped out of our minds, we should still be sure by several
infallible signs that we have been away from home, because
(1) the dogs have come to the verge of the garden to meet
us. They have been brushed and made tidy within an
inch of their lives. As soon as they see us they make an
unrebuked rush and all begin to scream at the tops of their
voices. Having upset most of us they run ahead towards
the house, where we find them occupying all the best chairs
in the best room. Because (2) we have the feeling that
having packed nothing that we want, we have lost all our
luggage, and because (3) we have as a matter of fact lost
two pieces containing everything we need. Because (4) the
gardener has come to the station to meet us. When we step
out of the train he smiles his annual smile, but is promptly
recalled to gloom by a mention of the weather, which seems
to have played him the worst imaginable tricks. Because
(5) the library has been cleaned and reduced to order. All the
books have been taken out, presumably dusted and certainly
put back again, the housemaid's idea being that they
should number from right to left and not, in accordance
with a stupid prejudice, from left to right. Because (6)
everything at home looks so comfortable, so bright and so
delightful. Muriel's napkin ring still rolls off the table if
placed in a certain position; Anna's salt-sifter surrenders
three pinches of salt and then goes on strike; Beatrix's
silver mug loses its balance but by a miracle of ingenuity
on her part is not upset; while Frederick's coat-sleeve
performs its stunt of catching up and concealing his knife.
All the old familiar things in fact do the old familiar

A little White Lady with a wildflower face.
Among the ragged-robin, so the old wives tell,
Where nod the knowing crane’s-bill and the Canterbury-
bell,
You sometimes see her walking by the little wishing-well.
A-wishing at the wishing well, as wise folk should,
I saw a sudden brightness in the green-gold wood,
And Something drifted by me where the lad's-love blows
As softly as the petals of a white wild-rose
Or mist along the water when the water-lilies close.
Oh! LAwRENCE might have painted her, the sweet-faced
shade;
I seem to see her sitting in her glimmering brocade,
Her lips a little parted and her soft hands pressed
To the daintiest of posies at her pretty white breast
(And if her heart were heavy, why, the painter never
guessed).
I think she had a lover, though I scarce know who ;
Perhaps he led his regiment at famous Waterloo;
Perhaps his bones are lying there, where brave men fell;
But still she never wearies, so the old wives tell,
A-wishing and a-wishing at the little wishing-well.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REVENONS-NOUs A NOTRE CHEVREUIL.
“I CAN'T think”—the Colonel was
talking—“what some fellow in Punch
means by suggesting that people don't
like venison. Of course they do—if
they've got any sense and so long as
it's been hanging long enough.”
“And the plate is hot,” said the
Doctor.
“And so long as there's some fat
with it,” said the Commander (with
wavy stripes). -
“Of course,” the Colonel agreed.
“But all that 's understood.”
“I didn't read the article,” said the
Commander. “What did it say?” .
“Oh,” the Colonel replied, “it was
all about everyone passing on their
gifts of venison until they had to be
buried—I mean until the venison had
to be buried. The usual joke. I sup-
pose,” he added thoughtfully, “it’s
pretty difficult having to be funny
every week.”
We were all silent for a while, pon-
dering upon this reflection.
“I can't think,” the Colonel con-
tinued, “where the joke began. It
can't be a very old one, because in the
middle-ages venison was a standing
dish. Deer-stealing wouldn't have been
so popular if people hadn't liked veni-
son. You don't steal things you don't
like.”
“Wasn't there some poet fellow who
stole deer” the Commander inquired.
“Yes, of course,” said the Doctor:
“SHAKSPEARE. SHAKSPEARE knew a
good thing when he saw it, I'll be
bound.” -
“Then,” asked the Colonel, “when
did this foolish objection to venison
come in 2'' -
“It must be largely fancy, of course,”
said the Doctor. “In fact I can prove
it. I know of a case where the same
people both vilified venison and loved
it.”
“But how 2" we began.
“I’ll tell you. There's a hospital
I'm interested in which belongs to
Lord Blank. About forty beds and full
up ever since the War really began.
At first we had very little difficulty
about food, but last year the shortage
set in and Blank, who has a herd of
deer in his park, thought it would be
a good plan to substitute venison for
butcher's meat. So he had some deer
killed, and when they were ready the
matron broke what she thought was
the glad news to the patients. Big,
comfortable, jolly woman. ‘There's a
treat for you to-day,' she said; “some-
thing we don't often get . . .' and she
went on working the thing up to make
them excited and then sprang the
wonderful fact upon them. But when
she dropped her shell it was a dud.
The very word “venison' seemed to
disgust them. How that was I know
no more than you do; but there you
are.”
“What I always say,” the Colonelin-
terrupted. “It’s one of the mysteries.”
“It was too late,” the Doctor con-
tinued, “to get anything else for dinner
even if the matron was weak enough
to give way. So the venison was served,
but hardly a man would touch it; and
when Blank called the next morning
to look round and put his usual ques-
tions about the men's comfort and so
on, one of them asked if his lordship
would be so kind as to instruct the
matron not to give them venison again.
They would rather go without meat at
all, and so on.
“Blank was thunderstruck, as it came
as a surprise. Somehow he hadn't seen
the matron that morning and therefore
knew nothing. But he didn't commit
himself and came to the matron and
me and told us about it. He was very
cross. “It's a pack of nonsense,' he
said. “Some of the best bucks in
England.’”
“Of course;it is nonsense,'
Colonel.
“The matron,” the Doctor continued,
“told him that some of them wouldn't
even taste it.” -
“It's just a superstition,” the Col-
onel said. “Dislike of the unfamiliar,
unwillingness to make any experiment.”
“Exactly so,” the Doctor agreed, and
continued his story. “‘Well,' said his
lordship, “they've got to learn sense.
Go on giving it to them, matron, but
cook it in some other way and call
it mutton. Tell them I shan’t trouble
them with any more deer; tell them
I'm giving them the very best of my
Southdowns instead.'
“That was at the beginning of the
season,” the Doctor concluded. “At
the end of it the patients thanked his
lordship for his great kindness and
consideration in letting them off the
venison and substituting mutton in-
stead. They had never, they said, had
mutton that could compare with it.”

WOTAN'S WAY.
OLD Wotan was a deity adored by ancient Huns,
Who as the god of thunder controlled the heavenly guns,
And in our age he held the stage in places where they sing
And play the great Tetralogy we briefly call the Ring.
In figure he was ursine, extremely broad and fat,
His beard was long and shaggy and he wore a wondrous hat;
He was the heaviest father that ever took the floor,
And the world's long-distance champion-belt for monologue
he wore.
So, wishing to pay honour to this ancient Teuton god,
Who tried to rule his daughters with a Rhadamanthine rod,
The High Command conferred his name upon the vital
“switch"
That links Drocourt and Quéant with tunnel, wire and ditch.
Old Wotan was a German, so you couldn't shift his line;
Besides it would be sacrilege, for Wotan was divine;
And so for twice a twelvemonth the Hunnish hosts relied
On Wotan's indestructible impenetrable hide.
But even super-Germans are wont at times to nod,
And to borrow Wotan's aegis was indubitably odd;
For dark decline o'erwhelmed his line; he saw his godhead
Wane
And his stately palace vanish in a red and ruinous rain.
-
The sequel shows that legend may foreshadow solid fact,
For the vaunted line of Wotan has at last completely cracked;
And as his kingdom crumbled with its Pagan creed outworn,
His . and trench have yielded to the blows of BYNG and
ORNE.

The Early Life and Adventures of Sylvia Scarlett (SECKER)
breaks a silence that had already lasted too long for those
(including myself) who regard Mr. CoMPTON MACKENziE as
the most important of our modern novelists. Now that I
have read it and attempt to consolidate my impressions, I
think I am safe in predicting that the book will give its
author's admirers no disappointment certainly (in several
respects it is the best thing Mr. MACKENZIE has yet done),
but perhaps surprise; chiefly because its treatment is not
in the least that of the earlier volumes. You remember
Sylvia, no doubt, as the enigmatic young woman in whose
ambiguous protection Michael found Lily during the second
book of Sinister Street. Here we have her own story, and
incidentally that of Michael and Lily and other of Mr.
MACKENZIE's people, brought down to a point some time
later than this meeting. The difference in style of which I
have spoken is largely one of pace and results naturally from
the individuality of the central figure. Sylvia is a person
of such varied and even violent activity that the tale must
hurry to keep abreast of her. There is no time here for the
exquisite and melodious beauty of Carnival or the delicate
sadness that haunted the introspections of Sinister Street.
It is all movement, ranging the habitable globe, intention-
ally a little restless in effect, but so vigorously alive as to
leave the reader out of breath perhaps, but never out of
interest. For swiftness of action and development and the
growth of character the book emphatically marks a further
advance in Mr. MACKENZIE's art—even if now and again
I found myself regretting the prose-poetry of his more
leisured moods. Certainly however these early adventures
of Sylvia have sharpened my curiosity for the volume
promised shortly, in which (I gather from the title) her
fortunes are to be definitely mingled with those of Michael.
This should be at least an interesting conjunction.

[SEPTEMBER 11, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I heartily welcome the approach of Mr. ARCHIBALD
MARSHALL, bringing with him another of his delightful
novels of country-life as it was in England before the War.
Mr. MARSHALL is indeed the prose laureate of the English
countryside, with its houses and its inhabitants. He has
already told the story of the Clintons in a series of volumes,
and now he breaks new ground in Abington Abbey
(STANLEY PAUL). In this he tells the story of the Graftons,
a fascinating family, consisting of George Grafton, banker
and Briton, and his three daughters, not forgetting young
George, the son, who is an admirable creation and a pro-
vider of much fun. Having found a house which is exactly
the one for them, money being no object, they abandon
London and settle in the country. Mr. MARSHALL, in his
calm and persuasive style, develops the various situations
in which the members of the family find themselves. The
story is told with perfect skill T - -
and good taste, and in the judg-
ment of at least one reader *
calls loudly for a sequel.
Dr. MUEHLoN was a director
of KRUPPs and in receipt of a
salary which is variously stated
as £10,000 or £20,000. He dis-
approved so violently of the
attitude of the German Govern-
ment and their determination
to enter upon war, no matter at
what cost, that he first of all
resigned his post, and later (in
1917) secured the publication of
a memorandum in which he de-
nounced the violent and brutal
action of his countrymen and
charged the official classes with
having provoked the War. Hav-
ing done this, he retired for
safety to Berne, and has now.
published a translation of his
Diary (CAssell). The Diary
covers only the first four months
of the War, but it is a for-
midably reasoned document and
leaves no loophole for escape to
the guilty ruffians who have
plunged Europe and America
into bloodshed. The Diary is
was compelled to wear while working among the refugees
will be received with many sympathetic smiles.
The Savignys (HopDER AND STOUGHToN) is a work of
art, which is more than can be said for most of the
hasty novels which come my way these days. I am still
baffled as to the exact sex of the author, G. B. LANCASTER,
for this book shows an equivocal sympathy with both
the feminine and the masculine points of view. To all
who take an interest in county life of modern England
and have an appetite for a carefully-constructed story I
commend its theme—the pride of an ancient house cul-
minating in a battle-royal between the imperious mother,
determined to maintain traditions before all else, and the
headstrong son, determined to develop himself according to
THE SINEWS OF WAR.

himself. This collision between the irresistible force and
--~~~~) the immovable body makes ex-
cellent drama, the election at
Coombe, practically a contest
between mother and son, being
most effective. But the several
incidents which go to make up
the action lack novelty and ap-
|pear to be culled from other
! books rather than from first-
hand study of life. This ap-
plies notably to the other son's
literary career, drug-taking
habits, shallow wife and dying
child. A good style is a little
spoilt by excess of startling and
alliterative epithets. As for the
dialogue, so long as Old Podley
and Lady Rolls handle it, it
is delightful in its point and
humour; when, however, the
two brothers get talking about
their souls it is at times most
tediously drawn out and solemn.
But it is Old Podley who opens
the book and Lady Rolls who
| concludes it, and all that is in
between is far and away too
good to miss on account of a
flaw or two.
The Chestermarke Instinct
(ALLEN AND UNwiN) may best
be described as a realistic de-
well worth reading, even though or ºr -----
the writer shows no special liking for our own people. As
a shrewd forecast I may quote the following, written on
August 22nd, 1914: “However important yesterday's battle
may have been, it cannot be more than the first scene in
the first act of a long tragedy. In all probability, as the
war proceeds, cur victories over France will recede further
and further into the background, bringing us no profit.”
The rush of War-literature continues, and to keep pace
with it is an impossibility, but in many ways it will be
tective story, meaning by that that the detectives involved
are no super-sleuths but the patient and not too subtle opera-
tors who make Scotland Yard a synonym for perseverance
rather than inspiration. But if Mr. J. S. FLETCHER's sleuths
are not super-sleuths the most hardened fiction-fiend will
hesitate to suggest that Joseph Chestermarke is not a super-
villain. One cannot help feeling that the interesting skein of
mystery could have been finally unravelled to everybody's
satisfaction without showing up Joseph as such a monster
in the last chapter and spoiling the almost sleepy realism
a pity if Round About Bar-le-Duc (SKEFFINGTON) is over- of the story by introducing effects that savour more of the
whelmed by the flood. Miss SUzANNE DAY worked for Monte Cristo than an English market-town. But it is per-

[SEPTEMBER 18, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLAYING THE GAME.
I TELL this, the true version of the
story, that justice may be done. The re-
putation of my regiment for sportsman-
like behaviour has suffered grievously
and quite unjustly. This then is what
actually occurred.
When we were in Rest Camp at
Villeneuve St. Julien, we (the 6th
K.R.L.I.) challenged the Staff of the
F.M.D. to a cricket-match. It was
only after they had accepted the chal-
lenge that we learned that Frysop was
attached to them. Still, in face of this
terrific news I think we may flatter
ourselves that we never seriously got
the wind up. “We may foozle him
out somehow,” we said ; “and as for
his bowling, all bowling's more or less
alike on a pitch full of shell-holes like
this one.” But we were sorry we had
been a bit patronising to the F.M.D.
about the match.
We went in first and made 125, and
they had compiled 95 for 5 wickets,
with Frysop in and well set, when the
other batsman skied a ball over the
bowler's head. While it was still in
the air and the batsmen were running
on the chance that long-on, who had
some distance to go, would miss the
catch, we became aware that a pair of
mules were advancing rapidly from the
north, little retarded by the efforts of a
rider who uneasily bestrode one of
them.
We watched in some anxiety, mea-
suring the distance with our eyes.
Would long-on reach the ball before
the mules got there?
I do not wish to boast, but I may
say that from the first I never doubted
that they would all arrive together.
And so it was. At the exact moment
when the ball fell into the hands of
long-on the off mule caught him in the
back, and he thereafter became but
part of a confusion of man and mule-
heels.
Now a mule is least dangerous when
most aggressive, and vice-versa. The
mule somnolent, thinking, with half-
closed eyes, gently of its mother, will
suddenly reach out five yards with its
heels and break your leg or your collar-
bone or both. But the mule rampant
will jump all over you and pass on
without doing any damage at all. All
who have learnt to know (if not to
love) the mule will bear me out, but
Frysop, nurtured in the sheltered offices
of the F.M.D., knew less than nothing
of mules. Horrified at the sight, or
rather at the disappearance, of long-on,
he left the batsman's wicket, at which
he had by this time arrived, and has.
tened towards the scene of the disaster,
further encouraged to do so by the fact
that the bowler was running in that
direction also. The bowler, however,
was moved by quite other motives. He
had seen too many men under mules
to be disturbed by such a trifle, and
was running to gather the ball, which
had at the moment of impact with the
mule been shot from long-on's hands
in his direction. He picked it up, and,
naturally concluding that Frysop was
starting for a second run, flung it to
the wicket-keeper. The wicket-keeper,
under the same impression, whipped
off the bails, and, as the other batsman
was still at the bowler's wicket gazing,
fascinated, at the mule “mix-up,"
Frysop was out.
I must say for Frysop himself that
he took it in good part and never ques-
tioned that the whole affair was the
result of a mistake. But unfortunately
the conduct of the other members of
the F.M.D., especially the five remain-
ing batsmen, who only compiled about
ten between them, leaving us winners
by twenty runs, was not so creditable.
It was in vain that we pointed out that
the catch would undoubtedly have been
held had the mules not joined unbidden
in the game. They replied that this
would only have resulted in the loss of
a batsman, who was nothing compared
with Frysop; indeed, they repeated
this so loudly and so often that I
thought it must be a little painful for
the batsman concerned. It was in
vain that we called their attention to
the subsequent indifferent fielding of
the somewhat shaken long-on ; in vain
that the bowler and the wicket-keeper
protested their good faith, and pointed
out that the root of the trouble lay in
Frysop's regrettable ignorance of the
habits of the mule. While accusing
us of frightfulness they themselves
were guilty of a most venomous form
of hate, and when, three days later, we
played the Machine Gunners they came
down to the ground, and, when we
were having rather a leather-hunting,
shouted, “Why don't you send for your
performing mules?" I have been glad
therefore to tell the true version of the
story. Some doubtless will still con-
tinue to think the worst of us; that is
inevitable, and we can afford to ignore
them. The great body of fair-minded
people will see that we were entirely
innocent of evil intent.

You in your flight, Oswallow, swallow !
Oswallow, swallow, swallow,
I shall sit at home and freeze
In the night-lit gloom
Of a fireless room,
And shiver and shake and sneeze,
And croak and cough;
But you get off -
To your warm Antipodes
I too would fly, if aptly-fashioned,
To a land where light and heat weren't
rationed;

Hurry, bird, hurry!

Miss X. (oN war-work AGAINST THE HUNs) succeeds IN HER HUMANE DESIRE To Avoid KILLING AN ENGLISH SPARROW.
LETTERS OF A BOY SCOUT.
IV.
DEAR UNCLE,--I am working very
hard for an amberlance badge and I
wish you were out of hospital so I
could practice on your leg. Belfitt,
our petrol leader, says it is a good idea
to keep an eye on stout old gentlemen
who may have fits for he knew a boy
scout who got five pounds for helping
an old gentleman to have a stroke com-
fortable, and if any of us gets five
pounds it is to go to the petrol funds.
So I follow old gentlemen who seem
likely, but up to now they have been
very disappointing, not going into fits
at all but into public-houses, which is
unpatriotic in wartime. So please come
out of hospital as soon as you can for
the petrol wants your leg. It is no use
bandaging well legs because it doesn't
hurt if it isn't done proper. Now you
could tell us just when we hurt your leg.
Belfitt is very trubbled about the
War for he says if we go slamming
the Huns like this what will become
of the Invashun and the scouts will
stand no chance of a show, and he had
set his heart on the Cuckoo . Petrol
capturing the ChowN PRINCE. He says
we never do get a show and that the
Government ought to have called out
the Scouts directly the police struck.
And Belfitt says that if he could sit in
Scotland Yard finding out murders he
would be in his proper spear.
Belfitt says that scouts should be the
sole of honour and truthfulness in all
circs. He says always tell the truth
even to schoolmasters—only his school.
master being a beest is an excepshun
which proves the rule.
We helped at a War Concert the
other night giving out programs and
showing people their seats, and the
Lady Sekketary said aſterwards, “Do
you Scouts expect refreshment?”
So Belfitt, being always truthful,
said, “We do our work for the honour
of old England, but as scouts have to
speak the truth I must say we did
expect something.” Only the singers
had eat everything up and Belfitt says
that the Lady Sekketary had no tack,
because tackful people never offer things
they haven't got. - -
We put up an air-rifle shooting range
in our garden because Belfitt's pater
has a green-house and raises Cane.
But the pater has stopped it because
the old lady next door got a pellet in
her false teeth which is imposible unless
she climbed the wall and put her head
in front of the target. And she said
her hens was shot at so much that
they wouldn't lay. Now no scout would
be crooil enough to shoot at a hen only
when a hen crosses the range. When he
is aiming he has to think of his country
first and not any old hen. I hope that
when you come you will explain to the
pater that unless we are crack shots
like Dead Eye Dick there will be no
hope for the country when we go to
the War. Do you think the War will
last till I am eighteen for the Pater says
he is going to make me an analitical
chemist and that the wars of the future
will be won in the labboratories. But
if it's as slow as at our Labb at school
we might just as well have peace at
once. So do come and argue with him
for I want to be a professional bomber
going to Berlin reglar.
Your loving nephew JIM.
“It is stated that Major — intends to sell
his ancestral estates in Mull. The estates

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE UNINVITED MASCOT.
MILESTONES.
DEAR MR.PUNCH,-I wonder whether
you noticed how very appropriately Sir
FRANCIS LLoyd's rescinding of the old
order about the attendance of officers
at subscription hops fitted in with the
smashing of the Switch Line? The
evening papers had the news of Jerry's
collapse; next morning's contained an
official announcement that officers
might now appear at dances “in public
places” (though I hope none of them
will hastily conclude that this sanctions
the practice of two-stepping down
Shaftesbury Avenue or any indiscre-
tions of that kind). What a very
admirable and appropriate recognition
of our victory! And what a contrast
to the curmudgeonly attitude of the
Fuel and Light autocrat, who straight-
away weighed in with an explanation
that even if we'd recaptured all the
French pit-heads it wouldn't mean a
ha'porth more coal on the kitchen fire
this winter! But what I want to say
is this: Why not apply Sir FRANcis
LLoyd's principle all round hence-
forward? Every time we give Jerry
something more to be going on with,
why not give ourselves something too,
in the shape of therestitution of another
of our pre-war privileges? When
Cambrai goes we might all be allowed
an extra ounce with afternoon tea, and
perhaps just one sugary thing in the
way of cakes. Lille might be the
signal for releasing an extra tank or
two of Scotch from bond, thereby con-
veying our thanks to the renowned
51st Division by rescuing its country
from the terrible drought that I am told
has overtaken it. Back on the Meuse
would be good enough for something
really dramatic—permission to have
supper after a theatre, say, or a whole
tin of petrol to every holder of a motor
licence. The system could be worked
on an ascending scale, which included
such amazing things as lots of real
butter and beef-steaks, because the far-
ther back we hustled them the nearer
the end must be and the less need for
husbanding our resources.
Don't you think it's a bon idea, Sir,
and worthy your distinguished support?
We're not a particularly demonstrative
people, and bells and bunting don't
mean very much after all. But here
you would have every stage in the re-
ceding tide of German fortunes indelibly
plotted out on the sands of individual
memory. Besides we don't want to
leave everything of this kind until
Peace is actually declared, otherwise
we shall be as helpless as prisoners
staggering into daylight after half a
lifetime in the cells. Far better regain
our liberty by easy stages, chipping
bits off our fetters as we go along. And
then, when we really are marching
down Unter den Linden, the only
thing left to do will be for both Houses
to assemble in Palace Yard and solemnly
commit to the flames the last remaining
fragments of an emaciated Dora.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
TAILS UP.
TO THE LAND WORKERS.
STILL and warm and close together
Slept the seeds of ripening grain,
Whispering through the wintry weather
Of the grave where they had lain.
Spring came calling through the
meadows
Where the little blades pierced
through ;
God brought sunshine to the shadows,
But the rest. He left to you.
So you served the hidden treasure
With an unaccustomed hand,
Watching till in fullest measure
Beauty clothed the empty land;
Through the summer, as a token,
God sent sunshine, rain and dew,
Kept His promise still unbroken,
But the rest He left to you.
Where you drove the lonely furrow
With the sleeping seeds below,
Now across a world of sorrow
Golden sheaves of harvest show.
God's glad sunshine lies upon her,
Fed with wind and rain and dew,
And He knows you did with honour
All the work He left to you.

HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.
(Frau Professor KRUMMBEIN and Frau General roN STUMM.)
Erau Krummbein. Well, then, how goes it, Frau General?
Is the news from the Herr General good?
Frau von Stumm. He is alive at least, and in these days
one must be thankful for that. How goes it with the
Herr Professor 2
[Sounds of deep groaning from another part of the
house are heard.
Frau K. There you have your answer.
are the Professor. -
Frau von S. But you are making fun with me. How
can a groan, even if it is a good groan, be a Professor?
Frau K. I will tell you that. This is the hour when the
Professor practises his will to victory, after first practising
his will to cheerfulness. Are we not told by the ALL-HIGHEST
and his HINDENBURG that we who are left in the homeland
must do what we can to keep up the spirits of the people?
Frau von S. Now I begin to understand.
Frau K. The poor Professor does not find, I am afraid,
that he does much good, though his attempts at cheerful-
ness are as strong as he can make them. They cause the
perspiration to run from the forehead, and those groans that
you hear are the proof that he is not working altogether
In Valn.
Frau von S. The Professor is certainly a most patriotic
man, and if all were like him we should soon, I think, win
the War and teach the English and the French not to
interfere with us any more. But does the Professor only
groan, or does he do other things as well?
Frau K. Oh, he does other things too. For instance, he
will not show other people that he is pale and unhappy,
but when he goes out for a walk he puts a red colour on
his cheeks and smiles all the time, so that people may say,
“That is the Herr Professor Krummbein. He has certainly
got some good news, for his face is red with rejoicing and
he keeps on smiling all the time. Certainly he has the
will to cheerfulness.” And then they try to smile too, but
they do not always succeed.
Frau von S. No, they are not all so patriotic or so well
educated as the Professor. It is for him to set an example,
and that he does magnificently. But have you heard the
latest trick of our enemies?
Frau K. Which do you mean 2 They have so many
tricks with gas and other things that it is difficult to keep
pace with them.
Frau von S. Well, it seems that when they go up in
their horrible aeroplanes they take with them tons and
tons of little printed papers, and these they scatter all over
Belgium and those parts of France in which we are fighting,
and the soldiers pick them up and read them, and when
they have read them they pass them from hand to hand
and send them home. -
Frau K. But what is printed on these papers ?
Frau von S. Oh, lies about Belgium, and who began the
war, and false things about the ALL-HIGHEST. It is shock-
ing to think that men can imagine such tales, and it is
wicked that our HINDENBURG, who has hard enough work
to keep the enemy from overwhelming us, should have to
deal with such papers at a time when he wants all his
strength for fighting.
Frau K. Yes, and it is whispered that the fighting is
not going well. Everywhere our armies have been retreat-
ing. Have you heard anything about it from your Herr
General 2
Frau von S. No, he says nothing to me. But my second
cousin, Heinrich, who is on my husband's Staff, wrote to
me that all was not going too well.
Those groans
Frau K. It is almost unbelievable that we should be
beaten, and after all the brilliant things that they have
told us.
[At this moment the Professor in the back room
breaks out with a series of groans louder than any
that have preceded them.
Excuse me for the moment, I think I must go and see
the Professor. His will to victory seems not to be going
so smoothly as usual this morning, or perhaps it is his
will to cheerfulness that has gone wrong.
ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF BINGO OUR
TRENCH DOG,
WEEP, weep, ye dwellers in the delvéd earth,
Ah, weep, ye watchers by the dismal shore
Of No Man's Land, for Bingo is no more;
He is no more, and well ye knew his worth,
For whom on bully-beefless days were kept
Rare bones by each according to his means,
And, while the Quartermaster-Sergeant slept,
The elusive pork was rescued from the beans.
He is no more and, impudently brave,
The loathly rats sit grinning on his grave.
Him mourn the grimy cooks and bombers ten,
The sentinels in lonely posts forlorn,
The fierce patrols with hands and tunics torn,
The furtive band of sanitary men.
The murmuring sound of grief along the length
Of traversed trench the startled Hun could hear;
The Captain, as he struck him off the strength,
Let fall a sad and solitary tear;
'Tis even said a batman passing by
Had seen the Sergeant-Major wipe his eye.
The fearful fervour of the feline chase
He never knew, poor dog, he never knew ;
Content with optimistic zeal to woo
Reluctant rodents in this murky place,
He never played with children on clean grass,
Nor dozed at ease beside the glowing embers,
Nor watched with hopeful eye the tea-cakes pass,
Nor smelt the heather-smell of Scotch Septembers,
For he was born amid a world at war
Although unrecking what we struggled for.
Yet who shall say that Bingo was unblest
Though all his Sprattless life was passed beneath
The roar of mortars and the whistling breath
Of grim nocturnal heavies going West ?
Unmoved he heard the evening hymn of hate,
Unmoved would gaze into his master's eyes,
For all the sorrows men for men create
In search of happiness wise dogs despise,
Finding ecstatic joy in every rag
And every smile of friendship worth a wag.
The Pessimist.

CHEQUES.
THIS new demand for an additional
stamp on cheques brought them under
discussion.
“Personally,” said the Poet, “I think
cheques the greatest invention of mod-
ern times.” -
“So long as you have a balance,”
said the Doctor.
“Or can overdraw,” said the Poet.
“But I admit,” he added, “that that's
a horrid moment when the Bank says,
‘Hold, enough.'”
“Or returns a cheque marked ‘N.E.,
said the Actor.
“What, does ‘N.E.’ mean?,” we
asked.
“No earthly.’”
“In my opinion,” said the General,
“the cheque is the greatest of all foes
to economy. If one had to pay every-
thing in money—actual notes or coins
—one would really consider one's ex-
penditure carefully. But if a few
strokes of the pen can do the business,
why, then you hardly think at all.”
“Quite true,” said the K.C. “But,
on the other hand, the cheque saves
you from robbery. If we all carried
large lumps of money about with us
there would be ten times more pocket-
picking and assaults than there are now,
and with police-strikes in the air that
would be very serious. It's no use
all
tº-
stealing a cheque-book unless you are
a forger as well as a thief.”
“Ah!” said the Doctor, “you're
talking of those little pocket cheque-
books. They're the devil! A man
who keeps his cheque-book at home
and writes his cheques there has a
chance—a faint chance—of control-
ling his affairs. But to carry a cheque-
book—that is the end of all caution.”
“Absolutely,” said the Poet. “And
the cheque-writing habit grows on you.
You find yourself paying for your meals
in that way, and that means a more
expensive wine than you would dream
of 'if you had to produce good honest
money for it. I hate paying out money
—at least I hate paying more than
seven-and-six—but I'll write a cheque
with any man.”
“I always thought,” said the Gen-
eral, “that that shop in Bond Street
where a block of cheques and a pen are
placed on every counter is much the
cleverest place in London. No doubt
they lose a little now and then through
swindlers, but they must make a large
fortune simply through the lure to ex-
travagance which is set up. Of course,
not to have to part with actual money
is the thing.”
We all sighed in agreement.
“I’ll tell you an odd thing about
cheques,” said the Doctor. “I can't
bear to cross them according to in-
structions. I'm not a testy man, but
for some reason or other it makes me
furious to have to write a lot of direc-
tions—‘aſc so and so, don't you know
—between the lines. Why?”
“I don't know why,” said the Gen-
eral, “but I have the same reluctance.”
And we found that we all had.
“It's worse than copying out an-
other man's verses,” said the Poet,
“or, in fact, copying out anything.”
“What are you discussing?” the
Club bore inquired as he joined the
dissolving flºp.
“Cheques,” I said.
“Oh ' " he said. “They're out of
date, surely. I haven't seen a pair of
check trousers for months. Why dis-
cuss the obsolete?”
“The damage will total easily $50,000 and
the sufferers are mainly Greek restaurant pro-
prietors.

remains whole.”

They have the satisfaction of knowing,
however, that after this shattering ex-
perience it will be harder than ever to
see through them.

LIGHT AND HEAT.
ONE of the compensations for the discomfort of fuel short-
age in the coming winter will be the return of the weather
as a subject of conversation, and the retirement of food and
allotments into the background.
The Esquimaux, it is said, maintain physical heat by a
generous diet of whale-blubber. There is little hope of this
commodity figuring to any extent upon the British break-
fast-table, however, for on enquiry at Billingsgate and
SELFRIDGE's we learn that there is hardly a drop in the
country.
We can thoroughly recommend the common paraſfin
lamp as giving a pleasant and adequate light. We could
recommend it still more strongly if paraffin were not so
difficult to obtain.
Householders whose gardens abut on the railway line
are busy preparing well-displayed insults to the engine-
drivers, hoping to be pelted with coal in retaliation.
At least one of the railway companies has been requested
to have the coal in the tenders of the engines covered up,
to prevent annoyance to the passengers.
It is not generally known that the landlords of Hamp-
stead are preparing a generous prize offer for the garden
ſence found to be in the best state of repair on May 1, 1919.
Following upon the announcement that certain Govern-
ment offices are to be deprived of fires, a number of civil
servants have inquired of the commissionaire at the main
ontrance of the building in which they are employed, “Is
there a bed on the premises?”
Business men travelling from Brighton who carry their
own office coal with them are requested not to convey it in
their side pockets, owing to the crowded state of the railway
compartments.
Colonel Bluster and the office staff under his control are
to be envied this winter. The Colonel possesses a natural
inability to keep cool, and he will certainly make it hot for
his clerks, whatever the weather.
FAIRY MUSIC.
WHEN the fiddlers play their tunes you may sometimes hear,
Very softly chiming in, magically clear,
Magically high and sweet, the tiny crystal notes
Of fairy voices bubbling free from tiny fairy throats.
When the birds at break of day chant their morning prayers
Or on sunny afternoons pipe ecstatic airs,
Comes an added rush of sound to the silver din—
Songs of fairy troubadours gaily joining in.
When athwart the drowsy fields summer twilight falls,
Through the tranquil air there float elfin madrigals;
And in wild November nights, on the winds astride,
Fairy hosts go rushing by, singing as they ride.
Every dream that mortals dream, sleeping or awake,
Every lovely fragile hope—these the fairies take,
Delicately fashion them and give them back again
In tender limpid melodies that charm the hearts of i.

perhaps, for the genial and kindly expression in his eyes.”

THE NEW POST-OFFICE GAME.
“LIFF,” said a cynic, “would be en-
durable if it were not for its amuse-
ments," but as there are no Piers, Pier-
rots or Picture-palaces at Bronwen we
can take comfort from our comparative
isolation. It is only comparative. If
we lack these three P.'s we get a fourth,
the Papers, soon after 8 A.M. on most
mornings, and we do not lack other
amenities. There are golf-links of ex-
cellent quality patronised by elderly
and very youthful players. We have
a massive and monumental policeman,
and a miner who cuts hair in the
evening. And we have concerts, with
London celebrities and fuzzy-haired
foreigners, at which professionals frater-
nize with amateurs. But if a vote of
the visitors were to be taken I think
that the chief attraction of Bronwen
would prove to be the Postmaster. Not
that he is highly efficient and invariably
cheerful and obliging, or that dogs—
generally suspicious of postmen—con-
gregate round the post-office. Rather
that young people adore him; and no
wonder. For this amazing Postmaster
has applied the principle of diluting
skilled labour in a revolutionary but
wholly successful manner. All young
people love to play at keeping shop,
and he has given a limited number of
the children of visitors a taste of the
real thing, without hampering the effi-
ciency of the office. Do they monkey
with the telephone? Perhaps; but for ||
the most part they stand behind the
counter and serve customers, serving
out stamps and performing other minor
duties with beaming faces, but passing
on more important requests about
“cowpons,” declaration forms, savings-
bank deposits, etc., to the regular staff.
For it is a busy office and efficient:
equal to anything. The other day,
for example, we sent a telegram to
Tokio.
It is all highly irregular and most
charming, for Mr. Jenkins has been
judicious in his selection, and the
manners of his amateur helpers are as
ood as his own, which are perfect.
It probably gives him more work in
the long run, but he gets a handsome
bonus in the affection of his youthful
assistants and the gratitude of their
parents. On wet days the post-office
is a godsend. My only regret is that
I can't give his real name, because on
formal grounds the P.M.G. might not

once know how terrible it is to be
wounded and sent to England in ad-

forget the awful dilemma with which
the hero is faced when the stern day
comes for him to cast aside pyjamas

Hospital authorities hate their guests
to appear in the streets in pyjamas, no

queer prejudice. “Other Ranks” may
stroll about in their blue lounge suits,
but gentlemen holding His Majesty's
commission can be decorative only by
stealth.

cruel practical jokes if you determine

supplied by some village wag with head-
quarters and a tailor's signboard near
the hospital. They appeared to be
built of some kind of pasteboard which
kept every wrinkle as a fixture. He

fire, it must be borne in mind, is fatal
to good clothes, and the punctures in
your uniform do not mend spontane-
ously while your person is under repair.
The obvious plan is to mark down the
garments you like best amongst those
worn by your fellow-inmates, and while
the owners are in the bathroom bribe
the Sister-in-charge to extract them
from the lockers. But convalescents
are often irritable, and Sisters-in-charge
are seldom susceptible, and in practice
you are reduced to wearing what people
will lend you. The most obliging ones,
you will discover, are always those most
unlike you in shape and with views as
to clothes which you can only regard as
anarchic. All this accounts for the
street scenes which bewilder civilians
and are so painful to A.P.M.'s. Per-
haps you were once one of those who
like their dress to be worthy of the

hear the companion of your first walk

that she wired for his London tailor.
This instance should be a warning.
It is better to appear in public in clothes

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HOLIDAY PROBLEM.
I AM going on a holiday. I have a
cat. I do not wish to take the cat with
me on the holiday. Neither has pussy
any desire to be taken. All his felinity
rises up in outrage at the prospect of
a four hours' journey in a bass bag
secured at the top by two skewers,
merely leaving an outlet for his head;
all my knowledge of the present diffi-
culties of transport warns me against
such an upwelcome addition to my
luggage; so I decide to ask a friend to
take Pussy for a fortnight. I think
of Mr. and Mrs. Whitaker, pleasant
hospitable people who I know will be
only too glad to do me a small favour
like that.
I call on the Whitakers and venture,
like little wanton boys that swim on
bladders, to proffer my request.
“I shall be awfully obliged,” I re-
mark quite easily, “if you could take
my cat for a fortnight. I can arrange
to have its milk left every day—”
I pause, struck by the significance of
the look exchanged between Mr. and
Mrs. Whitaker. There is a silence;
then they both begin to talk at once.
“We should have been only too
delighted but for Peter—”
I haven't heard of Peter before. I
inquire if he is a relative.
“Why, he's our Persian,” says Mrs.
Whitaker; “and the darling is of such
a jealous nature—"
“He can't bear other cats,” puts in
Mr. Whitaker. i
“He might kill your pussy," wails
Mrs. Whitaker.
“And we should feel the responsi-
bility,” murmurs Mr. Whitaker.
“Otherwise we should have been
perfectly delighted,” they say in unison,
“but as it is 1 -
“That's all right,” I say quite cheer-
fully, for I have other friends. “I must
ask someone who hasn't got a cat
already.” -
I remember Mrs. Flitterly. She
adores animals, I know, because she
often says so. The last time she lined
|
at our house I remember how she sat
on the rug with Pussy in her lap, and
with her fluffy head bent over him she
made a very pretty picture in the fire-
light. -
I approach Mrs. Flitterly, therefore,
without qualms. -
“I shall be awfully obliged,” I say,
“if you could take my cat for a fort-
night. I can arrange to have its
milk—”
The expression on Mrs. Flitterly's
face changes. When I want to continue
Mrs. Flitterly is talking very quickly.
“My dear, I should have loved to
have had the darling thing—I just
adore animals—if only it wasn't for
John—"
“What, have you a cat too?" I in-
quire.
“I am speaking of my husband,”
she says, a trifle coldly. “He detests
cats. I daren't have one in the house,
my dear. He would absolutely storm if
I suggested such a thing."
I thought of the extremely mild and
self-effacing Mr. Flitterly and, after
remarking that I shouldn't like to bring
down his unbridled wrath on me for a
thing like that, I depart, still cheerful.
I have suddenly remembered Mrs.
Barker, that jolly motherly soul, to
whom everyone seems to turn naturally
when in a difficulty. She hasn't a cat
and her husband is at the Front.
With renewed hope I call on Mrs.
Barker. “I have come to ask a favour,”
I say, grown a little diffident. Mrs.
Barker beams. “I should be awfully
obliged if you would take my cat for a
fortnight. I can arrange . . ." Again
I pause. Mrs. Barker's face has taken
on an aspect akin to dismay.
“Oh, my dear,"she says with genuine
regret, “I wish you had asked me
something else. I would have taken
Pussy with the greatest of pleasure if
it hadn't been for baby.”
Ah, I had forgotten. She has a baby.
“Doesn't he like cats?" I inquire.
“It isn't that ; but think how dan-
gerous it would be. How often one
reads of children being suffocated when
they're asleep by cats lying on their
| faces.” .
“But ours isn't a cat of that sort,” I
say earnestly; “there are five faces in
our household and he has never shown
the slightest desire to lie on any one of
them."
But Mrs. Barker is inexorable and
says you never know.
I depart more thoughtful than cheer-
ful and decide to ask one of the trades-
people to take pussy, paying for his
keep in base coin of the realm. I
tackle the milkman, a nice ruddy-faced
pleasant-spoken man, whom I have
always liked. I explain the situation
to him and offer two-and-sixpence a
week for Pussy's board.
“I’m sorry, Ma'am,” he says, and
suddenly I notice that he is not so
pleasant-looking as I thought. “If I
had a cat about my place,” he goes on,
“it would be pretty serious for me
with all my chicks.”
“But do people—do hens—have
chicks in September?” I ask falter-
ingly (I am town-bred and uncertain
on the point). “I always thought * *
But whatever I think he is ready for
me. “I got a sitting hatched out last
week,” he says defiantly, and goes on
to speak of the tremendous importance
of chicken-rearing in war-time, its
necessity to the nation and so on,
until he leaves me with a dazed con-
viction that if Pussy were lodged with
him for the duration of my holiday the
War would be lost to the Allies.
As a last resort I appeal to the
gardener. He is a very deaf old man,
blunt of speech, of uncertain temper,
and openly hostile to any feminine
interference. Frankly, I am afraid of
him.
“Oh, by the way, Lumpkin,” I
begin, “I should be awfully obliged if
you could take my cat --
“What's that, mum ? Take yer cat?
Want to get rid on it, hey?"
“Only for a fortnight,” I explain,
cheering up at his unexpected show of
interest.
“Wot might, d'ye say?" he asks,
being hard of hearing, which infirmity
I forgot in my eagerness to have Pussy
provided for.
“And I'll give you five shillings,
Lumpkin," I continue with palpitating
haste.
His face beams. “I’ll do 't, mum.
I've got a big tub in my backyard, an'
I'll drown the little beast to-night.”

I have just been in the store-room in
search of a bass bag. I have attached
two skewers to the bag and an addressed
label. To-morrow Pussy will accom-
pany me on my holiday.
POMONA'S LEVITY.
BENEATH the trees Sir Is AAC sat
And saw the red-cheeked apple fall,
And pondered, “Why did it do that ?
It might have landed on my hat;
It might have frolicked like a bat,
Or flown across and hit the cat
Upon the garden wall.”
But if Sir Isaac lived to-day
He would have seen the apple rise
As if it were a ball at play,
Aspiring to the very skies.
When it will fall I cannot say,
For factory-girls have lots of pay,
And farmers, fruiterers, all are gay;
Only the small boy sighs.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SINCE The Years for Rachel (Hodder AND STOUGHTON) is
a story entirely about being engaged, I suppose it is hardly
to be wondered at if it should be somewhat sentimental.
Really it is an elaborate sermon against being engaged too
long, which Miss BERTA RUCK preaches in her light and
very feminine style. Gwen, the heroine, is betrothed on
the first page; but, as the whole scheme of the tale leaves
it an open question which of the various male characters
will finally secure her, some entertainment may be derived
from the problem of spotting the bridegroom. For a time
my money hovered dubiously about an elderly and oh so
sympathetic admirer, with a grave smile and well-cut gray
suits (I told you this was a feminine book); but just in
time I detected another, one who, introduced first as a
sulky-looking schoolboy, was always so promptly hustled
into obscure corners, and generally camouflaged by the
author, that my suspicion became increasingly on the look-
out for his eventual triumph. I have said that the thing
is sentimental; now and then indeed its general sweetness
is such that, taken with afternoon tea as a sugar substitute,
it might almost be regarded as a war-economy. But Miss
Ruck's sugar is wholesome crisp stuff, with just enough
flavour in it to prevent cloying. Also I have a conviction
approaching certainty that, even if her men are a trifle
mechanical, every one of the many women who accept, or
reject, or mother, or only discuss them, is quite strikingly
true to life. This is one of the reasons for my prediction
that the tale will add greatly to its author's popularity;
though I feel bound to add a warning that the happiness
or otherwise of the dénoîment will greatly depend upon
the side of (say) forty from which the reader is able to
regard it.
Mr. PHILIPs PRICE's War and Revolution in Asiatic
Russia (ALLEN AND UNwIN) is a good deal more than the
tourist war-correspondent's record of passing events. Indeed
in the period under his review—June 1915 to the Revolution
in the March of 1917—he had ceased to be a war-corre-
spondent and wandered, a political observer and gallant
odd-job man, behind and about the South-Eastern front.
He is, like his former colleague of The Manchester Guardian,
Mr. SIDEBOTHAM, a professed Easterner, has a nice appre-
ciation of the Drang mach Osten, and with his developed
historical and political sense has been able to make an
analysis of events and a survey of tendencies which is of
real value to the student of an appallingly complex problem.
Readers who can tolerate opinions which they are unlikely
to share (our author has a “minority mind” and is essen-
tially an internationalist and bourgeois-hater) are assured an
interesting adventure in too little known areas. I take from
the book a wholesome sense of the provincialism of such
unreflecting “Westernism” amongst us as comes of mere
geographical circumstance, and a realisation that every other
valley and hill of Transcaucasia is a pressing problem for
constructive statesmanship. Mr. PRICE dates his preface
May 1917. He had seen the first transports of the Revo-
lution and shared its ambitions and worthy hopes. It would
be interesting to know if he retains undiminished his faith
in the idealist-revolutionary solution of the war-problem
and his sense of the propaganda value in Germany of
Bolshevism in action.
Rotorua Rex (SKEFFINGTON) is truly enough described on
its cover as “a rattling good story of love and romance in
the South Seas.” When the tale opens the Commissioner
of Rotorua's island kingdom had just died, and no one was
left to uphold British prestige except the Commissioner's
daughter, her prim but determined aunt, and an old

sergeant. This was Rotorua's chance for what is vulgarly
called a “bust,” and, tremendous eater and drinker as he
was, he sincerely intended to take it. Unexpected events,
however, thwarted these plans, and, instead of feasting
until even his magnificent appetite was satisfied, he found
himself flying for all he was worth from traitorous subjects.
But he fought nobly as he fled, and he also showed con-
siderable tact in not too closely watching the companions
of his flight. For the prim aunt took part in this strategic
retreat, and the pace was so hot that she had to sacrifice a
considerable amount of clothing as she fled. Mr. ALLEN
DUNN's account of this flight is genuinely exciting and
amusing, and I can recommend his book to anyone in
search of breathless adventures.
“One train of seven hundred wounded arrived, after being
detained in a blizzard, with only eighty men alive.” Pages
of quotation could hardly surpass that one sentence for a
picture of the miseries endured by that most hardly used
mundane husband, Sandy, up North. So far from being
the child who would never grow up, she was a woman who
had never been young, as is acutely illustrated by the
extremely elderly poem she composed at the age of ten or
so ; one of those rhymeless trailing pieces, in which the
wind and the grass and the sheep and the road despair
together and hint almost directly at suicide as the only
solution of life. She grew no less dismal with advancing
years; for her (and LINDSAY RUSSELL) there was bitterness
in all existence outside Chelsea. I could find but one real
sorrow in her life, the death of her baby. I knew it was
going to happen, anyway, but was all the more sure of it
when I found her bathing it immediately after its breakfast.
Beit noted that the intended point of the book—the intense
irritation, for the lovers of abstract beauty and joy, found
in the concrete dourness of such people as the Mackinnons,
in such places as Paisley—is one capable of earning
sympathy, if it be made impartially, with a sense of pro-
portion, upon a broad and unbigoted view of the world.

yet again, the Bolshevik army crumbled to dust. The
country that long residence and close observation have so
endeared to the writer has been driven to a travesty of
peace that in no way detracts from the valour of her previous
resistance, but no more than the almost intolerable miseries
she has borne can such a peace quench her spirit. Several
chapters from the hand of QUEEN MARIE, the true angel of
her people, written in the very heart of the tragedy, are
included in a volume that would be unendurably sombre
but for the writer's expression of unshakable certainty that
at the last the position shall be more than restored. That the
Western nations of civilisation stand pledged to Roumania's
ideal of race-union by every holiest bond conceivable of
gratitude and justice only those who would sacrifice our
Eastern Allies to a German peace will deny; but Mrs. Gordon
deserves our thanks for stating the fact again with convic-
tion and eloquence.
Anything less like Peter Pan than Eltrym Mackinnon,
heroine of Earthware (CASSELL), it would be difficult to con-
ceive; but “Peter Pan" was she christened, late in life, by
the leading member of that (so-called) “tumultuous wave
of youth flowing towards the sea of dreams ” into which

But the attitude here is
narrow and extreme; it is
the bitter opposition of
the elect minority to the
senseless, contemptible
masses. It is expressed
in the sarcasm of a pub-
lisher, also one of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PRIVATE CUTHBERT.
AN intimacy extending over nearly
seven years leads me to the regrettable
conclusion than Joan Minor's faults
are many. Want of fidelity to her old
friends, however, is not among them,
and this is especially noticeable in her
relationship with her dolls. The sub-
ject of this story is a case in point.
During his early career he was known
to us as Gussie, later he became Gilbert
the Filbert, and finally, during the great
Cuthbert boom in the doll market, he
adopted the popular appellation. What-
ever his name, however, he retained
Joan Minor's unwavering devotion.
Other more orthodox Cuthberts, com-
plete with exemption badges and
attaché cases, retired battered and
dissipated wrecks to the ignominious
shelter of the ash-bucket and the rag-
bag. He seemed to have drunk the
elixir of perpetual youth. The same im-
maculate frock-coat and grey trousers,
the same white spats and patent leather
boots, the same sleek fair hair and
irritating simper. Save for the little
matter of the name, to which I have
referred, it seemed that the greatest
war in history was to leave him un-
affected. He disdained even the exemp-
tion badge of his discomfited rivals.
Yet the blow has fallen at last, the
more sure and effective for being so
long withheld.
Much as I admire Joan Minor's
official attitude in the matter, I cannot
acquit her of a certain personal respon-
sibility. Only a week ago I heard her
address the principal culprit in these
words: “You shan't have to be a
soldier, Cuthie darling, no matter iſ all
the others are gone to fight. You shall
stay at home to mind the babies.”
Even after the arrival of her cousin,
aged four, and his appointment to the
responsible position of regimental ser-
geant-major, Cuthbert enjoyed several
days of inglorious immunity. Ob-
viously, however, the vital interests of
the nation could not for ever be trifled
with. Yesterday he received his calling-
up papers, and Joan Minor laboured
all the morning to produce a suit of
regimentals to replace his modish but
obsolete civilian attire. Here again I
have a certain sympathy with Cuthbert.
I am not, I hope, a vain man, yet even
I should hesitate to appear in clothes
of such remarkable originality, and
Cuthbert, as I mentioned, has always
been the very pink of sartorial perfec-
tion.
It must have been about five o'clock
in the evening when I observed from
my study window Joan Minor settling
herself with an awful dignity upon the
seat in the summer-house. A pair of
my puttees, deplorably wound, trailed
from her legs, and a red opera-cloak of
her mother's was draped heavily about
her shoulders, allowing an occasional
glimpse of my best tunic beneath.
Aided by my recollection of the fact
that my daughter had once been present
at a case upon which I was engaged, I
was able to recognise a daring attempt
to combine the atmospheres of the
civil and military courts of justice.
Presently the Sergeant-Major appeared
from the laurel bush, which has been
commandeered as barracks for the
troops, dragging a limp and dejected-
looking Cuthbert in his train. He
came to a halt before his commanding
officer, saluted unconventionally and,
after an interval of embarrassed silence,
fell to sucking his thumb. Cuthbert
in the meantime revolved slowly, sus-
pended by one arm, and I noticed with
horror that he was in a state of nature.
“Well, Sergeant-Major,” said his
Colonel, “what is this man crimed
With ?”
“With refusin' ” The Sergeant-
Major paused doubtfully.
“With refusing to put on military
uniform and using "prompted the
O.C.
“An' usin' insultin' an' insuborginit
language in the execution of his duty
towards his sperior officer,” gabbled the
R.S.M., evidently fearful lest his care-
fully acquired part should again escape
him. Even I, securely hidden behind
the curtain, trembled at the frown which
gathered on the Colonel's brow.
“This is very serious, Sergeant-Major.
You say he insulted you. What did he
say?”
“He called me a horrid pig.”
“Indeed. And he refused to put on
his uniform 2 "
“He wouldn't put on his twowsies.”
There was a gleeful, almost a sympa-
thetic note in the R.S.M.'s voice, and
involuntarily my mind went back to the
evening when I had come upon him
still wet and rosy from his bath and,
attired like Cuthbert, hotly pursued
down the passage by a flushed and
scandalised Gwendolen. Gwendolen is
Joan Minor's nurse, and I have reason
to believe that it is from her various
admirers that Joan Minor gets her as-
tonishing acquaintance with military
terminology both official and otherwise.
“When I tried to put them on he
went like this.” The R.S.M. flung him-
self on his back and extended his legs
heavenwards in the form of a broad W.
I was conscious that he was merely
rehearsing a well-tried manoeuvre the
strategic value of which was immediately
apparent even to my inexpert eye.
Then, feeling that he had acquitted
himself of his part in the proceedings,
he made off in pursuit of a passing
butterfly, leaving Cuthbert where he
had fallen. - -
“Private Cuthbert,” said the O.C.
sternly, “you have heard, the evidence
of the Sergeant-Major. Have you any-
thing to say?" - - -
There was no reply. -
“Cuthie dear, won't you put on your
nice new clothes? If you put them on
now for me I won't punish you.”
Still the offender, prone upon the
grass, maintained a sullen silence.
“Very well, Private Cuthbert, if you
won't wear them you won't. But you
will be surprised to hear that you are
on guard to-night under the goose-
berry bush to keep away the slugs from
my peas just the same.” -
The sentence was carried out in all its
merciless severity. Joan Minor herself,
the Lucius Junius Brutus of her sex,
affixed the naked and defiant Cuthbert
to the stem of the gooseberry bush with
an odd length of raffia. ... A September
night under such conditions must, I
imagine, be exceedingly cold. -
This morning I observed Cuthbert
present on parade decently attired in
the uniform of his rank. . . . .
MICK.
I HAVE a friend, a perfect lunatic;
He wipes his feet upon me—feet all
thick
With viscid mud–to show he loves me
well,
And roars his greetings in a joyful yell,
“How glad you are to see me, aren't
you, dear?
Rejoice! Exult! you may—I'm really
here!” -
And I rejoice. The fool has points, you
see :
And chiefest is his blind belief in ME.
He looks upon me as a thing sublime,
A culminating long result of time.
And, though it may be folly on his part
(I say it may be), still it warms the
heart;
And when he fawns upon me with a
smile
As wide as that of any crocodile,
And wags ecstatically, I–so wise l—
Would fain be worth the worship of
his eyes.

THE WATCH DOGS.
LXXVI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, For my sins,
which must have been many and griev-
ous, I have just had to make a tour of
duty among the German colony in this
more peaceful part of Europe. I sup-
port the criticism of the old gentleman
who came with me and who also was
new to the sight. As he noted the
female element with his still youthful
eye he said, “If these be typical of
the women in Germany I can quite
understand the German men trying to
get into France.”
It has always been my experience,
in the judicial affairs of peace-time,
that one's case loses much, if not most,
of its virtue and rectitude when it
comes before the tribunal together with
the other fellow's version. Neutrality,
as represented by any Bench, has
always appeared to me to be a sense-
less thing, with no true perceptions,
no appreciation of righteousness when
confronted with it, no sympathy with
purity and perfection as explained to it
by myself in the quality of counsel.
Juries also, supposedly neutral, I have
found impervious to the burning justice
of my client's cause and too credulous
and attentive to the specious mendacity
of the other side. It was with some
anxiety, therefore, that I first mixed
with the people of one of the few neu-
tral States remaining at this time.
Apart from the fear of seeing on the
natives' faces that expression, so famil-
iar with the Common Jury, of indiffer-
ence to. the gross instance of justice
trampled under foot, I was afraid of a
general doubt as to whether our affairs
were progressing so nicely as we made
out... My experience has been most con-
soling; we have some very good friends
abroad, Charles. -
I pass over the indiscretions of porters
and ticket-collectors, who have so far
forgotten the obligations of neutrality
as to declare to me in public, “Vive
l'Angleterre / vive la France 1 vive
l'Italie / vivent les Etats Unis /" and
a similar wish for all other nations,
states and powers, which, from the
largest to the smallest, have associated
themselves with our cause; I confine
myself to the local Press, which, with
all respect to their Lordships at home,
is as well-conducted as any I have ever
read. -
There are two papers in particular
which I mean to take in for the rest
of my life, in gratitude for the comfort
I have derived from their convictions.
The one has all the reputation for
solemnity of our own leading journal.
Not infrequently it takes us to task for
our misconceptions and mistakes, and
tells us off for our faults of constitu-
tion or character; this done, it is in
a position rather to assume than to
say that of course we are right and as
such are going to prevail. Certain
developments of a few months back
on the Western Front it reviewed as
regrettable incidents inevitably produc-
ing tiresome results; addressing itself
to the more intelligent and educated,
it refrained from stating the obvious,
that these tiresome results were natur-
ally about to be rectified; it confined
itself to enumerating a few simple
reasons for accepting any delay there
might be in the rectification.
The other paper is a bright little
affair which says be blowed to the
Bosch about six times a day, but with
such happy variety of expression and
phrase as to do away with any sense
of iteration. I feel that even the Hun
himself, if he has any better sense of
journalism, must read it regularly,
though secretly, and, in spite of him-
self and his fatherland, enjoy the mere
vitality of it. To this paper there just
were no events on the Western Front
a few months back worth worrying
about. Facts and figures were duly
quoted in full, but only as leading up
to a thorough relishing of the good
things they were bringing to the Allies,
unity of command and a completely
developed determination to annihilate
utterly and for ever all Central Powers.
In those dark days our sporting and
irrepressible little friend, setting out
the whole news at length, washed away
the whole effects of it with some bright
and daring headlines, calculated to con-
vince anyone that this was all merely
preparing the stage for the real busi-
ness about to begin next week. It was
at this time that the humourist who
contributes the daily column of merri-
ment in italics on the right-hand side
of the front page reached his zenith with
a fanciful description of the KAISER,
now owner of the civilised world but
offering to exchange the lot for half-a-
loaf of bread.
From the whole of this Press two per-
sonalities stand out—Agence Havas and
Commentaire Wolff. Agence Havas I
put down as a cheerful, business-like
fellow, thirty-five to forty years old,
only son of an extremely happy mar-
riage. I see him, in an old tweed suit
and cap, with a pipe between his teeth,
always out and about with the fighting
soldiers of the Entente. Politics and
offices are no affair of his ; whatever
the directorates may think or say or do,
he takes his atmosphere from the trench
line, and the spirit of his records is
accordingly brisk and buoyant.
Commentaire Wolff I fancy is well
past his first and second youth, neither
of which was very happy. Born with
a grievance of some sort, which he has
always had to suppress, he has made
his way to the top of his tree by ruth-
less determination and undue influence.
The former has put him out of sym-
pathy with the best of humanity, and
his time has been so much spent at an
office desk that he has lost the fresh-air
habit. The latter has got him into the
inveterate custom of taking his cue from
above, and he is too used to writing up
what is given him officially to think of
going and having a look for himself.
When the times gave him something
really to rejoice about, he wasn't able
really to rejoice. I see him always in
his well-appointed office, with no notes
at all save the official communiqué; I
see him writing and re-writing and
re-re-writing his report for the Press,
preening himself on the choice of
epithets in the final edition, but in-
wardly cursing himself for not being
able to write up a good thing with half
the cheerfulness which Agence Havas
manages to extract from a bad one.
I foresee old Commentaire Wolff
retired from business in disgust, having
handed over to his anaemic son, who
can think of no better way of dealing
with the day's news than by dishing
up his father's past writings and apply-
ing them to the present, without caring
whether they fit the facts or not.

Now that the dramatic and tumul-

of the PRIME MINISTER has been repro-
duced for film purposes, the cinemato-
graph industry claims that there is no
incident in the life of any public char-
acter that need baffle its operators.
The direct result is that a number of
enthralling life-stories are on the stocks.
Renowned authors and journalists have
been commissioned to prepare the
“books” of these romances.
There is little doubt that crowds will
flock to see Harold; or, On and On,
the true story of the journalistic activi-
ties of Mr. HARold BEGBI.E. It is no
secret to those who believe it to be
true that Sir OLIVER Lodge has had
a hand in preparing this photo-play.
The story shows a large number of
interesting interiors of the actual houses
of the 'celebrities whom the hero has
interviewed, from that of the Bishop
of LoNDoN to that of the Costermonger
King of Camberwell, each containing
the eminent journalist and his note-
book. Occasionally a page from the
notebook itself will be flashed upon
the screen, ample time being allowed
for the spectators to spell out the noble
sentiments there written. It is said
(by the producers) that few will come
away with dry eyes from witnessing
this very moving picture.
But the “scream ” of the season will
be the film depicting Mr. ARTHUR N.
DAVIs, the vivacious American dentist,
extracting the teeth of the KAISER.
Picture-goers must exercise a little
patience, however, for up to the time
of writing there has been a singular
difficulty in persuading any competent
actor to volunteer for the rôle of the
Imperial patient. The producers are
sanguine enough to hope that, with
the assistance of Marshal Foch and
HAIG, the KAISER himself may be avail-
able before very long.
Admirers of Miss MARIE CoRELLI
should not evade The Sword-like Pen.
For this film has been engaged an
actress of natural modesty and ability
whose histrionic powers nevertheless
enable her to represent with a wonder-
ful simulation of truth the many stir-
ring episodes in a pictorial career.
Another life-story in preparation is
that of Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON. It will
be found that in this film one of the
most entertaining scenes will be of the
future littérateur on the playing-fields
of St. Paul's School, persistently kick-
ing the football towards the goal of his
own side. His reasons for so doing—
and they are wonderfully convincing
—will be made clear to the audience
between the pictures. By an ingenious
adaptation this life-story can be shown
on a sheet of ordinary size.

Joan looked up again from the
elegantly-decorated pages of a Bond
Street catalogue.
She is a person who combines a
rather matter-of-fact temperament with
an attractively wistful manner; she also
has wide blue eyes and an appearance
of youthfulness so convincing that one
finds it quite difficult to associate her
with the multifarious responsibilities
of a large country-house, to say no-
thing of a four-years-old Pamela in the
nursery.
“Tell me what it was like,” she said;
“this house is so old ; it is full of
noises.”
“What it was like?” I repeated.
“Well, it's not very easy to describe.
It was like starlings in the early morn-
ing, and like fountains playing in the
sun, and like those tiny white clouds
when the sky is very blue.”
“Clouds don't make a noise,” said
Joan; “at least, not the tiny ones.”
“And like cowbells far away on the
mountain-slopes,” I continued, “and
like very, very good French chocolate,
and wild-rose buds.” -
“Well, of all the extraordinary mix-
tures,” said Joan; “I'd like to know
what next.” - -
“And like snow scrunching under
your 'shoes,” I went on, becoming
more and more fascinated by the possi-
bilities of my subject, “and like sweet-
peas and—” I hesitated for a mo-
ment, and my host, who had finished
his breakfast some time ago and had
apparently been deeply absorbed in his
paper, suddenly chimed in
"And like water round the prow of a
boat,” he said, “and the smell of a
wood-fire and apples and good leather,
and like little bits of HERRICK, and old
French dancing tunes, and "-heglanced
across at his wife—“blue ribbons.”
I looked at Joan; she didn't appear
to be wearing any blue ribbons, but she
smiled a little self-consciously.
“I think you're both very silly,” she
said; “and Dickie doesn't even know
what you're talking about.”
A dark form crossed the window.
“Hullo, there's Jordan,” said Dickie.
“You'll excuse me, won't you? I want
to tell him about those new rose-
trees.” -
He walked across to the door, feeling
in his pocket for his tobacco-pouch as
he went, and presently we heard the
slight clatter of the sticks as he drew
one from the hall-stand.
“It's perfectly ridiculous the way
Dickie fusses over that rose-garden,”
said Joan. “How does he think we
manage when he is in France?”
There was a moment's pause.
Then suddenly—“There it is again,”
I said. “Didn't you hear it?”
Joan listened.
“That,” she said, gazing at me
with astonished half-incredulous eyes,
“why, that's Pamela laughing.”

THE FAMILY.
IT was pouring hard and the dining-
room was dark and cold.
“Only September,” remarked the
daughter bitterly, and snapped on the
electric light.
They were mostly late that morning,
but finally collected round the table.
Five persons, the father, the mother,
the uncle, the aunt and the daughter.
The father, opening letters, broke
the hungry silence. “How much coal
do you think we're allowed 2 ” he
asked.
The uncle settled comfortably to his
porridge; his coal allowance wasn't in
ret.
y The mother eyed the father, kettle in
hand. “I knew we shouldn't get all
that coal,” she said decidedly, “I knew
they'd never allow it. If they'd I-
sent what you put in that paper

The kettle clicked into its
place and the father prepared
his defence. “I never said ſ/

“I never did,” retorted the
father.
Here the daughter remarked
with acerbity, “A nice family
we shall be when it really is
cold.”
The mother placed her heavy guns.
“Well, suppose you tell us how much
coal we are allowed,” she suggested.
The father shot off a tonnage so
minute as to silence effectually any
argument.
It was then that one discovered that
the aunt had been speaking for several
minutes. She was repeating some-
thing to herself in a low tone. It
might have been the Catechism. “What
we must do,” she murmured, “is to
light the study fire and put out the
kitchen aſter lunch. No more gas fires
to dress by ; and we must wear warm
clothes. It doesn't matter if you wear
warm clothes, but we shan't be able to
have all the fires we've had. I never
have had a fire in my bedroom, except
when I was ill. And then under protest,”
she added and bent over her bread-and-
marmalade.
The daughter set her cup down de-

marked. “We must bring the servants

Then the aunt murmured to herself,
“How they would hate it!”
The uncle was a democrat, but he
she's right,” referring to the daughter,
the aunt had said that they would
hate it.
The mother took an edging of butter.
“I shall begin economy from to-day,”
she announced. “Elizabeth must do
with one scuttle instead of three.” She
glanced scornfully round the table.
“It’s well enough for you all to have
your little ideas,” she remarked, “I
shall have the dealing with it.”

and did so, and the tablecloth became
a shade paler.

mother, “and besides I already have a

The aunt took a piece of bread.
“Yes, I suppose so,” she said, and
added, “if you can read a gas-meter. I
never could. I suppose they count the
heating and lighting in one.”
The uncle cleared his throat authori-
tatively, “I wish you would try and get
it into your head, my dear,” he ob-
served, “that they are not counted as

And the father and the uncle, warmed

Meanwhile, in the garden, the rain
had stopped, and suddenly the lawns
were bright. The sun had stepped out
and flooded the morning.
“Well—if the sun will shine,” mur-
mured the father to himself; and the
whole party rose and went into the
garden.

listened with unabated attention to
Professor Theophilus Linkhorn, whose
latest discoveries have shed so much
light on the Dickens-Gladstone con-
troversy. “For many years,” he said,
“students of DICKENs had felt that the
famous novels could not have sprung
from the mind of the humble, unedu-
cated employee of a blacking factory,
but the question was, Who did write
them 2 Then came the President of
Bryan University with his theory of
Gladstonian authorship. GLADstone,
he was able to show, was a contem-
porary of Dicki:Ns, who flourished in
the reign of QUEEN VICTORIA, some
years before the world war which re-
sulted in the obliteration of Germany.
He was a statesman, a scholar and a
his efforts. -
“It was a fascinating theory,” con-
| tinued Professor Linkhorn, “but some-
thing more than speculation seemed to
be required. This was supplied most
fortunately by the original research
undertaken recently by the faculty of
the Charles Chaplin Literary Institute,
founded by the celebrated twentieth-
century actor and savant who be-
queathed an immense fund for historico-
literary investigation. Thus we have
the solution of the mysterious “Murd-
stone letter' written to CHAPMAN AND
HALL, the publishers, concerning the
use of the name for one of the charac-
ters in David Copperfield. This letter
had been carefully preserved in the
St. Andrew Carnegie Library. GLAD-
sTone's first intention, evidently, had
been to call this character “Mirthstone,’
or gladstone, but his publishers objected
to the device as too transparent, and
so we find him replying in these words:
“Very well; then Murdstone let it
be.’ But the most ingenious device
of GLADSTONE's, perhaps, was his use
of his initials in the case of ‘the lite-
rary man with a wooden leg,' Silas
Wegg. Here boldly we have the initials
in full in their regular order, W.E.G.,
with an extra G for good measure.”
The Professor then alluded to the
subject of the Ivy Green cipher, which
he had the honour of discovering in the
Pickwick Papers. “Scholars had long
been puzzled by the insertion of a
poem of three stanzas in this book.
The ostensible excuse for its introduc-
tion was its recitation at an evening
party at Manor Farm, Dingley Dell, by
the aged clergyman of the place, name
not given, who posed as its author.
But the poem has no connection with
the story. Why, then, students formerly
wondered, was it interpolated in this
first long story of DICKENs 2 " By way
of answer Professor Linkhorn wrote
the first five lines on the blackboard :
“Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,
That creepeth o'er ruins old !
Of right choice food are his meals Iween,
In his cell so lone and cold.
The wall must be crumbled, the stone
decayed . . .”
The Professor then requested his audi-
tors to take their pencils and write
down the first letter of the first line's
last word, the second letter of the
second line's last word, the third letter
of the third line's third word from the
last (a not uncommon variant in ciphers
of this character), and the fourth letter
of the fourth line's last word. These
four letters spell “ Glad.” Then he in-
vited his hearers to glance along the
next line for the word to form the
second syllable of a proper name. The
next to the last word is “stone.”
The noise from the electric applause
machine, operated by thought waves
from the audience, demonstrated virtu-
ally unanimous acceptance of the
Professor's theory, and not a few per-
sons resolved to perform a tardy act of
justice by having their editions of
DICKENs rebound and the name of
GLADSTONE substituted as author in
letters of gold.

BUNNY'S BURDEN.
HARVEST, 1918.
Of all the rude rustic's detestable habits
There is none that I know more deserving of scorn
Than his barbarous custom of chasing us rabbits
Who hide in that last little strip of the corn.
Ah! many's the mix-up and many the mêlée
In which I have played an invidious part,
With farmer and ploughman and sheaf and shillelagh
All adding a beat to the beat of my heart:
Though in those days, I own, with a soupçon of cunning
And a flavour of luck one might often get clear,
For a farmer's a fool to a rabbit at running,
And a ploughman's as slow as a barrel of beer. .
But to-day we must face a more ominous question
In solving the problem of how to get out,
For the whole harvest field is a seething congestion
Of brains academic and tricks of the scout.
All the talent is here—all the great and the lesser,
The proud and the humble, the stout and the slim,
The Second Form boy and the agéd professor,
Grade Three and the hero in want of a limb.
From all sides they gather, the saint and the sinner,
The child from his cradle, the grandfather grey,
And none but would gladly have rabbit for dinner,
That is, if it happened to fall in his way. * -
And each new arrival has brought a new terror;
You move, and a constable holds up his hand;
Those boys out of school, they can run, and no error,
And who has an eye like the girl on the land 2
The art of pursuit is reduced to a science
When coolness and culture combine to pursue;
Schoolmaster and scout in unholy alliance
Are banded to beat us—so what can we do?
Instead of dull yokels with crossings and wrangles
And ruminant rustics on faltering feet, .
We've mathematicians appraising the angles
And telling where runner and rabbit should meet.
With a staff so adroit and an army so thorough
I fear we are fighting a losing campaign, .
Believe me if ever I get to my burrow
There's nought will induce me to leave it again.

“But when one reflects that the bride does not number 19 summers

a son to boot she may escape kicking.
A COCOA MYSTERY.
“AT five minutes to eleven,” said Lisbeth dramatically, .
“I put Sister's cup of cocoa on that table and went back to
the kitchen to get her a couple of biscuits. I returned at
two minutes to the hour to find the cup empty. Who stole
Sister's cocoa 2 " . .
News of the theft spread through our W.A.D. hospital
rapidly, for hitherto Sister's eleven-o'clock cocoa had been
sacred. The staff pleaded not guilty, and Lisbeth, who is a
major or something similarly gigantic in the Girl Guides,
announced her intention of discovering the culprit no
matter what the cost in time, and as Lisbeth has three
badges for Observation, Penetration and Perseverance, we
admitted that she must be our Sherlock Holmes whilst we
acted as her Watsons.
“If the staff is innocent then it is obvious that the thief
is one of the patients,” she said, rolling her eyes in order to
impress upon her audience the fact that she was thinking
deeply. “I will make inquiries amongst the men.”
Who stole Sister's cocoa 2 Lisbeth's slogan echoed
through the hospital until we began to repeat it ourselves
mechanically. As I had to do the detective's hospital work
as well as my own I was anxious for her speedy triumph,
but it was only five minutes before we were due to stop
work for the day that Lisbeth, bubbling over with excite-
ment, whispered to me that the stout little man whose bed
was nearest the door was the thief. -
“I'm sure there's a cocoa stain on his sleeve,” she said;
“I want you to come with me when I denounce him to his
face. He only arrived this morning and we must be firm.”
The suspect was sitting alone in the somewhat attenuated
conservatory when Lisbeth and I entered, and he rose to his
feet uneasily when he saw us. Emboldened by his con-
fusion Lisbeth came to the point with embarrassing prompt-
ness and candour. -
“I believe you stole Sister's cocoa,” she said severely.
He looked down at his boots and then up at us.
“Well, wot if I did 2" he asked defiantly.
shouldn't have left it where'd I'd be sure to see it.”
“But you get plenty to eat and drink,” said Lisbeth,
“ and - 1 -
“Drink?” he said scornfully, “D'ye mean that you think
I'd drink cocoa?” ... His face became purple. “I hate cocoa
—I've hated it all my life. The sight of it drives me
crazy. It was bad enough afore I joined the army, but
since then ” He pressed his hands to his face and
groaned. “When I see a cup of cocoa I lose me head. I
want to dance on it with both feet.”
“But why?"
“Haven't I got the best of reasons?” he cried, and I
really thought his wounds must have affected his head.
“You don't know what I've suffered through cocoa. Wot
with chaps tryin' to borrow money and callin' me stingy
when I 'adn't the price of a fag for meself; wot with
cheap jokes and invitations to temperance meetin's, I tell
ye, Miss, the moment I comes upon that cup of cocoa I
empties it out of the window. I would have sent the cup
and saucer after it but I felt that they hadn't done me no
harm.”
“I’m sorry, but I must report you,” said Lisbeth magis-
terially. “It is a very serious offence to tamper with
Sister's cocoa. What is your name 2"
The culprit's eyes blazed defiance.
“Cadbury, Miss,” he answered.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. JEFFERY FARNoL still treads the broad highway of
popular success. It has now brought him inevitably to the
pleasant domain of costume-comedy, where dwells, amid
every circumstance of the aptly picturesque, that type and
pattern of all such heroines, Our Admirable Betty (SAMPsoN
Low). Really, I rather wonder if I need give you any
more of her story than its title. We find the fair dame in
act to rejuvenate by flirtation one Major John D'Arcy, her
neighbour, a retired soldier, who, having renounced the sex
in favour of literary composition, very naturally finds the
leading lady looking over his garden wall in the second
chapter. Shall I add that, for purposes of broad-comedy
relief, the Major has a soldier servant, so that while the
master is courting in the parlour . . . 2 Mr. FARNOL has
even been so complete as to endow his heroine with a
fugitive brother, of striking family resemblance to herself,
who (fulfilling thereby his almost painfully obvious duty)
first embraces his sister in such clandestine style as to
persuade the eavesdropping hero that he is supplanted,
and then, falling back upon the family likeness—but no, I
refuse to imagine that there exists any reader so dull as not
to have anticipated the purpose of that. You will by now
have gathered that the admirability of Betty urges her no-
where beyond the confines of the expected; but since this
was (I suppose) her author's intention I have only to
felicitate him upon a heroine whose profoundly trustworthy
character should, and doubtless will, endear her to a
thousand libraries. -
Mr. Stanley G. Fulton is an American millionaire.
He is sick and tired of his money and appears to have
exhausted all the usual methods of spending it. Moreover
he is fifty-two years old and a bachelor and does not know
to whom he can leave his riches, having only three rela-
tions (cousins) in the world, and knowing nothing of them
beyond the mere fact of their existence in the township of
Hillerton. The matter presses, for the millionaire's diges-
tion is so far gone that he is reduced to one dietetic biscuit
a day. . What is he to do? Happy thought ! He will
arrange to convey to each of the cousins one hundred
thousand dollars and will himself go and live at Hillerton
in disguise—beard, blue spectacles and name of John Smith
—in order to watch how the cousins behave when the
golden shower descends upon them. His ostensible reason
for being in Hillerton is the compilation of a history of the
Blaisdell family, to which the millionaire and the cousins
belong. Mr. Fulton himself disappears into the South
American jungle, and in due time the money gets to work.
This is the scheme of Oh, Money / Money ! (CoNSTABLE),
and in working it out ELEANor H. Porter shows consider-
able skill in placing her characters and a nice sense of fun.
Indeed she creates quite a DICKENs atmosphere, and in
particular introduces her readers to Poor Maggie, who has
to devote herself to an extraordinarily disagreeable father.
In fact she is an American replica of Little Dorrit. Even-
tually Poor Maggie, though she is no relative of the Blais-
dells, wins the gros lot, the millionaire himself. I can
truthfully add that this story is thoroughly wholesome and
ingenuous, and in saying this my strong intention is not to
depreciate but to praise.
It would be interesting to know at what date in the
world's history the comedy of mistaken identity first made
its appearance. Probably, I fancy, as soon as there were
sufficient inhabitants to provide two confusably alike. And

as the same old situation has ever since been pursuing its
triumphant course down the ages, my respect is the greater
for Mr. H. DE WERE STACPoolE, who has shown how fresh
and entertaining a plot it can furnish even now in artistic
hands. Briefly, I hail The Man Who Lost Himself (HUTCHIN-
son) as one of the best resemblance-books I have met, I
know exactly what I personally want in a tale of this kind.
A poor but ingenious hero (Mr. STAgPoole gives me an
American stranded at the Savoy Hotel with an unpayable
bill) mistaken for a twin image of small ability but un-
limited wealth and social prestige (here we get an Earl;
good enough, perhaps; though I should have preferred
Royalty, if Zenda had not, I suppose, rendered this im-
possible). Anyhow, what I most admired about the present
version was its air of convincing logic, even now and then
its dash of serious psychology, which lifted the whole thing
so high that it became almost credible. Perhaps Mr.
STAGPooDE's hero succeeds a shade too easily; but his
triumphs, in reversing the follies of the man whose place
he has taken, are excellent fun. As you know, however,
there are always two .
great tests for this par- 4%
ticular intrigue—what º
to do with the heroine, ºf º
and how to end it.
Without spoiling your
enjoyment by any pre-
mature revelation I can
assure you that it is
precisely in his treat-
ment of these two pro-
blems that Mr. STAC-
PoolE has consolidated
a very notable success.
The Remembered Kiss
(HopDER AND STough-
Ton), by RUBy AYREs,
is the feuilletonic his-
tory of Lorna Peterson,
a sentimental little idiot
(I may have got this
wrong) who meets her
Patrick (a very hand- ºft.
some spendthrift Irish "" " ' " ". -
gentleman and something of a Sinn Feiner in the matter of
love) in her aunt's house during a thunderstorm. He came in
the Raffles manner, but less well dressed and more furtively,
to steal her aunt's diamonds. He remained to steal only a
kiss from Lorna. This I think was the remembered kiss.
There were others. For Lorna's aunt made a will whereby
she was to have half a fortune if she married a certain Mr.
Loughland, and he the other half. Naturally, Mr. Loughland
turned out to be the amateur burglar, and naturally he
didn't remember her or the kiss either, being a hasty kisser,
and naturally each assumed the other to be after the money
| in a marriage of great convenience. Lorna having un-
wittingly betrayed the secret of her heart under the influ-
ence of a blow on the head from some falling stage scenery,
Patrick falls really in love. And all is well until Lorna
discovers that she has made the unpardonable betrayal and
assumes that Patrick is play-acting, and behaves like a
perfect little cat. Do people in real life and love mind so
very much when they unwittingly betray the secrets of their
hearts? But then this doesn't pretend to be real life.
I’M A DRYAD.”
Some of our sailors still remember, it seems, the good old
days when the Captain of a man-of-war could have all the
ship's boys caned daily on general principles and was not
thought remarkable in wearing a black frock-coat in heavy
weather at sea. Admiral Sir CYPRIAN BRIDGE is one of
them—not that he ever did such things himself—and in
the earlier pages of Some Recollections (MURRAY) he has
brought together stories of the Navy sixty years ago that
make one expect at every turn to meet again our immortal
Midshipman Easy. Indeed who else can the unknown
officer have been who at a masked ball tied the devil's tail
to the bannisters with such dire results, or who taught an
Australian native his only English speech—“It’s wrong
to swear"—full in the face of an irate second mate? By
a most modest autobiographical thread Admiral BRIDGE
leads to later chapters full of the romance and glamour of
the Pacific. He claims to hold a record by reason of the
number of islands on which he has landed, and he has
seized every chance of new experience, from mountaineering
with Dr. CHALMERs to dancing—or did he only witness?—
a native corroboree. Through the whole book, disconnected
and unequal though it may be, there is a dash of the salt.—
perhaps it is the quiet tallness of some of the yarns that
does it—that makes it
# sure of a welcome from
* every boy, young or
# old, who would like to
be a sailor.
Mr. W. J.D.Awson, in
The Father of a Soldier
(LANE), lays his heart
upon the table, and to
dissect it is not alto-
gether a pleasant opera-
: tion. Quite frankly he
teks us how in 1914 he
fought vigorously to
persuade himself that
the War was no con-
cern of his sons. In
England such a fight
would have ended al-
most as soon as it be-
gan, but the Dawsons
were living in America,
and in those days
- | America was far from
war. Nevertheless Mr. DAwson knew that his was a
losing battle, and the value of this book lies largely in
the way in which he describes the change in his feelings
from opposition to acquiescence, and from acquiescence
to whole-hearted agreement. It was, in short, a just
war, and it was the duty of his sons to take part in it. It
is unnecessary to tell those who know Mr. DAwson's work
that both in style and psychology this confession (if so I
may call it) is blameless. Where I feel a little inclined to
fall foul of him is in publishing such an extremely intimate
book. But, at any rate, it is a fine tribute to his sons, and
especially to Mr. CoNINGSBY DAwson.

WILLIAM'S JUNIOR PARTNERS.
THE SULTAN OF TURKEY
(to FERDIE, who is on a visit from Vienna to his own capital).
I can Not say how pleased I am to think
That you will soon be once more in the pink.
Believe me, I was absolutely stunned
By the report that you were moribund.
What will the Holy Compact do, I said,
If one so brave should join the Mighty Dead?
How will Vienna bear the awful drought
If such a fount of joy should peter out?
But, when I heard that you were out of pain
And taking nourishment, I breathed again.
Allah revives the gaiety of nations,
For which accept, my true felicitations!
FERDIE.
I thank you. I am still among the quick,
But, as regards my soul, am deadly sick.
It is indeed a cruel blow of fate -
That lack of strength (I've lost a lot of weight)
Precludes my being on the spot to curb
The rude ambitions of the rampant Serb:
That, should the British foe extend the area
Of their intrusion into my Bulgaria,
I must regretfully curtail my visit—
Not very pleasant for a monarch, is it?
I curse the chance that will not let me wield
The sword of CAESAR on the stricken field,
And through my convalescent nose I neigh,
Like to a wounded war-horse, for the fray.
SULTAN.
You have my sympathy. I too would fain
Have done a tilt on Armageddon's plain,
And spurred my camel on to cut the cordon
That gives my men the jumps each side the Jordan;
But, as a Sultan, here I have to stick,
Being, by tradition, permanently “sick.”
Yet there are consolations for a crock
In seeing ENVER take this nasty knock–
ENVER, the loathed, who did the dirty deal
That put my Faithful under WILLIAM's heel.
FERDIE.
You shock me. Junior Partners can't afford
To speak so loosely of the All-High Lord.
Have you considered what he's like to say
About my troops and yours who run away?
SULTAN.
A fig for WILLIAM! We who run may read
How fast he also lately ran at need ;
May read between the Lines how hard he's pressed—
Siegfried and Wotan, Kriemhild and the rest,
The whole damned catalogue of WAGNER's Ring,
Waiting the final curtain's fall next Spring.
Don't let the Prussian Eagle scare you, FERd;
I laugh inside at that decrepit bird;
His tail is docked; his eye is waxing dim;
He can't think worse of me than I of him. O. S.

MISTAKES OF THE WAR.
Rapperley had been home but a fortnight before, and it
was with some surprise therefore that, as I moved along the
towpath, I became aware of his khaki-clad figure in its
accustomed place upon a fallen tree. The butt of his rod
rested upon the river-bank at his feet; his float lay peace-
fully upon the bosom of the stream; while Rapperley, gazing
contemplatively across the grey waters, pulled at an ancient
and very foul pipe. I sat myself beside him, for the risk of
frightening away a fish was inconsiderable, and awaited his
comments. I had not long to wait. -
“There's been a lot o' big mistakes in this war,” he said.
“There have,” said I.
“Big mistakes,” he repeated. “On both sides, mind you;
not only on our side. The Huns have made big mistakes
too. The War itself was their biggest one, of course. And,
second to that, this here frightfulness. If they hadn't been
frightful they'd like as not have won before now.” He
shook his head wisely. “These Pacifist blokes might have
succeeded in kidding the people that the Hun was a perfect
little gentleman, and we'd have had a peace—them to keep
Antwerp in exchange for returning all the German waiters
to us, or something o' that sort. 'Stead o' which,” he
laughed quietly, his eye on the float, “you wait, Fritzy,
old man; you shall have a peace all right, don't you worry.
“But we've made big mistakes, of course,” he resumed
after a minute. “Not so big as that, but big. If we
hadn't made one only yesterday I shouldn't be sitting here
at this very minute. You see, Sir, I went sick yesterday
morning with a slight indisposition. Pains in the inside;
sort o' cold. ‘M. and D,' says the Doctor—medicine and
duty; pops it down on his sheet, and out I goes. About
an hour afterwards, when my inside was feeling comfort-
abler and I was just wondering how I could get out of the
medicine, I was sent for to the Orderly Room.
“‘You’ve leave for three weeks, and here's your pass,'
says the Sergeant-Major.
“I didn't say a word; just looked at him stupid-like and
came over all of a perspiration. Then he turns round to
look at something and I sees the M.O.'s sheet lying on the
desk. The top name was that of a bloke what was just out
of hospital and was marked for three weeks' leave. Then
came my name, and I sees that my “M. and D.’ looked as
if it had slipped down the paper, and there was a bit of a
flourish which might have been took for a bracket joining
me in with the three weeks' leave.
“‘This is a very peculiar affair,' thinks I; and then
the Sergeant-Major says, “The train goes at 11.15,' and I
was outside and making for my quarters at the double.”
Rapperley took up his rod and had re-baited his hook
before he spoke again.
“As soon as we were in the train I sees clearly that I
must stay out my three weeks' pass. As I says to this
hospital bloke, ‘If I go back before my time it'll show up
the Sergeant-Major or the M.O. and get 'em into trouble.’”
“Yes,” I said. “But if you had pointed it out at
the time. . . .”
A slow smile spread itself over Rapperley's features.
“There's been some big mistakes made in this war, as
I was saying, Sir," he said; “but me pointing it out at the
time ain't one of them.”
“Some evil disposed person, recently, illegally entered the dwelling
house of Mr. during his absence and stole from thence One
Hundred Pounds sterling (which he had secreted in his bed-mattress)
and other articles of value. To date, the thief is unknown. What a
loss! He has our sympathy."—West African Paper.

THE ABSENT-MINDED OFFICER AND THE COWS THAT “EYES LEFTED.”
LETTERS OF A BOY SCOUT.
V.
DEAR UNCLE,--I wish you could
come here as I am at present under
a cloud with no pocket money. You
see the pater had seen in the paper
about rolling clay and coal dust into
balls about the size of a baby's head
and saving coal, which is silly because
baby's heads are all sizes. Our garden
is all clay which is good for roses, and
our coal is all dust, which the pater
says is good for the coal merchant.
So he asked if our petrol could come
round and do war work by making clay
and coal dust balls, and if we made
enough he would buy a second-hand
bugel for the petrol.
So Belfitt said we must take it on,
as his motto is “Get money for the
petrol honestly if you can but by work-
ing if you can't.” We made hundreds
of clay balls about the size of a fat
baby's head, and Belfitt was sitting on
the wall and saw an erand boy idoling
in wartime which made him so angry
that he threw three balls at him. And
the erand boy lost his temper and got
more idol boys and they threw stones
and in self-defense we had to use all
the clay balls. It was a great fight,
but the pater says it will take my
pocket money for two years to pay for
windows broken at present prices, be-
sides the top hat which belonged to an
old gentleman who saw the fight and
ran up saying “Is there not enough
blood-shed on the battlefield 2 ” and
misteriously got four clay balls on his
hat and used awful language like a
conshientious objector.
Belfitt has an idea about moberlising
us all in a hurry. One of us runs to all
our houses, rings the bell three times,
and without waiting for an answer
goes off. And last night Unwin's pater
met me in their garden and said that
he had been looking for bell runaways
for weeks, and without listening boxed
my ears which was an insult to Scout
uniform. Belfitt says that out of con-
sideration for Unwin's feelings he will
do nothing at present, but when the
invasion comes Unwin's pater will be
left to be massacreed. Only we don't
tell Unwin this because of family afec-
tion though he hasn't much for he said
to me “Our old man's a holy terror.”
I went back to school on Monda
but I cannot fix my mind on wor
because I am trubbled about pocket
money, not being able to give to hos-
pitals for wounded heros like yourself,
or missions. What would you do
under the circs? Belfitt says that you
ought to register you reply because
so many valuable letters get lost in
the post.
Belfitt says that the horrid shadow
of peace is storking over the land, but
I have not seen it myself. I hope not
for your sake for if the war goes on
and you got a wound in your other
leg it might shorten both the same
and keep you from getting lame.
Your loving Nephew, JIM.

In “Holborn "rural charm,
But nowhere smells the Spring so sweet
As down by “Stinking Farm.”

Her glance was like the dappled doe's;
She blushed with shy alarm,
As pink as any Rambler-rose
That climbs at “Stinking Farm.”
O maiden, if it be my fate
To win so great a boon,
At “Hell-fire Corner " I will wait
Beneath the silver moon;
I'll swear no maid but thee I know

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUD LARKS.
THE Bosch having lately done a re-
treat—“strategic retirement,” “tactical
adjustment,” “elastic evasion,” or what-
ever LUDENDoRFF is calling it this week
—in plain words the Bosch, having
gloriously trotted backwards off a cer-
tain slice of France, Albert Edward and
I found ourselves attached to a Corps
H.Q. operating in a wilderness of grass-
grown fields, ruined villages and smok-
ing châteaux.
One evening Albert Edward loitered
up to the hen-house I was occupying at
the time and chatted to me through the
wires as I shaved.
“Put up seventeen hares and ten
covey of partridges visiting outpost to-
day—take my advice and scrap that
moustache while you're about it, it
must be a heavy drain on your system—
and twenty hares and four covey riding
home. Do you find lathering the ears
improves their growth, or what?”
“The country is crawling with game,”
said I, ignoring his personalities, “and
here we are hanging º and soul to-
gether on bully and dog biscuit.”
“Exactly,” said Albert Edward, “and
in the meanwhile the festive lapin
breeds and breeds. Has it ever occurred
to you that, if something isn't done
soon, we'll have Australia's sad story
over again here in Picardy? Give the
rabbits a chance and in no time they'll
have eaten off all the crops in France.
Why, on the Burra I've seen 11.
“One moment,” said I; “if I listen
to your South Australian rabbit story
again you've got to listen to my South
African locust yarn; it's only fair.”
“Oh, shut up,” Albert Edward
growled; “can't you understand this
question is deadly serious 2"
“Best put the Tanks on to 'em then,”
I suggested; “they'd enjoy themselves,
and the Waterloo Cup wouldn't be in
it—Captain Monkey-Wrench's brindled
whippet, ‘Sardine Tin, 6 to 4; Major
Spanner's ‘Pig Iron,' 7 to 2; even
money the field.”
“Your humour is a trifle strained,”
said Albert Edward; “if you're not
careful you'll crack a joke at the ex-
pense of a tendon one of these days.”
“Look here,” said I, wiping the blood
off my safety-razor, “you're evidently
struggling to give expression to some
heavy brain wave; out with it.”
“What about a pack of harriers?”
said Albert Edward. “There must be
swarms of sportive tykes about, faithful
Fidos that have stuck to the dear old
homestead through thick and thin, also
refugee animals that follow the sweet-
scented infantry cookers. I've got my
old hunting-horn; you've got your old
crop; between the two we ought to be
able to mobilize 'em a bit and put the
wind up these darn hares. I'm going
to try anyway. I may say I look on it
as a duty.” -
“Looked on in that light it's a sacred
duty,” said I; “and—er—incidentally
we might reap a haunch of hare out of it
now and again, mightn't we?”
“Incidentally, yes,” said Albert Ed-
ward, “and a trifle of sport into the
bargain—incidentally.”
So we set about collecting a pack
there and then by offering our servants
five francs per likely dog and no ques-
tions asked. -
No questions were asked, but I have
a strong suspicion that our gentlemen
were up all night and that there were
dark deeds done in the dead of it, for
the very next evening my groom and
countryman presented us with a bill for
forty-five francs. . . . . . .
The dogs, he informed us, were
kennelled “in a little shmall place the
like of an ice-house'' at the northern
extremity of the château grounds, and
that “annyway a blind man himself
couldn't miss them wid the screechin'
an' hollerin' they are afther raisin' be
dint of the confinemint.”
I had an appointment with the
Q. Staff (to explain why I had indented
for sixty-four horse rations while only
possessing thirty-two horses, the excuse
that they all enjoyed very healthy ap-
petites apparently not sufficing), so
Albert Edward went forth to inspect
the pack alone. -
He came into Mess very late, looking
hot and dishevelled.
“My word, they've looted a blooming
menagerie,” he panted in my ear;
“still, couldn't expect to pick Pytchley
puppies off every bush, I suppose.”
“What have they got, actually 2” I |
inquired.
“Two couple of Belgian light-draught
dogs—you know, the kind they hitch
on to any load too heavy for a horse
— an asthmatic beagle, an anaemic
bloodhound, a domesticated wolf, an
unfrocked poodle, and a sort of drop-
sical pug.”
“What on earth is the pug for 2 " I
asked.
“Luck,” said Albert Edward. “Your
henchman says “them kind of little
dogs do be bringing ye luck,' and backs
it up with a very convincing yarn of
an uncle of his in Bally-something who
had a lucky dog—“as like this wan
here as two spits, except maybe for
the least little curliness of the tail'
—which provided complete immunity
from ghosts, witches' evil and ingrow-
ing toe-nails. I thought it cheap at
five francs.”
“But, good Lord, that lot 'll never
hunt hares,” I protested.
“Won't they 2” said Albert Edward
grimly. “With the only meal they'll
ever see prancing along in front of
them, and you and me prancing along
behind scourging 'em with scorpions,
I rather fancy they will. By the way,
I know you won't mind, but I've had
to shift your bed out under the chest-
nut-tree; it's really quite a good tree
as trees go.”
“But why can't I stop in my hen-
house?” I objected.
“Because I've just moved the pack
there,” said he.
“But why?” I went on. “What's
the matter with the ice-house ?”
“That's just it,” he hissed in my
ear; “it isn't an ice-house—never was;
it's the De Walcourt family vault.”
The next day being propitious, we
decided to hold our first meet that
evening, and issued a few invitations.
The Veterinary Bloke and the Field
Cashier promised to show up, likewise
the Padre, once the sacredness of our
cause had been explained to him.
At noon “stables.” Albert Edward re-
ported the pack in fine fettle. “Kicking
up a fearful din and look desperate
enough to hunt a holy angel,” said he.
“At five o'clock, me lad, Hark for-
rard | Tally-ho! and Oddsboddikins!”
However at 4.45 P.M., just as I was
mounting, he appeared in my lines
wearing slacks and a very downcast
expression. -
“Wash-out,” he growled; “they've
been fed and are now lying about,
blown up and dead to the world.”
“But who the devil fed them 2 ” I
thundered.
“They fed themselves,” said Albert
Edward. “They ate the blooming
lucky dog at half-past four.”
We therefore postponed the hunt
until the morrow; but cannibalism (so
cannibals assure me), once indulged in,
becomes as absorbing as morphia or
jig-saws, and at two-fifteen the next
aſternoon my groom reported the beagle
to have gone the way of the pug,
and the pack once more dead to the
world. -
There was nothing for it but to post-
pone the show yet again, and tie up
each hound separately as a precaution
against further orgies.
However it seemed to have become
a habit with them, for the moment
they were unleashed on the evening of
the third day they turned as one dog
upon the poodle.
I wiped the bloodhound's nose for
him with a deft swipe of my whip lash,
and Albert Edward's charger anchored
the domesticated wolf by treading
firmly on its tail, all of which served
to give the fugitive a few seconds' start;
and then a wave of mad dog dashed

between our horses' legs and was on
his trail screaming for gore.
The poodle heard the scream and
did not dally, but got him hence with
promptitude and agility. He streaked
across the orchard, leading by five
lengths; but the good going across the
park reduced his advantage. He dived
through the fence hard pressed and,
with the bloodhound's hot breath
singeing his tail feathers, leaped into
the back of a large farm-cart which
happened, providentially for him, to be
meandering down the broad highway.
In the shafts of the cart was a sleepy
fat Percheron mare. On the seat was
a ponderous farmeress, upholstered in
respectable black and crowned with a
bead bonnet. They were probably
making a sentimental excursion to the
ruins of their farm. I know not ; but
I do know that the fat mare was sud-
denly shocked out of a pleasant drowse
to find herself the centre of a frenzied
pack of wolves, bloodhounds and other
dog-hooligans, and, not liking the look
of things, promptly bolted.
Albert Edward and I dropped over
the low hedge to see the cart disappear-
ing down the road in a whirl of dust
pursued by our vociferous harriers.
The fat farmeress, her bonnet wob-
bling over one ear, was tugging man-
fully at the reins and howling to Saint
Lazarus of Artois to put on the brakes.
Over the tail-board protruded the head
of the poodle, yelping derision at his
baffled enemies.
People will tell you Percherons can-
not gallop; can't they 2 Believe me
that grey mare flitted like a startled
gazelle. At all events she was too good
for our pack, whom we came upon a
mile distant, lying on their backs in a
ditch, too exhausted to do anything
but put their tongues out at us, while
far away we could see a small cloud of
dust careering on towards the horizon.
“God help the Traffic Controlman
at the next corner,” Albert Edward
mused; “he'll never know what struck
him. Well, that was pretty cheery
while it lasted, what 2 To see that
purler the Padre took over the garden-
wall was alone worth the money.”

REJECTED ADDRESSES.
OF all the suggestions which have
been made from time to time by people
for the increase of the Revenue at the
expense of other people, not one would
have more far-reaching effects than the
proposed tax upon all houses which are
known by a name. At first sight this
may appear, especially to those whose
houses have always been known by a
number, a defensible, even a justifiable
imposition. But on further considera-
tion it will be realised that the scheme
is doomed to failure from the start, for
every owner of a house known by a
name will drop the name and substitute
a number at the first note of warning.
The case where No. 21, Gladstone
Road, has taken to itself the title “The
Polyanthuses,” to which No. 22 has
replied with “The Sanguinarias,” is
simple enough; they will revert to their
original numbers and soon forget their
short-lived glory. But other cases will
be more complex, and we may antici-
pate something like the following:—
H.M. the KING held an Investiture
at No. 1, Constitution Hill, this morn-
ing, afterwards proceeding by train to
No. 75A, The Hill, Windsor. We un-
derstand that the terminus from which
the Royal train started will in future
be known as No. 145, Praed Street, the
directors of the G.W.R. having decided
against paying the new tax.
The Post Office authorities state
that the building formerly known as
St. James's Palace will now be No. 66,
Pall Mall, and not 90, St. James's Street,
as originally stated.
The Duke of PontLAND is expected
to return to-morrow from Scotland to
No. 2, Welbeck Drive, Dukeries. (No. 1
is the lodge).
The Patagonian Ambassador is spend-
ing the week-end with Sir Norman and
Lady Bloodstone at their beautiful

tlebury, Beds.
Messrs. Giddier and Giddier will

handsome Tudor Mansion, No. 184,

Prosperous Irish Farmer. “AND what ABOUT THE WAR, YoUR RIVERENCE 2 Do YE THINK IT will Hould?"
THE HOME CODE.
I was talking with an American on
the subject of initials.
It is, by the way, very easy to talk with
Americans just now. You find your-
self sitting next to them in all kinds of
places, and probably they want to know
something about London, and you in-
form them, or misinform them, as the
case may be, and some kind of com-
panionship springs up.
I met one of these strangers at Stam-
ford Bridge not long ago—a tall grave
man in khaki— and he told me all
about baseball and its mysteries, looking
at me the while through great round
yellow spectacles with horn or tortoise-
shell rims. But for him I should have
been utterly perplexed ; but his deep
level tones gradually converted chaos
into order and I came away with some-
thing like admiration for the possi-
bilities of a game which until then I
had been inclined to suspect. Next
summer, when he has won the War,
he is going to Lord's with me, and I am
to embark upon the perilous enterprise
of trying to prove to him the merits of
cricket.
The funny thing about these Ameri-
cans is that they are not funny. They
don't make jokes or want jokes made
to them. They don't talk as they talk
in books. They don't say “waal”
or “stranger.” They never “guess.”
They display no excitement—not even
when you praise their amazing and
glorious writer, O. HENRY. Everything
is taken as matter of course. Whether
all Americans are like this, or only
those who are now with us, intent on
winning the War, I cannot say.
But to return to my other American,
who talked about initials. He began
by asking me what those mysterious
letters outside Claridge's mean: T.F.H.
I told him. Then—(oh, you don't know
either? They mean Taxi, Four-wheeler,
Hansom, and are illuminated according
to requirement)—then he wanted to
know what the word “Mice" after an
engineer's name meant, and I told him,
Member of the Institute of Civil En-
gineers; and “Ram” after a singer's—
Royal Academy of Music; and all kinds
of other combinations of initials which
had struck his eye in programmes,
newspapers and so forth, most of which
I could explicate.
And then he offered a poser of his
own, from the other side of the Atlantic.
“What,” he asked, “would you say
that M.I.K. and F.H.B. stand for 2 ”
I gave it up instantly, or even sooner.
“They're our home code,” he said,
“and I'll give you a little help by say-
ing that they're used only when we
have company—folks to dinner and
so on.”
But still I couldn't see any light.
“Well,” he continued, “when there's
a party going on and the supplies run
a bit short, mother whispers to the
others, or lets them know, so as the
visitors don't hear, the letters F.H.B.
That means “Family holds back,' and
we behave accordingly. But if a new
dish comes in and, while we’re all
wondering if we dare have a go at it,
she says, “M.I.K.’ we let ourselves
loose, because that means “More in
kitchen.'
“It's a great country !” I said.
He agreed with me.
“Dead Turks caught in the retreat tell of
the harassing effect of the guns near the
coast.”—Observer.
So dead men do tell tales after all.

THE CONVERTED EPICURE.
WHEN I recall the ancient days of quiet,
Of plenty and of unrestricted diet,
I think with shame of all the whole-
some food -
I blindly and fastidiously eschewed.
Viands that once I squeamishly ab-
horred
Now find acordial welcome at my board;
And vegetables, once condemned as
hateful, -- -
Now furnish me with many a well-
heaped plateful.
Schooled by adversity in broader views
No more I delicately pick and choose,
But gladly take with a submissive hand
All that is offered, whether fresh or
canned.
Lapped in luxurious sybaritic habits
Of old I used to draw the line at rabbits;
Against all kinds of pork I once rebelled,
And liver (help!) in high abhorrence
held.
Rabbits! O scarce but palatable bunny
You have become as sweet as heather
honey;
And pork, in almost any shape or guise,
Finds favour in my educated eyes.
Without the vestige of a qualm or
quiver -
I view the coming of a plate of liver;
With nerve unflinching on my fork I
spike it,
And what is more, I positively like it.
So in the humbler and the coarser fishes
I find material for salubrious dishes,
No longer out of prejudice refraining
From the gay mackerel, oily but sus-
taining.
No longer my reluctant palate feels
An ill-advised antipathy to eels,
Since DESBoRough's electrifying plea
From foolish delicacy set me free.
Again, I deemed it once a sacrilege
To see some homely vulgar sorts of
veg.— -
Parsnips and turnips, swedes and butter
beans—
Served as a substitute for nobler greens.
But this intolerance I have abjured,
Converted, though not absolutely cured;
The parsnip still I cordially detest,
But gladly “give it” as a stodger
“best.”
And anyhow it were a crying sin
To grouse, when we reflect upon Berlin,
Depicted in its grinding hunger-pangs
By him who drew or crowned the
KAISER's fangs.
American valour altereth not; it is
the law of the MEADEs and PERSHINGs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BEHIND THE SCENES.
WHEN I read in these columns the
other week of the tragic end of Romeo,
the Red Cross Flea, my thoughts went
back at once to Harold and William—
not the 1066 gentlemen, but two mem-
bers of a troupe of educated fleas with
whose proprietor and his good lady I
had the pleasure of an interview before
the War had become permanently
established. It was after watching
“The Miniature Thespians,” a talented
company including “Harold, the most
highly gifted and perfectly trained flea
in the world" (I quote the advertise-
ment), that I got into conversation
with Professor and Mrs. Hopper T
as they cleared away the stage
properties. -
Mrs. Hopper was a thin soul-
ful woman with yellow hair and
a hoarse voice; the Professor
was stout and volatile; now on
the heights, now in the depths.
His present air of dejection—
for he had dropped his mask of
animation as the audience
drifted away—I at first put down
to reaction after the show; but
the cause lay deeper. Harold,
the star flea, was out of the bill.
A fit of whimsies the Professor
would have thought little about
| (he was too familiar with the
| artistic temperament), but here
| was something more serious.
| Thé doctor had hinted at appen-
dicitis. -
Lacking Harold the show had
fallen short of the Professor's
| ideals, and even when his wife,
phrasing her remark, I thought,
rather happily, assured him that
the whole performance had
“gone off without a 'itch,” he
refused to be comforted.
“If anything happens to Har-
old,” said the Professor gloomily, “it
will be a calamity to the Stage. It will
be felt wherever dramatic genius is ap-
preciated.”
Mrs. Hopper somewhat deprecated
her husband's enthusiasm over Harold,
but admitted the latter's strong hold
over the public. Practically unknown
but a short year ago he had then, it
seems, “jumped into fame at a bound,”
his subsequent career proving an almost
unbroken succession of triumphs.
“He is one in a thousand—a million,”
said the Professor. “With Harold's
name in the bill we play to capacity,”
and narrowing his eyes he peered about
for the stage-coach. Suddenly a dark
thought crossed his mind.
“I hope there's been no foul play,”
he muttered. “William's mortal jealous
of Harold.”
“Some bad blood between them 2"
I asked. - -
“Only the best blood,” he replied
absently as he picked up the moated
castle. “Harold's all right, but the
rank and file—they need very careful
handling. Tact? You want tons of it in
the profession. How ARTHUR Collins
and DE Courvili.E and these people
keep their reason I don't know.”
“Well,” said Mrs. Hopper, “I knew
when you put 'Arold on the box and
William between the shafts there'd be
unpleasantness.”
“We could hardly have reversed the
rôles,” said the Professor. “Harold
pulling the coach—impossible!
“A super could have pulled the
coach.”
“I don't know. It wants strength
and William 's very strong. All muscle
and no brains.”
He turned to me with sudden elation.
“You ought to see Harold drive,” he
said; “he handles the ribbons superbly,
he does indeed. Upon my soul, it
calls to mind the old coaching days.”
“You’re lost in 'Arold,” said Mrs.
Hopper.
“He’s the draw, my dear, and you
know it,” and, polishing his magnifier,

“Harold has the technique of the stage

He drummed the table despondently,

Harold's genius flashed before his mind.
What's that “He’s had some tempting offers for

the films,” he said. “I may release
him for a picture or two some day; he
would be at home on the sheet—on

“Good in comedy?” I asked.
“Oh, fine—fine! Tickles the people
immensely.” He looked anxiously at
his watch. “I’m expecting the doctor's
diagnosis any time now,” he went on.
“He took Harold away with him. I
didn't go. I should only have worked
myself into a state and possibly upset
the patient.”
I was sorry to leave before news of
the distinguished invalid arrived, but,
shaking hands with Professor and Mrs.
Hopper, I expressed my sincere hope
that the stage would not be deprived
of such an ornament. At the door a
breathless messenger hastened past me
to the Professor's side. I turned and
watched anxiously the effect of his re-
port. The Professor was transfigured
with joy. -
“It's all right! It's all right !” he
called after me. “Not appendicitis at

I went away distinctly cheered by
the news, but ?. not help wonder-

THE OUTLAW.
WHEN the first warship wakened to feel the life-blood stir,
The seas, of age-long wisdom, laid this command on her
And on her kind for ever: “Be whatsoe'er her might,
A ship shall fight with others as she would have them
fight;
And, guarding thus our honour, when the stern fight is
past
That brings her to the haven which all must make at last,
We pledge her way and welcome when she comes her soul
to yield,
And foes shall meet in friendship and all their wounds be
healed.”
So year by year thereafter, from battle, storm and shoal,
Safe to the promised haven the sea sent in her toll,
Aged and worn with service, gallant in youth and fame,
But all with names untarnished—and last a U-boat came.
But the tides that sweep the fairway to speed them or
dela
Demand łor each a sponsor to prove her right of way;
So she waited without in anger and peered through the
golden mists
At the taper masts uprising from the old sea-duellists.
And the message came to the Regent that lies by the
Cordelière, -
“Does any speak for a U-boat to prove that the fight was
fair 2''
But they spoke of an old-time conflict, from a fight off
Brest they came,
When the battle stayed in wonder as the two went up in
flame;
And since they fought with honour, as each was a knightly
foe, - -
So came they home together four hundred years ago.
And the waters paused for answer, listening North and
South,
But no one spoke for the U-boat that lay at the harbour
mouth.
And the call sped up the haven, borne in on the flowing tide,
Till the echo reached the Vengeur that is moored at the
Brunswick's side,
For so they had fought together with never an inch
between—
“Does any speak for a U-boat to show that her hands are
clean 2'' -
But they spoke of a fight from morning hard fought till
afternoon
With tattered flags, but stainless, on a bygone First of June.
And the tide swept on in silence to the creek where the
frigates are,
For no one spoke for the U-boat that lay at the harbour bar.
And the challenge came to the inlet where the Bonhomme
Richard waits
At peace with the old Serapis that she fought for the new-
born States,
When the captains called the boarders and the decks were
red and swept—
"Dº any speak for a U-boat to say that the Law was
ept 2"
But they spoke of nought but freedom, and, speaking, told
the tide
The story of their colours that floated side by side,
And º herald tide was answered, slackened and turned
about
To carry word to the U-boat that lay unseen without.
And the ebb stream came to the offing, crying, “My task is
done ;
There is no way or welcome;” and bare her forth alone
Far and away to seaward, no gleam of hope ahead,
Doomed to sail as an outlaw till the sea gives up her dead;
To make no light or landfall, with never a sail in sight,
Where the days but dawn to darken as the days she turned
to night,
And never a sound to silence the cry that haunts her there,
“Does any speak for a U-boat to prove that the fight was
fair 2''

I HAD supposed that I was dozing in my favourite arm-
chair in the library at home, but I think I must have been
mistaken. At any rate there I was, standing in a square
of houses, eight of them all told, and each of them lit with
a great light. Outside of these houses, but within the
radiance of the light, stood some who appeared to be
priests and priestesses of a cult which was, I thought, so
old as to be almost new again. And each one was intoning
words which sounded clear to me as I listened with ears
intent to catch their meaning. “Here," they said, “is
noblo work for all who care to join us. Merchandise we
buy and deal with according to the needs of brave and
gallant men. Our wares are a tribute of gratitude to the
glory that has spent itself on our behalf, and the heroism
that has accomplished its task and now lies stricken and
waiting to be succoured. Good wages too we give in pay-
ment, for they who work here shall take from us a slice of
their own forgotten youth as payment for their help.”
“These be strange words,” I said to one who stood at
my side, “and easy in the saying. Yet how can man or
woman receive back what has perished and gone?”
“Ay,” he answered me, “it does sound strange, but it is
true all the same. Those who spend their time and labour
with us take no payment in coin of the realm, but are made
happier, and so younger, by the tasks they achieve.”
“Can I enter in,” I asked, “and see what is going for-
ward within these eight houses?" -
“Enterin,” he said, “and be rightwelcome, and you will see
how suffering can be alleviated and wounds made bearable.”
And so I entered, or thought I entere i, for at that mo-
ment a gong gave a brazen sound, and I found myself back
in the armchair in which I started. -

Now I don't want my readers to be under any misappre-
hension. This is frankly an appeal on behalf of the
Kensington War Hospital Supply Depôt, which is, fortu-
nately, a solid fact, but which suffers, like many another
association, from a desire to enlarge its usefulness, and for
that purpose to increase the funds at its disposal. This
work is so good that merely to state it is, I am sure, to
open purses and to draw pens to cheque-books. In one
or other of its numerous departments it manufactures
surgical appliances of all sorts, such as splints, crutches,
bandages and hundreds of other things of the same nature.
The appeals for help from hospitals in France, Belgium,
Italy, East Africa, Mesopotamia, Roumania, Greece, and
from homes for the wounded in this country, are constant
and urgent, and in order to comply with even the most
pressing requests money is urgently needed.
Readers of Punch, I am sure, would not willingly suffer
any diminution in these splendid efforts. All are cordially
invited to see the work for themselves, and the Secretary of
the K.W.H.S.D., whose address is at Kensington Square, W.,
will gladly furnish all information to those who may ask
for it. You are invited to give twice by giving quickly. Thus
you too will earn a slice of youth. - R. C. L.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF from its title you have supposed that Joan and Peter
(CASSELL) would restore to you Mr. H. G. WELLs, the
incomparable tale-teller, rather than the pedagogue of recent
years, you may experience some disappointment to find
him again in cap and gown, with, moreover, a very service-
able cane for use on any occasion that appears to call for it.
In other words, Joan and Peter is one more example of the
romance hortatory which Mr. WELLs has chosen as the
medium for impressing his philosophy upon a world that
must still be cajoled with some pretence of a story. His
theme this time is education, as illustrated by the diverse
and experimental upbringing of two young people during
the last one-and-twenty years. At first, indeed, I fancied
that the mere human interest of Joan and Peter, as
engagingly real children, and the fun of laughing at their
º in one case farcical) aunts, were going to cause
Mr. WELLs to forget his mission. These were the chapters
of the christening, when Joan, confusing the ceremony
with the fate of certain kittens, loudly proclaimed her
wish to be “kep';" and of the abduction. Later however
Mr. WELLs got talking . . . and to this extent tended to
neglect my roused interest in his protagonists. Still he
contrives to give, as it were incidentally, some admirable
pictures of English social life from the Diamond Jubilee to
the Match Famine. And once, towards the end, the story
recovers itself with a love-scene that is as direct and vital
as anything Mr. WELLs, or indeed anyone else, has written
in this kind. Certainly Joan and Peter, didactic, emotional,
sentimental (below the surface) and occasionally inspired
by too obvious an avoidance of the trammels of good taste,
remains a book that must be read.
The Village Wife's Lament (SECKER), by Mr. MAURICE
HEwleTT, is impressive rather for its theme than for any
particular power or beauty in the telling. The plan of it is
simple, a story of country love and happiness ruined by the
world tragedy; the passionate question with which so
many thousands of bewildered minds have been tormented:
Why should these things be? Mr. HEwl.HTT seems dis-
turbed by a fear lest he shall be thought to have put ideas
into the mouth of his peasant for which she could never
actually have found expression. In a rather superfluous
note he defends himself from this suggestion. “If I know
anything of village people I know that they shape their
lives according to Nature, and are outraged to the root of
their being by the frustration of Nature's laws.” The justi-
fication was hardly needed. No one objects to the heroine
of a poem thinking and talking poetry—so long as it is
good. There are passages of dignity and rhythmic charm
in the Lament, but there are also not a few that strike me
as monstrously unworthy. “Where you see nil," for
example, is a line that surely no poet should have given
either to a village wife or anyone else. I would have rather
found Mr. HEwlFTT apologizing for such lapses than for
excess of thought in a work whose manner falls here
considerably below the demands of the matter and of his
own art.

If you want to get at once at the heart of certain reminis-
cences of the trenches, entitled Private Peat (HUTCHINSoN),
I give you page 156, line 27 and on: “We had seen atro-
cities on the Belgians the day before. We had seen young
girls who were mutilated and horribly maltreated. We had
been gassed. We had seen our comrades die in awful
horror. We had seen our sergeants crucified and we were
outnumbered ten to one. . We remained the victors
of Ypres. Canadians—Canadians—that's all!”. Yes, I
suppose that is what they were and are—Canadians, just
that and nothing more. But that's good enough. I
remember standing at the time referred to in another
trench, a mile or two to the right of them, observing at
night the curious, even picturesque reflection in the sky,
and trusting that this sort of thing gave pleasure to those
who were in the midst of it. And, indeed, it appears to
have done if Mr. HARold R. PEAT is anything to go by.
You might suppose, on reading his modest account of it,
that it was a rare privilege and a barely deserved pleasure
to go through hell and tarry long on the journey for the Old

which went straight to
the point. I like Mr.

cated above, Mr. Cobb's personages find a considerable deal
to say, and say it with a convincing and thoroughly human
effect; with, in fact, just that pleasant vapidity which in
real life is so characteristic of the conversation of other
people. And this of course is precisely the reason for their
popularity.
What a thing it must be for schoolboys to live in these
spacious days and have such books of adventure to read as
the happily-named Plane Tales from the Skies (CASSELL),
by “WING ADJUTANT.” Was there ever a knight from
RoDAND to BAYARD who had such honour in the lists as
several score of youngsters who as like as not were in the
sixth a couple or so of years ago? “WING ADJUTANT" puts
on no literary airs (so challenges no captious critic); he tells
his plain true tales in length appropriate for the articles
of which this book is a selection, and diddles the Censor by
giving no names or dates. I like the yarn of the bored
Squadron Commander who visited a reluctant enemy aero-
drome and dropped a bomb which didn't explode; because
- -in fact it was a pair of
| infantry boots to which
was attached this poig-
|nant message: “If you
won't come up here and
fight herewith one pair
- of boots for work on the
|ground. Pilots—for the
use of.” But the book is
* filled with sterner stuff
than that, and guaranteed
to make anyone feel giddy
—and very humble and
proud.
The Law of the Gun
(CHAPMAN AND HALL) is
concerned with the not
altogether pleasant subject
of revenge. But when I
tell you that the author
is Mr. RIDGwFLL CULLUM
you will know that among
- the many hard cases to
HE Is
allow himself to be put off by it.
While Guy was in France (STANLEY PAUL) is another of
those gentleromances of which Mr.Thomas Cobb has already
produced a list that one might call formidable, if the term
were not so out of keeping with this writer's well-mannered
art. I dare say I need hardly explain that while Guy was
in France the other characters stayed in or about London,
took tea with each other and talked enough to fill every
chapter with a sufficiency of easy-to-read dialogue. The
chief talkers were Cynthia (engaged to Guy) and Oliver,
and their theme was for the most part the infant whom
Cynthia's dead brother was supposed to have left un-
provided for. Whereas really both the child and its
unmarried mother were the concerns of Oliver; upon hear-
ing which Cynthia (not unnaturally) talked more than ever.
By this time Guy had been so fortunate as to get out of
France, with a wound that healed just in time for the happy
ending of which I never remember Mr. CoBB to have dis-
appointed his many admirers. I'm afraid that I have been
guilty of telling you the plot, but if you have, in common
with a very large public, what I may call the CoBB habit
you will certainly wish to know not only the bare facts of
what happened while Guy was in France, but the com-
ments of the author and everyone concerned. As I indi-
which he introduces us are also one or two white men and
a girl of beauty and courage beyond reproach. That is Mr.
CULLUM's way, and I have not a word to say against it.
Here in the first chapter we meet a young cattleman, with
just two dollars between him and starvation, who under-
takes, at the instigation of a half-breed and one Ironsides,
“to run a bunch of beeves” (stolen) to the slaughter-yards
at Fort Rodney. He is arrested by the Canadian police,
tried and sentenced, and, after spending eight years in a
penitentiary, manages to escape. His sole idea is to get
level with Ironsides, and very cleverly he sets to work to
square accounts. The picture of the mining town of
Sunrise is excellently drawn, and once more Mr. CULLUM
shows that in his own field he has no rivals to fear.
“Events convinced these tried friends of the Fatherland that the
game was up, and that they had pinned their colours to the wrong
horse.”—Times.
“Lover of Animals” writes to ask whether the cruel
practice alluded to prevails in English racing circles,
and begs Mr. Punch to throw his powerful influence into
the scale and so give the quietus to such a method of
barbarism. Surely, he says, the colours could equhlly
well be tied to, or indeed painted on, the horse—right or
wrong.

I've no idea to which of your addresses,
Home or away, I ought to send the thing,
So rash are rumour's guesses.
Sofia sounds unlikely. 'Tis a spot
Where local sentiment is apt to vary;
For autocrats it sounds a shade too hot
And most unsanitary.
Rather I judge that where your money is,
Safe for the time from imminent Gehenna,
There too Your Nosiness has followed—viz.
The purlieus of Vienna. "
Unless you've joined, beneath a neutral sky,
And on some eligible Alp located,
That Home for Exiled Kings which our ally,
TINo, inaugurated.
Well, you have chucked the Holy War, and we,
We must fight on without your kind assistance,
While from your fox's earth right loyally
You cheer us in the distance.
For to that tale no ear of mine I'll lend— -
That you, with colours changing like the opal,
For tuppence would attack your poor old friend
And go for Adrianople.
'Tis false. Our FERDIE's heart is true as steel.
Have you not sworn that, though compelled to sever
Your War-engagements (for your country's weal),
Your word's as good as ever.
Myself I can't keep up a faith so fair;
These tyrants of Potsdam–too much they task us;
Clearly the limit must be drawn somewhere;
I draw it at Damascus.
So don't be much surprised if some fine day,
To save my skin and partly too to spite 'em,
I talk of Peace, prepared to give away
One very useful item,
The Dardanelles, with WILLIAM's Orient route,
Waiving my old monopoly of transit,
And risk the wrath of his All-heaviest boot.
FERDIE, I think I'll chance it. O. S.
REPRISALS.
I'llis is a bit of an ass. Chance threw me across his
path, and he kicked me as I lay. You shall hear about it.
IIe would probably never have had the chance but for a
certain Competent Authority, who decided that we had
formed fours long enough in the chrysalis stage of our re-
spective O.T.C.'s. In the sunshine of that Competent
Authority's smile we emerged one day together as the
perfect insect and were attached as Second-Lieutenants to
the Officers' Squad at , never mind where.
The Officers' Squad was two strong, Ellis and I. We
had a Sergeant all to ourselves to train us in the mystery
which the initiated call “detail.” Sometimes I was the O.C.
Squad; sometimes I was just Squad without the O.C.
Ellis didn't play the game. When he was O.C. Squad
he didn't give a thought to my feelings, but used to make
me mark time for hours on end. I said, “Ellis, I will
make you pay for this by-and-by.” I didn't say it out loud,
of course, because when you are Squad you can't say things
like that to O.C. anything. But I knew my time would
Corne. - *
It did; the day arrived when we were told to give the
detail for “forming fours.” … - -
Have you ever formed fours? Yes? Then you won't
have to be told that the place to make for when falling
in is an odd number place, because all the complicated parts
of the figure are reserved for the even numbers. To quote
from that monument of English literature, “Infantry Train-
ing, 1914”: “Odd numbers are called Right Files.” That's
because they stand still and can't go wrong. . . .
I was O.C. squad ; Ellis wasn't. Lllis fell in with the
suspicion of a smile on his ugly face. -
I explained in the grand old words of “Infantry Train-
ing” what is expected of a British soldier when called
upon to form fours. When I had recovered from the
pardonable emotion that my words aroused I thundered
out, “Squad For-r-m-four-rs' " .
Ellis stood like a statue, except that a smile of triumph
lurked at the corners of his cruel mouth. --
“’Alf a mo', Sir,” interrupted the
'aven't numbered your squad yet.” - ; : .
I ground my teeth as I gave the required order: “Squad!
Number 1"
“One,” said Ellis.
“For-r-m-four-rs''' I shrieked.
Ellis stood still and grinned.
Then the idea struck me.
“Number One,” I said kindly, “change places with
Number Two. Squad! Form—fours! Right! Left—turn!
Form—fours! Form—two-deep | Form—fours! About—
turn ''' - -
You should have seen that ass Ellis' face after a quarter-
of-an-hour's forming fours. -
Then we proceeded to “Jerks”—Physical Training some
people call it. It begins with a selection of tortures known
as “Livening-up" exercises. Our P.T. instructor selected
one at random, just to show us how to do it. -
“Class 'Tchun' Livening-up exercise! Double over
and touch those beeches and fall in here. Go!”.
Off we went and touched the beech-trees in question.
When we got back the Sergeant said, “Mr. Ellis, Sir.
Fall out in front.” -
Ellis obeyed. There was murder in his eye. I could
see he was devising some devilish trick. Just then I caught |
sight of something red which bobbed slowly along the
road beyond the trees. It was the dear old Brigadier out
for a walk.
Then the awful thing happened. A voice which I knew
to be Ellis's said, “Livening-up exercise. Double over
and touch those breeches and fall in here. Go!”
I am a conscientious man. The British officer must
learn to obey before he can command. I was longing for
my turn to command. I obeyed. -
:k : ::: ::: :k :k :::
The Brigadier took it very well considering. Ellis and I
are now in a Labour Battalion. I said he was an ass,
didn't I?

Yank (after much thought, to Jock, whose pals have just given a spirited rendering of “Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled"). “SAY, BUD,
JUST PUT ME wise. Who Is THIs GUY, ‘WHA HAY' 2" .
BOOBY-TRAPS.
THE line that the Bosch had held for
many months was reported as evacu-
ated. Like buds upon the trees at the
advent of spring, patrols burst forth
from all along our line, propelled by
a fusillade of paper from behind.
“Touch " must be maintained.
The Hun had gone. Yes, all those
vague and shadowy districts known to
us merely as targets or map references,
the sight of which had only been vouch-
safed us by the use of telescopes and air
photographs, were ours again to roam
at will.
Corps Headquarters despatched a
platoon of Staff Officers representing
goodness knows how many thousands
of pounds a year. Ruthlessly they flung
aside the task of sitting in offices and
correcting one another's mistakes; this
was the time for action. All means of
conveyance — Rolls-Royces, side-cars,
box-cars, bicycles, French carts and, I
was almost going to add, bath-chairs—
were impressed to speed them. Every-
body was delighted. Only the Sappers
groaned. To them would fall the task
of searching for Hun booby-traps and
reporting “O.K.” (to be followed shortly
by a loud explosion and the message,
“Cancel O.K.”).
“Come on,” said Pongo, the strong
silent man of the Intelligence who only
stops talking when he has a catch in
his breath—“come on, G. 3; don't
waste your time in the office wiring to
Army Headquarters, ‘Ref. G. 506, for
L/Cpl. J. Topham read LCpl. J. Pop-
ham.’ Come and see the War.”
“Joy-riding?”
“Joy-riding 2 I'm going to find out
if those really were Bosch ammunition
dumps at G. 36 B. 08 or only flaws on
the photograph. Orderly Order-lee'
Go round to my billet and fetch my
battle-bowler, and get a move on.”
“I can't go,” I said, “there's no-
body left in the whole Corps Head-
quarters; I'm Corps Commander at
present without pay or allowances.”
“Nonsense. Put the Agricultural
Officer in charge; the Staff should be
interchangeable—it is written so in the
Staff Manual.”
And what a sight the country was
when we arrived Like poppies bloom-
ing in the stricken cornfield, Staffs of
all kinds went bobbing hither and
thither, stepping high over loose wires
in case these should be attached to
things which go up in a puff of blue
smoke.
We met the Corps Commander in
the square of a famous town, recon-
queled but a few hours before. “Look
at the wreck they've made of my old
château,” he said.
The famous square had been laid in
ruins, and everybody from the whole
countryside seemed to have collected
there to tell one another so. Different
branches of the same Staff who had
not met for years foregathered and
pointed out their old billets amongst
the débris. A party of Sappers began
to dig.
“Ah, and what are you doing, Cor-
poral?” asked the Staff with their
never-ending cheeriness.
“Suspected delay-action mine here,
Sir ; one went up down the road not
long ago.”
“Quite so, quite so.” The Staff
moved on busily, and presently found
themselves taking a cross-country cut
to save time.
“Look!” cried Pongo, “do you see?
They were ammunition dumps after
all,” and he planted himself trium-
phantly at G. 36 B. 08. “And look at
those flares—Bosch flares. I wonder

matter with it, it won't light"—bang!—
“OO !”
Curiosity was satisfied. Luckily
nobody was hurt, but I borrowed his
matches and forgot to give them back.
Further on we got another reminder
of the Great War. “Quite all right,”
we heard one machine-gunner say to
the officer to whom he was handing
over his three-walled billet, “not at all
a bad place. Don't touch that old tin
bath, by the way, there seems to be a
bit of wire attached to the bottom ; and,
while I think of it, we don't quite like
the look of that vase on the mantel-
piece.” -
“Oh, otherwise all right?” asked
the tenant, and took possession without
another word.
“That's a fine dug-out,” said Pongo
as we rounded a corner of a sunken
road; “I wonder if that's been searched
for documents.” He tried the door.
It was shut fast. He was about to tug
at it when I yelled out sharply and
pulled hill, back. There was some.
thing about the place which aroused
my suspicions. I remembered what
had happened to my sergeant when he
had pulled at a door like that during
the Bosch retreat on the Somme. Very
gingerly we peeped through a small
hole in the door—and our blood really
did run cold. There was a wire run-
ning from the latch into the dug-out
below. The wire was taut. -
For a long time we looked at it so
hard that it's a wonder it didn't go off.
“What are we going to do about
it?” said Pongo at last. “We can't
leave it like that for some poor unsus-
pecting blighter. Better chalk up a
warning on the door and leave it for
the Sappers.”
“Chalk?" We surveyed the chalkless
waste. It was a silly suggestion.
“I wonder how the thing works,”
said Pongo, sniffing at it. “By Jove,
it opens inwards. I see, as soon as
the wire is relaxed up goes the whole
caboodle. Better leave it—what?” .
Of course we didn't leave it. It
fascinated us. We threw small stones
at it, then lumps of earth, then larger
lumps, bricks, duds. Really we worked
like Trojans, but the door remained
shut fast. -
“Idiots we are " cried Pongo.
“Haven't we got revolvers? Let's
shoot the lock off " -
How easy. Why hadn't we thought
of it before ? Taking up our stand at
about twenty paces distant, Broncho
Bill and Cowboy Pete blazed away. ||
We tried shooting with the right hand,
with the left hand, both hands, crooked
arm, straight arm, standing, kneeling
and in the prone position over a sand-
bag rest. Oh, it wasn't that we didn't
hit it; we hit it often—the door, I
mean, but the latch part of it was the
difficulty. -
As the last round ricochetted off a
stone we reluctantly gave it up as a
bad job, and after a moment's survey
of our handiwork turned away in
disgust. .
Suddenly an old rugged Scotsman,
carrying his kilt over his arm, came
out of the dug-out and saluted us
smartly. -
“I hear-r-d a knocking,” said he.
“Will ye be wanting somebody, Sir 2"
We would not. We had just called,
in passing, to see if the family was at
home. And we passed. L.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE INSTANTANEOUS RANK-ADJUSTER.
THE other day, on my arrival from
France, my relatives decided that I
must have a new tunic and sell the old
one in aid of local charities. Having
realised my remaining securities and
taken Mr. Cox into my confidence, I
approached my tailor and put myself
in his hands. My tailor isn't the man
he used to be, but only his grandfather;
the autocrat who designed my outfit in
pre-war days being now a Temporary
Second Lieutenant Acting Colonel of
the 67th Tweedshires. To this fact
we owe, as will be seen, one of the
greatest military inventions of the age.
The old gentleman, now a little de-
crepit, shook his head when he saw my
clothes, while at the same time a glow
of more than usual interest illumined
his ancient eyes. He inclines to be
talkative, but never foolishly. -
“Yes,” he said, “ you're a little
stouter than when we last had the
pleasure of fitting you, Sir—doubtless
the feeding at the Front. You'll re-
quire one or two more wound-stripes
and chevrons, no doubt? Medal ribbons?
We have some yery nice V.C. ribbon in
just now, Sir ; but most gentlemen pre-
fer this variegated effect in purple and
white. What about badges of rank 2
You're not quite sure what to wear?
I expected as much. Now, Sir, you've
come to us most opportunely. Do you
realise what has done most injury to
the garment you very rightly propose
to discard 2 Not mere wear and tear;
not enemy action; not even batmen.
Where has it suffered most 2 Not at
the elbows; not in the pockets. No,
Sir—the sleeves have gone. And why
have the sleeves gone, leaving the bust
and torso comparatively sound 2 The
trained eye can see : it is because of
the constant changes of the insignia of
rank. I note here traces of incessant
variation—a history of promotions and
reversions as distressing to the sar-
torial eye as it is, I doubt not, dis-
tressing to the straight-forward mili-
tary mind.
“Now, Sir, Mr. George, my grandson,
who, when he wrote on Monday, was
commanding his Battalion and wearing
the badges of a Lieutenant-Colonel, has
forlong wrestled with the same problems
as yourself, spoiling tunic after tunic in
his efforts always to carry the correct
badges of rank. He has now, however,
during a brief rest, evolved the Instan-
taneous Rank-Adjuster. It necessitates,
I must explain, the wearing of badges
on the shoulders and not the sleeves.
Here is a specimen. Very simple, as
you see, consisting of an endless strap
for both shoulders, each strap bearing,
in correct succession, badges of all com-
missioned ranks from Second-Lieutenant
to Field-Marshal. The strap runs round
this inconspicuous aluminium roller
which is inserted in the deltoid hem—
where the top of the sleeve joins the
shoulder—and round a similar roller
beneath the superior lapel. From
there it is led by a clever arrangement
behind the clavicular panel—or, speak-
ing as a layman, the back of the coat—
and round a third roller secured diagon-
ally to the dorsal gusset, which you
probably know as the seam running
down the spine, Sir.
“Let us presume that you are once
again a happy innocent lad, a Second
Lieutenant, proud of the KING's com-
mission and of the gentlemanly yet
serviceable outfit provided by us at
moderate terms. One morning your
Battalion unfortunately suffers casual-
ties and you find yourself an Acting
Captain. No unpicking; no sewing;
no boring holes in your shoulder-strap
with a bayonet. You apply this tiny
key (supplied in duplicate with every
Adjuster) to the dorsal roller and re-
volve it until the necessary arrange-
ment of constellations appears on the
exposed portion of the shoulder-strap.
Next day you are wounded and sent
home ; you recover and return to
France. Again no unpicking; no sew-
ing. A few turns of the key make
you once more a Second Lieutenant,
your tunic none the worse for these
vicissitudes.
“Again, let us say you are going on
leave—such things do happen—and for
personal reasons do not desire to be
detailed as O.C. Storm Pans, or for any
other duty. You adjust the key, revolve
the roller until the shoulder-strap dis-
plays whatever badge observation has
taught you ensures immunity from
R.T.O.'s, and go aboard unjostled and
unmolested.
“Many other occasions will arise in
military life on which the Instantaneous
Adjuster will be invaluable. My grand-
son the Colonel goes so far as to suggest
that busy officers in doubt as to their
standing may avail themselves of its
adjustability to wear the badge of a dif-
ferent rank on each shoulder.
“If the War Office decide to authorise
badges showing whether rank is sub-
stantive, temporary, acting, honorary,
presumptive, executive or passive, and,
if coming under several of these head-
ings, which, and in each case whether
with or without pay, allowances, over-
time, bonuses and free insurance, we
shall put on the market an elaborator
attachment to the Adjuster. In the
meantime may I fit your new tunic
with one of the simpler type 2"
Wouldn't you have said “Yes”?
I did.
RUMINATIONS.
[Reflections of a soldier on hearing that
certain of our more famatical politicians advo-
cate the abolition of the Army rum ration.]
THE Power that, bringing man to birth,
Ordained for each his proper place,
Fixed for each one his weight and girth,
His wealth, his rank, his club, his
race,
Religion, way of thinking,
Confirmed in all men from the first
A frequently recurrent thirst,
With means and will for drinking.
Barley was made for those who brew
The beer that slakes the Briton's
meal;
The apple's rose and russet hue
Was fashioned mainly to conceal
The cider juice within it;
Beer, cider—both will cool the throat,
But if we had to take a vote
We think the beer would win it.
Here's to the luscious wines that foam
Around the feet of laughing girls,
Falernian loved of ancient Rome,
The crusted ports of belted earls,
Sweet wines of Samarcand,
The sherry steeped in Spanish sun,
The hock that swells the swollen Hun,
Tokay and Emu brand.
There are strange drinks for those who
choose
To suck their liquor through a straw,
Such potions as the Sammies use
And lesser breeds without the law—
I’eers, Publicans and Sheenies—
Dopes that the Colonels at the Ritz
Seek when on leave from strafing
Fritz,
Manhattans and Martinis.
And we who, keeping nightly watch
- In Flanders' living grave abide,
Toast him who deals us out the Scotch,
And, at the fall of eventide,
Look shrewdly for the beaker;
But most of all we gladly coune
To thank the man who makes the
l'um,
And never makes it weaker.
And when at last the bugle blows
In Potsdam for that great parade
When WILHELM sees our ranks reclose
And all his hopes of empire fade,
Himself without a billet,
VoN KLUck will see the water hot,
RUPPRECHT will issue out a tot,
And HINDENBURG refill it.
“There is a lus! in the war news to-day,
which gives an Imranny feeling to the specula-
tive interest with which the next move in the
great drama on the Western Front is being

feeling.

THE DEMONSTRATION PLAT00N.
I AM in disgrace. Bronker, who
commands No. 11 Platoon, is in dis-
grace. I am in despair. Bronker is
not. He is always in trouble of some
sort, while I had been made Assistant
Adjutant and was very much in favour
with the C.O. until yesterday, when
the awful thing happened.
I was sitting in the orderly-room
when the C.O. came in with a letter in
his hand.
“Brown,” he said, after a smiling
acknowledgment of my salute, “do you
know anything about Demonstration
Platoons 2 ”
“Not very much, I'm afraid, Sir,”
I replied. (Our C.O. appreciates a ju-
dicious display of ignorance on the part
of his junior officers.)
“Well, you'll have an opportunity
of adding to your knowledge this after-
noon. I have a note here from the
Commandant of the Corps School” (we
are out at rest a good way back from
the line), “inviting me to a demonstra-
tion to be given this afternoon by his
Demonstration Platoon, which is sup-
posed to be a very good one.”
“Yes, Sir,” I said, as he paused there.
“They are going to give a demon-
stration of march discipline.”
“Yes, Sir,” I said.
“And they are going to start by
giving examples of bad march dis-
cipline.”
“Yes, Sir,” I said. -
“I am going to take you with me
“Yes, Sir, thank you,” I said.
Yesterday afternoon, shortly before
the appointed hour of 3 P.M., I was
standing with the C.O. on a bank at
the cross roads at P. 24 B. 35-67
(Sheet 159D) in accordance with the
directions given. Almost as we looked
round for the first time we saw a body
of men, in numbers apparently about
the strength of a platoon, in appearance
somewhat resembling a party of bean-
feasters walking home after upsetting
their char-à-banc in a ditch. They
were already near enough for the eye
to ascertain that the leading figure
x -
-
wore the dress of an Officer in His
Majesty's Army.
“Look at those men,” said the C.O
I looked. “Look at them straggling
all over the road and the Platoon Com-
mander stalking on without showing
the slightest interest. Look at the
officer's servant walking in the ditch
with a chicken in one hand and a tea-
pot in the other. Look at that man
with a blanket bundle slung over his
shoulder; I suppose his equipment's
in that; he's certainly not wearing
any. And the step—I've never seen so
many steps among so few men. I tell
Lieut. Brummell (after his first night "Somewhere in France"). “SHEETs Not over:-
CLEAN IN MY BED, ORDERLY."
Orderly. “CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT, SIR.
MAJOR.”
THE LAST MAN THAT SLEPT IN THEM WAS A
you what, Brown, I've always admired
the British soldier, but I've never
realised before that he has the makings
of a first-class actor in him. I congra-
tulate you, Colonel,” he said, turning
to the Commandant of the School, who
had just come up, “on the best show
I've ever seen. Your platoon is won-
derful, and the man who trained it
must be a genius.”
“I'm afraid I don't quite follow
you,” said the Commandant; “I was
just going to apologise for keeping you
waiting because there was some mis-
take in sending out the orders, and my
Demonstration Platcon won't be here
before 3.30.” -
By this time the men we had been
watching were coming very near, and
just as I thought I recognised the
officer I suddenly remembered that
No. 11 Platoon had been ordered to
change their billet that day, and that
their route lay along the road we were
watching.
“But what on earth—” the C.O.
started, but, before he could finish, a
veritable, an indubitable, Bronkerturned
his head and eyes towards the C.O. and
executed his best and most ponderous
salute. -
I did try to keep back that laugh—
my lips are still sore where I bit them
—but laugh I did right under the eyes
of the C.O. He is a fine soldier, our
C.O., but a little lacking in the sense
of humour. And now, though my
haversack may be lighter without the
Field-Marshal's bâton which, I fear,
will never repose in it again, my heart
is heavy.
Another Glimpse of the Obvious.
“Mr. G. H. Roberts, M.P., Minister for
Labour, said the happenings of the last
six weeks justified them in the belief that
peace was much nearer than it was during the
earlier part of the year.”—Evening Paper.
“Brassworkers and Metal Mechanics,
Coventry Branch, held their annual floral
might on Saturday. Estimating the weight
of a large bumpkin caused much amusement
and profit.”—Midland Paper.
It was sporting of the stout bucolic to
lend himself to the general enjoyment.

CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER XC.
George. Pray tell me, Mamma, how
it came about that there was a paper
famine at the same time that the
country was so rich in paper-money?
Mrs. M. You have set me a difficult
conundrum, but I imagine the true
answer to be that the paper famine
was only relative, and that all the paper
used for banknotes was as nothing to
that required for unnecessary books and
newspapers.
Mary. George always asks such tire-
some questions. Please tell us some-
thing more interesting. What was the
Spanish influenza” I suppose it was
a sort of dance.
Mrs. M. You would have done better
to stop short at your question instead
of betraying your ignorance by suggest-
ing the answer. Influenza, as I think
I have told you in our earlier conversa-
tions, first visited these shores in the
year 1836, in the form of a catarrh
accompanied by a tendency to fever.
Towards the end of the century the
Russian variety, with constantly chang-
ing symptoms, became prevalent. Your
grandfather has told me that when he
had it, everything he ate tasted, in his
rude but picturesque phrase, of “gun-
powder and rotten eggs.” Owing to
the passion for abbreviation, to which
I have never succumbed, the complaint
was vulgarly known as “flu,” and
seemed to have died out when it was
re-imported from Spain twenty years
later, though some people attributed
it to the “hidden hand.” Mexican,
Mesopotamian and Patagonian varieties
followed, but the disease was finally
stamped out by the efforts of a special
Ministry of Influenza whose head-
quarters were at the British Museum,
and which employed a staff of five
thousand officials with a minimum
salary of ten pounds a week. Your
grandfather, who held a high position
in the Ministry on the strength of his
knowledge of Oriental languages, used
to speak of his appointment as the best
remunerated sinecure—or, as Richard
would say, the “softest job"—he had
ever enjoyed.
Mary. Please, Mamma, are Pancelts

were a group of people who wished to
give a wider scope to the Celtic Revival
of which I told you, and the word Celt
is by some derived from “kilt,” the
ancient and scanty dress of the abori-
ginal inhabitants of Scotland and Ire-
land. Owing to the shortage of cloth
the proposal to make the kilt com-
pulsory was favourably supported for a
while, but ultimately the integuments
of nether man resumed their dual form.

THE “GOOD INTENT.”
[The ketch Good Intent, built at Plymouth
of British oak one hundred and twenty-eight
years ago, is probably the oldest British mer-
chant vessel afloat.]
THEY built her in the olden days,
They built her strong, they built her
stout;
In Farmer GEORGE's golden days
It must have been or thereabout.
They knew no rush or hustle then,
They drove no rivets racing time;
A sort of pleasant bustle then
chime. -
With care and pains they'd linger on
Each chisel touch and mallet stroke,
And lay a loving finger on
Her curving sides of Devon oak.
And so they worked, and so she grew
From garboard unto gunwale strake,
And if uncommon slow she grew
They built to last and no mistake.
Well, finish her they did at last;
Sparred, rigged and fitted forth she
went, -
And out to sea she slid at last—
The ketch of Plymouth, Good Intent.
She went—and Lord! she's going still;
The same old sea's beneath her bow;
The same old winds are blowing still;
The same old skies behold her now.
The Channel lights they wink at her
(They've done it at her cargoes too!);
The friendly stars they blink at her
The way they always used to do.
The coast from North to South she
knows,
Its tiny ports and sleepy piers;
From Hull to Avonmouth she knows—
She's used 'em for a hundred years.
Old Téméraire she might have seen,
And curtseyed to the Victory;
And many a ding-dong fight have seen,
For those were lively times at sea.
The packets in their day were new,
And many a bluff East Indiaman—
She saw 'em all when they were new,
Since first her sailing days began.
She saw, she waved them on their way,
Trim brig and plunging seventy-four,
And one and all they've gone their way
Like clouds that pass and are no
* more.
Frigate and sloop and battleship,
She's seen 'em come, she's seen 'em
go,
Red tramp and reeking cattle-ship
And China clipper winged like snow.
But still her old luck nods to her,
Filled up the hours from chime to

THOSE THIRTY MINUTES.
THERE are many things to teach
children which are not now included
in any curriculum; and one of the first
is not to hang about seeing people off
by train.
Then such episodes as this, thousands
of which are being enacted on railway
platforms every day, would no longer
be possible.
Scene: VICTORIA.
The train for Brighton is in and
already full, although half-an-hour has
yet to go. In a first-class compartment
intended for six are ten persons, among
them a meek girl squeezed between
Lieutenants who have IT
lifted the padded arms
dividing the seats. Out-
side at the window is
the meek girl's friend,
an elderly woman, who
has come to see her off.
They have nothing to
say to each other; but
the friend cannot tear
herself away. The other
passengers hate the
sight of her,
Elderly Woman.

self.

IT WAS ONLY A LUMP OF THE PROPAGAN DIST LITERATURE THAT THE
OUR OFFICIAL NOVELIST.
As might naturally be expected, the
news of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT's ap-
pointment as Director of Propaganda
bas excited the liveliest interest.
Locally perhaps the greatest enthusi-
asm has been shown in Staffordshire,
where the Mayor of IIANLEY is, we
understand, promoting a movement
to confer the Freedom of the Five
Towns on their most famous inhabitant.
On the other hand, gloom reigns in
Paternoster Row. A leading publisher,
interviewed by our representative,
took a decidedly pessimistic view of
the situation. “Where,” he asked,
“will it end, if the State is going to
sterilize our imaginative writers by
harnessing them to politics? And how
are we going to live if our “best sellers'
are all to be mopped up? John BUCHAN,
ARNoLD BENNETT–why, they'll be com-
mandeering ETHEL. M. DELL, CHARLES
GARVICE and the Baroness ORCzY next.
England without novels, as my prin-
cipal reader wittily put it to me, is like
a slum without hovels.” Here his
emotion overcame him, and he rushed
off to a vegetarian restaurant.
Sir HALL CAINE said he was prepared
to watch the experiment in a spirit of
benevolent neutrality. It was not true
that he had been asked to join the
literary side of the Department. Eng-
land and the Isle of Man had other
claims upon him which he might find
it difficult, nay impossible, to forgo.
Mr. LYTTON STRACHEY confessed to
being rather disconcerted by the ap-
pointment. He had already completed
a study of Mr. BENNETT for his forth-
coming volume on eminent Post-Vic-
torians, and this new development,
coupled with Mr. BENNETT's recent ap-
pearance as an illustrator, would involve
a drastic revision of his manuscript.
Mr. WELLs said that it was a “great
adventure,” and that he had no doubt
Mr. BENNETT would give the public
“what the public wants;" for the rest
he had himself been doing the work un-
officially and exhaustively for the last
ten years. -
Lastly, Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE, while
cordially admitting Mr. BENNETT's
|ability, expressed doubts whether he
was sufficiently rich in uplift and unc-
tion. As a phrenologist he found Mr.
BENNETT weak in those cranial develop-
ments which indicated the possession
of the highest humanitarian qualities.
According to the latest advices, Mr.
BENNETT and his staff will take up
their quarters at the Grand Babylon
Hotel. —
An advertisement:—
“SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
—'S ARTIFICIAL TEETH.”
A tribute to their perfect articulation.
“Tax bachelors of either sex fifty per cent.
of their incomes, with rebates for wife and each
child up to four.”
Times Educational Supplement.
Imagine the emotion with which a poor
bachelor of either sex, saddled with the
incubus of a wife and four children and
crippled with the loss of half his (or
her) income, would apply for the kindly
rebate.

THE LIFE CERTIFICATE.
THE joke, I believe, was originated
by a private of the R.A.M.C. just over
a year ago. He approached me in the
darkness, bent over me, then remarked
briefly to his fellow stretcher-bearer,
“This bloke's dead.”
I opened my eyes and assured him
huskily but forcibly that he was in
error, and he at once accepted my
assurances. He did not ask me to fill
up a form and have it signed by an
officer or a magistrate; the mere fact
that I could speak was sufficient evi-
dence for his quick brain that I was
alive, although he did seem rather hurt
because I had contradicted him.
Possibly he passed on the news that
I had no right to be alive, or it may
inspector you cannot collect the first
instalment of your pension.”
She indicated a section of the last
form I had signed, and then it was I
discovered that the authorities had
adopted and elaborated the R.A.M.C.
man's grim joke. I found that they
still harboured grave doubts, apparently,
about my being really alive, and re-
quired a declaration and certificate to
that effect before they were prepared
to pay me any money. -
“This is to certify that I have seen
the man described above alive on the
date stated against my name, that he
subscribed the declaration in my pre-
sence, and that his age, height, &c.,
appear to correspond with the par-
ticulars shown on his Identity Cer-
tificate,” I read, together with the
declined to accept my unsupported
statement and insisted that the Life
Certificate must be signed in accord-
ance with regulations.
Whereupon I betook myself to a
police-station and explained to an inspec-
tor—who, I fear, mistook me at first for
a wandering lunatic—that the Govern-
ment were conspiring to presume me
dead, and that I wished him to certify
that I was still alive. He seemed
relieved when I produced the official
form, and he signed the Life Certificate
with the air of a man who disapproves
of levity in connection with serious
subjects.
Feeling that I truly lived again, I
returned to the Pensions Office, and
suggested to an official that the
R.A.M.C. were carrying the joke too
be that all the members IT
of the R.A.M.C. had ar-
ranged the grim joke be-
forehand. I only know
that in hospital, a few
nights later, an R.A.M.C.
orderly reported that I
was dead, and some of
the staff seemed unflat-
teringly disappointed at
finding me still alive next
morning.
I heard nothing fur-
ther of the joke until
the Army authorities de-
. cided they could win the
War without any further
assistance from me, and ,
I became a civilian again.
Then I discovered that
the grim jest had been
elaborated into an Army
Form during my convalescence.
I was invited to call at the Pensions
Office, where I filled up several forms,
in one of which, if I remember rightly,
I had to give particulars as to the age,
sex and occupation of my grandfather,
details as to the birthplace and maiden
name of my wife, and information con-
cerning the colour of the eyes and hair
of my daughter, together with an inti-
mate and almost indelicate descrip-
tion of myself, and my “distinguishing
marks.”
I trembled lest the charming and
business-like young lady who appeared
to be deputising for the Minister of
Pensions should insist upon verifying
the last - mentioned particulars, and
breathed more freely when she merely
demanded to see my discharge papers.
“Now you must go to the nearest
police-station,” she announced calmly
but firmly, and I gasped.
“But why?” I stammered.

Majesty's Civil, Military (including
Special Reserve, Territorial Force, &c.)
or Naval Service, or by the man's

Serjeant.” In a footnote the authori-
ties added that “The Officer of His
Majesty's Civil Service must be, or (if

|far; but he defended the
Department warmly, as-
suring me that some of
the forms had been de-
signed by an Insurance
official.
Then it flashed upon
me that perchance I
was doing the R.A.M.C.
an injustice. Insurance
Companies, you know,
never believe anybody is
dead, and refuse to pay
out any money until they
get a proper death cer-
tificate, and it occurred
to me at once that the
gentleman from the In-
surance Company must
have hit upon the happy
idea of refusing to believe
any man was alive, or to
pay him his pension, until he produced
a proper Life Certificate. -
However, whether the idea originated
in the R.A.M.C. or in the brain of an
Insurance cfficial, the joke, as far as I
am concerned, is now becoming some-
what frayed at the edges, for the
Pensions Office persists in working it
off on me once every three months. I
now no longer delight in watching the
alarmed expression on the face of a
country police sergeant when I ask him
solemnly to declare and certify that I
am not dead; even the joy of asking a
pompous old permanent official if his

that if he receives less than two hun-
dred he is not a fit person to judge
whether or not I am alive), and the
excitement of inquiring of , dug-out
Colonels if they are commissioned
officers, begin to pall. -
But I am haunted by the fear that
feebly endeavoured to convince the lady the Great Mind which evolved the idea
that I was not a camouflaged corpse;
but she, unlike the stretcher-bearer,
of the Life Certificate may persuade the
War Office to apply the scheme to men

American to the very depths of her soul,
which was of the kind and motherly

was the youngest thing on earth. He
wore a cheerfully cherubic small-boy
expression and an empty sleeve. How
he got into the United States Army I
can't think, but in it he was, and the
condition of his sleeve showed that he
had kept going with the best. The
two were strangers, but no doubt you
can believe that they did not long re-
main so. In about ten minutes they
had raked up some mutual acquaint-
ances across the pond, and by the time
we got to the terminus they were old

To my aid serenely speeding from the blest Pierian pool,

I may chant the wondrous story
Of the glamour and the glory of the Swabian Summer School.
Far from war's insensate striving,
Plotting, planning and contriving,
From the tyrannous slave-driving of the Ministerial Ghoul;
Far from London's futile clatter
And its enervating chatter,
We discussed the Things that Matter, at the Swabian Sum-

Viz. the psychics of STRAVINSKY,
Or the uplift of KANDINSKY,
Or the plays of Bobolinsky, or the “curves” of Mrs. Bool.E,
Or Peruvian folk-jingles,
Borrow's theory of dingles,
Or the turnip-cure for shingles, at the Swabian Summer
School.
There were present Yugo-Fabians,
Theosophic Astrolabians, -
Several blameless Bessarabians and Koreans from Seoul;
With a brace of Finn historians,
Some Rabindranath-Tagorians,
And a group of "Montessorians, at the Swabian Summer
School. ‘. - -
We had talks on breeding pigeons,
On polygamous religions,
of the Phrygians and the manners of the mule;
On the esoteric meaning
. Of the Celtic art of “keening,” -
And on vacuum spring-cleaning, at the Swabian Summer
School. -
On the music
Wormwood Pshaw descanted gaily
On “Mock-Justice at Old Bailey,”
On “The Blasphemy of PALEY,” and on “SHAKser:ARE:
Super-Fool;” -
And produced a huge sensation
By a daily demonstration
Of his prowess in natation, at the Swabian Summer School.
To the smart and modish Wandal
* - Our attire caused quite a scandal,
For the votaries of the sandal never bow to Fashion's rule;
But our garb was hygienic,
And our chevelures Hellenic,
Lending lustre that was scenic to the Swabian Summer
School. -
We had dances, too, fantastic,
Yet by no means orgiastic,
But Delsartean and plastic, when the nights were calm
and cool,
With refreshing drinks, symbolic
Of a spiritual frolic,
And of course non-alcoholic, at the Swabian Summer School.
All delights must have an ending,
And the student, slowly wending
I'rom the scenes of his unbending, sought his home and

But illumined and enlightened,
With his mental stature heightened
And his astral aura brightened, by the Swabian Summer

benefit of Mr. BonAR LAw and his minions in the Ex-
chequer. My official was a very zealous person, and
apparently had the right to call himself a Surveyor of
Taxes. Seeing what taxes are in these days, he must be
having a busy time of it. -
Have you ever seen a Surveyor of Taxes 2 No? Nor had
I until about ten days ago; and when I say that I saw a
Surveyor of Taxes ten days ago I do not mean that I really
saw him and got so near to him that I might have called
him “old fellow,” or slapped him on the back, or employed
any other familiarity with him—no, F mean that ten days ago
I became acutely aware of his official existence by receiving
from him an oblong envelope On His Majesty's Service and
containing a letter in which Mr. Benjamin Hallowfield
drew my attention to the fact that I had committed some
error or other in my return of Income Tax, and would I
please send in a cheque for same at the earliest possible
moment? If, however, I decided to appeal, I must give
notice on or before a certain date.
Now I may be a fool, but I deny that I am such a fool
as to put myself in the hands of the Income Tax Com-
missioners by appealing. What chance do you think a
non-official has if he once gets tied up in officials? So I
decided to admit the error and pay up. Still, I didn't see
why I shouldn't have a little joy out of the incident, and I
decided to worry the Surveyor by writing him a rhymed
letter and seeing how he would take it. Here is my letter:
“Dear Sir, I have your very painful letter, and note that
to the State you hold me debtor in thirteen pounds, a
pretty tidy sum, which strikes me blind and deaf and
almost dumb. A word of warning, Sir: in your assessing
you go too much—yes, far too much—by guessing. Still,
there you are, and with extensive view “survey" mankind
from China to Peru. And, lest I get it fairly in the neck,
I mean to take my pen and write a cheque. Therefore
rejoice, for as you go your rounds you're so much richer
by my gift of pounds.”
I posted this letter and waited for Mr. Hallowfield's
reply. None came, so I went at him again with two lines
of verse as follows:—
“Dear Sir, my last letter was not all my eye; you have
read it by now and should send a reply.”
Again I waited, but no answer came.
Mr. Hallowfield once more as thus:—
“Dear Sir, you are really too slack and too slow;
ought to have answered me ages ago.”
Two more days passed, and then I received the following
letter from the Surveyor of Taxes:—
“Dear Sir, your three letters are duly to hand, and
permit me to tell you they've beaten the band. Did you
think that a mixture of taxes and money with a man who
surveyed was essentially funny ? There's nothing that
keeps a surveyor from rhyme; he could do it like you if he
only had time. Here's a tit for your tat which you little
expected, and a rhyme for your rhyme, well-revised and
corrected. And learn for your good what the manner-books
teach : there are plenty of pebbles still left on the beach.”
That settled it. I troubled the Surveyor no more. But
when your Surveyor descends from his official pinnacle and
pays you back in your own coin, what is a man to do? It
must be very exhilarating to live in an atmosphere com-
pounded of Income Tax returns and light verse.
So I provoked

OUGHT TO BE HERE IN A COUPLE OF HOURS OR SO.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Its publishers are certainly justified in claiming a special
interest for The Burgomaster of Stilemonde (METHUEN) as
“a drama of to-day by one whose plays are normally with-
out definite time or place.” This vivid and terrible little
episode of the invasion of Belgium shows M. MAURICE
MAETERLINCK in a new aspect, a realist so severe that his
facts are left to work their own emotional appeal, without
apparently the least manipulation. When the Germans
occupy Stilemonde and hold its Burgomaster hostage, one
of their officers is shot by an unknown assailant. Therefore
the Burgomaster must pay the penalty unless he will
permit the sacrifice of an obviously innocent old servant
whom the invaders profess to suspect. That is the whole
matter. It is never known who did in fact fire the shot.
There are only three characters of any importance: the
Burgomaster, his married daughter, and his German son-in-
law, a very cleverly-drawn character who is made the
mouthpiece of that Teutonic philosophy which was precisely
then revealing itself to a bewildered world. These two
figures, indeed, the old man and the young, stand in their
antagonism for the contrast between two creeds, honour
and expediency. The conflict between them is profoundly
sincere and moving. One very minor point however I must
mention. It is surely strange that in the last Act the clock
should strike six on page 98, and after scarcely ten minutes'
worth of dialogue be already sounding seven (the hour of
execution). This is so obvious, I hesitate to say so striking,
a point that I am uncertain whether it may not be inten-
tional as conveying a subjective sense of time in presence
of emotion. In any case however it would be well for
Mr. MARTIN HARVEY, who has acquired the acting rights,
to eliminate what might prove too fine a subtlety for the
average British audience.
Under the intentionally misquoted title, Old Saws and
Modern Instances (CHAPMAN AND HALL), Mr. W. L.
CourTNEY has collected certain critical studies, most of
them relative to the drama. As he himself explains in a brief
preface, his “main desire has been to illustrate modern
questions by ancient examples.” One fancies therefore that
“New Saws and Ancient Instances” might have been a more
fitting label; but that by the way. In the pursuit of this
plan of comparisons the writer has given us two dramatic
analogies, HARDY and AEscHYLUs (with special reference to
The Dynasts) and BRIEUX and EURIPIDEs. Interesting as
both these studies are, I fancy the casual reader—or semi-
casual; the really casual would probably put the whole
volume down unread beyond page 2—will find most plea-
sure in a lengthy paper on Realistic Drama, which involves
a survey of the London stage during the last half-century,
and in Mr. CourTNEY's very agreeable and appreciative
open letter to an American friend on the art and personality
of Sir HERBERT TREE. Now and again the value of the
conclusions has been something impaired by time; our
views, for example, upon the young Russians are probably
a little modified since the date upon which Mr. Court.NEY
wrote about them. On the whole, however, these papers
(I should not presume to call them fugitive) were well
worth. collection, though the circle to which they will
appeal is naturally a limited one. One word of criticism : I
was astonished to find that Mr. Court.NEY, in his very just
tribute to the influence of Sir A. W. PINERO (to whom we
are in danger of becoming ungrateful), should make no
mention of Mid-Channel, surely one of the best plays of
its period and worthy to be bracketed with Iris at the head
of the ARTHURIAN drama.
Mr. OLIVER ONIONs calls his latest book, The New Moon
(Hodder AND StoughtoN), a “Romance of Reconstruction,”
which means that it deals with England in the days when

the great question, “How Long 2" shall have been finally
answered. It is thus only in part, a small part, Romance,
and much more an essay on social change, as Mr. ONIONs
thinks it will or could be. The great defect of this method
is that any effort to believe it all true becomes manifestly
impossible; also that the serious purpose is apt to over-
balance the story. I was the more sorry for this because
Mr. ONIONs' people were continually showing signs that, if
the author had not restricted them to the function of
examples, they could have been quite entertainingly human.
Helme, the hero, who “ had the look of having been very
much older, and yet of having somehow come young again,”
remains, despite this pleasant touch, rather wooden; but
Betty and her mother are both delightful, and Kimber, the
type of amateur official, “pompous about multiplied no-
things,” is so shrewdly sketched that I should have wel-
comed more of him. As for the author's “reconstruction,”
this is always at the least interest- ſ - -
ing; transportation, one gathers,
is the crux of it. Also a generally
accelerated pace that constrains

Otherwise human behaviour (you
will be relieved to hear) is to re-

in the world's history, which, ac- #
cording to Mr. ONIONs, “men
spoke of as The Bloodletting.”
If our fighting men are really
engaged in nothing better than
this, I fear the change in them
will be more radical than Mr.
ONIONs seems to suspect.

attention, to hold us as much by its keen character analysis
as by its descriptive power and the ramifications of its sensa-
tional plot. In this I was disappointed. The people who
weave their toils and counter-toils about the unfortunate
young man from Trinidad are unreal. Perhaps this doesn't
matter much if we are expecting no more than a mystery
for our money. The author is adept at surrounding her
subjects with a nimbus of repulsion and gloom and at
keeping us guessing to the end. She paints her scenery
with a fidelity and charm which seem to appeal in vain for
real men and women, instead of the puppets of adventure,
to come and people her stage. With these we feel no sense
of intimacy; they are simply German villain, Japanese
villain, amateur sleuth, etc., conventional types with no
individuality of their own. By way of compensation the
author can conjure up all the sights and sounds and smells
that have connected themselves unfadingly in our minds
with familiar places. For light en-
tertainment The Man from Trini-
dad can be recommended unre-
servedly, but I shall not abandon
the hope of better things to come.
Mr. PETT RIDGE divides Special
Performances (METHUEN) into a
First and Second House, an inno-
cuous conceit. His “Programme ''

suppose they ought to be called,

ſº I say “hearing,” because Mr. PETT
%| RIDGE is one of the few modern
authors whose work benefits by
being read aloud. Nobody can
make better bricks from less straw.
He can be funny, too, without
being facetious; his ridicule of the
foibles of his characters is always
genial and touched with sympathy.
In a word he is human, and as an
antidote to the “superior" brand
of novelist I know nobody to equal
him. One of these sketches is
specially to be praised. It is called
“In the Service,” and tells the
story of Captain Hards, of the Jane
Maria, who suddenly found that
entrenched conservative. Here - - -
among the teachers is the ferment of revolution and a
consuming zeal for human values. Perhaps it is rather
a mournful thing for us to have to reflect how much
more intelligently certain things are being done now
than in our young days, pre-eminently in the teaching of
history, of geography, of music, of handicraft, of mathe-
matics—to mention no more—but this is no bad thing for
those of us who are so soon to graduate as professed praisers
of a departed age. I almost, yet not quite, wish I could
go back and begin again under such guidance as these
writers could unquestionably give.
one realise how much better moulded our nephews are likely
to be than we were in our time, and perhaps it may save
some of us from that easy avuncular patronage which must
be even more offensive to them than it was to us.
It cannot be truthfully said that the promise of The
Pointing Man has been fulfilled in The Man from Trinidad
(Hutchinson). Not that the latter is a bad yarn in its way,
but I confess that I expected the author's next story (she is
anonymous, but I know her name) to command more serious

A BREACH IN THE HOHENZOLLERN LINE.
WHEN CoNSTANTINo abdicated
All for his country's greater good,
The throne that he evacuated
Remained in situ (where it stood);
Though Father's rule had been erratic,
The very moment he had gone
Son ALEXANDER (democratic)
Stepped in and carried on.
When FERDIE dropped the regal status,
Chucking his crown to salve his head,
He left behind no rude hiatus, -
But Boris plugged the gap instead;
Nor did his absence, now conclusive,
Cause much upheaval in the air,
For FERDIE's life was unobtrusive
And mostly spent elsewhere.
But you, my WILLIE, make a vital
Error if you embrace the view
That these examples which I cite 'll
Serve as a precedent for you;
That, should the People relegate your
Father to some inferior hole,
You, as his heir, by force of nature
Will fill the vacant rôle.

And sick of this pro-Junker strife,

Albert Edward and I were seated
on a log outside the hen-house which
kennelled our pack when we perceived
Algy, the A.D.C., tripping daintily to-
wards us. Albert Edward blew a kiss.
“Afternoon, Algy. How chic he looks
in his pink and all! Tell me, do people
ever mistake you for a cinema atten-
dant and give you pennies?”
“Afternoon, Algy,” said I. “Been
spending a strenuous morn carrying
the old man's respirator—with his
lunch inside?”
For answer Algy tipped me back-
wards off the log and, sitting down in
my place, contemplated our hounds for
some seconds.
“And are these the notorious Hare-
'em Scare-'ems?” he inquired.
I nodded, “Yessir; absolutely the
one and only pack of harriers opera-
ting in the war zone. Guaranteed gun-
broke, shell-shocked, shrapnel-pitted
and bullet-bitten.”
Algy sniffed. “What's that big brute
over in the corner, he of the crumpled
face and barbéd smile 2 Looks like a
bloodhound.” -
“Is a bloodhound,” said Albert
Edward. “If you don't believe me
step inside and behave like raw rump
steak for a moment.”
Algy pointed with his cane. “And
that creature industriously delousing
itself 2 That's a wolf, of course 2 " .
“Its wolfery is only skin-deep,” said
I. “A grey gander all but annihilated
it yesterday. In my opinion it's a shee
in wolf's clothing.” - -
Algy wagged his cane, indicating the
remaining two couples.
“And these? What breed would you
call them 2" -
Albert Edward grunted. “You could
call them any breed you like and be
partly right. We've named them ‘The
Maconochies,' which, being inter-
preted, meaneth a little of everything.”
“And how many hares have you
killed 2 "Algy inquired.
“We haven't exactly killed any as
yet,” said I, “but we've put the breeze
up 'em; their moral is very low.”
“Well, my bold Nimrods,” said Algy,
“I'm sorry to say the game is up.”
“What do you mean by “game’?”
objected Albert Edward. “I’ve told
you before that this is a serious attempt
to avert a plague of rodents. Why, in
Australia. I've seen n 1

Albert Edward interrupted. “I know

How it reminds us of our young days

cousin of Wellington remarked to us how

Algy cut off the flow and continued
with his piece. “He said to me, “God

they maintain that they are doing good
work by averting a threatened plague

proved very detrimental to the Anti-

“‘Threatened plague of grand-

“They're enjoying themselves, that's
what they're doing—having a splendid

bird up to have a peep at the War.
Good-byee.”
Algy tripped daintily off home again,
twirling his cane and whistling cheer-
fully. Sourly we watched him depart.
“I believe that youth positively revels
in spreading gloom,” Albert Edward
growled. “Oh, well, I suppose we'll
have to get rid of the dogs now.

“But do you think they'll go?” I
asked. “We've been feeding 'em oc-

said Albert Edward; “once they sniff

about us.”

leased our pack from the hen-house for
the last time. They immediately gave
chase to an errant tabby kitten, which
threw off a noise like many siphons

a buck hare, right from under our feet,

by the Maconochies and the blood-
hound. Thrice the hare turned clear
and squatted, but, thanks to the blood
dog's infallible nose, he was ousted each
time and pushed on, failing visibly. He
made a sharp curve towards the wind-
mill, and Albert Edward and I topped
the miller's fence in time to see the
Maconochies roll him over among the
weeds. We also saw something on the
highway behind the mill which we had
not previously noticed, namely a grey
Limousine. On a fallen tree by the
wayside sat the General, his face as
highly-coloured as his hat. Towards
us down the garden-path tripped Algy,
twirling his cane and whistling cheerily.
Albert Edward groaned.
“Something in the demeanour of yon
youth tells me he beareth our death-
warrants. Here, you hold the horses
while I feed the guillotine. This is by
far, far the best thing that I have ever
done.”
He slung me his reins and tottered
to his doom. I watched him approach
within five yards of the old man when
a strange thing happened. The General
suddenly uttered a loud cry and, leap-
ing to his feet, commenced to dance
up and down the road, tearing and
belabouring himself and swearing so
outrageously that I had difficulty in
holding the horses. His chauffeur and
Algy rushed to his side, and they and
Albert Edward grouped in a sympa-
thetic circle while he danced and raved
and beat himself in their midst. Pre-
sently the air seemed to be full of flying
tunics, shirts, camisoles, etc., and a
second later I beheld the extraordi-
nary spectacle of a Lieutenant-General
dancing practically nude (excepting for
his cap and boots) in the middle of a
French highway, while two subalterns
and a private smacked him all over,
and most heartily. For nearly a minute
it continued, and then he seemed to get
himself under control and was led away
by Algy to his car, the chauffeur fol-
lowing, retrieving apparel off trees and
bushes. Albert Edward, one quivering
Smirk, wobbled up and took his reins.
“By Jove! saved again. He can't
very well bite the hand that spanked
him, can he ”’’
“But what on earth was the mat-
ter?” I asked. “A fit, religious mania,
a penance—what?”
Albert Edward chuckled. “He sat on
a wasp's nest. They worked through
his clothes and got busy.” PATLANDER.

CoNVERSATION ON CHAPTER XCI.
George. Is it true that in this reign
there were still spoken plays, with live
actors on the stage 2 .
Mrs. M. Yes. Although the cinema
or film play had already come into
vogue, a large number of theatres were
still employed in the representation of
plays in which real men and women
appeared and conversed on the stage,
sometimes indulging in long speeches
or even sermons, as in the plays of
SHAw.
Richard. How fatiguing it must have
been to listen and look at the same time!
Mrs. M. Yes; and think of the strain
on these poor actors and actresses, who
had to learn all these long speeches by
heart. Sometimes they forgot their
words and had to invent others, or
were prompted by a man who stood
at the side of the stage.
George. I wonder the audience could
ut up with such absurdities.
Mrs. M. Strange to say there never
was a time in which actors and act-
resses were held in higher honour.
Things indeed went so far that a Bill
was introduced into Parliament pro-
posing that all actors over forty-five
should be knighted and eventually
buried in Westminster Abbey. It was
rejected by a small majority; but even
after that a famous comic actor was
raised to the peerage. On the other
hand I believe that only two or three
hundred writers of spoken plays were
made Knights of the British Empire.
Mary. Was not grandfather one of
those knights?
Mrs. M. No, my dear; but he had a
terribly narrow escape when he was
employed at the Ministry of Influenza,
and had to be very careful for a long
time afterwards.
Richard. Tell us something more
about the abolition of Latin in schools.
Mrs. M. It was the immediate result
of a general strike, but the primary
cause was the chaos produced by the
attempt to introduce the new pronuncia-
tion. Towards the end of the nine-
teenth century a band of scholars put
forward a plan for pronouncing Latin,
not like English, but partly like Italian,
partly on principles of their own. It
was taken up with enthusiasm by some
headmasters and nominally enforced at ||
all the public schools. But when, after
forty years, no uniformity was arrived at,
while the universities were half-hearted
and the public indifferent, the apostles
of efficiency, science and modern lan-
guages turned this confusion to the
best account in their campaign against
the Classics; and, as you know, it is
now a punishable offence to indulge in
a Latin quotation in public. - -
Richard. All the same I'd rather
learn Latin than German any day.
Didn't you tell us that the great QUEEN
ELIZABETH used to speak and write
Latin fluently 2
Mrs. M. That is true; but QUEEN
ELIZABETH, though a remarkable wo-
man, was not a model to follow in every
way. For example, as I think I told
you, at her death more than three
thousand different dresses were found
in her wardrobes.
Mary. Oh, Mamma, how splendid
Why, I don't suppose Papa has more
than thirty pairs of trousers.
Mrs. M. Your supposition is prob-
ably correct, but as he will be soon
home to tea you will be able to verify
it by inquiry and possibly inspection.

FROM A Q.M.A.A.C. FILE.
I.
To Area Controller, Q.M.A.A.C.
From Assistant Administrator B.Muffit,
Camp 9., B.E.F.
I thought I would like to write and
ask if I could have promotion, please.
I have been in the Q.M.A.A.C. for
four months now, and my sister, who
joined up after me, is nearly at the top
of the “Wrens.”
II. -
To Chief Controller Q.M.A.A.C., G.H.Q.
I'rom Area Controller.
Attached application passed to you,
please, for favour of kind consideration
and any action that may be necessary.
Miss Muffit is much liked by her
workers and almost invariably remem-
bers her ration indents.
III.
To Area Controller, Q.M.A.A.C.
From Chief Controller, G.II.Q.
It is pointed out for information that
applications for promotion from As-
sistant Administrators cannot be con-
sidered unless very strongly endorsed
by their Area Controllers.
Controllers, when submitting a con-
fidential report on an Administrator,
will bear in mind that an arresting
style of diction may secure a favour-
able answer where stereotyped phrase
ology might be overlooked. -

To Chief Controller Q.M.A.A.C., G.H.Q.
From Area Controller. -
I beg to report as follows on Miss
Muffit, A.A.:—This official has a most
winsome personality, Her beauty of
characteris equalled though not excelled
by the rigour of her military discipline.
Whether darning her Controller's stock-
ings or awarding one week's C.B. to a
worker who has thoughtlessly worn a
forewoman's collar, she is in her ele-
ment. She is alike the idol of, officers
and workers.
Inoculation and vaccination, 30/5/18
Arrival in France . . . . 5/6/18
Chest measurement . 30 ins.
Complexion fair, mole on left ear.
Temperament grave to gay.
I can cordially recommend this official
for promotion to the rank of Unit Ad-
ministrator. No Controller requiring a
capable Administrator to run a camp
or advise her in the management of her
area should fail to secure Miss Muffit.
No responsibility too large and no de-
tail too small for this remarkable girl.
As a brilliant conversationalist in a
motor-car or a charming companion at
the tea-table she is unrivalled. Will
entertain Staff Officers and save gramo-
phone records.
A superb watch-dog and keen mouser.

Private. I cannot admit your con-
clusion, Sir. The private's responsi-
bilities being less, he should be the
more rigorous in the execution of what
duties he has.
Officer. But that surely robs rank of
its real meaning? If those who have
rank cannot carry out the responsi-
bilities which their rank entails, they
should surrender it. The higher obli-
gations imposed upon them should
make them more efficient in everything
they undertake.
Private. Sir, I have never heard the
responsibility of rank more nobly de-
scribed. But I still maintain that in
this case, where the private takes the
initiative—a rare privilege of which he
should make the fullest use—it is his
duty to be peculiarly vigilant and so
give his superior a reminder, as it were,
of his part.
Officer. A liberal and admirable inter-
pretation of your position. But is it
not the officer's duty to be ready to
check or admonish those who fail in
their duty 2
Private (smiling). Sir, you have the
last word, and I confess myself con-
vinced. I sincerely beg your pardon
for my initial mistake in begging your
pardon.
Officer. No; it was your altruistic
action which provoked this so interest-
ing discussion, in which I for one have
learned much.
Private. Sir, and I too. Your talk
has been not only instructive, but stimu-
lating in the best sense.
Officer. We part with mutual esteem.
Private. I am honoured to agree, Sir.

separate ways.

ANOTHER CONSCIENTIOUS
“AND WHAT WAS YOUR REASON FOR DESERTING YOUR WIFE 2"
OBJECTOR.
“RELIGIOUS MOTIVES, SIR. SHE WAS MAKING AN IDol of ME.”
THE RETROGRESSION OF THE G.Q.M.S.
THE Q.M.S. of our company has had
a narrow escape of becoming that un-
fortunate anomaly, a Quartermaster-
Sergeant with a conscience, which is
not the same thing as a conscientious
Quartermaster-Sergeant. In fact the
two are incompatible.
In civil life our C.Q.M.S. occupied a
responsible position in a firm whose
name was a synonym for unimpeach-
able integrity. To this he added the
hallmark of Scottish respectability by
mounting on Sundays an austere guard
over the collection plate. To such a
man the slightest deviation from the
most rigid paths of honesty was as
black a crime as murder. Even his
income-tax returns were correct. But
when in the course of his military
career he put a crown over his three
stripes he turned over a new leaf and
doped his conscience for the duration of
his Quartermaster-Sergeantship, with
the result that the Company lacked for
nothing, which is the finest testimonial
any C.G.M.S. can receive.
But he had one weakness. Being a
Scotsman, he had all the taste for
theological discussion characteristic of
the race. The other day he met a fel-
low Scot, a Padre. (Mark the advance
of Nemesis.) He indulged his craving
with disastrous consequences, for the
Padre asked what I consider, in view
of the said crown and three stripes,
to be a very tactless question: “Have
you become a better man since you
joined the Army 2”
And away in the depths of him the
C.Q.M.S. heard a sigh as of a heavy
sleeper that awakes. His conscience
had stirred at last. Thereafter his life
became a burden to him. The old
scruples about meum and tuum had
reasserted their dominion. No longer
did he march virtuously from the ration
dump with a bag of raisins under his
tin hat and a “buckshee” cheese in his
greatcoat pocket.
nerve failed him, and he that had
successfully removed a side of mutton
without the twinkle of an eyelash was
ignominiously caught annexing a loaf.
For the first time in its existence the
unit lacked fresh meat and had to live
on bully. There was murmuring among
the populace and sorrow in the eye of
the storeman.
Then came the crisis; there was no
coal for the Officers' Mess. So the C.O.
said to me, “Look here, McFarlane,
you're another of these argumentative
Scotsmen. Go and see what you can
do.”
Off to the stores I went. “Well,
|C.Q.M.S., what have you salved to-
day?” He groaned aloud in reply.
And as my eyes wandered around the
stores and alighted in succession on two
tents (complete with poles), one tar-
paulin, three trench covers, one push
cycle, two signalling lamps, one tele.
Worst of all, his
phone apparatus, two hand-carts, three
wheelbarrows and other unconsidered
trifles too numerous to mention—all,
strangely enough, omitted in the Mobil-
ization Store Table, I echoed his groan.
Nevertheless I launched into an
eloquent appeal. I justified his past
“winnings” on the grounds of imme-
morial custom, the reluctance of our
own particular High Panjandrum to
authorise issues, the saving of paper in
dispensing with indent forms, the com-
fort and welfare of the troops.
All to no purpose. His deep-rooted
logical faculty made hay of my fondest
fallacies and reduced my sophistic edi-
fices to a heap of ramshackle premises.
Next morning I met the C.Q.M.S.
returning from the dump. From his
eyes there gleamed the ancient preda-
tory instinct. In his right hand he was
bearing flour, that scarce substance
beloved of Army cooks.
“Was it my eloquence?” I asked.
“No, Sir; it was a dream I had last
night. I was tied to a stake in the
middle of the dump. All the other
Quartermaster-Sergeants were taking
what they wanted till at last I was left
with one biscuit and half a tin of bully
for the whole company. I woke up in
a cold sweat. To-day, when I went
down to the dump, there was flour, and
between that and my dream . . .”
“What about the Padre 2 " I asked
maliciously.
The C.Q.M.S. saluted and retired

smartly. But as he went off I heard
him consign the reverend gentleman to
a most unclerical destination. I excused
him, however; he was busy. There
was a derelict Ford round the corner.
THE ROUT OF SCENERY.
IT has ever been the habit of people
returned from their holidays to tell
other people about them, not excluding
those who are obviously not in the
least interested. This is one of the
oldest of human foibles; it prevailed, I
am sure, in the Stone Age; it will still
prevail when everyone keeps his own
aeroplane. But where once it was the
custom to lay emphasis on the natural
beauties or advantages of their chosen
spot there is now a change.
“You have no idea,” they used to
say, even if you assured them you had
yourself been there often—“you've no
idea of the charm of the place.”
And then they would describe the
charm. They would tell you of walks
they had discovered, all tiresomely
familiar to you, and points from which
you get such a magnificent view.
“There's nothing like it, I swear.
Hundreds of square miles all spread
out at one's feet, don't you know, and
oh, the purple distance' "
Or it would be a little bay some-
where on the coast, where the bathing
was better than anyone ever dreamed
of. Splendid sands for the children
too. They would tell you about this
until you were sick with weariness:
the blue blue sea, the gulls and cor-
morants, the hauls of fish, the amazing
healthiness and privacy of it all. “No
bathing machines, you know. You just
undressed behind a rock. And every-
one so jolly—just like one family
party.”
And then “Don’t you love a remote
retired place, without the usual crowd?”
they would say. “I don't mind telling
you where it is, but for Heaven's sake
don't let anyone else know about it or
it will be ruined.”
That is how they used to talk, the
private cove sojourners, very likely add-
ing something about the ease with
which they always managed to get on
with the natives. “But then, of course,
I have rather luck in such ways. I
don't know what it is about me, but I
always get on with country people.”
That was how it used to be. But
now I know at least a dozen
men who have discovered just such
secluded paradises this year, alone or
with their families, and they have all
adopted a new tone. The bathing was
as perfect as ever; they were as apt as
ever in fraternising with the humble
folk; the sea was blue, the ozone
something terrific, just as usual, but
they have said nothing about it. All
their enthusiasm has been for the
meals. “The great thing”—they have
all employed these words—“the great
thing is we got all we wanted to eat.
No nonsense about shortage at all.”
Take, again, the Lakes. A friend
returning from the Lakes five years
ago would be ecstatic about their
solemn grandeur, alternating with the
most tender sweetness. Very likely he
would quote WoRDsworth ; without
the slightest doubt he would mention
him. And poor HARTLEY Col.BRIDGE.
Helvellyn would come in for a few ad-
jectives as a matter of course—“The
noble old fellow, and oh, the dark depths
of Windermere ! ”
I met a man the other day whom I
had not seen since July, and the in-

evitable occurred. Before I had a chance
to tell him where I had been for my
holidays he was all over me.
“Ah,” he said, “if you take my
advice you'll go to the Lakes. Ever
been there? They're wonderful. No
rationing at all. I assure you we
stayed, my wife and I, for six weeks
all about the place, and no one bothered
us for coupons or anything else. Meat
twice a day. I shall never forget the
Lakes, never.”
The Trossachs used in the old days
to tax the superlatives as much if not
more than any holiday district in the
British Isles, not excepting Killarney,
Miller's Dale or the Lakes themselves.
And the Trossachs were not neglected
this past summer. But the one ac-
quaintance of mine who had been there
could talk only of an hotel where he
had struck up such an intimacy with
the manager that he had brought away
with him six bottles of pre-war whisky.
“Ah!” he said, “Scotland for me
every time. It's a grand country. I
had no notion before that the Trossachs
were anything but just scenery and
tourists. I never expected to find a
friend there. Who says the Scotch are
niggardly, ungenerous? It's a lie. I
mean to go to the Trossachs every year.”
There is the converse too. I met the
other day a family who had been to
Devonshire for the first time—on Dart-
moor—and were disappointed with it.
Greatly overrated, they thought it.
“But the wildness of it,” I said, “the
largeness! Those miles of heather! The
height and openness and freedom '''
No, they didn't care for it. No doubt
there was a certain spaciousness, a
certain rugged beauty; but—well, they
had been disappointed.
“And everything is so pure there,”
I said—“the air, the rivulets, the
cream.”

was it. Where was the cream 2 They
had always heard that Devonshire
cream was to be had at every farm-

F. I must say your temper's in a shocking state. Really
it isn't manly of you to give way to your bad humour like
that. You've had a good time too. You've worn hundreds
of uniforms; you've made thousands of speeches; you've
been photographed and painted in every possible attitude
of ferocity, and now, just because you can't get your own
way about the armistice, you're making yourself impossible
—quite impossible. If you don't give up glaring at me I
shall ring the bell. -
The K. Stop babbling ! You can't feel as I do the shame
of being foiled. Your Bulgarians asked for an armistice
and got it immediately. I asked for one and everybody
instantly suspects a trap, and even the infernal Americans
declare that they're not going to step into my parlour.
Curse the Americans ! They might just as well call me a
spider right out. -
F. If you ever think of turning into a spider, please let
me know, so that I may add you to my collection. There
are some moths in that collection that are worth hundreds
of pounds. I've got them safely away to Vienna; and that
reminds me—our young ally on the Danube is not very
staunch, is he? He'll be wanting an armistice of his own
next, and poor old Turkey is on the very edge of the preci-
pice. One touch and over he goes.
The K. And yet it all seemed to be going splendidly.
The British and the French were retreating. I had sent
my men into battle with some of my best words ringing in
their ears. And then suddenly everything turned upside
down, and our fellows began to go back steadily. I felt—
F. Yes, I know that feeling well. One retreats and one
loses men and guns, and more guns and more men. Nothing
seems to help, and the issuing of communiqués becomes
more and more difficult. - -
The K. Yes, that's how it feels. And then you try all
the best tricks. You say your prayers and call on God to
help you, but he is inattentive, is our good old German
God, and he piles up disaster on, disaster against you; and
to crown all one gets entangled with a thing like this
(pointing to FERDINAND). 2 * * * ,
F. You appear to be annoyed. But after all you must
admit that you've brought the whole thing entirely on
yourself. You wanted the War and you've got it. You
wanted it big and you've got it bigger than you expected.
Now that you've caused an unparalleled waste of blood and
treasure you begin to whine, and want to have peace on
your own terms. Now that's silly of you. Do you suppose
you've only got to wave your hand and everything will be
as it was before? Take care of yourself, my fine fellow.
You're much nearer to getting the boot, and if you once
begin to go there'll be very few who will try to call you
back.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To say that I snatch a fearful joy from the work of Miss
E. M. DELAFIELD is becoming an inadequate phrase. After
reading her second book I remember writing (or perhaps
only thinking) of the apprehension that must exist in
certain feminine breasts as to the victim of her next
satirical shafts. They have now fallen over a rather wider
area than before, but with execution equally deadly. The
Pelicans (HEINEMANN) is a novel about families; and the
effect of it is to inclease a resemblance, already obvious,
between the methods of Miss DELAFIELD and JANE AUSTEN.
There are two chief groups in the tale, that of Pensevern,
consisting of Nina Severing, a widow, rich, appealing, a
“popular” composer, and her son Morris; and that of the
neighbouring house of Porthlew, where dwelt Bertha Tre-
gaskis with her husband, her companion and the two
orphan girls to whom she had made herself guardian. I
am inclined to consider Bertha the best yet of Miss DELA-
FIELD's social satires. A type of the energetic and capa-
ble manager, unwearied in benevolent and devastating
activities, beneath whose “understanding" sympathy the
souls of the sensitive shrivel like scorched leaves, the por-
trait lives amazingly. The scenes between her and Nina
are the most exhilarating fun. Altogether on a different
plane are the two girls whom, all unconsciously and kindly,
Bertha victimises—Rosamund, with her passion of pro-
tective love for her younger sister, and Frances, torn between
earthly and spiritual claims. The almost terribly poignant
chapters of the latter's final sacrifice gave me an entirely
new view of Miss DELAFIELD's art, revealing her as an
emotional writer of unexpected power. Perhaps this part
of the tale is something out of key with the satiric comedy
of the rest; but it certainly adds to the interest and expec-
tation with which I shall watch the future of its author.
Apart from the Americans of HENRY JAMES and W. D.
Howells—colourless Europeanised creatures, racy not of
the soil but of the lobbies of cosmopolitan pensions—
the modern American types best known to the general
English reader are Cyrus K. Porkdollar of Scrougeville,
Pa., and Cactus Pete of Centipede, Arizona. This does not
in itself explain why an atmosphere of unsubstantiality
pervades The Hunter (PUTNAM), since the simple country
people of the Northern Middle-West are certainly not less
susceptible of delineation than the cow-puncher and the
multi-millionaire. We tell ourselves that men and women
are much the same the world over and that the rustic
youths and maidens of Wisconsin could never be so simple
and unsophisticated and at the same time so supremely
aware of the things that are noble and beautiful in life as
are Louis Buttress and Silvia Lake. Then we realise that
our mystification is due to the fact that Mr. WATSON DYKE

has done something rather surprisingly original: instead of
describing the physical nature and experiences of his
characters and leaving us to take their states of mind for
granted, he has given us their thoughts alone, leaving us to
clothe them with individuality, to build about them suitable
dwellings of flesh and an appropriate environment. And
the reader familiar only with Porkdollars and Cactus Petes
is quite unable to guess in what appropriate tenements of
clay these spiritual entities should be housed. Yet The
Hunter is a very simple story and concerns only the love-
affairs of a few simple-minded young people. And if they
seem a trifle transcendental we must bear in mind that while
England has no uneducated idealists America has fifty
million.
There is a delightful and a pathetic quality about Glen-

comes to his own home and his own people, full of pride

FELLOW."
If Mr. MAHONEY did not occasionally compel a smile by
his peculiar use of words I should have found Interned in
Germany (SAMPson Low) almost intolerably depressing.
Yet the account which he gives of the sufferings of mind
and body which he and his fellow-prisoners endured in the
camp at Ruhleben—he was there for over a year—is a tem-
perate one. The story of their heroic struggle against the
cruel conditions imposed on them is the only relief to be
found in a distressing tale. Intermittent sparks of kindness
did fly from the officials, but the general impression Mr.
MAHONEY gives is one of petty tyranny. Yet he is not so
angry with his German guards as with certain British-born
prisoners, who had lived so long in Germany that they had
become disloyal to the land of their birth. These men,
properly known as P.G.'s, which is short for something not
much longer, earned, I am glad to say, the contempt both of

the loyal prisoners and of the Huns. To read this book is
to tº. the great efforts which the American Ambassador
made to improve the conditions of life at Ruhleben, and in
his unavoidable absence Mr. MAHONEY does useful work in
drawing attention once more to the pitiful needs of those
who are still enduring captivity in this camp.
I question whether Miss PEGGY WEBLING was altogether
well advised to call her new story In Our Street (HUTCHIN-
son), a title from which I personally expected a study of
topographical peculiarities; whereas really the things
that happened to the dwelkers in Miss WEBLING's street
might have happened to them anywhere else, given an
atmosphere sufficiently bracing. As it was there must
have been more than a touch of melodrama in the climate
of the street, since only thus can I explain the behaviour of
the chief characters—the spiritualist fanatic Vakeel; his
martyred wife; the girl Lily, who was to have been his
second victim, and the man who married her to prevent
Miss WEBLING presents all these characters as they
appeared to a solitary
woman, who tells the
tale in the first person,
save for certain scenes
which, as she could not
possibly have assisted
at them, have to be
reported indirectly, a
somewhat awkward
change, though benefi-
cial as regards pace,
the very leisurely style
of the first part having
needlessly retarded the
action. Another defect
is the absence of any
adequate motive for
Dumaresque's sacrifice
of his own happiness.
After all, even in the
primitive Victorian
ages there must, I
fancy, have been ways
--------- - - – of stopping a spiritual-
istic bully less drastic than that of marrying his medium.
But of course it turned out all right in the end, though
I should like to assure the publishers that their antici-
pation that this end would find me “breathless” was
falsified by the event. In Our Street is a pleasant and
entertaining story, but he who runs may read it without
undue strain on the lungs.

FOR THE APOSTLES OF “NO HUMILIATION.”
[Certain people have proclaimed their opinion that the German
nation ought not to be humiliated.]
RUMoURs arrive as thick as swarming bees;
Our evening rags announce with raucous clamour
The latest wire, the semi-final wheeze
Transmitted by the fertile Rotterdammer,
Giving a local version
Of WILLIAM Two's spontaneous dispersion.
They leave me cold. I care not how he pays -
The heavy debt his deeds of wanton fury owe—
Whether he puts his orb to bed, or stays
On exhibition like an antique curio;
The reckoning we charge
Has to be settled by the Hun at large.
Here and elsewhere his advocates impute
Innocence to the Bosch—a gentle creature,
Too prone perhaps to lick the tyrant's boot,
But otherwise without a vicious feature;
They'd have our wrath abated;
Poor child, “he must not be humiliated.”
Why not ? Against his army's bestial crimes
He never lifted one protesting finger;
The wrongs of Belgium drew his jocund rhymes;
Over the Hymn of Hate he loved to linger,
Pressing the forte pedal,
And wore—for luck—the Lusitania medal.
He took a holiday for children slain,
And butchered women set his flags a-flutter;
Our drowning anguish served for light refrain
To beery patriots homing down the gutter;
On prisoners he spat,
The helpless ones, and thanked his Gott for that.
Had he but fought as decent nations fight,
Clean-handed, then we must have spared his honour;
But now, if Germany goes down in night,
'Tis he, not we, that puts that shame upon her,
Shame not of mere defeat,
But such that never our hands again can meet.
Why should his pride of race be spared a fall?
Let him go humble all his days for sentence.
Why pity him as just a Kaiser's thrall,
This beast at heart—though fear may fake repent-
ance 2
For me, when all is said,
I save my pity for our murdered dead.

Yvon NE.
Yvonne was given to the Lieutenant by a dear old lady
who said she was sure sailors would be kind to her and
understand her little ways, and besides it would be so nice
for us to have a fresh egg for breakfast sometimes when
out on that dreadful North Sea. She also gave a copy of
CHRISTINA RossETTI's poems to the Skipper, and a pair of
knitted mittens to the gunner and myself. The crew were
rather jealous of the Skipper—they said his Rossetti was
just a handy size for folding a jean collar on, and not the
slightest use to anyone in square rig.
Yvonne took to a seafaring life like a tank to a barbed
wire entanglement. She was a little awkward at first and
shy at walking on the deck in a swell if any of us were
looking, but she soon found her sea legs and developed a
rolling gait that would have graced the carriage of an
Admiral of the Fleet. The third hand said she was a cross
between a silver wyandotte and a pouter pigeon, but that
was before we came to know and love her; besides, he
makes jokes like that. She lived in a little coop under the
whaleback, secure from those unpleasantnesses of weather
that sometimes make one think of the Dogger Bank as
a good place to send strike leaders to who cannot decide
just how much more they ought to have to compensate for
the hardships of life on the home front. She had the
trimmer for her batman. -
The only member of the crew who showed unwillingness
to accept. Yvonne as a shipmate was the Silent Menace,
the ship's dog. The Silent Menace is a taciturn unaffable
misogynist, and Yvonne is nothing if not the soul of socia-
bility. I think she got on his nerves a little. A.
He signified his disapproval as soon as ever she came
aboard by deliberately turning his back on her and eating
a piece of coal. He always eats coal when anything annoys
him—he does it to show how scornful he is. -
“We'll have trouble with that Menace,” said the Skipper;
“he's just eaten a lump of coal as big as a walnut without
chewing it.” He went to the bridge looking worried.
I don't think Yvonne felt very fit the first day or two at
sea, but one fine afternoon she ventured out on deck for a
look round and a chat. The Silent Menace was sleeping
in the sun, his head reposing on a coil of rope; perhaps he
was dreaming of his care-free puppyhood, before life had
taught him its bitter lessons, for his expression was almost
benign. Yvonne, pecking at imaginary dainties on the
deck, edged towards him, wishful for a little society. The
Menace slumbered on. At last Yvonne, despairing of
attracting his attention through the medium of conven-
tional clucks, tip-toed up and audaciously pecked the
extreme tip of his tail as it lay supine on the deck. The
Menace sprang into the air as though he had been electro-
cuted, with a sharp yelp of surprise. For a moment I
believe he thought he had been torpedoed, for he gazed
fiercely at the surrounding sea with bristling spine. Then
suddenly he saw Yvonne, who had stepped away and was
glancing archly at him over her shoulder. The expression
of rage and mortification that convulsed his features was
pathetic to see. He gave Yvonne one glare of his solitary
eye and with a brave effort at dignified indifference walked
aſt. If looks could kill, Yvonne would never have laid
another egg.
After that the atmosphere was a trifle strained. The
Menace ate so much coal that the Chief Engineer said
something would have to be done or the bunkers would
give out before we could make harbour. The only person
who seemed unconscious of the awkwardness of the situa-
tion was the cause of the whole trouble, Yvonne herself.
She made friends with everyone, but the Skipper was her
special favourite, and she insisted on laying in his sou'-
wester. She as good as said that if she couldn't have that
for a nest she wouldn't lay at all, so there. She was really
irresistible; with the exception of the Silent Menace we
were her slaves to a man. The Steward spent half-an-
hour one morning following her about the deck on his
hands and knees, trying to coax her to eat a piece of bacon
rind which he said he'd cooked specially for her breakfast.
But the Menace was unbending ; he treated Yvonne as
though she did not exist. She beset him with her most
guileful charms, but in vain; it seemed as though he would
remain a rebel to the end.
But we had yet to learn the limit of Yvonne's powers.
She had failed to beguile him by kindness and amiability;
even the most alluring of glad eyes had left him unre.
There was still one more appeal. One morning
sponsive.

down on the other side, right on to the back of the Silent
Menace, who was walking moodily in the direction of the
galley. ſ
“Oh,” ejaculated Yvonne, or a cluck to that effect.
The Menace stared at her disgustedly, turned his back
and walked off in the opposite direction, the picture of out-
raged dignity. Yvonne recovered herself, grimaced at the
Mate, then, picking up a small piece of coal in her beak, she
took it and laid it at the Menace's feet. ' -
“Eat it,” she practically said. º -
For a brief space there was a conflict of emotions within
him, and then some dormant long-suppressed sense of
humour gained the mastery; with an abashed grin he
looked at Yvonne, and, wonder of wonders, gave a short
convulsive wag of his tail. He had capitulated."
That same afternoon the Skipper called me to him.
“Look there,” he said: “if that don't beat everything!”
Peeping round the corner of the deckhouse I beheld the
Silent Menace recumbent on an outspread duffel coat, and
by his side, chattering away most intimately, sat Yvonne.
Just then the Menace caught sight of us watching him
and, overcome with confusion, he hid his face between his
forepaws.
Both the Skipper and I are absolutely convinced that he
blushed to the very tips of his ragged war-worn ears.

Taxi-drivers are so much like human beings that it takes
an expert to tell the difference.
Caught young, they are sometimes so tame that they will

is a good plan to walk up behind it. If you approach it
from the front you are apt to frighten. the timid thing

Some people recommend the big-game hunter's way of
staring the object straight in the eyes. Should he attempt
to jump the cab at you, step aside smartly.
Another method is to wait till the cab is nearly level
with you and then take a run and hurl yourself through
the window. . Seat yourself at once and pretend that you
have been there all the time.
Should the driver charge you largely in excess of his legal
fare, tell him that you have nothing less than a five-pound
note with you. If you have an honest face and speak kindly
he will probably accept this amount.
If upon being offered the legal ſare the driver should
show the white of his eyes and set back his ears at a dan-
gerous angle it is well to send for an interpreter to take
down what he says, to be used in evidence at your inquest.

to count his scholarship 2 A first in

cellor's Prize Poem, President of the
Union, stroke of his boat, Scholar of
this college, Fellow of that—what need
to catalogue all this, for was he not
to the world the Penstimman ; but to
us, most emphatically and ecstatically,
our Penstimman 2
That he was not in the Army at the
outbreak of war is to be put at the
door of those who compose medical
categories. But in 1918 by some good
fortune and a deal of lying he appeared
on the battle - fields of Flanders as
0567834 Lance-Corporal Penstimman.
Soon after his arrival at the Front
came the establishment of a scheme of
educational training among the troops.
An energetic Education Officer fished
Penstimman out of the Sergeants' Mess
(whither sheer force of character had
brought him) and set him to work to
lecture to the Brigade.
You remember Penstimman in the
old days? - - --
There was but one inevitable result.
All interest centred in Penstimman.
His lectures were packed to suffoca-
tion, not only with men but also with
officers; and they would even walk
miles from neighbouring formations to
listen to the one and only Lance-
Corporal Penstimman.
More than this, he became a topic
in the Mess.
Now the Brigadier was of the old
school. He didn't believe in educa-
tion ; not he “What was this fellow
called — Penstimman 2'' He'd never
heard the name, anyhow; he would be
blanked if he had ' And blanked very
effectually he was, as four-fifths of the
conversation in Mess was about Pen-
stimman and his lectures. But the
more the General hardened his heart
the greater grew the desire within him
to hear the great Penstimman—our
Penstimman, as the Brigade had begun
to call him.
Now by the decree of Fate it hap-
pened that a complete soldier's kit had
been left in the General's office for
exhibition next day to a visitor from
an Allied Army; the temptation was
too great and the Brigadier fell.
That night a soldier in a uniform too
large for him slunk into the shadow at
the end of the hut, and the General
listened to Penstimman delivering a
lecture on “Currency,” as enthralling
as any tale from the Arabian Nights.
The Brigadier received the following
note next morning:— -
DEAR GENERAL,~I shall always be
delighted to see you at my classes in
whatever rank you choose to come.
But if you come again in the rank of
a private I must insist, in the interest
of discipline, that you wear your ban-
dolier over the left and not the right
shoulder. Yours obediently,
0567834 L/C PENSTIMMAN.
The General is now a disciple of
Penstimman—as we all are. For with
all his fierceness the Brigadier is a
white man.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(October 23, 1918.
THE MUD LARKS.
A GENERous foe, the soul of chivalry,
I am always ready to admit that the
Bosch has many good points. For
instance, he is—er–er—oh, well, I
can't think of any particular good point
just for the moment. On the other
hand it must be admitted that he has
his bad ones also, and one of these is
that he cannot stand success; he is the
world's worst winner. - -
Never does he pull off one of thes
“victorious retreats" of his but he
needs must spoil the effeet by leaving
behind all sorts of puerile booby traps,
butter-slides, etc., for the annoyance
of the on sweeping vanquished, dis-
playing a state of mind which is
usually slippered out of one at a dame
• school. -
Most of his practical jokes (you al-
ready know something about then), as
another warrior has been writing on
this pleasant theme in Mr. Punch's
pages) are of the fifth of November
order and detonate by means of a neat
arrangement of springs, wire and acid
contained in a small metal cylinder.
You open a door and the attached
house blows away all round it, leaving
the door in your damaged hand. You
step on a duckboard; something goes
bang ! and the duckboard ups and hits
you for a boundary to leg– and so on,
all kinds of diversions. -
Of course you don't really open doors
and prance on duckboards; that 's
only what he (Jerry) in his simple
faith imagines you will do. In reality
you revive memories of the days when
as a small boy you tied trip-strings in
dark passages and balanced water-jugs
on door-tops; and all the Bosch's
elementary parlour-tricks immediately
become revealed unto you.
Not long ago the Hun, thirsting for
yet more imperishable laurels, made a
sudden masterly manoeuvre towards
the East. Our amateur Staff instantly
fell into the trap, and when battle
joined again we found we had. been
lured twenty miles nearer Germany.
The Hun had not left things very
comfortable for us; most of the cover
| had been blown up, and there was the
usual generous provision of booby-traps
lying about dumbly pleading to be
touched off. However, we sheltered in
odd holes and corners, scrounged about
for what we could “ souvenir '' and
made ourselves as snug as possible.
It was while riding out alone on
one of these souveniring expeditions
that our William came upon a chaff-
cutter standing in what had once been
the stable yard of what had once been
a château. Now to a mounted unit a
chaff-cutter is a thing of incredible
value. It is to us what a mincing-
machine is to the frugal housewife.
Our own cutter was with the baggage,
miles away in the rear, and likely to
remain there.
William slipped off his horse and
approached the thing gingerly. It was
a Bosch engine, evidently quite new
and in excellent trim. This was alto-
gether too good to be true; there must
be a catch somewhere. William with-
drew twenty yards and hurled a brick
at it—two, three, four bricks. Nothing
happened. He approached again and,
tying one end of a wrecked telephone
wire to it, retired behind a heap of
rubble and tugged. -
The chaff-cutter rocked to and fro
and finally fell over on its side without
anything untoward occurring. William,
wiping beads from his brow, came out
of cover. There was no catch in it
after all. It was a perfectly genuine
bit of treasure - trove. The Skipper
would pat his curly head, say “Good
boy,” and exalt him above all the other
subalterns. Bon—very bon 1
But how to get it home 2 For you
cannot carry full-grown chaff cutters
about in your breeches pockets. For
one thing it spoils the set of your pants.
He must get a limber. Yes, but how 2
The country was quick with other
cavalrymen all in the souvenir busi-
ness. If he left the chaff-cutter in
order to fetch a limber, one of them
would be sure to snap it up. On the
other hand, if he waited for a limber to
come trotting up of its own sweet will
he might conceivably wait for the rest
of the War. Limbers (G.S. Mule) are
not fairy coaches.
Our William was up against it. He
plunged his hands into his tunic-
pockets and commenced to stride up
and down, thinking to the best of his
ability.
In pocketing his right hand he en-
countered some hard object. On
drawing the object forth he discovered
it to be his mother's gift. William's
mother, under the impression that her
son spends most of his time lying
wounded and starving out in No-man's-
land, keeps him liberally supplied with
tabloid meals to sustain him on these
occasions—herds of bison corralled into
one lozenge, the juice of myriad kine
concentrated in a single capsule. This
particular gift was of peppermints
(warranted to assuage thirst for weeks
on end). But it was not the pepper-
mints that engaged William's young
fancy; it was the container, small,
metal, cylindrical.
His inspiration took fire. He set
the tin under the chaff-cutter, chopped
off a yard of telephone wire, buried one
end in peppermints, twisted the other
about the leg of the cutter, mounted
his horse and rode for dear life.
When he returned with the limber
an hour later, he found three cavalry-
men, two horse-gunners and a trans-
porteer grouped at a respectful radius
round the chaff-cutter, daring each
other to jerk the wire.
When William stepped boldly for-
ward and jerked the wire they all flung
themselves to earth and covered their
heads. When nothing happened and
he coolly proceeded to load the cutter
on the limber they all sat up again
and took notice.
When he picked up the tin and
offered them some peppermints they
mounted their horses and rode away.

BEFORE the War, long years ago,
She played about the village street,
Twisted a daisy chain or so
In summer, or with flying feet
Traced patterns in the winter snow,
Or maybe through the clang and smoke
Clattered to school for half the day;
The other, punctual to the stroke,
Worked at the mill and paid her way
And earned her keep like other folk.
The years brought war, and through
the great
New turmoil of a world upturned
From far away there came her fate,
Brave, brown and lean. One day
she learned,
Surprised but glad, she'd found her
mate.
Soon, the War done, from scenes that
Welle
Her clear-cut all, alone with him
She will have passed where in a blur
Of sea-wide distance, golden dim,
The great adventure beckons her.
Australian ways are not the same
As what she knows; in that broad
land,
Threatened with unfamiliar flame
Of drought the scattered homesteads
stand,
And there she goes to prove her name.
By plain and pasture, hills and beach,
Her world will swell in monstrous
girth,
Lonely, immense, beyond the reach
Of common help, till all her earth
Is strange but English hearts and
speech.
Australia, treat her well; as those
Your sons came here to give their
lives
For love of England, so she goes
To great ordeals. These your wives
Are England. So the Empire grows.

Richard. Did people still write poetry
in this reign 2
Mrs. M. What a strange question
Why, it was calculated that there were
more poets and novelists to the square
mile than at any other time. And the
inspiration was not confined to one
class. There were postman poets, bath-
chair poets, railway-porter poets as
well as poets who were Peers or
Members of the Order of the British
Dmpire.
George. Was Field-Marshal HAIG a
poet? - -
Mrs. M. No, my dear. He was other-
wise and, I think, better engaged. But
I believe Sir IAN HAMILTON published a
volume of poems in his youth, and there
were many splendid soldier poets, and
a good many people who wrote what,
they called poetry, though, as it deliber-
ately avoided rhyme and metre, other
people found it hard to distinguish it
from prose. Dut the quantity was
enormous. And besides the men and
women and children who wrote this
poetry there was a considerable number
of persons engaged in discovering and
encouraging poets, writing prefaces to
their books, founding poetry clubs and
opening poetry hotels and teashops.
One of the most famous resorts of the
Georgian poets was a vegetarian poetry
restaurant. As one of the unsympa-
thetic critics said, poetry had ceased to
be a matter of inspiration; it was a
great industry, the products of which,
if not too exalted in aim, commanded
a ready sale. Indeed quite a number
of people lived by writing verses, apart
from those who lived by writing about
them. .- -
George. But why
writing in rhyme?
Mrs. M. Not all of them gave it up;
only those who found that it interfered
with the rapidity of composition or who
despised it because it had been used
by the Victorians. At the vegetarian
poetry restaurant I have referred to it
was forbidden to mention the name of
TENNYSON, the popular Victorian poet,
because on one occasion a stranger who
had praised TENNYSON was temporarily
blinded by an indignant Georgian who
threw a hot nut-cutlet in his face.
Mary. How messyl Was he pun-
ished?
did they give up
* Mrs. M. Yes, my dear. He had to
pay a farthing damages. The case was
tried before the famous Judge DAR-
LING and lasted nineteen days. The
terrible provocation which the prisoner
had received was duly considered, and
the Judge's summing-up is still a fav-
ourite piece in the repertory of comic
elocutionists.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, October 15th-Both Houses
met again to-day “according to plan,”
and not because there is any very
urgent need for their labours just now.
The official programme was hardly
exciting enough to account for the large
attendance both on the floor and in the
galleries. As I cannot imagine that
it was an absorbing interest in Tithe
Rent-charge which caused Lord FISHER
to pay one of his angelic visits to the
Peers' Gallery I infer that he expected
to hear something about the War—or
the Peace.
In that he was disappointed. Mr.
BonAR LAw thought it premature to
discuss a military situation changing
every hour—and happily always for the
better—or even to propose a formal Vote
of Thanks to men who were
daily adding to their harvest
of laurels. As for the Peace-
proposals, the wise gardener
never pulls up a plant to see :
how it is growing, particu-
larly if, as in this case, it may
be a “plant" indeed.
The Irish Nationalists were
present in unusual force.
They learned that the Mun-
ster Fusiliers had fought gal-
lantly with Gough, and that
in answer to the recent
appeal for recruits less than
ten thousand of their fellow-
countrymen have shown any
inclination to follow their
example. The CHIEF SECRE-
TARY had nothing to say ,
about conscription and refused to be
drawn even when Mr. KING essayed
a second inquiry “arising out of that
silence.” -
Mr. DILLON and his colleagues put a
great many questions regarding the tor-
pedoing of the Leinster and the lack of
an escort. It was unfortunate that their
tone suggested more indignation with
the alleged laches of the Admiralty than
horror at the German crime. I almost
thought at one time that Dr. MACNA-
MARA would have to get up and say,
“Perhaps I ought to inform hon, gentle-
men opposite that it was a German
and not a British submarine that did
this thing.” But he contented him-
self with explaining that very fast ships
like the Leinster were considered to be
safer when proceeding independently
than when convoyed by slower war-
ships.
Mr. OUTHWAITE's natural curiosity
as to the date of the General Election,
which will inter alia terminate his
representation of Hanley, was not
satisfied. Possibly the PRIME MINISTER
is waiting until the House shall have
decided whether women are to be
eligible for seats. It would seem about
time for Sir G. O. TrEveLYAN to pre-
pare a revised edition of “The Ladies
in Parliament.”
While everywhere else men were
discussing President WILSON's reply to
the GERMAN CHANCELLOR, the House of
Commons devoted the best part of an
hour to the recent change in the pro-
prietorship of The Daily Chronicle,
formerly The Clerkenwell News, and
now, if we are to believe all that Mr.
PRINGLE said about it, the Chronique
Scandaleuse. But Sir HENRY DALZIEL,
the controlling member of the new pro-
prietary, who ought to know, gave an
entirely different account of the trans-
action ; , and the House, I am sure,
attached at least as much importance
to the one statement as to the other.
Bullock (to Mr. Clynes, who is restricting the sale of fat cattle for
food. “BUT I HEARD THEY WANTED MoRE.” -
Wednesday, October 16th.--The House
is beginning to suspect that the en-
thusiasm of certain of its Members
for increased pensions to soldiers is
inspired by a desire to save their own
seats at the taxpayers' expense. It is
quite ready to leave the interests of
the soldier and his dependents in the
generous and capacious hands of Mr.
John Hodge, the Grand Pensionary of
the Treasury Bench. When he says a
case is “under-r my immediate pair-
sonal conseeder-ration " it is as good
as done.
As soon as Mr. CLYNES, fearing a
shortage, decides to cut down our meat
rations, he is faced with a crowd of angry
farmers complaining that they cannot
dispose of their prime beasts. Sir John
SPEAR, a standing contradiction of the
adage, “who drives fat cattle should
himself be fat,” put the farmers' case
very well. Either they ought to be
allowed to sell their beeves or else they
ought to be furnished with feeding-stuffs
to keep them in condition. Major ASTOR,
in a conciliatory reply, promised that
every effort would be made to absorb
the surplus stock, principally by supply-
ing the troops at home with fresh meat
instead of frozen. So Mr. CI.YNEs will
be popular in the Messes for a week
or two."
Thursday, October 17th.—The Gov-
ernment's action in regard to meat has
caused the resignation of their Pig
Controller. Mr. DEVLIN was naturally
concerned to hear that “the gintleman
who pays the rint” had lost his
protector and demanded to know what
was “the pig policy" of the Gov-
ernment. But Mr. BoNAR LAw, enter-
ing into his humour, replied that “an
important question of that kind” re-
quired notice. -
A question referring to “capitula-
tions” aroused momentary interest,
until it was discovered that they were
only the Egyptian and not the Central
European variety.
The Ulstermen have now
delivered up those famous
rifles of which we have heard
so much and seen so little

OUGHT NOVELISTS TO PAINT 2
REMARKABLE DEBATE. -
At a recent meeting of the Quill-
drivers' Club the action of Mr. ARNOLD
BENNETT in challenging public criticism
as an artist was discussed at a most
interesting debate.
Sir Edward Cook, who opened the
discussion, observed that Mr. BENNETT
was only following the example of
TURNER, which he had noted in his
Literary Recreations, and cited BROWN-
ING's lines:— -
“Ay, of all the artists living, loving,
None but would forgo his proper dowry—
Does he paint 2 He fain would write a
poem ;
Does he write? He fain would paint a
picture.”
Mr. LYTTON STRACHEY, who followed,
strongly deprecated the dragging in of
BRowNING, who was merely a Vic-
torian. In spite of his unfortunate
Christian name of ARNOLD, Mr. STRA-
chEY was inclined to place Mr. BENNETT
above RAFAEL and DANTE, for he was
a better novelist than the former and a
better landscape-painter than the latter.
Mr. CHARLEs GARVICE frankly re-
gretted Mr. BENNETT's new departure.
He had already achieved distinction as
journalist, novelist and dramatist. He
was now a Government official. Where
would it end? The post of Ambassador
to the United States was still open, and,
if it was not given to Mr. T. P. O'Con-
Nor, might very likely be offered to
Mr. BENNETT.
Mr. CHESTERTON, on the contrary,
held that the more a writer spread
himself the more concentrated he be-
came and the greater was his grip on
his public. Personally he would walk
miles to see Sir HALI, CAINE dancing
in the Russian ballet at the Coliseum.
Sir HENRY DALzir. L., M.P., asked for
permission to make a brief personal
explanation. There was no foundation
for the report that Mr. BENNETT had
been engaged to contribute political
cartoons to The Daily Chronicle in
support of the present Cabinet.
A representative of the Black and
White Artists' Trade Union denounced
Mr. BENNETT as a black-leg from the
Black Country, but met with little sup-
port, and the meeting passed a resolu-
tion sanctioning Mr. BENNETT's action
on the understanding that he abstained
from exhibiting portraits of the PRIME
MINISTER,
Cannon-Fodder.

It happened that the little dark man and I came into
collision, both of us having looked round at the same
moment. He lost his hat and I lost my temper; but he
was so small and apologetic and his face was such a net-
work of queer smiles that I forgave him. “It's almost
like one o' me own shows,” he said.
“One of your own shows " " I said. “What do you

originator of the flourishing company of “Amusers Limited.'
We do a great work in entertaining the wounded. We came
to the conclusion that the old methods of amusement were
about played out. People, especially wounded people, don't
really care for motor-drives to Hampstead Heath or even
for high-class concerts. What was required was a return
to Nature in the matter of amusement. That's where we
come in. All that is necessary is that a wounded man
should apply to us at our office in Grafton Street for eight

“You have in me the founder and sole
hours of amusement and pay a subscription of five shil-
lings. From that moment we take him in hand till the
eight hours are up, and we supply him with a round of
rollicking laughter. Most of our work is done in the
open air. Do you see that wounded man? Just watch
him and you'll see things happen. Here's a General
Officer coming along. A puff of wind catches him; his
cap is blown into the street and he sets off after it—I
hope you're watching, Sir. There now—his cap comes to
rest in a puddle o' water, and as he reaches it he himself
falls in the same puddle and emerges covered with mud.
A painful experience, you'll say; but just look at the
wounded man and tell me what he's doing.” * *
“The wounded man,” I said, “is splitting his sides with
laughter.” -
“Well then,” he said, “the wounded man is getting his
money's worth out of our company. He has paid for
laughter and he gets laughter.” . - - - --
“But,” I said, “the General—what about him?” . .
“The General,” he said, “is one of our best employees.
That little scene you saw is a specimen of his skill. He's
worked it up himself and it never fails to go. We have
plenty in stock of much the same kind. There's one in
which a particularly haughty and pompous man who is
parading up Duke Street, St. James's, steps twice where
there is no step to be stepped on. You'd laugh till you
cried if you saw the terrific shock that this gives to his
dignity. It's quite a refined little piece of comedy and goes
very well, though a good many prefer something rather
rougher. Still, we cater for all tastes...There's one other
show I should like to give you—the quarrel with the Italian

FROM INDIA'S CORAL STRAND,
It is a far cry from Killarney to Karachi, and yet the
fusion of East and West is completed by the circum-
stance that Karachi boasts a Killarney Hotel. Who
founded this establishment and gave it its name I cannot
say—almost certainly an Irishman; but he is either there
no longer or has relinquished the task of writing out the
daily menu to an Oriental dependent, whose handling of
the King's English is a constant joy to the guests. What-
ever the meals may be the spelling is a surprise.
On a day in this last August, for example, the luncheon
consisted of Irish stew, beef cutlets, cold beef, curried
vegetables and rice, pancakes and stewed pears. Certain
opportunities are here offered to the whimsical ortho-
grapher; but nothing extraordinary. The native “boote-
ler" of the Killarney Hotel, Karachi, whose duty it is to
transcribe the dishes in chalk on a slate, was, however,
equal to some very attractive variations. This was his
effort:— e : -

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A NICE-MINDED credulity on the part of the good characters
in spy fiction is of course essential to its success; but I
connot help thinking that the heroine of Mrs. BELLoc
LowNDEs' latest thriller, Out of the War (CHAPMAN AND
HALL), reveals herself as almost phenomenally endowed in
this respect. Betty Felbrigge, the American wife of an
English Naval officer, had gone to recuperate at Pymsand,
on the assurance of her husband that the place was entirely
out of the War, and further that he himself might often be
unsuspectedly in the neighbourhood on active service. This
slight contradiction seems to have escaped her; anyhow
off she went to the Bungalow Hotel, a pleasant establish-
ment with a sea view and a sinister chambermaid; and
before long, walking upon the beach, she met a man—a man
dressed as a Naval captain, calling himself Horatio Drake,
speaking careful English, which grew more precise in
moments of stress, alternately polite and cavalier, with a
table manner that lacked refinement, and a taste for pork;
and not even the last peculiarity roused in Betty the faintest
suspicion that her mysterious friend was really—well, you
can see what. Indeed I hesitate to say how far this
misplaced confidence carried her lest I rouse in your mind
my own doubt as to whether anyone, even a heroine, could
be such an altogether superhuman simpleton. But if Betty
as a credible character suffers somewhat from the demands
of the plot Mrs. BELLoc LowNDEs can be sincerely con-
gratulated upon her handling of the soi-disant Drake, a
really clever and (one feels) probable study. The skill
and fairness of the portrait make it among the best of the
many that she has drawn during the past four years.
All Mr. W. H. Hudson's books have been profoundly
autobiographical. No matter with what theme he may
have been principally concerned—the birds of London, the
life of a Wiltshire shepherd, the downs of Sussex, the
fauna and flora of La Plata, the romance of Bolivia—the
central figure has been himself, the patient reader of
nature's secrets wistfully endeavouring to reconcile man
and the universe. So subjective and introspective are these
beautiful books that of few authors do we seem to know
more. Our information has come, however, hitherto
obliquely and between the lines. Mr. HUDsoN now pro-
vides what might be called a primer to himself in a direct
autobiography, consisting of the intimate history of his
early years, under the title, Far Away and Long Ago (DENT),
where the makings of a naturalist and a mystic are set forth.
It has been said that childhood is the most significant period
of any imaginative writer's career. Mr. HUDsoN's fascin-
ating pages, describing his home in the Pampas, amid
fatalistic gauchos, wild cattlemen, odd horse-breeding neigh-
bours and sub-tropical birds and beasts, help us to under-
stand the peculiar position he occupies in literature. Even
more, perhaps, are we enlightened by his portrait of that
other most powerful influence in an imaginative child's life
—his mother. Altogether I should venture to place this
among the books whose contemporary popularity will be far
exceeded by the attention paid to them by posterity.
Crucific Corner (METHUEN) is the latest product of the
popular firm of C. N. and A. M. WILLIAMSON. For no reason
that I can discover the book is in the form of a long letter
or series of letters addressed to a dead clergyman whose
name I have omitted to remember—indeed, I think he has
no name, but is always spoken of as “dear Padre” or
“Padre dear.” The writer of the letters is a certain
Miss Mary O'Malley, who falls in love with Jim Beckett, son
of an American millionaire, as he with her. But, though

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
matters proceed very quickly no engagement takes place,
and Jim becomes a flying man in the forces of the Entente.
One day he flies and does not return. What is Miss O'Malley,
fair but impecunious, to do? She answers that question
by getting hold of Jim's parents and pretending that she
was engaged to their son. It is a mean trick and unworthy
of the correspondent of a deceased clergyman; but it suc-
ceeds, and the innocent American pair adopt her. In the
end Jim turns up safe and sound and all is made right.
A large portion of the book is of a high-class guide-book
order, and gives valuable details of the history and appear-
ance of many places in France. It is perhaps not the very
best of the WILLIAMson books, but it has its merits and
will serve to pass an hour or two pleasantly enough.
A novel like The Threshold (JARRoDDs), that aims at being

McGee, insolent outlaw, despair of the cops and sleuths of
half a continent, turns into the sky-pilot's enthusiastic
assistant, John Flint, “the Butterfly Man” (so the children
name him), writer of learned monographs, lecturer on
famous platforms, and above all friend to all in trouble,
from little sweated mill-children to fluttered jenny-wrens
threatened by truculent blue jays. Perhaps the change is
all a little sudden and the penitent's halo of a little too
bright a gold, but the author has the skill to make it seem
not utterly incredible. Possibly you may guess the way
in which the Butterfly Man, long after his conversion, gets
more than even with a blackmailing tyrant of a millionaire.
But, whether you guess or not, here's a pleasant tale for you.
The average male reader will usually take an immediate

unreliable Irish genius who de-
velops a merely Celtic churlish-
ness into downright malevolent
meanness by a steady diet of
whiskey. Consumed with jeal-
ousy of his wife and A. M., and
informed by the doctor that he
has only a short while to live,
he conceives the pleasant idea
of making away with himself
so cleverly that they will never
know whether he is alive or
dead. Fortunately the plan mis-
carries, all but the suicide, and
A. M. and Nancy are free to
marry and live happily ever
after. It is not the story,

frankly one doubts how such flutter-wing tilting can disturb
so tough a windmill, and at times, in spite of the author's
moments of real strength, one has to hold on with both
hands to the remembrance that she is an American and
therefore on our side, in order to forgive and forget some
appalling self-complacencies. To these the publishers are
accessory by reason of their reverent quotation, on the
cover, of some of the writer's—or her heroine's—rather
ordinary sayings; but all the same, if you burn the wrapper
and go armed with charity, you should find here a good
deal to applaud and even something to enjoy.
To those who like a sentimental tale which yet offends
not the palate by a surfeit of sweetness and is told with
an easy grace, a sense of humour and a discreet eye for
character let me commend The Butterfly Man (HEINEMANN),
by MARIE Conway OEMLER. The scene is set in that proud
backwater town, Appleboro, South Carolina. The hero is
a crippled cracksman whom the little French padre and
the charming maid, Mary Virginia, win over to the ways of
orderly citizenship. From the profoundest distrust Slippy
however, but the way of its telling that will enhance Mr.
RUSSELL's reputation and cause dogears to grow on the
library copies of Wren's Wife.
Of the three generations that contribute to the family
history of Perpetual Fires (ALLEN AND UNwiN) Grandfather
Longways, owner of a small estate in Northumberland, was
a novelist and a good bit of a dreamer; Anthony, of the
second generation, was a doctor, one of the “get-on-or-get.
out" type; and Oliver, Anthony's son, was a musician, as
vague as even a musical genius can be. There is a quietness
about Mr. ERIC LEADBITTER's methods that appeals very
strongly to me. . His characters are presented without the
smallest symptom of effort or pressure; they are just
ordinary people who arouse one's interest merely because
they are drawn with uncommon skill. It is a delicate piece
of work that may easily fail to attract attention among
noisier appeals. There is, however, no good reason that I
can see why the author might not, without risk of sacrificing
the intrinsic probability of his picture, have been a little
more cheerful.

COMRADE HOHENZOLLERN SOLILOQUISES.
I was not born to be a common clown ;
I simply loathe this working blouse;
This cap of Liberty, in lieu of crown,
Goes ill with my majestic brows,
My eagle eye, my martial nose,
And these Imperial moustachios.
Ex-arbiter (just now) of War and Peace,
1 greatly miss my clanking sword;
I shrink from these culottes, without a crease,
Which to my legs no chance afford;
These sabots, too!—my pride demurs
At being parted from my warrior spurs.
But MAX is very strong on this disguise;
The need is heavy, he insists,
For throwing dust in democratic eyes
And heartening British pacifists;
For gaining time in which to talk
While we arrange to start again from baulk.
For, if the War's objective is a world
Made safe for democrats, and here
We let the Flag of Freedom go unfurled,
Here in Potsdam, why, then 'tis clear
The world will also have to be
Made safe for our alleged democracy.
Such talk (says MAx) will split the Entente ranks,
And, once a German peace is made,
I can discard (says MAX) these dismal pranks,
This dull plebeian masquerade,
And for the gear that fits a god
Exchange these rags in which I look so odd.

NENETTE AND RINTINTIN.
“No single individual can hope to have a corner in
luck,” said Randolph. “There isn't a mascot big enough
to insure you against every possible disaster.”
“Quite right,” said Ethelbert. “When I went to France
I took a crooked ha'penny to protect me from shrapnel
and Spanish flue, a golliwog against gas, gastritis and
German measles, and a lucky threepenny bit, some white
heather, a silver pig and a swastika to cover everything
else. But I found one thing I wasn't protected against,
because I became a casualty with frost-bite caused by
speaking to a Staff Officer without being introduced.”
“I know,” said Randolph. “You can't start dodging
before you know what's going to hit you. I once went into
action with a forty horse-power fate-resisting fetish in
its own particular line, but it let me down badly in another
direction.”
“You went into action,” exclaimed Ethelbert—“you, a
confirmed base-wallah!"
“A figure of speech. As you brutally remind me, for
many moons I pushed the old war along from a sheltered
position in the extreme rear, and during that period was
billeted in a French household. There was a Red Cross
hospital close by, and a fair W.A.D. who deigned to regard
me not unkindly. Well, one day I had a holiday, left the
War in other hands and decked myself in my brightest and
best, with the intention of calling upon her. When I
came down to breakfast, Louise, the fat and amiable
bonne, surveyed me critically but appreciatively.
“‘Wous étes 'ell of a nut ce matin, m'sieur,” she said
with admiration.
“‘Louise,' I answered, ‘you have expressed yourself, as
-
always, with force and lucidity. May I inquire the name
of your English master?'
“‘C'est Zshorsh, your batsman,’ replied Louise, with the
pride of an apt pupil.
“‘I thought so. I thought I detected George's racy
phraseology. Well, for your information I am calling on
a lady on whom I am desirous of creating an impression.'
“‘So? Then you will tek wis you Nenette and Rintintin
for ze bonheur, n'est-ce-pas?'
“Of course you know Nenette and Rintintin. They are
two yellow woollen figures connected by a red woollen cord,
and their mission in life is to protect the Allies from
Gothas and Berthas.”
“I know them,” said Ethelbert. “They are a reinforced
overproof hoodoo. I carried them about with me for two
months and didn't get hit by a bomb once.”
“Well, I don't say they aren't efficient in their own par-
ticular line, but Louise was wrong in setting them on to
a job they weren't used to. I shoved them in my pocket
and walked to the hospital, where I sent the Matron a
request that I might be allowed to see ‘Cousin' Sylvia.
“The Matron said Sylvia was off duty and I could see
her in the nurses' recreation hut. There was only one
other nurse in the room, and by the time I had inquired
after Aunt Priscilla and Sylvia had told me all about Uncle
Theodore— ”
“Wonderful how they play up to you, isn't it?” said
Ethelbert.
“—the nurse went out. By-and-by I started telling
Sylvia about Nenette and Rintintin, putting them round
her neck to show her how the charm worked. Of course
this brought our heads close together, which seemed a con-
venient position for continuing the conversation. But
suddenly we heard a footstep, and just had time to be
properly ‘drawing-room 'before the Matron came in.”
“It seems to me that Nenette and Rintintin brought you
luck,” said Ethelbert. “If it hadn't been for them the
Matron would have pounced on you unawares and caught
you flagrantly kissing.”
“That's where you are wrong. They let me down insidi-
ously and maliciously. I couldn't understand the Matron's
sudden drop in temperature until I discovered that Nenette
had hooked herself on to Sylvia's brooch and Rintintin was
clinging on to my collar badge, and that we were sitting as
innocent as doves with a yard of red wool stringing us
obviously together.
“No, charms may be able to do a definite job all right,
but when you try to spread them out to cover all the
bad luck that's watching for you, they wear so thin that
they're bound to crack somewhere.”

WHEN YE SEE THE WHITES O' THEIR EYES OPEN FIRE.”
THEY’RE COMIN' IN MASSED FORRMATION.
OLYMPUS.
For the two-hundredth time the
great Corps Staff met round the Con-
ference Table, and for the two-hundredth
time they fell to wondering moodily
why the other fellow didn't realise the
difficulties of any other job except his
own. Naturally they were all per-
fectly at home—all except the Senior
Mechanical Transport Officer, who,
arriving late, had been obliged to take
the chair without a bottom to it and who
was slowly submerging. Yes, it was a
goodly collection and you couldn't have
stretched your legs under the table
anywhere without kicking a Brigadier,
while departmental Colonels, lorry-
kings and road-officers filled the gaps
nobly.
Amongst these super-heavies sat a
mere pip-squeak junior member of the
Staff. “Que diable allait-il faire dans
cette galère 2" you ask. Oh, he is only
the G.3, the bazaar-writer, the minute-
maker. The profundity of his relative
ignorance weighs heavily on him, and
he is wont to say a little prayer on the
château steps before going in-a prayer
to the effect that he may not be called
upon to give voice. True, there has
never yet been an occasion for such a
catastrophe, for there has never been a
question arising out of the complexities
of Corps Administration which one or
other of the mighty men have not been
able to crush at sight; but then it was
conceivable that something might crop
up, and they might turn on him, and
who is he that he should know things
that have been withheld from Great
Ones? Besides which they would want
to know, afterwards why the devil he
kept the little knowledge he had to
himself.
There was a hush. Then a further
hush. The Conference was going to
begin. Looking the Intelligence Wallah
straight in the eyes, the Corps Com-
mander accomplished the feat of bring-
ing him from fancy to fact and bade
him commence.
“What are the indications of an
enemy attack on our front ?” he was
asked. -
To listen to his appreciation of the
situation as he unfolded it with his
inimitable aplomb was to have all
doubts as to the enemy's intentions at
once removed. It was as if the Bosch
had simply laid his cards on the table:
Summarized it explained that the enemy
might attack, or he might elect to re-
main on the defensive, or he might do
both, either to-morrow morning at 5.30,
12 noon or at any hour of the day or
night within the next two years. If
there was an attack, it might confi-
dently be expected from the North or
from the South, while there were un-
doubtedly signs of a very good possibi-
lity of a drive from the East (they are
bloodhounds, these fellows—nothing
escapes them, and they always manage
to get it right).
The G.3 had just time to note down
something about “Divisions to prepare
schemes to meet all contingencies,"
when an awful moment occurred.
“When does the Umteenth Division
come to us?”
For a moment there was a pause.
G.3's heart simply leapt. Perhaps he
would have to speak! No, the General's
never-failing memory served him. The
moment passed and he breathed freely
once again. Then matters became
lively. “G.” knew something “Q."
ought to have known, and “Q.” had
heard something “G.” had not been
told about. Soon a lively interchange
of arguments regarding speed of lorries,
roads, gun spurs, trench feet and so
forth left the struggling minute-maker
far, far behind. Writing furiously in his
little notebook, heedless of the crash of
ornaments swept off the table by the
forcible gestures of one who wished to
make it quite understood that his lorries

of wounded and could not be used for

all the poor fellow could get down in
his notes were things like this:—

Silence suddenly. G.3 sighed as he
glanced through his usual mass of use-
less notes. The Conference was over ?
No—horror!!! The Corps Commander
was looking at him He was going
to be asked a question He felt it.
He knew it. Taking cover round the
right-hand side of his note-book he
pretended to write and write, hoping
against hopelessness. He had almost
said, “I don't know, Sir, but I will find
out,” before he heard what it was.
Suddenly it came. -
“Well, G.3," said the Corps Com-
mander, “you have never spoken in
these Conferences yet. Is there any
question you would like to put before
the Staff 2 ”
. The question produced a vacuum in
the mind of the G.3. This was awful.
He must say something—something
sensible, if possible, but something,
anyway.
“Well, Sir,” he stammered at last,
hot and flurried, “there is one question
I should very much like to put. I am
continually being asked—er—when the
War is going to be over, and I should
like very much to give an answer which
I could feel would express the opinion
of the Corps.”
The super-heavies sat aghast. Such
a question had never occurred to them.
“What does Intelligence say to
that ?” asked the Corps Commander.
Never had the star of Intelligence
shone more brightly. Rising to his
feet to do greater justice to the immens-
ity of the problem, he began:- -
“Well, Sir,” he said, “while it is
impossible at the present time to arrive
at any conclusion with any degree of
exactitude, I must say that what I will
term the highest common measure of
the general opinions expressed among
those who should speak with authority
seems to indicate that the War may,
broadly speaking, be expected to con-
clude with complete victory on the
one side or the other. Among the
many factors which are likely to con-
tribute to this eventuality is the ques-
tion of labour and material. . . .

'THERE is no market for brains nowa-
days. My kind of brains, I mean. My
little flutter with Holdem proved that.
I selected Holdem for the experiment
because he always seems to have the
rest of the Kings of Commerce badly
beat. “Here,” said I, “is a man who
has done well. He must have done
thousands and made millions. He has
gone far. With my brains he could go
farther.”
Once my mind was made up I began
to act. The revolving door of his marble
offices checked me for a moment, for at
the first time of asking I made a short
circuit and was shot out into the street
again. But it takes more than that to
...' me. At the third try I landed
well up the tessellated aisle, between
the mahogany pews with the brass
railings. -
“What's the game?” asked the
Field-Marshal with the brass buttons
and the medals.
“Game!” I said, “game! Why
don't you have a door instead of a man-
trap 2 I want to see Holdem.”
“See who 2 " he cried in a horrified
voice.
“Holdem,” I repeated. “Holdem.

way.”
“Have you got an appointment 2"
he said with the stony stare and the
climbing eyebrow.
“No,” I answered.
see him.”
“But you can't see him,” he said
emphatically. “He never sees anyone
without an appointment.”
“Nonsense,” said I. “Of course I
can see him if he is here. I must see
him. That's what I've come for. If
he's in fetch him out.” -
The poor old fellow could not have
been more upset if I had said “Shoot
him.” He shook until his medals
rattled like a bunch of keys. But he
could see that I was not to be trifled
with. Gasping like a goldfish he crept
round to tell the others. They all
stopped work to look at me. Presently
one of the churchwardens in the back
pew came out on tiptoe, carrying what
looked like a hymn-sheet in his hand.
“Do you wish to see Sir Anthony per-
sonally ” ” he whispered softly, so that
no one else could hear him.
“Of course I do,” I said. “And
tell him to jump about. I can't wait
here all day.”
The churchwarden fanned himself
for a little while with the hymn-sheet
and then, thrusting it into my hand,
he said, “If you will state your business
on this form we will send it up.”
“But I want to
I wrote “PRIVATE AND CoNFIDEN-
TIAL | URGENT | | " in a bold hand.
In less than half an hour I was
looking at the great man whom I was
willing to raise to greater greatness.
I could see how rich he was already.
He had the air of a man who never
needs to borrow a fiver, and a carpet
so thick that when his feet slipped off
the desk while he was asleep the clerks
downstairs couldn't hear the bump.
I gave him a sunny smile, but he
ignored it.
“What's this private business of
yours, young man 2" he growled.
“Remember my time is precious. What
is it you want?”
“I don't want anything,” said I
sharply; “I have come here to offer you
something. Sell you something. . .”
He plunged a fat finger towards one
of his fifty-five telephone bells. “My
Assistant Manager will see you,” he
said.
But I soon showed him that I was
not the man to take the pass-out check
in the first act.
“No, Sir,” I thundered. “What I
have to sell I sell to you. You—your-
self! Otherwise no sale.”
“My time . . .” he began again.
“So is mine,” I said. “But I have
something to sell which you need.”
That pulled him up. -
“What is it?” he said. . . .
“Brains,” said I.
The doctors described it as apoplexy,
and it was a month before he could see
anyone. Dut he never saw me again. I
do not make an offer of that kind twice.
TWISTERS.
TILL last night I'd always reckoned
as Jock McMurtrie and me was the
very best o' pals. Over three months
'im and me 's been in the next beds in
the 'ospital, and we've always gone
'alves in fags and visitors, but since
what 'appened yesterday some'ow I
don't think as 'ow things can ever be
the same again.
What would you think of a pal as
goes an' scares you pretty well out o'
your wits, an' then goes an' makes you
a laughin'-stock for the rest o' the boys?
I asks you.
But I'll tell you all about it, and
leave you to judge for yourself between
'im and me.
Yesterday dinnertime, as we was
just finishing our brown stew, 'e says
to me, “Ma cheerie, are ye for a bit
promenade up by the chongditeer?”
“What the 'ell's chongditeer?” says
I. “Something to do with taties, ain't
it 2 '' -
“Taties 2" says 'e; “ye mean to say
ye ’ve been twa year in France and ye
dinna ken the deefference between
‘pongditeer,' meaning ‘taties,” and
‘chongditeer,' which is ontong cordially
for a rifle-range.”
I could see he was just swanking
with 'is French, so I says, “Nong,
Professor, no souvenir ; but ain't the
rookies a-firin' there to-day?”
“I dinna ken, an’ I’m no carin'
though they are," says Jock, on 'is 'igh
'orse again. “Man, d' ye think I'm
feart for yon war-babbies firin' their
groupin' at twa hundert yairds when
it's ta'en the Bosch three year for tae
gie me THIS 2" emphasising 'is remarks
by wagglin' the stump of 'is left arm.
Sure, as 'ouses, as we reached the
range the rattle o' musketry began, but
Jock didn't seem to notice, and says,
“Wull we coucher ici for a wee while,
an' ha'e a bit smoke?" squatting down
as he spoke on a bank three or four
'undred yards belind the stop-butt,
right in the line o' fire.
As I turned to sit down beside 'im,
“Ping!" whistled an unmistakable
spent bullet past my ear.
Now I ain't a windy sort of a cove,
but I can tell you I was down beside

THE OMNIVOROUS READER.
WHEN I am feeling far from well
And quite unfit to run with beagles,
I read the tales of E. M. DELL
And gain the soaring strength of
eagles.
Or if I take a gloomy view
And find the war-clouds looming
darkly,
They soon assume a roseate hue
When I peruse good Mrs. BARCLAY.
Again if nourishment I need
And long for oysters and for porter,
Or tripe and onions, I can feed
More richly upon CLEMENT SHoRTER.
But when the grandeur that is DELL's
Or SHORTER’s fails to animate me,
I turn to the tremendous WELLs,
Stern prophet, to invigorate me.
Then when the stimulating sage
Has stirred me with his fierce reveillé,
I hie me to the luscious page
Of CAINE (Sir HALL) or Miss CoRELLI.
I always read in bed at night,
And, when awakened by the shrill
cocks, -
I turn for solace and delight
To KEATs or ELLA WHEELER
WILCOx.
I learn by heart, too, quite a lot
When I am shaving or at supper,
Ballads by G. R. SIMs and Scott,
The works of TENNYSON and TUPPER.
It is not mine to flay and slate—
I leave it to the tribe of Bludyer
To scarify and flagellate
“A style like MEREDITH's, but mud-
dier.”
For mental pabulum I turn
To many cooks and many kitchens—
CoNRAD, LE QUEUx, LAFCADIO HEARN,
John Oxenham and Robert HICHENs.
Thus like a butterfly I flit
From pimpernel to tiger-lily,
Refreshing my untutored wit
With much that's wise and more
that's silly.

A few days ago a strange dark horse
arrived, having a splash of white on
one side of his face which took in the
eye and gave him a rather sinister ex-
pression. That afternoon, above his
unlovely head appeared the mysterious
Greek-looking inscription, “Chirkon.”
This however seemed not to please the
unknown, for next day it was altered to
“Cherken.” Nor did that satisfy him,
for by evening Stables the horse was
“Chirgin.”
There was something wanting even
yet, and it was a “w.” Somewhere in
the recesses of our friend's mind lurked
an elusive “w,” which he felt must go
in somewhere, for yesterday the white-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, October 21st.—While the
world was waiting to hear the German
Government's reply to President WIL.
soN's interrogatories, Mr. KING thought
it judicious to inquire whether the Brit-
ish Government approved the famous
“fourteen points.” Mr. BALFour de-
precated discussion at that moment,
and drew from Mr. Hogg E the best
joke of that unconscious humourist's
career. Why, he asked, should this
information be withheld from “those
of us who have borne the brunt of this
War for four years?”
This being Trafalgar
Day, any suggestion for
the welfare of our mer-
chant seamen, who have
been so gallantly aiding
the Navy to uphold the
NELSoN tradition, was
certain of a sympathetic
hearing. Yet I wonder if
these unassuming heroes
are altogether grateful to
Mr. PETo for his efforts
to secure them a standard
uniform, with chevrons,
torpedo badges and other
marks of distinction. At
any rate there seems
some justice in Mr.
Holt's complaint that
the badge in question is
to be awarded only to
those who have been tor-
pedoed and not to those
who have successfully
beaten off attack.
A chorus of praise
greeted a Bill to secure
pensions for superannu-
ated teachers, the princi-
pal complaint against it
being that the pension-
able age, sixty, was much
too high. That, no doubt,
is due to the Govern-
ment's deference to wha
Mr. HERBERT FISHER called “the som-
bre science of the actuary,” and can be
remedied in more prosperous times.
Tuesday, October 22nd. — Coming

that a tunnel under St. George's

sidering all the possibilities involved
they do not know of “a better 'ole.”
A new Pensions Bill, designed to
give the Ministry better control over
the local committees, had a mixed re-
ception. Sir HENRY CRAIK considered
that Mr. HoDGE was taking too much
power into his own hands; Sir WATsoN
CHEYNE criticized the proposal to with-
hold a pension from a man who re-
fuses medical treatment, and reminded
the House that cures could not be
guaranteed; and Sir HENRY HARRIs

It may be some timé yet, however,

MooRE, whose “maiden "speech was
appropriately devoted to this topic,
reminded us that in Australia, though
women had long been eligible for the
House of Representatives, no woman
had in fact yet secured election. In
practice therefore they may gain more
immediate benefit from Sir JAMEs

the fault of the Army

THE GREAT PEACE-BOND
SCHEME.
(From “The Market Bunnion Adver-
tiser” for June 19th, 19–.)
THE scandalous events of last Tues-
day are not likely to fade from the
memories of our citizens for a long
time to come. In common with all
other journals that have at heart the
public weal we hoped to find that the
late war had blown away some of the
cobwebs that infested for so long our
Government Offices. We hoped to find
efficiency substituted for red tape and
business men for mandarins. But we
were too sanguine. The old leaven is
working still. The recent astounding de-
velopment of the great
Peace - Bond Coupon
scheme is a proof that:
officialdom in its most
mechanical and perni-
cious form still sits en-
throned in Whitehall,
careless alike of public
economy and private
convenience. We hear
from all sides that the
experience of Market
Bunnion is the expe-
rience of every other
town and village in the
country.
Our readers will re-
member the terms of the
great coupon scheme
as instituted by the
War Salvage Control-
ler. Possessors of Peace
Bonds above a certain
value were presented
with coupons entitling
them to draw (accord-
ing to the value of their
citizens, were crowded with expectant
folk awaiting the great event. Toward
midday an enormous procession of
motor-lorries drew up in the square,
and the distribution of these objects of
“domestic and civilian utility” com-
menced forthwith. We have not the
space to enumerate at length the gifts
or their recipients; but we mention a
few of the more preposterous cases, as
they will illuminate better than any
words of our own the colossal inepti-
tude which has marked the whole
undertaking. - -
Among the most revered of our neigh-
bours is Mrs. Wotherspoon, whose ad-
vanced years and eminent parochial
services should at least have rendered

doubt very valuable articles, are likely
to be of small use to Mr. Milton Jones,
whose delicate verse so often graces our
columns. Five dozen “Dixies,” as we
believe they are called, one dozen iron
“Knife Rests” (for barbed wire en-
tanglements), and a Sponson Trolly
(whatever its use, a most unprepossess-
ing and unmanageable vehicle, having
no means of propulsion and weighing
about two tons), comprise the assorted
lot delivered at the gates of “Rest-
mead,” the charming residence of Mrs.
Stickelheimer, our gifted and welcome
Swiss-American visitor. Mr. Paunch,
our well-known haberdasher, informs
us that he has no use whatever for six-
cases of shrapnel helmets and an aero-
~ TT plane hangar.
| But perhaps the most
scandalous case of all is
that of Miss Merridew,
whosedancing academy
is patronised by the
youthful élite of our
little commonwealth.
This lady was seriously
alarmed in the after-
noon by the belated ar-
rival of her prize in the
form of a Tank (Mark
XIX pattern). This was
driven callously into her
garden and there desert-
... ed by its crew. In its
progress through Mar-
ket Bunnion it made a
large hole in the wall of
|No. 3, Market Street,
demolished a hen-house
and a perambulator in
the garden of No. 4,
ruined irretrievably a
dog-cart belonging to
Mr. Bellows, the but-
holding) one or more unspecified articles
no longer required by the military au-
thorities. It was assumed that the
element of uncertainty regarding each
individual gift would add to the ac-
ceptability of the scheme. Everyone
would get something, but no one knew
what. It was intimated, semi-officially,
however, that the gifts would be “ob-
jects of domestic or at least civilian
utility.” We cannot doubt that this
was the original intention of the Com-
mittee of Management, which included
such eminent personalities as the PRESI-
DENT of the Royal Academy, the DEAN
of St. Paul's, Mr. GEORGE Robey and
the late A.P.M. for Monte Carlo.
But what has been the outcome 2
The coupons were to be filled in and
despatched by the first day of April;
and on Tuesday morning last, when
the prizes were due to arrive, the
streets of our town, which numbers so
many patriotic investors among its
permanently to her bed—had dumped
her immune from the cynical careless-
ness (to put it mildly) of departmental
underlings. This aged lady—she will
forgive us for mentioning that she is
ninety-eight, quite deaf and confined
in her front garden a complete aero-
plane, known, we believe, as a Bristol
Fighter. Accompanying this were three
dozen boxes of phosphorus bombs' Mr.
Leftwich, our honoured Vicar, found
that his generous contributions toward
the National Exchequer were rewarded
by the gift of a Foden Steam Waggon
with de-lousing apparatus—a hideous
monstrosity for which room can be
found only in the Market Square.
Miss Cheesing, the Headmistress of
our Girls' National School, is now the
proud owner of seventeen miles of
barbed wire, three wire-cutters and a
6-inch Stokes mortar. A gross of Very
Light pistols, a Nissen hut, and a De-
cauville railway truck, although no
cher (who, by the way, has been pre-
sented with twenty gas cylinders for use
with observation balloons), and finally
broke down both gate-posts and part of
the wall of Miss Merridew's own resi-
dence. It now stands immovable on her
bed of delphiniums, in which she took
great pride. She came round to see us
as soon as she had recovered from the
shock, to ask us to use our influence ||
towards the removal of this nuisance.
Indeed our office has been congested
since Tuesday with justifiably indignant
citizens; and we now appeal to the
Government to take some steps to re-
lieve what has assumed the dimensions
of a national calamity. As BELISARIUS
remarked, it is worse than a calamity—
it is a blunder.

THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MARMADUKE AND MILLIGENT.
Woe is me ! I mourn for Marmaduke and Millicent, for
they are gone, and the place that knew them for many
happy months now knows them no more and must get on
as best it can without them. -
I may as well stop here for a moment in order to explain
that Marmaduke and Millicent were pigs, in the literal
'sense of the word. In the metaphorical sense they were
not more piggish than other pigs, though to be sure they
did a great deal of wallowing and were not always suitable
for drawing-rooms. They were born in Bucks and for
the whole of their lives up to yesterday their cheerful
“Honk! honk ' " resounded through a section of that
celebrated county,
They were purchased at a time when it was supposed
that unless everybody reared a private pig or so there
would be a bacon famine in the land, and consequently
everybody who had room for a pig immediately filled that
room with an appropriate tenant, to be converted later on
into bacon and ham and chap and trotters. Now, however,
it appears that throughout the land there are plenty of pigs,
and it became therefore unnecessary any longer to include
a pig in the family circle. Consequently it was resolved
that Marmaduke and Millicent must withdraw and cease,
and a deal was concluded, a cheque was drawn and received
and Marmaduke and Millicent were informed that they
could no longer be looked upon as our brother and our
sister. They showed but little concern when the announce-
ment was made, for nothing was said whilst negotiations
were going on as to the fate that was reserved for these inter-
esting but doomed animals. Later on, when the deal was
over and arrangements were being made to remove them,
*I had not the heart to hint at what must be within a day or
two. No one, not even the gardener, had the bad taste to
mention the inevitable. -
And so it happened that one fine morning—yesterday, to
be exact—the gardener, who had fed them and was there-
fore on familiar terms with them, appeared with a friend
at the place in which Marmaduke and Millicent were con-
fined and began preparations for removing the pair. Both
of them spent much time in unavailing protests, to which
the gardener and his friend paid no heed. The retirement,
skilfully conducted, was carried out in extended order,
single file, Marmaduke leading, with gyves on his nose,
followed by Millicent at an interval varying from five to
ten paces.
And so they vanished; but not the memory of their beauty,
their amiability and their readiness to adapt themselves to
circumstances and to flourish and grow fat in the service
of their country.

[October 30, 1918,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A COWARD'S COURAGE.
THESE are bad days for head-waiters.
The War deplenishes or wholly removes
their staffs; but the head-waiters re-
main—to struggle with inexperienced
hands, to see the fair fame of the
establishment disappearing, to receive
and, if possible, parry the complaints
of the customers.
The various head-waiters carry them-
selves under these afflictions with a
comportment that differs as they differ.
Some suggest absolute hopelessness;
some show signs of wear and tear;
some have cultivated that apathy under
misfortune, that dulled acceptance of
bad luck, which is part of the Briton's
heritage from his climate; others de-
precate the situation but smile, and in
smiling disarm criticism. -
I am thinking in particular of one
who more than smiles and disarms
criticism—he laughs and conquers.
I found him in the coffee-room of an
ancient and honourable West Country
hotel. Little tables and big were all
about him, with pink and green wine-
glasses on them and napkins bursting
into symmetrical schemes of foliage
from tumblers. It was a little before
lunch was ready and he was adding
finishing touches of polish to knives
and forks, with an apron protecting his
very spick dress-suit: dinner jacket
with satin roll collar and neat black
tie; such clothes as, but for the time
of day, proclaimed him fellow-guest
rather than servitor. A big man, with
a large white and superficially very
amiable face. But his most notable
feature was his eye. It was the eye
of a child—a rather spoilt child, accus-
tomed to get its own way and to be
considered preferentially; but it was
confident and dominating too. It called,
in association with the vast benignant
countenance, for a similar mood in its
vis-à-vis—insisted on it, had the right
to it; so that one would do much rather
than be the cause of disappointment.
I was in the coffee-room merely to
arrange about lunch, but the head-
waiter's communicativeness was such
that while doing so I learned many
things. I learned that he was prac-
tically single-handed; that he had
been there for twenty and more years
—twenty-three come December; that
the War was hitting the place very
hard ; that it was one's duty not to
grumble; that all his best boys had
been called up ; that three of them
had been wounded and one killed; that
waitresses do their best but are not so
good as waiters, at any rate not from
his point of view ; that the high wages
at the local munition works made it
difficult to retain waitresses anyway;
and that spirits really were now hardly
worth drinking.
At lunch there were many people,
but, with very little help, the head-
waiter, now divested of his apron, kept
them fairly contented, even finding
time to talk a little at most of the
tables. From certain broken sentences
that reached my ears I gathere that
he was practically single-handed; that
something was hitting the place very
hard ; that someone had been some-
where for more than twenty years;
that grumbling was a mistake; and
that spirits nowadays were hardly
worth drinking. Probably, had not a
guide-book claimed my attention, I
should have heard and learned more.
As the room began to empty and the
strain of attendance was relaxed, he
advanced smilingly upon my 'table,
with an expression of supreme satis-
faction, bearing before him, in both
hands, a brass-bound box or casket.
“You might like to see,” he said, “a
little souvenir which one of my staff,
back on leave from the Front, brought
me; ” and with enormous pride and a
gratification almost paternal—or more
than paternal, Creatorial—he opened
the lid and revealed a model aeroplane
constructed of metal from shell-cases
and other accessories of warfare.
“I’ve always,” he said, “had good
boys and treated them well, and the
first thing this lad did was to come and
bring this souvenir he'd been making|
for me. He's back in France now.”
I was properly appreciative, both of
the workmanship of the model and of
the kindly relations subsisting between
superior and inferior, and he bore the
relic away with complacency radiating
from his capacious person, and I saw
him, not without surprise and a slight
twinge of regret, displaying it at an-
other table. Why, I cannot exactly
explain, but it seemed to me wanting
in finer feeling, in the subtlest delicacy,
to show to everyone at the same time
this proof of devotion to himself. There
should be intervals. It wasn't that
I was mortified not to be unique; but
to make a triumphal progress with the
thing seemed a little blatant. …
You may up to now have been look-
ing upon this document as just a char-
acter sketch of a certain head-waiter.
But really it is something else; it is
the story of my own weakness. For
it was my destiny that day, finding once
again a sense of shame which can be so
sensitive as to be a misery when brought
into conflict with another's total lack of
it, to have to act with a distasteful brav-
ado. At dinner that evening, when the
strain of attendance had begun to relax
and several of the guests had departed,
I was conscious of the head-waiter's
eye lighting up once more with that
gleam of assurance and his features
melting comfortably into the smile of
self-approval. His hour had again
struck. But a moment later my blood
was frozen and an icy perspiration
broke out all over me as I saw him,
with his gleaming victorious eye full
on me, bearing in my direction the box
containing the aeroplane. Quicker
than lightning the dreadful thought
had entered my brain: “He has for.
gotten that he showed it me at lunch,”
followed by, the agonised question:
“What shall, I do? Am I strong
enough to tell him so? Can I bring
myself to do something which must
abash him 2 ” -
* By this time he was on me, all happi-
ness and expectancy. “You might
like to see,” he began, “a little souvenir
which one of my staff ”
With a desperate effort I pulled my-
self together. “Oh, that little model,”
I said. “You showed me that at
lunch;" and I lowered my eyes in the
hope that it might make his discom-
fiture easier. -
He laughed. “So I did,” he said,
and carried it to the next table. “You
might "I heard him begin.

ouT OF IT."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN Literary Recreations (MACMILLAN) Sir Edward Cook
has chosen a title at once modest and apt. It is a volume
filled with the pleasant reflections of a bookman in his
moments of leisure—library talk, one might call it, and
that of the most agreeable. I can do no more than give
you some of the headings: “The Art of Biography” (about
which, had we been actually talking, I might have re-
minded Sir Edward of what Mr. John MASEFIELD has so
poignantly written upon this theme), “Ruskin's Style,”
“Indexing,” “Literature and Journalism,” “A Study in
Superlatives” (that old unanswerable question, which is
the Best, and why?) and “Second Thoughts in Poetry.”
Of these the last is at once the longest and the most inter-
esting. Sir Edward has got together a fine variety of
instances to show how often great and familiar passages
have their present form, not, as one is apt to think, by
primary inspiration, but as the reward of reflection and
revision. Among so many examples as you will find here
it is not easy to select one more striking than another; but
there is certainly a shock in the discovery that “magic
casements opening on the foam of perilous seas” were
once “wide casements” and opened on “keelless seas.”
It is as though a rich heritage had been bequeathed to us in
a last-minute codicil. A paper that I have not mentioned
deals pleasantly with bound volumes of Cornhill (that
storehouse of literary and artistic treasure); and I should
add that Sir Edward not only has some winged words on
the subject of Indexes, but, following precept with practice,
furnishes his own volume with an admirable example of
the art that he so justly values.
Mr. W. J. LocKE's special gift lies in the elaboration of
fantastic character. So far as I am concerned the real hero
of The Rough Road (LANE) is not James Marmaduke Trevor
(Doggie), the little decadent, with no ideas beyond purple
silken underwear, his peacock and ivory boudoir, his collec-
tion of china dogs and the alleged weak state of his general
health, but his discreetly drunken tutor, Phineas McPhail.
A year or so after the War came, white feathers and
candid advice having been freely administered, Trevor joins
up, has to resign the King's commission by reason of
abject incompetence, and, setting his teeth, takes the rough
road of the private, sticks to it doggedly with Phineas
(of the same platoon) and the little Cockney, Shendish,
who constitute themselves his bodyguard. It is the
adorable ghost-haunted Jeanne (my second favourite) who
calls these ill-assorted inseparables the Three Musketeers,
and it is not Peggy, the Dean's daughter, Doggie's be-
trothed (she becomes quite unaccountably more snobbish
and shallow as Doggie waxes finer), but little French
Jeanne, her sad ghosts laid by love, who takes her doggie
back to what has every promise of becoming a very happy
and well-lined kennel. If at the beginning he is a little
too bad and at the end a little too good to be true, Phineas
(though I don't believe in him) is a notable creation, Shendish
is of the pure Cockney gold, and Jeanne a perfect dear.
Macedonian Musings (ALLEN AND UNwiN), by W.J. SELIG-
MAN, reaches me in a propitious hour, while the triumphs of

the army with which it deals are yet fresh in our minds.
Among my war-letters I have one, kept for an all too com-
mon reason, in which the sender, writing from Salonica in
1917, permits himself a mild grumble at the ignorance of
England about what the M.E.F. had done in face of un-
guessed obstacles. To some extent even now, when a so
brilliant success has rewarded this patient effort, the same
ignorance still survives. The Macedonian Front has thus far
produced fewer books than any ; and for this reason alone
the present volume should have its welcome secure. Not
that you must expect any very serious or weighty review of
the campaign from its pages; they are mostly light-hearted
sketches of places and persons and the conditions of Mace-
donian soldiering, told with a kind of school-boy, take-
what-comes humour that one likes to consider essentially
British. We have Salonica as a setting for work and play;
pen-portraits (including one of M. VENIZELOs), and an aero-
plane raid by the enemy upon a railhead—this last a finely
vivid piece of descrip-T -----
tion. I have used the
epithet “school-boy”
because it seems to
express at once the
attraction and limita-
tions of this little book,
of which the avowedly - -
humorous passages are RTſ: All /ºr " -
(to be quite frank) not
greatly removed from
the manner of the
school-magazine. But
| how far will that lessen
its interest for those
whose hearts have
dwelt, or may even
now be dwelling, vicari-
ously in the scenes of
which it tells? Very
little, I fancy.
The Year Between
(CASSELL) is one of
those stories in which,
with the best will in
| the world, I find it alto-
anything but an ingeni-L - - - -
ous exercise in the incredible. There are, for one thing, too
many coincidences; and far, oh but infinitely far, too much
illegal matrimony. January Ellice (whose name is none of
my fault) was one of those beautiful children of nature
who are not altogether outside the previous experience of the
hardened novel-reader. She was married—or so she thought
—to Bob; but as a fact he had already married Louie Craig
(at least he hadn't really, because Louie herself had been still
more previously married to one Gibbs). However all this
is to forestall Miss DoRIS EGERTON JONES with her dénoue-
ment, which, as I say, I found altogether too bigamous to
be believable. Not that the affairs of Bob much mattered,
since he got himself killed (very generously) in a mining
accident, and thus would have left January free to marry
the hero had it not been far too early in the book for this
happy event. I was a little surprised that John (that was
the hero's name) appeared to have no earlier wives; though
the young woman to whom he had been attached did her
best to supply the deficiency, and incidentally fill out the
book, by burning the lovers' letters and generally following
the accepted traditions of melodramatic jealousy. The Year

and amusing to those who demand only entertainment; but
if it even approximates to real life I must have been
strangely misinformed. -
Among War-products the literature relating to escapes
from German prisons is increasing very rapidly. One of the
most recent books on the subject is entitled My German
Prisons (Hodder AND STOUGHToN) and gives the adventur-
ous story of the escape of Captain H. G. GILLILAND.. He
and three other prisoners jumped for liberty and safety from
a trainin which they were being conveyed from the “hell-hole
of Ingolstadt"—the description is Captain GILLILAND's—
to Crefeld. After a series of the most extraordinary and
moving experiences Captain GILLILAND got over the
frontier and was soon after back in Blighty. I beg hereby
to salute him, for he is a very brave and gallant man, and
he had much to suffer from his German oppressors while
he was subject to their orders. The account of these indig-
- nities makes one's blood
boil. In the first sen-
tence of his book Capt.
GILLILAND smashes the
English grammar to
smithereens, but, so far
as I am concerned, he
|may have all the rules
of that grammar and
them. His narrative is
dramatic, not so much
by reason of any lurid
tricks as on account of
its cold and deadly per-
sistency, which leaves
unrevealed no item of
Hunnish brutality. A
man who has seen
| British wounded as
they lay helpless being
despatched by Germans
with the bayonet or the
butt is not likely to
dwell on the ameni-
| ties of the German
character. But Captain
GILLILAND is generous
- - - - - - — — — enough to miss no op-
portunity that offers of pointing out any spark of
humanity in the treatment by the Germans of their
British prisoners.

If you feel inclined to take an inexpensive holiday and
in an atmosphere very different from that of to-day, let me
recommend you to read Miss McFADDEN's His Grace of
Grub Street (LANE). Here we are back again in the days
of HoRACE WALPoLE, when literary hacks catered for
patrons, when men drank hard and plotted with almost
diabolical ingenuity to win the woman of their choice.
The hero of this energetic romance was a writer with a
conscience, who would rather starve (and he nearly did)
than do dirty work. So he fell foul of the villain of the
piece, a regular U-boat of a man, who would destroy anyone
or anything to get his way. I admit to a preference for
villains who have a few redeeming qualities, but Marsden
had none except that he had the good taste to fall heavily
in love with Clarissa. However this is a novel of action
rather than of character, and Miss McFADDEN knows how
to set things going from the start and keep them on the
move without visible effort.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PEACE NOTES.
To THE SULTAN OF TURKEY.
WE have just heard of your absolute
surrender. We do not affect to be
very sorry for you, but at the same
time we would not grudge you your
consolations. Of these (1) the thought
that you have let WILLIAM down badly
must be a source of considerable grati-
fication to you; and (2) it will be much
more comfortable for you when the
guns of the Goeben, hitherto trained
on your immediate neighbourhood, get
shifted. You are very welcome to both
these sources of solace.
To THE DUAL MoRARchy (IF ANY).
A telegram from Vienna recently
stated that your Count ANDRAssy had
resolved to initiate direct peace nego-
tiations with “Austro-Hungary's sole
antagonist, Italy.” War plays dread-
ful tricks with the memory and that
must be the reason why he forgot all
about Serbia. In the mental confusion
caused by so many declarations of war,
the fact that Austria opened the list by
attacking Serbia seems to have escaped
him. It has not however escaped the
Serbians, who have an admirable mem-
ory for detail and are prepared to furnish
you with all the reminders that you
need. Address, G.H.Q., Serbian Armies,
Belgrade. You remember Belgrade 2
Just across the Danube.
To THE Ex-TsAR of BUL.GARIA.
You were well-advised, my FERDI-
NAND, to secure early accommodation
at the Hotel des Rois en Exil before the
rush set in. We are afraid, however,
that the society in that select caravan-
serai threatens to be less exclusive than
you had hoped. There is talk, we hear,
of opening an annexe for fugitives other
than ex-monarchs: the Ludendorffs
and the Tirpitzes for instance, and quite
a long black visitors' list (if they can
get away); possibly even the Lenins
and the Trotskys. It should be a unique
menagerle.
To THE MANAGER of THE Wolff
BUREAU.
Now that the facts are out, you will
naturally have been arranging to close
your lie factory and look out for a fresh
field of usefulness. It may interest you
therefore to hear that the Allies do not
wish your superb organisation to be
wasted, but propose to utilise it, after
certain necessary changes, for the
dissemination of Truth among the
elementary schools of the Fatherland.
To THE WATCHERs on THE RHINE.
Among the suggested terms of the
armistice it is rumoured, as we write,
that along that section of the river
which flows within thirty miles of the
present frontier of Germany the Allies
intend to relieve you of your sentry-
duties. Later on, this relief will be
extended to all that portion of the left
bank which forms the boundary of
Alsace-Lorraine. This should save you
a lot of watching.
To A CERTAIN TYPE of PACIFIST.
We can't see what you have to
grumble at now that the prospects of
Peace are better than they have been for
several years. It looks as if you couldn't
love Peace so much if it weren't that
you love Germans more. What you
wanted was a German Peace; not the
| real bird, but a mock turtle-dove. Well,
you can't have it.
To A FooD PROFITEER. -
This collapse of the Huns' allies is
bad news for you. But don't be down-
hearted about the horrors of Peace.
The War may keep on yet for a bit.
Even when it's over we shan’t be flush
of food for a long time; and England's
difficulties will still be your oppor-
tunity. So cheer up.
|
To A PARTY Politici AN.
You are naturally elated at the pro-
spects of Peace. You want to be
finished with the futile distractions of
Armageddon which have temporarily
ruined your occupation and to get back
to the only serious purpose in life. We
fear you must wait. Peace, for the
first few years, will have its distrac.
tions no less profound than those of
War. Meanwhile this General Elec-
tion, at which from force of association
you neigh like an old charger long out
at grass, is going to be a very dull
thing for you. There will be no “man-
dates” except to the Old Guard to
carry on; nothing in your line.
To THE LAST GERMAN DoG.
No doubt your hair still stands on
end when you recall the declaration
made by the KAISER, or one of his gang,
to the effect that the Fatherland would
fight to the last cat and the last dog.
But to-day the outlook seems rather
rosier for you. After all you may not
be called upon. Of course it hadn't
yet come to being a very near thing
for you, with so many human Huns
and other dogs still left alive; but all
the same we can understand your
sense of relief.
To THE LAST GERMAN CAT.
See foregoing remarks. O. S.
Tact.
“Officials of the Bank are bound to Secrecy
in regard to the ransactions of any of its
Customers.” -
From adrt. of a Bank in a S.A. paper.
CHINA BLUE.
SAPPHIRE hills and a turquoise sky
Looked their bluest when you and I
(The happiest two in China)
Stopped as the pack-mules passed and
laughed
At the big blue tassels fore and aft,
For everything's blue in China.
Riding together side by side
We saw the chameleons sport with
pride
The Cambridge hue in China,
And butterflies of a dingier glint
Flouting before us the rival tint,
For everything's blue in China.
Down by the river the coolies squat,
Their little blue bowls all piping hot
With the tea that they brew in China;
Their trousers are tattered and cut too
high, , , - -
But the colour's the colour of cloudless
sky, , , -
For everything's blue in China.
From the tamarind boughs blue orchids
swing,
Blooms that a Mandarin might bring
To the maid he'd woo in China;
Blue as the silk of her tangled skeins,
Blue as the blood in his throbbing
veins,
For everything's blue in china.
And oh, little girl, how we laughed to
find
That nursery stories of every kind
Are perfectly true in China,
Where Blue Birds shimmer and beans
grow tall
And grim grey buffaloes heed the call
Of a little Boy Blue in China.
And when Aladdin himself you saw
In the tightest trews and a mushroom
Straw
Smiling at you in China,
Your face lit up with a glad surprise,
And I knew, when I looked at your
dancing eyes,
That there's nothing so blue in
China.
Another Impending Apology.

Visitor (to Tattoo artist). “THEIR NAMEs Is Both BILL, so THAT AND THE "EART AND THE ‘TRUE LovE' wiDL BE ALL RIGHT; BUT
would IT cost MUCH To TURN THIS MAPLE-LEAF INTO A KANGARoo?”
A LITTLE CHILD.
Owing to War's vicissitudes it was
decided that the governess-cart must
be given up; and this meant that a
new owner for Polly must be found.
Polly is a roan pony; very round in
the barrel, and particularly so of late,
when there has been no food but mea-
dow-grass. She had been with us so
long as to become, as ponies peculiarly
can, a member of the family, so that
to part with her savoured of treachery.
War, however, changes all, excuses all,
and the horrid preparations were there-
fore begun. The first was the framing
of the advertisement, which is not the
simple matter that it might appear to
be, because so much depends upon the
right choice of adjective. The word
selected must both allure and (in our
case) keep within the bounds of truth.
What are the qualities most valued
in a pony, we had to ask ourselves.
Celerity? Polly was fixed in her de-
termination not to exceed the speed
limit, at any rate on outward journeys.
Willingness? Polly could be desper-
ately stubborn. Strength 2 Yes, she
was strong. Youth 2 Well, she came
to us ten years ago and she was no
foal then. After much serious deliber-
ation, compared with which the Wer-
sailles Conferences are mere exchanges
of persiflage, it was decided to describe
Polly either as “strong useful pony”
or “useful strong pony.” Further de-
liberations fixed the phrase as “Pony,
strong, useful,” and the advertisement
was despatched to the local rag, as our
very worthy county chronicle is too
often called.
Next came the question of what
price was to be asked. Here expert
opinion was resorted to, in the shape
of Mr. Edmead, the butcher. No one
knows more about ponies than butchers
do, and Mr. Edmead is exceptionally
wise.
“Taking everything into considera-
tion,” he said, “I think that twenty-
five pounds would be a fair price.”
We clung to each other for support.
Twenty-five pounds ! And we had
given only nine pounds all those years
ago. Why had we not made pony-
breeding a hobby 2 The War, Mr.
Edmead went on to explain, had made
ponies more valuable. Yes, taking
everything into consideration, twenty-
five pounds was a fair price. We ought
to get that. In fact, if he had been in
need of a pony he would give that him-
self; but just then he was well supplied,
and Polly was, he feared, not quite fast
enough for him. Good morning.
Men who want to buy a pony bear a
strong resemblance to each other. They
are mostly clean-shaven and wear hard
round hats, and the collars of their
overcoats are carelessly treated so that
they are half up and half down. They
all carry sticks. Also, although they
wanted a pony, the men who inspected
Polly were alike in not wanting one at
quite such a figure, or indeed quite
such a pony at all. They were agreed
that she was no doubt a useful strong
pony, even a strong useful pony, but
she was not for them. Day after day
Polly was examined. They opened her
mouth and shook their heads, they felt
her knees and her hocks, they looked
at her with narrow eyes from near by
and from far, they rattled their sticks
in their hard hats, they gave her sudden
cuts and prods. But they didn't buy.
We began to get desperate. Much
as we esteemed Polly, now that she
was to be sold we wanted to be rid of
her. Things should be done quickly.
And then came a market gardener, a
large rubicund genial man named Fox.
And Polly was again led forth and
again subjected to every test known
to pony-buyers. All was going well,
and would have gone well, but for
Vivian. Who, you say, is Vivian 2
Vivian is a small boy who had known
Polly intimately all his life, and who
by some mischance wandered out from
his lessons in the morning-room at the
precise moment when Mr. Fox, who
obviously was attracted by Polly, was
making up his mind to pay the full

money. Vivian, I should explain, is one
of those ingratiating little-boys who
look upon the world as a sphere exist-
ing solely to provide them with friends
and who attach themselves with the
strongest bands to open-air manual
labourers. No sooner did Vivian see
Mr. Fox's benevolent features than he
added him to his collection.
“Run away, Vivian,” I said. “It's
not playtime yet, and we're busy.”
“Are you going to buy Polly?”
Vivian asked Mr. Fox by way of a
suitable rejoinder to my command.
“I was thinking about it,” said Mr.
Fox, adding to me, “How old do you
call her, ma'am 2 She looks to me
about twelve.”
The figure was so low that I nodded
assent, but Vivian spoilt it by ex-
claiming, “Oh, mother, and Mr. Brooks
says she's seventeen if she's a day,
and I’m sure she's a day.”
Mr. Fox became thoughtful. “Mr.
Brooks said that, did he ”’’ he re-
marked.
I felt that I couldn't tell Vivian
again to go in, because it would look
as though I feared his frankness; which,
to be candid, I did. All I could do
was to hope for the best.
“She's quiet enough ; used to traffic
and all that ?” Mr. Fox asked.
Then Vivian began to laugh. This
trick of laughter over retrospection—
chewing the cud of old jokes—we have
always rather admired in him; his
chuckles are very engaging; but now I
trembled; and not without reason.
“Don't you remember, mother,” he
began,
frightened by the traction engine and
ran into the grocer's shop?”
Mr. Fox, in whose large hand my
son's minute one was now reposing,
looked grave.
“That's against her in my business,”
he said.
“Oh, but,” I explained, “that was
a very long time ago. She's quite
steady now. Don't you remember,
Vivian, it was on your fifth birth-
day?”
“No,” said Vivian, “that was on my
seventh birthday—something funn
always happens on my birthdays,” he
explained to Mr. Fox—“it was on my
fifth birthday that Polly fell down.”
“that day when she was
“She's been down, has she?” said
Mr. Fox ominously. ..
The rest of it is too tragic. I had no
intention of concealing anything; Mr.
Edmead knew the pony's whole history
when he valued her; but Vivian's pre-
sence made me nervous, painfully self-
conscious; I felt my face burning and
knew that I must be crimson.
Mr. Fox, I will admit, played the
game. He asked Vivian no questions;
indeed he talked of other things than
defective ponies; but I could see his
mind working; I could see pound after
pound dropping away from the grand
total.
Well, that's the story. Mr. Fox led
Polly away some ten minutes later,
leaving in her stead a cheque. But it
was not for twenty-five pounds—Vivian
saw to that.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE STORY THAT WENT WEST.
“Why don't you write a war story?”
said Celia one day in October.
“Because everybody else does,” I
said. “I forget how many bayonets
we have on the Western Front, but
there must be at least twice as many
fountain-pens.”
“It needn't be about the Western
Front.”
“Unfortunately that's the only front
I know anything about.”
“I thought writers used their ima-
gination sometimes,” said Celia to
anybody who might happen to be list-
ening.
“Oh well, if you put it like that,” I
said, “I suppose I must.”
So I settled down to a story about
the Salonica Front.
The scene of my story was laid in an
old clay hut amid the wattles.
“What are wattles 2" asked Celia
when I told her the good news.
“Local colour,” I explained. “They
grow in Bulgaria.”
“Are you sure?”
“I'm sure that these ones did ; I
don't know about any others.”
Of course more local colour was
wanted than a mere wattle or two.
It was necessary therefore for my
Bulgarians always to go about in
comitadjis. Celia thought that these
were a kind of native trouser laced at
the knee. She may be right. My own
impression is that they are a species of
platoon. Anyhow the Bulgars always
went about in them. .
There was a fierce fight which raged
round the old clay hut in the wattles.
The Greeks shouted “Türro, römropat.”
The Serbs, for obvious reasons, were
inarticulate with rage. With the French
and British I had, of course, no diffi-
culty, but the Bulgars (again for obvious
reasons) had to content themselves
with hoarse guttural noises. It was a
fierce fight while it lasted, and I was
sorry when it was over, because for the
first time I began to feel at home with
my story. I need not say that many a
Bulgar had licked the wattles before I
had finished.
Unfortunately something else hap-
pened before I had finished. -
“What do you think?" cried Celia,
bursting into my room one evening,
just when I was wondering whether my
readers would expect to know more of
the heroine's native costume than that
it was “simple yet becoming.”
“Wait a moment,” I said.
“It's too good to wait,” said Celia
excitedly. “Bulgaria has surrendered.”
Celia may be a good patriot, but she
lacks the artistic temperament.
“Oh, has she?” I said bitterly.
“Then she's jolly well spoilt my
story.”
“The one about the wattles 2"
“Yes.” * *
“Tut-tuttle,” said Celia frivolously.
Well, I wasn't going to waste my
wattles. With great presence of mind
I decided to transfer my story to the
Palestine Front.
Under a hard blue sky of intense
brilliance the old clay hut stood among
the wattles. A wadi ran by the side of
it; not a small Turkish dog, as Celia
thought, but—well, everybody knows
what a wadi is. The battle went on
much as before, except that the Turks
were naturally more cutspoken than
the Bulgars, calling freely upon Allah
at the beginning of the fight and recon-
ciling themselves to the end of it
with “Kismet.” I also turned some of
the horses into camels, and (for the
sake of the Indian troops) several pairs
of puttees into chupaties. It was a
good story while it lasted.
However, nobody seems to care about
art nowadays.
“What do you think?” cried Celia,
bursting into my room.
I held up a delaying hand. I had
suddenly thought of the word “adobe.”
My story seemed to need it somewhere.
If possible, among the wattles.
“But listen!” She read out the head-
line: “Turkey Surrenders at Discre-
tion.’”
“Discretion' " I said indignantly.
“I have never heard of anything so
tactless. And it isn't as though I could
even move on to Mesopotamia.”
“Couldn't there be a little local rising
in Persia?” suggested Celia.
“I doubt it, I doubt it,” I said
thoughtfully. “You can't do much
with just wattles and a little sherbet—
I mean you can't expect the public to be
interested in Persia at such a moment
as this. No, we shall have to go west-
wards. We must see what we can do
with the Italian Front.”
But I had very little hope. A curious
foreboding of evil came over me as I
placed those wattles tenderly along the
west bank of the Piave. The old clay
hut still stood proudly amid them ; the
Bersaglieri advanced impetuously with
cries of “En avant l”—no, that's wrong
—with cries of — well, anyhow they
advanced. -
They advanced . . . -
And as I shut my eyes I seemed to
see—no, not that old clay hut amid
the wattles, nor yet the adobe edifice
on the heights of Asiago, but Celia
coming into the library with another
paper announcing that yet another
country was deaf to the call of art.

SILENT you face me in the gloom,
And shadows, like remembered things,
Haunt this familiar friendly room
As with unanswered questionings:
What shape shall life restored assume?
For you have seen dawn flush and fade
Along the devastated ridge,
Known hours when faith was weak to
aid .
The lonely stricken soul to bridge
The miry death-ways, unafraid.
And then the shell-burst and deep
night . . . -
So much you've told me, but the rest
Lies hidden safely out of sight
In the sealed chamber of your breast;
Maybe in darkness there was light.
And those were months of songlessness;
Never a rhyme you turned, you say;
It was enough to meet the stress,
To fill the measure of each day:
Even the Muse seemed pitiless.
But now in England, autumn-crowned,
, Soft-misted, splendid as of old,
Will the reviving spirit sound
New notes and soar to skies of gold,
Freed from the reeking battle-ground?
I wonder as I watch you there,
So changed, yet strangely so the
Same ;
I cannot guess what wandering air
Of home may stir your heart to flame
And set you singing unaware.
But now this silence suits you well;
There is no need of casual speech
Here, where your boyish memories dwell
On dreams not wholly out of reach—
Nearer perhaps than speech may tell.

The other day I received the sub-
joined account:—
October 29th.
To draining off water at the main,
taking to pieces the tap to hot-water
supply in bathroom, providing and
installing a new Wibble's Patent
“Non-Corros' Washer, No. 17522,
re-assembling parts of tap, testing
same, turning on water at main and
testing flow, when all was found
Correct . . . . . ... 7s. 9d.
This struck me as a decidedly stiff
bill for a new washer, so I wrote to the
head of the firm as follows:—
DEARSIR,--I have received an account
from your firm and can barely recognise
it as a setting-out of your only claim
against me.
You and I remember when this once
º spot was the haunt of flocks and
erds, and of a simple folk who spoke
and sometimes wrote the simple things
they meant to express in plain and
simple language. In those days the
document in question would, I fancy,
have read somewhat like this:—
8. d.
One rubber washer 0 4 (or possibly 6d.)
Fixing same . . 1 0 (or may be 1/6)
1 4 (or conceivably 1/6,
1/10 or at most 2/0)
In those golden days we lived and
worked in simple homes and called
our vocations by simple names. I
have a vivid recollection of your father,
one of the dearest friends of my youth.
It was his irreproachable putty, I
think, that first attracted me. The old
gentleman described the firm of which
he was the head as Plumbers and
Glaziers.
As I rose in the world, in more senses
than one, and developed from a simple
journalist and reporter for The Perham
Bois Advertiser into an author and
(vide my publisher) a man of letters, I
still continued my friendly relations
with the old gentleman, whose putty,
no doubt, was as seductive as ever, but
had, alas, lost its charm for me. Many
a yard, many a pound of ironmongery
and kindred wares passed from him to
me at the ruling rates (less 2% per cent.
for prompt cash, seldom forthcoming).
Many an hour did my friend's minions
spend in my house soothing angry
cascades in my cellars, curbing re-
factory gas in my drawing-room chan-
delier (how the lustres did jingle to be
sure!) and, later on, taming the electric
current for mv use.
But those days are gone. The cow-
bell has given way to the siren (not
Ulysses' semi-scaled temptress, but the
muezzin of daily toil), the Plumbers
and Glaziers have become Gas, Elee-
trical and Sanitary Engineers and High.

progress in this remote corner of the
world. I should be much interested to
hear your views on it, and remain,
Yours faithfully,
ADolphus ToweRs.
The head of the firm's views, judging
from the only reply I received, were
that the bill was Šk, and that my
cheque by return would oblige. I
sorrowfully concluded that my re-
miniscences had been wasted on this
champion of modern progress.

SHORTAGE OF FEEDING-STUFFs IN IRELAND.
Monday, October 28th.--The Com-
mons were all agog to see how many

cent decision to make “Strangers” of
| them. The response was quite satis-
factory. A lady was the first visitor
to the Gallery, and she was quickly
followed by a dozen more. The fair visit.
ants' headgear was a trifle efflorescent.
I hope it will not be necessary to add
to the Standing Orders an intimation
that ladies wearing hats more than
two feet in diameter or six inches in
altitude shall be deemed guilty of
obstruction and be forth with removed
to the Clock Tower.
The SPEAKER was not in his place,
his absence being due not to bashful-
ness, as the flippant affirmed, but to the
influenza. Members were but little
comforted by Mr. HAYEs FISHER's
assertion that bad as the epidemic was
here it was worse in Vienna; but they
were agreeably tickled by Mr. FIELD's
ingenuous suggestion that its ravages
might be reduced by an increase in the
meat-ration, for Mr. FIELD is a butcher
in private life. I am assured, however,
that the hon. Member who called out
INCONVENIENCES OF THE WAR.
“Nothing like leather” had no inten-
tion of reflecting upon the quality of
his wares.
The Irish agriculturist has for so
long been the spoiled darling of the
House that the Nationalist Members
had quite a shock when Major Astor,
referring to the shortage of feeding-
stuffs, said that it was “only fair that
Irish farmers should share some of the
inconveniences of the War.” This is,
indeed, a case of poetical justice, since
the shortage is due to the diversion of
ships to bring over American troops,
many thousands of whom could have
been spared if the Irish farmers' sons
had done their duty.
After a most eloquent exordium,
attributing most of the social evils of the
time to the want of decent houses, it
was something of an anti-climax for Mr.
HAYEs FISHER to bring in a Bill merely
improving the terms on which County
Councils could borrow money to house
their own employés. It was a pill to
cure an earthquake—that was the gist
of many hostile speeches.

wives Bill reappeared in the House of

Lords, three or four months after its
first introduction there. The delay was
due, Lord PEEL explained, to the fact
that in the first draft certain financial
clauses were not printed, as they should
have been, in italic type, a defect which
constituted a technical infringement of
the Commons' privileges. Was it for
this sort of thing that we turned the
Constitution upside down seven years
ago? Let us hope that when the new
women get into Parliament they will
rid us of the old ones'
In anticipation of the Commons' de-
bate several questions drew attention
to the contrast in the treatment of pris-
oners in England and in Germany. Sir
GEORGE CAve declined to admit that
the advantage was all one way. Ger-
man officer prisoners in this country,
for example, were restricted to a half-
bottle of wine per diem.
The debate itself was chiefly notable
for the moving speeches of Captain
CRAIG and Captain WILsoN, who have
experienced at first hand some of the
conditions of enemy prison-camps. The
Government was freely attacked for its
alleged supineness in coming to their

rescue. Lord NEwton in particular
came in for unmeasured abuse, his chief
crime, I fancy, being the possession of
a satirical tongue, which he has some-
times turned upon his critics. But,
save for vague talk of reprisals, a game
at which the Germans can play much
more effectively than we can, there was
little suggestion of any practical step
that Ministers had omitted to take. .
Wednesday, October 30th.-Mr. Bonar
LAw having literally flown away to
Paris, Sir GEorge CAve acted as Leader
of the House, and preserved his usual
judicial calm even when a Nationalist
Member asked him who would repre-
sent Ireland at the Peace Conference.
A more sarcastic Minister would have
met the question by another, “What
right has Ireland to be regarded as
a belligerent?” Sir GEoRGE merely
pointed out that it was too soon to say
who would be “the delegates of the
British Empire.”
When the Welsh Disestablishment
Act was placed upon the Statute-book
the Welsh County Councils cherished
visions of a rich haul of wealth from
the revenues of the Church in Wales.
But in order to secure it they have
to redeem the tithe rent-charge, and
as the value of tithe has risen, and
still tends upwards, they stand to lose
heavily by the transaction. An attempt

Thursday, October 31st.—A new
regulation forbidding members of the
Royal Air Force to wear their war-
service chevrons came in for severe
criticism, the general impression being,
I think, that some super-aesthete on the
Staff feared that they would mar by
their crudity the delicate colour-scheme
of the new uniform. The real object,
according to Major BAIRD, is to prevent
heartburning on the part of air-fighters
who had been kept at home to repel
Zepps and Gothas and therefore had
no right to chevrons given for foreign
service. Well, why not give them
chevrons too?
Apparently there is to be a §º
Election, but it will be a dulf affair.
The shortage of paper will only permit
candidates to send one small batch of
literature to each elector; nor will they
be able to make up for it by the vigour
of their personal canvass, for the allow-
ance of petrol will not be more than
eighty gallons, even in the largest con-
stituency. Opinions as to the desir-
ability of an election vary, of course,
but after to-day's announcement it may
be said with confidence that no one will
approach it with much spirit.

FROM THE GREAT EASTERN FR0 NT.
MY DEAR PERCY,+Soon you will be
examined by a ruthless medical board,
who will disguise the verdict of Home
Service with a coating of three weeks'
leave. You will then be sent to a
Battery on the coast to help keep the
crowd back in case the Huns try to
land.
You may think that service at home
is easier than in France; but don't be
deceived. Before I came I thought
that I was going to laze around in a
halo of chevrons and gold stripes, and
occasionally condescend to tell the
others how we did it “out there.” Do
I? No. It's they who swank and
it's I who lap up learning. Years of
fighting have made me for- -
get all my soldiering.
They take life awfully
seriously; one misses the
airy badinage that is so en-
gaging a factor in France
after one has mislaid a ||
lorry or blown agun to bits.
They're afraid even to
clean boots unless there's
an Army order stating how
much blacking is to be
used. Then they indent in
triplicate, please, on the
A.S.C., the Engineers, the
Ordnance, the Stationery
Office, the Barrack War-
den, the Veterinary Corps
and the Paymaster, please;
but they never get any
blacking until the men are
all under arrest for having
dirty boots and go to prison, |
The first morning I was here I
arose in the early dawn somewhere
about eight, put on a pair of gum-
boots and a muffler, and floated into
stables. It struck me there was some-
thing wrong, because the men were
more stand-offish than ever. The Ser-
geant cut me dead, and the Corporal
nearly killed me dead with a wheel-
barrow. My horse tried to bite me,
and I could see all the other horses
nudging each other as I went by. At
the corner I met the other Subaltern,
who looked almost as smart as a male
impersonator. Then I understood. His
polished boots made the worms sit up
and shade their eyes; he was wearing
yellow gloves and a duck of a cane;
you could have lit a cigarette at his

Sometimes we put all the guns in a
row and the wagons by the side of
them, and pretend we're slaughtering
enemies. The wagons should stay by
the guns, of course, but the other day,
on a bit of sloping ground, the horses
couldn't stop and one wagon went
right by. The drivers turned round as
soon as they could, went by on the
other side and came up again. Once

tempting to pull a heavy

But should one of the supply services
make a mistake and a tin of blacking
turn up, then there is a to-do. All the

Masonic ceremony called a board, and
one fine morning a day of public thanks-
giving is ordered; the tin is officially
blessed, christened with a bottle of
champagne, entered in the ledger, and
becomes part of the battery stores for
three years or the duration.
The punctilious deportment of the men
reminds me of a waiter I forgot to tip.
They've all got some form of St. Vitus's
dance that makes it impossible for them
to cease touching their hats. It took
me an hour to shave this morning, be-
cause I was at the window as they went
by to breakfast. I was so busy return-
ing their salutes that all the lather kept
congealing and blunted the razor. Some
day I shall break down on parade and
tickle the Sergeant-Major, and I shall
be led away amid the horrified glances
of the scandalized troops and interned.

hard as a ball-room floor. I went and
camouflaged myself in the refuse-heap

You remember how we used to plant
the guns in the ground like little seeds,
and use them for shooting shells at the
Bosch 2 I used to think that was the
reason for their existence, but here they
clean them up with plate powder, and as
soon as they're nice and tidy and have
clean pinafores on they take them out
for walks on the end of a string, with
rows of horses in front, just to show
the assembled populace why they are
buying War Bonds. This is called a
tactical exercise, and it's a jolly good
game. -
Then you have an Instructor who
gives you a scheme, say, that there are a
million Germans in front; two millions
behind have advanced from Wales ;
there is an impassable mountain on
the left, and the footlights on the right.
All the infantry are dead and buried,
the War Office is burnt down, and The

he, “Put some straw under those wheels
and they'll bite.” A gunner fetched a
huge armful, which he proceeded to
put down. Came a voice from behind:
“'E's given up all 'ope. Look, e's

You won't like this job, but you
shouldn't have been so thoughtless as
to get hit. You can't get firewood here
unless you buy it, because none of the

THE CHEAT.
I HAD just debouched from the Picca-
dilly Tube and was hastening along
Regent Street in the direction of a
favourite restaurant, wherein I hoped
to find something that would dull my
memory of the machinations of Jubilee
Jones, our mess cook, who by his own
confession had been in his previous
life nothing more than the assistant to
a haberdasher. I was possessed of a
mighty appetite and a new book of
coupons, so I hastened on with great
hopes. Suddenly a bulky form spread
itself before me.
“M'sieu ! M'sieu ! Would you be
so kind as to direct me to ze Sharang
Cross Station ?”
M'sieu would. M'sieu But have
you ever tried to direct anyone to
Charing Cross Station from half-way
up Regent Street? In the end I walked
along with him. It was quicker.
He was a very dear old man and the
skipper of a barquentine from the port
of Havre. Bristol, Plymouth and
Liverpool he knew well, but London
he had only visited once before. I
piloted him to the bottom of the Hay-
market—not quite the nearest way,
perhaps, but I was able to give him a
straight run in from there. We parted
with great ceremony and I retraced my
steps towards the restaurant.
On the way I met a man whom I
had last seen knee-deep in the old
salient at Ypres. Even he only suc-
ceeded in delaying me for a minute or
so. I strode on toward the vol-au-vent,
the poulet rôti and, who could say, per-
haps roast sirloin. Just as I reached
the door of my restaurant a large form
intercepted me.
“M'sieu,” it said, “would you be so
kind as to direct me to ze Sharang
Cross Station ?”
I do not know how he got there.
Neither did he. I felt the crisis of my
life had come.
“M'sieu,” I said impressively, “you
wish to go to Charing Cross Station,
and I wish to enter this restaurant and
eat. I will toss a coin and you shall say
either heads or tails. If you say right
I will take you to the very door of the
railway station, but if you say wrong
you shall come and dine with me.”
For a moment he demurred, and
then I tossed the coin.
“Tails' " he cried.
I curved my hand towards the dim
light of a lamp-post. It was a tail.
“M'sieu,” I said, “I shall have the
pleasure of your company to dinner.
You were fated to lose.”
Among the dinners of my memory
that one is, I think, the most enjoyable
of all. Afterwards I saw my guest
to the last inch of his journey to
Charing Cross, and parted from him
with, I am conceited enough to think,
reluctance on both sides.
But nevertheless I am painfully
aware of the fact that I am a common
swindler and cannot decide whether I
ought to confess to my commanding
officer or go to my end unshriven.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TRAFFIC AND DISCOVERY.
For two months Private Albert
Whiffen had been having what he
termed “a little bit of an 'oliday” in
front of a division which hailed from the
un-Prussian atmosphere of Southern
Germany. It was the most comfortable
sector in the whole line. Nothing ever
happened, and nothing seemed to be
about to happen. For most people
who, like Albert, had been campaigning
over half of Asia and most of Europe,
this state of peace would have sufficed.
But Albert was too volatile ; he required
an outlet for his exuberance.
“I'm writin' 'ome for a pair o' new
kid gloves,” he confided to a visiting
gunner; “we 'ad so many tea-parties in
our platoon last month that mine's
fair wore aht.”
One hot afternoon he unburdened
himself to an old friend, Private Hag-
gerty. -
“Mossy,” he said, “we might jest as
well be in Camberwell drinkin' a couple
o' glasses of six ale instead o' perishin'
of idleness in this blinkin' land of
'olly'ocks.”
At the magic name of ale, Private
Haggerty threw off the cobwebs of
his daydream and came smartly to
attention.
“Curious you talkin' abaht beer.
When I was back at the rooined chatoo
[Brigade Headquarters] the other day,
wotyer think I see?”
Albert shook his head.
“Beer.” " - . . . . .
Albert shook his head again, sorrow-
fully and incredulously. He expressed
the demeanour of one who has been
the victim of an ill-timed jest.
“I did. 'Undreds o' bottles, and a
blinkin' barrel with the tap in and a
corporal's guard watching over its con-
stitooshun like an 'andful of bees on
the wrong side of the 'oney pot . . .
most pathetic they was.” . .
“Look 'ere,” said Albert, “are you
playin' it orf on me?” -
Private Haggerty, in one sharp con-
clusive sentence, explained that, in spite
of all precedents, he had spoken the
truth. - - * *
The day following this conversation
Albert, labouring under the monotony
of inaction, clambered over the parados
and wandered about behind the lines
looking for souvenirs. He came across || -
some R.E. units erecting barricades
round several insignificant scars on the
soft earth, and putting up small notice.
boards with “dangerous” or some
other brief warning (according to taste)
written upon them.
For an old campaigner Albert re-
garded these erections with an unusual
amount of interest, and during the
remainder of the day he appeared to be
cogitating deeply.
Two nights later Private Haggerty
was awaked from a heavy sleep (so he
stated) by the perfume of beer. Having
made an ineffective search he roused
the other occupants of the dugout—two
with ease and the third with difficulty.
“Smell o' beer,” he remarked briefly.
There were four expert and deter-
mined sniffs.
“Garn,” said Albert, “that ain't beer;
that's the remains of one o' them gas
shells come to life. You go to sleep,
Mossy.”
Mossy, strongly supported by the
two other indignant connoisseurs, ex-
plained his exact attitude of mind to
a person who had intimated that he
(Mossy) did not know the smell of beer.
The following night the same thing,
except that Albert was not so easily
roused, occurred again.
- “You're 'aunted, Mossy,” he said
sleepily; “napoohed a lager-beer mer-
chant, that's wot you done.”
About this period there were certain
complaints at Brigade Headquarters
concerning a leakage in the stores. They
emanated from the Mess President and
involved a sergeant and several order-
lies, all of whom, having privileges of
their own, swore largely that this
matter must be put right.
One wet evening about ten o'clock,
an intelligent corporal, known as Puggy,
happened to be taking a short cut
through the group:of Öuthouses which
had been adapted for the convenience
of the H.Q.: mess. He was somewhat
startled and deeply shocked to stumble
upon an apparent stranger engaged in
filling a regulation pack with:the Brig-
ade bottled beer. The stranger, seen by
the dim light of a lantern, was wearing
a trench coat and a Staff Officer's cap,
so, the rules of the Service not being
framed to encourage the free inter-
change of ideas between corporals and
the Staff, Puggy carried on until he
came to the sentry at the other end of
the buildings. * .
“'Oo's the brass 'at wot's pinchin'
the Brigadier's pet noosance?” he said.
“Dunno,” replied the sentry, who
was not in any way a super-man. “'E
come 'ere a couple o' nights ago abaht
10.30 pip emma—must be a pal o' the
ole man's.” --
“Well,” said Puggy doubtfully, “I
never 'eard afore of a blinkin' Red Tab
collectin' bottled beer, our beer too, on
his own — 'specially at this time o'
night.”
The corporal's suspicions were so
strong that he sought out the mess
sergeant, who, with the recent depre-
dations still heavy on his mind, had no
doubts about the matter.
When they reached the sentry the
Staff Officer (also the beer) was a dis-
tant blur upon the shell-pocked road.
It was a long and arduous stalk, and
a good deal of mixed country had been
traversed before the mess sergeant
laid his hand upon the cold unfriendly
talons of a strand of barbed-wire—the
only obstacle between himself and the
General's beer.
At this juncture, strictly against regu-
lations, he flashed an electric torch.
It exposed the form of Private Albert
Whiffen, with a Staff cap on the back
of his head, seated at his ease within
the precincts of a small enclosure. He
was holding aloft a bottle of familiar
proportions, and the angle at which he
held it appeared to give him entire
satisfaction. Fastened firmly to a post
above an inconspicuous hole in the
ground that suggested possibilities as
a beer-cellar was a small notice-board,
upon which was inscribed in large
and unmistakable letters the legend,
“Unexploded shell.” *.
Private Albert Whiffen is at present
undergoing a term of fatigue which,
though salutary, is both menial and
unpleasant and in every way distaste-
ful to the greatness of his soul.
TURKEY'S NEED,
[The new Turkish Grand Vizier, in a speech
in Parliament last week, declared that Turkey
“had sustained many shocks and now needed
repose.”] - - -
“WEARY of pulling up our socks,
Of keeping time to German clocks,
Of German bullies and their “bocks,”
… Their insults and their blows;
Weary of giving up our stocks
Of food to German fighting-cc.cks,
Who treat us as their punching-blocks,
We Turkmen need repose.
“Weary of WILLIAM and the Fox
And ENVER the unorthodox,
Who ran us straight upon the rocks—
Authors of all our woes; .
Weary of bombs upon our docks,
Of patching up our naval crocks,
Of ALLENBY's resistless shocks,
We Turkmen need repose.”
Thus, longing vainly for the ease
That once was hers on land and seas,
Broken and beaten to her knees
By her indignant föes,
Enwrapped in ever-growing gloom
Turkey awaits the coming doom
Woven by Fate's remorseless loom,
And prattles of repose !

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A volume of reminiscences from Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD
has long been among what one might call les livres d faire,
and A Writer's Recollections (CoLLINs) comes, for various
reasons, at an opportune moment. Early memories of the
ARNoLDs at Fox How, of Oxford during its turbulent period,
of London in the eighties, and of the start and progress of
her own literary career—these make the chief matter of
Mrs. WARD's book; one that is always interesting and often
(perhaps rather unexpectedly) entertaining. Pace Mr. MAX
BEERBoHM, the writer's taste does not always confine her to
the “wholly serious;" on more than one occasion she proves
that she can even enjoy a joke against herself. To name
half the literary, educational and ecclesiastic great who
figure in Mrs. WARD's pageant would fill a formidable list
(a list incidentally that should be added to future editions;
without an index such a volume as this loses much of its
value as a companion for reference); and of each she has
some reminiscence, told with a skill that recalls them for a
moment to life. Sometimes the slightest pictures are the
most vivid; I shall not soon forget her sketch of Swinburne
scorching through a Balliol dinner-party with his back to
an over-generous fire. More tragic is the tale of the ignorant
burning of a first-folio Shakspeare, once the property of
Count GondoMAR and “covered with notes in a seventeenth-
century hand.” The report of this folio, seen casually as
marked for destruction in the weeding-out of a Spanish
library, sent the messenger, who had been only half aware
of its possible value, flying back from England to Spain on
an errand of rescue, only to find a library swept and gar-
nished and a librarian who peevishly refused to abide his
question. This is one of the stories for which no comfort
exists. I should have congratulated Mrs. WARD without
reserve upon her book if it had not been a little spoilt by
the inclusion of too many “testimonials” to her own work.
Miss MARJorie Bowen's latest historical miniature is a
vivid portrait of the unfortunate JULIE DE LESPINAsse.
The queer title, The Burning Glass (CoLLINs), is meant to
indicate the consuming fire of such a passion as inspired
and overwhelmed this wayward, generous and sometimes
outrageous lady. Miss BowFN has a conscience and gives
us the results of eager and intelligent reading, embroidered
with the workings of her own lively fancy. No doubt the
rather too frequent and detailed descriptions of JULIE's
dresses and furniture, suggesting a little too frankly the
inventory and catalogue, are due to a very human desire
not to waste authentic material laboriously gathered. The
important thing is that the author has succeeded in giving
life and movement (plenty of movement) to her heroine,
surely the most pathetic lover in history, with her tainted
birth, her disfigured face, her hurricane moods, her opium,
her phthisis, but withal her genius for love and her instinct
for friendship; and in a lesser degree to her betrothed, DE
MoRA the Spaniard, to her brilliant and something callous
lover, DE GUIBERT, and her faithful credulous D'ALEMBERT.
Miss BowFN moves cleverly through the maze of this
quadrilateral relationship, but she has not yet mastered the
mystery of the behaviour of the transitive verb and the
objective case.
There is a way of showing the action of a novel through
the eyes of one of its characters which makes you sure
from the beginning that nothing very bad can happen to

Mr. H. C. BAILEY uses it with the effect of
diminishing a little the interest of The Pillar of Fire

ston in England and GARIBALDI in Italy, with fighting
in Italy and politics in both
about, was one of PALMERSTON's secretaries and a Lieu-

Wings Triumphant (HUTCHINSON) is not a romance of the

one between Catholicism and the re-marriage of the divorced
I should have said that the heroine's problems were more
practically solved by the convenient demise of the previous
wife, which takes place just in time to bring the novel to a
a happy ending. Really Miss CECILIA HILL has written a
story in two parts, before and after August, 1914 (and if she
should retort that the story of the entire world is so divided I
shall attempt no denial), the first being concerned, originally

Lucius thinks cleverly too,

you have mastered the fact
that he speaks inside quo-

was at the soft answers

is one of those books which
have stilettos and brigands
and revolutions and revenge
and a rivederci in them ;
but, in spite of that, in a
quick competent fashion
that allows of no lingering
by the way, it offers very
good entertainment.
Mr. J. W. T. LEY is a
Dickensian. That is to say
he is an ardent enthusiast
for DICKENs and for every-
thing and everybody nearly
or remotely connected with
that great man. If anyone
smiles a smile or sneezes a

hear of it and put him in
his notebook. His ardour i

to tell her lover about the

him almost before he had entered his name) and a poli-
tician who never had a dog's chance. I rejoice that she
put the politician in his right place, if there is a right
place for a politician. It is difficult to know how it would
have finished if Hurst, who had a past, had not fought
himself clean. As it was, the War gave Miss YoUNG a
perfectly legitimate ending. Though her style still requires
attention she can both construct a story and tell it with
considerable power and charm.

HISTORY IN THE MAKING.
THE following retrospective journal,
which does not claim a precise accuracy
about the order of events, represents
a rough palimpsest of the impressions
left on the brain of an average reader
by the reports, anticipations and con-
tradictions of the Press during the
course of the last few weeks.
Monday.—The Wolff Bureau reports
that the Allies have sustained the
usual number of sanguinary repulses.
Tuesday.—LUDENDoRFF urges the
necessity for an armistice.
Wednesday.—Germany becomes a
Democracy. -
Thursday. — LUDENDoRFF protests
against the idea of an armistice.
Friday.—LUDENDoRFF resigns. The
KAISER accepts LUDENDoRFF's resigna-
tion. -
Saturday.—The KAISER abdicates.
LUDENDORFF accepts the KAISER's ab-
dication.
Sunday.—The Socialist party in the
Reichstag demands the abdication of
the KAISER. The KAISER says he will
be damned first. -
Monday.—The Socialist party in the
Reichstag retorts that, whether the
KAISER is damned first or last, he will
be damned anyhow and had better get
it over at once.
Tuesday.—The KAISER abdicates.
Wednesday.—The German Govern-
ment informs President WILson that
it is now in a position to negotiate
with him as a full-blown Democracy.
President WILson doesn't believe it.
Thursday. — The KAISER indicates
that he is entirely at the People's
disposal, and will abdicate or not
according as it suits the wishes of the
Fatherland. - -
Friday.—The Socialist party in the
Reichstag replies that it is a matter of
absolute indifference to the German
Democracy whether the KAISER elects
to abdicate or not.
Saturday.—The KAISER abdicates.
Sunday.—The German Democracy
becomes a Limited Monarchy. Im-
perial Crown offered to the CRowN
PRINCE's adolescent son.
PRINCE is not consulted in the matter.
Monday.—The KAISER announces
that, if it would suit the convenience
of the Reichstag, he will consent to
keep on for a bit at whatever personal
inconvenience.
Tuesday.—Kaiser KARL abdicates
after removing the family jewels.
Wednesday.—Kaiser WILLIAM re-
marks that it was a dirty trick on the
part of Kaiser KARL to desert a bro-
ther-monarch. He (Kaiser WILLIAM)
would sooner perish at the head of his
conquering army. -
The CRowN.
Thursday.—Tsar Boris abdicates.
Friday.—Kaiser WILLIAM wires to
TINo to secure for him the second-best
Royal Suite at the Hotel des Rois en
Exil, Switzerland. Kaiser KARL con-
tinues to abdicate.
Saturday.—Kaiser WILLIAM makes
alternative arrangements to lease a
château in Sweden.
Sunday.—The Higher Command de-
clares that the Fatherland will fight to
its last Hun. Uninterrupted continua-
tion of Peace pourparlers.
Monday.—The KAISER abdicates.
Tuesday.-The Socialist party in the
Reichstag reminds the KAISER that he
has hitherto ignored its invitation to
him to abdicate. The KAISER reminds
the Socialist party in the Reichstag
that he has already abdicated four
times and that there must be a limit
somewhere. Penultimate abdication of
the KAISER.
Wednesday.—The KAISER withdraws
by stealth to Headquarters in the dead
of night.
Thursday. — The KAISER arrives
openly at Headquarters in his capacity
of War Lord. The Higher Command
comments favourably on the robust
and cheerful appearance of the ALL-
HIGHEST.
Friday.—The KAISER compliments
his Army on its recent triumphs and
orders a white flag.
Saturday.—The KAISER abdicates for
the last time. -
Sunday.—The consensus of opinion
among German financiers, anxious to
cut their losses, is that it is high time
the KAISER abdicated.
Monday.—The well-informed Frank-
furter Zeitung states that in the matter
of the KAISER's rumoured abdication
nothing whatever has occurred beyond
“suggestions by suitable persons with
a view to procuring an expression of
the KAISER's will.”
Tuesday.—The KAISER announces
that his will remains the supreme law
and that while ready to do anything in
reason to facilitate the establishment
of a German Democracy he draws the
line firmly at abdication.
Wednesday.—Positively final abdica-
tion of the KAISE.R.
Thursday.—Arrival of the German
parlementaires under a white flag in
the French lines. Armistice signed at
London offices of a Press Agency.
Friday.—Armistice remains unsigned.
Saturday.—The War goes on as usual.
“Alluding to Turkey, he [Mr. Asquith] said
that, whatever epitaph was written upon its
tombstone, it certainly would not be the word
“Resurgum.’”—Newcastle Daily Journal.

Turkey has lost all its sticking-power.
ATHLETIC PROWESS.
A PEREMPToRY intimation to the
landlord that if he did not give the
dining and drawing-rooms another coat-
ing of paper the walls would collapse
brought Mr. Colver in person to investi-
gate. As a rule he shrank from meeting
his tenants, and in expansive moments
was wont to boast that by avoiding
them and “necessary repairs” he made
enough every year to erect a new
house.
The instant I saw him I knew that
he had come prepared to offer a firm
resistance, for his right hand was play-
ing nervously over his waistcoat.
“HDear me,” he murmured in his
most benevolent tone, “I have forgotten
my spectacles. I shan't be able to see
without 'em.”
It was an old dodge and my heart
sank. How often had I heard of Mr.
Colver's inability to detect unhealthy
brickwork, damp corners and bulging
window-frames because he had mislaid
his glasses. Inexperienced tenants had
hopefully accepted his promise to call
the next day and had bitterly regretted
their trust. Knowing all this I deter-
mined to insist upon conducting him
round the house myself and explaining
what I wished to be done.
“Nice lot of cups you've got there,”
he remarked as we stood in the dining-
room and I was expatiating upon its
demerits.
“Yes,” I said carelessly, “they're
not bad." I preferred to ignore his
amazed surprise. The sideboard cer-
tainly was a blaze of silver.
“Runnin', racin' and all that ?" said
Mr. Colver, staring at me now.
“That big one,” I answered depre-
catingly, “was won by a record walk
from London to Brighton. This is a
trophy of the Kingston Regatta. Most
of the others also commemorate aquatic
triumphs. These two however,” I added
modestly, “signify that the holder was
the champion of the rifle club during
the years 1912 and 1913. The silver
statuette was a second prize at the
Basher Amateur Boxing Club's last
assault-at-arms."
“Wonderful!" exclaimed my land-
lord. “If I may say so without givin'
offence I suppose you must be quite
forty?”
“Forty-four,” I said, anxious to con-
vey the impression that it was only my
age that kept me out of khaki.
Half-dazed by his admiration for his
athletic tenant, Mr. Colver was as clay
in my hands. He agreed to everything,
thanks to the presence of the glittering
cups, and the bathroom and kitchen
were deftly added by me to the list of
repairs. When I told Daphne later

she declared that I was a wizard, but
her surprise was nothing to that of Mr.
Colver's other tenants. They positively
gasped when the men came to do the
work.
A year later I saw Mr. Colver again,
but in vastly different circumstances.
He was now sitting as chairman of the
local tribunal, and I, called to the
colours at the age of forty-five, was
eloquently explaining to him and his
fellow-members why I ought not to be
sent into the army. I told how I had
led a sedentary life for a quarter of a
century, added various details of a
distressing nature from my medical
history, and, despite the fact that Mr.
Colver's stare was one of pained sur-
prise, affirmed that I should be an ex-
pensive wastrel if taken from civil life.
My landlord delivered the verdict of
the tribunal.
“You must join up in a month,” he
said tersely.
I tried to gain time.
“Leave to appeal refused,” he re-
torted, and the next case was called.
Returning from the station the follow-
ing evening I saw Mr. Colver ambling
ahead of me and I immediately accosted
him.
my case?” I asked, brushing aside his
apologies.
“I'm sorry,” he answered, gradually
becoming severe; “I didn't like to men-
tion it openly at the tribunal because
the information had reached me pro-
fessionally as it were and you might
have regarded it as a breach of con-
fidence.”
“What do you mean?” I exclaimed.
“You've evidently forgotten,” he said
solemnly, “that you once showed me a
dozen cups you'd won at walkin', row-
in’ and runnin'. Do you think I was
goin' to keep out o' the army a chap
what had won cups for shootin' a year
or two before the War? Likewise a
statoo for boxin’? You'll be a credit
to the country, mister, and I don't
regret havin' done more for your house
than I intended to. It'll be easier to
let if you want to get rid of it.”
He passed on, leaving me to realise
that it was now too late to explain to
him or to anyone else that the cups had
not been mine at all. I had merely
taken care of them for my opposite
neighbour whilst he and his family had
been at Bournemouth.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WELL-CONDUCTED FAMILY.
Demetrius is a noble old fellow ;
there is something of dignity in his
bearing, a stateliness of carriage that
seems to belong to the courtly times
that we of these unquiet days are
leaving so far behind. The presence
of Demetrius would quell the flippancy
of even the gayest and brightest of our
judges. He commands the respect of
all who know him. .
Demetrius is a hedgehog, and he has
a wife, Boadicea, and an offspring,
Peter. Their home is underneath the
summer-house, and every evening
during the summer they used to take
the air upon the tennis-lawn, Demetrius
leading, Boadicea a little behind him,
and Peter trotting along a yard or so
in the rear. They are a highly respect-
able family, and very strict with Peter.
Demetrius is a parent of the stern old-
fashioned school; I am sure Peter
always addresses him as “Sir.”
Peter is a dear little chap, full of fun
and frolic, and though they never show
it his parents are really very proud of
him. They have taught him to roll
up compactly into a bristly ball at the
approach of suspected danger, and he
does it extremely well for a youngster.
They are very particular about his
manners also. Peter, when quite a
small hedge-pigling, was inclined to
eat a trifle noisily—I suppose it is no
light achievement to be able to masti-
cate a black-beetle with the decorous
silence becoming a well-bred hedge-
hog-and Demetrius was determined
to eradicate this fault. He would lec-
ture Peter austerely; one could almost
hear the severe terms in which he
pointed out how this habit was not
only a social depravity but also dis-
tinctly unpatriotic, as hinting at a lean-
ing towards the manners and customs
of the Central Empires. If Peter were
recalcitrant he was made to go and stand
in the corner of the lawn with his face
to the garden roller in disgrace; but he
quickly mastered his failing. Before
long he could munch a May-bug in the
most exemplary pianissimo.
Boadicea is a sweet but rather faded
little woman, entirely devoted to her
husband and son. She must have been
very pretty as a girl, for even now
there is a lissom grace about her figure
that one does not see in many hedge-
sows of her age. She is a great hun-
tress and possessed of a considerable
turn of speed. I have seen her run
down a wire-worm on the level; and
she is very quick at the kill. I don't
remember having seen anything to beat
her even at a Waterloo Cup meeting.
and we see nothing more of them until
the following spring. This year Peter
seemed very loth to go; I like to think
of him as pleading to be allowed to
sit up “just one more week, please,
Mother.” But he as well as his par-
ents was beginning to look very sleepy
towards the end of September, and
soon the tennis-lawn knew them no
more. I expect when they come down
to breakfast next April Peter will be
| getting quite a big boy.
And what a surprise for them when
they find the War over.
PRIVATE PEACE PLANs.
IN response to a circular request from
Mr. Punch, asking various persons of
eminence to state what they intended
to do first on the arrival of Peace,
the following replies have been antici-
pated:—
Lord NorthcLIFFE.-I find it diffi-
cult at the present moment to answer
your question with exactitude; but
doubtless, whatever else I may do when
Peace comes, I shall make my presence
felt. A good deal, however, depends
on whether or not Germany accepts
my terms.
THE FUEL CoNTROLLER.—I shall do
my best to induce the War Office to
get the miners back first of all. But
it sounds too sensible.
PRESIDENT WILsoN.—I think I shall
be a little disappointed. I wanted the
world made safe for Democrats, not for
Republicans.
BERNHARDI.—I shall complete my
book entitled Mistakes of the War of
1914-18, and How they may be aroided
in the Nert.
A CoNscIENTIous OBJECTOR.—I shall
go abroad for a change of air.
SIR HENRY DALZIEL.—I shall take
another walk down Fleet Street with
my pockets full of money.
MR. ARNOLD BENNETT.—I will let
you hear again as soon as I have
made up my mind whether or not to
refuse a title.
MR. Asquith.-The lessons of his-
tory, and there is, if I may say so, no
better instructor, inform us that the
inauguration of a lasting and equitable
peace is invariably followed by a revival
of partisan activity. In so far then as
my other avocations permit I shall,
with the valued co-operation of my
political friends, fling myself once more
and with renewed vigour into the clash
of parties at Westminster.
MR. I.YttoN STRAchey.—I shall
Every autumn, Demetrius leads his sharpen my pen, mix a little more acid
family to bed under the summer-house with the old blue-black, and get to
work on some eminent Edwardians and
Georgians.
MRs. HUMPHRY WARD.—I shall sub-
ject the works of Mr. H. G. WELLs
and Mr. LYTTON STRAchey to a delight-
ful re-reading.
MR. BERNARD SHAw.—I shall at once
take steps to get my name again, and
more sympathetically, before the public.
SIR ALFRED BUTT.-I shall concen-
trate on the production of a new revue
dealing with the new era, and having
some such witty and original title as
What ho, Utopia /
CAPTAIN P. F. WARNER.—I shall
organise a grand spectacular irrespon-
sible cricket match, with no wicket-
keep and fourteen points.
A PACIFIST-I shall find time hang
very heavy on my hands.
CRAB-APPLE.
I DREAMED the Fairies wanted me
To spend my birth-night with them
all ;
And I said, “Oh, but you're so wee
And I am so tremendous tall,
What could we do 2"
“Crab-apple stem "
Said they, and I was just like them.
And then, when we were all the same,
The party and the fun began;
They said they'd teach me a new game
Of “Dew-ponds.” “I don't think I
call
Play that,” I said.
“Crab-apple blue!”
Said they, and I could play it too.
And then, when we had played and
played,
The Fairies said that we would
dance; * -
And I said, “Oh, but I'm afraid
That I've no shoes.” I gave a glance
At my bare toes.
“Crab-apple sweet!”
Said they, and shoes were on my feet.
And then we danced away, away,
Until my birth-night all was done;
And I said, “I’ll go home to-day;
And thank you for my lovely fun,
I'll come again.” .
- “Crab-apple red ' "
Said they, and I woke up in bed.
Another Impending Apology.
From the report of a Prisoners of
War Committee:—
“We are now making a change in the pack-
ing arrangements, and instead of six 10lb.
parcels per month, we shall send a weekly
15lb. parcel, this by special concession of the
Postmaster-General, who has raised the weight
limit in our favour. He tells me he is in the
mental ward at present, but is quite all right.”

The clamouring trumpets break oblivion!
Not as we dreamed, nor as you strove to do,
The strait is cloven, the crag is made our own;
The salt grey herbs have withered over you,
The stars of Spring gone down,
And your long loneliness has lain unstirred
By touch of home, unless some migrant bird
Flashed eastward from the white cliffs to the brown.
Hard by the nameless dust of Argive men,
Remembered and remote, like theirs of Troy,
Your sleep has been, nor can ye wake again
To any cry of joy;
Summers and snows have melted on the waves,
And past the noble silence of your graves
The merging waters narrow and deploy.
But not in vain, not all in vain, thank God,
All that you were and all you might have been
Was given to the cold effacing sod,
Unstrewn with garlands green;
The valour and the vision that were yours
Lie not with broken spears and fallen towers,
* With glories perishable of all things seen.

Children of one dear land and every sea,

Her silent sons into her arms once more.
For Services Rendered.
This is our Merchant Seamen’s “Gift Week.” The
Silver Thimble Fund, which has already collected £47,000
for War Charities, is asking for gold and silver and all
other kinds of jewellery to be sent to The Silver Thimble
Depót, 160A, New Bond Street, W., in the hope of raising
£10,000 to endow a ward in the Seamen's Hospital, Green-
wich. Mr. Punch can think of no better way of celebrating
a victorious Peace than by a practical proof of our gratitude
to the Service that has done so much to bring it about.
Miss Eva MooRE has arranged a Matinée, to be given at
the Alhambra on Sunday, November 17th, at 3 P.M., in
aid of the Kensington War Hospital Supply Depôt, to
whose admirable work Mr. Punch has more than once
paid tribute. Among those who have kindly promised
to appear are Mrs. PATRICK CAMPBELL, Lady TREE,
Miss Lottie WENNE, Miss Violet LoBAINE, Miss CIssie
Loftus, Mr. Countice Pounds, Mr. Owen NAREs, Mr.
LAURI DE FRECE, Mr. ARTHUR WonTNER. Tickets, which
range in price from 21s, to 1s. 3d., can be obtained from
Miss Eva MooRE, 13, Kensington Square, W.8 (Telephone,
Western 1807), or from the National Sunday League,
34, Red Lion Square, W.C.1. (Telephone, Holborn 1524).

Monday, November 4th-Both the
SPEAKER and the LEADER of THE House
havechosen toput forward their amazing
proposition that Britain should not be
allowed to enter the Peace Conference
until she had granted Home Rule to

faction of everybody, and particularly the hopeless task of trying to rekindle
of the lady visitors, some of whom, it in a thin House the dying embers of monarch uncoiled himself from the seat
is reported, had threatened to sue the Liberal enthusiasm, damped almost to
management if the star-per-
formers continued to absent
themselves.
The FooD-ContRo1.LER has
decided to fix a maximum
price for eggs. Some Mem-
bers greeted this decision
with derisive cries of “No
more eggs l’” but others con-
sidered it a timely precaution
in view of the imminence of
a General Election.
Another sign of the times
is the offer of a certain Con-
servative Association to pro-
vide its subscribing members
with free insurance against
accidents in public vehicles.
This was vehemently con-
demned as unfair by General PAGE extinction by Irish apathy about the
CRoPT, the leader of the “Nationals;”
his objection, I understand, being that
the insurance does not cover Third-
Party risks.
The growing disrespect for estab-
lished institutions is exciting alarm
in Government circles. Lord HENRY
BENTINck actually had the temerity to
ask this afternoon, “Is it not possible
to take Lord NoFTHCLIFFE a little too
seriously?” and some Members
laughed. Where is this sort of
thing going to end?
The Bill to render women elig-
ible for the House of Commons
passed its second reading without
a division. But more than one
Member expressed fears lest the
charms of public life should prove
more alluring than matrimony to
gifted women. Sir HEDworth
MEUx's picture of a future Prime
Ministress, distracted between the
rival claims of the Cradle and the
Cabinet, was drawn with strokes
so broad as to bring down upon
him an austere rebuke from both
Front Benches.

help from Mr. AsquitH and Mr. SAMUEL
he could not blow it into a flame. In
fact such heat as the debate engendered

Irish home-truths about their conduct
during the War in language almost as
vehement and volcanic as their own.
their chastisement more quietly than is
their wont. Mr. DILLON indeed seemed
chiefly annoyed with Sir Edward CAR-
soN's silence, and declared that he
was now “King CARSON and lord and
master of Ireland.” Whereupon the
whence he had watched the debate and
quietly observed, “May I say
that this is the tenth year of
s my reign 2" — a useful re-
minder that Liberals as well
as Tories had failed to find a
solution for the Ulster part
of the Irish problem.
§ The Resolution was watered
down in deference to the ob-
jections of some British Home
Rulers, but even in its diluted
R form was supported by only
NNN 115 Members, including Nat-
ionalists, Pacifists, and a few
Liberal ex-Ministers, and was
defeated by a majority cf 81.
Wednesday, November 6th.
—Woman's triumphal march
continues. True, Mr. MAC-
PHERSON said it was impossible, with-
out legislation, to grant commissions to
lady-doctors employed in military hos-
pitals, and there was no use therefore
in “camouflaging” them—his word, not
mine—with pips. But as a solatium
the House decided that, though Woman
may not vote until she is thirty, she may
write herself M.P. (if she can find an
obliging constituency) at twenty-one.

the inclusion of clergymen within its
scope. But the clergy will hardly thank
him for the implied comparison. They
are rather tired of jokes about “the
clerical sex.”
The mysterious relations of Lord
NorthcLIFFE to the Ministry of In-
formation aroused the curiosity of many
Members. Mr. PRINGLE, while prais-
ing his recent forecast of the peace
terms as “reasonable and moderate,”
could not understand how he was al-
lowed to put it forward as a private
individual. Sir Edward CARSON in-
veighed against the impropriety of a
subordinate official of one Ministry
being allowed to attack the head of an-
other, as Lord NorthCLIFFE had done
through his newspapers in the case of
Lord MILNER ; while Mr. DILLON de-
clared that the Napoleon of journalism
was at his old tricks and using private
information to obtain the reputation of
a prophet.
Mr. BALDw1N's defence was that
“Napoleons will be Napoleons.” Mr.
DILLON, he said, seemed to desire the
appointment of a “Northcliffe Con-
troller”; but that was impracticable.

REPRISALS.
THAT ass Ellis has tried several
times to prevent me from serving my
King and country. At the time of
writing he has failed. But I can't
promise to be alive when you see this,
because he is very persistent.
Why the authorities decided that I
must do an anti-gas course I don't
know. But they did; and the first
person that I met at the local H.Q.
(Gas) was Ellis.
H.Q. (Gas) is divided into two parts
—the Gas Chamber and the Gas Ante-
Chamber. Add to these the Gas Colour-
Sergeant, the Gas Corporal, several
different kinds of gases, two gas-
masks, and finally, of course, Ellis and
me, and you have the T -
scenery, properties and
cast complete. I am
the hero and the Colour-
Sergeant is the villain;
the clown's part is
naturally reserved for
Ellis.
The first scene is laid
in the Gas Ante-Cham-
ber, and when the cur-
tain rises we see the
Gas Colour - Sergeant,
ably assisted by the Gas
Corporal, generating
the Ante-Chamber gas
for all he is worth. This
form of frightfulness
need not necessarily
prove fatal if taken in
moderate doses; in fact,
as far as I know, its
worst symptoms are
yawning and an intense
desire to sleep. It in-
cludes a short descrip- -
tion of the gases affected by Fritz, a
ghastly attempt at the scientific nomen-
clature of their component parts, and a
vast mass of undigested facts concern-
ing their whims and habits. When the
Colour-Sergeant had to stop for more
oxygen the Corporal carried on, until
Ellis floored him with some more than
usually impossible question. On the
whole I think Ellis generated more gas
than either of them; but I am not sure,
because I succumbed to the very first
whiff, and only woke up at lunch-time.
At lunch, feeling that Ellis had made
a bigger fool of himself than usual, I
determined to read him a lesson. I
began as follows:—
“Ellis, old man, have you made your
will?” .
“No," said Ellis in a startled voice.
“Why?"
“Really,” I answered seriously, “I’m
THE FLU.”
feeling particularly strong I'll tell you
what happened at my last course.”
Ellis §. “Go on,” he mur-
mured between clenched teeth.
“Well,” I continued, “you know
how important it is that one's gas-mask
should be a perfect fit?”
Ellis only modded. He was beyond
words.
“So important is it,” I went on,
“that they will only test your mask
while you are actually in a strong con-
centration of gas; in short, in the Gas
Chamber itself. Masks were served
out and we were thrust at the bayonet's
point into the fatal room. When the
Colour-Sergeant and the Corporal came
in to see how we were getting on, they
found me pale but confident, for luckily

came to the other man, ‘Corporal,'
said the Colour-Sergeant, ‘I'm afraid
you've been careless again. This man's
mask doesn't fit properly. There must
be a leak somewhere.’ “Sorry, Sir,"
replied the Corporal, “but 'e 'ad such
a funny 'ead I couldn't do nuffink wiv
it.' Now I come to think of it, Ellis,
the slope of his forehead and chin was
just like yours. . . He was as dead as
mutton,” I added sadly.
Jºllis swooned.
That afternoon they fitted us with
gas-masks in the open air. Even Ellis
was satisfied with the fit of his. Still,
º lesson had done him good, for he
seemed very thoughtful and talked far
less than usual.
During the next few days we sniffed
at mustard gas, wept at tear-gas and
sneezed at sneezing gas. We learnt

my mask fitted me. But when they
apples; also several other facts which
I have mislaid. Once or twice I caught
Ellis looking at me in that spiteful way
of his, and he seemed to be pretty thick
with the Colour-Sergeant. By the
occasional nods and winks that I inter-
cepted I judged they were enjoying
some futile joke together. Just like Ellis
to demean himself with his inferiors in
rank.” -
At length the day arrived for the
grand finale—the actual test of five
minutes all alone with one's fears and
one's mask in the Gas Chamber. “A
concentration of chlorine,” said the
Colour-Sergeant, “that would kill you
in a minute but for the gas-mask.”
Ellis went first. He had to be half-
pushed through the fatal door that led
- T - from the Gas Ante-
chamber to the lethal
à apartment. Personally
I didn't think he took
it at all well; but then
what could one expect
from a fellow like Ellis?
Five minutes passed
|-ten minutes. I was
just wondering whether
I had not better boldly
enter and extract the
erring Ellis ere it was
too late, when in came
the Gas Colour - Ser-
geant and hustled me
rudely towards the
door.
“Your turn, Sir,” he
said grimly.
Cool though I was,
I hesitated a moment
before I took the plunge.
But only for a moment.
Murmuring the words,
— “An officer and a gen-
tleman "I took a deep breath through
my respirator—“the last pure air,” I
thought, “that I may ever breathe on
earth.” Then I proudly flung open the
portal, entered, and with equal firmness
closed the door behind me.
I was in a small and barely-furnished
room. It was but dimly lit by a sloping
skylight in the roof. A plain deal table
and two wooden chairs stood against
one wall, while opposite, on a steel
platform in shape not unlike an ordinary
kitchen range, stood the gas-cylinder,
a stumpy iron affair, from which the
venomous gas was hissing through a
small hole near the top.
And that was all. But horror! what
was that dark bundle in the corner that
lay so still? Even before I rolled it
over, instinct told me the whole dreadful
truth. It was Ellis'

rubber nozzle in my mouth. I yelled
again, thereby filling the mask with air
and blowing off the nose cap.
And then, faint and subtle, came the
smell. Gently, irresistibly, it forced its
way through rubber and chemicals and
all. So I was done for—cut off in the
prime of my health and beauty. I
sobbed aloud, then grew strangely
calm. I knew now there had been
some hideous mistake. This was no
chlorine. It was the deadly mustard
gas ; for the smell was the smell of
onlons.
“They have lied to me,” I murmured.
“The mask will not save me here.”
So saying, I sank to the ground and
knew no more.
A roar of laughter woke me. I
opened my eyes. Ellis was standing
in the middle of the room, braying like
the silly ass he is. The Colour-Sergeant
and the Corporal were sitting by the
table. A white cloth had been spread
and on the centre reposed the gas
cylinder, open now but still emitting
fumes.
Then it burst upon me that this
couldn't be the Gas Chamber after all.
“The Chamber 1 "I gasped. “Where

The Colour-Sergeant pointed his well-
loaded knife towards the door I had
entered by.
“The little room on the other side
of the Ante-Chamber,” he said, and
deftly flicked the knife-load into his
mouth. - -
“I wish they'd give us tripe and

CONVERSATION ON CHAPTER XCIV.
George. There are two things I don't
quite understand. How is it that Swit-
zerland, which has always been a re-
public, was full of kings and emperors
at this time? And why did they
have such funny names—“Tino" and
“Ferdie" and so on ?
Mrs. M. Your perplexity, my dear
George, is quite intelligible. Switzer-
land was invaded by sovereigns, but
they did not reign in Switzerland. They
were attracted by the salubrity of the
climate and other potent considerations,
in which the instinct of self-preserva-
tion predominated. As I remarked to
you on a former occasion there is an
involuntary sympathy which one feels
for the unfortunate, and the sufferings
of exiled families naturally appeal to
the generous instincts of ingenuous
youth. But compassion needs to be
tempered with justice, and few of these
sovereigns were worthy of unstinted

MY DIARY.
It is absurd to say that we were unaffected by the War.
I myself, for instance, had become a Volunteer quite early in
the revived career of this particular branch of His Majesty's
service. I had suffered the slings and arrows of an out-
rageous sergeant-major, who dealt with us on the square
at Chelsea Barracks as if we were a pack of small boys
in our first term at school. -
“Don’t touch your fice!" he would roar. “Don't touch
it, I tell you. It's marked out for the beauty prize, and
you can't improve it, no matter what you do.”
This was perhaps one of the mildest pieces of well-studied
sarcasm that Sergeant-Major Batten hurled at his squad
of Volunteer Officers. Those who enjoyed the amenities
of the Chelsea Barrack square were supposed to go back
to the centres from which they came and spread the latest
military knowledge over the rural districts of England. ,
But it was not to talk of Volunteering that I began this
article. It was in order to draw your attention to my
diary, and to show you how this inanimate thing gradually
wrapped itself up in the War and ceased to take an interest
in anything else. I can only explain what I mean by telling
you that it became infused with a sort of life of its own,
and many a time I caught it nudging me when I wished to
set down any of the ordinary bald statements that are to
be found in every self-respecting diary. It tried, I am sure,
to withdraw itself from my writing-table, or, failing that,
to get itself lost under an accumulation of papers, or to
cross the nibs of my favourite pens, or commit some other
perversity. At the time I tried to explain these actions
on rationalistic theories. Now I know better and am sure
that my diary was absorbed in the War, and was trying
to prevent me from writing about anything else.
So matters went on until the Spring of this year, when
the great German offensive was being pushed with what
then seemed to us overwhelming force. I remember one
particular evening when I was trying to write in the diary
something about ration books. My diary protested. I
tried it with one shortage after another. It refused every
one of them and kept me strictly to military affairs, showing
a particular delight in the expert optimism of “D.” of
The Westminster Gazette. ... -- -- .
Then one evening arrived the glorious news of Marshal
Foch's counter-offensive. My diary showed great agita-
tion and insisted on having the details, meagre enough
at the moment, written into it. The pages simply crackled
with emotion as I obeyed the command. Thenceforth there
was no contest between my diary and me. Wherever it
led, I followed, and so together, under the impulse of the
British and their gallant Allies, we rolled up and swallowed
as it were mile upon mile of the devastated land of France.
From that moment we never looked back, but kept
steadily eastward all the time. Then came Bulgaria's
defection; then Turkey fell out, and Austria-Hungary was
in convulsions; and at last the great Panjandrum himself,
with the little round button on top, began to crack and
collapse and talk of an armistice. In my joyful revulsion
of feeling my diary shared to the full. Indeed I noticed
with some apprehension that it was swelling visibly, though
this may have been due to its absorption of some parti-
cularly succulent newspaper articles recording our victories.
Yesterday, when I went to take it from its shelf I could
not find it. I have searched for it high and low and still
it is in the ranks of the missing. I can only attribute its
loss to the fever of delight to which it was stirred by
recent glorious events. The reaction from gloom must have
been too sudden, and I assume that it did away with itself
in a spasm of spiritual ecstasy.
A TRUE TWISTER.
A short time ago I was the happy possessor of three
boxes of wooden matches. They were not like war-time
matches. They were of the best pine—long, large, square-
cut and actually capable of being ignited. I was proud of
such possessions and guarded them jealously from the pre-
datory fingers of Jane and her mistress. I hid them in a
little drawer behind three pairs of old gardening gloves.
Sometimes, when my mood was prodigal, I would strike
one to light a cigarette. It gave me a feeling of reckless
egotism which, some say, comes only to Emperors. I had
my moments of happiness in those days.
It was the forenoon of Wednesday the thirtieth day of
October of this year and I was adjusting the set of the
celery bed when my attention was diverted by a clamour
in the house. -
“That's Turkey,” I said to myself as I cast down the
spade and prepared to join the carnival. “Of course,” I
mused, “it may be Austria—or both.” -
As I entered the dim portion of the hall which leads to
the garden I was aware of many figures gyrating in
front of me. They were flinging their arms about enthu-
siastically. . . . . -
“Hurrah!” I shouted.
on something.
I picked it up. It was a match—large, long, square-
cut and of the best pine. - -
: I skated over another one. The hall was covered with
them. - - - -
“Hello! Here's Uncle Harry,” cried my worst nephew,
flapping his unbuckled Sam Browne. “Come along, old
bean, and try a twister.” -
“A “twister'?" I said, still fascinated by the sea of
matches. ! -
“Yes," they exclaimed severally and in chorus. “Haven't
you read to-day's Punch 2 How the Scotsman flipped the
matches—they went ping—like a spent bullet—the rotary
movement does it.”
I stared at them blankly.
“It's an excellent leg-pull,” remarked the Colonel, cal-
lously striking three successive matches to light his pipe.
- “I’ve been bowling googlies with 'em and they didn't
even murmur,” said my second-worst nephew.’ “But,” he
added, producing a cavernous wallet, “they're very useful
little firesticks all the same.” - -
“I said it couldn't be done,” exclaimed Margery; “I
said it before we found the matches.” -

Camilla (Hodden AND SToUGHToN) is to my thinking a
singularly difficult story to get hold of. When Camilla, a
young American recuperating from the fatigues of divorcing
her husband, was plunged into the Nancarrow family circle,
her confusion of mind was only equalled by my own. Per-
haps this effect was the deliberate intent of Miss ELIZABETH
Robins; if so her success was certainly complete. As for
the Namcarrows, for whom she seemed to claim admiration,
frankly I found them detestable. The one member who
had any vitality was definitely a bad lot, the others were
inane, and the whole family snobs unmitigated. But while
I understood and shared Camilla's feelings towards this
unattractive household her other difficulties seemed to lack
probability. Such insularities, for example, as “laces” for
shoes, or what one might call the come-and-find-me arrange-
ment of breakfast dishes on a side table, presented problems
for which I should have expected to find her better equipped.
Has American literature no books of travel and exploration
that might have prepared her for these emergencies? Any-
how, having overcome the shoe and sausage obstacles and
got herself engaged to the least intelligent Nancarrow,
Camilla felt that she had earned a rest, and went back to
America to enjoy it. But it was too late. Not even the
purer air of her native land, where “strings" are strings
and you can see what they are giving you for breakfast,
could restore a spirit bemused with Nancarrows. In the end,
after an encounter with her former husband, we leave
Camilla disengaged, sinking between two stools into (ap-
parently) a permanently astonished celibacy. Somehow I
cannot think that so clever a writer as Miss ROBINS can
have found her very inspiring company.
Mr. EDEN PHILLPOTTs, pursuing his tour among the
industries of England, takes usin The Spinners (HEINEMANN)
to the district of Bridport. Although he gives us some
information about spinning, he is more concerned with the
spinners, and especially with one, Sabina Dinnett. The
tale is a tragedy, and in its concluding scenes is very real
and powerful; but it suffers from Mr. PHILLPoTTs' growing
habit of deserting his main theme for matters of relatively
trivial importance. His quaint pictures of the love affairs
of three middle-aged people would be well enough in their
proper place, but here we are concerned with a serious
problem, and he loses grip when he leaves it. The question
whether a man of education, whose passion is dead, ought
to marry a working-class girl by whom he has had a child
is not a new one, but Mr. PHILLPoTTs handles it with great
skill. Among the minor characters I give the badge of
merit to Mr. Churchouse, a dear old local author who
admitted on his death-bed that books which he professed
to have received from anonymous admirers had been sent
by himself. And the medal for idiocy ought certainly to
be handed to a Mr. Waldron, a person with no ideas outside
sport, whose conversation, as usual with this type, was
insufferably tiresome.
Many a student at the Bar and many an embryo
policeman must have entered upon his career with the
high criminological ideals which form the thesis of Miss

JEANETTE LEE's The Green Jacket (SKEFFINGTON), but few
can have been long in the business before they lost her
illusion that the prevention of crime or the reform of the
criminal can be “all done by kindness.” Even after reading
this fascinating story of the disappearance of the Mason
emeralds and the detection of the thief by Millicent
Newberry, the lady sleuth, and after paying due attention
to the deductive arguments of the latter, I still think that
existing systems are quite kind enough to felons and mis-
demeanants and that enough latitude is provided for them by
the Borstal and similar systems. But perhaps in America,
where the events take place, human nature is different and
better. Again, however rude it may seem to criticise coldly
and harshly so polite and warm-hearted a book, there are
two questions I must put to the author: If Oswald Mason
and his wife really loved each other with the concentrated
passion which is suggested, how on earth did they manage
to keep secret from each other those very actions upon
which the whole mystery depends? And, if they did not
has done a thoroughly good bit under General PERSHING,
with Marjory hard at work as near him as she could get.
There appears no special reason (other than the general
difficulty of finding a title for anything) why Miss DoRothy.
PERCIvaL should have given to her story of life in a Canary
Island the name Footsteps (LANE). Because the special foot-
steps, the sound of which made the heroine sit up—literally,
you can see her doing it on the illustrated wrapper—only
came once, and that to the ultimate regret of the wicked
owner, who got nothing by his intrusion but a blow on the
head from the heroine's candlestick. Daphne was the lady's
name, and she had migrated to the Canaries with a father
whose morals (and footsteps) were both of them unsteadied
by alcohol. To such an extent indeed that when an affluent
but (in two senses) impossible suitor, with the rightly
handicapping name of Gonsalves, petitioned for the lady's
hand, papa professed to see no just impediment to the union.
Not so however Daphne; nor the handsome young English
love each other, what did the
mystery matter, since the
crime did nobody any harm
and was never meant to ? But
let the reader not trouble him- || |
self with these nice points or ||
question too closely whether
Miss Newberry actually dis-
plays those gifts of deduction
and manipulation which her
advertised title of “a lady
Sherlock Holmes" would in-
dicate; let him read the story
for himself, taking up the
challenge of the same adver-
tisement, which proclaims that
“the impenetrable mystery
will baffle him until the very
sentence in which the secret
is revealed.”

Daphne temporised, till Gon-
salves lost patience, and be-
haved in the ungentlemanly
fashion and with the humi-
liating result indicated above.
All of which goes to prove
that if you must read in bed it
is as well to do so by the light
of a large-size candle. Also
that life in the Canaries is not
(so to speak) all groundsel.
To sum up, Miss PERCIVAL has
written a lively story, with a
touch of real #y about
the relations of the father and
daughter, but otherwise follow-
ing conventional lines, as these
are understood in fiction rather
than every-day life.
º
Mr. Louis WILKINson has
committed the fault common
to clever young novelists of
__ putting into what reads like a
J.H. Dow D, 18
pretty Marjory Stockton at a moment's notice, merely to
convenience her in her plans for having a good care-free
time likewise. No obligations or responsibilities on either
side, you understand. I betray none of Mr. FREDERIck
QRIN BARTLETT's secrets in telling you this much, because
the event occurs within the first hundred pages of The
Triflers (METHUEN); and really there can be no secrecy
about the further fact that they spent the remaining
chapters of an agreeable story in learning to wish for and
finally attaining precisely that hampering element which
they had so flouted at first—namely, love. Frankly, they
were rather a pair of noodles to be so slow about it, and
one felt inclined to give them an occasional shove along
the right way; but they get there all right—long before the
back cover is reached, the wad of advertisements being
thick. This summary hardly does the book justice, since
both hero and heroine are really desirable people, and the
author is concerned delicately and cheerfully to show the
seriousness of things that are serious. None the less his
characters and their actions are not honestly in accord, and
one's war-time impatience with insincerity does stir a little
at times. But the book ends on a note of war as well as
of honeymoon, and I have no doubt that by now Monte
first book—A Chaste Man (HEINEMANN)—all sorts of
things that happen to be in his imagination or experience,
without any particular regard for their pertinence to his
theme. But clever the book undoubtedly is, and interesting
throughout, which, after all, leaves one little to grumble at.
Oliver Lawrence, a journalist publisher, has married, a
suburban and grown tired of her. He consoles himself for
his lack of judgment in this supreme matter by philandering
with the virginal Olga. The dangerous game of the chaste
flirtation is made unbearable by the girl's awakening;
and I should like to testify to the skill and charm of
this portrait of an adorable adolescent. Oliver breaks his
new chain and goes back to make the best of his old
bondage in a sensible disillusioned way. There are other
good cartoons and caricatures, and I will prophesy. Mr.
WILKINson a notable future if he won't put all his rough
sketch-book jottings to date into every picture he tackles.
There are two profound puzzles: where did old Flynn, Olga's
putative father, get all the whiskey that he and Oliver
drank together; and where did Oliver get the ten half-
sovereigns he paid out to his little contributor? I haven't
mentioned that there is a murder as part of the pot-pourri.
Quite a nice and appropriate one. -

WHEN Fritz had worked his various spells,
Murder and arson, loot and ravage,
His poisoned gas and poisoned wells
And all the other Teuton hells -
That tend to make a Tommy savage;
When through the smoke of reeking lands,
Of plundered shrine and tortured city,
He saw the bright avenging brands
And, lifting up his dirty hands,
Cried “Kamerad I" and whined for pity;

Would bind his wounds and make him whole
And let the blighter share his dole

And let my fare by Huns be eaten

And gloried in his every crime

The humour of the whole position;
Must further stint my frugal feed

Endure the pangs of inanition;

Reduce the pot I hoard my jam in,
From lust of lard my spirit wean
And prune my slab of margarine
To save the gentle foe from famine.

As though he were my heart's own jewel,
And with a sweet and smiling grace
Heap coals of fire upon his face

And for his loaf subscribe my leaven,

November 11th.-Armistice signed. An end at last of the
Titanic struggle. I hope the population will comport itself
becomingly over this. Enthusiasm there must be, but I
have always maintained that victory should be celebrated
in a quiet and dignified manner, befitting the prestige of
a great nation. § should be a period of recueillement, of
retrospect.
I have been rather rudely interrupted just now by the
abrupt entrance of my landlady. She is, or was, a sedate
woman and her behaviour has somewhat shocked and
offended me. She dashed into my sanctum and nearly
swept off the table some of my Oolitic fossils which I was
rearranging to include a new specimen (Cerithium sub-
scalariforme). A coloured streamer was pinned on her
chest and a small Union Jack was stuck in the coils of
her coiffure. Decidedly grotesque. -
“Oh, Sir,” she said, “have you heard the noos? Do you
know 3" She then billowed up to me (she is a woman of
large proportions), seized my hand and for one dizzy mo-
ment I feared that she would embrace me.
“You refer, of course,” I said, releasing myself from her
moist palm as quickly as possible, “to the cessation of hos-
tilities. We have, indeed, every cause for gratitude that the
unleashed forces of the world are checked * *
“I suppose you won't be in for lunch an' dinner, Sir?”
she broke in.
“Why not?” I inquired coldly.
“Cos I'm going to be out,” she snapped; “and p'r'aps
I won't be home till morning, neither.”
I stared. And then it occurred to me that probably
the poor creature's mind, never calculated to bear much
strain, had become temporarily unhinged. I decided to
humour her.
“Why, of course,” I said soothingly. “But do you
think,” I added with tact, “that you ought to go out in
your present condition? Try a little repose, bathing of the
temples and palms of the hands with some restorative --
I am sorry to say that she interrupted me again, this
time by bouncing out of the room and slamming the door.
And I have just heard the front-door slam too. Ira furor
brevis est. But her departure makes it rather awkward
for me, as I must go out and take my meals at a restaurant
—a thing I have always disliked. As I have to go out I
might call and see one of my colleagues and show him the
new Oolite fossil. It should interest him.

On leaving home yesterday morning I arrived at my col-
league's house (after much difficulty, owing to the extreme
congestion of the traffic), only to discover that everyone
was out and the place completely deserted. As I retraced
my steps, intending to find some quiet corner for luncheon,
McQuirk came upon me. I have never cultivated his friend-
ship, as I always resented his boisterous manner, and I was
not at all pleased to meet him now. But directly he saw me
he seized me by the arm and shouted out, “Hello, Septimus,
what about the Huns, eh?”
I looked round, apprehensive that some acquaintance
might see me in company with such a maniac. He was
bedecked from head to foot with the flags of most nations;
in one hand he carried a small bell and in the other a vari-
coloured hooter, upon which he blew loud blasts with un-
remitting fervour. “Come along with me, old chap,” he

went on, still holding me by the arm, “and I'll wake
you up.”
I would have explained my views to him on recueillement
and retrospect but for the hooter, which was a bar to any
sustained conversation. He swept me along till we came
to a house where some friends of his resided. Here light
refreshment was being circulated. Though inclined to tem-
perance I was persuaded to celebrate the occasion.
I do not know how long we stayed (continuing to cele-
brate the occasion), but, on someone's suggestion, we all
went out ultimately in a body and secured a conveyance.
I do not remember thinking it singular at the time that
fifteen of us got into one taximeter-cab; I do recall, how-
ever, that I was very insistent about going on to the top, I
cannot think why, for in that position it is, difficult to
retain one's equilibrium. McQuirk was on the top with
me, and someone kept making ear-splitting noises with a
hooter. I discovered later that it was myself.
About the following events I cannot be quite clear. I
have only a general impression of noise and cheering and
laughter; of many times slipping off the top of the convey-
ance and as many times being replaced; of being the centre
of a group of young officers and singing as loudly as any
of them, “What are we when we're out of a job 2 Bow-
wow !” Also of an exuberant dinner somewhere, and of
McQuirk's accompanying me home at a very late hour,
while I was conscious of assuring him that he had always
been my best, my very best friend, and shaking hands
with him repeatedly.
All this happened yesterday. Only this morning am I
beginning to realise it with growing horror. I note that
my landlady is less respectful—though perhaps more
friendly—in her attitude. I fear I may never get her back
to her former footing. Further, on looking over my Oolite
fossils I suddenly remember giving the Cerithium sub-
scalariforme to the cab-driver and imploring him to keep
it for my sake.
My landlady has just been in, and said with what
approximated to a snigger, “I suppose you won't be going
out again to-day, Sir?” The woman has nettled me.
Why shouldn't I go out 2 I can prepare my lecture on the

greatest victory in history, the most colossal Where's
my hat? There it is, and—ah, yes, the hooter. I think I'll
step round to McQuirk's and see if he has made any plans
to-day for a further celebration of the occasion.

nothing at the time.

I signed the replies to these letters automatically. On
reading the carbon copies after the letters had gone this is
what I found:—

THE MUD LARKS.
I CAN readily believe that war as
performed by Messieurs our ancestors
was quite good fun. You dressed up
in feathers and hardware—like some-
thing between an Indian game-cock
and a tank—and caracolel about the
country on a cart-horse, kissing your
hand to balconies and making very
liberal expenses out of any fat (and un-
armed) burgesses that happened along.
With the first frost you went into
winter quarters—i.e. you turned into
the most convenient castle and wiled
away the dark months roasting chest-
nuts at a log fire, entertaining the
ladies with quips, conundrums and
selections on the harpsichord and vying
with the jester in the composition of
Limericks.
The profession of arms in those spa-
cious days was both pleasant and profit-
able. Nowadays it is neither; it is a
dreary melange of mud, blood, boredom
and blue-funk (I speak for myself).
Yet even it, miserable calamity that
it is (or was), has produced its piquant
situations, its high moments; and one
manages to squeeze a sly smile out of
it all, here and there, now and again.
I have heard the skirl of the Argyll
and Sutherland battle-pipes in the Bor-
ghese Gardens and seen a Highlander
dance the sword-dance before applaud-
ing Rome. I have seen the love-locks
of a matinée idol being trimmed with
horse-clippers (weep, O ye flappers of
Suburbia!) and a Royal Academician
set to whitewash a pig-sty. I have
seen American aviators in spurs, Royal
Marines a-horse, and a free-born Aus-
tralian eating rabbit. All these things
have I seen.
And of high moments I have experi-
enced plenty of late, for it has been
my happy lot to be in the front of the
hunt that has swept the unspeakable
Bosch back off a broad strip of France
and Belgium, and the memory of the
welcome accorded to us, the first British,
by the liberated inhabitants will remain
with us until the last “Lights Out.”
The procedure was practically the same
throughout.
There would come a crackle of wild
rifle fire from the front of a village;
then, as we worked round to the flank, a
dozen or so blue-cloaked Uhlans would
scamper out of the rear and disappear
at a non-stop gallop for home. In a
second the street would be full of
people, emptying out of houses and
cellars, pressing about us, shaking
hands, kissing us and our horses even,
smothering us with flowers, cheering
“Vivent les Anglais !”“Wive la France 1"
clamouring, laughing, crying, mad with
Joy.
Grandmeres would appear at attic
windows waving calico tricolors (hid-
den for four long years) while others
plastered up tricolor hand - bills—
“Hommage d mos Libérateurs,” “God's
blessings unto Tommy.”
However, touching and delightful
though it all might be, it was not
getting on with the war; this embarras
des amis was saving the Uhlans' hide.
Furthermore, though I can bring
myself to bear with a certain amount
of embracing from attractive young
things, I do not enjoy the salutations
of unshorn old men; and when Mayors
and Corporations got busy my native
modesty rebelled, and I would tear my-
self loose and, with my steed decorated
from ears to croup with flowers, so that
I looked more like a perambulating hot-
house than a poor soldier-man, take up
the pursuit once more.
In due course we came to the con-
siderable town of X. All happened
as before. As we popped in at one
flank the bold Uhlan popped out at the
other, and the townsfolk flooded the
streets. I was dragged out of the sad-
dle, kissed, pump-handled and cheered
while my bewildered charger was led
aside and festooned with pink roses.
Tricolors appeared at every window;
handbills of welcome were distributed
broadcast. The Mayor and Corporation
arrived at the double, and we struggled
together for some moments while they
rasped me with their stubbly beards.
When the first wild ecstasies had sofhe-
what abated I gathered my troop and
prepared to move again.
“Whither away ?” the Mayor en-
quired, a fine old veteran he, wearing
two 1870 medals and the ribbon of the
Legion.
“To Z.,” said I.
“Ecoutez, done,” he warned. “They
are waiting for you there in force,
machine-guns and cannon.”
I intimated that nevertheless I must
go and have a look-see, at any rate,
and so rode out of town, the vast crowd
accompanying us to the outskirts cheer-
ing, shouting advice, warnings and
blessings. In sight of Z. we shed
our floral tributes and, debouching off
the highway into the open, worked for-
wards on the look-out for trouble,
It came. A dozen pip-squeaks shrilled
overhead to cause considerable casual-
ties among some neighbouring cabbages,
and shortly afterwards rifle-fire opened
from outlying cottages. I swung round
and tried for an opening to the north,
but a couple of machine-guns promptly
gave tongue on that flank. Another
flock of pip-squeaks kicked up the
mould in front of us and some fresh
rifles and machine-guns joined in. Too
hot altogether.
I was just deciding to give it best
and cut for cover when all hostile fire
suddenly switched off, and a few min-
utes later I beheld light guns on lorries,
machine-guns in motor cars and Uhlans
on horses stampeding out of the village
by all roads east.
The day was mine. Yip, Yip! Bonza!
Skookum ! Hurroosh! Nevertheless I
was properly bewildered, for it was ab-
surd to suppose that an overwhelming
force of heavily-armed Huns could have
been bluffed out of a strong position by
the merest handful of unsupported cav-
alry. Manifestly absurd
I turned about, and in so doing my
eye lit on the poplar-lined highway
from X., and I understood. Along the
road poured the hordes of an advancing
army, advancing in somewhat irregular
column of route, with banners flying.
The head of the column was not a mile
distant. The Infantry must be on my
heels, thought I. Stout marching! I
grabbed up my glasses, took a long look
and bellowed with laughter. It was
not the Inſantry at all; it was the lib-
erated population of X., headed by the
Mayor and Corporation, come out to
see the fun, the grandmøres and grand-
pères, the girls and boys, the dogs and
babies, marching, hobbling, skipping,
toddling down the pavé, waving their
calico tricolors and singing the Mar-
seillaise. I thought of the Bosch flee-
ing eastward with the fear of God in
his soul, and rolled about in my saddle
drunk with joy. PATLANDER.
REMEMBER, REMEMBER!
H. C. writes to The Times to sug-
gest that in future November 11th, the
day on which the armistice began, shall
be an additional Bank Holiday, to be
called Thanksgiving Day. Mr. Punch
thinks this a very good idea; but he
goes farther and proposes that the
11th shall not only be celebrated as
a national holiday, but shall absorb
(without any ecclesiastical bearing) its
neighbour, the 5th–now rapidly be-
coming obsolete–and that fireworks
shall be associated with it and, if need
be, guys. -
Remember, remember
The eleventh of November 1
Let that be the new refrain. No prize
is offered for the best suggestion as to
whose effigy should be burned.

A NOTE ON MR. D-.
The pictorial sequence form of adver-
tisement, which is an innovation of our
own day, undoubtedly renders certain
of our periodicals more entertaining.
One, at any rate, of our most illustrious
statesmen, now regrettably emeritus,
rejoices in each variation on the ac-
tivities of that elderly buck who com-
ments upon the excellence of a certain
accessory of horseless vehicles, and
whom for the moment we may call
Mr. D—; and others less exalted
would probably confess, perplexedly,
to the same attractions. The com-
manding height, the knowing air, the
confident smile, the tilted hat—and the
hat of a glossiness too!—the swinging
cane, the trousering and the ..".
all exert their spell. One laughs, but
one looks. This well-groomed dégagé
patriarch is indeed rapidly becoming
one of the best known figures in the
British Isles and bids fair soon to be
more familiar than either of the
Georges—Rex or Lloyd. Every town
now has him in its windows; some-
times in drawings; sometimes cut out
in cardboard, viewing with affectionate
regard his own portrait held in the left
hand; sometimes even in plaster statu-
ettes, coloured to the life.
There is peril perhaps in such univer-
sal publicity. One foresees the danger
of John Bull losing identity. It will not
be Mr. D 's fault if his own form and
lineaments do not come to be taken
by foreigners as typically national—
| if he does not, in fact, oust John Bull.
The normal Briton of course resem-
bles neither; he is not so solid and
apoplectic and agricultural as our
ancient symbol, nor so complacent and
raffish and urbane as this new one.
But certain it is that in years to come
one of the tasks of antiquaries will be
to analyse and determine the body of
myth attaching to Mr. D 's person-
ality.
According to The Daily Chronicle,
“the ex-Crown Prince had a lot of
luggage with him. It was all carefully
examined by the Dutch guards, and was
found to consist entirely of personal
effects.” Yes, but whose 2

ARMISTICE DAY.
Small Child (excitedly). “OH, MoTHER, what Do YoU THINK ? THEY 'VE GIVEN Us A WHOLE HOLIDAY To-DAY IN AID OF THE WAR."
EX-KINGS AT PLAY.
At the general meeting of the ex-
| King's Club at Berne last Wednesday
the claims of several new candidates
for election were considered. We are
indebted for the following account of
the proceedings to Mr. Paul Pryor, the
celebrated correspondent, who was pre-
sent (on the roof) at the meeting.
The first candidate proposed was the
ex-Kaiser WILHELM. In moving his
election ex-King CoNSTANTINE observed
that he was not actuated solely by
family reasons. He preferred to base
the candidate's claim on the broader
grounds of his versatile gifts, his great
conversational powers, his musical at-
tainments and his prowess in the chase,
which, he added, might be of great
value to the commissariat department
if the native chamois could be persuaded
to collaborate.
Ex-Tsar FERDINAND seconded in a
brief speech. The ex-Kaiser, he pointed
out, was interested in everything, in-
cluding botany. In his company stag-
nation was impossible, and his reminis-
cences would be an unfailing source of
stimulation.
The ex-Mpret of ALBANIA said that he
was sorry to strike a jarring note in this
duet of eulogy, but he felt bound to
oppose the election on the ground that
what they wanted above all was a quiet
life, and to live with the ex-Kaiser WIL-
HELM would be like living in a railway
station.
The ex-Khedive ABBAs supported the
ex-Mpret. The climate of Switzerland
was bracing enough to supply them
with all necessary stimulus, and, what-
ever might be said of the ex-Kaiser,
he could not be truthfully described as
a nice man for a small tea-party.
As the voting was equal the candi-
date was withdrawn.
Ex-Tsar FERDINAND then proposed
his son, ex-Tsar BoRIs. Setting pater-
nal bias aside he was quite sure that
his son would prove a most eligible
member of the club. He had himself
instructed him in natural history and
taken a deep interest in his conversion
to the creed professed by ex-King CoN-
STANTINE.
Ex-King CoNSTANTINE expressed a
lively regret in having to oppose the
candidature of this estimable young
man, but he thought it a bad precedent.
Ex-Tsar Boris had only reigned for a
few weeks, or was it days? He was
convinced that it was desirable in the
best interests of the club that a rule
should be passed making it obligatory
for a candidate to have occupied the
throne for a minimum period of two
years.
Ex-Tsar FERDINAND here interposed
to protest against the enforcement of a
rule borrowed from English county
cricket—a gross slur on kingship as he
interpreted it.
Ex-King CoNSTANTINE retorted that
ex-kings might learn even from their
enemies. BoRIs might be an excellent
young man, but his Slavonic name was
suspicious. He might for all they knew
be a crypto-Bolshevist.
Dx-Tsar FERDINAND replied with some
heat that ex-King CoNSTANTINE's own
mother was a Slav.
Whereon ex-King CoNSTANTINE re-
joined, “And you are the great-grand-
son of a regicide.”
At this point the meeting broke up
in disorder, the waiters intervening,
and the claims of nineteen other candi-
dates were unavoidably postponed till
the next meeting.

Monday, November 11th. — As the as she retains in her Government the
PRIME MINISTER entered the crowded personages described by Mr. BALFouB
House of Commons to announce the as “conscious agents of the German
terms of the armistice Members in military autocracy,” she cannot expect
to get out of it.
nearly every part of the House rose to
acclaim him. Even “the ranks
of Tuscany” on the Front
Opposition Bench joined in
the general cheering. Only -
Mr. DILLON and his half- " :
dozen supporters remained
moody and silent. To them
the great day came as an
Ireland gave up fighting
months ago.
The rest of the House lis-
tenedeagerly while Mr.LLoyd
GEORGE recited the condi-
tions to which the German
plenipotentiaries had put
their unwilling hands at five
o'clock that cold grey morn-
ing. He read so fast that
Members had scarcely time
to endorse with their ap-
plause one outstanding item
in the bill of costs before an-
other equally notable claimed
their attention. Alsace-Lor-
raine to be freed at once, with-
out waiting for the Peace’
Congress; the Watch on the Rhine to
be kept in future by the Allies; can-
nons, machine-guns and locomotives to
be surrendered by the thousand; all
U-boats fit for sea to be handed over,
and the rest of the German Navy to
be interned or disarmed; all the gold
stolen from Belgium, Russia and Rou-
mania to be delivered in trust to the
Allies—these were some of the thirty-
five points with which Marshal Foch
and Admiral WEMYss have penetrated
the German cuticle.
Well might Mr. Asquith say that
the terms made it clear that not only
was the War at an end, but that it
could not be resumed.
Then Mr. SPEAKER, in his gold-em-
broidered joy-robes, headed a great
procession to St. Margaret's Church.
The Ex-PREMIER and his successor
—the man who drew the sword of
Britain in the War for freedom and
the man whose good fortune it has
been to replace it in its sheath—fell in
side by side; and behind them walked
the representatives of every party save
one. Mr. DILLON and his associates
had more urgent business in one of the
side-lobbies—to consider, perhaps, why
Lord GREY of Fallodon in his eve-of-
war speech had referred to Ireland as
“the one bright spot.”

ENTHUSIASM OF MB. DILLON ON HEARING THE
NEWS OF VICTORY.
Demobilization is the order of the
day; and several Members endeavoured
to assist the Government by suggest-
ing that preference should be given to
various classes of their constituents;
miners, the owners of one-man busi-
nesses, industrial “key-men,” agricul-
turists, and married men being the
most favoured. The House was glad
to find that these points had not es-
DORA STARTS CLEANING UP,
caped the eagle glance of the MINISTER
of RECONSTRUCTION, who in a long and
detailed statement outlined the pro-
posals by which the Government hoped
to mitigate the horrors of peace.
| Dr. ADDIson's remark that in the
disposal of war-stores the Government
would endeavour “not to
incur more scandals than
could be avoided” was espe-
cially welcome to persons
with memories reaching back
to the South African war.
As the stores in question
are estimated to be worth
a trifle of five hundred mil-
lions they will be a useful
set-off to the amount of the
war-debt, now standing, ac-
cording to the CHANCELLOR
OF THE EXCHEQUER, at a
figure approaching seven
thousand millions. Yet he
rightly considers that no
one will grumble at the ex-
penditure since it has enabled
• us to put “paid " to a long-
outstanding BILL.
The disappearance of one
autocrat will, it is hoped,
soon be followed by the de-
dethronement of another.
“Dora.” must soon think
about abdicating. Already
she has consented to give us more
light in our streets. The next thing
wanted is more light in our Press;
but for that, Mr. BoNAR LAw says,
we must wait a while.
Perhaps it was prejudice against
Dora's petticoat Government that
caused Lord CHAPLIN to utter so fer-
vent a protest against the Bill for
enabling women to sit in Parliament.
The ladies found a devoted champion
in Lord HALDANE, but were neverthe-
less temporarily baulked of their desire,
for before a vote could be taken the
House, most ungallantly, counted itself
out.
Wednesday, November 13th. — The
Lords having recovered their good
manners gave way to the ladies and
passed the second reading of their Bill
without further demur. Possibly a long
discussion on that trite topic, the dis-
tribution of honours, had taken the
starch out of them. Lord SELBoRNE
declared that the size of the lists, now
swollen to a condition of positive
obesity, made it impossible for the
PRIME MINISTER to exercise any proper
supervision and urged the appointment
of a Committee of the Privy Council to
act as a filter for the fountain of honour.
Lord CRAWFORD threw scorn upon the
suggestion and warmly resented the
comments made by persons “of high
standing and full of honours” upon the

tived without a division. Lord SEL-
Borne may comfort himself with the

In the Commons a lively attack upon
the Food-ControLLER was made by
Mr. CAUTLEy, the late Director of Pig
Production, who narrated how his
efforts had been nullified by the vacil-
lating behaviour of the Government.
Mr. CLYNEs protested that it was not
his fault. Members might possibly re-
member that there was formerly a war
on, that at one time it was going rather
badly for us, and that the shipping in-
tended to carry pig-food had brought
gallant American soldiers instead.

instead of the guns; but there are signs
of improvement. It may soon be pos-
sible to mill white flour, and that will
mean more offal for Mr. CAUTLEy's
protégés; and there is a prospect that
a few apples and oranges may be pro-
curable at Christmas-time even by non-
millionaires.
Thursday, November 14th.-Amid the
crash of falling thrones and exploding

an unfaltering gaze upon the parish

to be, but isn't, at Cullenstown in his
constituency, and he sternly called upon
the CHIEF SECRETARY to supply the
deficiency. Mr. Shortt considered this
to be a case where the local authority
might usefully apply the principles of
Sinn" Fein—“ourselves alone.”
Though “the mad dog of Europe” is
now more or less safely kennelled in

THE RIVAL.
HoRSE and foot, balloons and wings,
Tanks and guns are we,
Straight from doing desperate things;

All can tell of toil and fight
Freeing glorious France,
Exploits such as most delight
Maidens in romance.
But, behold, when Jones appears
All our yarns are vain;
He usurps the pretty ears
We so want to gain.
Does he talk of how the Hun
Bombs his moon-lit dumps?
How his reckless lorries run
Through the whooping crumps?
No, such talk of war's alarms
Subtly he ignores,
Weaving more effective charms
Chatting of his stores.

Filled his talk with tales of gold,
Ancient treasuries,
Perfumes, dyes of mystic art,
Jewels flame-possessed,

SCARS AND STRIPES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I hope you have
not forgotten me. I am the dog who
wrote to you at the beginning of the
War about going to the Front with my
master. I was a VERY SAD. DoG then;
I feel better and more hopeful now.
You will be pleased to hear that my
master has come through it all right,
though he carries the marks of three
nasty bites on his left arm, all in a row.
I thought at first that he had been
bitten three times in the same place,
and it struck me as very remarkable;
but another dog, whose master works
in the War Office, told me that these
bite-marks are called wound-stripes and
do not indicate the exact situation of
the bite. I think that is a pity, don't
you? It would be so much more inter-
esting if they did. -
My master is at present in hospital
with a fourth bite, and my mistress
tells me she thinks he will not be asked
to fight any more because of something
“CAN YOU PLAY BRIDGE TO-NIGHT * *
“WHAT 1–Do You LIKE THE STUFF?”

“SORRY. GoING TO HEAR SOME WAGNER.”
“FRANKLY, No; BUT I'VE HEARD ON THE
called an armistice which the Germans
wanted, so as to stop the fight. Of
course I am glad for my master's sake,
but, speaking as a dog of some ex-
erience, I do not understand it at all.
When I fight another dog I don't allow
an armistice or anything else to inter-
fere until I've made him wish he had
never been born, and I don't think the
Germans deserve to be treated any
better than a dog; do you?
My mistress and I have been to see
my master in the hospital several times
and his bite seems to be healing rapidly.
I am not allowed inside the place; my
mistress goes in by herself, leaving me
chained up in the hall. But oh, Mr.
Punch, I had such sport the first time
we went. I happened to be wearing
an old collar a size too large for me, so
the moment the hall-porter's back was
turned I was out of that collar and
into the hospital and had managed to
lick my master's face thoroughly before
they could turn me out. The nurses
were very kind and wanted to let me
stop, but there was a disagreeable per-
son called a Commandant who wouldn't
hear of it. She reminded me of our
cat.
Needless to say I have not been able
to play that trick again, but unless my
master comes home soon I'm going to
get at him somehow.
Yours sincerely,
A VERY DETERMINED DOG.

he had been told
(with that air of

which the British
N.C.O. a dopts
when he is palming

that he resembled
a soldier less than
a wet sock or a

little impersona-
tions of his more

istics had been
given with im-
mense effect by
the Company Ser-

dwelt lovingly but
with obvious ex-

corporal had point-
ed out to him with

patience the essen-

a cravat differs from
a rifle, the explan-
ation appearing to
him necessary in
view of the fact that
Clarence would per-
sist in his efforts to
tie his “D.P.” in a
knot round his neck
when sloping arms.
He had been ex-
horted in public
places “to 'old his

available fag-ends
had already been
collected by the
local boy scouts
in whose ranks he
appeared to con-
sider he had enlisted when passed fit for
service by a doctor who was obviously
intoxicated at the time.
He had been advised to try to look
like the “Arch-dook of Canterbury”
instead of like a man who had lost six-
pence and caught a cold in looking for
it. On more than one occasion he had
been brought before his Company Com-
mander for minor offences. His cap
had been snatched from his head.

himself but to the whole barrack-room
where he slept, as, for instance, that
there were thieves about, that he had left
his cap But it was never any good.
The Sergeant-Major always chipped in,
“Idle excooses, Sir. . This man is very
careless, Sir. 'E–" And then the
- Officer would say,
“All right, Ser-
geant-Major, that
will do,” just to
show that he was
independent of ser-
geant-majors, and
proceed to do what
the Sergeant-Major
told him, and give
Clarence three
days' C.B. And be-
fore Clarence could
begin a second
speech, of restrain-
ed and disciplined
protest this time,
the Sergeant-Major
would say, “Dis-
miss,” in a voice
like a dog-fight, and
Clarence would dis-
miss, and go away
and talk mutin-
ously of officers who
were under the
thumbs of their
N.C.O.'s and hadn't
got the – well, the
stomach, let us say,
to act on their own
initiative.
It was very hard.
Clarence knew that
if he had been an
officer himself he
would long ago have
put a stop to many
evils, including
strong language to
the men. Bullying,
that's what it was,
in Clarence's esti-
mation. He would
tell his sergeants
off if he were an
officer. He had
of ten imagined
himself standing
before his men,their
adored hero, with
accoosed came on parade without a
cap-badge.”
Then the Officer would ask some lead-
ing question, such as, “Where's your
cap-badge?” And Clarence would be-
gin a speech, a prepared speech, mind
you, not just a rambling discourse—a
speech which began by touching lightly
on essential and undisputed facts con-
cerning the case, as known not only to
his platoon - ser-
geant sobbing at his feet and asking
forgiveness. . . .
And now Clarence had an overdraft
at Cox's, a sword he was not allowed to
wear and a revolver he did not know
how to fire. In short he was an officer.
He put on a Sam Browne which he would
not be allowed to wear at the Front,
cricked his neck in his efforts to see in
the mirror how his Bedford cords looked

from behind, buttoned up some twenty-
three pockets all over him which had
contrived to come unbuttoned while he
was not looking, took a deep breath
and went out on to the parade ground.
Having saluted the Regimental Ser-
geant-Major under the impression that
he was the Adjutant, and apologised
profusely for his mistake, he presently
found himself facing a platoon of re-
cruits which had been given into his
hands by his Company Commander to
“put through some squad drill or move-
ments of arms.” Clarence had decided
on squad-drill.
He had often laughed inwardly at ner-
vous officers. He understood them a little
better now. Sixty pairs of eyes watched
him. The Platoon-Sergeant came up
and saluted. “Squad-drill, Sir,” he said.
Clarence was a little annoyed. This
should have come from him.
“No,” he said ; “movements of arms.
I will take them myself.”
“Very good, Sir,” said the Sergeant.
“Platoon!” said Clarence.
The platoon looked at him oddly.
“Platoon, shun / " said Clarence.
Somehow it did not sound quite right;
it had not the authoritative ring he
had imagined for his own voice when
he was in the ranks. It lacked con-
viction. However the platoon came
to attention, and Clarence told it to
slope hipe. It sloped hipe. Clarence's
spirits began to rise. He was control-
ling men. He told the platoon to pre-
sent hipe. It presented hipe, but it did
so very, very badly. Clarence brought
them back to the slope and started over
again. This time they did it worse than
before. As in a dream he heard the
Sergeant addressing the platoon.
“Come along,” the Sergeant was say-
ing, “you're more like wet socks than
soldiers. Number Three in the rear
rank, 'old your 'ead up. There ain't no
fag-ends about there. You ain't in the
boy scouts now. Private Bennett, that
there's a rifle, not a neck-tie.”
Clarence smiled. How excellent was
this man's wit. “Carry on for a bit,
will you, Sergeant?” he said.
The Sergeant carried on. He gave
what was in Clarence's opinion an ex-
cellent imitation of Number Five of the
front rank attempting to present arms.
In ten minutes he had the platoon
doing “movements of arms” with a
sort of frightened dexterity.
“Excellent fellows, these N.C.O.'s,”
reflected Clarence. But he remembered
his exalted part and tried to steel him-
self to a public reprimand which should
put him on good terms with the men.
And presently his opportunity came.
The Sergeant was, in Clarence's estima-
tion, a little too severe on a certain fool
of a recruit. Clarence rebuked him.
There was an awful silence. The Ser-
geant saluted.
“I beg your pardon, Sir," he said
stiffly, “but I should like to refer you
to Para. 437 in K.R.”
Clarence felt giddy. He did not
attempt to recall to his mind the con-
tents of “Para. 437 in K.R.” because
he knew that he had never read Para.
437. In some guilty and furtive fashion
he managed to get through the morning
parade, and when he had dismissed the
platoon, with its icily hostile sergeant,
he rushed to his room and seized his
“King's Regulations.” With trembling
fingers he turned the pages. Para. 437
swam before his eyes.
“An officer,” said Para. 437, “is not
to reprove a N.C.O. in the presence or
hearing of private soldiers. . . .”
He read no further. With a groan
he buried his white face in his shaking
hands. He thought of his useless and
expensive sword, of his overdraft at
Cox's, of the revolver which he did not
know how to use, and he broke down
and sobbed like a child.

[November 20, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LONG ARM.
“TALKING about coincidences,” said
the Sergeant, “did I ever tell you about
my brother-in-law 2 That was a coin-
cidence if you like. There's been a
lot of coincidences in this War.”
In the entrance-hall of the hospital
the Sergeant had met a chum with
whom he enlisted in 1914, and he had
come to the ward to tell us about it
and discourse on coincidences.
“What's a coincidence, Sergeant?"
asked Ginger.
Ginger is a hardened veteran of
twenty-four, one of the old army, and
he considers that the chief advantage
of being in hospital is that one can
be rude to sergeants without fear of
unpleasant consequences.
The Sergeant, who had been the
victim of one of Ginger's “leg-pul-
ling" exploits on the previous day,
regarded his questioner with stern sus-
icion.
“It would be a coincidence if there
was two ginger blokes as ugly and as
ignorant as you in the same hospital,"
he answered. “That'd be a coinci-
dence.”
“I see,” said Ginger; “and if two
ginger blokes both set about you and
gave you two thick ears, that would be
a coincidence.”
“No, that would be a mutiny,"snapped
the Sergeant. “You'd find yourself in
clink, p.d.g. Now shut up and don't
show your ignorance. I was going to
tell these other chaps about my brother-
in-law, Jimmy Hart. That was the
funniest coincidence I ever knew.”
“I don't believe you know what a
coincidence is yerself,” remarked the
irrepressible Ginger. “First you say
it's two ginger blokes, then you say
it's your brother-in-law. Is he aginger
bloke 2"
“No, he ain't,” responded the Ser-
geant angrily. “A coincidence is some-
thing that happens what you don't
expect.”
“Like having a sergeant be polito to
ou, or getting two lots o' pay, or straw-
rry jam instead of plum-and-apple,
or finding that the Quartermaster ain't
watered the rum ration ?" queried
Ginger with an expression of guileless
Innocence.
We threw things at Ginger, who
subsided, and we then begged the Ser-
geant to tell his story, having first
mollified him with a cigarette.
“Jimmy Hart's in the Middlesex,
and he's got the Military Medal,” the
Sergeant began. “Before the War he
was a carman, and he lived in Islington.
He's an ignorant sort of bloke—nearly
as bad as Ginger—and he had a lodger
in his house.”
“Was the lodger a coincidence 2"
inquired Ginger.
“He was,” said the Sergeant with a
threatening glance; “and don't you
keep making noises like a damaged
gramophone. Jimmy's lodger was a
German—a waiter he was in a restaur-
ant—and just before August Bank
Holiday in 1914 he did a guy; bolted
without payin' his rent. Went back to
Germany and left a saucy letter saying
he'd be back with the German Army
to square accounts and ended up by
calling Jimmy a pig-dog.
“Jimmy wasn't half wild. He went
to the police about it, and when war
was declared the next week I reckon he
thought it was on account of his lodger
having bilked him of his rent. I never
saw a man madder against the Germans
—except a Scotsman once at Poperinghe
that had a smuggled bottle of whisky
smashed in his hand by a sniper's
bullet. Jimmy said he'd make the
Germans pay, and he joined up with
me in the first week of the War.”
“I see,” remarked Ginger, as the
Sergeant paused to light another cigar-
ette. “The coincidence comes in that
it was your brother-in-law that got this
war started because his German lodger
did him out of his rent º' "
The Sergeant snorted, turned his
back on Ginger and continued his yarn.
“It was at Beaumont Hamel that
Jimmy Hart won the M.M., and that's
where the coincidence comes in.
company was held up by a Bosch
machine-gun and was getting cut to
bits. Jimmy was one of the best shots,
and he borrowed the officer's glasses
to have a look through when he was
trying to pick off the gunners. ‘Gimme
a couple o' Mills's, he says; 'I'll get
'im. This is what I've been waiting
for,’ he says.
“Out he goes on his own, crawling
along the ground, and the officer lost
sight of him and thought he was hit.
But Jimmy wasn't hit, nothing to speak
of. Presently the officer sees him jump
up, chuck his bombs, then start chasing
a big Fritz that was running away.
Jimmy had put the machine-gun out
all right, and when the rest of his crush
gets up to him he was kneeling on the
chest of the Fritz he'd been chasing,
trying to choke him and cursing like
hell.
“The officer thought perhaps the
Bosch was trying to kill Jimmy, and
he shoves his revolver in his face.
‘Don't kill him, Sir," Jimmy shouts out.
‘He's my lodger, Make him pay me
my rent.” And with that he grabs hold
of Fritz's throat again. “Pay me wot
you owes or I'll strangle yer,' he says.
‘Who's a pig-dog now º' 'I'll pay,
I'll pay ' ' the Bosch cries, and pulls
His
out some notes, when Jimmy lets him
get up. Then Jimmy explains things to
the officer and his pals; tells 'em that
the German use ter be his lodger and
had bolted without paying his rent; and
everybody laughed except the German.
“‘I recognised him through your
glasses, Sir," said Jimmy," and that was
why I come out on my own. I got
him, and now I got my rent I don't
care how soon the War's over,’ he says.
“Jimmy might ha' got the V.C., I
reckon, if he had shut up about his
rent,” the Sergeant concluded; “as it
was he got the Military Medal for rush-
ing the machine-gun. But he was more
pleased to get his rent out of that Ger-
man than he was about the medal.”
The Sergeant sighed and re-lit the
end of his cigarette.
“That's what I meant by coinci-
dence,” he resumed. “My brother-in-
law joined the army just because of
that German waiter, and he found
him.” -
He glanced round at Ginger, who
was sitting with a thoughtful look on
his face.
“Now you know what a coincidence
is, my lad,” he said with a smile.
“Yes, I know,” said Ginger. “A
coincidence is a bloomin' lie about his
brother-in-law, told by a sergeant.”
PEACE IN THE WILLAGE.
THE day that brought our village news
of peace,
Monday, that day of days,
We duly celebrated our release
In two noteworthy ways.
The church bells clanged and clashed:
that made us feel
That war at last was done ;
But those who pulled the ropes and
rang the peal
Were women—all but one.
Then the church clock, long silent in
its tower,
Awoke to tell the time
And cheer us at the quarter and the
hour
With its melodious chime.
Gone are the days when sleep alone
could break
War's grim and tyrannous spells;
Now it is rest and joy to lie awake
And listen to the bells.
The Great Alternative.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
AMONG the numerous persons who, unwittingly, have
earned my fervent gratitude there are not many towards
whom it is more fervent than the good kind people who
have collected and written down and published in attractive
shape the tales which, handed on from generation to
generation, fed the world's fancy before the present era of
printed fiction began. Captain CYRUs MACMILLAN, who
has collected and edited Canadian Wonder Tales (LANE), is
such an one; and, as Sir WILLIAM PETERSEN says in a
foreword, the stories, seen from different points of view,
will entertain alike the folk-lore student and the devotee of
“once upon a time.” Some of the tales were told to
Captain MACMILLAN by Canadian Indians, some by French
habitants. There are giants in them, and strong magics,
and animals who talk, and birds who build boats, and
mermaids, and fairy gifts and at least one tin with sardines
in it. With a thrill of excitement, if you know your GRIMMs,
you may discover Dummling of the magic goose in the
baker who made the tiens-bon ld (but you don't know what
that is any more than the wicked lawyer did who invented
it), and Hiawatha in Glooskap, and the warrior who fought
Red Plume and won corn for the Indians. When you
read that the editor corrected his proofs on Vimy Ridge
you will perhaps discover another stronger magic still tying
East and West and Past and Present and War and Peace
in a knot together. Mr. GEORGE SHERINGHAM has drawn
some delightful pictures in colour for the volume. They
remind me of tapestry; but I gathered from the attitude of
a competent critic of six years old that they will probably
appeal most to the older reader. Now, please, will some-
body collect the Wonder Tales of Australia and New Zea-
land and all the other Dominions as quickly as possible?
Undeniably there are few literary tasks more difficult
than that of conveying to paper the thrill and fascination
of stage traffic. To pack the emotions of the theatre within
the covers of a book remains as hard as to bring the scent
of hay across the footlights—that oft-quoted achievement
than which to a modern audience nothing could be more
disconcerting. This is why I have the warmer welcome
for Buzz 1 Buzz 1 (CoLLINs), a volume in which Captain J. E.
AGATE has combined some reprinted dramatic criticism
with a collection of papers bearing generally upon the art
of the theatre; all of them both pleasant to read and
stimulating to reflect upon. I have no room to number
the gods of the writer's dramatic idolatry, among whom
you will find a high place given to Sir FRANK BENSoN. They
range from Mme. BERNHARDT to ARTHUR SINCLAIR (I should
have liked, by the way, more than a passing phrase of
approval for one who was to my mind incomparably the
greatest of recent English comedians, the late JAMES WELSH;
interesting to see what impression this most delicate of
players made upon a critic so receptive of precisely his
qualities). There is special value in the appreciation, by
one who knew and shared his early environment, of poor

STANLEY Houghton, that victim of success too roughly
handled, whose art withered so tragically in an alien soil.
I can do no more than suggest others of Captain AGATE's
most fertile themes; some witty and provoking studies of
the Repertory in action; a poignant anecdote of the perils
of excessive appreciation; and, as make-weight, the parable
of Mr. Cleever, a grotesquerie, rather in the Chestertonian
mode, of the evolution of the artist. Buzz / Buzz / (perhaps
a needlessly baffling title) is a book which I shall keep for
frequent enjoyment; not even Manchester, where alone
they seem to preserve the secret of such matters, has
produced anything better.

Colonel JAMEs MoRRIs MoRGAN, the gallant author of
Recollections of a Rebel Reefer (CoNSTABLE), was born in
1845, in the extreme south of Louisiana. To a lady who
once doubted whether he was a genuine Southerner he
replied, “Madam, I can assure you that had I been born
any farther south than I was, I would have had to come
ling the physically terrible with what is in its essence
spiritual will make a popular appeal to the ordinary British
mind I cannot pretend to guess, but it is safe to say that
both in imaginative intensity and realistic power M.
MALHERBE has few, if any, equals among those who have
written on the War. Indeed these sketches, which tell, in
unforgettable language, of things seen and felt, and reveal
amidst the horrors of war the soul of a man seeking after
the light, are stamped by the mark of something nearly
related to genius.
Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT is again digging among the sagas
for material. He now reconstructs the story of Gudrid the
Fair (CoNSTABLE), whose doom it was to survive three
husbands. This sounds unromantic, but, believe me, isn't.
For in Iceland and Greenland death came swiftly to men
by weather and war, and a noble-hearted beautiful lady
like Gudrid was esteemed a great prize among a chivalrous
people. As to the story, a saga is much what the percep-
into this world either as a
pompino or a soft-shell crab,
for the hard ground stops
where I was born, in the
southern part of Louisiana.”
A soft-shell crab I know—
properly cooked with an
appropiate sauce it is a
delicious food—but as to
a pompino I must plead
ignorance. When the great
Civil War broke out Colonel
MoRGAN was barely sixteen
years old, but he was soon
in the thick of some very
pretty water-fighting on
the Confederate side, one
combat in particular in the
James River, seven miles
south of Richmond, being

Thenceforward young MoR-
GAN had as much fighting as
he wanted, and there seem
to have been very few scraps
that he did not bear a part in. Blockade-running, com-
merce-raiding on the Georgia—nothing came amiss to him,
and whatever the fight was he seems to have had great
gusto for it. Eventually, however, the Confederate power
declined, leaving Colonel MoRGAN, not yet, by the way, a
colonel, a scarred and battered veteran of twenty-one.
His next service was in the Egyptian army, and it was in
this that he rose to be a colonel. His knack of attracting
adventures did not cease, and he was probably enjoying a
full-blooded one less than a fortnight ago. Readers who
like more than a dash of excitement with their reading will
find this book very much to their mind.

FORGOT MYSELF As To KISS 'IM. IF I DID, YoUR WASHUP, I DESERVES SIX MONTHS.” -
“cEREMonial.”
THERE is no greater stimulus to dis-
cipline than a Ceremonial Parade; a
regular soldier told me this one day as
we chatted amicably after he had ticked
me off for some trifle. It is true; I
know now. It is there that the diffi-
culties which beset the Staff are made
evident to those who foolishly seem
to imagine that the Staff have nothing
to do but ask awkward questions and
remain imperturbable in motor-cars.
We had a Ceremonial last month on
the occasion of a distribution of medals,
and it was really a bon affair; you
would have enjoyed it. The batta-
lions marched on to the parade-ground
shepherded by wild-eyed Company
Commanders, who knew that what
they had done was wrong, but that it
was not nearly so wrong as the things
they were going to do in their endea-
vours to get into a hollow square.
However, the Regimental Sergeant-
Major was there and all was well.
Every movement of the Junior Staff
in the centre of the square was watched
critically. When the Divisional Com-
mander's flagstaff was erected men
began talking of maypole dances they
had witnessed in the Old Country.
When the flag stuck halfway up those
with relatives in the Navy took a pro-
minent part in the conversation. It
was a most impressive spectacle. All
the officers lined up in front of their
battalions, sized like the pipes of an
organ, some with gloves, some with
their hands well behind the seams of
their trousers. And the fufi of it was
to get everything arranged so that it
should go without a hitch, for of course
in Ceremonial everything must be ab-
solutely right and absolutely uniform
throughout—it is the Adjutant's day
out.
Nothing was left to chance. I don't
know how many times I walked along
the line of officers and made cheery
remarks to encourage them, now say-
ing, “Remember, at the General Salute
you will all salute on the third motion
of the ‘Present’ and cut away the hand
on the first motion of the ‘Slope Arms.'”
Or, if I wasn't saying that, I was telling
them “Of course you will salute on the
first motion of the ‘Present’ and cut
away the hand on the second motion
of the ‘Slope Arms,’” and yet, would
you believe it, after all the trouble I had
taken to make each alteration quite
clear, when the General arrived every-
body saluted on the second motion and
cut away in their own time—all except
the Staff Captain, who was so overcome
at the moment of saluting, through just
remembering he had forgotten some-
thing, that he stood up there mesmerised
in the centre of the square, with his
right hand blinding his right eye long
after everybody else had stood at ease.
As soon as the Brigade Major had
side-kicked the Staff Captain back to
consciousness we got right on with the
business at once. All the recipients of
the medals had been lined up most
earefully beforehand in the order in
which their names were to be read out,
and they stood there looking aghast at
the distance they would have to walk
to the table. It was a fearful ordeal to
have to walk fifty yards or more, fully
conscious of being improperly dressed,
possessing a blue nose and repugnant
appearance generally, certain to trip up
and miss the outstretched hand alto-
gether and likely enough to salute before
the handshake was over and carry the
General's hand to their forehead as
well.
The Staff Captain got busy at once,
happy now in remembering he had for-
gotten what it was he had remembered
having forgotten. Pulling out his lists
of recipients and their deeds he read
out in a loud voice the name of No. 1,
and looked expectantly at No. 1 of the
squad of braves. No. 35 stepped out.
The air was torn by a frightful rustling
of papers as the Staff Captain rushed
through his lists to see what had

happened. However, No. 35 got there,
halted nervously some five yards from
the General, heard with a blush what
he had done to deserve this horror—
honour, I mean—shook hands with the
General, who very kindly advanced to-
wards him; turned to the right; realised
that was wrong; turned about ; turned
half left, and wandered off stiffly—for
ever, in his own mind, a fool.
No. 2 (No. 17 popped out) was also
overcome with bashfulness, and the
General again advanced to pin on the
ribbon. By the time No. 4 (No. 29)
came out the General was yards away
from the table and the Staff were
busy running to and fro, handing up
D.S.O.'s instead of M.C.'s and running
back to the table again.
It was then that a brainstorm came
over the Brigade Major, and he picked
up the table and triumphantly carried
the whole thing up behind the advanc-
ing General. Everybody was so glad
he had thought of this, for everybody
had seen the necessity of it long ago
and was just itching to give advice. If
we had been civilians we should have
applauded the act.
The rest was simple. Whenever the
General advanced out of range the table
came up in close support—no fuss, no
bother; it was a wonderfully well-
executed manoeuvre and ought to have
a place in every well-conducted Cere-
monial of this kind.
I don't know what the Staff Captain
felt like after reading from his own
handwriting some fifty-five accounts of
the deeds done, but he looked like
death. He was only just in time too
on one occasion to nip off the D.S.O.
from a wrong tunic and replace it with
the M.C., and even then it turned out
that the owner was due to receive both.
And he heard with impassive face the
General say to a brawny Scot who had
just been up for the D.C.M. and had
come back for his Military Medal,
“I’m sure I've seen you before some-
where.” -
When the distribution was over we
settled down expectantly for the speech.
Peace talk had loomed large the last
few days and we had it definitely, from
a gunner, who knew a man in a Water-
column, who had a friend who was a
friend of someone who knew, that peace
had just been declared. And when the
General began we made sure he was
keeping the best news of all to the last.
It was a jolly fine speech, all about
the British army, our battalions in
particular, and what they had done in
the past. But we were rather sur-
prised to hear how much remained
to be done and learned with fortitude
that we ourselves were going to have
the chance to do it—and in the near

future too. It was a great speech,
and we all felt very bucked up and de-
termined to see it through ; but, when
we see the gunner again who knows a
man in a water-column who has it
from the friend of a friend of someone
who knows, we are going to say a few
things to him.

THE MUD LARKS.
CoNCERNING WILFRID WILCOx WILBUR,
MINOR PoET, of THE BRITISH SECRET
SERVICE.
ONCE upon a time, when the world
was wrong and there was still a war
on, I put my head into the Mess and
discovered Albert Edward alone there,
cheating himself at Patience.
“My leave warrant has come and
I'm off to Rome,” said I. “If Foch
should ring up tell him he'll have to
struggle along by himself for a fort-
night. Cheerio !”
“Cheerio !” said Albert I’dward.
“Give my regards to NERO, Borgia and
all the boys.”
I shut the door upon him and took
the road to Rome.
Arrived there I attempted to shed a
card on the Pope, but was repulsed by
a halberdier in fancy-dress; visited the
Catacombs (by the way, in the art of
catacombing we latter-day sinners have
nothing to learn from the early saints.
Why, at Arras in 1917 we-oh, well,
never mind now !); kept a solemn face
while bands solemnly intoned “Tip-
perary” under the impression it was
the British National Anthem; bought
a bushel of mosaic brooches and several
thousand picture-postcards and acted
the perfect little tripper throughout.
Then one day, while stepping into a
hotel lift, I bumped full into Wilfrid
Wilcox Wilbur stepping forth. You
have all of you read the works of Wilfrid
Wilcox Wilbur (“Passion Flowers,”
“Purple Patches,” etc.). If you haven't
you should, for Wilfrid is the lad to
handle the heart-throb.
In pre-war days he was to be met
with in London drawing-rooms about
tea-time, wearing his mane rather
longer than is done in the best mena-
geries. And now behold him in mili-
tary disguise parading the Eternal
City'
“What may you be doing here?” I
gasped.
He put his fingers to his lips. “Pist!”
Then, pushing me into the lift, he ejected
the attendant, turned a handle and we
shot aloft. Half-way between earth
and heaven he stopped the conveyance
and, having made quite sure we were
not being overheard by either men or
angels, leaned up against my ear and
whispered, “Secret Service? That's
why I have to be so careful; they have
agents everywhere listening, watching,
taking notes.”
I felt for my pocket-case, momentarily
fearful that They (whoever They were)
might have taken it.
“And do you also have agents listen-
ing, noting, taking watches?” I asked.
Wilbur said he had, and went on to
explain that so perfect was his system
that a cat could hardly kitten anywhere
between Yildiz Kiosk and the Wilhelm-
strasse without his full knowledge and
approval.
I was greatly thrilled, for I had pre-
viously imagined all the cloak-and-dag-
ger spy business to be an invention of
the magazine-writer.
“Look here,” I implored, “if you
are going to pull off a coup at any time,
do let me come too.”
Wilbur demurred. The profession
wasn't keen on amateurs, he explained;
they were too impetuous, lacked sub-
tlety. Still, if the opportunity occurred,
he might—perhaps. I wrung his hand,
then, seeing that bells on every landing
had been in a state of uproar for some
fifteen minutes and that the attendant
was commencing to swarm the cable
after his lift, we dropped back to earth
again, returned it to him and went out
to lunch.
“And now tell me something of your.
methods,” said I, as wesat downto meat.
Wilbur promptly grabbed me by the
collar and dragged me after him under
the table.
“What's tho matternow?” Igulped.
“Fool " " he hissed. “The waiter is
a Bulgarian spy.” -
“Let's arrest him then,” said I.
Wilbur groaned. “Oh, you amateurs!
You would stampede everything and
ruin all.”
I apologised meekly and we issued
from cover again and resumed our
meal—silently, because (according to
Wilbur) the peroxide blonde doing
snake-charming tricks with spaghetti
at the next table was a Hungarian
agent, and there was a Turk concealed
in the potted palms near by.
I thrilled and thrilled.
Then followed stirring days. Rome
at that time, I gathered, was the centre
of the spy industry and at the height
of the sleuthing season, for they
hemmed us in on every hand, accord-
ing to Wilbur. I was continually being
dragged aside into the shadow of dark
arcades to dodge Austrian admirals
disguised as dustmen, rushed up black
alleys to escape the machinations of
Bolshevik adventuresses parading as
parish priests, and submerged in foun-
tains to avoid the evil eyes of German
diplomats camouflaged as flower-girls,
according to Wilbur.
I thrilled and thrilled and thrilled.
Also I bought myself a stiletto and a
false nose.
However, after about a week of play-
ing trusty Watson to Wilbur's Sher-
lock without having effected a single
arrest, drugged one courier, stilettoed
a solitary waistcoat or been allowed to
wear my false nose once, I gave Wilbur
the slip one afternoon and went on the
prowl alone.
About four of the clock my investi-
gations took me to Vermicelli's. At a
small marble table, lapping up ices as a
kitten laps cream, I beheld Temporary
Second-Lieutenant Mervyn Esmond.
You all of you remember Mervyn
Esmond, him of the spats, the eyeglass
and grey top-hat, who used to gambolso
gracefully among the Frivolity Beauty
Chorus singing “Billy of Piccadilly.”
You must remember Mervyn Esmond.
But that was the Esmond of old
days; for a long time past he has been
doing sterling work in command of an
army pierrot troupe.
I sat down beside him, stole his ice
and finished it for him.
t

“And now what are you doing here?”
I asked.
“I’ve come down from the line to
get some new dresses for Queenie,” he
replied.
“She-he, that is—is abso-
lutely in rags, bursts his corsets and a
pair of silk stockings every perform-
ance—very expensive item.”
I had better explain here and now
that Queenie is the leading lady in
Mervyn's troupe. She-he, that is—
started her—his—military career as an
artillery driver, but was discovered to
be the possessor of a very shrill falsetto
voice and dedicated to female iuxper-
sonations forthwith.
“She-he-is round at the dress-
maker's now,” Mervyn went on, “wrest-
ling with half-a-dozen hysterical man-
nequins. I'm getting him up regard-
less. Listen. Dainty minon georgette

meuse over-tunic embroidered with

“Stop!” I thundered;

Mervyn apologised, wrapped himself
round another ice and asked me how I

Having first ascertained that there
were no enemy agents secreted under
the table, I unburdened my soul to him
concerning Wilbur and the coups that
never came off.
Hé'stared at me for a few moments,
his eyes twinkling; them he leaned over
the table.
“My active brain has evolved a
be-autiful plan,” said he, “It’s yours
for another ice.”
I bought it.
I found Wilbur sleuthing the crowd
from behind a tall tumbler in the
Excelsior lounge, and, dragging him
into the lift, hung it up half-way be-
tween here and hereafter, and whis-
pered my great news.

: “Where—when P’’ he cried.
“In my hotel at midnight,” I replied.
“I hid in a clothes-basket and heard
all. We will frustrate their knavish
tricks, thou and I.”
Wilbur did not appear to be as keen
as I had expected; he hummed and
hawed and chatted about my ama-
teurishness and impetuosity; but I was
obdurate and, taking him firmly by the
arm, led him off to dinner.
I hardly let go of his arm at all for
the next four hours, judging it safer so.
Five minutes before midnight I led
him up the stairs of my hotel and, tip-
toeing into a certain room, clicked on
the light.
“See that door over there,” I whis-
pered, pointing, “’tis the bathroom.
Hide there. I shall be concealed in
the wardrobe. In three minutes the
conspirators will appear. The moment
you hear me shout, ‘Hands up, Otto
von Schweinhund, le jeu est fait,' or
words to that effect, burst out and collar
the lady.”
I pushed Wilbur into the bathroom
(he was trembling slightly—excitement,
no doubt) and closed the door.
I had no sooner shut myself into the
wardrobe than a man and a woman
entered the room. They were both in
full evening dress. The man was a
handsome rascal, the woman a tall
languid beauty gorgeously dressed.
She flung herself down in a chair and
lit a cigarette. The . man carefully
locked the door and crossed the room
towards her.
“Hamsa,” he hissed, “did you get
the plans of the fortress?”
She laughed and, taking a packet of
papers from the bosom of her dress,
flung it on the table.
“'Twas easy, mon cher.”
He caught it and held it aloft. “Wic-
tory !” he cried. “The Waterland is
saved.”
He passed round the table and stood
before her, his eyes glittering.
“You beautiful devil,” he muttered
through clenched teeth, “I knew you
could do it. I knew you would be.
witch the young attaché. All men are
puppets in your hands, beautiful, beau-
tiful fiend.!”
The moment had come. Hastily
donning my false nose I flung open
the wardrobe, shouted the signal and
covered the pair with my stiletto. The
woman screamed and flung herself into
the arms of her accomplice.
“Ah ha, foiled again! Curse you!”
he snarled, and covered me with the
plans of the fortress.
I grappled with him, he grappled
with me, the beautiful devil grappled
with both of us, we all grappled. There
was no movement from the bathroom
door. We grappled some more, we
grappled all over the table, over the
washstand and a brace of chairs. The
villain lost his whiskers, the villainess
lost her lovely golden wig, the hero
(me) lost his falso nose. I shouted the
signal once more, the villain shouted
it, the villainess shouted it, we all
shouted it. There was no movement
from the bathroom door. We grappled
some more, we grappled over the chest-
of-drawers, under the carpet and in and
out of the towel-horse.
“Let’s go and grapple on the bed,”
panted the villain in my right ear.
“It's softer.”
A muffled report rang out from some-
where about the “beautiful devil.”
“lºor Heaven's sake, go easy!" she
wheezed in my left ear. “My corsets
have went.”
Then, as there was still no move-
ment from the bathroom door and we
none of us had a grapple left in us, we
called “Time !”
Mervyn sat up on the edge of the
bed sourly regarding the bodraggled
Queenie.
"In rags once more, twenty pounds'
worth of georgette charmeuse and minon
what's-his-name torn to shreds!” he
groaned. “Oh, you tom-boy, you!”
“Come and dig these damn whale-
bones out of my ribs,” said she.
I staggered across the room and,
opening the bath-room door, peered
within.
“Any sign of our friend Sherlock,
the spy-hound 2 ” Mervyn inquired.
“Yes,” said I. “He’s tumbled into
the bath in a dead faint.”

But, at your passing, WINSTON's eye
Will be unquestionably dry.
ON THE HOME FRONT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Cheerio ! as my
master would say. He is allowed out
of the hospital at last and goes for a
ride every day in what is called a bath-
chair, and of course my mistress and I
go with him. I wanted to drag it at first,
but my teeth are not strong enough,
so I sit in it and keep guard, because
even in armistice time you never know.
There are lots of Germans about over
here, and I don't trust them.
To begin with I sat on my master's
knee with my head sticking out over
the apron and my ears cocked ready for
trouble; but I soon saw that this form-
ation would not do. Only my head
was free and I could not rise to any
sudden emergency quickly enough; so
now I lie on his feet outside the apron.
It is colder, but I don't mind that as
long as I feel I am doing my bit.
We meet lots of my master's friends,
and all the ladies persist in petting me
and calling me a nice little dog. I don't
so much mind being petted and called
nice, but I do object to that word
“little.” How big do they expect a
fox-terrier to be 2
I notice that my master doesn't talk
about ditches any more, but about
tanks. I am not quite sure what a
tank is, but as far as I can make out it
seems to be a sort of cross between a
bull-dog and a bloodhound, which can
go anywhere and do anything. I should
like to meet one.
It is perfectly splendid to be with my
master again; still, do you know, Mr.
Punch, I find this nursing work rather
wearing. You see there are several
dogs of my acquaintance with whom I
have always had regular appointments
for purposes of mutual exercise. They
now come and sniff at my bath-chair
in a supercilious way, and yesterday a
cat sat down right in front of it and
yawned in my face.
They know they're safe because I'm
on duty; but it's a great strain on my
nervous system and I'm longing for
the time when my master will be out
of his bath-chair and able to join me in
celebrating the occasion.
Yours sincerely,
A MoRE-DETERMINED-THAN-EveR Dog.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Novemen 27, 1918.
Monday, November 18th. – In both
Houses an Address congratulating His
Majesty on the conclusion of the Arm-
istice and the prospect of a victorious
Peace was passed by acclamation. The
note of all the speeches
was the security of the
British Throne and the
popularity of its present
occupant. Dilating upon
the democratic character
of our monarchy Lord
CURzoN actually permitted
himself to speak of the
KING as “the spokesman S
of his fellow - subjects
throughout the Empire;"
andone pardoned the tech-
nical inaccuracy of the
phrase for the sake of its
essential truth.
The approach of the
General Election has pro-
duced thatuncommonphe-
nomenon, an anxious desire
on the part of Scotsmen to
return to their native land.
Loud complaint was made
of the inadequacy of the
railway accommodation.
Mr. EUGENE WASox was
understood to say that he
had been obliged to travel with a couple
of Highlanders on the luggage-rack—
a remarkable tribute to the solidity of
a structure intended “for light articles
only.”
In view of the impending Dissolution
win the Interrogation Stakes, though
his chance of catehing Mr. KINg on
the post is but slender. His latest in-
quiries covered a wide field, ranging
from the refusal of the Ministry of
Munitions to enable Glasgow to manu-
facture clog-soles to the excessive cost
of the lovely uniform worn by the
officers of the Women's Royal Air
Force and the enormous salaries drawn
by Scottish sheriffs.
Already there is a crack in the Coali-
tion. Sir LEO CHIozzA Money has
withdrawn his powerful support from

sembled an Election Address, he chal-
lenged the PRIME MINISTER’s scheme
of reform and put forward an alterna-
tive programme of his own, drawn on
the lines of full-blooded Socialism.

the prospect of having to forgo his
daily duel with the representative of
the Shipping Controller.

This afternoon, in the Royal Gallery of

now Sovereign of these islands, de-

of both Houses and the representatives

only, but the whole British Empire,

listened to in reverent
silence. But the cheers
were in our hearts.
After this solemn inter-
lude the two Houses re-
sumed their prosaic busi-
ness. The Lords heard
Lord BUCKMASTER, in his
zeal for freedom, declare :
that even Bolshevist litera-
ture should be distributed
without let or hindrance.
Lord Cave (who is still
acting as Home Secretary)
is all for the restoration
of our liberties within rea-
sonable limits, but has
no intention of giving free
rein to Bolshevism. |
In the Commons Mr.
BALFour modestly de-
clined Sir John JARDINE’s
suggestion that he should
give the House a résumé
of all the results, military,
political and economic, of
of the Dominions, the gist of which
our Eastern campaigns.
That, he indicated, was a task for a
leisurely historian, not for a jaded
Minister.
|
The House was rather disappointed
to hear that, though our soldiers on
demobilisation would be allowed to re-
tain their uniform, their great-coats and
helmets would not be included. Surely
the “tin hat” would be the most prized
memento of this unique war, and
should hang in every cottage and tene-
ment from which a soldier went forth.
How many millions they were we do
not yet know, but we know that three
millions of them have suffered death
or wounds or the imprisonment that
is almost worse than death.
For the first time in its history, I
suppose, the House received a new
Member in the uniform of a private
soldier. As the son of a former Member,
and the successor of Captain CAwley,
whose name is on the Parliamentary
Roll of Honour, Trooper HoPKINSoN
would in any case have received a
warm welcome. But I think that the
special vigour of the cheers that greeted
him was due to the proud garb he wore.
Wednesday, November 20th.--The
Lords, turning themselves into a
Salvage Corps, did a lot of cleaning-up
work necessitated by the sudden cessa-
tion of hostilities. Among other things
they passed a Bill dealing with that

“duration.” It was finally decided
that the question when the War should
left to the Government. Only Ministers
who have refrained from making private
bets on the subject will be allowed, I
understand, to take part in the decision.
The ignorant attacks upon Lord
NEwToN for his alleged inattention to
the welfare of our prisoners were warmly
resented by several Peers, who testified
to his unwearying efforts in their be-
half. But I think Lord Newton could
have done without the assistance of the
noble Lord who, with the kindliest in-
tention, no doubt, described him as “a
gramophone for other Departments.”
This country is no longer to be the
dumping-ground for undesirable aliens
that it has been in the past. As Lord
CAvR put it, there is no good in re-
patriating the Germans after the War
if they can come back by the next ship.
The FIRST COMMISSIONER OF Works
is a good deal in the limelight just
now. The latest items in our Nouvelles
Mondaines are that he did not take
part in the discussion of the Armistice
at Versailles, and that, far from com-
mandeering any more hotels, he has
actually surrendered one to its former
owners. This looks as if Peace really
were in sight.
Now that the invasion of the German
Fleet has actually taken place–Beatty
possidente—the trenches on which the
London Volunteers expended so much
muscular tissue are to be filled in. Also
devout ladies may use their motors to
attend divine service whenever the spirit
moves them—provided that it does not
move them more than thirty miles.
Thursday, November 21st.—I hope
our good friends on the Continent will
not imagine that John Bull is going to
revert to his old habit of thinking too
much about his creature comforts. But
it is a little suspicious that of the eight
Questions on the paper in the House of
Commons this afternoon the first four
should have referred respectively to
bacon, salt, sugar and wine; while in
the fifth, put by private notice, the
Hºi!, Mr. WATT, who does not
appear to be suffering from malnutri-
tion, complained that London was re-
ceiving all the good Scottish beef and
that Glasgow was being fed on “cows
of the worst description.”
And so, with the reading of the
KING's Speech and its appeal for unity
in peace as well as war, ended the
longest Parliament since CHARLEs II.'s
time. Its declining years have done a
good deal to atone for the excesses of
its youth. Still, as the American show-
man said when his pet lion absorbed
his better-half, “I kinder think the old

THE UNSUNG SONG.
Waughan Smyth is his real name,
but in pre-war days his insistence on
German efficiency and his brush-like
crest of grizzled hair prompted some
anonymous wit to rename him Won
Schmidt, and the alias stuck. Like
many other nicknames it was unjust ;
for Vaughan Smyth is as sound a patriot
as I know; it was an unkindly freak of
nature that made him look rather like
a German professor and inevitably sug-
gested the perversion of a perfectly
blameless patronymic. And his bad
luck has pursued him right up to the
end of the War. He has done most
useful unpaid work on various com-
mittees; but, as so often happens, he
prides himself on his slenderest title
to recognition—that of writing verses.
Since August 1914 W. S. has been one
of our most prolific but least pub-
lished War poets. Indeed his failure to
secure a hearing for his lyrics hurt him
deeply. But this autumn he seemed a
changed man; he radiated optimism
and had ceased to make sarcastic re-
marks about the popularity of Mr. JoHN
OxENHAM. So when I ran into him in
Piccadilly on the afternoon of Novem-
ber 11th I shook him warmly by the
hand. “Wonderful news,” I observed.
“Oh, yes, wonderful,” W. S. replied
without enthusiasm.
“Almost too good to be true,” I con-
tinued.
“Yes,” he rejoined, “almost too good
to be true; but I have the best reasons
for knowing that it is true.” And he
passed on with an air of preoccupied
gloom. - -
Later on at the club I saw Fether-
ston and demanded an explanation;
for he was one of the favoured people
to whom W. S. used to read his “lyrics.”
Fetherston, a genial cynic, would pro-
fess admiration for their style and sen-
timent and then wickedly recite choice
excerpts for the delectation of the ribald.
But on this occasion even Fetherston
was sympathetic. It appeared that
this summer W. S. perpetrated an un-
usually fiery ballad, which had been set
to music of an appropriately explosive
character. It had been brought to the
notice of a popular singer, who had
promised, when occasion arose, to in-
troduce it at a music-hall. The usual
delays followed; alterations had to be
made in the words and the music to
suit the taste and the compass of the
singer; but at last everything was fixed
up and the song was to be given for
the first time on the evening of Nov-
ember 11th. But, with that inhuman
want of consideration which men of
action invariably show to artists, Foch
and HAIG intervened, and at the
Countess. "ARE YOUR TRENCH FEET VERY PAINFUL2"
Tommy. NoT HALF, MA’AM.
YoU'LL HAVE HAD HOUSEMAID's KNEE, I DESSAY;
WELL, IT's JUST HOUSEMAID's KNEE IN THE FEET."
eleventh hour W. S.'s masterpiece was
withdrawn.
“Bad luck, wasn't it 2 ” said Fether-
ston. “It inspired me with the follow-
ing lyric:—
‘V. S. poured some terrible tosh out
On our chances of knocking the Bosch out;
But peace came too soon -
For the words and the tune,
And his song proved a regular wash-out.'
I'm sorry for him, but he almost de-
serves it; as you yourself have seen,
the wounded vanity of the bad poet is
his ruling passion even on a day of
National Thanksgiving.”
“Look at the social side of the programme.
I will take the number of subjects serratum.”
Daily Chronicle.
It seems to rhyme with erratum.
Our Modest Candidates.
From an Election Address:–
“I belong to no political party. Mr. Lloyd
George, with his great social sense and
patriotic instincts, reflects more nearly my
own views.”—Provincial Paper.
“It is believed that it will be necessary to
keep a million men in France for police work
in Germany.”—Daily Mail.
Surely after our past experience of
them the Germans require closer sur-
veillance than that.
“STOCK EXCHANGE NOTES.
Signatures are now being taken for a peti-
tion to the Committee for the re-establishment
of fortnightly settlements, but that no con-
tagion should be permitted. This appears to
be a reasonable request.”—Scottish Paper.
Absolutely.

[November 27, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CIVIL AND MILITARY.
IN the third-class carriage there were
already too many of us when the soldier
came in. He was a tall handsome young
fellow, with the prancing white horse
of the West Kents on his cap, an aqui-
line nose, fair moustache, a scratch on
his cheek and a front tooth missing.
Behind him, making far more disturb-
ance in the packed smoking compart-
ment even than his own extensive per-
son, trailed his kit: rifle, knapsack, odds
and ends of comforts from home—the
chief of which, he told us, was salt—to
take back with him (for although the
War was over he was going back);
other implements of warfare, and, above
all, his helmet.
His apologies for overcrowding us
would have constituted an introduction
had one been necessary; but khaki—
and ospecially so since the armistice—
is a great federator, and those travellers
near the door who offered to make room
for him were on intimate terms with
him at once. Among these, sitting op-
posite, was a youngish man in civvies
who had had a good deal to say already
on most matters of the day, from his
experiences on the historic eleventh to
the prospects of the General Election,
with a word or two on the surrender
of the German fleet and his mortifica-
tion that he was not there to see it.
As a talker he was without charm, but
he used a powerful eye with such skill
that he compelled attention, all of us
being cravens at heart.
The soldier, however, being at once
lured on to talk by one of his neigh-
bours, this other fount was, for the
moment, dried.
Yes, the West Kent said, he was going
back; at any rate his leave was up, and
he was to report at Victoria. Didn't
know for how long he might go or
where he would be sent. Didn't much
care now the killing was over—as he
supposed it was. Had had two years
of it out there and that was enough.
Only two “leaves” in all that time.
Had he been hit 2 Not really. Not
exactly. He laughed. He would show
us. Here he reached for his helmet
and displayed two holes where a bullet
had entered and emerged. About three
weeks ago. Thought he was a goner
then. It half - stunned him for the
moment. When he came to and felt
something wet on his cheeks and dis-
covered it was blood he said to himself,
“That settles it; Jerry's got me at
last.” But it was only the tiniest
scratch from a splinter—see?—and he
pointed out the mark on his cheek.
“That's funny,” said the civilian
talker with the powerful eye. “A
friend of mine had a bit of iron hit
him during the last air-raid. We were
walking together, going from shelter to
shelter, and the shells were bursting
up above something terrible. I dare-
say ”—this to the soldier—“you 've
heard them 2 " -
The West Kent indicated that he
had.
“Ah, but not in an air-raid."
No, the West Kent man had never
been in London in an air-raid.
“I thought maybe you hadn't,” said
the man with the eye. “Well, I can
tell you they were a bit thick, You
saw some rum things then, I can tell
you. I remember another of them
—let 's see when was it?” He went
through some mnemonic system, cor-
rected the result, re-corrected it, made
an amendment or two and decided it
was in September, 1917. “I was in all
of them, you know,” he interjected, and
raked the whole carriage with his con-
manding glance. “Well, about that
night—”
A momentary pause gave one of the
bolder spirits among us a chance and
he asked the West Kent what he was
doing when the armistice was declared.
He was at home on leave, he said.
He'd had a spell in the hospital. Not
due to the bullet through the helmet,
but to trench fever. He 'd come over
suddenly all over lumps and, when he
took his puttees off, his legs swelled up
proper, and, oh, the irritation 1 Made
him weak too, and he fainted. Next
thing he knew he was on a stretcher
with a doctor looking at him. “You’ll
be all right to-morrow,” said the doctor.
Then he went to sleep again, and never
woke up for hours and hours, and when
he did wake he was well, except for a
little shakiness.
“Shakiness? Ah!” said the young-
ish man with the eye. “That's what
the air-raids used to do for people's
nerves | Lummy, you should have seen
how it took some of them I remem-
ber on one night a big strong fellow
running into the chube where I was
with the tears streaming down his
face. Something to remember, those
air-raids, I can tell you.” He paused,
but instantly began again. “My
home's at Finsbury Park and there
was a house within fifty yards of mine
blown to bits. A falling bomb, you
know.”
The soldier grunted out acquies-
cence; he knew.
“Some people were terrified,” the
eye continued; “but others were just
foolhardy. So long as you stayed
indoors you were fairly safe, unless,
of course"—he laughed mirthlessly—
“your house copped it, like the one at
Finsbury Park. You see, my opinion
is that our own barrage did as much
damage as the Huns' bombs. That's
always been my contention. We shall
never know how many casualties were
due to our own barrage.” Once more
he paused a moment too long.
“So when I went before the doctor,”
the soldier was beginning, when the
train reached my station.
As I was closing the door behind me
I realised that the eye had won again.
“Doctors!” he was saying. “You
should have tried to get a doctor in
London the day after an air-raid!"
HOMEWARD-BOUND.
SAvour of blown sea-spray
On lips that dry to the wind,
Thoughts of the dockyards, thoughts
of pay,
And of comrades left behind;
To the measure of bows that drive and
dip,
Shiver and rise from each roaring
crest,
We count the hours as the gallant ship
Speeds from the twilit West.
And it's hot for the Longships, the
I, Zard and the Eddystone—
IIear the big screws thudding out
their miles of milky foam 3
See the Old Man on the bridge,
watching for the Manacles,
Edging her nor'east a bit, full-speed
for home 3 -
Calmed by the land's embrace
The sea but sobs in sleep;
Here, with a sombre, spectral grace
Dusk hillsides flank the deep;
Slowly our white track dims and fades,
Slower the grey hull shears the tide,
Till like a ghost in a world of shades
To the harbour of home we glide.
Sing ho we're passed the Longships,
the Lizard and the Eddystone—
See the darker sky and smoke over
Plymouth Town 2
Tell them we’ve arrived; blow a
blast and rouse them up a bit;
IIear the echoes answer & Hear the
engines slacking down 2
Now the tide laps and slips
Past our high bows, and soon,
Threading a maze of ships,
We follow the path of the moon;
Happy each soul on board to-night
As the deep gongs ring their wel-
come call,
And from aloft, by the binnacle-light,
The quiet orders fall.
Now the tender's spotted us sliding
in through Cawsand Bay,
Heard us colling, seen our signal,
watched us creeping past;
See the Batten eye a-gleaming, send-
ing friendly winks at us 2
Hear the cable running out 4 LIome
again at last !

David and Jonathan (HUTCHINsoN) were two dullish

places go, furnished with creeks and swamps and man-

great friends; but, as I have told you, dullish. When a
boat drifted inshore containing the inanimate form of a
young woman in a green dress, they put themselves to no
end of trouble to revive the stranger. Whereby Mr. E.
TEMPLE THURSTON got his eternal triangle in a somewhat
new setting. Naturally it was all up with the desert island
as an abode of amity. The young woman saw to that.
She was the kind of girl who put red flower petals to
cosmetic use, and powdered her nose as carefully before
sitting down to the rough meals of the castaway as if she
had been in West Kensington. Perhaps wisely, David,
who tells the story in snatches of diary, makes no reference
to her practical qualifications as a desert islander. Instead
we are told that both the young men fell victims to her
charm. It may have been so. Personally I found her
supremely unattractive; but of course one has to allow for
the absence of competition. Anyhow, the interest (if any)
of the situation lies in the problem of which mate she will
choose; whether the biceps of Jonathan or the brains of
David will weigh most with her. I shall not give you the
order in which they finish. But I may say that nothing
suitors, or the conviction that their author had before now
told a better tale.
Long ago Mr. HoRACE ANNESLEY WACHELL won distinc-
tion as a keen analyst of type and mass temperament, and
it is this gift rather than any subtlety of dialogue or breadth
of vision that gives his latest novel, The Soul of Susan
Yellam (CASSELL), a satisfying quality that is absent from
some of the stories of the War told by more assertive
novelists. The book might have been called The War Soul
of Rural England, for that is its theme, and the characters
in it are essentially types rather than individuals. Susan
Yellam, who will not accept the War as an influence in her
life, and thereby intensifies herinevitable ordeal of sacrifice,
is an exception, and for that very reason the least interest-
ing person in the book. For she is Susan Yellam merely,
while the rest are England at war. The cause obscures the
individual, whatever the intentions of the author may be.
Mr. VACHELL has written before for us of Nether Apple-
white, and he returns to the task of portraying its worthies
and unworthies with loving faithful care. And because
there are Jane Muchlows and Alfred Yellams and William
Saints and Sir Geoffreys and Parson Hamlins in every
parish in Southern England the reader comes back to the
haunts of Fishpingle with something more than mere
interest. - -

and “one of the cleverest psychological studies that has
appeared for some time.” . . . An ambitious politician,
Edward Parris, is desperately in love with two women—
with his affianced bride, Anne Whitebrier, and her brother's
wife, Edith. The Whitebrier offshoot, Bill, is really his son;

truth at the least convenient moment, informs her husband,
Wilfrid, of this fact on the eve of Anne's wedding. Where-

woman, hairy and yellow, very attractive and still unwed);
Edith, still erratic and light, but apparently (and un-
believably) faithful to the memory of Edward; and little
Bill, a morose youngster who tries to push a charwoman
over the cliffs for ill-treating his cat. The two women
conceal the dreadful secret of their connection with the
Whitebrier scandal by (among other things) calling them-

Mr. FRANK SwinneRTON in Shops and Houses (METHUEN)
sets himself a pretty problem in snobbishness. The
Wechantors were with good reason considered to be the
people of Beckwith, a small suburban town in which
“society” was run on rigid lines and gossip was the chief
dissipation. But even Miss Lampe, a woman with a
peculiarly active and poisonous tongue, was almost bank-
rupt for scandal when the local grocer sold his business
and was succeeded by a man called William Wechantor.

gether. Anne and Edward likewise. Poor old Bill is odd
man out. So much for IBSEN.
Mr. Roy BRIDGEs has written in Merchandise (Hodden
AND Stoughton) a clever and in places exceedingly powerful
story of Australia. (I give you the setting at once to save
you from the bewilderment I suffered by reason of supposing
the early slum-chapters to be laid in London.) The crux
of the tale is this—Edward's mother having left his drunken
and brutal father to live with a rich (but not unsympathetic)
man who adores her, is Edward justified in accepting help
from him? Or will this simply be to take a price for the
woman who cynically regards herself as merchandise?
The problem is further complicated by Edward's own love-
affair and the fact that a little ready money is desperately
needed for its prosecution. Mr. BRIDGEs tells the whole
thing in a vivid and picturesque style that only now and
then becomes a trifle too impressionist for coherence. As
a plot too the intrigue has the merit of continual surprise;
every time that I fancied myself seeing what was ahead
I turned out to be wrong. Partly that was because Mr.
BRIDGEs is too much a modern to follow any of the
conventions. Thus when Edward vows to get upsides with
which I seem to know
by heart, and the only thing that surprises me about these
people is that they did not rise in a body and extinguish
Miss Lampe, or at least put a shade over her. Altogether
a most attractive book, irreproachable both in style and
construction.
In Aid of Belgian Workers.
On Friday next, November 29th (2 to 5 P.M.), Mr. John
Aston is lending his house, 18, Belgrave Square, for a Sale
of Lace-work made in Belgium during the War. Notwith-
standing the fact that the Germans “aimed at creating the
unemployment which would furnish them with an excuse for
deportation” (to quote Viscount GREY's words) the Neutral
Commission for Relief in Belgium succeeded in not only
saving but improving the lace industry. Fifty thousand
women have been employed in it, and received decent
wages in place of the old starvation rates of pre-war days.
The profits derived from the sale of this lace-work, which
is copied from beautiful old Flemish designs and is regu.
larly on sale in Piccadilly Arcade, go to the Relief Fund,
and reach the Belgians in the form of food or clothing.
Mr. Punch asks leave to share the Queen's view (Her
Majesty having been a purchaser at a previous sale of
Belgian lace) that money spent in so good a cause cannot
be regarded as wasted on luxury.

THE HORRORS OF “PEACE.”
Protest of a British workman who loves
his country even better than he loves
the Labour Party.
[“Labour has warmed the Coalition that
opposition towards the young democracies of
the Continent will be disastrous. Labour de-
mands the immediate withdrawal of the Allied
forces from Russia. It stands for the imme-
diate restoration of the Workers' Interna-
tional.”—Extracts from the Labour Party's
Election Manifesto. Chairman of Erecutive,
Mr. J. McGurk.]
At times a backward look I cast
Upon the days that are no more,
The relatively peaceful past
When we were still engaged in war;
For then with patriot hearts at one,
Pledged to our land, the common
Mother,
We fought our common foe, the Hun,
And now we're fighting one another.
People with memories one-month-long,
Who still recall the Golden Age
When Britain's valour, going strong,
Enhanced her freedom's heritage,
Dazed by the hustings' hideous hum,
View with regret these changed con-
ditions
By which our new-born souls become
The sport of party politicians.
Myself, a simple labouring man,
Working with what I call my brain,
I'd hoped to figure in the van
Of Reconstruction, sound and sane;
But, just as I, with that fair aim,
Was putting to the front my best toe,
Into my eager hands there came
Labour's Election Manifesto.
In this amazing screed I trace
That we have let our life-blood flow
To make the world a nicer place
For our dear brothers, Soif and Co.;
That England spent herself for this,
That Labour might delight to babble
Of love with TRotsky's crew, and kiss
The reeking lips of LENIN's rabble !
O days with precious memory fraught,
When still we nursed, with faith
Serene,
Peace in our hearts because we fought
To keep our English honour clean;
And now—and that is why I weep
To think those happy days are over—
They'd have us fight like cats to keep
The Bosch and Bolshevist in clover.
Dearly I love my honest toil
(And seldom underrate its worth),
But dearer yet I hold the soil
Where I was planted out at birth;
So if, in England's cause, I shirk
The claims of other lands that hate
her,
Forgive me, Mr. J. McGURK,
For proving such a sorry traitor.
O. S.
NOT CRICKET.
MR. PUNCH, SIR, to you, who have
always backed the good cause and dis-
played the best common sense and have
almost never nodded—to you, Sir, I
appeal to bring your elderly relative,
The Times, to its senses.
For The Times, your elderly relative,
wishes, when cricket is again firmly
established as our national summer
game, to exclude the left-handed bats-
man
That row of dots, Sir, is to give you
breathing space to take in this amazing
proposition, as it is possible that you
missed it. It was made in the issue of
November 25. Yes, Sir, incredible as
it must seem, there, in cold print, was
the treacherous, the infidel suggestion.
O tempora ! O mores 1 - O CLEMENT
HILI, and Joe DARLING, F. M. LUCAs
and F. G. J. Ford, H. T. HEwBTT and
Wooll, EY | . .
The reason given is that the delay in
the field caused by the umpire crossing
over, and by other changes, when a left-
hander is in, is vexatious; as though
cricket were a revue, or a movie, or
any other frivolous spectacle, and as
though it were played to flatter the
impatient eye of the mere hunter of
excitement.
The article, Sir, in which this out-
rageous suggestion occurred was nomin-
ally the work of “A Correspondent.”
I rejoice to think that The Times
does not harbour on its staff so detri-
mental a contributor. But what kind
of a man can he be? What kind of
hold can cricket—real cricket—the game
which gentlemen have followed for a
century and a half, the game which
numbers such names as NYREN and
OSBALDEston E, FELIX and ALFRED
MYNN, PonsoxBY and GRIMston, the
LYTTELTONs and the GRACEs, the
STUDDs and the STEELs, ALFRED SHAw
and old CLARKE, ULYETT and Loh MANN,
Stoddart and WEBBE, FRY and RAN-
JITsINHII—what kind of a hold can
the cricket which these men perfected
have upon him 2 So little is he funda-
mentally touched by it that he would
eliminate the left-handers just because
they cause a moment's interruption,
forgetting what compensations they
bring in their beautiful freedom and
often superior ease. It was the pecu-
liar glory of F. G. J. Ford, of Middlesex,
to urge the ball to the ropes at a terrific
speed with a placid fluid stroke in which
no force was apparent. But we want
no more such wizards; they are a nuis-
ance; they bring into a game that
should be hectic and breathless an ele-
ment of delay !
Again, to the true amateur of cricket,
what could be more fascinating than
to see H. T. HEw ETT and LIONEL
PALAIRET opening a Somersetshire in-
nings; the one, the left-hander, so mas-
sive in his punishment and so rich in
unconventional forcing strokes; the
other, the right-hander, such a model
of classic style? But treats like these
are not for the correspondent of The
Times. No, Sir, they would but cause
ennui, provoke his hostility. For him
cricket must be wholly a rapid manifes-
tation of right-handed time-savers
No doubt some kind of modifica-
tion could-easily be devised that would
attract larger crowds to Lord's; it
might even be arranged that, no matter
how often he was bowled or caught,
Mr. JEssop, for example, should be al-
lowed to bat for a full ten minutes. One
despairs of no ingenuity or enterprise
on the part of the cricket-brighteners,
in whose ranks The Times is now un-
happily enrolled; but some other name
must be found for the result. It will
not be Cricket. It may be called “Rag-
time Cricket" or “British Baseball."
or “Tip-and-Run," or whatever other
alluring style can be hit upon by the
promoters; but it will not be Cricket.
Cricket is an intricate, vigilant and
leisurely warfare, and the fact that
every moment of it is equally fraught
with possibilities and openings for glor.
ious uncertainty makes it peculiarly
the delight of intelligent observers, none
of whom finds dulness in the specta-
cle of a batsman, no matter how stub-
born, defending his wicket successfully
against eleven opponents. Nor does it
occur to them to ask him for gallery
effects. First-class cricket calls for
such very special gifts of temperament
and skill that only the fittest survive;
and all their actions are worth study.
Left-handers are particularly inter-
esting because of the embarrassment
they offer to many bowlers and because
of certain strokes natural to them which
have no exact counterpart among right-
handed men. The left-hander's strategy
is often completely different. Above
all he still is usually able to hit to leg,
which the right-handers too often can-
not do. But to labour the point is ab-
surd ; one has only to recall such left-
handers as I have named to realise how
monstrous is The Times' suggestion. It
is for you, Mr. Punch, Sir, to convince
it of error.
“Mr. Asquith, in a foreword to a pamphlet
issued by the Liberal Publication Depart-
ment, says: ‘The successful solution of pro.
blems of social reconstruction will depend
upon . . . our determination to make the new
era to which we are looking forward one in
which a humane and civilised wife shall be
within reach of every man."

[DECEMBER 4, 1918.
“Mummy, why DoEs DADDY KEEP on READING THE PAPER 3"
“HE wanTs To SEE THE NEWS, DEAR.”
“BUT I THOUGHT THE WAR WAS over.”
THE WATCH DOGS.
LXXVII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, It is all very
nice about this armistice, and I should
be the last to grudge you all your inno-
cent rejoicing. But life is a serious
thing and must be taken seriously.
These great wars are not without a
certain importance of their own, but
they must not be allowed to divert
attention from more pressing matters.
There is the question of my pay, for
example.
When, at the beginning of this year,
it was decided that my work on the
Western Front was complete, that
matters there might be left to take their
course and that I must be transferred
to handle matters elsewhere, I took my
old friend, the War Office, fully into my
confidence in dealing with the personal
aspect. I pointed out that I was one of
those persons, too few, alas! in these
days, who havenointerestin themselves,
but merely wish their very remarkable
capabilities to be fully utilised for the
nation's good.
There was a subdued outburst of
applause when I stated this, and to be
quite sure it was thoroughly understood
I repeated it once or twice. The W.O.
responded with a short speech, in which,
with considerable emotion, it recognised
that it owed everything to me person-
ally and regretted that the moment did
not admit of an illuminated address and
a handsome marble timepiece.
I replied that these things meant
nothing to me, and it was full com-
pensation to know that I had done my
duty. Meanwhile, however, since we
were on the subject, what about pay for
the future?
After some little discussion, which
tended to wander from the point, we
got down to the business aspect of the
new and highly important post I was
about to occupy. The suggestion of my
being graded as a General Officer and
drawing a four-figure salary was re-
garded as both brilliant and sound, but
for certain technical reasons imprac-
ticable, and it was eventually arranged
that I should draw the equivalent,
abroad, of the pay and allowances of
ordinary persons enjoying the rank of
major. It was thought well to hide my
light under a bushel, and the foregoing
was considered to be a useful disguise.
In order, however, that we should not
be deceived ourselves, we gave me a
fancy title in my new capacity, some-
thing imposing to roll round one's
tongue, at the end of one's signature;
one of those titles which begin with a
modest “Assistant,” but go on with
everything that matters, and give the
idea that there are two people running
this war, and it is the Assistant who
is really doing things, while the other
makes the speeches, takes the peerage,
and is received from time to time by the
KING at Buckingham Palace.
The W.O. was very proud of me, but it
did not, I am afraid, explain me fully to
its subordinate departments. Notably
it omitted to get straight with its own
Pay People, than whom there are few
more stupid and less understanding."
Unfortunately that fancy title was one
which carried no particular rate of pay
on its own; when the Cash Department
studied it from the merely cash point
of view they appear to have regarded it
as one so honourable that the holder of
it would be insulted by the offer of any
pay at all. Accordingly no offer was
made; the great public showed no in-
terest in the detail, and the still greater ||
Mr. Cox, being ever too polite to inter-
fere, sat tight and said nothing.
After having been a secondlieutenant,
a temporary lieutenant, an acting cap-
tain, and many startling and embarrass-
ing combinations of the three, I found

it a relief to be a simple major. True,
one cannot wear spurs to advantage in
mufti, and the outward insignia had
necessarily to be suppressed. But even
for such refined and sensitive natures
as my own there is a certain comfort to
be derived from the mere remuneration
—a comfort to which I made frequent
resort, until Mr. Cox, with that courtesy
but firmness for which he is famous,
called attention to shortcomings on the
credit side. This was in April last, and
it was only then I discovered that the
Pay Department were regarding me as
something greater and higher than they
dared intrude upon.
The correspondence with the W.O.
began on a quiet and friendly note—a
personal letter to an esteemed friend
commenting upon things in gº!
progress of war, criticisms of food, in-
quiries as to mutual acquaintances and
oh, by the way, wasn't there some
slight misunderstanding as to my pay?
The answer was as friendly—all well
at home, coal not quite up to the mark,
and no need to worry about pay, since
that would come all right, no doubt.
A slight touch of hauteur crept into
my next memo. My friends, I inti-
mated, would always be my friends,
and, rather than risk friction, I would let
the whole matter drop. This was, how-
ever, a matter of principle, and I was
always firm on principles. The short
reply to my reply to his reply was
a postcard, stating that the matter
had been passed to the responsible
quarter.
I won't take you through all the
tragic story; I will only say that I had
eventually to be extremely stern with
the W.O. I hate to bully, but the time
comes when it is necessary to take a
strong line. I took it, and, as the
months passed by, I went on taking it.
I will not brag, but there can be no
doubt that I got the W.O. thoroughly
under. If, about the beginning of
August, you noticed a subdued and half-
ashamed look about Whitehall (incon-
sistent with the good news then arriv-
ing from the front) I may tell you that
I alone did it. The W.O., taken firmly
in hand, improved in behaviour; they
wrote me most adequate apologies and
hinted at some very good times coming,
with the arrival of more arrears in
sterling than I or Mr. Cox would prob-
ably know what to do with. But for one
reason or another, possibly because the
Pay Department man had gone on leave
and taken the key of the cash-box with
him, neither the arrears nor the good
times ever arrived.
To be exact, I found myself well into
September and still nothing in Mr. Cox's
cellars for me. Think me weak, Charles,
if you will, but by now my moral was
%
“’ALF A PINT, Miss, PLEASE."
“No, YoU ’RE TOO LATE. THE CLOCK's STRUck.”
“OH, COME ON.—IT AIN'T FINISHED 'UMMIN' YEt.”
deteriorating. Pay is a sordid thing, office desk. It was a message, a tele.
but there is something about it which
makes its absence keenly felt. I will
confess the truth and tell you that it
got to such a pitch with me that simply
to hear a man jingling francs, even
centimes, in his pocket brought tears to
my eyes. It was more than I could bear
to hear other people commiserating each
other upon the disadvantages of the rate
of exchange and discussing means of
transmitting funds from England to our
neutral State, whereby they might get
the better of that rate.
And at last, after six months of
poverty, only relieved by glowing pro-
mises of an overwhelming credit at the
bank in the days to come, there fell the
final blow, which broke me completely
down and caused me to put my head on
my arms and burst into tears at my
gram, from the W.O. It was from the
Pay People. It was about Pay. It con-
cerned ME. It said: “Message begins.
You are strictly forbidden to have your
pay sent out to you in Bank Notes,
Treasury Notes, or coin of the realm.
Message ends.”
So do I.
Yours ever, HENRY.

The wholesale dealer in whitewash,
having satisfied a legitimate curiosity,
turned to me and, placing an amiable
hand on my knee, said, “'Ello, Boss,
this election's a puzzler, ain't it? Once
it was jus' reds and blues. Now it's
all colours, not counting females. 'Ow
would you vote?”
“Coalition,” I said.
“You're backing a winner this time,”
returned the whitewash - merchant.
“Ole Coalition 'll romp'ome. The worst
is there's three 'osses from the stable
runnin' 'ere. They're all for Coalition.
I don't know which to back.”
“Not for me,” replied the lady. “I
always said that if I vote it'll be for
them as boils the Germans.”
The general sentiment of the car
seemed to approve the boiling of the
Germans, but found it unfeasible.
“'Ow can we boil the Germans,
Mother, if we've made peace with
'em 2" protested the whitewasher.
“My 'usband's a soldier of the KING.
'E ain't a Conscientious Objector, charg-
ing double prices for everything.”
“I ain't a Conscientious Objector,”
retorted Whitewash; “I got no con-
scientious objections to nothing.”
A gentleman who carried a mangle-
roller on each knee as if they were
children broke in, “You vote Labour,
Mother. It's time we got a bit of our
own back out of the toffs.”
“I wouldn't give 'arf-a-pound o'
marge for all the Governments that
ever 'as been or ever will be thought
on,” said Mother. “I'm going to the
poll, I am, and I'm going to vote
against all of 'em."
“It ain't allowed,” protested the
whitewasher. “If everybody voted
against everyone what'd be the use of
'aving elections 2"
“Well, what's the use of 'aving'em 2"
“You'll 'ave to take things more ser-
ious,” burst in the mangle proprietor;
“you've got a stake in the country
now. 'Ere you are a 'ardworking
woman.”
“I wish my 'usband could 'ear you
call me a 'ardworking woman. He'd
set about you. If you'd stop pinching
mangles and leave respectable ladies
alone in tramcars you'd be better liked.
I'm going to vote against all of 'em.
'Ere, young woman, next stop for me.
And none of your ringing on before I
get down with this photograph. It'll
be a county court job if you smash it.
I'm going to vote against all of 'em,
and down with the Zepps and boil the
Germans.”
“’Ot stuff,” said the whitewasher,
wiping his forehead.
“She don't understand the solidarity
of Labour,” returned the mangle-owner;
“but 'er'usband 'll make 'er vote right.”
“Mark my words,” declared the
whitewasher solemnly, “she'll make
'im vote as she wants; but if they all
go voting against everybody what's to
become of the British Constitution ?”
“Terminus !” called the conductress.
It sounded like the end of the world.
THE MASCOT’S DOWN FALL.
“SPEARIN' aboot dogs as mascots,”
said the Corporal-drummer, “we had
a fair clinker in oor battalion at hame.
She belongit till the Sairgeant-Major.
A great big brute she wis, mair like a
Shetland pony than a dog, wi' as muckle
ill-natur' and pride tae the square inch
as a Prooshian Junk. But for a' that
she was a bonny beast an' wis a fair
ornament tae the riginent, especially
on Church parades, which, bein’ a
female, she attendit wi' the utmost
regularity.
“Noo Maggie—that's the dog—had
uliar tastes in dress. If ye wore
the kilt ye were richt as rain; even if
ye wore troosers ye wad pass as long
as ye had on the glengairry. But
Heaven help ye if ye wore a flat kep;
ye were fair fur it.
“At this time we had an auld Briga-
dier, a terrible haun' fur stalkin' roon'
aboot the camp eſter lichts oot, seekin'
whit he micht devoor. Oor tent wis
awa at the fit o' the lines; an' the auld
man used tae come past oor way, which
meant us daein' some quick-change
acts wi' the candle whiles.
“Ae nicht we heard him an' his
Brigade-Major come up an' then stop.
“‘Whit's yon?' said the Brigadier.
“‘A dog,' said the Brigade-Major.
“He wis richt. Maggie had gotten
aff her chain an' wis on the randan.
“‘Grr,’ says she.
“‘Guid dog,' says the Brigadier.
“‘Grr,’ says Maggie, no likin' their
flat keps name.
“Weel, matters had got tae whit the
papers ca' a deeplomatic impasse when
wee Geordie Barr, the drummer, wha
could imitate the Sairgeant-Major tae
the life, whispered, ‘See 'em aff, Maggie.'
“Efter that it wis jist like the pic-
turs. Roond the tents went the twa
o' them, wi'Maggie ahint them, growlin'
tae fair pit the wind up ye; then across
the parade grun' slap bang intae the
officers' mess.
“Of course whit happened then we
couldna see, but yin o' the Mess waiters
tell't us next day that the Brigadier
and his Brigade-Major had tae stand
on the Mess table wi' the battalion
officers haudin' on tae Maggie till the
Sairgeant-Major cam' across tae call
her off.
“Needless tae say Maggie's popu-
larity rose tae unprecedented hichts,
for moonlicht raids by the Staff wis at
a discoont for some time tae come.
The band a' said that mair than half
the glory belongit tae wee Geordie Barr
for his prompt an' soldier-like action;
but Geordie himsel' didna seem sae
anxious tae claim it.
“A fortnicht efter there wis a Bri-
gade Church parade tae be held in the
open-air. Of course Maggie wis pre-
sent, glancin' aroond an' pullin' at the
lead, jist bung fu'o' pride an' vanity.
“Efter we were drawn up the Brig-
adier entered wi'the customary flourish
o' trumpets.
“A' at yince he saw Maggie standin'
in front o' the battalion wither tongue
oot, lauchin' like. -
“The auld man edged roond ahint the
drums an' took up a strateegic poseetion
aside the Padre. -
º “Kindly have that dog removed,’
says he tae oor Colonel in his best
orderly-room manner.
“Weel, d'ye ken, as sune's he spoke,
Maggie stopped lauchin' and looked at
him peetiously. Then aff the parade-
grun' she wis led wi' her heid doon
an' her tail atween her legs as if she
wis ashamed o' a' the folk seein' her
doonfa'. - - -
“A week efter she wis found deid.
Some o' the lads blamet the Doctor for
pisenin' her, him bein’ aye in the dan-
ger zone so tae speak, through wearin'
a flat kep. But maist o' us is sure tae
this day that she perished o' a broken
hert.
“Ay, an' there's a moral tae that
story. Niver fecht the heid yins in

they?” said Ernest.
“I must be content with saying,
‘handsome young officer.’”

I rose and surveyed myself in the
glass. -
“These things are a matter of
err on the side of modesty. “Homely-
faced,' do you think? Or perhaps ‘of

The advertisement as finally inserted
ran, “Young officer, of homely appear-
ance and not ill-connected, would be
glad of loan of motor-car, or cash to
hire one, during disablement.—Box

To say that I eagerly awaited the
result would be an exaggeration. In
fact I was so doubtful of extracting any
response from a callous public that I
bet Ernest five shillings that I wouldn't
get an answer at all.
But I did; I got just one. It was
in a feminine handwriting, and ran: “I
enclose two-and-sixpence towards your
motoring expenses, for I feel that no
sacrifice is too great for our brave sol-

so romantic. And I inserted in The

It didn't strike me at the time that,
after paying The Brain-Wave's fee for
the insertion of this acknowledgment, I
was three-and-sixpence out of pocket
on balance; but when Ernest asked for
his five shillings for the bet I saw that
my enterprise had been rather expen-
sive. Thinking it over since, I have
wondered whether Ernest could pos-
sibly have been in collusion with my

of me, and that my total deficit of

[DECEMBER 4, 1918.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
THE SURGEON-PROBATIONER.
THE Surgeon-Probationer was very young indeed, and
our trawler was his first ship; but if he lacked the sagacity
of experience he fully made up for it by his great enthu-
siasm. He had an eager look.
“I don't like it,” said the Second Engineer. “I'd feel
ever so much happier if that case o' knives and forks he
makes such a fuss about was washed overboard some
night. I should sleep easier.”
It so chanced that just at this time there was an unpre-
cedented epidemic of good health among the trawler crews
in our area. In the course of a fortnight we had only one
“Very interesting,” observed the Surgeon-Probationer
critically.
“Put it away at once, Bill,” said the Second, “before
someone slips on it and hurts himself.”
“You 'old yer row,” snapped Bill savagely.
But he was obviously disquieted. All the afternoon he
wore a worried look and several times I observed him try-
ing to feel his pulse. By teatime he was thoroughly ill and
refused the steward's most tempting delicacies. The S.-P.
began to get quite excited about it.
“I feel mighty queer, Sir,” Bill confessed; “I seem as
though something was a-goin' to happen to me.”
“Ah,” breathed the S.-P., “I feared as much. Where
does it seem to catch you the most 2"
call for medical a sistance
—a suspected outbreak of
measles; but even this they
had succeeded in checking
at its source before we ar-
rived on the scene. The
ship's dog had been getting
into bad company ashore,
but a timely application of
insecticide prevented any
further spread of infection.
It almost seemed as though
| people refrained from going
sick on purpose.
º
All this was a bitter disap-
pointment to the Surgeon-
Probationer. He would scan
our faces anxiously each
morning, but we couldn't
summon up a symptom be- ?
tween us. When the third
hand hit his thumb with a
handspike the Lieutenant
and the Skipper had to ex-
ercise considerable tact to
prevent the S.-P. from am-
putating it on the spot; but
Joe was let off finally with
an antiseptic bandage and a
stiff dose of quinine. |
The real trouble began
when old Bill, the Mate, re-
fused a third helping of the
steward's plumduff at Sun-
“OUR FUTURE IS ON THE ZEE.”
Mr. WILLIAM Holie NzoLLERN (to it aster Wu.LIAMr HoHENzoLLERN).
- “Can't say exactly, Sir,"
replied Bill miserably, “but
I feel empty, like as if I'd
been scuttled a 'most. Can
you do anything for me,
Sir 2"
The Surgeon-Probationer
took his coat off and, after a
quarter of an hour's whirl-
wind fighting, made his
diagnosis. It was either
nervous breakdown or ap-
pendicitis; he leaned rather
to the latter view as offering
the greater scope for sur-
gical skill. Bill, reduced
to a mental and physical
wreck, was tucked up in his
bunk and made to drink
evil-looking concoctions
from the medicine chest.
The Second Engineer said
he wouldn't give ninepence
for the Mate's chance of
seeing another breakfast
served.
But Bill was still with
us when Monday morning
dawned, though he had
weakened palpably during
the night and had given up
all hope of recovery.
“I’m afraid it'll mean an
operation,” said the S.-P.,
day dinner-time. I remem.
ber seeing the look that came over the gunner's face one day
when a German submarine came to the surface within a
hundred yards of us. The S.-P.'s expression reminded me
of it somehow.
“Are you feeling unwell, Bill?” he asked sharply.
“Eh, me? Bless you, Sir, I'm champion,” replied Bill
hastily, “’Ere, steward, pass me over the rest o' that duff,
quick.”
“Wait,” commanded the S.-P. He regarded Bill earnestly
and leaned across the table to press down the under-lid of
his left eye.
“You’re looking pale; sure you feel quite yourself—no
lassitude or disinclination to work?”
Dill, a stalwart sailorman weighing well over sixteen
stones and bearded like a pard, passed his hand nervously
over his anatomy.
“No, Sir, I think I'm all right,” he said.
“Let me look at your tongue,” ordered the S.-P.
Bill a little shyly exhibited the member in request.
“Oh, wot an 'orrible sight !” exclaimed the Second.
- trying to keep the eagerness
out of his voice; “it’s the knife or nothing—your one
chance, Bill.”
“Oh, oh!” groaned Bill, burying his face in the blankets.
The cabin was rigged as an operating theatre, and the
Mate was lifted tenderly from his bunk and laid on the
table. The crew crowded round to shake his hand and say
good-bye. -
“Tell 'em ashore as I went down with flags flying,” said
Bill faintly. “Good-bye, Second; I forgive you all your evil
goin's on and hope you won't be punished for 'em as they
deserves. Good-bye, Joe; don't forget to oil the winch
when I'm gone West.”
“Any last request, Bill?” asked the Skipper.
“Yes, Skips; see that there's no splinters in the plank
when you drop me astern; an' if the 'Uns comes out, boys,
g-give 'em 'ell.” -
Then, while the S.-P. was poising his knife for the fatal
stroke, I burst into the cabin, waving a signal-pad above
my head. The news of the armistice had just come through
from the base.

In the excitement consequent on this momentous an-
nouncement poor Bill was completely forgotten. We
crowded up on deck, hoisting every flag we carried and
watching the ridiculous behaviour of the other trawlers
who had utterly lost their helms and were rolling and leap-
ing about like a lot of motor-launches in the stern wave of
a destroyer. The S.-P. was the first to recollect the urgent
business that awaited him below. - - -
“I must go and get on with the operation,” he said.
“Excuse me, Sir,” remarked the Third Hand, “but Bill
seems to have took a turn for the better by the looks of 'm.”
Following the direction of his up-raised finger we beheld
the figure of the lately moribund Mate standing, semi-
clothed, on the top of the wheel-house, shouting himself
hoarse and waving tangled lengths of linen bandages
wildly in the breeze.
“'Ooray,” he was yelling, “’oo-bloomin-ray for peace
and no early closin'!”
“It almost looks as though an immediate operation
might not be necessary after all,” observed the Lieutenant
drily.

THE WINTER’S TALE.
[“To save coal many groups of families have
arranged to spend alternate evenings together.
Each family will take it in turns to play hosts;
thus many sets of fires will be allowed to go
out.”—Evening Paper.]
Letter from Mrs. Henderson to her Sister.
Surbiton, 311/18.
DEAREST DI, I suppose you've read
about the scheme to save coal this
winter by families sharing each other's
fires? We start next week spending
alternate evenings with the Blakeleys.
I think it is a splendid idea—
quite mediaeval, in fact. Didn't
lots of people collect in one great
hall in the olden times—menials
sitting at the same board but
below the salt—and all that sort
of thing, you know? I'm sure
I've read something like that
in Scott—or was it MAURICE

Your loving WI.
P.S.—Of course the above ar-
rangement could only be carried
out with really nice people and
old tried friends like the Blake-
leys. On me s'entend pas avec
tout le monde.
Letter from Mrs. Blakeley to her
Brother, Lieut. Hanson, in
France.
Surbiton, 10/11/18.
DEAR PETER,-L think I told
you about our arranging social
evenings with the Hendersons.
You know how patriotic I am,
and I always did try to take my
share in the sufferings of the
War, just the same as you boys
out there; but I think that when
some people get hold of an idea
they become almost fanatical.
Would you believe it, Mrs. Hen-
derson actually had her two ser-
vants in the room the other
evening sharing the fire with us.
The servants looked thorough-
ly uncomfortable the whole evening, as
well they might. And with them there,
how on earth could I tell Mrs. Hender-
son that I had discovered my cook
sending parcels of food from my stores
to her brother in France, or that I meant
to give Mary notice next month for im-
pertinence? Really there was nothing
left for one to talk about. Some people
have no idea of the fitness of things.
Yours affectionately, MIRANDA.
Letter from Mrs. Henderson to her Sister.
Surbiton, 10/11/18.
DEAREST DI, We've started our
“social evenings,” but I must say that
the behaviour of the Blakeleys is a
little ridiculous. They “dropped in "
the other night actually got up in even-
ing dress! Since Mr. Blakeley hooked
that soft Government job Mrs. B. makes
herself quite foolish with her pretence.
I had Martha and Jane in as well,
so that the kitchen fire could go out,
because when one starts coal-saving
one ought to do the thing properly, for
it's that spirit of thoroughness that
is helping us “to pursue the war to
the bitter end,” as LLoyd GEORGE once
said, or was it LANSDown E?

able, poor girls. I don't know whether
they sat below the salt, but certainly it
was as far from the fire and Mrs. Blake-
ley as possible. And this morning they
both came to me and said they'd give
notice if they couldn't have “a place to
themselves to sit in at night.”
Truly the way of the patriot is hard.
Yours ever, WI.
From Mrs. Blakeley to Lieut. Hanson.
Surbilon, 2011/18.
DEAR PETER,--The Hendersons must
be effecting a great saving by spending
half the evenings of the week at our
house. They are accompanied by their
boy, Edward, aged eleven, who does
his home-lessons here by our light and
-- tº--- r---
–
using our ink. The worst of it is he
mutters aloud over his tasks, which is
a bar to any intelligent or sustained
conversation. Also, when in the throes
of arithmetic or algebra, he seems in
torment and scrapes our chairs unmer-
cifully with his feet. I think he ought
to do Scripture or something light and
less exciting the evenings he comes in
here. Yours affectionately,
MIRANDA.
From Mrs. Henderson to her Sister.
Surbiton, 22/11/18.
DEAREST DI, I don't believe
there is any more patriotism in
Mrs. Blakeley than there is heat
in her fires. She just uses the
Government and newspapers to
hide her meanness. Instead of
fuel she has a mixture of clay
and something else equally in-
effective made into balls. She
says she read about this in a
newspaper article entitled “Clay
Balls as a Coal Substitute.”
Bob, who looked very cold, asked
rather bitterly if it was in the
same journal that suggested the
eating of rhubarb leaves. After
this Mrs. Blakeley seemed rather
distant. We left early.
WI.
Yours ever,
Letter from Mrs. Blakeley to
Mrs. Henderson.
Surbiton, 29/11/18.
DEAR MRs. HENDERSON, -
Henry and I have decided to
drop “social evenings” and have
the usual evenings by our own
fireside. I fear the stress of pre-
sent times doesn't leave one
much energy to be sociable, after
all. Yours sincerely,
MIRANDA BLAKELEY.

up with colds and won't be out for
days. I fear we got a chill the last
evening we spent at your house.

given out that we did. But anyhow neither of us intended
to abdicate for ever. Just a week or two of retirement
and then back again to our Imperial destiny. -
Er-C. P. What's the good of talking like that if the
German people won't have us back? . .

be so lost to all sense of their duty. Surely they are aware

disgraceful suggestion that I ought to have gone to the

does not die in that fashion. He knows his country needs
him, and that thought will not suffer him to die in battle
however much he may desire to.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ENTRENCHMENT AND REFORM.
DEFoRE long most of us will, it seems
likely, relapse into civilian life, and the
question is being asked, “What shall
we do with our uniforms ?” A few have
already made up their minds. Some
think they will make useful and appro-
priate gardening kit, while others intend
to maintain them in repair and wear
them on such special occasions as birth-
days or local flower shows. My delight-
ful friend, Major Bounceby, proposes
to have his fitted upon a wicker frame
modelled on his own measurements,
which will stand permanently at atten-
tion, wearing all the major's accoutre-
ments, wound stripes and chevrons, in
a corner of the drawing-room, as a
constant reminder to Mrs. B. and the
irreverent young B.'s of what papa did
in the great war. - -
All this is very well, and of course
individuals will please themselves; but
the veterans of our suburb have decided
upon a concerted plan which we desire
to suggest to other communities.
We propose to form ourselves into a
so-called “Trench Club,” of which the
H.Q. will be a dug-out, specially con-
structed if a suitable cellar is not avail-
able. It will be designed to admit the
weather; and rats and other vermin will
be encouraged as sub-tenants. Members
will only be admitted in marching order,
with battle-bowlers, gas-bags and other
impediments. Ordinary conversation
will be permitted with respirators in
the alert position, but for political argu-
ments they will be worn as during a gas
attack, -
The motto of the club will describe its
object –“Entrenchment and Reform.”
All of us, while at the Front, have
dreamed in our dug-outs of the comfort
and security of home, and have glowed
in the mud with high resolves regarding
our future behaviour as domestic crea-
tures. Realising the peril of imaginative
forgetfulness, we have decided to take
steps against the obliterating processes
of time.
Attendance at the regular meetings
of the Club will be compulsory, and the
club-room or dug-out will be always
available for the convenience of mem-
bers who wish to put in overtime. This
possibility may arise in the case of a
zealous member who finds himself in-
clined to grouse at home about the
mutton, or realises that he has barked
at his wife. It will be considered a point
of honour for him to get into his uniform
and spend the rest of the evening at the
Club. Bullybeeſ and biscuits will be
stored on the premises, and newspapers
not less than seven days old will be
provided.
Should a member forget himself as
indicated and neglect to adopt the cor-
rect disciplinary course, it will be in
order (according to the constitution) for
his wife to remind him of his duty with
the phrase, “Wouldn't you like to pro-
ceed forthwith to the Club, dear?" the
use of the words “proceed" and “forth-
with " being recommended as a valua-
ble stimulus by virtue of their military
associations. -
If the proposals outlined above ar
adopted our old and honoured uniforms
will serve a not unworthy purpose.
CR00Kip HOUSE Toll
THE proud years have passed it and
left it alone;
No more with red blossoms its gables
are gay; -
From moss-covered thatch and from
mouldering stone
The rose that once wrapped it has
withered away.
No longer the gate to a challenge is
swung, -
Nor through it the old-fashioned
chariots roll,
But I can remember the sixpennies
flung
As we came at a canter through
Crookéd House Toll.
A little old woman all wrinkled and
brown,
Like a russet-red pippin left long on
the tree, - - -
Would stand by the gate in her clean
cotton gown
And bob to our elders and smile
upon me. -
'Tis long since the lady relinquished
her trust,
But still I can picture on memory's
scroll
The quaint little figure that stooped in
the dust -
To pick up our silver at Crookéd
House Toll.
When the moon's very round and the
night's very still
| And the cottage is guest-room to
goblin and gnome,
| If you stand in the highway and look
to the hill - - -
You will see the brown horses come
covered with foam ;
You will hear the light tap of each hoof
as it falls
And the chink of the chains to the
swing of the pole,
And see a white figure glide out from
the walls
To open the gate at the Crookéd
House Toll. W. H. O.

The old difficulty.
LITERARY RECONSTRUCTION.
A GREAT deal is written nowadays
about rebuilding and reconstruction,
but some of the greatest and most soul-
shaking changes are taking place with-
out exciting notice. In The Times of
Tuesday, November 26th, a vast scheme
of reconstruction was clearly fore-
shadowed in the heading of the first
leading article, but so far not a word of
comment has been uttered.
Let us explain. The article was
headed—
“RIFTs IN THE GERMAN FLUTE.”
Most of those who noted the deviation
in the phrase from the familiar form
probably put it down to a misprint.
But the idea is unthinkable. Misprints
do not occur in the titles of Times lead-
ing articles. The penalty is too terrible.
Besides there is such an instrument
as a German flute (it is mentioned in
Buncle). And, most important of all,
TENNYsoN is an “eminent Victorian"
and therefore fair game. The per-
version, we have the best authority for
saying, is only the pioneer instalment
of a wholesale and drastic revision of
standard quotations in accordance with
the spirit of the age.
This surmise has been converted into
something like certainty by a curious
discovery. A few days ago, while walk-
ing in the neighbourhood of Printing-
house Square, I picked up a small note-
book. There was no name and address
inside, only a number of adaptations ar-
ranged under subject-headings as thus:
Carmelite House.—“Panting Times toils after
us in vain.”
Cheese.—“Stilton a name to resound for ages."
Coalition—
“I could not love thee, LLoyd, so much,
Loved I not BonAR LAw.”
Housing Problem.—“Tragic basements.”
House of Lords. –“ Peers, idle peers.”
Nationalist Members.--"More Sinned against
than Sinn-Feining.
It may be objected that this is not
altogether a new departure. Did not
Mr. HARRY Cust, when Editor of The
Pall Mall Gazette, prefix the heading,
“The Coisoned Pup,” to a leading
article 2 True; but that was a transi-
ent ebullition, not part of a considered
scheme of reconstruction. This is a
more momentous development, for that
it will develop we have no doubt. Mean:
while, to use the favourite formula of
the hour, we can only bid our readers
watch the middle page of The Times,
Greek has already reappeared in a lead-
ing article, and after that anything is
possible.

incident of the Palestine Campaign —

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I chANGED my mind about The New Warden (MURRAY)
while reading it, because the latter half of the tale seemed
to me very much more interesting than the early chapters.
All the same I hardly agree with her publishers in thinking
that Mrs. DAVID G. RITCHIE has drawn any real picture of
what they rightly call “one of the most moving experiences
of to-day,” the war-change of our University towns into
camps. That transformation, wonderful and tragic, awaits
yet its chronicler. The Oxford of The New Warden is at
most a vague background of no special topical significance.
Peace, no less than war, hath her brainless ingénues, angling
for well-endowed Heads of Colleges, mislaying compromising
letters, even (though I trust rarely) purloining the small
change of the improvident. This in effect is the plot of the
tale. Will The New Warden be trapped by the blundering
and amateurish intrigues of silly little Gwendolen (aided by
his own Quixotic sense of obligation), or saved by a sensible
sister for the more suitable mate who is so obviously only
waiting to be asked? In the contrast between the three
women who wage their warfare over the body of the poor
Warden, Mrs. RITCHIE shows herself to have a more skilful
touch than her somewhat long-drawn exordium prepared
me to find. But to call an Oxford foundation King's was
surely to create needless confusion. Why should that home
of so much fiction, dear old St. Mary's, not shelter one more
romance? There are chapters, not the best, of The New
Warden which would have found an appropriate setting
within those venerable walls.
Once upon a time, and I am afraid it was a very long
time ago, Miss BEATRICE HARRADEN wrote a book called
Ships that Pass in the Night, and because she did I am all
the more regretful that I cannot say only charming things
of Where your Treasure is (HUTCHINsoN). Practised hand
as Miss HARRADEN is she should have known better than to
mix up fact and fiction in the way that she has here. She
seems to have written two books at once—one, a very in-
teresting account of the work of the Americans, the Dutch
and the Society of Friends among the folk of Belgium as
they fled before the German invasion; the other a somewhat
thin and plotless work of fiction, redeemed by its principal
character. Miss HARRADEN has made Tamar Scott so real
that when I have forgotten the people in more perfect books
I shall still remember the curio-dealer of Dean Street, and
her avarice, her love of gems, and her hardly-won generosity.
But one character does not make a good novel. The gist
of the matter is that the powder is excellent powder and
the jam is quite good jam, but each spoils my appreciation
of the other, and if Miss HARRADEN will let me I would
rather take them separately next time.
Sussex, the darling county of the gods of England, has
many lovers to praise her woods and downs and bonny
countryfolk, slow to friendship (and other things), but loyal
to friendships formed, shrewd and wise and solid. Miss
SHEILA KAYE-SMITH stands distinguished among these
discreet praisers. She gives us in Little England (NISBET),
for remembrance of these days of war, a portfolio of por-
traits: of honest Tom Beatup, on whose young shoulders
was thrown the whole responsibility of the farm by that
heavy-drinking yeoman, Mus' Beatup, and who went late
for a soldier because of this responsibility, but at last went
simply and finely as a Sussex man would ; of soft-voiced

Thyrza of the little friendly shop, Tom's liddle darling; of
mad minister Sumption and his wild gipsy-mothered Jerry,
who met the saddest fate of all, death from the rifles of a
firing party; and Tom's two sisters—Nell, the delicate and
dainty, who set her cap unsuccessfully at the rather feeble
padre, and Iry (perhaps the best study of the sheaf), honest,
passionate, rough of tongue, golden of heart. There is the
slender thread of a story stringing the whole together; but
the value of Miss KAYE-SMITH's book lies in the precision of
her observation and the love of Little England which inspires
her. Those who have the misfortune not to be Sussex folk
either by birth or adoption may here see something of
what they have missed.
There is an atmosphere of very cheerful determination
in Over There (Hodden AND StoughtoN), and as a record
of things done and seen it deserves a front place in any
library of War literature. Captain KNYvETT, Intelligence
Officer, Fifteenth Australian Infantry, was in Egypt,
Gallipoli and France, and wherever he happened to be he
was a keen observer of essentials. “I am,” he writes at
the beginning of his book, T
“a scout; nature, inclina-S
tion and fate put me into is
that branch of Army ser-
vice.” And then, for fear is
that he may seem to glorify is
his own speciality at the
expense of other branches
of the Service, he explains
that he does not know | \e
much about any other job
but his own, “and less
than I ought to about
that.” Well, I ask leave
to disagree with him, for
it is clear that he not only ºf
knew his job thoroughly,
but, also did it extremely 3.
well. I gather this from
his sturdy way of describ-
ing the incidents in which
the Bosch scored off him, . " -- -- - - - -
and from his obvious lack of any desire to “make a song."
about his own successes. This is the right stuff, and I
wish the best of fortune both to the book and its author.
I can't help thinking it a pity that Mr. Robert A.
HAMBLIN went to the trouble of finding such aggressively
facetious names as Shortmeal and Bellowglass for the rival
protagonists of The Lay of the Land (ALLEN), because,
intentionally or not, the effect is to create an atmosphere
of farce about a little story which belongs properly to
comedy. It is slight but, in a modest way, engagingly
told. The plot concerns two families, bound by ancient
ties of friendship, and their respective heads, the car-
penter and the plumber; and how the latter prospers,
even to the extent of building a fine house and developing
(by a nice gradation) into a Sanitary Engineer with a shop
in the High Street. The consequent enmity between the
two old friends is complicated, ſirst by the sadly unoriginal
behaviour of son Bellowglass and daughter Shortmeal, for
whom the woeful tragedy of Verona might as well never
have been written; secondly, by an ingenious situation con-
nected with the Bellowglass mansion, which (as the clou of
the whole matter) it would perhaps be hardly fair to reveal.
I have seldom met a slenderer tale in book form; some of
the chapters are so short that they are gone in the turning
of a page.
FORTY YEARS ON.
THE COLLAR-STUD CoNTROLLER AND THE BILLIARD CHALK CoNTROLLER
RECALL THEIR GLORIOUS FEATS IN THE GREAT PEACE.
and just now and then an undue preoccupation with the
obvious, I salute Mr. HAMBLIN as a genuine comedian, with
a pleasant and sympathetic understanding for his country
types, and (this especially) an infectious joy in country
sights which makes his occasional passages of description
altogether charming. Do not let me mislead you into
expecting anything great from The Lay of the Land; but
as an unpretentious trifle—the publishers call it a “relaxa-
tion"—it strikes me as very daintily done.
Wermelles is a booklet which describes itself as “Notes
on the Western Front by a Chaplain.” The author being
anonymous, and therefore modest, anything I might say
about Vermelles would only make him blush and give him
pain. This is a pity, for, before I noticed this drawback, I
had intended to eulogise his little book for its sanity, for the
simple directness (never without a sparkle) of its narration,
for its gentle lambent humour and altogether for being, as
it seems to me, a compendium of how a chaplain's duty
should be done and his book written. On its lighter side
I should have drawn attention to the admirable little
scene of dialogue which
explains how the following
announcement once ap-
peared in brigade orders:
“The M.G. (machine-gun)
# Sections from each Bat-
= | talion will rendezvous at
# the cross-roads just below
the second ‘O’ in Auchel
(Map 1: 40000, S.25d. 9.
7).” All this I had in-
tended to say, but as it
would only worry the
| Chaplain I must refrain. I
refrain also from making
public his name, which is
known to me; but I have
no scruples about exposing
(confidentially) the name
of his publishers, though
they seem to have been
| infº by his reticence.
They are The Scottish Chronicle Press, Edinburgh.
The text of Miss NETTA SYRETT's latest book, The Wife
of a Hero (SREFFINGTON), appears to be “Marry in haste
and re-arrange at leisure.” Having said this I have as
good as given you the plot of the tale. Anne was one of
those pleasant, wide-minded modern girls with a nice taste
for BARST drawings and the latest books, also with an agree-
able suitor hovering, as yet unvocal, in the background.
Unfortunately the outbreak of war and the chance meeting
with a khaki-clad Hermes with crinkly hair and teeth like
an advertisement proved altogether too much for Anne.
Within a fortnight she found herself married; three weeks
saw Hermes in France and his bride the writhing victim of
a family of in-laws, who tied up their cushions with pink
satin and knew less than nothing of Russian art. A tragic
situation, out of which Miss SYRETT, with her sympathetic
sense of detail, gets the most. As for the re-arrangement,
though foredoomed, it is not conventional. I was touched
to observe with what care Miss SYRETT (in whom, if I may
say so, something of the old Eve still survives) had been
careful to counterbalance her one agreeable man by crowd.

to have led several Pan-Germans to
suppose that British sympathies are

The workman who recently told the

TRUTH FUL WILLIE AGAIN.
Being a brief précis of selections from the Crown PRINCE's
interview with the American Associated Press.
I've done it many times before.
And once again. I'm glad to indicate
My attitude about the War
And prove myself to your good Syndicate
As blameless as a new-laid lamb–
Perhaps you might not think it, but I am.
True, I have led a soldier's life,
. But when, without consulting WILLIE,
They fixed the Day for starting strife,
I frankly told 'em, “This is silly;
It comes too late or else too soon ;
Believe me, it is most inopportune."
Dut who was I? I must obey
The clarion call of common duty;
So to the forefront, there to stay
With never a sight of Home or Beauty,
Save that I took, like other men,
Leave for a little fortnight now and then.
Itight in the line, for years and years
I shared with full participation
My cannon-fodder's hopes and fears,
Their daily tasks, their indignation
When LUDENDoRFF, that futile ass,
Told us to make a frontal move in mass.
Then came the Change; I lumped my pride
And put the question “What about me?”
And, when the High Command replied
That they could do as well without me,
Though sorely tempted to revile 'em
I tacitly withdrew to this asylum.
Mind you, I've not renounced a thing,
Like poor Papa, who 's abdicated ;
Yet would I toil, an uncrowned King,
To humble labour consecrated;
Yes, in some aniline factory I
For love of Fatherland would gladly dye. O.S.
A WAR-CHILD IN PEACE-TIME.
PEACE leaves Anne puzzled. To her it is an untried
condition of life. As far as her memory goes back there
has always been a war.
“What is peace?" she wants to know, and I haltingly
try to explain; but I know she finds it unconvincing.
With war it was different. She has seen the soldiers
and the endless processions of guns, with the baggage and
ammunition wagons following them; she has watched
acroplanes buzzing overhead and listened to the sharp rat-
tat-tat of machine-guns practising down in the valley
below; she has watched the signallers flag-wagging, and
has often been hurried away to a place of safety during
an air-raid; but now there seems to be nothing she can
get hold of, nothing to make it a real and tangible thing
now that the flags are being taken down and the cheering
has died away.
“Is peace over now 2 " she asked me. “Mr. Brown
has taken down his flag.”
I explain that Mr. Brown has only taken down his flag
because it can't stay up always, and that assuredly peace
is not over. -
" Will it be peace-time a long time? Till Christmas?
and my birthday ?”
Fven fireworks are not a symbol of rejoicing to her;
there have never been any within her recollection and so
she is not used to them; in fact they frighten her, only she
is too plucky to admit it.
“They are rather bangy, aren't they 2” she said, and I
felt her little warm fingers tighten on my hand when the
first rockets began to go up.
“But look at the stars; what splendid colours!" I said.
“Yes;” but there was no enthusiasm in her voice.
“It's very like an air-raid, isn't it?” she said doubtfully.
The rockets soared and whizzed, broke into wonderful
colours, then disappeared. . - -
“I think,” said Anne suddenly after a minute—and
there was a little note of determination in her voice that
I know very well—“that me and Teddy will go home now.
You see, if Dolly Dumps wakes up and hears the bangs
she may be nervis.” So she and Teddy were taken home.
“I've frowed away Dolly Dumps' ration-book,” she an- |
nounced the other day. Immediately the rationing order
came in her entire family (including the Noah's Ark animals)
were supplied with minute ration-books. Anne is seldom
behind in anything that is going.
“But what will she do about food now 2 " I asked.
“She can't get things without coupons.”
“Wasn't rationing cos of the War?" demanded Anne.
“Well, yes; but then, you see—” -
“It's peace now, so of course we shan't want them any
longer.” I weakly left it at that. -
“You won't never have to take cover any more,” I heard
her telling her Noah's Ark animals, as she was giving them
their morning tub, the day after the armistice was signed,
“cos it's peace-time now. Our soldiers have killed the
Germans. You ought to cheer, you know ; people may
fink you are pro-German if you don't."
“Don’t wake Teddy; I've just got him off"—Anne held
up a small warning finger as I came into the nursery—
“he's been crying dreadful.”
“Hurt himself 2 " I asked.
Anne went on rocking a ribboned-and-laced cradle, par-
ticularly feminine-looking, which sheltered Teddy's bulky
brown fur body.
“No, it's about peace,” she said. “You see I always
promised Teddy when he was a big grown-up man he
should be a soldier like you and go and fight the Germans,
and now he won't be able to, cos there isn't a war. He
cried dreadful,” she added.
“Poor Ted! Bad luck,” I said; “but a boy ought not to
cry, you know.” - -
“No,” Anne agreed, “I know he oughtn't to. I told
him I was dispointed too, cos I was going to nurse
the poor wounded Tommies when I was a grown-up
lady, and now there won't be any. But Teddy is only a
very little boy, that was why he cried; he's very brave,
really.”
“The poor dolls needn't be shut up in the dark like
that any longer,” I reminded her; “you've still got the
dark blinds up in the dolls'-house; the lighting restrictions
are off now, you know.”
“Yes, I know the 'strictions are off,” said Anne thought-
fully, “but those blinds was such a bother for Nurse to
fix, so I fink I shall leave them up till it's war-time
again.”
“Heaven forbid!” Anne looked
surprised.
I said fervently.
“The climate [of Mesopotamia] holds no terrors for them, it

WITHOUT COMPLAINING; BUT I DO OBJECT TO BEING CALLED “old Egg.’”
THE ROAD TO THE RHINE.
Thomas Atkins, after four long years
of indescribable unpleasantness, has
come into his own at last. You can
imagine his feelings as he fell into the
ranks for the first day of the general
march, no longer with the thoughts of
death and distinction awaiting him up
the line, but as a conqueror. You can
imagine the glow in his heart and the
fire in his eyes as the order came and
he turned his face for the great tri-
umphal march into Germany. But all
I heard him say as he humped the pack
on to his shoulders was, “Germany,
eh 2 How many ruddy kilos is that?”
Personally I had been looking for-
ward to the march.
great historic interest for me, and as a
Company Commander I have a horse.
It is not much of a horse and it is
astigmatic, but it's a horse and has
some kind of motive-power within it
which seems to propel it satisfactorily
if one keeps it awake. Stumbling Willie
is one of the old Contemptibles. Ex-
actly how he got into that noble band
I don't know, but it seems reasonable
to suppose that it must have been
through influence. Also I may tell
It possesses a
|look at it, say resignedly, “I’m going
to fall over that,” and over he goes.
He will then look you foolishly in the
face and say, “I don't quite know how
you got there, Sir, but you left my
back some moments ago.” For the
rest he has been shot at, shelled, bombed
and bayonetted, yet here he is taking
part in the great march—a very im-
portant part too, as you shall hear.
I left my battle-bowler in the com-
i. billet a mile or so away from the
attalion parade-ground. It was a bad
beginning to a two-hundred-mile march.
True, the thing was merely a tin hat,
and these trifles may be acquired
surreptitiously, but it was my very
own original tin hat, served out to me
when tin hats first came into fashion
and people thought it looked “windy"
to wear them. With eight minutes in
hand before the move off and a hard
slippery ice-covered road to cover, I
put spur to Stumbling Willie and bolted
off. Of course you can't really bolt
with Stumbling Willie, but you can am-
ble rather faster than usual. Festooned
with the usual articles of equipment, I
must have looked like a curiosity-shop
to the amazed inhabitants as we flop-
perty-kicked along the road; and, mind
|
forage bags, spare haversacks, etc., to
run riot under the influence of an extra-
ordinarily uneven action.
But we got on ; the noise may have
been deafening, but we moved some.
And every time he fell I was ready, aye
ready. We clashed and clanked over
the midden into the billet well on time,
and the inhabitants rushed from the
cellars, thinking the Uhlans had re-
turned. Madam, bless her heart,
recovered when she heard my “Donnez-
moi mon chapeau, très vite, s'il vous
plait,” and the return journey began
under the happiest of auspices; we
did not fall over the missing flagstone
as had been our wont for several days.
What possessed me then I do not
know, unless it was some of that devil-
may-care spirit left over since the War
ceased, which I thought had better be
used up harmlessly. Anyhow, I turned
Stumbling Willie off the road (since the
way led down an ice-covered country
lane) and tried a spirited canter through
country which, if you had a map of
the district, you would know is what
is called “close country.”—orchards,
hedges and other obstacles.
Any ordinary horse would follow
a nice grassy track along the side of
you that if the old boy sees a lump in you, Stumbling Willie himself has a the hedge and love it; but Willie isn't

manly pace along good hard roads—
none of your fancy cross-country
tricks—and wise people let him have
his way. Bending low in the saddle I
maintained my seat and defied the
branches to scrape me off. Willie, I
discovered, had an awkward habit of
cantering at an angle of thirty degrees
from true north. Any horse with five
chevrons and a watered ribbon ought
to know that temporary Company
Commanders like to ride due north;
they don't expect much of a battalion
charger, but they do expect that. I
began to be annoyed with him. My
respirator became hopelessly twisted
round my neck. Of course, if you wish
to do so, you may attempt to guide a
half-blind horse across an orchard with
a tin hat and a few reins in one hand,
while disentangling a respirator with
the other. I say you have my per-
mission to try, but I warn you that it
wants practice.
The reins slipped for a second.
Utterly at a loss, Willie charged
straight into the hedge, pressing it
outwards gently and firmly with his
chest. Then he halted in the hedge
and took stock of our position. I
maintained my dignity with an effort.
“Hullo,” said Willie, “this is not
the way, evidently; we'd better try
another,” and off we went without fuss
or flurry. I will say this for the old
boy, if he does make a mistake he is
the first to acknowledge it.
“Cold morning,” said the C.O. as I
sneaked into my place; but I can't say
I felt the cold at the time.
Then the march to Germany began.
Our glorious objective had clearly not
been appreciated by Willie, for, after
going some ten miles and only falling
over now and then, he began to get
restive. Hold him in as much as I
could, he would keep sneaking up to the
rear of the company in front, pushing
his nose into the Second-in-Command's
neck and sneezing there. I could see
at once that the fellow didn't like it,
and as he wasn't in my company I
couldn't tell him to stick it out and that
the march would soon be over now. So
I pulled very hard indeed, and the re-
sult was surprising. Willie sat down.
Do you realise what happens to a
three-mile column on the march when
anything sits down suddenly 2 The
whi. Brigade behind closed up with a
hideous concertina-like movement. It
was dreadful. I had to get off, for I
make it a rule never to sit on a sitting
horse; I'm sure there is some Army
:
Order about it. Willie refused to move.
Prompt measures were taken, but no-
thing could move him. The C.O. was
so angry that he called upon his sub-
alterns to draw their revolvers, not
knowing that midday rations are usually
carried in the holsters instead.
Finally the dread order came. The
leading four of my company solemnly
fixed bayonets. Willie looked round.
It was enough. The sight of cold steel
—he has seen that kind of thing before
—was sufficient. The rebellion was
over and the triumphal march pro-
ceeded. L.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS.
LXXVIII.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Now we have
arrived within sight of peace, the ques-
tion inevitably arises, What about it?
Old Pinchard sees no more difficulty
about coming to peace than there was
in going to war; he says that every
Department will merely change its title
from something bellicose to something
pacific, and we shall all go on quietly
as before. With a slight extension of
premises, a rather more liberal allow-
ance of paper and a small increase of
salaries and promotion all round, we
shall have no need to fear the horrors
of peace.
Young Hartley, of the Diplomatic
world, takes the gloomy view and sees
the clouds of the Next War already
gathering on the horizon. He talks
darkly of the Far East, but mostly
because the Near West hasn't played
up to his earlier prognostications. For
four long years he kept on foreseeing
the end of the War within the next
three months; for a change he took
the line, last October, that peace was
much further off than ordinary people
were apt to suppose . . .
Sarton, also of the Legation, takes a
view even gloomier. He doesn't believe
there is another war in the offing;
what he is afraid of is that the War
Office and the Foreign Office may now
fraternise . . . --
That most military of all militant
militarists, Major Bowdler, of the Com-
mon Law Bar, already tends to revert
to type. Unless I mistake, he feels
the draught on his bald patch and
longs for the genial warmth of his wig.
He becomes daily more argumentative;
tends to preface his learned observa-
tions with the expression, “I am of
opinion "; even looks at us over the
top of his spectacles and invites us to
be very careful before we answer his
questions. He seems to have lost his
animus against the House of Holmen-
zollern; says that a man is presumed
innocent until he is found guilty; even
let drop the remark, the other night,
that the accused is entitled to the
benefit of a doubt, provided that the
doubt is a reasonable one. By this he
gives us to understand that he means
such a doubt as could be reasonably
doubted by twelve reasonably doubtful
men. He insists that every man is
entitled to a fair trial, even WILHELM.
Clearly he has his eye on the Brief for
the Defence.
Old Pinchard, who was always agin
the Government and everything else,
especially the lawyers, pretends to have
seen the official demobilisation scheme.
Demobilisation is to be by trades,
priority being given according to use-
fulness to the community. The last of
all is Landscape Gardeners; last but
one, Barristers. And Sarton foresees
that our methods will be confused to
the very end; the Landscape Gardeners
and the Barristers will be marched off
together and no one will be able to tell
which is which. This will lead to grave
dissatisfaction, possibly a general strike,
the Landscape Gardeners being enraged
at being mistaken for Barristers. The
subject tends to become wearisome
when Bowdler takes it up ; not because
he labours the defence of his own pro-
fession, but because he maintains an
argument against himself as to whether
or no the work of constructing trenches
is a form of landscape gardening.
The faithful soldier who acts as my
clerk out here tends to relax military
discipline in the excitement of the mo-
ment and to forget the difference of
rank dividing us. Trading on the fact
that he is old enough to be my father
and rich enough to be my uncle, he so
far forgot himself as to invite me to
dinner with him to celebrate things.
Yes, if you will have it, I so far forgot
myself as to go. He expanded into
views which can only be called Social-
ist, if not Bolshevist; he ventured the
hope that, when he re-established his
business in the City, his office-boy (a
temporary captain) would be kind to
himself (a most permanent private).
In the matter of the sexes he is
markedly less advanced. No man looks
forward to the resumption of his family
life with a keener appreciation. But
his office, he tells me, will never be
brightened by the merry clatter of tea-
cups and girlish laughter from four P.M.
to six. He asserts that, when on leave
recently in England, he travelled in the
train with an official of some Ministry
or other who was reading some general
instructions on that same subject
of demobilisation of war-labour. He
caught sight of one line of it—the head-
ing of a paragraph. This, however,
was enough to be going on with. It
read: “Women, how to dispose of.”
And of course the great question
always remains: when will the War be
really concluded, finished, over, done
with and closed down 2 Bowdler thinks
this will be somewhere about the year
of grace 1925—the year which he ex-
pects to spend in correspondence with
the Ordnance and Auditors' Depart-
ment on the subject of a certain pair
of gum-boots which were entrusted to
him in the early months of 1915 and
still, as it happens, remain in his pos-
session and use. We, who at heart
have a great belief in Bowdler, suggest
that it will be an undignified sight to
see one of the Judges of the High Court
endeavouring to explain, in writing,
how he came to purloin the property
of His Majesty's Government.
Yours ever, HENRY.

DEAR SIRs, I was astonished on

proved inaccurate and I am on the

mean the Air Force. The kit is there-
fore of no use to me.
This reminds me that I require a

you would be good enough to send a

earliest convenience and give him in-
structions regarding the other matter.

[By pigeon post from our Special Corre-
spondent, late Foreign Representative of
The Squeedumkrille (Mo.) Investigator.]
DAWN was breaking as I reached the
little border village of Spoofdorf. Not
knowing what the political views of
the frontier guard might be I had taken
the precaution of donning a costume
which with some slight alteration
would enable me to pass, as occasion
might demand, either as a Feldwebel
in the Bavarian Herrenunterwehr or a
Swedish carraway-seed broker. Noth-
ing untoward, however, occurred. The
sentry demanded my passport, but
seemed quite satisfied when I pressed
into his palm a leadenhalf-crown (which
I had been carrying with me for luck)
and an honorary ticket for the London
Zoological Gardens. The fellow in
fact grew quite communicative and
confided to me that before the war he
had played first bassoon in the Im-
much relieved when I assured him that formed plan of boarding the locomotive
he could rely on a warm reception.
Well pleased with this little jeu
d'esprit with which I had tricked
the simpleton, I pushed on to the rail-
way station. What memories surged
through my mind as I strode once again
the familiar platform ' Here it was
that, on that fatal Friday in August,
1914, I entered Imperial Germany dis-
guised as a Spanish trainer of perform-
ing oysters, with the idea of being
present three days later (disguised as
a hat rack) at the epoch-making con-
|ference between the directors of the
“D’’ banks and the Great General

at the last minute, braining the engine-
driver and conducting the train in the
direction I wished to go. As it was I
found a seat in a comparatively empty
first-class carriage and composed my-
self for a tedious journey. -
The journey however was destined
to be marred by a painful incident.
There were in the carriage besides my-
self twenty-three German soldiers and
an officer, the latter a trueulent square-
head of obviously Prussian antecedents.
I could see this fellow suspected me,
but I was quite taken aback when he
suddenly spat out the words “English
pig l’’ at the same time treating me to
a most ferocious scowl. What happened
next, however, was still more astonish-
ing. “Shall the Prussian upstart the
English milord with sandwiches in his
knapsack so grievously insult?” roared
a stalwart private in the corner seat,
and immediately there was a chorus of
growls, a crash of glass and the Prussian
officer passed out through the window
into the Ewigkeit.
Attention was now centred on me,
and when I explained to the company

that my knapsack contained, not sand-
wiches, alas! but a wireless telephone
apparatus and a couple of collapsible
passenger pigeons there were more ||
growls and significant glances towards
the window. Realising that the situa-
tion required tactful handling I imme-
diately began a series of lifelike imita-
tions (an accomplishment which has
got me out of many a tight corner) of
eggs and bacon frying, which quickly
distracted their attention from the
sandwich question. Later, when it
showed signs of reviving, I entertained
them by translating into German
selected editorials from The Manchester
Guardian. I am sure it was the first
time they had laughed since they came
out of the trenches.
Berlin at last ! Berlin, where in pre-
war days I had spent many a happy

those dark and fateful days of Novem-
ber, 1917, I arrived disguised as a
But no—that story is too big to be
told yet. Some day, when the Censor
is abolished, perhaps.
Outwardly at least the old capital of
Kaiserdom is but little changed. A
cab drove me from the station to the
hotel, and except for the conventional
“Nicht essbar !" (not edible) painted in
large white letters on the somewhat
emaciated horse and the absence of
springs (commandeered by the military
authorities) it differed in no wise from
the cab of pre-war days. The fare how-
ever—1,200 marks (about 1s. 7%d. in
English money)—has increased con-
siderably. As one drove through the
principal thoroughfares everything
seemed much as of yore. Now and
then a pedestrian would stop for a mo-
ment to kick an officer, but otherwise
things were normal enough.
Before we reached the hotel, how-
ever, an incident occurred which sharply
illustrates the Teutonic mentality.
Half-way down the Wilhelmstrasse
our steed began to show signs of dis-
tress and ultimately came to a stop.
Instead of flogging it unmercifully, as
I had expected, the driver descended
from the box and with the utmost
gentleness led the breathless beast to a
lamp-post, against which it leaned with
a pathetic expression of gratitude on
its intelligent countenance. Mean-
while the driver had disappeared into
a neighbouring Brasserei, from which
he presently emerged with a foaming
flagon of Hofbrau, which he proceeded
to pour down the throat of the ex-
charger. Then mounting to the box
he whipped up with a gruff “Wor-

wärts 1" as though half-ashamed of
being caught performing a kindly act.
For the moment I was deeply
touched; but this feeling was rapidly
followed by one of intense suspicion.
Was it, after all, I asked myself, a
pretty comedy enacted for my benefit,
under the misapprehension that my
disguise was that of an American
journalist? Instantly I decided to put
the matter to the test. Arrived at the
hotel I paid the driver, but, instead of
following my baggage into the hotel, I
darted behind a palm-tree and, clap-
ping on a pair of false whiskers and a
clerical hat, stepped forth again dis-
guised as a respectable Lutheran
divine. “I tell you it is the Herr
Hoover himself,” the cabman was ex-
plaining excitedly to the hall-porter;
“His Excellency the Police Commis-
sioner told me so."
I did not wait to hear any more,
but followed the head - waiter up to
my suite. It was Number 23. What
a thrill it gave me to enter once
again the very room where, on that
eventful morning of September, 1917,
I sat, disguised as the Hedjaz of
Morocco, listening to—but that story
too must wait. The light is failing
and my faithful first-class passenger-
pigeon is eager to be off. To-morrow
I shall go among the people of Berlin
disguised as a Tyrolean vendor of hot
yodels and hear what they think of
their new Government.

THE TWO SOLDIERS.
THE Armistice has not been in exist-
ence too long for some of us still to re-
member its birth; but a good memory
is needed, and if our recollections are
hazy there is reason enough in the dis-
tracting suddenness of it and the shock
of the relief. For a while it was too
unbelievable for the mind to gather
distinct impressions.
Someone who was asked what within
his observation was the most striking
change in England during the War
replied that it was the spectacle of the
occupants of the stalls eating. What
would he describe as the oddest mani-
festation of the Peace? In any discus-
sion on the strange events of Armistice
week, although recalled with difficulty
after such an interval, enough examples
could be given to fill an interesting
reaching out towards the handle, but
not with any decision and not turning
it. The other was considering; his
face showed it, beneath the mask of
perplexity set upon it by fatigue and
peril. Then he shrugged cynically and,
giving another longing look at the
comfort within, turned away. “Better
stand somewhere,” he said; and off they
shambled at a run to force a passage,
where the occupants were most tolerant.
There is no particular moral to this
tale. One could be ironical, if one chose,
about the flags carried by many of the
passengers, who but for these two
soldiers and their companions-in-arms
(for, say what you will of statesmen
and generals, it is the fighting men who
win wars) would have had no flags to
carry and no rejoicing in their hearts;
but that is not the point. No one
carrying a flag and rejoicing for victory
will cease to turn away to find stand-
ing room in a crowded third 2 Is any

war-stained and travel-weary, on their
way home from the Front. Their boots
were muddy, their hair was matted, and
all the usual impedimenta, including
trench helmets, depended from their
bent shoulders; and they were anxi-
ously seeking a place in the train
which had just come in. My train
being not yet due I had leisure to
observe the rush for this one, already,
as far as third - class compartments
were concerned, too full. The soldiers
walked from window to window, peering
in and turning away, until at last they
came to a vacant first-class compart-
ment not far from where I stood. They
stopped and looked at it, at each other,
and along the platform. But they
did not enter; irresolution held them.
Meanwhile time was passing. . . .

The serious part
of it is, it was the soldiers themselves
who did not dare. Heroes they may
have been ; but beneath that heroism
was cast-iron tradition. It is one thing
to fight for England, risk one's life for
England, lose one's health for England,
endure every hardship for England, even
die for England; it is much less natural
to forget tradition. The air is filled
to-day, as never before, with rumours
of the new life that is to set in with
peace—the new aspirations and pro-
jects, the new creeds and ideals. An
army of Candidates is making Eng-
land noisy with Utopian promises and
pledges. Splendid. But I wonder how
long it will be before two tired British
soldiers such as those, with all the signs
of the wear and tear of war-winning
upon thein, will cease to baulk fearfully
at an empty first-class compartment,
hungry they'll find their bones fast
enough.
There is one thing my master is

extremely. It is about making things

weren't there at all, and you do it with
pots of paint laid on in streaks. My

in the right places you can make any-
thing look like anything else.
It is no doubt very wonderful, but I
don't think you could deceive a dog
that way. I should be sorry for the
cat that tried to escape my nose by
painting itself, though, if I were dis-
guised as a cat, I daresay I could take

BEOWULF AND OTHERS.
THIS is going to be a true story. For several days past
I have been haunted both in my sleeping and in my waking
hours by one mouth-filling and brain-shattering word. . It
came between me and my poached egg at breakfast—(we
keep our own eggs, thank you, and are now getting three
every day); it spoiled my enjoyment of shepherd's pie;
it spilt my tea; it wrought havoc with our week-end joint—
I having to carve owing to Binns' temporary absence, due
to the sequelae of Armistice fever. This word of terror was
“BEowULFl" Why did Beowulf go ramping and rioting
through my head 2 And what, in fact, was . Beowulf?
Was it some very delightful form of new food about to be
rationed by the latest Food-Controller 2. Or was it the
short name of the President of the Jugo-Slav Democracy 2
Could one throw one's favourite enemy to the Beowulves,
or could one be said to keep the Beowulf from the door?
These thoughts and others were chasing one another
through my head, when my eyes fell on a bulky book which
had just arrived. Almost mechanically I took it up; it fell
open amongst the first few pages, and there in front of my
eyes I saw the magic word “Beowulf.” I gave a shout of
triumph which had last been used on Peace night, and then
discovered that my haunter was not any of the things I
had imagined, but was an Anglo-Saxon poem, epic in design,
and actually the first specimen of English Literature.
This and many thousand other names of things as well
as names of persons—Prose-Writers, Poets, Sonneteers,
Formalists, Romanticists—you will find duly set forth in
their chronological order, almost to the PoET LAUREATE's
latest lyric in The Times, in The History of English Litera-
ture (JACK), written and compiled by Mr. ARTHUR CoMPTON-
RICKETT. The book is a monument of industry and excellent.
judgment. I have tested it here and there, and have found
it accurate and pleasant, thoroughly pleasant, to read, and
I congratulate the author warmly on the completion of his
labours. I also thank him on my own behalf for relief from
Beowulf, the meaning of which I have again forgotten. I
venture to point out that he has omitted the name of Sir
FRANCIS HASTINGs Doyle from his pages. The fact that he
was Professor of Poetry at Oxford should not be allowed to
obscure the author of The Return of the Guards and The
Red Thread of Honour, two poems which stir the blood like
a trumpet. . . . . - - -
At this point I may as well confess that this article was
intended for a review, but, owing to the attractions of the
subject, it got out of hand and has become obviously too
big for Mr. Punch's congested Booking Office. I shall
therefore continue it as an article. Had it remained a re-
view, I should have been tempted to sport with the Venerable
BEDE, who is a good second to the author of Beowulf in the
English Literature stakes. I will, however, omit him and
others of his kidney in order to make an appeal to Mr.
CoMPTON-RICKETT. My idea is that he should publish a
collection of bad verses, preferably by good poets, so that in
schools and places where they teach there might be ready
to hand a compendium of shocking examples by which a
teacher might be able to warn his pupils. For instance,
he might have got himself involved in excessive admiration
of TENNYsoN's In Memoriam. He would turn to my sug-
gested book to find a remedy, and there he would see the
description, given with great detail, of the wedding in this
very poem —
But where is she, the bridal flower,
That must be made a wife ere noon ?
(We have now got an extension till two o'clock.)
She enters, glowing like the moon
Of Eden on its bridal bower.
Here we omit a stanza or two and proceed as follows:–
But now set out : the moon is near
And I must give away the bride;
She fears not, or, with thee beside
And me behind her, will not fear.
. . . . The ring is on,
The “wilt thou” answer'd, and again
The “wilt thou" ask'd, till out of twain
Her sweet “I will” has made ye one.
The poet now shows that he does not object to a glass of
champagne. “My drooping memory,” he says, “will not
shun the foaming grape of Eastern France.” The scheduled
moment for departure, however, is at hand :—
But they must go, the time draws on,
And those white-favoured horses wait;
They rise, but linger; it is late;
Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.
Mr. CoMPTON-RICKETT will now understand what my
proposal is. If he thinks more of it and will write to me I
can give him many other examples. -
“BY NUMBERS.”
THE Padre droned on. I could have drowsed more com-
fortably but for those incessant “narsty 'acking corfs"
which are peculiar to church-parade services. Mr. Thomas
Atkins does the whole of his week's coughing on Sunday
mornings. -
Suddenly, as I learnt afterwards, the Padre must have
been stirred to retaliation by the great volume of opposition
noise, for he broke off in his recommendations to a clean
and sober life and fixed his congregation with a stern eye.
The pause was so tragic that all coughing ceased. Then
the Padre spoke again.
“In view,” he said, “of the amount of promiscuous in-
terruption that goes on during divine service all coughing
will in future be done by word of command. The following
detail will be observed:— -
“Cough ING BY NUMBERs.
“On the word “One’ throw the head well back and drop
the lower jaw, depressing the chin until the point nearly
touches the upper part of the chest. At the same time
take a deep breath. -
“On the word ‘Two' raise the right hand horizontally in
front of the mouth, back of the hand to the front; thumb
pointing upwards towards the right eye, top of the thumb
in line with the eyeball; fingers together.
“On the word ‘Three' cough sharply three times, with a
forward and backward motion of the head.
“On the word ‘Four' those who find it advisable to use
handkerchiefs will do so by withdrawing the handkerchief
smartly from the left sleeve between the thumb and fore:
finger of the right hand, with an upward and inward
motion, replacing it after use. Remainder will stand fast.
“On the word “Five' close the jaws with a click, return
the head to the position of ‘attention' during divine ser:
vice, and cut the right hand smartly to the side.
“Squad Coughing by numbers—One! . . . Squad-
Two!” (the movements were very well done for a first
attempt). Squad—Three!”
On the word “Three" there was a terrific clamour of
coughing, in all varieties of keys and tones and times.
“Practise that,” roared the Padre, his voice faint and
far-away amidst the tumult . . .
I roused myself in time to hear the Padre's winding-up
sentence: “And now, in conclusion, practise that mode
of life, self-abnegation and self-control, which I have re-
commended, and you will serve your King and country as
well in times of peace as you have in times of war."

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The wrapper of Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD's new book, The
War and Elizabeth (CoLLINs), calls it “a novel of con-
temporary life,” but you will not turn many pages before
discovering that “contemporary” is just what it most
happily and gloriously isn't. For the life of which it treats
is the life of last May, and this is December; and who can
estimate what worlds of difference lie between Primarily
one might call this a romance of obstinacy versus woman's
wit and the County War Agricultural Committees (those
much-abused bodies'). The obstinacy belonged to Squire
Mannering, who washed his hands of the War and wished
to bar his park-gates against the Committee's tractor, but
was converted by the capable and patriotic lady whom he
had engaged to catalogue his Greek vases and who consoli-
dated her victory by marrying him. Mrs. WARD tells this
simple tale with a technical skill which, combined with
the obvious sincerity of her own feeling upon the national
issues involved, invests it with unusual dignity. To read
it is to live again the emotions of six wonderful months
ago. Once or twice indeed I seemed to detect some
evidence of hasty composition. Why, for example, when
Elizabeth's first care had been the strict rationing of the
Squire's household, should we be told on page 182 that
food there was more plentiful since her advent 2 Also there
is perplexity about a picture that begins as an unques-
tioned ORPEN but on a second reference is changed—with
all the pomp of an errata slip—to SARGENT. These how-
ever are but slight matters and nothing to spoil the interest
of an admirably drawn picture of life in rural England at
its most critical hour. -
AGNEs and EGERTON CASTLE have undeniably the courage
of their good intentions. My fear is, however, that in
Minniglen (MURRAY) a fine purpose may have betrayed
them into, shall I say, overestimating the distance between
the sublime and the other thing. To confront a cynical
impoverished daughter of Society with a mystic Highlander,
who restores her faith and courage and inspires her with
love, was theoretically a quite admirable theme for romance.
But—. Anne was the heroine, and her, encounter with
the visionary came about by his rescuing her, lost on a
moor, when she was staying with some vulgar pre-war pro-
fiteers for whose son she was the destined bride. Naturally
the prophet proved too much for the profiteers, and Anne,
having given the heir his dismissal, settled down to wait
for her next meeting with the hero. This came about
quite pleasantly one night at Covent Garden, where she
saw an attendant conducting him with an electric torch to
his stall in the second Act of Parsifal. So they talked (I
don't mean during the opera, but later on) and courted and
finally wed; and, if we are to believe the authors, during
the whole of this time never a word was exchanged about
their moorland meeting. It was not indeed till the after-
noon of her wedding day that Anne so much as mentioned
the matter, and then—well, then it turned out that it wasn't
the original man at all whom she had married, but some-
body like him. Which of course was a very natural shock;

though I do think that, in treating the error as a ground
for instant separation, Anne's husband made too much of
it. However, the late war (I must really write that again,
the LATE war) restored matters to better proportion and
brought about the happy ending that I had throughout
anticipated. As I began by hinting, a book better in con-
ception than in execution.
I have an impression that some of the readers who have
revelled in Mrs. STRATToN-PortER's other books will be a
little disappointed in her latest, A Daughter of the Land
(MURRAY), because there is in it no more botany and ento-
mology (or “nature study,” as they say) than in many novels
by other people. At the same time there is all that wealth
of detail that the author has taught us to expect. We are
told just what everything cost and what people had to eat
and what they wore, and I must admit that this somewhat
primitive form of story-telling has considerable charm.
Being an American story it also has a great deal more

some reason which I :
have not yet fathomed, °
a distinguishing mark
of American fiction.

lot of her time in strug-

poverty, but she had
her exciting moments;

Swayneford (ALLEN AND UN wiN) is the perhaps not very
plausible tale of a formidable international secret society in
the service of Germany. The leading spirit is a certain
mysterious renegade Englishman, Dormer Swayneford,
always referred to by the sobriquet of “The Sleeper.” The
society transacts its awful business in the elaborately
camouflaged wing of an old manor-house. This business
apparently consists in the reading of long lists of the names
of German waiters out of the inevitable Red Book—a thing
which could, it seems to me, have been better done (or
omitted) and with less fear of detection in a private room
at a public restaurant. At any rate the conspirators were
of a most obvious pattern, and if any single local body had

LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE UNDEFEATABLES.
WHo are these heroes crowned with bays
Won on the stricken fields of War,
Whose myriad ranks, this day of days,
Tramp through the Brandenburger Thor;
While up the streets, with bouquets strewn,
A glad and grateful City sallies,
Whooping its welcome to the tune
Of Deutschland iiber alles 2
Who are these warriors flushed with pride
That come from ruined lands and waste,
Where by the blood-trail long and wide
Their track of glory may be traced;
That come to find their homes unhacked,
No hint of horror's deathly pallor,
Beer-halls secure and shops intact,
Thanks to their martial valour?
These are the noble Prussian Guard,
Taking their triumph; these are they,
Famed on the film and picture-card,
The undefeated all the way;
These are the Fatherland’s élite,
Sworn to the last man to defend her,
Who saved their country from defeat
By absolute surrender.
Nothing is here of shame or grief,
No jarring note to spoil the sport,
Although their late respected Chief
Is wintering in a Dutch resort;
Poor WILLIAM, how he loved these shows I
Oh, how he loved to be saluted
Yet in that concourse not a nose
Sniffles because he scooted.
Nor would you guess by any sign
Their scutcheon bears a single scotch,
Though the Entente has crossed the Rhine
And taken on the local watch;
Though this brave scene they figure in,
With self-complaisance slightly grisés,
Happens to be their own Berlin,
And not the Champs Elysées.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN VIENNA.
FIRST BRITISH JourNALIST To ENTER THE AUSTRIAN
CAPITAL.
STIRRING SCENEs.
(ExcLUSIVE To The Daily Lyne.)
Vienna, Thursday.
AccusToMED as I am by this time to demonstrations of
popular enthusiasm during what I may call my triumphal
progress through liberated Europe, the scenes which have
marked my entry into Vienna will remain a marvellous
and unique memory.
Notwithstanding my express desire that my visit should
be regarded as purely private and professional, the public
have insisted upon greeting in your representative the
Herald of a New Era. Having wired the probable date of
my arrival, I found drawn up on the station platform
deputies of almost every government that has been formed
here during the past fortnight. After the ceremonies of
introduction I entered a carriage and was driven towards
the Ballplatz, being greeted en route by the frenzied cheers
of an enormous multitude of spectators. Perhaps they were
saluting the great work of The Daily Lyre in the cause of
Democracy. Perhaps, on the other hand, they mistook me
for somebody else. Who can tell? Cries of “Long Live
America!” “No Secret Diplomacy ( " " Bravo Foch "and
others that I could not distinguish rose on all sides. Men
and women pressed up to the wheels of the vehicle, many
climbing on to the step in their eagerness to salute me....
As we progressed I observed at some distance another
crowd following, doubtless with oaths and execrations, what
I took to be one of the last of the discredited Germans.
The contrast is one upon which I need not dwell. ... Eheu
fugaces ! Tempus fugit. Nos et mutamur.
So far as I could judge, the populace, though war-weary,
is still in most cases well dressed. There appears to be no
scarcity of actual money, except (curiously enough) in my
own case, my purse and other valuables having, as I have
just found, unaccountably disappeared during my progress
from the station...
Later.—I have enjoyed a cordial interview with Dr. X,
who is at this moment probably the most arresting figure
in the ex-dual-monarchy. It was for me a strange ex-
perience to be received in that chamber, once sacred to the
whispered mendacities of Imperial intrigue, by an enlight-
ened statesman smoking a short pipe and with his feet on
the table. Herr X, who is by training a Conservative.
Socialist, with a decided bias towards oligarchic republic.
anism, was good enough to ask my advice about various
matters connected with the future of Central Europe, advice
which, I need hardly say, I was only too glad to put at his
service.
During the whole of our talk we were constantly in-
terrupted by crowds of enthusiastic women who invaded
the apartment for the purpose of embracing me with every
demonstration of the most touching welcome and delight.
Before I left I calculate that I had thus received no fewer
than seven thousand and forty-six kisses (not counting
those of an elderly and intoxicated workman who secured
admission by error), a truly gratifying result which beats
Brussels last week by more than two hundred, and has
left me still breathless.
Later Still.—An influential deputation has just waited
upon me at the Hôtel de la Presse, with a request that I
should allow myself to be nominated first President of the
Austrian Republic. As however the financial outlook ap-
peared uncertain, I felt myself obliged to decline, as your
salaried representative, this highly gratifying suggestion.
Still Later.—I have this moment learnt with mingled
amazement and indignation that the crowd which I observed
in the distance on my drive from the station was actually
surrounding an individual who claims to represent The
Morning Trumpet, and who has had the impudence to as-
sert that it was he, and not I, who was the first Entente
journalist to enter the city, and that his osculatory triumph
is in excess of my own. Kindly wire instructions, also
sufficient funds to defray hotel bill and fare to Buda-Pesth,
where I hope to settle this priority claim once for all.
P.S.—What about Berlin 2 [Nothing doing. You have
been anticipated in that quarter.—EDITOR Daily Lyre.]
“It is no exaggeration to say that there is hardly a single com-
pound here in which there is not an influenza patient, generally a
child or an adult.”—Nigerian Pioneer.
In Europe also, by a singular coincidence, the disease is
almost entirely confined to the same classes.
Charity according to our Bolshevists.
Why make good Republican Germans disburse
While the middle-class Briton has coin in his purse?
No, let England's indemnity rather be won
By stripping the native and sparing the Hun.

“WHAT’s THE DISTURBANCE 1N THE MARKET-PLACE: ”
“It's A MAss MEETING or THE woxſex who've chANGED THEIR MINDs sixce: THE MoRNING AND wast To ALTER THEIR voting-PAPERS."
LEAR ON THE GREAT WAR.
MY nephew and niece are never
allowed to see or hear anything with-
out receiving a reasoned explanation of
it. They can tell you where all their
toys were made, and they know that
the Nursery Rhyme is only history in
its first and most valuable form. No
respect for Crown or Cloth has pre-
vented my sister-in-law's teaching them
that “Georgie Porgie, pudding and
pie" refers to an early-nineteenth-cen-
tury monarch of regrettable tendencies,
and that “Little Jack Horner” repre-
sents a divine of a still earlier date
renowned for his self-seeking proclivi-
ties.
It was in the hope of inculcating the
value of nonsense for nonsense's sake
that I recently presented them with
the works of the immortal Mr. LEAR.
I followed up the gift with a call that
same afternoon, and, much to my grati-
fication, found them seated side by side
at the playroom table with the book
between them. They thanked me
politely and invited me to “come and
help them.” Miss Caedmon-Smith,
their governess, sat in the window,
absorbed in a volume of what I took to
be Hibbert's Journal.
LEAR's book stood open at the epi-
sode of the Old Person of Spain who
hated all trouble and pain.
“Ah,” I said genially, feeling more
at my ease with the children than I
had for a long time, “ah ! ‘that um-
brageous Old Person' worries you, does
he 2''
“Oh, no,” said Clarence, “Spain's
quite easy, thank you;
“He sat on a chair
With his feet in the air "
means being a nootral, of course. And
the Old Person of Rheims who was
troubled with horrible dreams is easy
too; of course they couldn't sleep quietly
even in cellars with the guns
“But I don't fink it's velly kind to
make fun about it, do you, Uncle
Flank?” put in Henrietta self-righte-
ously.
“And the Old Person of Buda whose
conduct grew ruder and ruder is the
Humgaryans, of course; but who is the
Old Man of Madras who rode on a
cream-coloured ass? I don't see what
that's got to do with the War. What
does it mean, Uncle Frank 2''
“It doesn't mean anything; they
don't any of them mean anything.
They're just fun. Look here—
“There was an old man of the Hague
Whose ideas were excessively vague . . .”
--
knowing whether to join the Ger-
mans or us,” crowed Clarence exult-
antly. “And just look here, Uncle
Frank; you know what this means,
don't you—The Old Man of Vienna
who lived upon tincture of senna? It's
the Emprer of Austrer; even Henrietta
knew that.”
“My poor children,” I groaned, “you
are quite mistaken. You think, because
LEAR happens to have used some of the
names you have been hearing lately,
that he was writing about the War.
He wrote long, long before ; and he
only chose the names because he had
thought of a funny rhyme for them.
Listen to this:—
“There was a Young Lady of Russia
wº screamed so that no one could hush
er.
That's pure nonsense, you see; it
hasn't really anything to do with
Russia—”
“But,” said Clarence, interrupting,
a thing he seldom does; while Henri-
etta, looking at me with intense
reproach, gasped, “We Lelovution' "
Shaken but not yet dompted, I was
about to point to the Old Person whose
habits induced him to feed upon rabbits,
when Clarence himself laid his finger
there.
“But that's the Dutch people, not “And that 's us, eating rabbits be-

cause we couldn't get any other meat,”
he said. -
“Eating too much afore we had meat
cards,” added Henrietta sagely.
Desperately I turned the page, moving
always backwards with an undefined
feeling that the nearer to the beginning
the nearer we must come to the non-
sensical quintessence of the book.
“Look at this,” I urged, striving to
keep the anxiety out of my voice; “this
couldn't possibly be anything but non-
Sense —
“There was an Old Man at Marseilles
Whose daughters wore bottle-green veils;
They caught several fish,
Which they put in a dish,
And sent to their pa at Marseilles.’”
“Ships what catch submalines ' "
declaimed Henrietta in tones of sepul-
chral triumph.
“You haven't thought about it, Uncle
Frank,” said Clarence kindly; “we knew
at once that the book was all about the
War d'rekly we saw the first page, with
Norway abserlutely rersolved to be a
nootral whatever happens.”
Incredulously I turned to the first
page and read:—
“There was a Young Lady of Norway
Who casually sat in a doorway;
When the door squeezed her flat
She exclaimed, ‘What of that ?’
That courageous Young Lady of Norway.”
I was saved from any need for com-
ment because at that moment Miss
Caedmon-Smith closed her volume and
rose, observing, “Time for silent study.”
The children followed her to the
schoolroom, leaving Mr. LEAR to me.
Determined to refute their absurd idea
I turned to the last page and was con-
fronted by
“The Old Man of Berlin,
Whose form was uncommonly thin.”
Shutting the book and opening it at
random, I came across
“The Old Man of Corfu
Who never knew what he should do.”
Internal evidence is all against me.
I see no help for it; the Book of Non-
sense will go down not to the nurseries
but to the libraries of the future, where
it will stand on the same shelf with
Lillibullero as an interesting broadside
of the Great War.
“For some days Private Theo pushed a
150lb. cart through the snows which covered
the vast stretch between London (Ontario)
and Canada.”—Provincial Paper.
With a view to eclipsing this remark-
able feat we understand that a British
Tommy has undertaken to propel a
300 lb. wheelbarrow through the mud
which covers the wide expanse between
London (Middlesex) and England.

1. Because I believe in LABOUR. Be-
cause I would rather clasp the honest
hand of toil than the effete digits of
entrenched plutocracy.
2. Because I believe in ENGLAND,
whose stately homes have sent forth
of their best to defend us from the
ruthless yoke of the ferocious Hun.
3. Because I believe in the BROTHER-
Hood of MAN, in the unquenchable
spirit of INTERNATIONALISM, in the
FREEDOM OF THE SEAs, the SUPREMACY
of THE WorkING CLASSEs and PRESI-
DENT WILSON's FourTEEN PoiNTs.
4. Because I believe in the EMPIRE,
knit together in its imperishable glory
by BRITISH SEA SUPREMACY, PREFER-
ENTIAL TARIFFs, an IMPERIAL PARLIA-
MENT and a PEERAGE For Mr. HUGHES.
5. Because I believe in FREE TRADE;
because I am convinced that no vindic-
tive sentiments should prevent the
early resumption of business relations
between West Piffleton and the Father-
land. -
6. Because I believe in a STRONG
PEACE, in the ExECUTION OF THE
ICAISER, ExPULSION of THE HUN FROM
our ShoBEs, Ton For Ton, and GER-
MANY To PAY For THE WAR.
7. Because I believe that the HoME
RULE BILL should immediately be put
into force.

THE RESCUE.
Jackson and Johnston were made
from the stuff of heroes. I do not give
their correct names because they hate
publicity like the plague, but they had
to be called something.
Jackson was a pilot and Johnston
an observer. They used to fly in an
antiquated seaplane, waste petrol and
destroy wireless sets.
Convoying and anti-submarine pat-
rolling constituted the work upon which
they were alleged to be engaged, and
one fine morning they set forth to down
some careless Hun. They should have
known instinctively that fate held no-
thing good in store for them, because
the engine started at the first attempt,
a thing which had never happened
before, and they “took off" with the
damage amounting to only a punctured
tail-float and a few broken bracing-
wires. -
The engine was running wonderfully
and must have been firing on no fewer
than six of its nine cylinders, and
this after an hour's flight. The thing
was unheard of.
Then the sixth cylinder went out on
strike (sympathetic) and the seaplane
began to descend. Johnston, acting on
painfully-gained experience, offered up
a prayer and waited for the worst.
Any book dealing with seaplanes will
tell you that the floats are for alighting
on, and there are instructors who do
nothing but show one how it is done.
Jackson, however, had ideas of his own,
and that was no doubt the reason why
he chose to alight on the plane's nose in
preference to its floats.
In this way the machine entered the
water and then turned over on its back
and threw observer Johnston out into
the main. Meanwhile Jackson had
managed to extract himself from the
top plane and dived bravely to rescue
his observer.
Then Johnston rose to the surface
and found his pilot missing, and dived
to pluck him from a watery grave.
With his lungs bursting and his head
swimming Jackson gave up the search
and ascended to get a breath of fresh
air; but every moment was of value
in a case like this and he dived again.
A second or two later Johnston's head
emerged for a breath. He was a brave
and determined fellow. Never would
he give up until every ray of hope had
vanished. So he plunged under again,
and this time clutched hold of Jackson,
and Jackson of him.
Johnston was elated; so was Jack-
son. Each had effected a rescue; so
each was a hero. Under this common
impression they arrived together at the
surface.
“Don't struggle,” gasped Johnston;
“you're safe.”
“Cling to the floats,” ordered Jack-
son; “you're rescued.” -
“Brain affected,” muttered Johnston.
“Must be wandering,” murmured
Jackson.
::: :: ::: :k :::
Do not mention rescues to Jackson
or to Johnston, if you value either your
personal beauty or your comfort.
CONCERT RECONSTRUCTION.
It is gratifying to note, from an ac-
count of a recent concert at the Albert
Hall, that an effort is being made to
break down the old barriers of con-
straint between performers and list-
eners, platform and auditorium. But
organisation is needed to establish this
friendly co-operation on a broad basis.
Isolated attempts are not enough ; we
need wholesale concert reconstruction.
And if it be asked what is the goal we
should aim at we can give no better
answer than in an imaginative forecast
of the ideal programme in the form of
a notice modelled, in regard to style,
on the impeccable diction of the musical
critic of The Morning Post :-
“The Old Beans Hall was packed
to repletion last night on the occasion
of the annual concert of Mr. Charles
Oldacre, the popular manager, a di-
versified and interesting programme
being presented for the delectation of
his appreciative patrons. Conformably
with the now established rule instruc-
tion went hand-in-hand with recreation,
and the artistic importance of the
various items rendered was enhanced
by the spirit of co-operation manifested
by performers and audience. The en-
tertainment was prefaced by a sparkling
address on the use of stinging-nettles
as a heat-producer in times of coal-
shortage, by Sir Guy Coughdrop, fol-
lowed by a momentous and memor-
able rendition of the Overture to the
‘Flying Dutchman,’ under the inspir.
ing baton of Sir Joseph Plank, wear-
ing the uniform of a Commodore of
the R.N.V.R. Madame Blara Tutt,
who was greeted with applause of
exceptional volume and intensity, de-
livered a charming little causerie on
the possibility of a scientific knowledge
of the Unseen, and concluded by draw-
ing a pig with her eyes shut, which
was at once put up to auction and sold
for twenty-five guineas for the benefit
of the Society for Compulsory Deep
Breathing in the Potteries.
“Several members of the audience con-
tributed to the gaiety of the gathering by
anecdotes, conundrums and imitations
of well-known performers, in particular
the travesty of Signor Marmosetti, the
famous pianist, and his simian eccen-
tricities, evoking demonstrations of un-
restrained merriment. The lights were
several times turned completely down,
which greatly added to the hilarity of
the audience. Mr. HERBERT STURGEoN
supplemented his violin solo—BACH's
meritorious ‘Chaconne'—with a horn-
pipe which he both danced and played,
a gratifying tour de force which was
highly relished; and Mr. Robert GLAD-
Ford enormously enhanced the vocal
verisimilitude of his rendition of ‘O
ruddier than the cherry’ by his tasteful
make-up as ‘the giant Polypheme,' in
which he achieved a literally huge suc-
cess. But perhaps the greatest and
most legitimate success of the concert
was that of Madame Blara Tutt, who,
on being encored in the famous temper-
ance song, “Dand of Hope and Glory,’
insisted on her accompanist singing the
encore verse while she officiated at the
keyboard.
“A delightful interlude was provided
by the exhibition of films showing the
larynxes of various eminent vocalists
during the performance of their favour-
ite songs. The second part of the
programme presented as its salient
items BACH's second Hindenburg con-
certo, with strategical comments by Sir
Joseph Plank, and the presentation of
prizes won in the Athletic Sports of
the North Balham Tolstoyan League,
by Miss Astra Carmel, the renowned
esoteric soprano.”
“WHAT THE LABOUR PARTY DOES
FOR WOMEN.
How IT STRIKEs A Soldifit's WIFE.”
Evening News (Labour Party Column).
The Labour Party may look out for
reprisals when the soldier's wife's hus-
band comes home.
“There were anti-dynastic demonstrations
in Berlin when several famous Hohenzollern
states in under linnen were smashed.”
Indian Paper.
They were evidently caught napping.
“On Thursday morning of last week a
public mark of respect was paid to Mr. —,
of Fallagherine, by a large number of young
pigs turning out armed with spades and at
once started digging out Mr. 's large field
of potatoes.”—Tyrone Courier.
We trust Mr. PROTHERo will make a
note of this, in the present shortage of
agricultural labour.
“The Ministry [of Food] are trying to de-
velop new sources of milk supply, and for the
purpose intend to make use of the motor-
lorries the military authorities are about to
release.”—Manchester Guardian.

"GRANNY, I AM GLAD we've Lived to see PEACE".
THE NEW REPORTING,
[A suggestion by one who feels that the
conventional “Applause” and “Hear, Hear”
convey an inadequate idea of the variety and
colour of the interjections at an average elec-
tion meeting.]
“GENTLEMEN, we are now, if I may
say so—(disturbance in north-east cor-
ner of the hall, with shouts of “Oo are
you a-shovin' of ?” and various incon-
sequent repartees)—we are now in the
proud and fortunate position of having
overthrown our enemies—(“You didn't
do much l’’ followed by a free fight
under the platform)—and having estab-
lished, let us hope—(piercing woman's
voice: “Wot abaht my son Jack?”)—
once and for all—(small boy bursts into
vociferous lamentation as his father
explains to him the precise domestic
programme for the evening if he doesn't
sit still)—upon a sure and lasting
foundation—(here Albert MacIsaacs,
junior, gives his celebrated imitation of
a donkey's “Hee-haw,” which is re-
ceived with prolonged applause and
shouts of “Encore!")—those principles
of justice and tolerance — (jumping
cracker in the gallery)—equality and
fair º The old 'un's drinking
your glass of water, guv'nor!”)—which
have always been and, I trust, will
always be the glory of the British
Empire—(loud cheers from the two
front rows, evidently stationed there for
the purpose)—and which it is now our
hope and desire—(bass voice from the
back: “Wot abaht beer?” and murmurs
of interest and approval)—to extend to
the world at large. (Subdued cheers
from the two front rows, who realise
that their previous demonstration was
premature.) These sentiments, gentle-
men, are not my own—(“Never
thought they were ")—they are the
nation's—(“Are you going to hang
BILL KAISER”)—they are in the air—
(shower of flour and pepper from the
gallery)—they cry aloud in the streets
—(sudden commotion as a small dog,
violently kicked from behind, runs
yelping down the passage)—they will
not be silenced—(concertina solo, with
unauthorised variations as the instru-
ment is swayed to and fro by rival
factions) — they are shared by the
humble Slav and the lowly Jugo—
(“Three cheers for the Jugos!”)—as
well as by that illustrious and far-seeing
statesman—(great uproar, during which
two Bolsheviks, one unimpeachable
atriot, and one timid man who was
etween them are removed to hospital)
—Professor MAs ARYK; and we may be
as sure as we are that to-morrow's sun
will rise—(“Wait and see!” followed
instantly by shrill cat-calls and a voice,
“Where's poor old Asquith ?”)—that
these principles will prevail—(“Oo
poached the bad egg’” and much
laughter as a local joke runs in whispers
round the hall)—and even in our own
time—(diversion by an elector's baby,
who shrieks for nourishment and is con-
soled amid a movement of sympathetic
interest in the vicinity)—Truth and
Right will take their place, supreme and
unchallenged, upon the throne of the
universe. (Dead silence, for the front
benches are not going to be taken in
this time.)

FURNishing a flat in the piping times
of peace—I mean the kind of peace
that precedes war, not that which
follows it and plunges us into elections
and other costlinesses—furnishing even
then was no particular joke; but with-
in the past few weeks it has been a
test of fortitude equal almost to mar-
tyrdom. Everything is not only dearer
but scarcer; and the War excuse is put
forward so often that one is a thousand
times a day at the end of all patience.
I am convinced that placards ought to
be prepared by some enterprising firm
of printers, to be suspended from the
necks both of salesmen and customers,
just to make shopping a little less
arduous. For a salesman something
like this:–
We are wholly blameless as to º,
height of prices and lowness of
stock, to defective quality and
broken promises. This is a
perfectly-managed firm, but the
War has disorganised every-
thing.
and for the customer:-
Please don't mention either the
War or the Peace. Show ºne
what you have without refer-
ence to what you have not.
Above all don't say anything
about the cheapness that used
to be, because that breaks my
| heart.
In default of these placards I have
had a very painful time among the
Frock-coats in whose hands the retail
furnishing trade reposes; and I have
“priced" so many articles beyond my
means that it has become a positive
agony to enter any well - appointed
room. All my old content to be stand-
ing before the fire or installed in an arm-
chair waiting for dinner to be announced
has now turned to gall and envy.
“Good Heavens !” I say to myself as
my eye perceives the hearth-rug, “how
on earth can he afford that 2 " Or,
“That cabinet,” I ponder, “would cer-
tainly be two hundred pounds to-day.”
And the same carking jealousy and
curiosity ruins the dinner, however good
it may be. “If only I could have got
a table like this 1" “Those chairs must
have cost a fortune.”
Very special qualifications go to a
furnishing Frock-coat. He must com-
bine deference with persuasiveness,
eloquence with the machinery of can-
dour, and he must disguise any dejection
he feels. Some Frock-coats merely indi-
cate the way to other Frock-coats, or
call a Frock-coat to come and be useful,
themselves remaining near the door;
some take you in charge themselves and
are equally powerful in all departments.
It is amusing, on entering an establish-
ment, to speculate as to which kind of
Frock-coat it is going to be. That
is, however, the end of one's amuse-
ment.
My own greatest difficulty was over
a desk—something a little exceptional;
not with three drawers each side and a
covering of dark green leather; not a
bureau, not an escritoire, but an inter-
esting desk, a desk with secret drawers;
and it was in the pursuit of this elusive
article that I made my closest studies
of the Frock-coats, because I explored, I
am certain, thirty establishments and
went for prodigious walks with them
in each. One indeed boasted of eight
acres of furniture floors, and I can

believe it. But in no rod, pole or perch
of them was there the kind of desk I
wanted; every other, but not mine.
They ranged between desks to write
love-letters at and desks to give em-
ployees a month's notice from; but º
none could any real literary work be
attempted.
The Frock-coats listened just like
angels, profoundly interested and under-
standing, a little leaning my way. They
twisted their moustaches and their
eyes lighted; and then they dashed the
hopes that they had raised. In a vast
building in the Tottenham Court Road,
for example, I put the problem to a
Frock-coat of so much more than com-
mon benevolence and, on the face of
him, intelligence, that I was at last
confident. “I know exactly what you
want,” he said. “Not an office desk, but
a desk you could have in a sitting-room.”
“Yes,” I said.
“With plenty of drawers,” he con-
tinued, “and possibly a cupboard.”
“That is it precisely,” I said.
“Not conventional,” he pursued.
I agreed.
“Mahogany,” he said.
I agreed again.
“And old,” he went on.
“Absolutely,” I said, in a state of
fever. -
“Well,” he replied, “I haven't
one.”
But I think I preferred his methods
to those of the Frock-coats who also
knew exactly what I wanted, but who
had sold the last only yesterday; and
quite a number of them said that. It
is astonishing what sales can occur in
furniture shops yesterday. That, I have
discovered, is the real day for trade:
ANOTHER BREAKFAST-TABLE TRAGEDY.
“HAVE some anchovy paste on your
toast and marge,” said Lois hospitably.
“There's no marmalade, no jam, no
honey, no syrup, no nothing. Anchovy
paste is an institution in this house,
as it drowns the taste of marge more
effectively than anything else I know.
I always put it on thick.”
She demonstrated. It was certainly
thick; no margarine however aggres-
sive could have hoped to hold its own
against it.
“I’m not one of those people who
pretend they don't mind marge,” went
on Lois. “Affectation, I call it. I think
I've missed the butter more than any-
thing, and when we get as much as
we want again

them rather well, so that conversation
on such a vital matter as food is always
frank and open.
“What we do now,” Lois told me,
when they had mentioned conclusively
that visitors expecting butter in that
house would jolly well bring their own,
“is to save it all until the week-end
and then have a real blow-out. It's
something to look forward to all the
week. To-day's only Wednesday, isn't
it?” She sighed deeply.
“What a mercy it is,” said my host
genially, “that you are going on Friday.
Wouldn't it be awful to have to sit and
watch us eat all our butters?”
“Awful!” agreed Lois.
It was just at that point that Cecilia,
the handmaid, burst in without the
semblance of a preliminary tap. Her
frightened glance swept the breakfast-
table and fastened dazedly on the mar-
garine dish, now all but emptied of its
contents.
“Oh, Ma'am!'” she gasped.
“What on earth's the matter, Ce-
cilia?” asked Lois rather stiffly.
“Oh, lor! Now I bin an' gorn an'
done it ! That there was the butter!"
No one spoke. It was not a moment
for speech. With a low slow sob Lois
turned her head aside so that she
should not see her plate, where stood
the last square inch of her second slice
of toast, the butter of it plastered beyond
recognition with anchovy paste.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW HE DID HIS BIT.
This is to be an account of Dixenham's patriotic activity
during the War. We all liked him on account of his inno-
cence and his ardent desire to do something which should
enable him to give an answer to the question, “Daddy,
what did you do in the Great War?” It was extremely
unlikely that that question would ever be put to him save
in the way of jest, for he was fifty-two years old, and his
family consisted of one married daughter who was at
present living with her father and knew all his doings
intimately. Still, as Dixenham said, you never could tell.
Besides, a man's conscience might render his life un-
bearable.
Acting on these principles, Dixenham joined the Volun-
teers during the first ardour of that admirable movement;
but his lameness was a terrible handicap to him, and
when he realised that he was only impeding the rest
he felt it his duty to retire and seek some fresh field in
which to develop his energies. When the local Tribunals
were instituted Dixenham was at first very angry. It
seemed to him to argue a strange lack of patriotism that
men who were called up to join the colours should seek
safety by appealing to these bodies. But when Molesworth,
his own gardener, got a notice and was passed A1, fit for
general service, and was given a bare month to set his
affairs in order, why, then matters assumed rather a
different aspect. It was hard, he argued, that Moles.
worth, his only gardener, should be taken while two neigh-
bouring gardeners were spared, and he paid no attention
to the fact that both of them were seriously ruptured.
Ruptures did not alter principles.
In complaints like these his vexation spent itself, without
appearing to make any impression on the stony hearts of
the gentlemen of the Tribunal.
Not long afterwards I happened to be taking a walk
past Dixenham's garden, and there I beheld the man
himself in his shirt-sleeves digging for all he was worth,
and bearing all the outward signs which indicate a gardener.
As I passed he hailed me.
“Surprised, aren't you, to see me at work? Well, it's
quite true that hitherto I haven't been much of a gardener
myself. We left it all to Molesworth. Now he's joined
up, and I had to consider what ought to be done. I put an
advertisement in the local paper, but didn't get an answer.
Then suddenly it occurred to me that if I did it myself I
should kill two birds with one stone. First, I should get
the garden carried on, and, secondly, I should be doing
war-work, for I should be working in substitution for a
man who had been compelled to join the army.”
“War-work?” I said. “What you're doing isn't war-
work.” And I endeavoured to explain to him what war-
work really meant, and that, at any rate, it could not and
did not mean such work as he was then doing for himself
alone.
Dixenham is an obstinate man, and it took a long
time to persuade him. Even to the last I am sure he felt a
self-righteous glow when he took off his coat and waist-
coat and complained of the weather. -
Shortly before the Armistice was signed he had arranged
to carry on with his bodily presence and activity the little
business of a sweet shop. -
“It's a one-man business,” he said, “if ever there was
one, for its proprietor is a woman and quite incompetent
at that.”
Nothing more muddle-headed ever come out of Hanwell,
but the intention was good and patriotic, and when the
final reckoning is made it may be that the intention counts
for more than anything else.
THE RETURN.
INTo the home-side wood, the long straight aisle of pines,
I turned with a slower step than ever my youth-time knew;
Dusk was gold in the valley, grey in the deep-cut chines,
A. below, like a dream afloat, was the quiet sea's fading
Ule.
Oh, it was joy to see the still night folding down
Over the simple fields I loved, saved by the sacred dead,
Playmates and friends of mine, brothers in camp and town,
The loyal hearts that leapt at the word that England said.
I paused by the cross-roads' sign, for a tinkling sound rang
clear, *
The small,sharp sound of a bell away up the western road;
And presently out of the mist, with clank and clatter of gear,
Rumbled the carrier's cart with its tilt and its motley
load:—
The old grey horse that moved in the misty headlight's gleam,
The carrier crouched on his seat, with the bell-boy perched
astride, - - -
Voices from under the tilt, and laughter—was it a dream,
Or was I awake and alive, standing there by the cross-
roads' side 2 - . . . .
So I came to the village street where glinting lights shone
fair, -
The little homely lights that make the glad tears start;
And I knew that one was yearning and waiting to welcome
me there, -
She that is mother in blood and steadfast comrade in
heart. - - - - - -
Oh, but my youth swept back like the tide to a thirsty shore,
Or the little wind at dawn that heralds the wash of rain;

LABOR OMNIA VINCIT.
(From “The Times” of December 18th, 1920.)
THE deadlock in the radium industry, involving three
hundred thousand operatives, has, we are glad to an-
nounce, been satisfactorily terminated by the intervention
of the PRIME MINISTER, when all efforts of the Conciliation
Boards and Industrial Councils had failed.
The men demanded a reduction of the hours of labour
from three to two hours daily and a hundred per cent.
increase in their wages on the special rate guaranteed last
June. As this meant the abandonment of the Three Hours
Act and would render the profitable working of the radium
mines impossible, the task of settlement might well have
discouraged the most adroit industrial diplomatist. Not
so the PRIME MINISTER, who has staved off the impending
strike by the following masterly compromise:—Henceforth,
beginning on January 1st, 1921, the hours of labour are
to be reduced to two-and-a-quarter hours daily, while the
wages are to be raised ninety-eight per cent, on the special
rate. The men, though not enthusiastic over the decision,
profess their readiness to give the scheme a trial for three
months, without prejudice to further demands on the basis
of the one-hour day and a minimum wage of £10 weekly.

fairly cheerful, but spoke little. On arriving at Maasbergen she com-
plained of the bitter sold.”—Daily Sketch.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FEw books dealing with the reflective aspect of the world
tragedy have seemed to me more quietly satisfactory than
the slender volume, At Home in the War (HEINEMANN),
in which Mr. G. S. STREET has recorded the thoughts and
emotions, during the past four years, of one whom circum-
stance has forced into the position of looker-on. It is
long since I first met Mr. Street as gentle essayist; he
has never appeared to better advantage than in these
eminently sane and common-sensible musings. At times
frankly personal, you have here the intimate, yet con-
sidered talk of a middle-aged observer of life, who from a
position a little withdrawn has been watching the changes
that have come over everything that makes up our world.
His chapters measure this development (so plainly marked
in retrospect), from “The First Emotions” and “The
Great Response,” down through all the varied reactions
of the war-years to the call-up of the fathers. Quotation
would be the only right tribute, and for that I have no space.
One closes this most companionable little book, regretting
that it appeared too soon (almost by a matter of days) to
round off its strange and eventful history by a record of
The Amazing End.
The paper wrapper of Children of the dear Cotswolds
(MURRAY), by L. ALLEN HARKER, nearly put me off my
stroke on the tee—and you know what a mood that
engenders. The picture of a child, for whom drowning in
its bath would have been too lenient a penalty for being
such an object, should be removed by any bookseller who
does not want dead stock on his hands. Inside there is
plenty of good stuff—a little over-sentimental perhaps, but
with more than a suspicion of the happy Cranford flavour.
Here are little loosely connected sketches of a Cotswold
village—the kind of book for which there is plenty of room
and which interprets the spirit of one little corner of our
England to another. I couldn't help comparing this work
with a late study by Miss SHEILA KAYE-SMITH of a Sussex
village. Of course Cotswolds, however dear, can hold no
candle to Sussex; but the two chroniclers have different
methods. Miss KAYE-SMITH is a realist; she gives you the
“warts and all.” No retouching of the negative for her. I
get an impression from Miss HARKER that the Cotswolds
are a little too good to be true. And can it be that the in-
dulgent author really liked the little idiot on the wrapper?
In The Dardanelles Campaign (NISBET) Mr. H. W. NEv-
INSoN does not pretend to tell us much that is new about the
glorious and tragic struggle, but rather from a distance of
time sufficient for perspective, yet with the freshness of an
eye-witness, he aims to picture it clearly and as a coherent
whole. Certainly he succeeds more than well, even if we
hesitate to accept his publishers' claim to what they call
“the substantive account,” whatever that may mean. It
seems as if the fighting in the Gallipoli peninsula is to be
more written over than any other equal section of the War,
mainly, one supposes, because it so catches the imagination,
the margin between failure and success having again and
again been so detestably small. It is a virtue in Mr.
NEVINson's history that this dramatic quality in his subject,
though he never loses sight of it, is not so overstrained as to
destroy the balance of a straightforward piece of writing.
He is an out-and-out supporter of the campaign, yet even
here advocacy does not run away with him, and the
journalist's tendency to sit in judgment is not too evident.
Altogether this is a desirable addition to the Dardanelles

shelf. Mr. NEVINsoN's maps, one might add, are much
better than his illustrations.
“SAPPER" in The Human Touch (HopDER AND STough-
TON) disobeys—as usual—every law ever laid down on
“How to write a Short Story,” and—as usual—triumphs
completely over the pundits and pedagogues. Here he
pursues his digressive way as generously as ever; at one
moment he is as serious as judges used to be, and before you
have had time to fall into line with his mood he breaks out
into the most delightful drolleries. But whatever his mood
may be he retains a very true sense of vision. The present
hour has for him its splendid and its sordid aspects; but,
grand or grimy, its significance lies for him in its power to
make or mar the future of our race. Study “The Educa-
tion of Bunny Smith" and you will see what I mean; or
read of the devotion of John Mayhew, sometime lecturer on
Higher Mathematics at Oxford, to Shorty Bill, who thought
that Oxford professors cleaned their black-boards by the
simple, if insanitary, method of spitting upon them. Perhaps
Rduty. This is not to say that BARTIMEUs is a plagiarist—
far from it. He has to describe such characters and such
events as Mr. KIPLING has taught us to associate with his
name, and naturally enough BARTIMEUs catches something
of his infectious manner. There they are, then, all the
good old “gadgets”—the oracular tone, the short sentence
flaming with portent and loaded with meaning beyº... the
capacity of any ordinary uncurtailed sentence, the cool
unruffled determination with which great deeds are per-
formed. If one may say it of a writer who is so saturated
with sea-water, BARTIMEUs is a daisy for short stories of
sailor-men and their ways of speech and action. All these
are well to the fore in The Navy Eternal (HopDER AND
SToUGHToN). I like particularly the story of the commander
of a submarine (English) who had been aimed at by a
seaplane (German) and all but hit. “Maria,” said he out
of the perspective of machinery and motionless figures
awaiting death, “Maria, give the gentleman a bag of nuts.”
Miss JESSIE Douglas KERRUISH has more than a passing
here and there one can IT
detect a slight note of bit-
terness sounding in these
stories, and I hope that
“SAPPER'' will be careful
not to indulge it. For his
work as it stands to-day is
both a stimulus to thought
and an incentive to loyalty.
I have the feeling that
there must surely be some
secret behind The Choices
of an Etonian (LANE) which
would explain how it came
to be published. If, for ex-
ample, Mr. HoRACE BUCK-
LEY, the author, is still a
schoolboy, or at most a
very young man, one would
suffer his crudities for the
sake of better work to
come. Otherwise I see no
excuse. As a story the

Maurice Hale had to leave Eton because of the financial
disasters of his parent; but, the family fortunes being
restored, he (surely not very probably) resumed his posi-
tion there, and the book accordingly became a school
story till the outbreak of war allowed us some trench
chapters for a finish. These were so conspicuously the
most vital part of the tale as to suggest a picture of
Mr. BUCKLEY himself enduring their horrors. In which
case all shall be forgiven. Otherwise I should have winged
words to speak about a style that suggests either that the
last proof-reader had been called up, or that the once
fastidious Bodley Head had unaccountably nodded. When
we read (of the departure of visitors after a school function),
“The arrival of taxis brings the family touch to its curtain
stage"—well, as the poet says, “there must surely be some-
thing somewhere” to account for it.
I suspect that BARTIMEUs, that prolific and forcible writer,
must be rather tired of being compared with Mr. KIPLING ;
but it has to be done, and no reviewer who omitted to draw
attention to the likeness would feel that he had fulfilled his

as to suggest that she has

plots of the book's three

printed pages; further, I
confess to a somewhat
vague and incoherent un-
lderstanding at times as to

by the Eastern characters. In its broad outlines the book
follows the loves of three several couples; the delays
they underwent by reason of local “incidents” between
the East and the West, and the climax achieved during a
thorough-going riot in the city of Teheran, wherein there
was much quiet humour and all the protagonists came
perilously near being eliminated in a bunch. Its broad
outlines, however, are not the book's main recommendation;
it is to be read for its thousand-and-one incidents. Unless,
then, you are so impatient a reader as to be put off by
having to discover for yourself who, for example, the Shah-
zadeh Khanoum may be, or unless you are the sort of person
who will be annoyed to find that it was only Miss Janet all
the time, and you were expected to know it but didn't, my
advice is to give the book a thorough reading.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ROAD TO THE RHINE.
II.-‘‘PEACEFUL PENETRATION."
PEACEFUL penetration, briefly, is the
art of acquiring practically the sole use
of an entire house and its effects in such
a manner that the householder (who
would normally resent the intrusion) is
constrained in the end to acknowledge
a debt of gratitude for the invasion.
To be successful in this art of obtain-
ing the best billets in the most unlikely
places it is essential that at least one
of the company should possess the
following qualities:–
1. A genuine horror of discomfort.
2. A more comprehensive knowledge
of the French language than is required
to turn out such sentences as “La
plume de ma mère est très bonne.”
3. A gentle, cooing, cradle-rocking
voice.
C Company is fortunate enough to
possess a prince of peaceful penetrators
in the person of one Second-Lieut. Char-
denal (such is not his name, but he is our
first French scholar). Thus, though we
continue our march daily to the land
of the “Alleyman"—with the post,
the newspaper and the all-important
rations keeping a respectful distance
behind us—every night sees us comfort-
ably housed in a home from home.
We arrive, for instance, in a village.
The inhabitants waggle flags. The best
billets being occupied already by people
who in wartime were usually behind us
we plod victoriously on to that quarter
of the place where the Bosch “requi-
sition ” has been most rigorous. Of
course the first thing we do is to “look
after the men "-not because we like
it or because we have read Letters of
a General to his Son, but because we
know from bitter experience what kind
of things they are capable of if we leave
them to look after themselves. Not
until we have seen issued that peculiar
molten beverage called “Army Tea" do
our thoughts turn to our own material
comfort. Then in silence we survey the
swept and ungarnished floor set apart
in the Company billet for our use. It
is a good floor as floors go, but we have
in mind other floors, preferably those
with beds growing on them.
“Very well," you say, “nothing
easier than to go and ask for accom-
modation from the inhabitants near
by.” My dear good Sir (or Madam),
have you seen us and ours? Our Com-
pany Mess is represented by five offi-
cers, five valises (considerably over
weight), five batmen and a cook (with
military impedimenta), as well as Mess-
boxes containing crockery, etc.
The mere suggestion that this seeth-
ing mass of men and material might be
included in any one house would call
up visions in the mind of the stoutest
householder of a home destroyed by a
brutal soldiery and would indubitably
lead them to lock up the silver and
send for the Maire.
It is on this account that we have
elaborated the following system of
peaceful penetration. Selecting the
most likely house capable of accommo-
dating us all, Second-Lieut. Chardenal
takes the lead. The Company Com-
mander, punctured of all authority,
fades into insignificance when it comes
to importuning inhabitants in their
native tongue. The remainder scatter
about the road in artillery formation,
with the idea of making a crowd look
like a couple of disinterested loafers.
Approaching the door Chardenal gently
insinuates a massive and conciliatory
form. “Has Madame a room to spare
where the English officers could sit
down 2 Madame has 2 Madame is too
kind.” We wait expectantly. “Pos-
sibly she might allow us the use of the
room as a Mess; we have nowhere
else to go. It is kind of Madame; a
home from home would be most wel-
come.”
We are im.
Monsieur le Capitaine is introduced
to Madame, and remarks with a tre-
mendous effort that “la guerre est finie;
c'est bon, n'est-ce pas ?” after which he
very wisely relapses into silence. The
campaign recommences. “If it is no
inconvenience perhaps Madame would
graciously allow our cook to have the
use of the stove in the kitchen. There
is but one 2 Ah, we could not think
of deranging Madame; after all there
are many worse things than cold food
in a warm room. What ' It will be
quite all right 2 That is most kind of
Madame. Madame would like to use
the stove as well? Naturally; we give
Madame full permission to use her own
stove.”
The ground floor is ours.
Next the cook staggers into the kit-
chen with his Mess-boxes and exchanges
pleasantries with the youngsters. Mon-
sieur is given an English cigarette. But
gracious ! who are all these people in
Madame's kitchen 2 “Oh, they are
just a servant or two to help the
cook.” They greet Madame as their
own mother and the air is full of
“Bong jore,” “Mercy,” “Bong poor
les troops,” “Alleyman parti " and
“Les sales Alleymans.”
The story of the Bosch's misdoings
in the village fills us with horror; we
tell Madame we are (almost) sorry the
War is over. Monsieur shows us how
and where they succeeded in “cach-
ing " everything from the rigours of
the “requisition " until the Company
Commander begins to fidget. It is
getting dark. Ah! Madame has asked
where we shall sleep.
“We sleep? We hadn't thought
of it. Doubtless there is a stone floor
somewhere.”
The floor? No, no, Madame has a
bedroom for Monsieur le Capitaine.
“Madame is really too good.”
Here the Company Commander be-
gins to wax authoritative again and
gives short sharp orders to his batman
concerning his valise. “What—there
are also two other rooms with two
beds 2 Oh, no, no, no ' " Cries and
protests from overwhelmed subalterns;
they could not think of it; it would
derange Madame. Er, could they see
them 2 . . . . . . . . .
We entertain Monsieur in the kitchen
with unlimited ration tobacco, while
the servants rush our valises up and
take possession formally.
The whole house is now ours. The
campaign has proceeded according to
plan.
+ + :: :: :
It is eight o'clock. Dinner is served
in our very own Mess, and Madame
graciously apologises for entering her
own room occasionally. The C.O. has
been round and remarked, “Ah, C Com-
pany bas got the best billets as usual”
—for which the Company Commander
modestly takes full credit. Madame
has prepared our salad herself, for
which, having seen the hands of the
company cook, we are duly grateful.
From the kitchen comes the hum of
many voices, amongst which can be
heard the constant trill of Madame
relating her troubles, the interjection
from the men of a sympathetic “Ah
wee, Ah wee” at more or less appro-
priate intervals, the occasional boister-
ous outbreak of “No bon, ch 2"
“Alleyman no bon,” and the pre-
liminary strains of a mouth-organ.
Looking in at about 9 P.M. we see
that all the servants (plus an orderly
or two) have got into the kitchen and
are seated roisterously round the table
in their shirt-sleeves. Monsieur and
Madame have the unrestricted use of
one corner of their own kitchen and
are smiling and happy, with a taste of
something like solid food after four
years' abstinence. She has found them
quarters for the night in a nice dry
loſt, and knows they will leave it
cleaner and tidier than they found it,
and everybody is satisfied.
I hate to say it, but if the Bosch had
specialised in our form of peaceful
penetration goodness knows what
might have happened. Certainly, wit-
nessing the full-fed, fatuous, self-com-
placent spectacle which the Mess pre-
sents, one would say he'd have had a
better time of it. - II.

THE PLAINT OF A TOPICAL
BARD.
Why do my vagrant fancies turn
To Christmas as a likely theme 2
It is not that I really yearn
To dream again the DICKENs dream,
To celebrate the flowing glasses,
Or sing a song like WENCESLAs's.
No, it is rather that I sigh
For something fairly firm and fixed
Amid a world that's gone awry
And got inextricably mixed;
Where'er one looks, from Pole to Tropic,
Everything seems kaleidoscopic.
One king after another goes
And half the map has fallen away,
And of To-morrow all one knows
Is that it won't be as To-day;
As for the coming week (the middle)
Ask me, I pray, another riddle.
One week the War is on—and off
The next ; our darkness turns to
light,
And editors make bold to scoff
At what I wrote but yesternight;
Hackneyed and out of date they vote
it,
Which seemed prophetic when I wrote
it.
| For Dora we don't care a fig
(Whose name was once a thing of
dread);
I heap nutrition on the pig
Till yesterday so underfed;
And we ourselves eat cake and jam in
What was last week a haunt of famine.
Close in the wake of capering Time
I pant and still I pant in vain;
I cannot catch him in a rhyme
Nor snapshot in a passing strain;
He speeds on his subversive mission
More like a bus than a tradition.
So, Christmas, let me fix my mind
Upon your blessed certitude;
You will not vanish like the wind,
Nor cheat nor crumble nor elude:
You in a world that smacks of Babel
May still be counted firm and stable.

A MATTER OF COURSES.
I AM one of those poor old bachelors
who for lack of a home live in a select
boarding-house. To this forlorn habit,
however, I owe a knowledge, uncom-
mon, I flatter myself, amongst civilians,
of certain departments of military life.
During the past two years the greater
part of the accommodation of my cara-
vanserai has been occupied by a suc-
cession of artillery officers, who reside
there while undergoing a course of in-
struction at the neighbouring School
of Gunnery. As they usually write up
and discuss their notes and propound
their theories in the little smoke-room,
I have gradually acquired a certain be:
wildered familiarity with the techni-
calities of their science, and have come
to realise how terrifying an engine is
a modern piece of ordnance for the
spirited young gentlemen who have to
endure examination upon its manage-
ment and habits. .
Recently, recognizing one of the
students as having been quartered in
my boarding-house only a few months
before, I introduced myself by the offer
of a saccharin tabloid for his coffee,
and ventured to inquire how he came
to be repeating the experience.

no official title, I may describe myself
as a course specialist. In civil life I
earned a substantial livelihood as de-
signer and architect of iced cakes, and,
in view of the present shortage of sugar,
am not entitled to claim immediate de-
mobilization as a pivot man. For the
executive work of the Reserve Brigade
to which I am attached there are three
times too many officers, and to avoid
the crowd in the Mess I have abandoned
myself to every variety of extensive and
intensive military education. I have
attended most of the ordinary courses
once, and those associated with par-
ticularly comfortable billets I patronise
more frequently. Thus, as you may
imagine, I know practically everything
that can be taught on the subject of
war in all its branches. The store of

be invaluable to me when I have to re-

co-operation between field-officers and
R.T.O.'s, between pay-sergeants and

CoME once again, ye puddings all of plum,
And ye puffed pies ystuffed of mincéd meat
That lie like driven swansdown on the tum
And bid dyspepsia's self arise and eat;
And all ye almonds white and apples red
Where of the “U” not bites—or doth no longer,
But now, the plaything of the grisly conger,
Befouls old Ocean's shell-encrusted bed,
Or, pent in ports of our inviolate coast,
Mocks the white-livered Brandenburger's boast,
While they who drank the sounding hero-toast
Come all a-crawl, crying, “Please don't oppress
A nice kind German.” Faugh ' But I digress.
Come, ye proud turkeys of the Sister Isle,
Miscalled, indeed, by that unsavoury name,
That gobble in the barnyard full of bile
And strut the meads with wattles all aflame.
And O ye geese! As succulent still, I ween,
As when ye saved Rome's Capitol from danger,
Whose outstretched necks do hiss the intrusive
stranger -
In swift disorder from the village green—
Come to our board, with sage and onions
crowned,
Or thymy-odorous and festooned around
With the plump sausage exquisitely browned;
Come, and till sheer repletion bids us cease
We'll liſt our forks to Victory and Peace.
For we have longed for ye, brave foods, and all
(Save James, an infant, recently arrived)
Have faced long years of strife's abstemious thrall,
Of all rich forms of sustenance deprived,
Nor sought by stealth to augment the rationed
dole,
But eked out portions suitable for sparrows,
With home-grown greens and vegetable marrows,
Nor on the uncouponed pheasant and the sole
Waxed profiteerwise. Thus we did our bit,
Eight patriot Joneses, lean but not unfit;
And now as round the groaning board we sit
Without one prick of conscience to corrode
We'll eat and eat and let the expense be blowed.
The basted Bird wilſ enter in his pride;
The gong will sound and trooping we shall come;
And James, who simply won't be left outside,
Shall suck real gravy from his mother's thumb;
And I shall watch the young platoon advance
Against fresh helpings, every one a graveller,
Till, like ripe leeches from the exhausted traveller,
They fall away, too full for utterance;
And off to bed I pack them all for luck—
Jack, George and Michael, Joan and Master
Puck,
Who started last but quickly left the ruck,
Passing the post, so Nurse and Jane declare,
Still well in hand, with two mince-pies to spare.
Then by the fireside with my café noir
And fat Partagas in a sandal box,
I'll quaff one green Chartreuse to La Victoire,
Adding, “Not mine, but that of Messrs. Cox,
To find the wherewithal to pay the bills;”
And presently, in balmy sleep enfolded,
I'll dream of turkeys to huge stature moulded,
Gargantuan geese and puddings huge as hills,
While from the dim isles of old wonder tales,
Full of rare fruits and aromatic bales,
Come high-prowed galleons, furling silver sails,
To anchor by the river bank of sleep
Where I, like JAMSHID, glory and drink deep.

THE SENTIMENTALISTS.
WE prisoners had been the victims of many false starts
and falser rumours, but at last it seemed that the workmen
and soldiers who happened to be ruling the town that week
were proposing to let us go. I was not leaving with the
first party, and walked a little sadly round the big barrack
taking leave of my friends.
The human is a sentimental animal. I heard men
undertake to meet once a year in Loßdon and dine off cold
bully beef and mangel soup, just to remind them of the
bad old days. Some arranged to foregather in January
and travel through Scotland in cattle trucks.
As I passed Room 76 the faint sound of applause came
to me, and, attracted by the unusual noise, I entered. They
had always interested me, those three men in 76, and as
they were leaving early in the morning I did not hesitate
to intrude on what I guessed to be a farewell meal.
“Come in—sit down," said Crust. He was standing
and appeared to be delivering the final speech of the even-
ing. I hid myself in a shadowy corner and waited for him
to continue.
“And so for eighteen weary months we have faced each
other across this narrow table. There was no escape, there
was no relief. The same faces, the same habits, the same
mannerisms, changeless as the Pyramids, warping character,
killing individuality. Can you wonder that our feelings for
each other changed from indifference to dislike and from
dislike to detestation and odium ?”
“Hear, hear!” chorused the other two and tapped upon
the table. “Very true; hear, hear!”
“Therefore I do not hesitate to hope not only that we
may forget one another utterly but that Don't go.”
“I can't stand it,” I said and hurried out.
They left next morning.

Three days ago I walked into a small restaurant which
has not yet been discovered by the spending classes. In a
corner, seated round a beautifully decorated table, were the
three men whom I had last seen drinking weak tea in
West Prussia. I produced the single eye-glass which I
generally use solely for the exploration of menu cards, and
studied the trio. -
Crust was again speaking, seated this time, and, though
I could not hear him, the smiles and the rapidly emptying
magnum told their tale. They noticed me on their way out
and, turning aside, came over to my table.
“Why, it's the old eavesdropper in his party suit !”
“It is high time you three young men dispersed to your
several and provincial homes,” I remarked sternly. “Lon-
don's much too full.”
“Been trying to tear ourselves apart for nearly a week,”
said Crust, “but it's no good. Of course we really loathe
one another as much as ever, but we've been glued together
so long that we can't come unstuck.”
“A hundred and twenty-two ‘U'-boats had been surrendered up
to Sunday last, and it is thought that forty more, some of which
are dam aged, will complete the total.”—Spectator.
We knew some of the boats were fairly ancient, but are
surprised that our respected contemporary should give way
to language like this.

THE BATH-PLUG.
THE plug for the bath on the first
floor of the Mess does not fit. It has
never fitted since the barracks were
built. There is a tradition to the effect
that some other barracks were being
built at the same time, and that our
bath-plug was delivered to them in
error, or else that the wrong barracks
for this bath-plug were erected here.
Nobody likes to probe too deeply into
the affair or suggest public enquiry.
These things are not done in the Army;
there's no knowing in what life-long
correspondence you may become in-
volved, and it would be a piteous fate
to be denied release to your civilian
employment because the last word re-
mained to be said between yourself and
some implacable department.
So the plug still fails to function
sufficiently well to prevent a rapid
leakage from the bath. Contemplating
ablutions you are faced with an altern-
ative. Either you may use the plug as
it is and scramble through the process
of cleansing against time, the comfort-
ing soapy tide ebbing as you wash,
until it leaves you chill and miserable,
stranded on the hard enamel like a ship
dry-docked ; or else you must spend
a long time hanging over the edge of
the bath, head-downwards, trying to
make the plug watertight with the
| help of a scrap of flannel. This flannel
was presumably supplied by the con-
science-stricken contractor immediately
responsible for the mix-up of bath-
plugs and barracks; but we cannot dis-
cover who has authority to replace or
repair it, though it has long since
grown so attenuated that only with
the greatest patience, technical skill
and manual dexterity can it be made
effective. -
A Scottish lawyer who is amongst
us disguised as a Captain holds the
view that this flannel, being associated
with and supplementary to the plug
(itself theoretically a fixture, though the
attachment-chain has been broken so
long that the memory of man holds no
record of any other condition), must
not be regarded as a movable or in any
way tampered with, and that any intro-
missions (Scottish legal term) therewith
will be at the risk of the intromitter.
According to an Ordnance Corps wallah,
who also shares our perplexities and
the use of the bath, nothing is required
but a packing-gland, but he cannot find
any authority on which to indent for a
supply for plumbing purposes. One of
the subalterns remembers having heard,
in the course of some technical lecture
which he was compelled to attend,
of a likely . sounding article called a
“Plug-Adjusting Run-Out; ” but the
Adjutant believes this is one of the
fittings of a gun and has nothing to
do with any branch of domestic en-
gineering.
Certain impetuous and perhaps ill-
balanced minds amongst us have, how-
ever, at last decided to move in the
matter, and at present hesitate between
two courses. The R.A. Comforts Fund
might be induced to supply a larger
and efficient plug, which could be used
in practice, while the old plug and
flannel would be shown on inspection.
Or a subscription list might be opened
amongst ourselves and a suitable plug
purchased by private arrangement. The
plug would then be entrusted to the
custody of an officer detailed for that
responsibility, who would be authorised
to issue it to any duly-identified sub-
scriber desirous of taking a bath.
The younger bloods are in high
spirits, confident that before long steps
will really be taken to render the bath
watertight; but the few old Regulars
in the Mess look coldly on the agitation
and sigh amongst themselves at this
upstart irreverence for time-honoured
tradition.

mature of the conversation that passed be-
tween Mr. Wilson and M. Clemenceau, but it

THE ISLAND.

Suddenly I shall wake
And very softly hasten down
And out beyond the sleeping town
To find my fairy lake.
I shall not need to seek a boat,
It will be moored, I think,

Where meadow-sweet and mallow sway
Close to the water's brink.
The moon from shadowy shore to shore
Will make a shining trail,
And I shall sing their fairy song
As joyfully I float along—

And, peering through a starlit haze,

Where swift the waiting reeds unclose,
The fairies all in rows and rows
Waiting to welcome me. R. F.

LATER THOUGHTS.
It is my destiny to buy in the dearest
markets and to sell—if I succeed in
selling at all—in the cheapest. Usually,
indeed, having tired of a picture or deco-
rative article, I have positively to give
it away; almost to make its acceptance
a personal favour to me. But the
other day was marked by an exception
to this rule so striking that I have been
wondering if perhaps the luck has not
changed and I am, after all, destined to
be that most desirable thing, a suc-
cessful dealer.
It happened thus. In drifting about
the old curiosity shops of a cathedral
city I came upon a portfolio of water-
At about 3.30 A.M. I woke widely up
and, according to custom, began to
review my life's errors, which are in
no danger of ever complaining of lone-
liness. From these I reached, by way
of mitigation, my recent successful
piece of chaffering, and put the letter
to the dealer under both examination
and cross-examination. Why (so my
thoughts ran) give him half 2 Why

Quixotry. It was my eye that de-
tected the probability of the drawing,

“How much is this?” I
asked scornfully.
“Well,” said the dealer,
“if it were a genuine TUR-
NER it would be worth any-
thing. But let's say ten
shillings. You can have
it for that ; but I don't
mind if you don't, because

her to disregard me—only a day or so
after we had at last got on terms?
There is no fury like a woman scorned;
it would probably be the end of me.
City magnates are successful probably
just because they don't do these foolish
impulsive things. Impulse is the nega-
tion of magnatery. If I am to make
any kind of figure in this new rôle of
fine art speculator (so my thoughts
continued) I must control my feelings.
No, five pounds is absurd. A douceur
of one pound will meet the case. It
will be nothing to me—or, at any rate,
nothing serious—yet a real gift of quail
and manna from a clear sky to the
dealer, without, however, doing him
any harm. . A pound will be ample,
accompanied by a brief note.
- The note was to the
effect that I had sold the
| drawing at a profit which
enabled me to make him a
present, because it was an
old belief of mine that
one should do this kind of
thing; good luck should be
shared.

my pocket containing the
\\ note and the cheque when

a purchaser for the drawing at fifty
pounds there is no need to tell, for
the point of this narrative resides not
in bargaining with collectors, but in
bargaining with my own soul. The
astonishing fact remains that I achieved
a profit of forty-nine pounds ten and
was duly elated. I then began to think.
The dealer (so my thoughts ran) in
that little street by the cathedral west
door, he ought to participate in this.
He behaved very well to me and I
ought to behave well to him. It would
be only fair to give him half.
Thereupon I sat down and wrote a
little note saying that the potential

recollected, had turned out to be au-

enclosing him half of the proceeds, as

again began to think about the dealer.
Why (so my thoughts ran) send him
ten pounds? It will only give him a
wrong idea of his customers, none other
of whom would be so fair, so sporting,
as I. He will expect similar letters
every day and be disappointed, and then
he will become embittered and go down
the vale of tears a miserable creature.
He looked a nice old man too; a pity,
may a crime, to injure such a nature.
No, ten pounds is absurd. Five would
be plenty. Ten would put him above
himself.
While I was dressing the next morn-
ing I thought about the dealer again.
Why should I (so my thoughts ran),

life brought off a financial coup, spoil it
by giving a large part of the profit
away? Was not that flying in the

THE EXPANDING DRAMA.
IT is announced that a feature of the
Christmas programme at the Lyric
Theatre, Hammersmith, will be an
invitation to the audience to participate
in the traffic of the stage. We under-
stand that this innovation is already
spreading to other entertainments.
For the final Act of the new farce,
Seven Doors, it is proposed to select two
or three elderly gentlemen from the
stall patrons, who will be subjected to
the personal blandishments of all the
heroines simultaneously. As those only
will be chosen who are accompanied by
their wives it is hoped that the situation
may then be left to work itself out in a
natural and convincing manner.
We gather that a delightful novelty
of this year's Covent Lane pantomime
will be the migration of the harle-
quinade to the auditorium. The corri-
dors are to be equipped with buttered-
slides; sausages (coupon-free) will be
strung at tripping-height across all
exits and entrances, and the ingenuities
of the clown and his parent will through-
out be exercised upon actual members
of the audience, who will be given full
opportunity of retaliation.
The spectators who assembled for the
first night of the new Western drama,
Dead Man's Danger, at the President
Wilson Theatre found the doors closed.
It was subsequently explained that a
projected sensation scene, in which
the villain was to have displayed his
prowess by picking off various critics
with a revolver in order to overawe the
heroine, had to be abandoned at the
last moment owing to a regrettable
failure to secure the co-operation of the
Press.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN My Reminiscences (MURRAY), FANNY, Lady BLUNT has
written a most adventurous and amiable book, to which
Admiral Sir RosslyN WEMyss has contributed an intro-
duction. She has passed the greater part of her life in the
more ferocious regions of Turkey. “There is scarcely a
senior officer of the R.N.,” so I gather from the cover of
her book, “who is not one of her “adopted nephews'—for
she was “Aunt Fanny' to all the younger officers serving
in the Mediterranean while she was at Salonika.” The
Senior Service has indeed all the luck. On the other hand,
she had to meet bandits like the one who asked a member
of her party for tobacco. It was noticed that one of his
fingers was missing, and it turned out that he ought to
have been in prison for the T -- -
murder of a Bey in Philip-
popolis. “The Bey's wife,
in order to try and save her
husband, bit the brigand's
finger so badly that it had
to be cut off.” Of such
rcncontres the book is full,
and yet Lady BLUNT is still
hale and hearty. I hope
her book may have a full
measure of success.
Sir J. M. BARRIE’s Echoes
of the War (Hodder AND
Stoughton) is pre-emin-
ently a book for fathers.
Fathers (since we buried
the last of the heavy Vic-
torians) are proverbially not
heroes to their authors.
Here are four little plays
in the serious-sentimental-
playful vein which no man
alive handles with such ex-
quisite adroitness. “The
New Word,” a little master-
piece which reads as well as
it played, and “A Well-re-
membered Voice,” which I
should judge would hardly
play at all, have both of them - - - -
a father and a son, and in both the father has the author's
and our affection. “The Old Lady Shows her Medals” is
here too. I never can forgive that rising of the curtain
on the third unnecessary scene, in which the old lady does
actually show her adopted son's medals. It assumed a lack
of intelligence and of artistic perception in the audience
which, hardly as I think of audiences, shocked me to the
boots. In the book BARRIE’s faylike pen steers you past
any awkwardness. I am not so sure of a fourth playlet, in
which a gardener marries the daughter of a wandering-
witted old colonel. But it does contain the rare admission
that German subalterns may sometimes have been decent
young men—at least before the War.

I am glad to see that Thomas Settles Down (NisbBT)
wholly confirms the happy auguries that I detected in
Mr. H. B. CREswell's previous record of the same hero.
You recall perhaps the sort of man Thomas was. Being
that sort it was hardly to be expected that his settling down
would be unaccompanied by certain domestic jars and re-
adjustments. Nor is it. The two chief jars are provided by

an obnoxious neighbour who tries to flirt with Mrs. Thomas,
and by the circumstance that Thomas himself is not above
an occasional flutter more suited to his days of bachelordom
than to those of fatherhood. ... However the neighbour gets
knocked down (whence a police-court summons and some
agreeable fooling), and Thomas, after an almost breathlessly
narrow escape, flies the lures of the temptress and all ends
well. Perhaps the author's wit is a shade more pungent
than in the earlier book; but it remains of admirable
quality throughout, and touched here and there with a
genuine beauty of thought that much increases its appeal.
Comedy is still its aim, rather than farce; even in such
episodes as that of the Vulgar Entertainer and the Party
that Failed (which will wake responsive chords in many
a hospitable heart) the fun goes never beyond a dreadful
reality. In short, Thomas Settles Down consolidates not
--- only Thomas but Mr. CREs-

THE OLD WAR AND THE NEW.
VERY benevolent was the aspect of Mr. Punch as he beamed on me over his port this Christmas Eve of
the most gracious of all years of grace. You would not have thought it possible that he could ever be severe.
Our talk was of the Hohenzollern and what was to be done with him. “You remember,” said Mr. Punch,
“what happened to the hangman in the drama that is a caricature of my career—how he suffered in his own
person the penalty which he had designed for myself? Well, as one who was down on Wilhelm's Black List to
undergo ‘condign punishment' on the day when his conquering armies marched up Bouverie Street, I naturally
have my own feelings. By ‘condign' punishment I understand something to fit the crime—in my case the
crime of having said exactly what I thought of him and his Huns. I am content to let it go at that. I am
content that Wilhelm should get the punishment that fits the crime—in his case the crime not so much of having
started an inexcusable war—most wars have been that and they were always started by somebody—but of
having ordered, or at least connived at, the breach of all the laws of humanity and chivalry that should govern
war for the mitigation of its horrors. Personally I should not recommend the death penalty at the hands of the
Allies, as that might mean his ultimate canonization. Besides, I don't want to curtail his time for reflection.”
“Why not hand him over to the tender mercies of German Kultur?” I suggested.
“I shouldn't do that either,” said the Sage. “You see, the only fault he has committed in German eyes
is that he lost the War, and I wouldn't have him punished for the wrong offence—for something indeed which
was our doing as much as his. No, I think I would just put him out of the way of doing further harm, in some
distant penitentiary like the Devil's Island, and leave him to himself to think it all over; as Caponsacchi said of
Guido in The Ring and the Book—
“Not to die so much as slide out of life,
Pushed by the general horror and common hate
Low, lower—left o' the very edge of things.”
“However, my real quarrel is with the German people—the people who wanted this War, and gloried in
it so long as things went well for them; the men who revelled in the atrocities committed by their troops; the
women who spat on our wounded prisoners; the children who waved flags for the murder of our little ones.
“Oh, I know the old argument of Germany's friends and apologists, that they were under the heel of a
régime that had dragooned them into a servile submission to authority; that they had never been allowed to have
a conscience of their own; that, anyhow, protest was impossible. But it was not impossible, as we see to-day;

to-day they have revolted against this authority and overthrown it. If they could do it to-day under the spur
of defeat, they could have done it under the spur of conscience four years ago when Belgium was being hacked
to pieces by order.”
“The defence,’
throne.” -
“You speak," replied the Sage, “as if the German army were a thing apart. The German army is the
German people. They mocked at our “mercenaries'; they boasted of being a nation in arms. No, they cannot
have it both ways. They cannot claim to be a nation in arms and at the same time to be irresponsible for the
behaviour of their troops. So the people must pay for its own war, and it must be brought home to them that
they are not º paying the costs that every loser, even a clean one, pays. When the terms of Peace are
published it must be made known through overy house in the Fatherland that they are required to pay so
many million pounds towards the cost of the War and so many more for the dirty way they fought it.
However, let us turn to happier thoughts, to thoughts of home. A great work lies before us if we are to
make our country worthy of the men who have fought and died for her. The War is over; another has yet to
be waged against poverty and sordid environment; against the disabilities of birth ; against the abuse of wealth ;
against the mutual suspicions of Capital and Labour; against sloth, indifference, self-complacency, short memories.
It will call for heavy sacrifices; it will demand the scrapping of many prejudices.
“I know of partisans to-day who think the War ill-won if it means that they have to surrender any of their
precious shibboleths. We shall have to fight hard against that temper of mind. It is easy enough to be a patriot in
war-time, when you haven't got to fight. Men are moved by a very human desire to win, by a very human fear
of defeat. Every natural selfish motive urges them to what looks like unselfishness for the sake of their own
country as against the enemy's. That is no longer the contest. A man has now to decide whether he will
serve himself or his country—a much harder test of patriotism.
“That the principles of justice and honour will triumph in the New Year as they triumphed in the Old
I do not doubt. England was never so great as at this hour; and she will be greater yet.”
He paused for a moment; then very gravely, “My friend,” he said, “to-morrow is the birth of Christ, and
there is Peace once more on earth. Let us drink to the memory of our dead, who gave us this hour.”
After a long silence he spoke again. “And now,” he said, smiling through his tears, “I have a happy
duty to perform. Let us join our lady guest."
- A little later he was bowing before the dearest of angels, whose name is Peace. “Madam,” he was
saying, “I have the honour to offer you a book which contains your charming portrait. It is the latest volume
of a long series, and the first for four years and more in which you appear as anything more than a dream.
But I hope that in all this long war-time record you will find no thought pictured, no word said, that was not
loyal to the Cause by whose victory you have won an enduring heritage. With sincere homage and with great
humility I beg to present you with my - -
