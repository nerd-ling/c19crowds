TO AN UNKNOWN COLLEAGUE.
(Inspired by the erchange of Minutes
in Government Departments.)
HE was my friend—if friendship's proof
Be sympathy profound and sweet;
Eight months we toiled beneath one
roof, -
Yet somehow never chanced to meet.
So near and yet so far ! I own
"We may have passed upon the stair;
Yet, if we did, we passed unknown;
No tremor told me he was there.
He knew not it was I. Alas!
... With such community of souls
That he and I should blindly pass
And live as sundered as the poles!
Would place my judgment in his
hands, - -
Would ask him humbly to advise
And yield myself to his commands;
Just hinting what my view might be
(If asked) on this or that affair,
But never in undue degree
And with a deprecating air.
And he, thus modestly addressed,
Would wield an amicable pen
And say he thought my view was
best -
| In full nine cases out of ten.
And so in deep harmonious flood
Our friendship flowed, and proved, I
think, -
For I, when darkness sealed my eyes,
Though water be less dense than blood,
Yet blood is far less dense than ink.
º:
And now, when things are somewhat
slow,
My leisure moments I beguile
By reading o'er with heart aglow
A certain old and dusty file—
One out of hundreds, kept to prove
A truth the world may oft forget,
That there can live pure trust and
love - -
'Twixt persons who have never met.
Oh, sweet the trill of mating larks!
But sweeter, sweeter, I aver,
That soft appeal—“For your remarks,”
That gentle answer—“We concur.”
Vol. CT.VI.

A FELLow of the Royal Society states
that, as a result of radium activity, the
end of the world, which had been esti-
mated to arrive in a few thousand years,
may be postponed for a million aeons.
It is hoped that this will allay the
anxiety of those soldiers who were
nervous about their chances of being
demobilized. sk #:

ANOTHER HISTORIC
INTERVIEW.
BY OUR SPECIAL CoRRESPONDENT.
Incited to great efforts by the inter-
view in “The Times" with President
WILSON, wherein so much is said (by
the interviewer), Mr. Punch sent forth
one of his most emergetic and Napoleonic
young men to attempt a similarly in-
credible feat and obtain an interview
with that most unapproachable of men
—President not excluded—the Editor of
“The Times.” The word “failure"
being absent from the Bouverie Street
learicon, it follows that the impossible
was achieved, and the electrifying result
is printed below. In the wish that
readers in vaster numbers than usual
may peruse the winged words of the
illustrious journalist, Mr. Punch offers
the freedom of the article to all editors
the world over.
The office of The Times is situated in
a busy quarter of the great city of
London and is built of brick and stone.
Light enters the numerous rooms
through windows made of glass. Out-
side is the roar of traffic; inside, the
presses groan, not always without
rea,SOIl.
My appointment with the august
and retiring controller of the great
English journal—the Jupiter who di-
rects its thunderbolts, determines the
size of type appropriate to every cor-
respondent, and latterly has added to
the gaiety of nations by offering a tilt-
ing-space to the ATToRNEY GENERAL and
Mr. GIBSON Bowles—my appointment
being at three o'clock I was careful to
reach the office a few minutes before
that hour, because I like to have time
to look around and collect those little
details of environment and atmosphere
which are sovaluable in themselves as to
make it almost immaterial whether the
person I am to interview speaks at all.
Entering the offices, which can be
described only as palatial, I was struck
by the thoughtfulness—no doubt, ap-
pertaining to the head of the establish-
ment who was so soon, for the first
time in history, to grant me an audi-
ence—which had provided a parallelo-
gram of some fibrous material for the
purpose of removing the mud from
one's boots. A minute later I was
again delighted by the discovery of an
ingenious contrivance in the shape of
a kind of peg or hook on which a hat
and coat could be placed. It is by just
such minutiae as these that one place
is distinguished from another and
character indicated.
Punctually to the minute I was
shown into the Editor's room, where
again I was struck by the imaginative
adequacy of the surroundings. Before

Bore. “I HAVE BEEN MAKING A VERY INTERESTING CALCULATION.
PLACED END To END How FAR Do YoU THINK THEY would REACH2"
Weary Wounded. “DUNNo, Guv'Nor. STEP IT ouT AND show Us.”
Now, JUST HAVE A GUESs.
IF ALL THE WOUND-STRIPES WERE
coming to the man himself let me say
something of these. The floor was not
bare or even sprinkled with sawdust,
as it might easily have been, but it was
covered by a comfortable carpet, prob-
ably from Axminster. Comfort was
indeed the note. The desk was neither
pitch pine nor teak, but mahogany.
Upon it were scattered papers—lightly
scattered, although no doubt each was
of the most momentous, even tragical
import, some bearing the signatures
of the most eminent publicists in the
land. Yet, such is the domination of
this man, they lay there like circulars
or election addresses. In the ink-pot
was ink. A date rack was proof that
the Editor is not superior to the arti-
ficial divisions of time.
As I entered, his back was towards
me, but none the less I was conscious
of power, distinction, a man apart. I
have seen many backs, but none more
notable than this. Turning he revealed
to the full the wonder and mystery of
his famous frown—the frown of Jupiter
Tonans. Much has been said of this
frown, but since no analysis has yet
appeared in print I must be permitted
to offer one. To begin with, the frown
is not only on his face, but (one in-
stinctively knows) all over him. It
suffuses him. Could one see, for in-
stance, his knee, one is sure that it
would be frowning too.
The effect was terrifying, but I stood
my ground. As for the face, where the
frown concentrates, it is most curiously
divided. Below the masterful nose the
frown may be said to be merely threat-
ening; above the firm upper lip it
assumes a quality of such dourness as
to resemble a scowl. The forehead is
corrugated. The ears twitch, especially
the left. The eyes emit sparks.
Hitherto he had not spoken; but
now he began to unburden himself of
those opinions, hopes, fancies and ideal-
istic meditations for which I had come
so far to see him. In order that there
shall be no ambiguity I have arranged
for them to be set up in larger type
than the rest of the article. After all,
any type will suit my own poor setting,
but the jewels, the jewels must be
Seen.
“Be seated, pray,” he said.
“The world,” he added after a
long silence, “is in an unusual
state. The Versailles Confer-
ences may effect great changes.”
“Everyone hopes,” he re-
marked after another pause,
“that the weather will improve;
recently it has been far from in-
viº.
give his exact words with
scrupulous minuteness.
“A permanent peace,” he
continued, “based upon equity,
cannot but be desired. The
Election results,” he added as an
afterthought, “are interesting.”
Asked what he thought of the
PRIME MINISTER, he pondered
deeply for a while and then re-
plied, in carefully measured
tones, “I think him an excep-
tional man.”
Pressed as to the League of
Nations, he considered the mat-
ter for some minutes and then
said, “It is a fine motion. We
might, all be the happier if it
Canne.
My time being now up he bowed me
to the door and the interview was over.
The knob was of brass and had been
recently polished.
His last words were, “Mind
the step.”

Officer (to whom private has given three ardent love-letters, addressed to different persons, to censor). “WELL, what ARE You wartisg Foſt?"
Private. “’Scuse ME, SIR, BUT I JUST wastED To see You DIDN'T MAKE No MISTAKE ABOUT THE HENVELoPEs.”
THE ANTI-PICADORS.
A confere:NCE of subscribers and con-
tributors to the correspondence columns
of The Times was held at Caxton Hall
on Saturday last, to discuss the situa-
tion created in the issue of December
21st by the printing of the interview
with President WILSON in larger type
than had ever been used previously in
the body of the paper. Amongst those
present were “Scrutator,” “Bis Dat
Qui Cito Dat,” “Judex,” “Windex,”
“Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat,” “Rusticus
Expectans,” “Old Etonian,” “Anxious
Parent,” “Anti-Jacobin,” “Puzzled,”
“Octogenarian,” “Quousque Tandem,”
and “The Thin End of the Wedge.”
The Chair was taken by a “Subscriber
of Fifty Years' Standing,” who prefaced
his remarks by observing that neither
he nor any of those present was ani-
mated by the faintest antagonism to
President WILsoN. Their gratitude to
him for his services in the War was so
great that, in the abstract, they could
have no objection to his being accorded
the distinction of the largest possible
type, so long as proper distinction was
made typographically between the re-
ments of theinterviewer—as forexample
that Mr. WILsoN's bedroom is “strictly
First Empire,” or that “there seems to
be some kind of competition between
the upper and the lower halves of his
features,” or that his “grey lounge
suit” was “well cut into his body.”
But there ought to be some harmony
between the size of the type and the
importance of the views expressed. He
had himself contributed many letters
to The Times on subjects of the great-
est urgency, but had never attained
the dignity even of long primer.
(Sensation.) He thought that in the
circumstances they were entitled to
address a modest protest to the Editor,
to the effect that the use of “pica”
should be reserved for the rarest occa-
sions and not be allowed to prejudice
the claims of those who were entitled
to exercise the indefeasible privilege of
“writing to The Times.” (Cheers.)
“Scrutator,” who followed, dis-
claimed any personal grievance. His
letters had always appeared in large
type and on the best pages. But he
drew the line at “pica”; it looked too
like an advertisement and destroyed
the balance of the page.
In old days
his paper. Now he was at the mercy
of his “maker-up.”
“Judex,” speaking from the body of
the hall, said that he had heard the
interview in question spoken of as a
“splendid seoop.” He was not certain
what the phrase meant, but he did not
like the sound of it, and dreaded the
prospect of President Wilson being
made the subject of a typographical
competition between our daily papers.
While the paper shortage lasted this
might lead to very serious results in
the way of restricting the space avail-
able for the ventilation of the views of
those present.
An “Anxious Parent" pointed out
that the use of “pica” was unfortunate,
as it irresistibly suggested “picador,”
one who participated in a cruel sport,
whereas President WILSON was a most
humane and compassionate man and
had never assisted at a bull-fight.
After several other speeches it was
ultimately resolved to form an asso-
ciation, to be known as the “Anti-
Picador League,” and a small com-
mittee was appointed to draw up an
appeal to the principal Editors to
abstain as far as possible from typo-
marks of the PRESIDENT and the com-' an editor controlled the “make-up" of graphical Jumbomania.

BOY (SECOND CLASS).
Boy (Second Class) John Simpkins, a bad 'un, you must
know,
Was told to swab a plank one day by a First-Class C.P.O.,
Whose eagle eye, returning, on the deck espied a stain—
“Boy Simpkins, fetch your mop, me lad, and swab yon
plank again.”
Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!) made as though he
wouldn't go, - -
And distinctly muttered “Blast you!” to that First-Class
C.P.O.
The splendid Petty Officer fell flat upon the deck;
They bore him to the Sick Bay just a weak and worthless
wreck;
But an A.B. who was standing by had caught the wicked
word
And told the Duty Officer exactly what occurred:—
“Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), which I think yer
oughter know, Sir,
'Ad the lip ter mutter ‘Blast you!' ter the Fust-Class
C.P.O., Sir.” -
There is silence in the foc's'le, on the quarter-deck dismay,
And the lower deck is humming in a most unusual way;
The working-party pauses as it cleans a six-inch gun,
And the Officer on Duty whispers hoarse to “Number
One '':—
“Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), I suppose you ought
to know, Sir, -
Had the cheek to mutter “Blast you!' to a First-Class
C.P.O., Sir.”
Number One, his face is ashen and his knees knock as he
runs -
(A curious phenomenon quite rare in Number Ones);
But on he rushed until he saw the tall brass-hatted Bloke,
And, nervously saluting, incoherently he spoke:—
“Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), I'm afraid that you
must know, Sir, - -
Had the nerve to mutter ‘Blast you!' to a First-Class
C.P.O., Sir.” -
The Bloke turned blue and shivered, then hysterically
laughed, -
And hurried, cackling shrilly, to the Owner's cabin aft;
There in that awful presence, with lips aghast and pale,
To the horror-haunted Owner he re-told the horrid tale:—
“Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), I regret to let you
know, Sir,
Had the face to mutter “Blast you!' to a First-Class
C.P.O., Sir!” - -
You could almost hear the silence when the flags began to
flap
And the Captain made the signal that destroyed the
Admiral's nap ; -
And though I wasn't there myself beside the great man's
bed - -
You all can guess as well as I just what the Owner said:—
“SUBMITTED. -
Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!), it is thought you ought
to know, Sir, -
Has dared to mutter ‘Blast you!' to a First-Class C.P.O.,
Sir " -
The l’ress Bureau won't let me mention how the Admiral
went
ARd told Sir Eric GEDDI's, who informed the Government;
How the Cabinet, when summoned, found him far too bad
to kill, -
So packed him off to Weiringen to valet LITTLE WILL.
Boy Simpkins (Second Class, too!) down to history will go
As the first and last who dared say “Blast" to a First-
Class C.P.O.
NOVEL RECONSTRUCTION.
Simmons is a writer of fiction and was a friend of mine.
I used to play billiards with Simmons, to talk to Simmons,
but not to read Simmons.
There are limits to friendship.
I met him the other day in a very depressed state.
“Look at these munition workers,” he said. “See what
the Government is doing for them. Paying them wages all
the time that they're out of work. What about me?”
“Well, you weren't on munitions.”
“I have been on intellectual munitions,” replied Sim-
mons. “And now all my editors write to me, “Get away
from the War.' I have to transfer my machinery to peace
work. I have to turn away from the production of the Ger-
In all º Think of it. I have almost lived on him for
years. I have created hundreds of him during the War.
All my laboriously acquired knowledge of German terms—
like ‘Schweinhund,' you know—goes for nothing. I shall
have to make all my villains Bolsheviks. That will require
close study of Russia. All my old Russian knowledge goes
for nothing. They have abolished the knout and exile to
Siberia. I have to start afresh.
“Then look at my heroes. I have mastered the second
lieutenant. My typewriter almost automatically writes
‘old top,’ ‘old soul,’ ‘old bean,’ ‘old egg.' All my study
of this type is thrown away. And heroines—why, I
shall have to study dress again. The hospital nurse is
done for; the buxom proportions of the land-girl avail me
no more. My dear fellow, it will be six months before I can
deal with women's costume competently.
“And plots. How the War simplified everything. The
Zep, a failure in fact, was a splendid success in fiction.
The awkward people could be wiped out so simply. Then
one's villains could die gallantly—a bit of good in the worst
of men, you know—whispering a hurried confession in the
ears of the Company Sergeant-Major in the front trenches.
“Then, again, all misunderstandings were explained
when the W.C. looked up from his hospital bed. ‘Eric,’
she gushed, ‘you here !'. And from that moment he
needed no more medicine. My dear fellow, we shall want
new plots now ; real plots and new characters. It will be
a long time before I can return to my pre-war standard of
strong, silent, masterful millionaires from the backwoods.
Haven't I a right to seek compensation from the Govern-
ment for checking my intellectual output 2."
“I think the Government ought to pay you ten pounds
for every week in which you don't write,” I said.
Simmons shook me warmly by the hand.
The next day he cut me dead. I believe that Simmons,
though an author of popular fiction, must have been
thinking. —

THE BROTHER SERVICE.
MR. PUNCH, DEAR SIR,--I am still
with the Q.M.A.A.C.'s at what used to
be called the Front. But do not im-
agine I am cut off from news. Papers
from home pour in by every mail. I
read articles written by People Who
Know, and speeches of politicians to
female electors, and that is how I
have learned that it is we Women of
England who have won the War.
Yet out here one cannot help notic-
ing that the War was not waged
entirely by the lovelier sex. And so I
am writing to ask you to say a word
or two about the work of the Brother
Service, the less conspicuous branches
of our army, the men who hauled big
guns about, who stood in trenches, who
looked after ammunition, or who killed
mules to provide us with pressed beef.
Little bits of the great machinery—
hangers-on of the great Women's Army
Corps—yes, but without the humble
hairpin the whole coiffure falls to the
ground.
I have never been a pessimist or a
scaremonger, but without some of these
men I don't believe we women would
have won the War at all !
They ought to be encouraged, Mr.
Punch. Could you not start a Muscle
Competition for the men who helped
the women win the War? Something
like the Beauty Competitions for us
other warriors? Why not offer prizes
to the Tommy with the biggest biceps,
the Subaltern with the thickest calf,
and the Brigadier with the finest abdo-
minal development?
One is so afraid that at the next
European crisis the War Office, having
learned its history from picture papers,
will simply mobilise the women and
forget all about the men. Those absurd
machine guns with their wobbly legs
really need a man's touch. Besides, it
would be so jolly dull without them.
No, the men really helped, and we
ought not to forget it.
I hope that in years to come, when
little voices in the firelight (that's a
pretty touch—who says the Army has
made us unfeminine 2) beseech me,
“Tell us again how you won the War,
Great-grandma,” I shall retain suffi-
cient perspective to reply, “Granny
didn't do it all alone, darlings; there
were a lot of men who helped too.”

THE WATCH DOGS,
LXXIX.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Old Bowdler
has been brooding again on that idea
of a brief for the defence in the forth-
coming trial of the ex-Kaiser. He
rather fancies himself cross-examining
with courtesy but firmness some
Generalissimo or other, or reducing to
tears by an eloquent speech a court
packed with everybody who is anybody,
and in both cases having the eyes of
Europe upon him and the ears of
America hanging on his next word.
After all, barristers will be barristers
and, when they are, your ordinary man
is no match for 'em. It took another
man of his own kind to knock the
conceit out of the idea.
Lack of precedent was no difficulty
to Bowdler's learned opponent. A
ready imagination made up. To hear
him talk you would think he had
spent his life assisting at the trials of
ex-Kaisers. He described the whole
affair as if it had already taken place.
Thus:—
The culprit, he assumed, is on bail,
though not, of course, on his own re-
cognizances. First, attention is called
to the case by Counsel for the Prose-
cution rising early in the sitting and
asking his Lordship if he might men-
tion the case of WILLIAM HoHENzoL-
LERN, next on his Lordship's list.
“William who 2 '' asks the Clerk of
Assize.
“WILLIAM HoHENzolleRN,” answers
counsel : “H-O-H-E-N-z-o - double L-E-
R-N.”
A titter is heard at the idea of a man
going about with a name like that.
His Lordship, regarding it as a nuisance
rather than a joke, threatens to have
the court cleared. A juryman in wait-
ing in the gallery seizes the oppor-
tunity to ask, if anyone is to be turned
out, might it be himself.
Counsel goes on to mention the case.
“A complicated case of false pretences,
my Lord ” he begins. But his so-
licitor plucks at his gown and points
out to him that he is confusing his
briefs. Counsel apologises to the Court
and asks leave to refresh his memory.
In a passionate whisper to his solicitor
he asks who is this Hohenzollern man,
anyway, and why the devil does he
want to be mentioned before his time?
Enlightened, he explains to the Court
that the accused has got some money
together for a dock defence and would
like an opportunity to instruct his
counsel more fully.
His Lordship refuses a postpone-
ment; Hohen-what's-his-name should
have thought of this before. His Lord-
ship has every confidence in counsel's
ability to pick up the facts as the case
proceeds. If counsel's personal con-
venience is involved that is another
matter. But as for Zohenhollern—
[“Hohenzollern, my Lord”]—he can-
not expect particular treatment; and
that will do, thank you.
The ushers start calling out for him to
surrender to his bail : “Hohenzollern
Hhhohenzollern' Owen Zollern ’’
re-echoes throughout the building.
“Zollern—o-N ' " is heard faintly in
the far distance. No one notices that
a gentleman with a fierce moustache
has already made his dramatic entry
and is trying to push his way into the
dock. . . .
He is stood up with half-a-dozen
other prisoners, so that one jury may
be sworn for the lot. It is desired that
each prisoner should be identified with
his name as it is called. WILLIAM
HoHENzoLLERN, whichever he may be,
is asked to hold up his hand. An old
man in corduroys, who wears a dirty
handkerchief round his neck for collar
and cravat, and is charged with felon-
iously stealing, taking and carrying
away his forty-first pair of boots and
is also a bit 'ard of 'earing, insists
that he is the man. As nothing will
persuade him that he is not, the Clerk
of Assize leaves it to the warders to
decide which of the two is which. After
all it is a small point.
The case is called on and WILLIAM
is left in sole possession of the dock.
This is his moment, thinks he. With
set features he stands forward and

assumes the most important attitude
possible.
“Are you WILLIAM HoHENzoLLERN ?”
asks the Clerk of Assize.
There is a pause.
Everyone turns to have a look at
him. Feeling that he is thoroughly
impressing everyone WILLIAM fixes a
commanding eye on the judge, compel-
ling, as he supposes, his utmost atten-
tion.
“Let's adjourn for lunch,” says the
judge . . . - -
When at last the case gets to
hearing (so far as anything at all can
be heard over the small talk in front of
the dock and the shuffle of impatient
feet behind it) a novel point arises. A
witness refers to the War. “What
war 2" asks his Lordship. Counsel
thinks he can explain, but WILLIAM
isn't for letting him. “Will you keep
silence?” says the Judge to WILLIAM.
“You must call evidence to prove that
there was a war,” he says to counsel.
WILLIAM ſaints upon realising that
Armageddon, his masterpiece, was such
that judicial knowledge wasn't aware
of it . . .
Witness after witness is called ;
barrister after barrister, in the bar
beneath the dock rail, goes to sleep.
WILLIAM, after shaking off the stupor
caused by the awful disregard of his
personality, begins to murmur inco-
herently. The warder taps him on
the shoulder. WILLIAM, who has never
even conceived of being tapped by any-
body, bursts out with an exclamation.
The worst thing which has ever hap-
pened to him in his life then happens.
Bowdler, Bowdler of all the un-impe-
rial and un-godlike people in this world,
turns to WILLIAM to rebuke him in a
stern whisper, telling him that he is
doing himself no good and concluding
his remarks with “My man” . . .
The trial proceeds, WILLIAM being
speechless with rage. In his ears is
ringing a Hymn of Hate—hate of
everybody in the court, but particularly
of Bowdler. Every time he can get his
brain to work and his tongue to work
with it, he leans forward to breathe
some drastic utterance at his defending
counsel. Bowdler remains detached.
WILLIAM (late Kaiser) has to realise as
a cold fact that here is a wretched
mortal daring to sharpen a pencil while
he is being addressed by the ALL-
HIGHEST. The ALL-HIGHEST reaches
over the dock rail to thump the wretched
mortal's wretched head . . .
Bowdler rises deliberately. There is
a hush. He is going to say something
important. WILLIAM feels that at last
the world is sane and duly attentive to
him again. Bowdler submits that the
state of mind of the accused person
“I am,” says he.

assertive juryman, who disapproves of
business being so rushed as not to per-
mit of a hanging, expresses the view
aloud that it is all put on. Silence
ensues upon the anomaly of a jury-
man daring to express a view aloud;
WILLIAM avails himself of this silence
for the same purpose. His view, which
was evidently intended to take some
time in the expressing, starts off with
personal reminiscences of the intimate
friendship and business partnership be-
tween himself and the Almighty. The
juryman at once gives in and the ver-
dict is found before WILLIAM has com-
pleted his second sentence . . .

“You recognize, of course, that the
situation is exceptional,” said Edith's
mother. “You left New York on
December 2, and arrived at Euston on
December 13. To-day, December 18,
you ask me for my daughter's hand,
after a three days' acquaintance. Is
this the usual American pace 2''
“That is hardly my fault,” I said.
“We ran into a nasty bit of weather
off Cape Race and lost twelve hours.”
“Still,” she said, “under the circum-
stances you will admit that I have the
right to put a few questions. Edith is
all I have. She has naturally not told
me everything, but I gather you have
spoken to her a good deal about your-
Self.”
“Not more than three
or four hours at a sit-
ting,” I replied.
“And you have never
spoken to anyone else
as you have to Edith ?”
“I have.”
“Oh,” she said.
“I wish it had been
otherwise,” I pleaded;
“but life is very com-
plex nowadays on both
sides of the Atlantic.
Much that I have told
Edith I have also re-
vealed to the passport
clerk at Washington
and the keeper of birth
records in New York.
Something too I con-
fided to the assistant-
book-keeper in the War
Zone Bureau at the
Custom-House in New -
York, to the cashier of the French
consulate at home, and to the gate-
man of Cunard Pier 54, at the foot
of West Fourteenth Street. I am
sorry; I wish Edith had been the first
to whom I gave up the inner secrets of
my soul, but the fact is that to some
extent she was anticipated by your
Military Control-Officer at Liverpool.”
“It might have been worse,” she
sighed. “You have nice manners and
a good face. At home I suppose you
are quite popular?”
“Up to the twenty-fifth of October
I shouldn't have said so,” I replied.
“But since then a great many people
have taken to me.

have distributed in a little more than
a month no fewer than three dozen

ends and your Military Officer at home

“Mr. Smith,” she said, “you seem
an honest man. Do you, in your heart,
believe yourself good enough for my
Edith ?”
“Had you asked me that six weeks
ago,” I said, “I should have answered
'No.' Before I spoke to Edith, that
very same question flashed up within
me. I saw the golden sheen of her
hair in the moonlight—for you do some-
times have moonlight here in London—

and wondered whether I had the right
to speak. Of course I was not good
enough for her, but still I felt that I
was not altogether unfit. I might justly
ask for her in the face of high Heaven,
the Passport Bureau at Washington,
the War Zone Bureau at the Custom-
House, the head clerk at the Cunard
office, the watchman at the pier, the
official who changed my American
money into your own very confusing
monetary system, the man at the head
of the gang-plank, the man at the foot
of the gang-plank, the steward who
filled my alien's declaration, the steward
who gave me my landing-card, several
battalions of control officers, and ap-
proximately half the Allied diplomatic
services. When I spoke to Edith I
had all the documents in my breast-
pocket, and my heart glowed with
justifiable confidence beneath them.
The dear girl never asked for my college
certificate and my luggage check, but I
have them all here.”
I have been asked out a great deal.
“Perhaps it isn't necessary,” she
said. “You may have her, my dear
boy.”
“Without even looking at my Czecho-
Slovak visé, my club dues for 1918, and
my inoculation receipt for typhoid and

His Wife. “SURELY YOU CAN GET IT AT ANOTHER BANK? THEY CAN'T ALL BE As HARD UP As THAT."
A CONSPIRACY IN THE POULTRY-YARD.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I suppose it must be conceded that
practical jokes have not the vogue that they once enjoyed.
No longer do you discover some fine morning that the street
in which you live is blockaded with furniture vans, all en-
deavouring to deliver furniture you don't require and never
heard of before, while your staircase is a mass of flowers
and fruit constantly increasing upon you and threatening
to smother you with their amount no less than with their
scent. It would gradually appear that the deliveries both
of the flowers and the furniture were being executed in
accordance with the orders of one of your friends, and
that you had to grin and bear it as best you might. I can-
not say that the victim or the general public, when they
heard of it, looked upon it with any excess of enthusiasm.
Anyhow, practical jokes have gone out. -
Yet there is a kind of practical joke which, so far as I
know, has never been played upon anybody, and which, if
it were played, might provoke a considerable volume of
laughter and no small inconvenience. I have schemed it
out and venture to submit the plan to you.
My idea is to take some weekly magazine which caters
either for some special trade or amusement or pursuit. Let
us imagine it to be The Chicken Run, with which is in-
corporated The Fowls' Guardian. I am entitled to assume
that most of Mr. Punch's readers are acquainted with this
bright and lively feathered journal. My plan is to get
together some bold spirits, to capture the editor and his staff,
and to hold them in a comfortable but rigorous imprison-
ment for one week; to take possession of the editorial office,
and then to set to work to transform the contents of the
paper. I foresee the amazement of the faithful readers of
The Chicken Run, on being informed, in the column headed
“Hints to Beginners,” that Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's pet
Leghorn cockerel has developed a surprising taste for
latchkeys, and recently swallowed two of them, while Mr.
Asquith's Buff Orpington pullet has taken to following
him about like a dog and roosting on his bed-rail. Then
there would be a breezy editorial article designed to prove
that poultry had come out of the war with a much en-
hanced reputation, owing to the loyal part they had played
in assisting the FooD-CoNTRoLLER.
Further, there would be special articles proving, for in-
stance, that champagne is the one drink on which all breeds
of chickens increase and multiply their production of eggs,
especially if hot caviare is afterwards administered in large
bowls. Then there would be the first chapters of an en-
thralling serial whose plot revolved round the love-story of
Sir Robert Wyandotte and Lady Cecilia Buttercup—a
literary effort of unparalleled brilliancy due to the genius of
a new novelist who preferred to be known as the Red Rover
of Rhode Island. And so on and so on. If you think the
scheme is feasible, let me hear from you and I will begin
to get my team of villains together. -
Yours faithfully, THE GAME CHICK.

[JANUARY 1, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE BABES IN THE WooD.”
WHEN I saw a dull red glow in the
early evening sky above the great open
flares that lit the portals of the Theatre
Royal, I said to myself, “This brings
the Peace home to one ! ” But those
who think that England will never be
the same after the War, that all things
will become new and better, have not
reckoned with the Drury Lane Panto-
mime. Its tactics may change, but its
general strategy remains untouched by
War or Peace. Under any name—
Ali Baba or Aladdin, Puss in Boots or
The Babes in the Wood—its savour is
the same. If only a tenth part of the
enterprise that goes to the making
of its great pageants were devoted
to the invention of a new subject,
though it were only The Babes in
Boots or Puss in the Wood / How-
ever, with Bolshevism in the air it
is best perhaps not to tamper with
British institutions.
Still, even within the limits im-
posed by immemorial tradition there
surely must be somebody in the
United Kingdom who could make a
better book. It was pathetic that
so capable a cast—Miss LILY LONG
in particular — should have such
second-rate stuff to say and sing.
Seldom could one detect any at-
tempt to evade the obvious. Of
topical allusions, apart from time-
worn themes of coupons and profi-
teers, there was scarce a sign, and
such burlesque as there was had no
sort of subtlety in it. Take, for ex-
ample, the opportunity lost in the
imitation of a bedroom scene from
modern drama. It announced it-
self as something “West-Endy,”
yet it was like nothing (I imagine)
even in the remote Orient. And con-
stantly the poor play of esprit had to be
carried off by the distracting thud of
some falling body or covered by the
deadening clash of the eternal cymbals.
It is significant, in this connection,
that there never seems to be any male
character in these pantomimes that
is not committed to buffoonery. Ap-
parently no reliance is placed on the
unassisted humour of the dialogue. A
funny remark must be clinched with a
Somersault, a repartee be driven home
by a resounding smack on the face. You
might have thought that on such an
occasion there would be room for
the figure of some gallant soldier of
the masculine sex. Yet there wasn't
a vestige of khaki in the whole show,
and the only patriotic song assigned to
a man's voice had to be delivered by the
comic villain.
However, the actors were too good
to be defeated by the authors; and the
two couples—the Babes (Mr. STANLEY
LUPINo as Horace and Mr. WILL Evans
as Flossie) and the Robbers (Messrs.
EGBERT)—went far by their personal
drollery and unflagging spirits to make
up for any defect in the words. Each
member of the two pairs played very
loyally into the other's hands. Mr.
ALBERT EGBERT indeed played into
his brother's feet with equal devotion;
and the good humour with which he
accepted the fiercest blows on face and
person seemed to indicate an excep-
tionally close fraternal understanding.

atic manner) belied his villainous nature

by an unusually amiable temperament;
and Miss FLORENCE SMITHSON, with her
dainty air, furnished interludes of con-
ventional song, during which we gave
our ribs a rest.
The dancing, as usual, was rather
perfunctory, if one excepts a pas de
deua, which gave promise of a parody
of the Russians and turned out to be
just a series of contortionist feats, bril-
liant but unlovely. . . .
As good wine needs no bush, so
good babes need no wood; but Messrs.
McCLEERY and HUMPHRIEs painted for
them a quite nice one, where, after some
very pleasant business with a brace of
giant mushrooms that went up and
down like a lift, the robins came and
camouflaged the wanderers under a
counterpane of fallen leaves, where
they behaved much better than in
ordinary beds. But the best scene
was M. MARC HENRI's Temple of

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Not infrequently our novelists will follow success with a
boy hero by a sequel showing the same character grown up.
Mr. E. F. BENSON, however, has reversed this process, and in
a second book about David Blaize introduces him grown not
up, but down. So far down, indeed, as to be able to pass
through a door conveniently situated under his own pillow
and leading to a dreamland of the most varied enchantments.
I know, of course, what you are about to say; I can see
your lips already forming upon the word Alice. But while
I admit that David Blaize and the Blue Door (Hodder AND
Stoughton) is frankly built after that famous plan this
means no more than that Mr. BENSON has used, so to speak,
the CARRoll, formula as a medium for his agreeable fancies.
These are altogether original and filled with the proper
dream-spirit of inconsequence. Moreover the author has a
pretty gift for remembering just the stuff that childhood's
dreams are made of such transfigured delights as swim-
ming like fishes or flying in a company of birds; he
knows too the odd tags of speech that linger there from
daytime, things meaningless and full of meaning—“Rod-
pole-or-perch,” for example, or that thrice-blessed word,
“Popocatapetl.” Best of all, he has resisted the subtle temp-
tation to be even momentarily too clever for his audience
(you know the devastating effect that may be produced if a
grown-up pauses on the edge of the circle and reminds the
story-teller that he has a reputation for wit). In fine, this
early dream of David's shows him fortunate in having an
old family friend like Mr. BENsoN to write it down; also-
what I must on no account forget—so sympathetic an artist
as Mr. H. J. Ford to make it into pictures.
Those who have learnt to value their “TAFFRAIL" will
find matter very much to their mind in his latest book,
A Little Ship (CHAMBERs). I do not wish to institute any
invidious comparisons between the marine mixture as pro-
vided by “TAFFRAIL” and that of other nautical writers,
but this much I may say with perfect confidence: the men
to be found in “TAFFRAIL's" stories are true human stuff,
sturdy, dogged in doing their duty, and brave almost
beyond recklessness; but they are men all the time, and not
solemn and consecrated angels. That is, I suppose, why I
find that “TAFFRAIL's" stories go straight to the mark
and make their effect with no undue waste of time ; and, if
a little bit of laughter is º worked in, so much
the better. The last chapter in the book gives an account
of the Zeebrugge expedition. The story is so bravely told
that a man can hardly refrain from shouting in appre-
hension and exultation as he reads it.
I have a grudge against the publishers of Miss Mink's
Soldier (Hodder AND SToUGHTON) because they have
printed on its wrapper, “By the Author of Mrs. Wiggs of
the Cabbage Patch,” which led me, perhaps foolishly, to
hope that Mrs. Wiggs and I were to foregather once more,
and when we didn't made me just a little surly towards a
book of short tales which, opened with any other expecta-
tion, would have seemed much above the average. There

are eight stories in the book, and in almost all of them is
found that blend of pathos and humour that Mrs. ALICE
HEGAN RICE has taught us to expect. I liked “Cupid
Goes Slumming,” because it was almost Cabbage Patch;
but “Hoodooed,” the story of an old negro who believed
himself the victim of a spell which involved the presence
of a cricket in his leg, delighted me even more. His wife
removes the charm with a vacuum cleaner, in which she
has previously secreted a cricket, and the victim recovers.
It pleased me very much to learn that among “white
folk's superstitions” is the theory that it is “bad luck to
sleep with the windows shet,” and, when I come to think
of it, I believe that it is very bad luck indeed.

a case that would give some theoretic and superficial charm
to the most uncomfortable conditions of existence. Not
that A Floating Home is a work only of theory; on the
contrary, nothing could be more practical than its account
of the purchase, conversion and enjoyment of the Ark Royal.
The most prejudiced—again I speak personally—will find
pleasure in the author's zestful story of how the dingy,
foul-smelling Will Arding, full of cement (and worse things),
was transformed into the spick-and-span Ark Royal, with
a piano in the saloon and Queen Anne silver on the break-
fast-table; while for the persuadable there are added plans,
scales of expense and the like, which bring the whole
matter to a working basis. The book, in short, is propa-
ganda at its best (was it perhaps this that attracted Mr.

Lord BRAssey had too

THE VERDICT OF DEMOCRACY.
THE nation's memory, then, is not so short;
It still recalls the fields we lately bled on;
And when it had to choose the likeliest sort
For clearing up the mess of Armageddon
And making all things new, -
It chose the man whose courage saw it through.
Hun-lovers, pledged to Peace (the German kind),
And such as sported LENIN's sanguine token,
Appealed to Liberty to speak her mind,
And Liberty has very frankly spoken,
Strewing around her polls
The remnants of their ungummed aureoles.
In Amerongen there is grief to-day;
I seem to hear the martyr of Potsdam say,
“Alas for S.NowDEN, gone the downward way,
And O my poor, my poor belovéd RAMSAY;
I much regret the rout -
That washed this couple absolutely out !”
Dreadfully, too, the heart of TROTSKY bleeds,
To match the stain upon his reeking sabre,
Which is the blood of Russia, when he reads
How BARNEs, the champion knight of loyal Labour,
Downed in the Lowland lists
MACLEAN, the Red Hope of the Bolshevists.
But here is jubilation in the air
And matter made to build the jocund rhyme on,
Though in our joyance some may fail to share,
Like Mr. RUNCIMAN or Major SIMON,
That hardened warrior, he
Who won the Military O.B.E. -
Already dawns for us a golden age

HOW TO THROW OFF AN ARTICLE.
“Do you really write?” said Sylvia, gazing at me large-
eyed with wonder. I admitted as much.
“And do they print it just as you write it?”
“Well, their hired grammarians make a few trifling alter-
ations to justify their existence.”
“And do they pay you quite a lot?”
“Sixpence a word.”
“Oo! How wonderful | "
“But not for every word,” I added hastily, “only the
really funny ones.”
“And they send it to you by cheques?”
“Rather. I bought a couple of pairs of socks with th
last story; even then I had something left over.” -
“And how do you write the stories?”
“Oh, just get an idea and go right ahead.”
“How wonderful! Do you just sit down and write it
straight off?”
I just—only just—pulled myself up in time as I remem-
bered that Sylvia was an enthusiast of twelve whose own
efforts had already caused considerable comment in the
literary circles described round the High School. I felt this

“Very well. Since you are going to be a literary giantess
it is well that you should be initiated into the mysteries
of producing what I shall call the illusion of spontaneity.
Now take this story here. Here on this old envelope is
THE IDEA.” -
“Oo! Let me see. I can't read a word.”
“Of course you can't: nobody could. Rough copies are

“No. 1. Those I can read, but nobody else can.

This story is about a certain Brigade Major who is an
inveterate leg-puller. Some Americans are expected to
be coming for instruction. Well, before they arrive the
Brigade Major has to go up to the line, and on his way he
meets a man with a very new tin hat who asks him in a
certain nasal accent we have all come to love if he has
seen anything of a party of Americans. Spotting him as
a new chum, the Brigade Major offers to show him round
the line, and proceeds to pull his leg and tells him the
most preposterous nonsense. For instance, on a shot
being fired miles away he pretends they are in frightful
danger, and leads him bent double round and round
trenches in the same circle.”
“What a shame !”
“Wasn't it? Well, when he gets tired he asks the
American if he thinks he has learnt anything. The
American says, “Gee, I've been out here two years now, but
I guess you've taught me a whole heap I didn't know.
I'm a Canadian tunneller, you know, and I've got to show
some Americans our work, but I guess I've had a most
interesting time with you.”
“Ha 1 ha l''
“Well now, to put the story into its form. Here's Copy
No. 1, on this old envelope. ‘Americans coming—Brigade
Major sees American looking for party—pulls his leg—
pretends to being in frightful danger—American is Canadian
who has been out two years.’ See? Copy No. 2. Here
we begin to fill in. Describe Brigade headquarters and
previous leg-pulls of Brigade Major. Make up details of
what he tells the American —‘That's a trench. That thing
you fell over is a coil of wire. This is a sunken road—we
sunk it, etc., etc.’ Copy No. 3, additions and details, little
touches of local colour, revision of choice of words, heart-
rending erasions. And here, my child,” I concluded,
bringing out the beautiful, clean, smooth typed copy—
“here is the finished work itself, light, pleasant, fluent,
humorous and, most important of all, spontaneous.”
“Oo! But how awfully cold-blooded. I thought you
smiled to yourself all the time you wrote it.”
“My dear girl, it takes hours. If I smiled continually all
that length of time the top of my head would come off.”
“Isn't it wonderful? Fancy building it all up from jot-
tings on an old envelope I What's that piece of paper you
took out of the typed copy?”
“Oh, that 's nothing to do with the literary side of it,”
I said, crumpling up the little memorandum, which said that
the Editor presented compliments and regretted that he
was unable to make use of the enclosed contribution. L.
“Mr. Henderson . . . was received with a cry of ‘He is not on the
map now.’”—Times.
It is supposed that his supporter meant to say “not on the
mat”—in reference to an incident at the close of Mr.
HENDERSON's Ministerial career. But many a true word is
said in the Press by inadvertence.

Dear Old Lady (to returning warrior). “WELCOME BAck To BLIMEY 1"
A DEMOBILISATION DISASTER.
Private Randle Janvers Binderbeck
and Private John Hodge (of No. 12
Platoon) both enlisted in 1914. Pre-
viously Randle wrote articles, mostly
denunciatory. He denounced the Gov-
ernment of the day, tight skirts,
Christian Science, scorching on scooters,
the foreign policy of Patagonia and
many other things. John, on the other
hand, had not an agile brain. He
worked on a farm in some incredibly
primitive capacity, and the only thing
that he denounced was the quality of
the beer at the “Waggon and Horses.”
It certainly was bad. - -
In the Army Randle had no ambition
except to get out of it and to remain a
private while in it. His ambition for
his civil career was tremendous. He
tried to prod the placid John (his
neighbour in their hut) into an equal
ambition. -
“My poor Hodge,” said Randle to
John, “you must cultivate a soul above
manure. Does it satisfy you, as a man
made in the image of God, to be able to
distinguish between a mangold and a
swede? Think of the glory of literature,
the power of the writer to send forth
his burning words to millions and sway
public opinion as the west wind sways
the pliant willow.”
“I dunno as I'd prefer that to bird-
scaring or suchlike,” murmured John.
Goaded by such beast-like placidity,
Randle would forget all restraint in
trying to lash John into a worthy
ambition.
It was for talking after “Lights out”
that Randle and John were given a
punishment of three days' confinement
to barracks. Randle, pouring out a de-
vastating torrent of words in the man-
ner of a public orator, bitterly denounced
the punishment; John, who had merely
snored (the Captain said it took two to
make a conversation), bore it with the
stoicism of ignorance. -
Randle used to dream of Peace Day.
He heard Sir Dougi,As HAIG order his
Chief-of-Staff to summon Private
Randle Janvers Binderbeck. “Release
him at once,” said HAIG, in Randle's
dream, “to resume his colossal mission
as leader and director of public opinion.”
If John dreamed, it was of messy
farmyards and draughty fields; but it
is improbable that he dreamed at all.
They both went to the War and
faced the Hun. Randle thought of the
Hun only as a possible wrecker of his
career, therefore as a foe of mankind.
John hardly thought of the Hun except
in the course of coming into contact
with him, and then he used his bayonet
with careless zeal.
Randle steeled himself against the
rough edges of soldiering. He allowed
neither the curses of corporals nor the
familiarities of second-lieutenants to
affect his dreams of the future. Always,
even sotto voce in the last five minutes
before going over the top, he kept
before John his vision splendid.
It was their luck to remain together
and unhurt. Then arrived the great
day when the Hun confessed defeat.
Randle vainly awaited a sign from the
Commander-in-Chief.
There came, however, a moment
when No. 12 Platoon was paraded at
the Company Orderly-room. Parti-
culars were to be taken before filling
up demobilisation forms. Men were to
be grouped, on paper, according to the
nation's demand for their return to
civil life. -
Randle Janvers Binderbeck knew this
was der Tag. Magnanimously he over-
looked the delay and felt that HAIG
might, after all, have an excuse. John
Hodge remained placid. He had long
ago classed Randle's goadings with
heavies and machine-guns, as unavoid-
able incidents of warfare.
Randle and John were called into the
orderly-room together. By an obvious
error John was first summoned to the
table.
“Well, Hodge,” said the Company

Sergeant-Major, “what's your job in
civil life 2''
“I dunno as I got any special job,”
said John. “I just sort o' helped on
the farm.”
“You must have a group,” said the
C.S.M. “What did you mostly do
before the War?”
“S'far as that do go,” said John, “I
were mostly a bird-scarer.” -
“‘Bird-scarer,’” said the C.S.M. “I
know there's a heading for that some-
where. Agricultural, ain't it? “Bird-
scarer.' Ah, here we are. ‘Group 1.’
You'll be one of the first for release.”
The Company Clerk noted the fact,
and the C.S.M. called “Next man.”
Randle Janvers Binderbeck stepped
forward.
“What's your job, Binderbeck?”
said the C.S.M.
(To ask Lord NorthcLIFFE, “Do you
sell newspapers?” To ask Boswell,
“Have you heard of a man named
Johnson 2 ” To ask HENRY WIII.,
“Were you ever married ?”)
The futility of the question flabber-
gasted Randle.
“Come on, man,” said the C.S.M.
Randle made an effort. “Journalist,”
he said.
“‘Journalist,’” said the C.S.M.,
“‘Journalist.' Yes, I thought so.
“Group 41.’ You've got a long way
to go, my lad. You'd have done better
if you was a bird-scarer, like Hodge.
Them's the boys the nation wants—
Group 1 boys. You sticks in the
Army for another six months' fatigue.
Next man.”
That was all.
John Hodge is now soberly awaiting
demobilisation, and will not have to
wait long.
Randle Janvers Binderbeckis secretly
consoling himself by writing the most
denunciatory articles. They will never
be º but they afford an alter-
native to cocaine.
He feels that he can never again
consent to sway public opinion as the
west wind, etc., in the interests of al.
nation which rates him forty groups
lower than an animated scarecrow.
It is the nation's own fault, Randle
is blameless.

22 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
- [JANUARY 8, 1919.
THE MUD LARKS.
OUR Mr. MacTavish is a man with a
past. He is now a cavalry subaltern
and he was once a sailor. As a soldier
at sea is never anything but an object
of derision to sailors, correspondingly
the mere idea of a sailor on horseback
causes the utmost merriment among
soldiers.
“Sailors on horseback l’’-the very
words bring visions of apoplectic mar-
iners careering madly across sands,
three to a horse, every limb in convul-
sion. Why, it's one of the world's
stock jokes. . .
The pathetic part of it is that, obey-
ing the law of opposites, the saddle has
an irresistible and fatal attraction for
the poor chaps. They take to it on
every possible and impossible occasion.
You can see them playing alleged polo
at Malta, riding each other off at right
angles and employing their sticks as
grappling irons. You can see them
over from the Rock whooping after
Spanish foxes, bestriding their steeds
anywhere but in the appointed place.
As every proper farmer's boy has
long, long thoughts of magic oceans,
spice isles and clipper ships, so I will
warrant every normal Naval officer
dreams of a little place in the grass
counties, a stableful of long-tails and
immortal runs with the Quorn and
Pytchley.
It was thus with our Mr. MacTavish,
anyhow. A stern parent and a strong-
armed crammer projected him into the
Navy, and in the Navy he remained for
years bucketing about the salt seas in
light and wobbly cruisers, enforcing in-
tricate Bait Laws off Newfoundland in
mid-winter, or playing hide-and-seek
with elusive dhows on the Equator in
midsummer, but always with a vision
of that little place in his mind's eye.
His opportunity arrived with the
demise of the stern parent and the
acquisition of a comfortable legacy.
MacTavish sent in his papers and
stepped ashore for good. He discovered
the haven of his heart's desire in the
neighbourhood of Melton, purchased a
pig and a cow (which turned out to be
a bullock) to give the little place a
homely air, engaged a terrier for ratting
and intercourse, and with the assist-
ance of some sympathetic dealers was
assembling as comprehensive a collec-
tion of curbs, spavins, sprung tendons,
pin-toes, herring-guts, ewe-necks, cow-
hocks and capped elbows as could be
found between the Tweed and Tamar,
when—Mynheer W. HoHENzolleRN
(as he is to-day) went and done it.
The evening of August 4th, 1914,
discovered MacTavish sitting on the
wall of his pig-sty, his happy hunting
prospects shot to smithereens, arguing
the position out with the terrier. He
must attend to this war, that was clear,
but need he necessarily go back to the
salt sea 2 Couldn't he do his bit in
some other service? What about the
Cavalry 2 That would mean galloping
about Europe on a jolly old gee, shout-
ing “Hurrah l’’ and cutlassing the foot-
passengers. A merry life, combining
all the glories of fox-hunting with only
twenty-five per cent. of its safety—
according to Jorrocks.
What about the Cavalry, then 2 The
terrier semaphored complete approba-
tion with its tail stump and even the
pig made enthusiastic noises.
A month later MacTavish turned up
in a Reserve Regiment of Cavalry at
the Curragh as a “young officer.” The
Riding-Master treated his case as no
more hopeless than anybody else's and
MacTavish was making average pro-
gress until one evening in the ante-
room he favoured.the company with a
few well-spiced Naval reminiscences.
Next morning the Riding-Master was
convulsed with merriment at the mere
sight of him, addressed him variously
as Jellicoe, Captain Kidd and Sinbad,
and, after first warning MacTavish not
to imagine he was ashore at Port Said
riding the favourite in a donkey Derby,
translated all his instructions into nau-
tical language. For instance: “Right
rein—haul the starboard yoke line;
gallop—full steam ahead; halt.—cast
anchor; dismount—abandon ship,” and
so forth, giving his delicate and fanciful
sense of humour full play and evoking
roars of laughter from the whole house.
It did not take MacTavish long to
realise that, no matter what he said, he
would never again be taken seriously
in that place; he was, in fact, the
world's stock joke, a sailor on horse-
back (Ha, ha, ha!).
He set his jaw and was determined
that he would not be caught tripping
again; there should be no more re-
miniscences. Once clear of Ireland he
would bury his past.
All this happened years ago.
When I came back from leave the
other day I asked for Albert Edward.
“He and MacTavish are up at Corpse
H.Q.,” said the skipper; “they're help-
ing the A.P.M. straighten the traffic
out. By the way you'd better trickle
up there and relieve them, as they're
both going on leave in a day or so.”
I trickled up to Corpse and eventually
discovered A. Edward alone, prac-
tising the three-card trick with a view
to a career after the War. “You’ll
enjoy this Mess,” said he, turning up
“the Lady” where he least expected
her; “it’s made up of Staff eccentrics—
Demobilizing, Delousing, Lducational,
Laundry and Burial wallahs—all sorts,
very interesting; you'll learn how the
other half lives and all that. Oh, that
reminds me. You know poor old
MacTavish's secret, don't you?”
“Of course,” said I; “everybody does.
Why?"
Albert Edward grinned. “Because
there's another bloke here with a dark
past, only this is tother way about;
he's a bumpkin turned sailor, Blenkin-
sop by name, you know, the Shrop-
shire hackney breeders. He's Naval
Division. Ever rub against those mer-
chants 2'" -
I had not.
“Well, I have,” Albert Edward went.
on. “They're wonders; pretend they're
in mid-ocean all the time, stuck in the
mud on the Beaucourt Ridge, gummed
in the clay at Souchez — anywhere. .
They “come aboard ' a trench and call
their records-office—a staid and solid
bourgeois dwelling in Havre—H.M.S.
Victory. If you were bleeding to death
and asked for the First Aid Post they
wouldn't understand you; you've got
to say ‘Sick bay' or bleed on. If you
want a meal you've got to call the
cook-house ‘The galley,' or starve.
“This matelot Blenkinsop has got it
very badly. He obtained all his sea
experience at the Crystal Palace and
has been mud-pounding up and down
France for three years, and yet here we
have him now pretending there's no
such thing as dry land.”
“Not an unnatural delusion,” I re-
marked.
“Well,” resumed Albert Edward,
“across the table from him sits our old
MacTavish, lisping, ‘What is the At-
lantic? Is it a herb 2.' I'll bet my
soul they're in their billets at this
moment, MacTavish mugging up some
stable-patter out of NAT Gould, and
Blenkinsop imbibing a dose of ship-
chatter from BARTIMEUs.' They'll come
in for food presently, MacTavish doing
what he imagines to be a ‘cavalry-roll,'
tally-hoing at the top of his voice, and
Blenkinsop weaving his walk like the
tough old sea-dog he isn't, ship a-hoying
and avasting for dear life.” .
“They're both going on leave with
you to-morrow, aren't they?” I asked.
Albert Edward nodded.
“Then their game is up," said I.
Albert Edward's brow crinkled. “I
don't quite get you.”
“My dear old fool,” said I, “it’s
blowing great guns now. With the
leave-packet doing the unbusted bron-
cho act for two hours on end it shouldn't
be very difficult to separate the sheep
from the goat, the true-blue sailor from
the pea-green lubber, should it? They
may be able to bluff each other, but
not the silvery Channel in mid-winter."

WE are semi-officially informed on
the best authority that the undermen-
tioned nominations—some of which
have already been accepted—to the
lin
various parts of the world have been
made and approved by the Allied Gov-
ernments.
Foremost among these is the nomina-
tion “by acclamation" of Richard
STRAUss as King of the Cannibal
Islands. It is understood that the
illustrious composer has already arrived
and that a grand congress of Anthro-
pophagi with suitable festivities is in
contemplation.
Two nominations which have been
the cause of great satisfaction in diplo-
matic circles are those of Mr. MARK
HAMIBourg to the Kingdom of Palestine,
and that of M. Moiseiwitch to the
throne of the Solomon Islands. Jam-
borees of jubilation are already rife in
the latter locality.
Sir HENRY WooD has been simultane-
ously approached from two quarters.
The leading citizens of Sonora have
offered him the Presidentship of that
interesting State. At the same time
an urgent invitation has been sent to
the eminent conductor offering him
the throne of the Empire of Percussia.
Sir HENRY's decision is awaited with
feverish anxiety.
It is stated by the Corriere della
Sera that Madame MELBA, the Aus.
tralian nightingale, has been chosen
to preside over the Jug-jugo-Slav Re-
Fº while Madame CLARA BUTT has
een unanimously elected Empress of
Patagonia.
Sir Thom AS BEECHAM's selection from
among the candidates for the throne
of New Guinea is regarded as a fore-
gone conclusion. The famous violinist,
Mr. ALBERT SAMMONs, has so far re-
turned no final answer to the offer of
the Crown of Sordinia, but it is believed
that he cannot long remain mute to
the touching appeal of the signatories.
A favourable answer is also expected
from Mlle. Jelly Aranyi, who has been
nominated Queen of Guava.
On the other hand Sir Edward EIGAR,
O.M., has steadfastly declined the Tsar-
dom of Bulgaria, even though it was
proposed to change the name of the
country to Elgaria.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PARLIAMENTARY CASUALTIES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I am told that
Mr. Asquith considers that this has
been a most unsatisfactory election.
So do I. As you know, the principal
function of the House of Commons
nowadays is to provide amusing “copy”
for the late editions of the evening
papers and to give the “sketch”-writers
a chance of exercising their pretty wits.
As Mr. SPENCER LEIGH HUGHEs once
remarked in an after-dinner speech to
Mr. BALFour, “You, Sir, are our raw
material.”
Now, what I complain of is that on
the present occasion the voters have
entirely disregarded the needs of the
journeymen of the -
Press, and have ruth-
lessly deprived them
of the greater part of
their raw material. Mr.
HUGHEs himself, I am
glad to see, has been
spared, but he fortu-
nately had not to un-
dergo the hazards of
a contest. I tremble
to think what his fate
might have been if at
the last moment some
stodgy statesman had
been nominated to op-
pose him.
Against humour,
conscious or uncon-
scious, the voters seem
to have solidly set
their faces. It was
bad enough that Mr.
Joe KING—who has
probably helped to
provide more deserv-
ing journalists with a
For much of this grief the Sinn
Feiners are responsible. They have
easily accomplished what a few years
ago six stalwart British constables could
scarcely do and have removed the
gigantic Mr. FLAVIN from his emerald
bench. With him have gone nearly all
his comrades; and the once-powerful
Nationalist party, which for nearly forty
years has been such an unfailing source
of sparkling paragraphs, is reduced to
the number immortalised by WoRDs-
worth's little maid.
Almost more distressing than the
loss of individuals is the breaking up
of Parliamentary partnerships. What
is the use of Mr. Houston being re-
turned if he has no longer Sir LEO
Boarder (firmly). “You MUST ALLOW ME ANOTHER KNOB OF COAL, Miss SKIMPLE.
MY NERVES WILL No LoNGER BEAR THE NOISE OF THESE ENEEZING CRICKETs.”
and Pantaloon I fear his clowning will
fail to draw.
With so many of the old puppets
gone I feel very lonely, and can only
try to comfort myself with the hope
that the new Parliament may provide
some adequate substitutes. After all,

Meantime I remain, Sir, with the
highest respect,
Your PARIIAMENTARY Correspond ENT.
THE B00M IN ARCHITECTURE.
SINCE that far-away period before
the War, my architectural nerve has
become sadly debilitated; so when a
- card (bearing the name
of Carruthers) was
brought to me the
other morning I felt
quite unmanned.
“Some potential
client,” I observed in-
wardly, “who has
heard of the removal
of the five-hundred
pound limit and has
bearded me before I
have had time to get
the hang of T-square
and compasses again.”
I liked the appear-
ance of Mr. Carru-.
thers, and his greeting
had a slight ring of
flattery in it that was
very soothing.
“You are Mr. Bel-
lamy, the architect 2"
he said.
“I am,” I replied;
“at least I was before
the War.”
living than any other legislator who ever
lived—should have declined the contest.
Question-time without Mr. KING and
his unerring nose for mare's-nests will
be like Alice without The Mad Hatter.
It was bad, too, that Sir HEdworth
MEUx should have decided to interrupt
the flow of that eloquence which we
were forbidden to call “breezy,” and
that Major “Boadicea." HUNT, Mr. John
BURNs, Mr. TIM HEALY, and Mr. Swift
MACNEILL should have withdrawn
from a scene in which they had pro-
vided so much profitable entertainment
for the gods in the Press Gallery.
These losses made it all the more
incumbent upon the electors to see that
the House should retain as much as
possible of the remnant of its comic
relief. But what do we find? Why,
that practically every one of the gen-
tlemen who made the journalist's life
worth living in the last Parliament has
been cruelly turned down. .
CHIozzA MoREY to heckle? Captain
PRETYMAN-NEWMAN will doubtless con-
tinue to ask questions about the shock-
ing condition of his native country, but
without Mr. REDDY's squeaking obbli-
gato, “Why isn't the honourable and
gallant Mimber out at the Front ?”
they will lose half their savour. He
will be as dull as Io without her
gad-fly. Mr. “Boamerges” STANTON is
happily still with us, but with no paci-
fists to bellow at I fear that his vocal
chords will atrophy.
Then the famous Young Scots Trio,
which has given us so many attractive
“turns,” has been violently dissolved.
Mr. PRINGLE, whose ample supply of
vitriolic invective was always at the
service of the PRIME MINISTER, has
been left by an ungrateful constituency
at the bottom of the poll, and Mr. WATT
has shared his fate. It is true that
Mr. Hogge managed to save his bacon,
but without the support of Harlequin
“And have a large practice?” he
resumed.
“I certainly had a large practice
formerly,” I said. “With my methods
and experience one ought to acquire an
extensive clientèle. I have been an
architect, my dear sir, man and boy for
over forty years, and have always
followed the architectural fashions. In
the late seventies, when little columns
of Aberdeen granite were the rage—you
know the stuff, tastes like marble and
looks like brawn—I went in for them
hot and strong, and every building I
touched turned to potted meat. Then
SHAw came along—BERNARD, was it?
no, Norman—with his red brick and
gables, and I got so keen that I moved
to Bedford l’ark to catch the full flavour
of it.
“Next, the Ingle-nookers found in
me a willing disciple. I designed rows |

My chest swelled visibly. “This

THE ARMY OF ENTERTAINMENT, LTD.
As a mere soldier threatened with
unemployment owing to the sudden
outbreak of peace, I offer to any enter-
prising company-promoter an idea
which should provide him with an
immense fortune and myself with a
congenial means of livelihood.
My suggestion is that, with the con-
sent of Lord NonTHCLIFFE and the
Allies, a slice of the old lºront should
be kept up in statu quo, and a repre-
sentative assortment of troops retained
to hold it on what was our side, and to
carry on the War as it was in the good
old days of '15, when we thought our
life's work was bespoken and soldiers
with boy babies raised the question of
making acting rank hereditary. No
enemy would be employed, experiment
having proved that the existence of an
enemy detracts from the enjoyment of
modern war.
The little army, commanded by a
'comic relief.
General, himself an employé of the
Army of Entertainment Co., Ltd., would
conduct operations for demonstration
purposes. Visitors would be charged
admission to the Company's zone, and
pay extra for any particular stunt show
arranged for their benefit.
It would be necessary to acquire a
strip of country running right back to
the coast, if realism should be the aim
of the directors, otherwise it would be
impossible to show an A.M.L.O. in
action, or some interesting types of
Headquarters, or laundry Colonels win-
ning the D.S.O.
I have in mind a highly entertaining
General who might be willing to accept
the position of G.O.C. for the Com-
pany—one of those desperate old gen-
tlemen whose joy was to stalk about
busy areas and strafe the domestic and
sanitary arrangements of batteries and
battalions. He is of picturesque ap-
pearance and would afford the best

attended by the usual assistants, tradi-
tionally housed, clothed and fed, but,
the division being run as a commercial
venture, it would be a matter for con-
sideration by the directors whether
these young gentlemen should receive
a salary or pay a fee.
Some visitors might well be so de-
lighted with soldiering, free from the
annoyance of enemy action, that they
would wish to make a long stay and
experience all its variations, beginning
perhaps with the P.B.I. (or Pretty
Busy Infantry) in a mud-hole in the
front line, and passing through all the
stages of the normal military career
till they arrived at the Divisional
Château. Should anyone desire to
survey life from the altitude of an R.T.O.
(Railway Transport, not Really Tanta-
lising Officer, as supposed by some)"it
might be arranged for him, in the in-
terests of realism, to improvise infor-
mation as to trains for the benefit of
other visitors.

Appropriate rations would be in-
cluded in the entrance money, while
there might be canteens for the sale
of such extras as bootlaces and pen-
holders. Visitors would not be allowed
to bring money into the area, but would
be given the usual books of cash with-
drawal forms, entitling them to obtain
small sums from the field cashier—if
they could find him. As a field cashier
of experience would be employed and
possibly act in collusion with the R.T.O.,
these sums of money might be regarded
as prizes, and would create a pleasant
excitement without amounting to any
great expense for the Company.
Those willing to pay high prices
would have arranged for them such
displays as “normal artillery activity,”
pukka strafes, S.O.S. bombardments
or barrages chaperoning infantry ad-
vances, while balloons might be set on
fire, dumps blown up, or leave can-
celled at special rates. There might
also be an assortment of inexpensive
and amusing side-shows, such as a
Second-in-command trying to check a
monthly return of dripping, or a con-
scientious gunner calculating the cor-
rect corrector corrections. '
Should an application be received
from any person anxious to experience
war from the “Receipts” end he would
be granted free entry to the area on
the far side of the line, protected grand-
stands being erected, from which, on
suitable payment, spectators could
study his deportment. A short stay
in the “enemy's area” during a strafe
might be recommended for politicians
and arranged by their constituents.
Space forbids further detail. It re-
mains only for a Company to be formed

issued and applications invited for

WISE WORDS FOR BIRDS.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,-While lately
turning over some old family papers 1
came across a number of maxims in
rhyme which seem to me to be worthy
of publication at a time devoted to good
cheer. The form appears to be the
same as that expressed in the familiar
couplets on the woodcock and the
partridge; but these variations on an
old theme have at least the merit of
freshness and originality. -
I begin in order of magnitude with
the ostrich:-
“If an ostrich had but a woodcock's thigh
It would only be some three feet high.

Poor Old Woman (to youth, who has given her a gratuity and relieved her of her load of
wood). “I PRESUME, MY KIND YouNG FRIEND, THAT You ARE THE YoUNGEST of TIII:
THREE BROTHERs who ARE GoING out To SEEK THEIR FORTUNEs?”
Clever Youth. “No, I'M THE ELDEst. BUT I've BEEN READING THE STORIES."
If a woodcock had but an ostrich's jaw
It would have to be carved with a circular
saw.”
The foregoing lines clearly enforce
the important lesson of contentment
with the existing order. This moral
is perhaps less implicit in the lines o
the peacock:— -
“If a peacock had but the mightingale's trill
It would make all prima donnas feel ill.
If the nightingale had but the peacock's
tail -
It would merit a headlino in the Mail.”
Contentment again is the keynote of
the couplets on the owl:—
“If an owl would enter the 'muthatch's nest
Its figure would have to be much com-
pressed.
If the nuthatch had but the face of an owl
It would be a most unpopular fowl.”
A slightly different formula is to be
noted in the lines on the snipe, but the
spirit is substantially the same:–
“If a smipe were the size of a threepenny bit
It would be a great deal harder to hit.
But if it grew to the size of an emu
It wouldn't be better to eat than a sea-
mew.”
Lastly I may quote the º couplet
in which beasts as well as birds are
subjected to this searching analysis. I
think you will admit that it is the most
sagacious and impressive of them all:—
“If a pig had wings and the legs of a stork
It would damage the quality of its pork.”

REPORTS.
THE other day I was looking through some school reports,
Holidays always bring them forth. "You know the kind of
thing: History—Is most diligent but needs concentration;
Music—Lacks purposefulness, does not practise sufficiently;
Mathematics—Weak; General Conduct—Might be better;
Conversational French—Sera plus facile avec plus de confi-
ance; Theology—A sad falling off; and so on; and it
occurred to me that it might not be a bad thing, if the
report system, instead of stopping with our school-days,
pursued us through life. The periodical perusal of a report,
drawn up with as much authority as a scholastic staff
possesses, might have very beneficial results. -
My own early ones no longer exist; but it would be a
very searching test of our educational system to study these
reports thirty-five years after and subject them to an honest
commentary. How little that one learned then has persisted,
has survived the probation of time and necessity. At the
age of fifteen I knew the principal rivers of South America
!" Geography—Has made great progress”); to-day at fifty
have no recollection of any, nor any desire to have it.
Instead I can order dinner. Gastronomy for geography;
new lamps for old ! In any report drawn up now there
would be a totally different series of subjects. Thus:–
Business Method Might be better.
Punctuality . Tries his best.
Patriotism Good.
Veracity . . . - - - - - Moderate.
Financial Soundness . . . Very variable.
As a means of constructive criticism the report system
might be useful in Parliament. The Speaker, as head-
master, should be entrusted with the task of preparing the
documents. I can see some such results as the following:—
THE PRIME MINISTER.
Logic. - Weak.
Opportunism . Strong. - -
Golf . Shows little improvement.
Belligerence . . Very good. .
Tonsorial Artistry Far from satisfactory. Should give it
more attention. -
Fluent and powerful, but must guard
against impulse. Too fond in perora-
tions of drawing . metaphors from
Welsh physical geography. -
Oratory . . . .
MR. BonAR LAw. . . . .” . .
Mediation . Admirable, but must not be overworked.
Oratory . . Fair. Has tendency to unnecessary
candour. Does not sufficiently em-
ploy periphrasis.

..MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL. -
Oratory . . . Effective, if given enough time to prepare.
Modesty. I?oom for improvement. -
Polarity. Weak. - -
Ambition An honest worker.
Lastly, let us take the report sheet of one not wholly
absent from the public eye, whom I will designate merely
by the initials W. W.

ago.

HAIR-CUTTING AND DENTISTRY.
I AM going to get my hair cut. But I must first mention
the matter to my wife. -
Why do I do this? It is not because I am a coward,
for there are few men who are in reality braver than I am.
I carried my firstborn in my arms round the drawing-room
when she was a week old, and I have done other things
equally brave, the enumeration of which I spare you. But,
I could no more think of getting my hair cut without pre-
viously informing my wife than I could think of wearing a
top hat in the Strand. - -
I know what will happen when I have told my wife. She
will look up and say, “That's right; you always do it.”
And I shall say, “What do I always do?”
And she will answer, “You always get yourself cropped
like a convict just when your hair was beginning to look
nice.”
And I shall say, “I can't help that; it's got to be done.”
And then I shall go and get it done. -
But I wonder if my wife is right after all. There used
to be a nice wave in my front hair, a wave into which you
could lay two fingers. Is that there still? No, it's gone.
In fact there is not sufficient front hair to make a wave
with. It's odd how gradually these things happen. I
could have sworn that I had that wave, and there is a
photograph of me in the drawing-room with a fully-devel-
oped tidal bore; and I went on brushing my front hair and
combing it and thinking of it all the time as constituting a
wave, and lo it had vanished, leaving me under the im-
pression that it was still there and accountable for the
pleasing effect I produced in general society,
But if it wasn't the wave that produced this effect, what
could it have been 2 My voice? Perhaps. My moustache?
Idoubt it. My teeth? Possibly. See advertisements of tooth
powders passim. You know how it's done, in the before
and after style. Before you use Dentoline you apparently
do not possess so much as a front tooth. †. you
have used it once you are in possession of thirty-two
regular and brilliant white teeth, and it seems plain that
no dentist will ever make his fortune out of your mouth.
All this, however, has nothing to do with getting my hair
cut. But it brings me to an analogous consideration.
When I tell my wife I am going to get my teeth attended
to, does she try to restrain me from the fatal deed? Not
She urges me to it, and leaves me no loophole for
escape. She indulges in reminiscences of herself and the
children defying pain in the dentist's chair, and heartens
me with the statement that the instrument she likes best
is the one that goes berr-r-r-r and makes you jump.
Let me now resume my commentary on hair-cutting. I
wonder if I am sufficiently chatty with my hair-cutter.
Most men talk to their hair-cutter all the time. They dis-
cuss politics and revolutions and Britain's unconquerable
might, while I, having made a blundering start with the
weather, am brought up with a round turn on the
Bolsheviks and President WILSON's manner of dealing with
the situation. I cannot lay bare my inmost thoughts about
the League of Nations while someone is running a minia-
ture mowing-machine along the back of my neck . . .
At this moment my wife entered the room.
“My dear,” I said, “I am going to get my hair cut.”
She gave me one mind-piercing look and said, “It's
time you did. I've been noticing it for the last day or
two.” -
Nothing, you see, about convicts. Isn't that like a woman,
never to say the thing you expect her to say? It's taken
all the pleasure out of my visit to the barber. In fact I:
don't think I shall go at all.

Second Voter. “No, I voted FoE THE other MAN. You see, MR. Jones suPPoRTED Wom AN's SUFFRAGE, WHICH IABIOR."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Secrets of the Bosphorus (HUTCHINson) is one of the
happily large number of books to which time and tardy-
footed justice have now added an unwritten chapter that
makes amends for all. But for the glories of the last few
months I think I could hardly have borne to read many of
these “revelations” of Mr. HENRY MoRGENTHAU, sometime
American Ambassador to Turkey. They make strange and
often tragic reading. One of them is already famous: the
disclosure of the narrow margin by which the attack of the
Allied fleets upon the Dardanelles came short of victory.
For that, with all its ghastly sequence of misadventure, no
happy end can quite compensate. But one may read more
pleasantly now of the Prussian Baron WANGENHEIM, sitting
the day long on a bench before his official residence to exult
publicly in what looked like the triumphal march to Paris.
Mr. MoRGENTHAU has many other matters of interest in his
note-book, a large part of which is occupied by the story,
almost incredible even in an age of horrors, of the planned
slaughter by the Turkish rulers, with Germany as accessory
before and after the act, of “at least 600,000 and perhaps
as many as 1,000,000 " Armenians. He rightly calls this
murder of a nation probably the blackest deed in all the
ſoul record of the war, in which (at the precise moment of
its execution) the same people who now protest against the
severity of our terms were taking a horrible and ruthless
joy. The reminder is apt.
Much of the pleasure that I have just enjoyed over Mr.
ARTHUR SYMONs' essays of travel in Cities and Sea Coasts
and Islands (CoLLINs) belongs to the wistful joy of re-
collection: remembered loveliness in the beautiful places of
which he writes so vividly, remembered peace of the quiet
unpreoccupied days in which they were written. The book
is made up of three groups, studies of Spain, of London
and of certain coasts, chiefly Cornish. For several reasons
I found the last interested me most. There is entertain-
ment in watching Mr. SYMONs, so essentially a dweller in
cities, discovering the open air like an explorer. You know
already his mastery of delicate and sensitive words; many
of these pages catch with exquisite skill the subtle charm
of the country between land and wave, as it would present
itself to a receptive summer visitor rather than the returned
native. Mr. SYMoNs' similes are essentially urban; the sea
(to take an example at random) has for him “something of
the colour of absinthe.” In fine, though he can and does
get into his pages much of the exhilaration of a tramp over
heathery cliffs “smelling of honey and sea wind,” one retains
throughout a not unpleasing consciousness of Paddington.
I have left myself too little space to deal adequately with
other papers, among which I was delighted to find again
that called “Dieppe 1895,” long remembered from The Savoy

(though here, of course, lacking the interpretation of the
BEARDSLEY drawings). Certainly a book to read at leisure
and to keep “for further reference,” perhaps in a future
when travel studies may again become of more than merely
sentimental interest. -
Sir ARTHUR ConAN Doyle, on the strength of Danger /
and Other Stories (MURRAY), may claim a place among the
prophets who were not accepted by their own country.
“Danger!”—written some eighteen months before the out-
break of war—foretells the horrors of the unrestricted use
of the submarine. In those days Sir ARTHUR could get no
one to listen to him, because “in some unfortunate way
subjects of national welfare are in this country continu-
ally subordinated to party politics.” Possibly now that
we have been taught by painful experience all we
want to know about U-boat warfare, excitement in this
tale is rather to seek, but it remains a most successful
prophecy. In the last story of the book we have the
author in his very worst form. “Three of Them” is a
study of children, and the only excuse I can find for it is
It is all a matter of taste, of course, but personally I don't
envy Mr. J. G. LEGGE his self-imposed task of convicting
the Hun out of his own mouth of well, of being a Hun.
Germans they were and Germans they remain, and the
author goes to great lengths, even to the length of 572 pages,
to show that their peculiar qualities date back at least
as far as 1813. His Rhyme and Revolution in Germany
(CoNSTABLE) is not so much a history of the scrambling
undignified revolutionary movements culminating in the
year 1848, as a collection of contemporary comment thereon,
in prose and verse. The prose is generally bad; the verse
is generally very bad; and one turns with relief to the
author's connecting links, wishing only at times that he
would not worry about proving his point quite so thoroughly.
The bombast and the bullying, the self-pity and the cruelty,
and, most of all, the instinctive claim, typical of Germany
to-day, to prescribe one law for themselves but something
quite different for the rest of the world, run through all
these quotations, even the earliest. But the particular
value of this book at the moment is its reminder that twice
already has the House of Hohenzollern humbly pledged
that it must be in-
tended as a sop to
the sentimentalists.
Of the others my first
vote goes to “The
Surgeon of Gaster
Fell,” and my second
to “The Prisoner's
Defence;” but if you
are susceptible to Sir
ARTHUR's sense of fun
I can also recommend
“The Fall of Lord
Barrymore” and “One
Crowded Hour.” Not
a great collection, but
just good enough.

ing what it feels like to be a genius, and, speaking from a
very limited knowledge of this class, I should say that he had
mapped the mind of a genius of a certain sort very well. His
estimate of the creative artist's anguish of emptiness rings
true, and will perhaps surprise the people who think that
his lot, like a policeman's, is a very happy one. His
Martin, who struck me as a very unpleasant young man,
was a composer, who meant to achieve immortality, but
turned down the broad way of musical comedy and acquired
money instead. Just in time he repented and wrote a
grand opera, and then Mr. WILSON cut short his career in a
fashion that seemed to me regrettably hackneyed, which
was the only reason why I shared the other characters'
sorrow. Why so many people, all rather nasty people too,
came to devote themselves to Martin I could not discover,
although I had the publisher's word for it that he was
“attractive"; but perhaps his genius accounted for it.
Probably it is my duty to declare here that Martin and his
friends were almost all made in Germany before the War,
but as they are exceptionally disagreeable and quite unlikely
to inspire anyone with an unjust tenderness for their nation
I have no hesitation in recommending the book as a clever
study of temperament and a just picture of a part of the
German musical world as it was when one last knew any-
thing about it.
Mr. LEGGE suggest that he will be willing—even enthu-
siastic—to grovel in the dust to assist that occasion.
Mr. SPENCER LEIGH HUGHEs is a brilliant and distin-
guished member of the great brotherhood of the Press; he
is also a Member of Parliament and has devoted himself
heart and soul to the propagation of his principles on the
platform. He has therefore, save in respect of great age (he
is barely sixty), every right to compile and publish a book
with the title, Press, Platform and Parliament (NISBET).
It is one of the most genuinely good-tempered books I have
ever read; but that was to be expected from the author of
the column signed “Sub Rosa,” who had in this course of
desultory writing made innumerable friends and never lost
one; and, more pleasing sport than that, had brought two
people together through a matrimonial agency conducted
by W. T. STEAD, and had met the pair many years after,
to find that they were perfectly and unexpectedly happy.

THE NECROMANCERS.
THE other day, while I was out for
a ride, I happened to run up against
my two Chinese acquaintances, Ah Sin
and Dam Li, and I stopped to have a
chat with them.
ings Dam Li remarked :-
“Hon'lable officer lookee too muchee
sad.”
“Allee same like littlee dog when
'nother big dog stealum bone,” sup-
plemented Ah Sin. -
“I wasn't aware of it,” I said shortly,
a little hurt at the comparison.
“Phaps hou'lable officer losee lations
allee same little dog,” suggested Dam Li.
“Well,” I admitted, “I have lost
something—at least the Mess has.
Only it isn't rations; it's a milk-jug.”
This, our only article of plate, was a
battered piece of treasure-trove salved
from the ruins of a derelict village.
Dam Li was all sympathy.
“You talkee China boy. Him findum
one time plenty quick,” he announced
confidently. - :
“All right,” I said; “only you won't
get anything just for trying, mind.
You'll have to succeed.”
“China boy no wantchee nothing,”
replied Dam Li reproachfully.
“Him only wantchee officer smile
allee same like dog waggee tail when
lations come back,” added Ah Sin by
way of embroidery.
“Thank you,” I said gravely. “And
when do you propose to start replacing
my smile 2"
Apparently there was no time like
the present, so back we went to the
Mess and they set to work. Their
opening move was somewhat startling,
even to me who knew them of old.
“Giveum China boy one pieceeblead,”
commanded Dam I.i.
“What for 2 " I demurred.
“China Boy eatum blead and talkee
plenty good player ſprayerj," said Ah
Sin. “Then thief-man too muchee
flighten' an' giveum back jug plenty
dam quick.”
“But why should he be afraid 2 "I
asked. f
Ah Sin was very patient with me.
“Players plenty stlong language
talkee,” he said. “S'pose thief-man
not giveum back jug, belly get plenty
too muchee fat . . .”
“An' go bang allee same air-dlagon
bomb,” broke in Dam Li, rubbing his
hands together at the prospect.
“Very well, you may have your loaf,”
said I, capitulating; and then rashly I
added, “Is there anything else you'd
liko 2 ”
“Beer makee players plenty much
worser for thief-man,” said Ah Sin
ingratiatingly. --- -
After the usual greet-
|
In the end I produced the beer as
well as the bread and the incantations
commenced. They consisted in getting
outside my bread and beer, and in
filling the intervals between mouthfuls
with a copious barrage of Chinese,
occasional prostrations and a consider-
able amount of laughter. This last
aroused my suspicions and I asked
what it meant.
“Thief-man keepee plenty big pain
here,” explained Dam Li, indicating
the region to which the bread and beer
had by now all descended, “Him top-
side mad this minute.”
“Givetim back jug to-mollow,” pro-
phesied Ah Sin. “China boy come an'
see,” he added as he got up to go.
The morrow arrived and so did the
Chinamen, but not the milk-jug. This
seemed to cause Ah Sin and Dam Li
the greatest surprise. -
“Thief-man No. 1 stlong man,” as-
serted the former.
“Wantchee extla double-lation play-
ers,” agreed his companion.
“Hon'lable officer giveum China boy
'nother piece blead,” suggested Ah Sin.
“An' beer,” added Dam Li hastily.
Nosing an obvious conspiracy I at
first refused. However I at length gave
way on the understanding that there
was on no account to be a third imposi-
tion. The rites of the day before were
thereupon repeated. - -
When they were over Dam Li sud-
denly professed himself to be inspired.
“China boy seeum jug," he an-
nounced.
“Where?” I asked.
“Seeum box, plenty too muchee big,”
Dam Li went on in sepulchral tones;
“jug inside box.”
Ah Sin now joined in.
“Where isum box 2" he asked ex-
citedly.
“No savvy,” replied Dam Li, shaking
his head.
Ah Sin gazed wildly around. Seeing
a box in the distance he rushed at it.
Dam Li waved him back.
“That box no dam use,” he sta'ed.
Ah Sin tried again.
“P'haps him in dirty box,” he sug-
gested.
Dam Li rolled his eyes inwards, as
one who consulted an oracle within.
“Jug inside dirty box,” he agreed
ultimately, pointing in its direction.
“Oh, in the dust-bin,” I said. “Well,
there's no harm in looking.”
So look we did, and there, sure
enough, it was. I picked it out and
did some quick thinking. . . .
“Now, when did you two ruffians
put it there?” I asked sternly.
“Thief-man put it there,” protested
Dam Li, with a magnificent look of
| injured innocence.
“I know,” said I. “Come on, now,
tell me why you stole it, and, as you've
º it back again, I may let you
off.” "
“China boy's lations too muchee ſew,
him plenty hungly,” said Ah Sin, see-
ing that the game was up.
“S'pose him sellum jug, buy plenty
beer,” confided Dam Li unblushingly.
“But hon’lable officer lookee too
muchee sad, so China boy dam solly.
Fetchee back jug," resumed Ah Sin.
As I had often gone out of my way
to do the pair a good turn I was natur-
ally pained at their ingratitude. Taking
the jug, I turned away in silence and left
them. Ah Sin pursued me. .
“Hon’lable officer likee jug 2" he
asked.
Dam Li, who had followed, answered
for me. º
“Likee jug allee same China boy
likee lations,” he explained.
“An' China boy gottee lations, blead
an' beer, allee same hon’lable officer
gottee jug,” continued Ah Sin.
“Then what more can wantchee?”
concluded Dam Li triumphantly.
I surrendered unconditionally.

An enterprising firm of publishers
announces for immediate publication
a volume by President WILsoN, entitled
From White House to Buckingham
Palace. This work is in the form of
a diary of singular frankness, and it
contains some vivid accounts of con-
versations as well as the writer's honest
opinion of some of the most prominent
personages of the moment. -
Admirers of O. HENRY will be excited
to hear that a bundle of MS. stories in
his best vein, some seventy-five all told
(and how told !), has been discovered in
a cupboard in one of his old lodgings:
much as the manuscript of TENNYson's
In Memoriam was found in his rooms
in Mornington Crescent. How it hap-
pened that the historian of the joys and
sorrows, the comedies and tragedies, of
little old Baghdad-on-the-Subway neg-
lected to send these tales to editors we
shall never know, but he was always
erratic. The book will be published at
once, both in America and England.

After an interval of several years—
far too many—Sir JAMES BARRIE has
finished a new novel. With his cus-
tomary reticence he withholds both the
title and the subject; but the important
thing is that the book is at the binders.
Having read those announcements I
succumbed to precedent and woke up.
An Artful Appeal.
From a Japanese business circular:-
“Ladies and Gentlemen, Congratulating
upon the great victory of our Allies, we want
to supply you Water Colour Pictures and
Antique Prints fresh and much selected sub-
jects painted by the most famous artists in
Japan; so we long to have the honour to re-
ceive your favourable inspection and enjoy
yourselves with triumphing victory for Our
Lord's blessing in X'mas time.”
“Surely with all the wars and rumours of
wars all over the world, a little mare tact
could have been displayed by the powers that
be to keep the peace in the very centre of a

the East African equivalent of horse

MORE REPRISALS.
THAT ass Ellis is a poor creature,
and, like the poor, he is always with
me. I think he is a punishment in-
flicted upon me for some past error.
A short time ago I caught the “flu.”
Naturally the first person I suspected
was Ellis, but I am bound to confess
that I have not been able to prove it.
Indeed, when he followed me to hospital
two days later and was put in the next
bed, I felt justified in exonerating him
altogether.
The first remark that he made, when
he reached that stage of the complaint
where you feel like making remarks,
illustrates just the kind of man he is.
; accused me of giving the thing to
im. '
wards the end of 1914, suffering from
influenza. Since then he has had a
nibble at every imaginable disease, not
to mention a number of imaginary ones
as well. Regularly four times a day
he would waddle round the ward in
his dingy old dressing-gown, discussing
symptoms with every cot. In exchange
for your helping of pudding he would
take your temperature and let you
know the answer, and for a bunch of
grapes he would tell you the probable
course of your complaint and the odds
against complete recovery. No one,
seemed to interfere with him. You see,
Burnett was no longer a case; he was
an institution.
He spent a long time by Ellis's bed-
side. I suspect Ellis wasn't feeling
much like pudding at the moment. I
“Why?” I cried. “Do you think I
ought to send for them?”
“Send for them 2'' he echoed. “Send
for them ż And you in the grip of
C.S.M. l It would be sheer madness
—murder!”
The cold sweat stood out upon my
brow but I kept my head. -
“Have an apple, won't you, Mr.
Burnett 2 ”
He selected the largest and began to
munch it in silence—silence, that is,
as far as talking was concerned.
“Tell me,” I stammered; “wh–
what is C.S.M.” And may I have a
look at myself 2"
He cogitated. “Shall I?” he mut-
tered. “Yes, I think he ought to know.”
Then quite quietly, accompanied by
the core of the apple, there fell from
I answered his out-
burst with the scorn
it deserved.
“Preposterous,” I
said.
I added a few appo-
site remarks, to which
he responded as best
he could. But, medi-
cally speaking, I was
two days senior to him,
so that when the Sister
heard the uproar and
bustled up it was he
who was forbidden to
speak. She then pro-
ceeded to clinch the
matter by inserting a
thermometer in his
mouth. I defy any
man to argue under
such a handicap.
I finished all I had
to say and relapsed

into an expectant silence. The Sister
returned after a time, read the in-
strument and retired without a word.
As she passed my bed I saw out of
the corner of my eye that Ellis was
watching feverishly. An inspiration
seized me. I stopped her, and in a low
voice asked if she had fed her rabbits.
Sister isn't allowed to keep rabbits, but
she does. As I hoped, she put a finger
to her lips, nodded and walked away.
“Poor old man,” I murmured vaguely
to the ward in general. “A hundred-
and-seven and still rising ! Poor old
Ellis l’’
Ellis gave a little moan and collapsed
under the bedclothes. -
An hour later Burnett went his round.
Burnett isn't the doctor, at least not
the official one. I must tell you some-
thing about Burnett.
He is the grandfather of the ward.
Though quite a young man he has
grown fat through long lying in bed.
He entered hospital, I understand, to-
couldn't hear very well what was going
on, but Ellis was chattering as only
Ellis can, and the comfortable Burnett
was apparently soothing him with an
occasional “All right, old man. I'll
see what I can do for you.”
At length the grapes were all con-
sumed and the huge form of Burnett
loomed above me.
“Why, Mr. L–,” said the sooth-
ing voice, “I don't want to alarm you,
but really > *
“Really what?” I cried, starting up
in bed at the gravity of his tone.
“Well, you know—your colour; I
erhaps—”
He fumbled in the folds of his volu-
minous gown and produced a small
metal mirror. Then he seemed to
change his mind and put it back again.
“I'd better not,” he said softly to
himself, and then louder to me, “Have
you got a wife—or perhaps a mother?”
I am no coward, but I confess I was
trembling by this time.

“Cerebro-spinal men-

At the same time he
handed me the glass
and selected the next
best apple.
I looked at myself.
My hair stood straight

whitish-yellow, my eyes
blazed with unmistak-
able fever. A three-
days' beard enhanced
the horrible effect.

“Ah !” he shook his head. “And

right ankle. He is a ponderous man.
“Agony,” I moaned.
“Ah! And something throbbing like

tapping me on the head with the metal

“All the symptoms, I'm afraid.

When the proper doctor came round
a few minutes later (Burnett says) he
found his own thermometer quite in-
adequate and had to borrow the one
that registers the heat of the ward.
When he took it out of my mouth it
wasn't far short of boiling-point, and he
wrote straight off to The Lancet about
it; also they had to get one of those
lightning calculator chaps down to
count my pulse.
Long before I came to, Ellis had
been discharged, the ward had filled up
with fresh cases (except Burnett, of
course), and the armistice had been
signed.
When I was well enough they
handed me a letter which Ellis had left
for me.

WE were discussing “slim" practices
and the prevalence of the basic desire
to get something for nothing.
“If honesty,” said one of the com-
pany, “is truly the best policy, then
there is a surfeit of the worst politician.”
- “Yes,” said another, “and not only
in the West. I assure you, speaking as
the director of an insurance concern
in Shanghai, that you have no mono-
poly in inventive chicanery. Insurance
people must always be on their guard,
but never more so than among the
guileless Celestials. I can give you a
case in point. Not long ago we received
a visit from the wife of one of our
policy-holders, saying that her husband
was dead and claiming the money.
“‘Certainly,’ we said, ‘the pay-
ment will be made, but only after the
usual investigations,' and sent her back
to her village. It is not that we were
more suspicious of her than of anyone
else, but such formalities are essential.
In this case they turned out to be
peculiarly necessary, for her husband
was no more dead than you are.
“When she got back to him and ex-
plained that there is always “a catch
somewhere' in the insurance business,
he took alarm. A prosecution might
be awkward and at any cost must be
evaded. He therefore played a mas-
terly card by writing the company a
personal letter of explanation, which
he pretended was despatched before
his wife's return. The original is in
Chinese, but I have an English trans-
lation in my pocket-book.”
The pursuit of odd examples of the
epistolary art being one of the principal
occupations of my life, I secured a
copy of the document, which in English
runs thus:—
“To the – Insurance Company,
Shanghai.
“DEAR SIR,-When I died of a dis-
ease that came on suddenly an intelli-

JOSHUA.
ON July 1st, 1916, the regiment, in
company with several other regiments
and sundry pieces of ordnance, attacked
the Hun in the neighbourhood of the
river Somme. A fortnight later the
officers of B Company found themselves
in a dug-out in a certain wood. It is
now time to introduce Joshua.
of the Brigadier and slipped it into my
pocket-book. I had liked old Joshua
well, and I thought I would keep this
as a memento not only of his art but
of his ability in spontaneous untruth.
That was, as I have said, in 1916.
Much water had flowed between the
banks of the river Somme before, in
August, 1918, Joshua and I found our-
selves in that neighbourhood once more.
the entrance to our old dug-out! I went
down into it and found that, apart from
a litter of empty ration-tins, it was un-
altered. Then suddenly I bethought
me of the caricature which still lay
in my pocket-book. I had never told
Joshua that I had kept it. It seemed
a maudlin thing to have done and more-
over might have given him an exagger-
ated idea of my opinion of his art. I
Joshua was at that time
our junior subaltern, and we
called him Joshua after Sir
Joshua REYNoLDs, on ac-
count of his artistic attain-
ments, though portraits by
the hand of our Joshua
tended rather more in the
direction of caricature than
those I have seen by his
illustrious namesake. Upon
the wall of that dug-out in
that wood, for instance, was
displayed a crude though
unmistakable portrait of our
revered Brigadier, a fact of
which we were but too con-
scious when our revered
Brigadier paid us one night
an unexpected visit.
A short conversation en-
sued, during which the Brig-
adier gave rein to a repre-
hensible passion he had for
inquiring into the vie intime
of junior officers. Just as
he was leaving he turned to
Joshua.
“Why do they call you
‘Joshua'?” he asked.
Joshua hesitated. His eyes
rested for an infinitesimal
moment on the portrait on
the wall, then on the face
of the Brigadier. He cursed
me inwardly (as he told me §:
afterwards) for having ad-
dressed him by this name
in such strident tones just
as the Brigadier was enter-
ing the dug-out; but for the
credit of the British Officer

took out the picture and
looked at it. It had wea-
thered two years of warfare
fairly well. Then with an
indelible pencil I scrawled
below it—
“Sehr gute Bilde.

a hazy recollection of school-
German leading me to be-
lieve that “Sehr gute Bilde”
meant “Very good picture.”
Then I pinned it up on the
wall and went in search of
Joshua.
“Do you remember that
dug-out we used two years
ago 2 " I asked when I had
found him.
“I do,” said Joshua. “It
was there that I told old
Turnips I was called Joshua
after the O.C. Israelites at
Jericho.”
“That's the place,” said
I. “It's somewhere round
here.” And I led him un-
ostentatiously in the right
direction.
“There it is,” he cried.
“It all comes back to me.

He disappeared below and
I sat down and waited—
waited for sounds of aston-
ishment and joy from the
bowels of the earth. But I
waited in vain. Silence
reigned. Then Joshua's
head was thrust upwards.
I am happy to say that Joshua kept
his head and showed that ready wit
in an emergency which is the soldier's
greatest virtue.
“Well, Sir,” he said, “I—I think it's
because Joshua was a great warrior.”
“Ah, I hadn't thought of that,” said
the Brigadier as he took his departure,
while I subsided in a fainting condition
on to the floor of the dug-out and asked
for brandy.
That night Joshua stopped a piece of
shell with his head. We managed to
get him back, but I did not like the
look of him and I quite thought that
his number was up. Before we pushed
on next day I took down the portrait
But we did find ourselves there, for

we thought, and with an enthusiasm

retirement.”
We had had three strenuous days,
and now, while others carried on the
good work, we were resting by chance
in that very wood of which I have
already spoken. I wandered forth at

had lain for some time well within the
German lines, and came suddenly upon
“Biermeister l’’ he called. “You,
Biermeister of the 3rd Prussian Guard,

I did not go below. Joshua is so rough

THAT “DEMOBILISED"
FEELING.
TEIE WEARY TITAN.
WEARY of the labours of war-winning—
Downing mandarins in Downing
Street,
Fixing brands of CAIN upon the sinning,
Bingeing up the Army and the Fleet;
Weary of dislodging Kings and Kaisers,
Wearier of his friends than of his foes,
Prompted by his medical advisers
He has wandered South to seek re-
pose.
There to ease his cranial distension
He will lead the simple life, incog.,
Far from international dissension
Or upheavals of the under-dog;
Leaving all unread his weekly Hansard,
Studying only novels at his meals,
Leaving correspondence allunanswered,
Deaf to Foch's passionate appeals.
There, no longer rashly overtasking
Powers impaired by superhuman
strain,
But amid exotic foliage basking,
He will rest his monumental brain,
Till refreshed, daemonic and defiant,
Clad in dazzling amaranthine sheen,
He emerges like a godlike giant
Once again to dominate the scene.
There, recumbent in a chair with rockers,
Oft will he indulge in forty winks,
Or, attired in well-cut knickerbockers,
Decorate the landscape on the links;
Or, with arms upon his bosom folded,
He will stand as motionless as bronze,
While his features, classically moulded,
Hourly grow more like NAPOLEON's.
What the Conference will do without
him
Hardly can we venture to surmise;
Delegates who would not dare to flout
him
Manifest their joy without disguise.
Freed from his relentless catechizing
WILsoN goes out golfing all the day;
Printers, save for common advertising,
Sadly put their pica type away.
Still, although this act of self-seclusion
May create irreparable schism,
Whelm the Conference in dire con-
fusion
And produce a cosmic cataclysm;
Let us, musing on his past achievement,
Bear with calm our soul-consuming
rief
And condole in their supreme bereave-
ment
With his Staff, deserted by their Chief.

Still hovers sadly, unbestowed.

Mabel (on seeing some shoes of war-time quality newly-arrived on approval). “MUMMIE, ARE THEY REAL CARDBoARD?"
THE OPIUM HOUND.
Philip is a solicitor whose solicita-
tions are confined to Hongkong and
the Far East generally. Just now he
is also a special constable, for the
duration. He is other things as well,
but the above should serve as a general
introduction.
In his capacity as special constable
he keeps an eagle eye upon the depart-
ing river steamers and the passengers
purposing to travel in them, his idea
being to detect them in the act of
attempting to export opium without a
permit, one of the deadly sins.
A little while ago Philip came into
the possession of a dog of doubtful an-
cestry and antecedents, but reputed to
be intelligent. It was called “Little
Willie” because of its marked tendency
to the predatory habit. His other
leading characteristic was an inordinate
craving for Punter's “Freak” biscuits.
One day Philip had a brain-wave.
“I will teach Little Willie,” he said,
“ to smell out opium concealed in pas-
sengers' luggage, and I shall acquire
merit and the Superintendent of Im-
ports and Exports will acquire opium.”
So he borrowed some opium from that
official and concealed it about the house
and in his office, and by-and-by what
was required of him seemed to dawn
on Little Willie, and every time he
found a cache of the drug he was re-
warded with a Punter's “Freak"biscuit.
At last his education was pronounced
to be complete and Philip marched
proudly down to the Canton wharf
with the Opium Hound. There was a
queue of passengers waiting to be al-
lowed on board, and the ceremony of
the examination of their baggage was
going on. Little Willie was invited to
take a hand, which he did in a rather
perfunctory way, without any real
interest in the proceedings. Indeed,
his attention wandered to the doings of
certain disreputable friends of his who
had come down to the wharf in a spirit
of curiosity, and Philip had to recall
him to the matter in hand.
On a sudden a wonderful change
came over the Opium Hound. A highly
respectable old lady of the amah or
domestic servant class came confidently
along, carrying the customary round
lacquered wooden box, a neat bundle
and a huge umbrella. She was fol-
lowed by a ragged coolie bearing a
plethoric basket, lashed with a stout
rope, but bulging in all directions.
Little Willie sniffed once at the basket
and stiffened. “Good dog,” said Philip ;
“is that opium you have found?”
The hound's tail wagged furiously,

paroxysm of excitement. The coolie
dropped it and ran away. The amah
waxed voluble and attacked Little Willie
with the family umbrella. The hound
grew more and more enthusiastic for
the quest. Philip issued the fiat,
“Open that basket, it contains opium,"
and struck an attitude.
The basket was solemnly unlashed
amid the amah's shrill expostulations,
and the contents soon flowed out upon
the floor of the examination-hut. There
was the usual conglomeration: Two
pairs working trousers (blue cotton),
two ditto jackets to match, one suit
silk brocade for high days and holidays,
two white aprons, three pairs Chinese
shoes, three and a-half pairs of Mis-
sissy's silk stockings, several mysterious
under garments (from the same source);
one cigarette tin containing sewing ma-
terials, buttons of all sorts and sizes,

The Knight-Errant. “MY DEAR LADY, I HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF RESQUING You FROM A GREAT PERIL.”
The Lady (indignantly). “How DARE You ADDRESS ME, SIR, witHouT A PROPER INTRoduction?"
The Knight-Errant. “MADAM, IF You HAD spokEN soonER I would HAVE AskED our FRIEND HERE To FULFIL THAT NECEssaRY
SOCIAL OBLIGATION."
HOWTO DINEWISELY-BUT NOT T00WELL.
WE are exceedingly pleased to note
that our contemporary, The Pall Mall
Gazette, preaches frugality in the most
practical manner by providing a daily
menu card, with helpful comments on
the preparation of the viands. The
time for an unrestricted dietary is still
far off, and it is a work of national
importance to encourage the thrifty
use of what our contemporary calls
“left-overs.” Herein we are only fol-
lowing ancient and honourable prece-
dent, one of the earliest lyrics in the
language informing us that
“What they did not cat that day
The Queen next morning fried.”
Our only fault with the P.M.G.'s
chef is that he is inclined to err on
the side of generosity. The dinner for
January 6th, for instance, is composed
of no fewer than four dishes, of which
only one is a “left-over.” The bill of
fare opens with “Kipper meat on
toast”; it proceeds with a fine crescendo
to “Beef d la jardinière,” followed by
“Fried macaroni,” and declining grace-
fully on “Cabinet pudding.”
“Left-over meat,” as our contem-
porary remarks, “is more of a problem
nowadays than ever before, for, being
generally imported, it is not so tender
as the pre-war home-grown meat to
begin with, and the small amounts that
can be saved from the rationed joint
rarely seem sufficient for another meal.”
An excellent plan, therefore, would be
to provide all the members of the family
with magnifying-glasses. It is easy to
believe a thing to be large when it looks
large. Also there is great virtue in
calling a thing by a nutritious name.
“Kipper on toast" is not nearly so rich
in carbohydrates, calories and apla-
natic amygdaloids as “Kipper meat.”
As for the preparation of “left-overs”
in such a way as to render them both
appetising and palatable, “all that need
be done is to add a few vegetables and
cook them over again.” And herein, as
our instructor most luminously ob-
serves, “lies one solution of the problem
of quantity, for the amount of vegetables
used, if not the meat, can be measured
by the size of the family appetite.”
Once more the wisdom of the ancients
comes to our help, for, as it has been
said, “the less you eat the hungrier
you are, and the hungrier you are the
more you eat. Therefore the less you
eat the more you eat.” The instructions
for the preparation of a sauce for the
“Beef d la jardinière" seem to us
rather lavish. It is suggested that we
should give the whole a good brown
colour by dissolving in it “a teaspoon-
ful of any beef extract.” Walnut juice
is just as effective. If the “left-over”
is made of “silver-side,” the silver
should be carefully extracted and sent
to the Mint. The choice of the veget-
ables must of course depend on the
idiosyncrasies of the family. In the
best families the prejudice against par-
snips is sometimes ineradicable. But
if chopped up with kitten meat and
onions their intrinsic savour is largely
disguised. Fried macaroni, as the
P.M.G. chef remarks in an inspired
passage, is delicious if properly pre-
pared with hot milk and quickly fried
in hot fat. But, on the other hand, if
treated with spermaceti or train-oil it
loses much of its peninsular charm.
Cabinet pudding, if a “left-over,”
should perhaps be called “reconstruc-
tion pudding.” Here again the amount
of egg and sugar used must vary in a
direct ratio with the size of the family
appetite. Prepared to suit that of the
family of the late Dr. TANNER, such a
dinner as the above is not merely inex-
pensive, it costs nothing at all.
“All mules attached to the American Army
in France have little khaki bags containing
gas masks fastened to the collars of their
harness. In the event of a gas attack these
are slipped over their pleading noses.”
Daily Paper.
This, we understand, is not what the
drivers call them.

LESE-MAJESTE.
OUR triumphal march into Germany
having been arrested just west of the
Meuse, Sir Douglas HAIG (through the
usual channels) gave me ten days' leave
to visit the historic town of St. Omer.
As I only asked for seven days and he
gave me ten I knew there was a catch
somewhere.
days was worked out on the idea that
it would take me five days to get there
and five to get back. Needless to say
I ignored trains, which are a snare
and delusion in these days. I lorry-
hopped. Most people would think
many times before lorry-hopping from
Charleroi to Lille vid Brussels and
Tournai, but there is nothing that a
man with a leave warrant in his pocket
will not do — except perhaps save
money. -
It was during this leave that I
barged right into GEORGE, “George"
being our very own King, besides being
Emperor of India.
To bridge the apparent gap between
my arrival and the perturbing catas-
trophe referred to, it is only necessary
to add that if you enter from the main
route from Hazebrouck you will find
just off the road a convoy of some sixty
dear things seeing as much life as can
be beheld while groping into the insides
of the Red Cross motor ambulance
which it is their job to feed, wash, coax
and drive.
I have the entrée here (except when
the relentless Miss Commanding Officer
chases me out for breaking the two-and-
a-half rules which govern the place),
and when I admitted incautiously that
the only place on the Front that I had
not seen or been frightened at was
Passchendaele, they smiled pityingly
and promised to take me there on
Sunday for a joy ride. Shades of 1917:
What whirligigs of circumstance time
and the armistice have brought us! It
was in the joy ride we nearly upset a
dynasty.
To accomplish the journey in greater
comfort, Wee and her hut companion
Sadie got hold of a perfectly good
Colonel man who had a perfectly good
car and had, moreover, a perfectly good
excuse to go to Passchendaele (he was
really going to Boulogne), but wanted
to get a good flying start, and we set
off. We were a perfectly organised
unit, consisting of four sections (in-
cluding two No. 2 Brownie Sections),
A.S.C. complement (one lunch bas-
ket), Aid Post (bandage and thermo-
meter, carried as a matter of course by
Sadie, who thinks of these things), a
Scotch dog (mascot) and a flask of
similar nationality &º comforts
for the troops).
It appeared that the ten
On our arrival at Ypres the traffic
man held up his hand. That in itself
would not have been important, for we
have it on great authority that the
blind eye may be employed on really
special occasions, but the fellow stood
determinedly in the middle of the road,
and even traffic men, we have always
insisted, should not be run over except
on great provocation. -
“All traffic stopped between 12 and
2," he said; “the KING is passing by.”
We looked blankly at one another.
I have an extraordinary respect for His
MAJESTY, but I did wish that he did
more of his work by aeroplane at times.
We ate sandwiches, selected and
sited positions for sniping the royal
progress with our No. 2 Brownies and
photographed everything we saw, in-
cluding an American cooker, the his-
toric “Goldfish Chateau,” and a Belgian
leading a little pig, with the inscription,
“The only good Bosch in the country";
but on the whole Ypres on a Sunday
afternoon is hardly more exciting than
the “great commercial centre" of Scot-
land.
At intervals the Staff dashed up and
spoke a word or two to the traffic man,
but they departed again and nothing
happened. We all had a turn at that
traffic man, and what we don't know
about his home life, pre-war and pro-
bable post-war troubles, isn't worth
putting on any demobilisation paper.
And each time we tackled him we got a
different idea of the KING's movements
—HIS MAJESTY must have had an extra-
ordinarily complex journey that day.
Suddenly we were freel The KING
was going to lunch near the Cloth Hall
and would not be by till 2.30 P.M.
Knowing that any order emanating
from a Staff is liable to instant cancel-
lation we rushed back to the car and
told the driver to “Go || " with the “G”
hard, as in shell fire. Whether we went
round or over the traffic man I don't
know, but we slid with terrific speed
into Ypres. Traffic was a little con-
gested round the ruined cathedral, and
we barged right up against a panting
Ford, which had one lung completely
gone and the other seemingly a little
porous. A stream of traffic was coming
down our side of the road; no matter,
we must get on. Urged on by our ad-
vice the driver pulled out from behind
the dying Ford and tried to pass. It
was fearfully exciting. Some Staff on
the bank began to wave to us. Think-
ing perhaps they knew some of us, or
thought the girls looked nice, I smiled
and nodded back. More Staff waved
more arms. We were awfully pleased
with our reception. Still three abreast
on the road, the Ford having flickered
up before death, we reached the cross-
roads as a large car with a flag on it
came round the corner. The car stopped
dead. So did we. The two cars glared
at each other. The Ford writhed for-
ward hideously in its death agony. I
thought I felt funny, and when Wee
whispered something about “the Royal
Standard ” I knew why. Royal Stan-
dard 2 Good Lord ' I had visions of
three laboriously acquired pips being
torn from my sleeves by outraged
authorities. The air was rent by my
wild yell to our driver to go on—go on
and carry the Ford with us on our
bonnet if necessary.
What happened next is not very clear
in my memory. I have a hazy picture
of purple A.P.M.'s, of our GEORGE sit-
ting calmly in a Rolls Royce, of irre-
pressible woman poking a No. 2
Brownie against the window of our car
and trying to find a perfectly good king
in a small viewfinder; of the Colonel on
my right saluting, with a fearful wag-
gle of the hand, without his hat op,
that article having been simply swept
off by my own tremendous “circular-
motion-thumb-close-to-the-forefinger-
touching-the-peak-of-the-cap, etc., etc.”
Through the haze I saw His MAJESTY
graciously return our salute and I seem
to recollect Wee taking his salute as a
personal compliment to the feminine
element in the car, and smiling back
delightedly in return.
The next thing I remember was that
the car had passed, the traffic man was
gazing reproachfully at us, the Ford had
expired and our chauffeur had stopped
his engine. I don't know what Sadie
did all this time, but since, from her
position, she must have seen the
whole thing in better perspective, I
don't wonder the girl looked white.
Returning to consciousness I heard
Vee utter a tremendous sigh of intense
satisfaction. -
“I sniped him,” she said, and cuddled
the No. 2 Brownie affectionately.
“Did you turn it round after the last
one?” I asked suddenly.
“No, didn't you?”
And of course we hadn't. And there,
in the undeveloped spool lies His MA-
JESTY superimposed on the back of the
Bosch piglet we had photographed out-
side Ypres. Isn't that just the hardest
of luck? -
I'm going to ask if I can develop the
film without running the risk of losing
my commission. After all it's not so
very inappropriate, is it 2 L.

same pursuit. ... I beheld him approaching with his charge
and immediately ported my helm. He bore down on his,
keeping to his right, and we collided.
“Keep to your left, you fool!” I cried as the crash came.
“Mais mom ſ le droit, M'sieur.”
Here was a deadlock indeed. It was an English ship,
therefore the English rule of the road should be main-
tained. On the other hand, the fact that we were still
in French waters was in his favour. But my stubborn
British will would not give way, and Heaven knows how
long we should have remained there had not one of the
invalids grunted, “Caan't thee keep t' the rule o' the

I withdrew to the right, and we passed on with no ani-
mosity towards one another. Still, it was a near thing
for the Entente.

THE NEw GAME.
If Hubbard were not my friend I should describe him as
one of the most amiable and most muddle-headed of man-
kind. Under the influence of his mind things that are
quite clear become confused and lose themselves in long
vistas of statement and sub-statement and sub-sub-state-
ment, and a plain tale is darkened until at the end nothing
is left of what it originally was. If you don't believe me
listen to what follows.
We were sitting in the drawing-room one evening
recently; the various topics of the day having been more
or less exhausted, somebody proposed a round game as a
diversion. Hubbard saw his chance and dashed in. “Yes,
by Jove,” he said, “let’s have the new game of “Likenesses; '
it's a perfectly ripping game. I played it the other day
and never laughed so much in my life.”
“How do you play it?” I said.
“Oh,” said Hubbard, “it’s one of the easiest games in
the world. All you have to do is to keep your mind clear
and remember what you are driving at.”
“Right,” I said. “But what are you driving at 2"
“Well,” said Hubbard, “one of us goes out or stops his
ears and the rest choose somebody.”
“There's nothing very new about that,” I said; “I’ve
played it a thousand times.”
“Wait a bit,” said Hubbard, “and don't be so ready to
plunge. I tell you this is an entirely new and original
ame.”
gaſ Let him,” said somebody else, “get on with it in his
own way or we shall be here till past midnight. Go ahead,
Hubbard.”
“Well,” said Hubbard, “you choose somebody to be a
likeness. When your man comes in again he begins to ask
questions.” -
“Vegetable, animal or mineral,” said Butterfield, “I
knew it was.”
“No, it isn't,” said Hubbard. “The man who has gone
out and has come in says to you, What food does the
person you've chosen remind you of 2 and you say tapioca
pudding or beef-steak and kidney pie.”
“But,” I said, “there's nobody in the whole wide world
who reminds me of either of those things.”
“Well, you can choose your own food,” said Hubbard. .
“If you don't like tapioca pudding you can answer scram-
bled eggs. Only scrambled eggs must remind you of the
person you have in your mind. Then you go on to the
next man, and you ask him what cloth he reminds you of,
and he answers tweed or Irish frieze or best Angola.”
“Can anybody,” said Butterfield, “tell me what ‘best
Angola' means ? I've seen it often in my tailor's bills;
mostly, I think, as waistcoats, but I've never known what
it really is. If I had to guess now I should say it is some-
thing composed in equal parts of fancy waistcoats, tapioca
pudding and scrambled eggs.”
“Well, you'd be wrong,” said Hubbard; “it’s nothing
of the sort. When you have got as far as scrambled eggs

the game in my own way. Now your man tackles the next

“It would be difficult to choose anyone who reminded
me of either of those celebrated structures,” I said, “but
I'll take the Bank of England for choice.”
“But,” said Hubbard, “you don't take either of them,

“What do you see in a flash 2 " I said.
“The building that the man who has gone out and is
asking questions in order to guess the person everybody is
thinking of reminds you of,” said Hubbard.
“Oh, yes. That makes it absolutely clear,” said Butter-
field. “Let's get to work. Personally I haven't got
beyond scrambled eggs.”
“And I am lost in tapioca," I said. “Let's get to bed.”
That's as far as Hubbard ever got with the explanation of
his game. We left him struggling and went to bed.
THE TRUTHFUL TRAVELLER.
ALL my life I’ve been a rover; I have ranged the wide
world over,
And I've had the very devil of a time;
I've philandered through Alsatia with the nautch-girl and
the geisha;
I have heard the bells of San Marino chime.
I've hobnobbed in Honolulu with the Zouave and the Zulu,
I have fought against the Turks at Spion Kop;
In a spirit of bravado I’ve accosted the MIRADo
And familiarly addressed him as “Old Top.”
I've been captured by banditti, kissed a squaw in Salt
Lake City,
Carved my name upon the tomb of LI HUNG CHANG,
And been overcome by toddy where the turbid Irrawaddy
Winds its way from Cincinnati to Penang.
I have crossed the far-famed ferry from Port Said to Pondi-
cherry;
In a droschky shot the repids at Hongkong;
I have pounded to a jelly dancing dervishes at Delhi,
And I've chased the chimpanzee at Chittagong.
I've smoked baksheesh in pagodas, stood a Dago Scotch-
and-sodas,
Scaled the mighty Mississippi's snow-clad peaks,
Galloped madly on a llama through lagoons at Yokohama
And found rubies at Magillicuddy's Reeks.
Where the Tagus, joins the Hooghly I have bowled the
wily googly,
I have heard the howdah's howl at Hyderabad;
On a rickshaw I've gone sailing, with my boomerang
impalin
IIooded cobras on the ice-floes off Bagdad.
I have slain the beri-beri with a ball from my knobkerry;
I have climbed the Pole and leapt across the Line;
I've seen seals in Abyssinia and volcanoes in Virginia,
And I've dived into the shark-infested Rhine.
From the pemmican's fierce claws and the tiſfin's gaping
Jaws
I have never shrunk in abject terror yet;
In the jungle I have tracked them and attacked them and
then hacked them
Into mincemeat with my trusty calumet.
I have interviewed the MULLAH, KRUGER, MENELIR,
ABDULLAH,
I.o.BENGULA, SITTING BULL and Clan-na-Gael;
When I think of where I've been, what I've done and
what I've seen, -
I'm surprised that I'm alive to tell the tale.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
BATTLE-Books have already come to wear (even in so
short a time) a strangely archaic aspect. But Through the
Hindenburg Line (Hodder AND STOUGHTON) is, as its name
tells you, nearer to date than most. The writer, Mr. F. A.
McKENziE, was a Canadian war correspondent whom the
Canadian Staff, believing (as he himself says) “that the
right place for a war correspondent is where he can see
what he is supposed to describe,” allowed to live among
the troops in the front line. As a result of this unusual
privilege, his pictures of the great fights in the last stages
of the War have the reality of personal experience. The
actual smashing of the Line, for example, is an epic of
heroism and achievement still hardly realised by people at
home, who cling to an idea that the final victories were
gained over an enemy enfeebled and at disadvantage. There
are other chapters in the record that may perhaps hardly
be welcomed at this moment by those amiable sentiment-
alists who would have us treat the enemy as a Bosch and
a brother. The hospital raid at Etaples is one of them;
when, even after the light of the burning huts had made
ignorance impossible, the gentle Hun, swooping low, swept
with machine-gun fire the nurses and doctors who were
attempting to remove the wounded. That, I think, is a
memory that will linger. Another picture, queerly dispro-
portionate in the anger it excites, is that of the fruit garden
in a great country house, with its wealth of famous old peach
and pear trees still in place along the walls, but every one
methodically sawn through. By comparison a trifling
crime, but somehow I may forget other things more easily.
One would welcome the revised judgment of Dr. Solf
upon this particular expression of the German spirit.
To those who have been persuaded by writers like Mr.
H. G. WELLs that the horse has not and ought not to have
any part in modern warſare, Captain SIDNEY GALTREY's
The Horse and the War (“Country LIFE”) will come as a
revelation. Mr. WELLs has said that the sight of a soldier
wearing spurs makes him sick, or words to that effect; yet
so neglectful were our military authorities of Mr. WELLs's
opinions and teaching that they went on steadily adding
horses, many of them cavalry horses, to the Army. We
began the War with twenty-five thousand horses, and we
finished it with considerably more than a million, to say
nothing of the mules, who diffused an air of cynical amuse-
ment over the military proceedings in which they were
This may conceivably be one

more proof in Mr. WELLs's eyes of our incurable stupidity.
But those who have watched the work of our armies at
close quarters will be the last to agree with him. Captain
GALTREY in fact proves his case. He has an enthusiasm
for horses and has written a most interesting book. The
illustrations are excellent and appropriate, and the book is
admirably got up.
Valour is apt to get the better of discretion in any novel
that attempts to be quite up to date with a political subject.
Mrs. Tweed ALE places The Veiled Woman (JENKINs) in
some vague period later than August, 1914, largely in order
to decry a Government that really by now one fails to

identify, and to let off sundry feminist squibs and crackers
which, in view of the present position of woman suffrage,
can only be described as fireworks half-price on the 6th of
November. Further, to get all my grumbles frankly over,
she so constantly makes sweeping assertions against the
other sex that even the most chivalrous of male reviewers
may be inclined to kick. To hear a lady pronounce once
or twice that the males of the species are obviously dimin-
ishing in stature and strength, or that the whole programme
of the earth's return to the highest ideals is in woman's
hands, may be good for the masculine soul, but after a
while it brings up vividly BESANT's story of The Revolt of
Man—what happened then and just why. The claim to a
monopoly of self-sacrifice in particular comes very badly in
war-time. All the same, if you cut out this top-hamper
the story of The Veiled Woman on its personal side is
distinctly a good pne. I wished the heroine had not spoiled
her fine enthusiasms by mixing them so freely with a
personal vendetta; but after all it is not the characterisa-
tion that intrigues one here. The plot—which I will not
spoil by giving it away
—goes excellently, and
works up to a capital
climax.
Mr. Boyd CABLE is
the literary liaison
officer between the In-
fantry and the Air
Force. In the won-
derful stories contained
in A i r men O' War
(MURRAY) his object is
to make the armies on
the ground understand
what they owe to the
armies of the air. If
they suffer from a lack
of understanding, this
is not, I gather, likely
to be removed by the
airmen themselves, for

tale. Stay, there is yet another, Kenrick, the private tutor
of Tony, whose treatment by the author is at least vigorous.
I found him just a little surprising. A creature, we are
told, over fond of good food and wine, who, dining with his
pupil on the latter's sixteenth birthday and attempting
convivial airs, is shown his place with a promptitude recall-
ing the best manner of the eighteenth century. Subse-
quently, one gathers, he took to chronic alcoholism, combined
with amateur blackmail; and a final appearance shows the
fellow dribbling wine over the evening shirt, to whose wear
the author is at pains to tell us he was unused. Clearly
a low race, these tutors, about whom I seem hitherto to
have been strangely misinformed.
Captain RoBERT B. Ross has made excellent business of
The Fifty-First in France (Hodder AND SToughton). In
any case there could be no doubts about the merits of this
famous Scottish territorial division; it is one of the very
many British divisions which has proved itself the best of
all. I can recall its first appearance at the Front as a

our author is not only
a soldier; he has also
the literary art. Clearly
he appreciates that a
fine subject is not all
that is wanted to make
a good book; that one
needs, for instance, the
gift of observation, the
power of conveying an
impression, and a re-
serve of humour always

these are his in abund-
ance. His book treats

_sive of the Somme,
of our Navy and are magnificently reluctant to talk about
their achievements. But this reticence has its dangers,
and Mr. Boyd CABLE has set to work to remove them.
Here he has written nothing for which he cannot find “an
actual parallel fact.” I honestly believe him and com-
mend his book both to those who have a passion for tales
of high adventure and also to those—if there are such—who
need authentic instances of what our Airmen O' War have
done for us.
The best I can honestly say of Tony Heron (CoLLINs) is
that it has all the makings of a good novel, but unfortun-
ately stops there, unmade or rather unvitalized. It is the
tale of a boy's upbringing by a sternly antagonistic father,
of his growth to maturity, his love affairs, and in due course
his relations with his own son. All the events happen that
are proper to a scheme of this type; but somehow, despite
the fact that Mr. C. KENNETT BURRow wields a practised
and often picturesque pen, the whole affair remains a
literary exercise and declines to come alive. Perhaps in
justice I should except two characters, Roland, the sturdy
son born out of wedlock to Tony, and Phil, weakling child
of old Heron by a second marriage. Both these and the
relation of the pair to each other furnish a pleasant con-
trast to the anaemia which seems to affect the rest of the
will make the most intimate appeal to men of his
own and the other divisions involved. To those who
knew the affair at first hand the story will recall much
that they saw and felt themselves; often they will recog-
nise a map-reading or will come across the name of a
humble billet which they too regarded as a paradise
replete with every modern comfort. Upon those who now
learn it for the first time a deep and enduring impression
will be produced. Captain Ross writes always with a due
respect for the serious nature of his subject; but there are
times when he breaks away from his military and literary
discipline. There is, for example, a moment when he dines
well, “no more wisely than was desirable, no less wisely
than was excusable.” It must be added that the accom-
panying sketches are, if not of an ambitious order, yet
of a certain merit. At any rate they assist.

THE CAREER.
My DEAR JAMES,-Ere long the mili-
tary machine will be able to spare one
of its cogs—myself. Yes, James, soon
you will once again see me in my silk
hat, cerise fancy vest and brown boots
(among other garments). I think I
shall have brass buttons on all my
coats for the sheer joy of seeing them
without let or hindrance grow green
from lack of polish. I shall once again
train my hair in graceful curling strands
under (respectively) the south-east and
south-west corners of my ears. If I
meet my Brigadier in the street I shall
notice him or not just according to
my whim of the moment. But, James,
I shall have to work for my living.
There's the rub.
I must say the Army tries to help
one. Somebody or other has issued a
whole schedule of civil occupations to
assist me in my choice of a career. It
offers an embarrassment of riches.
Take the “A’s.” I was momen-
tarily attracted by Air Balloon Maker.
It sounds a joyous job." Think of the
delight of sending forth these delicate
nothings inflated and perfect. My only
fear is that I should destroy the fruits
of my own labour. One touch of my
rough hands is always inimical to an
air-balloon. And if you know of any
more depressing sight than a collapsed
air-balloon, all moist and incapable of
resurrection, for heaven's sake keep it
to yourself. - * . -
Allowance Man (brewing) sounds
hopeful. My only question is: Does
an Allowance Man (brewing) fix his
own allowance (brewed)?' ' -
Am I slightly knock-kneed or am I
not ? Do write me frankly on the
subject. You have seen me divested
of trousers. Because if I am then I
don't think I will try my luck as an
Artist's Model. -
Athlete.—Ha! I feel my biceps and
find it not so soft. It's a wearing life,
though. Is there such a thing as an
Athlete (indoor)? You know my speed
and agility at Ludo. * -
I flatter myself I have musical taste,
but Back and Belly Maker (piano) I
consider vulgar—almost indecent, in
fact. Such anatomical intimacy with
the piano would destroy for me the
bewitchment of the Moonlight Sonata.
There is something very alluring
about Bank Note Printer. I see the
chance of continuing the Army trick of
making a living without working for it.
Surely a Bank Note Printer is allowed
his little perquisites. Why should he
print millions of bank notes for other
people and none for himself? I can
imagine an ill-used Bank Note Printer
very easily becoming a Bolshevist.
Barb Maker (wire) I do not like. I
have too many unpleasant memories of
the Somme. It is a hideous trade and
ought to be abolished altogether.
If I am wrong correct me, but isn't
the prime function of a Bargee to swear
incessantly? ... Not my forte, James.
What you thought you heard that day
in 1911, when I missed a six-inch putt,
was only “Yam,” which is a Thibetan
expression meaning “How dreadfully
unfortunatel " I knew a Major once—
but that's for another article.
Beneath the heading “Bat " I find
Bat Maker (brick), and Bat Maker
(tennis). Under which king, James 2
Anyway, I hate a man who talks about
a “tennis bat.” He would probably
call football shorts “knickers.”
I am favourably inclined towards
Bathing Machine Attendant (why not
Bathing Mechanic, for short 2) What
a grand affair to ride old Dobbin into
the seething waves and pretend he was
a sea-serpent 1 Confidentially, there
are lots of people to whose bathing-
machines I would give an extra push
when I had unlimbered their vehicles
and turned Dobbin's nose again towards
the cliffs of Albion. - -
My pleasure in stirring things with a
ladle nearly decided me to train as a
Bean Boiler; but I fear the monotony.
Nothing but an endless succession of
beans, with never a carrot to make a
splash of colour nor an onion to scent
the steamy air. And, James, I have a
friend who is known to all and sundry
as “The Old Bean.” Every bean I
was called upon to boil would remind
me of him, whom I would not boil for
worlds. - -
Here is something extraordinarily
attractive–Black Pudding Maker. You
know black puddings. I am told that
when you stew them (do not eat them
cold, I implore you!) they give off am-
brosial perfumes, and that after tasting
one you would never again touch péche
Melba. But as a Black Pudding Maker
should I become nauseated 2
Almost next door comes Blood Col-
lector. Wait while I question the Mess
Cook . . . James, I cannot become a
Black Pudding maker. The Mess Cook
tells me that Blood Collector and Black
Pudding Maker are probably allied
trades. How dreadful!
How about Bobber 2 Does that mean
that I should have to shear my wife's
silken tresses 2 Cousin Phyllis has ap-
peared with a tomboy's shock of hair,
and she says it “has only been bobbed.”
By a “bobber"? I would like to
wring his neck. But if Bobber has
something to do with those jolly little
things that dance about on cotton
machines (aren't they called “bobbins”?)
I will consider it.
I have not even finished the “D’s.”
A glance ahead and other enchanting
vistas are revealed. For instance,
Desiccated Soup Maker, Filbert Grower
and (simply). Retired.
This Schedule is splendid in its way,
but why can't they be honest ? They
must know that lots of us in our great
national army are in ordinary life just
rogues and vagabonds. The Schedule
ignores such honest tradesmen. How
is a respectable tramp to know when his
group is called for demobilisation if he
is not even given a group 2 What a

My baker gives me chunks of bread—

56 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 22, 1919.
F. E.
A simple Biographic Recitative based
on the Tonic Sol-Fa Note of Mi.
IN ante-bellum days, ah me, when I
a stuffman used to be, and proudly
pouched a junior's fee, the Law List
styled me “Smith, F. E.” Oh, how
my place seemed small for me; not
that I scorned the stuffman's fee, but
stuffy courts did not agree with me.
I dearly longed to be respiring often,
fresh and free, the breath that was
the life of me, so I became a live M.P.
And, lest the spacious H. of C. should
fail to hold sufficiently the lot of air
respired by me, said I, “A soldier
I will be-not one of Foot (that's
Infantry), nor yet the reg'lar Cavalry,
for barrack-life will not suit me, yet
ride I must the high gee-gee;” so I
decided straight to be an officer of Yeo-
manry. Drilling the troopers on the
lea, the vent I craved for gave to me.
Moreover, on my high gee-gee I learned
what galloping could be.
Those back-bench days! Ah me, ah
me, rude Members christened me.“F.E.”
And even Punch, in kindly glee, once
on a time, did picture me a prowling
beast, beside the sea, all spotted o'er
with signs, “F. E.” That patronymic
thus will be preserved for immortality.
Newspapers, too, I chance to see some-
times apply that name to me. .
Although I found smart repartee,
shot forth from back seats, gave me
glee, still I aspired to climb the tree,
so with restrained temerity I donned a
gown of silk, i.e. became a fully-fledged
K.C. Then, after able A. J. B. was
shunted by his great party and A. B. L.
assumed the see, the latter's finger
beckoned me to face direct the enemy.
Anon the KING created me a member
of his own P.C.
And then “the active life” for me,
as Galloper to “Gen'ral” C., the loyal
Ulsterman, to free from acts of Irish
devilry. I thanked “whatever gods
may be " for training with the Yeo-
manry !
Then came the war with Germany.
Alas, again I sighed, “Ah me,” and
viewed the aspect gloomily, for I was
then in apogee from all that mighty
company that domineered the H. of C.
A. ruled the roast, not A. J. B. But,
happy thought, that company of mud-
dlers held one hope for me—my con-
stant pal of Yeomanry, the smashing,
dashing WINSTON C.; result—the Cen-
sorship for me. But not for long. The
fresh and free and open air was calling
me, so off I went across the sea to join
the fighting soldiery. But soon there
came a call for me, and back I came
across the sea to be His Majesty's
S.-G.
What next was I? Eureka! “The
Right Hon. Sir F. E. SMITH, K.C.”
Then came the storm. Sir EDwARD
C. threw up his job and let in me, before
I scarce could laugh, “He, hel " to be
His Majesty's A.-G. That wasn't bad,
I think, for me—a mild young man of
forty-threel -
Next came “the quiet life” for me.
I held my tongue, but drew my fee and
eke my A.-G. salary. Not e'en the great
calamity that overtook A.'s Ministry
and raised the wizard, D. L. G., to
offices of high degree disturbed my
sweet serenity. Nor did I jib when
Sir R. B. FINLAY took on unblushingly
the job that seemed cut out for me.
Unwilling he his weird to dreel I
whispered, “Mum's the word for me!”
Now, after waiting patiently, as fits
a man of my degree, the Woolsack cries
aloud for me, and soft and soothing it
will be to my whole frame and dignity.
And unto those who wish from me to
know what will the ending be of my
august biography, I answer in a minor
key and classic language, “Wait and
see l’’
TRANSFORMATION.
My house, which I am trying to let,
is a modest little affair in the country.
It has a small meadow to the south
and the road to the north. There are
some evergreens about the lawn. The
kitchen garden is large but most in-
differently tended; indeed it is partly
through dissatisfaction with a slovenly
gardener that I decided to leave. The
nearest town is a mile distant; the
nearest station two miles and a half.
We have no light laid on except in a
large room in the garden, where acety-
lene gas has been installed.
I am telling you these facts as con-
cisely as I told them to the agent. He
took them down one by one and said,
“Yes.” Having no interest in anything
but the truth, I was as plain with him
as I could be.
“Yes,” he said, “no gas anywhere
but in garden-room.”
“Yes, small paddock, about two
acres, to the south.”
“Yes, one mile from nearest town.”
I was charmed with his easy re-
ceptivity and went away content.
A few days later I received the de-
scription of the house which the agent
had prepared for his clients. Being
still interested in nothing but the truth
I was electrified.
“This very desirable residence,” it
began. No great harm in that.
“In heart of most beautiful county
in England,” it continued. Nothing
very serious to quarrel with there;
tastes must always differ; but it puts
the place in a new light.
“Surrounded by pleasure-grounds.”
Here I was pulled up very short. My
little lawn with its evergreens, my
desolate cabbage-stalks, my tiny pad-
dock—these to be so dignified And
where do the agents get their phrases?
Is there a Thesaurus of the trade, pro-
fession, calling, industry or mystery 2
“Garden” is a good enough word for
any man who lives in his house and is
satisfied, but a man who wants a house
can be lured to look at it only if it has
pleasure-grounds: is that the position?
Does an agent in his own home refer
to the garden in that way ? If his
wife is named Maud does he sing,
“Come into the pleasure-grounds”?
“Surrounded,” too. I was so careful
to say that the paddock and so forth
were on one side and the road on the
other.
I read on : “Situated in the old-
world village of Blank.” And I had
been scrupulous in stating that we
were a mile distant—situated in point
of fact in a real village of our own,
with church, post-office, ancient landau
and all the usual appurtenances. And
“old world" | What is “old world"?
There must be some deadly fascination
in the epithet, for no agent can refrain
from using it; but what does it mean?
Do American agents use it 2 It could
have had no attraction for Columbus.
Such however is the failure of our
modernity that it is supposed to be
irresistible to-day. And “village!”
The indignation of Blank on finding
itself called an “old world village "will
be something fierce.
None the less, although I was amused
and a little irritated, I must confess to
the dawnings of dubiety as to the per-
fect wisdom of leaving such a little
paradise. If it had all this allurement
was I being sensible to let others have
it, and at a time when houses are so
scarce and everything is so costly 2
Had I not perhaps been wrong in my
estimate? Was not the sanguine agent
the true judge?
I read on and realised that he was not.
“One mile from Blank station.” Such
a statement is one not of critical ap-
praisement but of fact or falsity. The
accent in which he had said, “Yes,
two and a-half miles from the station,”
was distinct in my ear.
I read further. “Lighted by gas;”
and again I recalled that intelligent
young fellow's bright “Yes, gas only
in the garden-room.” -
What is one to do with these poets,
these roseate optimists? And how de-
lightſul to be one of them and refuse
to see any but desirable residences and
gas where none is -
But it was the next trope that really
shook me: “Well-stocked kitchen-

and became genuinely angry. The idea
of calling that wilderness, that monu-
ment of neglect, “well-stocked.” I
was furious,
That was a week ago. Yesterday I
paid a flying visit to the country to
see how things were going and how
many people had been to view the place;
and my fury increased when, after again
and for the fiftieth time pointing out
to the gardener the lack of this and
that vegetable, he was more than
normally smiling and silent and dense
and impenitent.
“You say here,” he said at last,
pulling the description of the house
from his pocket and pointing to the
words with a thumb as massive as it
is dingy and as dingy as it is massive
—“you say here ‘well-stocked kitchen

And now I understand better the
phrases, “agents for good” and “agents
for evil.”

A TRAGEDY OF OWER-EDUCATION.
It must not be thought that I under-
estimate the value of education as a
general principle; indeed I earnestly
beg of Mr. FISHER, should these lines
chance to meet his eye, not to be in
any way discouraged by them ; but I
have been driven to the conclusion that
there is such a thing as over-education,
and that it has dangers. When you
have read this story I think you will
agree with me. It is rather a sad
story, but it is very short.
The population of my poultry-yard
was composed of five hens and Umslum-
pogaas. The five hens were creatures
of mediocrity, deserving no special
mention—all very well for laying eggs
and similar domestic duties, but from

he progressed in a manner that can
only be described as astonishing. He
quickly learned to take a letter from

under the shubbery. On Armistice day
he quite let himself go, cackling and
mafficking round the yard in a manner
almost absurd. But who did not un-
bend a little on that historic day ?
Perhaps his greatest achievement,
however, was the mastering of a system
of signals, a sort of simplified Morse
code, which we established through the
medium of an old motor-horn. One
blast meant breakfast-time; two inti-
mated that I was about to dig in the
waste patch under the walnut trees
and he was to assemble his wives for a
diet of worms; three loud toots were

the summons for the mid-day meal;
four were the curfew call signifying that
it was time for him to conduct his
consorts to their coop for the night;
and so on, with special arrangements
in case of air-raids. Not once was
Umslumpogaas at fault; no matter in
what remote corner of the yard he and
his hens might be, at the sound of the
three blasts he would come hastening
up with his hens for dinner. I was
most gratified.
And then came the disaster. I was
sawing wood one morning in the sad-
dle house, and Umslumpogaas and
his wives were sitting round about the
door, dusting themselves. All was
peaceful. Suddenly down the lane
which passes the gate of my yard ap-
peared a large grey-bodied car. Some
school-children being in the road the
driver emitted three loud warning hoots
of his horn. In an instant Umslum-
pogaas was on his feet and, his wives
IT's ONLY THE MIssus, AND SHE
at his heels, making a bee line for the
gate. By the time he reached it the
car had passed and was turning the
corner that leads to the village, when
the driver again sounded his horn
thrice. With an imperious call to his
wives to follow, Umslumpogaas set off
at full speed in pursuit, and before I
had fully grasped the situation my
entire poultry-yard had vanished from
sight in the wake of that confounded
motor-car. And it is the unfortunate
truth that neither Umslumpogaas nor
a single member of his harem has been
seen or heard of since. It is as bad as
the affair of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.
I said at the beginning that this was
rather a sad little story. Taking into
consideration the present price of new-
laid eggs it amounts more or less to a
tragedy, and I put it down to nothing
but the baleful effects of over-edu-
cation.

Always when he could he sat on the

occupied he sat on the other side on an
ordinary upright chair, in which he
could not lounge at ease.
He sat there now discontentedly,
keeping a watchful eye for vacancies in
the opposite party.
Half-way through his meal a vacancy

a sigh into the cushioned seat.
The departing customer had left the

waitress would collect the cup and
saucer and the coins.
But the waitress was busy. The

• THE NEW NAVY.
[“The New Navy of small craft, created by the special needs of the
War . . . has every reason to be proud of its share in bringing the
War to a victorious conclusion. The good wishes of the Board of
Admiralty and the Royal Navy will follow the armed yachts, trawlers,
drifters and motor-boats after they have hauled down the colours
they flew as His Majesty's Auxiliary Patrol Vessels.”
Admiralty Message to the Auriliary Patrol Service.]
THE Old Navy wakened and got under way
And hurried to Scapa in battle array,
While the drifters and trawlers looked on from afar
At the cruisers and battleships off to the War;
Having sped their departure with ev'ry good wish,
The drifters and trawlers returned to their fish.
: Do you know the sensation, so hard to explain,
Of living a former existence again,
With never a clue to the why or the when 2
Well, the drifters and trawlers were feeling it then,
And the sea chuckled deep as it washed to and fro
On the hulls of the battleships up in the Flow.
The Old Navy waited, the Old Navy swore,
While battleships costing two millions and more
Reviewed the position from starboard to port:
“It's small craft again, but we're terribly short;
Let us pray for the Empire whose sun never sets; ”
Then the fishing fleet pensively hauled in its nets.
And rolling with laughter, at varying speeds
The New Navy sped to the Old Navy's needs;
Unblushingly paintless, by units or lots,
Came drifters and trawlers and whalers and yachts;
And, heedless of Discipline Acts, I've been told,
The New Navy cheerfully winked at the Old.
Without any pride but the pride of its race,
The New Navy took its historical place
In warfare on quite unconventional lines
As hunting sea vermin or sweeping for mines,
Till the sea would agree when a battleship swore
That surely they'd helped an Old Navy before.
Through Summer and Autumn, through Winter and
Spring
The Old Navy patiently guarded the ring,
The while the Auxiliaries out on the blue
Were making the most of the flag that they flew,
And a cruiser would call to her sister, astern,
“Precocious as ever, they've nothing to learn "
The Old Navy stretched as they got under way
To take the Surrender that fell on a Day,
And the drifters and trawlers looked on from afar
At the cruisers and battleships winning the War,
And, cheering the conquest with ev'ry good wish,
Prepared to go back to their nets and their fish.
But scarce had the fishing fleet time to turn round
When there fell on their ears a remarkable sound,
And some who were present have given their word
That the roll of DRAKE's drum through the squadrons
was heard;
Resulted a sequel as strange as it's true,
The Old Navy solemnly winked at the New.
The moral is simple but worthy of note
Whenever the spirit of DRAKE is afloat,
There's only one Navy when foes come to grips,
And nobody knows it so well as the ships,
And so when the small craft are blessed by the Board,
Demurely they murmur: “New Navy 2 Oh, Lord!”
OUR BEAUTY COLUMN.
(Latest Style.)
WE four are such friends, Estelle, Rosalie, Beryl and I.
If we weren't could we sit round and say the things to
each other that we do? I ask you.
It's quite a small flat we have, just the one room, but
it's so convenient. There's a chemist's next door, so it's
no walk to get everything we require.
We were sitting round our cosy fireplace, wishing it
were summer or that we had some coal, when one of those
thoughts that make me so loved occurred to me.
“Estelle darling,” I asked, though I knew, because the
box was on the mantelpiece, “how do you get that lovely
flush 2 Your nose is such a delicious tint; it reminds me
of a tomato.” - - --
“I owe my colour to my fur coat,” replied Estelle
frankly; “you've no idea how warm it keeps me. I
think a natural glow is so much more becoming than
an artificial one.” -
“By the way, Madge,” put in Rosalie (I'm Madge), “as
you've started the game may I ask you a question ? How
do you get such a lovely shine on your nose?”
“Chamois leather,” I replied sweetly. (You see we're
such friends we love telling each other our boudoir secrets.)
“I wish I knew how you keep those cunning little curls,
Estelle," sighed Beryl longingly. “My hair is so horribly
straight.”
“It's quite easy,” explained Estelle; “you can do it
with any ordinary flat-iron, though of course an electric-
iron is the best. If you heat the iron over the gas or fire
(if any) it gets sooty, and if you've golden hair, as I
have this year—well. Only,” she went on warningly,
“always see that you lay your curl flat on the table
before you iron it.”
“I wish I could get my hands as white as yours,
Beryl,” I said.
“You can't expect to, darling; working at Whitehall as
you do your fingers are bound to get stained with nicotine.
Warm water and soap is all I use. First I immerse
my hands in tepid water, then I rub the soap (you can
get it at any chemist's or oil-shop) into the pores—you'd
be surprised how it lathers if you do it the right way—and
then I rinse the soap off again. I learnt that trick from
watching our washer-woman—she had such lovely hands.”
“Why do you never use powder now, Estelle?” asked
Rosalie. “Before the War one could never come near you
without leaving footprints.”
“My reasons were partly patriotic, conserving the food-
supply, you know, and partly owing to the mulatto-like
tint the war-flour gave me. One doesn't want to go about
looking half-baked, does one?”
“No," we murmured, making a pretty concerted number
of it.
“But wrinkles, darling Estelle,” I pleaded—“do tell us
what you do for your wrinkles.”
“Wrinkles,” murmured Estelle, with a pretty puckering
of her brow—“I haven't any left; I've given them all to
'ou.”

Sergeant. “ONLY ONE BUTTON DECENTLY cle AN.
AGAINST THE CANTEEN COUNTER.” -
AND I SUPPOSE YOU MANAGED TO GET THAT ONE BRIGHT BY RUBBIN' OF IT
A MILITARY EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I write to ask
your advice. As you know, the Army
Council in its wisdom decreed that the
Army, before being demobilised, must
be educated. I have been chosen as
one of the Educators.
My efforts to lead the Army into the
paths of light and learning were crowned
with success until in an evil moment
I undertook to teach Private Goodbody.
This genial ornament of our regimental
sanitary squad is especially anxious to
plumb the mysteries of arithmetic.
When he had, as I thought, finally
mastered the principle that if you bor-
row one from the shillings' column you
must pay it back in the pounds' column,
I set him the following sum :—
“Supposing you owed the butcher
sixteen shillings and three pence half.
penny and took a pound note to pay
him with, how much change ought he
to give you?” -
Private Goodbody scratched his head
for several minutes and at last decided
that he did not know.
“But come, Goodbody,” I urged,
“surely it's quite easy.” And I re-
peated the question.
“I don't know, Sir ; I don't never
have no truck with butchers,” he de-
clared emphatically. “I leaves that
'ere to the missus.”
“Ah !” I said, “and how does she
get the money to pay him 2"
“I gives it 'er," said Goodbody.
“What does she do with the change?”
I asked next.
“Gives it back to me, I reck'n,” he
answered.
“Well,” I continued, “if you don't
know how much change there ought
to be when you give her a pound and
she spends sixteen shillings and three
pence halfpenny, how do you know she
gives you back the right amount 2"
Private Goodbody eyed me with
something suspiciously like contempt.
“If my missus started playin' any o'
them monkey tricks on me, givin' the
wrong change an' sich, I'd put it acrost
'er,” he said.
And there the matter rests for the
present. I feel that I should not lead
Private Goodbody any further into the
intricacies of his subject until he has
solved my problem. This he resolutely
professes himself unable to do, and begs
to be allowed to leave it and plunge
into the giddy vortex of the multipli-
cation table.
Yours faithfully, MENToR.

THE WAR IDOGS' PARTY.
I AM a plain dog that barks his mind
and believes in calling a bone a bone,
not one of your sentimental sort that
allows the tail—that uncontrollable seat
of the emotions—to govern the head.
I voted Coalition, of course. As a
veteran—three chevrons and the Croix
de Guerre—I could hardly refuse to
support the man who above all others
helped us war dogs to beat the Bosch.
But to say that I am satisfied with the
way things are going on—that's a
mouse of a very different colour, as the
phrase goes. A terrier person who claims
to own the PRIME MINISTER and has
been very busy demanding what he calls
our invaluable suffrages buttonholed
me the other day outside the tripe shop
and commenced to tell me all the won-
derful things that we dogs would get if
we only elected a strong Coalition Gov-
ernment—betterbiscuits, larger kennels,
equal rabbits for all and I don't know
what else. But when I asked him
plainly, “Are you in favour of keep-
ing out the dachshunds 2" the fellow
hedged and said the question was not
so important as some people seemed to
think, and that financial interests had
to be considered.
And that's how the War Dogs' Party
came to be formed, for when they heard
how the land lay some of the influential
dogs in our neighbourhood called a
meeting in Jorrocks' Mews and elected
me chairman. We decided that mem-
bership should not be confined to dogs
who had actually seen service at the
Front, but that any dog who had faced
the trials of the War in the spirit of
true patriotism should be eligible. A
slight difficulty was encountered in the
case of the Irish terrier who owns the
butcher's shop and notoriously has
never been on bone rations, some of
the young hotheads claiming that he
was not eligible. But Snap is a very
popular dog, and when heis not brooding
over his national grievances is a merry
fellow and always ready to share a bone
with a pal. So I ruled that on account
of the historic wrongs of Ireland we
would overlook Snap's defiance of the
Public Bones Order and allow him to
be one of us.
One of the first things you learn in
the trenches is the use of tact in coping
with delicate situations. Well, we drew
up a very strong platform and were on
the point of carrying it unanimously
when our secretary, a clever fellow but
temperamental, like all poodles, spotted
the big yellow cat from No. 14 slinking
down the street on some poisonous
errand or other, and the meeting ad-
journed in what I can only describe as
a disorderly manner. Of course we are
treating the Declaration of Peace Aims,
as we called it, as carried, though the
secretary insists on adding a fifteenth
point, which he says is of vital im-
portance, relating to the Declawing of
Yellow Cats.
The first plank in our platform is
BRITAIN FoR BRITISH Dogs, which
sounds very well, don't you think?
Sassafras, the Aberdeen terrier from
No. 3, a solid fellow but unimaginative,
wanted it to be ONCE A U-DoG ALways
A U-Dog, but I ruled that that couldn't
be right because once there had been a
U-dog next door to us, but now there
wasn't. Of course they all wanted to
hear about it, but we war dogs are
supposed to be as modest as we are

THE MUD LARKS.
I MET a man in the Club at Lille the
other day who told me that he knew
all about women. He had studied the
subject, he said, and could read 'em like
an open book. He admitted that it
took a bit of doing, but that once you
had the secret they would trot up and
eat out of your hand. -
Having thus spoken he swallowed
three whiskies in rapid succession and
rushed away to jump a lorry-ride to
Germany, and I have not seen him
since, much to my regret, for I need
his advice, I do.
x >k >k >k xk
We splashed into the hamlet of
Sailly-le-Petit at about eight o'clock of
a pouring dark night, to find the in-
habitants abed and all doors closed
upon us and retired, presumably to
bed. The Corporal, who during the
parley had been scouting round about,
returned to report room for all hands
in the barn, which was quite empty.
Without further ado I pushed all hands
into the barn and left them for the
night. -
Next morning, while walking in the
village street, I beheld a remarkable
trio approaching. It consisted of a
venerable cleric—his skirts held high
enough out of the mud to reveal the
fact that he favoured flannel under-
clothing and British army socks—and
a massive rustic dressed principally in
hair, straw-ends and corduroys. The
third member was a thick short bull-
'dog of a woman, who, from the masterly
way in which she kept corduroys from
slipping into the village smithy and
and prodded the Curé. But the Curé
was engaged in religious exercises,
beads flying through his fingers, lips
moving, eyes tight closed. Madame
shrugged her shoulders eloquently as if
to say, “Men—what worms! I ask
you,” and turned on me herself. She
led off by making some unflattering
guesses as to my past career, com-
mented forcibly on my present mode
of life, ventured a few cheerful pro-
phecies as to my hereafter and polished
off a brisk ten-minutes' heart-to-heart
talk by snapping her fingers under my
nose and threatening me with the guil-
lotine if I did not instantly remove my
man-eating horses from her barn.
“Observe,” she concluded triumph-
antly, “I have the Church and State
on my side.”
“Have you?” I queried. “Have you?
upon us.
However, by dint of en-
treaties whispered through
key-holes and persuasions
cooed under window-shut-
ters, I charmed most of
them open again and got
my troop under cover, with
the exception of one section.
Its Corporal, his cape spout-
ing like a miniature water-
shed, swam up. “There's
a likely-lookin' farm over
yonder, Sir,” said he, “but
the old gal won't let us in.
She's chattin' considera-
ble.” I found a group of
numb men and shivering
horses standing knee-deep
in a midden, the men ex-
changing repartee with a
furious female voice that
shrilled at them from a
|
Impressed Rustic Sightseer. “AY, AMos, IT MUST TAKE YEARs of
OILING AN’ COMBING TO TRAIN HAIR LIKE THAT."
Look again.”
She turned to the right
for the Mayor, but a strong
trail of straw running up
the by-way told that that
massive but inarticulate
dignitary had slunk home to
his threshing. She turned
to the left for the Curé, but
the whisk of a skirt and a
flannel shank disappear-
ing into the church-porch
showed that the discreet
clerk had side-stepped for
sanctuary. I thought it
kinder to leave Madame the
widow Palliard-Dubosc to
herself at this juncture, but
something told me I had not
heard the last of her. Nor
had I. A week later an im.
posing document was for-
warded from the orderly-
dark window. “Is that the officer ?”
the voice demanded. I admitted as
much. “Then remove your band of
brig unds. Go home to England, where
you belong, and leave respectable people
in peace. The War is finished.”
I replied with some fervour (my boots
were full of water and my cap dribbling
pints of iced-water down the back of
my neck) that I was not playing the
wandering Jew round one-horse Picard
villages in late December for the amuse-
ment I got out of it and that I could
be relied on to return to England at the
earliest opportunity, but for the present
moment would she let us in out of the
downpour, please ? The voice soared
to a scream. No, she would not, not
she. If we chose to come soldiering
we must take the consequences, she
had no sympathy for us. She called
several leading saints to witness that
her barn was full to bursting anyhow
and there was no room. That was
that. She slammed the window-shutter
saved the cleric from drifting to a
sailor's grave in the duck-pond, seemed
to be the controlling spirit of the party.
By a deſt movement to a flank she
thwarted her reluctant companions in
an attempt to escape up a by-way,
and with a nudge here and a tug there
brought them to a standstill in front of
me and opened the introductions.
“M. le Curé,” indicating the cleric,
who dropped his skirts and raised his
beaver.
“M. le Maire,” indicating corduroys,
who clutched a handful of straw out of
his beard and groaned loudly.
“Moi, je suis Madame, Veuve Pal-
liard-Dubosc,” indicating herself.
I bowed, quailing inwardly, for I
recognized the voice. She gave cor-
duroys a jab in the short ribs with her
elbow. “Eh bien, now speak.”
Corduroys rolled his eyes like a
driven bullock, sneezed a shower cf
straw and groaned again.
“Imbécile !” spat Madame disgustedly
room for my “information and necessary
action, please.” It emanated from the
French Military Mission and claimed
from me the modest sum of two thous-
and three hundred and fourteen francs
on behalf of one Madame Veuve Pal-
liard-Dubosc, of the village of Sailly-le-
Petit, Pas de Calais, the claimant alleg-
ing that my troopers had stolen un-
threshed wheat to that value where with
to feed their horses. A prompt settle-
ment would oblige.
I fled panic-stricken down to stables
and wagged the document in the faces
of the thieves. They were virtuously in-
dignant; hadn't pinched nowheat-straw
at all—not in Sailly-le-Petit. Might
have been a bit absent-minded-like at
Auchy-en-Artois, and again at Pressy-
aux-Bois mistakes may have been
made, but here never—no, Sir, s'welp-

Mission denying the impeachment.
They replied with a fresh shower of
claims. I answered with a storm of

denials. The sky snowed correspond-
ence. Just when the French were
putting it all over me and my orderly-
room was hinting that I had best pay
up and save the Entente Cordiale, the
French ran out of paper and sent one
of their missionaries in a car to settle
the matter verbally. I gave him a
good lunch, an excellent cigar and
spread all the facts of the case before
him as one human to another. He
spent an hour nosing about the village,
and the result of his investigations was
that Madame Veuve Palliard-Dubosc,
so far from having her wheat stolen,
had had no wheat to steal, and further-
more never in the course of her agri-
cultural activities had she harvested
crops to the value of Francs 2314.
Virtue triumphant. Evil vanquished.
Madame the widow Palliard - Dubosc
retired grimly into her cabin, slamming
the door on the world.
Yesterday was New Year's Day.
Imagine my surprise when, on visiting
the horses at mid-day, Madame Veuve
Palliard-Dubosc leaned over the half-
door of her dwelling and waved her
hand to me. “Ah, ha, Monsieur le
Lieutenant,” she crowed, “many felici-
tations on this most auspicious day !
Bon jour, belle année l’”
I was so staggered I treated her to
my perfecto superfino, my very best
salute (usually reserved for Generals
and Field Cashiers). “The same to you,
Madame, and many of 'em. Vive la
France 1 ''
Madame bowed and smiled with all
her features. “Vive l'Angleterre 1"
What a lot of weather we were having,
weren't we? and what a glorious vic-
tory it had been, hadn't it?—mainly due
to the dear soldiers, she felt sure. She
hoped I found myself enjoying robust
health.
I replied that I was in the pink my-
self and trusted she was the same.
Never pinker in her life, she said;
everything was perfectly lovely. She
beckoned me nearer. She had a small
favour to ask. At this season of peace
and goodwill would the so amiable
Lieutenant deign to enter her modest
abode and take a little glass of vin
blanc with her ?
The “amiable Lieutenant " would be
enchanted.
She swung the door open and bowed
me in. The glasses were already filled
and waiting on the table—a big one
for me, a little one for her.
We clicked rims and lifted our elbows
to the glorious victory, to the weather
(which was rotten) and our mutual
pinkness.
“A votre santé, mom Lieutenant 1."
crooned Madame the widow Palliard-
Dubosc.

THE END OF THE VOLUNTEERS. *
AND now the fell decree by post went out
That all the world might understand and know
How that our Volunteers henceforth must live
A quite unkhaki'd and civilian life,
Stripped of their rifles, bared of bayonets too.
Ah, many a time had we passed by to drill
And scorned the loafer who hung round to see,
The while, with accurate swift-moving feet
And hands that flashed in unison, we heard
The Sergeant-Major's voice in anger raised
Because we did not mark it as he wished;
Or uttering words of praise for them that knew
To act when rear rank got itself in front.
And ah, we knew to mount a gallant guard,
To fix our sentries, and to prime them well
With varied information that might serve
To help them in their duties and to make
Them glib and eloquent when called upon
In all the changes of this martial life.
And we could march in line and march in fours,
And bear ourselves ferociously and well
When the inspecting officer appeared.
And one great day—it was our apogee—
When volunteers for France were called upon,
A forest of accepting hands went up;
But nothing further ever came of it.
At any rate it showed a right good will
...And stamped our Volunteers as gallant stuff
To serve their country should the need arise.
And now their rifles have been ta'en away,
Their side-arms are removed, and they themselves
Are mocked in obloquy and sunk in scorn.
THE LINGUIST.
Nancy is eleven and thinks I know everything. I never
could resist or contradict her.
“Now tell me about animals in Africa,” she said. “Tell
me lots.”
This was better than usual, for I possess a heavily-
mortgaged and drought-stricken farm in some obscure
corner of that continent and have spent much time dis-
puting with beasts who refused to acknowledge my pro-
prietary claims.
So I told Nancy tales of lions that roared till the stars .
tumbled out of the sky, with fright, and, when she crept
very close to me, of the blue monkeys with funny old faces
who swung through the trees and across the river-bed to
steal my growing corn. I told her of the old ones who
led them in the advance and followed in the retreat, chat-
tering orders, and of the little babies who clung to their
mothers. I told her that monkeys elected not to talk lest
they should be made to work, but that there were a few
men living who understood their broken speech and could
hold communion with them.
She led me on with little starts and questions and—
well, I may all unwillingly have misled her as to my general
intelligence.
“We'll go to the Zoo to-morrow,” Nancy commanded,
“and you can talk to the monkeys and find out what they
think. Let's.” -
::: :: ::: ::: :: ::: :::
Nancy shook her curls and turned her back on the patient-
looking bear. -
“He's stupid,” she said. “Why can't you find the
monkeys? You know you promised.”
I suggested luncheon, but was overruled, and, on turning
a corner, read my fate in large letters on the opposite
building.
“Come on,” said Nancy, taking me by the hand.
Her first selection was very old and melancholy. He
accepted a piece of locust-bean with leisurely condescension
and watched us with quiet interest as he chewed. He
rather frightened me; the wisdom of all the ages was
behind his wrinkled eyes,
“When you were in your prison did the Germans feed
you through the bars?” Nancy asked with great clearness.
Several people in the vicinity became aware of our exist-
ence and, feeling the limelight upon me, I again mentioned
the lateness of the hour.
“Talk to him,” she said.
there.”
I treated the blinking monkey to a collection of clicks
and chuckles which would have startled even a professor
of the Bantu languages. He finished his bean and emitted
a low bird-like call. -
“What's that ?" asked Nancy.
“You see,” I said, “he's brown and comes from a dif-
ferent part of the country. It's like Englishmen and
Frenchmen. Now, if he was blue—”
“Ask that keeper,” said Nancy.
“He's very busy,” I whispered. “We oughtn't to inter-

Nancy at once ran over to the man.

The man looked at me without interest. I was an
amateur and a rival; but Nancy's smile can work wonders.

We reached the cage all too soon.
“Now talk,” Nancy ordered.
Again I went through my ridiculous performance.
monkey looked at the keeper. -
The hand which lay in mine told me that Nancy's con-
fidence was waning. I knew then how much I valued it.
“Not very well, is he?” I asked of the keeper... “A little
out of sorts—this weather, you know.” |
My reputation was in his hands, but I dared make no
sign. Nancy's eyes were on my face.
The man looked at me and then at the eager little face
below him. “Heavy cold, Sir,” he said stolidly. “Always
makes 'em a bit hard o' hearing. Poor old Topsy I Want
to be left alone, do you?”
“What a pity," said Nancy. “Mother will be sorry to
hear that the only one you could speak to was so ill and
deaf.” -
“What were you giving him 2" she asked as we walked
away.
“Only a little New Year present for his children,” I said.
“How do you know he's got any children?” Nancy
demanded. “He didn't say so, did he?”
“No, but I'm quite certain he has,” I answered.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I woNDER if I am alone in a feeling of impatience and
bewilderment over what I may call half-fairy stories.
Magic I understand and love; but this new diluted form of
it leaves me cold. Take for example the book that has
occasioned this complaint, The Curious Friends (ALLEN AND
UNwiN), an unconventional and perhaps just a little
silly tale about a secret association of children and grown-
ups, pledged to mutual help and a variety of altruistic
aims—a scheme, with all its faults, at least human and
understandable. But Miss C. J. DELAGREve has chosen to
complicate it by (apparently) a dash of the supernatural,
in the person of a character called Saint Ken, about whom
we are told that he lived in a tunnel on the Underground
and employed himself in helping distressed passengers.
Well, what I in my brutal way want to know is whether
this is a joke, or what. Because if I have to credit it, over
goes the rest of the plot into frank make-believe. And
fantasy of this kind consorts but ill with a scheme that
embraces such realities as heart-failure and typhus. Not
in any case that Miss DELAGREVE's plot could be called
exactly convincing. “Preposterous” would be the apter word
for this society of the Blue-Bean Wearers, in which vague
elderly persons wandered about with sadly self-conscious
children and talked like the dialogue in clever books. This
at least was the impression conveyed to me. I may add
that I was continually aware of a certainty that Miss
DELAGREve will do very much better when she selects a
simpler and less affected subject.
In Douglas Jerrold (Hodder AND SToughton) Mr.
WALTER JERRold has executed a pious task. He has
written the life of his grandfather, and has done it with
great enthusiasm. The work is in two volumes, one
thick and the other thin, and sometimes I cannot help
feeling that one volume, the thin one, would have been
enough. Doug LAs JERRoLD's reputation depends upon his
work in Punch and his writing of plays, of which nearly
seventy stand to his credit. To Punch he contributed from
the second number and soon became a power by means
of “Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures,” “The Story of a
Feather ” and countless other articles which suited the
taste of the public of that day. Of his work for Punch
there is only the barest mention in this book, for that story
has already been told at some length by the same author.
In the present book Mr. WALTER JERRold devotes a large
amount of space to a review of Doug LAs JERROLD's the-
atrical pieces. Where now is a five-act comedy, entitled
Bubbles of the Day, which at the time of its production
was described as “one of the wittiest and best constructed
comedies in the English language "2 I am afraid that
this comedy, and even Black-eyed Susan, JERROLD's greatest
triumph, have passed away into the limbo of forgotten
plays and can never return to us. Another drama had in
it as one of the characters “a certain cowardly English
traveller named Luckless Tramp,” a name, I should have
thought, quite sufficient in itself to swamp every possible
chance of success; yet our forefathers seem to have had
no difficulty in accommodating themselves to it.

RIDER HAGGARD tells us that his book “suggests that the
real Pharaoh of the Exodus was not Meneptah or Merenp-
tah, son of Rameses the Great, but the mysterious usurper,
Amenmeses . . .” I am not a student of Egyptology, and
in this little matter of AMENMESEs am perfectly content to
trust myself to Sir RIDER, and, provided that he tells a good
tale, to follow him wherever he chooses to lead the way.
And this story, put into the mouth of Ana, the scribe, is
packed with mystery and magic and miracles and murder.
For fear, however, that this may sound a little too exhaust-
ing for your taste, let me add that the main theme is the
love of the Crown Prince of Egypt for the Israelite, Lady
Merapi, Moon of Israel. Sir RIDER's hand has lost none of
its cunning, and, though his dialogue occasionally provokes
a smile when one feels that ITT -
seriousness is demanded, he is
here as successful as ever in
creating or, at any rate, in
reproducing atmosphere. I
hope, when you read this tale ºf
of the Pharaohs, that you will º
not find that your memory of ſº
the Book of Exodus is as faded
as I found mine to be.
Mr. CHRIstopher CULLEY,
whom you may remember for
a bustling, rather cinematic
story called Naomi of the
Mountains, has now followed
this with another, consider-
ably better. Lily of the Alley
(CAssell) is, in spite of a title
of which I cannot too strongly
disapprove, as successful a
piece of work of its own kind |
as anyone need wish for, show-
ing the author to have made ||
a notable advance in his art.
Again the setting is Wild West,
on the Mexican border, the
theme of the tale being the
outrages inflicted upon Ameri-
can citizens by VILLA, and
what seemed then the be-
wildering delay of Washington
over the vindication of the flag.
The “Alley” of its unfortunate
name is the slum in Kansas
City where Dave, stranded on
his way westward, met the
girl to whom the laws of
fiction were inevitably to join
him. I fancy that one of Mr. CULLEY's difficulties may
have lain in the fact that when the tale, following Dave,
had finally shaken itself from the dust of cities, the
need for feminine society was conspicuously less urgent.
Even after a rescued and refreshed Lily is brought up-
country, she is kept, so to speak, as long as possible at
the base, and only arrives on the actual scene of Dave's
activities in time to be bustled hurriedly out of the way of
the final (and wonderfully thrilling) chapters. The explana-
tion is, I think, that the cowboy, whom he knows so well,
is for Mr. CULLEY hero and heroine too. Dave, round
whom the story revolves, is a pleasant study of a type of
American youth which we are coming gratefully to estimate
at its true worth; but in the development of the theme
Dave soon becomes almost insignificant beside the greater
figure of the cowboy, Monte Latarette. For him alone I

should regard the book as one not to be missed by anyone
who values a handling of character at once delicate and
masterful.
Keeling Letters and Recollections (ALLEN AND UNwiN) is
a book that will perhaps rouse varied emotions in those
who read it. Regret there will be for so much youth and
intellectual vigour sacrificed; admiration for courage and
for a patriotism that circumstances made by no means the
simple matter of conviction that it has been for most; and
vehement opposition to many of the views (on the War
especially) held by the subject of the memoir. By sympathy
and environment KEELING was, to begin with, a whole-
hearted admirer of Germany. Strangely, in one of his
- Tº social views, he carried this
admiration even to the extent of
advocating a Teutonic control
that should include Holland.
To such a mind the outbreak
of war with Germany may well
have seemed the last horror.
But he admitted no choice.
Within a few days he was a
private soldier; he was killed,
as sergeant-major, while bomb-
ing a trench on August 18,
1916. The spirit in which he
entered the War is shown in
an extract from a letter: “What
we have got to do in the in-
terest of Europe is to fight Ger-
many without passion, with
respect.” How grimly those
last two words sound now !
Through everything KEELING
held with a generous obstinacy
to his original prejudices. Ger-
many remained most tragically
his second fatherland. Some
where he writes, “I expect 1
shall be a stronger Pacifist
after the war than any of the
people who are Pacifists now.
But I don't feel one will have
earned the right to be one
unless one has gone in with
the rest.” The italics are
mine. Before a vindication
so unanswerable criticism has
no further word to say.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GETTING OUT.
“If you belong to any of the fol-
lowing classes,” said the Demobilisa-
tion advertisement, “do nothing.” So
Lieut. William Smith did nothing.
After doing nothing for some weeks
he met a friend who said, “Hallo,
aren't you out yet?”
“Not yet,” said William, looking at ||
his spurs. - -
“Well, you ought to do something.”
So Lieut. William Smith decided to
do something. He was a pivotal-man.
and a slip-man and a one-man-business
and a twenty-eight-days-in-hospital
man and a W.O. letter ZXY/999 man.
Accordingly he wrote to the War Office
and told them so. - . . -
It was, of course, a little confusing
for the authorities. Just as they began
to see their way to getting him out as
a pivotal man, somebody would decide
that it was quicker to demobilise him
as a one-man-business; and when this
was nearly done, then somebody else
would point out that it was really
much neater to reinstate him as a
slip-man. Whereupon a sub-section,
just getting to work at W.O. letter
ZXY/999, would beg to be allowed
a little practice on William while he
was still available, to the great dis-
gust of the medical authorities, who had
been hoping to study the symptoms
of self-demobilisation in Lieut. Smith
as evidenced after twenty-eight days'
in hospital.
Naturally, then, when another friend
met William a month later and sáid,
“Hallo, aren't you out yet?” William
could only look at his spurs again and
say, “Not yet.”
“Better go to the War Office and
have a talk with somebody,” said his
friend. “Much the quickest.” -
So William went to the War Office.
First he had a talk with a policeman,
and then he had a talk with a porter,
and then he had a talk with an attend-
ant, and then he had a talk with a
messenger girl, and so finally he came
to the end of a long queue of officers
who were waiting to have a talk with
somebody.
“Not so many here to-day as yes-
terday,” said a friendly Captain in the
Suffolks who was next to him.
“Oh l’” said William. “And we've
got an army on the Rhine too,” he
murmured to himself, realising for the
first time the extent of England's effort.
At the end of an hour he calculated
that he was within two or three hundred
of the door. He had only lately come
out of hospital and was beginning to
feel rather weak.
“I shall have to give it up,” he said.
The Captain tried to encourage him
with tales of gallantry. There was a
Lieutenant in the Manchesters who
had worked his way up on three occa-
sions to within fifty of the door, at
which point he had collapsed each
time from exhaustion; whereupon two
kindly policemen had carried him to
the end of the queue again for air . . .
He was still sticking to it.
“I suppose there's no chance of
being carried to the front of the queue 2"
said William hopefully. *
“No,” said the Captain firmly; “we
should see to that.”
“Then I shall have to go,” said
William. “See you to-morrow.” And
as he left his place the queue behind
him surged forward an inch and took |
new courage.
A week later William suddenly re-
membered Jones. Jones had been in
the War Office a long time. It was
said of him that you could take him to
any room in the building and he could
find his way out into Whitehall in less
than twenty minutes. But then he
was no mere “temporary civil-servant.”
He had been the author of that famous
W.O. letter referring to Chevrons for
Cold Shoers which was responsible for
the capture of Badajoz; he had issued
the celebrated Army Council Instruc-
tion, “Commanding Officers are re-
quested to replace the pivots,” which
had demobilised MARLBoRough's army
so speedily; and, as is well known,
HENRY V. had often said that without
Jones—well, anyhow, he had been in
the War Office a long time. And
William knew him slightly.
So William sent up his card.
“I want to talk to somebody,” he
explained to Jones. “I can't manage
more than a couple of hours a day in
the queue just now, because. I'm not
very fit. If I could sit down some-
where and tell somebody all about my-
self, that's what I want. Any room
in the building where there are no
queues outside and two chairs inside.
I'd be very much obliged to you.”
“I’ll give you a note to Briggs,”
said Jones promptly. “He’s the fellow
to get you out.” ~ -
“Thanks awfully,” said
joyed William.
A messenger girl took him and the
note to Captain Briggs. Briggs listened
to the story of William's qualifications
—or rather disqualifications—and con-
sidered for a moment.
“Yes, we ought to get you out very
quickly,” he said.
“Good,” said William.

“Walters will tell you just what to do.
He 's a pal of mine. I'll give you a
note to him.”
So in another minute the overjoyed

“Thanks
William was following a messenger girl
to the room of Lieutenant Walters.
Walters was very cheerful. The
thing to do, he said, was to go to
Sanders. Sanders would get him out
in half-an-hour. He'd give William a
note, and then Sanders would do his
best. The overjoyed William followed
the messenger girl to Sanders.
“That's all right,” said Sanders a few
minutes later. “We can get you out at
once on this. Do you know Briggs?”
“Briggs,” said William, with a sud-
den sinking feeling. -
“I’ll give you a note to him. He
knows all about it. He'll get you out
at once.” - - -
“Thank you,” said William faintly.
He put the note in his pocket and
strode briskly out in search of the dear
old queue. -
“It will be quicker after all,” he told
himself, as he took his place at the
end of the queue next to a Lieutenant
in the Manchesters. (“Don’t crowd
him,” said a policeman to William ;
“he wants air.”) -
::: ::: - :: º:k :
And you think perhaps that the story
ends here, with William in the queue
again? Oh, no. William is a man
of resource. The very next day he met
another friend, who said, “Hallo, aren't
you out yet?” - -
“Not yet,” said William. -
“My boy got out a month ago.”
“H-h-h-how 2 ” said William.
“Ah well, you see, he's going up to
Cambridge. Complete his education |
and all the rest of it. They let 'em out
at once on that.” -
“Ah!” said William thoughtfully.
William is thirty-eight, but he has
taken the great decision. He is going
up to Cambridge next term. He thinks
it will be quicker. He no longer stands
in the queue for two hours every day;
he spends the time instead studying
for his Little Go. A. A. M.

THE MINISTERIAL TREADMILL,
(Being a free résumé of Lord CURzoN's
speech at the Eccentric Club on Wed-
nesday the 22nd.)
LoRD CURzoN rises with the lark—
That is (at present) when it's dark—
Breakfasts in haste on tea and toast,
Then grapples with the early post,
And reads the newspapers, which shed
Denunciation on his head.
Having digested their vagaries
He calls his faithful secretaries
And keeps them writing, sheet on sheet,
Until he's due in Downing Street.
The Cabinet is seldom through
Until the clock is striking two,
When Ministers, dispersing, munch
Their frugal sandwiches for lunch.
Then back into affairs of State
Again they plunge from three till eight,
Presiding, guiding, interviewing,
Tea conscientiously eschewing,
Until exhausted nature cries
At half-past eight for more supplies.
Another hasty meal is snatched
And, when the viands are despatched,
Once more our admirable Crichton,
Though feeling like a weary Titan,
Resumes the toil of brain and pen
Till two is sounded by Big Ben.
:: :k ::: ::: :k
The life of those whom duty spurs on
To lead laborious days, like CURzoN,
Is not the life of BILLY MERSON
Or any gay inferior person.
R US IN URBE.
THE Selborne Society, which used to
be a purely rural expeditionary force,
has lately taken to exploring London,
and personally-conducted tours have
been arranged to University College in
darkest Gower Street, where Sir PHILIP
MAGNUs and Sir GREgory FostER will
act as guides, and to the Royal Courts of
Justice, where Sir Edward MARSHALL
HALL, K.C., “will describe the methods
of conducting civil actions.” What
GILBERT WHITE would say to all this
brick-and-mortar sophistication we do
not dare to guess. All that we venture
to do is to suggest one or two more
urbane adventures.
Why, for example, should not a visit
be paid to the House of Lords, under
the direction of the new Lord CHAN-
CELLCR 2 Five minutes spent on the
Woolsack in such company not only
would be a treasured memory, but a
liberal (or, at any rate, a coalition)
education. After such an experience
all the Selbornians should come away
better fitted to climb the ascents which
life offers.
Again, if Sir HoRACE MARSHALL, the
Lord Mayor, invited the Society to the
Mansion House they might be enor-
mously benefited. Of turtle doves they
naturally know all; GILBERT WHITE
would have seen to that ; but what do
they know of turtle soup 2 Well, the
LORD MAYor would instruct them. He
would show them the pools under the
Mansion House where these creatures
luxuriate while awaiting their doom ;
he would indicate the areas beneath the
shell from some of which is extracted
the calipash and from some the cali-
pee; he might even induce the Most
Worshipful Keeper of the Turtles,
O.B.E., to discourse on the subject.
Then there is New Scotland Yard.
It would be a scandal for the members
of the Selborne Society not to visit
that home of amity and see all the
New Scots at work in tracking down
the breakers of the laws that are made
in the picturesque building with the
clock tower so close by. And not
very distant is the War Office, where
mobilisation-while-you-wait may be
studied at first hand, we don't think.
Indeed, London offers such oppor-
tunities that we shall be surprised if
the Selborne Society ever looks at a
mole or a starling again.
THE ROAD TO THE RHINE.
BUSINEss LEAVE.
OF course we know demobilisation
is proceeding apace. We know that
piyotal men are simply pirouetting to
Dngland in countless droves. We know
it because we see it in the papers (when
they come), and it is a great source of
comfort to us. But since it is six days'
train journey and four days' lorry-
hopping from where we sit guarding
the wrong side of the river to the
necessary seaport, perhaps they have
forgotten us, or they are keeping all the
pivots in this area for one final orgy of
demobilisation at some future date,
which for the moment I am not at
liberty to disclose.
At present my poor friend Cook is
sitting in the Company Mess with his
thoughts all of the inside of Army
prisons, instead of the glowing pictures
he used to have of himself exchanging
his battle-bowler for the headgear of
civilisation. He says I'm responsible
for his state of mind, because I first
put the idea into his head. Well, I
did ; but I don't see how you can blame
the fellow who filled the shell if some
silly ass hits it on the nose-cap with a
hammer. .
It started like this. After the De-
mobilisation General Post had sounded
Cook spent his time writing to every-
body who did not know him well
enough to down his chances, filled up
all the forms in triplicate and packed
his valise ready to start off any time of
the day or night for England, home and
wholesale hardware, which is his par- |
ticular pivot. I may say here that
nominally this business is run by him
and his brother, and the fact that they
are now both in the Army is probably
the chief reason why the manager in
charge is able to make the business
pay. However, you know what people
are; if they draw receipts from a busi-
ness nothing will persuade them but
that they must be there, “on the spot
you know,” to “look after it.” So,
seeing his face grow longer and longer as
the days went by without the Quarter-
Master coming round and handing him
his ration trilby hat, civvy suit and
the swagger cane he hopes for, I said,
“Why don't you put in for two months'
business leave?”
The air was at once rent with a fear-
ful rush of leaves of his A.B. 153, and
he ceased to take any interest in his
platoon from that moment.
urged upon him the consummate folly
of neglecting to inquire moreclosely into
the case of a reprobate in No. 11 Platoon
who had so far forgotten all sense of
discipline as to set out his kit with
haversack on the leſt instead of the
right (or vice-versi, I forget which, but
the Sergeant-Major spotted it). He
even went the length of saying he
didn't care a cuss; and when I asked
him sarcastically if he had forgotten
the Platoon Commander's pamphlet-
bible, “Am I offensive enough 7" he
said he thought he was, and I agreed
with him.
When the whole mess-room was
simply a-flutter with torn-out leaves
from his A.B. 153, representing his
abortive attempts to put down his ap-
plication succinctly and plausibly, we
all began to take an interest in his case.
We crowded round and offered him
most valuable hints. Together we got
through two very pleasant evenings
and three or four A.B.'s 153, and still
the application remained in a tentative
state. We got on all right to start
with, but it was after the “I have the
honour to submit for the approval and
recommendation of the Commanding
Officer this my application for two
months' business leave " that we got
stuck. .
Of course I knew it was no use, any-
way. I have seen these things go
forward before. They have no chance.
It was then that a stroke of genius
(unfortunate, as it turned out, but a
stroke of genius nevertheless) occurred
to me. “Why not say that your
manager is a complete fool and in his
hands the business is going to rack and
ruin 2'' I said. He bit at it like a tiger,
and only the law of libel prevented him
putting it into execution there and then;
In vain I ||

but all the same we had a jolly fine
argument (six of us) about it for some
three hours, and nobody got put out of
the room for introducing acrimony into
the discussion.
Finally, he said that he was sure his
brother wouldn't mind his saying it
about him, and the application went in
as follows:—
To Adjutant, First Crackshire Regt.
SIR,--I have the honour to submit
for the approval and recommendation
of the Commanding Officer this my
application for two months' business
leave in the following special circum-
stances:— -
The necessity of my presence in the
business (wholesale hardware) has be-
come more and more urgent of late.
It is imperative that I should get home
at once owing to the total incapability
of my partner to carry out simple direc-
tions which are dictated by letters, and
it is no exaggeration to say that the
business, which has been built up
almost entirely by my efforts, must
inevitably collapse unless it receives
my personal attention at once.
My address would be, etc., etc.,
London. I am, Sir, . .
Your obedient Servant, etc., etc.
The Adjutant l oved serious when
he read it. So did Cook, for he thought
the Adjutant had noted the London
address and had remembered the busi-
ness was in Bristol. But it was all right.
It wasn't that at all really. Pencil
and squared paper are poor means of
conveying information at any time, and
when the Adjutant had been assured
that the business was really “whole-
sale hardware,” and not “wholesale
hardbake,” as he had first read it, every-
thing went swimmingly. The C.O.
signed it and off it went on its moment-
ous journey. Cook began to take a
renewed interest in his platoon, and,
having discovered the recalcitrant one
of No. 11 actually coming on parade
with only the front of the tip of his
bayonet-scabbard polished, he took a
fiendish delight in seeing the criminal
writhing under the brutal and savage
sentence of three days' C.B.
A week later he got a great surprise.
His brother-partner turned up with a
draft of men and found himself posted
to the battalion. The brothers met, as
only brothers can, with the words,
“What the deuce are you doing here?”
Highly elated, Cook told him about
the application for business leave and
gloated over his chances of being home
first, and on full pay too. His brother
was intensely amused, and they both
laughed heartily when he told us that
he himself, while waiting at the recep-
tion-camp with the draft, had put in
much the same kind of application,
saying the same kind of things about
Cook.
But when they realised that both
applications would be forwarded to
the same Divisional Headquarters for
consideration the joke lost some of
its savour. And when the Adjutant
called them up and handed the two
returned applications pinned together
both brothers needed all their qualities
of toughness and rigidity which, as I
understand, are acquired in the whole-
sale hardware business. L.

On the humped bandage that replaced the limb,
A tiny green glass pig to comfort him.

TEACHING TOMMY.
HERE is a simple method of aiding the
admirable efforts of educational Staff-
Officers in the army.
Let all Regimental Orders be inter-
spersed with items of information likely
to be of use in civilian life. Thus:–
53. . . . will be rendered to this
office, in triplicate, by noon to-morrow.
53A. Etiquette, Points of. It is not
considered correct to address an Arch-
bishop as “Archie” unless one is on
terms of considerable intimacy with
him. In writing to a Duchess never
commit the vulgar error of putting a
stamp on the envelope; the sixth foot-
man in a ducal household is always
provided with a fund in respect of
unpaid postage on incoming correspon-
dence. -
54. . . . is placed out of bounds to
all troops on account of an outbreak
of mumps.
5 [A. Data, Geographical.—Of all fish
those of the Bay of Biscay are perhaps
the best nourished. An isthmus is a
piece of land which saves another piece
of land from being an island. The prin-
cipal exports of Germany are prisoners
of war.
55. . . . to be read on three con-
secutive parades. -
55A. Theory, Untenable, Literary.—
The theory that BAcox was a pork-
butcher and derived inspiration for
Hamlet by gazing at the viands in his
shop has now been disproved.
56. . . . and a sum of twopence per
haircut will be chargeable against public
funds.
56A. Courts, Foreign.—The Sultan of
Socotra is entitled to a salute of four-
teen popguns and one catapult. Before
approaching the throne of the Duke of
the Djibouti one is required to take
lessons from the Court Contortionist.
57. . . . and Company Commanders
are reminded of their responsibility in
this matter.
57A. World, the Animal.—It is inter-
esting to know that the inventor of
the Tank first planned that engine of
warfare while watching the peregrina-
tions of the armadillo at a travelling
menagerie. The efficacy of our blockade
was such that large consignments of
armadillo-fodder were prevented from
reaching Germany, the consequent
demise of all German-kept armadilloes
thus robbing our enemy of the oppor-
tunity of devising a similar instrument.
58. . . . will parade in full marching
order at Reveille.
58A. Facts, Historical.—There once
was a king who never smiled again,
but history might have recorded a
different verdict had His Majesty wit-
nessed the spectacle of the Second-in-
HIS STOCK-IN-TRADE.
Tramp. “CAN YOU SPARE A FoEE old GENTLEMAN THE PRICE of A cup of KoRFEE,
SIR.?”
Sub. (in high spirits). “RIGHT-o.
SHAVE AND A HAIR-CUT AS WELL.”
Tramp. “WILL YER.? THEN WHO's A-GoIN' To KEEP ME while MY AIR AN' BEARD
GROWS AGAIN ?”
ALL THE COFFEE YOU WANT AND THE PRICE of A
Command, on a frisky horse, trying to
drill the Battalion.
59. . . . will therefore immediately
submit rolls of all skilled organ-blowers
of Category B ii.
59A. Information, General.—If all
the Treasury Notes circulated in the
United Kingdom since 1914 were placed
end to end they might reach from
Bristol to Yokohama and back, but
they would not constitute a sufficient
inducement to a London taxi-driver.
60. . . . and this practice must cease
forth with.
60A. Query, Our Daily.—What is
Popocatapetl 2 Is it an indoor game,
a cannibal tribe, a curative herb, or
neither ? Solutions are invited.
There are two very advantageous
points about this scheme: (1) The in-
genious system of numbering would
avoid interference with army routine,
which must go on; and (2) men might
be encouraged to read Regimental
Orders.
This suggestion is made without
hope of fee or reward. Its author does
not even ask for extra duty pay.

[JANUARY 29, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FINE EAR FOR THE HASPIRATE.
“I wish as 'ow I warn’t married.”
Mr. Punt crooned out the impious
aspiration as he sorted a judicious
modicum of hemp into the canary seed.
He spoke in semi-soliloquy, yet quite
loud enough to reach the vigilant ear
of Mrs. Punt, who was dusting the
cages at the other end of the live-stock
store. She said nothing in reply, but
her eye fixed itself upon him with a
glint eloquent of what she might say
later.
“Why is that, Mr. Punt?” I asked
encouragingly. +
“Why, it's on'y to-day, Sir, as I met
a lidy, a widder lidy, friend o' Uncle
George's down Putney way, as 'as one
leg, a nice little bit o' 'ouse property
and two great hauk's eggs.”
It did seem a rare combination of
marriageable qualities. I asked the
value of a great auk's egg, and was
surprised to learn that a specimen had
recently been sold at auction for some-
thing like three hundred pounds. I
inquired whether all the great auks'
eggs that came on the market were
genuine, or whether “faked" speci-
mens were to be met with. I had
heard, I thought, of “faked.” eagles'
eggs. -
“Different kind o' bird altogether,
Sir, and different kind o' egg. Can't
very well be imitated. You didn't
think as I said great 'awk, Sir?” he
asked very anxiously.
“No, no; I understand,” I hastened
to assure him.
“The 'awk, Sir, is a bird o' the
heagle kind; the hauk’s a different
kind altogether—web-footed, aquatic—
was, I should rather say, seeing as
'ow 'e's unappily extinct. Hauk and
'awk, Sir—you take the difference?”
I said that I thought the distinction
was perceptible to a fine ear for the
aspirate.
The phrase took the little man's fancy
wonderfully. “That's it, Sir,” he ex-
claimed, beaming up delightedly at me.
“You’ve 'it it! Done it in one, you
'ave. “Fine ear for the haspirate'—
that's what my darter Maria 'ave and
what I, for one, 'ave not. I'm not
above confessing of it; 'tain't given to all
of us to 'ave everything, as the ant said
to the helephant when 'e was boasting
about 'is trunk. Some there is as ain't
got no ear for music—same as Joe
Mangles, the grocer down the street, as
'as caught a heavy cold in 'is 'ead with
taking is 'at off every time as 'e 'ears
.' It's a long long way to Tipperary.'
Why, I've knowed men,” said Mr.
Punt, in the manner of one who works
himself up to an almost incredible cli-
max—“I’ve knowed men as couldn't
tell the difference between a linnet's
note and a goldfinch.”
“Astonishing,” I said.
One of the canaries suddenly broke
into a rich trill of song, as if to add his
personal expression of surprise.
“Now there!” Mr. Punt exclaimed,
shaking a podgy forefinger at him.
“There's the bird as give all the trouble
and cause words 'tween me and Maria,
'e did. 'Artz Mountain roller, that
bird is. Beeutiful 'is note, ain't it,
Sir 2'' * .
There really was a deep full tone,
distantly suggestive of a nightingale's,
that favourably distinguished the bird's
song from the canary's usual acute
treble. . . . . . . . - *
“‘I'm doubting, Maria,' I say to
'er,” Mr. Punt resumed. “No longer
ago than this very morning I say it—
‘I'm doubting whether I did ought to
call that 'ere bird a 'Artz Mountain
roller,' I say to 'er—me meaning, o'
course, as the 'Artz Mountains being,
as some thinks, in Germany, that pus-
sons wouldn't so much as go to look at
a canary as called 'isself a 'Artz Moun-
tain bird, as it might be a German bird,
for all as 'e'd never a-bin no nearer Ger-
many than the Royal Road, Chelsea,
not never since 'e chip is little shell,
'e 'aven't.
“So I ask 'er the question, doubting
like, and she up and say, all saucy as a
jay-bird, ‘Why, certainly you didn't
ought to call 'im so,' she say.
“‘Question is, Maria,' I says, ‘in
that case what did I ought to call 'im?’
“‘And I can tell yer that too, Dad,'
she say—Maria did. “You didn't ought
to call 'im 'Artz Mountain roller, but
ha-Hartz Mountain roller. That's the
way to call 'im,' she says—impident
little 'ussy' But there—what's in a
name, as the white blackbird said when
'e sat on a wooden milestone eating a
red blackberry? Still,'e weren't running
a live-stock emporium, I expect, when
'e ask such a question as that 'ere.
There's a good deal in 'ow you call a
bird, or a dawg or a guinea-pig neither,
if you want to pass 'im on to a cus-
tomer in a honest way o' trade.”
t assured Mr. Punt I had not a doubt
of it. * -
“But I shall be a-practisin' my
haitches, Sir,” he promised me, as I
went out with the canary seed which I
had called to purchase—“practise 'em
'ard, I shall. It's what I ain't a-got at
the present moment—‘a fine ear for the
haspirate.' Beeutiful expression that,
Sir, if you'll excuse me sayin' so. But
I don't see no reason as a man mightn't
'ope to acquire it, 'im practising con-
stant and careful—same as a pusson
can learn a bullfinch to pipe ‘’Ome,
sweet 'Ome.' That haitch is a funny
letter, but it's a letter as I shall prac-
tise. Still, haitches or no haitches,”
he concluded, with a profound sigh, “I
wish as I knowed 'ow I could set
about coming it over that 'ere one-
legged widder lidy at Putney what
'ave the two great hauk's eggs.”
Out of the dusty twilight in the far
end of the shop Mrs. Punt's eye
gleamed balefully.
BLIGHTY IMPRESSIONS.
THE BARBER. -
I west into a tobacco-shop, tendered
a pound note and asked for a packet
of cigarettes and a box of matches.
| With much regret and a smiling face,
she informed me she had the goods but
no change. * -- * -
- What a dilemma / A shop with
cigarettes and matches, but I couldn't
spare a pound note for them.
An inspiration'—I would go into the
hairdressing establishment behind the
shop, have a shave—which I really
didn't need—obtain change and make
my purchase. Besides, with so many
barbers closed owing to the strike, it
was an opportunity.
This is what happened.
. “Good morning, S.r.
next but six.”
A long, long interval.
“Shave, Sir 2 Lovely weather we're
having. Razor all right, Sir?”
I said as little as possible; it is the
only safe thing.
“Face massage, Sir?”
“No, thanks,” I mumbled.
“Wonderful thing for the face, Sir;
make a new man of you. Invigorates
the circulation, improves the com-
plexion
“Oh, all right,” I gasped.
And then for about twenty minutes
snatches of conversation floated to me
through bundles of wet towels. My
head was having a Turkish bath. My
face was covered with ointments and
creams. Currents of electricity played
about my brow.
“Just trim your hair, Sir?”
I swear I said “No,” but before I
knew what was happening the scissors
were running merrily over my head.
“Singeing, Sir?”
“Er—no. I—”
“Finest thing in the world, Sir. It's
a treat to see hair like this. Just a bit
‘endy,' but singeing will soon put that
right.” . .
"Even had I been blind I should have
discovered that I was undergoing the
process. -
“What would you like for the sham-
poo, Sir? Eau de Quinine—Violet * -
“I don't think—”
My feeble protest was cut short.

“MoTHER, I HAVE BEEN GOOD TO-DAY-SO PATIENT WITH NURSE.”
“I always recommend Violet,” he
said, sprinkling my head profusely.
More rubbing, more towels, more
electricity and finally a brush and
comb.
“I’ve a hair-lotion here, Sir –
“No, thank you.”
I meant it.
He helped me on with my coat,
brushed off a deal of imaginary dust,
said something about skin softeners
and bath requisites, but I'd had enough
for one morning, and I was yearning to
get those cigarettes and have a smoke.
I tendered my pound note.
He took it, and with his best smile
said—
“Another sixpence, Sir, please.”
BLIMP
THERE are many things Dora kept
dark
That she's now letting into the light,
And to-day an astounding aerial barque
Has suddenly sailed into sight;
But its past makes no sympathies
burn,
And its future leaves interest limp,
Compared with the rapture I feel when
I learn -
That its name is the Blimp.
Who gave it its title, and why? .
Was it old Edward LEAR from the
grave?
Since Jumblies in Blimps would be
certain to fly -
When for air they abandon the wave.
Was it dear LEwis CARRoll, perhaps
Sent his phantom to christen the
barque,
Since a Blimp is the obvious vessel for
chaps
When hunting a snark?
And to-day, in the first-fruits of joy,
I scarcely believe it is true
That Blimp is a word we shall one day
employ
As lightly as now Bakerloo;
And my reason refuses to jump
To the fact that a man, not an imp,
Can flash through the ether and land
with a bump
From a trip in a Blimp.
“It needs novery profound knowledge of the
politics of South-Western Europe to surmise
that neither Rumania nor Greece would lend
military assistance of this kind without being
promised something in return.”

But a rather more profound knowledge
of the geography might be useful.
THE OLD INVINCIBLE,
It is late in the day to draw attention
to Mr. Punch as a prophet. Everyone
knows that his eyes have always dis-
cerned the farthest horizon. None the
less it is pleasant now and again to
succumb to the temptation of saying
“I told you so,” and especially when
it is the finger of a friendly reader that
points the way to the Sage's triumph.
past numbers, as many of our con-
temporaries do, we should print the
following paragraph from the issue of
September 2nd, 1871:—
“A REAL DANGER.
“According to Le Havre, about forty Prussian
officers in mufti leave Dieppe every morning for
England, their object being to visit the military
establishments of Great Britain." -
Here at last is an actual invasion | Prussian
officers landing on our defenceless shores, on
the transparently flimsy pretext of making
themselves acquainted with our military esta-
blishments, at the rate (excluding Sundays)
of 240 a week, or in this present September, of
1,080 a month, or, amazing and terrifying
total, of 12,520 a year ! We commend this
startling announcement to the attention of
the Cabinet (Parliament, unfortunately, is not
sitting), the Commander-in-Chief, the War
Office, the Commanders of all Volunteer Corps,
the Author of “The Battle of Dorking,” Ser-
geant Blower, and Cheeks the Marine.”

This intelligence is of particular
interest in that it conveys an admission

FATHER THAMES TALKS.
ONE day last week, it might be Wed-

A day not yet entirely dead,
A shortly-doomed-to-die day,
The Naiad who lay stretched in dream
Awoke and gave a shiver—
The Naiad who has charge of stream
And rivulet and river.
I had intended to write the whole of this article in verse,
of which the above is a shocking sample, but, on the whole,
I think I will go on in prose. When you have committed
yourself to double rhymes, prose is the easier medium. In
verse it is more difficult to stick to your subject, and as the
subject in this case is a very important one and deserves
to be stuck to, I shall do the rest in prose.
Anyhow, the fact is that I have read a paragraph in one
of the papers about a proposed revival of rowing. Rowing,
like other sports, has, it seems, lain dormant for the past
four years and a half. From the moment in 1914 when
war was declared it suffered a land-change; shorts and
zephyr and blazer and sweater were abandoned at once,
and, for the oarsman as for everybody else, khaki became
the only wear. Already trained by long discipline to obey,
our oarsmen trooped to the colours, and wherever hard fight-
ing was to be done their shining names are to be found
on the muster-roll of fame. Some will return to us, but for
others there waited the eternum exitium cymbac—a very
different craft from those to which they were accustomed,
but they accepted it with pride and without a murmur.
Bearing these things in mind, I went to Henley last
week to interview Father Thames. I found the veteran
totally unchanged in his quarters on the Temple Island,
and immediately began the interview. -
“Dull?” he said. “I believe you, my boy. But they
tell me there's talk of reviving the regatta. You tell them
with my compliments not to be in too great a hurry about
it. Think of what Henley meant to the lads who rowed.
They hadn't learnt their skill in a day—no, nor in as many
days as go to a year.”
“Do you then,” I said, “consider the regatta only from
the oarsman's point of view 2"
“Really,” said the old gentleman, “there's no other.
Not but what,” he added with a chuckle, “it gave them
more pleasure to row their races with lots of pretty faces to
look on. Lor' bless you, I don't object to 'em. It's the
prettiest scene in the world when the sun shines as it
sometimes does. And that's enough talking for one after-
noon.” With that he plunged, and nothing I did could
bring him to the surface again.

before Colin drifts off the horizon and
shows a peaked face with haunting
eyes over George's shoulder. Colin
does not speak. That is not his métier.
He is the star shell illuminating the
position; and usually in about six
minutes' time it is safe for John to put
in an appearance with the kit.
This is the recognised procedure, and
it has served us indifferently well up
and down three years of war and a
good deal of France and Flanders.
Therefore John was not to blame when,
after waiting the scheduled six minutes,
he arrived to find the other two still
in the thick of it. Either Colin was
not haunting up to form (which was
likely, as he had been over-fed lately)
or George's French (which was never
made in the place where they make
marriages) had scandalised Madame.
She stood in the door like some his-
torical personage, probably the Sphinx,
and repeated a guttural kind of incan-
tation while George stretched his ears
until they stood out more than usual
in a struggle to understand.
“Rotten patois some of these people
speak,” he said. “I believe she has a
room, though something's biting her.
Likely enough Fritz went off with all
her furniture; but I've already ex-
plained twenty times that that doesn't
matter. Écoutez, Madame. We only

“Beds!” Madame pounced on the
word. “C'est cela / No beds, Mon-

“Ah, now we know where we are.”
George looked round triumphantly.
“Ecoutez, Madame. We don't want
beds. Nous les desirons jamais. We
have them. Trois lits. We don't want
them. We have beds. Comprenez?”
“No beds,” explained Madamè firmly.

plunged again into the maelstrom, and
a pretty girl appeared from the firelit
room behind to stir him to his highest
flights of eloquence. A smell of savoury
cooking came also, and out in the street
night shut down dark and chill and

John let part of the kit down on the
door-sill. "It was his way of explaining

“No beds,” she said.
The pretty girl smiled in a troubled
way and murmured something in a soft
voice. -
“She says they haven't got any beds
in the rooms. Fritz took them all,”
interpreted George. “Ecoutez, Made-
moiselle. We have beds. Trois lis.

Mademoiselle looked at Madame with
a kink of her pretty brows. Madame
rose like a balloon to the need.
“No beds,” she said very distinctly,
with a rounding of eyes and mouth.
“No beds, Messieurs. No-o-o-beds.”
Before George could recover John
interfered. He makes a hobby of cut-
ting Gordian knots. .
“Oh, what's the earthly use of
cried Mademoiselle, retreating in haste.
“No beds,” repeated Madame, uncon-
vinced and unafraid.
“She means that she doesn't want
to have us,” said John in cold despair.
“She'd be a fool if she did now,”
answered Colin grimly. “Let's get
out of this.”
And then John had a third brain-
wave. He ordered George on guard,
and descended with Colin in search of
the concrete proof of our sanity. And
Madame's voice, faint yet spursuing,
followed us down.
“No beds,” it said.
In ten minutes we were back trium-
phant with the three stretchers. It
was a full six months, since we had
written to England for them, and they
had come at last. Visions of rest went
THE WAR-DOG'S PARTY.
(Continued.)
I ExPECTED, of course, when I de-
idlared the resolution, “Dogs not Door-
mats,” open for general discussion that
there would be some pretty plain bark-
ing, but nothing calling for the inter-
vention of the Chair. Britain's dogs
are sound at heart, even if they do talk
a bit wildly about the Tyranny of Man
and Rabbitism and Abolishing the Bis-
cuiteer. I don't agree with a lot of it
myself—we Airedales have always been
conservatively inclined; but I am bound
to say that three years in the Army
open one's eyes to a lot of things.
Nothing of a really seditious charac-
ter was said until the Borzoi com-
menced to address the meeting. I

think we can't under-
stand. Let's go up and
take the rooms if they're
decent. Then we'll get
the stretchers and put
'em up. That's the only
sort of argument we can
handle.”
Manfully George went
to work again. And re-
luctant, and yet obviously
fascinated by his French,
like a bird by a ake,
Mademoiselle led up the
narrow stairs and into a
sizeable room, clean as a
pin and as naked. On
the threshold Madame
washed her hands of
hope.
“Regardez / No beds. C'estaffreuz 1"
George began again. He had courage.
Whatever else Nature and luck denied
him there was no question of that.
For a little it looked as though he were
in sight of the goal. Then Mademoiselle
explained. They were désolées, but the
sales Boches had stolen all the beds, and
Madame would not let the bare rooms
to Messieurs les Anglais. It would not
be convenable when they had no beds.
“No beds!” Madame appealed to
the skylight as witness, and we looked
at each other. It was getting late and
the others would have rustled all the
best bivvies by now. John had another
brain-wave.
“Let's pantomime it. They always
understand pantomime. There's no use
saying we've got beds — not when
George has to say it. We'll show
them.” -
Earnestly we pantomimed stretcher

eyes of Madame and Mademoiselle and
several more Madames who had col-
lected as unobtrusively as a silk hat

ings, ripped them off and disclosed—

We did not attempt to meet the
situation. We left it to the devil—or
Madame. And she, with the lofty
serenity of one who through long and
grievous misunderstanding has won
home at last, was completely adequate.

But, to do old LIEBKNEcht justice, it
was the son, not the father, who spelt
it that way,
had always disliked the
fellow and half suspected
him of being an An-
archist or the president
of some brotherhood or
other. (It's funny how
these rascals, whose one
idea is to get something
which belongs to some-

|ing for it, always call
themselves a brother-
hood.) But those Rus-
|sian dogs have such a
shifty slinking way with
them that you can't al-
ways tell what they are
driving at. This Borzoi
|chap had tried once or
twice to interest me in
what he called the Com-
|imily of Bones doc-
trine, but I soon found
out that his master was a conscientious
objector and a vegetarian and that the
doctrine really meant that he would do
the communing and I would provide
the bones. -
The rogue began with some fulsome
ingratiating remarks about how pleased
he was to see so many fine representa-
tives of the canine race prepared to
maintain intact their sovereign doghood
whatever, the sacrifice might, entail.
This brought loud applause from the
young hotheads; but I noticed traces
of disgust along the backs of the older
dogs. The time had passed, he con-
tinued, for speeches and resolutions
and votes of censure. Dogs must act
if Man, the enemy, was to be finally
crushed. I intervened at this point and
told the Borzoi he must moderate his
language, upon which he began to
bluster, shouting that he would not be
put down by an arrogant hireling of
effete Militarism. One learns to prac-
tise self-control in the trenches, so I

assert my authority then and there. It
was no use striking at man himself, he
went on, for he had guns and whips
and stones at his command. We must
strike at him through his children.
Cries of dissent greeted this state-
ment, and I really think the matter
would have ended then and there only it
so happened that none of those present
were personally interested in children,
except old Betty the bulldog, who be-
longs to four little girls who treat her
sovereign doghood in a most disrespect-
ful way. But old Betty had gone to
sleep, and, anyway, she is rather deaf
and has no teeth, so it's likely she would
have confined herself to a formal snuffle
of protest. “Yes,” shouted the Borzoi,
now thoroughly worked up, “let every
dog take a solemn oath to bite every
child on every possible occasion—at least
when no one is looking—and Man, the
oppressor, will soon come begging for
mercy and make peace with us on our
own terms. No false loyalty or ridi-
culous sense of chivalry must withhold
us,” he continued. “The baby in the
pram to-day is the man with the whip
of to-morrow and must be bitten with
all the righteous fury of outraged dog-
hood.” Cries of “Shame!” greeted this
remark. I decided that it was time to
interpose. With all the severity at my
command I bade the wretch be silent.
“Fellow dogs,” I said, “it is clear
that we must choose here and now,
once and for all, between Britishism
and Bolshevism. Tails up those who
wish to remain British ' " And of course
every tail went up. “Tails up, the Bol-
shevists | " But the Borzoi's was down
beyond recall and shivering between
his legs. “That being your decision,
ladies and gentlemen,” I continued,
“the meeting will constitute itself a
Committee of Safety. Remarks have
been passed about your Chairman
and the canine forces of His Majesty
that cannot be allowed to go un-
challenged. All I ask is plenty of
room and no favour.” --
All this time the Borzoi had been
edging towards the door, and I really
think he would have tried to make a
dash for it, only at the last minute he
caught the eye of the Irish wolfhound.
It's no good running away from a dog
like that, so Bolshy decided to stay and
face the music. Well, as I said before,
we war dogs are supposed to be as
modest as we are brave, so I will con-
fine myself to saying that down our
way Bolshevism hasn't a leg to stand
on. Of course Master, when he saw my
ear, pretended to be angry, but he knows
a war dog doesn't fight except for his
country, and when the Borzoi's owner
came round next day to complain
Master told him he was a miserable
Pacifist and had no locus standi. I told
Master afterwards that the Borzoi had
no loci standi either, because I'd jolly
well nearly chewed them off; and
he laughed and gave me a whole cutlet
with a lot of delicious meat on it, say-
ing he wasn't hungry himself.
Of course we dogs met again and
adopted the rest of our platform ; and
I don't mind saying I kept a pretty
tight grip on the proceedings. In fact,
several resolutions, such as those deal-
ing with “Municipal Dog's - meat,”
“Rabbits in Regent's Park,” “The Pro-
secution of Untruthful Parlourmaids,”
“Shorter Fur and Longer Legs,” were
carried without discussion. Naturally
the meetings concluded with a vote of
thanks to the Chair, to which I replied
(they tell me) felicitously.
That is how the War Dogs' Party
came into being ; and to-morrow I
shall tell that little terrier fellow from
No. 10, Downing Street, that as long
as his master remains faithful to the
Dog-in-the-Street the War Dogs' Party
will remain faithful to him. ALGOL.

AN EXPENSIVE AMUSEMENT.
“As,” says one of Mr. Punch's many
and very welcome correspondents, “you
will probably be writing for the benefit
of your readers a short handbook on
how to be demobilised, I enclose for
your guidance my solicitor's bill. He
was engaged from November 12th until
I returned home on leave on December
30th and took a hand in the game
myself. The chief work was tracing
the various Government Departments
to their hidden lairs in which they in-
dulge in the pleasing habit of exchang-
ing minutes. -
“Some day perhaps demobilisation
will reach me. The sooner the better,
for I can never settle this account on
my Army pay.”
So much for the preamble. Here,
with the alteration only of certain
names, is the document itself. Mr.
Jones, it should be mentioned, is a

I own that to find the publishers, those sometimes too
generous critics, writing upon the wrapper of An English
Family (HUTCHINsoN) an appreciation that bracketed it
with The Newcomes, did little to predispose me in its favour.
Later, however, when I had read the book with an in-
creasing pleasure, I was ready to admit that the comparison
was by no means wholly unjustified. Certainly Mr. HAROLD
BEGBIE has written a very charming story in this history
of the Frothinghams and the growth of their typically
English characters, maturing just in time for the ordeal
that has tested and (one is proud to think) triumphantly
approved the spirit of our country. In fact these memoirs
of Hugh Frothingham are something more than an idle
romance; there is an allegory in them, and some touch of
propaganda, cunningly introduced in the fine character of
Torrance, the great surgeon who married one of the
Frothingham girls and was bombed in the hospital raids.
Through the varied activities of the family, as they develop,
passes the cleverly-shown figure of Hugh, the narrator, who,
starting with fairer prospects than any of the others, is
ruined by indolence and an income, and hardly saved by the
War from degenerating into the torpid existence of a social
pussy-cat. Hugh is an admirable example of the difficult
art of seemingly unconscious self-revelation. Altogether I
have found An English Family greatly to my taste, dis-
playing as it does a dignity and breadth that recall not
unworthily the best traditions of the English novel. But
did we speak of Serbia in 1914? I only ask.
High Adventure (CoNSTABLE) is in certain ways the most
fascinating account of flying and of fliers which has come
my way. Captain NorMAN HALL, already well known to
readers of Kitchener's Mob, tells us in this later book how
he became a member of the Escadrille América ne and how
he learned to fly. And, as his modesty is beyond all praise, I
feel sure that he will forgive me for saying that it is not the
personal note which is here so specially attractive. What
makes his book so different from other books on flying is
that in it we have a novice suffering from all sorts of mis-
haps and mistakes before he has mastered the difficulties of
his art. Whether consciously or not Captain HALL per-
forms a very great service in describing the life of a flier
while his wings are—so to speak—only in the sprouting
stage. In an introduction Major GRos tells us of the work
done by American pilots before America entered the War,
a delightful preface to a book which both for its matter
and style is good to read.
I confess at once that The Uprooters (STANLEY PAUL) is
a story that I have found hard to understand. There
'seems an idea somewhere, but it constantly eluded me.
To begin with, exactly who or what were the Uprooters,
and what did they uproot ? At first I thought the answer
was going to name Major and Mrs. Elton, who for no very
sufficient reason would go meddling off to Paris, and trans-
porting thence the brother and sister Ormsby to Ireland.
The Ormsbys had been happy and (apparently) harmless
enough hitherto, but once uprooted they promptly developed
the most unfortunate passions—reciprocated, moreover—
for their well-wishers. The obvious and laudable moral of

which is, never remove your neighbour from his chosen
landmarks. Later, however, it became apparent that
Mr. J. A. T. LLoyd had a more subtle interpretation for
his title in the activities of a band of pacifists, headed by a
multi-millionaire, who called himself an American, though
somehow his name, Schwartz, hardly inspired me with any
feelings of real confidence. On his death-bed, however,
this gentleman reveals blood of the most Prussian blue,
confessing that his wealth has actually been derived from
the dividends of Frau BERTHA; and as the War has by this
time resolved the emotional difficulties of the other charac-
ters the story comes to its somewhat procrastinated finish.

is throughout of a brisk and

was the discontented wife of Avery Fairchild, a young
doctor with three children and a fair practice. After a while
her discontent so increased that she betook herself to the

Avery before long fell cheerfully in love with other persons
I suppose the move could so far be counted a success.
Before, however, the divorce facilities of the land of freedom
could bring the tale to one happy ending an accident to
Cecily's motor and the long arm that delivered her to her
husband's professional care brought it to another. I am
left wondering how this dénouement would have been
affected if Avery had been, say, a dentist, or of any other
calling than the one that so obviously loaded the dice in
his favour. I repeat, however, a distinctly well-written
and human story, almost startlingly topical too in one
place, where Dr. Avery observes, “There's a lot of grippe

Baroness ORczy's romance of old Cambrai, Flower o' the
Lily (Hodder AND Stoughton), should not be regarded as
in any way bearing upon the more modern history of that
remarkable city. It has nothing to do with our war; it
has a war of its own, a rapid affair of bows and arrows,
scaling ladders and such desperate situations as can be, and
were, saved by the arrival of the right man, single-handed,
in the right place at the right moment. Familiar as is his

bitter may be the first moment
when the true personalities are

the end. Here is a story of
intrigue and battle and love,
written in the necessary phrase-

round (and, I trust, consistent
with) the historical contest be-

Powers, disputing the terrain
of Flanders; in every way a

EVICTED.
(A common scandal, inviting the atten-
tion of the Government.)
I was amazed the other day to hear
that my landlord had called to see me.
Hitherto our intercourse had been by
letter and we had had heated differences
on the subject of repairs. His stand-
point seemed to be that landlords were
responsible for repairs only to lightning
conductors and weathercocks. My
house possesses neither of these desir-
able adjuncts.
I moved an armchair so that no one
sitting in it could fail to see the damp-
est wall and ordered him to be shown
ll). -
He was a most benevolent-looking
old gentléman, and I felt I had done
him an injustice in regarding him as a
property shark. . .
“Glad to see you,” he said, shaking
me warmly by the hand.
“Do sit down,” I said. “That chair
is the most comfortable. Don't be
afraid. At that distance from the wall
the damp won't affect you.” -
“So glad to see how comfortable you
are here,” said the benevolent one.
“If we could occasionally have a hot
bath we should be more comfortable,
but the kitchen range is impossible.”
“What you need, my friend, is a
house of your own so that you can
adapt it to your own ideas. How
would you like this house?”
My breath was taken away. Had
the kindly one come to present me with
a house? Was I to be the object of an
amiable plutocrat's benevolence?
“I should like it very much,” I said.
“You shall have it,” he said, slapping
me amiably on the knee. - . .
I gasped for breath. In my time I
had had boxes of cigars given me, but
never houses.
“For fifteen hundred pounds, as you
are the tenant,” continued the benevo-
lent one." -
I gasped for breath again.
“But you bought it for five hundred
and fifty pounds just before the War,” I
said when I had recovered.
“Ah, before the War,” chuckled the
philanthropist. - -
“I don't think I can afford fifteen
hundred pounds.”
The benevolent one looked disap-
pointed in me. “Dear me,” he said,
“and I wanted so much to sell it to
you. Well, I shall have to give you
notice to quit in June. This house
must be sold.” -
“But I can't get another house.”
“You can have this house. But
'surely you have some friend who will
advance you fifteen hundred pounds?”
“You don't know my friends. It
would he very awkward to be turned
into the street.”
“You should have a house of your
own and be independent. Every man
should own his home. Now can't you
think of some friend who could assist
ou?”
“Could you lend me fifteen hundred
pounds for a rather speculative invest-
ment 2 " I inquired.
“Since my kindly consideration for
a tenant is treated with mockery I give
you written notice to leave. A 'For
Sale' board will be placed in your
garden. A clause in the lease author-
ises me to do that. I wish you good
morning.” -
Well, I am to be evicted, and, as I'm
not an Irishman, no one will care. I
shall not lie in wait with a shot-gun for
my landlord. But there is no clause
in the lease forbidding me from putting
up my sale announcement beside the
landlord's. It will run :—

THE PUFF ERRATIC.
The New Statesman contains a letter
from Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, disclaiming
all responsibility for the publisher's
official description of his new novel
printed on the “jacket" or paper cover
thereof. It had not been submitted to
him for approval and he knew nothing
of it. Mr. BENNETT is, of course, en-
titled to his protest, but we greatly
hope that publishers will not be in-
duced thereby to abstain from supply-
ing these interesting summaries. If
only the method could be applied to
standard works the results would be
even more illuminating. As for example:
“IIAMLET,”
This delicious comedy is the romance
of the Prince of Denmark, which, un-
like other romances, begins after his
marriage: with Polonia, daughter of
Horatio, who had been previously en-
gaged to both Itosenstern and Guilden-
cranz. Hamlet, by joining a troupe of
strolling players, offends his uncle, the
reigning sovereign, and is confined in a
lunatic asylum.
Brilliant pictures of society in Copen-
hagen, Denmark Hill and Heligoland
alternate with sparkling studies of the
inner life of a touring company on the
Continent.
“Can a woman love three men 2" is
the theme of this engrossing extra-
Vaganza.
“IDYLLs of THE KING.”
In a series of exciting episodes, writ-
ten in fluent heroic couplets, the author
gives us a thrilling picture of the man-
ners and customs of the Court of King
Arthur, an early British sovereign,
whose stately home was situated on
the Cornish Riviera.
Owing to the compromising atten-
tions which he }. to Elaine, the
Lady of Shalott, the King alienates the
affections of Queen Guinevere and is
slain by one of his knights, Lancelot
by name. -
Winsome women, gallant paladins
and mysterious magicians throng these
fascinating pages, which incidentally
throw much light on the theological
problems discussed by the Knights of
the Round Table, among whom Merlin,
Vivien and Enid are especially pro-
minent.
“WANITY FAIR.”
Major Dobbin, a beau sabreur of irre-
sistible charm, is on the point of elop-
ing with Amelia Osborne, the wife of
a brother-officer, when the Battle of
Waterloo breaks out and Dobbin is
slain. Captain Osborne, in the mis-
taken impression that Amelia has
shared her betrayer's fate, marries the
beautiful Becky Sharp and is tried for
bigamy, but is acquitted, as Becky
Sharp is proved to have been already
married to an Indian Nabob of the
name of Crawley. On the death of
Crawley, Becky marries the Marquis of
Steyne, becomes deeply religious and
dies in the odour of sanctity.
“Is marriage a failure?” is the prob-
lem of this kaleidoscopic drama, which
is handled with all the author's well-
known soulful verve.
“Smith Minor’’ again.
“Apelles fuit carus Alexandro propter
comitate.” “Apples were dear in the
days of Alexander on account of the
Committee.” (? Food Controller.)
“A resolution was passed requesting the
responsible local authority to provide thirty
new houses in accordance with the Local
Government Board's scheme. The houses re-
quired were—first, those which were unfit for
human habitation.”—Susser Paper.
And, to judge by some of the fantastic
designs for rural cottages published in
the newspapers, those are what they
will probably get.

THE REAL DALRYMPLE.
You would feel quite uncomfortable
if you heard Dalrymple talk. He con-
veys the impression that everything is
badly in the way and ought to be
removed at once. That's his view.
Dalrymple has no patience with the
social system. This includes every-
thing, from the washing bill to the
House of Commons.
Dalrymple said the General Election
made him impatient. By the way,
Dalrymple is a fine upstanding person-
age, with just the coloured hair the
lady novelists dote on, and eyes in har-
mony; but despite his handsome placid
bearing Dalrymple is a fire-eater of
the hungriest.
“What you want to do is to make
a clean sweep of everything,” he said.
“Money is an anachronism, and in a
perfectly ordered State would not be
required.” -
Of course it is no more use arguing
with Dalrymple than it would be to
attempt a controversy on naval affairs
with Lord Nelson on his pedestal.
And then there is this about Dal-
rymple—you remember what some
Court poet said concerning Louis THE
FourtEENTH ; it was to the effect that
quand le Itoi parle—well, apparently
everything and everybody else had to
put up the shutters. I forget exactly
how the thing ran. It is just so with
Dalrymple. He comes into my room
in the City and warms himself, though
no fire is needed to fan his enthusiasm
for destruction. The Bolsheviks are
º Sunday folk compared with
him. A Nihilist on a war footing
would be considered Quaker-like in his
symptoms.
Dalrymple is neck or nothing. He
is a whole-hogger even to the most in-
digestible bit of crackling.
“What we want is a fresh start,” he
said. “Then you could begin anew and
everybody would have a chance. Burn
things, blow them up, leave nothing ;
then we should see something. Your
whole scheme is faulty. Your Under-
ground ” Dalrymple has an irritat-
ing habit of fathering things on me,
which is unfair, for, as regards the
Tubes, for instance, I am sorry to say
I have not even a share, and often not
as much as a strap.
“But the Underground is only a bit
overcrowded,” I ventured to say. “It
can't help that, you know.”
“It is all wrong,” said Dalrymple.
“The entire gadget is defective. Look
at France, look at America, look at Ger-
many and Russia and the Jugo-Slavs.”
It was rather breathless work look-
ing at all these nations and peoples,
but I did my best. Dalrymple is par-
ticularly strong when it is a question
of the Jugo-Slavs, and he always gave
me the idea that he spent his Satur-
day afternoons enunciating chatty
pleasantries in Trafalgar Square and
on Tower Hill.
But—you might just see the finish
—Dalrymple was not doing anything
of the sort the afternoon that I was
out house-hunting. Yes, it is true.
You will scarcely credit the fact that
I found any difficulty in tracking down
an eligible villa, but that is the case.
The quest took me to a pleasant
semi-rural neighbourhood where there
was room for gardens with the bor-
ders edged with the nice soft yellow-
tinted box, and rose walks, and dainty
little arbours, and fandangled appur-
tenances which amateur gardeners love
with perfect justification.
And there was Dalrymple. I won't
deceive you. I recognised him on the
other side of a low oak fence. He was
wearing an old hat of the texture of
the bit of headgear which the man who
impersonates Napoleon at the music-
hall doubles up and plays tricks with,
only Dalrymple's hat had obviously
been white and was now going green
and other colours with wear and tear.
And wherever Dalrymple went a
small cherub in a holland frock went
too." The cherub would be about five.
Dalrymple was fashioning a hen-coop
out of two or three soap-boxes. Both
he and the cherub ceased activities
when I hailed and approached; and I
stopped to dinner. Dalrymple told me
he rather fancied he could wangle me
a bungalow. -
“I know the agent chap,” he said,
as we sampled a very pleasant glass of
port. “Of course they want to keep it
fairly dark or we should be swamped.
I have taken a lot of trouble myself,
you know, and am just starting gar-
dening lectures at our club.”
So he went on—the house, his new
roses, the hens, the jam his wife made,
the idea he had for a winter garden in
the interests of his wife's mother, who
could then take the air in her Bath-
chair.
“But,” I said, “you want to sweep
everything away. You aim at sending
villages like this to pot—your own
word, you remember. And then there
are the Jugo-Slavs ; :
Dalrymple winked and handed
the cigars.
I fancy he is a fraud.

Maid. “No, MUM, I'M Not GołNg To STAY IN THIs House To BE INsulted BY HAVING slav EY' WRITTEN ON THE MAT.”
DAILY AND MAILY.
Mr. Daily burst into the room, slam-
º the door behind him, to find
Mr. Maily seated before the fire.
“Maily, you're not getting things
done,” he shouted as he walked swiftly
up and down the Turkey carpet.
“Only buttoning my spat, Daily,”
said Mr. Maily. Then he too, spring-
ing from his chair, walked rapidly to
and fro. But whereas Mr. Daily chose
the route between the window and the
motto, “Do something else Now!”
Mr. Maily took the line between the
fireplace and “Keep on keeping on 1"
for they seldom felt compelled to stick
to one direction.
“Maily, I'm worried,” exclaimed
Mr. Daily in passing. “Things seem
to be easing down. Even you are not
so nimble as you were. This silence
of the public troubles me—haven't been
saying things about us for a long time.”
“Some people even praise us,” re-
marked Mr. Maily, disgust mingling
with the perspiration on his face.
“We'll be damned if we put up with
praise,” Mr. Daily declared.
“We shall. We'd give praise if
they'd damn us,” said Mr. Maily.
“Never be funny, Maily, if you can
help it,” warned Mr. Daily. Then he
remarked wistfully, “If they'd only
burn us again ' "
“Couldn't we go for the Archbishop
of CANTERBURY 2’ asked Mr. Maily.
“To be burnt during morning service
in a cathedral x - -
“No, these church-people couldn't
be roused, Maily. Too much dilly-
dally about them. They'd never fall
to it.”
Mr. Daily jabbed his thumb against
a white bell-push, and a clerk appeared.
“Got enough work to do?” asked Mr.
Daily.
“And then some,” said the clerk.
“Well, get on with it,” shouted Mr.
Daily impatiently, and pressed a red
bell-push.
“Plenty doing?” he asked the com-
positor who appeared.
“Twice that,” said the compositor.
“Then go to it,” barked Mr. Daily.
Turning to behold Mr. Maily mopping
his brow, he cried, “For heaven's sake
don't let anybody see you standing
still, Maily.”
“I was only thinking,”
Maily. -
“Whatever for?” asked Mr. Daily.
said Mr.
“Do you suppose ->
“Suppose nothing. Know!”
“How would it be to—to denounce
beer?” asked Mr. Maily.
“Gad, but you've still got pluck,”
said Mr. Daily with something like
admiration. “They'd burn us right
enough. But there is such a thing as
too much pluck, Maily. Think again,
if you must think.”
“No,” Mr. Daily went on, “I doubt
if a satisfactory burning can be worked
—it only comes by accident. Mean-
while, if the public won't talk about
us, we must boom ourselves; ” and he
sprinted to a yellow bell-push to sum-
mon the editor.
“This peace business,” said Mr. Daily
to him—“Peace must be signed " How 's
that for a new stunt 2 Cut out ‘The
Soldiers' Paper' and call ourselves ‘The
Paper that gets Peace.' Get the boys
together, work out a scheme and come
and show us in half-an-hour.”
“But, Daily, is there any likelihood
of peace not being signed 2" asked
Mr. Maily, when the editor had gone.
“For goodness sake, Maily, pull your.
self together. Don't you understand
that one of the principles of our job is
to back certs?” said Mr. Daily.

Maisie was terribly upset when she
lost her gold curb bangle (with pad-

it was seeing a handbill offering two
pounds' reward on our front gate, with
the ink still damp, when I came home

some more under her arm and she
pressed them on me. “Run round to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
APRES LA GUERRE.
“On me sait jamais le dessous des
cartes,” as the perplexing dialect of the
aborigines of this country would put it.
William and I, when we used to discuss
after-the-war prospects o' nights in the
old days, were more or less resigned to
a buckshee year or two of filling shell-
holes up and pulling barbed wire down.
Instead of which we all go about the
country taking in each others' education.
No one, we gather, will be allowed to
go home until he has taken his B.A.
with honours. And after that—
But it would be better to begin at the
beginning.
i. began within ten days of the
signing of the armistice, assuming
the shape of an official inquiry from
Division, a five-barred document where-
in somebody with a talent for con-
fusing himself (and a great contempt
for the Paper Controller) managed to
ask every officer the same question in
five different ways. They cancelled
each other out after a little examination
and left behind merely a desire to dis-
cover whether or not each officer had a
job waiting for him on his return to
civil life. William and I took the thing
at a gallop, stuck down a succinct
“Yes, Yes, No, No, Yes,” subscribed
our signatures and returned the docu-
ments—or so William proposed to do—
“for your information and necessary
inaction.”
“They're getting deuced heavy about
these jobs, aren't they 2” observed
William a day or two later. “The
Old Man wants to see us all at orderly-
room for a private interview—he's
got to make a return showing whether
his officers have got jobs waiting for
them, if not, why not, and please in-
dent at once to make good any defici-
encies. Hullo, what's this 2''
It happened to be William's mail
for the day—one large official-looking
envelope. It turned out to be a docu-
ment from his old unit (he had entered
the Army from an O.T.C.), headed,
“Resettlement and Employment of ex-
Officers: Preliminary Enquiry.” It
was a formidable catechism, ranging
from inquiries as to whether William
| had a job ready for him to a request
for a signed statement from his C.O.
certifying that he was a sober, diligent
and obliging lad and had generally
given every satisfaction in his present
situation. In case he hadn't a job or
wanted another one there were con-
venient spaces in which to confess the
whole of his past—whether he had a
liking for animals or the Colonies,
mechanical aptitude (if any), down to
full list of birth-marks and next-of-kin.
William thrust the thing hastily into
the stove. But I observed that there
was a cloud over him for the rest of
the day. -
However, we both of us satisfied the
examiner at the orderly-room, though
the renewed evidence of a determined
conspiracy to find work for him left
William a trifle more thoughtful than
his wont. Shades of the prison-
house began to close about our grow-
ing joy. “These 'ere jobs,” remarked
William, “are going to take a bit of
dodging, dearie. Looks to me as though
you might cop out for anything from a
tram-driver to Lord Chief. Wish people
wouldn't be so infernally obliging. And,
anyway, what is this—an Army or a
Labour Exchange 2"
As the days wore on the strain be-
came more and more intense. William's
old school had contrived an association
which begged to be allowed to do any-
thing in the world for him except leave
him for a single day in idleness. And
what time the Army was not making
inquiries about his own civil intentions
and abilities it was insisting on his ex-
tracting the same information from the
platoons. William grew haggard and
morose. He began looking under his
bed every night for prospective em-
ployers and took to sleeping with a
loaded Webley under his pillow for
fear of being kidnapped by a registry
office. He slept in uneasy snatches,
and when he did doze off was tormented
by hideous nightmares.
In one of them he dreamt he was on
leave and walking through the City.
At every doorway he had to run the
gauntlet of lithe and implacable man-
aging directors, all ready to pounce on
him, drag him within and chain him
permanently to a stool—with the com-
plete approval of the Army Council.
In another he was appearing before a
tribunal of employers as a conscientious
objector to all forms of work.
The last straw was when the Briga-
dier caused it to be made known that
if any officer was particularly unsettled
about his future he might be granted
a personal interview and it would be
seen what could be done for him.
William sat down with the air of one
who has established a thumping bridge-
head over his Rubicon and wrote to
the Brigadier direct and as follows:–
“SIR,--I have the honour to hope
that this finds you a good deal better
than it leaves me at present. In case
you should be in any uncertainty over
your prospects on return to half-pay, I
shall be happy to grant you a personal
interview at my billet (Sheet 45;
G 22a 3.7.) and see whether anything
can be arranged to suit you. I may
add that I have a number of excellent
appointments on my books, from knife-
boy to traveller to a firm of mineral
water manufacturers. For my own
part my immediate future is firmly
settled, thank you. For at least three
months after my discharge from the
Army I have no intention of taking up
any form of work.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
You R OTHERwise OBEDIENT
SERVANT, ETC.”
× :: ::: >k >k
The court-martial was held last
Thursday and sentence will be promul-
gated any day now. Medical evidence
certified William as sane enough to
understand the nature of his offence,
but as the War is over it is unlikely
that he will be shot at dawn. William
himself is confident that he will be
cashiered, a sentence which carries
with it automatic arſd permanent ex-
clusion from all appointments under
the Crown. “That makes a tidy gap
in the wire,” says William hopefully.
“They won't even be able to make a
postman of me. With a bit of luck
I'll dodge the unofficial jobs—I get
that holiday after all, old bean.”

Guest (who has cut the cloth). “BILLIARDS REQUIRE coxsta NT PRACTICE.”
ANOTHER CRISIS.
(By a Futility Rabbit Keeper.)
THERE is a rabbit in the pansy bed,
There is a burrow underneath the wall,
There is a rabbit everywhere you tread,
To-day I heard a rabbit in the hall,
The same that sits at evening in my shoes
And sings his usefulness, or simply chews;
There is no corner sacred to the Muse–
And how shall man demobilise them all?
Far back, when England was devoid of food,
Men bade me breed the coney and I bought
Timber and wire-entanglements and hewed
Fair roomy palaces of pine-wood wrought,
Wherein our first-bought sedulously gnawed
And every night escaped and ran abroad;
Yet she was lovely and we named her Maud,
And if she ate the primulas, 'twas nought.
The months rolled onward and she multiplied,
And all her progeny resembled her; -
They ate the daffodils; they seldom died;
And no one thought of them as provender;
The children fed them weekly for a treat,
And my wife said, “The little things—how sweet!
If you imagine I can ever eat -
A rabbit called Persephone, you err.”
Yet famine might have hardened that proud breast,
Only that victory removed the threat;
And now, if e'er I venture to suggest
That it is time that some of them were ate,
That Maud is pivotal and costing pounds,
And how the garden is a mass of mounds,
She answers me, on military grounds,
“Peace is not come. We cannot eat them yet.”
So I shall steal to yon allotment space
With a large bag of rabbits, and unseen
Demobilise them, and in that fair place
They all shall browse on cauliflower and bean;
There Smith will come on Saturday, and think
That it is shell-shock or disease or drink;
But Maud shall dwell for ever there and sink
A world of burrows in Laburnum Green. A. P. H.

Now that hostilities are at an end it is thought by
many intelligent young subalterns that a little variety
might well be introduced into Army routine.
For instance, at a General's Inspection why should not
Officers' duties be allotted after this fashion ?—
The Commanding Officer will bind up the Second-in-
Command with a length of red tape, showing that no
escape is possible from this form of entanglement.
The Adjutant will give an exhibition of paper manipula-
tion, using various Army Forms for this purpose.
The Assistant-Adjutant will demonstrate how a morn-

TO MY DRESS SUIT.
OLD friend, well met ! I've longed for this reunion;
You've been the lodestar of this storm-tossed
ship
In those long hours which poets call Communion
With one's own Soul, and common folk the Pip.
The foe might rage, the Brigadier might bluster.
Was I down-hearted 2 No! My spirit soared
And dreamt of you and me with blended lustre
Gracing some well-spread and convivial board.
And what if now you fit askew where erstwhile
Fair lines bewrayed a figure not too svelte?
What if your shoulder-seams are like to burst,
while
A sad hiatus shows beneath the belt 2
As April fills the buds to shapely beauty,
As cooks fill Robert with plum-cake and tea,
So, it may be, a diet rich and fruity
May fill the gap that sunders you from me.
And if it fail, as I'm a living sinner
I'll save you from the gaze of scornful eyes.
They say that Bolsheviks don't dress for dinner;
I'll off to Petrográd and Bolshevize.

BUT (laying his hand on the clock) HERE Is
A PLEA FOR PROPORTION.
[Its contemporaries having told us all about
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's hat and how President
WILsoN ate a banana, The Daily Earpress
recently went one better with the headline,
“Mr. Balfour joins a Tennis Club,” as the sub-
heading of its “Peace Conference Notes.”]
HAs it always been this way, I wonder,
Did editors always display
The same disposition to blunder
O'er the weight of the news of the
day ?
When simpler was war and directer,
Was Athens accustomed to see
In the sheets of its Argus how HEctor
Had bloaters for tea?
If so—or indeed if it's not so—
One cannot but gently deplore
That the custom of chronicling rot so
Has not been expunged by the War.
When the world with its borrors still
stunned is
And waits for vast hopes to come
true,
What boots it if delegates' undies
Are scarlet or blue 2
All facts of those delegates' labours
I'm ready to read with a zest,
And they must, like myself and my

I know, have their moments of rest;
I do not begrudge them their pleasures,
But frankly I don't care a rap
If the sport that engages their leisure's

Each morning with gems of this kind,
Such matters must strike as momentous

'Tis time this delusion was done with,
High time that some voice made it
clear
We don't want those fountains to run
with
Such very small beer.

WINCEHESTER'S OPPORTUNITY.
WAR legislation has pressed hard on
many callings, and on none more than
that of the architect. But the embargo
has been liſted; the ancient art is com-
ing to its own again, and it is of happy
omen that the new President of the
Royal Academy has been chosen from
the architects. In this context we
welcome the stimulating article in a
recent issue of The Times à propos of
the Winchester War Memorial. “Are
we never,” asks the writer, “to take
risks in our architecture?” and his
answer, briefly summed up, is “Perish
the thought. De l'audace, encore de
l'audace, toujours de l'audace.” It is,
of course, a pity that the Winchester
War Memorial scheme has not met
with the unanimous approval of Wyke-
hamists. Possibly they have reason,
for while adding a new cloister, a new
gateway and a new hall to the existing
school buildings, it involves the pulling
down of the Quingentenary Memorial
Building, erected some twenty years
ago, and of some old houses in Kings.

drastic destruction to be unfortunate,

to be carried out.” Moreover it is pro-
K. to re-erect the Quingentenary
emorial on a new site, “where it will
certainly look as well as ever.”
The greatest event in our history, as
the writer finely observes, cannot be
worthily commemorated by any timid
compromise. Winchester has set a
splendid example, but it is perhaps too
much to expect that it will be followed
by London, owing to the inevitable
clash of conflicting interests in our
unwieldy metropolis. The erection of
a new Pantheon on the site of St. Paul's
and the removal of WREN's massive
but démodé structure to Hampstead
Heath, where it would certainly look as
well as ever, is, we fear, however much
The Times may desire it, beyond the
range of practical politics. But example
isinfectious, and iſ only the Winchester
authorities would expand their scheme
and carry it out with Dantonesque
audacity to its full logical conclusion,
other towns and cities might ultimately
fall into line.
Winchester Cathedral, as we need
| would look better than ever, space
hardly remind our readers, has only
been rescued from subsidence and col-
lapse at an immense cost by a lavish
use of the resources of modern engineer-
ing. The building itself is not without
merits, but its site is inconspicuous and
the swampy nature of the soil is a con-
stant menace to its durability. The
scheme which we venture with all
humility to suggest is that it should
be removed and re-erected, in the same
spirit though in the architectural lan-
guage of our own day, on the summit
of St. Catherine's Hill, where it would
look better than ever, and be connected
by a scenic neo-Gothic railway with
Meads. This would not only add to
the amenities of the landscape, but
enable the present cathedral site to be
utilized for a purpose more in con-
sonance with the needs of the age.
We do not presume to dictate, but may
point out that if the deanery and the
canons' houses were pulled down and
re-erected on the golf-links, where they
would be available for a majestic

confine ourselves to appealing with all
the force at our command to Winches-

us, in the choice of an architect of
genius and ingenuity, to persevere, to
rise to the occasion, to cast compromise
to the winds and above all to remember
that the greatest compliment which
can be paid to the architects of the past

be taken out of its cold-storage and

CIVIL EDUCATION FOR SOLDIERS.
WHEN the armistice was signed and
the close season for Germans set in, it
occurred to the authorities that it would
be a waste of labour to continue to train
some few million good men for a shoot-
ing season that might never re-open,
and the weekly programme became
rather a sketchy affair till some brain
more brilliant than the rest conceived
the idea of giving a good sound educa-
tion in the arts of peace to this promis-
ing and waiting multitude. The idea
was joyfully accepted, and gradually
filtered through its authorised channels,
suffering some office-change or other at
each stage till it finally reached one of
our ancient seats of learning. It arrived
rather like the peremptory order of a
newly - gazetted and I - --
bewildered subaltern,
who, having got his
platoon hopelessly tied
up, falls back on the
time-honoured and usu-
ally infallible"Carry on,
Sergeant.”
There were some six-
hundred white-hatted
cadets stationed at this
spot, all thirsting (pre-
sumably) for informa-
tion on gas, and Mills
bombs, and studs on
the cocking-piece, and
forming fours, and ver-
tical intervals and Dis-
trict Courts-martial;
and when the order
came to “carry on "
with education it caused
something like a panic.
A council of war nearly
caused Head-quarters || "... "
to cancel a battalion parade, but they
pulled themselves together and held
the drill, and then appointed Jack as
“Battalion Education Officer,” and
empowered him to draft a scheme of
work.
When produced it consisted of four-
teen paragraphs, each of which finished
up with the sentence," This is obviously
a problem for the Company Com-
mander.” Jack had nothing to learn
as to the duties of a battalion specialist
and realised that his responsibility lay
simply in providing Company Com-
manders, and then finding problems
for them to solve. As the Company
Commanders were already in being his
work was simplified.
However, the Company Commanders,
being men of merit, cheerfully accepted
the situation and approached their
victims, “We are going to teach you,”
they said. “What would you like to
be taught?”
“Well,” said the victims, “what have
you got?”
“Oh, anything you like,” said the
Company Commanders. “Just you
choose your subject and we'll do the
rest.”
Now that was very generous, but
rather rash. For the victims took them
at their word, and so by the time the
perspiring Platoon Commanders had
produced their returns (in triplicate) it
was found that there were forty-three
subjects to be provided for, including
seven languages, six branches of science,
four kinds of engineering, six commer-
cial subjects and various sundries, such
"as metaphysics, wool-classing and
coker-nut planting. -
The way the Company Commanders
dealt with this problem was quite
simple and ingenious. They sent for
all junior officers and asked what they
were prepared to teach. The result
seemed really rather good. Tom said
he would take French, having spent
three months in Northern France be-
fore they sent him to Salonika. Dick's
father has an allotment and Dick him-
self occasionally hunts, so he chose
Agriculture. Oswald chose Mathema-
tics, on the strength of having been a
Quartermaster-Sergeant in the Public
Schools Brigade in September, 1914.
Wilfred once went to a gas course for
ten days, so of course his subject was
Science. Arthur really does know some-
thing about Architecture and can also
enlarge a map quite nicely, so he put
down Drawing. John chose Theology.
He said he once read the lessons in
church; really he thought he was safe
to draw a blank.
Once more the Company Com-
manders were equal to the emergency.
Politically inclined Nurse (erhibiting new daughter to M.P.). “LET Us 'ope, SIR,
THAT SHE MAY LIVE TO BE CALLED THE MOTHER OF THE 'OUSE OF COMMONs.”
They looked at it in this way. French
is a foreign language; Spanish is also
a foreign language. Tom offers to
teach a foreign language; therefore Tom
shall teach Spanish. Corn-growing in
Western Canada, sheep - raising in
Australia and coker-nut planting are
all obviously agriculture. Dick says
he can teach Agriculture; so he shall.
The science of manures caused some
discussion as to whether it should be
agriculture or science, but it was finally
settled in favour of science, which also
included physics, electricity and crys-
tallography. John got four theological
students, but, when he investigated, he
found that one was a Jew and one a
Presbyterian minister, while the other
two, like himself, thought that no one
else would have thought of it. And
T these touch only the
fringe of the subject.
The indent sent in for
materials was a rather
formidable one, but the
article most in demand
was a sheep, which was

THE FOOD PROBLEM IN PARIS.
The cost of living in the vicinity of
the Peace Conference has been enor-
mously exaggerated. Likewise the
difficulty of reorganizing Europe on a
truly ethnic basis. By combining the
two questions I have found them im-
mensely simplified, and I have been in
Paris only three days.
My meaning will be clearly illus-
trated by the record of a single day's
experience—with the representative of
the Dodopeloponnesians for déjeńner
and the delegate of the Pan-Deutero-
nomaniads for dinner.
I made the acquaintance of the first
in the liſt. On the way down it came
out that I was journaliste assisting at
the Conference of the Peace, whereupon
the other introduced himself as secre-
tary of the Dodopeloponnesian dele-
gation and eager for the pleasure of
entertaining me at déjetimer.
Nothing international arose in con-
nection with the hors d'oeuvres. It was
between the soup and the fish that my
host inquired whether I had yet found
time to look into the just claim of the
Dodopeloponnesian people to the neigh-
bouring island of Funicula.
“You mean,” I said, “on the ground
that the island of Funicula was brought
under the Dodopeloponnesian sceptre
on September 11th, 1405, by Blagoslav
the Splay-fingered, from whom it was
wrested on February 3rd, 1406, by the
Seljuks?” -
“Precisely,” he said. “But also be-
cause the people of Funicula are origin-
ally of Dodopeloponnesian stock.”
“Yet they speak the language of
Pan-Deuteronomania,” I said.
“A debased dialect,” he said, “foisted
upon them by a remission of ten per
cent. in taxes for every hundred words
of the lingo learned by heart, with
double votes for irregular verbs.”
The entrée, something with eggs and
jelly, was excellent.
“Far be it from me to deny,” I said,
“the fact that Funicula is by right a
part of the inheritance of the Octo-
syllabarians"—and I bowed gracefully
to my host, who raised his glass in
return—“and I agree in advance with
every argument you put forward in
favour of a restored Sesquicentennial
commonwealth by bringing together
the scattered members of the Duodeci-
mal race from all over the world. In
fact,” I added as the waiter poured out
the champagne, “it seems to me that
in addition to the Island of Funicula

My friend and 1 occupied facing seats
in a railway-carriage on a tedious jour-
ney. Having nothing to read and not
much to say, I gazed through the win-
dows at the sodden English winter
landscape, while my friend's eyes were
fixed on the opposite wall of the com-
partment, above my head.
“What a country !” I exclaimed at
last. “Good heavens, what a country
to spend one's life in " -
“Yes,” he said, withdrawing his eyes
from the space above my head. “And
why do we stay in it when there are
such glorious paradises to go to 2 Ha-
waii now. If you really want divine
laziness—sun and warmth and the
absence of all fretful ambition—you
should go to the South Seas. You
can't get it anywhere else. I remem-
ber when I was in Hawaii—”
“Hawaii!” I interrupted. “You
never told me you had been to Hawaii.”
“I don't tell everything,” he replied.
“But the happiest hours of my exist-
ence were spent in a little village two
or three miles from Honolulu, on the
coast, where we used to go now and
then for a day's fun. It was called—
let me get it right—it was called Tor-
mo Tonitui-and there were pleasure-
gardens there and the most fascinating
girls.” His eyes took on a far-away
wistfulness.
“Yes, yes?” I said.
“Fascinating brown girls,” he said,
“who played that banjo-mandolin thing
they all play, and sang mournful lux-
urious songs, and danced under the
lanterns at night. And the bathing!
There
you can stay in the sea all day if you
like. It's like bathing in champagne.
Sun and surf and sands—there's no-
thing like it." He sighed rapturously.
“Well, I can't help saying again,”
I interrupted, “that it's a most extra-
ordinary thing that, after knowing you
all these years, you have never told me
a word about Honolulu or the South
Seas or this wonderful pleasure-garden
º called—what was the name of
it 2 ''
He hesitated for a moment. “Morto
Notitui,” he then replied.
“I don't think that's how you had
it before,” I said; “surely it was Tormo
Tonitui ?” -
“Perhaps it was,” he said. “I forget.
Those Hawaiian names are very much
alike and all rather confusing. But
you really ought to go out there. Why
don't you cut everything for a year and
get some sunshine into your system 2
You're fossilising here. We all are.
Let's be gamblers and chance it."
“I wish I could,” I said. “Tell me
some more about your life there."
“It was wonderful,” he went on—
“wonderful. I'm not surprised that
STEvºNsoN found it a paradise.”
“By the way,” I asked, “ did you
hear anything of STEVENSON ?”
“Oh, yes, lots. I met several men
who had known him—Tusitala he was
called there, you know—and several
natives. There was one extraordinary
old fellow who had helped him make
the road up the mountain. He and I
had some great evenings together, yarn-
ing and drinking copra."
“Did he tell you anything parti-
cularly personal about STEVENSON ?”
I asked.
“Nothing that I remember,” he said;
“but he was a fine old fellow and as
thirsty as they make 'em."
“What is copra like?” I asked.
“Great,” he said. “Like — what
shall I say 2—well, like Audit ale and
Veuve Clicquot mixed. But it got to
your head. You had to be careful. I
remember one night after a day's bath-
ing at-at Tromo Titonui-"
“Where was that ?” I asked.
“Oh, that little village I was telling
you about,” he said. “I remember
one night— ”
“Look here,” I said, “you began by
calling it Tormo Tonitui, then you
called it Morto Notitui and now it's
Tromo Titonui. I'm going to say
again, quite seriously, that I don't
believe you ever were in Hawaii at
all.”
“Of course I wasn't,” he replied.
“But what is one to do in a railway
carriage, with nothing to read, and a
drenched world and those two words
staring one in the face?” and he pointed
to a placard above my head advertis-
ing a firm which provided the best and
cheapest Motor Tuition.

Fastidious Warrior (hopelessly). “No, I SEE NOTHING For IT BUT To REMAIN IN THE ARMY.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ARNOLD BENNETT's new novel, The Roll Call (HUT-
cHINson), is a continuation of the Clayhanger series to the
extent that its hero, George Cannon, is the stepson of
Edwin, who himself makes a perfunctory appearance at
the close of the tale. The scene is, however, now London,
where we watch George winning fame and fortune, quite in
the masterful Five-Towns manner, as an architect. The
change is, I think, beneficial. That quality of unstalable
astonishment, native to Mr. BENNETT's folk, accords better
with the complexities of the wonderful city than to places
where it had at times only indifferent matter upon which
to work. But it is noticeable that Mr. BENNETT can com-
municate this surprise not only to his characters but to his
readers. There is an enthusiasm, real or apparent, in his
art which, like the beam celestial, “evermore makes all
things new,” so that when he tells us, as here, that there
are studios in Chelsea or that the lamps in the Queen's
Hall have red shades, these facts acquire the thrill of
sudden and almost startling discovery. I suppose this to
be one reason for the pleasure that I always have in his
books; another is certainly the intense, even passionate
sympathy that he lavishes upon the central character. In
the present example the affairs of George Cannon are shown
developing largely under the stimulus of four women, of
whom the least seen is certainly the most interesting, while
Lois, the masterful young female whom George marries,
promises as a personality more than she fulfils. We con-
duct George's fortunes as far as the crisis produced in them
by the War, and leave him contemplating a changed life as
a subaltern in the R.F.A. It is therefore permissible to
hope that in a year or two we may expect the story of his
reconstruction. I shall read it with delight.
Iron Times with the Guards (MURRAY), by an O.E., is
emphatically one of the books which one won't turn out from
one's war-book shelf. It fills in blanks which appear in more
ambitious and more orderly narratives. This particular old
Etonian, entering the new Army by way of the Territorials
in the first days of the War, was transferred, in the March
of 1915, to the Coldstreams and was in the fighting line in
April of the same year. A way they had in the Army of
those great days. Details of the routine of training,
reported barrack-square jests and dug-out conversations,
vignettes of trench and field, disquisitions on many strictly
relevant and less relevant topics, reflections of that fine
pride in the regiment which marks the best of soldiers, an
occasional more ambitious survey of a battle or a campaign
—all this from a ready but not pretentious pen, guided by
a sound intelligence and some power of observation, makes
an admirable commentary. Our author's narrative carries
us to those days of the great hopes of the Spring of 1917,
hopes so tragically deferred. Perhaps the best thing in an
interesting sheaf is the description of the attack of the
Guards Division — as it had become — on the Transloy-
Lesboeuſs-Ginchy road, with its glory and its carnage.
It is to be feared that Battle Days (BLACKWooD), a new

work by Mr. ARTHUR FETTERLEss, author of Gog, will lose
a good many readers as the result of the armistice. There
are battle stories and battle books that are not stories that
will live far into the piping times of peace because they are
human documents or have the stamp of genius. These
attractions are not present in Battle Days, which in truth
is rather a prosy affair, though ambitious withal. It is not
fiction in the ordinary sense. Mr. FETTERLEss essays to
conduct the reader through every phase of a big “Push.”
Pushes were complicated affairs, and the author does not
spare us many of the complications. And unless the reader
happens to be an ardent militarist he is apt to push off into
slumberland. Cadets should be made to read this book as
a matter of instruction; for, though it lacks the subtle
humour that endeared Duffer's Drift to us, it provides a
striking analysis of modern trench warfare.
The Curtain of Steel (Hodden AND STOUGHToN) is the
fourth book which the author of In the Northern Mists has
given us during the War, and in essentials it is the most
is clear English. Mr. S. M. ELLIS agrees with me in this
º point, and has written George Meredith : His
ife and Friends in Relation to his Work (GRANT RICHARDs)
to prove that this is so. The book is a curious compound.
At one moment Mr. ELLIS sets out in detail the Meredithian
genealogy, and shows that MEREDITH was the son and
grandson of tailors and did not relish the relationship; at
another moment he describes MEREDITH's delightful and
exuberantly youthful characteristics as a friend; and again
he shows how badly MEREDITH behaved in regard to his
first wife (though she was much more in fault), and also in
regard to his first son, Arthur. Still the book is extremely
interesting and, though it does not profess to deal in
elaborate criticism, it contains some very shrewd com-
ments on MEREDITH's work and the reasons that made
his novels so many sealed books to the British public.
Here and there Mr. ELLIs allows himself almost to write
a passage or two in the style of the master. This is one
of them: “As he [Maurice Fitzgerald] was the gourmetic
instrument that brought Mrs. Ockenden's art to perfect

valuable of the quartette. For here we have real history,
served, it is true, with some trimmings, but none the less
a true record of the doings of our Grand Fleet since the
day when the “curtain" was lowered. “Nothing,” our
author says, “nauseates a naval man so much as the
attempt to represent him as a hero or to theatricalise him
and his profession.” It behoves me then to choose my
words with the utmost circumspection, and I beg him to
forgive my audacity when I say that, if I were Book-Con-
troller, a copy of The Curtain of Steel would be in (and
out of) the library of every school in the Empire. I find
courage to make this statement because I see that he does
not deny that a part of our “disease of ignorance” concern-
ing the Senior Service is due to the modesty of Naval men.
If he will please go on correcting that ignorance, and in the
same inspiring style, I wish an even greater access of power
to his elbow.
“I am allowed the reputation of a tolerable guide in
writing and style, and I can certainly help you to produce
clear English.” These words, written in 1881, are to be
found in a letter of GEORGE MEREDITH to his eldest son.
They show how wildly mistaken even the best of us may
be with regard to our own qualities and gifts; for if there

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EDENTULOUS PERSONS.
IT happened a long time ago. Hig-
gins, Mackenzie and I, three irre-
sponsible subalterns, had been lent to
the Government of India for famine
relief work. One Sunday we fore-
gathered in the cool of the evening at a
dak bungalow, near the point where our
three districts met, to compare notes
and to swap lies. -
“How are you getting on 2 " I asked
Higgins. -
“I’m not getting on at all. I'm just
stagnating. I do all my work and draw
my pay, and there's the end of it. I'm
sure the regiment has forgotten all
| about me, and in fact no one seems to
be aware of my existence.”
“Why not write to the Government of
India about it 2" remarked Mackenzie.
“Yes, I'm sure that's the best thing
to do,” I agreed. “The Collector in
my district is always writing to the
Government of India, and the Govern-
ment prints all he writes and sends
it round with remarks and decisions.
He will get all sorts of honours and
rewards out of this famine.” -
“Yes. But what shall I write 2 ”
asked Higgins. “If I simply say there
is a chap called Higgins who is terri-
bly bored and wants some notice taken
of him, they won't print that sort of
tosh.”
“Not that particular kind of tosh,
perhaps,” agreed Mackenzie. “You’ve
got to write about your work and ask
for a decision on some point or other.
Then they'll remember your existence;
and if you write often enough you will
gradually crawl out of obscurity into
the limelight. Almost anything will
do to start with.”
“Well, I found an old woman to-day
in one of my camps who could not eat
her ration, because she had no teeth.
Can you make anything out of that?”
asked Higgins. -
“We'll have a shot at it anyway,”
replied Mackenzie. He pulled a sheet
of note-paper and a pencil out of his
pocket and wrote the following draft:—
“There are in the famine camps in my
area some toothless old people who
cannot eat the ordinary ration. What
shall I do about it 2."
“The gist of the letter is all right,” I
said, “but the style wants polishing.
Higgins's education will be gauged by
our style. Cross out ‘some toothless
old people' and write “certain edentul-
ous persons.' Put 'masticate' instead
of ‘eat.' Then you must not say,
‘What shall I do about it 2' That
sounds too helpless. You, or rather
Higgins, must appear as a man of un-
bounded initiative and resource. You
must write, “I suggest that a special
ration of soft food be issued to such
persons.' That will help the Govern-
ment of India to solve a very difficult
problem, and Higgins will earn its
eternal gratitude.”
The amendments were passed un-
animously. Higgins copied out the
letter in his best handwriting and sent
it off through the long and winding
channels by which subalterns on
famine duty communicate with the
heaven-born ones who sit on the far-off
hills.
We separated next day, and I forgot
all about the matter until three weeks
later, when, going through my official
mail, the name Patrick Aloysius Hig-
gins caught my eye. There was our
letter printed in full, and below it
was the epoch-making decision of the
Government: “A special ration of soft
food may be issued to edentulous per-
sons in famine camps.” .
Higgins's success evidently provoked
Mackenzie to emulate it. Some time
later I received another printed docu-
ment. After the usual official opening,
with its reference numbers, etc., it ran
as follows: “There are in the famine
camps in this area certain persons
who, though not edentulous, are yet
unable to masticate the ordinary ration.
Though they have some teeth, the
teeth are all in one jaw. May such
persons be considered as edentulous
for the purposes of the decision referred
to above 2 Signed, JAMEs Douglas
MACKENZIE.” The Government was
again pleased to record its approval.
The letter roused my jealousy. Hig-
gins and Mackenzie, by the use of my
distinguished literary style, had both
got well along the road to fame, whilst
I was still languishing in obscurity.
Something must be done about it. I
took a pen and wrote: “There are in
the famine camps in this area certain
persons who, though they are not
edentulous and though they have some
teeth in both jaws, are yet unable to
masticate the ordinary ration because
the teeth in the upper jaw correspond
with the gaps in the lower, and vice
versa. May such persons be considered
as edentulous for the purposes of the
two previous decisions?” -
I sent the letter off to the Govern-
ment of India. The reply came by
return of post:—
“The Government of India, in re-
sponse to representations, has author-
ised the issue of a special ration of soft
food to edentulous persons in famine
camps. In the interpretation of the
term ‘edentulous' considerable latitude
may be permitted, and is indeed desir-
able, so that it may in practice be
applied to many individuals who, ac-
cording to meticulous physiological
standards, should not be so classified. ||
The determining factor in the applica-
tion of the term should be the inability
of the individual concerned to extract l.
sufficient nutriment from the normal
ration, owing to imperfect mastication.
Such persons will invariably exhibit
symptoms of mal-nutrition or caco-
trophy.
“The Government is confident that
the foregoing general ruling will enable
junior and inexperienced officers, tem-
porarily employed on famine duty, to
classify appropriately and with facility
as denticulate or edentulous all individ-
uals afflicted with dental hiatus, mal-
conformation and labefaction, without
further reference to higher authority.”
As I read the letter with the help of
a dictionary, it dawned upon me that
the Government of India had won the
game beyond all doubt and peradven-
ture. -

116 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 12, 1919.
THE PATRIOT PIG.
LAST Spring I was discussing food
with our local doctor. Last Spring it
was quite a favourite topic.
“Now,” I said, “we can manage to
scratch along somehow. But next
ear . . .”
The Doctor, a hearty man, gave me
a smashing blow on the shoulder. “I
have it!” he trumpeted. “We’ll start
a Patriot Pig Club.”
Before he left I found myself an im-
portant pillar of the scheme. Pillars,
you know, are the parts of an edifice
that bear the weight. Their function
is to be sat upon by the arches. In
this case the arches were Jones the
doctor and Perkins the butcher.
The Committee began sissing. I put
five pounds into the preliminary pool
and promised them all my pig-swill.
I know I did, because the Doctor came
straight from the meeting to my house
to tell me I had, and to collect the
cheque.
The pigs arrived. I myself and a
number of other enthusiasts turned out
to welcome them. The Doctor, I re-
member, made a happy little speech,
and we all laughed a lot. The Com-
mittee were very pleased with them-
selves. They were dear little chaps—
the pigs, I mean—very small, of course,
but that gave me the opening for what
was undoubtedly the most successful
sally of the afternoon. Someone said
they weighed five pounds apiece. “One
pound per pound,” I remarked.
A week later the Doctor called for
my second instalment. “Pig going
strong,” he chattered gaily while I
wrote out the cheque; “best of a good
litter—bust its pink ribbon yesterday:
twice the weight it was when it came.”
It was on the tip of my tongue to
repeat my witticism, which was still
true, but I refrained.
I paid the first dozen five-pound
instalments without comment. Up till
then I had been fully occupied in study-
ing how Foch was getting on with the
other sort of pig over there. But now
I began to think.
I was thinking heavily when I put
on my hat, but when I reached the
premises of the Patriot Pigs I was
thinking things that I prefer not to
talk about. To begin with, they were
housing the poor little beasts in a place
you wouldn't dream of inflicting on the
poorest labourer. And the overcrowd-
ing !- And the dirt And the pigs
themselves! They were positively un-
canny. There was something almost
human about them. They were all
heads and no bodies. It was just as
though the other half of the wits of the
half-witted boy who looked after them
had distributed itself among the whole
herd. I could have wept when I
thought how my purse and my swill-
tub had been emptied to keep such puny
monstrosities in the land of the living.
I had my pig taken out and weighed.
He turned the scale at forty-eight
pounds.
A week later I went and weighed
him again; he had shrunk to forty.
I am a man of action. In a flash
my mind was made up. I put him on
a string and led him home.
My wife seemed rather surprised
when we entered the drawing-room,
but I hastened to explain.
“I paid five pounds,” I said, “for a
five-pound pig. Since then I've paid
fifty-five pounds more, and I have been
led to expect that at the very least the
pig was keeping pace. But it isn't.
The sterling is increasing by leaps
and bounds; the avoirdupois is not
even stationary. That's not counting
several tons of swill that ought to be
inside him but aren't. It can't go on.”
I paused and added darkly, “That pig
shall not return.”
“But surely you're not going to
have him live with us, Henry '"
I controlled myself.
“No, Maria,” I said, “I am not. At
a late hour to-night we will take him
out into the country and lose him.”
“Oh, Henry,” she began, “sup-
posing * x
I interrupted gently but firmly.
“My mind,” said I, “like BERT
Coote's, is made up. He is my pig
and I may do what I like with him.
There is no law against one losing one's
pig. Besides, he is ruining me.”
At 10 P.M. we set out en famille.
It was July. I remember the date
rather particularly because it was just
then that they ceased to ration bacon
altogether. At 10.30 the pig was safely
lost. At 11 the front-door closed upon
us. At 11.1 little Willy Perkins, the
butcher's son, arrived with the pig and
claimed something for restoring lost
property.
A man with a position to keep up
simply can't afford to be caught in the
act of feloniously making away with
pigs in war-time; besides DoRA was
still alive and she might have some-
thing to say; so I had to pretend how
pleased I was, and I gave the scamp
half-a-crown.
Now I know Perkins and Son well
enough to realise that if the animal had
been worth more than half-a-crown they
would have allowed me to lose my pig
free of charge. So I made another
resolution. It was pretty drastic, but
in a crisis like this severe measures are
often the best. In short, it was murder
I contemplated—nothing less.
I went to work carefully. I let four
months slip by to allay any possible
suspicion. I paid my weekly cheque
without being asked; without a murmur
I parted daily with my swill; in fact I
comported myself as though the unholy
plot maturing in my breast was non-
existent.
At length the night arrived. I took
down my long magazine Lee Enfield
and my cartridge (I am not a Volunteer
for nothing) and crept to the Patriot
Pig H.Q.
The once-crowded sty lay dark and
still. I entered and switched on my
torch : it shone on the loathsome
features that I knew so well. He was
all alone, so there could be no mistake.
His head was as large as ever, but his
body seemed scarcely visible. I weighed
him ; he registered fourteen pounds.
I will not harrow you, my reader,
with details. Suffice it to say my nerve
was sure, my eye true and my hand
steady. I killed that pig with a single
shot and went home to bed.
The Doctor arrived next morning
while I was shaving. He was white
with rage. He said:
“What the deuce do you mean by
killing my pig’”
“Your pig 2"
ig !”
“Stuff and nonsense!” he spluttered.
“Your pig died four months ago—
caught cold last July through being out
so late at night and died next day.”
That roused me. “Do you mean to
tell me,” I asked coldly, “that I've
been paying five pounds a week for the
last four months for a dead pig 2"
“Very kind of you, I'm sure,” replied
the Doctor, “but no one asked you to,
you know.”
Adding together all my expenses—
the weekly subscription for my pig; a
similar sum paid to the Doctor for his;
the value of my swill; the fine imposed
(by DoRA) for improper use of firearms;
ditto (by the Magistrate) for shooting
game without a licence; alleged damage
to the P.P. premises and the remaining
wits of their custodian; and finally, the
bill from Mr. Perkins for a pound of
pork purchased in July, and the account
from Dr. Jones for professional attend-
ance subsequent to consumption of
same—adding all these together I find
that from first to last I disbursed
£385 5s. 5./l. on the patriot.
With pork at two shillings a pound
my outlay should have produced a pig
that weighed 1 ton 143 cwt. Truly
that would have been a very Hinden-
burg of a pig. It was almost worth
trying.
I smiled. “No, my

TO THE SPEAKER ON HIS RE-ELECTION.
Good Mr. SPEAKER, in this troublous time,
When it is hard to string a cheerful rhyme,
Your genial influence unshaken bides
Amid the flux of shifting sands and tides;
And, re-electing you by acclamation,
The Parliament has acted for the nation,
Which, while acknowledging the Members' mous,
Congratulates not you, Sir, but the House.
'Tis fourteen years since you were called to bear
The heavy burdens of your “perilous Chair"—
What years, what burdens! Yet your steadfast mien
Has never failed to dominate the scene.
Others have found the post a giant's robe
Or lacked the needful patience of a Job;
But you, by dint of fearless common sense,
Have won and held all Parties' confidence;
Firm as the rock and as the crystal clear,
When need arises righteously austere,
Ready, not eager, your advice to lend,
And not afraid in season to unbend.
Thus, tested by a strain that very few,
If any, of your predecessors knew,
You come at last, among the lesser fry,
To loom so largely in the public eye,
That we regard you, greatest of your clan,
More as an institution than a man.

TEIE RETURN.
It was at tea last Sunday that we met for the first time
for three-and-a-half years. He was sadly altered. To the
casual observer he may still appear his own attractive self;
the change in him is deeper.
He isn't what he was, but none the less it is wonder-
fully delightful to have him among us again. A girl at
the next table noticed him and spoke smilingly to her com-
panion. But I–I sat and looked at him and never said a
word.
Before the War I was fond of him, but I doubt if I could
ever have realised how much I should miss him ; and
nothing has brought home to me so surely the astound-
ing fact that at last it is over as his return.
Sitting opposite to him here brought back the jolly
memories of other teas in that distant pre-war life of ours—
memories of bright faces, gentle clatter of cups, charm of
soft clothes, strange forgotten sense of comforts, and one
particular smile; and, throwing off from me the gathering
gloom of the war-weary, I dug my fork joyously into his
brown bosom and raised the chocolate éclair to my lips.

OLD HEN-PECK.
Captain Edwin Peck, R.N.,
Had the habits of a hen.
Edwin's nose was like a bone,
And his teeth were not his own ;
Neither, I regret to tell,
Did they fit him very well.
It was not his fault, no doubt,
That they tried to tumble out,
And in fact he seldom dropped
them,
For he almost always copped them
Just as they became unstuck
By ejaculating, “Cluck.”
Yoked to this elusive plate,
Did our Edwin curse his fate?
No, he was content to live,
For he was inquisitive.
If he saw a speck of grit
He must needs examine it,
Not as any other might,
Standing at his proper height,
But with body slightly slanted
And his head obliquely canted,
While with small unblinking eye
He surveyed it wickedly.
One fine Sunday Captain Peck
Stalked along the lower deck,
Pausing now and then to stare,
Poking here and scratching there,
Like a pullet in her prime
Clucking softly all the time.
Presently the Captain spied
One small scuttle open wide.
“Cluck ' " he said, and likewise,
“Tut,
Every scuttle should be shut;"
And with a malignant snort
Poked his head out through the port.
That was easy, but, alack'
When he tried to get it back
There was heard an angry cluck—
Captain Edwin Peck was stuck!
Strange at first as it appears,
He had overlooked his ears;
But it's not so queer, perhaps,
When you ask, “Have hens got
flaps?”
Silence! You'd have heard a pin
Fall upon the deck within,
Till the Bloke was heard to shout,
“Stick it, Sir! We'll get you out !”
Everybody had a go–
Chief, Commander, P.M.O.,
Padre, Carpenter and Stoker,
Using engine-grease and poker,
Hawser, marlin-spike and soap,
Till at length they gave up hope,
For, in spite of all they did,
Edwin fitted like a lid.
Suddenly upon the scene
Came a German submarine.
Then a flash, a roar, a groan;
“We are sinking like a stone !”
Cried the Bloke with angry frown;
“Can we leave poor Peck to drown?
Really, this is too absurd;"
Then a miracle occurred.
As the cold green waters roll
Round poor Edwin in his hole,
Are the watchers wrong in thinking
That the Captain's neck is shrinking?
As she took her final list on,
Sighing, “tºop uév ſparov l''
Long-enduring Captain Peck
Gracefully withdrew his neck,
Poked it out again and spoke
To the sorrow-stricken Bloke:
“Nothing more that we can do?
No? Then sound the ‘Sove kee
poo ! x * x
Need I tell how Captain Peck
Was the last to leave the wreck,
How the good ship perished, or
How he brought them safe to shore,
Landing, after all his men,
Clucking softly like a hen?

Londoners: “Et, Tube, brute!”

[FEBRUARY 12, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUD LARKS.
ONE reads a lot nowadays about the
“slavery " of various habits (drug,
drink, bigamy, etc.) and loud is the
outcry. But there is yet another
bondage, just as binding and far more
widespread, which nobody ever, seems
to mention, namely, the drill habit.
Drill the young soldier up in the way
he should go and for ever after his
body will spring to the word of com-
mand, whether his soul approves or no.
Once upon a time two men turned
up in a railway construction camp deep
in the Rhodesian bush. They were a
silent, furtive, friendless pair, dwelling
apart, and nobody could discover whence
they came, whither they were bound,
or, in fact, anything about them. It
was generally conceded that they had
some horrid secret to bury (camp opti-
mists voted for “murder") and left it
at that. Time went by and so did the
rail-head, leaving the two mysteries
behind as permanent-way gangers.
Solitude seemed to suit them. Years
passed along and still the two remained
in that abounination of desolation guard-
ing their stretch of track and their
horrid secret. Then one day RoRERTs
rolled by on his way to Victoria Falls,
and, his train halting to tank-up, the
old Field-Marshal stepped ashore and
called to the two gangers, who happened
to be close at hand tinkering at their
trolley. The guard, who was taking
a bottle of Bass with the steward on
the platform of the diner, suddenly
jabbed his friend in the brisket. -
“Look, for the love of Mike ' " he
giggled.
The two gangers were standing talking
to “BoBs,” shoulder to shoulder, heels
together, feet spread at an angle of
forty-five degrees, knees braced, thumbs
behind the seams of their trousers,
backs hollowed, heads erect—in short
in the correct position of attention as
decreed in the Book of Infantry Train-
ing. The old man finished speaking
and the two saluted smartly and broke
away. The steward looked at his
friend and nodded, “Old soldiers.”
“Old deserters, you mean,” retorted
the guard. “Now we know.”
The drill habit had been too strong
for those two fugitives even after ten
years.
The other night our Babe, as Orderly
Officer, sat up alone in the Mess, con-
suming other people's cigarettes and
whisky until midnight, then, being
knocked up by the Orderly Sergeant,
gave the worthy fellow a tot to restore
circulation, pulled on his gum-boots
and sallied forth on the rounds. By
12.45 he had assured himself that the
line guards were functioning in the
prescribed “brisk and soldierly man-
ner,” and that the horses were all pro-
perly tucked up in bed, and so turned
for home.
He paused at the cross-roads to hear
the end of the Sergeant's reminiscences
of happy days when he, the Sergeant,
(then full-private, full in more senses
than one) had held the responsible
position of beer-taster to a regiment at
Jaipurbad (“an ideal drinkin' climate,
Sir"), then, dismissing the old con-
noisseur, continued on his way bedward.
It must have been one o'clock by
then, a black wind-noisy night. As
the Babe turned into the home straight,
he saw a light flash for an instant in a
big cart-shed opposite the Mess—just
a flicker as of a match scratched and
instantly extinguished.
This struck him as curious; it was
no weather or hour for decent folk to
be abroad. The Babe then remembered
that the mess-cart was in the shed, and
it occurred to him that somebody might
be monkeying with the harness. He
thereupon marched straight for the
shed (treading quite noiselessly in his
gum-boots) and, pulling out his electric
torch, flashed it, not on some cringing
Picard peasant, as he had expected, but
on three unshorn, unwashed, villainous,
whopping big Bosch infantrymen It
would be difficult to say who was the
most staggered for the moment, the
Huns blinking in the sudden glare of
the torch or the Babe well aware that
he was up against a trio of escaped
and probably quite desperate prisoners
of war. “Victory,” says M. HILAIRE
BELLoc (or was it NAPOLEoN ? I am
always getting them mixed) “is to him
who can bring the greatest force to
bear on a given position.” That is as
may be, but, after personal participa-
tion in one or two of the major
disputes in the late lamented war, I
put it this way. Two opposing factions
bump, utter chaos reigns supreme and
the side which recovers first wins. In
this case the Babe was the first to
recover. A year before the War he
found himself in a seminary in the
suburbs of Berlin, learning to cough his
vowels, roll his r's and utter German
phonetically. Potsdam was near at hand,
and many a pleasant hour did the Babe
spend on a bench outside the old Stadt
Palast, watching young recruits of the
Prussian Guard having their souls
painfully extracted from them by Feld-
webels of great muzzle velocity and
booting force. The sight of those three
Hun uniforms standing before him
must have pricked a memory, which in
turn set some sub-conscious mechanism
to work, for suddenly the Babe heard a
voice bawling orders in German. It
was fully five seconds, he swears, before
he recognised it as his own. “Atten-
tion 1" snarled the voice in proper
Potsdammer style. “Quick march 1
Right wheel!” The three great hooli-
gans trembled all over, clicked their
heels and stepped off the mark as punc-
tiliously as though on the Tempelhofer
Feld at the Spring Parade.
In two minutes the Babe, snarling
like a Zoo tiger at dinner-time, had
manoeuvred them across a hundred
yards of bog and filed them, goose-
stepping, into a Nissen Hut full of
sleeping Atkinses. The Atkinses rolled,
gaping, off their beds at the Babe's
first shout, and the game was up.
Ten minutes later the Bosch gentle-
men were en route for the main guard
under strong, if déshabillé, escort.
It turned out that one of them spoke
English quite badly and on reaching
the Guard Room he opened out.
They had escaped from a prison
camp at Abbeville, he said, and were
heading for Holland, travelling by
night.
Passing the farm at about midnight
they espied our hooded mess-cart and,
feeling tired and footsore, had conceived
the bright idea of stealing a horse to fit
the cart and driving to Holland in style
and comfort. Just as they were getting
things shipshape along came the Babe
and clapped the lid on—“verfluchte
kleine Teufel !”
When the Main Guard lads inquired
how it was that after all their trouble
they had allowed one lone unarmed in-
fant to corral the three of them, instead
of quietly biffing him on the head, as
they quite easily might have done, the
Huns were very confused. At one
moment they were in the shed, they
said, fascinated like moths in the glare
of the torch, and the next thing they
knew they were in the midst of a horde
of underclothed Tommies — trapped.
As to what had happened in the inter-
val, or how they had been spirited from
one place to the other, they were not
in the least clear—couldn't explain it
at all.

MR. LOWTHER TAKES THE CHAIR FOR “POSITIVELY THE LAST TIME."
SECONDER (COLONEL MILDMAY AND
Tuesday, February 4th. — There is
much virtue in horsehair. Few who
attended the informal opening of the
Third Parliament of KING GEORGE THE
FIFTH would have guessed that under
the full-bottomed wig and gorgeous
black-and-gold robes of the dignified
figure on the Woolsack lay the volatile
personality of “F. E." He played his
new part nobly. A trifling error in the
setting of his three-cornered hat, whose
rakish cock was for the moment remin-
iscent of the “Galloper,” was quickly
corrected on the advice of one of the
Lords Commissioners at his side; and
by the time the faithful Commons were
admitted to hear the Commission read
there was nothing to differentiate Lord
BIRKENHEAD (as he had now become)
from any previous occupant of his
exalted position. Nor was there any
lack of dignity in his delivery of the in-
structions to the Commons to “proceed
to the choice of some proper person
to be your Speaker”—though I fancy
that when he bade them “repair to the
place where you are to sit” he must
have been tempted to add the words,
“provided that you can find room
there.”

returned there, was a seething mass

swamp the floor and surge over into the

were closed and taxis few and far be-
tween, some of them were obliged to
resort to unusual methods of locomo-
tion. Sir HENRY NorMAN surprised the
police in Palace Yard by arriving on a
motor-scooter, and there is an uncon-
firmed rumour that the Editor of John
Bull made his rentrée to the House in
a flying-boat drawn by four canards

thick and slab that Mr. DE WALERA, who
was reported to have escaped from
durance vile with the intention of pre-
senting himself at the House and creat-
ing a disturbance, would have found it
impossible to gain entry unless pre-
ceded by a charge of gelignite. As it
was, none of the Sinn Feiners was pre-
sent, nor indeed any representative of
Irish Nationalism at all, and the pro-
ceedings were as orderly as a Quaker
funeral.
Not that they were by any means
dull. For both Colonel MILDMAY, who
proposed, and Sir HENRY DALZIEL,
who seconded, the re-election of Mr.
Lowth ER as Speaker, spiced their
compliments with humour. The former
was confident that even if Woman

who “must not only have good vision
but be sometimes quite blind; not only
have acute hearing but occasionally be
almost stone-deaf.” Fortunately the
SPEAKER - ELECT can assume these
physical defects at will; for, despite its
quiet opening, I doubt if the new Par-
liament when it gets to work will prove
precisely a Lowther Arcadia.
Wednesday, February 5th.--To the
Lords again, where the SPEAKER-ELECT,
attired in Court dress and accompanied
by the SERGEANT-At-ARMs dandling
the Mace as if it were a refractory in-
fant, presented himself at the Bar to
hear from the Lord CHANCELLOR the
pleasing intelligence that His MAJESTY
was convinced of his “ample suffi-
ciency” to execute his arduous duties,
and readily approved his election.
Thereupon Sir Colin KEPPEL swung
the Mace on to his shoulder and escorted
the SPEAKER, now confirmed in his
rank, back to the Commons.
There was an unusual rush of Mem-
bers to take the oath. This was not
entirely due to the new Members,
naturally desirous of completing their
initiatory rites, but was shared by
many of the older hands, for the good
and sufficient reason that, until a Mem-
ber is certified as having been duly
sworn, he cannot recover his one hun-
dred and fifty pounds deposit from the
Returning Officer. In their zeal to be
in a position to reimburse themselves
Members crowded in such numbers
to the tables that there was some
danger that they would be overturned.
As one of our Latinists remarked, “It
looks as if we should have novae res
outside and movae tabula inside.”
Thursday, February 6th.-The pro-
cess, once immortalized by a Lords'
reporter in the sentence, “A few
Bishops looked in, swore, and went
away again,” went on in both Houses;
but in the Commons in a more orderly
fashion than yesterday. For the
SPEAKER, ever ready, as he said on
his election, “to carry out the old rules
in a modern spirit,” directed the wait-
ing Members to form up in line. One
of the Coalitionists evinced a little
surprise. He had always understood
that when coupons were issued queues
were superfluous.

matter in dispute this time is a very
simple affair. The men, who are now

of ten minutes each per day, are not
pressing for any alteration in pay or

This morning many a heart was
thrilling,
And brought a shining cardboard box
With round red hearts in paper

With what seems small by modern

pleasure.

Makes two dark eyes to shine more

DANCING DEMOBILISED.
[It is said that demobilised officers, anxious
to dance, are finding it almost impossible to
buy dress-shirts and evening pumps.]
Now that I've been demobilised
I'm going again to dances—
I do not care with whom or where,
I'm taking any chances.
And evening dress, I've been advised,
Will never become transitional;
Yet once or twice I've been surprised
To find my khaki pals disguised
In new dress suits and old trench
boots, -
Which scarcely seems traditional.
I met my Colonel at a hop
Jazzing in his goloshes, - *
With a dress-tie pert on a cricket-shirt
That had shrunk in various washes;
And my Major was doing the Donkey-
Drop
Between a couple of rippers—
Yet his pink-and-white pyjama-top
If anything seemed a shade de trop,
And his faultless coat hardly echoed
the note
Of his worsted bedroom slippers.
But the world long since went off its
chump,
And the cry of the man from France
1S,
“I simply refuse to let shirts and shoes
Prevent me from going to dances.
I'll take the shine out of collar and
pump,
And their wearers will look silly
When I once begin the Giraffe-Galump,
The Chicken-Run and the Jaguar-Jump,
The Wombat-Walk and the Buffalo-
Bump,
With a chamois vest on my manly chest,
And football-boots and the smartest
of suits
They can cut in Piccadilly.”
The Grand Trunk Line.
“The following are some alternative routes
which could be used by people going home this
evening from the City or West End;—

T.OCAL COLOUR.
I RAN upstairs after lunch to-day to
see old Harris. He has the flat over
mine, you know. In addition to this
Harris is an author. Sometimes he
even gets money for it.
“Doin' a bit of work to-day, Harris?”
I remarked casually.
“I’m doing a little flying story,” he
informed me with dignity.
“Oh, yes,” I agreed carelessly, then
woke up and stared hard. -
“Flying?” I repeated. “But what
the-I mean, what do you know about
flying, anyway?” .
Brutality is the only thing with
Harris. He was very hurt. He gasped
and glared at me in a most annoyed
Inanner.
“I know a pretty good lot,” he
announced with some asperity. “I've
talked to dozens of pilots about it and
I've read books on flying—and the
newspapers -
“And don't forget you once passed
Hendon in the train too, old son,” I
soothed him. “I'd no idea you were
so well up in it, Sorry I spoke. Let's
see it; may I ?” -
Harris picked up a couple of sheets
of paper from the desk and, coughing
imposingly, proceeded to read out his
masterpiece —
“Lionel Marchant came slowly out
of the hangar, drawing on his long fur
gloves and studying his maps with an
intent and keen face.
“His machine, a single-seater scout
of the latest type, was just being
wheeled out and now stood glistening
in the bright autumn sunshine, which
danced on the shining brasswork and
threw deep shadows on the grass be-
neath.
“The airman swung lightly into his
seat; a final word or two with his
commanding officer and he flung over
the levers and gave a sharp turn to the
starting handle.
“The powerful engine in front of
him woke into life deafeningly and,
waving away the mechanics holding
the wings, he pressed the clutch pedal
and moved slowly forward.
“His face is very grim and deter-
mined—he throws across another lever
and the low hum of the motor changes
into a deep-throated roar. Gathering
speed, he goes faster and faster—now
he is in the air—now a little speck in
the sky, heading for the enemy's
lines r x
“Oh, no, please,” I broke in feebly,
“I can't stand any more just now.
You're not seriously thinking of having
this published, are you?”
As in a dream I took the manuscript
from his fingers and gazed blankly at
it whilst his indignant flow of speech
passed harmlessly over my head.
“But, Harris,” I said at length, with
infinite compassion in my voice,
“Harris, I love you as a brother, but
this really is awful—why—well, listen
here "—
““As the second German machine
came down on them in a steep dive
Lionel gave a hasty glance behind him,
where the huge engine raced madly,
and shouted excitedly to his observer.
“‘The latter, swinging the machine
gun round sharply, took rapid aim and
pressed the trigger x - -
I stopped.
“Well?" demanded the author icily.
“No, it's too frightful,” I bleated.
“Harris, this might conceivably be read
by a real pilot. Heaven forbid, of
course! And he'd simply hate this
scout 'bus with the engine ahead to
change into a ‘pusher' two-seater in
six paragraphs.”
Harris was routed, absolutely de-
moralised. “They told me to put in
lots of flying talk,” he murmured ab-
jectly, “and tons of local colour to
make it lifelike.”
“Yes,” I said grimly, “but this
colour's too local for words.”
“Of course, if you think you could
do it better yourself,” Harris observed
with heavy sarcasm, “well, then
“Certainly,” I agreed heartily. “I
don't mind showing you, Harris, seeing
you're a pal of mine. Just pass the
ink and let your uncle get to work.”
Behold my effort | –

to hack the loaf to pieces with great
vigour.

said a sleepy voice as the throb of an
engine was heard overhead.

served the toast-maker airily. ‘He's
got no right to come at tea-time. In

“‘Oh, will you?' grunted the other.
“What awful rot it is Oh, the devil—
where's my hat?’ and out he plunged.
“Two minutes later he was "...i.

ing thoroughly ill-used, climbed into his
machine.
“The propeller was swung, emitting
one hollow cough.
“‘Switch off. All right, contact.'

membered its manners and started up

the chocks were waved away from the
wheels.
“Within twenty yards he was off the
ground and, throttle wide open, climb-
ing towards the little white dot thou-

“And all the time he was grumbling.
“‘What awful rot it is l I’ve about

“Which is precisely what happened.
The last gift had been thankfully re-
ceived in a ploughed field beneath and
the Hun was turning for home when
the scout struggled to his level.
“The watchers on the ground saw
the small machine press determinedly
towards the bigger and a faint crackle
of gun-fire broke out.
“It was answered by all the guns on
board the enemy craft and the single-
seater wavered undecidedly.
“Then he got his adversary fairly in
his ring sight again and, risking every-
thing, fired burst aſter burst.
“All at once the big machine heeled
over and dived—a flash and a sudden
sheet of flame from the engine and
down dropped the raider, to dash to
pieces in the French fields three miles
below.
“Ten minutes later the British ma-
chine slithered on to the ground and
switched off in front of the sheds.

rushing up excitedly, “that was the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BLANKET ASTRAY.
Now that most of us are on the point
of escaping into civil life, the relent-
less department to whom the W.O.
entrusted the stewardship of Army
blankets is calling us to strict account
as to our dealings with these articles.
Between us and freedom rise the
accusing phantoms of blankets we
signed for and failed to return, blankets
we misused as carpets, curtains and
table-cloths. The bright dawn of the
new era is overcast by their threaten-
ing shadow.
The A.A.L.R.B.G.S.—Acting-Assist-
ant Local Recorder of Blankets General
Service, a very important Hat indeed—
some time last winter paid us a visit
and went away without complaint. We
had specialised in cherishing Blankets
G.S. For fear of loss or damage none
had been issued for use, and the en-
thusiasm of all ranks was so warm
that the men were glad to sleep with-
out them, if only they might go and
see for themselves the full tally of
blankets folded correctly to a hair's-
breadth and piled irreproachably and
unapproachably in the stores.
Then, three days ago, arrived a chit
asking us to explain a curt quotation
from the report of the A.A.L.R.B.G.S.,
to the effect that
“There was a blanket on the table
in the store.”
By a civilian this might be interpreted
as a word of praise for our care of the
table or for the comfortable tout en-
semble of the Quartermaster-Sergeant's
treasure-house; but we know better.
We read it with the sensations of a
householder who, after the call of a
Scotland Yard official, should be invited
to explain, in an otherwise satisfactory
account of his visit, the sentence—
“There was a corpse in the boot
cupboard.”
It suggested criticism, suspicion, dis-
approval. In his dilemma the O.C.
replied as follows:–
“Owing to the fact that, in view of
the paper scarcity, the keeping of Indi-
vidual History Sheets for the Blankets
under my command was discontinued
early in the War, I have found it diffi-
cult to collect evidence. I beg, how-
ever, to submit the likeliest explana-
tions that offer. -
“(1) Possibly the blanket was placed
on the table, folded and compressed
beneath the weight of the various
utensils, literature and stationery neces.
sary to the functioning of a B.Q.M.S.,
in order that the correct regimental
wrinkles, as laid down in the various
handbooks, might be made and main-
tained; the blanket to be used as a
model at lectures to young soldiers on
the care of equipment. -
“(2) The distance between the Main
Blanket Dump and the table under
suspicion is only four feet. It is in
the experience of all familiar with con-
ditions in the Field that blankets with
long service frequently develop extreme
activity. I beg to suggest that the
blanket in question may have absented
itself without leave from the main
dump and proceeded as far as the table
by its own locomotive power.

grounds. I cannot trust my memory,
but possibly the justification of this
recommendation was the N.C.O.'s zeal-
ous care of the property of H.M. THE
KING, in that he sacrificed his own
blanket for the welfare of the table.”
(On paper, of course, our blankets are
issued in the normal way.) “The
weather at the time was inclement,
either (a) wet and dirty or (b) extremely
cold. The N.C.O. was determined that
this table should be protected from the
deleterious effects of (a) moisture likely
to result from the vicinity of the Q.M.S.,
damp from out-door duties or (b) very
low temperature, which is known to
injure such articles of furniture.
“(4) The blanket may have been
known to be likely to try to escape from
custody, and have been placed conspicu-
ously on the table so as to be directly
under the observation of the Q.M.S.
“(5) The table may have intended
illegally to absent itself without leave,
and have concealed itself beneath the
accused blanket in the hope of eluding
the vigilance of the sentries, disguised
as a civilian table, i.e. covered with a
table-cloth. This theory is unlikely,
the table bearing an excellent character
and never having been known to at-
tempt desertion prºbe in any way guilty
of conduct contrary to good order and
military discipline.
“(6) The Storeman—now demobi-
lised and dispersed—may have com-
mitted the irregularity suggested, with
the idea of increasing the amenity of the
stores during the inspection, as a hum-
ble compliment to the A.A.L.R.B.G.S.
“(7) No. 55,442, Procter, Mary, a
member of the Q.M.A.A.C., may be
correct in her statement that the arti-
cle described as a ‘blanket' was not
a blanket, but a rug, travelling. She
says she is ‘in a position to know this,'
as the article is her own property, and
supports the claim by demonstrating
the presence of her initials embroidered

HERE's a lady come to town
Puts us all to shame;
Walking in with noiseless feet,
Very light and very fleet,
Over-night she came.
Not a beauty in the land,
Though she knew no peer
Both for comeliness and grace,
But must take a second place—
The snow is here.
Never monarch wore, I swear,
Such a radiant dress;
All the whitenesses we prize
Suddenly before our eyes
Turn to dinginess.
Gone are all the shining joys
That we held so dear;
Linens, marbles, gleaming plumes
We must hide in shadowed glooms—
The snow is here.
Weil your brows, you pretty maids,
With your falling curls;
Should you venture forth to-day
Tuck your milky throats away,
Cover up your pearls.
Naught shall match your loveliness
Later in the year
(Who so foolish as to dare
Say the lily is more fair?)
But—the snow is here. R. F.

THE Leicester Galleries for laughter
just now ! For the walls of the inner
room are hung with drawings by Mr.
H. M. BATEMAN, not a few of which—
such as “The Leave Wangler,” and
“The Man who Clung to the Railings,”
and “The Infectious Hornpipe"—have
already rejoiced the readers of Punch.
Mr. BATEMAN's appeal is double, for,
having enjoyed his broad or subtle
farce and his keen satirical observa-
tions, one may turn to the admiration
of his technique, or vice versa. He did
not invent the idea of the humorous
sequence—the accumulative pictorial
comedy; CARAN D'ACHE had come
before, and before CARAN D'AchE was
WILHELM BUSCH, the German ; but
he has made it his own to-day. Some
of his series are irresistible. As a
delineator of types, accurate beneath
the caricature, he is deadly; particu-
larly, perhaps, when he turns his atten-
tion to the Senior Service. But his
Brigadiers and his Clubmen are also
always within an ace of being identi-
fiable.
For anyone in the dumps Mr. Punch
prescribes a speedy visit to the Leicester
Galleries. –

Mabel (to newly-married sister). “You DoN'T MIND ME STILL CALLING You ‘SYBIL,” Do You?”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. John GALsworthy is a most deceptive writer. He
lures a reader on by a display of gentleness and smoothness
and moderation, and then turns on him and makes it plain
that he is really a most provocative fellow and is engaged in
matching his mind against yours. He tries to commit you
to some such statement as this: “The allegiance of the
workman in time of peace is not rendered to the State, but
to himself and his own class.” Or this: “I think editors,
journalists, old gentlemen and women will be brutalised
[by the War] in larger numbers than our soldiers.” Or
this: “This is at once a spiritual link with America
and yet one of the great barriers to friendship between
the two peoples. We are not sure whether we are
better men than Americans.” Or this : “My mind is
open, and when one says that, one generally means that
it is shut.” Disconcerting, very, and all to be found in
Another Sheaf (HEINEMANN). Mr. GALsworthy's chief
object in his little book is to arouse us to the disgrace and
destruction of our State and race if we continue to allow
ourselves to be fed, not by our own resources, but by alien
corn and meat, which may so easily become hostile corn
and meat. Incidentally Mr. GALsworthy finds that we
are in the mass far too ugly. For instance, how few of us
have chiselled nostrils! We ought not to eat so much pure
white flour.
On the second page of The Secret City (MACMILLAN) Mr.
HUGH WALPole (or, to be meticulously correct, Durward,
into whose mouth the story is put) says that “there is no
Russian alive for whom this book can have any kind of
value except as a happy example of the mistakes that the
Englishman can make about the Russian.” Well, after
finishing the book, which is in some ways a sequel to The
Dark Forest, I felt so very disinclined to believe this state-
ment that I consulted a Russian, who is very much alive,
and received the opinion that, if Mr. WALPoLE has not suc-
ceeded in drawing the real average Russian, he has given
us a type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the
situation as it is to-day. Such an opinion is worth a
thousand times more than any judgment of mine, and I am
glad of the opportunity to record it. From a literary point
of view it seems to me that Mr. WALPoLE, in allowing
Durward to tell the tale, has created innumerable difficulties
for himself—difficulties which to a great extent have been
cleverly overcome, but which nevertheless make the story
wobble dangerously and once or twice threaten it with
devastation. To me, however, the interest never really
flagged, for granted that one has a sympathy with Russia
one feels acutely what Mr. WALPole is aiming at and how
wonderfully he succeeds. It is not difficult to find faults:
to complain, for instance, that a strong man like Semyonov
would not have taken such elaborate measures to get him-
self killed; but these points are trivial in a book which is
not to be read so much for its story as for its idea. And
the idea is great.
Rollo Johnson was incautious enough to be born the
natural son of a peer. This fact caused just sufficient
complications to keep MARY L. PENDERED's latest story,
The Silent Battlefield (CHAPMAN AND HALL), from any
threat of stagnation while she was developing the theme
that really intrigued her. This was the struggle between
increasing wealth and early-acquired Socialism as it arose
in the mind of a hero working his way up from poverty to
millionairedom, a seat in the House and the opportunity of
hobnobbing with lords, suffragettes and other notables.
When I say that the two sides of the Socialist case are pre-

sented with rather uncommon fairness you may think that
is only because my own particular creed is upheld; but
really and truly I was frowning quite as much as purring
while the silent battle proceeded, and the end is neutral
enough to bring despair to all true believers. Lest you
should suppose the book all made up of election addresses |
I hasten to add that, in the quiet and thoughtful way one
expects of the author, the story is a good one, the pictures
of a small country town are true to life, and the characters
without exception real creatures of flesh and blood. Re-
membering the puppets that so often have been made to
represent their country in a political novel, this is saying
more than a little, and if it is true that, among the ladies
of the cast, one still finds those the most attractive who
have no pronounced opinions to speak or vote about, no
doubt this is just old prejudice, and, anyway, the book is
one that can be heartily commended.
made her acquaintance in some previous book. But my real
quarrel with Mr. Fox is that he has only given walking-on
parts to the actors who do best when such tales are told
upon the screen—I mean the horses.
When it is granted that books on flying by fliers have
at present a peculiar fascination, the fact still remains
that what I will call The Library of Aviation has usually
been remarkably fortunate in its contributors. Cavalry
of the Air (SIMPKIN, MARSHALL) is the last flying work
which it has been my good fortune to read, and the only
conceivable reason for finding fault with it is that “FLIGHT
CoMMANDER” occasionally becomes a little facetious. But
when that small complaint is made I have nothing left
except praise. The author was first of all an Observer—or,
as he calls it, a “Shock Absorber"—in France, and he
describes his life so that we groundlings may understand
and sympathise with every phase of it. Especially I like

is laid spiritually, if not strictly geographically, in that part
of the continent of America which everybody who has
gone to a cinema, hoping against hope, knows so well. I
mean the country where people have “shooting irons” and
use them on the slightest provocation to insist that other
people shall carry their hands at an absurd and wearisome
elevation, and all the men wear fringy trousers, and all the
women shawls, save the heroine, who has to be suitably
arrayed for the performance of athletic feats. I admit that I
didn't feel quite at home In Happy Valley, because I missed
the sheriff and his posse, and nobody held up the stage-coach;
still the young doctor and the school teacher and the ladies
at the mission did their best for me, and I found it a great
help to know the language, an attainment of which I am
justifiably a little vain, for not everyone could translate at
sight to “thud" the road or “shoot up” a Christmas party.
Mr. John Fox, Junr., has not placed his largest strawberries
—and some of them are quite nice ones—at the top of the
basket. His first story did not attract me as much as others
further on, such as, for instance, that excellently humorous
one, “The Angel from Viper,” though here and in other
places a lady called St. Hilda, obviously not she of Whitby,
conſused me a little. I fancy that we were supposed to have
second part of his book he tells us of his training as a pilot;
and here he gives information which deserves to be most
thoroughly studied. The illustrations by Mr. GEOFFREY
WATson add to the charm of this attractive volume. Of
another contribution to the literature of the air which lies
before me I cannot speak so well. Lieut.-Colonel CURTIES
has an inventive mind, and in Blake of the R.F.C. (SKEFF-
INGTON) he uses it unsparingly. But although I am ready
to believe almost anything in a book of this kind, I am
bound to confess that I found myself bewildered by this
breathless romance, Indeed the pace is so hot at the
outset that even the author seems to have lost control of it.
If, however, you are craving for excitement you will find it
here. The scene is laid in Cairo, and we all know that
funny things happen in that city. Not the least funny
thing that happened to the characters in this story was
the careless ease with which they drank whisky-and-soda.
But this—let me warn you—happened nearly two years ago.

THE auctioneer glanced at his book. “Number 29,” he
said, “black mare, aged, blind in near eye, otherwise
sound.” -
The cold rain and the biting north-east wind did not add
to the appearance of Number 29, as she stood, dejected,
listless, with head drooping, in the centre of the farmers
and horse-dealers who were attending the sale of cast Army
horses. She looked as though she realised that her day had
waned, and that the bright steel work, the soft well-greased
leather, the snowy head-rope and the shining curb were to
be put aside for less noble trappings.
She had a curiously shaped white blaze, and I think it
was that, added to the description of her blindness, which
stirred my memory within me. I closed my eyes for a
second and it all came back to me, the gun stuck in the
mud, the men straining at the wheels, the shells bursting,
the reek of high explosive, the two leaders lying dead on
the road, and, above all, two gallant horses doing the work
of four and pulling till you'd think their hearts would
burst.
I stepped forward and, looking closer at the mare's neck,
found what I had expected, a great scar. That settled it.
I approached the auctioneer and asked permission to speak
to the crowd for a few moments.
“Well,” said he, “I’m supposed to do the talking here,
you know.”
“It won't do you any harm,” I pleaded, “and it will give
me a chance to pay off a big debt.”
“Right,” he said, smiling; “carry on.”
“Gentlemen,” I said, “about this time a year ago I was
commanding a battery in France. It was during the bad
days, and we were falling back with the Hun pressing hard
upon us. My guns had been firing all the morning from a
sunken road, when we got orders to limber up and get back
to a rear position. We hadn't had a bad time till then, a
few odd shells, but nothing that was meant especially for
our benefit. And then, just as we were getting away, they
spotted us, and a battery opened on us good and strong.
By a mixture of good luck and great effort we'd got all the
guns away but one, when a shell landed just in front of the
leaders and knocked them both out with their driver; at
the same time the gun was jerked off the road into a muddy
ditch. Almost simultaneously another shell killed one of
the wheelers, and there we were with one horse left to get
the gun out of the ditch and along a road that was almost
as bad as the ditch itself. -
“It looked hopeless, and it was on the tip of my tongue
to give orders to abandon the gun, when suddenly out of
the blue there appeared on the bank above us a horse,
looking unconcernedly down at us. -
“In those days loose horses were straying all over
the country, and I took this to be one from another
battery which had come to us for company. - *
“I turned to one of the men. “Catch that mare quick.’
“In a few minutes we had the harness off the dead
wheeler and on the new-comer. Pull? Gentlemen, if you
could have seen those two horses pull !
“We'd just got a move on the gun when another shell
came and seemed to burst right on top of the strange
mare. I heard a terrified squeal, and through the smoke
I saw her stagger and with a mighty effort recover her-
self. I ran round and saw she'd been badly hit over the
eye and had a great tearing gash in the neck. We never
thought she could go on, but she pulled away just the
same, with the blood pouring off her, till finally we got the
gun out and down the road to safety. -
“I got knocked out a few minutes later, and from that
day to this I’ve often wondered what had happened to the
mare that had served us so gallantly. I know now. There
she stands before you. I'd know her out of a thousand by
the white blaze; and if there was a doubt there's her blind
eye and the scar on her neck. -
“That's all, gentlemen; but I'm going to ask the man
who buys her to remember her story and to see that her
last days are not too hard.” . -
She fell at a good price to a splendid type of West
Country farmer, and the auctioneer whispered to me, “I’m
glad old Carey's got her. There's not a man in the county
keeps his horses better.” -
“Old Carey” came up to me as we were moving off. “I
had a son in France,” he said, “in the gunners, too, but he
hadn't the luck of the old mare"—he hesitated a moment
and his old eyes looked steadily into mine—“for he'll
never come back. The mare'll be all right, Sir,” he
went on as he walked off, “easy work and full rations. I
reckon she's earned them.”
“The bride was given away by her grandfather who was dressed
in Liberty satin in empire style, with hanging sleeves of chiffon.”

Echo of THE TUBE strike.
“TAKE YER UP. To THE CITY FOR ALF-A-QUID, GUv'Nort.”
THE ACUTE ANGLER.
THE Colonel of our Reserve Bat-
talion has an almost unique reputation
as an angler. Scattered elements of
the regiment carry his piscatorial he-
roics to obscure corners of the earth.
Majors on the Pushti Kuli range re-
count the episode of the ingenuous
troutling which, having apparently con-
ceived a violent passion for the Colonel,
literally forced itself upon the hook
seven times within a short afternoon.
Captains on the Sultanitza Planina
rehearse the epic incidents of how the
Colonel snatched victory from defeat
after pursuing for three miles an in-
furiated pike which had wrenched the
very rod from his grasp. Subalterns
in the chill wilds of Cologne, adding
picturesque details to an already artis-
tic story, relate how he hooked a
mighty veteran carp near Windsor,
and played it for nine full hours (with
a rest of ten minutes after the first,
and five after each successive hour);
how, under a full moon, he eventually
grounded it on the Blackfriars' mud
and beached it with a last effort; how
they lay panting side by side for a
space, and how, finally, with the cour-
|tesy due to an honourable foe from a
gallant victor, he forced neat brandy
down its throat and returned it to its
domain in a slightly inebriated but
wholly grateful condition.
Consequently the Colonel's announce-
ment that in view of the armistice he
intended to spend three days in fishing
the waters of a friend's estate was re-
ceived by the Mess with lively satis-
faction. An overwhelming fish diet
was deprecated, but it was generally
held that the honour of the regiment was
in some way involved, and the Major
felt it his duty to escort his senior officer
on an expedition of such gravity.
It transpired that the first day was
unfortunate. The Colonel was silently
impolite throughout Mess and retired
immediately afterwards. The Major
explained that the conditions had been
adverse. The punt leaked at the end
depressed by the Colonel and the
ground-bait had been left behind. The
wind was fierce and cutting, and the
brandlings had been upset into the
luncheon - basket. In addition the
Colonel's reel had escaped into the river
and had declined to give itself up until
the whole length of line had been hauled
in ; and, in leaning over the side to
reclaim it, his gold fountain-pen had
vanished. Five hooks had failed to
return from the deep and two were left
suspended from inaccessible branches.
Also in the Major's opinion there was
not a single fish in the river.
By breakfast the Colonel had re-
gained his spirits. He commented on
the lack of support given him by the
Major, and in his place invited the
Adjutant on the ground that he was
probably less clumsy. He remarked
that the offensive had not yet opened
and that the previous day had been
mainly devoted to a thorough recon-
naissance of the whole sector. He
had reason to believe that the enemy
was present in considerable force.
The second day proved equally un-
fortunate. The Colonel took his dinner
in private, and the Mess orderly, who
had dismally cut the two of clubs in
the kitchen, returned from his ministra-
tions a complete nervous wreck. The
Adjutant explained that misfortune had
followed misfortune. They had barely
settled down midstream, and he was
in the act of extracting a hook from
the Colonel's finger with his jack-knife,
when the punt broke from its moorings
and carried them half-a-mile down-

stream. It was uncanny how the
craft had contrived to navigate four
bends without giving an opportunity
of landing. In the afternoon they had
fished from the bank, and the Colonel
had fallen asleep while the Adjutant
mounted guard. The Adjutant pro-
tested that it was not his fault that
the float suddenly disappeared, or that
the Colonel, on being vigorously awak-
ened by him, struck so violently at what
proved to be a dead branch that he lost
his footing and tobogganned heavily
into the river, and was compelled to
waste three hours in the neighbouring
hostelry taking precautions against a
chill.
At breakfast next morning the
Colonel intimated that on this his
last day he would go unaccompanied.
With one eye on the Major and the
other on the Adjutant, he passed a few
remarks on the finesse of fishing. The
element of surprise should be the basis
of attack. Precision and absolute se-
crecy in the carrying out of preliminary
operations was vital. Every trick and
every device of camouflage should be
brought into play. There should be
no violent preliminary bombardment
of ground-bait to alarm the hostile
forces, but the sector should be unos-
tentatiously registered on the preceding
night. The enemy's first realisation
of attack should be at that moment
when resistance was futile—though for
his part he preferred a foe that would
fight to the fish-basket, as it were. He
thought the weather was vastly im-
proved and admitted that his hopes
were high.
In the evening the Colonel positively
swaggered into Mess. He radiated
good fellowship and even bandied
witticisms with the junior subaltern in
an admirable spirit of give-and-take.
He had enjoyed excellent sport. Later,
in the ante-room, he delivered a useful
little homily on the surmounting of
obstacles, on patience, on presence of
mind and on nerve, copiously illus-
trated from a day's triumph that will
resound on the Murman coast as the
unconditional surrender of the intimi-
dated roach. He described how he
had cunningly outmanoeuvred the pa-
trols, defeated the vigilance of the
pickets, pierced the line of resistance,
launched a surprise attack on the main
body, and spread panic in the hearts of
the hostile legions.
Unhappily for us, common decency,
he said, had forced him to present his
catch to his friend.

THE TWOPENNY BIN.
IT was called Greatheart; or, Samuel's
Sentimental Side; and I think you will
agree that it was a lot of title for two-
pence. Day after day, as I fumbled
among the old books in the Twopenny
Bin of the little secondhand bookseller's
shop, that volume would wriggle itself
forward and worm its way into my
hands; and I would clench my teeth
and thrust it to the remotest depths of
the box.
Then it haunted me. All day in my
room I could hear Greatheart; or,
Samuel's Sentimental Side calling out
to me, “How would you like to be in
the Twopenny Bin 2"
I began to grow sentimental myself,
and to handle those unconsidered trifles
with tenderness. For you never know;
I might be in the Twopenny Bin my-
self some day; might be picked up, just
glanced at and shifted back into the
corner out of sight. -
Yesterday Greatheart again found
himself in my hands, and I looked to
see the date of his entry upon the
world. I reflected on his sixty years of
life, on the many happy fireside hours
that had been spent in his company,
on the gentle solace he had furnished
to lesser hearts.
I had decided what to do. There
were few people about; the bookseller
was not looking, and, if offence it was,
well, I could fall back on the mercy of
those who would judge.
I leaned forward and tenderly de-
posited him in the Fourpenny Bin.

Perseus. “OH, JUST A HoBBY. BUT, BETWEEN OURSELVEs, IT’s THE MEDUSA's HEAD THAT DoEs IT. TURNs PEoPLE INTo STONE,
AND THERE YOU ARE.”
TO A DEAR DEPARTED.
[“Georgima,” the largest of the giant tortoises at the Zoo, has died.
She was believed to be about two hundred and fifty years old.]
WINDs blow cold and the rain, Georgina,
Beats and gurgles on roof and pane;
Over the Gardens that once were green a
Shadow stoops and is gone again;
Only a sob in the wild swine's squeal,
Only the bark of the plunging seal,
Only the laugh of the striped hyaena
Muffled with poignant pain.
Long ago, in the mad glad May days,
Woo'd I one who was with us still;
Bade him wake to the world's blithe heydays,
Leap in joyance and eat his fill;
Sang I, sweet as the bright-billed ousel, a
Paean of praise for thy pal, Methuselah.
Ah! he too in the Winter's grey days
Died of the usual chill.
He was old when the Reaper beckoned,
Ripe for the paying of Nature's debt;
Forty score—if he'd lived a second—
Years had flown, but he lingered yet;
But you had gladdened this vale of tears
For a bare two hundred and fifty years;
You, Georgina, we always reckoned
One of the younger set.
Winter's cold and the influenza
Wreaked and ravaged the ranks among;
Bills that babbled a gay cadenza,
Snouts that snuffled and claws that clung--
Now they whistle and root and run
In Happy Valleys beyond the sun;
Never back to the ponds and pens a
Sigh of regret is flung.
Flaming parrots and pink flamingoes,
Birds of Paradise, frail as fair;
Monkeys talking a hundred lingoes,
Ring-tailed lemur and Polar bear—
Somehow our grief was not profound
When they passed to the Happy Hunting
Ground;
Deer and ducks and yellow dog dingoes
Croaked, but we did not care.
But you—ah, you were our pride, our treasure,
Care-free child of a kingly race.
Undemonstrative 2 Yes, in a measure,
But every movement replete with grace.
Whiles we mocked at the monkeys' tricks
Or pored apart on the apteryx;
These could yield but a passing pleasure;
Yours was the primal place.
How our little ones' hearts would flutter
When your intelligent eye peeped out,
Saying as plainly as words could utter,
“Hurry up with that Brussels-sprout !”
How we chortled with simple Joy
When you bit that impudent errand-boy;
“That'll teach him,” we heard you mutter,
“Whether I've got the gout.”
Fairest, rarest in all the Zoo, you
Bound us tight in affection's bond;
Now you're gone from the friends that knew
Ou,
waii. the whaup in the Waders' Pond ;
Wails the whaup and the seamews keen a
Song of sorrow; but you, Georgina,
Frisk for ever where warm winds woo you,
There, in the Great Beyond. ALGOL.

Sergeant.
“SLOSHER, SLABBER AND wuzzER, SIR.”
A CONTRA APPRECIATION.
LoRD NorthcLIFFE has recently con-
tributed a remarkably outspoken criti-
cism of Mr. LLoyd GEoRGE by way of
“send-off” to his latest journal, The
New Illustrated. The following ex-
tracts from an article about to appear
in The Pacific Monthly, kindly com-
municated to us by wireless, seem to
indicate that the PREMIER is indisposed
to take it lying down –
“In a letter recently published with-
out my authority I said that I was
unable to control or influence him.
This was true at the time and remains
true now. Time and again have efforts
been made to harness his energies to
the State, but they have never suc-
ceeded. The responsibilities of office
are irksome to his imperious tempera-
ment. There is something almost
tragic in a figure, equipped with the
qualities of an hereditary autocrat, en-
deavouring to accommodate himself to
the needs of a democracy. The spectacle
of this purple Emperor of the Press,
with his ear constantly glued to the
ground, is not wanting in pathos. With
him the idols of yesterday are the pet
aversions of to-day. He denounces me
as “a political chameleon, taking on
the colour of those who at the moment
happen to be his associates.' But what
are you to say of a man who clamours
for a saviour of the situation and then
turns him into a cock-shy; of a Napo-
leon who is continually retiring to
Elba when things are not going as he
likes; of a politician who claims the
privileges but refuses the duties of a
Dictator 2
“It is obvious that he is still labour-
ing under the hallucination that the
War was a duel between him and the
KAIser; that he ‘downed ' his an-
tagonist single-handed, and that the
prospects of a stable peace have been
shattered by my failure to include him
among the British Peace Delegates.
So, all in a moment, the ‘Welsh Wizard'
is converted into the miserable creature
of the Tory Junkers—a man without
‘high moral courage,' 'wide knowledge'
or “large ideas.'
“Personally I have no illusions about
my consistency, but I do think that
here I displayed some moral courage,
also some unselfish consideration for
CLEMENCEAU and WILsoN and others.
Just think of the panegyrics that would
have been showered upon my head in
the Press which he controls if he had
been invited to the Table !
“But with all deductions he is a man
to be reckoned with, if not counted upon.
He is a man of large type — almost
of “Pica” type. And sometimes he
deviates into sound and just criticism;
as for example when he says that I “de-
pend greatly upon others.' It is true.
What is more, I know on whom I can
depend; and I have learnt that his
support can only be secured on terms
which would reduce the PREMIER to
the level of one of his minor editors.”

NOUVELLES DE PARIS.
(With acknowledgments to the
“Society.” Press).
Paris, Feb., 1919.
DEAREST Poppy, Que la vie est
dróle / Who was it said that there are
two great tragedies in life—not getting
what you want, and getting it? I
never understood that saying until
now. For instance, when I left London
most people I knew seemed to have
a feverish desire to get to Paris. They
were ready to move heaven, earth and
the Ministry of Information to obtain
the desired passport. They would go
to any lengths to prove how necessary
their presence is here during the Peace
Conference.
And now I find my countrymen over
here longing with an equal feverish-
ness to go home again. Ils s'attristent.
Ils s'enmuient. They have mostalgie in
its acutest form. It quite goes to my
heart to hear the pathetic questions
they put to newcomers: “How is
London looking 2 What shows are
running now?" And they go on to
speak of dear dirty dark London, its
beloved fogs, how adorable is the
atrocious climate of England, in a way
that would bring tears to your eyes.
Why don't they go back? you ask, ma
chère. It's just because they want to
be “in at the death" and say they
were here when la pair 6tait signée.
So these poor exiles continue to
sacrifice themselves and drift aimlessly
about Paris, making it so full that
there's scarcely room for people like
myself—who really are on important
work here—to breathe.
Imagine! I met Eleanor Dashgood
on the Boulevard Haussmann to-day,
descending from her car with her two
poms yapping at her heels, just as if
she were chez elle. I really felt like
saying something pointed; but, after
all, my only comment was, “My dear,
what a strange lot of people one meets
in Paris nowadays!”
“Yes, dearest,” she said, “that just
occurred to me, too.” I'm wondering
now what the creature meant. Believe
me, my dear, that woman has illegally
wangled a passport out of the authori-
ties by representing herself as her
husband's typist—he's got a diplo-
matic passport, you know. I inquired
if the maid she had brought with her
had turned into a typist, too, to say
nothing of the poms. The toupet of
some people!
And, of course, all this unnecessary
rabble is helping to make everything
horriblement cher. The price of things
makes one's hair stand on end like the
quills of the fretful porcupine. I can
assure you that le moindre petit diner
collte les yeuz de la tête. Poor Bobbie
Lacklands had a tragic experience
yesterday. He said he quite un-
thinkingly dropped into that most
recherché of eating places, Fouquet's,
for a snack. With only a modest
balance at the bank he ordered a
sardine. Then he called for a filet
mignon and half-a-pint of vin rouge—he
was always a reckless spendthrift sort
of boy, you know. A cup of café moir
and an apple completed his financial
ruin.
But he still declares that they were
most awfully decent to him about it.
They agreed, with scarcely any trouble,
to take all the notes and loose silver
he had with him on account. They
accepted his securities and are now
allowing him to pay off the balance
gradually.
Paris is beginning to think of dress
once more, or I ought to say undress,
for with the skirts short and the
sleeves short and the bodice low there
isn't very much left to write about.
I hope these short tight skirts will
reach the ankles before they reach
England, for I notice the people who
have the courage to wear them gener-
ally lack the excuse of symmetry.
Figurez-vous ! Jenny Bounceley, who
considers herself quite a Parisienne
now she's got her official carte d'ali-
mentation, appeared the other day in
a skirt that resembled the jupe of a
gamine. I think it's disgraceful in one
of her age and proportions. If she were
simply knock-kneed; but, as Bertie
says, she's knock-ankled as well.
Wotre bien dévouée, ANNE.
“RUMANIA REDIDIVU.S.”
East African Standard.
To judge from the rumours of revolu-
tion, this false concord is only too apt.
“Music was supplied and enjoyed by a local
orchestra.”—Provincial Paper.
This phenomenon has frequently been
observed; the audience meanwhile con-
tinuing its conversation.
“Colonel Sir Rhys Williams, who wore his
khaki uniform, moved the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne . . .
It was not the glamour of war, Mr. Rhys
Williams continued . . .”—Evening Standard.
It is refreshing to come across a case of
really rapid demobilisation.
“A message from Vienna states that the
Fmperor Carl intends to be a candidate in
the forthcoming elections for the Australian
National Assembly.”—Australian Paper.
But there is no truth in the rumour
that, by way of reprisal, Mr. HUGHEs
intends to put in for CARL's vacant
throne.
RIME FAIRIES.
LAST night about the country-side
The nimble fairies flew,
And forests on the latticed pane
In quaint devices drew,
The grasses standing straight and tall,
The ferns with curious frond,
And just a peephole left to show
The misty world beyond.
The voices of the murmuring streams
They silenced one by one,
And bound their feet with gleaming
chains
So they no more could run;
They hung the icicles about,
And you would laugh to see
Just how they flung the diamonds down
Upon the whole bare tree;
And every little blade of grass
A thing of beauty stood,
And when they'd finished it was just
Like an enchanted wood.
They paused beside the old barn door;
A spider's web hung there
As fragile as a little dream,
As delicate and fair;
They decked it with a thousand gems
Of oh! such dazzling sheen,
It was the very loveliest thing
That you have ever seen!
The sun from his soft bed of cloud
Came pale and timidly;
He knew if he let loose his rays
The mischief there would be ;
He woke the sleeping world to life
With finger-tips of gold,
And up from meadow, wood and stream
The shimmering mists unrolled;
He lit the candles of the dawn
On every bush and tree;
The fairies on their homing wings
Looked back and laughed with glee,
“We've made a Fairyland for you,
O Mortals, wake and see.”
“It is also extremely likely that the Domo-
crats have induced a considerable number of
former Centre voters in South Germany to join
them.”—Christian World.
“Domocrats” would seem to be the
German equivalent of “Home Rulers.”

sibly le dernier cri.
“It is like a red rag to a bull to the 'bus
drivers to see those lorries running about
picking up members of the public.
We are trying to keep our heads, but our
shoulders are bending under the pressure, and
presently, I am afraid, we shall collapse and
find ourselves in the vortex.”—Daily Paper.
We should like to see this situation illus-
trated. Would some Vorticist oblige?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, February 11th-The KING's
Speech outlined a programme of legisla-
tion which would in the ordinary way
occupy two or three Sessions. But the
Parliamentary machinery is to be ruth-
lessly speeded up and “a short cut to
the Millennium” is to be discovered
by way of the Committee-rooms. Pre-
cisians observed with regret that the
customary reference in the Speech to
“economy” had by some oversight
been omitted; and the prospective
creation of several additional Depart-
ments led Lord CREWE to express ap-
prehension lest the country should be
"doped" with new Ministries, to the
detriment of the national health.
| “Where are they gone, the old
familiar faces?” was the question one
asked oneself on looking at the crowded
benches of the House of Commons. It
was said of a Past President of the
|United States that he was the politest
man in America—“he gave up his seat
in a street-car and made room for four
ladies.” The gap made on the Front
| Opposition Bench by the involuntary
retirement of Mr.Asquith—to which
generous allusion was made by the
| PRIME MINISTER—is so vast that the
joint efforts of Sir DoNALD MACLEAN
and Mr. ADAMsoN to fill it met with
only partial success. Unless, by the
way, Mr. SPEAKER definitely decides
the problem of precedence, it is to be
feared that the hoped-for accelera-
tion of business will not occur, for
at present each of them thinks it
necessary to speak whenever the
other does, like the hungry lions
on Afric's burning shore. For all
their outward politeness I am sure
“the first lion thinks the last a
bore”; and if they insist on roaring
together much longer the House º
will think it of both of them.
The corner - seat whence Mr.
PRINGLE flung his barbed darts at
the Government is filled, physi-
cally, by Mr.STANToN. Lonely Mr.
Hogg|E now sits uneasily upon the
Front Opposition Bench, but, fear- \\
ing perhaps lest its dignified tra-
ditions should cramp his style,
makes frequentvisits to the Lobby.
In accordance with ancient cus-
tom Sir CourtENAY ILBERT as-
serted the right of the House to
initiate legislation by calling out
| “Outlawries Bill" in the middle
of the SPEAKER's recital of the
Sessional Orders. Some of the
new Members, Ifancy, took the in-
terruption seriously, and thought
that this was the outcome of the
“Punish the KAISER" movement.

finish. .
The lot of a Labour leader just now
is not a happy one. Perhaps that
accounted for the querulous tone as-
sumed by Mr. ADAMSON, who seemed

more concerned with the omissions in
the KING's Speech than with its con-
tents. His best sayings were imported
from America, but he would have done
better to content himself with LINcolN
and abjure BRYAN, whose “cross-of-
gold" fustian will not bear repetition.
After Sir DoNALD MACLEAN had
thoughtfully provided a welcome tea
interval the PRIME MINISTER rose to
reply to his critics. The accusation
that he had forgotten some of his
recent promises, such as “No Con-
scription,” “Punish the Kaiser,” and
“Germany must pay,” did not trouble
him much. If these election-eggs had
hatched out prematurely and the con-
tents were coming home to roost at an
inconvenient moment he had no time
to attend to them. What the country
most needs at the moment is a firm
clear statement on the Labour troubles,
and that is what it got. So far as
those troubles are due to remediable
causes they shall be remedied; so far
as the demands of Labour are based
upon class-greed they shall be fought
tooth and nail. There were a few
dissentient shouts from the Opposition
Benches, but the House as a whole
was delighted when the PREMIER in
ringing tones declared that “no section,
however powerful, will be allowed to
hold up the whole nation.”
Wednesday, February 12th. — The
Lords had a brisk little debate on agri-
culture. Lord LINcoLNSHIRE paid many
compliments to Lord ERNLE for
what he had accomplished as
Mr. PROTHERo, but could not un-
derstand why, having exchanged
the green benches for the red,
he should have reversed his old
policy, “scrapped” the agricul-
tural committees and begun to
dispose of his tractors. Lord
ERNLE, in the measured tones
so suitable to the Upper House,
made a good defence of the
change. The chief thing wanted
now was to “clean the land,”
where noxious weeds, the Bolshe-
vists of the soil, had been spread-
ing with great rapidity. As for
the tractors, the Board thought
it a good thing that the farmers
should possess their own, but
would retain in its own hands
enough of them to help farmers
who could not help themselves

as sheer Kaiserism. Up got Sir DoNALD
MACLEAN to defend it as commonsense,
though he induced Mr. Bonan LAw to
limit its duration to the end of March.
Colonel WEDGwood pleaded that private
Members might still be allowed to
bring in Bills under the Ten Minutes'
Rule; but that Parliamentary pundit,
Sir F. BANBURY, asserted that there
was no such thing in reality as the
Ten Minutes' Rule, and pictured the
possibility of whole days being swal-
lowed up by a succession of private
Members commending their legislative
bantlings one after another with the
brief explanatory statement permitted
on such occasions. Alarmed at the
prospect Mr. LAw decided not
to admit the thin end of the
WEDGwooD.
The debate on the Address
was resumed by Mr. Bottom-
LEY, who had a large audience.
During his previous member-
ship, terminated by one of those
periodical visits to the Law
Courts to which he made
humorous reference, he de-
livered some capital speeches;
and it was pleasant to find
that the necessity of constantly
producing “another powerful
article next week” has not
caused him to lose his oratori-
cal form. His gestures are
slightly reminiscent of the
action of the common pump-
handle, but his voice is excel-
lent, and his matter has the
merit of exactly resembling
what our old friend “the Man
in the Street” would say in
less Parliamentary language.
He has no hesitations, for ex-
ample, on the subject of making
Germany pay. By one of those
rapid financial calculations for
which he is renowned he has arrived at
the comfortable figure of ten thousand
millions sterling as Britain's little bill;
and if you express doubts as to the
debtor's capacity to pay he replies that
he cannot recall any judge who made
an order against him ever prefacing his
judgment with an inquiry whether it
would be convenient for him to find
the money. -
Payment in kind is Mr. RoNALD
McNEILL's prescription. Let Leipzig
library replenish the empty shelves of
Louvain and the windows of Cologne
make good—so far as German glass
can do it — the shattered glories of
Rheims.
Mr. CLYNES warned the Government
against neglecting the legitimate aspi-
rations of Labour, one of which, he had
the courage to affirm, was access to
more and better beer. He also sought
a clear statement of the Government's
policy in Russia. This request was re-
peated by Sir SAMUEL HoARE, who,
having spent a year and a half during
the War in that distracted country,
declared that “we must decide between
Bolshevists and anti-Bolshevists.” Un-
fortunately that is exactly what, ac-
cording to the PRIME MINISTER's reply,
we cannot do. The Allies are not pre-
pared to intervene in force; they cannot
leave Russia to stew in her own hell-
broth. The proposed Conference is ad-
mittedly a pis-aller; and, if it ever meets,
no one can feel very hopeful of a tangible
result from the deliberations of the
Prinkipotentiaries.
ICLEMENTARY ECONOMICS.
Thursday, February 13th. — Labour
unrest produced a capital debate, in
which Mr. BRACE, Mr. THOMAs and
Mr. SExTon made excellent speeches
on the one side, and Major TRYoN, Mr.
REMER (an employer and a profit-sharer)
and Mr. BoNAR LAw were equally effec-
tive on the other. Brushing aside minor
causes the Leader of the House, in his
forthright manner, said the root of the
matter was that “Labour wants a larger
share of the good things which are to
be obtained in this world"—not an
unreasonable desire, he indicated, but
one which would not be permanently
realised by strikes directed against the
whole community. Mr. SEDDON, of the
National Democratic Party, compressed
the same argument into an epigram.
If the miners' full demands were con-
ceded they would have “an El Dorado
for one minute and disaster the next.”
FROST AND THAW.
I was earlier than usual that morn-
ing, which was bad luck, as I heard
Fitz-Jones click his gate behind me
and thud after me in his snow-boots.
Fitz-Jones and I had a little disagree-
ment, not long ago, about the sole
possession of a servant-maid. Since
then there has been a coolness. Curi-
ously enough, the hideous frost that
raged at the moment (the thermometer
stood at twenty-five degrees in the hen-
house) seemed to thaw Fitz-Jones. And
I knew why.
Last summer Fitz-Jones had spent
four torrid days with the thermometer
at 75 degrees, winding up his
pipes in straw “against "the
winter. 1 had seen his purple
face as I hammocked it with
an iced drink. He had seen
and heard me laugh.
“Ah,” he croaked, “you may
laugh on the other side of the
hedge now, but you'll laugh
on the other side of your face
later.”
So now I knew that he was
thudding after me in the snow,
bursting to hear that my pipes
had burst or were about to
burst.
“Hallo, Browne,” he began,
“how d'you like this?”
“Oh, all right,” I said airily.
Here I did a wonderful step.
Slide on the right heel—hesi-
tation shuffle on the left toe—
two half slips sideways. Wave
both arms — backward bend.
Recover. Jazz-tangle -tickle-
toe was nothing to it.
“Slippery, isn't it?” he said.
“My flannel was frozen to the
wash-stand to-day—had to get
it off with a chisel.”
I was prepared for these travellers'
tales. I knew he was leading up to
water-pipes.
“Couldn't get my cold tub,” he went
on ; “frozen solid overnight.”
I had heard of this cold tub before.
“My tooth-brush froze on to my
teeth,” I capped him ; “the teapot
spout was hung with icicles, and the
cat's tongue froze on to the milk when
it was drinking.”
“How about your pipes?” he began.
“Who was right about wrapping?”
“Rapping,” I said in well-feigned
innocence—“rapping 2 Who rapped 2
Rapped on what?”
That set him going.
I gathered when we reached the
station there was a strike on. But we
found a milk-lorry travelling our way.
So Smith had the entire use of my
right ear into which to say, “I told

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
you so,” for an hour, while we travelled
to the spot on which we win our bread.
He had dragged from me the fact that
our hot-water tap had also struck.
The milk cans clattered. Smith chat-
tered. So did my teeth.
When I got home that night our
house seemed to be more handsomely
garnished with icicles than any other
house I had seen that day.
“Keep the home fires burning!” I
said to my wife on entering. “If need
be, burn the banisters and the bills
and my boot-trees and everything else
beginning with a ‘b." Keep us thawed
and unburst, or Fitz-Jones will feel he
has scored a moral victory; he will strut
cross-gartered, with yellow stockings,
for the rest of his days.”.
“I don't know what you are talk-
ing about,” said Evangeline, “but
Christabel and I” (Christabel is our
general-in-command) “have been coss-
eting those pipes all day. Been giving
them glasses of hot water and dressing
them up in all our clothes. The bath-
pipe is wearing my new furs and your
pyjamas, and I've put your golf stock-
ings on the geyser-pipe. I expect
they'll all blow up. Come and look
at the hot-water cistern.”
The cistern looked dressy in Evan-
geline's fur coat. I added my silk hat
to the geyser's cosy costume and a pair
of boots on the bath-taps. But I was
told not to be silly, so took them off
again. -
I suggested that the geyser should
go to a fancy-dress ball as “The Winter
of our Discontent,” but was again told
not to be silly.
Two days elapsed. The frost held.
Then something happened. Fitz-
Jones's lady - help came round at
7.30 A.M. to borrow a drop of water,
as they were frozen up.
We lent them several drops, and
I breathed again, and continued to
breathe, with snorts of derision.
Three days later the thaw came.
As I passed Fitz-Jones's house I was
grieved to hear a splashing sound. A
cascade of water was spouting from his
bathroom window. Fitz-Jones him-
self was running round and round the
house like a madman, flourishing a
water-key and trying to find the tap to
the main.
I begged him to be calm, to control
himself for his wife's sake, for all our
sakes. I was most graceful and sympa-
thetic about it.
But with the thaw Fitz-Jones had
frozen again.

On the other hand, many houses just
now require a civil servant.

CUE TYPES.
At the present moment, when the
billiard professionals are contesting the
palm and Mr. S. H. FRY has re-captured
the title of amateur champion seven-
and-twenty years after he first won it,
there is such interest in the game that
a kind of Guide to Billiard Types can-
not but be of value. Hence the follow-
ing classification of players who are to
be met with in clubs, country-houses
or saloons by any ordinary wielders of
the cue. Any reader who has ever en-
deavoured to master what may be called
(by way of inversion) the Three Balls
Art has power to add to their number.
The player who, as he drops behind
in the game, says so often that it is
months since he touched a cue that
your success is robbed |
of all savour.
The player who is
funny and calls the red
the Cherry, the Robin,
the Cardinal or the
Lobster.
The player who
comes to the game as
to a solemn ritual and
neither smiles nor
speaks.
The player who keeps
on changing his cue
and blames each one in
turn for his own in-
eptitude.
The player who can
use his left hand as
well as his right: a
man to be avoided.
The player who
whistles while he plays.
This is a very deadly
companion.
The player who never has a good
word for his opponent's efforts.
The player who congratulates you on
every stroke : a charming antagonist.
The player who is always jolly
whatever buffets he receives from for-
tune.
The player who talks about every
one of his strokes.
The player who swears at most of
them.
The player who doubts the accuracy
of your scoring. Avoid this one.
The player who hits everything too
hard. This is a very exasperating man
to meet because fortune usually favours
him. Either he flukes immoderately
or he does not leave well. He is usually
a hearty fellow with no sense of shame.
Perhaps he says “Sorry;” but he adds,
“It must have been on.”
The player who hits everything too
gently: the lamb as compared with
the previous type, who is a lion. The
ToAST, SIR."
lamb is good to play with if you prefer
winning to a real contest.
The player who groans loudly when
you make a fluke.
The player who is accustomed to
play on a much faster table than this.
The player who calls the game Pills.
The player who calls it Tuskers.
The player who counts your breaks
for you, but whether from interest or
suspicion you are not sure.
The player who pots the white when
he should and says nothing about it.
The player who pots the white when
he should, with a thousand apologies.
The player who pots the white when
he shouldn't, with a thousand apolo-
gies.
The player who is snappy with the
marker.
The player who drops cigar ash on
the cloth.
The player who hates to lose.
The player who would much rather
that you won. This type is a joy to
play with, unless towards the end he
too patently ceases to try.
The player who, after the stroke, tells
you what you ought to have done.
The player who talks to the balls,
particularly to the red. “Now then,
red,” he says, “don’t go into baulk;"
or, “Stop just by that pocket; ” or
“White, don't go down.”
The player who has just come from a
spectacular match and keeps on trying
to reproduce that shot of STEVENSON's.
“In a licensing prosecution at yester-
day it was stated that one shilling was charged
for a “drop' of whisky of about one-sixth of a
gallon.”—Daily Paper.
In the interests of temperance we have
suppressed the name of the town at
which this bargain was secured.
CONTRACTS.
IT was shortly after the commence-
ment of the March offensive that it
was decided to open new munition
works in Glenwhinnie, N.B. The con-
tract for building was offered to the
well-known firm of McTavish, McTurk
& McThom, of Auchterinver.
They accepted. With thanks.
And so it came about that, early in
April, Glenwhinnie, N.B., became the
scene of great activity. Men bearing
strange instruments came and took
extensive measurements; large bodies
of gentlemen in corduroys, armed with
powerful implements indicative of toil,
arrived and smoked clay pipes; a
special light railway was rapidly
constructed, and bore colossal cranes
T.I.T and more gentlemen
with clay pipes to the
scene of action. And
Mr. McTurk went in
person to open the pro-
ceedings.
In a speech pulsating
with patriotism, Mr.
McTurk exhorted his
men to do their best for
their King and coun-
try, and show every-
body what the firm of
McTavish, McTurk &
McThom could do. He
then departed, leaving
things in the hands of
a dozen subordinates
well tried and true . . .

On November 20th it was decided
that the new works in Glenwhinnie,
N.B., would not be necessary after all.
What was to be done?
A special committee decided that
the buildings should be demolished,
and the contract was offered to the
well-known firm of McClusky, McCleery
& McClumpha, of Auchtermuchty.
They accepted. With thanks.
And so it came about that a second
army of occupation descended upon
Glenwhinnie, N.B. Fresh bodies of
gentlemen in corduroys and armed with
a rather different set of powerful im-
plements arrived and smoked clay
pipes. Another light railway was
rapidly constructed, and Mr. McCleery
went in person to open the proceedings.
In a speech full of fervour . . .
And so by early January the work
commenced.
By this time Messrs. McTavish and
Co. had got the buildings well in
hand. What was to be done 2 Leave

their work uncompleted ? Never! As
Mr. McThom pointed out with consid-
erable emotion to his partners, a con-
tract was a contract all the world over.
If it ever came to be said that any
firm he was interested in had failed to
fulfil a contract, he for one (Angus
McThom) would never hold up his
head. The contract must be completed.
It was a sacred duty. Besides—a
minor point—what about payment?
So Mr. McTurk was despatched to
Glenwhinnie, N.B., where in a speech
of great power he pointed out the path
of duty.
Amid scenes of enthusiasm the work
went on apace.
And at the other end the well-
known firm of McClusky, McCleery &
McClumpha tore down the buildings
with equal enthusiasm. -
And that is the state of affairs just
now in Glenwhinnie, N.B. What will
happen when—as they are bound to do
—the wreckers overtake the builders
is a matter for speculation. Mr.
McTurk may make another speech.
Possibly Mr. McCleery may also ex-
hort. There is promise of a delicate
situation.
THE STOICS OF THE SERPENTINE.
I, FoR my part, admire
The snug domestic fire,
The comfortable hearth, the glowing
coals,
Nor in the least aspire
To emulate those strong heroic souls
Who get up while it's dark
And haste to chill ablutions in
Hyde Park. - -
It can't be very nice
To break the solid ice
And, like a walrus, plunge into the
deep;
Then jump out in a trice,
Dissevering the icicles as you leap,
Even though the after-glow
Of virtue melts the circumjacent
SnOW.
And we of milder mould,
And we who're growing old,
Wish they would wash, like other
folk, elsewhere;
It makes us feel quite cold
To think of them refrigerating there;
We shiver in our beds;
Our pitying molars chatter in our
heads.

A CONSULTATION.
Persons of the dialogue: Arthur Pillwell, M.D., a fashion-
able physician; Henry Swallow, a patient. The scene
is laid in Dr. Pillwell's consulting-room—a solid room,
heavily furnished. A large writing-table occupies the
centre of the scene. There are a few prints on the
walls; two bookcases are solidly filled with medical
books. Dr. Pillwell is seated at the writing-table. He
rises to greet his patient.
Dr. P. Good morning, Mr. — (He looks furtively at a
notebook lying open on the table) Mr.—ah—Swallow.
Mr. S. (thinking to himself: Ought I to call this Johnnie
“Doctor,” or not 2 I'm told they're very particular about
a thing like that. Like a fool, I never gave it a thought.
Still, I can't go so very far wrong if I call him “Doctor.”
Besides, he's got to be called “Doctor” whether he likes it
or not. Here goes.) (Aloud) Good morning, Dr. Pillwell.
I've been troubled with some symptoms which I can't
quite make out. I think I described them in my letter.
(To himself: They made several doctors Knights of the
British Empire, and I'm almost certain Pillwell was one
of them. Sir John Pillwell. Yes, it sounds all right;
but I shan't call him “Sir John” because if he isn't a
knight he might think I was trying to make fun of him and
then he might retaliate by calling me “Sir Henry,” and I
should hate that). (Aloud) The chief symptoms are a steady
loss of appetite and a disinclination to work. I was recom-
mended to consult you by my friend, Mr. Bolter, as I think
I explained in my letter.
Dr. P. It's curious how prevalent these symptoms are
at the present moment. I think, if you don't mind, I will
begin by taking your temperature.
[Produces clinical thermometer and gives it three good
ſerks. -
Mr. S. (to himself: There—I knew he'd want to put on
of those infernal machines in my mouth. I simply loathe
the feeling of them, and I'm always on the verge of crunch-
ing them up. Perhaps I ought to warn him.) (Aloud) I'm
afraid I'm not much good as a thermometer man.
Dr. P. Oh, it's a mere trifle. All you've got to do is just
to hold it under your tongue. There—it's in.
Mr. S. (talking with difficulty). Ish i' in 'e ri' plashe?
Dr. P. Yes. But don't try to talk while it's in your
mouth. I've had patients who've bitten it in two. There—
that's enough. (Eatracts it deftly from patient's mouth
and examines it.) Hum, hum, yes. A point below normal.
Nothing violently wrong there. (He now performs the
usual rites and mysteries.) I'll make you out a little pre-
scription which ought to put you all right. And if you
can spare a week, and spend it at Eastbourne, I don't think
it will do you any harm.
Mr. S. (To himself: I like this man. He doesn't waste
any time. It's a curious coincidence that I should have
been thinking this very morning of arranging a visit to the
seaside. Now of course I've absolutely got to go, Can't
disobey my new doctor, and wouldn't if I could. By Jove,
I'd all but forgotten about the two guineas fee. Yes, the

TO A CHINESE COOLIE.
O HAPPY Chink! When I behold thy face,
Illumined with the all-embracing smile
Peculiar to thy celestial race,
So full of mirth and yet so free from guile,
I stand amazed and let my fancy roam,
And ask myself by what mysterious lure -
Thou wert induced to leave thy flowery home
For Flanders, where, alas ! the flowers are fewer.
Oft have I marked thee on the Calais quay,
Unloading ships of plum-and-apple jam,
Or beef, or, three times weekly, M. and W.,
And sometimes bacon (very rarely ham);
Or, where St. Quentin towers above the plain,
Have seen thee scan the awful scene and sigh,
Pick up a spade, then put it down again
And wipe a furtive tear-drop from thine eye.
And many a Sabbath have I seen thee stride
With stately step across the Merville Square,
Beaming with pleasure, full of conscious pride,
Breaking the hearts of all the jeunes filles there;
A bowler hat athwart thy stubborn locks -
And round thy neck a tie of brilliant blue,
Thy legs in football shorts, thy feet in socks
Of silken texture and vermilion hue.
Impassive Chu (or should I call thee “Chow "?),
Say, what hast thou to do with all this fuss,
The ceaseless hurry and the beastly row,
The buzzing plane and roaring motor-bus,
While far away the sullen Hwang-ho rolls
His lazy waters to the Eastern Sea,
And sleepy mandarins sit on bamboo poles
Imbibing countless cups of China tea 2
A year ago thou digged'st in feverish haste
Against the whelming onset of the Hun
A hundred miles of trench across the waste--
A year ago—and now the War is won ;
But thou remainest still with pick and spade,
Celestial delver, patient son of toil!
To fill the trenches thou thyself hast made
And roll the twisted wire in even coil.
But not for thee the glory and the praise,
The medals or the fat gratuity;
No man shall crown thee with a wreath of bays
Or recommend thee for the O.B.E.;
And thou, methinks, wouldst rather have it so,
Provided that, without undue delay,
They let thee take thy scanty wage and go
Back to thy sunny home in § Cathay;
Where never falls a shell nor bursts a bomb,
Nor ever blows the slightest whiff of gas,
Such as was not infrequent in the Somme,
But on thy breast shall lean some slant-eyed lass;
And she shall listen to thy converse ripe
And search for souvenirs among thy kit,
Pass thee thy slippers and thy opium pipe
And make thee glad that thou hast done thy bit.

TOM.”
E ALMOST FORGOT HOW TO; THEY 'WE BEEN SO BUSY GETTIN' OUT
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FINDING Midas and Son (METHUEN) described on the
wrapper as a tale of “the struggle of a young man and his
immense riches,” I said to myself (rather like Triplet in the
play) that here was a struggle at which it would greatly
hearten me to assist. As a fact, however, the conflict
proved to be somewhat postponed; it took Mr. STEPHEN
McKENNA more than two hundred pages to get the seconds
out of the ring and leave his hero, Deryk, face to face with
an income of something over a million a year. Before this
happened the youth had become engaged to a girl, been
thrown over by her, experienced the wiles of Circe and
gone in more or less vaguely for journalism. Then came
the income and the question what to do with it. Of course
he didn't know how to use it to the best advantage; it
is universal experience that other people never do. But
Deryk impressed me as more than commonly lacking in
resource. All he could think of was to finance and share
in an archaeological venture (rather fun), and to purchase a
Pall Mall club-house—apparently the R.A.C.—and do it up
as a London abode for himself and his old furniture. Also
for his wife, as fortune had now flung him again into the arms
of his early love. But it is just here that the subtle and
slightly cruel cleverness of Mr. McKENNA's scheme becomes
manifest. The million-a-year had been at work on Deryk ;
it had slain his capacity for romance. In plain words, he
found that he cared more for his furniture than for his
fiancée, whose adoration soon bored him to shrieking point.
So there you are. I shall not betray the author's solu-
tion of his own problem. I don't think he has proved his
somewhat obvious point as to the peril of great possessions.
Deryk was hardly a quite normal subject, and Idina (the
girl) was a little fool who would have irritated a crossing-
sweeper. But what he certainly has done is to provide
some scenes of pre-war London not unworthy to be com-
panion pictures to those in Sonia; and this, I fancy, will be
good enough for most readers.
Its publishers call The Pot Boils (CoNSTABLE) a “provo-
cative” book, and certainly the title at least deserves this
epithet. But I decline to be drawn into the obvious retort.
Besides, with all its faults, the story exhibits an almost
flaunting disregard of those qualities that make the best
seller. About the author I am prepared to wager, first,
that “StoRM JAMEsoN" is a disguise; secondly, that the
personality behind it is feminine. I have hinted that the
tale is hardly likely to gain universal popularity; let me
add that certain persons, notably very young Socialists and
experts in Labour journalism, may find it of absorbing
interest. It is a young book, almost exclusively about
young people, written (or I mistake) by a youthful hand.
These striplings and maidens are all poor, mostly vain, and
without exception fulfilled of a devastating verbosity. We
meet them first at a “Northern University,” talking, re-
forming the earth, kissing, and again talking—about the
kisses. Thence they and the tale move to London, and the
same process is repeated. It is all rather depressingly
narrow in outlook; though within these limits there are
interesting and even amusing scenes. Also the author
displays now and again a happy dexterity of phrase
(I remember one instance—about “web-footed Socialists
. . . . dividing and sub-dividing into committees, like

worms cut by a spade”), which encourages me to hope that
she will do better things with a scheme of wider appeal.
But to the general, especially the middle-aged general, the
contents of her present Pot will, I fear, be only caviare.
Little Sara Lee Kennedy, betrothed to one of those alert
grim-jawed young Americans one sees in the advertising
pages of The Ladies' Home Journal, learns of the suffering
in Belgium at the beginning of the great War and finds she
must do something about it. She can cook, so she will go
and make soup for KING ALBERT's men. She takes her
young man's photograph and his surly disapproval; also a
few dollars hastily collected from her obscure township in
Pa.; and becomes the good angel of a shattered sector of
the Belgian line. And she finds in The Amazing Interlude
(MURRAY) her prince—a real prince—in the Secret Service,
and, after the usual reluctances and brave play (made for the
sake of deferring the inevitable) with the photograph of the
old love, is at last gloriously on with the new. It is a very
charming love-story, and MARY RoPERTs RINEHART makes
a much better thing of the alarms and excursions of war
than you would think. It was no good, I found, being
superior about it and muttering “Sentiment” when you
had to blink away the -
unbidden tear lest
your fireside partner
should find you out.
So let me commend
to you this idealised
vision of a corner of
the great War seen | Sº
through the eyes of
an American woman
of vivid sympathies.
Rovers of the Night
Sky (CASSELL) is for
more reasons than one
a welcome addition to
cipice and came to London to make her fortune in revue.
Really the suitor didn't go all the way down the precipice;
but as, by the time he recovered, Dylis, disguised, had fled
for England, he was promptly arrested for her murder,
and as Dylis thought she had murdered him there was
presently so much confusion (increased for me by the hope-
lessly unpronounceable names of a large cast) that I found
it increasingly hard to keep the affair in hand. As for
Dylis's theatrical career—well, you know how these things
are managed in fiction; for my part I was left wondering
whether Mr. Howel, Evans' pictures of Wales were as
romantically conceived as his conception of a West-End
theatre. Though of course we all know that Welsh people
do sometimes make even more sensational triumphs in the
Metropolis; just possible indeed that this fact may have
some bearing on the recent flood of Cambrian fiction.
Certainly, if A Little Welsh Girl achieves success on the
strength of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's triumph, she may thank
her luck, for I have my doubts whether she could manage
it unassisted.
Of Ladies Must Dive (Hodder AND Stoughton) one may
say, in the first place, that it is fortunately unnecessary as
- Tiwell as unusual for
the bulk of them to
live in the scalp and
to mahawk atmos-
– phere that distingu-

º social rivalry of Chris-
* time Fennimer and

beautiful American
Society dames whose

= |form the plot, the
: whole plot and noth-
|ing but the plot of
my rapidly bulging
collection of books
about flying. “NIGHT - - -
HAwk, M.C.,” was in the Infantry—what he calls a “Gravel-
Cruncher”—before he took to the air, and by no means the
least interesting part of his sketches is the way in which he
explains the co-operation which existed between the fliers
and the men fighting on the ground. And his delight when
a bombing expedition was successful in giving instant
assistance to the Infantry is frequently shown. After his
training in England “NIGHT HAwk” was attached as an
observer to a night-flying squadron in France, and he tells
us of his adventures with no sense of self-importance but
with an honest appreciation of their value to the general
scheme of operations. He has also a keen eye for the
humours of life, and can make his jest with most admirable
brevity. “Doubtless,” he says in a foreword, “the whole
world will fly before many years have passed, but for the
moment most people have to be content to read about it.”
I am one of them, and he has added to my contentment.
My studies of recent fiction induce the belief that modern
Wales may be divided into two parts, in one of which the
inhabitants call each other Bach and follow a code of
morals that I simply will not stoop to characterise; while
the other is at once more Saxon in idiom and considerably
more melodramatic in its happenings. It is to the latter
province that I must assign A Little Welsh Girl (HopDER
AND SToughton), the Romance, with a big R, of Dylis
Morgan, who pushed an unappreciated suitor over a pre-
Man in the Air. “ANother of these BEAstly PivotAL MEN 1"
|Miss ALICE DUER
MILLER's latest book.
'Nature red in tooth
and claw has not mothered them—they are too well-bred
for that; they simply bite with their tongues. Mrs. Almar,
who is married and purely piratical, comes off worst in the
encounter, and the more artful Christine, ultimately falling
in love with the object of her artifices, becomes human
enough to marry him, despite his lapse from financial eligi-
bility. The plot is a thin one, but smoothly and brightly
unfolded. Unhappily Miss MILLER lacks the gift of delicate
satire and the sense of humour that the society novel above
all others seems to require. With a lighter and less
matter-of-fact treatment one would accept more easily the
overdrawing of her rather impossible felines,
“Sir Charles Sykes, Director of Wood Production, has conferred
with representatives of each section of the tailoring trade, with a
view to simplifying the regulations and making possible a larger
output of Standard suits.”—Daily Paper.
We look forward to the part that this new clothing will
play in the general scheme of afforestation.
“A lady visiting the town complained that she went to a licensed
house and asked to be served with tea. She alleged that the licensee
was very rude to her, and refused to grant her request. He [the
Superintendent of Police] desired to point out to license holders that
they were bound to provide proper accommodation and refreshment
for man and beast.”—West-Country Paper.
And we desire to point out to the Superintendent that
that is not the proper way to refer to a lady.

THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
I.—THE SHIP. -
WHEN it was announced that we were to be paid off and
that the gulls and porpoises that help to make the Dogger
Bank the really jolly place it is would know us no more,
there was, I admit, a certain amount of subdued jubilation
on board. It is true that the Mate and the Second Engineer
fox-trotted twice round the deck and into the galley, where
they upset a ship's-tin of gravy; and the story that the
Trimmer, his complexion liberally enriched with oil and
coaldust, embraced the Lieutenant and excitedly hailed the
Skipper by his privy pseudonym of “Plum-face,” cannot be
lightly discredited; but at the same time I think each one
of us felt a certain twinge of regret. Life in the future apart
from our trawler seemed impossible, almost absurd. Paci-
ficists must have known a similar feeling on Armistice day.
Although to the outsider one trawler may look very like
another, to us who know them personally they differ in
character and have their little idiosyncrasies no less than
other people. Some are quite surly and obstinate, others
good-humoured and light-hearted; where one exhibits all
the stately dignity of a College head-porter another may be
as skittish and full of fun as a magistrate on the Bench.
There was one trawler at our base so vain that they could
never get her to enter the lockpits until her decks had been
GOOD-BYE TO
scrubbed and a string of bunting hoisted at the foremast.
It is surprising.
Taking her all in all our trawler was a good sort, one of
the best. When steaming head to wind in a heavy sea she
certainly shipped an amazing quantity of water, and even
in a comparative calm she would occasionally fling an odd
bucketful or so of North Sea down the neck or into the sea-
boots of the unwary; but it was only her sense of fun. She
took particular delight in playing it on a new member of
the crew; it made him feel at home.
She was not what you would call a really clean ship—
as the Skipper said, if you washed your hands one day they
were just as bad again the next—but anyone who makes a
fuss over a trifle like that is no true-born sailorman. We
all loved her and were proud of her speed, for she could
make nine knots at a push. Even the Second Engineer,
who had been a fireman in the Wilson line, was moved to
admit in a moment of admiration that she didn't do so badly
for a floating pig-trough, which was no meagre praise from
a man with such a past.
She was a touchy ship, quick to resent and avenge a
slight on her good name. We had a strange Lieutenant
one trip who came from a depôt ship at Southampton and
wore a monocle. He was rather sore at having to ex-
change a responsible harbour billet for the command of a
mere sea-going trawler, and expressed the opinion that
there might be more disgustingly dirty ships afloat than
ours, but if so they were not allowed out during official
daylight. We felt her quiver from stem to stern with rage.
She took her revenge that evening as the Lieutenant was
coming aſt for tea. It was a floppy sea and he unwisely
ventured along the windward side of the casing, and she
seized her opportunity. The Mate picked him up out of
the scuppers and we dried his clothes over the boilers, but
the monocle was never seen again. The crew were not so
sympathetic as they might have been ; they felt that he
had asked for it.
But, though her personal beauty would not have been
unrivalled at a Cowes Regatta and her somewhat erratic
motions were not calculated to bring balm to the soul of an
unseasoned mariner, she was a faithful ship, and no one
could ever question her courage. At the sight of a hostile
periscope she used positively to see red, and she once
steamed across a mine-field without turning a hatch-cover.
Throughout her naval career she was a credit to the White
Ensign and bravely upheld the proud traditions of her
ancestors. - -
She is to be handed back to her owners and will pre-
sumably return to the more peaceful occupation of deep-sea
fishing. It will be strange to think of her still labouring
away out there on the Nor'-East Rough whilst we who have
shared her trials so long are following once more the less
arduous ways of the land. If she prove as eager in the
pursuit of her undersea quarry as she was on the trail of
the U-Boat I would not change places with the cod and
haddocks of the North Sea for the prize - money of an
Admiral. Good luck to her

-- - - - - ------
THE MUD LARKS.
ONLY a few months ago our William
and his trusty, troop swooped upon a
couple of Bosch field batteries flounder-
ing in a soft patch on the far side of
Tournai. William afflicted their gun
teams with his little Hotchkiss gadget,
then prepared to gallop them. He had
unshipped his knife and was offering
his sergeant long odds on scoring first
“ pink,” when our two squadron trum-
peters trotted out from a near - by
coppice and solemnly puffed “Cease
l'ire "—for all the world as if it was
the end of a field-day on the Plain and
time to trot home to tea. William was
furious.
“There y'are,” he snorted. “Just
because I happened to have a full troop
out for once, all my horses fit, no wire
or trenches in the way, the burst of
the season ahead and the only chance
I've had in four and a-half years of
doing a really artistic bit of carving
they must go and stop the ruddy War.
Poo! ain't that the bully Army all
over ? Bah! I've done with it.”
So he filled in the bare patches in
every Demobilisation Form Z 15 he
could lay pen to. -
Taking the proud motto of the MoRD
dynasty—“Make yourself necessary”
—for guide, he became something
different every day in his quest after
an “Essential Trade.” He was in turn
a one-man-business, a railway-porter,
a coal-miner, a farmer, a NorthcLIFFE
leader-writer, a taxi-baron, a jazz-pro-
fessor and a non-union barber. At one
moment he was single, an orphan alone
and unloved ; at another he had a
drunken wife, ten consumptive young
children and several paralytic old
parents to support. All to no avail;
nobody would believe him.
Then one day he heard from a friend
who by the simple expedient of posing
as a schoolmaster for a few minutes
was now in “civvies” and getting three
days' hunting and four days' golf a
week.
William grabbed up yet another
A. F. Z 15, and dedicated his life to the
intellectual uplift of the young.
This time he drew a reply and by
return. -
Corps H.Q. held the view that he,
William, was the very fellow they had
been looking for, longing for, praying
for. They had him appointed Regi-
mental Educational Officer (without
increase of rank, pay or allowances) on
the spot, and would he get on with it,
please, and indent through them for any
materials required in the furtherance of
the good work 2

tape-worms take him for? A blithering
pedagogue in cap, gown and horn
spectacles? He kicked the only sound
chair in the Mess to splinters, cursed
for two hours and sulked for twenty-
four. After which childish display he
pulled himself together and indented
on Corps Educational Branch for four
hundred treatises on elementary Arabic,
Arabic being the sole respectable sub-
ject in which he was even remotely
competent to instruct. -
Corps H.Q. tore up his indent. It
was absurd, they said, to suppose that
the entire regiment intended emigrating
to Arabia on demobilisation. William
must get in touch with the men and
find out what practical everyday trades
they were anxious to take up.
William was furious. “Isn't that
the rotten Staff all over ?” he fumed.
“Make an earnest and conscientious
effort to give the poor soldiers a leg-up
with a vital, throbbing, commercial and
classical patois and the brass-bound
perishers choke you off Poo-bah!
Na poo!” -
Then he pulled himself together again
and indented on Corps Educational

ONCE upon a time there was a Royal
christening.
It was a very grand christening and
the highest in the land were among
the assembled guests. There was more
than one Royal Personage present, and
many lords and ladies and ambassa-
dors and plenipotentiaries and all man-
ner of dignified and imposing people.
For it was a real Princess that was
being christened, which is a thing that
does not occur every day in the year.
Quite a number of fairies were there
Fairies are very fond of christen-
of them about on these occasions.
They were very lavish in their gifts.
One gave the baby beauty; another
gave her a sweet and gentle disposition;
another, charm of manner; a fourth, a
quick and intelligent mind. She really
was a very fortunate baby, so many
and so varied were the giſts bestowed
upon her by the fairy folk.
Last of all came the Fairy Queen.
She arrived late, having come on
from a coster's wedding in the East
End of London, a good many miles
away. '
She was rather breathless and her
crown was a little on one side, indeed
her whole appearance was a trifle dis-
hevelled.
“Oh, my dear,” she murmured to her
chief lady-in-waiting as she bustled
lightly up the aisle, “I’ve had such a
time. It was a charming wedding.
The tinned-salmon was delicious, and
there were winkles—and gin. I only
just tasted the gin, of course, for luck,
you know, but really it was very good.
I had no idea And there was a
real barrel-organ, and we danced in
the street. The bride had the most
lovely ostrich feathers. The bride-
groom, was a perfect dear. I kissed
him. I kissed everyone, I think. We
all did . . . Now what about this
baby?" For by this time they had
reached that part of the church where
the ceremony was taking place. “I
suppose you've already given her most
of the nice things 2"
The lady-in-waiting rapidly enumer-
ated the fairy-gifts which the fairies
had bestowed upon the child.
The Queen looked at the baby.
“What a darling!” she said; “I must
give her something very nice.” She
hovered a moment over the child's
head. “She shall marry the man of
her choice,” she said, “and live happily
ever after.”
There was a little stir among the
fairies. The lady-in-waiting laid her
hand on the Queen's arm.

The Fairy Queen looked round at all
the people who were assembled in the
church; she had indeed forgotten for
the moment what a very important
occasion this was. Then she looked at
the baby.
“I don't care,” she said, “I don't

MUSICAL GOSSIP FROM THE
GERMAN FRONT.
“For the last twenty years,” writes
M. JEAN-AUBRY, a distinguished French
musical critic, “the temple of German
music has been no longer at Bonn, or
Weimar, or Munich, or Bayreuth, but
at Essen. The modern German or-
chestra, with Strauss and Mahler,
was concerned more with the preoccu-
pations of artillery and the siege-train
than with those of real music. It
desired to become a rival of Krupp.”
These remarks are borne out in a
remarkable way by the latest news of
STRAUss. It has always been very
difficult to obtain precise intelligence
about his works, owing to his notorious
aversion from publicity, and we accord-
|ingly give this information with all
reserve, simply for what it is worth.
It is to the effect that, while retaining
the parts for three Minenwerfen in his
new Battle Symphony, he has been
obliged to re-score one movement in
which four “Big Berthas” were promin-
ently engaged, owing to the impossi-
bility of securing any of these instru-
ments since the Armistice. He has,
however, with admirable resource sub-
|stituted parts for four influenza mi-
icrobes. There are no French horns in
the score, but by way of showing a
conciliatory spirit to the British army
of occupation he has introduced in the
Finale an adaptation of a well-known
patriotic song, which is marked on the
margin, “Die W.A.A.C. am Rhein.”

KISM ET.
Those old comrades, Sergeant Kippy
and Gunner Toady, stood on the steps
of the Convalescent Home and re-
garded the peaceful country-side which,
in South Devon, is a sedative even in
February.
Gunner Toady had come over for
the day, and Kippy, as an inhabitant
of the Home, had been exercising his
prerogative of showing a guest over
the estate. During the great advance
which proved to be the expiring effort
of the Hun, the Gunner had acquired
a shortened leg, which still caused him
to revolt against sustained physical
exertion. -
He leant upon his stick and listened
while Kippy the indefatigable drew
... up a programme of a further tour to
some outlying buildings.
“And you 'aven't seen the melin-
'ouse,” concluded that worthy, enthu-
siastically waving his remaining arm
in the direction of a far shubbery.
“Melin-'ouses in Febuary is lugoo-
brious,” said the Gunner; “we 'll
remain at the chatoo.” -,
Kippy sat down on the top step.
“Curious,” he said, “to think there
ain't no war on. Makes you feel idle.
Remember that day at Coolomeers
(Coulommiers), when we first got inter-
dooced?” The Gunner nodded. “’Bout
a thousand years ago that was, an' not
'alf a beano—'orse, foot and guns; no
stinks, no blinkin' fireworks and old
| Won KLUCK gettin' 'ome pronto.”
“Yes,” his companion, said slowly,
as he lowered himself to sit beside
Kippy, “that was September '14. I
took my first knockout there, an' then
clicked with you again in Southmead
'Ospital at Bristol.”
“An’,” Kippy took up the tale, “we
come together agen at the end o' '15
in the old salient at Wipers, an' in '16
we was foregathered on the Somme.
That's where I got my first dose of
Fritz's gas. Put me in Blighty three
months, that did; an' I won the ten-
stone clock-golf putting championship
of 'Ereford.”
“Yes,” said the Gunner ruminatively,
“we’ve had to handle all sorts in this
show; wy, I've played a game called
Badminton with a real princess a-
jumpin' about it'other side of the net.
O' course it ain't discipline.” -
“Well,” said Kippy, “I got two
years' service before the War. That
makes six an’ a bit; and next month I
shall 'ave my Mark 1919 patent arm
complete with all the latest develop-
ments and get into civvies. Then what-o
for a job o' paper-'anging.”
Gunner Toady gave a slight start,
but at once passed into a state of deep

“It wasNA MA TURRN TAE WRITE.”
reflection. After a protracted pause
he delivered his mature judgment.
“’Course,” he said slowly, “I believe
in wot them Mahomets call Kismet.
No gettin' away from it ->
“Oo's Kismet 2" interrupted Kippy.
“It's me and you gettin' mixed up
so intimate over 'arf o' France and the
'ole o' Flanders. Like two needles in
a blinkin' 'aystack clickin' every time—
an’’taint as if the Gunners dossed down

Gunner Toady paused impressively
and continued, “Now you'd 'ardly be-
lieve it, but before I joined the reg'ment
in '09 I was a master-plasterer workin'
in Fulham.”
“Lumme!" exclaimed Kippy, “wy,

the other day that there's a nice little
apray-lar-gur connection to be worked
up at Walham Green. 'Ow about callin'

“That's what it means,” said the
senior partner. “It's Kismet right
enough, and there ain't no gettin' away
from it.”
“And we might add,” said Kippy,
with a touch of inspiration—“we might
add, ‘Late Contractors to His Majes-
ty's Goverment.’”

[FEBRUARY 26, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TWO VISITS,
1888, 1919.
(“Dispersal Areas, 10a, 10b, 10c-
Crystal Palace.")
It was, I think, in '88
That Luck or Providence or Fate
Assumed the more material state
Of Aunt (or Great-Aunt) Alice,
And took (the weather being fine
And Bill, the eldest, only nine)
Three of us by the Brighton line
To see the Crystal Palace.
Observe us, then, an eager four
Advancing on the Western Door
Or possibly the Northern, or—
Well, anyhow, advancing;
Aunt Alice bending from the hips,
And Bill in little runs and trips,
And John with frequent hops and
skips, -
While I was fairly dancing.
Aunt Alice pays; the turnstile clicks,
And with the happy crowds we mix
To gaze upon—well, I was six,
Say, getting on for seven ;
And, looking back on it to-day,
The memories have passed away—
I find that I can only say .
(Roughly) to gaze on heaven.
Heaven it was which came to pass
Within those magic walls of glass
(Though William, like a silly ass,
Had lost my bag of bull's-eyes).
The wonders of that wonder-hall !
The-all the things I can't recall,
And, dominating over all,
The statues, more than full-size.
Adam and Niobe were there,
DISRAELI much the worse for wear,
Samson before he 'd cut his hair,
Lord ByRoN and Apollo;
A female group surrounded by
A camel (though I don't know
why)— - - -
And all of them were ten feet high
And all, I think, were hollow.
These gods looked down on us and
smiled
To see how utterly a child
By simple things may be beguiled
To happiness and laughter;
It warmed their kindly hearts to see
The joy of Bill and John and me
From ten to lunch, from lunch to tea,
From tea to six or after.
That evening, when the day was
dead,
They tucked a babe of six in bed,
Arranged the pillows for his head,
And saw the lights were shaded ;
Too sleepy for the Good-night kiss
His only conscious thought was this:
“No man shall ever taste the bliss
That I this blesséd day did.”
When one is six one cannot tell;
And John, who at the Palace fell
A victim to the Blondin Belle,
Is wedded to another:
And I, my intimates allow,
Have lost the taste for bull's-eyes
now, ... •
And baldness decorates the brow
, Of Bill, our elder brother. -
Well, more than thirty years have
passed . . . -
But all the same on Thursday last
My heart was beating just as fast
Within that Hall of Wonder;
My bliss was every bit as great
As what it was in '88– -
. Impossible to look sedate . . .
Or keep my feelings under.
The gods of old still gazed upon
The scene where, thirty years agone,
The lines of Bill and me and John
Were cast in pleasant places;
And “Friends,” I murmured, “what's
the odds -
If you are rather battered gods? .
This is no time for Ichabods
• And cheu-er—fugaces.”
Ah, no; I did not mourn the years'
Fell work upon those poor old dears,
Nor PITT nor Venus drew my tears
And set me slowly sobbing;
I hailed them with a happy laugh
And slapped old Samson on the calf, .
And asked a member of the staff
For “Officers Demobbing.”
That evening, being then dispersed,
I swear (as I had sworn it first
When three of us went on the burst
With Aunt, or Great-Aunt, Alice),
“Although one finds, as man or boy,
A thousand pleasures to enjoy,
For happiness without alloy
Give me the Crystal Palace!”

COAL-DUST.
“HAD a good day ?” said Frederic
cheerily, stamping the snow off his
boots as I met him at the front-door.
“That depends,” I said, “on what
you call a good day." '
“You haven't been dull 2’’ said
Frederic. - -
“Oh, no,” I said, indicating the
comforting blaze as I pushed Frederic's
chair to the fire; “behold the result of
my day's labours in your behalf. Your
hot bath and hot breakfast, dear, were
just camouflage to keep from you, the
centre of gravity, our desperate straits.
When I went to give Cook her orders
this morning I found her as black as a
sweep and in a mood to correspond.
She pointed to a few lumps of coal in
the kitchen scuttle and said, ‘I’ve

people,’ he said, “have no coal at
and these are the only lumps I could
find. There's only enough to cook one
more dinner.’” . . *
“My dear girl,” said Frederic, “why
wait till there is no coal before ordering
more ?” - ; , . - -
“Hear me,” I cried. “A fortnight
ago I ordered some. The man asked,
‘Have you any coal?' I said I had a
little. He said, ‘You are lucky to have
|any. Dozens of people have no coal
at all. I can promise nothing.’
“A week ago I went again. “Have
you any coal?' he asked. ‘Still a very
“Hundreds of
all.
I can promise you nothing.' - - -
“Well, aſter. I had spent an hour
this morning distributing whiffy oil-
lamps all over the house, I went again
to the coal merchant. He froze me
||with a look. “When can you send in
my coal?' I tried to say it jauntily,
but my teeth chattered. ‘Have you no
coal 2' he said, and his frigid eye
pierced me. “O-o-only a little dust,
which has been at the bottom of the
cellar for two years—drawing-room
coal dust,” I added eagerly, “which
cannot be used on the kitchen fire.'
‘You are lucky,' he said, ‘to have that.
There are thousands of people in this
town with no coal at all. We can
promise you nothing.' * . * * *
“I came home, and after luncheon,
donning my Red Cross uniform, I told
Mary that if people called she could
show them into the coal-cellar, where
I should be; and, armed with a garden-
fork, I proceeded thither and dug dili-
gently for a whole hour. I know now
exactly why a hen clucks when she
has laid an egg. Every time I found
a lump-and I found as many as six—
I simply had to call Cook and Mary to
come and see.” -
“What fun!” murmured Frederic
comfortably.
“I venture to suggest, dear, that the
thing is beyond a joke. When I next
go to the coal-monger's I shall say in
reply to the inevitable question, “A
little coal-dust in the cellar and a good
deal on the chairs and tables and on my
hands and face; ' and I know he will
say: ‘You are lucky to have even that.
There are millions in this town who,
etc., etc.' And so the thing will go on
until one day he asks, ‘Have you no
fuel at all?' when I can hear myself
replying, ‘Only two chairs and one
wardrobe,” and he will reply icily, ‘You
are lucky to have that. Everybody else
is dead because they had not even
that.'
“And Frederic,” I added abruptly,
“as a coal-miner I demand the mini-
mum wage for my day—your hot bath
to-morrow morning.”

“It is quite clear,” said the Adjutant,
“that Second-Lieut. X must stay.”
“Of course,” said the G.O.C. Demobs,
or, as heis more often called, “Mobbles.”
“He stays because he doesn't go.” .
“Yes,” said the Adjutant's child, full,
like the elephant's child, of insatiable
curiosity, “X stays because he is re-
tained for selection until he is selected
for retention, or, to put it more clearly,
he belongs to a class which could go if
it had any reason for going and if it
wanted to go and wasn't retained as
eligible or wasn't eligible for retention.
In other words he is in one of the two
classes—those who are available to go
and those who are eligible to stay.”
“Or, conversely,” said Mobbles,
“those who are available to stay and
those who are eligible to go.”
“Exactly,” said the Adjutant; “but
which 2"
“The other,” said the Adjutant's
child. “Now, if he was only in the
same boat as Y, the position would be
different. Y is here because, though
eligible for release, he is available for
retention.”
“The problem appeared quite simple
at first,” said the Adjutant, “but now
you've made it all muddy.” -
“It is simply this,” said Mobbles;
“is-he-eligible for retention or merely
available for release? If the former,
is he available for demobilisation, and
if the latter, is he eligible for retention?
No ; what I mean is just this—Is he
here or is he— No: I’ll start again.
Is he retained, and if not why not 2".
“Exactly,” said the Adjutant's child. |
“Is he under thirty-seven, and if so
why was he born in 1874, or, to put it
quite clearly 1 - -
“Shut up,” said the Adjutant. “I
want to get it clear before you confuse
me again. We'll start afresh. X is
eligible to go because he joined the
Army before 1916. On the other hand,
being under thirty-seven, he must stay.”
“That must, I think, be wrong,” said
Mobbles.
IN SUCH weATHER."
“Quite,” said the Adjutant's child.
“Well, then, put it in another way,”
said the Adjutant. “X can't be demo-
bilised because there is no reason for ||
his, going, and he can't stay because
there is no authority for retaining him.
In other words, to put it quite clearly,
as he is being retained he can't go,
and as he is being demobilised he isn't
to be retained. Do I make myself
clear 2 " . . . -
“Quite,” said the Adjutant's child.
Mobbles was beyond speech and
busily engaged in working it out on
paper in decimals.
There was a knock at the door; a sig-
maller brought a wire, “Report immedi-
ately position of Second-Lieut. X.”
| There was a moment's silence as the
Adjutant grasped a message-pad and
thought deeply what to say. He wrote
a few lines and then looked up. “This
is what I have said: “Second-Lieut.
X staying if retained, but available to
go if eligible; also eligible for reten-
tion if available.' Am I clear 2"
“Quite,” said the Adjutant's child.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 17th-On the
motion for the rejection of the Bill to
relieve Ministers from the necessity
of re-election, Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING
incidentally revealed the horrifying fact
that he has compiled another
Black Book, containing a full list
of the PRIME MINISTER’s election
pledges. They do not quite come
up to the notorious figure of
47,000; but they total 1,211,
which seems enough to go on
with, and they are all “cross-
referenced.” -
... More serious, from the Govern-
ment's point of view, was the
criticism of some of their regular
supporters. Lord WINTERTON,

Something had evidently annoyed
Mr. DEvlin. Whether it was the
intimation that the new Housing Bill
was not to apply to Ireland (which has
had similar legislation for years past),
or that in future the out-of-work dona-
tion in that country would be confined
to persons possessing more or less right

the Government of such overwhelm-

least sarcastic of men, was driven to
remark, “I think the honourable Mem-

I trust that Mr. CHURCHILL, who is
conducting the business of the War
Office in Paris, will not read the Official
Report of the debate on the Aerial
Navigation Bill. For I am sure it
would be as great a shock to him as it
was to me to learn that Mr. Mosley
(aetat twenty-two) considered him, in
aviation affairs, as lacking in imagina-
tion. The idea of anyone regarding
our WINSTON as a doddering old fossil!

something to go on with by raising
the topic of industrial unrest in a speech
composed in about equal measure of
admirable platitudes and highly disput-
able propositions. Its principal merit
was to furnish the new Lord CHAN-

CELLOR with an occasion for deliver-
ing his maiden speech. This he did
with proper solemnity, though once he
slipped into his after-dinner style and
addressed his august audience as “My
Lords and Gentlemen.” His nearest
approach to an epigram was the re-
mark that “the nation had been
living on its capital and liking it.”
On the whole he took a hopeful
view of the situation—more so
than Lord LANsdown E, who ex-
pressed “the profoundest dis-
may” at our increasing indebted-
ness. Fortunately His Lordship's
gloomy prophecies have not in-
= variably proved correct.
After Question-time in the Com-
mons Mr. BottomLEY made bitter
complaint to the SPEAKER that
he had been evicted from his
favourite corner-seat by the Mem-
ber for South-East St. Pancras.
Mr. Lowther administered chilly
consolation. These little con-

ing to Lord STRATHSPEY there are
thousands of men in the Army longing
to take Orders in the Church Militant,
but there are no funds available for
training them, and no prospect of a
living wage for them if ordained. The
LoRD CHANCELLOR's sympathetic re-
ferences to the painful plight of men
whose duty it was to preach content
here and hereafter will no doubt be
reflected in the administration of his
not inconsiderable patronage. Fortun-
ately or unfortunately the clergy cannot
or will not “down surplices" to im-
prove their condition.
The unrest in other sections of the
working-classes was further examined
from various angles. Lord RIBBLESDALE
would like them to take a greater share
in the profits, and also in the “re-
sponsibilities and vicissitudes " of in-
dustry. But this suggestion will hardly
appeal to them if, as Lord LEVERHULME
declared, Labour would have made a
poor bargain if it had swapped its in-
creased wages for all the excess profits
made during the War. Lord HALDANE's
view, as perhaps you would expect, was
that neither Capital nor Labour, but the
“organised mind,” was the principal
agent in producing wealth. Altogether
it was an informing debate, which the
Government might do worse than re-
produce in pamphlet form for the
instruction of the public.
On the news of the attack on M.
CLEMENCEAU reaching the Commons
there was a general desire that the
House should pass a resolution of sym-
pathy. But Mr. BoxAR LAw deprecated
the proposal. as being, in his opinion,
“against all precedent"—not a little
to the surprise of some of the new
Members, who thought that in a case
like this the conseil du précèdent might
bow to the Président du Conseil.
In the procedure debate a strong de-
mand was made that a full official report
of the speeches delivered in the six Grand
Committees should be issued. But the
Attorney-GENERAL pointed out that
everything was already reported “ex-
cept the talk,” and found a powerſul
supporter in Sir Edward CARson, who
believed that no official reports would
have any effect in keeping Ministers to
their pledges. Hansard is as Hansard
does, is his motto.

such a rule had been enforced in the

The shortage of whisky and brandy
for medicinal purposes was the subject
of many indignant questions. Mr.
McCURdy, for the FooD-CoNTROLLER,
stated that it had been found imprac-
ticable to allot supplies of spirits for
this purpose, but, perhaps wisely, did
not give any reasons. Can it be that
the Government, contemplating the
extension of the “all-dry” principle to
this country, are anxious to give no en-
couragement to the “drug-store habit"?

And a sort of sound like a grumbling,
And out there popped, as pert as you please,
A milky back tooth that had taken its ease
For too many weeks and months and years.
An object, when loose, of anxious fears,
It had now debouched and lost its place
At the back of a startled schoolboy's face.
Oh, out it popped,
And down it dropped

Mother (to little girl who had been sent to the hen-house for eggs). “WELL, DEAR, were THERE No Eggs?"
Little Girl. “No, MUMMIE, ONLY THE ONE THE HENS USE FOR A PATTERN."
THE BEAUTIFUL words.
I HAVE to tell an unvarnished tale of
real and recent life in London. When
the absence of impulsive benevolence
and public virtue is so often insisted
upon it is my duty to put the following
facts on record.
It was, as it now always is, a wet
day. The humidity not only descended
from a pitiless sky, but ascended from
the cruel pavements which cover the
stony heart of that inexorable step-
mother, London. Need I say that under
these conditions no cabs were obtain-
able? In other words it was one of those
days, so common of late, when other
people engage the cabs first. They were
plentiful enough, full. One could have
been run over and killed by them
twenty times between Trafalgar Square
and Piccadilly Circus, but all teemed
with selfish life. Men of ferocious con-
centration and women detestable in
their purposefulness were to be seen
through the passing windows. It was
a day on which no one ever got out of
a cab at all, except to tell it to wait,
No flag was ever up. Since the bless-
ing of peace began to be ours these days
have been the rule.
Not only were the cabs all taken and
reserved till to-morrow, but the 'buses
were overcrowded too. A line of sway-
ing men, steaming from the deluge, in-
tervened in every 'bus between two
rows of seated women, also steaming.
It was a day on which the conductors
and conductresses were always ringing
the bell three times. -
There was also (for we are very
thorough in England) a strike on the
Tube and the Underground.
Having to get to Harley Street, I
walked up Regent Street, doing my
best to shelter beneath an umbrella,
and (being a believer in miracles) turn-
ing my head back at every other step
in the hope that a cab with its flag up
might suddenly materialise; but hop-
ing against hope. It was miserable,
it was depressing, and it was really
rather shameful: by the year 1919 A.D.
(I thought) more should have been
achieved by boastful mankind in the
direction of weather control.
And then the strange thing happened
which it is my purpose and pride to
relate. A taxi drew up beside me and
I was hailed by its occupant. In a
novel the hailing voice would be that
of a lady or a Caliph incog., and it
would lure me to adventure or romance.
But this was desperately real damp
beastly normal life, and the speaker
was merely a man like myself.
“Hullo!” he said, calling me by
name, and following the salutation by
the most grateful and comforting words
that the human tongue could at that
moment utter.
Every one has seen the Confession
Albums, where complacent or polite
visitors are asked to state what in their
opinion is the most beautiful this and
that and the other, always including
“the most beautiful form of words.”

KEATs or SHAKSPEARE ; flippant per-
sons write “Not guilty” or “Will you
have it in notes or cash 2 ” or “This
way to the exit.” Henceforth I shall
be in no doubt as to my own reply. I
shall set down the words used by this
amazing god in the machine, this
prince among all princely bolts from
the blue. “Hullo,” he said, “let me
give you a lift.”
I could have sobbed with joy as I
entered the cab–perhaps I did sob
with joy—and heard him telling the
driver the number in Harley Street for
which I was bound.
That is the story—true and rare.
How could I refrain from telling it
when impulsive benevolence and public
virtue are so rare 2. It was my duty.
BOOK-BOOMING.
(With grateful acknowledgments to the
leading Masters of this delectable art.)
Messrs. Puffington and Co. beg to
announce the immediate issue of
Charity Blueblood, by Faith Redfern.
Speaking ex cathedrá, with a full con-
sciousness of their responsibilities, they
have no hesitation in pronouncing their
assured conviction that this novel will
take its place above all the classics of
fiction.
Here is not only a Thing of Beauty,
but a Joy for Ever, wrought by elfin
fingers, fashioned of gossamer threads
at once fine and prehensile. Yet so Gar-
gantuan and Goliardic that the reader
holds his breath, lest the whole beatific
caboodle should vanish into thin air
and leave him lamenting like a Peri
shut out from Paradise.
But this is more than a Paradise. It
is a Pandemonium, a Pantosocratic
Pantechnicon and a Pantheon as well.
For here, within the narrow, compass
of 750 pages (price 7s. 11; d.), we find
all the glory that was Greece and the
grandeur that was Rome; the Olym-
pian serenity of HoMER, the pity and
terror of Æschylus, the poignancy
of CATULLUs, the saucy mirth of
ARIstoph ANEs, the sanity of SHAK-
speARE, the macabre gruesomeness of
BAUDELAIRE, the sardonic rictus of
HEINE and the geniality of TRoDLOPE.
All this and much more.
Here, as we turn every page, we
expect to meet Rosalind and Jeanie
Deans, Tom Jones and Aramis, Mr.
Micawber and Madame Bovary, Eu-
génie Grandet and Colonel Newcome,
Casanova and Casabianca, Consuelo and
“CAGLIOSTRo,” and, if we do not meet
them, we encounter new and more
radiant figures, compared with whom
the others are as water to wine.

cacophony and cachinnation, is Life,

such as you and I know it, not life in
absolute déshabillé, but enveloped in
the iridescent upholstery of genius,
sublimated by the wizardry of a trans-
cendental polyphony. - -
Here, soaring high above the ceno-
taph in which the roses and rapture of
our youth lie entombed in one red
burial blent, we see the shimmering
strands of St. Martin's Summer drawn
athwart the happenless days of Autumn,
with the dewdrops of cosmic unction
sparkling in the rays of a sunshine
never yet seen on land or sea, but re-
flecting as in a magic mirror that
far-off lºl Dorado, that land where
Summer always is “i-cumen in,” for
which each and all of us feel a per-
petual nostalgia.
Here, in fine, gentle reader, is a work
of such colossal force that to render
justice to its abysmal greatness we
have ransacked the vocabulary of super-
lative laudation in vain. Sw1NBURNE,
compared to the needs of the situation,
is as a shape of quivering jelly alongside
of the Rock of Gibraltar. And here, O
eaptious critic, is a Wonderwork which
not only disarms but staggers, para-
lyses and annihilates all possibilities of
animadversion, unless you wish to share -
the ſate of Marsyas, by pitting your
puny strength against the overwhelm-
ing panoply of divine and immortal
genius. -
“A bricklayer's labourer was remanded
yesterday on a charge of stealing, as bailee, two
matches, value 1.3, the property of the Vicar

We fear there has been bad profiteering
somewhere; even in London they have
not touched that price.
“Howells' new violin conato (E flat), which
fololwed, is sincere music . . . whatever there
is it is possible to bear.”—Times.
The fololwing of a conata, like the
bombination of a chimaera, apparently
puts some strain upon the attention of
an audience. -

[FEBRUARY 26, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LE FRANÇAIS TEL QUE L'ON
LE PARLE.
It was on my journey to Paris that
I ran across little Prior in the train.
He too was going, he said, on Peace
Conference work. His is a communi-
cative disposition and before we had
fairly started on our journey he had
unfolded his plans. He said the Con-
ference was bound to last a long time,
and as a resident in a foreign country
he had a splendid opportunity to learn
the language. He meant, he said, to
get to know it thoroughly later on. He
then produced his French Pronounc-
ing Handbook. -
I thought I knew French pretty well
until I saw that book. It gave Prior
expressions to use in the most casual |
conversation that I have never heard of
in my life. It had a wonderful choice
of words. Only an experienced philo-
logist could have told you their exact
origin.
The handbook had foreseen every
situation likely to arise abroad; and I
think it overrated one's ordinary ex-
periences. I have known people who
have resided in France for years and
never once had occasion to ask a bil-
liard-marker if he would “Envoyer-mous
des crachoirs.” Most people can rub
along on a holiday quite cheerfully
without a spittoon; but then the hand-
book never meant you to be deprived of
home comforts for the want of asking.
Nor did it intend, with all its oily
phraseology, that you should be im-
posed on. There is a scene in a “print-
shop" over the authenticity of an en-
graving which gets to an exceedingly
painful climax.
A good deal of reliance is placed on
the innate courtesy of the French. For
it appears that, after an entire morning
spent at the stationer's, when the shop-
keeper has discussed every article he
has for sale, you wind up by saying,
“Je prendrai une petite bouteille d'encre
moire,” and all that long-suffering man
retorts is, “J'voo zanqvairay ler pah-
kay,” which is not nearly so bolshev-
istic as it looks.
Prior said he was going to start to
speak French directly he got on board
the steamer—he had learnt that part off
by heart already. The first remark he
must make was, “Send the Captain to
me at once." There is no indication of
riot or uproar at this. Evidently the
Captain is brought without the slightest
difficulty, for in the very next line we
find Prior saying, “Etes-vous le Capi-
taine " " and he goes on to inquire
about his berth.
The Captain tells him everything
there is to know about berths and then
apparently offers to take down his lug-
gage, for Prior is commanding, “Take
care of my carpet-bag, if you please.”
They then begin to discuss the wea-
ther. “In what quarter is the wind?”
asks the indefatigable Prior.
“The wind,” says the Captain, “is in
the north, in the south, in the east, in
the south-west. It will be a rough
passage. It will be very calm.”
Prior does not seem to observe that
the Captain appears to be hedging.
This wealth of information even pleases
him, and then quite abruptly he de-
mands, “Donnez-moi une couverture,”
because, as he goes on to explain, he
“feels very sick." This gives the
“Capitaine” an opportunity to escape.
He says, “I will send the munition-
naire.” - -
Undoubtedly that Captain has a
sense of the ridiculous. I like the man.
Anyone who could, on the spur of the
moment, describe the steward as the
munitionnaire deserves to rank as one
of the world's humourists. But Prior is
apparently in no condition to see a joke.
He says he will have the munitionnaire
instantly bringing in his hand “un
verre d'eau de vie.”
I was really sorry that in the bustle
of embarking I lost sight of Prior and
therefore could not witness the meeting
between him and the Captain. It
would have made me happy for the
whole day.
The crossing was prolonged, for we
took a zig-zag course to avoid any little
remembrances Fritz might have left us
in the form of mines. When we were
nearing land I saw Prior again. He
was stretched out on a deck-chair and
looked up with a ghastly smile as he
caught sight of me.
“Hullo, you're alone!" I said rather
cruelly. “Is this the stage where the
Captain goes to find the munition-
naire?”
Then he spoke, but it was not in the
words of the phrase-book. It was in
clear, concise, unmistakable English.
“Can you tell me,” he asked, and
behind his words lay a suggestion of
quiet force of despair, “about what
hour of the day or night this cursed
boat is likely to get to Boolong?”
“Evens are moving rapidly in connection
with the plan by the Government, announced
only yesterday, to call a national industrial
conference.”—Daily Paper.
We are glad the odds are not against it.
Notice in a German shop-window
(British zone):--
“Jon con have jour

The Germans seem to be getting over
their dislike to British steel.
COMMERCIAL COMFORT.
[“Mines are spottily good. Oils maintain
a healthy undertone.”
Stock Erchange Report.j
O welcome message of the tape!
O words of comfortable cheer!
You bring us promise of escape
Into a balmier atmosphere;
Though Ireland with sedition boils
And shrieks aloud, “Ourselves
Alone '': -
Still mines are good in spots, and oils
Maintain a healthy undertone.
Though dismal Jeremiahs wail
Of Bolshevists within our gates,
And, though the Master of The Mºl
In sad seclusion vegetates,
The rising tide of gloom recoils
Once the inspiring news is known
That mines are good in spots, and oils
Maintain a healthy undertone.
An over-sanguine mood is wrong
And ought to be severely banned ;
Yet spots, if good, cannot belong
To the pernicious leopard brand ;
But no such reservation spoils
The sequel; doubt is overthrown
By the explicit statement, “Oils
Maintain a healthy undertone.”
Not, you'll remark, the savage growl
Of the exasperated bear, -
Nor the profound blood-curdling howl
Of the gorilla in its lair;
Nor yet the roar in civic broils
That surges round a tyrant's throne—
Oh, no, the organ voice of oils
Is healthy in its undertone.
O blessed jargon of the mart |
Though your commercial meaning's
hid
From me, a layman, to my heart
You bring a soothing mescio quid;
Amid the flux of strikes and plots
Two things at present stand like
stone: -
In mines the goodness of their spots,
In oils their healthy undertone.
Extract from a recent story:—
“Noiselessly we crept from the tent. The
sands, the sea, the cliffs, were bathed in silver
white by a glorious tropical moon. Noise-
lessly we levelled it to the ground, rolled it
up, and carried it to the boat.”
And that night the Gothas were foiled.
“The subject of a war memorial was con-
sidered at a St. Sidwell's, Excter, parish
meeting. Many suggestions were offered,
among them one that the present seating in
the parish church should be replaced by plush-
covered tip-up seats, such as are in use at
kinemas and other places of entertainment."
Western Morning News.
If the suggestion is adopted it is pre-
sumed that the name of the church will
be altered to St. Sitwell.

he rightly suspects of occupying too much room in the
reflections of his wife. In other words, the simple life at
its most suspicious, with the rude forefathers of the hamlet
supplying a scandalous chorus. The strongest part of the
story is the tragedy, suggested with a poignancy almost too
vivid, of the wretched elder woman, tortured in mind and
body, morbidly aware of the contrast between her own
decay and the vitality of her rival. As to Inglebury and
Mary, the causes of all the pother, they struck me as con-
spicuously unworth so much fussing over; and, when their
final flight together landed them—well ºhere it did, I could

The Three Black Pennys (HEINEMANN) is a story that
began by perplexing and ended by making a complete con-
quest of me. Its author, Mr. Joseph HERGESHEIMER, is, I
think, new to this side of the Atlantic ; the publishers tell
me (and, to prevent any natural misapprehension, I pass
on the information at once) that he belongs to “a Pennsyl-
vania Dutch family, settled for many generations in
Philadelphia.” Which being so, one can enjoy his work
with a free conscience. It certainly seems to me very
unusual in quality. The theme of the tale is the history of
the Penny family, or rather of the periodical outcrop in it
of a certain strain that produces Pennys dark of counten-
ance and incalculable of conduct. This recurrence is shown

many names will stand higher
in any country than that of our
English writer, HEctoR Hugh
MUNRo, whose subtle and witty
satires, stories and fantasies
were put forth under the pseu-
donym “SARI.” I have but to
name The Chronicles of Clovis

know what their loss was when
MUNRo (who, although over
age, had enlisted as a private
and refused a commission) fell
fighting in the Beaumont-Hamel
action in November 1916. Mr.
John LANE has brought out, un-
der the title The Toys of Peace,
a last collection of “SAKI's"
fugitive works, with a sympa-
thetic but all too brief memoir
by Mr. Roth AY REYNoLDs.
Although “SARI” is only occa-
sionally at his very best in this
volume—on the grim side, in
“The Interlopers,” and in his
more familiar irresponsible and
high-spirited way in “A Bread-
and-Butter Miss" and “The
Seven Cream Jugs; ” although
there may be no masterpiece of fun or raillery to put
beside, say, “Esmé;” there is in every story a phrase or
fancy marked by his own inimitable felicity, audacity or
humour. It is good news that a complete uniform edition
of his books is in preparation.
I can't help feeling that Is ABEL EccLEston E MACKAY's
chief aim in Up the Hill and Over (HURST AND BLACKETT)
was to write a convincing tract for the times on a subject
which is achieving unhappy prominence in America as in
our own police-courts. A worthy aim, I doubt not. One
of the chief characters is a drug-taker; and as if that were
not enough another is “out of her head,” while a third,
Dr. Callandar, the Montreal specialist, is in the throes of a
nervous breakdown. This seems to me to be distinctly
overdoing it. It is the doctor's love-story (a story so com-
F. that I cannot attempt a précis) which is the
esignedly central but actually subordinate theme. I have
the absurd idea that this might really have begun life
as a pathological thesis and suffered conversion into a
novel. The author has no conscience in the matter of

Howart Penny, in the days when
men wore powder and the Penny
forge had just been started in
what was then a British colony;
the next, Jasper, involved in a
murder trial in the sixties; and,
last of the black Pennys, another
Howart, in whom the family
energy has thinned to a dilet-
tante appreciation of the arts,
dying alone amongst his collec-
tions. You can see from this
outline that the book is inci-
dentally liable to confound the
skipper, who may find himself
confronted with (apparently) the
same character tying a periwig
on one page and hiring a taxi
on another. I am mistaken
though if you will feel inclined
to skip a single page of a novel
at once so original and well-
told. As a detail of criticism I
had the feeling that the “black-
ness” of the Penny exceptions
would have shown up better
had we seen more of the family
in its ordinary rule; but of
the power behind Mr. HERGEs-
'HEIMER's work there can be no
question. He is, I am sure, an artist upon a quite unusual
scale, from whom great things may be anticipated.
If neither book of short stories before me is what Ameri-
cans call “the goods,” I can, at any rate, say that Ancient
Mariners (MILLs AND Boon) does infinite credit to Mr.
MoRLEY Roberts's imagination. These yarns of seafaring
men are salt with the savour of the sea and with the
language thereof. Of the seven my favourite is “Potter's
Plan,” which not only contains the qualities to be found in
the other half-dozen, but also has an ingenuity all its own.
But perhaps you will prefer “A Bay Dog-Watch," as
coming home to the general bosom, for it deals with a
ferocious hunt after matches which recalls the deadly days
of the shortage. Of the five stories in Mr. WARwick
DEEPING's Countess Glika (CASSELL) the best is “Bitter
Silence.” Here the author deals with essentials, and gives
us a tale entirely free from artificiality. The remaining
stories are marred by their lack of naturalness; but Mr.
DEEPING is never at a loss for incident, and he can write
dialogue which is often gay and sometimes witty.

THE TONIC OF MARCH.
(With acknowledgments to the author).
Most H of the Winds (especially the East)
That staunch the young year's floods by dyke and
dam,
Who enter like a lion, that great beast,
And make your egress like a woolly lamb;
Who come, as Mars full-armed for battle's shocks,
From lethargy of Winter's sloth to wean us,
Then melt (about the vernal equinox),
As he did in the softer arms of Venus;–
O Month, before your final moon is set,
Much may have happened—anything, in fact;
More than in any March that I have met
(Last year excepted) fearful nerves are racked;
Anarchy does with Russia what it likes;
Paris is put conundrums very knotty;
And here in England, with its talk of strikes,
Men, like your own March hares, seem going dotty.
Blow, then, with all your gales and clear our skies!
We did not win that War the other day
To please the Huns or gladden TRotsky's eyes
By fighting, kin with kin, this futile way;
Blow—not too hard, of course—I should not care
To inconvenience Mr. WILSON on his voyage—
But just enough to clean the germy air
And usher in the universal Joy-Age. O. S.
GOOD-BYE TO THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
II.--THE SHIP's CoMPANY.
DEMOBILISATION in the Navy, whatever it may be in the
Army, is a simple affair. You are first sent for by the
Master-at-Arms, who glares, thrusts papers into your
trembling hand and ejects you violently in the direction
of the Demobilising Office. Here they regard you curiously,
stifle a yawn, languidly inspect your papers and send you
to the Paymaster, who, after wandering disconsolately
round the Pay Office, exclaiming pathetically, “I say, hasn't
anyone seen that Mixed Muster book? It must be some-
where, you know,” returns you without thanks to the D.O.,
where they tell you to call again in three days' time. On
returning you are provided with a P.I.C. and numerous
necessary papers, requested to sign a few dozen forms,
overwhelmed with an unexpected largesse of pay and sent
forth on that twenty-eight days' leave from which no
traveller returns. There's nothing in it at all; the whole
thing only lasts four days. They do it by a system, I believe.
As we assembled on iº for the last time, awaiting our
railway warrants, there were some moving spectacles. The
Mate and the Second Engineer were bidding each other
affectionate and tearful farewells behind the winch. “You
won't quite forget me, Bill, will yer?” I heard the Second
exclaim brokenly, but the only reply was a strangled sob.
The Steward, seated on his kit-bag, was murmuring a snatch
of song that asserted the rather personal fact that “our
gel's a big plump lass.” He is an oyster-dredger in civil
life and is eagerly looking forward to experiencing once
more the delicate thrills and excitement of this hazardous
sport. Jones, our Signaller, who recently wrote a poem
which opened with the lines,
‘‘I for one will be surprised
When we are demobilised,”
was struggling painfully to insert a pair of boots into a
recalcitrant kit-bag, and exhibited an expression of dogged
determination rather than the astonishment he had pre-
dicted. The Trimmer was heard complaining mournfully
that when he left the Patrol Office for the last time they
never said good-bye. He seemed to feel this keenly.
All of us were more or less excited, all as it were on tip-
toe with expectancy, like school-boys on breaking-up morn-
ing. All, did I say? No, there was one member of the crew
who sat supremely indifferent to the prevailing atmosphere
of emotion, gazing calmly before him with his solitary lack-
lustre eye. The Silent Menace, the ship's dog, betrayed
none of our childlike sentiment. Demobilisation was nothing
to him—he was too old a campaigner to let a little matter
like that agitate his habitual reserve. To us the recent
period of hostilities had been “The War,” the only war in
which we had ever been privileged to fight; but to him it was
just one of the numberless affrays of an adventurous life,
and, judging by the worn condition of his ears and the
veteran scars that tattooed his tail, some of the previous
ones had had their share of frightfulness. And to-morrow,
no doubt, he will try the game again.
It was the Third Hand who suddenly propounded the
unsolvable question: “Who’s goin' to keep that there
Menace 2''
There was an almost universal chorus of “Me!” I say
“almost universal" because Jones, who is R.N.V.R. and
educated, probably said, “I,” and the Chief Engineer was
lighting his pipe and merely succeeded in blowing the
match out.
“You can't all have him,” said the Third Hand, “so I
think I'll take him along with me. I knows a bit about
dawgs.”
There was instant and clamant disapproval, each one of
us urging an unquestionable claim to the guardianship of
the orphan Menace. The Steward said he was the only
one with the ghost of a right to the dog; had it not always
been the Menace's custom to help him wash up the plates
and dishes? A Deck Hand, however, protested that as he
had eaten one of his mittens the Silent Menace was already
in part his property. The Mate and the Second Engineer
nearly came to blows about it. -
The question was still unsettled when the warrants
arrived. As time was short it was finally decided that
whomsoever he should follow was to be adjudged his future
owner. We climbed ashore and spread out fanwise, look-
ing back and uttering those noises best calculated to incline
the unyielding heart of the Menace towards us. He him-
self rose from the deck and strolled on to the wharf, where
he stood coolly regarding us. Without emotion his Cyclo-
pean orb direeted its gaze from one to another till, midway
between the Third Hand and the Second-Engineer, it was
observed to irradiate a sudden and unaccustomed luminosity.
“Come along then, Menace,” wheedled the Second.
“Yoicks, old dawg" exclaimed the Third Hand, patting
his knee encouragingly.
But they had misinterpreted their Menace, for in the
middle distance, on a pile of timber directly behind the
expectant twain, had appeared the sleek person of a sandy
cat which proved to be the attraction. For an instant
the Menace stood motionless, his spine bristling and his
tail growing stiff; then with a short sharp bark he sprang
forward like an arrow from a bow in the direction of the
feline objective. We saw a streak of yellow as she fled for
safety and life; a cloud of dust, and the Menace and his
quarry disappeared from view. Faintly from afar floated
an eager yelp, telling that the chase was still in full cry.
“Well, sink me,” said the Second-Engineer, “that settles
it.”
There were trains to be caught, and so, slowly and sadly,
we turned away.
Thus did the Silent Menace, with the rest of his ship-
mates, bid good-bye to the Auxiliary Patrol.

THE ROAD TO THE RHINE.
A LITTLE Loot.
It was at the time when men still
imagined that to be a pivotal man in
some way enhanced their chances of
being demobilised that an abnormal
wave of acquisitiveness passed over us.
Before it passed, I regret to say, it
hovered, chiefly on account of the
prospect of a speedy return home and
the desire to take back some kind of
trophy to satisfy the still small voice
of inquiry concerning papa and the
Great War. -
The very first day after we had
arrived in the most unimportant village
imaginable (our usual luck), Roley, the
fattest subaltern on record, lurched
into the room and told T
us of the discovery of a
wonderful trainload of º
abandoned Bosch material.ſº
Being a Regular soldier, ſº
acquisitiveness runs
through his whole being, -
of course, and he gave us º
a most glowing account of º
the wonders to be found. | *%
“Full of things,” he cried; ſº
“coal, Bosch beds, field-
guns and souvenirs—hun-
dreds of 'em.” º
I know no rabbit that | *
could have pricked up his
ears quicker than did the
pivotal men at the sound
of that magic word. “Hail,
Roley !” we cried; “we
who are about to be de-
mobilised salute you!”
That evening a select
conclave of super-scroun-
gers met with great solem-
nity. Beds for the men!
Chardenal and I had picked up the
best thing we could find, brass cartridge
cases (about three feet high) of a 5.9
gun, and some shorter eight - inch
affairs. It was hard work. I carried
four of the former and Chardenal
carried two of each, and we looked as
if we had come to mend a main drain.
Not having been in the Army long
enough to have lost all sense of shame,
Chardenal began by trying to hide his
cases under his British warm. His
biggest effort at concealment was made
when passing the sentry of the Brigade
Headquarters' guard, and the noise
he made doing it brought the whole
guard out. However, being sentries,
they took very little notice of what we
did, except that the N.C.O. in charge

have made more noise than we did as
we clashed and clanged down the main
street. Of course we met everybºdy
we knew. People we hadn't seen for
years, people we didn't like, people
who didn't like us—all seemed to have
been paraded especially for the occasion.
We got home in the end, and it was
a great triumph. The only unenthusi-
astic person was Mr. Brown, my bat-
man, who surveyed the things in silence,
betokening that he knew quite well he
would be called upon to sew them up
in sacking and label them “Officer's
Spare Kit, c/o Cox and Co." Then he
looked sadly at my soiled tunic and my
British warm and asked if I had carried
them far. “Over two miles,” I replied
proudly. “Pity,” he said; “there's a
-- whole dump of them at
!/ the bottom of the garden
/ here.”
/ There the matter might
* / have ended if the fat Roley
had not lurched up again
the next day with a steel
box containing a dial-sight
º! off a field-gun. The dial-
sight was a complicated
affair of prisms and lenses
which probably cost the
Bosch about sixty pounds,
and we felt a little sick at
having overlooked such a
find.
“Awful job I had too,”
he went on. “Some fel-
lows were seen yesterday
taking stuff away and
they've put a sentry on
the train.”
“Serve them right,” we
said.
Next day we returned
to the trucks to try again.
and coal for all—certainly, and then we
would start collecting. By the morrow
each man slept in luxury, while sub-
alterns from other companies came in
to warm themselves by our roaring
fires. Not till then did we feel justified
in turning our thoughts to the furnish-
ing of the baronial hall at home.
Some day, we pivotal men are still
ready to believe, when demobilisation
is nearly complete we shall return to
our bowler hats and civic respectability,
but meantime, let me tell you, respect-
able elderly subalterns enjoy things like
clambering over a forbidden Bosch
train in search of loot. When we had
climbed to the end of the trucks and
were thoroughly dirty, we found we had
done very badly. The souvenirs were
there all right, but no matter how inter-
esting and desirable it may be, you
simply cannot pack up a field-gun and
send it home—the tail part does stick
out so.
certainly did pick up one of the dropped
cases and hand it to Chardenal. This
was after I had tried to help him and
we had dropped the whole lot.
After this Chardenal gave up all idea
of concealment and tried to express by
his carriage that he accepted no respon-
sibility whatever for the souvenirs. He
didn't want the things, not hel They
were there, certainly, and—well, yes,
he was carrying them, but why he was
carrying them (here he would have
shrugged his shoulders if he could) he
really couldn't tell you; it was a matter
of absolute indifference to him, anyway.
Histrionically I have no doubt it was
a great piece of work, but the only
possible inference anybody could have
drawn was that he might have been
carrying them to oblige me—which I
resented.
Heavens, how our arms ached, for it
was over two miles to the billet ! A

The sentry was engaged in a little
conversation, and whilst Chardenal
took his photograph (ostensibly for
The Daily Snap as “Sentry Guarding
a Train") I slipped behind the trucks,
opened a couple of lids in the tails
of some field - guns, picked out two
cases of sights and hurried off. Char-
denal joined me later and, concealing
our swag under our British warms,
we walked as quickly as we could
until the Brigadier stopped and had
a little chat with us about things in
general. And there we had to stand
for a quarter of an hour on a freezing
afternoon with two fingers holding the
box and the other fingers holding the
coat down to effect better concealment.
Chardenal was in so much pain and
wore such an expression of agonized
innocence that the Brigadier wanted
him to come into headquarters until he
felt better.
“Well, what have you got?” asked

THE enterprise of Mr. C. B. CochRAN,

used in his play at the St. Martin's
Theatre will be sold by auction at the
conclusion of the run, has not un-
naturally provoked a certain liveliness

appear in the newspapers, it is thought
likely that they may include something
like this:— -
. Desirable Family Mansion of unique
interest, suit dramatist seeking con-
genial associations. Exceptionally fine
dining-hall, as used in the supper scene
in Macbeth, and equipped with con-
venient Banquo sliding-panel to kitchen.
The latter apartment deserves the
epithet Baronial, being transported
direct from the successful pantomime,
Puss-in-Boots, and capable of accom-
modating a ballet of two hundred cooks.
The elegantly proportioned drawing-
room (to which a fourth wall has been
since added) was the subject of special
mention in several leading newspapers
after the production of Epigrams at the
Niobe Theatre; while each of the
twelve bedrooms represents some recent
triumph in the Problematical Drama.
An attractive feature is the fitting of
an artificial sunlight attachment to the
outside of each window; while every
room is provided with one or more
telephones.
Snug Bachelor Flat, direct from the
phenomenally successful farce, Peers
and Pyjamas, at the Plenipotentiaries
Theatre. The fine central living-room
contains sixteen doors, opening into bed-
rooms, kitchen, coal-cellar, etc. May
be as conveniently entered by the
window as by the doors. All the latter
work upon the well-known dramatic
hinge, by which as soon as one shuts
another opens. Unlimited facilities for
hide-and-seek. Exceptional oppor-
tunity for active tenant.

I MET Bilsden and congratulated him
on being in “civvies.”
“What are you going to do now?”
I asked. “Back to the old firm 2''
“No,” said Bilsden gravely; “when
a man has acquired the power of lead-
ing men he's thrown away in an
accountant's office, especially as the
junior member of the staff. I see no
prospect in England. I have offered
to take charge of large departments of
English firms, and be responsible for
entire supervision, but they fail to
recognise what the capacity for leader-
ship gained in the army will do. I'm
off to Ceylon — tea-planting. Just to
control big gangs of coolies and see
that they work. It will be child's play
for me. Lovely climate; elephants.
An absolutely ideal job.” -
It seemed to me on that foggy frosty
day, that to lie in a hammock in the
shade, with the temperature about
ninety, watching coolies work, would
be the perfect form of labour.
I congratulated Bilsden on having
found his metter.
Half-an-hour later I met Parkinson,
another second-loot who had just shed
his pip.
“Well, what are you going to do
now 2 " I asked.
“I’m a bit dubious,” he said.
“Try tea-planting in Ceylon,” I sug-
gested. “Elephants, spicy breezes,
swing in a hammock all day watching
coolies. My dear boy, were I twenty
years younger I should be inquiring
about a berth on the next steamer.”
“Ah,” said Parkinson, “ of course
Ceylon's all right, and I've a lot of
pals going out there; but what about
rubber-planting in the Malay Penin-
sula? They've got tigers there. That's
rather a pull.”
I admitted the attraction of tigers
to certain tastes, but not to mine. In
my case the pull, I thought, might be
on the tiger's side.
Since these interviews I have been
going the rounds of my military ac-
quaintances and I find a general feeling
in favour of Ceylon or the Malay
Peninsula.

I can see the Government intro-

(1) For the extension of the Isle of
Ceylon;

Peninsula; -
(3) For the importation of five million
coolies, estimated at the rate of five
hundred coolies each, to give employ-
ment to ten thousand second-loots;

DEAREST Poppy, You know, don't
you, that I write for the Press? You
must write, ma chère, if you want to
be dams le mourement nowadays. It's
getting to be almost as big a craze as
jazzing and is quite as exciting. It has
its difficulties, of course, but so has the
jazz roll. And if you've got a title or
have been mixed up in a cause célèbre
you can write on anything sans aucune
connaissance spéciale. Camilla Blythely
says she just sends in her photo and
signature and those obliging newspaper
people do the rest—which is most help.
ful to a busy person. But then we
can't all be as notorious as dear Camilla.
I hope it isn't getting just a little
overdone. But I hear that lots of
papers are offering only three guineas
a column now for quite important sig-
natures, while others actually insist on
contributors writing their own articles.
Quant d moi, I'm writing up the light
side of the Peace Conference. I do those
snappy pars about LLOYD GEORGE's
ties and CLEMENCEAU's gloves and all
those little domestic touches that people
would much rather read about than
such remote things as Czecho-Slovaks
and Jugo-Slavs. I did a most thrilling
three columns about the hats of the
delegates, from the bowler of Mr. BonAR
LAw to the “cofieli " and “igal” head-
dress of EMIR FAISUL, the Arab Prince.
(It's always so effective if you can stick
in a word or two like that that nobody
understands. You never need get them
right).
Talking of odd words, the latest bou-
tade over here is to find new names and
epithets for our dress materials—some
of them quite weird. If you want a
silk tricot you ask for “djersador,”
while a coarser texture is “djersacier”;
“mousseur" now describes velvet as
well as champagne; minon is known as
“vapoureuse”; while to make one of the
newest Spring dresses you require only
three-and-a-half yards of “Salomé.”
Some of the couturiers in the Rue de la
Paix are issuing fashion-pronouncing
handbooks, while others have their own
interpreters to assist customers.
The theatres over here are getting
extremely — well, what our grand-
parents termed “risqués,” but it really
goes further than that. And the worst
of it is my country people seem to think
it's the smart thing to go to them, which
they do most indiscriminately. Heur-
eusement they don't understand the
stuff. Whenever I see a most circum-
spect and highly proper British matron
entering one of the Boulevard theatres
nowadays I think what a mercy it is
that we as a nation rely so much on
pronouncing phrase-books for acquiring
foreign languages. It keeps one so
single-minded in the midst of a wicked
world.
But, after all, propriety is a question
de localité. Else why do people do things
here which would badly shock us at
home? I’ar eremple, dancing between
the courses of a meal is our latest
caprice here; but I was un peu 6tonnée,
the other evening, to see the Duchess
of Mintford, at a restaurant of the most
chic, jazzing off the effects of the turbot
with light-hearted abandon.
Unfortunately a waiter carrying a
tray darted across the track at the very
moment when she was involved in that
step so embrouillant, the side-roll.
It took quite a long time to collect, and
put in their proper order, the waiter,
the contents of the tray, her Grace and
all the other jazzers who were coming
up behind.
But, après tout, little comment was
roused because most of the onlookers
thought the incident was just part of
the dance.
So long, old thing.

Those who wield Britannia's power
Have decreed a blissful hour, .
When the mellow bugle-note
Sounds in every ship afloat,
And you see the forrard decks
Littered up with leathernecks,
Seamen sprawling on the hatches,
Darning socks and fitting patches,
Cleaning jumpers, sewing, smoking,
Writing, fighting, sleeping, joking,
Baiting foe and twitting friend—
Sailors call it “Make and Mend.”
In this jolly throng each day
Gunner 'Erbert, R.M.A.,
Sat and smoked serenely bored,
So that I must needs record .
When that precious hour was ended
He had neither made nor mended.
'Erbert was a crumpled rose
In the beds of N.C.O.'s,
And a blot on the escutcheon
Which they pride themselves so
much on ;

Cells and badges lost, or worse,
Captain's frown or sergeants' oaths,
'Erbert wouldn't mend his clothes.

Certain tribes got out of hand,
And, to comfort little Mary,
Sought to stew the missionary.
Our Marines were duly sent
To apportion chastisement,
And they snatched him from the
larder,
But alas! pursuing harder
Than was wise in such a scrap,
They were landed in a trap.
For the wily natives got
All around and copped the lot,
Stripping off them every stitch
Of the clothes they stood in, which,
I am sure you'll all agree,
Was a great indignity.
Copped the lot 2 No, there was one
Absent when the deed was done.
'Erb, with his accustomed push,
Was advancing when the bush
Dragged the last remaining stitches
From the bag he called his breeches,
Leaving nothing but the dregs
Of the red stripe down his legs.
'Erbert paused; though not a prude,
He had never liked the nude.
Seated in a distant clearing
He remarked the natives cheering,
And, directed by the din,
Saw the plight his mates were in.
When he thought the time was ripe,
Clad in little but his stripe
'Erbert charged . . . The tribes in
wonder
Promptly bolted with the plunder.
'Erbert with averted head
Quickly gathered every shred
Of his late-lamented kit,
Saying, as he handed it
To the Major, “I inſer
You have lost your breeches, Sir,"
With his glasses in his hands
On his deck the Captain stands,
Watching with surprise and fear
His detachment reappear—
First the Major, garbed in dirt
And the tail of 'Erbert's shirt;
Then the Sergeant, better dressed
In the sleeves of 'Erbert's vest;
Then the rest in fragments torn
From the jumper he had worn.
Last comes 'Erbert, proud as NELsoN,
With a smile and nothing else on.
Is it Fortune's final stroke,
Or the Skipper's little joke?
As the ladder they ascend
Comes the bugle “Make and Mend.”

ON AT THE PRESENT MOMENT, I BLEW INTO Cox's ON THE WAY HERE, oN The OFF-
THE RIGHTS OF LABOUR.
(Extract from “The Times and Mail" of January 1st, 1925.)
A significant case was heard yesterday in the courts,
when William Blogg, bricklayer's labourer, recovered twenty-
five pounds damages from James Ruskin Carruthers, artist,
for injury done to the plaintiff's eight-cylinder car through ||
defendant's culpable negligence in allowing himself to be
run over by it. - . . . . * - -
Plaintiff urged that he was a labouring-man, who worked
eight hours a day. The court was at once adjourned, while
restoratives were applied to the Bench. * - -
On the resumption of the proceedings it was explained
that since the passing of the Two Hours Maximum Day
Bill the supply of labour had been inadequate to meet the
demands made upon it, and plaintiff had patriotically filled
four posts, at the minimum rate of fifteen shillings an hour.
It was while he was hurrying from one sphere of activity to
another that the collision occurred, resulting in injury to
the plaintiff's mud-guard and loss of valuable time. -
Defendant, who admitted negligence, pleaded poverty and
threw himself upon the mercy of the Court. * -
The Bench, in summing up, called the jury's attention to
the fact that defendant was not a labourer, but only a pro-
fessional man; at the same time he reminded them of the
impartiality of British justice, which did not admit that
there was one law for the rich and another for the poor.
I’ven the wealthiest labouring-man must be protected in
the exercise of his inalienable right to work.
The accompanying photograph shows the plaintiff in the
act of assisting to build a wall. He is a self-made man,
having started life as a solicitor and by sheer perseverance
raised himself to the lucrative and responsible position of
an unskilled bricklayer's labourer. º -
TO M. GEORGES CLEMENCEAU.
STRoNG son of France, whose words were ever lit
By lightning flashes of ironic wit; - -
More fond of power than of pelf or place,
Eternal foeman of the mean and base,
And always ready in a righteous cause
To suffer odium and contemn applause—
Men call you still the “tiger," but the name
Has long outworn the faintest hint of blame,
Since in your country's direst hour of need
You have revealed your true heroic breed;
A tiger—yes, to enemies and Huns,
But trusted, idolised, by France's sons.
So when of late a traitor's felon blow
Was like to lay you, old and ailing, low,
And, France was sorely stricken in her Chief,
The wide world shared her anguish—and relief;
For the assassin, resolute to kill,
Was foiled by your indomitable will.
Immortal France! she cannot spare you yet,
Till you have paid in full your filial debt,
And by the great Redemption and Release
Stamped Victory with the final seal of Peace.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, February 24th.--THE mantle
of the lamented Mr. Joseph KING,
whose taste in protégés was so re-
markable, seems to have descended
upon Colonel WEDGwood. His re-
quest for the return to this country
of LAJPAT RAI, “the Indian patriot,”
aroused a storm of objection from other
hon. Members, who considered the
description inapplicable to a person de-
ported for sedition. But it was quickly
quelled by the SPEAKER with the
unanswerable assertion that “every-
body calls himself a patriot in these
days.” -
Mr. RAPER sought an assurance
that no “wrack"—which appears to
be a term of art in the timber trade—
should be used in the houses to be
erected under the Government's new
housing scheme. If these were not to
be “the unsubstantial fabric of a
vision,” he implied, the official builders
had better leave the wrack behind.
Something is at last to be done to
reduce the growing plague of Questions.
Hitherto each Member has been en-
titled to put down eight Questions for
oral reply on any one day. But in
future no one is to be permitted to
“star" more than four Questions per
diem. Even that is regarded by some
Members as an extravagant allowance.
Major HENNEssy, I understand, thinks
“three stars” enough for any man.
“The Government is not a trustee
for one class, but for all,” was the
leading theme of the PRIME MINISTER's
firm and tactful speech in introducing
the Coal Industry Commission Bill.
He was studiously conciliatory to the
miners, but made it plain that they
could not be allowed to put a pistol at
the head of the general community.
The miners appear, however, to be
in the mood of the little girl who said,
“I don't want to go to bed;
I want to be in bed.” The
gist of eloquent speeches
delivered on their behalf
by Mr. HARTshorn and
Mr. RICHARDs was that
the Government already
possessed all the relevant
facts, and should give the
desired relief at once. But
they mustered only 43 in
the Division Lobby against
257 for the Second Read-
1 in gº.
ºutday February 25th.
— Their Lordships re-
sumed their debate on
Industrial Unrest. Lord
R Uss E L L attributed it
mainly to ignorance—on
the part of the capitalists
and the newspapers, who, with few
exceptions, never gave fair play to
Labour. He was supported to some
extent by His Grace of York, who
declared that, after a perusal of the
Labour Press and the non-Labour Press,
he could hardly believe they were deal.

sion Bill in the Commons was not
encouraging. The Labour representa-
tives moved amendment after amend-
ment, designed either to wreck the
measure or to make the Commission
a mere registration-office to approve
their own cut-and-dried plans.
Mr. RICHARDs moved to omit wages
and hours from its purview, but the
House, brought up in the belief that
Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark
is but a poor play, voted him down by
270 to 40.
Then came another question-begging
amendment from Mr. ADAMSON, sug-
gesting that the Commission's in-
quiries into the possibilities of reorgan-
ising the mines should be limited

to the single question of “nationali-
zation"—the “blessed word” of La-
bour just now. This was supported
in a capital maiden speech by Mr.
SPOOR, an ex-pitman, whose father
and son are both in the mines, and by
Mr. CLYNEs, who rather unreasonably
complained that the HoME SECRETARY
made SHORTT speeches; but it shared
the same fate.
Not till the Bill was nearly through
Committee was there any sign of rap-
prochement. Then, in response to the
persuasive purring of Mr. BRACE, who
had urged that the Commission should
issue an interim report on wages and
hours by March 12th, the PRIME MINIs.
TER declared that, after consultation
with Mr. Justice SANKEY, he was pre-
pared to promise that the report should
be ready on March 20th. A smile, ex-
tending almost to the extreme limits of
his moustache, spread over Mr. BRACE's
benevolent countenance. Thencefor-
ward all was peace, and the Third
Reading was carried without a division.
Wednesday, February 26th. – The
Lords passed the Coal Industry Com-
mission Bill through all its stages with-
out a pause. Then Lord DEvoNPort
expatiated on the mistakes of the Food
Controllers with such a wealth of
illustration that the Lord CHANCELLoR,
who is fond of Classical “tags,” was
heard to murmur, “Omnium consensu
capac imperii nisi imperasset.”
A Second Reading was given to the
Re-election of Ministers 13ill, on the
plea of the LoRD CHANCELLoR that
until it is passed several of his Minis-
terial colleagues will be mantes in
gurgite vasto—or, in other words, all
at Sea.
Rumours that a new Department of
Public Information was to be set up
excited much curiosity in the Commons,
but only negative replies were received.
The Department, if, and when, it comes
into existence, is not to
advertise the virtues of
the Coalition, nor is it to
publish a newspaper of its
own; though, to judge by
the leaflets, circulars and
communiqués issued by
the existing Ministries in
the course of the week,
such an organ would cer-
tainly not perish for lack
of copy.
The so-called Ten Min-
utes' Rule was originally
intended for the introduc-
tion of comparatively un-
important Bills. This after-
noon Mr.ShortTemployed

plaining the provisions of

tionary and comprehensive measures
ever brought forward in any country.
Briefly it is to put under the control of
a single Minister of Ways and Com-
munications our railways, our canals,
our roads, and also our supply of
electricity, hitherto in the hands of
hundreds of public companies and local
authorities. Only on one point did
the Bill meet with opposition. I do
not know whether Mr. Joy NSON HICKS
claims any connection with Hicks's
Hall, which stands in the old road-books
as the º of the great high-
way to the North, but he became
almost lyrical in his denunciation of
the proposal to put all the roads in the
country in charge of a railwayman like
Sir ERIC GEDDEs. They ought, in his
opinion, to be under the care of some-
one “born on roads” and “trained on
roads”—a sort of super-tramp, I sup-
pose.
Thursday, February 27th.--To an
appeal for an increase in the pensions
of Crimea and Mutiny veterans, to meet
the rise in the cost of living, response
was made that such an increase would
be granted in the case of those not over
seventy years of age. It is not thought
that the concession will cause a heavy
drain on the national resources, few of
the veterans having joined up before
entering their 'teens. -
As a retort, “Yah! German l.” is,
I am told, already considered vieuw jeu.
by the wits of the pavement. But
Ulstermen and Nationalists still think
it effective to twit one another with
having been supplied with rifles from
the arsenals of the Bosch. They bandied
charges and contradictions so vigor-
ously this afternoon that the SPEAKER
had to intervene to put an end to these
“nonsensical bickerings.”
The SECRETARY or THE TREASURY
scouted the suggestion that County
cricket - matches should be exempted
from the entertainment tax. It is be-
lieved that his answer was based solely
upon financial considerations, and that
he must not be held to have expressed
the opinion that first-class cricket, as
played by certain counties, is, in point
of fact, entertaining.
“German residents in South-west Africa
have forwarded the Administrator a petition
for transmission to President Wilson, claiming
permission to erect a republic union with the
Republic of Germany. The petitioners claim
that they not only represent a majority of the
white inhabitants, but interpret the views of
the wishes of the majority of the majority of
the ahmbahnbahmbah natives.”

THE RED WINE OF THE COUNTRY.
“Did I iver tell ye,” asked ex-Ser-
geant O'Reilly, filling his pipe from my
tobacco-jar, “about the red wine?”
“I remember a story about sparkling
Burgundy,” I said. -
“Och, that wouldn't be it at all.
'Twas another time altogither.”
“Well,” I said, “tell me about the
red wine.”
“'Twas this way.” O'Reilly leant
back in his chair, covered his maimed
hand with a pocket-handkerchief—a
curious way he had—and looked at me
with that expression of openness and
simplicity which demands confidence.
“We was 'way back o' the line at the
time, at a place where ye’d expect to get
a taste o' rest; but what wid fancy
attacks an’ ‘special coorses’ (thim's
the divil an’ all!) there wasn't enough
rest for an honest man to get into mis-
chief. Well, there was to be a grand
inshpection by a tremenjus brass-hat,
one o' thim soort all over ribbons that
rides wid a shtiff back. 'Twas the
mornin' before the great day whin the
O.C. comes to me all of a flutter, an’
says he, “Sergint, ye’ve a chanct now
to do me a good turn.'
“I’ll do it, Sorr,’ says I, ‘if it costs
me my shtripes.’
“‘The fact is,’ says he, “we’ve run
out o' claret, an’ there's no dacent
shtuff to be had for twinty miles round ;
annyway, that's what I'm tould. Now
the Gin'ral has a great fancy for red
wine.' *
“‘'Tis a sad business,’ says I.
“‘I’ve heard it whispered,’ says the
poor man, an' he wid the D.S.O. an’
all, ‘that where there's a good dhrop
o' dhrink you're the man to find it.
An’,” says he, “there's no discredit to
“‘Indeed mo, Sorr,’ says I; "'tis a
gift.”
“‘Well,' says he, “would ye use that
same gift of yours for the honour o' the
Rig'mint 2'"
O'Reilly felt in his pocket for a
tobacco-stopper, attended carefully to
his pipe and again fixed me with his
candid gaze.
“‘There's a bit of a place 'way back,'
says I, where I've a fancy I might
find somethin'.' -
“Wid that he shtuck a bunch o'
notes in me hand. ‘Don’t shpare the
cost,' says he, “but get it. 'Tis up to
you, Sergint, to save a disp'rit situa-
tion.’”
“It was a terrible responsibility,” I
Said.
“Yo may say that. Whin I was
alone wid thim notes bulgin' in me
tunic, I'd a notion I might let down
the Rig'mint afther all, an' that would
have bruk me heart. But off I wint ||
to see Achille. 'Twas four miles to the
village, an' I wint on my blessed feet,
an' by the time I got to the place I
was as nervous as a mouse in a thrap.
Achille's shop wasn't a café or an
estaminet or a buyette or anny o' thim
places. He had a bit of a brass plate
on his door wid ‘Marchand de Vins'
on it. I knew him by raison of a fancy
that took me wan day for a dhrop o'
brandy. So I wint in through Achille's
door wid thim notes as hot in me
pocket as Patsy Donelly's pipe.
“Achille hopped out o' the little room
at the back same's a bird out of a cage.
“Ah,' says he, ‘that was good cognac,
eh 2 You shall have more, me son.’
“‘Achille,’ says I, ‘'tis a shtrange
thing, but there's niver a thought o'
cognac in me mind at all. . 'Tis red
wine, the best, that I'm afther.’
“Red wine!" says he. “I haven't
a litre o' red wine in the cellars.’
“‘Holy Powers!" says I, ‘an' you
wid “Marchand de Wins” on yer door.”
The shock of it took the breath out o'
me entirely. So I sat up on the counter
to think.
“‘'Tis a matther,’ says I, ‘that con-
cerns the Rig'mint, a rig'mint that was
niver bate yet.' An' I explained about
the Gin'ral an’ what the O.C. tould
me. An' thin I tuk the notes from me
pocket an' put thim on the counther
undher his eyes. -
“‘Ach,' says he, “’tisn't money I
want from ye, but to hilp a frind.”
Then he folded his arms an' his fore-
head wint up into a puzzle o' wrinkles,
“An' why wouldn't white wine do?”
says he. :
“‘Is it offer white wine to a Gin'ral
an' him wid a taste for red 2’ says I.
‘It might rouse him terrible. Now,
Achille,’ says I, would there be no
way of makin' the white red 2’”
O'Reilly put a persuasiveness into
the last words that revealed Achille to
me as an honest merchant confronted
with the most subtle of temptations.
“O'Reilly,” I said, “was that fair?”
“Maybe not, but I'd the Gin'ral an'
the honour o' the Rig'mint fixed in me
mind. ‘That's a good joke, very good,'
says Achille; but there was niver a
smile on his face.
“‘I’d no intintion to make anny
joke,’ says I. ‘Come, Achille, you're
a knowin' man. Would there be no
way at all?'
“Now it happened that he'd liſt the
door o' the little room open, an' I could
see a bit o' a garden through the win-
dow. “What's the shtuff growin' out
there,' says I, “wid the dark red leaves
to it, or maybe yo'd call thin purple?'
“‘That's beet,' says he with a kind
of a groan.

THE ART OF LEAVING.
IF I had a son one of the first things
I should teach him would be the art of
leaving. I would have him swift in all
ways, but swiftest when the time came
to go. And when he went he should
go absolutely. For although the people
who leave slowly are bad enough, they
are as nothing compared with the
people who make false exits and return
with afterthoughts.
The other day the necessity came for
me to visit a house-agent. Life has
these chequered moments. There is
something of despatch and order want-
ing about most house-agents, possibly
the result of their very odd and difficult
business, which is for the greater part
carried on with people who don't know
their own minds and apparently are
least likely to take an eligible residence
when they most profess satisfaction
with it. Be that as it may, house agents'
offices in general have a want of definite-
ness unknown to, say, banks or pawn-
brokers'. There is no exact spot for
you to stand or sit ; you are unaware
as to which of the clerks is going to
attend to you, and the odds are heavy
that the one you approach will transfer
you to another. There is also a certain
air of familiarity or friendliness: not, of
course, approaching the camaraderie of
the dealer in motor cars, who leans
against the wall with his hands in his
pockets and talks to customers through I should see that first, and then the one
a cigarette; but something much more
human than the attitude of a female
clerk in a post-office. -
Being pressed for time and having
only the very briefest transaction to
perform, it follows that I was kept
waiting for my turn with “our Mr.
Plausible,” in whose optimistic hands
my affairs at the moment repose.
Occupying his far too tolerant ear
was another client, whose need was a
country house surrounded by enough
grass-land for a small stud farm.
This is what happened (he had, by
the way, the only chair at that desk):—
Our Mr. Plausible (for the fortieth
time). I understand perfectly. A nice
house, out-buildings and about twenty
acres of meadow.
Client. Twenty to thirty.
Our Mr. P. Yes, or thirty.
C. You see, what I want is to breed
stock—cattle and horses too.
Our Mr. P. Exactly. Well, the three
places I have given you are all well-
adapted.
C. When a man gets to my age and
has put a little money by he may just
as well take it quietly as not. I don't
want a real farm; I want just a smallish
place where I can play at raising pedi-
gree animals.
Our Mr. P. That's just the kind of
place I've given you. The one near
Newbury is probably the most suitable.
near Alton. -
C. You understand, I don't want a
big farm. Anybody else can have the
arable. Just a comfortable house and
some meadows; about twenty acres or
even thirty.
Our Mr. P. The biggest one I've
given you is thirty. The place near
Newbury is twenty-three.

soon as I can. [Gets up.
Our Mr. P. The sooner the better, I
should advise. There's a great de-
mand for country-houses just now.
C. (sitting solidly down again). Ah,
yes, but this is different. What I want
is not so much a country-house in the
ordinary meaning of the term as a
farm-house, but without possessing a
farm. Just enough buildings and
meadow-land to breed a few short-
horns and a yearling or two. The
house must be comfortable, you know,
roomy, but not anything pretentious.

Our Mr. P. Iquite understand. That's
just what I've given you. .

scheme may be foolishness. My wife
says it is. But (here I believe I groaned

OFFICIAL EUPHEMISM.
DR. ADDIsoN has stated that for
some time past it has been the practice
not to use the word “pauper” in
official documents when it was possible
to use another expression; and no well-
conditioned person will cavil at the
spirit which has prompted the use of a
less invidious substitute. But surely
the process might be carried a good
deal further. The practice of giving a
dog a bad name is not only condemned
by the proverbial philosophy of the
ancients but by the most emancipated
of the orthopsychical educationists of
to-day.
If you keep on calling a man a
“criminal,” you will end by making
him one. How much wiser it would
be to refer to the impulses which
occasionally bring him into conflict
with the custodians of law and order as
emanating from a dynamic individual-
ism | In that way you may very
possibly convert him into a static
individualist and sterilize his potential
malignance by a subliminal serum.

paraging nomenclature is incalculable.
Take the word “thief,” for example.
Its meaning can be expressed with
infinitely greater precision and delicacy
in the phrase, “one who is unable to
discriminate between meum and tuum."
Here you have in place of one mean
little word a well-cadenced phrase of
ten. Euphony as well as humanity
prompts the variation.
Classical writers may have objected
to the use of sesquipedalian words, but
we know better, and Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL's famous synonym for “lie”
is permanently enshrined in the annals
of circumlocution. One of the most
offensive words in the language is
“idiot"; yet it can be shorn of nearly
all its sting when replaced by the
definition, “a person of infra-normal
mentality.”

A HARDY ANNUAL.
THE butler, John Binns, who is an old and faithful
retainer to this household, is now suffering from his annual
cough. It is a terrific cough, capable of disputing supremacy
with all other coughs of which the world has heard. The
special points about this cough are (1) its loudness; (2) its
combination of the noises made by all other coughs; (3) its
depth; (4) its shriek of despair as it trembles and rever-
berates through the house; (5) its capacity to repel and
annihilate sympathy. It is true that I have interviewed
Binns with regard to his cough—it is an annual interview
and is expected of me. I have urged him as he values our
friendship not to neglect his cough, and he has assured me
in return that the doctor has prepared for him a draught
which possesses the supreme quality of being absolutely
unable to effect the purpose for which it was devised.
“I shall drink is stuff,” says Binns, “but I 'aven't any
'opes of its doing me any good. It doesn't seem to get me
be'ind the cough. If once I could really get belind it I
should soon finish it. But you can't expect to do anything
with a cough unless you're belind it.”
“Have you tried chloraline?” I venture to suggest,
mentioning not by that name, but by another, a much-
advertised specific.
“I've been living on chloraline—that is when I wasn't
eating camphor lozenges. But my symptoms are too strong
for that kind o' stuff. Besides, I find that it's no use to
|
fill yerself up with remedies, because they only weigh down
the cough unnaturally, and then when it does bust out
it's fit to tear yer throat in pieces. But none of them get
be ind it—no, not once.”
It will be observed that Binns has almost a superstition
in regard to “getting belind.” If he got rid of his cough
with everything still in front, he would take no satisfaction
whatever in his malady; but as it is he feels a legitimate
pride in it. He has been a member of this household for
forty years, and punctually on the Kalends of March in
every year his cough turns up. It never reduces his effi-
ciency, but, while it alienates affection, it makes him more
valuable to himself as being one who has symptoms capable
of being related at full length to Mrs. Hankinson, the cook,
or to any of the maids who have not yet experienced it
and must be made aware that they belong to an establish-
ment which has the high merit of accommodating John
Binns's annual cough.
It is something to have a butler who has coughed his
irresistible way through two-and-a-half generations. It is
a perfectly harmless affliction, but it gets on nerves in the
same way as it did when first it huicked and honked and
strangled and choked in the seventies of last century. I
can see no decrease in its vigour or its variety. It deserves
the chance of immortality that I hereby offer it, thus giving
it a place beside the cough that Johnson coughed at Dr.
Blimber's famous establishment. It will be remembered that,
when the Doctor began an excursus on the Romans, Johnson,
“who happened to be drinking and who caught the Doctor's
eye glaring at him through the side of his tumbler, left off
so hastily that he was convulsed for some moments and in
the sequel ruined Dr. Blimber's point.” He struggled gal-
lantly, but had in the end to give way to an overwhelming
paroxysm of coughing. It was a good cough, but an iso-
lated one, and was perhaps, after all, not equal to Binns's.

lised, meet accidentally in the waiting-room of a Govern-

the other side's duty to give way.” One small concession
you must make to Miss HAMILTON's plot. It is improba-
ble that, when such a couple as William and Griselda left
England in July 1914 to take their honeymoon in a remote
valley of the Belgian Ardennes, their friends, knowing them
to be without news and ignorant of all speech save English,
should have made no effort to warn them. But, this
igranted, the tragedy that follows becomes inevitable. It is
so finely told and so horrible (the more so for the deliberate
restraint of the telling) that I will say nothing to weaken
its effect. From one scene, however, I cannot withhold my
tribute of admiration—that in which William, alone, broken-
hearted, and almost crazed with the ruin of everything that
made up his life, creeps home to find his old associates still
glibly echoing the platitudes in which he once believed. A
hint here of insincerity or conscious arrangement would have
ruined all; as it is, the scene holds and haunts one with an
impression of absolute truth. For the end, marked like all
the rest by an almost grim avoidance of sentimentality, I
|
shall only refer you to the book itself. After reading it
you will, I hope, not think me guilty of exaggeration when
I call it, slight though it is, one for which its author has
deserved well of the State.
The dominant impression left upon me by Miss MERIEL
BUcHANAN's Petrograd the City of Trouble (CoLLINs) is
that its author is a sportswoman of the first order. You
see her pressing to the windows to observe the shooting
in the streets, going out to shop, to dine, to dance, during
the stormy months of the various phases of the various
Russian Revolutions. And I hasten to add, for fear of
misunderstanding, that there is no suggestion of pose as
the heroic Englishwoman. It was not till the end of 1918
that Sir GEORGE BUCHANAN withdrew from a country in
which ambassadorial functions had obviously no reasonable
scope. But he and his family, including our chronicler,
his spirited daughter, remained long after there was any
plausible reason to hope for the restoration of order and
very long after considerations of personal safety might
well have dictated and justified retreat. Mr. HUGH WAL-
Pole in his preface points out that Miss BUCHANAN is the
first English writer to give a sense of the atmosphere of
Russia during the New Terror. It is curious, but the im-
pression she conveys is of something far less formidable
than we have imagined. That may well be due to her
high courage which minimised the ever-present dangers.
Another odd impression is that her accounts of current
events, e.g. of the death of RASPUTIN, seem to be as unplaus-
ible as those which have been patched from various reports
and guesses by writers far from the actual scene. It is
perhaps the very nearness of the author to the source of
the host of wild rumours and speculations concerning this
strange tragedy that conveys this sense of the impossible.
Have I thereby suggested that the book lacks interest? On
the contrary, it hasn't a dull or insincere page.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Little Houses (METHUEN) is not, as you might excusably
suppose, a treatise upon the problem of the hour, but a
novel. I confess that, when I read in the puff preliminary
that it was “minutely observed” and “drab" in setting, my
heart sank. But Mr. Woden's book is not made after that
sufficiently-exploited fashion. He has a definite scheme, and
(but for the fault of creating more characters than he can
conveniently manage) tells his simple tale with a mature ease
remarkable in a first novel. The plan of it is the life-story
of a group of persons in a provincial factory town in those
Victorian days when trade-unions were first starting, when
the caricaturists lived upon Mr. GLADSTONE's collars and the
Irish Question was very much in the same state as it is
to-day. We watch the hero, John Allday, developing from
a Sunday-school urchin to flourishing owner of his own
admirers on this side of the Atlantic will read The
Magnificent Ambersons (Hoddeb AND SToughton) with any
great sense of satisfaction. George Minafer is a spoilt and
egotistical cad, and as we pursue his unpleasant personality
from infancy onward our impatience with the adoring
relatives who allow the impossible little bounder to turn
their lives to tragedy becomes more and more pronounced.
In England his “come uppance” would have commenced
at an early age and in the time-honoured place thereunto
provided. But in the case of young American nabobs these
corrective agencies are too often wanting, and though it is
hard to believe that a sophisticated uncle, a soldier grand-
father and various other relatives would have allowed a
conceited and overbearing young boor to wreck his
mother's life by separating her from a former sweetheart, it
business and prospective alder-
man. Of course I admit that
this synopsis does not sound
peculiarly thrilling; also that as
a tale it is by now considerably
more than twice told. But I can
only repeat that, for those with a
taste for such stories, here is one
excellent of its kind. Whether
Mr. Woden has been drawing
upon personal memories for it,
writing in fact that one novel of
which every man is said to be
capable, time and the publishing
lists will show. I shall certainly
be interested to see. Meanwhile
the fact that despite his name
GEORGE—always an object of
the gravest suspicion—I accept
his masculinity without ques-
tion is my tribute both to the
balance of his style and to
the admirable drawing of his
hero.

That gallant and heroic gentle-
man, the late Mr. CECIL CHES-
TERTON, proved his quality by
his service and death in the ranks
of our army. In such scanty
leisure as he could command he
wrote, quite casually as it were,

cannot be said that such cases
have not existed or that the
picture is altogether overdrawn.
But we do not like George
Minafer, and his final recon-
ciliation with his own sweet-
heart and her father—the man
whom he has prevented his
mother from marrying—leaves
us cold. But if the characters
are unpleasing the craftsman-
ship of The Magnificent Amber-
sons is of Mr. Booth TARKING-
ToN's best, and his description
of the decline and fall of a locally
supreme dynasty of plutocrats
before the hosts of the Goths
and Huns of spawning indus-
trialism is almost a contribution
to American social history.
Of the two tales in Wild Youth
and Another (Hutchinson) I pre-
fer the other. In “Wild Youth"
Sir GILBERT PARKER gives us the
unedifying picture of a horrible
old man married to a young and
pretty girl. Jealous, tyrannical
and vicious, this creature—re-
ferred to as a behemoth—is in all
conscience unsavoury enough;
but no one can read his story
without feeling that he never
had a dog's chance; and although
the tale is in many respects well-
have said, “Hullo! Here's a nation! Let's write its history,”
which he at once proceeded to do with immense gusto
and considerable accuracy. Americans will not universally
agree with all the views he puts forward. I myself am of
opinion (probably quite wrongly) that I could make a better
argumentative case for the North in the Civil War
on the question of slavery. And in his account of the
War of 1812-1814 Mr. CHESTERTON spends a great deal of
indignation over the burning by the British of some public
buildings in Washington, omitting to mention that this was
done in reprisal for the burning by the Americans in the
previous year of the public buildings of Toronto. But in
the main this history brilliantly justifies Mr. CHESTERTON's
courage in undertaking it, and it is written in a style that
carries the reader with it from first to last. The book is
introduced by a moving tribute from Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON
to his dead brother.
We doubt whether Mr. Booth TARKINGTON's many
told, I feel that it would have been vastly improved if some
redeeming qualities had been vouchsafed to the villain of the
piece. “Jordan is a Hard Road” is a more engaging piece of
work. Here we have a man who has walked through most of
the commandments—with especial attention to the eighth—
trying to mend his ways. And he makes rather a sound
job of it until something quite unforeseen happens; and
then the old Adam (if this is quite fair to Adam) asserts
himself. From a publisher’s “literary note” enclosed in
this book you will learn that Sir GILBERT's imagination is
“as boundless as the tracts of the Prairie which he loves
and knows how to make his readers love.” This is perhaps
rather a large order, but I will content myself by saying
that for the scenes of these stories Sir GILBERT has chosen
ground that is familiar to him, and that knowledge is
sometimes even more useful than imagination.

MONUMENTS OF THE WAR.
LET those who fear lest Memory should mislay
Our triumphs gathered all across the map;
Lest other topics—like the weather, say,
Or jazzing—should supplant the recent scrap ;
Or lest a future race whose careless lot
Lies in a League of Nations, lapped amid
Millennial balm, be unaware of what
(Largely for their sakes) we endured and did;—
Let such invite our architects to plan
Great monumental works in steel and stone,
Certain to catch the eye of any man
And make our victories generally known;
Let a new bridge at Charing Cross be built,
In Regent Street a deathless quadrant set,
And on them be inscribed in dazzling gilt —

Baring her ravaged beauty to record

ALBERT Memorial (close to Prince's Gate).
For me, the tablets of my heart, I ween,
Sufficiently recall these fateful years;
I need no monument for keeping green
All that I suffered in the Volunteers;
Therefore I urge the Army Council, at
Its earliest leisure, please—next week would do—
To raze the hutments opposite my flat,
That still impinge on my riparian view. O. S.
A PAIR of MILITARY GLovEs.
IT was in Italy, on my way home from Egypt to be
demobilised, that I decided to buy a pair of warm gloves
from Ordnance.
After being directed by helpful other ranks to the A.S.C.
Depôt, the Camp Commandant's Office and the Y.M.C.A.,
I found myself, at the end of a morning's strenuous
walking, confronted by notices on a closed door stating
that this was the Officers' Payment Issue Department; that
this was the Officers' Entrance to the Officers' Payment
Issue Department; that smoking was strictly prohibited;
and that the office would re-open at 14.00.
I went away to lunch. -
At 14.01 I knocked out my pipe conscientiously and
entered. From 14.01 to 14.50 I watched a Captain of the
R.A.F. smoking cigarettes and choosing a pair of socks,
and studied notices to the effect that this was the Officers'
Payment Issue Department; that only Officers were per-
mitted to enter the Officers' Payment Issue Department;
that smoking was strictly prohibited; and that the office
would close at 16.00. -
At last I heard the R.A.F. man explain that, by James,
he had an appointment at three, and would return, old
bean—er, Corporal—in the morning to see about those
dashed socks. The Corporal behind the counter blew away
a pile cf cigarette ash and regarded me distrustfully.
“Only one pair of gloves left, Sir,” he said. “Gloves,
woollen, knitted, pairs one, one-and-tempence.”
“Thank you very much,” I said. “They'll do nicely.
I'll take them now.”
I3ut of course I didn't. At 15,00I was in another building,
watching another Corporal make out an indent in quadru-
plicate for gloves, woollen, knitted, officers, for the use of,
pairs one. At 15.05 I was in another building, getting the
indent stamped and countersigned. At 15.12 I was in
another building, exchanging it for a buff form in duplicate.
At 15.20 I re-entered the Issue Department and went
through the motions of taking up the gloves.
“Excuse me, Sir,” said the Corporal, skilfully sliding
them away; “you must first produce your Field Advance
Book as a proof of identity.” ... "
“I'm afraid I haven't a proper Field Advance Book,” I
explained. “You see, in Egypt, where I come from—that
is, I was attached, you know, to the well, in short, I
haven't a proper Field Advance Book, as I said before.
But I have here an A.B. 64 issued in lieu thereof—they do
that in Egypt, you know—and I have my identity discs,
my demobilisation papers, my cheque-book — oh, and
heaps of other things which would prove to you that I am
really me. Besides, my name is sewn inside the back of
my tunic. And my shirt,” I added hopefully.
“If you haven't a Field Advance Book, Sir,” said the
Corporal coldly, “your only course is to obtain a certificate
of identity from the Camp Commandant.”
“But, look here, Corporal,” I protested, “it would take
me a quarter-of-an-hour to get to the Commandant's office
and another quarter to get back. I'm sure I couldn't get
a certificate of identity under an hour and a-half. It is
now twenty-five past three. You close at four. To-morrow
morning at five ac emma I entrain for Cherbourg. . . .
You see how impossible it all is, Corporal.”
“Sorry, Sir,” said the Corporal. “I’m not allowed to
issue the gloves without your Field Advance Book or a
certificate of identity.”
“But what am I to do?” I asked weakly. “Think,
Corporal, how cold it will be across Italy and France with-
out gloves. I've been in the East for over four years, and
I might get pneumonia and die, you know.”
“I should try the Camp Commandant, Sir,” he said.
“It may not take so long as you think.”
> - --- > :: : ::: ::
At 15.41 I was outside the Camp Commandant's office
with my A.B.64, identity discs, demobilisation papers and
cheque-book ready to hand, and my tunic loosened at the
neck.
At 15.42 I entered the office with some diffidence.
At 15.43 I was outside again, dazed and a little frightened,
with a certificate of identity in my hand. It was the fastest
piece of work I have ever known in the Army. And I might
have been Mr. GEORGE Robey in disguise for all they knew
in the office—or cared. -

We are obliged to repeat this con-
tinually to ourselves in order to present
the stern and forbidding air which is
supposed to mark our dealings with
the inhabitants. For, look you, we
have usurped the place of the Royal
Jocks on the “right flank of the Brit-
ish Army,” and are on outpost duty,
with our right resting on the bank of
the Rhine, while in front the notice-
boards, “Limit of Cologne Bridgehead,”

going, pay-through-the-nose people that
we were. No longer does our daily rou.
time include the smile for Mademoiselle,

ourselves steadily to the grim task en-
trusted to us, and struggle to offer a
perfect picture of stolid indifference to
anybody's welfare but our own. “Fee-
fi-fo-fum.”
What does Thomas think of it all 2
Well, to tell the truth, I haven't caught
him thinking very much about it.
Gloating seems foreign to his nature
somehow, and I don't think he will
ever make a really good Hun. He is
rather like a child who for four years
has been crying incessantly for the
moon. Having got it, he says, “Well,
I'm glad I've got it; now let's get on
with something else,” and takes not
the slightest interest in the silly old
moon he has acquired with so much
trouble.
There are two things to which he
cannot quite accustom himself: not
being allowed to fraternize with the
inhabitants and the realisation that his
laboriously acquired knowledge of the
French language is no longer of any
avail. He will never quite get over
the former of these two disabilities, but
he is coping courageously with the
latter. For instance, in place of the
“No bon" of yesterday, "Nix goot ”
now explains that “Your saucepan I
borrowed has a hole in it; please, I
didn't do it.” For the rest, change of
environment makes very little differ-
ence to him. Given a cooker, a water-
cart and the necessary rations, a British
oasis will appear and be prepared to
flourish in any old desert you like.
No, I am wrong. There is another
difficulty which as yet he has not been
able entirely to overcoyne. I cannot
describe the consternation which came
over the Company when I informed
them that there was no longer any
need to scrounge; in fact, I forbade it.
At first they thought it was just a
Company Commander's humour and
paid it the usual compliments of the
parade; but when they found I was
serious they were simply appalled. It
was as if I had taken the very spice
out of their existence. Not to be able
to go out and “win” a handful of fuel
for the evening's fug and for the brew-
ing of those unwholesome messes in the
tin canteen 2 Bolshevism itself could
not have propounded a more revolu-
tionary principle. Heartbroken some
of the old soldiers came to me after-
wards. “What are we to do, Sir 2"
they said. “We only go on guard four
hours in sixteen ; we must do some-
thing the rest of the time.” Sternly
I bade them think of scrounging as a
thing of the past—a thing of glorious
memory only to be spoken of round
the fires at home. If they wanted any-
thing in the meantime to add to their
material comfort they were to come to
me for it.

HERE ALL. NIGHT.”
For let me tell you, all you demo-
bilised wallahs who know only those
countries where the necessities of life
were matters of private enterprise—let
me tell you that in this village, if I say
that I require coal, coal is here, and
with it the Bürgermeister inquiring
politely if my needs are satisfied. We
must have beds? The spare beds of
the village are forthcoming. If we
want baths for the men, our Mr. Carfax,
who speaks a language which the in-
habitants pretend to understand, goes
round to the householders and explains
the necessity. Should there be any
difficulty he explains further that it
would be much better, don't they think,
and much more convenient if the men
visited the houses, rather than that
baths should be carried to some central
place 2. It is invariably found to be
preferable for all concerned.
Bathing has now become a pleasure
to all, except, perhaps, to Nijinsky, our
Pole from Commercial Road, East. On
being presented (for the first time, I
gather) to a first-class bathroom with
geyser complete, he evinced signs of
great uneasiness. In fact he seemed
to think that this was making a parade
of a purely private matter. The Ser-
geant-Major, being called in, exhorted
him to “get in and give the thing a
trial,” at which Nijinsky flung up his
hands in characteristic fashion and
said, “Well, it's somethink fur nothink,
anyhow,” and they left him to it. The
rest of the story is concerned with his
turning off the water in the geyser and
leaving the gas on, of a loud explosion
and the figure of Nijinsky, fat and
frightened, fleeing through the main
street dressed in an Army towel. Sub-
sequently I heard him expressing
forcibly a fixed determination never,
never to be persuaded against his will

anything really; they wouldn't deceive

tation of Tommy's salute, and, though
Subalterns and Sergeant-Majors may

city, still the youngsters grin fearlessly
as they raise their tiny fingers. They
know it isn't real.

And I caught our Mr. Carfax picking
one of them up from the gutter the other
day and soothing its tears with the
baby-talk of all nations. I told him he
was fraternising abominably and was
not being a true Hun.

Her Ladyship. “REALLY, I Don'T THINK THAT NEED MATTER."

THE GREAT GOLD-GURE DEBATE.
IN view of the prevalence of colds
and the varying counsels given to their
patients by our leading so-called healers,
a mass meeting of doctors and public
men was recently convened, with the
hope that some useful results might
follow.
None did.
The Chairman in his opening re-
marks said that colds were at once the
commonest complaints to which human
beings were subject and the least under-
stood by the faculty. It was scan-
dalous that so little serious attention
should be paid to them by physicians.
A scientific investigator should be as
proud of discovering a preventive for
colds as a scheme of wireless tele-
graphy. But it was not so. Re-
searchers were applauded for com-
pounding new and more deadly ex-
plosives and poisonous gas, while the
whole mystery of colds remained un-
plumbed. The situation was scan-
dalous. (Loud sneezes.)
Letters were read, among others,
from Lord NorthcLIFFE, Mr. S.Now DEN
and Sir John SIMON, all saying that
from recent experience they could affirm
that an equable cold temperature was
conducive to the avoidance of catarrh.
In short, an excellent means of escap-
ing cold was to be out in the cold.
A representative of the Board of
Trade said that all that was necessary
to avoid colds was to keep fit and not
approach infection. Having offered
this very practical advice the speaker
gathered up his papers and left the
room.
Sir Septicus Jermyn, the famous phy-
sician, urged that the best preventive
for colds was to keep warm. One should
wear plenty of thick clothing and espe-
cially cover the neck and throat. A
respirator was an excellent thing. He
even went so far as to recommend ear-
flaps to his patients, with beneficial
results. A night-cap was also a great
help.
Sir Rufus Hardy, the famous phy-
sician, protested that colds were for the
most part negligible. People took them
much too seriously. The best treat-
ment was to be Spartan — wear the
lightest clothes, abjure mufflers, and,
whenever you could find a draught,
sit in it.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw said that all this
cold-catching was nonsense. He per-
sonally had never had a cold in his life.
And why? Because he lived healthily;
he wore natural wool, retained his
beard, ate no meat and drank no
wine. Lunatics who wore fancy tweeds,
shaved, devoured their fellow-creatures
and imbibed poisonous acids were bound
to catch cold. Resuming his Jaeger
halo, Mr. SHAw then left.
Sir Bluffon Gay, the famous physi-
cian, stated that in his experience colds
were necessary evils which often served
useful ends in clearing the system. For
that reason he was against any treat-
ment that served to stop them. The
“instantaneous cold cures” which were
advertised so freely filled him with sus-
picion. Colds should be unfettered.
Mr. Le Hay Fevre, K.C., represent-
ing the Ancient Order of Haberdashers,
said that he was in entire agreement
with the last speaker. Colds should be
allowed to take their course. Nothing
was so bad as to check them.
Sir Romeo Path, the famous physi-
cian, asserted that colds were far more
serious things than people thought.
As a matter of fact there was no such
thing as a cold pure and simple; colds
were invariably manifestations of other
and deeper trouble. His own specific
was a long period of complete rest and
careful but not meagre dieting, followed
by change of air, if necessary travel to
the South of France. (Loud coughs
and cheers.)

Corporal. “OH, NOTHING To SPEAK OF, SIR-NOT NEAR As MUCH AS THEY USED TO."
Chemists and Druggists' Union, said
that it was felt very strongly that the
seriousness of colds should not be
minimised, but that foreign travel was
an error. No malady was so much
helped by the timely and constant em-
ployment of remedies at home. He
trusted that the remarks of the last
speaker would speedily be contradicted
by a competent authority.
Sir Consul Tait, the famous physi-
cian, held that alcohol was the greatest
provocative of colds; aspirin was their
greatest enemy.
Sir Tablloyd George, the famous
..] physician, observed that a glass of hot
whisky and lemon-juice on going to bed
was a sovran remedy. Aspirin was to
be avoided, but quinine had its uses.
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT said that pro-
bably no one knew more about the way
that other people should behave than
he did. He had written twelve man-
uals on the subject and intended to
write twenty-six more, by which time
he would have covered the whole field
of human endeavour. Any one who
had read his book, The Plain Man and
his Wife and their Plainer Children,
would remember that one chapter was
devoted to the cause, evasion and cure
of colds. He would not at the moment
say more than that the work was pro-
curable at all bookshops. He should
like to address the meeting at fuller
length, but as he was suffering from a
very stubborn cold he must hurry back
to bed.
Mr. H. G. WELLs remarked that he
always found that the best corrective
for a cold was to write another novel
of modern domestic life. He had even
heard of the perusal of some of his
novels as a substitute for coal.
Mr. BonAR LAw said that there was
no prophylactic against colds so effica-
cious as fresh air and plenty of it.
Since he had formed the habit of flying
backwards and forwards from Paris he
had been free from any trouble of that
kind. He recommended a seat at the
Peace Conference and constant aviation
to all sufferers.
Sir Blandon Swaive, the famous phy-
sician, contended that there was no
sense in the fresh-air theory. Rooms
should be hermetically sealed.
Mr. SMILLIE said that he had given
the matter the closest attention, and
he had come to the conclusion that
there was no preventive of a cold in the
head so complete and drastic as de-
capitation.
The meeting was considering Mr.
SMILLIE's suggestion when our re-
porter, who had contracted a chill
during Mr. BERNARD SHAw's remarks,
took his departure.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATCH DOGS.
LXXX,
MY DEAR CHARLEs, You are a law-
yer and you ought to know. Yet to
myself, when I compare my profits with
those of the Government in this deal,
I seem a model of innocence.
Let me refresh your memory of the
facts.
In the Spring of 1918 I was dis-
pensing passports to deserving cases
in the name of His Majesty's Govern-
ment. In the neutral country where
I was doing this there was a very wicked
and a very plausible man, whom we
will call Mr. Abrahams (he has had so
many surnames at one time and another
that a new one cannot do him an
harm). Rate of exchange stood at the
figure of twenty local francs to the
pound sterling, and, as you would put
it, other things were equal.
Mr. Abrahams was obsessed with
a desire to see England, entirely for
its own sake. England, also thinking
entirely of itself, was obsessed with
a desire not to see Mr. Abrahams.
Mr. Abrahams came to my office, said
nice things about me to my face and
begged me to let him go. - I said nice
things to him, and told him I would if
I could, but I couldn't. He took this to
mean I could if I would, but I wouldn't.
He offered me cash down; a cheque
for five pounds sterling, or a note for
a hundred francs; I could have it which
way I liked. We should call it for ap-
pearance' sake a gift to His Majesty's
Government for the better prosecution
of the War.
I thanked him cordially on behalf
of His Majesty's Government, but re-
gretted that I was the victim of circum-
stances over which I had no control.
Refusing to believe there could be any
circumstances which could stand up
against an officer of my power, posi-
tion and force, he produced a note for
a hundred francs and put it on my
table. He then withdrew, meaning
(I gathered) to return to the attack as
soon as the money had sunk in. From
this point on, Mr. Abrahams disappears
from the story. It is not the first or
only story, as the police will tell you,
from which Mr. Abrahams has dis-
appeared.
My report to His Majesty's Govern-
ment did not omit a full mention of the
matter of the five pounds or hundred
francs offered. It begged for instruc-
tions as to the disposal of the booty
which, it stated, lay in my “Suspense”
basket. No instructions could be got,
though frequent messages, saying, “May
we now have an answer, please ?" were
sent. Weeks passed, and every morn-
ing I was tempted by the sight of that
note for a hundred francs lying in the
basket. My moral gradually declined.
So did the rate of exchange. So did
the barometer. --
There came a day, the weather being
such that any man who could sin would
sin, when I had in my pocket a cheque
made out for five pounds which I was
about to cash for lack of ready francs,
and when the rate of exchange had got
as low as nineteen francs to the pound,
which would mean (I rely entirely on
the evidence of the bank man) ninety-
five francs for my five pounds. Charles,
I fell. Explaining to myself that
Mr. Abrahams had clearly intimated
that his gift to the Government was
alternatively a cheque for five pounds
or a note for a hundred francs, I put
my cheque into the “Suspense” bas-
ket and pocketed the note, thus making
five francs profit. . -
More weeks passed; no instructions
came, and every day I was tempted by
the sight of that cheque. One bright
summer morning, when any man who
had any goodness in him could not help
being good, and when the rate of ex-
change had risen to twenty-one, I came
to my office full of noble intentions
and hundred franc notes of my own.
I may mention in passing that it takes
very little money to fill me up. I had
just cashed a cheque of my own at the
rate of a hundred-and-five francs to the
five pounds, and I felt robust and self-
confident and ready to do it again.
There, on the top of my “Suspense”
basket, lay just the very cheque for the
purpose. Charles, I fell again. Dx-
plaining to myself that Mr. Abrahams
had clearly intimated that his gift to
the Government was alternatively a
note for a hundred francs or a cheque
for five pounds, I put a note for a hun-
dred francs into the “Suspense” basket,
and pocketed the cheque, thus making
another five francs profit.
That, my Lord, is the case for the
prosecution; but you may as well have
the rest of the story. Instructions or
no instructions, I thought it was now
time to send the note for a hundred
francs to the Government. The Gov-
ernment said it had no use for francs
in England, sent back the note to me
and told me to buy, locally, an English
cheque, which I was to hold, pending
further instructions. It took some time
to arrive at this point, and meanwhile
rate of exchange had had a serious
relapse. The hundred franc note bought
a cheque for five guineas. Not feeling
strong enough to pend further instruc-
tions, I at once sent this home. More
haste, less speed: I forgot to endorse
it. After another period the cheque
came back, with a memo. The memo
said: (1) His Majesty's Government
had no love or use for unendorsed
cheques drawn in favour of other peo-
ple. (2) His Majesty's Government
requested me to endorse the cheque,
cash it locally and put the proceeds to ||
the credit side of my expenses account.
(3) His Majesty's Government trusted
that Mr. Abrahams would not cause
this sort of trouble again.
Whether it was the stimulus given
by this memo, or whether it was merely
a case of giving up the drink and be-
coming a reformed character, rate of
exchange had, I found when I went to
carry out orders, risen to and stuck at
the dizzy height of twenty-three francs
and twenty centimes to the pound.
His Majesty's Government has drawn
in the long run (the very long run) the
sum of one hundred and twenty-one
francs and eighty centimes, thus mak-
ing more than twice as heavy a profit
as I had. And yet you have the im-
pudence to tell me that I am guilty of
embezzlement, with corruption.
I can only say I should be ashamed
to be a lawyer.
I can only add that I should be
happy to be His Majesty's Government.
With all best wishes and enclosing
stamps for eighty centimes as repre-
senting your share of the proceeds
(including fee for opinion),
I remain, -
Yours sincerely, HENRY.

OCCUPIED OPERA.
IT was a chilly morning early in
January. The Opera at Cologne had
just become recognised as the principal
attraction of the place, and as yet there
was no suave interpreter in attendance
to mediate between the queue of repre-
sentatives of Britain's military power
and the German clerk in the box-office.
I suppose that in some handsome
suite of apartments in one of the best
hotels in Cologne an exalted personage
with red trimmings spends his whole
time—office hours, of course—in devis-
ing fresh schemes for the sale and dis-
| tribution of opera tickets to the British
troops. The demand for them is always
far in excess of the number reserved
for the military, and fresh schemes for
their distribution are inaugurated every
week.
We were still in the days when
officers and men of every rank and
every branch of the Army of Occupa-
tion used to wait in a democratic queue
for the box-office to open at 10 A.M. It
was 9.15 when I took up my position,
beaten a short neck by a very young
and haughty officer, a Second-Lieuten-
ant of the Blankshires. There is always
a cold wind round that corner of the
|Rudolfplatz, but every officer and every
O.R. turned up his coat-collar, stamped
his feet and determined to stick it.
After all, from the time when he waits
his turn to receive his first suit of
khaki, every soldier is inured to stand-
ing in queues, and when he has so often
stood half-an-hour in a queue for the
chance of a penny bowl of Y.M.C.A.
tea he will think nothing of standing
for an hour for a seat at the Opera.
For the officers no doubt the situation
had the attraction of novelty.
By the time the office opened the
queue reached from the Opera House
steps nearly to the tramway Haltestelle,
and much speculation was going on as
to how many would be sent empty
away. Inch by inch we moved forward,
mounted the steps one by one, and came
within the relative warmth of the vesti-
bule. At last the weary waiting-time
was over; the young subaltern stepped
before the guichet and, pointing to a
handbill, demanded in a loud and digni-
fied voice a ticket for next Monday's per-
formance of “KEINE WorsTELLUNG !”
How shall I describe the painful
scene that followed—a scene in which,
as a mere Tommy, I had too much
discipline to intervene? In vain the
obsequious purveyor of tickets offered
a selection of the world's most popular
and celebrated operas for any other day
but Monday. Nothing would do for my
officer but Keine Vorstellung. Indeed,
as he explained in his best and loudest
English, Monday was his only free
evening. Keine Vorstellung he wanted
and Keine Vorstellung he must have.
Followed reiteration, expostulation, vi-
tuperation in yet louder English than
before, and when at last he turned away
without his ticket he was still convinced
that the authority of the Britische
Besatzung had been outraged and de-
fied by the man behind the window.
I often wonder what he said when
the precise meaning of those two mystic
words was revealed to him. I like to
think that it may have happened at the
Requisition Office, whither he had gone
to procure an order to compel that re-
calcitrant square-head to supply him
with the ticket so unwarrantably with-
held.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 3rd.—The terrors of
the Statute of Anne having been tempo-
rarily removed, Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBER-
J LAIN headed a little queue of Ministers
coming up to take the Oath. How the
already crowded Treasury Bench is to
accommodate the new-comers it is
difficult to see, but presumably a sys-
|tem of reliefs will be arranged.
The present epidemic was discussed
by Captain NEwMAN and Sir John RWEs
who were not agreed as to whether
port is a “preventative” or a “pre-
ventive" of influenza, but were unani-
mous in thinking that far too little of
it was available. -
On hearing that the liability of agri-
cultural shows to the Entertainment
Tax depended on whether instruction
was combined with amusement, Colonel
WEIGALL pertinently asked who was to
decide where amusement ends and edu-
cation begins. Talking of education,
I shall in future, following Mr. H. A.
L. FISHER, try to pronounce Thibetan
with a long “e,” but, I hesitate, even
on the authority of the MINISTER of
EDUCATION, to speak of “Febuary.”
Since Mr. CHURCHILL became War
Minister he has developed a remarkable
likeness to Lord HALDANE. Happily
the resemblance extends only to the
romaeurs, and not to the occasional
longueurs, of his predecessor. How
long his Lordship would have taken
to elucidate the present position and
future composition of the British
Army I cannot estimate, but it
would have been several hours.
Mr. CHURCHILL's survey of the
World, from Siberia to the Rhine,
occupied a brief sixty minutes and
included some attractive specula-
tions on the kind of Army we
should need in the future. He
hopes, among other things, for ºf
an improved General Staff, com-
posed of officers acquainted with
war in all its phases—land, sea
and air — who could give the
Cabinet expert advice on war as a ſº
whole, and save it (we inferred)
from such hesitations as led to
the glorious tragedy of Gallipoli.
“I thought we had given up
war,” interjected Mr. Hogg|E; and
other Members twitted the Min-
ister with having left out of his
account the League of Nations.
But Mr. CHURCHILL, in reply,
while expressing the utmost re-
spect for the League, pointed out
that it was not yet in being,
and that meanwhile Britain must \º
continue to be a strong armed
Power.
A number of maiden speeches
were delivered during the evening. The
SPEAKER was not in the Chair, but I
hope he was somewhere in the pre-
cincts to hear the cheers which greeted
the initial effort—commendably brief
MR. McCALLUM SCOTT.
*SH-H ! I)ON'T YOU KNow THERE's A
DEMOBILISATION ON ?"
and to the point—of his son, Major
LowTHER, on the subject of courts-
martial.
Tuesday, March 4th.-Lord SINHA
oF RAIPUR delivered his maiden speech
in a style which promises well for his
A NEW FORCE IN POLITICS,
THE DE WALERA GIRL.
Parliamentary career. Accepting the
dictum of Lord SYDENHAM that frank-
ness is essential in Indian affairs, he
proceeded to act upon it by administer-
ing a dignified rebuke to his lordship
for having suggested that one of the
periodical affrays between Mahomedans
and Hindoos was occasioned by the
MoNTAGU-CHELMsFord report.
No fewer than forty-six questions
were addressed to the War Office.
But obviously this sort of thing can-
not go on. The SECRETARY of STATE
cannot devote so much of his valuable
time to satisfying Parliamentary curi-
osity. Accordingly he has appointed a
“Members' friend” to hear complaints
and answer questions. Mr. McCALLUM
Scott has been rewarded for his con-
sistent admiration—did he not publish
a eulogy of “Winston Churchill in
Peace and War" when his hero's
fortunes were temporarily clouded ?—
and on two days a week will have the
privilege of acting as lightning-con-
ductor.
The most intriguing detail in the
story of DE WALERA's escape from
Lincoln Gaol was the beguilement of
the guards by two sweet girl-graduates
from Dublin. But this afternoon Mr.
SHoRTT curtly stated—with a twinkle
in his eye—that the sentries disclaimed
all knowledge of the ladies. Still, is
this conclusive 2
Wednesday, March 5th.-The friends
of the new LoIRD CHANCELLOR were be-
coming anxious lest his natural gaiety
should be permanently suppressed
by the necessity of keeping up
the dignity of the Woolsack.
They need be under no further
apprehensions. A motion in
favour of Home Rule All Round,
introduced by Lord BRASSEY and
supported by Lord SELBoRNE,
furnished him with his chance.
Metaphorically flinging his full-
bottomed wig on to the floor he
skipped into the arena, executed
a war-dance around his amazed
victims, and, before they knew
where they were, got their heads
into Chancery and knocked them
together until they were com-
S. pelled to give in. Talk of the
congestion of Parliament! Why,
now that party spirit was in abey-
ance, Bills went through with
incredible rapidity. As for the
supposed ambitions of the “little
nations,” what, he asked, did
Scotsmen and Welshmen care
about subordinate Parliaments
when they were governing the
whole Empire? If the advocates
of the proposal really believed
in it let them go out as mis-
sionaries into the wilderness, and,

if they escaped the proverbial fate of mis-
sionaries, convert the heathen voters to

his brow bloody but unbowed, inti-
mated that “a time would come,” and
meanwhile withdrew his motion.
At Question-time Mr. BonAR LAw in-
dignantly denied a newspaper rumour
from Paris that the British delegates
had decided not to demand any money-
indemnity from Germany, but took
occasion later on to discount somewhat
freely the election-promises made on
this subject by himself and other Min-
ADAMson, the Labour leader, immedi-
ately pressed for an increase in the
salaries of Members of Parliament.
Thursday, March 6th.-The CHIEF
SECRETARY For IRELAND announced that
the Government had decided to release
such of the Sinn Fein prisoners as had
not already saved them the trouble.

A little rift within the Coalition lute

and passed the Second Reading by an

THE SENTINELS.

All through the night
There are Fairy Sentinels

Up and down the nurs'ry stair
All through the day
There the Fairy Sentinels

If you were to wake them up,

So Tip-toel Tip-toel
Go upstairs quietly.
Yes, that's the very reason we have
carpets on the stair–
The Sentinels are sleeping, and we must
take care. -

THE SPACE PROBLEM.
The sad queues shiver in the drains
And do not get upon the bus;
Men battle round successive trains,
And each is yet more populous;
Twelve times a week I pay the fare,
But know not when I last sat down;
It almost looks as if there were
Too many people in the town.
I know not where they all may dwell;
I know my lease is up in May;
I know I said, “Oh, very well,
I'll take a house down Dorking
way;”
I scoured the spacious countryside, |
I found no residence to spare,
And it is not to be denied
There are too many people there.
They say the birth-rate's sadly low;
They say the death-rate tends to soar;
So how we manage I don't know
To go on growing more and more;
Let statistology prefer
To think the race is nice and small,
But how do all these crowds occur,
And who the dickens are they all?
Where do they come from ? Where on
earth
In olden days did they reside,
When there was really lots of birth
And hardly anybody died?
Where had this multitude its lair 2
Some pleasant spot, I make no doubt;
I only wish they'd go back there
And leave me room to move about ;
And leave some little house for me
In any shire, in any town,
Or, otherwise, myself must flee
And build a dug-out in a down;
If none may settle on the land,
Yet might one settle underground
(Provided people understand
They must not come and dig all
round).
There will I dwell (alone) till death
And soothe my crowd-corroded soul;
And, when I breathe my latest breath,
Let no man move me from my hole;
Let but a little earth be cast,
And someone write above the tomb:
“Here had the poet peace at last;
Here only had he elbow-room.”
– A. P. H.
THE SWEET-SHOP.
IT was a mean street somewhere in
the wilderness of Fulham. How I got
there I don't exactly know; all that I
am clear about is that I was trying, on
insufficient data, to make a short cut.
Twilight was falling, there was a slight
drizzle of rain and I told myself that I
had stumbled on the drabbest bit of all
London.
Here and there, breaking the mono-
tony of dark house-fronts, were little
isolated shops, which gave a touch of
colour to the drabness. I paused before
one of them, through whose small and
dim window a light shed a melancholy
beam upon the pavement. Nothing
seemed to be sold there, for the window
was occupied by empty glass jars, bear-
ing such labels as “peppermint rock,”
“pear drops" and “bull's-eyes.” Ap-
parently the shop had sold out.
I was on the point of turning away
when I noticed that someone was
moving about inside, and presently an
ancient dame began to take certain jars
from the window and fill them with
sweets from boxes on the counter. Evi-
dently a new stock had just arrived.
Then I remembered that sweets had
been “freed.”
A little girl stopped beside me, stared
through the window and then ran off at-
top speed. Within a couple of minutes
half-a-dozen youngsters were peering
into the shop, and a pair of them
marched in, consulting earnestly as
they went. The news spread; more
children arrived. I distributed a lar-
gesse of pennies which gave me a popu-
larity I have never achieved before.
The street seemed to take on a different
aspect. I almost liked it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN OLD DOG.
THERE can be no doubt about it. Not merely is Soo-ti
getting to be an old dog, but he has already got there. He
is an old dog. Yet the change in the case of this beloved
little Pekinese has been so gradual that until it was accom-
plished few of us noticed it. Yesterday, as it seemed,
Soo-ti was a young dog, capable of holding his own for
frolics and spirits with any Pekinese that ever owned the
crown of the road and refused to stir from it though all the
hooters of Europe endeavoured to blast him off it. To-day
he is still a challenger of motor-cars; but he hurls his
defiance with less assurance and has been seen to retire
before the advance of a motor-bicycle.
Moreover, there are other signs of what his master calls,
let us hope with accuracy, a cruda viridisque semectus.
Quite a short time ago his muzzle, like the rest of him,
was as black as 'ebony. Now he wears a pair of thick
white moustachios, which are comparable only with those
worn by that great chieftain, Monsieur le Maréchal JoFFRE.
In another way too our little dog gives proof that his
years are advancing. He used to welcome ecstatically the
moment of the promenade; not that he intended thus to
show any deference to the humans who were inviting him
to take a walk, but that he thought it was a fine manly
thing to do, and one that might bring about that fight of
his against a neighbouring and detested deer-hound to
which he looked forward as to one of his unachieved
pleasures. He therefore fell not more than one hundred
yards behind his accompanists, and when this was pointed
out to him made a very creditable effort to hurry up and
rejoin. Now, however, when taken for a duty-walk, he
still barks a little at the outset, but thereafter begins at
once to lag, and is found in an armchair when the party
returns. It is vain to remind him that in the old days he
was called the little black feather for the lightness of his
gait when puffed along by the gusts of a fierce nor'-easter.
Here is one of the complimentary stanzas that were
lavished upon him by his young mistress:–
“Attend to your duty,
My brave little Soo-ti, -
There isn't much sun in the sky:
But we’ve sported together
In all kinds of weather,
My little black feather and I.”
It would be quite useless to lure him out with verse, and
plain prose is equally ineffective when once he has made
up his mind that he doesn't mean to move.
One more sign of old age there is, which I may briefly
describe. He is always much agitated when his mistress
packs her boxes to depart to an institution for higher educa-
tion of which she is a member. While this is going forward,
Soo-ti will not stir from her room except it be to couch in
the passage outside. Thence he re-transfers himself to her
room, and has been known, when the chief box is full of gar-
ments, to leap into it, to pad round in a circle three times,
and to sink down with a sigh of satisfaction on what was
once a very artistic bit of packing. I do not say that this
trick is entirely due to old age. Nearly all dogs do it.
Only there was on the last occasion a special anxiety, and
a more than usual persistence and querulousness which
seemed to say, “Don’t go too far away, and come back
soon, so that we may meet again before my eyes grow dim
and my ears lose their keenness.”
“In future all unmarried men and women having an income of
$1,000 will be taxed by the city. Married men will not be taxed
unless their income is over $1,500,000."—Canadian Gazette.
The poor fellows must have some compensation.
THE TEST OF FRIENDSHIP.
[“C.K.S.," in The Sphere, describing his numerous visits to GEoRGE
MEREDITH at Box Hill, tells us that in no real sense can he claim to
have been an intimate friend; “but then,” he adds, “I always make
the test of intimate friendship when people call one another by their
Christian names.”] + -
THE use of Christian names, says “C. K. S.”
Is intimacy's truest test; but “ George,”
When he was down at Dorking, (as you guess)
Stuck quite inextricably in his gorge; f
And to the end he never got beyond -
The Mister, though a faithful friend and fond.
How sad to think this barrier was never
Demolished, broken down and swept away,
But still remained to sunder and to sever
Two of the choicest spirits of our day !
For MEREDITH, though radiant, genial, kind,
On this one point showed an in-clement mind.
The case was simplified in days of eld;
HoMER, for instance, had no Christian name,
And an Athenian bookman, if impelled
To visit him at Chios, when he came
Across the blind old poet and beach-comber,
Addressed him probably tout court as HoMER.
PYTHAGoRAs was never Jack or Jim—
Names all unknown in ages pre-Socratic;
And SHORTER could not have accosted him
By sobriquets endearing or ecstatic ;
It would have certainly provoked a scene,
For instance, to have hailed him as “Old bean.”
Then at the “Mermaid,” had he been invited
As an illustrious brother of the quill,
Would “C. K. S.,” I wonder, have delighted
To honour WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE as “Old Bill,”
And in the small uproarious hours A.M.
Have been in turn acclaimed as “Bully CLEM "?
-
Perchance; who knows? The mystery is sealed;
Hypothesis, though plausible, is vain;
What might have been can never be revealed,
But one momentous fact at least is plain:
We know from an authoritative quarter
That MEREDITH was never “George” to Shorter.
The Twopenny Egg.
The daily press informs us that we are “in sight of the
twopenny egg." On making inquiries we learn that this
phenomenon will be invisible at Greenwich, but may be
viewed from the North of Scotland, a region happily less
inaccessible than many to which scientific expeditions have
in the past been made. At the time of writing opinions
differ as to the best point for observation, but it is probable
that the island of Foula, in the Shetland group, will be
chosen. -
“Masters and men are visibly strained by the crisis. They all know
that they are sitting on a volcano. The prelude is all icy suspicion.”
Mr. JAMEs Douglas in “The Star.”
It won't be the volcano's fault if the ice doesn't get melted.
“The complainant was ascending the staircase of the club when he
met the defendant, who, speaking of Lemberg, said Lemberg belonged
to Russia. Complainant replied: “No, it is in Poland; it cannot
belong to Russia,” when the defendant struck him with some sharp
instrument on the top of the head, and the stars had not yet com-
pletely healed.”—Evening Paper. -
The constellation referred to must, we think, have been the
Great Bear.

take sides against me. In a lucid inter-
val, while I was doing a call of my own,
the operator, without giving me any
warning, switched me on to the super-
visor. This must have been an inspira-
tion from Olympus. However I was
equal to the emergency; nay, took ad-
vantage of it. Experience has taught
me that it is always best to talk to the
person you get, whether you want that
person or not. So I explained to the
that I was a busy man,
although the rumour which
ascribed to my shoulders
the War Office, the Timber
Control and the L.D.C.S.
was, at the moment, un-
founded.
She played up magnifi-
cently; took my number,
my name, my address, the
date, the time of the day,
how many times I had been
rung up, whom by and
when, and was going to ask
me the date of my birth and
whether I was married or
single, when I protested.
Then she calmed down and
said she would have my
line seen to.
The game seemed to be
going well; but again I was
beaten by a swift stroke.
My bell rang.
“Telephone Engineering
Department speaking,” it
said. “We have received a
report that your line is out
of order. We are sending
a man and hope he will
finish the job before lunch-
eon.”
This was the end, as any-
one knows who has ever
got into the clutches of
the Telephone Engineering
Department.
“Please,” I said (my
spirit was quite broken)—
“please, for God's sake,
don't send a man. Not this
it safely.
“Sorry, old chap,” I said, “I haven't
got one.”
“Haven't what ?” he said.
“Got one.”
“One what ?"
“Extension.”
Then he became annoyed and shouted,
“Aren't you the War Office?”
“No,” I answered, “I am not the
War Office.”
“Aren't you the War Off—”
But I clapped on my receiver. In
fact I clapped it on so violently that I
thought I had silenced the thing for
good and all.
A series of tugging ineffective clicks
Sorry you have been terroubled,” and I
cut her off. One—all.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN a story bears the attractive title of The House of
Courage (DUckworth); when it begins in the Spring of
1914 with a number of pleasantly prosperous people whose
faith in the continuance of this prosperity is frequently
emphasised (“as if they had a contract with God Almighty”
is how an observant character phrases it); and when, in the
first chapter, the hero has an encounter with two Germans
in a Soho restaurant—well, it requires no great guessing to
tell what will happen before we are through with it. And,
in fact, Mrs. Victor RICKARD's latest is yet another war-
story; though with this novelty, that the hero's experiences
of service are almost entirely gained in a German prison-
camp. As perhaps I need not say, both divisions of the
tale are admirably written. It is hardly the author's fault
that the earlier half, with its pictures of a genial hunting
society in County Cork, is distinctly more entertaining than
the scenes of boredom and brutality at Crefeld, well-con-
veyed as these are and almost over-realistic and convincing.
Inevitably too the scheme is one of incident rather than
character. One has never any very serious doubt that in
the long run the hero, Kennedy, will marry the girl of his
choice, despite the fact of her engagement to the clearly
unworthy Harrington. But as part of the long run was
from Crefeld to the Dutch frontier, over every obstacle that
you can imagine (and a few more, including an admirable
thrill almost on the post), one is left with the comfortable
feeling that the prize was well earned. You will rightly
judge that most of The House of Courage is rather more
frankly sensational than Mrs. RICKARD's previous war-work;
but it remains an excellent yarn.
When Esmé Hillier, possessed by The Imp (Hodder AND
SToughton), was only ten, in a fit of annoyance she pushed
the hero (to whom she had had no previous introduction)
into the sea. I have some sympathy with her energetic
protest, for a Highland Chieftain even at the age of sixteen
should know better than to row about in an open boat
kissing a young lady. Esmé, a pained spectator, showed
her public spirit by punishing his bad form, but in the act
she sealed her own fate, for after this it was inevitable that
they should ultimately marry each other, the girl of the
kissing episode notwithstanding. The immediate incentive
to their union, which was by the Scotch method, was that
Esmé had applied mustard-plasters to a Cabinet Minister's
person by affixing them to his dress-suit, and Tourntourq,
the Chieftain, had nobly attempted to bear the blame.
Though married in haste they did not wait for leisure
before they repented, but commenced quarrelling at once,
until Esmé, in order to test his love and that of an admirer
who was helping to complicate matters, “bobbed ” her hair
and threw the severed tresses at her husband. After this
they separated. Presently the War came, and the admirer,
who was really quite a nice person, was killed, and Tourn-
tourq, who was apparently a lunatic; though that is not
stated in so many words, was blinded. It seems quite
superfluous to add that Tourntourq wins the V.C. and re-
covers both sight and wife in the last chapter; but there
are such good patches in the book that I cannot help
hoping that some day WILSON MACNAIR will try her hand

(I feel it is her hand) at another, which I shall really
believe in all through.
Of late our costume-romancers have become strangely
unprolific. So I was the more pleased to find Mrs. ALICE
WILSON Fox bravely keeping the old flag flying with a story
bearing the gallant title, Too Near the Throne (S.P.C.K.).
I daresay its name may enable you to give a fairly shrewd
guess at its plot. This is an agreeable affair of a maid,
reputed Catholic heir to the English Crown, and used as
pretext for an abortive rising against KING JAMES I. You
can see that in practised hands (as here) and decorated
with a pretty trimming of sentiment, abductions, witch-
finding and other appropriate accessories, this furnishes
a theme rich in romance. Perhaps I was a thought dis-
appointed that more was not made of the actual conspiracy,
and that, having started “too near the throne,” the tale
There can be few Irishmen who look at their England
with such affectionate eyes as Lord DUNSANY. Tales of
War (FISHER UNwiN) is full of this sweet theme. The first
of the tales is a fine story of the Daleswood men who, cut
off from their supports and worried because there would
be none left in their native village to carry on the Dales-
wood breed, were for sending out their youngest boy to
surrender. But, deciding that that wasn't good Daleswood
form, they (for their last hours, as they thought) fell to
recalling the familiar beauties of their old home and to
cutting in the Picardy chalk the roll of their names for
remembrance. You get it again, that calling-up of the
home memories, when, in another marooned party, the
Sergeant that was keeper begins with a vision of sausages
and mashed and goes on to the birds and beasts and flowers
and soft noises of English woods at night. And in a half-
dozen other sketches. And it is good to find an Irishman
subsequently gave it T
so wide a berth.
But this is no great
fault. I can witness
that Mrs. WILSON
Fox has at least one
essential quality of

But nothing has happened that can make Mr. MASEFIELD

when I took up the book and read the first few lines I was
afraid that Mr. MASEFIELD had yielded to the temptation
of delivering his speech in poetical prose of a faintly Biblical
character, as thus: “Friends, for a long time I did not
know what to say to you in this my second speaking here. |
I could fill a speech with thanks and praise—thanks for the
kindness and welcome which have met me up and down this
land wherever I have gone, and praise for the great national
effort which I have seen in so many places and felt every-
where.” Mr. MASEFIELD however soon abandoned this
manner and made the rest of his way in a good solid
pedestrian style. But he did not disdain to go so far in
flattery of the Americans, his audience, as to use the word
“gotten" for the past tense of the verb “to get.” |

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUD LARKS.
YESTERDAY morning, a freckled child,
dripping oil and perspiration and clad
in a sort of canvas dressing-gown, stum-
bled into “Remounts” (or “Demounts,”
as we should more properly call our-
selves nowadays) and presented me with
a slip of paper which entitled him, the
bearer, to immediate demobilisation on
pivotal grounds. I handed it back to
him, explaining that he had come to the
wrong shop—unless he were a horse,
of course. If he were and could pro-
vide his own nosebag, head-stall and
Army Form 1640, testifying that he
was guiltless of mange, ophthalmia or
epizootic lymphangitis, I would do what
I could for him.
He stared at me for a moment, then
at the slip, then, murmuring something
about the mistake being his, began to
feel in the numerous pouches of his
dressing - gown, bringing to light the
following items:—
(1) A spanner.
§ Some attenuated cigarettes.
(3) A picture-postcard fashioned in
silk, with tropical birds and
flowers, clasped hands, crossed
Union Jacks and the legend
“TRUE LovE '' embroidered
thereon.
(4) A handful of cotton waste.
(5) Some brandy-balls.
(6) An oil-can.
(7) The ace of spades.
(8) The portrait (tin-type) of a lady,
inscribed “With kind regards
from Lizzie.”
(9) A stick of chewing gum.
(10) A mouse (defunct).
(11) A second slip of paper.
He grunted with satisfaction, re-
placed his treasures carefully in the
pouches and handed the last-named
item to me. It read to the effect that
both he and his car were at my disposal
for the day. I wriggled into a coat and
followed him out to where his chariot
awaited us.
I never pretended to be a judge of
motor vehicles, but it does not need an
expert to detect a Drift when he sees
one; they have a leggy, herring-gutted
appearance all their own. Where it
was not dented in it bulged out; most
of those little knick-knacks that really
nice cars have were missing, and its
complexion had peeled off in erratic
designs such as Royal Academicians
used to smear on transports to make
U-Boaters imagine they were seeing
things they shouldn't and lead better
lives.
I did not like the looks of the thing
from the first, and my early impressions
did not improve when, as we bumped
off the drive on to the pavé, the screen
|suddenly detached itself from its perch
and flopped into our laps. .
However, the car put in some fast
work between our château gates and
the estaminet of the “Rising Sun"
(a distance of fully two hundred yards),
and my hopes soared several points.
From the estaminet of the “Rising Sun”
to the village of Bailleul-aux-Hondains
the road wriggles down-hill in two sharp
hair-pin bends. The car flung itself
over the edge of the hill and plunged
headlong for the first of these.
“Put on the brakes | " I shouted.
The child did some kicking and haul-
ing with his feet and hands which made
no impression whatever on the car.
“Put on the brakes, damme !” I
yelled.
The child rolled the whites of his
eyes towards me and announced briefly,
“Brake's broke.”
I looked about for a soft place to
jump. , There was none; only rock-
. plated highway whizzing past.
We took the first bend with the near-
side wheels in the gutter, the off-side ||
wheels on the bank, the car tilted at an
angle of forty-five degrees. The second
bend we navigated at an angle of sixty
degrees, the off-side wheels on the bank,
the near-side wheels pawing thin air.
Had there been another bend we
should have accomplished it upside
down. Fortunately there were no more;
but there remained the village street.
We pounced on it like a tiger upon its
prey.
“Blow your horn' " I screamed to
the child.
“Bulb's bust,” said he shortly, and
exhibited the instrument, its squeezer
missing. -
I have one accomplishment—only
one—acquired at the tender age of
eleven at the price of relentless prac-
tice and a half-share in a ferret. I can
whistle on my fingers. Sweeping into
that unsuspecting hamlet I remem-
bered this lone accomplishment of
mine, plunged two fingers into my
cheeks and emptied my chest through
them.
“Honk, honk,” blasted something in
my ear and, glancing round, I saw that
the child had swallowed the bulbless
end of his horn and was using it bugle-
wise. -
Thus, shrilling and honking, we
swooped through Bailleul-aux-Hon-
dains, zig-zagging from kerb to kerb.
A speckly cock and his platoon of hens
were out in midstream, souvenir-hunt-
ing. We took them in the rear before
they had time to deploy and sent a cloud
of fluff-fricassée sky-high. A Tommy
was passing the time o' day with the
Hebe of the Hotel des Trois Enfants,
his mules contentedly browsing the
straw frost-packing off the town water
supply. The off-donkey felt the hot
breath of the car on his hocks and
gained the Salle-à-manger (viā the win-
dow) in one bound, taking master and
mate along with him.
The great-great-granddam of the
hamlet was tottering across to the
undertakers to have her coffin tried on,
when my frantic whistling and the
bray of the bugle-horn pierced the
deafness of a century. With a loud
creaking of hinges she turned her head,
summed up the situation at a glance
and, casting off half-a-dozen decades
“like raiment laid apart,” sprang for
the side-walk with the agility of an
infant gazelle. We missed her by half-
an-inch and she had nobody but herself
to thank.
Against a short incline, just beyond
the stricken village, the car came to a
standstill of its own accord, panting
brokenly, quivering in every limb.
“She's red-'ot,” said the child, and I
believed him.
From the kettle arrangement in the
bows came the sound of hot water sing-
ing merrily, while from the spout steam
issued hissing. The tin trunk, in which
lurks the clockwork, emitted dense
volumes of petrol-perfumed smoke from
every chink. The child climbed across
me and, dropping overboard, opened
the lid and crawled inside. I lit a pipe
and perused the current “La Vie Paris-
ienne.”
The clockwork roared and raged and
exploded with the sharp detonations
of a machine-gun. Sounds of violent
coughing and tinkering came from the
bowels of the trunk, telling that the
child was still alive and busy. Presently
he emerged to breathe and wipe the
oil off his nose.
“Cylinder missin',” he announced.
I was not in the least surprised.
“Probably dropped off round that last
bend,” said I. “Very nearly did my-
self. How many have we got left?”
He gaped, muttered something inco-
herent and plunged back into the trunk.
The noise of coughing and tinkering
redoubled. The smoke enveloped us
in an evil-smelling fog.
“Think she'll go now,” said the
child, emerging once more. He climbed
back over me, grasped the helm and
jerked a lever. The car gave a dreadful
shudder, but there was no other move-
ment.
“What's the matter now 2 ” I asked
after he had made another trip to the
bows.
He informed me that the car had
moulted its winding handle.
“You’ll 'ave ter push 'er till the
engine starts, Sir,” said he.
"Oh, will I? And what will you be

THE SCANDAL.

ON THE RHINE.
II.
THERE is an expression here which I
expect will shortly become as familiar
as “Na poo,” and that is, “Hoot up!”
When I first heard our mild and gently-
mannered Carfax employ it as a vigorous
word of command to a civilian in this
small German village, I thought he
had gone a little mad. For no good
military purpose, it seemed to me,
could possibly be served by demanding
an imitation of an owl at eleven o'clock
on a wintry morning. It argued a per-
verted sense of humour at least; and
in truth I had been expecting a slight
lapse from the paths of sanity on the
part of our Mr. Carfax for some time.
For, you see, he is a pivotal man who
cannot get away until others arrive to
replace the pivots, and it is difficult
to persuade him that all is for the best.
But he informed me that “Hoot up”
had nothing whatever to do with the
night-cries of owls or any other kind
of bird, but was in fact the idiotic way
in which the natives of this country
pronounce “Hut ab" (Hat off).
Now you realise what horrid Huns
we are. Civilians are obliged to take
off their hats to British officers—a very
grim business. In reality, except that
we are the hated English, it makes
very little difference to the Bosch, for
the innkeeper here says that orders
concerning the taking off of hats to all
and sundry became so stringent in
1918 that the local postman was con-
stantly interrupted in his duties to an-
swer the salutes of people who wished
to be on the safe side.
Bosches who have really fought for
their country do not object to “Hoot-
upping.” They of course are the first
to realise that inhabitants of occupied
countries were forced by them to “hoot
up,” and that therefore there is a certain
justice now in the retaliation. Anyway,
from these people the procedure does
not greatly interest us; but the over-
dressed Bosch profiteer, fat and muttony
—to hoot him up in his own village'
Really, you know, in some ways the
War has been worth while.
But the knowledge that he is carry-
ing out a perfectly definite order does
not make the subaltern turn any the
less pink the first time he ticks off a
civilian for failing to comply with the
regulations. No, you can't produce a
really good Hun without lots of prac-
tice. I made almost a companion of
the Sergeant-Major at first, because he
used to say it for me; but the second
day I got caught. It came as I was
picking my way down the main (and
only) street of the village. My atten-
tion being riveted upon keeping my
feet, for there are little streams on
either side of the street which freeze
and flood it, making life in army boots
difficult, I did not notice the ap-
proach of the fellow until he was on
me. And then I saw it was a real
Hunnish Hun; and, oh joy! he had a
fur coat and a face which I had not
thought could exist outside bad dreams.
His wicked little eyes glared insolently
at me, and he strolled by with his hat
stuck at a rakish angle; and for the
life of me, would you believe it? I could
not remember the magic words. Turn-
ing in desperation I commanded him
without further delay to “hot hoop.”
He appeared surprised. He made no
sort of motion to comply with my order.

“Hut hop!” I cried, purple with vex-

of headgear remained jauntily perched
over his square ugly face. Advancing
threateningly I thundered out that it
was my firm intention that he should,
under peril of instant arrest, “take his
confounded hat off 1". At this final
command (the first he had found intel-
ligible) he grabbed hastily at the of-
fending article, slipped up on the ice,
and, in my moment of triumph, so
did I.
It is a sickening business sitting on
the ground opposite a man you don't
like, but I had the better of it in the
end, for I had sat down where the water
was already frozen, and he hadn't.
Our Mr. Carfax too had an awkward
incident happen to him. We were
walking down the street discussing the
Pay Warrant, which gives the young
Army of Occupation a bonus from Feb-
ruary 1st, and gives us nothing for
doing their job until May, when sud-
denly a civilian passed us with a mere
nod. Mr. Carfax went on with his in-
subordinate conversation, oblivious to
the insult.
“Mr. Carfax,” I said sadly, “when
will you learn that private affairs must
never be allowed to interfere with mili-
tary duties?”
“Sir,” he said, surprised and ag-
grieved, “though a pivotal man of
some years' standing I really am taking

“It is not that,” I said; “but do you
know you allowed a civilian to pass on
your side without taking his hat off?”
Scarlet with chagrin he rushed back
after the offender and “hooted him
up" more sternly than I could have
believed possible for anybody but a
Hun to the manner bred. -
“I’m most awfully sorry,” said the
man, “but I've only just got out and
didn't know about it.” It transpired
(as they say) that he was an English-

give you a veritable frisson d'amgoisse.
No, it doesn't concern the Peace Con-
ference; it's something far worse than
that. Figurez-vous, the new style of
coiffure is severe to the point of being
absolutely terrifying—that is to the
woman who has been shivering on the
brink of thirty for any length of time.
Foreheads are coming in again—que
c'est embétant 1 I thought they'd been
abolished long ago. I wish I could get
hold of the méchant (for I know it's a
man) who is introducing them now. I
had my hair dressed chez Manet to-day
in the new style, and when I saw myself
afterwards I sat down and wept like
the women of Babylon.
Quel horreur ! My locks were strained,
brushed, tightened back, and I was left
high and dry with my exposed brow
revealing four furrows to an unsympa-
thetic world. C'est navrant. We're
not to be allowed even the soupçon of a
wave or the lightest bouffée, while side-
curls are quite démodés.
I think the situation is really tragic.
So few women can afford to have a
forehead. The result will be that lots
of our débutantes of some seasons ago
will be “coiffées à Ste. Catherine” in
more senses than one.
The “jewellery” one wears now is
made of wood ; we have carved wooden
beads, wooden bracelets, even wooden
rings. “Therefore it will be cheap!”
you exclaim. Wous vous trompez, mon
amie. I read a story the other day of
an American who said that if you want
an egg here for breakfast it is cheaper
to buy the hen and hope she'll lay next
morning, and in any case you've got
the hen. Eh bien, should you desire
a set of wooden jewellery you might
save money if you bought a forest.
Paris has done more than extend le
bon accueil to the Peace delegates; she
is giving their names to the latest thing
in vétements. Thus we have the Lloyd
George cravate, the Wilson gilet and
the “Bonarlaw” chapeau melon. It's
surprising how far-reaching are the
effects of a Peace Conference.
A number of mous autres Anglais
over here started a perfectly thrilling
idea. It was really in the way of being
an adventure. We have been exploring
the quaint little cafés of Paris, with
results tout a fait 6tonnants. We were
served with provokingly delicious plats,
at a price absurdly moderate compared
with what is extorted from us in the
hotels. Of course we were all en-
chanted. We became habitués of cafés
and ceased to take any meals at our
hotels beyond the matutinal café com-
let.
And then, quite suddenly, a horrid
newspaper article appeared which con-
veyed suggestions extrémement désagré-
ables. It insinuated, ma chère, that
“things are not what they seem "–at
any rate things in the bill of fare at the
moderately-priced eating-house.
It went on to speak of the many uses
that domestic animals are put to after
their labours on earth are ended. If
it was horse that figured in the bouf
bourguignon served up to me, or the
potée de baºuf aur choua (of which I
will admit I raffole) I have no quarrel
with it. It's the “lapin " I have had
occasionally that's giving me the most
qualms. I can't look at a cat now with-
out a shudder.
As for Bertie, he says whenever he
thinks of the tripes d la mode de Caen
he so often favoured, he's very glad that
he has even less imagination than his
friends credit him with.
Of course the article may have been
inspired by the keepers of hotels who
were losing our custom. I think it's
more than likely. But we've decided
for the present to give the hotels the
benefit of the doubt.
Toujours,
Your well-devoted ANNE.
DELYSIOUS DETAILS.
A conte MPORARY, hearing of the re-
ported engagement of two well-known
persons in the world of Music and the
Drama, interviewed the lady and ob-
tained from her the following synopsis
of the crucial moment:-
“I was lunching with my costumier
this afternoon, and among the people
there was M After luncheon he
asked me to be his wife. I said 'Yes,’
and the marriage takes place next
week. We've been friends since I was
twelve years old, and his music is the
finest I have ever heard.” -
Spurred to emulation by this striking
example of journalistic enterprise, cor-
respondents in all parts of the world
are composing piquant descriptions of
similar contracts. We offer two ex-
amples:—
1. Miss Fanny W. Adie consented to
give the correspondent of The Pop-
pleton Observer a few particulars of
her engagement to Captain Scorcher,
O.B.E.:—
“I was sitting on my ambulance
having a biscuit and tin of bully with
Alphonse (my French poodle), when
suddenly there was a terrific crash. It
appears, as I learnt later, that Captain
Scorcher was motoring to Lille to pur-
chase whisky and other medical com-
forts, when the steering-gear of his
60-H.P. Rolls-Ford came away in his
hands, with the result that he nose-
dived into the rear of my ambulance
at forty miles per hour. When I came
to my senses my head was in the ditch
and the rest of me in mid-air. Captain
Scorcher, crawling out of the wreckage,
said, “Do you reverse?' and then asked
me to be his wife. I said ‘Yes,' mean-
ing I reversed, and the marriage takes
place as soon as we arrive at the same
hospital. We have been more or less
bosom-friends for five minutes, and I
think his moustache is the sweetest
thing I ever met.”
2. Asked if she could confirm her
reported engagement to Lord Bertie
Brasshatte, Miss Fifi Thistledowne—
who dances “The Camisole Squeeze”
so daintily in “Really, Girls 1” (the
Mausoleum revue)—recounted to the
correspondent of The Jazzers' Gazette
the following romantic story:—
“I was having oysters and stout with
my chiropodist at his place in Stepney,
and among the people there was Lord
Bertie Brasshatte, who is a martyr
to cold feet, contracted during his visit
to Boulogne in 1918. (How can we
ever repay these brave men for the
hardships they have suffered?) Well,
after the tenth oyster he passed me two
slips of buff paper, pinned together.
On the first was written, “For informa-
tion and necessary action, please;' and
on the other, “Are you engaged to-
morrow 2' I said, ‘No,' and the mar-
riage takes place as soon as my agent
can make arrangements with the illus-
trated papers. We've been friends
ever since Lord Bertie left a lovely
diamond tiara in my waste-paper bas-
ket, and I think his suppers are the
finest I have ever tasted.
HIMALAYANS AT PLAY.
(Suggested by the sequel to a recent
Lecture.)
THE Chairman, Sir Norman Everest,
after congratulating the lecturer on
his interesting address and beautiful
photographs, observed that he remained
unconvinced by his arguments in favour
of approaching Mount Amaranth from
the North. The climatic difficulties of
that route were in his opinion insuper-
able, to say nothing of the hostility of
the natives of the Ong-Kor plateau and
the Muzbakh valley. He still believed
that the best mode of approach was
from the South-West, following the
course of the Sissoo river to Todikat,
where an ample supply of yaks could
be obtained, and thence proceeding
along the Dagyolong ridge to Tumlong.
Sir Francis Oldmead said that he
had seldom heard a more interesting
lecture or seen a finer collection of
photographs. He must be allowed to
demur, however, to the lecturer's de-

e met with the slightest difficulty
from the Pangolins of Phagdub. As for
the best approach to Mount Amaranth
he was convinced that the only feasible
route was to work up the Yulmag valley
to the Chikkim frontier at Lor-lumi,
crossing the Pildash at Gonglam, and,
skirting the deep gorge of the Spudgyal,
ascend the Takpa glacier to Teshi
Tsegpa.
Professor Parbatt expressed his keen
appreciation of the vivid descriptions
of Himalayan scenery given by the
lecturer, and the admirably-selected
photographs which had enlivened his
address. He wished, however, that he
could have furnished more details as
to his camp equipment. Had he, for
example, used Nummulitic beds for his
party? Then there was the question
of geoidal deformation, on which he
had remained unaccountably silent.
As for the vital problem of approaching
Mount Amaranth, he ventured to differ
from all the previous speakers. The
Northern, South-Western and Eastern
routes were all equally impracticable,
as he would conclusively demonstrate
from the photographs he had brought
with him. But there were at least four-
teen routes from the West, of which
he would confine himself to four. (1)
Starting from Yeh, the party might
cross the Tablung-La pass to Gorkpa
Nor, and thence follow the Yombo to
Chilgat, where they would be only
twenty-five miles from the foot of the
western face of Amaranth. (2) They
could follow the old Buriat pack-road
to Amdo, diverge by the narrow defile
of Koko-Pir-Panjal to Tumbung, and
thence make for Chapchu-Srong and
Chyang-Chub. Gyultshan. (3) They
might start from Pongrot and cross the
Tok-Tok pass to Pilgatse. (4) They
might construct a tube from Darjiling
to Grogma-Nop, and thence proceed
by aeroplane to the saddle of Makalu,
or, better still, to the summit of
Amaranth itself. The last route was
far the shortest and quickest, but it
involved a certain amount of prelim-
inary expense.
The Chairman having expressed his
regret that Sir Marcon Tinway was
not present to describe his experiments
with man-lifting kites and trained al-
batrosses, the assembly dispersed after
singing the Tibetan national anthem.

AN UNHAPPY HERO.
Poor Clayton-Vane's case is one of
the most poignant peace tragedies that
have come to my notice. He had just
acquired an inexplicable but genuine
enthusiasm for stockbroking when the
War gave him the opportunity of de-
veloping into a remarkably brilliant
officer. Not only did he attain his
majority, but gathered a perfect chest-
ful of decorations, including all the
common varieties and several which
leave civilians guessing. .
: Yet strange to say the man who has
won these honours in war detests
soldiering with all his heart. He fought
as a duty, and did his share with furi-
ous energy in the hope of so shorten-
ing the War. His hatred of the military
profession is indeed equalled only by
his love of stockbroking and by his
natural pride in having scrapped right
on from the word “Go || " till No-
vember 10th, 1918, when he was sent
home slightly wounded.
Now the tragedy of which he is the
pathetic central figure is the result of
his remarkably youthful appearance.
Every time his portrait figures in The
Daily Scratch, people say, “Why, he
looks a mere child ! But then these
Press photographs always do distort
one so.” Yet in this instance people are
unjust. Clayton-Vane, after a four years'
flirtation with death, has the face and
figure of a careless chubby schoolboy.
When he is in uniform this youth-
fulness only adds lustre to his blushing
honours.
Now my unhappy friend is on the
horns of a dilemma. He pines to go
back to broking as sincerely as some
men pine to travel or to write poetry,
but every time he ventures out in
mufti some painful incident warns him
what he will have to suffer as a civilian,
with his round rosy face, innocent blue
eyes, curly hair and bright smile. He
hears himself referred to as a chip of
the old block. Chance acquaintances
ask him if his father or big brothers
were at the Front. To-day, he told me
very bitterly, he was asked if he did
not wish the War had lasted a little
longer so that he might have been old
enough to go out and fight ! -
“I can't bear it, old man,” he said.
“There's something about me that
draws out their sentimentality, and
they've all got to say something about
my youth, and the heritage of peace
that the 1917 conscripts won for me.
They talk as if I had been busy with a
feeding-bottle instead of compressing
my silly face in a box-respirator.”
His dilemma is a very painful one
for a man so sensitive and at the same
time so enamoured of stockbroking.
Hard as the renunciation will be, I
really believe he will end by turning
his back on the Exchange for ever and
taking a regular commission, though I
try to persuade him that if he will only
brave the horrors of peace as he braved
the horrors of war he will win through
in the end and grow out of his face.

Duke of Venice (the Lord Chancellor), to Portia. “You ARE WELCOME: TAKE YoUR PLACE."—Merchant of Venice, Act IV. Sc, 1.
Monday, March 10th. — Sir JAMES
AGG-GARDNER asked two questions
dealing with the distribution of poisons.
By a singular coincidence—or was it
design?—the hon, baronet was himself,
as Chairman of the Kitchen Committee,
accused by Mr. BottomLEY of having
purveyed poison in the shape of stale
fish to sundry Members of the House,
thereby causing them serious internal
disturbance. Happily he was able to
show that the charge was entirely
baseless.
Scots legal terminology always puzzles
me. The “peremptory diets” which
Mr. MACQUISTEN urged upon the atten-
tion of the SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
as a remedy for the grievances of Glas-
gow's financiers are not, as you might
suppose, a synonym for forcible feed-
ing; nor have they anything to do with
the substitutes for “parritch” to which,
as I gathered from Mr. STURRocK, the
people of Scotland are being obliged to
resort owing to the high price of oat-
meal.
Members rubbed their eyes a little
when they heard Colonel AMERY declare
that the general policy of the Govern-
ment regarding Imperial Preference
had been “clearly defined,” and in the
ensuing debate Sir DoNALD MACLEAN
declared that, on the contrary, their
whole fiscal policy was “wrop in
mystery.”
The veil was lifted to some extent by
Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs, the Ministerial
“handy man,” who, in the absence
through illness of Sir ALBERT STANLEY,
explained how the Government pro-
posed to regulate imports and exports
during the transitional period. Up to
September 1st our manufacturers are
to enjoy a sort of close-time, free from
foreign competition, but after that they
must, like the partridges, take their
chance.
Later in the evening the House wel-
comed a new orator in Dr. MURRAY,
who sits for the Western Isles. He
made a rousing appeal on behalf of the
men—practically the whole able-bodied
population—who had gone from them
to fight the Empire's battles. In his
view the SECRETARY For Scotland
was too mild in his methods, and
should be “bristling with thistles and
flourishing the claymore" when he
tackled the reform of the Land Laws.
Mr. MUNRo was evidently flattered by
this tribute to the martial potentiali-
ties underlying his eminently pacific
exterior.
Tuesday, March 11th.-In moving
the Second Reading of his Bill to en-
able women to become barristers and
solicitors, Lord BUCKMASTER thought
it necessary to assure the House that
there was no danger of its flooding the
Inns with prospective Bar-maids. He
might have spared his apologetics, for
there was no opposition. The Lord
CHANCELLOR welcomed the Bill on be-
half of the Government, and expressed
the conviction that the Benchers, though
not “avid of this change,” would never-
theless loyally co-operate if Parliament
saw fit to adopt it.
Having caught the infection from
the Commons the Peers then proceeded
to discuss their own procedure. From
Lord CURzoN we learned, somewhat to
our surprise, that the House possesses
certain Standing Orders. At present
it honours them chiefly in the breach,
and in its Leader's view it would do
well to imitate the more orderly proce-
dure of another place, even to the adop-
tion of “starred questions” and the
abandonment of the practice by which
any noble Lord, by the simple process
of addressing an inquiry to a Minister,
can initiate a full-dress debate. Lord
CREWE's pious hope that these sugges-
tions would enable more noble Lords
to take part in the debates was wel-
comed by Lord AMPTHILL, who re-
marked that, after nearly thirty years

is much addicted, and by the time the
measure emerges from Committee its
own draughtsman will hardly recog-
nise it.
The best of the many Amendments
complacently accepted, after a show of
reluctance, by the Government spokes-
men, was one providing that no increase
of rent shall be chargeable except in
the case of a house “reasonably fit for
habitation.” That should make some
of our slum-owners sit up and take
notice.
Wednesday, March 12th. — An ap-
parently innocent request from Lord
SUDELEY for the reinstatement of the sys-
tem of guide-lecturers in the Museums
led to quite a lively debate. Other
noble lords used the motion as a peg
for a fierce indictment of the Govern-
ment's treatment of these institutions
during the War. Lord CRAwford, who
has probably forgotten more about Art
than some of his critics ever knew, con-
cealed his real sympathy for the motion
under a mask of official obstructiveness,
but was compelled eventually to give it
a strictly provisional acceptance.
In the old days when the possession
of a seat was secured by the deposit of
a hat it was no uncommon thing, on
the morning of a big debate, to see a
Member staggering in under a load of
toppers, with which he proceeded to
secure seats for his friends. To put an
end to this nefarious practice the card-
system was introduced; but that, it is
said, has now been similarly abused.
One man one card, however, is in future
to be the rule. Colonel WILL THORNE
feared that it might still be circum-
vented by the “stage army" trick; but
the SPEAKER thought the attendants
might be trusted to recognise and de-
feat any Member who essayed it.
Rear-Admiral Sir REGINALD HALL,
having added to his laurels by defeat-
ing a NELSON at Liverpool, took his
seat this afternoon, and was loudly
cheered for the manner in which he
came into action. He and his supporters
| maintained their “line abreast" and
discharged their salvoes of salutes to
the Chair with faultless precision.
Later on the gallant Admiral earned
further cheers for a capital maiden
speech on the Naval Estimates. These
were introduced by Mr. LoNG, who
told the story of the Navy's triumph
with all a landsman's enthusiasm. Its
future size may to a certain extent de-
pend upon the Judgment of Paris, but
he was certain that, come what may,
ference.”
the Nation would always insist on
having a Fleet sufficient for our needs
—a sentiment which received the wel-
come endorsement of Mr. BRACE for
the Labour Party.
According to Commander NoFXIAN
CRAIG it was anything but sufficient
for our needs when war broke out. It
lacked docks, destroyers, submarines,
air-ships — everything, in fact, save
Dreadnoughts, which, in the absence
of these accessories, had to belie their
name and rush from one unprotected
anchorage to another in fear of the
German mosquito - craft. Only the
courage of the officers and men saved
us, and up to the present—that was
the tenor of many of the speeches—
they have reaped but a scanty reward.

Nearly every problem pre-
sented to them depends for its ultimate
solution upon the decisions arrived at
in Paris. Lord STUART OF WoRTLEy,
for example, put a series of most press-
ing questions regarding the present
condition and future prospects of
Poland; but Lord CURzoN in reply
could only shrug his shoulders (at con-
siderable length) and refer him to the
Conference.
The LEADER of the House of Com-
mons labours under similar disabili-
ties, which are beginning to try even
his amiable temper. Until Paris has
spoken he cannot give definite informa-
tion about the Government's fiscal
policy, the amount of the German in-
demnity and other pressing topics, and,
as he told some of his persistent ques-
tioners this afternoon, it is no good
putting the same question to him every
week and expecting a different answer.

Five years ago General SEELY, then
Secretary of State for War, asked
timidly for a single million for air-

Air, he boldly demanded sixty-six
millions, and explained that but for the
Armistice the amount would have been
two hundred millions. And the House,
after hearing his glowing account of
the wonderful achievements of our air-
men, readily voted the money. A good
deal of it is to go, quite rightly, to
relieving the hardships of demobilisa-
tion, which fall with peculiar severity
on men whose special training is not
much use to them in civil life. The
least we can do when they are forced
to descend from their chosen element
is to insure them against a bad landing.

THE BIBLE IN PAIN.
MR. H. G. WELLs' new novel, based
on the Book of Job, and Mr. ARNOLD
BENNETT's new play dealing with the
story of JUDITH and HoloFERNEs, by no
means exhaust the Biblical and Apo-
eryphal motives from which our popular
writers are now drawing inspiration.
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD's next novel
will be a minutely analytical study of
the contrasted temperaments of ESAU

and the other for a rather smooth and
supple orthodoxy.
Mr. E. PHILLIPs OPPENHEIM is turn-
ing his attention to a new spy romance
woven about the experiences of CALEB
and Josh UA.
Professor CHALMERs MITCHELL has
long been engaged on a monograph on
the Ark and its inmates, in which the
famous zoologist will explain the con-
ditions under which the animals lived,
the segregation and food problems, and
how the complexities following disem-
barcation were dealt with by NoAH and
his family. Lord PIRRIE is contribut-
ing a chapter on the structure of the
vessel, and there will be an appendix
on the dangers of overcrowding by Sir
ARTHUR NEwsHolME.
Mr. GALsworthy has also been turn-
ing his attention to the Ark, and the
inhumane congestion of the creatures
that were packed into it. The result
should be a very interesting psycho-
logical and sociological work, the lead-
ing character being HAM's wife, whom
the novelist figures as a protester to
her father-in-law against his treatment
of all the animals, but in particular of
the two Pekinese spaniels.
Mr. ALEC WAUGH has nearly com-
pleted an indictment of private tuition
based on the story of SAMUEL and ELI.
Mr. H. B. IRVING, turning aside for
the moment from the study of more
recent turpitude, is preparing an analy-
tical memoir on the first murder, that
of ABEL by CAIN. With all his well-
known thoroughness he reconstructs
the crime and shows in what particulars
CAIN, although an innovator, proved
himself also an adept.
Mr. GEORGE MooRE is meditating a
revised version of the story of Joseph
and his Brethren, which in his opinion
is sadly in need of re-writing, suffering
as it does from an unsophisticated sim-
plicity of diction and thought.
Mr. CoNRAD is busy with a new ro-
mance treating of JonAH and the whale,
in which, for the sake of verisimilitude,
JoNAH will himself recount his strange
adventure to a few personal friends.
As the narrative runs to over a hundred

[MARCH 19, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DAISY.
HE was always called Daisy. We
hated the name, but the christening
“just happened" with the suddenness
of influenza or an earthquake. Percy
was the culprit, for he knocked all our
pre-arranged plans for a name on the
head by his passion for what he calls
“apt quotation.” When he (Daisy)
emerged from his basket we saw that,
like NELsoN, he was blind of an eye.
Percy, immediately inspired, quoted
from WoRDsworth's Ode to the Daisy,
“A little Cyclops with one eye"—and
the result was inevitable. Daisy re-
sented the name from the first, for at
the very font, so to speak, he drew
blood from us both, and then, utterly
indifferent to our feelings, settled him-
self on the top of an empty beer barrel
and there performed his evening ablu-
tions.
It was a curious coincidence that
made him select a beer barrel, for
thereby hung a tragic tale. He and
his twin-brother had been adopted from
infancy by the Sergeants' Mess and
had lived in peace and plenty—in fact
in too much plenty, for I regret to say
that Daisy's brother died of drink from
having formed the discreditable habit
of emptying all the dregs of the Ser-
geants' beer mugs into his own inside.
However, he was granted military obse-
quies, which were so successfully per-
formed that an account of them found
its way into one of the daily papers.
This so delighted the amateur under-
takers that Daisy's brother was at once
exhumed and re-buried with further
pomp and circumstance. Daisy mean-
while, feeling himself of less conse-
quence than the departed hero, began
to mope; so to save life and reason he
was sent to us “to cheer and cherish,”
as the Sergeants put it.
An egotistical irascible bachelor sea-
gull; yet his vices, and he was made
up of them, became virtues in our eyes.
The morning after his arrival he
went for a solemn tour of investigation,
finally taking up his abode in the middle
of the tennis-court, as being to his mind
the most salubrious spot—and from
there he ruled despotically. “That
blooming bird fears neither man nor
devil,” Cook was heard to mutter, after
he had embedded his beak in her ankle;
and it was quite true. He so terrified
Horatio, our portly bull-dog, by peck-
ing at his sensitive kinky tail from
behind when he was absent-mindedly
lapping water from Daisy's bath, that
he never again ventured alone on to
the lawn. I say “alone,” for he dared
once more, emboldened by the presence
of his unwilling young wife, who accom-
panied him, tied by a rope to his collar.
Percy and I watched them advance
from afar and waited in suspense for
the sequel. Daisy was taking a post-
prandial nap inside his beer barrel.
There was a breathless hush, followed
by a pandemonium of sound, masculine
and feminine cries of distress mingled
with raucous shrieks of anger, and then
we saw our valiant couple in slow but
ignominious retreat. Horatio was drag-
ging his spouse along on her back, with
legs in air and bulging eyes! What
had happened in the interim we never
knew, but both Mr. and Mrs. Horatio
bore marks of battle, and they were
sadder and wiser dogs for many days
to come.
Percy, always deprecatingly anxious
to find favour in Daisy's eyes, tore
down to the shore one morning before
breakfast and returned with a large
pailful of salt water, which he laid
—so to speak—at Daisy's feet. Daisy
glanced at it and at Percy with his
cold grey eye, and then stepped lightly
into his fresh-water tub, which was
always at hand. Percy however, being
of an unsnubbable disposition, tried
again to find a way into Daisy's heart,
and this time he brought Hengist and
Horsa, two young seagulls that he had
found derelict on the rocks, hoping
that he would take a paternal interest
in their loneliness; but, like his great
prototype, Daisy clapped his glass to
his sightless eye, and “I'm damned if
I see them,” he said. But he saw
them all right at meal times, when he
would whisk round suddenly as their
portion of fish was flung to them, and
swiftly gobble it up !
So Daisy prospered and grew sleek
and ſat, and his days were long in the
land. He consented indeed to partake
of our hospitality for over a year, won
many hearts, but kept his own intact,
until the following spring, when a
young man's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of love; then he preened his
white waistcoat and sallied forth.
::: :: : : ::
Did I say he was a bachelor 2 The
last we heard of him was from a fisher-
man friend who, when in search of sea-
birds' eggs, saw and recognised our
Daisy by the fierceness of his one eye.
He was reluctantly taking his turn
on the family egg while Mrs. Daisy
tretched and titivated herself after her
domestic labours.
Does he sometimes, we wonder, think
regretfully of his celibate days and the
beer barrel, where he lived en garçon 2

DEMOBILISED DAYDREAMS.
AT 10 A.M. or so (in bed,
With lowered blinds and curtains
drawn),
There wander lightly through my head
Memories of ruddy dawn—
A thing 1 never could have said
Before we warred against the Hun,
For then, although I may have heard
That this phenomenon occurred,
I had no notion how the thing was
done.
A stranger to the birth of day,
How many have I watched since
then |
At least a thousand, I should say
(It seems to me like ten);
On Salisbury Plain, austere and grey,
Breaking night's gloom and deepen-
ing mine,
When, crawling forth, I used to see
Stonehenge all shaken visibly
By the rude Sergeant's bellow, “Rise
and shine !”
Gilding the foam of distant seas—
And humbly then I bowed my neck
And sank forlornly to my knees
To swab the blooming deck;
A wealth of flaming pageantries,
When, in a dusty Indian fort,
I went to early morning jerks,”
Cursing the sun and all his works
And dripping perspiration by the
quart;
In Fgypt, too, a pallid glow
Through swirls of desolating dust—
There often have I watched it grow,
Fed up enough to bust;
In Palestine, uncertain, slow
(While standing-to, with drowsy
eyes),
Herald of shells and, what was worse,
Waking the ancient Eastern curse,
A hundred thousand million ravenous
flies.
Sombre, inspiring, radiant, chill,
Mysterious, wild, inert, ablaze,
A thousand times on plain and hill
The dawn has held my gaze;
Idly I dream of it, until
A sterner mood invades my brain
And I grow resolute. Here and now
I register a mighty vow -
Never to see the beastly thing again.

MR. H. M. HYNDMAN brings to Clemenceau : the Man and
his Time (GRANT RICHARDs) a specialised knowledge of
| the intricacies of French politics, personal friendship with
his subject and a sympathy not discounted by profound
differences of opinion. Here is one veteran fighting man
writing a brilliant (I don't use the word as a cliché) chronicle
and commentary of the battles of another, battles which
cover the same period and were fought broadly for the same
causes. But the French Radical extremist could never see
his way to subscribe to the Socialist creed. His stalwart
individualism, in part temperamental, was also as a politi-
cal working faith the result of a distrust of logic divorced
| from the experience and responsibility of actual adminis-
tration. Somewhat similarly the English Socialist refused
to let logic press him into the premature Internationalism
of so many of his associates, nor did he share their trust, so
ruthlessly betrayed, in German Social Democracy as having
either the power or the serious intention of thwarting
German Imperialism. If a man's achievement be rightly
gauged by the difficulties he has overcome, then M. CLE-
MENCEAU, called unwillingly and unwilling at the most
desperate crisis of the destiny of a distracted and dispirited
| France hammered by the enemy's legions and with the
pass ready for sale by false friends, may well justify Mr.
HYNDMAN's verdict on him as the statesman of the Great
War. The man who catne into the War a mere Tiger will
go out of it an authentic Lion.
“Miss BERTA RUCK.” is among the few writers from whom
I can really enjoy stories about the War. She has an en-
gaging way with her that can turn even that (at least the
more endurable aspects of it) to favour and prettiness. And
in The Land Girl's Love Story (HopDER AND SToUGHToN),
a theme after her own heart, she has given us what is,
I think, her best achievement so far. It is an excellent
slight tale of two heroines who took their patriotic turn at
the work of the land army on a Welsh farm, and the adven-
tures, agricultural and (of course) amorous, that befell them
there. It is all the best-humoured affair imaginable, re-
freshingly full of country airs and brisked up with a fine
flavour of romance. “Miss RUck” has the neatest hand for
this kind of thing; she permits no loose ends to the series
of love-knots that she ties so amusingly. So the finish of
the comedy deserves the epithet “engaging” in more senses
than one; with a Jack to every Jill, and the harvest moon
(as promised in the cover picture) beaming upon all, the
couples paired off to everyone's entire satisfaction. A tale
that will be safe for a succès fou with all who have worn
the smock and the green armlet; while I can well imagine
that ladies less fortunate may find their enjoyment of it
tempered with a certain wistfulness.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
German Days (MURRAY) is a plain tale of everyday life
in Germany before the War, with just those gaps in it
which would naturally occur in the narrative of any one
observer who also hadn't been aware at the time that she
was observing. “A Polish GIRL (C.B.)" has written this
account with an engaging frankness and an apparent lack
of exaggeration which distinguish it among books of its
kind. It is largely a record of school days, and “C.B.,” as
the child of a Polish Jew of good standing living in Posen,
suffered slights and insults and met with injustices which
a “true German" would not have had to endure; but she
does not seem embittered. Her picture of the German at
home has not made me yearn to renew my acquaintance with
him, but it seems to explain the origin of some of his most
unpleasant qualities. Since, as “C.B.” and other writers
would have us know, the German soldier was cowed by
physical suffering in peace-time it is small matter for won-
members of the Biffin circle, as also by an index that is
itself a monument of inaccuracy so subtle that it must be
traced to be appreciated.
Mr. REGINALD BLUNT has scored another brilliant suc-
cess with The Wonderful Village (MILLs AND Boon). It is
one of his Chelsea books of anecdote, gossip and good talk
of which he possesses the secret. He knows how to create
the right Chelsea atmosphere and he is most artful in
leading his readers on, just as a little dog shows himself
every now and then at a decoy and thus draws the inquisi- |
tive ducks after him till they drift in with all exit cut off.
At one moment Mr. BLUNT gives you a glimpse of that
bloodthirsty butcher, KING HENRY VIII. Then you pass
to ANNE BoI.EYN, CATHERINE PARR and the PRINCEss
ELIZABETH. Further on there is a delightfully humor-
ous account by WILLIAM DE MoRGAN of his attempt
der that he became a brute
in war, or that the citizen,
to whom everything used
to be verboten, has, since
the bureaucracy which re-
gulated his smallest actions
went to pieces, shown very
little ability to regulate
them for himself. The
terrible pact, by which in
the ten years preceding the
War thousands of German
women bound themselves
to combat the predomin-
ance of the landed classes,
which was making life for
ordinary people a slow
starvation, is one of the
things which I am induced
to believe, because “C. B.”
has dealt so faithfully with
others of which I knew
already. Of books on Ger-
many from within there
have been very many, but
there is still room for such
books as this.

The title of Miss F. E.
MILLs YouNG's The Shadow
abandoned the lighter fields of literature for the heavy
plough-land of Biography. What is, I believe, his initial
venture of this kind lies before me in Biffin and His Circle
(MILLS AND Boon), a record of the career of Reginald
Drake Biffin, that eminent author with whose works (The
Bolster Book, and others) the public is already familiar;
though, by a pardonable confusion, they are more usually
associated with the name of the present biographer. It may
be said at once that, if a life of Biffin had to be written,
Captain GRAHAM was emphatically the man for the task;
indeed, from the preface, with its absorbing account of the in-
ception of the work in certain alleged convivialities between
author and publishers, to the final chapter, there is not
a page that is not calculated to inspire the reader with
profound (and in my own case frequently uncontrollable)
emotion... Nor is the work valuable for the central figure
alone. Of each member of the Biffin circle Captain GRAHAM
tells (nay, repeats) some anecdote that forms a tribute at
once to the fertility of his research and the industry of his
invention. I should not omit to add that the volume is
enriched with some admirably reproduced portraits of
of the Past (Hodder AND Stoughton) does not refer to the
youthful transgressions of any of her characters, but to the
cloud which the Boer War left behind it, to burst ultimately
in rebellion. I do not know any novelist who brings
to her work a greater sympathy with or a finer feeling for
South Africa than Miss YouNg, and if her moderate
methods do not find favour the reason can only be that for
the moment moderation is a rather unpopular quality. As
regards the actual story given to us here I find myself
unable to accept the hero, Guy Matheson, with any great
enthusiasm. Fresh from the kissing of one girl, he at
once falls heavily in love with another. Number One, how-
ever, secured him in the end, for he discovered that his
feeling for her was real affection, while passion had been
responsible for his affair with Number Two. But I fancy
that he would still need a little watching. Intermingled
with his love affairs is a tale of racial prejudice and intrigue
which is told with restraint and skill. Holman, a German
agent who had dropped an “n” for his better security, is
an obnoxious person, in whose underhand work I can quite
readily believe.

IT wasn't till Panmore noticed its
absence on his return from France that
I remembered the little oil painting
which I had left at the Ferndale
Gallery on sale or return, during the
early days of the War, when my finan-
cial outlook was bad.
Panmore said he had always wanted
to buy it, but hadn't liked to ask me if
I would part with it. I assured him
that excess even of delicacy was a mis-
take and that I would try to get the
picture back.
So I wrote to the Gallery thus:—
DEAR SIRs (it seemed absurd to
write “Dear Gallery"), In 1914 or
1915 I brought you a small oil paint-
ing, which you agreed to sell or return
to me. As I haven't heard from you
since, I conclude that there has been
| nothing doing in such pictures and I
should like to have it back. The picture
is quite a small one, about the size of
an ordinary book, and so far as I re-
collect it portrays a man looking at a
horse, to see if its withers stand where
they did; or perhaps wondering whether
he would sell it and buy a scooter. As
a matter of fact I never took particular
notice of the picture, not caring for it,
but a friend of mine who knows it well
appears interested in it and wants to
buy it. So please let me have it back
as soon as possible.
Yours faithfully,

remember, in the background; a red

We shall be glad if under the cir-
cumstances you will allow the matter
to rest until his return.

not hold ourselves responsible for the

The last paragraph in their letter
gave me the impression that they knew
they had the picture but had mislaid it.
Meanwhile Panmore seemed so hot on
it and I was so badly hit by the War
that I thought I would have another
shot at recovering it. So I addressed

DEAR SIRs, Thanks for your letter,
and in reply I should be obliged if you
could get another search party out. I
have found a receipt for the picture,
signed with a name that might, if
straightened out, be James Langford.
My friend is getting quite excited
about it, and he is the sort of person
one wants to humour. He is a Lieut.-
Colonel, an O.B.E., and, what is more
important still, one of the feoffees of
Buckley's Hospital (a fifteenth-century
foundation here), and whatever a feoffee

I forgot to mention that there is an

coming out of it carrying, perhaps, a

Three days later I received a picture
(not mine) from the Gallery with this
letter:— * -
DEAR SIR,-After a most exhaustive
search we have found and send here-
with what we believe to be your picture,
description. It is, however, the only
one of which we do not appear to have
any record.
Our Mr. Langford seems likely to be
abroad for some months, so unless you
will accept this picture in settlement of
the matter we do not see any present
way out of the difficulty.
Confident that, if it is not yours, it is
at least just as good, we trust that you
will agree to cry quits.
We are, Yours obediently,

Why they should feel sure it was
just as good, unless they remembered
my picture, wasn't very clear, but evi-
dently the receipt had put the wind up
them, and I wrote and accepted the
substitute at once, because Panmore
liked it better even than the original
picture. He said it was an Alken and
gave me far more than I would have
thought of asking for it, or for the
original one. -
About a week after selling it I re-
ceived this wire from the Gallery:-

“Diamond cut diamond,” I said to
myself. And I replied thus:—
DEAR SIRs, I received your wire,
but regret that I cannot comply with
your request. Firstly, because I have
already accepted the picture which you
regarded as mine or its equivalent, in
place of the one that was mine and is
now yours; and, secondly, because my
friend the feoffee has already bought it,
the one that was yours and is now
mine, or rather his (you know what I

Perhaps yours (the one that is now

Whatever may be the decline in the
price of eggs their social movement is
clearly upwards. The following pas-
sage from The Croydon Advertiser gives
an admirable life-history of the egg,
from shell to profit-sharing:—
“Eggs will be dated and graded and sold
accordingly, and as soon as they have done
laying fattened for table purposes, also young
cockerels. They will be killed and plucked,
and the feathers will be sorted and sold in the
best markets. So, you see they will receive
full market price for their produce; then if
they are shareholders they will receive a fur-
ther profit in the difference between the cost
and the selling, also the very big amounts re-
ceived for the skins and the feathers.”

That we shall put the foe to rout,
And, scorning peace by compromise,
Annihilate the warble-flies.
In tranquil peace the gentle beeves
Shall chew their cud through summer

Affright the calm of heifer or bull,

“INFLUENZA MICROBE DISCOVERED AT A LONDON HOSPITAL.”
MRS. BLOGGINS'S STATEMENT.
IT is not too much to say that bed-making circles in
Cambridge have been agitated to their utmost depths by
the recent advent of some hundreds of American youths
who have come to pursue certain courses of study within
the University walls. Let us make one thing perſectly clear.
Bed-makers do not object to Americans as Americans, but
this avalanche of Transatlantics arrives on the very eve of
the vacation, just when the bed-makers are packing off the
contingent of young Naval officers who have been making
things hum during the past term.
Persuaded that their too-brief holidays will be entirely
absorbed in attending to the Americans, the bed-makers urge
with some justice that they too are entitled to enjoy the
beautiful things of this enchanting world quite as much as
miners and railway-men. We understand that meetings
of their Association are being held, and that the University
authorities are faced by a situation which is rapidly passing
beyond their control. Bed-makers are amongst the most
loyal members of the community, but they feel, as a prom-
inent member of the profession put it, that “the last camel
breaks the straw's back,” and they are determined to uphold
their immemorial rights.
We have thought it our duty therefore to interview the
celebrated Mrs. Bloggins, the doyenne of the Corps of
Bed-makers of Trinity College. We found the lady in her
home in Paradise Walk, where she was engaged in eating
some excellent buttered toast. We lost no time in explain-
ing the purport of our visit.
“We desire to know, Mrs. Bloggins,” we began, “what
your feelings are with regard to the Americans.”
“Ah,” said Mrs. Bloggins, speaking with deep emotion,
“you may well call 'em Americans, for I've never bin so
troubled about anythink before. Some people seem to git
the notion into their 'eads that bed-makers do no work.
Why we're arst to slave from mornin' till night, and our pay
is paltry. Things in Cambridge isn't like what they was.
Time was when our young gentlemen used to 'ave big
dinners in their rooms, and a careful bed-maker could save a
bone or two. Nowadays they're only cheese-parers, that's
what I call 'em. You won't believe me, I know, but my
mother, who was a bed-maker afore me, used to 'ave a
month at the seaside every year, all paid for out of money
give to 'er by 'er young gentlemen. To be sure there was a
wrangler, or somethink of that kind, who didn't come up
to the mark, so she soon got rid of 'im ; 'e used to find 'is
butter was took by the cat, and accidents of that kind.
“Mind yer,” she continued, “I ain't got nothink to say
against the Americans. They may be the most liberal-
'earted gentlemen in the world for all I know. But it's the
principle of the thing I'm objectin' to. It's a case of kill
me quick or cure me to-morrow, and if President WILSON
was to talk till next week 'e couldn't make it no different.
You can't make a silk sock out of a side of bacon, and
that's true whichever way you look at it.”
“But what steps,” we urged, “does your Association
intend to take, Mrs. Bloggins, over this matter?”
“I don't know nothink about no 'sociations,” said Mrs.
Bloggins, “but I do know that we're all in it, and Mrs.
Pledger and Mrs. 'Uggins, and the rest of 'em, we knows our
power and we intends to use it.”
“In what way do you mean?" I said.
She looked at me cunningly.
“Now you're spyin'. It's dirty work and I won't 'ave
it 'ere. You might be the Proctor hisself for all I cares—
you're not going to ferret nothink out of me.”
Hereupon she rose with great dignity and plainly
indicated that the interview was at an end.

TO THE DEATH.
[According to the papers, two Frenchmen
have agreed to fight a duel in aeroplanes.]
“CAULIFLower ' " shrieked Gaspard
Volauvent across the little table in the
estaminet. His face bristled with rage.
“Serpent l” replied Jacques Rissole,
bristling with equal dexterity.
The two stout little men glared fero-
ciously at each other. Then Jacques
picked up his glass and poured the
wine of the country over his friend's
head. - -
“Drown, serpent l” he said magni-
ficently. He beckoned to the waiter.
“Another bottle,” he said. “My friend
has drunk all this.” - -- *
Gaspard removed the wine from his
whiskers with the local paper and
leant over the table towards Jacques.
“This must be wiped out in blood,”
he said slowly. “You understand 2".
“Perfectly,” replied the other. “The
only question is whose.”
“Name your weapons,” said Gaspard
Wolauvent grandly.
“Aeroplanes,” replied Jacques Rissole
after a moment's thought.
“Bah! I cannot fly.”
“Then I win,” said Jacques simply.
The other looked at him in astonish-
ment. -
“What! You fly?"
“No ; but I can learn.”
“Then I will learn too,” said Gas-
pard with dignity. “We meet—in six
months?" -
“Good.” Jacques pointed to the
ceiling. “Say three thousand feet up.”
“Three thousand four hundred,” said
Gaspard for the sake of disagreeing.
“Aſter all, that is for our seconds to
arrange. My friend Epinard of the
Roullens Aerodrome will act for me.
He will also instruct me how to bring
serpents to the ground.” -
“With the idea of cleansing the sky
of cauliflowers,” said Gaspard, “I shall
proceed to the flying-ground at Dorman-
court; Blanchaille, the instructor there,
will receive your friend.”
He bowed and walked out. -
Details were soon settled. On a date
six months ahead the two combatants
would meet three thousand two hundred
feet above the little town in which they
lived, and fight to the death. In the
event of both crashing, the one who
crashed last would be deemed the victor.
It was Gaspard's second who insisted
on this clause; Gaspard himself felt
that it did not matter. -
The first month of instruction went
by. At the end of it Jacques Rissole
had only one hope. It was that when
he crashed he should crash on some of
Gaspard's family. Gaspard had no
hope, but one consolation. It was that
no crash could involve his stomach,
which he invariably left behind him as
soon as the aeroplane rose.
At the end of the second month
Gaspard wrote to Jacques. .
“My friend,” he wrote, “the hatred of
you which I nurse in my bosom, and
which fills me with the desire to purge
you from the sky, is in danger of being
transferred to my instructor. Let us
therefore meet and renew our enmity.”
Jacques Rissole wrote back to Gas-
pard. “ …
“My enemy,” he wrote, “there is
nobody in the whole of the Roullens
aerodrome whom I do not detest with
a detestation beside which my hatred
for you seems as maudlin adoration.
This is notwithstanding the fact that I
make the most marvellous progress in
the art of flying. It is merely something
in their faces which annoys me. Let
me therefore see yours again, in the
hope that it will make me think more
kindly of theirs."
They met, poured wine over each
other and parted. After another month
the need of a further stimulant was
felt. They met again, and agreed to
insult each other weekly.
On the last day of his training Gas-
pard spoke seriously to his instructor.
“You see that I make nothing of it,”
he said. “My thoughts are ever with
the stomach that I leave behind. Not
once have I been in a position to take
control. How then can I fight? My
friend, I arrange it all. You shall take
my place.” -
“Is that quite fair to Rissole?”
asked Blanchaille doubtfully.
“Do not think that I want you to
hurt him. That is not necessary. He
will hurt himself. Keep out of his
way until he has finished with himself,
and then fly back here. It is easy.”
It seemed the best way; indeed the
only way. Gaspard Wolauvent could
never get to the rendezvous alone, and
it would be fatal to his honour if
Jacques arrived there and found no-
body to meet him. Reluctantly Blanch-
aille agreed.
At the appointed hour Gaspard put
his head cautiously out of his bedroom
window and gazed up into the heavens.
He saw two aeroplanes straight above
him. At the thought that he might
have been in one of them he shuddered
violently. Indeed he felt so unwell
that the need for some slight restorative
became pressing. He tripped off to
the estaminet.
It was empty save for one table.
Gaspard walked towards it, hoping
for a little conversation. The occupant
lowered the newspaper from in front of
his face and looked up.
It was too much for Gaspard.
“Coward ' " he shrieked.
Jacques, who had been just going to
say the same thing, hastily substituted
“Serpent l”
“I know you,” cried Gaspard. “You
send your instructor up in your place.
Poltroon l’’ -
Jacques picked up his glass and
poured the wine of the country over
his friend's head.
“Drown, serpent,” he said magnifi-
cently. He beckoned to the waiter.
“Another bottle,” he said. “My friend
has drunk all this.”
Gaspard removed the wine from his
whiskers with Jacques' paper and
leant over him.
... “This must be wiped out in blood,”
he said slowly. “Name your weapons.”
“Submarines,” said Jacques aſter a

THE SWANS OF YPRES.
YPRES was once a weaving town,
Where merchants jostled up and down
And merry shuttles used to ply;
On the looms the fleeces were
Brought from the mart at Winchester,
And silver flax from Burgundy.
Who is weaving there to-night?
Only the moon, whose shuttle white
Makes silver warp on dyke and pond;
Her hands fling veils of lily-woof
On riven spire and open roof
And on the haggard marsh beyond.
No happy ghosts or fairies haunt
The ancient city, huddling gaunt,
Where waggons crawl with anxious
wheel
And o'er the marshland desolate
Win slowly to the battered gate
That Flemings call the Gate of Lille.
Yet by some wonder it befalls
That, where the lonely outer walls
Brood in the silent pool below,
Among the sedges of the moat,
Like lilies furled, the two swans float;
“The Swans of Ypres” men call
them now.
They have heard guns and many men
Come and depart and come again,
. They have seen strange disastrous
things,
When fire and fume rolled o'er their
nest ;
But changeless and aloof they rest,
The Swans of Ypres, with folded
wings.
“Will Treasury notes ever be displaced by
boxes of chocolates?”—Daily Paper.
Certainly. Ours often are.
From the report of the Committee
on the Staffing of Government Offices
we gather that there has been a good
deal of overflapping.

THE SCHLOSS BILLET.
WE had not expected much of a billet
in a defeated and starving country; that
was probably why everybody was en-
thusiastic over it—at first. I, as billet-
ing officer, was especially proud of
having discovered it. The very thing
for Brigade Headquarters—secluded,
dignified, commanding and spacious.
A couple of kilos from the gates
through the drive brings you to the
Schloss. Entering a hall about the
size of a modern theatre you journey
to the ante-room, a vast apartment,
which for space compares favourably
with the Coliseum at Rome. A world-
exhibition of pictures and tapestries
covers the walls of the Schloss, while an
acre or two of painted ceiling shows the
chief events of German history, from
the Creation to the Franco-Prussian
War.
In the Dining-room, reached by a
progress over carpets and rugs repre-
sentative of all the best periods of
Oriental art, it would be fairly easy to
stage a review on the table itself; while
in the Music-room a hundred or solorries
could be parked without attracting ob-
servation too glaringly. Should the
need arise, the Library could accommo-
date a battalion on parade, a rifle range
or sufficient office room for Q branch
of a division. A labyrinth of corridors
and servants' bedrooms harbours the
rank and file, and it is said that the
number of kitchens, pantries and cellars
in the north and east wings runs into
three figures.
The Divisional Commander called
it “homely"; the Corps Commander
remarked that its style was “not
cramped, anyhow—what?” and the
Army Commander pronounced it very
“cosy.” -
†. first two days I did not see
my servant at all. On Wednesday he
turned up just before lunch. On Mon-
day and Tuesday, he explained, he had
wandered through corridors and pas-
sages trying to find my room, and, by
rising an hour before reveille, he thought

ES S E N C E OF P A R L | A M E N T.
Monday, March 17th.-Mr. GEORGE
TERRELL, always a little inclined to
look upon the black side of things, was
apprehensive about the spread of Bol-
shevism in this country. Not so Lord
HENRY BENTINCK, who genially ex-
ploded with “Is not Bolshevism in this
country a pure bogey?” Not quite that,
perhaps; but I gathered that in Mr.
Box AR LAw's opinion it hasn't a ghost
of a chance.
Great cheers from the Wee Frees
greeted the advent of Mr. A. E. NEw-
Bould, the victor of West Leyton,
whose defeat of the Coalition candidate
has increased the size of their party by
something like four per cent. As the
new Member is understood to be con-
nected with the film business his
colleagues are hoping that they will
soon have Ministers on the “movies.”
We know on high authority that evil
communications corrupt good manners.
Sir ERIC GEDDEs goes further and be-
lieves that they corrupt everything.
That was the text of his capital speech
on the second reading of the Trans-
portation Bill. Dispensing on this
occasion with his usual typescript, he
discoursed at large for an hour and
a-half on the paralytic condition of our
railways, roads, canals and docks.
We all had our pleasant morning
dreams, he said, but they usually dis-
appeared after we had had our cold
bath; and the country, which was no
longer rich, but poor, must take its
douche. His own dream is of a beau-
tifully centralised control, directing all
our traffic agencies (save tramways and

shipping) into the most convenient
channels; and he won't be happy till
he gets it. But judging by some of
the speeches that followed he too may
have a frigid disillusionment when the
Bill comes up against the “interests”
in Cornmittee. Mr. T. P. O'CoNNor,
on bellaſſ of Liverpool, described it as
the product of “an old bureaucracy and
a young Parliamentarian,” and Mr.
RENWICK declared that, if it passed,
the Manchester Ship Canal would be
“between the devil and the deep sea,”
surely an uncalled-for attack on Cot-
tonopolis.
Upon the adjournment, Col. CLAUDE
LowTHER again raised the question of
the payment of German indemnities,
and Mr. BonAR LAw again declared
that the policy of the Government was
to demand the largest amount that
Germany could pay, but not to demand
what we knew she couldn't pay. It
would have saved him a lot of trouble
if at the General Election the Govern-
ment spokesmen had insisted as much
upon the second half of the policy as
they did upon the first.
Tuesday, March 18th.-GILBERT's
fanciful description of the “most sus-
ceptible Chancellor” is justified by the
way in which the present occupant of
the Woolsack and his predecessors vie
with one another in the endeavour to
secure the favour of the fair sex. To-
day it was Lord HALDANE's turn to
oblige, and he brought in a Bill to
enable Scotswomen to become Advo-
cates and Law Agents. Lord HALS-
BURY's contribution to the work of

feminine emancipation has not yet been
announced. The rumour that a depu-
tation of ladies recently approached
him with a proposal that they should
be eligible for judicial office—“Scarlet
and ermine are so becoming"—and
that he put them off with the old joke
about there being “enough old women
on the Bench already" is, of course,
apocryphal.
Not infrequently in the official reports
of the Lords' debates a speech begins
thus: “Lord (who was indis-
tinctly heard).” The Commons' report
might well adopt this salutary practice
as a warning to Members who persist-
ently mumble, or who address their
remarks to the body of the House in-
stead of to the SPEAKER. Ministers
are the worst offenders. One of them
was asked this afternoon, for example,
whether the Judicial Adviser to the
SULTAN had discouraged the use of the
English language in the Egyptian
Courts, but all we could hear of the
sotto voce conversation between him
and his interrogator was that “er—er
—language—er—had—been—er—er—
misunderstood.”
Some savages, travellers tell us, are
unable to count beyond five. Some
Ministers, on the other hand, show an
inability to reckon except in millions.
Mr. CHURCHILL, when asked how many
soldiers were not receiving the recent
increase of pay, remarked casually that
the numbers were “not so very great
—half-a-million would cover them.”
Happily these “sloppy statistics” (to
recall a phrase used by Mr. Asquith

during the Tariff Reform controversy)
do not appeal to the FooD - CoN-
TRolleR. He, being invited to say
whether the Government had made “ap-
proximately £2,400,000” by the charge
on cattle-sales, replied that the amount
was “approximately " £3,449,939; and
we felt that he was cut to the heart at
not being able to give the odd shillings
and pence.
The renewed debate on the Trans-
portation Bill revealed a good deal of
opposition. Roadmen thought it an
excellent project for railways; railway-
men were all in favour of its being
applied to docks; and dockmen had
no objection to its being tried on the
roads. But none of them wanted it
for his own particular interest. Sir
Edward CARson's objections were both
particular and general. Belfast would
be ruined if its port were controlled
by “a nest of politicians” in Dublin,
but apart from that he doubted whe-
ther the promised economies would be
realised in any direction. Ministers
were “gluttons for centralisation,” and
would, he prophesied, incur, the usual
fate of gluttons, acute indigestion.
Mr. BonAR LAw, while admitting that
he himself would not have voted for
the Bill five years ago, declared that
the War had made it essential. That
seemed to be the general opinion, for
the second reading was agreed to with-
out a division.
Wednesday, March 19th. — Lord
MALMESBURY, who has lately been the
victim of a burglary, attributed it to
housebreakers having been demobilised
before policemen. Whether this was
done on the ground that they conducted
“one man businesses,” or because some-
one in Whitehall assumed that the
wielders of the centre-bit must be
“pivotal,” I do not know, but an Army
Order requiring Commanding Officers
to keep the balance even between crim-
inals and coppers seems to be urgently
needed.
The Bishops were delighted to hear
from Lord ERNLE that his department
includes a Hop-Controller, and are
going to ask him to turn his attention
to the Jazz.
Museums could not be opened just
yet, said Lord STANMORE, because some
eight thousand officials of various de-
partments were at present lodged in
these buildings. To judge by the
comments of the public Press, there
are several hundreds more who ought
to be kept there.
Thursday, March 20th.-Lord WIN-
TERTON wanted to know what the Gov-
ernment was doing to counteract Mr.
BERNARD SHAw's alleged anti-British
propaganda in the United States. Mr.
CECIL HARMsworth thought Professor
OMAN's recent memorandum would
prove a sufficient counterblast. He
had, however, no objection to adding
Mr. SHAw's latest pamphlet to “the
large budget of Shavian literature"
already at the Foreign Office, where, it
is said, the clerks on night-duty like to
beguile their leisure with light fiction.
Late in the evening Mr. BonAR LAw
announced the intentions of the Govern-
ment with regard to the coal industry.
It would adopt Mr. Justice SANKEY's
report, giving the men a large portion
of their demands. If the miners still
persisted in striking—well, the State
would strike too, with all its might;
otherwise there was an end of govern-
ment in this country. The cheers which
greeted this statement seriously an-

DRAMATISTS TO THE RESCUE.
IN view of the theory developed by
the Ministry of Reconstruction's Sub-
Committee on Organisation and Con-
ditions of Domestic Service, that “the
attitude adopted by the Press and
the Stage is usually an unfortunate
one, as servants are frequently repre-
sented as comic or flippant characters,
and are held up to ridicule,” a meeting
of our leading dramatists was hastily
convened last evening by Lady HEAD-
FoRT (who, it will be remembered, is
all for calling her maids “Home-birds”)
to engage their sympathetic co-opera-
tion in aid of mistresses, housekeepers
and employers generally. What the
stage has taken away the stage must
give back: that is Lady HEADFort's
contention. Not that the domestic pro-
blem will even then be settled; there will
probably still be difficulty in persuading
W.A.A.C.s and Land Women and Mu-
nitioners who have tasted blood to
descend below stairs again; but per-
haps a little help will be forthcoming.
Hence this influential gathering.
Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT, who presided,
said that the domestic problem was
one of great seriousness. Personally
he rarely descended to the servants'
hall, but he did not pretend to be un-
aware of the usefulness of such regions
and of our dependence upon them.
There must be give and take. If the
stage had been guilty of too much
levity in its portraiture of domestic
servants, then, in the interests of all
of us, it must make what our lively
neighbours call the amende honorable.
Sir JAMES BARRIE said that no one
could hold him personally to blame.
His plays had always exhibited domes-
tic servants in a most favourable light.
Not only was a butler the hero of The
Admirable Crichton, a maidservant the
heroine of A Kiss for Cinderella and a
charwoman the heroine of The Old
Lady Shows Her Medals, but the actual
authorship of Peter Pan was given to
the smallest nursemaid on record.
Mr.SoMERSET MAUGHAM also claimed
to be on the side of the home-birds.
Had he not in Smith written a part of
strong parlour-maid interest for Miss
MARIE LöHR 2
Mr. G. B. SHAw said that there was
no need for the meeting at all, because
he was just putting the finishing touches
to a witty drama which would settle the .
whole question. In this play, which,
he could tell them on the best authority
in the world, his own, was a work of
surpassing genius, the Irish Question,
which had baffled statesmen and philo-
sophers for centuries, is settled once
and for all by the wisdom and presence
of mind of a Kerry kitchenmaid.

PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Chairman said that perhaps the
meeting might as well proceed with its
discussion, since there was always the
possibility that the run of Mr. SHAw's
play might not equal that of his last,
which, he understood, had just been
produced in New York and had come
off almost at once.
Mr. HENRY ARTHUR Jon E8 said that
if any branch of art could effect social
transformations it was the drama.
Personally he looked upon the stage as
only one degree less powerful than the
Senate and vastly more serious than
the Church. Its first duty was to in-
struct, elevate and reform ; to amuse
was never its true function. Hence, if
the dramatists of the country cared to
servant shortage, the matter would be
quickly settled. But only, added the
speaker with extreme gravity, if the
as revue were first gagged and bound.
though he had given up revue writing
in favour of transforming farcical plays,
he felt that he might make an appeal
to the authors of revue (who often ex-
ceeded the audience in number) to join
in this very laudable campaign. Speak-
ing as one of the two-and-twenty
Hippodromios, although no longer in
that capacity, he would appeal to his
successors to paint life below stairs in
such resplendent hues that the desire
instantly to take service would be im-
planted in every female bosom.
Mr. ALFRED SUTRo, speaking at the
moment not so much as a dramatist
as a man without a cook, said that he
the gentleman who had just sat down.
* Sir ARTHUR WING PINERo said that
economy. But it was useless unless
The dramatist did not stand alone. So
long as the ordinary stage idea of a
parlourmaid was a saucy nymph with
a feather brush and very short skirts,
so long would dramatists strive in vain
to exalt her calling. He was prepared
to do his best, but feared that the actors'
traditions would prove too strong.
Mr. WALTER MELVILLE said that he
hoped nothing would be done to tamper
with such traditions as Sir ARTHUR
complained of. It was the duty of
a stage servant to begin plays and to
be funny. The curtain of a farce should
rise on a butler and a parlourmaid
remarking on the fact that master was
suspiciously late last night; and the
butler should be amorous, bibulous and
take up the task of remedying the
authors of the pernicious rubbish known
Mr. MAx PEMBERTON said that, al-
agreed heartily with the sentiments of
he was always willing to help worthy
causes and was as ready to write a play
for the object in view as, not long since,
he had been to write one to encourage
the company chosen would co-operate.

UNLEss something is done for Higgins
without delay the nation must prepare
to face a tremendous rise in the rate of
mortality among house-agents.
Soon after he came back from the
War he began to adopt a threatening
attitude (as the police-court witnesses
say) towards these gentlemen. Recently
he has gone beyond the threatening
stage. If rumour can be trusted, he
has thrown at least six of them through
their office windows. He has taken
a dislike to the whole tribe. They are,
in his opinion, a gang of criminals for
whom no punishment could be too
severe, because they impose upon the
public in general and Higgins in parti-
cular, by continuing in business as if

are wasting your time in looking for
an empty dwelling. Take my advice.
Choose one that is occupied, any one
you fancy, and empty it.”
At this point he interpolated an offen-
sive expression with which I was not
familiar before I joined the army, but
I overlooked that also... -
“You think it is impossible, but you
are wrong,” I told him. “This scheme

veloped a craving for a
residence built of bricks
and mortar.

“I have,” he answer-
ed; “and when I had

was delighted to have
his theory confirmed.
He wants more details

furnish evidence. What
for, you ask? Well,
you see, he happens to
l, find it for him, and, since he con-
siders the whole thing from the purely
personal point of view, their excuses
for failing to do so are of no avail. The
fact that half a million other people
want houses is nothing to him. He
ignores it. He believes that the house-
agentry of the country has hatched a
igantic conspiracy to keep him, Hig-
gins, out of a home.
I have done my best to put him out
of his misery. After seeing the poor
wretch wear himself (and his boots)
out in useless journeyings to and from
the places where house-agents pretend
to work I thought of a scheme—not
strictly original—for obtaining a house
and presented it to him without hope
of reward.

said.

had suffered, I took no notice of the

secret. This is an age of suggestion.
Doctors are curing patients by sugges-

required. Having selected the house
you pay a call and lay ground-bait, so
to speak. You tell the tenant you are
interested in the place because you
happen to know that at one time it was

of some mysterious tragedy that you
say has occurred there, and generally

THE strange case of the halibut and

the return of normal conditions in the

Gullame, N.B.
DEAR SIR,-One of the most striking
results of the War has been its effect
on the mentality of birds and animals
and even fishes. The papers have lately
contained accounts of a halibut which
swallowed a cormorant and survived
the exploit only to fall a victim to the
wiles of a North Sea fisherman. As the
cormorant is generally regarded to be
the dermier cri in voracity, the incident
illustrates the old saying of the biter
bit. As a rule birds of prey have the
upper hand in their contests with the

finny denizens of the deep. But the
triumph of the halibut is not altogether
unprecedented. I remember, when I
was cruising in the China Seas in the
year 1854, witnessing a combat between
a dolphin and a Bombay duck, in which
the latter came off second-best. And
some thirty years later, during a yacht-
ing excursion off the Scilly Isles, I saw
an even more remarkable duel between
a porbeagle—as the Cornish people call
the mackerel-shark—and a pipit, in
which, strange to relate, the bird came
off victorious.
Delieve me to be, Sir,
Yours truthfully,

Tara, Diddlebury.
DEAR SIR,-When I was an under-
graduate at Cambridge in the 'sixties
a “Limerick” was current which began
as follows:—
“There was an adventurous sole .
Which swallowed an albatross whole.”
Unfortunately I cannot remember the
conclusion of the stanza, nor am I able
to state whether it was founded on fact
or was merely an ebullition of lyrical
fancy. In the latter case the lines are
a striking instance of the prophetic
power of minstrelsy, and justify the use
of the word “vates,” or seer, as applied
to poets by the ancient Romans.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Yours faithfully,
SEPTIMUS Bowl.ONG.
Ičougemont Villa, Crookhaven.
DEAR SIR,-The halibut-cormorant
episode has attracted undue attention,
since many similar but far more extra-
ordinary incidents have occurred during
the War, but have passed unrecorded
owing to the claims of Bellona. I will
confine myself to one which was wit-
nessed by my daughter Anna in course
of bathing at Sheringham in August,
1917. While swimming under water she
collided with a middle-sized sea-serpent,
which was evidently in difficulties and
made its way to the beach, where it
expired. The post-mortem, which was
conducted by Professor Darcy John-
son, F.R.S., revealed that the serpent
had been choked by a gigantic goose-
berry, which had formed part of the
cargo of a Greenland tramp torpedoed
by an enemy submarine. The serpent
was actually being stuffed when a bomb
dropped by a Zeppelin blew it into
infinitesimal smithereens, to the pro-
found disappointment of the Professor
and my daughter Anna, who has never
been quite the same woman since.
Permit me to subscribe myself
Yours faithfully,
ALEXANDER NIAs.
Steep Hill, Cramlington.
DEAR SIR,-There is nothing sur-
prising in the story of a halibut de-
vouring a cormorant. As you will see
from consulting Murray, halibut means
“holy-butt" (or flat-fish), and holy
fishes are possessed of magical powers.
When I lived on the coast of Florida.
I had a tame tarpon, which could
swallow anything—croquet balls, door
scrapers—and once ate an entire cot-
tage pianoforte in half-an-hour. Here
I may add that in my travels in Turk-
estan I was attacked by a boa-con-
strictor, and, though I escaped with my
life, it proceeded to swallow the Bac-
trian camel on which I was riding.
On the following day, however, when
the boa was still in a comatose con-
dition, I killed it with a boomerang,
rescued the camel and continued my
journey without further mishap.
I am, Sir, Yours veraciously,
ANDREw MERRIMAN.

“Ay, lass,

That ye should be takin' your ain just

In the extry hours that ye've got to

she said,
“Ye micht be pittin' the bairns tae bed.”
Jock laughed. “I doot there 's some-
thin' in it ; -
I'll stairt on my duties this verra
minute.”
A week went by : Jock learnt to scrub,
He gave the bairns their Saturday tub,
He made the beds, he blacked the
grates,
He washed up saucers and cups and
plates,
He cleaned and polished, he boiled and
baked -
Till every bone in his body ached.
Around the neighbourhood rumour flew;
Soon every wife in the village knew
That Jock, when his spell in the pit
was done,
Was cook, nurse, parlourmaid rolled
into one;
And every wife she vowed that her man
Should be trained on the same super-
excellent plan.
Behold these lusty miners all
Fettered fast in domestic thrall,
Scrubbing, rubbing, baking bread,
Busy with scissors and needle and
thread,
Spreading the brats their bread and jam,
Trundling them out in the morning
pram,
Washing their pinafores clean and
white
And tucking them up in their cots at
night.
Ask me not—for I cannot tell,
I can only guess—how the end befell:
A wifely word, an angry scowl,
A bit of a grumble, a bit of a growl,
A scolding here, a squabbling there,
And here the sound of an ugly swear,
A cry of despair from the sore opprest,
A secret call to the “Miners' Rest,”
A sudden revolt from the brooms and
mats,
And a roar from a thousand throats—
“Down brats | "
* * What-striking again?" you cry,
aghast.
Nay, friend, cheer up, for the worst is
past ;
A glint of blue may be seen through
the grey—
They are asking again for an eight-hour
day.
THE DISCIPLINARIAN.
SALUTING is rapidly becoming a
thing of the past, even among British-
born soldiers. Dating from the Armis-
tice, it has lapsed more and more,
until now it is practically extinct.
Now I regard this as serious. I
have ever been a stickler for discipline,
and consequently I dislike it when men
pass by—not, like the Levite, on the
other side—but close to me without so
much as a click of the eyeballs.
So I decided that I as a discipli-
narian would make a stand against it;
I would keep my eyes open for any
particularly flagrant case. When I
found it I intended to let myself go.
I promised myself an agreeable ten
minutes—or longer, if I got properly
worked up.
My chance came the other day. I
was strolling down Regent Street when
three N.C.O.'s, including a sergeant,
passed me. They did not salute. I
might have been a civilian for all the
notice they took of me. Ha! my hour
had come.
Turning, I hastened after them.
“Sergeant, a word.” - -
They stopped and the Sergeant asked
if I was speaking to him.
“Have you ever heard of the little
word 'Sir,' Sergeant?” I asked severely.
“Evidently not. However I pass over
that. But a moment ago you went
by me without saluting. Deliberately—
inexcusably. I was as close to you as
I am now.”
“But how—” began the Sergeant.
“Not a word,” I cut him short.
“Not a word. You know perfectly
well that you have neglected your duty
grossly. Now tell me. Is it your
own idea to drop saluting, or has Mr.
CHURCHILL had a word in your ear?”
(Sarcasm is my strong point.)
“But look here ” said the Ser-
geant, rather red in the face.
“Do not interrupt,” I thundered,
warming to my work. “How, I ask,
do you expect the ordinary soldier
to salute when you slink past officers
—you, who ought to be a shining
example 2 Now I am going to
report—"
Something in the Sergeant's eye,
which seemed to be travelling over my
person generally, made me suddenly
glance down at myself, and it was
then that, horror-struck, I realised that
I was wearing for the first time my new
ten-guinea suit.
As I faded away the Sergeant clicked
his heels and saluted smartly,
The Struggle for Life.

girl, for farm butter, eggs, jam."—The Lady.

Infuriated Italian (who has recently purchased a British Army horse). “FAIR words Did I SPEAK HIM, SAYING, ‘PEDRO, AVANTI
PIANIssIMO,' AND–BEHOLD!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Within The Rim (CoLLINs) is, I suppose, the last of the
posthumous volumes of Mr. HENRY JAMEs. It is a short
book, produced with the beauty that I have already grown
to associate with the imprint of its publishers, and con-
taining five occasional pieces. Of these the first, which
gives its title to the whole, is the most considerable; an
essay of very moving poignancy, telling the emotion of the
writer during the earliest months of the War, in “the most
beautiful English summer conceivable,” months that he
“was to spend so much of in looking over from the old
rampart of a little high-perched Sussex town at the bright
blue streak of the Channel . . . . and staring at the bright
mystery beyond the rim of the farthest opaline reach.” In
the thoughts to which HENRY JAMEs here gives expression
one may find much of the love and sympathy for this
country that subsequently led to that assumption of British
citizenship which he intended as their demonstration to
the world. Of interest also in this same paper is the
revelation of a mind that knew already by a personal
experience (of the American Civil War) “what immensities
our affair would carry in its bosom—a knowledge that
flattered me by its hint of immunity from illusion.” . I
would not be understood that this is a volume for the
casual reader, or even for one desirous of making a first
acquaintance with the Master, since much of it exemplifies
not only the beauty but the perplexities of his later
style; but it is certainly one which his disciples will
not willingly be without.
Notebooks of a Spinster Lady (CASSELL) is smallish talk
about biggish wigs of the Victorian era, but not on that
sole account to be condemned. Perhaps rather wholesome
as showing how little distant we are from an age of govern-
ment of the people by superior people for superior people.
The notebooks cover the years 1878-1903, but the anecdotes
have a much wider range, are often indeed of a venerable
antiquity. The lady of the notebooks was not, I fancy, of
a critical temper, and versions not too credible of well-known
contes figure in her quiet kindly pages. There are moreover
stories which I should not hesitate to describe as of an
appalling banality if they were not concerned with such
very nice people. On the whole I don't think it quite fair
to the spinster lady to have published her notes. They
may well have been painstaking jottings to provide material
for polite conversation and have sounded much better than
they read in cold print. For myself the real heroine of the
book is Maria, the poet's wife, who, on being waked and
adjured by her spouse to get up and strike a light for that
he had just thought of a good word, replied in un-Victorian
mood, “Get up yourself! I have just thought of a bad one.”
Love—on Leave (PEARSoN) is the sufficiently expressive
title that Miss JEssie Pope has chosen for a small book of
little courtship tales. You never saw a volume of its size
more packed with love, which is shown leaping walls, laugh-
ing at locksmiths and generally making the world go round
in its proverbial fashion. The pace of the revolutions may
be found a little disconcerting. You will perhaps be in-
clined to amend the title and call the collection “Love on
Short Leave,” to mark the regularity with which the respec-
tive heroes and heroines fall into each others' arms at the
end of every dozen pages or so. As a matter of fact, the
incident that is to my mind the best of the bunch is an

exception to this rule of osculation—a happily imagined little
comedy of a young wife who thought to avoid the visit of
a tiresome sister-in-law by betaking herself for the night
to the branches of a spreading beech. Whether in actual
life this is a probable course of conduct need not exercise
your mind; at least not enough to prevent your enjoyment
of her arboreal adventure, which comes, as I say, with the
more freshness as a break in what might else be a surfeit
of proposals. In effect, a gallant little florin's worth of
fiançailles; though, if you wish to avoid feeling like a
matrimonial agency, you will be well-advised to take it by
instalments rather than in bulk.
Among the pacific warriors in the great 1914-18 struggle
there is probably none who did better work, often under
conditions of the gravest peril, than Mr. G. M. TREvelyAN
become national scoutmasters in charge of national camps.”
You may, if you are on the look-out for it, find much that
will seem fantastic in Mr. HARGRAVE's ideas; his appeal,
however, is not to those of us who, even in a case of great
national urgency, cannot get away from the tyranny of
convention. Intrinsically his idea is sound, and I plead
with all my heart for a fair consideration of his schemes
and for help in their development.
Mr. REX BEACH is one of the few prolific writers whose
stories increase in power as they increase in number, and
this though they are essentially novels of action rather
than novels of thought Of his latest effort, The Winds of
Chance (HopDER AND Stoughton), one may say that there is
not a tedious page in it. The scene is laid in Yukon, a very
vortex of life and colour and excitement in fiction, whatever
for the Red Cross in Italy. Dis- -
qualified both by age and health
from joining the army of attack,
he threw himself into the task
—a labour of love—of tending
the sick and wounded of that
country which he knows so
well and of whose greatest
modern hero he is the classic
biographer. That the eulogist
of GARIBALDI should hasten
to the succour of Italian
soldiers was fitting, and how
well he performed the task the
records of the Villa Trental
Hospital, near Udine, and of 3
the ambulance drivers under
his command, abundantly tell.
The story of this beneficent
campaign and of much besides
is told with too much modesty
by Mr. TREvelyAN himself, in
a book entitled Scenes from
Italy's War(JAck), which gives
a series of the vividest im-
pressions of the Italian effort,
and is remarkable for the best
analysis that I have yet seen --- --~~~ ---
of the causes that led to the * t
disaster of Caporetto. The *…
pages in which Mr.TreveryAN
paints the portrait of a typical
Italian soldier, home sick and
perplexed, are likely to be

Man. “WELL, SIR, I 'ave; But I didn't LIKE To correct You.”
Tiit may seem to the actual in-
habitants. The true hero of
the story, Napoleon Doret, the
French voyageur, wins his
heart's desire in the end and
we breathe a sigh of relief.
The other hero is left the ac-
cepted swain of the daughter
of the Colonel of the North-
- West Mounted Police at Daw-
son, and this we find a little
hard to swallow, seeing what
shady, not to say immoral,
company, male and female, he
had just been basking in. He
is a weak creature and cer-
tainly should have married
the Countess Courteau, an
Amazonian lady, who would
have kept him in order. But
that is to be fastidious. The
story is crisp and vivid, and,
anyway, those ancient pro-
spectors, Tom Linton and
Jerry McQuirk, are worth
twice the money.
º Mr. Punch has great plea-
º sure in commending to his
readers two volumes of verse
—Rhymes of the Red Ensign
(Hodder AND Stoughton), by
|Miss C. Fox SMITH, and The
Poets in Picardy (MURRAY),
borrowed by many more pretentious historians of the War
for years to come.
Mr. John HARGRAVE, the author and illustrator of The
}reat War Brings It Home (CoNSTABLE) has already a
wide reputation in the world of Scouts, gained not only by
his enthusiasm but by his profound knowledge of scout-
craft. Here he tells us very plainly that the War has
brought home to us the fact that, if we are to make good
our losses in the ranks of the young and the fit, we have
got to give our children a better chance of living healthy,
wholesome lives. He urges the need of more outdoor
education and as many open-air camps as possible, and
shows that, if we are to carry out such a scheme as he lays
in detail before us, scoutmasters and still more scoutmasters
are wanted. With reason he complains that none of these
good fellows is paid one halfpenny, and that nearly all of
them are young men who have to get a living. “Offer
...them," he says, “a living wage and how gladly would they

I THOUGHT the cruel wound was whole
Which left my inside so dyspeptic;
That Time had salved this tortured soul,
Time and Oblivion's antiseptic;
That thirty years (the period since
You showed a preference for Another)
Had fairly schooled me not to wince
At being treated like a brother.
When last I saw the shape I wooed
In coils of adipose embedded,
Fondling its eldest offspring's brood
(The image of the Thing you wedded), .
I placed my hand upon the seat
Of those affections you had riven
And gathered from its steady beat
That your offence had been forgiven.
And now, to my surprise and pain,
Long past the stage of convalescence,
The wound has broken out again
With symptoms of pronounced putrescence;
And, from the spot where once was laid
Your likeness treasured in a locket,
The trouble threatens to invade
A tenderer place—my trousers pocket.

A grievous super-tax they'd lay

MIXED BIOGRAPHY.
THE achievement of a certain paper
in identifying the late Mr. G. W. E.
RUssell, with Mr. GEORGE RUssf:LL
(“AE"), the Irish poet, is likely to en-
courage imitation. The following first
attempts have come under our notice:—
It is not generally known that the
Foreign SECRETARY began life in a
Sheffield steel factory. By unremit-
ting toil he became Master Cutler, hav-
ing first served an apprenticeship as
Chief Secretary for Ireland. The in-
clusion of Mr. ARTHUR BALFour in
the Coal Commission was particularly
happy, and no one will grudge him his
well-earned title of Lord BALFour of
BURLEIGH.
Sir ANTHoNY HoPE HAwkINs, better
known as Mr. Justice HAwRINs, like
his brother judge, Mr. Justice GILBERT
PARKER, combines a profound know-
ledge of law with a fine literary gift.
His well-known treatise on Habeas
Corpus, entitled The Prisoner of Zenda,
will be familiar to all students.
During the absence of the gallant
Colonel John WARD at the Front, we
understand that Mrs. WARD has been
seeing through the Press a new story,
which is a return to the earlier manner
of her Robert Elsmere.
Sir GEORGE AskwitH, as he will still
be remembered long after his elevation
to the peerage, first struck the public
imagination by his advice to therailway-
men, who, when they asked what would
happen if they persisted in striking,
received the answer, “Wait and see.”
London is becoming herself again.
Among well-known persons noticed
about yesterday were Mr. McKENNA,
whose retirement from office presum-
ably gives him more leisure for that
sequel to Sonia for which we are all
waiting; Mr. J. W. H. T. Douglas,
Cricket Specialist of The Star; Sir
ERNEST SHACKLETON, on his way to his
work at the Ministry of Labour; and
Sir HARRY JohnsoN, the famous African
pugilist.
THE BETTER PART.

THE TRAGEDY OF THE SUPER-PATRIOT.
If you happen to be standing upon
the platform of Ealing Common station
at about nine o'clock on a week-day
morning you will see a poor shrunken
figure with a hunted expression upon
his face come creeping down the stairs.
And as the train comes in he will slink
into a carriage and hide himself behind
his newspaper and great tears will
come into his eyes as he reads the
correspondence column and thinks of
the days when his own letters used to
be published over the signatures of
“Volunteer,” “Patriot,” or “Special
Constable of Two Years' Service.” And
this sorry figure is Mr. Coaster, whose
patriotism proved his undoing.
Before he lived in Ealing he had a
little cottage at Ramstairs, on the
Kentish coast. Every morning he
would travel up to the City, and every
evening he would return to Ramstairs,
not to the carpet slippers and the com-
forts of home, but to the brassard and
the rigorous routine of the drill-hall.
And the little drill-hall was filled
with the noise of war as the Men of
Kent marched hither and thither,
lāshed by the caustic tongue of the
Territorial sergeant, with all the en-
thusiasm of the early Saxons who
flocked to HARold's standard in order
to repel the Danes.
For Mr. Coaster was as great a
patriot as any of the old Saxons. In a
burst of enthusiasm he joined the
Special Constables; in an explosion of
wrath, following the bombardment of
Scarborough, he enlisted in the Kentish
Fencibles, and in a wave of self-sacrifice
he enrolled himself in the Old Veterans'
Fire Brigade. And he had badges
upon each lapel of his coat and several
dotted all over his waistcoat.
He belonged to a noble company of
patriots. All true Men of Kent who
were past the fighting age joined one
or other of these institutions, but luckily
not more than one.
On a certain fatal night a general
alarm was given. In due course a
notification of it was conveyed to Ram-
stairs, and instantaneously the mem-
bers of the Special Constabulary, the
Kentish Fencibles and the Veterans'
Fire Brigade were summoned from
their beds. Then did Mr. Coaster
realise his terrible position. Since he
belonged to all three, to which of them
After some
agonising moments of doubt he hung
up his three types of headgear upon
the hat-stand and, shutting his eyes,
he twirled himself round twice and
made a grab at them. His hand touched
the helmet of the Veterans' Fire Bri-
gadé. Fate had decided. Seizing his

fireman's axe he rushed off down the
street.
The result of this was inevitable. He
was dismissed with ignominy from the
Special Constables and was condemned
to death, with a recommendation to
mercy, by a court-martial of the
Kentish Fencibles. His old friends
among the Men of Kent cut him dead;
the tradesmen of his platoon refused to
serve him. He had to leave Ramstairs
and he retired to Ealing. The catas-
trophe ruined his health. But he still
gets a little solace when, as he wipes
the tears from his eyes after reading the
correspondence column of his penny
paper, he sees upon his waistcoat the
crossed axes surmounted by a fire
bucket, the emblem of the Veterans'
Fire Brigade.

MEN ARE BEING DEMOBILISED FASTER THAN OFFICERS.
“CLEAR THE GALLERIES.”
IN response to the growth of dis-
satisfaction at the continued closing of
certain picture galleries and museums,
either wholly or in part, the Govern-
ment has appointed a special commis-
sion to investigate the matter, under the
presidency of Sir Tite Barnacle (fifth
baronet). A report of the first session
follows, during which the cases for the
public and culture, and for the Govern-
ment as against both, were fully stated.
The first witness was Lord HARCOURT,
who said that he had done all he could,
both in the House of Lords and in the
columns of The Times, where, he was
glad to say, large type was given him,
to bring the Government to its senses
on this matter. So long as the War
was on, he and his fellow-critics had
refrained from interfering. But now
that it was over they demanded that
the museums and galleries should be
cleared at once of flappers and type-
writers and thrown open again to their
rightful users, the public.
Sir Buffer Stayte, K.C.B., O.B.E.,
speaking for his own Government de-
partment, said that, although in a
manner of speaking the War was over,
it was also not over. There was a heri-
tage of trouble which required endless
attention, and the best place to attend
to it was in the museums and galleries.
Experience had taught them that build-
ings filled with works of art acquired
by the nation, either by purchase or
gift, for the nation, and held as a
national trust, were the most suitable
places in which a clerical staff could
perform clerical duties.
Lord HARcourt begged to suggest
that such a disregard of a national
trust was a treachery. -
Sir Buffer Stayte said that, although
in ordinary times such might be the
case, it was not so in war-time or
while the Defence of the Realm Act
was in force. Under Dora's sanction
all black was white. Personally he had
every belief in the efficiency of the staffs
now employed in the various public
galleries and museums. He had seen
them arrive late and leave early—he
meant arrive early and leave late—and
could not sufficiently admire their wil-
lingness to put up with the dismal sur-
roundings of pictures and curiosities.
Mr. Robert WITT, one of the Trus-
tees of the National Gallery, said that
it was inconceivable to him as a busi-
ness man that even if so many clerks
should still be required there was not
a more reasonable place for them than
Trafalgar Square.
Sir Thomas Tannin, K.B.E., speak-
ing for his own Government depart-
ment, said that it was evident that
Mr. WITT did not fully realise the posi-
tion. These were historic and abnormal
times and abnormal measures were
necessary. We thought in high num-
bers, and therefore high numbers of
clerks were needed. Trafalgar Square
was as conveniently central a spot as
could be found; hence their presence
there. It had also been pointed out by
the chiefs of the Government Clerks'
Tea Advisory Board that the facilities
for obtaining more water for boiling
were unusual on account of the prox-
imity of the two great fountains. If
anybody could suggest a better place
for the accommodation of all ºthese
young ladies he would be glad to know
of it. The only suggestion yet made
had reference to buildings which, hav-
ing been designed for office work, were
obviously unsuitable. Another reason
for keeping them on was their cost.
Economy in one direction might lead
to economy in another, and the whole
fabric of the new bureaucracy would
be threatened. It was therefore useless
to hope for any early change.
Sir SIDNEY LEE pointed out that,
owing to the occupation of a large
part of the National Gallery, all the
National Portrait Gallery, all the Tate
Gallery, and all Hertford House, where
the Wallace Collection is, by Govern-
ment clerks, these national institutions
were not open to our soldiers from the
Dominions and the provinces, who
might never again have the opportunity
of refreshing their eyes by gazing upon
some of our most beautiful possessions.
In their interest alone he pleaded for
the rapid conversion of the buildings
to their proper ends.
Sir Yutely Taryan, K.C.V.O., speaking
for his own Government Department,
said that in his opinion a great deal of

PUNCH, OR
nonsense was talked about art, both its
educational value and its power of
giving pleasure. Speaking for himself,
even in normal times, he would rather
see a picture gallery given up to living
clerks than to dead canvases. If he
had his way there should be no pictures
but those that stimulated people to
greater activity. He had, for example,
never seen any beauty in WHISTLER's
portrait of his (WHISTLER's) mother
until it was reproduced as a War-
savings poster, with words scrawled
across it. A few of the placards which
American business men pinned up in
their offices, such as, “To Hell with
Yesterday,” were better than all the
Old Masters. .
Continuing, Sir Yutely said that he
could not permit himself to accept the
view that any privation was being suf-
fered by our brave lads from overseas.
From conversations that he had had
with some of them he found that the
only pictures that they knew anything
of or cared about were those in the
cinemas. From his own recollections
of his only visit to the National Gallery
some years ago he should say that these
noble fellows were better outside that
place than in. One painting that he
saw there was so scandalous in its
nudity that he blushed even now when
he thought of it. Better far that our
defenders from the Dominions should
continue to walk up and down the
Strand.
On the motion of the Chairman, who
said that he thought the case for the
Government and the continued closing
of the galleries and museums had been
adequately made out, the Commission
adjourned sine die, and Lord HARcourt,
Sir SIDNEY LEE and Mr. WITT were
left sharpening their pens. -
THE ARMY ORACLE.
I CANNOT conceal from myself that I
am a great acquisition to the Army of
Occupation. My knowledge of the
language being far and away superior
to that of any other British officer for
miles around, I am looked upon by the
natives as a sort of high military
authority in whom they may have
the privilege and the pleasure of con-
fiding all their troubles. According to
the intensity of their various desires
I am addressed crescendo as “Herr
Ober-Leutenant,” or “Herr Haupt-
mann,” or “Herr Majeur,” or “Herr
Commandant.” They always approach
me in a becomingly servile attitude—
cap or hat in hand—and await with
obvious tension my weighty pronounce-
ments. They hide round corners and
wait behind doors or down narrow
passages until I come past, and then
they spring out on me.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUD LARKS.
THE Visiting Brigadier cracked a
walnut and glanced towards the
General. “I wonder if you remember
a French interpreter by the name of
de Blavincourt, Sir 2 He was with
you once, I believe.” -
The A.P.M. across the way paused
in the act of tapping a cigarette on his
case. “Little gunner man, wore red
plush bags and a blue velvet hat?
Yes, up in the salient in '17.”
The General puffed three perfect
smoke rings towards the chandelier
(an accomplishment he had acquired
thirty-five years previously at the
“Shop” and was still proud of) and
smiled. “De Blavincourt 2 why, yes,
I remember him. He knew more
about cooking than all the chefs in
Europe and taught my poisoner to
make rations taste like food. Of course
I remember him. Why?”
“Because he came my way just at
the end of the War and had rather a
curious adventure,” said the Brigadier,
stirring his coffee. “I thought you
might be interested.”
“I am,” the General replied. “What
happened ?”
The Brigadier cleared his throat.
“We were in front of Tournai at the
time, scrapping our way from house to
house through Faubourg de Lille, the
city's western suburb. My Brigade
Major stumped into H.Q. one afternoon
looking pretty grim. “We'd best move
out of here, Sir," said he, ‘before we're
waſted.'
“‘What's the matter now 2' I asked.
“‘That unutterable little fool de Blav-
incourt has walked into Germany with
a large scale-map in his hand, showing
every H.Q. mess and billet.' He tapped
a despatch from the forward battalion.
“De Blavincourt, it appeared, had
been at work all the morning evacuating
unfortunate civilians from the cellars.
At noon or thereabouts he sidled along
the wall, past a Lewis gun detachment
that was holding the street. The cor-
poral shouted a warning, but de Blav-
incourt sidled on, saying that he was
only going to the first house round the
corner to rescue some old women he
heard were in it. And that was the
last of him. Seeing that the Bosch
opened fire from the said house seven
minutes later his fate was obvious.
“It was also obvious what our fate
would be if we continued in those
marked billets, so we moved out, bag
and baggage, into a sunken road near
by and spent the night there in the
rain and muck, and were most uncom-
fortable. What puzzled us rather was
that the Hun did not shell our old
billets that night—that is, nothing out
of the ordinary. “But that's only his
cunning,' we consoled ourselves; “he
knows we know he knows, and he's
trying to lure us back. Ah, no, old
friend.' -
“So we camped miserably on in that
sunken sewer. He dropped a lucky
one through a barn the same afternoon
and lobbed a few wides over during the
next night, but again nothing out of
the ordinary. º
“We were more and more puzzled.
Then, just about breakfast-time on the
second morning, in walks de Blavincourt
himself, green as to the complexion
and wounded in the arm, but otherwise
intact. I leapt upon him, snarling,
‘Where's that map?'
“‘I got 'im, Sir," he gulped, “safe'
(gulp). -
“This was his story. He had re-
membered the corporal shouting some-
thing, but so intent on his work was he
that he hardly noticed the warning
until suddenly, to his horror, he per-
ceived a party of Huns creeping out of
a passage behind him. He was cut
off They had not seen him for the
moment, so quick as thought he slipped
into the nearest house, turned into a
front room—a sort of parlour place—
and crouched there, wondering what to
do.
“He was not left wondering long, for
the Bosches followed him into that
very house. There was a small table
in one corner covered with a large
cloth. Under this de Blavincourt
dived, and not a second too soon, for
the Bosches—seven of them—followed
him into that very room and, setting
up their machine gun at the window,
commenced to pop off down the street.
Charming state of affairs for little de
Blavincourt—alone and unarmed in a
room full of bristling Huns with that
fatal map in his possession.
“Sweating all over he eased the map
out of his pocket and slowly and
silently commenced to eat it. .
“You know what those things are
like. A yard square of tough paper
backed by indestructible calico—one
might as well try to devour a child's
rag book.
“Anyhow that's what de Blavin-
court did. He ate it, and it took him
forty hours to do the trick. For forty
hours day and night he squatted under
that table, with the Huns sitting upon
and around it, and gnawed away at
that square yard of calico.
“Just before the dawn of the third
day he gulped the last corner down
and peeped out under the tablecloth.
The Bosch on guard was oiling the
lock of the machine-gun. Two more
he could hear in the kitchen clattering
pots about. The remaining four were
asleep, grotesquely sprawled over sofaş
and chairs.
“De Blavincourt determined to chance
it. He could not stop under the table ||
for ever, and even at the worst that
map, that precious map, was out of
harm's way. He crept stealthily from
his hiding-place, dealt the kneeling
Bosch a terrific kick in the small of
the back, dived headlong out of the
window and galloped down the street
towards our Lewis gunners, squealing,
‘Friend / Itos'bif ( Not 'arft – which,
in spite of his three years of inter-
preting, was all the English he could
muster at the moment. The Huns
emptied their automatics after him, but
only one bullet found the target, and
that an outer. -
“‘I weesh it vos trough my 'eart,’
he told me later, tears rolling down his
cheeks. ‘Wot more use to me my life,
hein 2 My stomach she is for ever
ruin.'” .
The General laughed. “Stout fellow
for a’ that.”
“I grant you,” said the Brigadier,
“but a fellow should be stout along
accepted lines. “To Lieutenant Felix
Marcel, Comte de Blavincourt, the
Military Cross for eating his map.’
No, Sir, it can't be done.”
The Horse-master, who was helping
himself to old tawny, nodded vigorously
and muttered “No, by Jove, it can't.”
“You speak with feeling, Coper,”
remarked the General.
“I do, Sir. I sat up the best part of
three nights last March trying to write
for official consumption the story of a
fellow who seemed to me to qualify for
the ‘Stout' class. It was a wash-out,
though ; too absurd.”
“Well, give the port a fair wind and
let's have the absurdity now,” said the
General.
The Horse-master bowed to the com-
mand. ... ."
“I was with the Fifth Army last
year when the wave swept us. We
were fairly swamped for the moment
and all nohow. One evening, retreat-
ing on my own line, I came upon some
little village—can't remember the name
just now, but you know the sort of
thing—typical Somme hamlet, a smear
of brick-dust with a big notice-board
on top, saying, ‘THIs Is LE SARs,' or
“PoziEREs,' or whatever its name was.
Anyway, in this village I found a
Divisional H.Q., four Brigade H.Q.'s,
and oddities of all sorts sitting one on
top of t'other waiting for the next
thing to happen. The next thing was
a single wounded lancer who happened
in about four in the morning with the
glad tidings that Bosch tanks were
advancing on us. Questioned further
he admitted that he had only actually

turning to me, ‘I must get the strength

ness the Hun is springing. You're an
old horse-soldier, I believe? Well, jump
on your gee and go scout the thing,
will you?'
“I scratched together a rag and
bobtail patrol of grooms and pushed off
just before daybreak. Our people had
the edge of the village manned with
every rifle they could collect. A sub-
altern lying ear to earth hailed me as I
passed. ‘It’s coming,” he called.
“A quarter of a mile further on I
could hear the roaring and rumbling
myself without lying on the road.

“Light was breaking fast, but there
were wisps and shreds of fog blowing
about which made observation exceed-
ingly difficult. Still, observation I was
out to get, so, spreading my bobbery
pack, I worked closer and closer. Sud-
denly one of my patrol shrilled, “There
y'are, Sir!” and I saw a monstrous
shape loom for a moment through a
thinning of mist, and rock onwards into
obscurity again.
“‘It’s an armoured car. I seed
wheels under it,” gasped one groom.
“More like a blasted Dreadnought,'
grunted another. ‘Cheer-o, chaps, the
'Un fleet 'as come out.' But nobody
laughed or felt like laughing; this
mysterious monster, thundering west-
ward wrapped in its barrage of fog, was
getting on our nerves.”
The Horse-master paused and care-
fully removed the long ash from his
cigar.
“Then the mists rolled up and re-
vealed what I at first took to be a
walking R.E. dump, but secondly dis-
covered to be a common ordinary

on the cab roof, railway sleepers, rivet-
ing stakes and odds and ends of
lumber tied on all over it. As I rode
up an elderly head, grimy and per-
spiring, was thrust between a couple
of duck-boards and nodded pleasantly
to me. ''Ello,' it said, ‘seen anythin'

“I was too dumbfounded to say
anything excepting that the lads were
in the next village waiting for him.
“‘Ah 'm right glad o' that,” said he:
‘been feeling a bit lonesome-like these
last two days;" adding, in case I might
not appreciate the situation, ‘These
yer Germans 'ave been after me, you
know, Sir.’ -
“I replied that my only wonder was
that they had not captured him long
since.
“‘Very nearly did once or twice,” he
admitted, and wagged his elderly head;
“but towd lass is a great one to travel
when she's sweet, an’ ah've 'ad a lot

of riveting stakes into the furnace.
“‘Oh, ah reckon we're just keepin'
ahead of 'em. Well, best be gettin'

happened just after you left for the
office. You had not been gone five
minutes when Jane came up and gave
notice. I determined to be firm and
told her she could go when she liked,
and then I marched straight off to
Mrs. Smith's Registry Office. I found
the dear old thing just as amiable and
ready to please as ever, but she told
me I must not mind if the methods of
her establishment were a bit changed.
In the old days, you know, we used to
sit in a small room and interview the
servants she wanted places for. But
now the position is reversed, and the
servants interview you and ask you
questions. I was told to go in and
see a nice-looking girl. She was not
a bit shy and, after asking me to take
a chair, began to put questions—our
income 2 your profession? what other
servants we kept 2 wages? margarine
or butter in the kitchen 2 etc.
“She seemed quite satisfied with
everything until we came to the matter
of her afternoons out. I said that two
a week and every other Sunday was
my usual custom, and that I hoped this
would prove agreeable. She snapped
me up at once and said she must have
at least four, as well as the whole of
every other Sunday.
“My heart sank, because I did not
see how we could possibly give her
all that, so I just said how sorry I
was and got up to go—in fact I was
half-way to the door—when she called
me back and said, ‘I like your face, and
perhaps for the present two afternoons
and the Sunday will be enough. If
you will wait a minute I will have
another talk to Mrs. Smith about you,'
and off she went. -
“It seemed ages before anyone came,
and then old Mrs. Smith walked in,

To brave the battle's brunt,
On Britain's shores I turned my pack

Yet bomb, shell, bullet and grenade
Made no great hit with me;
And now I'm—well, I've just been

My war gratuity.
But at the sight of civil life,
If “life” it can be called,
With all its agonising strife,

Ever survive the Peace.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 24th. — The Arch-
b's'lop of CANTERBURY sought from the
Government a clear statement of policy
regarding the repatriation of enemy
aliens, and incidentally paid a high tri-
bute to the British Press, which, we
were glad to hear, contains “nobody
who desires to fabricate baseless state-
ments.”
He was supported by Lord LAM-
Bourne, who as a member of the Ad-
visory Committee knows all about
aliens, and declared that “Repatriate
them all ” was a foolish cry, if it meant
that we were expected to present Ger-
many with the British wives and
children of the dear deported.
Lord JERSEY, for the
Government, desired to
treat even Germans
justly, but could not see
why anyone should wish
in these times to in-
crease our alien popula-
tion. His speech did not
please a batch of noble
sentimentalists, drawn
from both sides, but
seemed to give great
satisfaction to Lord LIN-
coLNSHIRE, who quoted
with approval the brave
Lord MILNER made a fairly cheerful
speech in the circumstances; but I hope
that potential strikers will not take too
literally his observation that the one
thing most needed at the present mo-
ment was “economy of national energy.”
Mr. CHURCHILL came down heavily
upon Sir DoNALD MACLEAN's attempt
to delay the adoption of compulsion in
the new Military Service Bill. When
rather more than half of Europe was
seething with unrest, which might re-
quire military intervention, it would be
fatal to let our army disappear; yet the
right hon. gentleman seemed to think
that everyone ought to be disarmed
except LENIN and TROTSKY.
For the first time since 1914 private
Members had an evening to themselves.
out laboriously may have contained a
complete reply to Lord DESBoRough's
main allegations, even if they included
no refutation of the stories of the bricks
imported by the hundred thousand into
a district containing some of the best
brick-earth in the country, or of the
four pounds a week paid for the ser-
vices of a railway pensioner aged ninety-
two. But as hardly anyone could hear
the recital it created little impression.
The Ministry are evidently unwilling
to stake their political lives on Mr.
CHURCHILL's approval of the project, for
Mr. BonAR LAw announced that the
Government Whips would not be put
on for the forthcoming division on the
subject.
Mr. G. Roberts furnished an in-
teresting analysis of the
nine shillings now
charged for a bottle of
whisky. Three-and-six-
pence represents the cost
of the spirit plus pre-war
taxation. The other five-
and-sixpence is made up
of interest to manufac-
turers, insurance and
rent; increased price of
bottles and corks; mar-
gins of profit to blenders
and bottlers, merchants
and other traders; and
words on the subject
increase of taxation. By
uttered by the Lord
CHANCELLOR at the Gen-
eral Election, before his
style had been mollified
by the Woolsack.
In the Commons Mr.
BoNAR LAw regretfully
explained that it was im-
possible for the Govern-
ment to do anything to
reduce the high prices - now being
charged for furniture in the East End.
His own experience as a Cabinet-maker
has been entirely confined to the West
End.
Nor could the Government take any
direct steps to ameliorate the over-
crowding on the Underground railways.
But, as it was stated that large quan-
tities of leather are still being purchased
on Government account, there are
hopes that more accommodation for
strap-hangers may shortly be available.
Tuesday, March 25th.-The Lords
spent three hours of almost unrelieved
gloom in discussing the financial con-
dition of the country. On that old
problem of the economists, “What is
a pound?” Lord D'ABERNoN delivered
an erudite discourse, from which I gath-
ered that it was at present about
ten shillings and still shrinking. The
only comfort is that at that rate the
National Debt has already been halved.
THE BONAR LAW ORACLE WILL SPEAK ON FISCAL POLICY
“AS SOON AS THE TIME IS RIPE."
They utilised it in endeavouring to
obtain from the Government a direct
statement of its future fiscal policy. On
Imperial Preference Mr. BonAR LAw
was quite explicit; the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchequeB was already con-
sidering how to incorporate it in the
next Budget. As to the Government's
fiscal policy generally it had already
been outlined in the PRIME MINISTER’s
letter to himself, and would be definitely
declared as soon as the time was ripe
—a cautious statement which, as was
perhaps intended, left Free Traders and
Protectionists still guessing.
Wednesday, March 26th.-After Lord
DESBOROUGH's vivacious attack upon
the Cippenham Motor Depôt, it is
doubtful whether anyone could have
enabled the Government to wriggle out
of the demand for an independent in-
quiry. At any rate Lord INveſtForTH
was insufficiently agile. The innumer-
able type-written sheets which he read
some oversight nothing
appears to have been
charged for the extra
water, but no doubt this
will be remedied in the
next Budget.
Thursday, March 27th.
—To those who remem-
ber the debates on the
Parliament Act, circa
1911, it was amusing to hear Lords
CREwe and BUCKMASTER complaining
of the unceremonious manner in which
the Lords' amendments to the Rents
Bill had been treated in “another
place;" and being entreated not to pick
a quarrel with the Commons by those
ancient champions of the Upper Cham-
ber, Lord CURzoN and the Lord CHAN-
CELLOR.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
announced the names of the Royal
Commissioners who are to consider
how the income-tax can be improved.
Several Members complained that there
is only one woman among them, and
that, pending their report (expected
some time next year), the glaring
anomaly by which husband and wife
are regarded for taxable purposes as a
single entity is apparently to be con-
tinued. The idea of presenting Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN with a box for The Purse
Strings, in the hope that it would con-

vert him, has unfortunately been frus-
trated by the withdrawal of the play.
Mr. BonAR LAw's determination to
leave the Cippenham question to the
free judgment of the House led (as
possibly he anticipated) to its express-
ing no judgment at all. Sir DoNALD
MACLEAN and others served up a rather
insipid réchauffé of Lord DESBoRough's
indictment, and Mr. CHURCHILL re-
peated Lord INverForTH's defence, but
put a little more ginger into it. Inci-
dentally he mentioned that a prolonged
search for the monagenarian pensioner
had produced nobody more venerable
than a comparative youngster of sixty-
five. Deprived of this prop the Oppo-
sition felt unequal to walking through
the Lobbies. -
THE FAIRIES” FLITTING.
THERE's a family of fairies lives inside
our pigeon-cot,
Down the garden, near the great big
sumach-tree,
Where the grass has grown across the
path and dead leaves lie and rot
And no one hardly ever goes but me;
Yes, it's just the place for fairies, and
they told the pigeons so;
They begged to be allowed to move
in soon ;
It's a most tremendous honour, as of
course the pigeons know;
It was all arranged this very after-
noon.
There's a family of fairies lives inside
our pigeon-cot—
Oh, the bustle and the sweeping
there has been
For the pigeons didn't scrub their
house (I think they all forgot),
And the fairies like their home so
scrup'lous clean;
There are fairy dusters hanging from
the sumach as you pass;
Tiny drops are dripping still from
overhead; -
Broken fairy-brooms are lying near the
fir-tree on the grass,
Though the fairies went an hour ago
to bed.
There's a family of fairies lives inside
our pigeon-cot,
And there's cooings round about our
chimney-stack,
For the pigeons are all sitting there
and talking such a lot
And there's nothing Gard’mer does
will drive them back;
“Why, they'll choke up those roof-gut-
ters if they start this nesting fuss;
They've got a house,” he says, “so
I don't see—”
No, he doesn't know the secret, and
there's no one does but—us,
All the pigeons, and the fairy-folk

WHAT EVERY MINISTER SHOULD KNOW.
The Times is much concerned with
the chaotic condition of the Air Min-
istry and the strange designs with
which the political heads of the De-
partment are credited. “These sus-
picions we believe to be without any
real foundation, but they are active,
though Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL and
General SEELY may be wholly uncon-
scious of them. We believe they are,
and if they are the sooner they are told
what is said about their intentions the
better.”
So The Times proceeds to describe
these nefarious if nebulous designs and
appeals to Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL in
particular, “if he has no such inten-
tions, to disclaim them publicly and in
a way which will leave no breeding-
ground for future rumours.”
ENFIN SEULS
The Times has done a great service
by its splendid candour, but it has only
gone about one-fortieth part of the
way. There are still, we believe, some
eighty Ministers, and all without ex-
ception ought to know what is being
said about them, to enable them to
confirm or disavow these disquieting
speculations. The papers simply teem
with secret histories of the week, diaries
of omniscient pundits and so forth, in
which these rumours multiply to an
extent that staggers the plain person.
Take the PREMIER to begin with. Is
it really true that he has decided, as the
brain of the Empire can only be located
in Printing House Square, to resign
office and become home editor of The
Times, leaving foreign policy to be con-
trolled by Mr. Wickham STEED 2 Is it
true that he meditates appointing Mr.
AUGUSTU's John Minister of Fine Arts 2
Is it true that he flies every day from
Paris to Mentone, to receive instruc-
tions from a Mysterious Nobleman who
is shortly to be raised to ducal honours?
Is it true that until quite recently he
had never heard of JoAN of ARC and
thought that Victor Hugo was a
Roman emperor 2
Then there is Mr. BoMAR LAw. He
surely ought to know that it is said by
The Job and The Morning Ghost that he
informed Mr. SMILLIE, during one of
their recent conversations, that he
hoped, in the event of a general strike,
to be allowed to get away to the small ||
island in the South Pacific which he
has purchased as a refuge in case of
such a contingency. Probably such an
idea never entered his head. But this
is what he is supposed to be planning.
Let him therefore disclaim the inten-
tion promptly and publicly. -
Grievous mischief again is being don
by the persistent rumours current about
the intention of the Lord CHANCELLOR
to take Orders with the view of becoming
Archbishop of Canterbury at the earliest
possible opportunity. There may be
absolutely nothing in it. Mr. HARold
SMITH scouts the notion as absurd. But
very great men do not always confide
in brothers. NAPoleoN, as we know,
thought poorly of his.
Lastly, is it true that, although Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN is still nominally
Chancellor of the Exchequer, he is
really a prisoner in the Tower, con-
veyed under guard to and from the
House, and that the reprieve of the
sentence of capital punishment passed
on him by The Daily Mail may expire
—and he with it—at any moment 2
These are only a few of the things
which are said about them that Minis-
ters ought to know—if they don't know
them already. And if they do, and
basely pretend not to, we feel that we
have done a truly patriotic service in
rendering it impossible for them to
avoid enlightening the public. It is
always well to know the worst, even
about politicians.

AT THE OPERA.
IN these dull days of reaction, when,
in the intervals of jazzing, we have
nothing to satisfy the spiritual void
left by the War except the possibility
of an industrial cataclysm at home and
the triumph of Bolshevism abroad, we
owe a large debt of gratitude to Sir
Thomas BEECHAM for his efforts to
revive the Town. And the Town is at
last appreciating at their full worth his
services both to the cause of popular
education in music and to the encour-
agement of native talent.
It was perhaps a little unfortunate
that Aida should have been given on the
night of the Guards' march through
London, for the parade of the Pharaoh's
scratch soldiery suffered badly by com-
parison. The priesthood of Isis, too,
furnished more humour than could, I
think, have been designed, and I doubt
if even Mr. WEEDON GRossMITH could
have given us anything funnier than
the spectacle presented by the Egyptian
monarch when making his announce-
ment of an Ethiopian raid. Nor shall
I easily forget the figure of the King of
Ethiopia, with a head of hair like a
Zulu's, and swathed in a tiger-skin. I
should myself have chosen the hide of
a leopard, for the leopard cannot change
his spots nor the 12thiopian his skin,
and when you get the two together you
have an extraordinarily durable com-
bination. -
It would be false flattery to say that
Miss Rosin A BUCKMAN quite looked the
part of Aïda, or Miss EDNA THoRNToN
that of Amneris, but they both sang
finely, and the orchestra did great work
under Mr. EUGENE GoossENs, Sen.
In Louise, again, it was the orchestra,
cleverly steered by Sir THOMAS BEECHAM
through the difficult score for the
choruses, that sustained us through the
banalities of an opera which has only
one dramatic moment—when her father
hastens the eviction of Louise by throw-
ing a chair at her, very well aimed by
Mr. RobºBT RADFord, who only just
missed his mark. I suppose it is hope-
less to expect that themakers of “Grand”
Opera (whose sense of humour is seldom
their strong point) will consent to allow
the trivialities of ordinary speech in
everyday life (“How do you do?”
“Thank you, I am not feeling my best,”
and so on) to be said—if they must find
expression of some sort—and not sung.
By way of contrast to the modern
realism which makes so unlikely a
material for serious opera, the fantastic
irresponsibility of The Magic Flute came
as a great relief. Its simpler music,
serenely sampling the whole gamut of
emotions, grave to gay, offered equal
chances (all taken) to the pure love-
singing of Miss AGNEs Nicholls as
Pamina, and Mr. MAURICE D'OISLY as
Tamino, the light-hearted frivolity of
Papageno (Mr. RANALow), and the
solemn pontifics (de profundissimis) of
Mr. Foster RICHARDSON's Sarastro.

AT THE PLAY.
“WICTORY.”
MR. MACDoNALD HASTINGs has in-
vented, and committed, yet another new
sin—that of attempting to do a CoNRAD
novel into a three-act play. Fifteen,
possibly; but three? We hardly think.
What every Conradist knows is that you
can't compress that master of subtlety
without losing the master's dominant
quality—atmosphere; that it's not so
much the things he says but the queer
way and the odd order in which he says
them that matter. He is not precisely
a filmable person.
And yet, all things considered, the
potter has produced a tolerable pot, and
we may write down his fault of extreme
foolhardiness as venial. What, how-
ever, Mr. CoNRAD himself thought of
the rehearsals, if he attended them—but
perhaps we need not go into that.
It is easy to see the attraction, for
the players, of the series of star parts
provided by the exciting story. You
have first the eccentric, misjudged
Swede, Heyst (the adapter makes him
an Englishman, perhaps wisely, as our
stage takes no account of Swedes), come
from self-banishment on a far Pacific
island—a complex Conradian person-
ality. Then his arch-enemy, Schom-
berg, lieutenant of reserve, shady hotel-
keeper, sensualist and craven, with his
insane malice. To these enter as pretty
a company of miscreants as ever sailed
the Southern seas: the sinister Jones,
misogynist to the point of fine frenzy,
nonconformist in the matter of card-
playing, and thereafter frank bandit
with a high ethic as to the superiority
of plain robbery under arms over mere
vulgar swindling—a gentleman with a
code, in fact; his strictly incomparable
“secretary,” Ricardo of the rolling
eyes and gait and deathly treacherous
knife, philogynist sans phrase ; and
Pedro, their groom, a reincarnated
Caliban. It may also be noted that
Heyst has a freak servant, the disap-
pearing Wang, whom the adapter uses, I
suppose legitimately, as a kind of clown.
And then, finally, there is a charming
and unusual heroine, Lema, still in her
teens, but of real flesh and blood, inno-
cent and persecuted, daughter of a
drunken fiddler (deceased), herself fid-
dling in a tenth-rate orchestra at Schom-
berg's hotel, wherein it is not intended
that the music shall be the chief attrac-
tion to the guests.
Heyst is Perseus to Lena's Andro-
meda, carrying her off to his island out
of lust's way. But dragon Schomberg
has a sting left in his malicious tale, told
to the unlikely trio of scoundrels, to the
effect that Heyst has ill-gotten treasure
hoarded on his island. Dragon Ricardo
persuades his chief to the adventure of
attaching it. - A fine brew of passion
and action forsooth: Lena passionately
adoring; the aloof Heyst passing sud-
denly from indifference to ardour; the
bestial Ricardo in pursuit of his startled
quarry; and gentleman Jones intent on
non-existent booty and rapt out of him
self by cynical fury at the discovery of
an unsuspected woman in the case.
And while Mr. CoNRAD in his novel
drives all these to a relentless doom Mr.
HASTINGs contrives a happy ending,
which goes perilously near an anti-
climax, with the hero on his knees and
the heroine pointing up to heaven and
claiming a “victory” quite other than
their creator intended. But then he
knew perfectly well that nobody wants
to come to see Miss MARIE LöHR killed.
H^1ttp://
THE LAGGARD LOVER.
Lena (Miss MARIE LöHR) to Heyst (Mr.
MURRAY CARRINGTON). “OH YEs, you smile
ALL RIGHT ; BUT ONE MAY SMILE AND SMILE
AND YET GET No FoERARDER.”
On the whole I can't think the cast
was up to its extremely difficult task,
if you estimate that task, as it seems to
me you must, to be the reproducing of
the original Victory characters. Per-
haps Mr. SAM LIVESEY's Ricardo was
the nearest, though the primitive
savagery of his wooing had to be toned
down in the interests of propriety. Mr.
GAYER MACKAY made his Jones interest-
ing and plausible in the quieter opening
movements. In the intended tragic
spasms one felt that he became rather
comic than sinister. Not his fault, I
think. He had no room or time to
work up his part. That should also
apply to Mr. GARRY's Schomberg, though
he doesn't seem to have tried to fit him-
self into the skin of that entertaining vil-
lain. Mr. MURRAY CARRINGTON had an
exceedingly tough task with his Heyst.
But was he even as detached and
eccentric as the average modern don?
Certainly he was not the man of
mystery of the original pattern, but
rather the amiable comely film-hero.
Miss LöHR had her interesting mo-
ments, the best of them, perhaps, in the
First Act. In her big scene, where the
knife is to be won from Ricardo, she
was no doubt hampered by the tradition
that it is necessary to play down to the
carefully cultivated imbecility of the
audience in order that they should not
misunderstand the most obvious points.
It's not flattering to us, but it can't be
helped. Probably we deserve it. But
need she have been quite so refined 2
Only very occasionally does she remem-
ber that Lena is fine matter in a “com-
mon” mould, which is surely of the
essence of the situation. I do seriously
recommend a re-reading of what should
be a character full of blood, which is
ever so much more amusing than saw-
dust, however charmingly encased. I
feel sure she could shock and at the
same time please the groundlings iſ
|she let herself go.
And where, by the way, did she get
that charmingly-cut skirt in the Second
Act 2 She certainly hadn't it in her
bundle when she left the hotel. And
yet the stage-manager will go to the
trouble, for the sake of a quite misguided
realism, of making the hotel orchestra
play against the dialogue as if the per-
sistent coughing of the audience were
not sufficient handicap to his team.
Miss BALVAIRD-HEwBTTgave a clever
rendering of the hotel-keeper's sombre,
Frau; and Mr. GEORGE ELTON con-
tributed an excellent Chinese servant.

[APRIL 2, 1919.
THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY COLLAR.
Mr. Bingley-Spyker pleaded surprise. He pointed out
that he had been in bed for a fortnight, “laid aside,” as he
said, “through the prevailing epidemic.” In the meantime
the revolution had taken place, and he had heard nothing
about it.
“Well,” said the President gruffly, “we carm't 'elp that,
can we, comrades? While this 'ere citizen 'as been restin'
in the lap o' luxury, so to speak, we workers 'ave been
revolutin'. An' that's all there is to it.”
“But fair play,” persisted Mr. Bingley-Spyker gently, “is
a jewel. At least so I have always understood.”
“Not so much of it, me lad,” interrupted the President
sharply. “Now then, comrade, wot's the charge?”
An unkempt person stepped up to the front and, clearing
his throat with some emphasis, began —
“About ten-thirty this morning I see this gentleman
“What 2 ” The interruption came simultaneously from
several members of the tribunal. -
º 4 this party walkin' down Whitehall casual-like, as if
the place belonged to 'im instead of to us. “What ho!'
I says to myself, “this 'ere chap looks like a counter-
revolution'ry;' and with that I comes closer to 'im. Sure
enough he was wearin' a 'igh collar, about three inches
'igh, I should say, all white an' shiny, straight from the
lorndry. I could 'ardly believe my eyes.” -
“Never mind your eyes, comrade,” the President said;
“tell us what you did.”
“I accosted 'im and said, ‘Ere, citizen, wot do you
mean by wearin' a collar like that ?’”
“An' what was the reply 2” -
“He looked at me 'aughty-like, an' says, “Get away,
my man, or I shall call the police.’ An' thereupon I
said, 'P'r'aps you don't know it, citizen, but I am the
p'lice, an’, wot's more, I arrest you for wearin' a white
collar, contrairy to the regulations in that case made
an' perwided.’”
“Very good, comrade,” murmured the President, “very
good indeed. Did he seem surprised?”
“Knocked all of a 'eap. So I took him into custody and
brought him along.”
“You did well, comrade. The Tribunal thanks you.
Step down now, me lad, and don't make too much noise.
Now then, prisoner, you've 'eard the charge; what have
you got to say about it?”
“Only this,” said Mr. Bingley-Spyker firmly, “that I
am not guilty.”
“Not guilty?” shouted the President. “Why, you've
got the blooming thing on now !”
“Yes,” said the prisoner mildly. “But observe.”
Somewhat diffidently he removed his collar and held it
up to view. “You call this a clean, white, shiny collar?
Well, it's not. Fawn-colour, if you like; speckled—yes;
but white—clean 2 No! Believe me,” continued Mr. Bing-
ley-Spyker, warming to his subject, “it’s years since I've
had a genuinely clean collar from my laundry. Mostly
they are speckled. And the specks are usually in a con-
spicuous position; one on each wing is a favourite com-
bination. I grant you these can be removed by a pen-
knife, but imperfectly and with damage to the fabric.
When what I may call the main portion of the collar is
affected, the speckled area may occasionally be concealed
by a careful disposition of one's tie. But not often. The
laundress, with diabolical cunning, takes care to place
her trade-mark as near the top rim as possible. I have
not by any means exhausted the subject,” he concluded,
“but I think I have said enough to clear myself of this
particular charge.” -
x -
It seemed then to Mr. Bingley-Spyker that all the mem-
bers of the Tribunal were shouting together. On the whole
he gathered that he had not improved his position. He
had been “attacking the proletariat."
“’Ard-working gyurls,” panted a woman - member ex-
citedly, “toilin' and moilin' at wash-tubs and mangles
for the likes of 'im | It's a rope collar he wants, Mr.
President. Make it a 'anging matter, I should.”
“Silence, comrades 1" commanded the President. “Let
me deal with.'im. Prisoner, the Tribunal finds you guilty
of wearing a collar, contrary to the regulations. Collars are
the 'all-marks of a slave civilization; they 'ave no place
in a free state. The sentence of the Court is that you
be committed to a State laundry for ten years, with 'ard
labour, principally at mangles. Remove the prisoner.”
So they removed Mr. Bingley-Spyker . . .
He was glad when he woke up to find himself in his
own room in his own Government office at Whitehall, with
the afternoon sun streaming deliciously through the win
dows. Involuntarily he felt for his collar. -

Small Boy (who has been promised a visit to the Zoo to-morrow). “I HOPE WE SHALL HAve. A BETTER DAY FOR IT THAN:NoAH HAD,”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I Found myself as much taken with the title of The
Great Interruption (HUTCHINsoN) as with any of the dozen
short war-stories that Mr. W. B. MAxwell, has collected in
the volume. Yet these are admirable of their kind—“muffin-
tales” is my own name for them, of just the length to hold
your attention for a solitary tea-hour and each with some
novelty of idea or distinction in treatment that makes the
next page worth turning. The central theme of all is, of
course, the same: the War in its effect upon people at the
fighting front and elsewhere. Perhaps it was inevitable
that Mr. MAxwell, should betray a certain faintly cynical
amusement in his dealings with the people of elsewhere.
Two of the stories especially—“The Strain of It” and
“What Edie Regretted"—are grimly illustrative of some
home keeping types for whom the great tragedy served only
as an opportunity for social advancement or a pleasantly-
thrilling excuse for futilities. There will be no reader who
will not smilingly acknowledge the justice of these sketches;
not one of us whose neighbours could not supply an original
for them. Fortunately the book has other tales of which
the humour is less caustic; probably of intention Mr. MAX-
well's pictures of war as the soldier knew it, its hardships
and compensations, contrast poignantly with the others.
On the active-service side my choice would undoubtedly
be for the admirably cheery and well-told “Christmas is
Christmas” (not exactly about fraternization), as convincing
a realisation of the Front at its best as any I remember to
have read in more pretentious volumes. -
I am bound to admit that for all my appreciation of
Mr. J. D. BERESFORD as a literary craftsman I did find
The Jervaise Comedy (CoLLINs) a bit slow off the mark,
Here is a quite eonsiderable volume, exquisitely printed
upon delightful paper, all about the events of twenty-four
hours, in which, when you come to consider it afterwards,
nothing very much happened. The heroine thought about
eloping with the chauffeur, and the onlooker, who tells the
tale, thought about falling in love with the sister of the
same. In both cases thought is subsequently translated
into action, but only after the curtains fall. Meanwhile an
affair of hesitations, suggestions, moods and (as I hinted
above) rather too many words. It is a tribute to Mr.
BERESFORD's art that out of all this we do eventually
emerge with some definite idea of the characters and a
pleasantly-amused interest in their fate. There is, of
course, plenty of distinction in the writing. But I could
have wished more or earlier movement. Even the motor-
car, whose appearance promised a hint, the merest far-off
possibility, of farcical developments, shared in the general
lethargy and refused to move from its ditch. In spite,
however, of this procrastination I wish it to be understood
that the story is in some ways one of unusual charm; it
has style, atmosphere and a very sensible dignity. But,
lacking the confidence that I fortunately had in my author,
I question whether I should have survived to the point at
which these qualities became apparent. - :
An author who in his first novel can deliberately put
himself in the way of temptation and as unhesitatingly
avoid it must be worth following. And so, if for no other

reason, one might look forward to Mr. BERNARD DUFFY's
next book with uncommon interest. His hero comes into
the story as a foundling, being deposited in a humble Irish
home and an atmosphere of mystery by some woman un-
known; he is supported thereafter by sufficiently suggestive
remittances, and he passes through a Bohemian boyhood
and a more normal though still intriguing early struggle
and fluctuating love-story to eventual success, always with
the glamour of conventional romance about him, only to
turn out nobody in particular in the end. Congratulations!
One was horribly afraid he would be compelled to be at
least the acknowledged heir to a title. Quite apart from
this, too, Oriel (FISHER UNwiN) is after an unassuming
fashion one of the most easily and happily read and, one
would say, happily written books that has appeared for
many a long day, with humour that is Irish without being
too broadly of the brogue, and with people who are dis-
tinctive without ever becoming unnatural. The dear old
tramping quack-doctor, Oriel's foster-father, in particular
might well be praised in language that would sound ex-
aggerated. Mr. DUFFY's work, depending as it does mainly
on a flow of charming and even exquisite side incident,
BUCKRose) the characters themselves are more credible
than the way in which they carry on. Thus, while Mr.
Tubbs, the middle-aged and high-principled champion of dis-
tress, is both human and likeable, I was never persuaded that
any more real motive than regard for an amusing situation
would compel him to saddle himself with the continued
society of a squint-eyed maid-servant and her yellow cat,
turned adrift through his unfortunate attempts to befriend
them. I think I need not tell you all, or even a part of all,
that happens to Mr. Tubbs and Belinda and the yellow cat
after their arrival as fugitives at the pleasant village of
Holmes-Eaton, or do more than hint at the trials of this
poor knight-errant, mistaken for a burglar and a libertine,
till the hour when (the book being sufficiently full) he is
rewarded with the hand of beauty and the prospect of what
I will venture to call a Buckroseate future. They were no
more than his due for remaining a consistent gentleman
amid the temptations of farce. One word of criticism
however; surely Mr. BUCKRose has made a study of The
Boy's Own Paper less intimate than mine if he supposes
that a story with such a title as “The Red Robbers of
Ravenhill" could ever have gained admittance to those
suggests that he is no
more than beginning to
tap a most extensive re-
servoir. I greatly hope
that this is the case. -

known treasure-hunts in
which I have followed the
chronicles finds the Greystokes somewhat anxious about
the restlessness and unconventional tastes of their school-
boy son, who inherits not only his father's vague jungle
longings but all his explicit acquired characteristics, so
that when, with the decent old ape, Akut, disguised as
his invalid grandmother, he sails away from England and
plunges into the wild he promptly becomes the terror of
the jungle and bites the jugular veins of hostile man and
beast with such a precision of technique that he becom
king of the ape-folk, as his father, Tarzan, had been before
him. Plausibility, even within the limits of his bizarre
plan, is not Mr. BURRoughs' strong suit, but exciting inci-
dent, ingeniously imagined and staged, with swift move-
ment, undoubtedly is. If the author wouldn't let his
favourites off so easily and would give their enemies a
better sporting chance, he would more readily sustain the
illusion which is of the essence of real enjoyment in this
kind of fantasy. But I imagine the normal human boy
will find nothing whatever to complain of, and to him I
chiefly commend this yarn.
The Tale of Mr. Tubbs (HopDER AND Stoughton) is
one of those which hover agreeably between low comedy
and refined farce, in a world which, being frankly to the last
degree improbable, makes no urgent demand for belief.
Sometimes indeed (as I have observed before with Mr. J. E.

some fine hunting, with a surprise at the end of it, and what
more can treasure-hunters, or we who read of them, possibly
want? The date of this quest is modern, and more than once
I found myself thinking that the twentieth century was not
the fittest period in which to lay such a plot as this. . But
I am content to believe that Mr. MALORY knows his business
better than I do, and as–like a good huntsman—he has
left me with a keen desire to go a-hunting with him again,
I beg to thank him for my day's sport.

O. S.
TO-DAY IN THE FOOD GARDEN.
PEAs.-Have you planted your early peas yet? If not
you should do so at once. Select a piece of well-tilled
ground running North and South. To find the North go
out at twelve o'clock and stand facing the direction you
think the sun would be in if it were visible. Turn smartl
about bringing up the left foot on the word “Two.” If
you guessed right the first time you will now be facing
North. Without taking your eye off it, drill your peas into
the ground in columns of fours. Don't forget to soak them
in prussic acid or any simple poison (this is done more
easily before they are sown) to prevent them being eaten
by mice. A less effective precaution is to sit up all night
near the vegetable garden and miaow. -
Here is a good recipe for cooking peas. Shell the peas.
Take a piece of butter as big as a nut, two ducklings,
six ounces sage and onions and three drops of mushroom
catsup. Roast together briskly for twenty minutes. Boil
the peas for fifteen minutes. Serve together.
ONIONS.—The big, gentle onions seen in the shops can
only be brought to maturity on very warm sandy soil.
Most of them come from Portugal. How the natives can
bear to part with them is a mystery. The small high-
powered onions, on the other hand, are easily cultivated.
The best varieties are Eau de Jazz, Cook's Revenge, Sutton's
Saucepan Corroder and Soho Violet. Sow in rows and
beat the soil flat with the back of a spade. Your neigh-
bour's spade is as good as any other for this purpose.
Goats are said to be very fond of onion tops, but many
- i people hesitate to keep both. -
PARsNIPs.--To get big parsnips plant a single row twenty
feet long. Thin out to ten feet apart. The crop you will
get will last you until the following year. Placed in a
quiet corner of the potting-shed and covered with sand it
will last for several years. To get the best out of parsnips
stew them in a bain-marie for eight hours. Remove the
undissolved portion of the parsnips and set the liquid on
the stone floor of the larder to cool. Prepare a nice thick
stock, adding seasoning to taste. Cut up three carrots.
Place the carrots in the saucepan in which the parsnips
were cooked, being careful to wash it out first. Add the
stock, bring to a boil and serve.
A LADY-FRIEND sends me the following instructions for
growing vegetable marrows: In the sunniest part of the
garden—the middle of the tennis-court is as good as any-
where else—dig a trench ten feet deep and about six wide,
taking care to keep the top soil separate from the subsoil.
Into this trench tip about six hundredweight of a compost
made up of equal parts of hyperphosphate of lime, ground
bones, nitrate of soda and basic-slag. The basic-slag should
be obtained direct from the iron-foundry. That kept
by the chemist is not always fresh. Add one chive, one
cardamon, two cloves, half a nutmeg and salt to taste.
Replace the top-soil. Top-soil and sub-soil can easily be
distinguished in the following way. If it is on your
whiskers it is top-soil, if on your boots sub-soil. In the
middle of the bed set a good strong marrow seedling, root
downwards. As it grows remove all the marrows except
the one you wish to develop. When it stands about two
hands high, thread a piece of worsted through it, allowing
the end of the worsted to hang in a pail of water. Some
gardeners recommend whisky-and-water. If the marrow
is intended for exhibition a half-inch pipe connected with
the water main may be substituted for the worsted as soon
as the marrow is about six feet long. Make a muslin bag
out of a pair of drawing-room curtains and enclose the
marrow in it. This will protect it from mosquitoes. As
soon as the marrow ceases growing or if it becomes slug-
gish and exhibits loss of appetite it is ready for the table.
Marrows grown in this way make delicious orange-mar-

about forty feet long. Lay one end anywhere and the

the hose-pipe to rest. Now hold the hose-pipe perpen-

IN spite of oft-repeated warnings—in
spite of the fact that I personally ex-
plained to each sentry that all he had
to remember was that there were only
seven different kinds of military passes,
each one of different colour and all with
dates, stamps and signatures, and that
there was no difficulty in recognising its
validity if a pass had the right British
official stamp and so long as the signa-
ture underneath was one of the twenty-
four people authorised to sign (a list of
which would be kept in every sentry-
box and constantly revised), and if
the number of the pass, the name of
the person, his address, destination,
habits, hobbies and past life tallied
exactly with the information on his
“personal Ausweis,” which must be
produced except in the case of a licence
to proceed by bicycle, which differed, of
course, in colour, shape, size and other
small details (which would have to be
learnt by heart) from the licence to
carry foodstuffs—in spite, also, of the
fact that all necessary details of the
examination of passes were typewritten
in not more than three pages of the clear-
est official language and were posted
up in every sentry-box—even then that
ass Nijinsky let the whole company
down by passing a member of the In-
telligence Police through the line on
his giving his word of honour that it
was all right. -
The result was, of course, that I
received official intimation that our
line could apparently be broken at any
time and that “steps must be taken,”
etc., etc. I took steps in the direction
of Nijinsky.
Nijinsky is a Polish Jew (from Com-
mercial Road, E.) and has long been
the despair of his platoon sergeant.
He is fat where there is no need to be
fat, his clothes bulge where no clothes
are expected to bulge, and he is the
kind of man who loses a cap-badge
once a week, preferably just before the
C.O. comes round. There is only one
saving grace about him. He can always
be trusted to volunteer for a dull lecture
or outing to which nobody else wants
to go, but to which cerain numbers
have to be sent. His invariable reply
to the question is, “Yiss, I'll ger-go,
it's ser-something for ner-nothing.”
I found him, as I expected, hanging
round the cookhouse, and taxed him
with his neglect of duty.
“He ter-told me I ought to use my
dis-cretion, Sir,” he piped in his high
plaintive voice.
I told him severely that it was a
trick, a very palpable trick, and that
he must ever be on the alert for all
such kinds of evasion. Finally, when I
had informed him how badly he had let
us all down, he waddled away contrite
and tearful, and fully under the im-
pression, I think, that I should prob-
ably lose my commission through his
negligence. -
I did not realise how deeply he had
taken the matter to heart until I found
him at his post apparently reading the
Riot Act to a crowd of obsequious
Huns, who were listening patiently to
the written law as expounded in Yiddish
—that being a language in which he
succeeds in making himself partially
understood. The incident passed, but
I began to have fears that the reformed
rake might prove a greater danger
than ever.
The next day my worst fears were
realised. In fact, during my temporary

absence Nijinsky surpassed himself.
At eleven o'clock the General, supported
by his Staff, rolled up in his car and
stopped at Nijinsky's post on his way
into “neutral ” country. The General,
the G.S.O.1, the D.A.Q.M.G. and the
A.D.C. got out, shining, gorgeous and
beflowered with foreign decorations, to
chat to the sentry (you've seen pictures
of it; it's always being done). Nijinsky,
who had already turned back two in-
nocuous Gunner Colonels (armed with
sporting guns) that morning, sauntered
up, drunk with newly acquired confi-
dence, his rifle slung on his right
shoulder and his hat over one eye.
“All well here, sentry?” asked the
General, towering over him in all his
glory.
“Pup-pass, please,” said Nijinsky,
ever on the look-out for some cunning
trick. -
“Oh, that's all right; I'm General
'Blank.”
The word “General” recalled Nijinsky
to his senses. He unslung his rifle,
brought it to the order, brought it to
the slope and presented arms with great
solemnity, and as only Nijinsky can.
“Oh—er—stand easy,” said the
General, when the meaning of these
evolutions was made manifest to him.
“Wonderful days for you fellows here
—what?. There have been times when
the Rhine seemed a long way away,
didn't it 2 And now here you are, a
victorious army guarding that very
river! It's a wonderful time for you,
and no doubt you appreciate it?”
“Ger-grub's short,” said Nijinsky.
“Rations?” said the D.A.Q.M.G.
“I’ve had no complaints.”
“Yiss. No spuds—taters, I mean.”
“We must see to that,” said the
General. “Well, we'll go on, I think;"
and they got into the car.
“Pup-pass, please,” said Nijinsky,
spotting the trick at once.
“Oh, that's all right, my good fellow.
Drive on.”
“N-n-no,” said Nijinsky sternly;
“you ker-can't ger-go without a pup-
pup-pass!”
“Come, come, don't be ridiculous.
I'm your General; you know me per-
fectly well.” -
“Yiss.” .
“Then let me through, do you hear?
And let me have no more of this in-
fernal nonsense.”
“It's ug-ug—”
“It's What?”
“Ug-against orders.”
“I know all about the orders, boy.
I gave them myself.'
“Yiss, and I'm ker-carrying them
out, ain't I?” came with inexorable
logic.
“Well, now I give you orders to let
me through. - Do you see?”
“Yiss; but if I do they'll have me
up for disobeying the fer-first one.
Pup-pass, please.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. We must go
through. Don't you realise we have our
duty to perform 2"
“Yiss, Sir, so have I.”
“'Pon my soul, this is too prepos-
terous. My good boy, I'm very glad
you know how to obey an order, but
you must use your discretion some-
times.”
At the word “discretion ” Nijinsky
started. Then he broke all records and
winked—winked at a perfectly good
General at eleven o'clock in the
morning.
“Oh, no, you der-don't,” he grinned;
“I've been her-had before. The Cap-
tain says I'm ner-not to use my dis-
cretion; it only ger-gets me into a lot
of terouble.”
The General got out of his car. So

So did the A.D.C. But the spectacle
was not so impressive as before. They
advanced in artillery formation upon
the enemy. It was enough. Perish
the General Staff They were mere
phantoms of authority beside the vision
of the company officer and the words,
“Escort and accused—halt. Left—turn.
Private Nijinsky, Sir.” With his eyes
bulging with excitement Nijinsky leapt
back and assumed the attitude of war-
like defiance known as “coming on
guard.”
The General hesitated. He did not
know Nijinsky, you see; he had never
seen him going sick before the bat-
tle, or heard him murmur, “ser-some-
thing for ner-nothing,” as he took his
medicine.
“Look here, my man, you are ex-
ceeding your duty and the consequences
will be very serious. I will not be
stopped in this outrageous manner!
There is a time to obey orders and
there is a time to use our discretion.
Confound it, we must all of us use our
discretion at times.”
“Then,” said Nijinsky, “wer-will
you per-please use yours, for I ker-
can't let you through without a pup-
pass.”
The sun shone brightly on the car as
it retired ignominiously, leaving Nijin-
sky hot, happy and victorious, present-
ing arms faithfully to the indignant
Great Ones, and silence reigned on the
battlefield. -
He came and spluttered it all out to
me afterwards, concluding with “I
der-didn't let the ker-company down
this time, Sir, der-did I ?” and evi-
dently expected a pat on the back
ſor it.
Teams of infuriated artillery horses
wouldn't drag from me whether he got
it or not, but from that day to this he
has never looked back. Indeed he has
begun to take a pride in his personal
appearance and general smartness. I
met him yesterday wearing a smile
like a slice of melon and with his
boots and buttons glistening in the
sunshine. -
“The General came through to-day,
Sir," he said, beaming, “and he her-had
a pup-pass all right;" and he strutted
on, making strange noises in his throat,
which I understand is the Yiddish for
being pleased with yourself. L.

GETTING A JOB.
John looked very gloomy.
“Pourquoi triste, John ” said I,
knowing the language.
“Well, it's like this,” said John,
“the time has come when you and I
must look for a job.”
“That's all right,” said I cheerfully.
“We'll go and see the Advisory Com-
mittee. They'll put us up to a job in
civil life. They're sitting there bubbling
over with advice. Employers in Eng-
land are simply falling over one an-
other to find positions for brave young
officers who ->
“Yes, I don't think,” remarked John
very sceptically. “I went to see the
Advisory Committee two days ago. Per-
haps I was rather unfortunate in arriv-
ing at the same time as the English mail;
anyhow I came away with the following
information and convictions:—
(1) That the easiest job in civil life
is to sit on an Advisory Committee.
(2) That one is always either too old
or too young for the Civil Services.
(3) That I was a devil of a good fel-
low and I'd won the War (they patted
me on the back and told me so).
(4) That I was to fill up my A.Z.15
and trust in my stars (not the things
on my sleeve).”
“Well, what about it 2 ” I continued.
“Personally,” said John, “I think an

is the correct thing. How's this 2–
“Anybody know of a decent war?

Fortune (so-called), would like to get
in touch with anyone thinking of start-
ing a first-class war. Send full particu-

“Warriors,” c/o The Daily Telegraph.”
Mine was much more modest:—
“An officer at present in France
desires a good job in civil life. No ex-
perience, no education, no languages,
no money, no prospects and no hope.
What offers?”
“I don't think they'll bring much,”
said I. “You know, John, what we
really want is leave.”
So we applied for leave.
John asked permission to remove his
person to the U.K. for urgent and
private reasons. I stated that I had a
position offered me, but an interview
was necessary, and asked their indul-
gence for the purpose.
John's chit came back three days
later. “Will this officer state his urgent
and private reasons, please?”
“Ah!” said John, “enemy attitude
hostile.” Nevertheless he stated as
required.
Three days later it came back again
with the request that this officer fur-
ther state his reasons, please.

“STRAFE ME IF IT AIN'T ME old 'ORACE | W’Y, I AIN'T SEEN YER SINCE THAT STUNT

“Enemy attitude distinctly hostile,”
said John, and committed himself fur-
ther.
Nothing happened for a week and
John's hopes ran high. “It must be
through, old man,” he declared, “ or it
would have been back before now.”
But when at the end of the week it
came back for further information his
ardour cooled somewhat, and when,
three days later, it turned up once more
with a request for his urgent and private
reasons, John in a fit of exasperation re-
torted that if the matter was kept much
longer it wouldn't be urgent, and if they
enquired much further it wouldn't be
private. That finished him, and he got
no leave.
My application was still on the tapis.
Eventually it returned. “This officer
can be granted leave only on condition
that he promises to serve with the
Rhine Army.”
“Go on,” said John; “promise.”
So I promised.
Now, looking over the situation, we
find that it amounts to this: John has
no job and never will have till he can
get leave to look for ore. He can't get
leave. That's John.
I have a job (I haven't really) if I can
get leave to attend an interview. I've
got leave, but only on the understanding
that when I've got the job I refuse it
because I've promised to serve on the
Rhine. That's me.

MY DEAR MRs. Bon NAMY,-I am glad to report that my

fort. Indeed my housekeeper was surprised that I showed
so few traces of fatigue. This, I tell her, was due to the
kind care and consideration experienced by me throughout
my sojourn beneath your hospitable roof. - -
Please inform Miss Chance that the carriage was a

as to her own journey with her mother. -
ciated her consideration in seeing me into the train, and
trust that the weather will prove favourable for their return
to town. *
Although the week I passed in your society will always
be an agreeable memory it carries with it the penalty of
an increased sense of my solitary life, and I feel that your
remarks were not without justice.
With kind regards,
Believe me, Yours sincerely,
THos. CRABBE HERMITAGE.
Mr. Crabbe Hermitage to Mrs. Mayne Chance.
* - - April 3rd.
My DEAR MRs. MAYNE CHANCE,-Ever since my return
from the visit which gave me so much happiness in your
society and that of your dear daughter, I have wondered
whether I dared address you upon a point which concerns
me intimately. Have you reason to suppose that her affec-
tions are engaged in any quarter? Believe me that I seek
this information from no idle curiosity, but solely that I
may know whether there is any obstacle to my making a
certain proposal. I naturally shrink from intruding myself
between a mother and daughter whose companionship is so
close and am well aware of the disparity in our ages, but if
you could encourage me to proceed you would confer the
greatest happiness upon a very lonely man.
Believe me, Yours very sincerely,
Thomas CRABBE HERMITAGE.
Mrs. Mayne Chance to Mr. Crabbe Hermitage.
- April 4th.
MY DEAR Mr. CRABBE HERMITAGE,-Your letter has come
as the greatest surprise. I suppose mothers cannot expect
to keep for ever at their daughters' side, but the parting
is robbed of its bitterness when other considerations are
involved. * - -
I questioned the dear child this morning and she con-
fessed, as indeed I suspected, that she is not indifferent
to the attentions of the son of a neighbour of ours. But
anyhow there need be no obstacle in that quarter. She is
far too sensible and unselfish, as only I know. Surely
there is not such a disparity of age as you seem to think!
But perhaps I liave said too much.
Most sincerely yours,
MELiss A MAYNE CHANCE.
Mr. Crabbe Hermitage to Miss Chance.
April 5th.
MY DEAR Miss CHANCE,--I wrote to your dear mother
two days ago to endeavour to ascertain whether you would
view favourably the proposal which I wished to make.
Her reply was, on the whole, encouraging, but it is far
from being my wish that in seeking my own happiness you
should sacrifice your own. More I will not permit myself
to add until you have reassured my mind.
Believe me, Your sincere Friend,
THos. CR \BBE HERMITAGE.
I much appre-|
From Miss Chance to Mr. Crabbe Hermitage.
April 6th.
DEAR MR. CRABBE HERMITAGE,-Yes, mother told me all
about it, and I think it is perfectly lovely. Of course I
would never stand in the way of your happiness and you
need not consider me at all. She is so happy about it, and
of course I am too. -
Yours very sincerely, EDITH CHANCE.
From Mr. Crabbe Hermitage to Mrs. Mayne Chance.
* * , . - - - April 7th.
MY DEAR MRs. MAYNE CHANCE,--I have received a letter
from dearest Edith which removes the only obstacle to the
realization of the wish of my heart. Rest assured that
my every endeavour shall be to prove worthy of this great
happiness. If quite convenient I hope to call on the 9th
instant to offer myself in person. -
Believe me, Your sincere Friend,
THos. CRABBE HERMITAGE.
From Mrs. Mayne Chance to Mr. Crabbe Hermitage.
April, 8th.
MY DEAR THOMAs, For I must call you this without
waiting till to morrow ! I knew the dear child would share
our happiness. How could you ever doubt it? Only this
morning she said there was no one in the world she would
like better for a father than you. But I mustn't begin by
making you vain! Oh dear! I wish to-day was to-morrow.
Your MELIssa.

A GENTLE HINT.
THE Corps Commander paced thoughtfully down the street
of a half-ruined village in France and his thoughts were
pleasant; for he alone amongst all other Corps Commanders
was the owner of a cow. There was no other cow in the
whole army nearer than G.H.Q., and he pictured the envy
of brother Generals when he invited them to come in and
have a glass of milk.
The Assistant Provost-Marshal stood at his office window
and gazed out upon his garden. His thoughts were also
pleasant, for the garden belonged to him by right of billet
law, and in the garden grew strawberries rich and ripe.
The A.P.M. pictured the envy of brother A.P.M.'s when
he should ask them to a strawberry feast. -
The Corps Commander's thoughtful wanderings took
him by chance through the A.P.M.'s garden, and as he
walked he stooped now and again and picked some of the
sacred fruit.
The A.P.M. swelled with impotent anger, for the Corps
Commander was known to be “hot stuff,” and nobody
had told him “not to do it” for a very long time.
That night the A.P.M. sought the company of his friend
the R.E. officer and told his troubles.
The R.E. officer had been a journalist before the War and
had learnt to say and write rude things without offence.
He was also the owner of wood and paint and brushes.
The next morning a large notice-board reared its head
above the scarlet fruit of the strawberry bed:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 31st.—Colonel WIL-
LIAM THoRNE has the credit of eliciting
from the Government the most hopeful
statement about Peace which has yet
been made. To the hon. and gallant
Member's suggestion that May 1st
should be declared a general holiday,
if Peace was signed before that date,
Mr. BonAR LAw replied that it would
be considered.
It is fortunate that the PARLIAMENT-
ARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF TRADE
possesses a most imper-
turbable character. He is
daily bombarded with the
most diverse questions re-
garding the effects of the
Government's fiscal policy.
The paper manufacturers
are being ruined because
paper is being allowed in;
export traders are suffering
because glass bottles are
kept out; the textile trades
cannot compete with their
foreign rivals because of
the high price of olive-oil.
But for all inquirers Mr.
BRIDGEMAN has a soft an-
swer, delivered in level
tones, discouraging further
catechism.
A delightful inconsist-
ency is one of Lord HENRY
CAvendish - BENTINCK's
many claims upon the
affection of the House.
Not long ago he wrote a
book in praise of Toryism
as a democratic creed; so it
was perfectly natural that
when Mr. CECII, HARMs-
worth (a Coalition Liberal)
had explained that law and
order must be restored be-
fore an inquiry could use- Peace. “If You'RE waking, cALL ME EARLY, cALL ME EARLY, Bosan DEAR,
Fort I'M TO BE QUEEN OF THE MAY, BoSAR: I'M To BE QUEEN
OF THE MAY.”
fully be held into the causes
of the Egyptian riots Lord
HENRY should burst out with, “When
will my hon, friend begin to apply
Liberal principles?"
Mr. BottomLEY is the latest convert|
to “P.R.,” as the result of a mock-
election in which he came out top of
the poll, with the PRIME MINISTER
second, Mr. Hogg E third, and Messrs.
BALFour and Asquith among the “also
ran ; ” but Mr. BoxAR LAw, who can be
very dense when he likes, did not see
in that an argument for the general
adoption of the system.
The “Wee Frees” made a last and
unavailing attempt to defeat the new
Military Service Bill. Mr. GEORGE
THoRNE, Major HAYward and others
made great play with the PRIME MIN-
ISTER’s “No Conscription” pledge, and
Mr. NEwBould in a maiden speech de-
clared that what West Leyton had said
yesterday England would say to-morrow.
But it was noticeable that not one of
the opponents of the Bill was unwilling
to give the Government the powers they
required if they were really necessary.
Mr. CHURCHILL revealed himself in
a new rôle as a financier, and proved
to his own satisfaction that the Army
Estimates of £506,500,000 would, if pro-
perly manipulated, work out at little
more than a fourth of that amount. Be-
tween now and the Budget Mr. CHAM-

THE PROMISE OF MAY.
BERLAIN might do worse than get his
versatile colleague to explain away the
National Debt.
Tuesday, April 1st.—Twenty years
ago there used to be a not infrequent
headline in The Times, “The Duke of
Devonshire on Technical Education,”
which always struck on my frivolous
spirit with a touch of infinite prose.
It is the same nowadays, I regret
to say, with a Lords' debate on the
national resources. The Upper House
is filled with eminent financiers—men
who think in millions and who under
our glorious Constitution may not pro-
pose an expenditure of sixpence without
the consent of Tom, Dick and Harry
in the Commons—and they all talk the
most excellent good sense. But whether
such unimpeachable truisms as that
“this huge Debt is going to be a
terrible handicap to this country."
(Lord LANSDowne), or that “what
applies to private credit and private
economy may be in the main taken to
apply to public economy and also to
public credit" (Lord CREWE), are going
to have much effect upon the demands
of the Labour Party, to whom they
were directly addressed, I am rather
inclined to doubt.
It is refreshing to note, however, that
the Commons had a brief spasm of
economy. Under the fi-
nancial resolution of the
Ways and Communica-
tions Bill the new Minister
would have had almost un-
limited powers of initiating
great enterprises without
the consent of Parliament.
Mr. R. J. McNEILL alluded
(without acknowledgment
to Mr. Punch) to the hero
of Eric; or, Little by Little,
and urged that not even
“a Napoleon of adminis-
tration" ought to be
trusted with a blank
cheque. He rather spoilt
a good case by referring
to the new Minister's
financial relations with his
late employers, the North-
Eastern Railway; but his
argument was so far suc-
cessful that Mr. BonAR
LAw undertook first that
a Treasury watchdog
should be permanently
installed in the new Min-
istry, with instructions to
bark whenever he saw any
sign of extravagance; and,
secondly, that the Minister
should not have power to
initiate any enterprise in-
volving large expenditure
—he suggested a million
as a moderate limit—without the direct
sanction of Parliament.
After this achievement Members felt
that a rest was necessary. So the
Housing Bill was postponed, and after
two or three Scottish Bills had received
a second reading the House counted
itself out, and Members went to their
dinners feeling as comfortably virtuous
as the Boy Scout who has done his good
deed for the day.
|Wednesday, April 2nd.—The unem-
ployment donation was the theme of
innumerable inquiries. The MINISTER
of LABOUR was forced to admit that
Parliament had at present furnished
him with no direct authority to spend
a million or so a week on this form of
out-door relief, but hoped that it would

be kind enough to do so when the
Appropriation Bill came along. A
statement that in Ireland men were
coming for their donation in motor-
cars aroused the sympathy of Mr. JACK
Jon Es, who said that surely they were
entitled to an occasional ride, but did
not go so far as to suggest that the
Government should organise a service
of cars to be at their disposal.
A suggestion to incorporate in the
Army Annual Bill one of Dora's most
stringent regulations for the preven-
tion of criticism upon military matters
aroused much indignation. Mr. BEN
TILLETT observed that, if it were re-
tained, Lord NorthcLIFFE, Mr. Bot-
ToMLEY and even Sir HENRY
DALZIEL might soon be
conducting their various
| journals from a prison-cell.
This possibility may have
mitigated but it did not
wholly remove the objec-
tions to the clause, which
Mr. CHURCHILL ultimately
withdrew.
A debate on the popular
theme, “Make Germany
Pay !” was initiated by Col.
CLAUDE LowTHER, who not
long ago produced a specific
scheme for extracting
twenty-five thousand mil-
lions from the enemy—a
scheme which by its uncon-
ventional handling of the
rules of arithmetic excited
the amazed admiration of
professional financiers. Pos-
sibly Mr. Box AR LAw, as ex-
Chancellor of the Exchequer,
was jealous because he had
monocle for a pair of ordinary specta-
cles, which may account for his taking
a less one-sided view of this question.
Mr. T. P. O'Connor now enjoys the
distinction of being the “Father” of the
House of Commons, having sat there
uninterruptedly since the General Elec.
tion of 1880. Perhaps his new dignity
sits rather heavily on his youthful
spirit, for his speech on the Irish Esti-
mates was painfully lugubrious. He
took some comfort from a statement
in The Times that “We are all Home
Rulers now,” but as a veteran journalist
he is probably aware that what The
Times says to-day it will not necessarily
say to-morrow.

MACEDONIA.
THE Allies having won the War, and
myself having been released from the
hands of the Hun, I spent a happy
repatriation leave, and began to think
about soldiering again. My orders
were to rejoin my reserve unit in the
North of England.
Before the time came, however, a
friend of mine, an educational staff
officer in Ireland, wrote to me and
suggested that I should go over and
give him the assistance of my superior
intelligence. I replied that I would be
delighted. He then wrote:–
“My DEAR K–,-I am so pleased
that you are willing to come
over to Macedonia and help
us. You had better ask War
Office for a week's extension
of leave, by which time my
application for you will pro-
bably have filtered through.
That will save you the
trouble of rejoining your re-
serve unit.”
I thought this an excel-
lent plan and went to the
War Office to see about it.
After the customary wait
I was granted a few mo-
ments of a Staff Officer's
precious time.
“What do you want?”
said the Staff Officer. He
seemed used to meeting
people who wanted things,
and familiarity had evi-
dently bred contempt.
I humbly explained.
“Have you got a written
authority to support your
not thought of it first. At Tº. application ?" he asked.
any rate he subjected the Treasury Bulldog (to Minister of Transportation). “ERIC–NAUGHTY!" I produced my friend's
plan to so much caustic
criticism that Col. LowTHER, having
appealed in vain for the protection of
his namesake in the Chair, walked out
of the House.
Thursday, April 3rd.—Some of NA-
PolfoN's many complaints of his treat-
ment at St. Helena concerned the cost
and quality of his food. The exile of
Amerongen need have no fears on that
score should the Allies decide to remove
him to Longwood, for the present
Governor has been so successful in
keeping down the price of foodstuffs
that the merchants of the island have
petitioned for his recall.
The CHANCELLor of THE Exchequer
has so far relaxed his non-possumus atti-
tude on the joint income-tax question
as to consent to receive a deputation of
Members interested, and even to allow
them to be accompanied by a small
number of ladies. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, by
the way, has exchanged his hereditary
“Leave politics alone and give us
decent houses for our people and better
education for our children’’ was Sir
Edward CARson's prescription for
invalid Erin; and Mr. IAN MACPHERSON,
making his first speech as Chief
Secretary, indicated that he meant to
apply it. But the patient is suffering
from so many disorders at present that
she must have a tonic—with iron in
it—before her Constitution can be re-
garded as completely restored.

letter, which was endorsed
with the stamp of his Command Head-
uarters.
The Staff Officer, standing (not out
of politeness, I am sure), read the letter.
Then he looked up, suspicion in his eye
and in the cock of his head.
“I don't understand this,” he said.
“You told me you wanted to go to
Ireland. This letter distinctly refers to
your going to Macedonia.”
“Macedonial " I echoed (I had for-
gotten my friend's Biblical way of
expressing himself).

Officer. “Balkans, isn't it 2 Some-

“BOTCHES.”
AN APPEAL For GoD-PARENTs.
For many years the village of Chailey,
in Sussex—famous topographically for
possessing that conical tree which is
said to mark the centre of the county,
and for a landmark windmill of dazzling
whiteness—has been famous sociolo-
gically for its Heritage Craft Schools
of crippled boys and girls. Among the
ameliorative institutions of this country
none has a finer, record than these
schools, where ever since 1897 the work
of converting helplessness into help-
fulness has been going bravely on.
Entering as complete dependents, the
inmates leave fully equipped to earn
their living unassisted, the boys chiefly
as carpenters, and the girls as needle-
themselves to possess faculties of which
they had no notion. There is even an
armless billiard-player among them;
and I could not wish him a happier
setting for the exercise of his skill. For
here is one of the finest Y.M.C.A.
recreation halls in the country, with a
view of the South Downs that probably
no other can boast. Whether or not the
method of learning from a young cripple
the art of being an old one is novel, I
cannot say, but it has been proved to be
eminently successful; and one of its
attractions is the pride taken not only
in their mature pupils by the immature
masters but in the boys by the men.
Meanwhile, what became of the
boys whose nest was thus invaded ?
(The Girls' School and Babies' Mon-
tessori School, is half-a-mile away.)
and the founder also of the Guild of
Brave Poor Things and the Guild of
Play—Mrs. C.W. KIMMINs—who in her
quiet practical way is probably as good
a friend as London ever had—it had
long been one of her dreams that the
word “cripple” should be enlarged from
its narrower meaning to include the
crippled mind no less than the crippled
limbs. In her work in Southwark,
where the Guild of the Brave Poor
Things began, she has seen too many
children stunted and enfeebled by lack
of pure food and fresh air, who would
under better conditions grow naturally
into health and strength and even
power: “little mothers” taxed beyond
their capacity by thoughtless parents,
and all the other types of “cripple"
which the mean streets of a great city
women. In some cases
the cures effected have
been remarkable. In the
late Warseven-and-twenty
Guild boys fought in the
ranks, four of whom were
killed and are now proudly
commemorated on the
wall of the School church.
This contribution of
fighting men, together
with a certain activity in .
munition-making, is not,
however, Chailey's only
share in the War, for the
Government are using its
experience for the educa-
tion of cripples of a larger
growth. The boys have, in
short, surrendered their
comfortable old quarters

Surgical Hospital—to companies of
maimed soldiers, who aresent to Chailey
to learn how much of usefulness and fun
can still remain when limbs are miss-
ing; and, by a charming inspiration,
their teachers in this great lesson are
the boys themselves. It is no doubt
encouraging for a soldier who has lost
both arms to be told by a kindly and
enthusiastic visitor at his bedside that
all will be well, and he will be able to
manage without them; but a certain
measure of scepticism and despair may
remain to darken his waking hours.
But when a little fellow in precisely
the same plight shows him how the
disabilities have been conquered, his
zest in life begins to return. Seeing is
believing, and believing means new
endeavour. The result is that the
crippled soldiers at Chailey, taught by
the crippled boys, have been trans-
formed into happy and active men, and
not a few of them have discovered
They immediately showed what they
are made of by themselves erecting on
the ground beside the windmill a series
of Kitchener huts. There they sleep
and eat, coming hobbling down to head-
quarters for carpentering and to per-
form their strange new duties as guides,
philosophers and friends.
Another development in the Chailey
scheme of altruism that arose from the
War was, as readers of Punch will no
doubt remember, the sudden estab-
lishment of the St. Nicholas Home for
child victims of the air-raids. So sud-
den was it that within seven days of
the inception of the idea a house had
been found and furnished, a staff en-
gaged and a number of the beds were
occupied. Here, throughout the last
years of the War, terrified children
were soothed back to serenity and a
sense of security in the sky above.
And now for “Botches.” It had
long been one of the many aspirations
of the founder of the Heritage Schools,
This they enlarged and modernised;
they developed the gardens and filled

For the peopling and maintenance of
the Home a novel and very pretty device
has been invented. Everyone has heard
of the marraines of France during the
War—those ladies who made them-
selves responsible each for the comfort
of a poilu, sending him gifts of food
and cigarettes, writing him letters and
so forth. It is the marraine—or god-
mother—system which is being adopted
and adapted for “Botches.” The house

A WASTED TALENT.
FRESH knowledge of a varied kind
While in the army I acquired,
Some useful, which I didn't mind,
And much that made me tired;
But one result was undesigned;
It cost me neither toil nor care :
Swiftly and surely, with the ease
Of drinking beer or shelling peas,
War taught me how to swear.
Widely my power was recognised;
The hardiest soldier shook like
froth,
And even mules were paralysed
To hear me voice my wrath;
Unhappy he and ill-advised
Who dared withstand when I re-
viled ; ... º.
Have I not seen a whole platoon
Wilt and grow pale and almost swoon
When I was really wild?
But now those happy days are past;
A mild civilian once again,
I dare not even whisper"—!
If something gives me pain;
Barred are those curses, surging fast,
That swift and stinging repartee;
Instead of words that peal and crash
I breathe a soft innocuous “Dash!”
Or murmur, “Dearie me!”
Yet sometimes still, when on the rack
And past all due forbearance tried,
The ancient fierce desire comes back,
I seem to boil inside;
And then I take a hefty sack,
I place my head within, and thus
Loose off, in some secluded niche,
A deep, whole-hearted, grateful, rich,
Sustained, delirious cuss.

Or a trifle o' lumber from Hastings Mill . . .

But most they tramped the same old road they always

And she's fit for the seas once more,
To carry the Duster near and far,

Cozens has a conscience—a conformist conscience—and
is a first-class season-ticket holder.
The other morning we were travelling up to town
together as usual. He was evidently bursting with the
anticipatory pride of telling me something very much to
his credit. Presently, at a gap in my reading, he said:—
“I left my season at home this morning, so I bought a
return.”
“What on earth for?" I expostulated. “You’ve already
paid the company once by taking out a season; why pay
twice? And anyhow it's only the Government.”
“It's the first duty of a citizen to obey the laws of his
country,” he proclaimed sententiously. -
“Oh, all right; but you'll never get your money back
—not from the Government. Besides, you could easily
have got through without a ticket." -
“How 2 ”
“By taking out your note-case at the barrier and show-
ing the girl the back of a Bradbury. Dazzled by the display
of so much wealth, she'd pass you without a murmur.”
“A miserable subterfuge,” Cozens protested.
“Or you and I might walk up to the barrier deep in con-
versation. I should then get in front, and the examiner
would pull me up for my ticket. I should fumble before
producing my season. Meantime you would have passed
beyond recall."
“I simply couldn't do it.”
“Or why not pay at the barrier, if you must pay ?”
“Yes, and lose the return ticket rate. How should I get
down to-night?”
“That's easy. Buy a platform ticket. The man at the
gate at home will pass you; he knows you.”
“All underhand work,” said Cozens. “It's much more
dignified to buy a ticket.”
Just then a travelling inspector entered our carriage.
“Tickets, gentlemen, please!"
And Cozens, looking supremely undignified, produced a
third-class return, and tried to explain.

Little Girl (reading poster). “OH, MUMMY, ISN'T THAT v ULGAR 2 OUGHTN'T THEY TO PUT ‘PERSPIRED LABou R'?”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. CoMPTON MACKENZIE gives us in Sylvia and Michael
(SECKER) a continuation—I hesitate to say a conclusion—
of the adventures of that amazing heroine, Sylvia Scarlett,
which, being not a sequel but a second volume, needs some
familiarity with the first for its full enjoyment. Not that
anyone even meeting Sylvia for the first time in mid-
course could fail to be intrigued by the astounding things
that are continually happening to her. The variety and
piquancy of these events and the general brilliance of Mr.
MACKENZIE's colouring must keep the reader alert, curious,
scandalized (perhaps), but always expectant. His scheme
starts with an invigorating plunge (as one might say, off
the deep end) into the cabaret society of Petrograd in 1914,
where Sylvia and the more than queer company at the
pension of Mère Gontran are surprised by the outbreak of
war. ‘Incidentally, Mère Gontran herself, with her cats,
whose tails wave in the gloom “like seaweed,” and her
tawdry spiritualism—“key-hole peeping at infinity” the
heroine (or the author) rather happily calls it—is one of the
least forgettable figures in the galaxy. I have no space to
indicate what turns of this glittering kaleidoscope even-
tually bring Sylvia and Michael together during the Serbian
retreat, though there are scenes upon which I should like
to dwell, notably that of the death of Guy Hazlewood, an
incident whose admirable restraint shows Mr. MACKENZIE
at his best. One question I have to ask, and that is how
has Sylvia learnt to imitate so bewilderingly the manner-
isms of Michael? Her soliloquies especially might have
come straight from the first volume of Sinister Street, so
much more do they suggest the cloistered adolescence of
Carlington Road than a development from her own feverish
youth. While I cannot pretend that she has for me the
compelling vitality of Jenny Pearl, her adventures certainly
make (for those who are not too nice about the morals or
the conversation of their company) an exhilarating, even
intoxicating entertainment, the end of which is, I am glad
to think, still remote.
The publishers, in their preface to Mr. HUGH SPENDER's
new novel, The Seekers (CoLLINs), led me to believe that
it was written with the object of denouncing the dangers
and the frauds of spiritualism. This, however, is by no
means the case. To be sure the first few chapters do
contain an account of a séance, which serves not so much
to lay bare the mysteries of spiritualism as to bring together
a few of the characters in the novel. From that point
onward there is nothing more about spooks, save for an
occasional reference. It is when the dramatis persona:
have been well collected in and about a Yorkshire vicarage
that things really get a move on and begin to hum. No
reader is entitled to complain of a lack of excitement; the
mortality, indeed, is almost Shakspearean. Rudge, a medium,
who must not be confused with our old friend, Mr. Sludge,
perishes in a snowstorm. John Havering batters in the
head of Hubert Kenyon, and later on commits suicide, while
Beaufort, a Labour leader, is wrongfully charged with the
murder of Hubert and barely escapes with his life. Every-
thing however ends comparatively well, owing to a strong
female interest. Mr. SPENDER is usually a careful workman,
but sometimes his sentences get the better of him. Here
is one such : “She wondered if Peter, who must have seen
Mary as he came into the vicarage disappear into the study,
had gone in, hoping to find her there as he left the house.”
It is not often however that Mr. SPENDER leaves his clauses
to fight it out together like that.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
In The Golden Rope (LANE) Mr. J. W. BRODIE-INNEs has
tried to combine a tale of mystery and murder with the
love-story of a man of fifty; and, on the whole, it is a fairly
successful effort. Alan Maclean, the middle-aged one who
tells the tale, was a celebrated artist, and, when he made
his way to Devon to paint Pontylanyon Castle, he little
expected to find himself involved in a maze of intrigue and
adventure. The castle, however, was owned by a lady of
great but unfortunate possessions. In the first place she
had a dual personality (and, believe me, it is the very deuce
to have a dual personality); and, secondly, she possessed
a crowd of relatives (Austrian) who wanted her estate and
were ready to remove mountains and men to get it. I know
nothing of Mr. Maclean's pictures except that I am assured
by the author that they were exquisitely beautiful, but I do
book is, in compressed form, a survey of the Indian Empire
that deserves the epithet “exhaustive"; history, races, relig-
ious castes and forms of local government are all intimately
surveyed; the chapters on the India Office and (especially)
the army in India will command wide attention both
among experts and the general public. Naturally the word
“experts” brings me to the controversial side of the subject,
the much discussed Montagu-Chelmsford Report, concern-
ing which the late C.-in-C. holds views that might fairly be
described as pronounced. Where authorities differ the
honest reviewer can but record impartially. Really we
have here the old antagonism between the upholder of one
school of Imperial thought, fortified by many years' experi-
ence of its successful application, and the theories of a
newer and more experimental age. Without attempting
know that Mr. INNES's own canvas
suffers from overcrowding, and,
although I admire the deft way in
which he handles his embarrass-
ment of figures, his task would
have been less complicated and
my enjoyment more complete if
he had managed to do with fewer.
Otherwise I can recommend The
Golden Rope both for its exciting
episodes, lavish of thrills, and
for the warning it gives to men
of fifty to stick to their pigments,
or whatever their stock-in-trade
may be.
The Cinderella Man (Hodder
AND SToughton), “a romance of
youth,” by HELEN and Edward
CARPENTER, is more suited; to the
ingenuous than the sophisticated
reader. Its hero is a poet, Tony
Quintard, very poor and deathly
proud. The scene is set in New
York and largely in Tony's attic
verse-laboratory, which Marjorie, .
the rugged millionaire's daughter, º
visits by way of the leads in a ºf
perfectly proper if unconventional | #ſº
mood. The idiom occasionally ſ!"
soars into realms even higher.

a judgment on its conclusions, I
can safely agree with the pub-
lishers that this is a book that
|“will be read with special interest
in military, diplomatic and Govern-
ment circles"; also – my own
postscript—more vociferously de-
bated in certain club smoking-
rooms than almost any volume
of recent years.
A “Literary Note” thoughtfully
inserted in the fly-leaves of The
Elstones (HUTCHINson) informs me
that it will “make a strong ap-
peal to all those who have ex-
perienced the suffering caused by
religious conflict.” It is not en-
= |tirely because it has been my lot
to escape the ordeal in question
that Miss Isabel, C. CLARKE's
* | latest book failed to make the
promised appeal. She takes two
hundred and odd pages of pecu-
liarly eye-racking type to convert
the Eistone family to Catholicism
without indicating in any way
how or why her solemn puppets
are inspired to change their beliefs.
Now and again a completely nebul-
ous cleric happens along to per-
form the necessary function of
receiving a moribund neophyte
into the Church ; otherwise the
gentle Marjorie, reading out one of Tony's efforts—
“Love whose feet are shod with light
Lost this ribbon in her flight;
Rosette of the twilight sky,
Waft to me Love's lullaby!”
(the note of exclamation is Tony's), says, “Anyone who
can write songs like that ought to write an opera,” you
realise that her heart is sounder than her pretty head.
Anyway Tony, who needed no encouragement, wrote his
opera and landed a ten-thousand dollar prize for same,
together with the daughter of the millionaire, who began
to see, no doubt, that there might be something in poetry
after all.
Indian Studies (HUTCHINsoN) one may call a work partly
descriptive and historical, partly also polemic. Its author,
General Sir O'MooRE CREAGH, V.C. (and so many other
letters of honour that there is hardly room for them on the
title page), writes with the powerful authority of forty years'
Indian service, five of them as Commander-in-Chief. His
conversion appears to take place as it were by spontaneous
combustion and not as the result of any visible proselytising
agency. However the Elstones bear no resemblance to real
human beings—you can hardly expect it of people called
Ierne and Magali and Ivo and Elvidia and names like that
—so perhaps it doesn't matter how they came to see the
great light. The important thing obviously from the
authoress's point of view is to get them into the fold; and
good Catholics who look at the end rather than the means
may enjoy The Elstones. As a novel it will try them hard.

THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF PEACE.
I'M not out of the Army yet, but lately I was home on
leave. At a time like that you don't really care about being
demobilised just yet. After all, to earn—or let us say to
be paid—several pounds for a fortnight's luxurious idleness
is a far, far better thing than to receive about the same
number of shillings for a like period of unremitting toil.
There you have an indication of the financial prospects of
my civvy career. None the less, to me in Blighty the
future looked as rosy as a robin's breast, and life was
immensely satisfactory. I deemed that I was capable of
saying “Ha, ha" among the captains (though myself only
boasting two pips). Then one day, in the lane that leads
to the downs, I met Woggles. -
I've known Woggles for years and years. Some time
ago she became a V.A.D. and began to drive an ambulance
about France; since when I had lost sight of her. I
greeted her therefore with jubilation.
“Oh, Woggles,” I cried, “this is a great occasion. How
shall we celebrate it 2 ”
“Well, if you like I'll go back again on to the top with
you and show you the Weald. But I'd much rather you
came home to tea. I could make some 'Dog's Delight '—

“Oh, if you put it like that,” I said cheerfully. -
Well, it was a bitter sort of afternoon and growing late.
The annoyance of Bogie (an enthusiastic puppy) at missing
his walk might appropriately be solaced with portions of
“Dog's Delight.” It’s a large home-made bun thing which
used to delight me as well as Bogie's mother in days
gone by. -
“I ought to warn you,” said Woggles as we walked
across the fields, “that Mother and Dad are out to-day. I
expect your dog'll have to take acting rank as chaperon.”
“By the way,” I said, “you don't know each other,
do you?” I called Bogie, who was giving a vivid imitation
of a cavalry screen protecting our advance, and made him
sit up and pretend.to be begging. “Now fix your eyes on
the kind lady,” I commanded. “Woggles—Bogie: Bogie
—Woggles. Two very nice people.” Bogie barked, put
out his tongue and let the wind blow his left ear inside out.
Woggles laughed in that excellent way she has.
At the Rectory she sang to me even better than she used
to ; the “Delight" was an achievement, Bogie being most
agreeably surprised; there was a glow of firelight such as
I love, and a vast comfortable chair. I felt lazy and very
happy.

serious, she went on : “I wonder—is there much to be
|happy about just now? Dad thinks not; and so do I,
rather. Do you want to talk about it, or would you rather
find faces in the fire?” -
“Please I want to talk about it.”
“Carry on then. Fortify yourself with that last bit of
“Delight.’” -
In spite of this reinforcement I found it wasn't so very
easy to begin.
“Well,” I said slowly, “I expect the foundation of my
joie de vivre is a great relief that the War's over. Lots of
troops celebrated that with song and dance and so forth on
November 11th and subsequent nights; I'm spreading it
over a much longer time. In a way it's like having a death

“Of course everyone feels that,” Woggles admitted.

of life and suffering hasn't made the world so very much
better? Look at Russia and our strikes. Doesn't Bol-

“The fact is,” I told her, “I believe I've evolved a
philosophy of life which nothing of that kind can seriously
disturb—or I hope not. It's very jolly to feel like that.”
“It must be. May we have this philosophy, please?
Perhaps you'll make a disciple.”
“It's an awfully simple one really, only I think people
lose sight of it so strangely. Just to realise the extra-

“It doesn't sound very convincing,” Woggles objected.

“No, you needn't,” said Woggles thoughtfully and looked
at me rather hard for a space. “We’re old friends, aren't

“What a question I hope we are. But why?”
“Well, I'm going to ask you something. But I may
say I'm rather nervous. You'll promise not to set Bogie
at me or strangle me with your Sam Browne?”
“I will.” - -
“Well, then, have you been asking Betty Willoughby to

I was amazed. Was Woggles also among the sooth-
sayers ? Because a few evenings earlier, with the help of

Host (to visitor just arrived). “GET You R overcoAT off QUICKLY, MAN : THEN HE'LL THINK YOU BELONG TO THE HOUSE ' "
THE PASSING OF GREEK.
A GREAT thanksgiving meeting (post-
poned till “Summer-time” on account
of the shortage of artificial heat) was
held at the Albert Hall last Saturday
to celebrate the dethronement of Greek
at Oxford. Mr. H. G. WELLs presided,
and there was a numerous attendance.
Mr. WELLs, while he struck and
maintained a jubilant note throughout
his eloquent speech, tempered enthusi-
asm with caution. The Grecians, he
said, like the Greeks, were wily folk
and capable of shamming dead while
they were all the while scheming and
plotting to restore their imperilled su-
premacy. Indeed he knew it as a
fact that some of the most infatuated
scholars actually voted against com-
pulsion, simply to confuse the issue.
Still, for the moment it was a great
victory, a crushing blow to Oxford, the
stronghold of mediaevalism, incompe-
tence and Hanoverianism, and an im-
mense relief to the sorely-tried º
sique of the nation. For he was able
to assure them, speaking with the au-
thority of one who had taken first-class
honours in Zoology, that the study of
Greek more than anything else predis-
posed people to influenza by promoting
cachexia, often leading to arterio-scler-
osis, bombination of the tympanum,
and even astigmatism of the pineal
gland. (Sensation.)
Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING, M.P.,
speaking from the seat of an aeroplane,
said that he had found the little Greek
he remembered from his school-days
not only no help but a positive hind-
rance to his advocacy of a strong Air
policy. The efforts of the Greeks
as pioneers of aviation were grossly
exaggerated and, speaking as an expert,
he denounced these literary fictions as
so much hot air. There were at least
forty-seven thousand reasons against
Greek, but he would be content with
two. It didn't pay, and it was much
harder than Esperanto.
Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUx in a most
impressive speech said that he was no
enemy of ancient learning. Egyptology
was only a less favourite recreation with
him than revolver practice. But Greek
he could never abide, and he was con-
firmed in his instinct by the fact that
at all the sixteen Courts where he had
been received and decorated Classical
Greek was practically unknown. It
was the same in his travels in Morocco,
Algeria, Kabylia, among the Touaregs,
the Senussis and the pygmies of the
Aruwhimi Hinterland. He never heard
it even alluded to. Nor had he found it
necessary for his investigations into the
secret service of Foreign Powers, the
writing of spy stories, the forecasting
of the Great War or the composition of
cinema plays. He had done his best to
procure the prohibition of the study of
Greek in the Republic of San Marino,
and he was inclined to trace the pre-
sent financial crisis in that State to his
failure. (Cheers.)
Mr. BERNARD SHAw struck a some-
what jarring note by the cynical remark
that it would be a very good thing for
modern sensational authors if Greek
literature were not only neglected but
destroyed, as some of the Classical
authors had been guilty of prospective
plagiarism on a large scale. He knew
this as a fact, as he had been recently
reading LUCIAN in a crib and found
him devilish amusing. (Uproar and
cries of “Shame!")
A moving letter was read from Lord
BEAVERBRook, in which the great finan-
cier declared that, in arriving at the
eerage at the age of thirty-seven, he

ing fact that Lord NorthcLIFFE, who
reached a similar elevation at the age
of forty, had never composed any Greek
iambics, though his literary style was
singularly polished.
It was felt that any further speeches
after this momentous announcement
would inevitably partake of the nature
of an anti-climax.
The Chairman happily interpreted
the feeling of the meeting by hurling a
copy of Liddell and Scott on the floor
of the platform and dancing upon it,
and the great assembly soon afterwards
dispersed in a mood of solemn exulta-
tion to the strains of a Jazz band. As
Mr. WELLs observed in a fine phrase,

THE MUD LARKS.
I was motoring homewards across
the old line. A ghost-peopled dusk
was crawling over the devastation and
desolation that is Vimy, and in the
distance the bare bones of St. Eloy
loomed like a spectre skeleton against
the frosty after-glow. We hummed
past Thélus cross-roads, dipped down-
hill and, hey presto 1 all of a sudden I
was in China. (No, not Neuville-St.-
Vaast; China, China, place where they
eat birds'-nests and puppy-dogs' tails.)
There were coolies from some salvage
company all over the place, perched
on heaps of broken masonry, squatting
along the ditch side, banked ten-deep
in the road—tall villainous - looking
devils, very intently watching some-
thing. I pulled up, partly to avoid
killing them and partly to see what it
was all about. -
It was an open-air theatre. They
had built it on the ruins of an estam-
inet, roofed it over with odds and ends
of tin and tarpaulin, and the play was
on. There was the orchestra against
the back - cloth, rendering selections
from popular Pekin revues on the
drum, cymbal and one-stringed fiddle.
There were the actors apparelled in the
gorgeous costumes of old Cathay strut-
ting mechanically through their parts,
the female impersonators squeaking in
shrill falsetto and putting in a lot of
subtle fan-work. And there was the
ubiquitous property-man drifting in
and out among the performers, setting
his fantastic house in order. We were
actually within a mile of the Vimy
Ridge, but we might have been away
| on the sunny side of Suez, deep within
the mysterious heart of Canton City.
“Good as a three-ring circus, ain't
it?” said an English voice at my side;
“most of their plays run on for nine
months or so, but this particular show
only lasts six weeks, the merest curtain-
raiser.”
I turned towards the speaker and
looked full upon the beak nose, cleft
cheek and bristling red moustache of an
old friend. “Good Lord, The Beach-
comber ' " I breathed. He started,
peered at me and growled, “Captain
Dawnay-Devenish, if it's all the same
to you, Mister blooming Lieutenant.”
In the year 1907 John Fanshawe
Dawnay-Devenish arrived in a certain
Far Eastern port, deck passenger aboard
a Dutch tramp out of Batavia. The
Wolendam mate accompanied him to
the gang-plank, shaking a size eleven
fist: “Now yous, get, see? . . . an' iv
}. gome bag . . . . " He ground his
orse-teeth and made unpleasant noises
in his throat.
“Shouldn't dream of risking it, old
dear,” replied John Fanshawe plea-
santly, “not on your venerable coffee-
grinder anyhow—not until she gets a
navigator.” He kissed his nicotined
fingers to the exploding Hollander and
strolled off down the wharf, whistling
“Nun trink ich Schnapps.”
Arrived in the European quarter he
smoothed what creases he could out of
his sole suit of drills, whitened his
soggy topee and frayed canvas shoes
with a piece of chalk purloined from
a billiard saloon, bluffed a drink out
of an inebriated ship's engineer and
snatched a free lunch on the strength
of it. Thus fortified he visited the
British Consul, and by means of some-
what soiled letters proved that he really
was a Dawnay-Devenish of the Dorset
Dawnay-Devenishes (who should be in
no way confused with the Devenish-
Dawnays of Chipping-Banbury or the
Devenishe-d'Awnay-Dawnays of Upper
Tooting ; the Dorset branch alone
possessing the privilege, granted by
letters patent of ETHELRED the Un-
ready, of drinking the King's bath-
water every Maunday Tuesday of Leap
Year). -
Awed by the name—was there not a
Dawnay-Devenish occupying a plump
armchair in the Colonial Office at the
time?—the Consul parted with five
hundred dollars (Mex.). Next time the
yield was not so satisfactory, not by
two hundred and fifty dollars. At the
end of a month, the Consul having
proved a broken reed only good for five-
dollar touches at considerable intervals,
it behoved our hero to seek some fresh
source of income. He cast up - river
in search of it and disappeared from
civilised ken for seven merciful years.
In June, 1914, he beat back into port
in a fancifully decorated junk, minus
one ear and two fingers, but plus a
cargo of jingling genuine money. He
hired the bridal suite in the leading
hotel, got hold of a fleet of motor cars
and a host of boon companions, lived
on a diet of champagne cocktails and
splashed himself about with the care-
free abandon of a dancing dervish.
By the middle of July he was “on
the beach " again and once more began
to haunt the Consular office babbling of
his influential relations and his “tem-
porary embarrassment.”
When war broke out he had thrown
up the sponge altogether and “gone
yellow "; was living from hand to
mouth among the Chinese. At the end
of August a ship touched at that Far
Eastern port, picking up volunteers for
the Western Front. The port con-
tributed a goodly number, but there
remained one berth vacant. The long-
suffering Consul had a stroke of inspir-
ation. Here was a means of at once
swelling the man-power of his country
and ridding himself of a pestilent ne'er-
do-well. His boys, searching far and
wide, discovered John Fanshawe in the
back premises of a Malay go-down,
oblivious to all things, and bore him
inanimate aboard ship.
In this manner did our hero answer
The Call.
In due course he appeared in our
reserve squadron and was detailed to
my troop. It did not take me many
days to realise that I was up against
the most practised malingerer in the
British (or any other) army. Did a
fatigue prove too irksome; did the
jumps in the riding-school loom too
large; did the serjeant speak a harsh
word unto him, “The Beachcomber"
promptly went sick. Malaria was his
long suit. By aid of black arts learned
during those seven years sojourning
with the heathen Chinee he could
switch malaria (or a plausible imitation
of it) on or off at will and fool the
M.O.'s every time. I used to interview
them about it, but got scant sympathy.
The Healers' Union brooks no inter-
ference from outsiders.
“Look here, that brute's bluffing
you,” I would protest.
To which they would make reply,
“Can you give us any scientific ex-
planation of how a man can fake his
pulse and increase his temperature to
102° by taking thought? You can't 2
No, we didn't suppose you could. Good
day.” - -
ène person, however, I did succeed
in convincing, and that was the C.O.,
who knew his East. “Wery good,”
said he. “If the skunk won't be trained
he shall go untrained. He sails for
France with the next draft.” -
Nevertheless our friend did not sail
with the next draft. Ten minutes after
being warned for it, the old complaint
caught him again, and when the band
played our lads out of barracks he was
snugly tucked away in sick bay with
sweet girl W.A.D.'s coaxing him to
nibble a little calves-foot jelly and keep
his strength up. Nor did he figure
among either of the two subsequent
drafts; his malaria wouldn't hear of it.
I went back to the land of fireworks
at the head of one of these drafts
myself, freely admitting that John
Fanshawe had the best of the joke. He
waved me farewell out of the hospital
window by way of emphasising this.
The Babe followed me out shortly
after, bringing about fifty men with
him. He strolled into Mess one even-
ing and mentioned quite casually that
The Beachcomber was in camp.
“How did you manage it 2 " we
chorused in wonder.

He came all the way as baggage.”
Thus did John Fanshawe complete
the second stage of his journey to the
War. He did not remain with us long,
however; a fortnight at the most.
We were doing some digging, at the
time, night-work, up forward, in clay
so glutinous it would not leave the
shovels and had mainly to be clawed
out by hand—filthy, back-breaking,
heart-rending labour. On calling the
roll one dawn I found that The Beach-
comber was missing.
“Anybody seen anything of him 2"
I asked. -
“Yessir, I did,” a man replied, and
spat disgustedly.
“Well,” I inquired, “was he hit or
anything?”
The man grunted, “No, Sir; I don't
think 'e was 'it ; I think 'e was fed up.
“Call this war, do they?’ says 'e to
me. “I call it blawsted work ' ' I told
'im to get on wiv it an’ do 'is whack.

Red Cross outfit in the valley; think
I'll be totterin' along there,' says 'e.
“So long.' And that was the last the
regiment saw of its Beachcomber.
“Have it as you like, Captain Dawnay-
Devenish,” I said, “but before I go
tell me, how did you wangle this job?”
“Any affair of yours?” he sneered.
“No,” I admitted; “still I'm inter-
ested.”
He laughed unpleasantly. “Yes, you
would be. Always infernally keen on
minding my business for me, weren't
you? Well, if you must know, I was
convalescing when these same Chows
started a pogrom in the next camp.
I stopped it, and the powers—who were
scared stiff—tacked a stripe on me and
told me to carry on.”
“That accounts for the stripe,” said
I; “but what of the stars 2"
“Oh, them | We were behind the
line down south last year laying a toy
railway when the Hun broke clean
through in a fog. Remember? I pulled
the Chinks together and
'em. That's all.”
“Good Lord, that wasn't you, was
it 2 " I cried. “Set about 'em with
picks and shovels, shrieking Chinese
war-cries and chopped 'em to bits.
Oh, splendid But how on earth did
you rouse these tame coolies to it?”
The Beachcomber tugged his red
moustache and laughed deprecatingly.
“It wasn't very difficult really. You
see, these birds of mine are only tem-
porary coolies. In civilian life they're
mostly river pirates, Tong-fighters and
suchlike professional cut-throats. Kill-
ing comes natural to 'em. They only
wanted somebody who could organize

ES S E N C E OF P A R L I A M E N T.
Sultan Addison (his mind on the house famine). “TELL ME THE STORY OF THE PALACE BUILT IN A sing LE NIGHT."
Monday, April 7th.—The FIRST CoM-
MIssionER of WoRKs is determined that
there shall be no slack time in the
furniture-removing industry. To that
end he is arranging that the business-
premises in Kingsway now being va-
cated by the Government shall be filled
by the Commission Internationale de
Ravitaillement, that the Commission's
old premises shall then be occupied by
the Air Ministry, and that the Hotel
Cecil shall then be restored to its origi-
nal owners—unless, of course, it should
be wanted by the Department lately
housed in Kingsway. “Musical chairs,”
muttered Colonel WEDGwood.
That was not the hon, and gallant
Member's only contribution to the
gaiety of the proceedings. He essayed
to move the adjournment in order to
discuss the situation of our troops in
Russia, but was reminded that there
was already a motion on the Order
Paper dealing with that subject and
standing in his own name. An attempt
to perform the difficult manoeuvre of
getting out of his own light was frus-
trated by the SPEAKER, who, to the
argument that the motion on the Paper
dealt with a wider subject, replied
“Majus in se minus continet.” Over-
whelmed by this display of erudition,
the victim murmured “Der Tag (" and
collapsed.
In moving the Second Reading of the
Housing Bill Dr. ADDIsoN thought it
necessary to disclaim any intention of
posing as “an Oriental potentate,”
modestly adding, “I do not look the
part.” He has, however, one character-
istic of the Eastern ruler, namely, a
delight in long stories. It took him
two hours to tell the House in melan-
choly monotone all about the defects
of our present system and his proposals
for removing them. Unfortunately he
has not the Oriental gift of transform-
ing slums into palaces in a single night,
but hopes to produce a similar effect
by treating the local authorities with
a judicious mixture of subsidies and
ginger.
Tuesday, April 8th.-Congratulations
to Lord AskwitH on taking his seat in
the House of Lords and condolences
(in advance) to those foreign journals
which will inevitably announce that
the ex-PRIME MINISTER has overcome
his objections to taking a peerage.
Lord BUCKMASTER's futile attempt to
resist the passage of the Military Ser-
vice Bill was chiefly remarkable for his
epigrammatic description of the present
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR–"a
man of great capacity, a man of most
restless and versatile energy and un-
conquerable will, and of the most vivid
and most illimitable and elusive vision
of any politician of recent time.”
Several public schoolmasters, I under-
stand, have already noted its possibili-
ties as a suitable extract for translation
into Tacitean Latin.
Lord CURzoN hastened to assure Lord
BUCKMASTER that, though deprived of
his co-operation, the present Cabinet
thought itself equal to coping with
Mr. CHURCHILL. As for the Bill, there
were still storm-clouds over Europe that
might break at any moment; and every
threatened nationality was uttering the
same cry, “Send us British troops.”
Although we could not respond to all
these appeals, we must have the power
to give aid when the circumstances
required it.
Some of our warriors are already ex-
periencing the horrors of peace. Mr.
CHURCHILL has promised searching in-
quiry into the case of the officer who
sent a hundred - word telegram — at
Government expense—about a dog;
and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, on his attention
being called to the forty-three motor-
cars still in use by the War Office, gave
an answer which implied an impending
slump in joy-rides.
Sir MARTIN CoNway's anxiety that
an “archaeologically-qualified official”
should be entrusted with the duty of
protecting the ancient monuments of
Mesopotamia was relieved by Mr.
FISHER. Such an official had already
been sent out—not from the War Office,
where all the “archaeologically quali-

fied” are presumably too busy—but
from the British Museum. Part of his
work had been kindly done for him by
the German scientists, who had col-
lected ninety cases of specimens, now
in our hands. The removal of bricks
or other antiquities had long been for-
bidden—rather a blow to Dr. ADDIsoN,
who in the present shortage of building
material is very envious of the new
Bavarian Government with a bricklayer
at its head.
Wednesday, April 9th.-In the Com-
mons Dr. MACNAMARA announced that
the Admiralty did not propose to per-
petuate the title “Grand Fleet” for
the principal squadron of His Majesty's
Navy. The Grand Fleet is now a part of
the history that it did so much to make.
On the Third Reading of
the Ministry of Health Bill
Mr. J. H. THoxi.As made a
rather ungracious allusion to
the Local Government Board.
De moribundis nil misi bonum
should have been his motto,
especially as the old Depart-
ment has done splendid work
(and never better than in re-
cent times under Sir HoRACE
Monro) for the health and
comfort of His Majesty's
lieges.
If words were as effective S –
as bullets the Bolshevist Gov-
ernment in Russia would have
but a brief existence. The
rumour that LENIN had made
overtures to the Allies moved
Mr. CLEM Edwards to a dis- *-
play of virtuous vituperation
that Mr. BottomLEY found
it difficult to equal, though he
did his best. Even Colonel
Wedgwood, though he evidently thinks
we ought to make peace with LENIN,
indignantly repudiated the suggestion
that he himself is a Bolshevist. To-
wards the close of the evening the
HoME SECRETARY declared that no pro-
posals from LENIN had reached our
delegates in Paris—a statement which,
if made a few hours earlier, would have
rendered the debate superfluous. In
his opinion the proposals, whatever
they may be, had been “made in
Germany" and should be excluded as
goods of enemy origin. His statement
that he was deporting Bolshevists
every day was satisfactory so far as it
went, but left the House wondering
how they had been permitted to get
here. -
Thursday, April 10th.-The House
does not feel quite the same without its
Box AR, who has once more flown off
to Paris. Question after Question was
“postponed " for his return. We were
informed, however, that the delay in
-
releasing Charles the First from intern-
ment was due to the necessity of repair-
ing sundry damages to his fabric, due,
I understand, not to Zeppelins or
Gothas, but to the corroding tooth of
Time.
Several Questions regarding an explo-
sive magazine at Dinas Mawddwy have
lately been addressed to the Ministry
of Munitions. Hitherto they have re-
ceived rather cryptic replies, no one in
the Department apparently being pre-
pared to pronounce the name. But
this afternoon Mr. HoPE, after a few
preliminary sentences to get his voice
into condition, boldly blurted out,
“Dinnus Mouthwy,” and received the
tribute which the House always pays
to true courage.

Mr. GEoRGE LAMBERT has accepted the

with Colonel GoDFREY Collins and
Mr. ALBION Richardson as his atten-
dant Whips, duly took his seat upon
the Front Bench. Someone challenged
the intrusion of non-Privy Councillors
into that sacred precinct. But the
SPEAKER dismissed the objection with
the remark, “There is more room upon
that bench than on any other, you
know.” It is expected that, in contra-
distinction to the “Wee Frees,” the
new Party will be known as the “Auld
Lichts." —
“It is impossible to plough on account of

GoverNMENT unemployees at present
engaged in drawing their weekly dona-
tion are requested to call at the Labour
Exchange every day at 10 A.M. Morn-
ing dress.
It is not permissible for applicants to
send their wives, valets or chauffeurs to
represent them.
Smoking is not prohibited, but appli-
cants are requested not to offer tobacco,
cigarettes or cigars to the officials.
Arrangements are to be made to
provide entertainment by means of
concert parties and motor-trips; also
newspapers and periodicals, in which,
to avoid annoyance, the “Situations
Vacant ’’ column has been
blacked out.
It is desirable that appli-
cants should not wear fur
coats. The present fashion
does not go beyond a grey
tweed lounge suit, with white
spats and velours hat.
A limited number of open-
ings are offered to any who
care to act as batmen to un-
employed munition-workers. |
A doctor is in future to
be kept at every Labour Ex-
change to render first-aid to
those who should be offered
a situation.
Applicants are requested
not to tease the officials.

THE decision of The Westminster

the contrary there is every indication
that they are rising and will still rise,

All guinea-pigs and guinea-fowls will

In the best profiteering circles cigars

A well-known orchestral leader states
that there is a serious movement afoot
to popularise “The Dear Home Land”
as an encore for the National Anthem.
The legal profession has long been
concerned by the fact that lawyers' fees
remain so fixed in a world given over
to flux. It has now been decided that,
although the fees shall remain the
same, less value shall be given. For

The only redeeming feature abou
the whole nerve-racking business was
that he found me as soon as he did.
“Good afternoon, Sir,” he said in a
most ingratiating voice. “What can
me out of that tight corner at Guille-
mont. That was a valuable bit of work,
Sergeant, but nothing to this—simply
nothing!”
The solicitous curve had straightened
out from his broad shoulders. His
hands had ceased their soothing mas-
sage. His heels were together, his arms
glued to his sides, his eyes glaring at a
fixed point directly over the top of my
head. - -
“Thought it was you, Sir, as soon as
I saw you. But of course I wasn't
going to say anything till you did.” It
was not the ingratiating voice now, but
that rasping half-whisper he always
used for nocturnal conferences in the
front line. “Never heard anything of

Thank you, Sir, Good day, Sir.”
And Sergeant Steel (D.C.M. and four
chevrons) bowed me into the street.

Mr. HARold BEGBIE’s Life of the

has laid it on one side in order to col-
laborate with Sir ARTHUR ConAN Doy LE
in the authoritative biography of Sir
OLIVER LODGE. It is understood that
of the chapters dealing with the phy-

the subject Mr. HARold BEGBIE will
be exclusively responsible for those on
the frontal regions of Sir OLIVER's crani-
um, while Sir ARTHUR ConAN Doyle
will devote himself to the occipital Hin-
terland. In this way it is hoped that the
whole area, which is enormous, will be
adequately covered. The book will be

POLLY.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. KIPLING.)
I weNT into a private 'ouse to get a place as cook;
The lady ups an' greets me with a most angelic look:
“I’ve just been makin' tea,” she sex, “I’opes as you will try
These little scones wot I 'ave baked;” and to myself sez I:
“It was Polly this, an' Polly that, an’ ‘Polly, scrub
the floor,'
But it's “If you please, Miss Perkins,' since we won
the bloomin' War;
We won the bloomin' War, my girls, we won the
bloomin' War,
It's “If you please, Miss Perkins,' since we won
the bloomin' War.”
The lady she was out to please; we talked about the
weather, - -
An' when the tea was done we smoked a cigarette together,
An' then we talked o' jazzin'an' the BILLIE CARLETON case,
An' so we come in course o' time to talkin' o' the place.
“You won't mind cookin' lunch 2 ” sez she. Sez I, “With-
out a doubt,
On Toosdays an' on Fridays, which they ain't my 'alf-days
out ;
An' dinner, too, I'll manage”—'ere the lady give a grin–
“On Mondays an' on Thursdays, which they'll be my
evenings in.”
“An' wot about the breakfast?” “Don’t you worry, mum,”
sez I, . . . . -
“I’m willin' to oblige you every single blessed dye,
Bar Sundays, when my young man comes; 'e's such a
bloomin' toff, -
'E takes me up the river, so I takes the 'ole day off.”
“That's excellent,” the lady sez, “I’ll easy do the rest,
So if you come, Miss Perkins, you will be our honoured
guest,
For Mr. Were de Were an' I do all we can an' more
To please the splendid women wot'ave bin an' won the War.”
Well, seein’ as the lady seemed to 'ave the proper view,
I took the situation an' I'opes as it will do.
Of course there may be drawbacks, but you can't get all
you wish,
For aprons ain't quite overalls an' cookin' ain't munish.
It was Polly this, an' Polly that, an’ “Ugh ! the
mutton's red; ” -
But it's “Won't you come, Miss Perkins?” now
we're paid to stay in bed;
An' it's Polly this, an' Polly that, an’ anythink you

“An on-shore wind was needed to carry the fog-screen in advance

ditions, and on April 23 they were not all present.”—Cologne Post.

CRITICISM IN EXCELSIS.
THERE was a good deal of excitement in the Elysian
Fields when the news went round that the Committee had
exercised their power of electing a certain distinguished
Shade to full membership of the Asphodel Club without
a ballot. The general opinion seemed to be that the Com-
mittee had acted wisely, and that the election was in
every way justified. A few members, however, expressed
disapproval, not so much on account of any demerits of
his own as of the effect that his election might produce on
the sensitive minds of some who were already members.
“This Dr. SAMUEL Johnson,” said one who had been
busy in canvassing opinions, “is fully qualified for mem-
bership, but I fear he may have a deleterious effect on JoHN
MILTON and Thomas GRAY. Did he not roughly criticise
them in his Lives of the Poets, and do you think that
MILTON is one who will sit down tamely under the affront ?
MILTON has been for years and is still one of our most
distinguished members. Indeed, he has almost the standing
amongst us of a highly-respected Bishop. He uses the
Club a great deal, and I fear his comfort will be much
reduced by the admission of one who regards his poetry
with a hostile eye.”
“In what way,” said another, “has the denouncer of
SALMASIUs become entitled to complain of rough attacks?
Nor has his character been assailed. In that he remains
episcopal. Only in his poetry is he made to suffer.”
“But he is made to suffer pretty heavily,” said a third.
“Hear what Johnson said with regard to our friend's
Lycidas:–
“‘One of the poems on which much praise has been
bestowed is Lycidas; of which the diction is harsh, the
rhymes uncertain and the numbers unpleasing. What
beauty there is we must therefore seek in the sentiments
and images. It is not to be considered as the effusion of
real passion; for passion runs not after remote allusions
and obscure opinions. Passion plucks no berries from the
º and ivy, nor calls upon Arethuse and Mincius, nor
tells of rough satyrs and fauns with cloven heel. Where
there is leisure for fiction there is little grief.
“‘In this poem there is no nature for there is no truth;
there is no art for there is nothing new. Its form is that
of a pastoral: easy, vulgar and therefore disgusting.’
“Do you call that criticism 2"
“Ah, but listen,” said another and much agitated Shade,
“to what he says of our respected THOMAS GRAY. The
Committee must have forgotten how it goes:—
“These odes are marked by glittering accumulation of
ungraceful ornaments; they strike rather than please; the
images are magnified by affectation, the language is laboured
into harshness. The mind of the writer seems to work
with unnatural violence. Double, double, toil and trouble.
He has a kind of strutting dignity and is tall by walking
on tiptoe.”
The agitated Shade was about to proceed further with
his protest when a sound of cheering stopped him. And
lo and behold ! an approving throng was circling round the
new member, and in the thick of it were JoHN MILTON and
THOMAS GRAY.
“For this Relief,” etc.
From a Girl Guides' report:-
“The thanks of the Association are due to the following ladies
who have resigned . . .”
“Sir George Newman and Mr. Philip Snowden have resigned their
membership of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic).
Caruso has sung at 550 performances.”—Evening Paper.
All the same, there seems to have been a lack of harmony.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
My War Eaſperiences in Two Continents (MURRAY) is made
up of the diary and letters of Miss MACNAUGHTAN, written
during her search for work that might help in the great
Task. The book, it is sad to say, must serve as her
memorial to those many whom she has amused by her
bright and wholesome stories. Worn out by labours and
quests beyond her strength she fell sick at Teheran in 1916
and returned to England to die. In 1914 she had done
fine service with her soup-kitchen in Flanders, where her
energy and almost too tender sympathy had full scope and
the reward of good work accomplished. She seemed also
to be happy in her lecture tour on her return to England,
trying to arouse the sluggish-minded to a sense of the gravity
of the business. But in her Russian and Persian adventure
it is clear that she was deeply disappointed at feeling herself
unwanted and useless in a region of waste and muddle. It
is probable that for all her courage and unselfish devotion
she was too sensitive to the suffering she encountered ever
to attain the routine indifference which makes work among
such horrors possible. Her deep religious convictions
aggravated rather than eased that suffering. She was
honestly old-fashioned and never took quite kindly to the
khaki-breeched free-spoken young women of the subsidiary
war services, had a hatred of muddle and was a little severe
on men, though acknowledging that “young men are the
kindest members of the human race.” True this, I should
say, who am no longer young. “The war is fine, fine,
FINE, though I don't get near the fineness except in the
pages of Punch.” Charming of her to say that.
The heroine of Miss Fingal (BLAckwood) is called by
her publishers “a woman whose distinguishing trait is
femininity,” to which they add, with obvious truth, “a re-
freshing creation in these days.” Really, in this one
phrase Messrs. BLAckwood have covered the ground so
comprehensively that I have little more to do than sub-
scribe my signature. To fill in details, Mrs.W. K. CLIFFoRD's
latest is a quietly sympathetic tale about a lonely gentle-
woman (this you can take either as one or two words)
rescued from a life of penury by the will of a rich uncle,
transferred from her tiny flat in Battersea to Bedford Square
and a country cottage, expanding in prosperity, and gen-
erally proving the old adage that where there's a will
there's a way, indeed several ways, of spending the result
agreeably. As I have said, it is all the gentlest little
comedy of happiness, not specially exciting perhaps. I
find it characteristic of Mrs. CLIFFord's method that the
only at all violent incident, a railway smash, happens dis-
creetly out of sight, and does no more than provide its
victim with an enjoyable convalescence, and the attentive
reader with the suggestion of a psychological problem that
is both unnecessary and unconvincing. The best of the
tale is its picture of Miss Fingal herself, rescued from
premature decay and gradually recovering her youth under
the stimulus of new interests and opportunities. Whether

the now rather too familiar Kaiser-er-machina solution was
needed in order to rid the stage of a superfluous character
is open to question; but at all events it leaves Miss Fingal
happy in companionship and assured of the success that
waits upon a satisfactory finish. -
“How can I"—I seem to hear the author of Elizabeth
and Her German Garden communing with herself—“how
can I write a story, with all my necessary Teutonic ingre-
dients in it, which shall be popular even during the War?"
And then I seem to see the satisfaction with which she
hit upon the solution of inventing pretty twin girls of
seventeen, an age which permits remarks with a sting in them
to be uttered apparently in innocence and yet is marriage-
able or, at any rate, engageable; making them orphans;
giving them a German father and an English mother, and
very mixed sympathies, in which England predominates;
and sending them to America to pass its novelty under their
candid European eyes. Much of the satisfaction which
her scheme must have given to the authoress of Christopher
figure; without her it would be just as entertaining and
exciting, if perhaps less completely furnished for Romance.
While reading “Q" Boat Adventures (JENKINs) I kept
on telling myself that it ought to be read in small doses if
the greatest enjoyment was to be got from it; but all the
same I could not let it out of my hands. “The 'Q' boat,”
says Lieutenant-Commander AUTEN, V.C., “was a “stunt'
possible only to a nation of sailors. Officers might be found
for ‘Q' boats in any country with a seaboard; but men—
no; ” and I imagine that few Englishmen will be found to
deny this statement. Elizabethan days for all their spaci-
ousness contained nothing more incredibly brave than the
exploits of these decoy boats, exploits which could only
be carried out if absolutely every man taking part in them
played his rôle to perfection. And it cannot be too widely
noted that after the Huns had become suspicious the “Q"
boat had to invite a torpedo as a preliminary to real busi-
ness. Officers and men alike deserve all the gratitude their
nation can give them, not only for their courage in action,
and Columbus (MAC-
MILLAN) is shared by
its readers, although
the feeling that it has
been made to order to
fit a difficult market
is never absent. For
much of the dialogue,
and often when most
amusing, does not ring
true, and we are occa-
sionally asked to be-
lieve that the twins
could be far slower in
the uptake than at

show themselves to be.

lant preface to Billy McCoy (CASSELL), observes that such
reviewers as “may find time to skip through its pages.”
will probably call it a Romance. Well, skipping or not, here
is one reviewer who will not disappoint him. A story of a
hero who adventures into sinister-places, disregards repeated
warnings to “go back ere it is too late” (or the American
for that entrancing formula), meets there a Distressed
Damsel and kisses her as introduction, and finally, after
an infinity of perils, is left with the D.D. as his B.B., or
blushing bride—this I state emphatically to be not only
Romance, but a most excellent brand of that article.
What however Mr. CULLEY seems most to fear is that
we shall think that McCoy himself and the whole setting
(New Mexican scenes) are all make-believe. He need have
had no such alarm in my case. I have, I remember, already
commented on the admirable reality of his cowboys, as
exemplified in the hero of a previous story. Billy, if just
a little less convincing, is in many ways a worthy com-
panion. But Mr. CULLEY's heroines always strike me as
inferior to his men. They have the air of hanging about in
corners of the tale, and generally of being rather a nuisance
than a delight to their creator. But the heroine of Billy
McCoy makes hardly a pretence of being other than a lay
nation of short memories, but it is impossible to believe
that our “Q" boats will ever be forgotten.
Anything more Pettridgian than The Bustling Hours
(METHUEN) cannot be conceived and cannot certainly be
written. That means that Mr. PETT RIDGE's latest book
will be heartily welcomed and thoroughly enjoyed by the
large circle of his readers. Mr. PETT RIDGE is as good as
a tonic in these depressing days, and without any effort he
keeps at a high level of sane cheerfulness. His heroine is
a certain Dorothy Gainsford, who has the gift of turning
up at exactly the right moment and of getting exactly the
right thing done, or more often of doing it herself. She
really is a marvel and the last word in efficiency. There
is only one thing at which I hint a doubt or hesitate dis-
like. She takes a banjo with her to a picnic on the Upper
Thames. -

Then came a still small voice which said,

Told her that second thoughts were best;

THE SPOIL-SPORT.
Mr. Phillybag was demobilised. The Day had come.
For months he had dreamed of the possibility—had imag-
ined the joy and alacrity with which he would doff his cap,
tunic and trousers, service dress, one each, and resume the
decent broadcloth of a successful City solicitor. Strangel
enough, however, once he was actually demobilised he
found himself in no hurry to lose the garb which showed
that he, Mr. Phillybag, had helped, you know, to put the
kybosh on the KAISER. He was proud too of the corporal's
stripes which he had gained in a very short Army career.
That explains why he was in uniform this morning in his
office, when he opened a letter from Ernest Williams, his
former junior clerk. He remembered Williams well—how
in the early days of the War that youth had seen Lord
KITCHENER point his finger from the hoardings at him, and
there and then, discovering that the Ordnance Department
possessed a cap, size 6., which fitted him, had followed
instructions and immediately commenced to wear it. Now
he had written to Mr. Phillybag to inform him that, as he
expected to be demobilised shortly, he was calling at eleven
o'clock to discuss the question of re-entering his employ.
Mr. Phillybag rubbed his hands together in satisfaction.
He was looking forward to the interview. Since Armistice
Day he had read every article he could find written on the
subject of demobilisation and its humours; consequently
he knew exactly what he was expected to do. When
Williams entered, in all the glory of a Captain's stars,
perhaps even a Major's crown, the ribbon of the D.S.O. or
the M.C., or both, on his breast, he, Corporal Phillybag,
would spring smartly to attention, salute and address his
junior clerk as “Sir.”
He chuckled with delight as he visualised the piquant
scene. Reseating himself, he would briskly resume his
interrupted work for a moment while he kept his superior
officer waiting. Then—
“Mr. Williams to see you, Sir,” said one of his clerks.
“Show him in at once.”
On his appearance Mr. Phillybag suffered a slight recoil,
but recovered himself quickly and exchanged embarrassed,
greetings. An awkward pause followed. At length Mr.
Phillybag broke it.
“Williams,” he said severely, “I’m surprised at you.
Who ever heard of an employee returning to civil life from
the Army with a lower rank than the one his employer
holds? Four years in khaki and only a lance-corporall
You've spoiled my whole morning. It's men with careers
like yours who make the profession of humorous journalism
so precarious.”
A souvenir of coloGNE.
“AM I really awake, or is it all a beautiful dream 7”
I said, pinching myself to make sure.
At the other end of the room an unmistakably German
band was playing “Roses of Picardy,” while all around
me German waiters were running about deferentially, with
trays in their hands. Even as I wondered one of them
approached and laid the bill on my table with a friendly
smile and “Tree mark, bleesir.”
Then I remembered that I was at the British Officers'
Club in Cologne.
“How interested they will be at home,” I thought,
“when they know where I am. And of course I must
send them souvenirs of my Watch on the Rhine;” and
thoughtfully I produced from my pocket some local tram-
tickets, kept for the younger members of the family, and
patted a box of two-penny cigars encouragingly. These I
was going to send to my brother.
Then I rose and, paying the bill, went out to purchase a
suitable memento for a younger sister. Slowly I wandered
along the crowded Hohestrasse in the direction of the Opera
House, peering into the shop-windows for something redo-
lent of the land I was in. Presently a bright-looking sweet-
shop attracted me. The window contained a beautiful
y|selection of chocolate-boxes, with pictures of the Cathedral
or the Rhine Maidens on the lids. In I went and selected
a handsome sample, bound with red plush and bordered
with sea-shells. But it was empty. “Nix sweets,” said
the girl behind the counter, and offered me the alternative of
a bun. Nothing doing, and I passed on.
Further along the street I stopped before a chemist's shop
to regard a huge pyramid of bottles of eau-de-Cologne dis-
played in the window.
“The very thing,” I said to myself. “What more ap-
propriate souvenir than a bottle of the local produce?”
That was ten days ago, and this morning I received the
following letter:— -
“Thank you so much for the scent; it was sweet of you,
and arrived safely, only I don't think it quite so nice as the
real eau-de-Cologne which I buy at Brown's shop [Brown
is the village grocer] for three-and-nine a bottle. And he
says they must have taken you in properly with a German
imitation called eau-de-Koln, and expects you had to pay
a pretty penny for it, though I hope you didn't, poor boy.”

THE BLUE HAT.
Nancy came softly into my study and
stood at the side of the desk, where I
was busy with some work on account
of which I had stayed away from the
office that morning.
“Do you like it?” she said. -
I felt a momentary anxiety as I
looked up. I had made a bad mistake
only a little time before, having waxed
enthusiastic over what I took to be a
new blouse when it was a question of
hair-dressing, the blouse having been
worn by my wife, so she solemnly
averred, “every evening for the last
two months.”
But this time no mistake was pos-
sible. You don't go about the house at
eleven o'clock on a cold Spring morning
fancifully arrayed in a pale blue hat
with white feathery things sticking out
all round it, unless there is a particular
reason for so doing.
“I think it's a delightful hat,” I
said, “and suits you splendidly. But
I thought you never wore blue?”
“I don't,” said Nancy; “that's what
makes me rather doubtful. I didn't
really mean to buy it at all. I went
in to Marguerite's—you know, that
heavenly shop at the corner of the
square"—I nodded; of course I knew
Marguerite's—“to ask the price of a
jade-green jumper they had in the
window—oh, my dear, a perfect angel of
a jumper!—and they showed me this.
That red-haired assistant almost made
me buy it ; said she had never seen me
in a hat that suited me so well; and
really it wasn't so very dear. But I
was a little doubtful. However -7
“She was quite right,” I said very
decidedly. “Did you get the what-
you-may-call-it-the other thing?”
Nancy's face expressed poignant
anguish.
“Twelve guineas,” she said. “I
simply couldn't run to it. Of course I
was heart-broken. Still, it wasn't as
if I really needed anything just now.
It would have been ridiculous extra-
vagance. But it really was an angel.”
She turned to go, stopping a moment
on the way out to have another look at
herself in the little round mirror over
the mantel-piece.
“I’m not quite happy about it,” I
heard her murmur as she went out.
The next morning Iſound a letter wait-
ing for me at the office which brought
me news of a totally unexpected wind-
fall of some fifty odd pounds. It was
a sunny morning, too, with a distinct
feeling of Spring in the air.
I felt like being extravagant, and my
mind flew at once to Nancy and her
jade-green—what was the name of the
thing?'—that she had wanted so badly.
I left the office early, and on my way
home managed to summon up sufficient
courage to carry me through the dis-
creetly curtained doors of Madame
Marguerite's recherché establishment,
devoutly hoping that the nervous sink-
ing which I felt about my heart was
not reflected in my outer demeanour.
The red-haired girl, in spite of a curi-
ously detached and supercilious air, as
who should say, “Take it or leave it;
it concerns me not in the least,” which
at first rather alarmed me, was really
quite kind and helpful.
“Something in jade-green that Mod-
dom admired? A hat perhaps?”
No, I knew it was not a hat. I mur-
mured something about twelve guineas.
This seemed to be enlightening.
Ah, yes, a jumper probably. They
had had a jade-green jumper at that
price, she believed. If I would sit down
for a moment she would send someone
to see if it were still unsold.

I felt very anxious while I waited,
but the emissary presently returned
with the garment over her arm.
Yes, that was undoubtedly the one.
She remembered how much Moddom
had admired it. It had suited Moddom
so well too. -
While it was being packed up, for I
decided to take it with me, a small boy
arrived with several hat-boxes, which
he put down on the floor. .
Red-hair proceeded to unpack them,
carefully, almost reverently, extracting
the hats from the folds of surrounding
tissue-paper and placing them one by
one in various cupboards and drawers.
Presently she drew forth from one of
the boxes—I felt sure I was not mis-
taken—that very blue hat which I had
admired only the day before upon the
head of my wife.
I gave an involuntary exclamation.
Red-hair looked at me.
“Surely,” I said, feeling inwardly
rather proud at recognising it again—
“surely that hat is . like one
that my wife bought yesterday.”
Red-hair was hurt. “It is the same
hat,” she said coldly. “We never make
two models alike.” *
I tried to mollify her. “I can't
understand her sending it back,” I said.
“I think it's an extremely pretty hat,
and it suits her so well. But perhaps
there was some alteration necessary.
It may not have quite fitted or some-
thing?” -
Red-head dived gracefully into the
box and drew forth a note from the
tissue-paper billows. .
A faint flicker expressive of I knew
not what hidden emotion seemed to
pass for one moment over her aristo-
cratic features as she read it. But
it vanished instantaneously, and she
turned to me with her previous air of
haughty and imperturbable aloofness.
.“ Moddom is not keeping the hat,”
she said.
I felt somehow a little snubbed, and
said no more, and, my parcel appearing
at this moment, I paid and departed.
Nancy's joy over the jumper more
than came up to my expectations. When
she had calmed down a little I be-
thought myself of the matter of the hat.
“Oh, yes,” said Nancy in reply to
my question, “I sent it back after all.
It won't matter in the least now that
you have bought this.”
“But why didn't you keep it?” I said.
“Well, I really felt I didn't like it so
very much,” said Nancy, “and, as you
didn't seem quite to like it either nº
* “My dear girl,” I protested, “I told
you I thought it was charming.”
“Well, anyway you said that blue
didn't suit me," persisted my wife.
“You did, George.”

R. H. “Looks To ME LIKE A CHEMIST's shop, SIR."
There was a moment's pause. It was
no use saying anything. Suddenly
Nancy jumped up and clutched me by
the arm.
“George,” she said anxiously, “you
didn't, you didn't say anything about
that hat to the girl in the shop, did
you?”
“I believe I mentioned that I thought
it was extremely pretty, and that I was
sorry you weren't keeping it,” I replied
airily. “But why?” For my wife's
face had suddenly assumed an expres-
sion of horrified dismay.
“I shall never be able to go into that
shop again,” she wailed, “never. I
wrote them a note saying that I was
not keeping the hat because my husband
very much disliked it, and that I didn't
care ever to wear anything of which he
didn't approve.”
What is really very unfair about the
whole thing is that I know that Nancy
thinks me entirely to blame. Indeed
she told me so. When I ventured to
point out that she had not been quite
truthful in the matter she was at first
genuinely and honestly amazed, and
subsequently so indignant that I was
fain ultimately to apologise.
In looking back upon the episode
I am filled with admiration for the red-
haired girl. I consider that she showed
extraordinary self-restraint in what
must have been a peculiarly tempting
situation. R. F.

SMALL-TALK.
“Of course you must come,” said
Mary; “it’s nonsense to say you can't
dance.”
Mary is married to my first cousin,
Thomas. I looked at Thomas, but saw
no hope of support. Thomas labours
under the delusion that he can jazz.
“It isn't only the dancing,” I pro-
tested; “it’s the conversational strain.

Thomas, although my first

For the first few dances I
escaped; the crowd round the
door was so dense that I saw at
once that I should be trampled
to death if I attempted to enter.
Then I was caught by Mary
and introduced to a total
stranger.
I suppose there are people
who do not mind kicking a
total stranger round the room
to the strain of cymbals, a
motor siren and a frying-pan.
I fancy the lady expressed a
desire to stop, but as her words
were lost in the orchestral
pandemonium I realised that
as long as the dulcet chords
continued conversation was
impossible; so we danced on.
Fortunately too, when the
interval came, she was full of
small-talk.
“Isn't the floor good? And
I always like this band.”

up courage.
“It’s this: how old are you?”
She stopped herself just in time.
Her answer was given in a tone which
expressed at the same time her contempt
for my breach of the conventions and
the fact that she was too indifferent to
think me worth snubbing.
“Twenty-two,” said she.
“Quite,” said I.

PEACE TERMS.
BEING some LETTERs of MRs. PART-
INGTON To HER SISTER.
[Conferences between mistresses and ser-
vants are being held in various parts of the
country to discuss terms of peace in the
domestic world.]
Puddleford.
DEAR MoIRA, We haven't got a ser-
vant yet, but we are clutching at a new
hope. There is to be a conference here
between mistresses and maids, to dis-
cuss and readjust the servants' rights
and the mistresses' wrongs—or is it
the other way about? Anyhow, I shall
attend that conference. I shall bribe,
plead, consent to any arrangement if
I can but net a cook-general. Ten
months of doing my own washing-up
has brought me to my knees, while
Harry says the performance of menial
duties has crushed his spirit.
Of course, Harry does make such a
fuss of things. You might think, to hear
him talk, that the getting up of coal,
lighting fires, chopping wood and clean-
ing flues was the entire work of a house-
hold, instead of being mere incidents in
the daily routine. If he had to tackle
my duties—but men never seem to un-
derstand how much there is to do in a
house. -
I will tell you about the conference
when I write again.
- Yours always, DoDo.
Puddleford.
DEAR Moira,_The conference was a
most interesting affair; the one going
on in Paris could never be half so thrill-
ing. There was a goodly attendance
of servants, and they had their own
spokeswoman. We spoke for ourselves
—those of us who were not too dazed
at the sight of so many “treasures”
almost within our grasp.
What the servants wanted was not
unreasonable. They chiefly demanded
a certain time to themselves during the
day, with fixed hours for meals, even-
ing free, etc.
Then Mrs. Boydon-Spoute got up—
you know how that woman loves to
hear herself talk—and said that such
demands were outrageous. (It's easy
for her to raise objections. She has
somehow paralysed her two servants
into staying with her for over ten years.)
She pointed out that under such con-
ditions the servant would have more
freedom than the mistress; and to
allow the working classes to thus get
the upper hand was nothing short of
encouraging Bolshevism in the home.
Dreadful thing to say, wasn't it?
The servants got rather restive at
that. When I thought of the two days'
washing-up waiting for me at home I
retorted with spirit that servants had
as much right to freedom as we, and
it was our duty to guard their inter-
ests—and lots of inspired things like
that, glaring at Mrs. Boydon-Spoute
the while.
I spoke so well that a cook-general
offered herself to me as soon as the con-
ference was over. She comes in on
Monday. -
Yours in transports, DoDo.
- Puddleford.
DEAR MorFA,-Emma, the new maid,
has arrived. Harry is as relieved as I
am and was quite cheerful while I was
dressing the gash he had inflicted on
his hand while chopping wood. Isn't
it strange that men can never give the
slightest assistance in the house with-
out getting themselves hurt in some
way? . - - -
Emma promises to be a treasure.
If mistresses would only show a little

DEAR Moira,_I am sorry not to
have written for such a long time. I
have been so extremely busy.
You see, when Emma, has had her
two hours free daily, her hour-and-a-half
off for dinner, with half-an-hour for
other meals, every evening out as well
as two afternoons a week, you would be
surprised what little leisure is left to
her for the housework.
She gets in what she can, of course,
and I do the rest. Doing the rest, by
the way, takes up a great deal of my
time. But I generally have an hour
free in the evenings.
Your brave DoDo.
- Puddleford.
DEAR MoIRA, I am glad to say
Emma has gone and I am putting my
name down at a registry-office in the
usual way. It's too much of a strain
having “conference” girls in the home.
Who was it said that if we are to
allow the working classes to get the
upper hand it was nothing short of
encouraging Bolshevism in the home?
Anyhow, I think he—or perhaps it was
she-must be right.
I must close rather hastily. I have
just heard a terrific crash in the
kitchen; I'm afraid Harry has dropped
something on his foot again.
Your long-suffering DoDo.

RHYMES OF RANK.
WICE-ADMIRALs command a base;
Their forms blend dignity with grace.
You never see the smallest trace
Of levity upon the face
Of one who wears a Vice's lace.
For Admirals to romp and race
Or frolic in a public place
Is held to be a great disgrace;
I do not think a single case
Of this has happened at our base.
The Commodore, the Commodore
Is very popular ashore;
He can relate an endless store
Of yarns which scarcely ever bore
Till they are told three times or more.
The ladies young and old adore
This man who bathed in Teuton gore
And practically won the War;
But once, a fact I much deplore,
A General was heard to snore
While seated near the Commodore.
The Captain dwells aloof, alone;
He has a cabin of his own;
And should the smallest nose be blown,
Though softly and with dulcet tone,
In earshot of this sacred zone
The very ship herself would groan.
Yes, Captains (though but flesh and
bone -
Like little snotties, be it known)
Are best severely left alone.
Commanders are a stern-eyed folk
Who may or may not take a joke;
It really isn't safe to poke
Light fun at any three-ringed bloke;
You may be sorry that you spoke.
Their ways are proud; they sport the
oak;
They are not tame enough to stroke;
I greatly dread these grim-eyed folk.
Lieutenants of the R.N.V.
Were born and bred on land, not sea,
And ancient mariners like me
With sly grimace and winks of glee
Would watch them when the winds
blew free,
Or send them down a cup of tea.
But soon their deeds became their plea
For standing with the Big Navee
In equal fame and dignity:
While even Subs, R.N. agree
They're better than they used to be,
These Looties of the R.N.V.
Sub-Loots are nothing if not sports;
The nicest girls in all the ports
Declare they are the best of sorts
And useful on the tennis-courts.
In gun-rooms, where their rank re-
sorts,
They bandy quips and shrewd retorts,
And swig champagne, not pints but
uarts.
I said at first that they were sports.

FEARFUL ODDS.
THERE's no fear that strikes so dumb,
None so hard to overcome, -, --
As the thought that there are two
Eyes that may be watching you.' .
Here's a perfect illustration -
Of that sickening sensation.
Young Lieutenant Jimmy Spry's
Power resided in his eyes;
He'd been able all his days
To revolve them different ways.
For example, let's suppose -
That the right one watched his nose,
Then the left—you'll think it queer—
Turned towards his dexter ear.
But what really made him great
Was—he always saw things straight.
Out in France, a year ago,
He was cornered by the foe;
Neither party had a gun,
But the odds were three to one
And the Huns were fit and strong;
One was lean and very long,
One was short and stout of calf,
While the third was half and half.
Jimmy, spoiling for a fight,
Fixed the short one with his right,
While his left with martial glare
Met the long 'un's startled stare;
But—I know it sounds absurd—
He was looking at the third.
Jimmy was, I'd have you know,
Something of a boxing pro.,
So he knew the golden maxim:
“He who eyes his man best whacks
him.” - - -
Shorty, when he saw the grim
Optic that was turned on him,
Thinking Jimmy's fist looked hard
Prudently remained on guard.

Longshanks if he did the same 2
But our hero, irritated, -
Grassed the thirdman while they waited.
Filled with rage and anger, both
Rushed upon him with an oath,
Eager now to slit the gizzard
Of that astigmatic wizard,
Till they noticed with dismay
Both his eyes were far away!
(One eye sought the earth, while one
Seemed to contemplate the sun.)
Both stopped dead; the same cold
thought
At their jangling heart-strings caught.
Longshanks, trembling at the knee,
Quavered, “Hans, he's watching me!”
Shorty whimpered, scared to fits,
“No, it's me he's after, Fritz!"
Sick with fear, their souls revolted;
As one man they turned and bolted.
At them Spry in mild amaze
Literally) bent his gaze,
ighed, and then without a word
Waridered homeward with the third.
BAR BABIES,
[Lord Justice BANKs recently referred to the
possible establishment of a Law Courts' crèche,
where the female barrister might leave her
young while engaged in forensic duties.]
From “The Law Times” of 192—, ,
“A violent altercation took place
yesterday in the room allotted to infants
of the Junior Bar (adjoining the Court
of Pathetic Appeal) between his nurse
and little Johnnie, the teething infant
of Mrs. Flapperton, who, by the way,
we noticed being measured only the
other day for silk. The Court Husher
having failed to produce silence, Mrs.
Justice Spankhurst had to intervene,
and only succeeded in restoring orderby
threatening to have the crèche cleared.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 14th-The Criminal
Injuries (Ireland) Bill furnished the
LoRD CHANCELLOR with the text for a
rather gloomy sermon on the present
state of the sister-country. The King's
Writ still runs there, but in many
counties is outstripped by the rival fiat
of Sinn Fein. A tribute to the impec-
cable behaviour of “law-abiding” Ulster
appeared to stir in the breast of Lord
CREwe memories of the pre-war pran-
cings of a certain “Galloper,” for he re-
marked that the noble lord's information
seemed to be “partial and recent.”
Exception has recently been taken to
the cab-shelter in Palace Yard, some
Members objecting that its architectural
design was out of harmony with that
of the Houses of Parliament, and others
complaining that its internal attractions
were so great as to seduce
the taxi-men from paying
any attention to prospec-
tive fares. Sir ALFRED
Mond, afterlong considera-
•tion, has decided to abol-
ish the offending edifice
and to give the drivers
a shelter in the Vaults,
where the police will dis-
courage them from exceed-
ing in the matter of “rest
and refreshment.”
Members were naturally
eager to hear what Mr.
BonAR LAw, freshly flown
from Paris, had to tell
them about the Peace
Conference, the prospects
of hanging the Ex-KAISER,
and so forth, but received
little information, save that the Govern-
ment shared the popular desire that
no legal quibble should prevent the
arch-criminal being brought to justice.
Members were a little comforted, how-
ever, by the announcement that a
Committee of the Cabinet is already
considering the whole question of
Peace-celebrations. While Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE is engaged (if the image is per-
mitted) in fighting beasts at Ephesus
it is pleasant to think of his colleagues
deciding upon the relative merits of
crackers and catherine-wheels, flares
and bonfires, church-bells and steam-
| sirens, as means for the expression of
the national joy.
After the loud orgy of headlines
which followed upon his remarkable
victory at Central Hull, Commander
KENwobTHY might reasonably have ex-
pected that his entry into the House
would have produced an uproarious
scene of demonstration and counter-
demonstration. But there was nothing
of the kind. The jubilant “Wee Frees,”
of course, cheered as one man, but the
volume of sound produced was not ap-
preciably greater than if one man had
cheered; and the crowded Coalitionists
sat gloomily silent, though no doubt
they thought a lot. The gallant Com-
mander has already introduced one
pleasing innovation into the procedure
of the House, for, before signing the
Roll, he nodded cheerfully to the ladies
in the Gallery, as if to say, “But for
you I shouldn't be here !”
Sir A. GRIFFITH-BoscAweN, who at
Question-time had regretfully admitted
that the Government were withdrawing
soldiers from agriculture at a moment
when they were particularly required,
now moved the Second Reading of the
Bill which is intended to give them the
chance of going back to the land in
perpetuity. In spite of his warning
that the cost of the land to be acquired

At a blast on whistle the cab-drivers will down tea-cups, seed-cake,
kippers or what-not, and double smartly on to parade.
was a comparatively minor part of the
expense, Members vied with one another
in denouncing the iniquity of allowing
the land-owner to get the present
market-value of his property; and the
landlords' representatives themselves
hastened to declare that such a pre-
posterous notion never entered their
heads. The Bill was read a second
time without a division. I don't sup-
pose it will provide land for anything
approaching the eight hundred thou-
sand soldiers who are said to be pining
for it; but it ought to satisfy the rela-
tively small proportion who, after hear-
ing about the trials and hardships of
a small-holder—no forty-eight hours'
week for him —retain their agricultural
aspirations.
Tuesday, April 15th.-In a couple
of hours the Lords disposed of several
Bills, enjoyed a scientific debate on
neurasthenia—described by a corre-
spondent of Lord KNUTSFORD as “a gas
escaping from people "—discussed the
prices of milk and cheese, and still
Falacº Yºkº is
found time for the consideration of
their own procedure. Lord CURzoN
said the suggestion that the House
should sit on more days in the week had
not been favourably received. Friday
would not do, as their Lordships went
out of town on that day, and Monday
was equally inconvenient, as they could
not contrive to get back by then. To
earlier sittings the Lord CHANCELLOR
objected on behalf of his legal col-
leagues. So it looks as if there would
be no change, and since, teste Lord
SALISBURY, the House does its work
admirably, why should there be?
Remembering a famous speech on
the presumption of certain organs of
the Press, the Commons were not sur-
prised to learn from Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
à propos of the beer-tax, that he is
not responsible for what may appear
in The Times.
There is still something
of “the eternal boy” in
Major WEdgwood BENN.
It was with an air of
“Now I've got him” that
he propounded the ques-
tion, “Is paper a raw
material or a manufac-
tured article?" But Mr.
BRIDGEMAN can always
solve these Cobdenite
conundrums, and quietly
replied, “Both.” Where-
upon Major BENN, with
an engaging blush, retired
from the fray.
In moving the second
reading of the Aliens Re-
striction Bill the HoME
SECRETARY said that, while
national safety must be
the first consideration, no unnecessary
hardship should be inflicted on our
foreign immigrants. But his proposal
that the Government should rest con-
tented with its present powers for
another two years met with little
favour from Members whose knowledge
of history seems to date from 1914.
In the opinion of Mr. BottomLEY, who
led the Opposition, every alien was
prima facie undesirable; Sir ERNEST
WILD, from his experience in the crim-
inal courts, took the same view, and
patriotically demanded the exclusion
from our shores of persons whose prin-
cipal occupation, we gathered, was to
furnish him with briefs for the defence;
and Mr. JoyNSON IIICRs, Mr. BILLING
and Sir R. Cooper urged that the
ShortT way with aliens should be
made considerably shorter. Before this
massed attack the HoME SECRETARY
gave way and agreed to reduce the
operation of the Bill to one year.
The temperature of the House rose
so appreciably during the debate as to

Wednesday, April 16th.-A crowded
House, the Peers' Gallery full to over-
flowing, the HEIR-APPARENT over the
Clock, and the new Editor of The Times
among the representatives of the Press
—the PRIME MINISTER could have de-
sired no better setting for his speech
upon the labours of the Peace Con-
ference. . His original intention was to
hold his forces in reserve and invite his
critics to “fire first,” but, as none
of these gentlemen seemed to be
particularly anxious to go “over
the top,” Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
obligingly altered his battle-plan
and himself delivered the opening
fusillade.
That he was in no apologetic
mood was shown in almost his
first sentence. His declaration
that indemnities were a difficult
problem, “not to be settled by tele-
gram,” evoked resounding cheers.
Thenceforward he held the sym-
pathy of the House, whether he
was describing the difficulties of
the Peace Conference, or reconcil-
ing the apparent inconsistencies of
its Russian policy, or inveighing
against the attempts of certain
newspapers to sow dissension
among the Allies. “I would rather
have a good Peace than a good
Press” was one of his most telling
phrases, and it was followed by a
character-sketch of his principal
newspaper-critic which in pun-
gency left nothing to be desired.
“What a journalist I could have
made of him!", the recluse of Fon-
tainebleau will doubtless remark when
he reads the passage. |
The PRIME MINISTER’s object, I
imagine, was less to impart information
than to create an atmosphere; and he
was so far successful that the House
showed little inclination to listen to
other speakers. Nevertheless several of
them devoted some hours to saying
nothing in particular before the House
mercifully adjourned for the Easter
Recess.

FROM THE STREET OF ADVEN-
TURE.
Journalistic reconstructions and
amalgamations have been proceeding
so rapidly and extensively of late that
there seems no end to the kaleidoscopic
possibilities of the future.
Up to the present, however, no con-
firmation can be obtained of the start-
ling rumour that The Spectator has been
purchased by the proprietors of The
Kennel Gazette, and will henceforth be
devoted to the interests of our four-
footed friends, the supplements being
restricted to purely feline amenities.
Another persistent rumour, which
hitherto lacks the seal of official cor-
roboration, is to the effect that
The Guardian is to be given a new
range of activity as the organ of
scientific spiritualism, under the
title of The Guardian Angel and
the joint editorship of Sir Oliver
Doyle and Sir Conan Lodge. The
investigations into multiple con-
sciousness conducted by these two
eminent savants have proved their
mutual convertibility to such an
extent that they have decided upon
this rearrangement of their names.
If the scheme materialises the
stimulating collaboration of Mr.
HARold BEGBIE is a foregone con-
clusion, and there is even a pos-
sibility of contributions from an
August Exile somewhere in Hol-
land.
A third report maintains with
minute circumstantiality that the
proprietors of The Economist, hav-
ing come to the conclusion that
this journal needs brightening,
have decided to entrust the post of
principal leader-writer to “CALLis-
THENEs,” and retain the services
of the authoress of The Tunnel as
financial feuilleton writer. But on en-
quiry at the London School of Eco-
nomics we could not obtain any definite
information.
The rumours that The Morning Post
is about to be merged in The Winning
Post, and that Mr. MAxse is starting
an evening paper, to be called The Job
and Caviller, are extremely interesting,
but need to be received with a certain
amount of caution.

LOOK AT THAT OLD CHAP WAVING HIS HoF
BABLINGO.
IT has been suggested to me that the time has come for
a comprehensive investigation of the interesting language
known as Bablingo. aterials for this are ready for
use in every home that still possesses a nursery with an
inmate not more than two years of age. I must premise
that it is the inmate's mother and the inmate's nurse, not
the actual inmate, who use the language. Some day, no
doubt, there will arise an investigator who will reduce
to order and catalogue the inchoate efforts of an infant
to make itself understood by talking. These efforts are
doubtless of high interest to the etymologist, but the diffi-
culties of the task are at present too great, and in any case
I am not the man to undertake it. -
I shall content myself for the moment with setting an
examination paper in Bablingo for the purpose of testing
knowledge. It will differ from most other examinations
in having a further object—namely to supply instruction
and information to the examiner. Later on it may be
possible to construct a grammar, and to append to this
a few easy exercises. It must be remembered, however,
that there are great difficulties to be overcome in such a
task. Every home, for instance, has its own rules for
pronunciation. Of these I do not for my immediate pur-
pose propose to take cognisance.
Here, then, is a short Bablingo examination paper for
the use of mothers and nurses. I do not at present see
my way to including fathers. -
(1) On what principles is the language which you use in
your nursery formed? Did you (a) acquire it, or (b) find
yourself unconsciously in possession of it 2 -
(2) Give a list of the characteristic features which dis-
tinguish Bablingo from the dialects employed by Pre-

A YEAR’S REPRISALS.
WHEN I sent Aunt Emily—from
whom I have expectations—a pin-
cushion at Christmas and she retaliated
with a pen-wiper on New Year's Day,
I thought that was the end of it.
Not so.
Aunt Emily reopened hostilities on
my birthday with a purple satin letter-
case embroidered with a sprig of rose-
up at my door. The angry driver toiled
into my passage with a packing-case
(bristling with splinters and nails).
When it was open and the chisel broken
I picked the splinters out of my fingers
and contemplated the battered horn of
a gramophone emerging from sawdust
and shavings.
The mess created was indescribable
when the horn was drawn forth. Shaw-
ings flew everywhere. The sawdust was

Probing my diary for other

I passed this as being in-

verything–February 14th, St.

To arrive on that day, I

Desperately I gouged it open.
Out of it, through a cloud of
shavings, emerged my own
loathsome yellow-and-red In-
ldian vase! No word with it—
not a word, not a note. Not a
funeral note.
Rage overtook me.
I disinterred Aunt Emily's
own gramophone and records.
I packed the horn anyhow.
Such of the records as seemed
difficult to get in I broke into
small pieces and shoved in
corners. I nailed the packing-
case up with the same nails and
addressed it in the boldest and
fiercest of characters to Aunt
Emily and caught the railway-
van on the rebound. The deed
was done. *
I laughed “Ha, ha!” I
laughed “Ho, ho!” I would
teach Aunt Emily to return me
my own vase.
Next morning came a letter.
As I read it perspiration burst
out on my forehead. Language
the most awful burst from my
lips.
And yet it was a simple letter
—from my little cousin Dolly.
“DEAR Bob,” it said, “I
sent you a yellow-and-red vase
for Christmas. Your Aunt
Emily gave it me as a wedding
present. It is not my style
and must be yours, because I
have seen one like it in your
house. Perhaps you collect
them. Don't tell your Aunt,
but I really couldn't bearit. I
forgot to put any note in the
very rare and very hideous, with a bulge
in its middle. Obviously unique, be-
cause when the Indian made it his
fellow-Indians slew him to prevent re-
petitions of the offence. I packed it in
the middle of a crate and much straw,
calculated to make an appalling mess
when released.
To dear Aunt Emily it went, with
love, and a few topical remarks about
the Monarchy.
But Aunt Emily evidently had a
diary too. On the 21st of October–
anniversary of Trafalgar—my heart
sank as the railway delivery van drew
like a butcher's shop. There were re-
cords too, some broken, all scratched.
When set going it made a noise like a
cockatoo with a cold. Decently covered
with a cloth it was interned in the loft.
Next please. One more effort and I
should be one up and Aunt Emily to
play. And her turn would be Christ-
mas. Once she sent me five pounds at
Christmas.
The diary again. A poor batch of
anniversaries for November. A partial
eclipse of the moon, partially visible
at Greenwich, was down for the 22nd.
But eclipses are too ominous.
box. Ha Christmas.
ppy Love, DoDDY.”
And Aunt Emily would have opened
my case by now.
On Christmas Day I received a
letter from her which I opened with
cold and clammy fingers.
She thanked me for sending back
the gramophone. She was sorry I did
not care for it. She was now sending
it to a hospital for shell-shocked officers.
And she wished me a Blithe Yuletide
on a penny card, And she was very
sincerely mine.
Anyone can have her for aught Icare.

[APRIL 23, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SOUTH SEA BUBBLE.
“I want you,” said my hostess, “to
take in Mrs. Blank. She is charming.
All through the War she has been with
her husband in the South Seas. Lon-
don is a new place to her.”
Mrs. Blank did not look too promis-
ing. She was pretty in her way—
“elegant" an American would have
called her—but she lacked animation.
However, the South Seas . . . . Any-
one fresh from the Pacific must have
enough to tell to see soup, fish and
entrée safely through.
I began by remarking that she must
find London a very complete change
after the sun and placidity that she
had come from. -
“It’s certainly noisier,” she said;
“but we had our share of rain.”
“I thought it was always fine there,”
I remarked; but she laughed a denial
and relapsed into silence.
She was one of those women who
don't take soup, and this made the econ-
omy of her utterances the more unfair.
Racking my brain for a new start I
fell back on those useful fellows, the
authors. Presuming that anyone who
had lived in that fascinating region—
the promised land (if land is the word)
of so many of us who are weary of
English climatic treacheries—would be
familiar with the literature of it, I went
boldly to work. -
“The first book about the South
Seas that I ever read,” I said, “was
BALLANTYNE's Coral Island.”
“Indeed!" she replied.
I asked her if she too had not been
brought up on BALLANTYNE, and she
said no. She did not even know his
name.
“He wrote for boys,” I explained
rather lamely. • *
“I read poetry chiefly as a girl,”
she said.
“But surely you know STEvKNson's
Island Nights' Entertainment 2" I said.
No, she did not. Was it nice 2
“It's extraordinary,” I said. “It
gives you more of the atmosphere of
the South Seas than any other work.
And Louis BECKE—you must have read
him 2 " I continued.
No, she had not. She read very
little. The last book she had read was
on spiritualism.
“Not even CoNRAD 2 " I pursued.
“No one has so described the calms
and storms of the Pacific.”
No, she remembered no story called
Conrad.
I was about to explain that CoNRAD
was the writer, not the written; but it
seemed a waste of words, and we fell
into a stillness broken only by the
sound of knife and fork.
“Hang it ! you shall talk,” I said to
myself; and then aloud, “Tell me all
about copra. I have longed to know
what copra is; how it grows, what it
looks like, what it is for.”
“You have come to the wrong per-
son,” she replied, with wide eyes. “I
never heard of it. Or did you say
Of course I know what a

them at the Zoo.”
I put her right. “Copra, the stuff
that the traders in the South Seas deal
in.”
“I never heard of it,” she said.
“But then why should I? I know
nothing about the South Seas.”
My stock fell thirty points and I
crumbled bread nervously, hoping for
something sensible to say; but at this
moment “half-time” mercifully set in.
My partner on the other side turned
to me suavely and asked if I thought
the verses in Abraham Lincoln were a
beauty or a blemish; and with the
assistance of the London stage, the
flight to America, Mrs. FULTON's Blight,
Mr. WALPoLE's Secret City and the
prospects of the new Academy, I sailed
serenely into port. She was as easy
and agreeable a woman as that other
was difficult, and before she left for the
drawing-room she had invited me to
lunch and I had accepted.
As I said Good-night to my hostess I
asked why she had told me that my
first partner had been in the South
Seas. She said that she had said
nothing of the sort; what she had said
was that during the War she had been
stationed with her husband, Colonel
Blank, at Southsea.
THE MESSAGE OF HULL.
THE Hull Election has been keenly
discussed in various papers, but by none
with more enthusiasm than The Daily
News. In a special article from the
luminous pen of “A. G. G.,” in the
issue of April 12th, the true inwardness
of the portent is thus revealed:—
“The message of Hull is a message
for all the world. It is the announce-
ment that this country, whatever its
Government may do, will not have a
French peace. It is a declaration to
America that the English people are
with her in her determination to have
a League of Nations' settlement and no
other. It is the repudiation of Con-
scription, of war on Russia, of the per-
manent military occupation of Ger-
many, of imperialism and grab, of war
policy in Ireland, of repression in
Egypt, of the reckless profligacy and
corruption that are plunging Europe
into Bolshevism and hurrying this
country to irretrievable ruin.”
We confess that we are staggered by
the moderation, not to say modesty, of
“A. G. G.,” as an interpreter of the
meaning of the Hull Election. He has
omitted infinitely more than he has
inscribed in his list.
The return of Commander KEN-
WORTHY stands, of course, for all these
things, but for many others of at least
equal importance.
It means the disappearance of in-
fluenza, the ravages of which are clearly
traceable to the political virus dissem-
inated by the Coalition.
It means the rehabilitation of Mr.
BIRRELL and his return to public life
as English Ambassador to the Court of
King Valeroso I.
It foreshadows the wholesale gratuit-
ous distribution of cigarettes, marma-
lade and gramophones.
. It means the prohibition of the use
of the French horn in orchestras and
all places where they play, the reinstate-
ment of the German flute and the
restoration of the German Fleet.
Lastly, it means the compulsory
prohibition of all Greek except “Alpha
of the Plough.”

"WHAT ARE You TRYING To Do, No. 4?”
“IT'S NO GOOD, INSTRUCTOR; IAIN'T GOT NO HEAD FOR HEIGHTS.”
i
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE latest of the now so fashionable short-story volumes to
come my way is one called Our Casualty, Etc. (SKEFFINGTON).
Much virtue in that “Etc.,” which covers other fifteen little
tales in the best, or nearly the best, “Birmingham ” man-
ner. I say “nearly,” because for its happiest expression
the art of “Mr. GEORGE BIRMINGHAM " demands space to
tangle events into more complicated confusion than can be
contrived in the dozen pages of these episodes. But within
their limitations they are all excellent fun, partly concerned
with the War (usually with an Irishman involved), partly
recalled from the piping and whisky-drinking times of peace,
at Inishmore and elsewhere. One can only treat them after
the manner of the schoolboy who declined to distinguish
between the Major and Minor Prophets. But I rather
specially enjoyed the title-piece, which tells how the super-
patriotism of an aged volunteer defeated the kindly plans of
those who would have saved him fatigue by assigning to
him the rôle of casualty in a trench-relief practice. Casual-
ties also figure in “Getting Even,” an improbable but highly
entertaining fiction of the score practised by an ingenious
Medical Officer (Irish, I need hardly say) upon an over-
zealous C.O., who, to keep him busy during a field day,
flooded his “clearing station” with all sorts of compli-
cated imaginary cases, only to find the fictitious victims
arranged comfortably in rows under the shade of the trees
to await the Padre and a burying party, the M.O. reporting
that they had all died before reaching him. It couldn't
possibly happen as here told, but that matters little, since,
so far as I am concerned, a “Birmingham" tale can always
well afford to dispense with credibility.
I am distinctly grateful to Rose MACAULAY for What Not
(CONSTABLE). It brought me the pleasantest end to any-
thing but a perfect English Spring day. She has wit, not so
common a gift that you can afford just to take it for granted;
she knows when to stop, selecting not exhausting; and she
makes her epigrams by the way, as it were, without expos-
ing the process of manufacture. (Other epigrammatists
please copy.) Miss MACAULAY's “prophetic comedy” is a
joyous rag of Government office routine, flappery, Pelmania,
Tribunals, State advertising, the Lower Journalism and
“What Not.” That audacious eugenist, Nicky Chester, first
Minister of Brains in the post-war period of official attempts
to raise the nation from C3 to something nearer A1 on the
intellectual plane, happens, because of his family history,
to be uncertified for marriage. He also happens to fall very
desperately in love with his secretary, Kitty Grammont, and
the conflict between duty and desire becomes the theme—
perhaps just a little too heavy—of an extravaganza that is
happiest in its lighter and more irreverent moments. Which
is to say that What Not wanders out of the key. But what
on earth does that matter if one is made to laugh quite often
and to smile almost continuously at a very shrewd piece of
observation, whimsicality and tempered malice? And you
will like the serene Pansy Ponsonby (out of “Hullo, Peace!”),
who could scarcely be called Kitty's “sister-in-law,” but was
of the most faithful. The odd thing is that under all her
gibing the author seems to have a queer furtive admiration
for her precious Ministry of Brains.
Among the many things I like in DoRoTHEA CoNYERs'
novels is the artistic subtlety, achieved by few of our other
novelists, with which she manages to write them as it were
in character. I am quite sure that if Berenice Ermyntrude
Nicosia Nevin, who is called by her initials on the cover and
inside by what they spell, had tried to write a novel it
would have been remarkably like B. E. N. (METHUEN).
There would have been the same keen delight in horses,
hunting and Irish scenery, and the same cheerful dis-
regard for such trifles as spelling or such conventions as
making quite sure that your reader knows which character

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
is speaking at any given moment, and the same excellent
humour, which, if it is at the expense of the Irish, is kindly
enough for all that. It seems to me that in her new novel
Mrs. CoNYERs, wisely refusing to stray to that suburbia in
which her gifts lack this charm, has recaptured much of
the careless rapture of her earliest books; and very careless
and very rapturous they were. But I am not quite sure
that in real life even Ben, when as second whip to the East
Cara hounds she lost her horse, would have found an
aeroplane useful to catch up with. In case it should be
objected that anything so funny as the tea at Miss Talty's
never could happen, even in the Caher Valley district, I
want to put it on record here and now that it could and does.
The Mystery Keepers (LANE), by MARIoN Fox, reminds me
of the old riddle, “What is it that has feathers and two legs,
and barks like a dog?"—the answer being a stork. People
who protest that a stork doesn't bark like a dog are told
that that part is put in to make it harder. I find that the
greater part of the mystery kept by The Mystery Keepers is
put in to make it harder. The Abbey at Clynch St. Mary
has a “coise” put on it by the last Abbess, and every direct
male heir expires punctually on his twenty-first birthday.
cisely thus also did nothing whatever of any consequence
happen to the vast majority of them. Since, however, the
truth and charm of the tale depend upon this absence of the
sensational, I must the more regret that Messrs. Col.I.INs,
who have printed it exquisitely, should have been betrayed
into a coloured wrapper of almost grotesque ineptitude.
In Graduation (CHATTo AND WINDUs) there is an essential
femininity about Miss IRENE RUTHERFoRD McLEOD's style
and general attitude that imposes limitations; it is a
quality that shows itself not only in her plot, but in her
characters, the three reputed males who figure therein
being as fine examples of true womanliness as you need
wish to meet. Frieda was the heroine (a name some-
how significant); and of the trouser-wearers, the first,
Geoffrey, was a cat-like deceiver, who fascinated poor
Frieda for ends unspecified, pretended (the minx') to be
keen on the Suffrage movement, which he wasn't, and
concealed a wife; the second was a Being too perfect to
endure beyond Chapter 10, where he expires eloquently of
heart-failure, leaving Alan, the third, to bear the white
man's burden and clasp Frieda to his maidenly heart.
This sentimental progress is, I suppose, what is implied by
The actual agency is a

ous wishes with such pre-
cision and despatch is not
explained. Anyway the

the title and the sym-
bolic staircase (if it is a
staircase?) on the wrap-
per. But my trouble was
that I could never discern
in the sweet girl-graduate
any development of char-
acter from the pretentious
futility of her earliest ap-
pearance. Perhaps I am
prejudiced. Undeniably
Miss McLEOD can draw a
certain type of prig with a
horrible facility. But the
antiquated modernity of
her scheme, flooded as it
is with the New Dawn of,
secret, steals the ring, murders the Otway of the period,
and retires to a lunatic asylum after her son has himself
stolen the ring from her workbox and poisoned himself into
the next world. That finishes it. The ring retires to a
museum and the proper people marry each other. It is a
slender and quite impossible story, but told in a clever way
which goes far to redeem its lack of substance.
The Graftons (CoLLINs) is a sequel to Mr. Archibald
MARSHALL's former chronicle of the same pleasant family.
Herein you shall find them, pursuing the even tenor of their
prosperous way, father, son and charming daughters, and
arriving placidly at the point where, in the natural sequence
of events, these daughters leave the paternal nest for others
provided by eligible mates. Their courtships, and some
mild uncertainty as to whether papa Grafton, well-preserved
and wealthy widower, will or will not follow the example
of his female offspring, provide the entire matter of the
book. For the rest Mr. MARSHALL is content to mark
time (and very pleasantly) with pictures of English country
life at its most comfortable, and in particular with some
comedy scenes, excellently done, turning upon the often
delicate relationship of Hall and Parsonage. There are a
couple of clerical portraits in the book that seem to me as
lifelike as anything of the kind since Barchester. Apart
from this the outstanding virtue of the Graftons is the
reality of their dialogue. Precisely thus do, or did, actual
people speak in the quiet old times before the War; pre-
say, a decade ago, and its
bland disregard of everything that has happened since, ended
by violently irritating me. Others may have better luck.
Spring has been slow in coming, but I got something
more than a whiff of actual summer when Under Blue Skies
(Hutchinson) came my way. Mr. DE WERE STACPoole
is at the top of his form, and it is a real pleasure to recom-
mend an author who brings to his tales of adventure so
nice a sense of style and so keen a feeling for character. In
“The Frigate Bird" the rapscallions who seize a schooner
and, without any knowledge of navigation, sail the high
seas, are full-blooded adventurers; but there is all the differ-
ence in the world between the character of the educated
Carlyon and that of the simple-minded and ignorant Finn.
This yarn occupies nearly half of the book, and the other
stories should give food for thought to those who allege that
no Englishman can write a short story. Apart from one
charming little tale of a haunted French château Mr.
STACPooDE allows us to bask here in the eternal summer
of Pacific skies. I am very grateful for my sun-bath.

PEACE AT THE SEASIDE.
[The public are being passionately warned against the threatened
crush at watering-places in August of this year of Peace.]
Stoutly we bore with April's icy blizzards;
“The worst of Spring,” we said, “will soon be through;
Summer is bound to come and warm our gizzards
And we shall gambol by the briny blue.”
But even as we put the annual question,
“Where shall we water 2 on what golden strand 2"
Warnings appear of terrible congestion,
Of lodgers countless as the local sand.
Lucky the man, the hardened strap-suspender,
Who with a first-class ticket, there and back,
Finds a precarious seat upon the tender,
A rocky berth upon the baggage-rack.
Should he arrive, the breath of life still in him,
His face will be repulsed from door to door;
He'll get no lodging, not the very minim,
Save under heaven on the pebbly shore.
In vain he pleads for stall-room in the stable;
The cellars are engaged; 'tis idle talk
To ask for bedding on the billiard-table—
Two families are there, each side of baulk.
Next morn he fain would wash in ocean's spray (there's
Balm in the waves that helps you to forget),
And lo! the deep is simply stiff with bathers;
He has no chance of even getting wet.
He starves as never in the age of rations;
The fishy produce of the boundless sea
Fails to appease the hungry trippers' passions
Who barely pouch one shrimp apiece for tea.
“I came,” he says, “to swallow priceless ozone
Under Britannia's elemental spell;
She rules the waves, as all her conquered foes own;
I wish she ruled her seasides half as well.
“I don't know what the beaten Bosch may suffer
Compared with us who won the late dispute,
But if it equals this (it can't be tougher),
Why, then I feel some pity for the brute.”
So by the London train upon the morrow
From holiday delights he gets release,
Conspuing, more in anger than in sorrow,
The pestilent amenities of Peace.

gaged in the process of beard-cultivation. The secret is
well kept, doubtless by a kind of freemasonry amongst
bearded men, but there can be little doubt that somewhere
there are nurseries where a bond-fide beard-grower who is
in the secret can retire until he is presentable.
I have frequently been annoyed by the way in which
these men flaunt their beards at one; their whole manner
seems to convey an air of superiority; they seem to say,
“Look at my beard. You can't grow a beard because you
haven't the moral courage to appear in public while it's
i. Wouldn't you like to know the secret? Well,
won't tell you.”
Determined to suffer these contemptuous glances no ||
longer, I set out on a voyage of discovery to unravel the
mystery of England's beard-nurseries.
I asked bearded men if they knew of anywhere in the
country where one could slip away in order to grow a beard,
but they always gave me evasive replies, such as: “Why not
have an illness and stay in bed for three months?” But
when I went on to ask where they had grown theirs, they
either made an excuse to leave me or said evasively, “Oh,
I've always had mine.” -
I once went to the enormous expense of making a bearded
Scotch acquaintance intoxicated in order to drag the secret

shadowed men for a month who looked as if they intended
growing beards. I even took advantage of Armageddon to
join the Navy, where beards are permitted; but when I
tried to start growing one I was instantly reprimanded for
not shaving by a bearded Commander, who had the same
triumphant gleam of superiority which I had noticed ashore.
In the Old Testament there was no secrecy on the sub-
ject. Somebody said, “Tarry in Jericho until your beards
be grown.” But I am quite satisfied in my own mind that
modern beard-growers do not go to Jericho; I have esta-

offered a peerage if he would desist from his criticisms of
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE and his Ministry, pointed out that other
monarchs might abdicate, but that those who thought he

“OF COURSE I DON'T BOTHER Now—BUT I USED to BE ABLE To TREAD on My 'Ain."
CIVILIAN FLYING, 1930.
“You’re late,” said Millie, as John
entered the hall and shook himself free
of his flying coat.
“Yes, dear; missed the 5.40 D.H.
from the Battersea Park Take-off by
a minute to-night. Jones brought me
home on that neat little knock-about
spad he's just bought. Small two-
seater arrangement, you know. Then I
walked from the 'drome just to stretch
myself. They don't give you too much
move space in those planettes.”
“Oh, I'd just love to have an aero-
planette like that l” exclaimed Millie.
“Mrs. Smith says she simply couldn't
do without hers now ; it makes her so
independent. She can pop up to town,
do her shopping and get back in a short
afternoon.”
“Um—yes,” calculated John. “Less
than seventy miles the double journey
—she'd manage that all right.”
“And that pilot of theirs,” went on
Millie, “seems just as safe with the
‘pup’ as he is with that great twin-
engined bus her husband s so keen on.”
“Yes,” said John ; “must be quite
an undertaking getting Smith's tri-
plane on the sky-way. It's useful for
a family party, though. I hear he
packed twenty or thirty on to it for
the picnic they had at John-o'-Groat's
last week. By the way,” added John,
as he moved upstairs, “aren't the Robin-
sons coming to dinner 2"
“Yes, you'd better hurry up and
change,” advised Millie.
The Robinsons were very up-to-date
people, John decided as they sat down
to the meal a little later. He hadn't
met them before. They were Millie's
friends.
“Very glad to know such near neigh-
bours,” he said cordially. “Why, it's
under forty miles to your place, I
should think.”
“Forty-seven kilos, to be exact,”
Robinson volunteered, “and I should
say we did it under twenty minutes.”
“Quite good flying,” said John.
“We came by the valley route, too,”
put in Mrs. Robinson. “John was good
enough to consider my wretched air-
pocket nerves rather than his petrol.”
“It’s a couple of miles further,” ex-
plained Robinson, “but my wife isn't
such a stout flier as her mother, though
the old lady is over seventy. My pilot
was bringing her from Town one aſter-
noon last week — took the Dorking-
Leith Hill air-way, you know, always
bumpy over there—and I suppose from
all accounts he must have dropped her
a hundred feet plumb, side-slipped and
got into a spinning dive and only pulled
the old bus out again when the furrows'
in a ploughed field below them had
grown easily countable.”
“Yes, it makes me shivery to think
of,” ejaculated Mrs. Robinson; “but
mother really has extraordinary nerve.
She wasn't in the least upset.”
“No, not a little bit, by Jove!”
added Robinson. “The old sport just
leaned forward in her seat and, when
James had adjusted his head-piece, she
coolly reprimanded him for stunting
without orders. Of course she doesn't
know anything about the theory of the
thing, you see.”
With the dessert came letters by the
late air post.
“Oh, please excuse me,” said Millie,
as she took them from the maid, “I see
there's a reply from Auntie—the Edin-
burgh aunt, you know,” she explained.
“I wrote her this morning, imploring
her to come over to-morrow for the
bazaar. She's so splendid at that sort
of thing.”
“What my wife's aunt doesn't know |
about flying isn't worth knowing.”
remarked John with finality. “Why,
she qualified for her ticket last year, and

she'll never see forty again.
that for an up-to-date aunt 2"
“I doubt if she'll fly solo that dis-
tance, though,” said Millie; “I don't
think she ought to, either.”
“Of course,” said Robinson, “it’s a bit
of a strain for a woman of middle age to
negotiate three hundred odd miles, even
with a couple of landings for a cup of
tea en route.”
Millie rose. “Now, don't you men
sit here for an hour discussing “flying
speeds,' 'gliding angles,' and all that
sort of thing. I object to aero-maniacs
on principle. I ” At that mo-
ment a peculiar noise, evidently in the
near vicinity of the house, arrested the
attention of the party.
“Sounded like something breaking,”
said Millie, going to the window, which
overlooked the garden and a good-
sized paddock beyond. John had al-
ready gone out to investigate. -
In a minute or two he reappeared
ushering in a very jolly-looking old
gentleman in a flying suit.
“A thousand pardons, Mrs. Smith,”
said the new arrival; “John collected
me in the paddock. Ha! ha! You
know my theory about the paddock.”
The guests having been introduced,
explanations followed.
“You know my theory,” began old
Mr. Brown. -
“Yes, rather; I should think we do,”
interrupted Millie, leading him to the
most comfortable armchair “But,”
she quoted, “you are old, Mr. Brown;
do you think at your age it is right?”
“Well, the theory's smashed, any-
how,” said John decisively, “and so 's
my fence.”
“No no I won't hear of it,”
laughed Brown; “I admit the fence,
but not the theory. You see,” he
went on, turning to Mrs. Robinson,
“l 've always insisted, as Smith knows,
that there's plenty of landing space in
his paddock, provided you do it up
wind. The fact is I glided in to-night
from east to west. Thought I should
be dead head on ; but I believe I was a
couple of points out in my reckoning
and so failed to bring the old 'bus to a
stand short of the fence. You know,
Smith,” he added, with an injured air,
“you ought to have a wind-pointer
rigged up so 's there'd be no doubt
about it.”
“Just to encourage reckless old
gentlemen to smash up my premises,
I suppose,” retorted John. “But I
admit I found some consolation for my
smashed fence when I observed the
pathetic appearance of your under car-
riage, after your famous landing.”
“And now,” said Millie to Mr. Brown,
“all will be forgotten and forgiven if
you'll come into the drawing-room and

six THousAND MILLIONs, or worever IT Is, IN THREEPENNY BITs; AND THEN 'oo THE 'ELL's GoING To count IT?"
“AS YOU WERE.”
A MEMORY OF MII-CAREME.
Chippo Munks is a regular time-
serving soldier, as distinguished from
the amateurs who only joined the
Army for the sake of a war. His com-
pany conduct-sheet runs into volumes,
and in peace-time they fix a special
peg outside the orderly-room for him
to hang his cap on. At present he
systematically neglects the functions of
billet-orderly at a Base town in France.
A month or two ago he came across
Chris Jones.
“Fined fourteen days' pay,” said
Chippo ; “an' cheap it was at the price.
But the financialembarrassment thereby
followin' puts me under the necessity
of borrowing the loan of a five-spotter.”
“How did it happen?” said Chris,
playing for time.
“'Twas this way,” said Chippo. “The
other night I was walking down the
Roo Roobray, thinking out ways of
making you chaps more comfortable in
the billet, as is my custom. Suddenly
out of the gloom there looms a Red
Indian in full war-paint.
“‘Strange,' thinks I. ‘Chinks an’
Portugoose we expects here, likewise
Annamites and Senegalese an' dough-
boys; but I never heard that the
BUFFALO BILL aggregation had taken
the war-path.'
“He passes, and a little Geisha comes
tripping by. I rubs my eyes an’ says,
‘British Constitootian' correctly; but
she was followed by a Gipsy King and
a Welsh Witch. Then I sees a masked
Toreador coming along, and I decides
to arsk him all about it. The language
question didn't worry me any. I can
pitch the cuffer in any bat from Tamil
to Arabic, an' the only chap I couldn't
compree was a deaf-an'-dumb man who
suffered from St. Vitus' Dance, which
made 'im stutter with his fingers.
“‘Hi, caballero,' says I, where's
the bull-fight?'
“‘It isn't a bull-fight, M'sieur,' he
replies. “It's Mi-Carème.'
“‘If he's an Irishman,' I says, “I
never met him ; but if it's a kind of
pastry I'll try some.’
“Then he shows me a doorway
through which they was all entering,
and beside it was a big yellow poster
which said, “Mi-Caréme. Grand Bal
Costumé. Cavaliers, 2 francs. Dames,
1 franc 50 centimes.’
“‘I'd love to be a cavalier at two
francs a time,' I remarks. ‘Besides,
I want to make the further acquaint-
ance of little Perfume of Pineapple
Essence who passed by just now.'
“‘It will be necessary to 'ave a cos-
tume, M'sieur,’ says Don Rodrigo.
“‘Trust me,' I answers with dignity;
“I’ve won diplomas as a fancy-dress
architect.'
“I goes to my billet and investigates
the personal effects of my colleagues.
My choice fell on a Cameron kilt, a
football jersey and a shrapnel helmet.
These I puts into a bundle an' hikes
back to the Hall of Dance.
“‘May I ask what M'sieur repre-
sents?” said the doorkeeper as I paid
my two francs.
“‘I haven't started yet,” I answers
asperiously. “I assumes my costume
as APPIUS CLAUDIUS in the dressing-
room.’
“Well, when I'd finished my toilette
—regrettin' the while that I hadn't
brought a pair of spurs to complete the
costume—I entered the ball-room. It
was a scene of East-end—I mean East-
ern—splendour. Carmens an' Father
Timeses, Pierrots an’ Pierrettes, Pom-
padours an’Apaches was gyrating to the
soft strains of the orchestra, who per-
spired at the piano in his shirt-sleeves.
“All of a sudden I saw my little
Geisha, my Stick of Scented Brillian-
time, waltzing with the Toreador, an'
my heart started beating holes in my
football jersey. When the orchestra

stopped playing to light a cigarette I
sought her out.
“‘O Choicest of the Fifty-seven
Varieties,' I says, “deign to give me
your honourable hand for the next
gladiatorial jazz."
“The Bull-fighter looked black, but
she put her little hand in mine an' we
trod a stately measure. Every now an'
then a shadow passed o'er the ball-
room, an' I knew it was the Toreador
scowling. But I took no notice of him,
an' we danced nearly everything on
the menu, Don Rodrigo only getting an
odd item now an' then to prevent him
dying of grief. ' -
“By-an'-by the Geisha said she must
be going, so I offered to escort her home.
Don Roddy tried to butt in, and when
he got the frozen face he used langwidge
more like a cow-puncher than a bull-
fighter.
“I didn't trouble to change my clothes,
because it seemed to be the custom to
walk about like freaks at Mi-Carème,
and we had a lovely promenade in the
pale moonlight.
“When I returned the revelry was
nearly over an' the orchestra was getting
limp. I went into the cloak-room to
change my clothes, but I couldn't find
| 'em anywhere. What annoyed me most
about it was that there was five francs
in my trouser pockets which I was
saving to pay you back the loan I
borrered last week.”
“I wondered when you were going
to say something about that,” said
Chris Jones.
“It fair upset me,” continued Chippo.
“And then all at once I saw my old
pal the Toreador sneaking out of the
door with a bundle an' the leg of a pair
of khaki trousers hanging out of it.
I gave a wild whoop an' was after him
like the wind.
“Don Roddy was some runner. He
doubled down the Roo Roubray, dodged
round a corner an' made for the Grand
Pont. I was gaining on him fast when
I plunked into the arms of two Military |
Police.
-“‘What particular specie of night-
bird do you call yourself?' said one of
'em, holding my arm in a grip of iron.
“‘I'm a Sergeant-drummer in the

away. “An' I'm in a hurry.'
“‘Well, where's your pass?'
“We don't wear 'em in our battalion,'
I says. ‘For heving's sake let me go.
There's a chap over there trying to

“It was no use. They held me tight,

Toreador disappeared from view over
the bridge.

SoMEONE estimated the other day
that England is short just now of five
hundred thousand houses. This is a
miscalculation. She is really short of
five hundred thousand and one, the odd
one being the house that we are look-

gives complete satisfaction. Either the
locality or the shape or the price is all
wrong; or, as more often happens, the
fixtures. By the fixtures I mean, of
course, the people who are already in
the place and refuse to come out of it;
London is full of houses with the wrong
people in them.
“I wonder,” says Celia, standing out-
side some particularly desirable resi-
dence, “if we dare go in and ask them
if they wouldn't like to move.”
“We can't live there unless they do,”
I agreed. “It would be so crowded.”
“After all, I suppose they took it
from somebody else some time or other.
I don't see why we shouldn't take it
from them.”
“As soon as they put a ‘To LET’
board outside we will.” -
Celia hangs about hopefully for some
days after this, waiting for a man to
come along with a “To LET" board over
his shoulder. As soon as he plants it
in the front garden she means to rush
forward, strike out the “To,” and pre-
sent herself to the occupier with her
cheque-book in her hand. It is thus,
she assures me, that the best houses
are snapped up; but it is weary waiting,
and I cannot take my turn on guard,
for I must stay at home and earn the
money which the landlord (sordid fel-
low) will want.
Sometimes we search the advertise-
ment columns in the papers in the hope
of finding something that may do.
“Here's one,” I announced one morn-
ing; “‘For American millionaires and
others. Fifteen bathrooms 'Oh, no,
that's too big."
“Isn't there anything for English
hundredaires 2" said Celia.
“Here's one that says ‘reasonable
offer taken.’”
“Yes, but I don't suppose we reason
the same way as he does.”
“Well, here's one for four thousand
pounds. That's not so bad. I mean
as a price, not as a house.”
“Have you got fourthousand pounds?"
“No ; I was hoping you had.”
“Couldn't you mortgage something
—up to the hilt 2."
“We'll have a look,” I said.
We spent the rest of that day looking
for something o mortgage, but found
nothing with a hilt at all high up.
“Anyhow,” I said, “it was a rotten
house.”
“Wouldn't it be simpler,” said Celia,
“to put in an advertisement ourselves,
describing exactly the sort of house we
want? That's the way I always get
servants.”
“A house is so much more difficult
to describe than a cook.”
“Oh, but I'm sure you could do it.
You describe things so well.”
Feeling highly flattered, I retired to
the library and composed.
For the first hour or so I tried to do
it in the staccato language of house-
agents. They say all they want to
say in five lines; I tried to say all we
wanted to say in ten. The result was
hopeless. We both agreed that we
should hate to live in that sort of house.
Celia indeed seemed to feel that if I
couldn't write better than that we
couldn't afford to live in a house at all.
“You don't seem to realise,” I said,
“that in the ordinary way people pay
me for writing. This time, so far from
receiving any money, I have actually
got to hand it out in order to get into
print at all. You can hardly expect me to
give my best to an editor of that kind.”
“I thought that the artist in you
would insist on putting your best into
everything that you wrote, quite apart
from the money.”
Of course after that the artist in
me had to pull himself together. An
hour later it had delivered itself as
follows:— -
“WANTED, an unusual house. When
I say unusual I mean that it mustn't
look like anybody's old house. Actually
it should contain three living-rooms
and five bedrooms. One of the bed-
rooms may be a dressing-room, if it is
quite understood that a dressing-room
does not mean a cupboard in which
the last tenant's housemaid kept her
brushes. The other four bedrooms
must be a decent size and should get
plenty of sun. The exigencies of the
solar system may make it impossible
for the sun to be always there, but it
should be around when wanted. With
regard to the living-rooms, it is essen-
tial that they should not be square but
squiggly. The drawing-room should
be particularly squiggly; the dining-
room should have at least an air of
squiggliness; and the third room, in
which I propose to work, may be the
least squiggly of the three, but it must
be inspiring, otherwise the landlord
may not obtain his rent. The kitchen
arrangements do not interest me
greatly, but they will interest the cook,
and for this reason should be as de-
lightful as possible; after which warn-
ing anybody with a really bad base-
ment on his hands will see the wisdom
of retiring from the queue and letting
the next man move up one. The bath-
room should have plenty of space, not
only for the porcelain bath which it
will be expected to contain, but also
(as is sometimes forgotten) for the
bather after he or she has stepped out
of the bath. The fireplaces should not
be, as they generally are, utterly beastly.
Owners of utterly beastly fireplaces
may also move out of the queue, but
they should take their places up at the
end again in case they are wanted;
for, if things were satisfactory other-
wise, their claims might be considered,
since even the beastliest fireplace can be
dug out at the owner's expense and re-
placed with something tolerable.
“A little garden would be liked. At
any rate there must be a view of trees,
whether one's own or somebody else's.
“As regards position, the house must
be in London. I mean really in London.
I mean really in central London. The
outlying portions of Kensington, such
as Ealing, Hanwell and Uxbridge, are
no good. Cricklewood, Highgate, New
Barnet and similar places near Port-
man Square are useless. It must be
in London—in the middle of London.
“Now we come to rather an import-
ant matter. Rent. It is up to you to
say, how much you want; but let me
give you one word of warning. Don't
be absurd. You aren't dealing now with
one of those profiteers who remained
(with honour) in his own country. And
you can have our flat in exchange, if
you like—well, it isn't ours really, it's
the landlord's, but we will introduce
you to him without commission. Any-
way, don't be afraid of saying what you
want; if it is absurd (and I expect it
will be) we will tell you so. And if you
must have a lump sum instead of an
annual one, well, perhaps we could
manage to borrow it (from you or some-
body); but smaller annual lumps would
be preferred.”
When I had written it out I handed
it to Celia.
“There you are,” I said, “and, speak-
ing as an artist, I don't see how I can
make it a word shorter.”
She read it carefully through.
“It does sound a jolly house,” she
said wistfully. “Would it cost a lot
as an advertisement 2"
“About the first year's rent. And
even then nobody would take it seri-
ously.”
“Oh, well, perhaps I'd better go and
see another agent.” She fingered the
advertisement regretfully. “It seems
a pity to waste this,” she added with
a smile.
But the artist in me was already
quite resolved that it should not be
wasted. A. A. M.

Lady. “Poor DEAR ANd so THEY RELECTED IT? IT's A shAME—THEY ought To set YoU sixſplk:R subjects.”
A THREATENED SOURCE OF REVENUE.
THE PostMASTER-GENERAL and the
CHANCELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER are at
this moment the most melancholy of
men. For the last few months they
had been quietly chuckling to them-
selves over one of the most brilliant
ideas that ever adorned the annals of
Government. But the best laid schemes
gang aft agley.
While publicists and economic ex-
perts were shaking their grey hairs
over the prospect of national bank-
ruptcy, the P. M. G. and the C. of E.
were weeping jazz tears of joy as the
national debt lifted before their eyes
“like mist unrolled on the morning
wind.” And then certain unsophisti-
cated Members of a new, a very new,
House of Commons began their deadly
work. As a result the main scheme of
national solvency is in danger.
There are those who still think that
the franchise was extended to women
merely as an objective piece of political
justice. I hate cynicism, and I should
be the last to throw cold water on an
ideal, but, as I said, the real fruits
of that political master-stroke are in
danger.
While millions of enfranchised
women were quietly engaged in writing
twice a week to their particular Mem-
ber, at three half-pence a time (or
more), they were unconsciously assist-
ing the considered policy of His Maj-
esty's Government, which was that
such letters should be written and re-
main unanswered; that more letters
and still more should be written,
stamped and posted to demand an
answer, and that still more should be
written to friends and relations expos-
ing the grave lack of courtesy at West-
minster.
But, alas ! certain Members, with
monumental naïveté, have thought
fit to take their correspondence seri-
ously. They have put questions to
Ministers. They have in so many
crude words openly on the floor of the
House referred to “the increase in the
number of letters which Members now
receive from their constituents on par-
liamentary matters, owing to the re-
cent additions to the franchise and its
extension to women.” They have
pleaded for the privilege of “franking”
their answers. Could perversity go
further ? What woman will continue
to write to a Member who satisfies her
curiosity ? And what of the unwritten,
unstamped, unposted letters of just in-
dignation to friends and relations?
The P.M.G.'s laconic answer to this
monstrous request, “I do not think it
would be expedient,” was highly com-
mendable as a feat of Ministerial re-
straint. But the gloom that has settled
on him is only too solidly grounded.
These afflicted Members are out to
raise a sentimental public opinion in
support of their silly demand. Then,
of course, the Government will capi-
tulate, and the country will gobolshevik
from excessive taxation.
Will not all patriotic women con-
stituents write at once to their Mem-
bers and point out the folly of this
agitation?

BRAINS AND BALDNESS.
BY OUR MEDICAL ExPERT.
(With acknowledgments to “The
Times").
BALDNESS among men is undoubtedly
on the increase, and various reasons
have been assigned for its appearance
in an exacerbated form. In particular
the stress and strain of the War have
been mooted, and the argument is rein-
forced by such words as Chauvinism,
which, Mr. LLOYD GEORGE is probably
not aware, is derived from chauve.
War is a solvent of equanimity; in the
cant but expressive phrase it becomes
harder to keep one's hair on. Again,
inter arma silent Musa. Fewer people
have been playing the pianoforte, an
exercise which has always exerted a
stimulating effect on the follicles. Our
political correspondent at Paris writes
that M. PADEREWSKI's once luxuriant
chevelure has suffered sadly since he has
taken to politics, but that after playing
for a couple of hours to Mr. BALFour a
distinct improvement was noticeable.
But no very clear exposition of the
subject has yet been forthcoming, and
this is all the more extraordinary when
it is considered that baldness is really a
very unsightly and distressing condition.
The sensitiveness of JULIUS CAESAR
on this score is notorious. CIMABUE, of
whom Mr. LLoyd GEORGE has probably
never heard, was a martyr to alopecia
seborrhoica, and the case of the Highland
chieftain MacAssar is too well known to
call for detailed survey. Yet the strange
fact remains that hitherto sustained
scientific investigation has been lack-
ing, though there is assuredly a great,
if not perhaps a vital, need for it. No
one can afford to say that, if this ap-
parently simple malady were studied,
facts of the utmost value to hatters
would not be forthcoming. One can
only express regret that those fortunate
interviewers who have been allowed to
describe the cranial developments of
eminent men should have failed to
profit by their opportunities for exam-
ining the “area of baldness,” which cor-
responds to the distribution of the Wth
nerve, the branches of which come out
from the brain by the eye-sockets. Such
investigations will never be properly
carried out and co-ordinated without
the establishment of a Hair Ministry,
which is one of the clamant needs of
reconstruction. It is an open secret
that the question was discussed a year
ago and set aside for the curious reason
that of the three persons whose candi-
dature was most powerfully supported
two were bald, and the third was the
Member for Wigan.
Meanwhile a start has been made by
the unofficial activities of a small com-
mittee of experts in trichology, and
their conclusions, published in an in-
terim report, are worth recording. They
are as follows: “That the “area of bald-
ness,' should an illness supervene, will
certainly suffer to a greater extent than
the more vigorous ones. Illness, as is
well known, tends to interfere with the
nourishment of the skin and to establish
an atrophic diathesis of the follicular
ganglia. The patient's hair may all
come out, or, and this often happens,
it may come out only in one area—the
area of baldness.”
In a minority report, signed by only
one of the committee, the strange
theory was expounded that genius de-
veloped in a direct ratio with the loss
of hair between the temporal regions
and the crown of the head. It was
also pointed out that in a great num-
ber of TURNER's pictures a special
feature was the prominence given to
bald-headed fishermen in high lights.
This observation does not seem to repre-
sent a scientific attempt to handle the
problem; but it should not be rashly
dismissed on that account.
In a further article we hope to deal
with the effect of hard hats on the
conductivity of the branches of the Vth
nerve, the mentality of the Hairy Ainus
and other cognate questions.

sum, claiming that he had paid it under
the erroneous belief that the Union of
Democratic Control was an institution
for extending philanthropy to decaying
fishmongers. After disappearing from
sight for a while Oilivitch was next
heard of in the Censor's Department,
from which he was removed for sup-
pressing a number of postal orders, but
afterwards reinstated and transferred
to the Foreign Office. He left the
Foreign Office in June, 1918, as the
result of ill-health, and was given a
passport to Russia, where his medical
adviser resided.
Later.—It now transpires that Oili-
vitch was also employed at the Admir-

Food is unobtainable and Trotsky has

something is done the Soviet Commit-
tee will disintegrate and chaos ensue.
Already grave unrest is manifesting
itself in various parts of the country.
Hackoff, the able Minister of Justice
and Sociology, tells me that he has
already raised the weekly executions of
bourgeoisie from six to ten thousand, in
a desperate endeavour to prevent dis-
order on the part of the populace. It
is not too late for the Peace Conference
to act. Trotsky admitted to me yes-
terday that, on receipt of fifty thousand
pounds and a new pair of trousers as a
guarantee of good faith, he would allow
the Big Four to present their case to
him. He is firm on the subject of an
indemnity and the execution of Mr.
Bottomley. Otherwise he is modera-
tion itself. But the Allies must act at
once. To-morrow will be too late.

THE REVOLT.
THERE is a cupboard underneath the stair
Where moth and rust hold undisputed sway,
And here is hid my old civilian wear,
And my wife sits and plays with it all day,
Since Peace is imminent and, I'm advised,
I’ven the bard may be demobilised.
She is a woman who was clearly born
To be the monarch of a helpless male;
And when she says, “This overcoat is torn,”
“These flannel trousers are beyond the pale,”
“You can't be seen in any of those shirts,”
I acquiesce, but, goodness, how it hurts.
For they are rich with memories of Peace,
The soiled habiliments my lady loathes.
I do not long for trousers with a crease;
I do not want another crowd of clothes—
Particularly as you have to pay
Seventeen guineas for a suit to-day.
We are but worms, we husbands; yet 'tis said,
When the sad worm lies broken and at bay,
There comes a moment when the thing sees red,
And one such moment has occurred to-day;
“Look at this hat,” I said, “this old top-hat;
I will not wear another one like that.
“This is the hat I purchased in the High,
Still crude and young and ignorant of sin;
I wooed you in this hat—I don't know why;
This is the hat that I was married in ;
In it I walked on Sunday through the parks,
And even then the people made remarks.
“Now it is dead—the last of all its line—
Nothing like this shall mar the poet's Peace;
What have the nations fought for, wet and fine,
If not that ancient tyrannies should cease?
What use the Crowns of Europe coming croppers
If we are still to be the slaves of ‘toppers'?
“It speaks to me of many an ancient sore—
Of calls and cards and Sunday afternoon;
Of hideous wanderings from door to door
And choking necks and patent-leather shoon ;
“The War is won,' as Mr. Asquith said,
And all these evils are or should be dead.
“It moves me not that other men with wives
Have fall'n already in the old abyss,
Have let their women ruin all their lives
And ordered new atrocities like this.
President WILsoN will have missed success
If other men determine how I dress.
“Yonder there hangs the helmet of a Hun,
And I will hang this horror at its side;
Twin symbols of an epoch which is done,
These shall remind our children "My wife sighed,
“You’ll have to get another one, I fear; ”
And all I said was, “Very well, my dear.” A. P. H.
Commercial Candour.
Notice in a cobbler's window:—
“Will customers please bring their own paper for repairs?”
“Miss Carnegie wore a gown of white satin and point appliqué lace,
with a lace veil falling from a light brown coiffeur almost to the end
of the train.”—Daily Mirror.
It doesn't say whether the light-brown coiffeur was a page
or the best man.

[APRIL 30, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“BUSINEss BEFoRE PLEASURE.”
THE return of Abe Potash and Maw-
russ Perlmutter to London is not an
event to be regarded indifferently. The
light-hearted pair have evidently been
through some anxious times. Rosie
Potash can never have been a very
easy woman to live with. She has
not improved. And now that she
has infected Ruth Perlmutter with her
morbid jealousies the alert and as yet
unbroken Mawruss begins to know
something of what his long-suffering,
not to say occasionally abject, partner,
Abe, has had to endure these many
years. -
It was bad enough in the dress busi-
ness. But now they have gone into
films it is indefinitely worse. Every
reasonable person must know that you
can't produce really moving pictures
without an immense amount of late
office hours, dining and supping out
and that sort of thing, a fact which the
Rosies and Ruths of this world can't
be expected to appreciate. So that it
would be as well, think the ingenuous
entrepreneurs, if The Fatal Murder
were, so far as the ladies' parts are con-
cerned, cast from members of the two
households. Besides, what an excel-
lent way of keeping the money in the
family. However The Fatal Murder
is a dud ; Rosie and Ruth are not the
right shape; and film acting, with the
necessary pep, is not a thing you can
just acquire by wishing so.
What is wanted, says the voluble
young hustler in the firm, who alone
seems to know anything of the busi-
ness, is real actresses as distinguished
from members of the directors' families,
and above all a good vampire. A
vampire is the yery immoral and under-
dressed type of woman that wrecks
hearts and homes, and without which
no film with a high moral purpose is
conceivable. You must have shadows
to throw up the light. And on this
principle all the uplift and moral in-
struction of that potent instrument of
grace, the cinematograph, is based—a
fact which will not have escaped the
notice of cinema-goers.
When Rita Sismondi appears in an
evil, Futurist black-and-white gown by
Viola you can tell at once she is the
goods. But naturally Abe's first thought
is, “What will Rosie say?” His second,
shared by Mawruss: “Hang Rosie! We
shall both like this lady.” Finances are
not flourishing, but the crooked manager
of the very unbusinesslike bank that
is financing the P. and P. Film Co.
harbours designs on the virtue of Rita,
who has this commodity in a measure
unusual with film vampires (or usual, I
forget which), and is just a slightly
adventurous prude out for a good time.
He accordingly advances more money
for The Guilty Dollar on condition that
Izita be engaged, and yet more money
on condition that she be not fired by
any machinations of jealous wives.
Rosie, indeed, says a good deal when
she turns up at a rehearsal and finds
the vampire clad in the third of a gown
hazardously suspended on her gracious
shoulders by bead straps, and Mawruss
and Abe demonstrating how in their
opinion the kissing scenes should be
conducted so as to make a really notable
production. However, the vampire's
film vices make the success of the com-
pany, and her private virtues bring all
to a happy ending.
The story need hardly concern us. It
is not plausible, which matters nothing
at all. Mr. YoRKE and Mr. LEONARD are
the essential outfit, and it seems to me
they are better than ever. One simply
has to laugh, louder and oftener than is
seemly for a self-respecting Englishman.
No doubt their authors, Messrs. GLASS
and GooDMAN, give them plenty of good
things to say, but it is the astonishing
finish and precision of their technique
which make their work so pleasant to
watch. If it throws into awkward
relief the amateurishness of some of
their associates that can't be helped.
Miss WERA GoRDON's Rosie is a good
performance, and Miss JULIA BRUNs,
the vampire, seemed to me to make with
considerable skill and subtlety a real
character (within the limits allowed b
the farcical nature of the scheme) out of
what might easily have been uninvit-
ingly crude. T.
OUR FRIEND THE FISH.
“WHAT is a sardine 2" was a ques-
tion much before the Courts some few
years ago, not unprofitably for certain
gentlemen wearing silk, and the correct
solution I never heard; but I can sup-
ply, from personal observation, one
answer to the query, and that is,
“An essential ingredient in London
humour.” For without this small but
sapid fish—whatever he may really be,
whether denizen of the Sardinian sea,
immature Cornish pilchard, or mere
plebeian sprat well oiled—numbers of
our fellow-men and fellow-women, with
all the will in the world, might never
raise a laugh. As it is, thanks to his
habit of lying in excessive compression
within his tin tabernacle, and the pre-
valence in these congested days of too
many passengers on the Tubes, on the
Underground and in the omnibuses,
whoever would publicly remove gravity
has but to set up the sardine compari-
son and be rewarded.
Why creatures so remote from man
as fishes—cold-blooded inhabitants of
an element in which man exists only
so long as he keeps on the surface;
mute, incredible and incapable of ex-
changing any intercourse with him—
why these should provide the Cockney,
the dweller in the citiest City of the
world, with so much of the material
of jocoseness is an odd problem. But
they do. Herrings, when cured either
by smoke or sun, notoriously contribute
to the low comedian's success. The
mere word “kipper” has every girl in
the gallery in a tittering ecstasy. But
outside the Halls it is the sardine that
conquers.
In one day this week I witnessed the
triumph of the sardine on three differ-
ent occasions, and it was always hearty
and complete.
The first time was in a lift at Chan-
cery Lane. It is not normally a very
busy station, but our attendant having,
as is now the rule, talked too long with
the attendant of a neighbouring lift, we
were more than full before the descent
began. We were also cross and impa-
tient, the rumble, from below, of trains
that we might just as well be in doing
nothing to steady our nerves. -
But help came—and came from that
strange quarter the mighty ocean, from
Chancery Lane so distant “Might as
well,” said a burly labourer (or, for all I
know, burly receiver of unemployment
dole)—“might as well be sardines in
a tin ' "
Straightway we all laughed and
viewed our lost time with more serenity.
Later I was in a 'bus in Victoria
Street, on its way to the Strand. As
many persons were inside, seated or
standing on their own and on others'
feet, as it should be permitted to hold,
but still another two were let in by the
harassed conductress.
“I say, Miss,” said the inevitable
wag, who was one of the standing
passengers, “steady on. We're more
than full up already, you know. Do
you take us for sardines?”
And again mirth rocked us.
Finally, that night I was among
the stream of humanity which pours
down Williers Street from the theatres
for half-an-hour or so between 10.40
and 11.10, all in some mysterious way
to be absorbed into the trains or the
trams and conveyed home. After some
desperate struggles on Charing Cross
platform I found myself a suffering
unit in yet another dense throng in a
compartment going West; and again,
amid delighted merriment, some one
likened us to sardines.
It is not much of a joke, but you
will notice that it so seldom fails that
one wonders why any effort is ever
made to invent a better.

“I DIDN'T. BUT BY THE TIME I Discover ED THAT I DIDN'T-weLL, I DID."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Madam Constantia (LONGMANs) is a war story, but of an
earlier and more picturesque war. A simple tale, I am
bound to call it, revolving entirely round a situation not
altogether unknown to fiction, in which the hero and heroine,
being of opposite sides, love and fight one another simul-
taneously. Actually the scene is set during the American
struggle for independence, thus providing a sufficiency of
pomp and circumstance in the way of fine uniforms and
pretty frocks; and the protagonists are Captain Carter, of
the British service, and Constantia Wilmer, daughter of the
American who had captured him. Perhaps you may recall
that the identical campaign has already provided a very
similar position (reversed) in Miss Elizabeth's Prisoner. It is
only a deserved tribute to the skill with which Mr. JEFFERSoN
CARTER has told this adventure of his namesake to admit
that I am left with an uncertainty, not usual to the review-
ing experience, whether it is in fact a true or an imagined
affair. In any event its development follows a well-trodden
path. We have the captive, jealous in honour, susceptible
and exasperatingly Quixotic, doubly enchained by his word
and the charms of his fair wardress; the lady's conspicuous
ill-treatment of him at the first, a slight mystery, some
escapes and counterplots, and on the appointed page the
matrimonial finish that hardly the most pessimistic reader
can ever have felt as other than assured. Fact or fiction,
you may spend an agreeable hour in watching the course
of Captain Carter's courtship overcoming its rather obvious
obstacles.
Because I have so great an admiration for their bene-
ficent activities, I have always wanted to meet a novel
with a lot about dentists in it, and now Miss DoRo THY M.
RICHARDsoN, in The Tunnel (DUckworth), has satisfied my
desire. Dentists—a houseful of them—spittoons, revolv-
ing basins; patients going upstairs with sinking feelings;
wondering at the pattern on the wallpaper; going down
triumphant. Teeth. Appointment books. Dentists every-
where. This is not a quotation, but very like one, for Miss
RICHARDSON affects the modern manner. Though one of
the dentists is quite the most agreeable person in the book,
he isn't the hero, because the author is much too clever
to have anything of the sort. Her method, exploited
some time ago in that remarkable book, Pointed Roofs, is
to get right inside one Miriam Henderson and keep on
writing out her thoughts with as little explanation of her
circumstances as possible, so that The Tunnel, to anyone
who has missed the earlier books, must be very nearly un-
intelligible. Even the sincere admirer of Miss Richard-
soN's talent will begin to wonder how many more books
at the present rate of progress must be required to bring
Miriam to, say, threescore years and ten. My own belief
is that if her creator is ever so ill-advised as to put her
beneath a 'bus or drop her down a lift-well, she herself will
be gone too; and for that I should be sorry, since I agree
with almost all the nice things Miss MAY SINCLAIR says of
the earlier books in an appreciation here reprinted from The
Egoist. Miss RICHARDsoN has evolved a way of writing a
novel which somehow suggests the Futurist way of paint-
ing a picture; but The Tunnel has left me wondering
whether she has not carried her method a little too far.

It seems to me that some of her heroine's thoughts were
not worth recording; but perhaps when another four or
five books have been added to Miriam's life-history I may
discover what the scheme may be that lies behind them
all, and change my mind.
More than once before this I have enjoyed the dexterity
of Miss Violet HUNT in a certain type of social satire;
but I regret to say that the expectation with which I opened
The Last Ditch (STANLEY PAUL) was doomed to some dis-
appointment. The idea was promising enough—a study of
our British best people confronting the ordeal of world-war;
but somehow it failed to capture me. For one reason it is
told in a series of letters—a dangerous method at any time.
As usual, these are far too long and literary to be genuine;
though they keep up a rather irritating pretence of reality
by repetitions of the same events in correspondence from
different writers. Moreover, letters whose concern is the
progress of recruiting or the novelty of war can hardly at
this time avoid an effect of having been delayed in the post.

“inscribe on their tombs, “Here lie the first soldiers of the
United States to fall on the soil of France for Justice and
Liberty' . . . Corporal Gresham, Private Enright, Private
Hay, in the name of France I thank you.” As another
matter of historical interest it may be stated that the first
shot of the War on the American side was fired by Battery C
of the 6th Field Artillery, “without waiting on going into
position at the time set. The men dragged a gun forward
in the early morning aſ October 23rd, and sent a shell at
the enemy. There was no particular target. The aim was
in the general direction of Berlin. The gun has been sent
to West Point as a relic.”
I must assume that Such Stuff as Dreams (MURRAY) was
written by C.E. W. LAwitHNCE with a purpose, but it remains
obscure to me. A smart young married clerk in the oil
business falls off the top of a bus on to his head and, from a
confirmed materialist, becomes something not unlike a con-
firmed lunatic, with a faculty for seeing flaming emanations
But all this would have
mattered little if Miss
HUNT had chosen her
aristocrats from per-
possible to take more
interest. But the plain
fact is that you never
met so tedious a set.
They are notwitty; they
are not even wicked to
any significant extent.
They simply produce
(at least in my case) no
effect whatever. Per-
haps this may all be of
intention; the author
may have meant to
harrow us with the
spectacle of our old
nobility expiring as
nonentities. But in
that case the picture
is manifestly unfair.

which enable him to
place the owners of
them in the true scale
of human and spiritual
values. He discovers
that his wife's uncle, a
whimsical but essen-
tially tedious drunkard,
is a better man than
the egregious New Re-
ligionist pastor—a dis-
covery I made for my-
self without falling off
a bus. I was forced
to the conclusion that
these and equally dull,
or duller, folk must
exist or have existed,
and that it could not
possibly have been ne-
cessary to invent them.
And if I am right then
it obviously needs a
greater sympathy than
I can command to do
—dull as the last ditch-water.
In America in France (MURRAY) Lieut.-Col. FREDERICK
PALMER, a member of the Staff Corps of the United States
Army, sets out to tell the story of the making of an army.
This is the first book by Colonel PALMER that has come my
way, but I find that he has written four others, all of which
I judge by their titles to be concerned with the War. Be
that as it may, I welcome America in France both because
it gives a narrative of America's tremendous effort, and
because the book is written with a modesty which is very
pleasing. America came to the job of fighting as a learner.
Her soldiers did not boast of what they were going to do, but
sat down solidly to learn, in order that she might be useful
in the fighting-line. How she achieved her purpose the
world now knows. If any fault is to be found with the
author's style, it is that the limpidity and evenness of its
flow make great events less easy of distinction than perhaps
they might be; but most people will hail this as a merit
rather than a fault, and I agree with them. Colonel
PAIMER records the names of the first three Americans who
died fighting. The French General to whose unit they
were attached ordered a ceremonial parade and made a
speech in which he asked that the mortal remains of these
justice to this type of narrative, with its presuppositions and
inferences. Sir A. CoNAN Doy LE has much to answer for.
I do not remember the precise number of murders which
occur in Droonin' Watter (ALLEN AND UN win), but readers
of this sensational story can accept my assurance that Mr.
J. S. FLETCHER has a quick and decisive way of meting out
justice (or injustice) to his characters. In fact, from the
very start, when a man with a black patch over his eye
walks into Berwick-upon-Tweed and takes lodgings with
Mrs. Moneylaws (the mother of the man who tells the tale),
the pace is red-hot. It is easy enough to discover im-
probabilities in such a yarn as this, but the only important
question is whether one wants to discover what happens in
the end, and I confess without a blush that I did want to
follow Mr. J. S. FLETCHER to the last page. Let me how-
ever beg him in his next book to give the word “yon” a
rest; four “yons” in eleven lines is a clear case of over-
crowding; and I invite the attention of the Limited Labour
Party to this scandal.

LETTERS TO PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.
(No answers required, thank you.)
To Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, Head of the German Peace
Delegation.
The enthralling volume, entitled Preliminary Terms of
Peace, on which your attention is being engrossed at the
present moment, is said to be of the same length as A Tale
of Two Cities. In other respects there is little resemblance
traceable between the two works. A more striking likeness
is to be found between the present volume and a document
produced (also in the neighbourhood of Paris) by the late
Prince BISMARCK in 1871. On your return home, if the
fancy appeals to you, you might, out of these two pub-
lications, construct a very readable romance and call it
Two Tales of One City. I think this would be a better
name for it than Vice-Versailles.
To Signor Orlando.
Apart from our love for Italy we are, of course, naturally
prejudiced in favour of a man who got his surname from
one of our own SHAKsPEARE's heroes, and has consequently
given us several easy chances of making little As-you-like-it
jokes for the Press in our simple unsophisticated way,
All the same I think you were wrong in dropping out of
the Big Four like that. If every other Allied delegate were
to go off home whenever he couldn't get his own way, or
whenever he differed from President WILSON, there might
be nobody left to meet the German representatives or to
sign any sort of Peace terms. The enemy might even start
a Big Four of their own and begin to talk. What should
we do then? We might have to send for Marshal Foch.
I'm not sure that in any case this wouldn't be the best
lan.
p. But perhaps you will be back in Paris before this letter
reaches you. All roads lead to Rome, and there must be at
least one that leads out of it again.
To Ferdinand, For.
If news of the outside world ever reaches you in your
earth, and you read the discussions on the question whether
your old friend WILLIAM ought to be hanged, it can hardly
have escaped Your Nosiness that nothing is said about your
own claim to similar treatment. Those who never rightly
appreciated you may imagine that you will meekly consent
to forgo that claim. But, if I know anything of your
proud and princely nature, you are, on the other hand,
bitterly chagrined at the thought that you have been for-
gotten so soon.
To a British “Sportsman.”
I have often seen you of an afternoon in war-time hang-
ing about in groups along my workaday street, poring
over what you regarded as the vital news of the day. It
was not a report of any battle in which your brothers were
fighting, and, if I had asked you breathlessly, “Who won 2''
you would not have said, “The British "; you would have
said, “Solly JoBL's colt." You had never seen the horse,
but you had half-a-dollar of your War-bonus on him, or
more probably on one of those who also ran. To-day there
are no silly battles to take up good space in your evening
print; and, better still, there is no day without its racing
matter; no more curtailing of the King of Sports to the
lamentable detriment of our national horse-breeding, a sub-
ject so close to your heart. The War is indeed well over.

You see, we let ourselves go, once
for all, over the Armistice, and, though there will be plenty
of celebrations for you, we shan't forget ourselves again.
There will be bands, of course, and bunting, and we shall
read the directions in the papers, and buy expensive tickets
and get to our seats early. But we shall be respectable and
inarticulate this time, like the present exhibition at the Royal
Academy. Besides, we have no nice things to shout when
the pageants go by, like “Vive la Victoire / " or “ Viva la
Pace / " and even if we had we should all wait for somebody
else to start shouting them.
But you are not to be disappointed; we shall really be
glad to welcome you, though we do it in that strange way
we have of taking everything as it comes.
I suppose you are bound to assist at your own celebrations,
otherwise I should recommend you to be content to read
about them next day—about the thundering cheers, the wild
enthusiasm that swept like a flame through the vast multi-
tudes, and how “the red glare on Skiddaw roused the Canon
(RAwNSLEY) of Carlisle.”
To a Multi-Millionaire.
It must be a great satisfaction to you to see how highly
the CHANCELLon of THE Exchequer appreciates the loss
which the country will sustain by your eventual decease;
and that he has proposed to increase materially the amount
to be raised out of your estate as a national souvenir of
your commercial activities, Indeed you may reflect that,
splendid and profitable as your life has been, nothing in it
will have become you so much as the leaving of it. With
such a thought in your mind the prospect of death should
be robbed of a large proportion of its sting.
To a New Knight (Scots).
Out of the eight hundred million pounds' worth of Gov-
ernment material left over from the War, of which two
hundred million pounds' worth is expected to be realised
in the current year, you should have no difficulty in securing
a pair of knightly spurs at quite a reasonable price. They
ought to go well with a kilt.

“THEY ‘ALSO RUN ' WHO ONLY STAND AND WAIT."
THE ARRIVAL OF BLACKMAN'S
WARBLER.
I AM become an Authority on Birds.
It happened in this way.
The other day we heard the Cuckoo
in Hampshire. (The next morning the
papers announced that the Cuckoo had
been heard in Devonshire—possibly a
different one, but in no way superior
to ours except in the matter of its Press
agent.) Well, everybody in the house
said, “Did you hear the Cuckoo 2" to
everybody else, until I began to get
rather tired of it; and, having told
everybody several times that I had
heard it, I tried to make the conversa-
tion more interesting. So, after my
tenth “Yes,” I added quite casually:—
“But I haven't heard the Tufted
Pipit yet. It's funny why it should
be so late this year.”
“Is that the same as the Tree Pipit?”
said my hostess, who seemed to know
more about birds than I had hoped.
“Oh, no,” I said confidently.
“What's the difference exactly?"
“Well, one is tufted,” I said, doing
my best, “and the other—er—climbs
trees.”
“Oil, I see.”
“And of course the eggs are more
speckled,” I added, gradually acquiring
confidence. -
“I often wish I knew more about
birds,” she said regretfully. “You must
tell us something about them now we've
got you here.” -
And all this because of one miserable
Cuckoo !
“By all means,” I said, wondering
how long it would take to get a book
about birds down from London.
However, it was easier than I thought.
We had tea in the garden that after-
noon, and a bird of some kind struck
up in the plane-tree.
“There, now,” said my hostess,
“what's that ?”
I listened with my head on one side.
The bird said it again.
“That's the Lesser Bunting,” I said
hopefully.
“The Lesser Bunting,” said an
earnest-looking girl; “I shall always
remember that.”
I hoped she wouldn't, but I could
hardly say so. Fortunately the bird
lesser-bunted again, and I seized the
opportunity of playing for safety.
“Or is it the Sardinian White-
throat?” I wondered. “They have
very much the same note during the
breeding season. But of course the
eggs are more speckled,” I added
casually.
And so on for the rest of the evening.
You see how easy it is.
However the next aſternoon a most
unfortunate occurrence occurred. A real
Bird Authority came to tea. As soon
as the information leaked out I sent up
a hasty prayer for bird-silence until we
had got him safely out of the place;
but it was not granted. Our feathered
songster in the plane-tree broke into
his little piece.
“There," said my hostess—“there's
that bird again.” She turned to me.
“What did you say it was 2."
I hoped that the Authority would
speak first, and that the others would
then accept my assurance that they
had misunderstood me the day before;
but he was entangled at that moment
in a watercress sandwich, the loose
ends of which were still waiting to be
tucked away.
I looked anxiously at the girl who
had promised to remember, in case she
wanted to say something, but she also
was silent. Everybody was silent ex-
cept that miserable bird.
Well, I had to have another go at it.
“Blackman's Warbler,” I said firmly.
“Oh, yes,” said my hostess.
“Blackman's Warbler; I shall always
remember that,” lied the earnest-look-
ing girl. -
The Authority, who was free by this
time, looked at me indignantly.
“Nonsense,” he said; “it’s the Chiff-
chaff.”
Everybodyelse looked at mereproach-
fully. I was about to say that “Black-

man's Warbler” was the local name for
the Chiff-chaffin our part of Flint, when
the Authority spoke again.
“The Chiff-chaff,” he said to our
hostess with an insufferable air of
knowledge.
I wasn't going to stand that.
“So I thought when I heard it first,”
I said, giving him a gentle smile.
It was now the Authority's turn to
get the reproachful looks.
“Are they very much alike?" my
hostess asked me, much impressed.
“Very much. Blackman's Warbler
is often mistaken for the Chiff-chaff,
even by so-called experts"—and I
turned to the Authority and added,
“Have another sandwich, won't you?”
—“and particularly so, of course, dur-
ing the breeding season. It is true that
the eggs are more speckled, but—”
“Bless my soul,” said the Authority,
but it was easy to see that he was
shaken, “I should think I know a Chiff-
chaff when I hear one.”
“Ah, but do you know a Black-
man's Warbler ? One doesn't often hear
then in this country. Now in Switzer-
land ny
The bird said “Chiff-chaff" again with
an almost indecent plainness of speech.
“There you are I " I said trium-
phantly. “Listen,” and I held up a
finger.
Obviously a Blackman's Warbler.”
Everybody looked at the Authority.
He was wondering how long it would
take to get a book about birds down
from London, and deciding that it
couldn't be done that afternoon. Mean-
while “Blackman's Warbler" sounded
too much like the name of something
to be repudiated. For all he had caught
of our mumbled introduction I might
have been Blackman myself.
“Possibly you're right,” he said re-
luctantly.
Another bird said “Chiff-chaff" from
another tree, and I thought it wise to
be generous. “There,” I said, “now
that was a Chiff-chaff.”
The earnest-looking girl remarked
(silly creature) that it sounded just like
the other one, but nobody took any
notice of her. They were all busy ad-
miring me.
Of course I mustn't meet the Auth-
ority again, because you may be pretty
sure that when he got back to his books
he looked up Blackman's Warbler and
found that there was no such animal.
But if you mix in the right society and
only see the wrong people once it is
really quite easy to be an authority on
birds—or, I imagine, on anything else.

AN ECHO OF “SHOW SUNDAY.”
Wisitor. “WHAT’S THIS FELLOW DOIN' IN THE CORNER.?”
Visitor. “AWFULLY DECENT OF HIM—WHAT' "
Artist. “OH, HE's THERE JUST TO HELP THE coxſposſTION.”
THE DOMESTIG QUESTION SOLVED.
LAST Thursday, at a registry-office, I
obtained the favour of an interview
with a domestic artist and was able
(by reason of a previous conference
with my friend Freshfield—like myself
a demobilised bachelor author) to face
the ordeal with some degree of confi-
dence.
Mrs. Milton, widow, fifty-five, excep-
tional references, who proposed, if
everything about me seemed satisfact-
ory, to rule my household, was as
suave as one has any right to expect
nowadays; but when she dictated the
terms I gathered that she would be
sufficiently dangerous if roused.
She knew what bachelors were, she
did, and wasn't going to take a place
where a lot of comp'ny was kept.
I assured her on this point. My
friend, Mr. Freshfield, I said, would
come once a week, every Monday, to
dine and sleep, but beyond that I
should put no strain upon her powers
of entertainment.
Mrs. Milton further said that she
would require at least two afternoons
and one evening a week. Here was
my opportunity to appear generous.
“Two afternoons and one evening?”
I said. “My dear friend and fellow-
worker, you can have every Wednesday
and Thursday from after breakfast on
the former to practically dinner-time
(eight o'clock) on the latter. No ques-
tions will be asked of you or of the
piano or gramophone, both of which
instruments you will find in smooth
running order. I am away,” I added,
“every Wednesday and Thursday.”
That clinched it. Hiding her sur-
prise as well as she could under an
irreproachable bonnet and toupee, Mrs.
Milton expressed her readiness to
accompany me then and there, and to
superintend the disappearance of my
coals and marmalade.
Perhaps you have guessed that I
propose to spend every Wednesday
night at Freshfield's place, and that
the complete success of the scheme has
been assured by the making of a similar
agreement between Freshfield and a
person holding corresponding views to
those of Mrs. Milton.
Thus Freshfield and I have each
secured the full seven days' attendance
by a device pleasing to all concerned,
After locking up the MELPA and
GEORGE Robey records on Wednesday
mornings and with the knowledge that
the piano is past serious injury, I
depart for Freshfield's (vid the Club for
lunch) each week with a light heart.
My collaborator is all for keeping
this solution of a harassing problem to
ourselves. I say “No.” The general
adoption of such a scheme, with altera:
tions to suit individual cases, would, I
think, be a nail in the coffin of Bol-
shevism in the home.

HATE HANGIN’ ROUND A PLACE WHERE ONE MIGHT BE
THE CHURCH AND PEACE.
THE acquiescence of the Coventry
Peace Celebration Committee in the
Bishop of CoveNTRY's view that the
Lady GoDIVA of their pageant should
be fully clothed is leading not only to
many innovations in the representa-
tions of history all over the country,
but to a recrudescence of ecclesiastical
power which is affording the liveliest
satisfaction to Lord HUGH CECIL.
For already several other divines have
followed suit. It is agreeable, for ex-
ample, to the very reasonable wishes of
the DEAN and Chapter of Westminster
that the Westminster Peace Celebration
Committee have decided that NELL
Gwyn N shall either be excluded from
the Whitehall procession altogether or
shall figure as a Mildmay deaconess.
Acting under the influence of a local
curate, the Athelney Peace Celebra-
tion Committee have unanimously re-
solved that in these hard times, when
(as the curate pointed out) food is not
too plentiful, it would be better if KING
ALFRED cooked the cakes properly and
they were afterwards distributed.
So many watering - places claim
CANUTE as their own that he may be
expected to be multiplied exceedingly
in the approaching Peace revels; but
from more than one Pastoral Letter it
may be gathered that the Episcopal
Bench is very wisely in favour of the
King's retirement from the margin of
the ocean before his shoes are actually
wet. It is held that in these days of
leather - shortage and the need for
economy no risks should be run with
footwear.
Other laudable efforts in the direc-
tion of economy are to be made, again
through the earnest solicitude of the
Establishment, in connection with the
impersonation of Sir WALTER RALEIGH
and KING John. With the purpose of
saving Sir WALTER's cloak from stain
and possible injury the puddle at QUEEN
ELIZABETH's feet will be only a painted
one, while, owing to the exorbitant
price of laundry-work at the moment,
it has been arranged that only a few
of KING JoHN's more negligible articles
shall be consigned to the Wash.
Hum Duplicity in Paris.
“Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied
simply, pointing to Herr Dandsbery and say-
ing: “I present to you Herr Landsberg.’”
The Star.
HOME FATIGUES.
How oft I tried by smart intrigue
To do the British Army,
And dodge each rightly-termed
Fatigue
Which nearly drove me barmy.
In vain' Whoever else they missed
My name was always on the list.
And so, while other minds were set
On smashing Jerry Bosch up
With rifle, bomb and bayonet,
I chiefly learned to wash-up,
To peel potatoes by the score,
Sweep out a room and scrub the floor.
Thus, now that I have left the ranks,
The plain unvarnished fact is
That through those three rough years,
and thanks
To very frequent practice,
I, who was once a nascent snob,
Am master of the menial's job.
To-day I count this no disgrace
When “maids" have gone to
blazes,
But take our late Eliza's place
And win my lady's praises,
As she declares in grateful mood
The Army did me worlds of good.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MUD LARKS.
“So,” said Albert Edward, “I clapped
him on the back and said, ‘You were
at Geelong College in 1910, and your
name's Cazenovo, isn't it 2'" -
“To which he made reply, “My
name's Jones and I never heard of
Geewhizz," and knocked you down and
trod on you for your dashed familiarity,”
said the Babe.
“Nothing of the sort. He was
delighted to meet me again—de-lighted.
He's coming to munch with us to-
morrow evening, by the way, so you
might sport the tablecloth, for once,
William old dear, and tell the cook to
put it across Og, the fatted capon, and
generally strive to live down your repu-
tation as the worst Mess President the
world has ever seen. You will, I know
—for my sake."
Next morning, when I came down
to breakfast, I found a note from
him saying that he had gone to the
Divisional Races with his dear old
college chum, Cazenove; also the fol-
lowing addenda:—
“P.S.–If William should miss a few
francs from the Mess Fund tell him I
will return it fourfold ere night. I am
on to a sure thing.
“P.P.S.–If MacTavish should raise
a howl about his fawn leggings, tell
him I have borrowed them for the day
as I understand there will be W.A.D.'s
present, and noblesse oblige.”
At a quarter past eight that night
he returned, accompanied by a pleasant-
looking gunner subaltern, whom we
gathered to be the Cazenove person.
I say “gathered,” for Albert Edward
did not trouble to introduce the friend
of his youth, but, flinging himself into
a chair, attacked his food in a sulky
silence which endured all through the
repast. Mr. Cazenove, on the other
hand, was in excellent form. He had
spent a beautiful day, he said, and
didn't care who knew it. A judge of
horseflesh from the cradle, he had
spotted the winner every time, backed
his fancy like a little man and had
been very generously rewarded by the
Totalizator. He was contemplating a
trip to Brussels in a day or so. Was
his dear old friend Albert Edward
coming 2
His “dear old friend" (who was eating
his thumb-nails instead of his savoury)
scowled and said he thought not.
The gunner wagged his head sagely.
“Ah, well, old chap, if you will bet on
horses which roar like a den of lions
you must take the consequences.”
Albert Edward writhed. “That ani-
mal used to win sprints in England;
do you know that 2"
Mr. Cazenove shrugged his shoulders.
“He may have thirty years ago. All
I'd back him to win now would be an
old-age pension. Well, I warned you,
didn't I?’’
Albert Edward lost control. “When
I'm reduced to taking advice on racing
form from a Tasmanian I'll chuck the
game and hie me to a monkery. Why,
look at that bit of bric-à-brac you were
riding to-day; a decent God-fearing
Australian wouldn't be seen dead in a
ten-acre paddock with it.”
Mr. Cazenove spluttered even more
furiously. “That's a dashed good horse
I'll have you know.”
“I am not alluding to his morals, but
to his appearance,” said Albert Edward;
“I've seen better-looking hat-racks.”
“I'd back him to lick the stuffing
out of anything you've got in this unit,
anyway," Cazenove snorted.
“Don't be rash, Charlie,” Albert
Edward warned; “your lucky afternoon
has gone to your head. Why, I've got
an old mule here could give that bone-
shaker two stone and beat him by a
furlong in five.”
The gunner sprang to his feet. “Done
with you!” he roared. “Done with
you here and now !”
Albert Edward appeared to be some-
what taken back. “Don’t be silly,
man,” he soothed. “It's pitch dark
outside and cut up with trenches. Sit
down and have some more of this rare
old port, specially concocted for us by
the E.F.C.’’ -
But Mr. Cazenove was thoroughly
aroused. “You’re hedging,” he sneered;
“you're scared.”
“Nonsense,” said Albert Edward.
“I have never known what fear is—
not since the Armistice, anyhow. I am
one of the bravest men I have ever
met. What are you doing with all that
money?”
“Putting it down for you to cover,”
said Cazenove firmly.
Albert Edward sighed. “All right,
then, if you will have it so. William,
old bean, I'm afraid I shall have to
trouble you for a trifle more out of the
Mess Fund. Noblesse oblige, you know.”
MacTavish and the Babe departed
with the quest to prepare his mount
for the ordeal, while Albert Edward
and I sought out Ferdinand and Isa-
bella, our water-cart pair. Isabella
was fast asleep, curled up like a cat and
purring pleasantly, but Ferdinand was
awake, meditatively gnawing through
the wood-work of his stall. With the
assistance of the line-guard we saddled
and bridled him; but at the stable door
he dug his toes in. It was long past
his racing hours, he gave us to under-
stand, and his union wouldn't permit
it. He backed all round the standings,
treading on recumbent horses, tripping
over bails, knocking uprights flat and
bringing acres of tin roofing clattering
down upon our heads, Isabella encour-
aging him with ringing fanfares of
applause.
At length we roused out the grooms
and practically carried him to the
starting-point.
“You’ve been the devil of a time,”
William grumbled. “Cazenove's been
waiting for twenty minutes. See that
light over there? That's where Mac-
Tavish is. He's the winning-post.
Keep straight down the mud-track to-
wards it and you'll be all right. Don't
swing sideways or you'll get bunkered.
Form line. Come up the mule. Back,
Cazenove, back! Steady. Go!”
The rivals clapped heels to their
steeds and were swallowed up in the
night. I looked at my watch, the
hands pointed to 10.30 exactly. Wil-
liam and I lit cigarettes and waited.
At 10.42 MacTavish walked into us,
his lamp had given out and he wanted
a new battery. -
“Who won 2" we inquired.
“Won?” he asked. “They haven't
started yet, have they 2”
“Left here about ten minutes ago,”
said William. “Do you mean to say
you've seen nothing of them 2 " -
At that moment two loud voices,
accompanied by the splash of liquid
and the crash of tin, struck our ears
from different points of the compass.
“Sounds to me as if somebody had
found a watery grave over to the left,"
said the Babe.
“Sounds to me as if somebody had
returned to stables over to the right,"
said I.
We trotted away to investigate.
'Twas as I thought; Ferdinand had
homed to his Isabella and was backing
round the standings once more, trailing
the infuriated Albert Edward after him,
sheets of corrugated-iron falling about
them like leaves in Wallombrosa.
“Bolted straight in here and scraped
me off against the roof,” panted the
latter. “Suppose the confounded apple-
fancier won ages ago, didn't he?”
“He’s upside down in the Tuning
Fork trench system at the present mo-
ment,” said I. “The Babe and the
grooms are digging him out. If you
hurry up you'll win yet.”
We roused out the guard, bore the
reluctant Ferdinand back to the course
and by eleven o'clock had restarted him.
At 11.10 William returned to report
that the digging party had salved the
Cazenove pair and got them going
again.
“Too late,” said I; “Albert Edward
must have won in a walk by now. He
left here at . . .”

sheet-iron cut short my words. Ferdin-
and had, it appeared, returned to stables
Once more.
Suddenly something hurtled out of
the gloom and crashed into us. It was
the Babe.
“What's the matter now 2 Where
are you going?” we asked.
“Wire-cutters, quick!” he gasped and
hurtled onwards towards the saddle-
TOOD1.
“Hello there !” came the hail of
MacTavish from up the course. “I
s-say, what about this blessed race?
I'm f-f-rozen s-s-tiff out here. I'm
about f-f-fed up, I t-tell you.”
William groaned. “As if we all
weren't!” he protested. “If all the
Mess Funds for the next three weeks
weren't involved I'd make the silly
fools chuck it. Here, you, run and tell
Albert Edward to get a move on.”
I found Ferdinand rapidly levelling
the remainder of the standings, play-
ing his jockey at the end of his reins as
a fisherman plays a salmon.
“This cursed donkey won't steer at
all,” Albert Edward growled. “Side-
slips all over the place like a wet tyre.
Has Cazenove won yet?”
“Not yet,” said I. “He’s wound
up in the Switch Line wire entangle-
ments now. The Babe and the wreck-
ing gang are busy chopping him out.
There's still time.”
“Then drag Isabella out in front of
this brute,” said he. “Quick, man,
quick ' "
At 11.43, by means of a brimming
nose-bag, I had enticed Isabella forth,
and the procession started in the fol-
lowing order: First, myself, dragging
Isabella and dangling the bait. Se-
condly, Isabella. Thirdly, the racers,
Ferdinand and Albert Edward, the
latter belting Isabella with a surcingle
whenever she faltered. Lastly, the
line-guard, speeding Ferdinand with a
doubled stirrup leather. We toiled down
the mud track at an average velocity
of 25 m.p.h., halting occasionally for
Isabella to feed and the line-guard to
rest his arm. I have seen faster things
in my day.
Then, just as we were arriving at our
journey's end we collided with another
procession. It was the wrecking gang,
laden with the implements of their
trade (shovels, picks, wire-cutters, ropes,
planks, waggon-jacks, etc.), and escort-
ing in their midst Mr. Cazenove and his
battered racehorse. Both competitors
immediately claimed the victory:—
“Beaten you this time, Albert Ed-
ward, old man.” . . . “On the con-
trary, Charles, old chap, I won hands
down.” . . . “But, my good fellow,

“Oh, dry up, you two, and leave

William.
“By the way, where is the winning-
post?” -
“The winning-post,” we echoed.
“Yes, where is he ”

They came. And I at the appointed hour
Watched them arrive before the muted dwelling

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, April 29th. — When the
House of Commons re-assembled this
afternoon a good many gaps were no-
ticeable on the green benches. They
were not due, however, to the New
Year's Honours, which made a belated
appearance this morning, for not a
single Member of Parliament has been
ennobled. The notion that not one of
the seven hundred is worthy of eleva-
tion is, of course, unthinkable. But by-
elections are so chancy.
Mr. JEREMIAH MACWEAGH still has
some difficulty in realising that the
Irish centre of gravity has shifted from
Westminster to Dublin. He indig-
nantly refused to accept an answer to
one of his questions
from little Mr. PRATT,
and loudly demanded
the corporeal presence
of the CHIEF SECRE-
TARY. Mr. MACPHER-
SoN, however, con-
siders that his duty
requires him to remain
in Ireland, where Mr.
MACWEAGH's seventy
Sinn Fein colleagues
are keeping him suffi-
ciently busy,
In explaining the
swollen estimates of
the Ministry of
Labour, Sir Robert
HoRNE pointed out
that it is now charged
with the functions
formerly appertaining
to half-a-dozen other
Departments. He has
indeed become a sort
of administrative Pooh - Bah. Unlike
that functionary, however, he was not
“born sneering.” On the contrary, he
made a most sympathetic speech, chiefly
devoted to justifying the much-abused
unemployment donation, which ac-
counts for twenty-five out of the thirty-
eight millions to be spent by his De-
partment this year. But let no one
mistake him for a mere HoRNE of Plenty,
pouring out benefits indiscriminately
upon the genuine unemployed and the
work-shy. He has already deprived
some seventeen thousand potential
domestics of their unearned increment,
and he promises ruthless prosecution
of all who try to cheat the State in
future.
Criticism was largely silenced by the
Minister's frankness. Sir E. BANBURY,
of course, was dead against the whole
policy, and demanded the immediate
withdrawal of the civilian grants; but
his uncompromising attitude found little
favour. Mr. CLYNEs thought it would
have been better for the State to furnish
work instead of doles, but did not
explain how in that case private enter-
prise was to get going. France's ex-
perience with the ateliers nationaua is
not encouraging, though 1919, when
“demobbed” subalterns turn up their
noses at £250 a year, is not 1848.
Wednesday, April 30th.-Mr. AUSTEN
CHAMPERLAIN, returning to the Ex-
chequer after an interval of thirteen
years, made a much better Budget
speech than one would have expected.
It was longer, perhaps, than was abso-
lutely necessary. Like the late Mr.
GLADSTONE, he has a tendency to
digress into financial backwaters in-
stead of sticking to the main Pactolian
stream. His excursus upon the im-

practicability of a levy on capital was
really redundant, though it pleased the
millionaires and reconciled them to the
screwing-up of the death-duties. Still,
on the whole, he had a more flattering
tale to unfold than most of us had ven-
tured to anticipate, and he told it well,
in spite of an occasional confusion in
his figures. After all, it must be hard
for a Chancellor who left the national
expenditure at a hundred and fifty
millions and comes back to find it multi-
plied tenfold not to mistake millions
for thousands now and again.
On the whole the Committee was
well pleased with his performance,
partly because the gap between revenue
and expenditure turned out to be a
mere trifle of two hundred millions in-
stead of twice or thrice that amount;
partly because there was, for once, no
increase in the income-tax; but chiefly,
I think, for the sentimental reason
that in recommending a tiny preference
for the produce of the Dominions and
Dependencies Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was
happily combining imperial interests
with filial affection.
Almost casually the CHANCELLOR an-
nounced that the Land Values Duties,
the outstanding feature of Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE's famous Budget of 1909, were,
with the approval of their author, to
be referred to a Select Committee, to
see if anything could be made of them.
If only Mr. Asquith had thought of
that device when his brilliant young
lieutenant first propounded them! There
would have been no quarrel between
the two Houses: the Parliament Act
would never have been passed, and a
Home Rule Act, for which nobody in
Ireland has a good word, would not
now be reposing on the Statute-Book.
In the absence of
any Ex-CHANCELLOR
OF THE Exchequeſt
the task of criticism
was left to Mr. ADAM-
son, who was mildly
aggressive and showed
a hankering after a
levy on capital, not
altogether easy to re-
concile with his state-
ment that no respon-
sible Member of the
Labour Party desired
to repudiate the
National Debt. Mr.
JEsson, a National
Democrat, was more
original and stimula-
ting. As a representa-
tive of the Musicians'
Union he is all for
harmony, and foresees
the time when Capital
and Labour shall unite
their forces in one great national or.
chestra, under the directing baton of
the State.
At the instance of Lord STRACHIE the
House of Lords conducted a spirited
little debate on the price of milk. It
appears that there is a conflict of juris-
diction between the Food-CoNTROLLER
and the MINISTER of AGRICULTURE,
and that the shortage in the supply of
this commodity must be ascribed to the
overlapping of the Departments.
Thursday, May 1st.—Sinn Fein has
decreed that nobody in Ireland should
do any work on May Day. Messrs.
DEVLIN and MACVEAGH, however, being
out of the jurisdiction, demonstrated
their independence by being busier than
ever. The appointment of a new Press
Censor in Ireland furnished them with
many opportunities at Question-time
for the display of their wit, which some
of the new Members seemed to find
passably amusing.
Mr. DEVLIN's best joke was, how-

ever, reserved for the Budget debate,
when, in denouncing the further burdens
laid on stout and whisky, he declared
that Ireland was, “apart from political
trouble,” the most peaceful country in
the world.
The fiscal question always seems to
invite exaggeration of statement. The
CHANCELLoR's not very tremendous
Preference proposals were denounced
by Sir DoNALD MACLEAN as inevitably
leading to the taxation of food and to
quarrels with foreign countries. Colonel
AMERY, on the other hand, waxed dithy-
rambic in their praise, and declared that
by taking twopence off Colonial tea the
Government were not only consecrating
the policy of Imperial Prefer-
ence, but were “putting the
coping-stone on it.”
A CELTIC COUNTER-
BLAST.
THE continued domination
of the Russians in the domain
of the ballet has already ex-
cited a certain amount of not
unfriendly criticism. But our
Muscovite visitors are not to
be allowed to have it all their
own way, and we understand
that negotiations are already
on foot with a view to ena-
bling the Irish Ballet to give
a season at a leading London S
theatre in the near future.
The Irish Ballet, which is
organised on a strictly self-
determining basis, is one of
the outcomes of the Irish
Theatre, but derives in its
essentials directly from the
school established by Cor-
mac, son of Art. That is to
say it is in its aims, ideals
and methods permeated by the Dale-
carlian, Fomorian, Brythonic and Fir-
bolgian impulse. Mr. Fergal Dindsen-
chus O'Corkery, the Director, is a direct
descendant of Cuchulinn and only uses
the Ulidian dialect. Mr. Tordelbach
O'Lochlainn, who has composed most
of the ballets in the répertoire, is a
chieftain of mingled Dalcassian and
Gallgoidel descent. The scenery has
been painted by Mr. Cathal Eochaid
MacCathamhoil, and the dresses de-
signed by Mr. Domnall Fothud O'Con-
chobar.
The artists who compose the troupe
have all been trained during the War
at the Ballybunnion School in North
Kerry, and combine in a wonderful way
the sobriety of the Delsartean method
with the feline agility of that of Kil-
kenny. Headed by the bewitching
Gorm flaith Rathbressil, and including
such brilliant artists as Maeve Errigal,
Coomhoola Grits, Ethne O'Conarchy,
Brigit Brandub, Corcu and Mocu,
Diarmid Hy Brasil, Murtagh Mac-
Murchada, Aillil Molt, Mag Mell and
Donnchad Bodb, they form a galaxy of
talent which, alike for the euphony of
its nomenclature and the elasticity of
its technique, has never been equalled
since the days of St. VITUs.
We have spoken of the work of Mr.
O'Lochlainn, who is responsible for the
three-act ballet, Brian Boruma, a fan-
tasy on the Brehon laws, entitled The
Gardens of Goll; Poulaphuca, and
the Roaring of O'Rafferty; but the
repertöry also includes notable and
impassioned compositions by Ossian
The Minister of Labour (ancious to find work for the er-munitionette
drawing unemployment pay). “HERE, Modox1, is A CHARMING MoDEL
which would suit YoU, IF I MAY so PUT IT, Dows To THE GROUND.”
MacGillycuddy, Aghla Malachy, Caro-
lan MacFirbis and Emer Sidh. The
orchestra employed differs in many
respects from that to which we are
accustomed, the wood - wind being
strengthened by a quartet of Firbolg
flutes and two Fodlaphones, while the
brass is reinforced by a bass bosthoon,
an instrument of extraordinary depth
and sonority, and the percussion by a
group of Dingle drums.
But enough has been said to show
that the Irish ballet is assured in
advance of a cordial reception from all
admirers of the neo-Celtic genius.

viding that ‘from and after equal suffrage has
been established in Florida it shall be lawful
for females to don and wear the wearing ap-
parel of man as now worn publicly by him.’”

COLLABORATION.
Biddick has placed me in a most
awkward position. I am a proud man;
I cannot bring myself to accept a gift
of money from anybody. And yet I
cannot help feeling I should be justified
in taking the guinea he has sent me.
Biddick is a journalist. I was dis-
cussing the inflation of prices and
asking his advice as to how to increase
one's income. “Why not write some-
thing for the Press, my dear fellow 2"
he said. “Five hundred words with a
catchy title; nothing funny—that's my
line—but something solid and practical
with money in it; the public 's always
ready for that. Take your
neighbour, old Diggles, and
his mushroom-beds, for in-
stance. Thriving local indus-
try—capital copy. Try your
hand at half a column, and
call it “A Fortune in Fun-
gus.’”
“I 'm afraid I know no-
thing about mushrooms, with
the exception of the one I
nearly died of,” I replied,
“and I’m not sufficiently
acquainted with Mr. Diggles
to venture to invite his con-
fidence respecting his busi-
ness.”
“My dear man, I don't ask
you to tell Diggles you're
going to write him up in the
newspapers; he'd kick you
off the premises; he doesn't
want his secrets given away
to competitors. Just dodge
the old man round the sheds,
get into conversation with his
staff, keep your eyes open
generally and you'll pick up
as much as you want for
half a column. And when you've got
your notes together bring 'em along to
me. I'll put 'em shipshape for you.”
I thanked him very gratefully.
The mushroom-sheds are situated in
a field some distance from my residence,
and I found it rather a fatiguing walk,
After tedious watching in a cramped
position through a gap in the hedge I
saw Mr. Diggles emerge from a shed
and move away from my direction. I
lost no time in creeping forward under
cover of my umbrella towards an em-
ployee, who was engaged in tossing
manure. I drew out my note-book and
interrogated him briefly and briskly.
“Do you rear from seeds or from
cuttings?” I asked him. He scratched
his head and appeared in doubt. “Are
your plants self-supporting,” I went
on, “ or do you train them on twigs?
What would be the diameter of your
finest specimen?” He continued in

doubt. I adopted a conversational
manner. “I suppose you'll be potting
off soon 2 You must get very fond of
your mushrooms. I think one always
gets fond of anything which demands
one's whole care and attention. I
wonder if I might have a peep at your
protégés 2"
I edged towards the door of one of
the sheds, but he made no attempt to
accompany me. Instead he put his
hands to his mouth and shouted, “Hi,
maister' "
Mr. Diggles promptly responded to
the summons. There was no eluding
him. I put my note-book out of sight
and inquired if he could oblige me with a
pound of fresh-culled mushrooms. He
could, and he did. I paid him four-and-
sixpence for them, the control price
presumably, but he gave me no invita-
tion to view the growing crops. I re-
traced mysteps without having collected
even an opening paragraph for “A
Fortune in Fungus.”
The next day found me again near.
the sheds. Mr. Diggles was nowhere
in sight. I approached unobtrusively
through the hedge and accosted a small
boy.
* Hulloa, my little man,” I said,
“what is your department in this hive
of industry? You weed the mushrooms,
perhaps, or prune them 2 " He seemed
shy and offered no answer. “Perhaps
you hoe between the plants or syringe
them with insecticide 2"
Still I could not win his confidence,
so I tried pressing sixpence into his
palm. “Between ourselves, what are
the weekly takings 2 " I said. He
pocketed the coin and put his finger
on his lips.
“Belge,” he said. Then he bolted
into a shed and returned accompanied
by Mr. Diggles. There was nothing
for it but to purchase another pound
of mushrooms. I was no nearer “A
Fortune in Fungus" than before.
Two days later, having received ap-
parently reliable information that Mr.
Diggles was confined to his bed with
influenza, I ventured again to visit the
sheds. I was advancing boldly across
the field when to my consternation he
suddenly appeared from behind a hay-
rick. I was so startled that I turned
to fly, and in my precipitancy tripped
on a tussock and fell. Mr. Diggles
came to my assistance, and, when he
had helped me to my feet and brushed
me down with a birch broom he was
carrying, I could do nothing less than
buy another pound of his mushrooms.
I felt it was time to consult Biddick.
He was sitting at his desk staring at a
blank sheet of paper. His fingers were
harrowing his hair and he looked dis-
traught. .
“Excuse the interruption,” I said,
“but this ‘Fortune in Fungus' is ruin-
ing me; ” and I related my experience.
At the finish Biddick gripped my
hand and spoke with some emotion.
“Dear old chap,” he said, “it’s my
line, after all. It's funny. If only I
can do it justice; ” and he shook his
fountain-pen.
This morning I received a guinea
and a newspaper cutting entitled “A
Cadger for Copy,” which may appeal
to some people's sense of humour. It
makes none to mine. In the flap of
the envelope Biddick writes: “Halves,
with best thanks.”
Upon consideration I shall forward
him a simple formal receipt.
From a bookseller's catalogue:–

This book is intended for the woman who
has time to spare for reading, Tatting being

An edition in Braille would appear to
be contemplated.

THE GERM.
THE great Bacteriologist entered the lecture-room and
ascended the platform. A murmur of astonishment ran
round the audience as they beheld, not the haggard face of
a man who daily risked the possibility of being awarded
the O.B.E., but the calm and smiling countenance of one
who had succeeded where other scientists, even of Anglo-
American reputation, had failed.
In an awed silence this remarkable man placed on the
table a dish, somewhat like a soup-plate in appearance,
and carefully removed its glass cover.
“In this dish, gentlemen,” said the Professor, “we have
the Agar-Agar, which is without doubt the best bacteri-
ological culture medium yet discovered and is especially
useful in growing a pathogenic organism such as we are
about to test this afternoon.”
Then taking a glass rod, to the end of which was attached
a small piece of platinum wire, the lecturer proceeded to
scrape a little of the growth from off the Agar-Agar. Hav-
LAXITY IN OUOTATIONS.
AMoNG the many privileges which I propose to claim as
a set-off for what are called advancing years is a greater
laxity in quotation. When I have made a quotation I mean
that that shall be the quotation, and I don't intend to be
driven either to the original source or to cyclopaedias of
literature for verification. DANTE, for instance, is a most
prolific fount of quotations, especially for those who do not
know the original Italian. If I have quoted the words
“Galeotto fu il libro e chi lo scrisse" once, I have quoted
them a hundred times, always with an excellent effect and
often giving the impression that I am an Italian scholar,
which I am not. But surely it is not usual to abstain from
a quotation because to use it would give a false impression?
I am perfectly certain, for instance, that there are plenty
of Italians who quote Hamlet, but know no more of English
than the words they quote, so I dare say that brings us
right in the end.
Then there is the quotation about “a very parfitt gentil

my version was so correct
that I would go to the

A great cheer burst from the audience. From all sides a
rush was made for the platform, and the Professor was
carried shoulder-high round the room.

He had already done the thing; and this was his effort,

This sounds as if it could not be defeated or matched, but
matched it certainly was in Enoch Arden. After describing
Enoch Arden's death and the manner in which he “roll'd
his eyes" upon Miriam, the bard informs us:—
“So past the strong heroic soul away.
And when they buried him the little port
Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.”
But I feel that I have strayed beyond my purpose, which
was to claim a certain mitigated accuracy in quotation for
those who suffer from advancing years.

COMMUNICATIONS.
I was sitting in the Club, comfortably
concealed by sheets of a well-known
journal, when two voices, somewhere
over the parados of the deep arm-chair,
broke in upon my semi-consciousness.
“. . . Then poor old Tubby, who
hasn't recovered from his 1918 dose of
shell-shock, got a go of claustrophobia
and felt he simply had to get out of
the train.” -
The speaker paused and I heard the
clink of glass.
“Well?” said the other voice.
“So, before we could flatten him
out, he skipped up and pulled the com-
municator thing and stopped the train;
consequently we ran into Town five
minutes behind time. There was the
deuce of a buzz about it.”
“What's five minutes in this blissful
land of lotus-eaters ? Why, I've known
the Calais-Wipers express lose itself for
half-a-day without a murmur from any-
one, unless the Brigadier had run out
of bottled Bass.”
“But, my dear fellow,” the first voice
expostulated, “this was the great West
of England non-stop Swallowtail; runs
into Town three minutes ahead of time
every trip. Habitués of the line often
turn an honest penny by laying odds
on its punctuality with people who are
strangers to the reputation of this
flier.”
“A pretty safe thing to bet on, eh?”
said the other voice. Again there was
the faint clink of glass and then the
voices drifted into other topics, to which,
having re-enveloped myself in my paper,
I became oblivious.
A few days later I was called away
from London, with Mr. Westaby Jones,
to consult in a matter of business. Mr.
Westaby Jones is a member of the Stock
Exchange and, amongst other trivial
failings, he possesses one which is not
altogether unknown in his profession.
He cannot resist a small wager. On
several occasions he has gambled with
me and shown himself to be a gentle-
man of considerable acumen.
Our business was finished and we
were on the way back to Town by the
great West of England non - stop
Swallowtail. We had lunched well
and discussed everything there was to
discuss. It was a moment for rest. I
unfolded my paper and proceeded to
envelop myself in the usual way.
I seemed to hear the chink of glasses
. . . a voice murmured, “A pretty safe
thing to bet on.”
Then in a dreamy sort of manner I
realised that Fatehad delivered Westaby
Jones into my hands. When we were
within twenty miles of London I opened
the campaign. I grossly abused the
line on which we were travelling and
suggested that anybody could make a
fortune by assuming that its best train
would roll in well after the scheduled
time.
Westaby Jones, having privily ascer-
tained that the engine-driver had a
minute or so in hand, immediately
pinned me down to what he thought
(but wisely did not say) were the wild
inaccuracies of an imbecile. He did it to
the extent of twenty-five pounds, and I
sat back with the comfortable feeling of
a man who will shortly have a small
legacy to expend. At the moment which
I had calculated to be most auspicious
I suddenly threw off the semblance of
boredom, rose up, lurched across the
carriage and pulled the communication
cord. (For the benefit of those who
cord comes away pleasantly in the hand
and, at the same time, gives one a
piquant feeling of unofficial responsi-
bility.) Westaby Jones was, for a stock-
broker, obviously astonished.
“What on earth are you doing 2"
he exclaimed.
“Sit down,” I said; “this is my im-
proved exerciser.”
“But you'll stop the train,” he
shouted.
“Never mind,” I replied; “what's
a fine of five pounds compared to phy-
sical fitness? Besides,” I added signi-
ficantly, “it may be a good investment
after all.”
For perhaps twenty seconds there
was the silent tension of expectation in
the air and then I realised with a shock
that the train did not show any signs
of slackening speed. It was, if any-
thing, going faster. I snatched fran-
tically at the cord and pulled about
half-a-furlong into the carriage. We
flashed past Ealing like a rocket, and
I desperately drew in coils and coils of
the communicator until I and West-
'aby Jones resembled the Laocoon. It
was no good. Smoothly and irresist-
ibly we glided into the terminus and
drew up at the platform three minutes
ahead of time.
I have paid Westaby Jones, who was
unmannerly enough to look pleased.
I have also corresponded with the rail-
way company, claiming damages on
ithe grounds of culpable negligence.
Unfortunately they require more evi-
dence than I am prepared to supply of
the reasonable urgency of my action.

Harold (after a violent display of affection). “'TISN'T 'cos I LovE You—IT's 'cos You sm ELL so NicE.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE Great Man is, I suppose, among the most difficult
themes to treat convincingly in fiction. To name but one
handicap, the author has in such cases to postulate at
least some degree of acquaintance on the part of the reader
with his celebrated subject. “Everyone is now familiar,”
he will observe, “with the sensational triumph achieved by
the work of X ; ” whereat the reader, uneasily conscious
of never having heard of him, inclines to condemn the whole
business beforehand as an impossible fable. I fancy Mr.
SoMERSET MAUGHAM felt something of this difficulty with
regard to the protagonist of his quaintly-called The Moon
and Sixpence (HEINEMANN), since, for all his sly pretence
of quoting imaginary authorities, we have really only his
unsupported word for the superlative genius of Charles
Strickland, the stockbroker who abandoned respectable
London to become a Post-impressionist master, a vagabond
and ultimately a Pacific Islander. The more credit then to
Mr. MAUGHAM that he does quite definitely make us accept
the fellow at his valuation. He owes this, perhaps, to the un-
sparing realism of the portrait. Heartless, utterly egotistical,
without conscience or scruple or a single redeeming feature
beyond the one consuming purpose of his art, Strickland is
alive as few figures in recent fiction have been; a genuinely
great though repellent personality—a man whom it would
have been at once an event to have met and a pleasure to
have kicked. Mr. MAUGHAM has certainly done nothing
better than this book about him; the drily sardonic humour
of his method makes the picture not only credible but com-
pelling. I liked especially the characteristic touch that
shows Strickland escaping, not so much from the dull
routine of stockbroking (genius has done that often enough
in stories before now) as from the pseudo-artistic atmo-
sphere of a flat in Westminster and a wife who collected
blue china and mild celebrities. Mrs. Strickland indeed is
among the best of the slighter characters in a tale with a
singularly small cast; though it is, of course, by the central
figure that it stands or falls. My own verdict is an un-
hesitating stet. -
If there be any who still cherish a pleasant memory of
the Bonnie Prince CHARLIE of the Jacobite legend, Miss
MARJoRIE Bowen's Mr. Misfortunate (CoLLINs) will dispose
of it. She gives us a study of the YoUNG PRETENDER in
the decade following Culloden. Figures such as LochIEL,
KEITH, GoriNG, the dour KELLY, HENRY STUART, Louis XV.,
with sundry courtiers and mistresses, move across the film.
I should say the author's sympathy is with her main sub-
ject, but her conscience is too much for her. I find myself
increasingly exercised over this conscience of Miss BowFN's.
She seems to me to be deliberately committing herself to
what I can only describe as a staccato method. This was
notably the case with The Burning Glass, her last novel.
Her narratives no longer seem to flow. She will give you
catalogues of furniture and raiment, with short scenes inter-
spersed, for all the world as if she were transcribing from
carefully taken notes. Quite probably she is, and I am
being authentically instructed and should be duly grateful,
but I find myself longing for the exuberance of her earlier
method. I feel quite sure this competent author can find
a way of respecting historical truth without killing the
full-blooded flavour of romance.
There is a smack of the Early Besantine about the earnest

scion of a noble house who decides to share the lives and
lot of common and unwashed men with an eye to the immi-
nent appearance of the True Spirit of Democracy in our
midst. Such a one is the hero of Miss MAUD DIVER's
latest novel, Strange Roads (CoNSTABLE); but it is only fair
to say that Derek Bluit (né Blount), second son of the
Earl of Avonleigh, is no prig, but, on the contrary, a very
pleasant fellow. For a protagonist he obtrudes himself
only moderately in a rather discursive story which involves
a number of other people who do nothing in particular over
a good many chapters. We are halfway through before
Derek takes the plunge, and then we find him, not in the
slums of some industrial quarter, but in Western Canada,
where class distinctions are founded less on soap than on
simoleons. At the end of the volume the War has “bruk
out,” and our hero, apart from having led a healthy outdoor
life and chivalrously married and been left a widower by a
pathetic child with consumption and no morals, is just about
where he started. I say “at the end of the volume,” for there
I find a publisher's note to the effect that in consequence of
the paper shortage the further adventures of our hero have
the Crescent (HUTchINson). All the essential people in his
Greenmantle, which deals, towards the end at any rate,
with just about the same scenes and circumstances as her
story, are so confoundedly efficient, have so undeniably
learnt the trick of making the most of their dashing
opportunities. In Mrs. INCHBoLD's book the trouble is
that with much greater advantages in the way of local
knowledge and with all manner of excitement, founded on
fact, going a-begging, nothing really thrilling or convincing
ever quite materialises. The heroine, Armenian and beau-
tiful, is as ineffective as the hero, who is French and heroic,
both of them displaying the same unfortunate tendency
to be carried off captive by the other side and to indulge in
small talk when they should be most splendid. And the
majority of the other figures follow suit. On the face of it
the volume is stuffed with all the material of melodrama:
but somehow the authoress seems to strive after effects that
don't come naturally to her. What does come naturally to
her is seen in a background sketch of the unhappy countries
of Asia Minor in the hands of the Turk and the Hun, which
is so much the abler part of the book that one would

subsequent volume. It
is to be entitled The

here I picture a gleam of revived interest, possibly financial

parties and a thousand other details, all highly entertaining
to herself and involving a sufficiency of native words to
impress the stay-at-home. And perhaps, just as you were
considering your chance of an escape before tea, she would
continue “ and now I must tell you all about the dreadful
time I had in the rising !” which she would then vivaciously
proceed to do; and not only that, but all about the dreadful
time (the same dreadful time) that all her friends had in
the same rising, chapters of it, so that in the end it might
be six o'clock or later before you got away. I hope this is
not an unfair résumé of the impression produced upon me
by Miss Isobel, MoUNTAIN's prattling pages. To sum up,
if you have an insatiable curiosity for the small talk of
other people's travel, A Maiden in Malaya may not prove
too much for it. If otherwise, otherwise.

time seems to prove him far cleverer than appears from any
actual evidence furnished. If, however, this portrait is not
in the artist's best manner, I can praise without reserve
the picture of Lady Féo, a little Society butterfly, very
frivolous on the surface, but concealing a lot of nice intui-
tion and sympathy, and I welcome her as a set-off to the
silly caricatures we commonly get of the class to which she
belonged. Let me add that in the telling of this tale
Madame ALBANESI retains her quiet and individual charm.
A Curious Romanian Custom.
“The two white doves which were perched in the wedding carriage
excited much interest. They were given, following the pretty Rou-
manian cuckoo, to the bride and bridegroom by the people of
Roumania to symbolise the happiness and peace which are hoped to
the newly-married couple.”—North Mail.

story suffers from overmuch compression. We shall wait

SAFETY FIRST.
THE fact being now established to
the satisfaction of the authorities that
the public is composed almost exclus-
ively of drivelling idiots, a campaign
has been instituted for adding to the
decorations of London by placarding
the walls with hints on how to avoid
various violent deaths.
We are surrounded now by blood-
curdling photographs of people being
run over by omnibuses or dribbled
along the street by horses attached
to brewers' drays, these illustrations
being accompanied by explanatory
notes as to the inevitable result of
crossing roads with your eyes shut or
your fingers in your ears and endeav-
ouring to alight from moving omnibuses
by means of the back somersault or the
swallow dive. We are also implored
to make quite sure, before alighting
from a train, that it is really at a station.
As this admirable propaganda is only
in its infancy, I submit the following
additions to its collection of horrors,
which may perhaps inspire others even
cleverer than myself to evolve new
methods of protecting the public from
themselves.
TUBEs.
A picture of a widow wringing hor
hands with grief, and under it this
pungent hint: “This is the widow of
a man who tried to light his cigarette
on the ‘live rail.'"
A picture of a man who has been cut
in half, with, say, a crisplittle couplet:-
“Here are two portions of Benjamin Yates
Who scorned the request to ‘stand clear of
the gates.'”
A photograph of the interior of a
hospital ward full of patients, with the
following: “Interior of a ward in the
Bakerdilly Hospital, exclusively for
patients who stepped off the moving
staircase with the wrong foot.”
TRAINs.
A picture of a stately building stand-
ing in its own grounds with the de-
scription: “The N.S.E. & W. Railway
Orphanage for children whose parents
crossed the line by the track instead of
the footbridge.”
A picture of a decapitated body with
the poignant comment:—
“Be warned by the ending
Of Ferdinand Goschen
Who leaned out of window
While the train was in motion.”
And perhaps a few general hints such
a.S —
(1) In stepping off an omnibus al-
ways alight feet first.
(2) In crossing crowded thorough-
fares, proceed through the traffic, not
under it.
(3) Before stepping from the pave-
ment make quite sure that there is a
road there, etc., etc.
Imagination, colour—that's all that's
wanted, and if this propaganda is
carried far enough the safety of the
public will be assured, for either they
really will try not to be killed while
travelling or walking in the streets, or
they will stay indoors altogether.
A Disciplinarian.
“SCHOOLMISTRESS's RESIGNATION.
Miss will have the satisfaction of
knowing that she has left her mark on those
who have passed through her hands.” -
Provincial Paper.
“Closing scores in the professional golf
match were Newman 14,835; Inman 13,343.”
Provincial Paper.
This high scoring was due, we under-
stand, to the large number of losing
hazards which had to be negotiated.

SPRING CLEANING.
THE hailstorm stopped; a watery sun came out,
And late that night I clearly saw the moon;
The lilac did not actually sprout,
But looked as if it ought to do in June.
I did not say, “My love, it is the Spring; "
I rubbed my chilblains in a cheerful way
And asked if there was some warm woollen thing
My wife had bought me for the first of May;
And, just to keep the ancient customs green,
We said we'd give the poor old house a clean.
Good Mr. Ware came down with all his men,
And filled the house with lovely oily pails,
And went away to lunch at half-past ten,
And came again at tea-time with some nails,
And laid a ladder on the daffodil,
And opened all the windows they could see,
And glowered fiercely from the window-sill
On me and Mrs. Tompkinson at tea,
And set large quantities of booby-traps
And then went home—a little tired, perhaps.
They left their paint-pots strewn about the stair,
And switched the lights off—but I knew the game;
They took the geyser—none could tell me where;
It was impossible to wash my frame.
The painted windows would not shut again,
But gaped for ever at the Eastern skies;
The house was full of icicles and rain;
The bedrooms smelled of turpentine and size;
And if there be a more unpleasant smell
I have no doubt that that was there as well.
My wife went out and left me all alone,
While more men came and clamoured at the door
To strip the house of everything I own,
The curtains and the carpets from the floor,
The kitchen range, the cushions and the stove,
And ask me things that husbands never know,
“Is this 'ere paint the proper shade of mauve?"
Or “Where is it this lino has to go?”
I slunk into the cellar with the cat,
This being where the men had put my hat.
I cowered in the smoking-room, unmanned;
The days dragged by and still the men were here.
And then I said, “I too will take a hand,”
And borrowed lots of decorating gear.
I painted the conservatory blue;
I painted all the rabbit-hutches red;
I painted chairs in every kind of hue,
A summer-house, a table and a shed;
And all of it was very much more fair
Than any of the work of Mr. Ware.
But all his men were stung with sudden pique
And worked as never a worker worked before;
They decorated madly for a week
And then the last one tottered from the door,
And I was left, still working day and night,
For I have found a way of keeping warm,
And putting paint on everything in sight
Is surely Art's most satisfying form;
I know no joy so simple and so true
As painting the conservatory blue. A. P. H.

BUT, WHEN THE
THE LAST OF HIS RACE.
It is interesting, though ill-mannered,
to watch other people at a railway
bookstall and guess their choice of
literature from their outward appear-
ance.
Had you pursued this diversion, how-
ever, in the case of Mr. Harringay
Jones as he stood before the bookstall
at Paddington, you would, I fear, have
been far out in your conjecture. For
Mr. Jones, who had the indeterminate
baldheadedness of the bank cashier
and might have been anything from
thirty-five to sixty, did not purchase a
volume of essays or a political auto-
biography, but selected a flaming one-
and-sixpenny narrative of spy hunts
and secret service intrigue.
Still, how could you have guessed
that Mr. Jones's placid countenance
and rotund frame concealed an imagina-
tion that was almost boyish in its
unsatisfied craving for adventure ?
Humdrum year had succeeded hum-
drum year, yet he had never despaired.
Some day would come that great
moment when the limelight of the
world's wonder would centre on him,
and he would hold the stage alone.
But till its arrival he consoled him-
self with literature and found vicarious
enjoyment in the deeds of others. As
long as his imagination could grow
lean in its search for treasure amid
Alaskan snows, he recked not if reality
added an inch or two to his circumfer-
ence. While, he could solve, in fancy,
problems that had baffled the acutest
investigators, what matter if his tie-pin
got mislaid 2
And then came war to deposit ro-
mance and adventure upon our door-
steps. Mr. Jones was agog with ex-
citement.
Espionage, treachery in high places,
the hidden hand—Mr. Jones read
about them all and shuddered with
unholy joy. Perhaps he, an obscure
cashier—who could tell? Stranger
things had happened.
Meanwhile he devoured all the spy
literature he could find, for, as he once
remarked to himself, in dealing with
such gentry you have to mind your
P's and QUEUx. It was his only joke.
His literary choice dictated by such
considerations, Mr. Jones picked his
way delicately across the platforms
till he reached his compartment, into
the corner of which he stretched him-
self luxuriously and prepared to enjoy
his book.
Just before the train started a lady
entered carrying a baby and—greatly
to Mr. Jones's annoyance—took the
corner seat opposite him. Being a
confirmed bachelor, he had a horror
of all babies, but this child in particular
struck him with disfavour; seldom, he
thought, had he seen such a peevish
discontented expression on any human
| face.
Close on the lady's heels followed a
withered old man of the traditional
professorial type, who seated himself
at the other end of the compartment.
Mr. Jones buried himself in his book.
For once, however, the narrative failed
to entertain him. Beautiful spies
lavished their witchery in vain; the
sagacity of the hero left him cold.
Suddenly an atmosphere of unrest
and agitation conveyed itself to him.
The train was slowing down in the
darkness; the lady opposite was lean-
ing forward, her face pale, her whole
attitude tense with excitement. The
train stopped; outside someone was
walking along the metals; there came
the sound of a guttural remark.
The lady put her hand to her heart
and, turning to the elderly gentleman,
gasped, “Doctor, that was his voice.
They have tracked us.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The old man rose quietly and, opening
the far door, stood waiting.
“But the child 2 ” she cried with a
sob.
“He must be left behind, Madame.
There is less danger thus.”
“But what am I to do?” She turned
to Mr. Jones, looked at him steadily
and fixedly, and then, as if satisfied
with what she read in him, exclaimed,
“You have a good heart. You must
keep him. Do not let them have him;
too much depends upon it.”
And before the astonished cashier
had time to protest his fellow-travellers
had gone and he was alone with the
child.
But not for long. Just as the train
commenced to move again three men
entered the compartment; two ap-
peared to be servants, but the third
was a young man of distinguished ap-
pearance, the most conspicuous items
of whose attire were a dark Homburg
hat and a long cape of Continental cut.
Mr. Jones's heart missed a beat.
Throwing a searching glance around
the compartment the stranger rapped
out, “There has been a lady in here?”
“No,” replied Mr. Jones, on general
principles.
For answer the stranger picked a
cambric handkerchief off the floor.
“That's mine,” said Mr. Jones
hastily.
“Perhaps,” was the sneering reply,
“you will tell me also that the child is
yours.”
“Certainly,” said Mr. Jones, rufiled
by his cross-examination; “it always
has been.”
Thestranger snorted contemptuously.
“You are good at explanations. Per-
haps you can explain this.”
Mr. Jones looked down at the baby's
coat. To his amazement he beheld a
crown and monogram embroidered on
it.
“That,” he replied, taking refuge in
fatuity, “is the laundry mark.”
“Come, come, enough of this fooling.
Give me the child.”
Mr. Jones took no notice.
“Give me the child, I say.”
Mr. Jones paled but did not move.
“Very good, then.” The stranger
turned to his attendants. “Rupert,
Rudolph,” he said.
Two revolver barrels flashed out.
Mr. Jones stood up hastily, the child
clutched º in his arms. “What
do you mean by threatening me like
this? What right have you to the

I shall inform the police.”
“Porkhound,” yelled the stranger,

of the Hohenzollerns.”
The great moment had come. Jones's
face lit up. Death—a hero's death—
might claim him, but he would make
democracy safe for the world.
“Last of the Hohenzollerns !” he
shouted; “then, by Jove, this is going
to be the last of him.” And with a yell
of triumph he hurled the infant out into
the night.
From the child in its trajectory came
a long ear-splitting shriek, followed by
a gentle wailing.
Mr. Jones sat up and blinked his
eyes. The professorial gentleman was
still in the far corner; the lady was
still opposite him; the child was wail-
ing softly.
The lady smiled. “I'm afraid baby
has broken your nap. A passing ex-
press frightened him.” -
“Not at all,” murmured Mr. Jones
incoherently, searching for his novel,
the one solace left amid the ruin of his
dreams.
“Pardon me,” said the lady, “but if
you are looking for your book you
threw it out of the window just before
you woke up.”
Mr. Jones sank back resignedly.
His glory had gone, his book j gone.
Once again he settled himself in his
corner to sleep—perchance to dream.

tentiaries reappeared, dived into Allied repre-
sentatives, emerged, jumped into their car and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHANT ROYAL OF CRICKET.
WHEN earth awakes as from some dreadful night
And doffs her melancholy mourning state,
When May buds burst in blossom and requite
Our weary eyes for Winter's tedious wait,
Then the pale bard takes down his dusty lyre
And strikes the thing with more than usual fire.
Myself, compacted of an earthier clay,
I oil my bats and greasy homage pay
To Cricket, who, with emblems of his court,
Stumps, pads, bails, gloves, begins his Summer sway.
Cricket in sooth is Sovran King of Sport.
As yet no shadows blur the magic light,
The glamour that surrounds the opening date.
Illusions yet undashed my soul excite
And of success in luring whispers prate.
I see myself in form ; my thoughts aspire
To reach the giddy summit of desire.
Lovers and such may sing a roundelay,
Whate'er that be, to greet returning May;
For me, not much—the season's all too short;
I hear the mower hum and scent the fray.
Cricket in sooth is Sovran King of Sport.
A picture stands before my dazzled sight,
Wherein the hero, ruthlessly elate,
Defies all bowlers' concentrated spite.
That hero is myself, I need not state.
'Tis sweet to see their captain's growing ire
And his relief when I at last retire;
'Tis sweet to run pavilionwards and say,
“Yes, somehow I was seeing them to-day"—
Thus modesty demands that I retort
To murmured compliments upon my play.
Cricket in sooth is Sovran King of Sport.
The truth's resemblance is, Iown, but slight
To these proud visions which my soul inflate.
This is the sort of thing: In abject fright
I totter down the steps and through the gate;
Somehow I reach the pitch and bleat, “Umpire,
Is that one leg?" What boots it to inquire?
The impatient bowler takes one grim survey,
Speeds to the crease and whirls—a lightning ray ?
No, a fast yorker. Bang! the stumps cavort.
Chastened, but not surprised, I go my way.
Cricket in sooth is Sovran King of Sport.
Lord of the Game, for whom these lines I write,
Fulfil my present hope, watch o'er my fate;
Defend me from the swerver's puzzling flight;
Let me not be run out, at any rate.
As one who's been for years a constant trier,
Reward me with an average slightly higher;
Let it be double figures. This I pray,
IIumblest of boons, before my hair grows grey
And Time's flight bids me in the last resort
Try golf, or otherwise your cause betray.
Cricket in sooth is Sovran King of Sport.
King, what though Age's summons I obey,
Resigned to dull rheumatics and decay,
Still on one text my hearers I'll exhort,
As long as hearers within range will stay:
“Cricket in sooth is Sovran King of Sport.”

SPRING MODES AT MURMANSK.
WE, the enthusiasts of the Relief Force who sailed from
England with the fine phrases of the Evening Press ring-
ing in our ears have arrived at Murmansk, only to be
disappointed and disillusioned. It is not that the expe-
dition looks less attractive than it did, or that our leaders
fail to inspire us with confidence. It is because the gilt
has disappeared from the sartorial gingerbread of our
adventure. . . . . . -
Why did we leap forward to volunteer before we were
wanted and continue to leap till, for very boredom, they sent
us embarcation orders and a free warrant? Was it simply
to escape an English Spring? Was it not rather that we
might win our furs—might wear the romantic outfit which
we were led to believe was de rigueur in the most exclusive
circle, namely, the Arctic 2 What was the first remark of
our female relatives when we showed them the War Office
telegram 2 Was it not, “Of course you must be photo-
graphed in your furs and things?"
No wonder, after the monotony of khaki, if we looked
forward to the glory and distinction of fur-lined caps and
coats, Shackleton boots, huge snow-goggles and enormous
gloves turning hands to savage paws.
And now what spectacle greets us at Murmansk, with
everybody's camera cleared for action ? What is the ex:
ample set by those to whom we naturally look for light and
leading 2 Behold the General and his Staff coming on
board in the snow-reflected sunshine flashing with the
gold and scarlet trimmings of Whitehall. And what of
the old residents, our comrades? They are playing foot-
ball in shorts and sweaters.
The genial R.T.O. cheered us up a little and kept the
more resolute of our Arctic heroes in countenance by sport-
ing a magnificent and irresistible fur head-dress; but an
R.T.O. can do what would be regarded as nerve in you and
me; and, moreover, here is the A.P.M. in the familiar flat
cap, encircled with the traditional colour of authority.
Even the nice little Laplander and his lady, driving in to
do shopping, drawn on a sleigh by a nicely-matched trio of
reindeer, was sitting on more furs than he or Mrs. L. were
wearing; while even the naked team seemed to feel the
heat oppressive.
I suppose we have come too late in the year for the ro-
mance of skins and ski, and must condescend to the familiar
gum-boot until the mosquito season opens and a man may
design some becoming effect in muslin.
Of course there is still plenty of snow to be photographed
against in the full splendour of a Hyperborean disguise:
but is it worth while to unpack one's valise for that?
And anyhow would not the atmosphere of the picture be
marred, the pose of the explorer be rendered unnatural by
his consciousness of insincerity and his fear of imminent
suffocation ? -
So the Photographic Press of England must bear their
loss as best they may.

of this date relinquish the title of world's open champion at tennis.
He feels it is inexpedient for him to defend his title.”—Field.

him split another infinitive.

THE COOK.
(With acknowledgments to TENNyson
and CAL PERLEY.)
URGED by the Government, with loyal
step
I to the Labour Bureau made my way
To find a cook; and there beheld a queen,
Tall, fair, arrayed in feathers and in fur
And all things beautiful. Whom when
I saw, -
“Madam,” said I, “they tell me, who
should know, -
That you have skill of Mrs. Beeton's
art.
If that be so—”
and I
Assumed a courage, though I had it not,
And º again: “Then tell me, if you
W111,
Of your experience and past career.
Whence come you?” And the cook
—why not 2—replied:
“I come from haunts of bomb and shell,
I've toyed with lathes and gauges,
I've sparkled out a sudden swell
With quite unheard-of wages.
She nodded “Yes,”
“By thirty shops I've paused to buy
Silk stockings, skirts and undies,
In fifty stores I've sat to try
Smart tango boots for Sundays.
“Down Bond Street gaily would I float,
Buy chairs, pianos, tables,
With here and there a sealskin coat,
And here and there some sables.
“I'd slip, I'd slide, I'd jazz, I'd glide,
I'd fox-trot, one- and two-step,
And show with pardonable pride
My skill at every new step.
“I'd dance until my soles were raw,
When, tired of dissipation,
I'd lie in bed whole weeks and draw
My out-of-work donation.
“And when that palled I'd rise to see
What fortunes cooks are earning,
And how the ladies long for me
With dumb pathetic yearning.
“I flit about, I skip, I roam
Through houses past the telling,
Through many a stately ducal home,
And many a Mayfair dwelling.
“I chatter in the servants' hall,
I make a sudden sally,
And with the parlourmaid I brawl
Or bicker with the valet.
“I murmur under moon and stars
With blue and khaki lovers,
I linger in resplendent bars
With golden taxi shuvvers.
“But out again I come and know
That Fate will fail me never,
For wars may come and wars may go,
But cooks go on for ever.”

“All the Lumpkins are clever and some of
them are brilliant . . . The head of the
family, Lord Durham, is an exceptionally
ready and witty man."—The Globe.
Readers of GoLDSMITH may suggest
that Anthony Lumpkin, Esq., was not
a brilliant Lumpkin; but it may well
be that he was only distantly connected
with that branch of the family from
which Lord DURHAM traces his descent.
In this connection a correspondent
suggests the following train of thought:

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 5th. — Sir AUCKLAND
GEDDEs is the maid-of-all-work of the
Ministry. Deputising for the PRESI-
DENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE he had
an opportunity of displaying an ency-
clopaedic knowledge which fully justi-
fied his position as President-elect of
a Canadian University. Mr. JoyNsoN-
Hicks probably thought he had floored
him with a poser on “gas-scrubbing,”
but Sir AUCKLAND knew all about it.
He is discreet as he is erudite. An
inquiry about meat - imports elicited
plenty of information about “ewe-
mutton ’’ and “wether-mutton,” but
not a word about the Manchurian and
other exotic beef recently foisted upon
London consumers.
Mr. REMER is one of the most attrac-
tive and enterprising of the new Mem-
bers. But I am afraid, despite his
cheery appearance, that he is a bit of a
pessimist. With Peace believed to be
so near, it was distinctly depressing
to find him calling attention to the
danger of a deficiency of pit-props “in
any future war,” and refusing to be put
off with the usual official answer, “in
view of the urgency of the question.”
There are few topics which excite more
general interest in the House than the
shortage of whisky. When, in reply to
a complaint by Colonel THoRNE that a
firm of Scotch distillers had refused to
furnish their customers with adequate
supplies, Mr. GEORGE Roberts re-
marked that he would like to be supplied
with “specific cases,” he was, no doubt
unconsciously, expressing an almost
universal desire.
Before the War, as we learned from
Mr. ILLINGworth, Government offices
used to send on the average about
forty thousand telegrams a month. At
the end of it the number had risen to
close on a million. Much of the in-
crease is due, no doubt, to zeal for
the rapid despatch of public business,
but some, one fears, to the natural
tendency of dug-outs (even in White-
hall) to protect themselves with wire-
entanglements.
If one were to believe all that the
Scottish Members said about their own
country in the debate upon the Hous-
ing º Bill Dr. Johnson's gibes
would be abundantly justified. Half
the population, according to Sir DoNALD
MACLEAN, are living in such over-
crowded conditions that the wonder is
that any of the children survive to
man's estate, and still more that they
retain sufficient energy to run most of
the British Empire. But in the cir-
cumstances a certain amount of ex-
aggeration may be forgiven. When it
is a case of touching the Imperial Ex-
chequer for local advantage the Scot
is no whit behind the Irishman in
“making the poor face.”
Tuesday, May 6th. — The Scottish
peers are no less impressed with the
miserable condition of their country,
Lord ForTEviot declared that in the
Western Hebrides the housing accom.
modation was no better than the caves
of primitive man. Yet these cave-
dwellers furnished some of the stoutest
recruits to the British army. Perhaps
it was their early experience that made
them so much at home in the trenches.
Their lordships gave a Second Read-
ing to the Solicitors' Bill, designed to
enable the Incorporated Law Society
to punish as well as try offending
attorneys, instead of leaving their sen-
tences to be determined by a Divisional
Court. The Lord CHANCELLOR and

Lord BUCKMASTER were of one mind in
thinking that the measure would be
enthusiastically welcomed by the lower
branch of their profession—presumably
on the principle of “Better the devil
you know than the devil you don't
know.”
The issue of an official pamphlet on
“The Classics in British Education ”
aroused the wrath of Colonel YATE, who
contemptuously asked what “suchlike
subjects” had to do with reconstruc-
tion. Before the Minister could answer,
Sir John REEs, fearing lest all Anglo-
Indians should be thought to hold the
same cultural standard, jumped to his
feet to declare that he had read the
pamphlet and found it admirable.
Of all the new Departments insti-
tuted during the War the Food Ministry
has best justified its existence. Mr.
GEORGE Roberts's account of its activi-
ties was very well received, and many
regrets were expressed that he should
have come to bury CAESAR as well as to
praise him. Mr. CLYNES, to whom and
the late Lord RHONDDA much of the
Ministry's success was due, was parti-
cularly insistent on the need of some
permanent Government control, to
counter the machinations of the food-
trusts.
The chief criticisms of the Ministry
related to its milk-policy, and these
were appropriately dealt with by Mr.
McCURDY. -

has been promised both by Mr. BALFour
and Mr. LoNG the reversion of Sir
RossLYN WEMYss' post as First Sea
Lord as soon as it is vacant. But no
immediate change is contemplated.
Meantime it is pleasant to learn from
Mr. LONG that the late C.-in-C. of the
Grand Fleet “has been consulted on
Naval policy since the Armistice.” So
he is not yet quite forgotten.
A new form of wireless telegraphy
has been invented by the Post Office
officials. When really urgent messages
are handed in for transmission to Paris
they despatch them by passenger train;
they find this method much quicker
than cabling.
An attempt by Sir DoNALD MACLEAN
to draw attention to the recent exploits
of the LoRD LIEUTENANT of IRELAND
in the field of Journalism was severely
suppressed by the SPEAKER, who per-
haps thinks that the less said about
them the better. It seems a pity that
the Press Censor should have been
demobilised just when his famous blue
pencil might have been really useful.
Recognising that in the present
temper of the House a frontal attack
upon Imperial Preference was a forlorn
hope the FreeTraders sought to destroy
it by an enfilading fire. But their in-
genious attempt, in the alleged interest
of the consumer, to extend to China tea

its absorptive tentacles over all the
Departments of State. It would take
over the inspectorship of factories from
the Home Office, the control of quack
medicines from the Privy Council and
the relief of the poor from the Local
Government Board. Fortunately for
Dr. ADDIsoN the Government refused
to throw these further burdens upon
him. After all, DISRAELI's famous
phrase, “Sanitas sanitatum omnia sani-
tas,” must not be translated too liter-
ally.
Members were all agog to hear
what the Government might have
to say about the Peace-terms an-
nounced this morning. Mr. Bot-
ToMLEY challenged the adequacy of
the financial provisions, but the
HoME SECRETARY evidently felt
unequal to a controversy with so
great an expert in money-matters,
and requested him to wait for his
“big brother,” Mr. BoNAR LAw.
A proposal by Mr. SYDNEY
ARNoLD to raise the limit of exemp-
tion from income-tax from £130 to
£250 was strongly backed by the
Labour Party. In resisting it the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
pointed out that the Labour Party
had opposed indirect taxation and
now they were opposing, direct
taxation. In what form did they
consider that working-men should
contribute to the expenses of their
country? No answer to this blunt
question was forthcoming.

Cambridge, then presented a memoran-
dum on the Guild Control of Composers
on the basis of a forty-hour week, with
equal opportunity for performance, the
economic use of orchestral resources
and the preferential treatment of Rus.
sian folk-tunes as thematic material.
All members of the Guild should re-
ceive the same salary free of income
tax; all performances should be free,
and applause or encores prohibited as
likely to lead to the rupture of artistic
solidarity. The profits from the sale of
programmes should go into the National
Exchequer, but should be earmarked
for a Pension Fund for the relief
of composers on their compulsory
retirement at the age of sixty.
- Examined by Sir Leonardo Spag-
| hetti Coyne, Mr. Hole said that he
was not aware that the mortality
among monkeys employed in the
piano-organ industry during the
late War was excessive. But he
agreed that the fearlessness shown
by the monkeys at the Zoo in
the course of air-raids deserved a
special decoration.
Mr. William Susie, who next
occupied the chair, was examined
by Mr. Moody MacTear on the
| question of the nationalisation of
| Royalty Ballads.
Mr. MacTear, quoting an esti-
mate by a Fellow of the Thermaéro-
statistical Society, that the ballad
composers of the country could
produce one hundred and ninety
thousand million ballads in five
hundred and eighty years, asked
the witness whether it would be
legitimate that a royalty charge
should be made on every ballad
produced during that period for the
benefit of certain individuals of
future generations. Mr. Susie re-
plied that the State had recognised
the right of royalties and therefore
he saw no good reason for discon-
tinuing the charge.
Mr. Gladney Jebb. Are youaware
that there have been more cases
of influenza amongst people who
have attended Royalty Ballad con |
certs in 1918 than amongst all the
troops who served on the Palestine
Front since 1916? Mr. Susie challenged
Mr. Jebb to produce his statistics, and
it was arranged, at the suggestion of
the President, that Mr. Jebb should
be given facilities to proceed to Jericho
and collect them. -
After the luncheon interval Mr. Cyril
Blunt read a report, which he had pre-
pared at the request of the Commission,
on the Nationalisation of the Folk-song
Industry. He said that it was a
scandalous paradox that this natu
and obvious reform had hitherto been
successfully resisted by unserupulous
individualistic action. Folk-tunes were
the product of and belonged to the

People, but they had been seized, ex-
ploited and perverted by composers, who
should be forced to refund the profits
they had derived from their robbery. The
conservation of our national musical
resources should be jealously guarded,
and the collection, notation and har-
monisation of these tunes carried on
under rigorous State supervision. At
the same time the State might issue
licences for the symphonic use of folk-
tunes, the profits from the sale of these
licences to be devoted to the main-
tenance of village festivals, at which
only genuine folk-music should be per-
formed by the oldest inhabitants.
Asked by Sir Mark Holloway what he
meant by genuine folk-music, Mr. Blunt
said, “Tunes of which it is impossible
to assign the authorship to a known
composer.”
Mr. Kilcrankie Fox, who was the
next witness, was subjected to a very
searching examination by Mr. Moody
MacTear, Mr. Gladney Jebb and Sir
Leonardo Spaghetti Coyne.
Mr. Moody MacTear. Are you aware
that brassinstrument players arehabitu.
ally sweated in orchestras and bands?
—It depends on what you mean. I cer-
tainly admit that their activities often
conduce to profuse perspiration.
Mr. Moody MacTear. Have you ever
played the trombone yourself 2–No,
nor the lyre either.
Mr. Gladney Jebb. Are you prepared
to deny that the strain on the nerves
of players in Jazz-bands, especially
drums, is greater than that endured by
soldiers in the front-line trenches during
an intense bombardment?—As a rule
I am prepared to deny at sight any
statement for which you are responsible,
but I concede you the big drum.
Sir Leonardo Spaghetti Coyne. Are
you aware that, owing to profiteering
in the cloth trade, organ-grinders have
been unable to provide their Simian
assistants with proper habiliments dur-
ing the recent inclement weather ?—
“Apes are apes though clothed in scar-
let”—or broadcloth. I have not noticed
any shabbiness of late in the garb of
those with whom I am acquainted.
The Commission broke up at a late
hour. At the next meeting evidence
will be taken on the subject of the
housing of musical seals and the alleged
profiteering of dealers in burnt cork at
the expense of players in Jazz-bands.

Lacks any distinguishing mark;
The Semite has merely been nosey
Right back to the days of the Ark;
The Teuton proclaims himself edel
And points to his family tree;
But the Celt is tattooed in his cradle
With “Erin the Free.”
Some races inherit a stigma,
And some find a spur in their
past,
But Ireland's ancestral enigma
Has now been unravelled at last;
For the Celt, the original Gaidel,
Apart from his proud pedigree,
Is always tattooed in his cradle
With “Erin the Free.”
The actual process of branding
I dare not attempt to describe;
Some themes are too high and out-
standing
For bards of the doggerel tribe;
But patriot minstrels will ladle
Out lauds on the parents who see
That the Celt is tattooed in his cradle
With “Erin the Free.”

AT THE PLAY.
“JUDITH.”
THAT Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT was actu-
ated by the very highest motives when
he set out to edit the Apocryphal Scrip-
tures for stage purposes, nobody would
dream of doubting. It is the more un-
fortunate that by making the rest of
the play very dull he should have thrown
into relief certain features in the story
of Judith which the original author had
preferred to treat with a commendable
reticence.
It will be recalled that in the ancient
version Holofernes made a feast for
Judith “and drank much more wine
than he had drunk at any time in one
day since he was born; ” that he then
lay down on his bed in a state of stupor,
and that Judith, taking advantage of
his torpid condition, “approached" and
cut off his head at her leisure with his
own “fauchion.” The decency of this
arrangement is easily apparent; it ob-
viated the necessity for wanton allure-
ments on the part of Judith and amorous
advances on the side of the Commander-
in-Chief. Incidentally it is more reason-
able to assume that so virile a warrior
would yield to nothing short of intoxi-
cation than that he would be persuaded,
while still remaining sober, to take a
brief rest (on the ground of temporary
indisposition) and so go like a lamb to
the slaughter, as he does in the play.
Todo Miss LILLAH McCARTHY justice,
she went through a scene embarrassing
alike to actors and audience with as
much dignity and aloofness as the situ-
ation admitted. In a previous scene
there had been one rather gratuitous
posture which we might perhaps have
been spared; but, for the rest, from the
moment when she first entered, a noble
figure in her robes of widowhood, veiling
all but the oval of her face, pale and
passionless, she played with a fine
restraint, giving us confidence in her
reserve of strength and never once allow-
ing her high purpose to be forgotten.
It was not her fault if, in the night
scene, amid a generous exposure of
physical facts, we missed the less palp-
able atmosphere of impending doom.
Certainly the Holofernes of Mr. CLAUDE
KING never for a moment suggested it.
I admit that I had not hitherto seen an
Assyrian officer making love on the edge
of his grave and so had no exact pre-
cedent to go by, but this officer, with
his face far too well groomed for the con-
clusion of a heavy banquet, and those
rather anaemic and perfunctory ges-
tures of endearment, which had no-
thing to do with the sombre forces of
elemental passion, gave no hint of the
sinister workings of Fate.
This lack of atmosphere pervaded

general uncanniness of things.
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT's own novel-
ties—the very rapid fraternization of
Judith's little Cockney maid with the
enemy; her own inexplicable love-at-

the laborious pretentiousness of Ozias,

—these offered no great improvement
on the original narrative. On the other
hand his neglect to show us the head of
Holofermes, which constitutes so dra-
matic a property in the Book of Judith,
was a noticeable omission. But per-
haps he was well-advised to leave it out,
for I thought I detected the significant
presence of Mr. BILLING in the stalls.
I ought perhaps to add that there
was a Messenger whose refinement of
speech greatly struck me. He said
that he came from Jerusalem, but he
sounded as if he came from Balliol.

tionately known to the members of

among our fellow-war-winners, and pre-
parations on a grand scale were made for
his reception. The statue of Liberty was
transformed to resemble Mnemosyne
(pronounced more or less to rhyme with

and a bodyguard of poets, novelists,
writers, journalists and brainy boys
generally was drawn up on the quay.

In response to the toast of “Litera:

with the name of its most vigilant

Mr. SHORTER's visit to America is
otherwise a purely private one. More
Irish than the Irish though he is known
to be, he has for the moment sheathed
his shillelagh. None the less, the con-
dition of Ireland being so critical, he
hopes to address a few meetings on the
aspirations of his adopted country.
Although the tour is of this private
character, Mr. ShoBTER is not unpre-
pared to record his opinions as they
occur to him or to continue to nourish
his mind on the latest productions of
the human intellect. His travelling
entourage comprises a brace of highly-
trained typists, a librarian, the Keeper
of the Paper-knife and a faithful steno-
grapher known as “Boswell,” who is
pledged to miss none of the Master's
dicta. During the voyage Mr. SHORTER
had the services of a special Marconi
operator, so that he might receive half-
hourly bulletins as to the state of the
publishing world, contents of theliterary
papers, deaths of editors and fellow-
critics, new knighthoods and so forth.
The Atlantic, on the whole, did not dis-
please him.
Details of the tour which have already
reached home indicate that its success
is profound.
At Boston Mr. SHORTER, although
his visit was brief, found time to deliver
his famous causerie, “Men of Letters
Whom I have Influenced,” with special
reference to GEORGE MEREDITH.
At Waterbury (which there is some
possibility of renaming Shorterbury)
the great critic was made the recipient
of an address of welcome and a watch.
At Pittsburg the freedom of the
Carnegie Libraries all over the world
was conferred upon him by the famous
iron-master.
At Haworth (Minn.) Mr. ShortBR
presented the postmaster with an auto-
graphed copy of his magnum opus on the
BRONTÉs.
At Salt Lake City he enchanted
the Mormon Elders by anecdotes of
THACKERAY's relations with their name-
sake, the London publisher.
At Peoria (Ill.) he kept his audience
in roars by recounting the good sayings
of his critical confrére, Sir WILLIAM
RoBERTson NicoLL.
At Philadelphia a very old man, who
claimed to be a younger brother of
Mr. Rochester (in Jane Eyre), publicly
embraced the illustrious visitor and
borrowed two dollars.

the compliment? It would be a better
appointment than many that could be
named.
The fact cannot be concealed that at
home the absence of Mr. SHoRTER in
America is seriously felt. Fleet Street
wears a bereaved air and Dublin is con-
scious of a poignant loss. As for our
authors, they are in a state of dismay;
some, it is true, like mice when the cat
is away, are taking liberties, but most
are paralysed by the knowledge that the
watchful eye is not there, the hand, so
instant to blame or praise, is resting.
Even publishers, normally an insensi-
tive race, are shaken, and books that
were to have been issued have been
held back. For what is the use of
bringing out new books if C. K. S. is
not here to pass definitive comments
upon them before their ink is dry?
England's loss is, however, America's
gain. A new cocktail has been named
after him.

What really impressed the Germans
most of all with the power of the Big

MORE ALLEVIATIONS.
THE late JAMES PAYN, who, as is well known, waged a
merciless war against sham admiration in literature, hap-
pened one day to hear me quote that tremendous fellow,
SIBRANDUs SchAFNABURGENSIs. The particular lines I mean
are those in which he says:–
“Then I went indoors, brought out a loaf,
Half a cheese and a bottle of Chablis;
Lay on the grass and forgot the oaf
er a jolly chapter of Rabelais.”
Mr. PAYN remarked sharply:—
“It would cost him some trouble to find one. I've
never found a jolly chapter of RABELAIs in my life, and
what's more I mean to say so some day and watch the
faces.”
Well, Mr. PAYN believed in stating his own views truth-
fully. No doubt the necessity of finding a rhyme for
“Chablis” had something to do with the appearance of
RABELAis' name at the end of that line. But that cannot
have been the reason why Pope, being under no compulsion
of rhyme, brought RABELAIs into his lines:—
“O thou ! whatever title please thine ear,
Dean, Drapier, Bickerstaff or Gulliver !
Whether thou choose Cervantes’ serious air
Or laugh and shake in Rabelais' easy-chair.”
I don't much care whether I have quoted correctly or not.
I suggested last week in these columns that one might be
allowed, as a compensation for advancing years, to use one's
quotations without fastidious regard for their accuracy.
On consideration I don't see why this liberty should not be
even further extended. I can see (“in my mind's eye,
Horatio”) whole masterpieces coming within its scope and
yielding with a sufficiently bad grace to a courageous can-
dour like JAMES PAYN's. Why should Don Quiaote, for in-
stance, tyrannise over us? He has had a good innings, in
the course of which, it is only fair to acknowledge, he has
been enormously helped by his henchman, Sancho Panza,
a fellow of infinite wit, no doubt. There are however
readers who set up these two as idols and would compel us
to kneel to them, especially when Sancho receives the ap-
pointment of Governor of Barataria. I acknowledge I am
a constant devotee of Don Quixote and his Sancho, but it
is conceivable that there are people who have no liking for
them. Let such, if they are old enough, proclaim it, as
JAMES PAYN did his opinion about RABELAIs’ fun.
I should like to bring certain long poems of universal
renown within the scope of my principle. What about
Paradise Lost 2 Did any woman, except perhaps GEORGE
ELIOT, ever read it throughout unless under scholastic
compulsion ? I doubt it; her sense of humour would not
allow her to. Take, for instance, the following lines, de-
scribing the simple amusements of our first parents:–
“About them frisking played
All beasts of the earth since wild, and of all chase
In wood or wilderness, forest or den.
Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw
Dandled the kid ; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,
Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,
To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed
His lithe proboscis.”
Now, if anybody does not like MILTON's fun, why, in the
name of a “lithe proboscis,” should he not say so—in his
mature middle-age 2

Happen to me when I'm demobilised.
That was an error. Not a drum was sounded;
No personage, no panoply, no pep;
Only a single private who expounded
My pathway out, and I went forth dumbfounded;
Merely remembering to mind the step.
Nothing spectacular and nothing solemn;
No company of men that I might drill,
And either tick 'em off or else extol 'em .
And give 'em “Facing left, advance in column,”
And leave 'em marching, marching onwards till
They butted into something. Never a blooming
Ultimate kit-inspection as I passed,
Nor sound of Sergeant-majors' voices booming, .
Nor weary stance while aides-de-camp were fuming,
Not even a practice fire-drill at the last.
And that 's the end. To-morrow I'll awaken
To meet a world of doubtfulness and gloom,
By orders and by Adjutants forsaken,
And none to tell what action should be taken,
If any, through what channels, and by whom.
But dreams remain amidst the new disaster:
There shall be visions when the firelight burns–
Squads of recruits for ever doubling faster,
Fresh clothing-issues from the Quartermaster
And audit boards and absentee returns.
I shall forget awhile civilian fashions
And watch the P.T. merchants on the square,
And polish tins and soothe the Colonel's passions,
And mount the guard and go and see the rations
And bid departed days be “as you were.”
And souvenirs " I know there are a number
Who stuff their homes with memories of dread;
The ancient hat-stand in the hall encumber
With Pickelhaubes and delight to slumber
With heaps of nasty nose-caps round their bed.
Not I, the bard. When delicately suited
I move again amid the mufti swarms,
Since trophies from the Front may be disputed,

My little library of Army forms. Evoy.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Chartered Adventurer (SKEFFINGTON) is what AGNES
and EGERTON CASTLE rather pleasantly call their latest hero,
Terence O'Flaherty, impecunious gentleman of fortune,
lover and general exponent of the picturesque arts of
romance. In a special sense indeed, since you have him
not only adventuring for fame and fortune, but, as a by-
product, turning his exploits into material for a worked-
out early-Victorian novelist, whose “ghost” he had, in a
more than usually impecunious moment, consented to be-
come. I found this same unfortunate author, gravelled for
lack of sensational matter, at once the most entertaining
and original figure in the book, whose course is, to tell the
truth, marked otherwise by no very conspicuous freshness.
The particular adventure to which O'Flaherty and his
companion, Lord Marlowe, are here devoted, is concerned
with the intrigues of Madame la duchesse DE BERRI on
behalf of her son, as de jure King of France, under the title
of Charles X. They provide an environment singularly apt
for such affairs; the “wild venture” and the abortive,
forgotten rising in which it culminated give colour to a
multitude of dashing exploits. In themselves, however,
these follow what might be called common form, showing
the two young men exposed to a sufficiency of danger
and exhibiting that blend of folly and gallantry expected
of their situation. As to the former quality, when, I
wonder, will the heroes of romantic fiction learn that the
“pretty youth,” with flashing eyes contradicted by a
manner of singular modesty, is really—well, what com-
mon folk could have known her for in the first glance?
To sum up, I should call The Chartered Adventurer ad-
mirable for almost anyone else's writing, but just a little
below the best Castilian standard.
The Pagan (METHUEN) certainly deserves to be called
one of the uncommon stories. Whether it will be a popular
success is of course a different matter. At least it confirms
my previous suspicion, that Mr. CHARLES INGE is a novelist
who takes his art seriously and is not afraid of originality.
The moral of his tale, which perhaps hardly needs much
enforcing to-day, is—don't be too much impressed with the
idea of the superman, and especially don't try to go one
better. That was the attempt that broke up the happy
home where John Witherson had lived with his wife, his
infant son and his mother and sister-in-law (too many; but
that is beside the point). John had been a school-
master, old style, teaching in the ancient faiths, muscular
Christianity, play-the-game, sportsmanship and the rest.
But about half-way through the War the apparent invinci-
bility of brutal force began to rattle John's nerves. It rattled
them so much that he eventually sold his school, moved
his household, including the in-laws, to Suburbia, and
set up, in partnership with two others of like mind, as in-
structor of youth, after the jungle law of ruthless efficiency.
Not content with this, he proposed also to turn the infant
Witherson into a prospective superman by giving him toy-
tigers and brief lectures on the rewards of frightfulness.
Whereat the mother, finding her protests disregarded, dried

her eyes and set herself to fill the poor child's infrequent
leisure with anti-toxin injections of the higher morality as
conveyed in the poetry of TENNYsoN. You now take my
meaning when I speak of Mr. INGE as sufficiently single-
minded to brave some danger of unintentional humour.
Really my sketch has done less than justice to a story that
will hold your interest, if only for the sincerity with which
it is handled; for myself I was first impatient, then deri-
sive, finally curious to know how it was going to end. I
rather think this sounds like a victory for Mr. INGE.
It will add a new terror to the Peace if everybody who
has done A Year of Public Life (Constable) in or about
deals with German revolutionary machinations in the Orient.
It fails because it moves too rapidly and covers far too much
ground. The writer has neither the gift nor the general
information necessary for this class of adventurous fiction.
Her genius lies in her power of reproducing the atmosphere
of crime and intrigue; but her Orient and her Orientals seem
to have lost their hold on the reader's imagination. And I
venture to remind her that it is fatal in this kind of story to
replace known facts by unnecessary fiction; for example, to
speak, as she does, of a German warship in the Indian Ocean
as the Blücher, when all the world knows that that particular
vessel was elsewhere. It will be easily understood that
she gives us a hero who wins his heart's desire, and numer-
Whitehall is to make a
hook about it. Not that
Mrs. C. S. PEEL does not
deserve well of her country.
She is evidently a capable
person and hustled about
the country for the Ministry
of Food to some purpose
before the days of compul-
sory rationing. Her general
idea seems to be that simple
folk are tremendously in-
terested in the most trivial
and indirect details of im-
portant folk. So she will
tell you how Sir HENRY
REw and Mr. ULICK WIN-
Tour were fond of tea (Sir
HENRY liked a bun as well);
how Mr. KENNEDY Jon Es
once lent her his car; how
Lord DEvoNPoRT, asked if
biscuits were included in
the voluntary cereal ration,
said firmly, “Yes, they
are "; how the chauffeur
suddenly put on the brake
and she bumped into “poor
M. FAIDIDEs "; how she
“visited Bath twice and
bought a guide-book,” in-
formation from which she
retails; how secretaries of
Ministers came out to say

tionalities who are all safely
foiled, the entire romance
being conducted with a
ladylike absence of the

companies this class of
fiction. That is its best
recommendation.
The fact that The Pearl
(BLAckwell) is described
in its sub-title as “A Story

may perhaps somewhat
mislead you. Let me there:
fore hasten to explain that
the school is for girls, and
the Oxford life is that en-
joyed by wearers of what-
ever may be the modern
substitute for skirts. Not
too immediately modern in:
deed, as the events fall
within the period of the
South African war, a fact
that will, of course, much
increase their appeal for
those whose Oxford me-
mories belong to the same
epoch. But it is naturally
a book difficult for the male
reviewer to appraise with
exactitude. All I can say,
being unconversant with
the domestic politics of a
ladies' college, is that I
should imagine Miss WINI-
FRED TAYLoR to have given
YER MOTHER TAKES IN WASHIN'ſ "
kitchen, asked of a certain substance, “What's that ?" and
Princess MARY at once replied, “Maize" (just like that).
This kind of anecdote, by the way, which our long-suffering
Royal Family has to endure in the Press might very well be
made actionable under a new lése-majesté law. There are
better things than this in the book, but on balance I don't
really think it establishes a fair case for existence. The most
interesting thing in it is a detailed account of the canteen
systems at the Renault and Citroën works near Paris.
There is a great falling off in quality as between The
Pointing Man and the anonymous authoress's latest effort,
The Man Who Tried Everything (HUTCHINson), a fact which
may be partly accounted for by the brief time elapsing
between its appearance and that of its immediate fore-
runner, The Man from Trinidad. Her new book is a war
spy story—an exacting form of fiction in any event—and
a remarkably true picture of existence therein; its mixture
of academic ambition, sentiment, religious fervour and party
spirit seems (as was to be expected) pretty much as we
knew it in the masculine camp. The chief point of differ:
ence appears to be that Miss TAYLoR's heroine, Janet, and
her friends (all pleasantly individual) are naturally thrown
a good deal more upon themselves than is the case with
their more fortunate brothers. I have no doubt of the
book's success. Girl-graduates, past, present and to come,
will of course buy it; while in that other Oxford, now sº
happily re-awakening, I can fancy it being read with all
the curiosity that naturally attaches to revelations of the
unknown land.

Dictated terms the most abhorrent
And made her sign her own death-

At Bucharest 'twas much the same:
You had Roumania under heel;
No pity here nor generous shame,
But just the argument of steel,
The logic of the butcher's knife—
And so she signed away her life.

The perfect models made by you ;
Yet the ideals they enshrine
We dimly strove to keep in view,
Trying to draft, with broad effect,
The kind of Peace that you'd expect.

By which we saw your own inspired;

O. S.
THE BEETLE OF BUDA-PESTH.
AN UNRECoRDED EPIsodF: OF THE
GREAT WAR.
THE War being now practically at
an end and Austria-Hungary irrevoc-
ably broken up, I am able to recount
an adventure, in which I was involved,
that occurred at Buda-Pesth in the
second week of August, 1914.
Seated at a café on the famous Franz-
Josef Quai, I was sipping coffee, after an
excellent lunch, with Frederick, whose
surname I will not mention in case I
get into trouble for relating the inci-
dent before Peace is actually signed.
The sun shone joyously down upon the
kaleidoscope of gaily dressed people
promenading by the cool waters of the
Danube, and we sat engrossed—I in
the charm of the scene, and Frederick
in that of individual beauties who
passed to and fro.
Suddenly I noticed that he was star-
ing intently upon the ground a few
yards in front of him. I asked him
what was the matter.
“Perceive,” he replied in a very
serious tone, “a small beetle of the order
of Coleoptera making its way across
the pavement 2 ” -
“I do perceive it,” I replied; “but
what about it 2 ”
“Does it not occur to you,” he con-
tinued, “that it is a very remarkable
thing that that beetle should have al-
ready travelled six feet across the most
crowded promenade in Buda-Pesth
without having been trodden on 2"
Being used to Frederick I do not
take him too seriously and made no
reply, intending to brush the incident
aside, but I found my gaze continually
returning to Coleopteron, conscious of
that peculiar fascination which attracts
one to impending tragedy. It was
evident that he had just left the café
and was hurrying across the promenade
to catch the little steamer which was
due to leave in ten minutes for Oſen.
It was also evident to any thinking
individual that there must be some
extraordinarily urgent reason for his
wishing to catch the boat which justi-
fied him in taking the awful risks which
he was incurring. The position was
full of human interest and I became as
intrigued as Frederick.
It seemed that Coleopteron was under
some divine protection which enabled
him to elude so large a crowd. One
| lady stepped right on him, but appar-
ently, by a piece of brilliant footwork,
he managed to get in the arch between
the sole and the heel and so survive.
Another promenader brushed him with
his boot and knocked him over, but
he doggedly continued on his way.
I was conscious of a greatly acceler-
ated beating of my heart and noticed
that Frederick was perspiring freely.
Half-way across the twenty-foot pave.
ment Coleopteron was sniffed at by a
dog and our hearts stopped beating, but
again he was saved by the fact that the
dog was on a chain and just hadn't time
to eat him before he was dragged after
his mistress. - -
I noticed now that Frederick's eyes
were protruding from his head and that
he was muttering to himself. I too
felt the strain telling upon me. A shrill
whistle from the little steamer warning
passengers to hurry up was immediately
responded to by č. who in-
creased his speed to the utmost, when
suddenly Frederick's trembling hand
caught mine.
“Look!” he said, and, following his
gaze, I saw approaching twelve gen-
darmes. We did not speak; we did not
need to invite each other's views; our
minds had but a single thought —
he
Coleopteron could not possibly escape
twenty-four Hungarian Government
boots.
On scurried our little friend and on
came the gendarmes. I was conscious
of a feeling of physical sickness, and
Frederick groaned aloud. As the dread-
ful moment of contact approached we
shut our eyes tight and each gripped
the other's hand. How long we re-
mained like this I cannot tell, for we
were both afraid to look and see the
tiny smudge on the pavement indicat-
ing a hero's end; but eventually, by
mutual arrangement, we opened our
eyes, and then we saw—not a smudge,
but Coleopteron still advancing quite
unconcerned. It was a miracle.
“I can't stand it any longer,” cried
Frederick, to the amazement of those
sitting about us outside the café, “I
shall go mad!” and, leaping up from his
seat, he rushed across the promenade
and, taking from his pocket a picture-
postcard of some Hungarian beauty, he
coaxed Coleopteron to walk on to it,
then bore him triumphantly back and
deposited him upon the leaf of a palm
which overhung our table.
Shortly afterwards the little steamer
whistled again and left the quay.
Frederick remained silent for some
time as befits a man who has saved a
life, and then arose to have a look at
Coleopteron and doubtless to make him.
self better known to the little hero;
but to his pained surprise Coleopteron
was not to be found. All over that
palm he searched in vain and on the
floor; then suddenly he emitted a gur:
gling sound and I saw that he was in
the grip of deep emotion. There was
a look on his face I had never seen
before, and I anxiously asked him what
had happened. For some time he could
not speak, but stood gazing vacantly
into space. At last, with parched lips,
spoke. -
“Look in the milk-jug ' " he said,
and sank into his chair.
For a moment I thought that
Frederick had been poisoned, and then
I realised the truth, for there in the
hot milk floated the corpse of Cole.
opteron.
“Why did he do it?” pleaded
Frederick with a break in his voice, ,
“Because,” I replied, “you hadn't
the sense to realise that he was staking
his all on catching that boat, and, in
stead of helping him, you brought him
back to where he started from.”

Early the next morning, at Frederick's
desire, we left Buda-Pesth en route for
the Swiss Frontier. It was impossible.

longer in a city that had for him such

UNEMPLOYMENT PAY."
Mºº
Temporary Officer (in department which they have forgotten to close down). “DASH IT!
I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T GET
A CAPITAL OUTLAY.
IT was, in a sense, mutual. We
had chickens; the chickens had us.
On the other hand, they had the best
of the bargain. We kept them; and
they did not keep us.
My aunt insisted that we must keep
chickens, and you know my aunt.
Pardon | You don't know my aunt.
She is an elderly maiden lady who
“keeps house” for me. She is emin-
ently practical—theoretically speaking.
She insisted. “With eggs at eight-
pence it's a sin and a shame not to
keep hens in war-time.”
I urged that the food would cost a
good many eightpences—in war-time.
Her reply was “Pshaw!” (She
really does say “Pshaw "-and means
it.) “Pshaw they will live on kitchen
scraps.”
We consulted Nibletts. He has a
local reputation as a chicken expert,
mainly, I believe, because he's a
butcher. He recommended a breed
called Wild Oats (by which he meant,
I discovered, Wyandottes).
“You take my tip, Sir," he said, “and
buy Wild Oats. If you'll excuse the
word—” (Nibletts is always apologising
for some term he is about to use, which
promises to be inexpressibly shocking
to polite ears, and never is)—“they're
clinkers.”
We ordered a round dozen. We also
bought a hen-house fitted with all
modern conveniences. The total outlay
represented a prince's ransom ; but, as
I pointed out to my aunt, we had a run
for our money.
The hens, when they arrived, were
not strictly “as per” advertisement.
We bought them as laying pullets,
and they didn't lay for quite a time—
so far as we knew. Nibletts, however,
declared that they were “what you
might call in the pink,” and surmised
that the train journey had “put 'em
off the lay, as you might say.” If
eating and fighting were evidences of
their being “in the pink,” those birds
must have enjoyed exceptional health.
They also slept well, I believe.
After about a month one enormous
egg arrived—an egg that would not
have disgraced a young ostrich. Its
huge dimensions worried my aunt.
She wondered if they were a symptom,
and consulted Nibletts.
He put it down to the food. He
said that kitchen scraps were “no
good for laying pullets.” “That egg,
lady,” he said, “is what us fanciers
call—excuse me—” (I saw my aunt
shudder in anticipation)—“a bloomer.
You must give 'em a lot more meal.”
We bought a big sack of meal—
through the medium of Nibletts. If I
remember rightly it cost rather more
than the pullets.
Still no eggs. Then some of the
hens went out of “the pink.” For
instance, one developed a chronic habit
of running centripetally round a con-
stantly diminishing circle, fainting
on arriving at the geometrical centre.
My distressed aunt called in Nibletts
to prescribe. There was only one word
for it—that awful word “staggers.”
There was only one cure for it—death.
Should he wring its neck?
We feelingly withdrew, and he did
it. He took the corpse away with
him, so that he presumably had a use
for it. -
Soon a second pullet went down
with a considerably swollen face. My
aunt bathed it twice a day in a hot
anti-septic, but to no purpose, except
that the poor thing seemed much com-
forted by the fomentation. That hen
was, Nibletts whispered to me, for fear

my aunt should overhear, “a waster.”
The only thing to do was to coop it
up from the rest, or they'd all go down
with it—whatever it was.
We cooped it up till it died.
Nibletts certified the cause of death
as that unmentionable complaint, the

'til no eggs, notwithstanding re-
peated appeals in the sacred name of
Macduff. We did, however, find out
what the trouble was.
The hens were eating the eggs'
Nibletts said—under his breath—
that they were what was known as
“blighters.” He recommended (depre-
cating the term) a “stodger.” A
“stodger” proved to be an egg-shell
stuffed with bread-crumbs, mustard and
the strongest photographic ammonia.
My aunt said it would be cruel. It
was certainly rough on me. Nibletts
apologetically directed me to blow an
egg—“a shop 'un 'd do." Accordingly,
following his instructions, I injected or
otherwise introduced the ingredients
through a small aperture. It was the
bread-crumbs that gave me most
trouble; but it was the photographic
ammonia that was “cruel.” The mus-
tard went in quite easily with a squirt.
I stopped the holes with paper stuck
on with sealing-wax and put the auf
farci in the run. I waited to see what
would happen. It happened at once.
All ten hens went for that egg in a
convergent attack, and all ten pecks
got home simultaneously. The depu-
tation then hurriedly withdrew, with
loud protests, and spent the rest of the
day wiping their beaks in the cool
earth.
But they remained recalcitrant. They
systematically cannibalized. A cackle
from the layer brought all the rest to
the spot; and I simply couldn't stay
there all day to forestall the onslaught.
Nibletts suggested our getting a
patent laying-box, furnished with (what
he apologised to my aunt for calling) a
false front. My aunt did not at first
grasp the idea, but what Nibletts did
in fact refer to was a contrivance that
would admit one sitter only at a time,
subsequent unauthorised entrance being
cut off by an ingenious drop slide.
Further elaborate construction also pre-
vented the sitter herself from turning
round to peck. She had to remain
sitting till some human came and lifted
her out.
Just one egg was laid in that patent
box. The object of it was also patent—
to the hens. Nothing would induce
them to use it after that once.
Nibletts then recommended (if he
might so describe it) a “tit-up.” That
was, so to speak, a conjuring-trick of
a laying-box, which let the egg fall

I SUGGEST, SIR, THAT EITHER YOU PASS

through a trap-door into a padded cell
beneath. My aunt thought it unnatural
and feared that it might be exhausting.
Nevertheless we tried it, and extracted
one solitary egg from the basement.
Then, being an engineer by profes-
sion, I conceived a mechanical means
of giving those hens the scare of their
lives if they persisted in their anti-
social habits. I constructed a “spoof"
egg of white enamelled metal, with
hinges that opened when a catch was
touched. Inside I compressed one of
those jack-in-the-box snakes that spring
out when free to do so.
It was quite effective—as a parlour-
trick. Those hens pecked the catch
loose, and that cockatrice fairly stag-
gered them. It was to them a clear
case of “nourishing a viper.” But all
was as before.
Nibletts then gave up the case as
(what he might be excused for calling)
a “fair corker.” Should he wring their
(pause) necks?
We thought it best so, and gave him
a couple of “laying pullets” for his
trouble. The other eight kept us going
monotonously for about a month.
The house is still on offer. Houses
are scarce just now.
I have sown my Wyandottes.

PROCRASTINATION.
A FEw mornings ago I found among
my letters a tragic document—a bill.
A first quick glance at it filled me with
despair, because I was luxuriating in
that Fools' Paradise produced by the
illusion that one is all paid up. Of
course one never is; there is always
something that one forgets, and this
must have been it; so that, instead of
perfect freedom from liability, here I
was apparently still owing no less a
sum than £5 9s.
The figures looked familiar enough,
although disconcerting, but I rubbed
my eyes when I found that they were
made up of two items that had never
come my way; the first being one-and-
a-half dozen essences, £3 15s., and
the second, a dozen poudre assortie,
£1 14s. It could not be for me. Es-
sences and powders wholesale are not
in my line, nor is my acquaintance so
extensive among the Fair as these quan-
tities would imply.
A moment later all my anxieties
dispersed and tragedy turned to comedy
when I realised that the bill was for
the hairdresser with the same name as
my own, who lives next door but one
and gets so much of my correspondence.
I therefore put the bill on my desk,
intending to take it into the shop when
I went out ; and forgot it.

they have a vast theatre of their own
and perform three ballets every night
the old frustrated feeling that used to
tantalise us at the Opera and the Coli-
seum has vanished. But I have still
a grievance, and that is that the pro-
gramme is so rarely the programme
that I myself would have arranged.
In other words the three ballets that
form it are seldom the Big Three that
are nearest my heart. To be explicit,
I want Petroushka, and instead I find
myself not knowing where to look while
Scheherazade unfolds its appalling free-
doms; I want Les Sylphides, and in-
stead am given Les Papillons, which
is very lovely but not of an equal love-
liness; and I want Carnaval, and in-
stead am offered the perplexities of
The Fire Bird. It happened, however,
that one night recently the perfect
programme was given—Carnaval, Les
Sylphides and Petroushka; but there
was not a seat in the house, and I
therefore had to stand in great dis-
comfort, so that half the joy evaporated.

say) “what of the hairdresser who has
the same name as yourself and plies

thing—was surely to have been about

also about the evils of procrastination.
In short, it is a kind of tract.
On the morning after my disappoint-
ing evening at the Alhambra, while
moving some papers on my desk, I
brought to light the bill for the powder
and the essences. “Good Heavens !”
I murmured, “the poor fellow will be
distracted not to have this;” and I
took it in to him straightway.
I apologised for the delay.
“There is no hurry,” he replied.
“Accounts can wait; but I hope,” he
added, taking an envelope from a
drawer, “that this letter for you is
equally unimportant. It came, I'm
afraid, four days ago, and I was always
meaning to bring it in, but forgot.”
Unimportant It was merely an in-
vitation from the most adorable woman
in London to share her box at the
Russian Ballet on the previous night,
to see what she knew was my most
desired performance, Carnaval, Les
Sylphides and Petroushka.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PERILS OF REVIEWING.
A Most unfortunate thing has hap-
pened to a friend of mine called to
a friend of to a friend of
Well, I suppose the truth will have to
come out. It happened to me. Only
don't tell anybody.
I reviewed a book the other day. It
is not often I do this, because before
one can review a book one has to, or is
supposed to, read it, which wastes a
good deal of time. Even that isn't an
end of the trouble. The article which
follows is not really one's own, for the
wretched fellow who wrote the book is
always trying to push his way in with
his views on matrimony, or the Sussex
downs, or whatever his ridiculous sub-
ject is. He expects one to say, “Mr.
Blank's treatment of Hilda's relations
with her husband is masterly,” whereas
what one wants to say is, “Putting Mr.
Blank's book on one side we may con-
sider the larger question, whether—”
| and so consider it (alone) to the end of
the column. -
Well, I reviewed Mr. Blank's book,
Rotundity. As I expected, the first draft
had to be re-headed “A Corner of Old
London,” and used elsewhere; Mr. Blank
didn't get into it at all. I kept promis-
ing myself a sentence: “Take Rotundity,
for instance, the new novel by William
Blank, which, etc.,” but before I was
ready for it the article was finished. In
my second draft, realizing the dangers
of delay, I began at once, “This remark-
able novel,” and continued so for a
couple of sentences. But on reading it
through afterwards I saw at once that
the first two sentences were out of place
in an article that obviously ought to be
called “The Last Swallow ; ” so I cut
them out, sent “The Last Swallow : A
Reverie" to another Editor, and began
again. The third time I was successful.
Of course in my review I said all the
usual things. I said that Mr. Blank's
attitude to life was “subjective rather
than objective" ... and a little lower
down that it was “objective rather
than subjective.” I pointed out that in
his treatment of the major theme he
was a neo-romanticist, but I suggested
that, on the other hand, he had nothing
to learn from the Russians—or the
Russians had nothing to learn from
him; I forget which. And finally I
said (and this is the cause of the
whole trouble) that ANToINE WAUR-
ELLE's world-famous classic—and I
looked it up in the Encyclopædia—
world-renowned classic, Je Comprends
Tout, had been not without its influence
on Mr. Blank. It was a good review,
and the editor was pleased about it.
A few days later Mr. Blank wrote to
say that, curiously enough, he had never
read Je Comprends Tout. It didn't
seem to me very curious, because I had
never read it either, but I thought it
rather odd of him to confess as much
. to a stranger. The only book of WAUR-
ELLE's which I had read was Consola-
trice, in an English translation. How-
ever, one doesn't say these things in
a review. -
Now I have a French friend, Henri,
one of those annoying Frenchmen who
talks English much better than I do,
and Henri, for some extraordinary
reason, had seen my review. He has to
live in London now, but his heart is in
Paris; and I imagine that every word
of his beloved language which appears,
however casually, in an English paper
mysteriously catches his eye and brings
the scent and sounds of the boulevards
to him across the coffee-calps. So the
next time I met him he shook me
warmly by the hand, and told me how
glad he was that I was an admirer of
ANToINE WAURELLE's novels.
“Who isn't 2 " I said with a shrug,
and, to get the conversation on to safer
ground, I added hastily that in some
ways I almost liked Consolatrice best.
He shook my hand again. So did he.
A great book.
“But of course,” he said, “one
must read it in the original French. It
is the book of all others which loses by
translation.”
“Of course,” I agreed. Really, I
don't see what else I could have done.
“Do you remember that wonderful
phrase and he rattled it off.
“Magnificent, is it not?"
“Magnificent,” I said, remembering
an appointment instead. “Well, I
must be getting on. Good-bye.” And,
as I walked off, I patted my forehead
with my handkerchief and wondered
why the day had grown so warm
suddenly.
However the next day was even
warmer. Henri came to see me with
a book under his arm. We all have
one special book of our own which we
recommend to our acquaintances, re-
garding the love of it as perhaps the
best passport to our friendship. This
was Henri's. He was about to test
me. I had read and admired his
favourite WAURELLEs—in the original
French. Would I love his daring
LAFORGUE 2 My reputation as a man,
as a writer, as a critic, depended on it.
He handed me the book—in French.
“It is all there,” he said reverently,
as he gave it to me. “All your English
masters, they all come from him. Per-
haps, most of all your—But you shall
tell me when you have read it. You
shall tell me whom most you seem to see
there. Your MEREDITH 2 Your SHAW2
Your— But you shall tell me.”
“I will tell you,” I said faintly.
And I've got to tell him.
Don't think that I shall have any
difficulty in reading the book. Glancing
through it just now I came across
this:— - -
“‘Kate, avez-vous soupé a rant le
spectacle 2''. - - -
‘Non, je n'avais guère le carur i
manger.’”
Well, that's easy enough. Dut I

istic passages. It doesn't give you a
clue to LAFoRGUE's manner, any more
than “‘Must I sit here, mother 2'
‘Yes, without a doubt you must,’” tells
you all that you want to know about
MEREDITH. There's more in it than
that. -
And I've got to tell him.
But fancy holding forth on an author's
style after reading him laboriously with
a dictionary !
However, I must do my best; and in
my more hopeful moments I see the
conversation going like this:—
“Well ?”
“Oh, wonderful.”
“Really wonderful.”
“You see them all there 2 ”
“Yes, yes. It's really—wonderful.
MEREDITH-I mean—well, it's simply
—(after a pause) wonderful.”
“You see MEREDITH there most 2"
“Y-yes. Sometimes. And then some.
times I–I don't" (with truth). “It’s
difficult to say. Sometimes I–er—SHAw
—er—well, it's—” (with a gesture
somewhat Gallic) “How can I put it?”
“Not THACKERAY at all?” he says,
watching me eagerly.
I decide to risk it.
“Oh, but of course ! I mean—
THACKERAY | When I said MEREDITH
I was thinking of the others. But
THACKERAY—I mean THACKERAY is—
er ” (I've forgotten his name for
the moment and go on hastily) I mean
—er—THACKERAY, obviously.”
He shakes me by the hand. I am
his friend.
But this conversation only takes
place in my more hopeful moments. In
my less hopeful ones I see myself going
into the country for quite a long time.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 12th.-Lord FRENCH's
newspaper revelations were brought to
the notice of Mr. CHURCHILL, who ad-
duced the cases of the late Lords
Wolseley and RoPERTs as evidence
that Field-marshals, when unemployed,
have always been allowed considerable
freedom of criticism. The fact that
Lord FRENCH is Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland and (nominal) Commander-in-
Chief of the considerable army em-
ployed in that country makes no differ-
ence; but ordinary serving officers are
still subject to the Regulations and will
take FRENCH leave at their peril.
In the course of a further discussion
on milk - prices, about , which the
West Country is still up in arms, Mr.
McCURDY dropped the
remark that it was im-
possible to control cream,
owing, no doubt, to its no-
torious insurrectionary
tendencies; and Colonel
WEIGALL removed a load
of suspicion from some
of our minds by the em-
phatic declaration that
“a cow was not a pump,
of which the supply could
be turned off or on as one
liked.”
The FIRST CoM M Is-
sI-ONER of WoRKS was
not very hopeful about
the removal of the build-
in gs which disfigure the

say was that he was do-
ing his best to get the

of Kensington Gardens,
and let nature have a chance.
Tuesday, May 13th.-The Lords de-
feated the Government by inserting in
the Ministry of Health Bill a provision
that the new Minister should have only
one Parliamentary Secretary. In vain
Lord SANDHURST protested that the
amendment would tie the PRIME MIN-
ISTER’s hands. Lord MIDLETON was
delighted to think that it would. Lord
CREWE declared that the creation of
minor Ministers was becoming a dis-
ease (possibly the Ministry of Health
will include it among “notifiable” epi-
demics?). Lord BLEDIsLoB quoted the
old tag about big fleas and little fleas.
But after all there must be some check
to the inveterate tendency to somnol-

Would be a deficit of one hundred
millions this year on the working of
the railways. Members were therefore
surprised to find in the Budget that

entirely unnoticed. When taxed with

branch in the other. At Question-time
he was the stern upholder of law and
order, obliged within the last few days
to suspend a seditious newspaper and
to surround the Dublin Mansion House
with soldiers. A few moments later
he was moving the Second Reading of
a most generous Housing Bill, under
which Irish Corporations will be en-
abled to build thousands of dwellings
largely at the expense of the general
taxpayer.
In his warm welcome to the measure
Sir Edward CARson revealed a side of
his character not often seen, except by
his personal friends. He was so sym-
pathetic to the needs of the Irish
working-classes, so eloquent upon the
benefits to health, sobriety and con-
tentment that good houses would se-
cure, and so insistent upon the necess-
ity of making the new dwellings
beautiful as well as useful, that Mr.
DEVLIN could do little more than say
“ditto to Mr. BURKE.”
Wednesday, May 16th.-Those per-
sons, at home and abroad, who persist
in regarding the British as univeral
land-grabbers will please note that
Spitsbergen, despite the undoubted
fact that an Englishman landed there
three centuries ago, leaves us cold. Al-
though no direct response was made to
Mr. ASHLEY's suggestion that the future
of the island should be referred to the
Coal Commission, it is widely felt that
if Mr. SMILLIE and Sir LEO CHIOzzA
MonBY would volunteer to explore its
possibilities they would be doing the
country signal service.
The drawbacks of having the Leader-
ship of the Opposition in commission
were further exemplified when Sir
DoNALD MACLEAN in his most impres-
sive manner asked for a day to discuss
Lord FRENCH's commu-
nications to the Press.
Mr. Bon AR LAw inquired
if he desired to move a
Vote of Censure in his
capacity as Leader of the
Opposition. “No, no,”
shouted the supporters
of the rival claimants,
Mr. ADAMSON and Mr.
GEOR GE LA M B E R T.
Whereupon Sir DoNALD
altered his tone and
mildly observed that he
only wanted to clear up
a constitutional point.
The debate on Mr.
HARTSHORN's motion re-
garding the state of Ire-
land was unique of its
kind in that not a single
Member representing an
Irish constituency took
the floor; but in spite
of that it produced more heat than
light. Both the mover and the
seconder (Mr. SEXTON) were rich in
denunciation of the present Govern-
ment of Ireland, but poverty-stricken
in suggestions for its improvement.
Lord HENRY BENTINCR seized the op-
portunity to make final recantation of
his Unionist principles, but in default
of more practical proposals was re-
duced to imploring the people of
Ulster “to show some spirit of com-
promise; " and Lord HUGH CECIL in
a despairing moment declared that he
would sooner see three-fourths of Ire-
land independent than the whole of it
presented with a form of Home Rule
which no Irishman desired. After that
one appreciated Sir KEITH FRASER's
remark, that during four years' soldier-
ing in Ireland he had only met one
man who understood the Irish Question,
and he was an Englishman who had
only been there a week!

foreigner who should try to disentangle
the causes of Egyptian unrest from
the speeches delivered in both Houses
this afternoon will be rather puzzled.
From Captain WEdgwood BENN in the
Commons he would learn that it was
due to the ineptitude of the British
Administration, the ill-treatment of the
natives by the Army of Occupation,
and in particular the unsympathetic
attitude adopted by Lord CURzoN to-
wards the Nationalist leaders, one of
whom, according to Captain BENN,
“held in Egypt a position compar-
able with that of Mr. Speaker here.”
Across the corridor at the very same
moment Lord CURzoN was asserting
that Egypt was enjoying extraordinary
material prosperity, that the British
soldiery had shown wonderful restraint
in very trying circumstances and that
the Government had not the least de-
MORE MUSICAL REGONSTRUCTION.
(By our Special Reporter, who is also
busy with the Coal Commission.)
At the three hundred and seventeenth
sitting of the Musical Reconstruction
Commission Mr. Justice Bland, the
President, said he felt sure he would
be voicing the feelings of all present
in tendering his congratulations to Sir
Leonardo Spaghetti Coyne on his ele-
vation to the peerage as Wiscount Ver-
micelli of Milan, and to Mr. Gladney
Jebb on receiving the honour of K.P.O.
(Knight of the Proletarian Order).
A memorandum on the economics of
the Russian Ballet and the probable
cost of its reorganisation on a Marxian
basis was read by Mr. Ploffskin of the
Garden City Gymnosophist Guild. By
a scheme for a uniform salary for all
dancers, compulsory vegetarian diet,

dividuality (when not too
exuberant, of course) or
deny to natives an ever-
increasing share in the ad-
ministration of their coun-
try. They would have been
quite ready to listen to ZAGH-
LUL and his friends if they
had not begun by demand-
ing the complete disappear-
ance of British rule. The
intelligent foreigner will
probably come to the con-
clusion that Egypt is very
like Ireland—except that it
has no Ulster.

Sir Mark Holloway,who next occupied
the witness's chair, admitted, in reply
to the questions of Sir Gladney Jebb,
that, since his student days, he had
seldom been engaged in manual labour
on any instrument for more than two
hours a day. It was not necessary for
a conductor. But he knew of pianists
who practised for six or even eight
hours a day with impunity.
Sir Gladney Jebb. Do you not think
that if all compositions were written in
the key of Cit would materially couduce
to the greatest happiness of the greatest
number?—The President has already
deprecated the multiplication of hypo-
thetical questions, which have reached
a total of more than fifteen thousand.
Viscount Vermicelli. Do you think
that the unrestrained performance of
Jazz-music conduces to the moral bet-
terment of the simian proletariat?—
- Ti That seems to me to be a
question which bears on the
administration of the Un-
necessary Noises Act.
Are you in favour of the
establishment of a Ministry
for the Control of Syncopa-
tion ? — No ; but I would
cordially support a Bill for
the Compulsory Segrega-
tion of Irresponsible Col-
lectivists.
In reply to Mr. Moody
MacTear, Sir Mark Hollo-
way said that he had never
been down a coal-mine, but
that he had a few shares in
a gold-mine, which had cost
him five pounds a-piece, but
had never borne any divi-
dends and were now quoted
planes that is going on
at Farnborough and elsewhere. Owing
to the rapid progress in aviation they
were already obsolete for military
purposes before they were delivered.
They are quite unsuitable for civilian
use, and are therefore being “re-
duced to produce”—a euphemism for
“scrapped.”
Mr. ShoBTT was not in his place, but
the interests of the Home Department
did not suffer in the hands of the
Under-Secretary. Sir HAMAR GREEN-
wood rattles out his replies with the
speed and accuracy of a machine-gun,
and has a neat formula for dealing with
“supplementaries”: “All these further
Questions are covered by my original

Mr. Ploffskin was of opinion that a
Bolshevist Ballet might be safely or-
ganised so as to satisfy the artistic
aspirations of the proletariat and
counteract the permicious influences of
the pseudo-Ethiopian style affected by
the idle rich.
Examined by Sir Edwin Edgar, O.M.,
Mr. Ploffskin admitted that none of the
famous Russian composers of recent
years had associated themselves with
the Revolutionary movement, and that
the Russian Ballet had originally been
an integral part of the Imperial Opera.
But he had no doubt that on a proper
proletarian basis it would function with
a far more beneficent activity. He
pointed out that there was a strong
facial resemblance between TROTSKY
and M. PADEREw8K1, and between
LENIN and BEETHovf. N. In reply to a
question from Mr. Moody MacTear,
Mr. Ploffskin said that he had been

The next witness, Dame Frisca, the
famous Californian singer, was sub-
jected to a remarkably severe examina-
tion by Mr. Moody MacTear.
Mr. Moody MacTear. Do you consider
that the assumption of the title prima
donna is compatible with democratic
principles?—I never assumed it; it was
bestowed on me by the free suffrages of
the musical world. -
Mr. MacTear. Then you admit that
you possess it. Are you prepared to
submit proof of your title to the Com-
mission ?—Certainly; but it would pro-
bably mean bringing forty van-loads of
press-cuttings and cause considerable
congestion of traffic.
Mr. MacTear. Is it not the case that
the prima donna has been condemned
by the best musical critics as an obsolete
anachronism, tending to perpetuate the
abuses of the “star” system and to
foster breaches of the Decalogue and
to enhance the soloist at the expense of
the chorus?—I believe that WAGNER

[May 21, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“DIAMOND-CUT-DIAMOND.”
THIS is to warn all honest men to
beware of No. 007 Field Company, R.I.,
known to its victims as “Chaucer's
Gang,” the most conscienceless crew
of body-snatchers and common thieves
in all the B.E.F.
I am myself no fastidious precisian,
being in a Labour Company, but there
are limits—or should be. My own par-
ticular grouch against them started at
Ripilly-sur-Somme. They, being skilled
Royal Engineers, were clearing under-
growth and putting up huts in Ripilly
woods for a division due to arrive,
and my scorned rabble were unloading
the huts in sections from barges at
Ripilly canal wharf and loading them
on to lorries for transport to the woods.
Chaucer and his Royal Engineers were
living on the spot— Ardennes wav-
ing o'er them her green leaves and so
forth—and we were in rest billets (loud
roars of raucous laughter) in Ripilly
village, the least sanitary spot in the
whole war zone." '
Chaucer wouldn't let us stay with
him in the huts—said the Chief En-
gineer was very keen on men living next
their work. But between Ripilly and
the canal wharf was an ideal spot. The
chalk downs sloped steeply to the river,
and halfway down was a bit of a level
plateau just the size for a couple of huts.
South aspect; good fishing and bath-
ing; a home from home. The woods
hid it from view above and the road-
side poplars from below. It was a
truly desirable building site.
We had a hurdle-maker in our com-
pany, so I gave him a brace of light-
duty men as apprentices and they built
a little hut of wattle and daub. It had
a nice rural appearance and was warm,
but it leaked in wet weather, and the
more I thought of Chaucer lying dry
under his felt roofs the worse I felt
about it. So I had a chat with my
sergeant at the wharf, and the long
and short of it was that two walls and
one roof got delivered by mistake at
the desirable building-site.
We worked late that night, and next
day had thirty men in residence, with
one end of the long hut partitioned off
for Simmonds, my subaltern, and myself.
So far so good. I began to think
about making another mistake and
getting a second hut, but that evening
Chaucer came sliding down over the
steep turf, visibly annoyed.
“Where did you get this hut?”
“Found it.”
“On Ripilly wharf 2 ".
“Certainly not. I found it down
there by the road and had it brought
up here for safety. If a lorry had run
over it in the dark—”
“Ah, cut it out,” he said. “The
hut is mine. I found two odd sections
in the last barge-load. Any poacher
who knew his job would burn the
feathers when he cooked the bird. You
needn't start to explain about your fool
N.C.O., who made a mistake. I keep
that sort of N.C.O. myself. If I get
an official inquiry about this hut I
shall send back official information.”
“Right-o! Then come in and have
a drink, and don't be official before
you need.” -
That's where I was wrong. I tried
to enlist the blighter's sympathy.
Showed him round camp, the view,
the bathing—everything. When Sim-
monds came up from the river with a
string of rot.ch Chaucer admitted it
was a truly bon billet. . .
Next day he called again with one of
his subalterns, a creature called Gubson,
who went down to the river to watch
Simmonds fish. When he had gone
Chaucer told me he had a spare hut.
“Not one of these divisional huts,
but a thing we knocked up ourselves.
We've nearly finished our job here,
and if it's any use to you you can have
it. But mind you, I, know nothing
about this other hut you've got here.
If you're caught with that one your
blood be on your own head.”
“You're a Christian,” I told him,
and, Gubson and Simmonds returning,
the conference had a drink and ad-
journed. -
Next day I found quite a squad of
light-duty men, and sent 'em to dis-
mantle and bring down Chaucer's hut.
I admit they rather exceeded instruc-
tions, for they brought a lot of things
that Chaucer had omitted to mention.
However, they said he was there when
they took them, so I supposed it was
all right. Besides the hut they had
two bell-tents, a big tarpaulin, some
corrugated iron and expanded metal,
some home-made chairs and tables, a
water-tank and a field kitchen, with its
wheels broken off—a noble lot of loot
it was. They worked like beavers bring-
ing it down and getting it in place, and
when Chaucer drifted down again at
the end of the week all my men were
housed there as snug as you please.
Finally Gubson presented the camp
with a punt he had salved in Sailly vil-
lage—and there we were, all the plea-
sures of the Riviera and none of the
disreputable company.
We were so pleased with all they
had done for us that we suggested they
should stay the night and celebrate the
occasion. Chaucer said he would be
delighted, if we would send to his bat-
man and tell him to bring down his
razor and toothbrush. At midnight,
when the batman arrived, Chaucer said
expecting the M.O. at our camp to-
it was time for bed. And could we give
his man a shake-down, please? It was
pretty dark, he said, and the fool might
lose his way home.
That should have warned me. Chau-
cer wasn't the man to keep a batman
who was a fool.
It must have been about 3 A.M. when
I was waked by my man helping Chau-
cer dress.
“What's the matter ?”
“Your fellow says my man's ill.”
“What is it 2 '' -
“I dunno, Sir,” my man said. “'E's
groanin' an' rollin' about an’ keepin'
all us others awake.”
When I got to the men's hut I found
Chaucer kneeling beside the sick man,
who was holding his head and groan-
ing. All the other men were sitting up
and looking on. After a minute or
two Chaucer got up and beckoned me
outside.
“Look here,” he said, “I don't want
to scare you, but suppose that chap's
got anything infectious. Is there a
doctor handy? -
“Nowhere nearer than Sailly.”
“Well, Gubson tells me they were
day. He may have stayed the night.
Can you send somebody up to see?”
I sent off an orderly at once, and in
half-an-hour a young doctor arrived,
and ordered all the other men out of
the hut. Then he pulled a gaudy hand-
kerchief out of his pocket, sprinkled it
with some stuff out of a small phial,
tied it over his mouth and only then
began to fiddle about the sick man,
feeling his pulse and sounding him.
Then he got up, readjusted his hand-
kerchief-respirator and mumbled that it
was cerebro-spinal.something. Spotted
fever.
We all got out of that hut in double-
quick time, believe me. The doctor
was full of orders — half a hundred
things to do at once. The man must
be strictly isolated. All the contacts
—every blessed man who had been in
the hut with him—must be placed
under supervision. The hut must be
put out of bounds. . And when he
found half the men had gone under
the tarpaulin shelter he put that out of
bounds too. -
We were a full hour trying to
separate the contacts; but when the
doctor found the cook getting breakfast
ready and heard he had been in the
sick man's hut he threw his hand in.
“I won't answer for a single one of
you,” he said; “the place is no better
than a pest-house. Throw that break-
fast away. It's sheer poison. Clear
out, all of you.”
It was Chaucer started the panic. I
saw him sneaking away up the slope,

so I thought it better to make a move
too. I didn't ask the doctor where we
were to go; he'd have had us all sleep-
ing out on the open grass for a week if
I had. So the whole lot of us, half
asleep, trekked back to Ripilly village
and turned into our old billets again.

It was my Sergeant-Major who told
me next day that Chaucer and his gang
had taken possession of the Riviera—
my Riviera. I went there at once, to
find out what it all meant, but they had
a sentry at the foot of the slope, who
said the camp was infected and no one
was allowed there; so I climbed the
slopes and looked down from above.
.| Chaucer was smoking outside my pet
hut talking to a couple of his sub-
alterns, and a string of men was lined
up beside the field kitchen for tea.
Close by, the batman, recovered from
his illness, was putting a fishing-rod
together, and one of the subalterns
blew his nose on a gaudy handkerchief
which I recognised at once.
I went straight back and told the
Town Major of Ripilly that one of the
new divisional huts was being occupied
by the Sappers. It wasn't cricket, but
it was all I could do.
“That's all right,” he said. “Chau-
cer's acting as divisional R.E. He's
entitled to one hut. He told me he
had been arranging for you to erect it
for him.”

AT THE PLAY.
“CyFANO " Moves To DRURY LANE.
SIR THoMAS BEECHAM, having been
translated to another place, has made
way for Cyrano and his nose, which
now finds more room to turn round in.
I had not seen Mr. LoRAINE on the
more congested stage of the Garrick.
Indeed the last time that I assisted at
M. RosTAND's play was some twenty
years ago in the South of France. It
happened that there had recently been
Spaniard. And was I wrong in tracing
a hint of other experiences gained at
the front, when Mr. LoRAINE nearly
turned up his false nose at the mention
of “military wit.”
The part offers little scope for humour.
Cyrano, with all his generous impulses,
is too self-conscious for that. But in
each of his moods and phases—bravado,
sacrifice, acceptance of the inexorable
pathos of things—Mr. LoRAINE had got
at the heart of the man. A very brave
and inspiring performance. O. S.
THE DAY.
AT last the great day has arrived; in
less than half an hour I shall be at the
church. Heavens ! what excitement.
And yet I suppose most girls have had
to undergo the ordeal, if one may so
describe it, at some period of their life.
The magic church is not far distant
and from my room I can hear the
merry pealing of the bells. In the
garden the birds are singing as they
have never sung before. Truly life is
a vogue of Musketeer plays in Eng-
land. Behind my seat was a British
Baronet (a recent creation) for
whom the French language had
little or no meaning. The first
and only sign of intelligence that
he showed was well on in the per-
formance, at the words, “Qui est ce
monsieur 2 " “C'est D'Artagnan.”
(D'Artagnan then disappears al-
together).
“Another of these damned Mus-
keteer plays,” said the Bart. ;
“I’m off!” And he went.
I am not sure that, even in Eng-
lish, it would have been just the
play for his taste; but that London
has plenty of people who can ap-
preciate it may be seen by the way
in which Mr. Lora.INE can hold
the great auditorium under the
spell of its romance. Without an
effort he endears to us the defects
of his hero's Quixotic qualities, and
makes his very deformity contri-
bute to the triumph of his heroic
panache. Even such of the poet's
prolixities as survive a very careful
pruning of the text are made to
seem essential to the self-expres-
sion of character.
Mr. LoRAINE is happy in his
book, for the clever rendering
made by Miss GLADYs Thomas and
Miss MARY GUILLEMARD reproduces

whirl of ecstasy 2 How can one

But then why should I think?
Why use my brain at all when all

Goodness, how my poor head reels.
If only I could sleep. Ah, yes,
that is what I could almost wish

But it is not to be ; the house is
just a great tearing pandemonium

for the body of Christian' or the soul
which she imagined it to contain; but
she was always a gracious figure and
her voice was gentle. Perhaps Mr.

who gave of their best. There was at-

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Books dealing with life at the Front have naturally
somewhat slackened in volume of late. Perhaps this
accounts for some part of my interest in Pushed and the
Return Push (BLACKwooD). But more must be put down
to the lure of the subject, and most of all to the admirable
way in which the writer, who chooses to be known as
“QUEx,” has dealt with it. Briefly, the book is a record
of the two great sensational movements of 1918, and of the
writer's experiences as an officer of an Artillery Brigade in
the retreat forced upon the Fifth Army by the break through
of the Germans on March 21st, and subsequently in the
return push which broke the Hindenburg Line and ended
the War. The publishers say that this is the only account
yet written by a participator in these happenings; I hardly
think that any will appear more vivid and moving. The
amazing sequence of the events with which it deals gives
to the book the thrill of arranged drama, in which disaster
is balanced by the triumphant ending. However unskil-
fully told, such a history could hardly fail of its effect; by
good fortune, however, it finds in “QUEx" a chronicler able
| to do it justice. Simply and without apparent effort he con-
veys the suspense of the days before the attack (a couple of
chapters here are as breathlessly exciting as anything that
I have yet read in the literature of the War), the long trial
of the retreat, and finally the retaliation and the ever-
quickening rush forward from victory to victory that makes
last autumn seem like an age of miracles. It is essentially
a soldier's story, at times technical, throughout filled with
the unflurried all-in-the-day's-work philosophy that upheld
our armies in every change of fortune. For many reasons
a volume that should find its place in any collection of the
smaller histories of the Great War.
Until I had very nearly reached the end of The Cormorant
(MELRose) I could not, though I tried, make up my mind
as to which of three possible claimants was filling the
title-róle. When I did discover the “Cormorant's "identity
with a fourth person quite unsuspected, I found myself just
a little inclined to wonder whether perhaps the authoress
had not had the mystification of her readers as her real aim
when she chose her title, and merely introduced a pleasant
American, who called people names with a sincerity few of
us would dare to imitate, in order to justify her choice. But
all the same I am not going to tell her secret here, for I
feel that much will be added to the interest of a very plea-
sant book if readers will pause long enough at the end of
chapter sixteen to try to “spot” the “Cormorant” and—as I
hope and believe—guess wrong. Miss ANN (or ANNE, for
her publishers seem to be in two minds about it) WEAver
has compounded her tale from the somewhat ordinary in-
gredients of a heroine, as aggressively red-haired as only
red-haired heroines can be; a philandering but finally faith-
ful hero; a worthless but charming married man, and a
number of less important people, many of whom are well
drawn, though I think that I have met that scheming and
malicious French maid before. The Cormorant's lines are
chiefly laid in country houses of the more delightful sort and
the story is well told. When Miss WEAver invents a more
distinguished plot she should do something very good indeed.

Anymoon consoling himself with the reflection that if he
was a failure as CROMWELL he can at least be a success as
General Monk. Perhaps the wilder critics of the present
order have no reason to complain if their impatient generali-
sations are marshalled, however disingenuously, against
them. But the judicious folk of every school who are now
trying to take their bearings may wonder if much is to be
gained by putting up and knocking down such flimsy figures
of straw. Mr. HARold Cox contributes a rather too solemn
preface, which labels this otherwise irresponsible novel as a
serious tract. I rather think that the engaging spectacle of
In The Thunderbolt (UNWIN) Georgina Bonham, at home
and amongst her intimates, delighted in small-talk. It
flowed in an unceasing stream, particularly when Dr.
Rayke, her chief adviser and confidant, came to tea and ate
his favourite currant-and-sultana cake. Everything, in fact,
prepares you for one of the tamest of all tame novels, when
suddenly the “Thunderbolt" of the title remembers its
attributes and bursts from a clear sky. Thenceforward
Mr. GEORGE Colmore's book is of a particularly painful
character. For the horrors which here accumulate on
horror's head I find no adequate excuse, even though the
villain of the story is a German.
Blanche Maddison, the heroine of The Obstimate Lady
(HUTCHINSON), might without any excess of rudeness be
called pig-headed. With her case in my mind let me advise

also to construct it irre-

as Miss Jessie, who goes about doing good, and producing
incidentally the most benevolent reactions in confirmed
misanthropes, demands to be handled with the nicest care
if sentimentality is to be avoided. Let me put it that Miss
TURNBULL has not always been entirely successful in this
respect. Thus, despite some agreeable scenes, the book
remains one for the unsophisticated, or for those whose
appetite for fictional glucose is robust. There is not very
much that can be called plot; what there is concerns itself
with the fortunes of Miss Jessie's tenants, the chief objects
of her ministrations. In the end an air-raid, of which the
details are surely unusual, provides Miss Jessie with the
opportunity for a deed of heroism that I am still trying to
visualize (her nephew had thrown her down and was pro-
tecting her body with his own; but the heroine, seeing this,
changed places with her defender “between the flash of the
shell's impact and the explosion") and finishes, with an
appropriately tearful death-scene, a tale that would have
been improved by more restraint in the telling.

Doll Brackett was a beautiful American girl, and if she had
not been idiotically idolised by her mother and could have
realised the difference between pounds and pence she
might have made an excellent wife for George March, of

actively hostile to this marriage, but after losing her for-
tune she began to disapprove of the economy which March
preached and tried in vain to practise. Persuaded that her
idol was no longer becomingly enshrined, she proceeded to
make trouble between husband and wife, and they separated.
Then followed a very lean time both for Mrs. Brackett and
her daughter, until at last the former made such an out-
rageous proposal that Doll came to her senses. You will
easily believe that this sort of subject offers no very
favourable outlet for Mr. CAINE's particular gifts, but the
confidential style in which he tells the story is distinctly
engaging, and as a warning to foolish mothers-in-law it is

A SPRING IDYLL.
IF wound stripes were given to sol-
diers on becoming casualties to Cupid's
archery barrage, Ronnie Morgan's sleeve
would be stiff with gilt embroidery.
The spring offensive claimed him as an
early victim. When he became an ex-
tensive purchaser of drab segments of
fossilized soap, bottles of sticky brillian-
time with a chemical odour, and post-
cards worked with polychromatic silk,
the billet began to make inquiries.
“It's that little mam'zelle at the
shop in the Rue de la République,”
reported Jim Brown. “He spends all
his pay and as much as he can borrow
of mine to get excuses for speaking to
her.” -
There was a period of regular visits
and intense literary activity on the part
of Ronnie, followed by the sudden dis-
appearance of Mam'zelle and an en-
deavour by the disconsolate swain to
liquidate his debts in kind. .
“I owe you seven francs, Jim,” said
he. “If you give me another three
francs and I give you two bottles of
brilliantine and a cake of vanilla-
flavoured soap we'll be straight.”
“Not me!” said Jim firmly. “I’ve
no wish to be a scented fly-paper. Have
you frightened her away ?”
“She's been swept away on a flood
of my eloquence,” said Ronnie sadly.
“But in the wrong direction; and
after 1'd bought enough pomatum from
her to grease the keel of a battleship,
and enough soap to wash it all off
again. Good soap it is too, me lad;
lathers well if you soak it in hot water
overnight.” -
“How did you come to lose her?”
asked Jim, steering the conversation
out of commercial channels. ... i
“The loss is hers,” said Ronnie; “I
wore holes in my tunicºleaning over
the counter talking to her, and I made
about as much progress as a Peace
Conference. I got soap instead of
sympathy and scent instead of senti-
ment. However, she must have got
used to me, because one day she asked
if I would translate an English letter
she'd received into French.
“‘Now's your chance to make good,'
I thought, language being my strong
suit; but I felt sick when I found it
was a love-letter from a presumptuous
blighter at Calais, who signed himself
‘Your devoted Horace.' Still, to make
another opportunity of talking to her,
I offered to write it out in French. She
sold me a block of letter-paper for the
purpose, and I went home and wrote a
lifelike translation.
“She gave me a dazzling smile and
warm welcome when I took it in, but
on the balance 1 didn't feel that I'd
done myself much good. And next day
I'm dashed if she didn't give me
another letter to translate, this time
signed ‘Your loving Herbert.” Herbert,
I discovered, was a sapper who'd been
transferred to Boulogne and, judging
by his hand, was better with a shovel
than a pen. As an amateur in style I
couldn't translate his drivel word for
word. Like Cyrano, the artist in me
rose supreme, and I manicured and
curled his letter, painted and em-
broidered it, and nearly finished by
signing ‘Ronnie' instead of ‘Herbert.'
“She was quite surprised when she
read the translation.
“‘C'est gentil, n'est-ce-pas ?' said
she, kissing it and stuffing it away in
her belt.
on in French, “that the dear stupid
'Erbert had so much eloquence.' I
saw my error. I had made a probable
of a horse that hadn't previously got
an earthly. So, to adjust things, I
refrigerated the next letter— which
happened to be from 'Orace—to the
temperature of codfish on an ice block.
And the consequence was that Georgette
sulked and would scarcely speak to me
for three whole days,
“The situation, coldly reviewed, ap-
peared to be like this. When 'Orace
or 'Erbert pleased her I got a share of
the sunshine, but when their love-
making cooled her displeasure was
visited on poor Ronnie. Any advances
on my own part were countered with
sales of soap, customers apparently
being rarer than lovers. So I had to
bide my time.
“But one day letters from 'Orace
and 'Erbert arrived simultaneously, and
were duly handed to the fourth party
for necessary action. It occurred to
me that when the time came for me
to enter the race on my own behalf
I need have little fear of 'Erbert as a
rival, so I determined to cut 'Orace out
of the running. -
“I translated his letter first. I cen-
sored the tender parts, spun out the
padding and served it up like cold-hash.
Then I set to work on 'Erbert. I got
the tremolo stop out and the soft pedal
on and made a symphony of it. I made
it a stream of trickling melody—blue
skies, yellow sunshine and scent of
roses, with Georgette perched like a
sugar goddess on a silver cloud and
'Erbert trying to clamber up to her on
a silk ladder. To read it would have
made a Frenchman proud of his own
language. Then, for dramatic effect, I
took the letters, put them on the counter
and walked out without a word. “That,’
thought I, ‘will do 'Orace's business—
and then for 'Erbert " '
“Next day, when I went to see the
result, to my surprise I found that her
“I did not think,’ she went ||

that little red-haired Célestine.
“‘Where's Georgette?’ said I.
“Ah, M'sieur, she has gone,’ said
Célestine. “Figure to yourself, this
'Orace, who used to write with ardour
and spirit, sent her yesterday a poor
pitiful note. It made one's heart bleed
to read it, such halting appeal, such
inarticulate sentiment. “Le pauvre gar-
çon 1" cried Georgette, “his passion is
so strong he cannot find words for it.
He is stricken dumb with excess of
feeling. I must be at his side to com-
fort him.” And she has flown like the
wind to Calais, that she may be affianced
to him. But if M'sieur desires to buy
the soap I know the kind you prefer.’
“So you see me,” concluded Ronnie
plaintively, “bankrupt in love and
money. Three francs, Jim, and I'll
chuck in a packet of post-cards.”

DEAREST DAPHNE,-Already every-
one's got peace-strain and what state
we shall all be in by the time it's actually
signed I haven't the dimmest. People
have their own ideas of how they mean
to celebrate it, and when they find that
other people have the same ideas and
mean to do the same things at the same
time there are alarums and excursions,
and things are said, and quite several
people who were dear friends during
the War don't speak now owing to the
peace'
I’ar eremple, marches and proces-
sions being so much in the air, I'd
planned a lovely Procession of Knitters;
two enormous gilt knitting-needles to
be carried by the leaders and a banner
with “We Knitted our Way to Victory!”
and myself on a triumphal car dressed
in white silk-knitting. And then, just
as everything was being arranged at
our “Knitters' Peace Procession” com-
mittee meetings, I found that Beryl
Clarges had stolen my idea and was
arranging a “Crochet Peace Proces-
sion,” with an immense gilt crochet-
hook to be carried in front, and a banner
with some nonsense about crochet on it,
and herself on a triumphal car dressed
in crochet !
I said exactly what I thought before
I left off speaking to her.
Then, again, everyone wants to give
a dance on peace night. I'd settled to
give a big affair with some perfectly
new departures, and all the nicest peo-
ple I wanted have said, “Sorry, dearest,
but I'm giving one myself that night.”
I've no patience with the silliness and
selfishness of everybody.
Talking of dances, one's getting a
bit dégoûtée of Jazz bands and steps.
When ces autres get hold of anything
it always begins to leave off being
amusing. There's really a new step,
however, the Peace Leap, that hasn't
yet been quite usé and spoilt by the
outlying tribes. The origin of it was a
little funny. Chippy Havilland was at
one of Kickshaw's Jazz dinners one
night, where people fly out of their
seats to one-step and two-step between
the courses and during the courses and
all the time. Well, while Chippy was
eating his fish the band struck up that
catchy Jazz-stagger, “She's corns on
her toes,” and Chippy, his mouth full
of fish, jumped up and began to dance.
Of course several fish-bones flew down
his throat, and while he was choking
he did such fearful and wonderful
things that the whole room, not dream-
ing the poor dear was at his dernier
soupir, broke out clapping and shout-
ing and then imitated him, and by the
time Chippy felt better he found him-
self famous and everybody doing the
Peace Leap, which has completely cut
out the Jazz-stagger, the Wolf's Prowl
and everything else.
Oh, my dearest, who do you think
are among the crowd of married people

dissolving partnership? The Algy

rationed). Seriously, though, m'amie,
I believe they'd scarcely anything be-
yond his two thousand pounds a year
as Permanent Irremovable Assistant
Under-Secretary at the No-Use-Com-
ing-Here Office. Certainly an “official
residence” and a staff of servants were
allowed 'em, but when poor Lallie
asked to have a ball-room built, and
Algy said he simply must have a bil-
liard-room and smoke-room added, one
of those fearful red-flag creatures got
up in the House just as the money was
going to be voted and made such an
uproar that the matter was dropped.
And then, having heaps of spare time
at the No-Use-Coming-Here Office,
Algy began to write novels and found
himself at once. You've read some of
them, of course? Life with a big L,
my dear. Every kind of world while
you wait, the upper, the under, and the
half. Lallie was very glad of the
money that came rolling in, but I
believe she said wistfully, “How does
my gentle quiet Algy know so much
about this, that and the other?” And
her gentle quiet Algy made answer:
“Intuition, dear; imagination; the
novelist's temperament.”
By-and-by, however, she began to
hear of his being seen at the Umpty
Club and Gaston's, chatting with Pearl
Preston (one of those people, you know,
Daphne, who 're immensely talked
about but never mentioned). And then
a “certain liveliness” set in at the
official residence of the Permanent Irre-
movable Assistant Under-Secretary.
“You silly little goosey !” said Algy;
“ don't you see that it's not as a man
who admires her but as a novelist
who's studying her that I talk to
Pearl Preston 2 She's my next heroine.
A heroine like that is a sine quá nom in
a novel of the Modernist school.”
But Lallie couldn't see the dif be-
tween a man and a novelist, and Algy
couldn't write his best seller without
studying its heroine, and so—and so
—at last our poor prize couple are in
that long list that an overworked judge
complained of the other day. And if
you ask for the moral I suppose it's
“Don’t try to study character where
there isn't any.”
This is emphatically a season for
arms, my Daphne, which seems quite
a good little idea for peace-time! Faces
and figures don't count; it's the arm,
the whole arm and nothing but the arm!
There are all sorts of stunts for attract-
ing attention to round white arms, and

MURMAN AMENITIES.
This was to have been an essay from
an igloo, describing the awful privations
of the writer and the primitive savagery
of his surroundings on the Murman
coast. It was to have wrung the sym-
pathetic heart of the public and at the
same time to have enthralled the student
of barbaric life with its wealth of exotic
detail. While embodying all the best-
known newspaper clichés appropriated
within the Arctic Circle was an unfair
test of our fortitude. Why had not the
War Office or some newspaper corre-
spondent warned us?
Madame, however, proved to have a
sense of proportion or humour; or per-
haps the collection was not her own.
In any case she showed no reluctance to
displace family photographs or china
dogs, and rapidly had the room cleared
for action; so that now, when we roll
about the floor in friendly struggle, it is
tating the sounds we make under the
impression that they are learning a
little English.
More difficult problems arise, how-
ever, regarding questions of military
etiquette. Not King's Regulations, nor
Military Law, nor any handbook de-
votes even a sub-paragraph to light
and leading upon certain points which
we have here to consider every day.
For example, if a subaltern glissading
on ski down the village street, main-
to these latitudes it was to
have included others speci-
ally and laboriously pre-
pared after a fascinating
study of Arctic literature.
But circumstances have
blighted its early inspira-
tion, and the article it was
to have been will never be
written, the telling word-
pictures designed on board
the transport never exe-
cuted.
Figure the disgust of five
adventurers who, landing at
the Murman base, sternly
braced to encounter the
last extremity of peril and
of hardship, to sleep in the
snow and dig one another
out o' mornings, to give the
weakest of their number the
warmest icicle to suck, the
longest candle to chew—
found themselves billeted
in a room which the land-
ladies of home would de-
light to advertise ! Its walls
were hung with such pictures
as give cheap lodgings half
their horror; it was encum-
bered with countless frail
chairs and “kiggly” tables,
and upon every flat surface
had settled a swarm of al-
bums, framed photographs,
china dogs, wax flowers,
penholder-stands, and all
the choicest by-products of
civilization struggling to-
wards culture. As we were

taining his precarious bal-
ance by the aid of a “stick”
in each hand, meets a Gen-
eral, also on ski and also a
novice, what should hap-
pen? What does happen
we know by demonstration:
the subaltern brandishes
both sticks round his head,
slides forward five yards,
smartly crosses the points
of his ski and then, plung-
ing forward, buries his head
in the wayside drift, while
the General Officer sits down
and says what he thinks.
But we do not know if these
gestures of natural courtesy
are such as our mentors
would approve. No au-
thority has set up for us
any ideal in such matters.
From official rules of de-
portment the British soldier
knows how to salute when
on foot or mounted on bi-
cycle, horse, mule, camel,
elephant, motor - lorry or
yak, but no provision has
been made for the case of
an army scooting on ski.
So here we are at large in
the Arctic Circle, coping
with new conditions by the
light of nature, and pay-
ing such perilous “compli-
ments” to senior officers as
our innate courtesy and
sense of balance suggest
and permit.
Further, consider the
question of dress. Even
the gunners, who in the late
by Bolshies, we might reasonably have
expected to be asphyxiated by the Rus-
sian stove; but even this consolation
was denied us, since Madame, convinced
that the English are mad in their love
of fresh air, consentcd to leave it unlit.
When first we arrived, five large
soldiers with five large kits, the aspect
of the room filled us with terror. The
fiercest frost or foe we could have faced,
but the bravest man may quail before
wax-flowers and fragile tables top-heavy
with ornaments and knick-knacks, and
all felt that to encounter such things
only someone's toilet tackle that crashes
with its spidery table, instead of cher-
ished artificial fauna and flora.
Thanks to our serviceable and becom-
ing Arctic kit and the steady approach
of the Spring thaw, heralded by the
preparation of spare bridges to replace
the existing ones, we can defy the
eccentricities of the climate. Even the
language begins to reveal what might
be termed hand-holds; though possibly,
when the natives echo our words of
greeting, painfully acquired from text-
books on Russian, they are simply imi-
war used to wear riding-breeches of their
favourite colour, no matter what it
was, the kind of footgear they most
fancied, and any old variety of hat they
thought becoming, are shocked by the
fantastic kit that is countenanced in
this latitude. It must be borne in
mind that most of us are old cam-
paigners and old nomads whose tailors
have grown accustomed to build us ap-
propriate gear for various climes. Fash-
ions for fighting in France, in Egypt, in
Mesopotamia, have gained a hold upon
our affections, to say nothing of those

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TREACHEROUS SON.
I cBRTAINLY hoped when I took up my quarters in this
quiet village that there would be no jarring note to disturb
the idyllic peace of my surroundings. And yet I had not
been long in this pleasant sitting-room, with its outlook on
blossom-laden fruit-trees, creamy-spired chestnuts and
wooded down, before I became aware that a pitiful and
rather sordid little domestic drama was in progress within
fifty yards from my open windows. I discovered a son in
the act of encouraging his aged and apparently imbecile
parent to gamble with a professional swindler! Not that
I have actually seen them thus engaged. As a matter of
fact I have merely heard a few short remarks—and those
were all spoken by the son. But, as everyone knows, even
a single sentence accidentally overheard by an observant
stranger may give him a clearer insight into the unknown,
and possibly unseen, speaker's character than could be
gained from countless chapters of a modern analytical novel.
So these four sentences were quite enough for me. Per-
haps I should mention here that the three personages in
this drama are birds—which makes it all the more painful.
Like many of our British birds, the sole speaker occa-
sionally drops into English, or I should never have under-
stood what was going on. He may be a blackbird or
thrush, but I doubt it, because I know all their remarks,
while his are new to me. If A. A. M. heard them he would
probably tell me they were those of a “Blackman's War-
bler,” and I should have believed him—once. Hardly now,
after he has so airily exposed his title as an authority; but
even as it is I should not dream of questioning his state-
ment that “the egg of course is rather more speckled,” be-
cause I can well believe that the egg this bird—whatever
he is—came from was very badly speckled indeed.
It seems that, some time ago—I can't say when exactly,
but it was before I came down here—this unnatural son
introduced to the parental abode (which I think is either
No. 5 or No. 6 in a row of young chestnuts abutting on
the high road) a rook of more than dubious reputation,
whom he persuaded his unsuspecting sire to put up for the
night. And there the rook has been ever since. As I said,
I have neither heard nor seen him, but I'm positive he 's
there. I am unable to give the precise date on which he
first led the conversation to the good old English game of
“rigging the thimble"—that also was before I came. All
I can state with certainty is that he interested his host in
it so effectually that now the infatuated old fool is playing
it all day long.
This is evident from his son's conversation; during the
pause which invariably precedes it I should undoubtedly
hear the father-bird (if he would only speak up—which he
doesn't) quavering, “I’m not sure, my boy, I'm not sure,
but I’ve a notion that, this time, he's left the pea under
the middle thimble—eh 2 ''
On which the young scoundrel, knowing well that it is
elsewhere, pipes out, “There it is, Fa-ther, there it is,
Fa-ther!” with an unctuous humility shading into im-
patient contempt that is simply indescribable, being indeed
too revolting for words.
Then, as the father still wavers, his son makes some
observations which I cannot quite follow, but take to be
on the fairness of the game as played with a sportsbird,
and the certainty that the luck must turn sooner or later.
After which he exhorts him—this time in plain English–
to “be a bird.” Whereupon the doting old parent decides
that he will be a bird and back the middle thimble, and the
next moment I hear the son exclaim, evidently referring to
the rook, “No, 'e's got it; no, 'e's got it. Cheer up ! Cheer
up!" with a perfunctory concern that is but a poor disguise
for indecent exultation. I am not suggesting, by the way,
that birds are in the habit of dropping their “h's"—but
this one does. There are times when he is so elated by
his parent's defeat that he cannot repress an outburst of
inarticulate devilry. And so the game goes on, minute
after minute, hour after hour, every day from dawn to dusk.
The amount of grains or grubs or whatever the stakes may
be (and it is not likely that any rook would play for love),
that that old idiot must have lost even since I have been
here, is beyond all calculation. He has never once been
allowed to spot the right thimble, but he will go on. As
to the son's motive in permitting it, any bird of the world
would tell you that, if you possess a senile parent who is
bound to be rooked by somebody, it had better be by a
person with whom you can come to a previous arrangement.
Now I come to think of it, though, I have not heard the
unnatural offspring once since I sat down to write this. Can
it have dawned at last upon his parent that this is one of
those little games where the odds are a trifle too heavy in
favour of the Table? Or can the son have sickened of his
own villainy and washed his claws of his shady confederate?
I don't know why, but I am almost beginning to hope .
No ; through the open window comes the well-known cry,
“There it is, Fa-ther | There it is, Fa-ther l Be a bird'
Bé a bird ' . . . No, 'e's got it! No,'e's got it! Cheer
up! Cheer up !” They are at it again! F. A.
A SHADY TENANT.
[From inquiries made by a Daily Chronicle representative it
appears that the present demand for housing accommodation is such
that people no longer draw the line at ghosts.]
THE problem at last is a thing of the past;
Doubts and fears, Geraldine, are at rest;
We can put up the banns and make definite plans,
For the love-birds will soon have a nest.
I’ve inspected, my sweet, the sequestered retreat
In which we are destined to dwell,
And on thinking things out I have not the least doubt
It will suit us exceedingly well.
There are drawbacks, I grant, but one nowadays can't
Have perfection, as you are aware,
And I'm sure you won't grouse when I state that the
house -
Is both damp and in need of repair.
I might add there's a floor that shows traces of gore;
I discovered the latter to be
That of one Lady Jane, who was brutally slain
By her husband in Sixteen-Two-Three.
Years have passed since the time of that dastardly
Crime,
But the victim's intangible shade
Can be seen to this day, so the villagers say,
In diaphanous garments arrayed.
In the gloom of the room where she met with her
doom
She's appearing once nightly, it seems,
And the listener quails as lugubrious wails
Are succeeded by agonised screams.
But the trivial flaws I have mentioned need cause
No concern; I am certain that you
Will approve of my choice, Geraldine, and rejoice
In the thought that our haven's in view.
In the likely event of your mother's descent
There's the warmest of welcomes in store,
And a rug I'll provide for her bedroom, to hide
That indelible stain on the floor.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 19th-The coalminers
lately received concessions in wages
and hours that are going to cost the
country twenty millions sterling in the
resent financial year. The first result of
this boon (teste Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES)
is that they are turning out less coal
per man than ever, and that the un-
happy consumer must look forward to
a further reduction in his already
meagre ration. It is rather hard upon
Mr. SMILLIE, who daily dilates in the
Coal Commission upon the hardships
of the miner's life, that his clients
should let him down like this.
For a thorough-going democrat com-
mend me to Lieutenant-Commander
KENworTHY, the new Member for Cen-
tral Hull, whose latest idea is that
before British troops are sent to any
new front the approval of the House
of Commons should be obtained. I sus-
pect that if, during his active-service
days, some Member had proposed a
similar restriction on the movements of
the Fleet the comments of the gallant
Commander himself would have been
more pithy than Parliamentary. -
The number of motor-cars at the dis-
posal of the Air Ministry now stands at
the apparently irreducible minimum of
forty-two. Quite a number of the officials
use train or bus, like ordinary folk;
some have even been seen to walk;
and there has been such a slump in
“joy-riding” that when asked if ladies
were now carried in the official chariots
General SEELY was able to assure
the House that that never happens;
though I think he added under his
breath—“well, hardly ever.”
There was barely a quorum when
Colonel LESLIE WILSON rose to in-
troduce the estimates of the Ship-
ping Controller. This was a pity,
for he had a good story to tell of
the mercantile marine, and told it
very well. He was less successful
on the subject of the “national
shipyards,” which have cost four
millions of money and in two years
a single completed ship. With the
wisdom that comes after the event
Sir CHARLEs HENRY fulminated
ferociously against the “superman"
who had imposed this “disastrous
scheme" upon the country.
This brought up the superman
himself, Sir ERIC GEDDEs, who in
the most vigorous speech he has
yet delivered in the House defended
the scheme as being absolutely
essential at the time it was initi-
ated. It was a war-time expedient,
which changing circumstances had
rendered unnecessary; but if the

THE LONG PULL.
MR. Rob ERTS RESPONDS TO HIS COUNTRY'S CALL.
ISTER, gracefully swallowed Lord BEAU-
CHAMP's Bill. He took occasion, how-
ever, to warn the prospective justicesses
(if that is the right term) that, as the
Commissions of the Peace were already
fully manned, it might be some time
before any large number of ladies could
be added to the roll of those who, in the
words of the Prayer-book, “indifferently
administer justice.”
Quite unintentionally, of course, Mr.
BottomLEY did the Government a real
service in the Commons. Every day
since his return from Paris Mr. BonAR
LAw has been pestered with inquiries
as to when, if ever, the House was to
be allowed to discuss the Peace terms,
and has evaded a direct answer with
more or less ingenuity. This afternoon
Mr. BottomLEY, after hearing that the
LEADER OF THE House had “nothing
to add " to his previous replies, asked
if he was right in supposing that, when
the Treaty came up for ratification, the
House must take it or leave it, and
would have no power to amend it in
any respect. Mr. LAw joyfully jumped
at the chance of ending the daily cate-
chism once for all. “That,” he said,'
“exactly represents the position, and
I do not see in what other way any
Treaty could ever be arranged.”
In anticipation of the debate on the
Finance Bill Mr. SYDNEY ARNOLD
sought an admission from the CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER that the in-
come-tax on small incomes was hardly
worth retaining, owing to the cost of
collection. Not at all, said Mr. CHAM-
BERLAIN. It costs six hundred
thousand pounds and brings in
eight million. Of course, he added,
it costs more proportionately to
collect small amounts than large.
If the whole of the income-tax
could be paid by one individual the
cost of collection would be mil.
One imagined the CHANCELLoR on
the eve of the Budget wishing, d la
NERO, that the whole of the British
people had but one purse, into
which he could dip as deeply and
as often as he pleased.
The debate on the Finance Bill
was largely devoted to the proposed
“levy on capital,” which a section
| of the “Wee Frees,” who already
display fissiparous tendencies, have
borrowed from the Labourites.
After their amendment was framed,
however, Mr. Asquith spoke at
Newcastle, and ostentatiously re-
fused to say a word about the new
nostrum. Sir DoNALD MACLEAN,
anxious to avoid displeasing either
his old leader or his new supporters,
contented himself with the sugges-
tion that a Commission should be
set up to consider the subject.

might, indeed, have contented himself
with quoting the War Bond advertise-
ments, which daily inform us that the
patriotic investor “will receive the
whole of his money back with a sub-
stantial premium.”
The Preference proposals which Mr.
AcLAND had described as bred “by Filial
Piety out of the Board of Trade” re-
ceived the unexpected aid of Sir ALFRED
Mond, who disposed of his Cobdenite
prejudices as easily as the conjurer
swallows his gloves, and unblushingly
asserted that the tiny Preference now
proposed, far from being the advance-
guard of Protection, was in reality a
very strong movement towards Free
Trade. Comforted by this authoritative
declaration Coalition Liberals helped
the Government to defeat the amend-
ment by 317 to 72.
Wednesday, May 21st.—The Peers
being as usual rather short of work at
this period of the Session, the Lord
CHANCELLoR introduced a Bill “to en-
able the Official Solicitor for the time
being to exercise powers and duties
conferred on the person holding the
office of Official Solicitor.”
The rumours that have lately ap-
peared in the papers, to the effect that
the FIRST CoMMIssion ER of WoRKS
was contemplating revolutionary alter-
ations at Hampton Court—in particular
that he was going to transform the
famous pond-garden into something
quite different: a Mond-garden, in fact
—are, it seems, grossly exaggerated.
All that he has done is to appoint a
Committee of experts to advise him
what, if any, changes are desirable.
The resumed debate on the Finance
Bill was enlivened by some personal
details. By way of showing that even
without a levy on capital the rich man
bears his share of the burdens of the
State, Sir Edward CARSON remarked
that, when he receives a retainer, he
immediately allows for the super-tax
and enters it in his fee-book at only
half the amount. He had had one
that very morning. “Say it was ſive
pounds” — and the House laughed
loudly at such an absurd supposition.
Then we had Lord HUGH CECIL
pointing his argument that the import-
ance of the proposed Preference to the
Dominions was political rather than
economical by the remark that if he
was going to be married—which he
fervently hoped would not happen to
him—he would expect his mythical
bride to value his engagement-ring less
for its pecuniary than its sentimental
value.
A capital speech by Mr. STANLEY
BALDw1N, one of the few men in the
House who talks finance as if he really
understood it, wound up the debate,
and procured the Finance Bill a second
reading mem. com.
Thursday, May 22nd.—The Ministry
of Health Bill came up for third read-
ing in the Lords. An eleventh-hour
attempt by the Government to provide
the new Minister with an additional
Under-Secretary was heavily defeated,
Lord DownHAM being appropriately
enough one of the Tellers for the
Opposition.
The Commons heard some good news.
Mr. RENDALL's pathetic story of an
angling-party which, after walking
five miles along a dusty road to its fav-
ourite hostelry, found it adorned with
the now too frequent notice, “Closed—
No Beer,” brought a most sympathetic
reply from Mr. GEORGE Roberts, who
boldly confessed, “I am a believer in
good beer myself,” and later on an-
nounced that the Government had
decided to increase the output from
twenty million to twenty-six million
standard barrels.

I suppose You 'LL BE THINKING OF TAKING To work Now?"
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
THE original answer to the question
at the head of these insignificant re-
marks was (correct me if I am wrong)
nothing. “A rose,” said Juliet, “by
any other name would smell as sweet.”
But of course she was wrong. If a
rose were handed to a visitor in the
garden, with the words, “Do see how
wonderful this onion is 1" such a pre-
judice would be set up as fatally to
| impair its fragrance. There is, in fact,
much in a name; and therefore the
attempt of a correspondent of The
Daily Earpress to find a generic nomen-
clature for domestic servants should be
given very serious attention ; the pur-
pose being to meet “the objection felt
by so many women servants to being
either called by Christian or surname.”
As a means of placating this very sen-
sitive class the correspondent writes:—
“One nearly always calls a cook by
the name of her calling. I therefore
suggest that a name be adopted be-
ginning with the first letter of the class.
For example:—
Lady's-maid . Louise.
Parlourmaid . Palmer.
Housemaid . . Hannah.
General . - . Gertrude.
Scullerymaid . . Sarah.”
Here we have materials for a sweep-
ing innovation which might, if it spread,
not only simplify life but reinforce the
language. For why confine such terms
to domestic servants 2 If all parlour-
maids are to be called “Palmer,” why
not, for example, call all editors “Eddy”
(very good Eddy, or very bad Eddy,
according to taste)” And all London
County Councillors, “Elsie"?
But let us look a little narrowly at
the specimens given. “Palmer” for
“parlourmaid” is good; but “Louise"
does not reproduce the sound values of
“lady's-maid.” Some such word as
“Lais” would be better, or why not
“Lady-bird,” which combines the de-
sired similarity with the new euphemism
“home-bird,” invented to help trans-
form domestic service to a privilege and
pleasure? “Hannah" for “house-
maid” is also wrong, although for
“handmaid” it would be good. On the
analogy of “Palmer,” why not call all
housemaids “How'? or even “House”?
If American Colonels can be called
House, why not English housemaids?
For generals “Jenny” would be better
than “Gertrude"; and for scullery-
mails “Scully.” “Scully” is quite a
good name; there is a distinguished
psychologist named SULLY, and there
was an M.P. for Pontefract named
GULLY. No scullery-maid need be
offended.
It is odd how we call some persons
by their profession or calling, and others
not. We say “Doctor,” but we do not
address our gum-architect as “Dentist.”
We say “Carpenter,” but we do not
address a plumber as “Plumber.” (In-
cidentally, all plumbers might be called
Warner). We say “Gardener” and
“Coachman,” but we do not address an
advocate as “Barrister.” If we had a
definite rule everything would be simple,
but as we have not it is necessary to
find several more names. I am not at
all satisfied with The Daily Express's
test. For example, what would a second
parlour-maid be called 2 If three were
kept they might be called Palm, Palmer
and Palmist. A long vista of difficul-
ties opens.

[“Encouraged by the summer weather yester-
day, a titled lady took her tea with some friends
on the footway at Belsize Park Gardens, Hamp-
stead. Unsympathetic passers-by, however,
complained of the obstruction . . . and, follow-
ing representation to the police by the public,
the al-fresco tea-party was broken up.”—Daily
News.]
IN spite of the innate conservatism
of the police we are pleased to think
that the seeds of a happy unconven-
tionality, sown by this courageous lady
of title, have already borne fruit.
On Thursday night, about ten o'clock,
the attention of passers-by was drawn
to a four-post bed, which was being
trundled along the Strand by eight
stalwart footmen. On it reposed the
Duke of Sleepyacres. It appears that
his Grace, on return from active service,
found that the confined air of an ordin-
ary bed-room engendered insomnia. He |.
therefore conceived the idea of sleeping
in the open-air and caused his bed to
be placed in the centre of the Strand,
opposite the entrance to the Savoy
Hotel. The presence of the sleeping
nobleman might have been unnoticed,
had not Mr. SMILLIE chanced to pass
the spot on his way from dining after
a session of the Coal Commission.
His eye was immediately caught by
the ducal crest on the panels of the bed.
Suspicious that this was a dastardly
attempt on the part of a member of the
landed classes to obtain sleeping-rights
in a public thoroughfare, Mr. SMILLIE
lodged a complaint with the police, and
the Duke was removed to Bow Street.
Some mild interest has been displayed
by the public in a camp which has been
established by three subalterns in the
roadway at the corner of Charing Cross
and Northumberland Avenue. ... It is a
small and quite inconspicuous affair,
consisting merely of an army pattern
bell-tent, a camp fire and a few deck
chairs. Our representative recently
visited the occupants to ascertain the
reason for their presence. After hastily
declining an offer of a glass of E.F.C.
port, smuggled over from France, he
inquired with polite interest whether
his hosts contemplated a lengthy stay.
They replied that they did. They were
waiting for their demobilisation gratu-
ities. The locality, they added, was a
quiet one, where advancing old age
could be met in comfortable meditation.
Also the offices of Messrs. Cox, Box &
Co., the Regimental Agents, were in
convenient proximity, and the latest
news of the gratuities could be obtained
with a minimum of trouble. Up to the
present the police have not interfered
with them, apparently taking them for
workmen employed in repairing the
roadway.
AT THE PLAY.
“KISSING TIME.”
For an infrequent worshipper at the
shrine of Musical Comedy the atmo-
sphere of a first night at a new, or re-
nascent, theatre is perhaps rather too
heady. There are so many potent
vintages set on the board; so many
connoisseurs who will offer to tell you
beforehand of the merits of their favour-
ite brands. '
I confess, to my shame, that when an
actor with whose gifts I am unfamiliar
is received on his entrance with a storm
of applause, I am not prejudiced, as I
ought to be, in his favour. On the
contrary I follow his performance the
more judicially, and if I cannot find

that it corresponds to his apparent
reputation I am apt (wrongly again) to
conclude that the fault lies with him
and not with myself.
But in the case of Kissing Time, after
a rather dull First Act, during which I
kept telling myself that I was not suf-
fering from senile decay, I had to admit
that the gods were in a great measure
justified of their elect. For one thing
the authors, taking a bold and original
line (from the French), had produced a
coherent plot; and both dialogue and
lyrics were above what I understand to
be the average in this kind. One ex-
pects, of course, a little Cockney licence
—“pyjamas” rhymed with “Palmer's,”
and so on—and a certain amount of
popular banality, as in the song, “Some
Day” (rapturously approved); but there
were excellent verses on the text, “A
woman has no mercy on a man,” and,
I doubt not, much other good stuff
which I missed because Mr. Ivan
CARYLL, who conducted (and was pro-
bably thinking more of his own plea-
sant music than somebody else's words),
did not make enough allowance for my
slowness in the up-take of patter.
Mr. LESLIE HENsoN was funny, and
should be funnier still when the book
has been cut down by about an hour
and space allowed him for private de-
velopments. Miss PHYLLIs DARE was
graceful and confident. One easily
understood her popularity; but Miss
Yvon NE ARNAUD, who was a little slow
for the general pace, must, I think, be
more of an acquired taste.
Mr. ToM WALLs (very svelte in his
French uniform) did sound work, and so
did Mr. GEORGE BARRETT, a humour-
ist by gift of nature. Mr. GEORGE
GROSSMITH, who with Mr. LAURILLARD
has made out of the old Middlesex a
most attractive and spacious “Winter
Garden,” brought with him the tra-
ditions of the Gaiety, and had a warm
personal welcome. I could bear him
to be funnier than he was; but as I'm
sure that he's clever enough to be any-
thing he likes I can only assume that
he wasn't really trying.
I join everybody in wishing him good
cheer in this “garden" of his, where, if
the auguries fulfil themselves, he is not
likely, even in the dog-days, to have to
endure “the winter of our discontent.”

THE RENAISSANCE.
THE unexampled rapidity with which,
owing to the opportunities of war-time,
men in all walks of life have reached
the top of the tree in early manhood
is leading on to strange but inevitable
results. Unable to rise any higher
they are already contemplating the
heroic course of justifying their emi-
nence by starting afresh at the bottom
of the ladder. -
The crucial and classical example is,
of course, furnished by our Boy Chan-
cellor. It is an open secret that, with
that sagacious foresight which has
always characterised him, Lord BIRKEN-
HEAD recognises the impermanency of
his exalted position and is resolved
when and if he leaves the Woolsack
to resume practice as a Junior. It is
further rumoured that some of our
judges intend to follow his august ex-
ample. The atmosphere of the Bench
is not always exhilarating, and the
salary is fixed. But a self-effacing
altruism doubtless also enters into their
motives.
The impending exodus from White-
hall is another factor in the situation.
Scores of demobilised “Ministerial
angels” will soon be released, and are
meditating fresh outlets for their bene-
volent energies. Many of them are
young and some beautiful. The ro-
mance of commerce and of the stage
will prove a potent lure. Never has the
demand for an elegant deportment and
urbane manners in our great shops
and stores been more clamant; never
has the standard been higher. Our
ex-officials may have to stoop, but it
will be to conquer. We can confidently
look forward to the day when no shop
will be without its DEMosTHENEs,
ALCIBIADEs or its CICERO. Opportuni-
ties for employment on the stage are
likely to be multiplied by the alleged
intention of several actor-managers to
enter Parliament, while others, nobly
anxious to satisfy the claims of youth,
have expressed their resolve only to
appear henceforth in such subsidiary
parts as dead bodies and outside shouts.
In the domain of letters some start-
ling developments are also threatened
on similar lines. Mr. WELLs, always
remarkable for his refusal to commit
himself to any finality in the formulation
of his opinions, has, it is said, decided
to devote his talents in future exclu-
sively to the composition of educational
works in words of one syllable, and
where possible of three letters. He is
also contemplating a revised and sim-
plified edition of his nevels, beginning
with Mr. Brit Sees It Thro'. Mr.
SHAw's fresh start will be the greatest
surprise of all. He intends to go to

Eton and Oxford, and, as a don, to
combat the tide of Socialism at our
older Universities. Mr. BELLOC, it is
reported, has re-enlisted in the French
Artillery, and Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT
has accepted a commission in the
Dutch mercantile marine.
The future of Mr. Asquith has given
rise to a good deal of speculation in the
Press, but we are in a position to state
that he does not intend to re-enter
politics or to resume his practice at the
Bar, but has resolved to return to his
first love — journalism. Sport is the
only department in which the ornate
and orotund style of which Mr. Asquith
is a master is still in vogue, and the
description of classic events in classical
diction will furnish him with a con-
genial opening for the exercise of his
great literary talent.
The rumour that Mr. BALFOUR, on
his retirement from the post of Foreign
Secretary, will take up the arduous
duties of caddie-master at St. Andrew's
is not yet fully confirmed. Meanwhile
he is known to be considering the alter-
native offer of the secretaryship to the
Handel Society. In this context it is
interesting to hear that, according to a
Rotterdam agency, Sir Edward ELGAR
has just completed a series of pieces for
the mouth-organ, dedicated to Sir LEo
CHIozzA Money, which will, it is hoped,
be shortly heard in the luncheon in-
terval at the Coal Commission.

A SPORTING CHANCE.
DEAR ALEC,-Jolly glad to hear
you're coming home. I beat you after
all, though. I suppose I was looking
particularly pivotal when I saw the
D.O., because he let me through at once.
Will you go back to the Governor's
office?
Yours ever, . GARRY Norton.
DEAR GARRY,-Haven't the faintest;
but before settling down I'm going to
have a week or two, either sailing or
fishing, so as to try to shed the army
feeling, and I think you'd better come
with me. I've saved no end of shekels,
and I'm going to give old Cox a run
for his money (the bit that's mine, I
mean, that he's been keeping for me).
If you can find a likely craft, mop
her up for me, old bean, and we'll
have a hairy time somewhere on the
S.W. coast.

DEAR ALEC, I wish you'd be less
vague. What sort of a boat do you
want—schooner, yawl, cutter or spoon-
bill ? A half-decker, or the full five
quires to the ream 2 Give me definite
instructions and I'll do my best to
carry them out. I'm afraid I can't
get off, so you'll have to take someone
else, or incarnadine the seas by your-
self. Yours as ever, GARRY.
DEAR GARRY,-Sorry to hear you
can't come. Any kind of a boat that
will go without bouncing too high will
do, and if it has a rudder, a couple
of starboard tacks, bath and butler's

to wash out the memory of those nine
months at Basra last year with the

DEAR ALEC, What you want, my

you'll get one during this shortage of
residential property.
I should try fishing if I were you.
In fact I have taken a bit of water for
you in Chamshire. I haven't seen it,
but am told it's very all right and only
twenty pounds till the 10th of June.

THE NAVY AT CAMBRIDGE.
WHEN first I joined the R.N.V.
And ventured out upon the sea,
The war-tried Subs. R.N. and Looties
Who guided me about my duties
Were wont to wink and chuckle if
I found the going rather stiff;
And when, upon the Nor'-East Rough,
My legs proved scarcely firm enough
To keep me yare and head-to-wind
The very nicest of them grinned.
Now times are changed, and here I am
: Once more beside the brimming Cam,
| | Where lo, those selfsame Loots and
Subs
Whirl madly by in punts and tubs,
Which they propel by strength of will
And muscle rather more than skill.
For (if one may be fairly frank)
They barge across from bank to bank,
With zig-zag motions, in and out,
As though torpedoes were about;
Whilst I with all an expert's ease
Glide by as gaily as you please,
Or calmly, 'mid the rout of punts,
Perform accomplished super-stunts.
But do not think I jibe or jeer
However strangely they career.
In soothing accents, sweet as spice,
I offer them my best advice,
|Or deftly show them how to plant a
Propulsive pole in oozy Granta,
Observing, “If you only knew it
This is the proper way to do it; ”
Till soon each watching Looty's face
Grows full of wonder at my grace,
And daring Subs in frail Rob Roys
Attempt to imitate my poise.
O war-tried Loots and Subs. R.N.,
Thus by the Cam we meet again;
And, as in wilder sterner days,
We shared the ocean's dreary ways
In fellowship of single aim,
I never doubt we'll do the same
By sunny Cam in happier times;
And therefore, if through these my
rhymes
Some gentle banter slyly ſlits,
Forgive me, Sirs—and call it quits.

OFF AGAIN.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. E. F. BENson, seizing occasion as it flies, has given
us, in Across the Stream (MURRAY), a story on the very
topical subject of spiritualism and communication with the
dead. As a practised novelist, with a touch so sure that it
can hardly fail to adorn, he has made a tale that is interest-
ing throughout and here and there aspires to real beauty
of feeling ; though not all the writer's skill can disguise a
certain want of unity in the natural and supernatural divi-
sions of his theme. The early part of the book, which tells
of the boyhood of Archie and the attempts of his dead brother
Martin to “get through " to him, are admirably done. As
| always in these studies of happy and guarded childhood,
Mr. BENsoN is at his best, sympathetic, tender, altogether
winning. There was lung trouble in Archie's record—
Martin indeed had died of it (sometimes I wonder whether
any of Mr. BENSON's protagonists can ever be wholly
robust), and there is a genuine thrill in the scene at the
Swiss sanatorium, where the dead and living boys touch
hands over the little cache of childish treasure buried by
the former beneath a pine-tree in the garden. Later, when
Archie had recovered from his disease and grown to suitor's
estate, I could not but feel, despite the sardonically observed
figure of Helena, the detestable girl who nearly ruins him,
that the whole affair had become conventional, and by so
much lost interest for its creator. Apart, however, from the
bogie chapters of Possession (which I shall not further
indicate) the most moving scenes in this latter part are
those between Archie and his father. I have seldom known
a horrible situation handled with more delicate art; it is
for this, rather than for its slightly unconvincing devil-
ments, that I would give the book an honourable place in
the ranks of Bensonian romance. -
I quite agree with Mr. HARold BEGBIE, whose Mr. Ster-
ling Sticks it Out (HEADLEY) is a generous attempt to put
into the form of a story the case of the conscientious
objector of the finest type, that, when we are able to think
about this matter calmly, we shall have considerable mis-
givings at least about details in our treatment of this difficult
problem. I also agree that the officials of the Press Bureau
don't come at all well out of the correspondence which he
prints in his preface, and, further, that the Government
ought to have had the courage to alter the law allowing
absolute exemption rather than stretch it beyond the break-
ing point. But I emphatically dispute his assumption that
the matter was a simple one. It was not the saintly,
single-minded and sweet-natured C.O.'s of Christopher
Sterling's type that made the chief difficulty. There were
few of this literal interpretation and heroic texture. The
real difficulty was created by men of a very different char-
acter and in much greater numbers, sincere in varying
degrees, but deliberately, passionately and unscrupulously
obstructive, bent on baulking the national will and making
anything like reasonable treatment of them impossible. It
would require saints, not men, to deal without occasional
lapses from strict equity with such inſuriating folk. Mr.
BEGBIE's book is unfair in its emphasis, but it is not

fanatical or subversive, and I can see no decent reason why
it should have been banned. I certainly commend it to
the majority-minded as a wholesome corrective.
That the reviewer should finish his study of the assembled
biographies of twenty-four fallen heroes of this War with a
feeling of disappointment and some annoyance argues a
fault in the biographer or in the reviewer. I invite the
reader to be the judge between us, for The New Eliza-
bethans (LANE) must certainly be read, if only to under-
stand clearly that there is no fault in the heroes, at any
rate. Mr. E. B. Osborn describes them as “these golden
lads . . . who first conquered their easier selves and secondly
led the ancestral generations into a joyous captivity” (what-
ever that may mean), and maintains, against the father of
one of them apparently, that he is apt in the title he has
given to them and to their countless peers. I agree with the
father and think they deserve a new name of their own;
such men as the GRENFELL brothers, HUGH and JoHN
CHARITON and DONALD HANKEY did more than maintain a
guard who ought to have prevented the murder of Sonia's
august parents, and didn't. Quite early I gave up counting
how many times Sir Francis and his fair ward were set
upon, submerged, imprisoned and generally knocked about.
You never saw so convulsed a courtship; for I will no longer
conceal the fact that, when he was not more strenuously
engaged, he soon began to regard Sonia with a softening
eye. And as Sonia herself was growing up to womanhood,
or, in Mr. WATson's elegant phrase, “muliebrity claimed
her definitely"—well, he is an enviable reader for whom
the last page will hold any considerable surprise.
“ETIENNE,” in an introductory note to A Naval Lieutenant,
1914-1918 (METHUEN), gives an excellent reason for wishing
to record his impressions of the “sea affair.” He was in
H.M.S. Southampton during the earlier part of the War,
and “on all the four principal occasions when considerable
German forces were encountered in the North Sea, her guns
were in action.” Very naturally he desired to do honour to
this gallant light cruiser, and I admire prodigiously the
tradition. There is about
Dixon Scott, “the Joyous *º:
Critic,” something, I think, -º-º-º-º: º
which will be recognised as -
marking a production and
a surprise of our own gene-
ration—the “ink-slinger”
who, when it came to the
point, was found equally
reckless and brave in sling-
ing more dangerous matter.
Again, I feel that there is
needed a clearer motive than
is apparent to warrant “a
selection of the lives of
young men who have fallen
in the great war.” Selec-
tions in this instance are
more odious than com-
parisons; there should be

modest way in which he
has done it. “ETIENNE”
is not a stylist; a professor
of syntax might conceivably
be distressed by his confu-
sion of prepositions; but
apart from this detail all is
plain sailing—and fighting.
I have readno more thrilling
account of the Battle of Jut-
land than is to be found
here. The author does it
so well because he tells his
story with great simplicity
and without what I believe
he would call “windiness."
Best of all, he has a nice
sense of humour, and would
even, I believe, have dis-
covered the funny side of
Scapa, if there had been one.
“ETIENNE,” whose short
stories of naval life were
cans; and, lastly, I found in the author's prose a certain
affectation that is unworthy of the subject-matter. An
instance is the reference to HARRY BUTTERs' “joyous"
quotation of the quatrain :—
Every day that passes
Filling out the year
Leaves the wicked Kaiser
Harder up for beer.
I like the quatrain, of course; who, knowing the “Incorri-
gibles,” doesn't 2 But I did not like that reiterated word
“joyous.” -
I should certainly have supposed that recent history had
discounted popular interest in the monarchies of make-
believe; in other words, that when real sovereigns have
been behaving in so sensational a manner one might
expect a slump in counterfeits. But it appears that Mr.
H. B. MARRIOTT WATson is by no means of this opinion.
His latest story, The Pester Finger (SKEFFINGTON), shows
him as Ruritanian as ever. As usual we find that dis-
tressful country, here called Varavia, in the throes of
dynastic upheaval, which centres, in a manner also not
without precedent, in the figure of a young and beautiful
Princess. This lady, the last of her race, had been adopted as
ward—on, I thought, insufficient introduction—by the hero,
Sir Francis Wyse. The situation was further complicated by
the fact that in his youth he had been the officer of the
amusing, makes a distinct advance in this new work.

“Norman is coming to the dance,” said my wife.
“He would prefer to be shot,” I answered.
“You are coming too, and I want you to look after him.”
“I also would prefer to stop one.” -
“It will do him all the good in the world. He wants
bringing out.” - - * .
When Norman is alone with me he is natural and even
interesting at times, but in company he is shy and self-
conscious and a burden to himself and his neighbours. . He
is a young dentist with a large practice, and is already a
well-known authority on Japanese methods of extraction.
Using only his thumb and forefinger he can remove long-
established teeth with so much ease and grace and such a
quantity of sangfroid that it is a pleasure to watch him at
his work. But to a social gathering he comes limp and in-
firm of purpose; he feels constrained to utter futile remarks
with undue emphasis trailing into incoherence; he is dread-
ful to behold. -
I did not see him until the end of the second dance.
He was in the ante-room and presented a good example of
protective colouring. He was standing with his back to a
dark screen, and his pale face and light hair were indis-
tinguishable against a background of flowers worked in gold
thread. His attitude as he tightly grasped his programme
behind him was that of a wounded dove at bay.-
I signalled to him, but, although I was only a few feet
away, he could not see me. He had apparently also lost
all power of movement. I took him by the arm and led him
to the buffet, and, although he never takes alcohol, I felt
justified in forcing some brandy between his lips. This
revived him a little, and he said in a well-modulated voice:
“The surface of the floor is excellent. It is rather warm
and oppressive (or cold and chilly). I adore dancing; it
both exercises the body and refreshes the mind; but un-
fortunately I have not had many opportunities of indulging
in the art.”
I gave him some more brandy.
A little later he recognised me and smiled. I examined
his programme and found that he was engaged for the next
dance to a girl who could talk to anyone on any subject; I
could see my wife's hand in the arrangement. I explained
the situation, piloted him to his partner and stayed with
them a while. She made several openings for him in the
conversation, which he immediately sealed up with mono-
syllables, and when she allowed her fan to slip to the floor
he stepped on it. She suggested that they should take the
air on the balcony, and as I left them he pulled himself
together and began to tell her, in a well-modulated voice,
that the surface of the floor was excellent.
Later I saw him with the same partner still on the

parently never moved. They seemed to be exercising an
unconscious fascination on one another. My courage failed
me and I went elsewhere. -

[The evening papers have lately published some striking incidents.

“WE are longing for work,” said a young man who,
after suffering the horrors of war for nearly four years in
the Ministry of Superfluous Hotels and Hutments, has just
been evacuated. “We have prepared a list of billets that

PUMPEN HEIM.
WHEN Adolf Hans Pumpenheim,
farmer, was brought up for trial as a
civil offender it is not too much to say
that a shudder passed through the
members of the Summary Court, which
consisted of Major Blenkin and myself.
This emotion was due not so much
to the unprepossessing appearance of
the prisoner as to the enormity of his
offence.
He was charged upon two different
counts: firstly, with being in illegal
possession of two tins of corned beef
and one cake of soap, the property of
the British Government; secondly,
with having offered a bribe of fifty
marks to Second-Lieutenant Robinson
in order to escape arrest.
The charge was translated to the
prisoner by an interpreter, who in his
turn appeared to feel the gravity of
the occasion. He alluded with bated
breath to the topic of corned beef; he
slid, so to speak, over the soap; only
in the mention of the fifty marks did his
voice ring out confidently, as though
righteous indignation had overcome the
baser sentiment of pity, Pumpenheim
listened in silence. When invited to
plead Guilty or Not Guilty he made no
reply.
Judges are only human. I cannot
state that his innocence was presumed.
The evidence was brief. A corporal
of foot police, after examining the
articles produced in court, pronounced
them to be indubitably two tins of
corned beef and a cake of soap, and
further declared that he had found
them in the prisoner's house, no troops
being at that time billeted upon him.
Second-Lieutenant Robinson deposed
that upon his arrival the prisoner had
thrust a fifty-mark note into his hand,
accompanying the action with gestures
and grimaces suggestive of bribery.
Here we all looked at Pumpenheim.
His features afforded no sign of intel-
ligence or even of interest. For his
particular benefit the evidence was
translated. He was further invited to
question the witnesses or to call testi-
mony on his own behalf. To these
offers he responded with a shrug indi-
cating that he waived all rights.
The court was therefore cleared, and
Major Blenkin and I proceeded to con-
sider our verdict, with no other com-
pany than the dozen empty stools
which had faced us during the trial,
and which represented the inalienable
right of the civil population to attend
the court if they pleased. Custom for-
bids me to divulge the finding or the
sentence. It will suffice to say that
justice was tempered with mercy. We
were about to readmit the prisoner, his
escort and the imaginary public when
my partner in the suppression of crime
was struck by an idea.
“Look here,” asked Major Blenkin,
“what about the moral aspect?”
I hesitate to argué with Blenkin
about moral questions, on which he
speaks with authority. I therefore
awaited his next remark.
“The moral aspect,” Blenkin went
on, “is most important. I intend to
impress this fellow. I shall tell him
that if he had been a French peasant
and had offered a bribe to a German
officer he would have been put against
a wall and shot. Do you agree?”
I considered the proposition.
“No,” I said, “I don't.”
Blenkin threw me a suspicious glance.
“Why not ?” he asked.
“Too many assumptions,” I said.

Blenkin bridled indignantly. It was
on the tip of his tongue to charge me
with being a pro-German. He con-
trolled himself and rang a bell.
shall hold to my own opinion,” he re-
marked with some asperity. -
The prisoner, his escort and the in-
terpreter were marched in. Adolf Hans
Pumpenheim created the customary
diversion by turning to the right on
the command, “Left turn,” and the
sergeant - major made the customary
comments, undeterred by the prisoner's
ignorance of English. The imaginary
public filed in and occupied the vacant
stools. -
When this bustle had subsided, the
finding and the sentence were read by
Blenkin and duly translated by the in-
terpreter. Pumpenheim was quite im-
passive, and maintained his composure
throughout the small financial trans-
action which followed. He counted
out his notes with an air of fatalism.
Having obtained a receipt for the fine
he made us a little bow and turned to
leave the court.
“One moment,” said Major Blenkin.
“Einen Augenblick,” echoed the in-
terpreter. Pumpenheim faced about
and stood to attention.
Blenkin cleared his throat. “I will
not dwell upon the moral aspect of
your case,” he said. The prisoner's
features expressed neither relief nor
surprise, but polite inquiry. Blenkin,
slightly ruffled, enlarged upon the hein-
ous nature of the crime and the leniency
of the sentence. Finally he produced
his masterpiece of comparison — the
French peasant, the German officer,
the attempted bribe, the execution.
When the last grim lines of the imag-
inary history had been translated for
him, Pumpenheim felt some observa-
tion on his part to be called for.
“So-o?” he said, “so-o?”
But I heard incredulity in his voice.
Blenkin read it in his face. The pris-
oner did not believe a word of the
tale. He was indifferent to the homily.
Blenkin, defeated, leaned back in his
chair. “I give it up,” he said. “You
have a try at him.”
I looked at Pumpenheim. His nar-
row eyes turned to me.
“If you had offered the money to a
German officer,” I said, and the inter-
preter repeated the words—“if you had
offered the money to a German officer
he—might—have—taken—it.”
Slowly a look of comprehension
crossed the face of Adolf Hans Pumpen-
heim. It was like sunrise upon his
grey and stubbly countenance, where
three days' growth of beard had thriven
in the soil of the guard-room. He was
not altogether happy, for he had been
found guilty and had paid a fine. But

in the course of this ceremony, which
appeared to him mystical and obscure,
he had encountered one familiar idea,
one thought within his power of under-
standing. Rectitude was a stranger to
him, but corruption an old friend. He
was not abashed; rather, on the con-
trary, he was cheered and encouraged. I
could see that his heart warmed to me
in particular, and I believe that but for
his respect for the Court he would have
paid me the compliment of a wink.
“Let him go,” said Blenkin; and
the Court adjourned for lunch.

A few weeks ago there appeared in
Punch, under the title “A Germless
Eden,” some verses sent in by an un-
known contributor. The Editor is now
informed that the original version of
these lines was the work of Mr. ARTHUR
GUITERMAN, of New York, who pub-
lished them in 1915 with Messrs.
HARPER AND BROTHERs in The Laugh-
ing Muse, a collection of his humorous
verse. The Editor begs both author
and publishers to accept his sincere
regrets.
From a summing-up:—
“If the plaintiff was telling the truth, he had
only himself to blame."—Provincial Paper.
If judges say this sort of thing, no
wonder perjury is on the increase.

“’ERE, EASY ON A MINUTE; WE AIN'T SHOOK 'ANDS YET."
MELISANDE's POINT OF VIEW.
“ABOUT rabies,” said Angela.
“Well?” said I patiently.
“Well, about Mélisande,” said Angela.
“What about Mélisande?” I replied.
“Oh, you know quite well what about Mélisande,” said
Angela; “about her and Peggy playing so much together.
Is it quite wise, do you think? I've been bothering about
it for some days now ; cats are such queer things and a cat
with rabies would be so dreadfully dangerous.”
“There I quite agree with you,” I answered meditatively.
“Though I have rather excepted Mélisande from the gen-
eral rule I have always considered a cat an exceedingly
dangerous animal, and a cat with rabies is, of course, ten
times worse; it simply oughtn't to be allowed.”
“I felt sure you would agree with me,” said Angela.
Mélisande is a staid creature of placid demeanour and
generous proportions. It had never occurred to me hither-
to to associate her with rabies, and I still felt that she
herself would scoff at the idea.
We were gathered round the fire, my wife, my daughter
and I; Angela seated on what is known, I believe, in uphol-
stering circles as a humpty, while Peggy lay on her tummy
on the floor, pencil in hand and a sheet of paper before
her; she was chewing the pencil with the ruminating air
of one who awaits inspiration. I myself occupied the
armchair.
“You know,” said Angela presently, “I think Mélisande
has seemed worried about something the last few days. I
do hope the poor dear isn't bothering about rabies. One so
often hears of people actually producing a disease merely
by thinking a lot about it. By the way, I'm told that one
of the earliest manifestations of rabies is a desire to bite
inanimate objects; if we see her doing that we shall know
that the time has come to act.”
At this juncture Mélisande entered the room through the
open window. -
Her manner exhibited a curious blend of dignity and
caution; I could more readily have suspected my own
mother of having rabies. She advanced slowly towards us
till suddenly her eye lighted on Peggy, who still chewed
her pencil awaiting inspiration.
Mélisande stopped as though she had been shot; I could
only surmise that the sight of Peggy thus occupied had
confirmed her darkest suspicions. With one wild shriek of
terror she fled from the room.
THE NEGLECTED PROBLEMI.

There must be an answer and England should know it."

BIRD NOTES.
NATURE STUDY has recently been
recommended by a well-known Daily
Paper as a means of gradual relaxation
from war-worry. Mr. Punch would
therefore like to contribute for so noble
an end a few ornithological notes, hav-
ing for a long time been addicted to the
observation of bird-life.
CUCKoo.—This bird, which obtained
its name on account of the similarity of
its note to that of the Cuckoo-clock,
was one of the earliest sufferers of the
housing problem, which it successfully
solved by depositing its eggs in the
nests of other birds.
SEAGULL.--When the eggs of this
bird are hatched the mother-parent
feeds its young on the glutinous sub-
stance that oozes from sea - weed—
hence “Mother Seagull's Syrup.”
THROSTLE.—See THRUSH.
PIGEON.—This bird was used as a
message-carrier with great success dur-
ing the War. An attempt to cross it
with the Parrot, to enable it to deliver
verbal messages, was unfortunately a
failure. -
SPARRow.—Bird-fanciers experience
great difficulty with this bird when
kept in captivity, as it frequently de-
velops jaundice, in which case it can
only be sold under the name of “Canary,”
at a big difference in price.
GUILLEMOT.—The name “Guillemot”
is derived from the French word “Guil-
lemot,” which means a Guillemot.
LARK.—The protective instinct in this
bird is very marked. Although nesting
on the ground it soars high into the sky
for the purpose of leading aviators and
balloonists away from its young.
GoLDFINCH.—A favourite cage-bird.
The best method of catching the gold-
finch is to wait until it settles on the
lowest branch of a tree, then approach
it from behind and gently tap its right
wing with your right hand. This
causes it immediately to turn its head
to see who has touched it; you can then
bring up your left hand unnoticed, into
which it falls an easy victim. -
BULLFINCH.—Another popular cage-
bird. The best method of capturing it,
which differs widely from that in use
with the Goldfinch, is as follows:–
Hang head downwards from the fork
of an old tree in order to resemble a
dead branch, having previously covered
yourself with some adhesive matter.
In this position you should wait until
as many Bullfinches as you want have
settled on your clothes and stuck there;
then climb down from the tree and have
them scraped off into a large cage.
BARN Owl.—This bird invariably
builds its nest in empty houses. There
will be no nests this year.
STARLING.—Threepence was placed

year in many-parts of England. The
old way was to put salt on its tail.
BLUE TITMOUSE.—The nest of this
active little bird is often situated in
most extraordinary places. It is fre-
quently found inside village pumps, and
in consequence is much persecuted by
local milkmen. It is feared that unless
The Daily Mail can be persuaded to
take up the cause of this unfortunate
bird it will soon be faced with exter-
mination.

this bird and the Crow is found in the

SONGS OF SIMLA.
II.—SIMLA Sounds.
I HAVE heard the breezes rustle
O'er a precipice of pines,
And the half of a Mofussil
Shiver at a jackal's whines.
I have heard the monkeys strafing
Ere the dawn begins to glow,
And the long-tailed langur laughing
As he lopes across the snow.
I have heard the rickshaw varlets
Clear the road with raucous cries,
Coolies clad in greens or scarlets,
As a mistress may devise.
Well I know the tittle-tattle
Of the caustic muleteer,
And the Simla seismic rattle
Is familiar to my ear.
Though to-day my feet are climbing
Bleaker heights and harder roads,
Still the Christ-church bells are
chiming,
Still the mid-day gun explodes.
But the sound which echoes loudest
Is the sound I never knew
Till I lunched (the very proudest)
With the Staff at A.H.Q.
'Twas a scene of peace and plenty,
Plates a-steam and spoonsa-swoop;
'Twas a sound of five-and-twenty
Hungry Generals drinking soup.
J. M. S.
WAITING FOR THE SPARK.
(With thanks to the London Telephone
Directory.)
I Doubt if you have ever taken the
book seriously, dear reader (if any).
You dip into it for a moment, choose a
suitable quotation and scribble it down
with a blunt pencil on your blotting-
pad; then you wind the lanyard of the
listening-box round your neck and start
talking to the germ-collector in that
quiet self-assured voice which you be-
lieve spells business success. Then you
find you have got on to the Institute of
Umbrella-Fanciers instead of the In-
corporated Association of Fly-Swatters,
which you wanted, and have to begin
all over again. But that is not the way
to treat literature.
In calm hours of reflection, rather,
when the mellow sunlight streams into
the room and, instead of the dull gray
buildings opposite, you catch a mental
glimpse of green tree-tops waving in the
wind, and hear, above the rumbling of
the busy 'buses, the buzzes . . . the
bumbling . . . what I mean to say is
you ought to sit down calmly and read
the book from cover to cover, as I am
doing now.
For it isn't like a mere Street Direc-
tory, which puts all the plot into water-
tight compartments, and where possibly
all the people in Azalea Terrace know
each other by sight, even across the gap
where it says:—
Here begins Aspidistra Avenue,
like the lessons in church.
Nor, again, is it like Who's What,
where your imagination is hampered
and interfered with by other people
butting in to tell you that their re-
creations are dodging O.B.E.'s and the
Income Tax Commission. Publications:
Hanwell Men as I knew Them. Club:
The Philanderers, and so forth. This
cramps your style.
But the book before us now is preg-
nant with half-hidden romances, which
you can weave into any shape that you
will, and, what is more, it is written in
a noble beautiful English which you
have probably never had time to mas-
ter. I want you to do that now. Sup-
pose, for instance, that in private life
your hostess introduced you to Museum
88901 Wilkinson Arthur Jas.-let us
say at a Jazz tea. And suppose you
were to ask him what his business was,
and he told you that he was an Actnr
and Srvyr or a Pprhngr. Probably
you would be surprised; possibly even
you wouldn't believe him. But it's all
there in the book.
The type too is diversified by sudden
changes which intrigue me greatly.
All over London I like to fancy little
conversations of this sort are go-
ing on :-
Hop 1000 Tomkinson Edward C.—
“Hello, is that ToMKINson Edward C.?”
GERRARD 22001 Tom KINso N ED-
WARD C.—“SPEAKING."
Hop 1900 Tomkinson Edward C.—
“The Whlsl SlvrSmths 2 ”
GERRARD, ETC.—“DoN'T splvTTER
LIKE THAT. WHo ARE You ?”
Hop, etc.—“I’m Tomkinson Edward
C. too. Little Edward C. of Hop. The
Tbcnst. I only wanted to have a talk
with you, big brother.”
Or sometimes it takes the shape of a
novel, starting something like this:—
Kensington 100110 Williams Miss,
Tyst., a beautiful but penniless girl, in
love with—
Regent 8000 Air Ministry, Ext. 1009,
a young aviator who has won the
Mlty. Crss. (2 Brs). Their path is
crossed by—
City 66666 (12 lines), BLENKINsor
JEHORAM AND Co., Fnncrg. Blenkin-
sop wishes to marry Miss Williams,
on account of a large legacy which
he has reason to believe will come to
her from
Mayfair 5000 Dashwood-Jones H.
See Jones H. Dashwood, and so on.
Sometimes, again, as I plunge still
deeper into the fascinating volume, a
poem seems to fashion itself and leap
from the burning page. Listen.
She hears not Park appealing
Nor Gerrard's wail of woe,
Her heart is on to Ealing
89200;
For there her true love (smartest
Of lol plmbrs) speaks;
. For him our switch-board artist
Puts powder on her cheeks.
For him, the brave, the witty,
When evening's shadows drop
She flies from Bank and City
To tread some Western hop.
For him her spirit ranges
Through realms of blissful thrall,
And that is why Exchange is
Not getting Lndn Wll.
Little her mthr—
I'm sorry, reader; I really and truly
am. There's my trunk call ... “Hello.
No, I can't hear . . .”
We must finish it some other time,
and you must try READING THE Book
for yourself srsly please.
“Hello! Hello! Hel-lo / " . .

THE VISIONARY TRIUMPH.
“This,” he said, “is my favourite
dream.”
We were discussing our favourite
dreams and prepared to listen.
“It is always,” he went on, “the
same—a cricket match: and the older
I get and less able to play cricket, the
oftener I have it. It is a real match, you
must understand — first-class cricket,
with thousands of spectators and ex-
citement; and it is played a very long
way from my home. That is an im-
portant point, as I will explain.
“I am merely one of the spectators.
How long I have been watching I can-
not say, but the match is nearing the
end and our side—the side which has
my sympathies—is nearly all out, but
still needs a few runs to win.
“What the side is I cannot clearly
tell; all I know is that it is my own
county, I mean the county from which
I come—say Kent—and the match is at
Old Trafford or Bramall Lane, against
either Lancashire or Yorkshire. But
the important thing is that my side is
a man short. This man either has
been taken ill or has had to go away
because of a bereavement. I am not
clear as to that, but he is not there,
anyway, and unless a substitute can be
found Kent will be at a disadvantage
and may lose.”
We all got ready to say something.
“Oh, yes,” he interpolated hurriedly,
“I know, of course, that a substitute
may not bat for another at the end of a
match, but this is a dream, remember.
That, perhaps, is what dreams are for
—to provide the limited and frustrated
life of the daytime with the com-

pensations of limitless adventure and
success.”
“Order " '' we cried.
“I beg pardon,” he said, and re-
turned to the vernacular.
“Very well; that is the scenario.
Meanwhile the last two batsmen are
in–the Kent captain and another:
that is to say, the last two, unless
another is forthcoming. And still there
are six runs needed—five to tie and six
to win. The excitement is appalling.
Everyone in the vast concourse is
tense. It is at this moment that the
captain is bowled.”
He stopped to wipe his forehead.
“What happens then 2" he con-
tinued. “You would think the match
was over. So it would be on any
ordinary ground and under ordinary
conditions, and particularly so if that
umpire in the Sussex and Somerset
match the other day were officiating.
But he is not, and this is a dream.
..What happens is that the Kent captain,
instead of returning to the Pavilion,
stops and talks to the other captain
and then he leaves the pitch and begins
to walk towards the ring. When he
reaches the ring, some way from me,
he begins to ask loudly, ‘Is there a
Kent man here who can play at all
and would help us out 2' I can hear
him at first only faintly; then, as he
gets closer, I hear more clearly, 'Is
there a Kent man here who can play at
all and would help us out?' My heart
beats faster and faster and I am nearly
suffocated with suspense as he ap-
proaches, because I am a Kent man
who can bat a bit, and to play for my
county has always been my desire, and
I am afraid that someone else will volun-
teer before the captain reaches me.
“You see now why the match has
to be played so far away from home. If
it were Kent v. Middlesex at Lord's,
for example, there would be loads of
Kentish men on the ground. But not
so many up in the North.
“I always wonder why the captain
does not begin in the Pavilion, but he
does not. He comes straight to the
ring. Every moment he is drawing
nearer and no one has offered himself;
and then at last he gets to me and I
stand up and say that Kent is my
county and I can play a bit and would
like to help. He hastens to accept my
offer, and I take his bat and pads and
gloves and go to the pitch, amid the
cheers of the crowd.
“At the wicket I am received with
hearty greetings by the rival captain
(this is a dream, remember), and I take
middle. Then I look round the field
with perfect composure, as I have
always seen the best batsmen do, and
have always wanted to do myself. I am
the coolest thing there. -
“The situation is electrical. Six runs
are needed and I am the last man. The
bowler against me is a demon and 1
am dead out of practice and by no
means fond of being hit on the body.
He begins his run towards the wicket,
and the ball leaves his terrible long
swinging arm and comes towards me
like a shell. I raise my bat, get it on
the half-volley right in the middle, hit
it clean over the Pavilion for six, and
the match is won. -
“That is my favourite dream.”
“No wonder,” we said.

Business As usual.
Rolling stones like Edward Ross
Never gather any moss.
He was one of those who think it's
Easier to gather trinkets—
Silver watch or golden chain,
Purse or bag or châtelaine;
So that at the age of thirty,
Though his clothes were old and dirty,
Yet there were no flies upon
Edward, as you'll see anon.
Just before the Mons Retreat
He emerged upon the street
From His Majesty's Hotel, -
Where they'd kept him safe and well,
! Gratis. But, in spite of this, Ted
Caught the fever and enlisted.
'Twas our gallant pocket-sniper's
Fate to find himself at Wipers,
And because he showed no fear
IIe was made a pioneer.
| For the very sight of wire
Always set his soul afire
(We are bound by early habits —
It reminded him of rabbits);
If the Huns but showed an inch of it
Teddy took what he could pinch of it,
Which was all, for, as I've said, -
Flies were not at home on Ted.
Once our friend, by sad mishap,
Fell into a German sap,
And, on rising to depart,
Found a pistol at his heart.
Feeling almost at a loss, .
“Kamerad ' " said Edward Ross.
Through some miles of trench they went
Till they reached a swagger tent
Where a German General sat
In a highly polished hat
(Clearly an important man),
Studying a priceless plan.
Ted, who felt he simply hated him,
While the man interrogated him,
Quite adroitly picked the plan off
That astonished Hun and ran off.
Teddy's captor, who to stop him
Simply had to shoot and drop him,
Fired his pistol twice, but clicked it
All in vain, for Ted had picked it—
Picked the tool that looked so grim
After they had collared him, . .
While his escort dodged a dud
Outside in the Flanders mud.
For on Ross, remember, please,
Flies were always ill at ease.
But the crowning insult he
Added to the injury . . . . . .
Still remains to tell. As Teddy
Snatched the priceless plan and fled, he
Also pinched the polished hat,
Saying, as he vanished, that,
When in England far from here,
He would like a souvenir . .
Of the pleasant time he'd spent
In a German General's tent,
As a proof for English eyes
That he wasn't telling lies.
Though pursued by two or more
Furious German Army Corps
'Twere superfluous to say -
That our hero got away,
For on coves of Edward's mettle
Flies are ill-advised to settle.
“House Parlourmaid wanted; most com-
fortable home; small family; good outings;
last one 7 years."—Times.
Quite a nice little holiday.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 26th.—On the whole I
do not think that Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs,
who has now definitely succeeded Sir
ALBERT STANLEY as President of the
Board of Trade, is to be congratulated
on exchanging the academic serenity
of McGill University for the turmoil
of Whitehall (Bear) Gardens. The
modified system of Protection intro-
duced under the stress of war seems to
please nobody. While Colonel WEDG-
wood complained that the price of
gas-mantles (of which I should judge
him to be a large consumer) has gone
up owing to the prohibition of foreign
imports, others objected that licences
were issued so lavishly as to cause
British producers to be undersold in
the home-market by their American,
Japanese and Italian rivals.
To avoid treading upon any of these
varied susceptibilities the great AUCK-
LAND had to execute a sort of diplo-
matic egg-dance; but he did it with
consummate skill and temporarily satis-
fied everybody with the promise of a
full statement upon trade policy so
soon as Peace has been signed. I hope
this won't make the Germans more
dilatory than ever.
At the Press Gallery dinner the other
night the SPEAKER, who was the guest
of the evening, recalled the three golden
rules for Parliamentary orators—“Stand
up ; speak up; shut up"; and added
that while some Members paid very
little attention to the second of them
there were a few whose stentorian tones
he would like to borrow in case of a
disturbance. But really I don't think
he need worry. To dam a rising tide
of “Supplementaries” this afternoon he
called the next name on the Order-Paper;
and his crescendo effect—“Mr. Grattan
Doyle ! — Mr. Grattan Doyle !! — Mr.
GRATTAN DOYLE | | | – Mr. GRATTAN
DOYLE | | | | — could not have been
bettered by Mr. JACK Jon Es.
I hope the fighting Services are not
going to revive their pre-war jealousy
of one another. The tone in which Dr.
MACNAMARA, when somebody asked a
question about the Portsmouth “butch-
ery department,” jerked out “War
Office l" was calculated to give rise to
misapprehension.
The Ministry of Health Bill found
Mr. DEVLIN in a dilemma. He makes
it a rule never to support anything
that emanates either from the House of
Lords or from the Government. But
on this occasion his two bétes moirs
were in opposition, for the Lords had
decided that the new Minister sliould
have but one Parliamentary Secretary,
and the Government was determined
to give him two. Whichever way he
voted the Nationalist Leader was bound
to do violence to his principles. And
so, with that quick-wittedness for which
his countrymen are justly renowned,
he walked out without voting at all.
Tuesday, May 27th.-It is odd that
the House of Lords, which has done so
A DIPLOMATIC EGG-DANCE.
SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES.
much for the emancipation of women,
still refuses to allow peeresses in their
own right to take part in its debates.
They would have been very useful this
afternoon, when two Bills affecting
their sex were under discussion. An
extraordinary amount of heat was de-
veloped by the Nurses Registration Bill,
introduced by Lord Gosche N, and I am
sure some of the charming ladies in
the Strangers' Gallery must have been
longing to produce their clinical ther-
mometers and descend to the floor to
take the temperatures of the disputants.
“I WON'T SUPPORT ANYTHING."
MR. DEVLIN.
So far as one could gather, the Bill is
the outcome of a quarrel between the
College of Nurses and the rest of the
profession. Who shall decide when
nurses disagree?
In Committee on the Bill for enabling
women to become Justices of the Peace
Lord STRACHIE moved to restrict the
privilege to those who have “attained
the age of thirty years.” The LoRD
CHANCELLOR strongly resisted the limi-
|tation on the ground that the Govern-
ment are pledged to establish “equality
between the sexes.” He was supported
by Lord BEAUCHAMP, who, however,
thought it unlikely that any ladies under ||
that age would in fact be appointed. I
am not so sure. Who knows but that
some day the Woolsack may be tenanted
by a really susceptible Chancellor 2
There are limits to the credulity of the
House of Commons. Mr. BottomLEY's
assertion that many clergymen did not
know whether they might marry a
woman to her deceased husband's
brother, and had written to him for
an authoritative opinion, only excited
ribald laughter.
His inquiry whether the Recess could
start three days earlier, in order that
Members might take advantage of the
Epsom carnival to study the social
habits of the people and form an opinion
as to the possibility of raising revenue
from taxes on racing and betting, was in
better vein, and reminded old Members
of the days when Lord ELCHO (now
Lord WEMYss) used annually to delight
the House with his views on the Derby
adjournment. Entering into the spirit
of the jest, Mr. BonAR LAw replied that
he regretted that his honourable friend
should be put to inconvenience, but he
must do what we all have to do at
times, and decide whether his duty lay
at Epsom or Westminster. From Mr.
BottomLEY's rejoinder one gathered
that he had already made up his mind,
and that Epsom had it. -
Wednesday, May 28th. — Colonel
WEDGwooD's complaint that aeroplanes
were used to disperse rioters in India
was ostensibly based on the fact that,
like the gentle rain from heaven, bombs
fell alike on the just and the unjust,
but really, I fancy, on what I gather to
be his rapidly-growing belief that any
anarchist is preferable to any Govern-
ment. Mr. MonTAGU, however, declined
to interfere with the use of a weapon
which for the moment has greatly
strengthened the hands of the Indian
Administration in dealing with dis-
order, whether on the frontiers or in
the cities.
The Ministry of Labour has lately
introduced a course of domestic train-
ing for “wives and fiancées.” The in-
definiteness of the latter term offended

Captain Loseby, who wanted to know
at what exact period of “walking-out”
a lady became a fiancée. Mr. WARDLE,
although the author of a work on
“Problems of the Age,” confessed that
this one baffled him, and asked for
notice.
The recent disturbance in the neigh-
bourhood of the House by indiscreet
friends of the unemployed soldier led to
a rambling debate, chiefly remarkable
for the hard things said by and about
Mr. Hogg|E, whose aim, according to
ex-Private HoPKINSON, was to make
soldiers uncomfortable; and for a hope-
ful speech by Sir Robert HoRNE, who
said that, despite the “dole,” unem-
ployment was beginning to diminish,
and that four-fifths of the “demobbed ”
had already been reabsorbed by in-
dustry.
Then followed a lively but incon-
clusive discussion upon that hardy
annual, the alleged sale of honours.
General PAGE CROFT attributed it to
the secrecy of party funds and proudly
declared that the National Party pub-
lished all the subscriptions it received,
and heartily wished there were more
of them. The weakness of his case
and that of his supporters was that
no specific instances of corruption were
brought forward, if we may except Mr.
BottomLEY’s assertion that some years
ago he might have had a peerage if he
had paid for it.
Thursday, May 29th–A constitu-
tional crisis is impending on the ques-
tion whether the MINISTER of HEALTH
should have one Parliamentary Secre-
tary or two; the Commons demand
two ; the Lords will not allow more
than one, even though tempted by Lord
CURzoN with the bribe that the second
shall sit in the Upper House. Having
heavily defeated the Government on
this point, the Peers then decided that
Miss WIOLET Doug LAS-PENNANT was
entitled to a judicial inquiry into the
circumstances that led to her retire-
ment from the Air Force. The LoRD
CHANCELLOR opposed the proposal in a
speech described by Lord SALISBURY
as that “of an advocate rather than
a judge; ” but in spite or because of
this the Government were beaten by
69 to 20.
Somebody ought to move for a re-
turn of the amount expended by the
Government on the hire of furniture
vans since the Armistice. Sir A. MoND
stated that in order to release certain
hotels their official occupants had been
transferred to the Alexandra Palace,
while the interned aliens recently housed
in the Palace had been sent to certain
country camps, whose late occupants
(we may infer) have now gone to the
hotels. It is suggested that the Office
of Works should now be known as the
“General Post " Office.
One can easily imagine what use a
fiery demagogue would have made of
the secret circular sent out some months
ago by the War Office, instructing com-
manding officers to ascertain the atti-
tude of their men to the trade unions
in the event of a general strike. For-
tunately Mr. ADAMson is not that type
of man, and he couched his criticisms
in a vein rather of sorrow than of anger.
There was more sting in the speech
of Mr. DAvison, and one Churchillian
phrase: “They could not maintain con-
stitutional government on the theoreti-
cal inexactitudes of kaleidoscopic poli-
ticians,” which evidently pleased the
originator.
Mr. CHURCHILL himself was more
concerned with facts than phrases. The

impugned circular, though he took no
responsibility for its wording, was
essential at the time it was sent out,
for the State was bound to defend it-
self not against ordinary strikes, but
against those which would entail uni-
versal paralysis. Turning to Russia,
he described Bolshevism as a disease
rather than a policy; it spread rapidly,
but died out quickly and left its victims
—as Colonel WEDGwooD might be glad
to know—immune for the future.

RECOGNITION A LA MODE.
(A Romance of False Perspective.)
THE Press, ever anxious, as the
guardians of public sentiment, to cor-
rect the reaction that is apt to follow
upon any great outburst of popular
enthusiasm, did well to describe the
impending arrival of Prince Ongtong,
of the Solomon Islands, with his famous
mixed choir, as the second best news
since the signing of the Armistice. We
are glad to think that the reception of
this illustrious potentate in our midst
was worthy of the occasion.
There was a time when our rela-
tions with the Solomon Islanders were
strained. Their pagan and, we regret
to say, anthropophagous habits laid
them open to a certain amount of criti-
cism. Not many years ago Mr. Bam-
berger, the famous violinist, in the
course of a triumphal tour in the
Southern Pacific, was captured by the
inhabitants of Kulambranga, detained
for several weeks in captivity in a
mangrove swamp, where he suffered
great inconvenience from the gigantic
frogs (Rama Guppyi) which infest this
region, and was only rescued with great
difficulty by a punitive expedition—con-
ducted by Sir Pompey Boldero—when
on the eve of being sacrificed to the
gastronomic exigencies of his captors.
But this happily is all ancient history
now. The Solomon Islanders for seve.
ral years have been confirmed vege-
tarians, and the pronounced modifica-
tion in their mesocephalic skulls and
the improvement of their facial angle
afford the surest guarantee against any
relapse. Furthermore the instruction
in music which they received from Mr.
Bamberger has exerted a profoundly
mollifying effect on their manners.
Mr. Clutton Brock has pronounced
them to be the most artistic of all the
Papuans. Their paintings show a re-
markable affinity to the style of Picasso
and Matisse. Their choral singing is
the glory of the South Pacific.
Prince Ongtong and his party, who
made the journey by long sea in a
flotilla of catamarans and sampans,
arrived at Southampton on Saturday,
where they were met by perhaps the
most representative and influential
gathering of public men ever seen in
our times. The procession to the Town
Hall was headed by Lord READING,
Lord SYDENHAM, Mr. BottomLEY, Mr.
HoggE, Sir LEO CHIozzA Money, Mr.
SMILLIE and Mr. EUsTACE MILEs.
Then followed Prince Ongtong and his
choir, superbly gowned in their flow-
ing sarongs, wearing their long Papuan
pampooties and followed in turn by a
group of instrumentalists playing on
conchs, nose-flutes and a species of

mouth-organ closely resembling the
jew's-harp, but much larger and more
penetrating in its quality. The crowds
in the street were enormous; hundreds
of strong women fainted, and the casual-
ties are estimated at upwards of five
thousand.
The proceedings in the Town Hall
were brief but most impressive. After
the freedom of Southampton had been
conferred on the Prince by the Mayor,
in a gold casket, Lord READING in
a touching speech announced, amid
tempestuous cheers, that the Govern-
ment had resolved to signalise Prince
Ongtong's services by conferring on him
a dukedom and a grant of two million
pounds.
Continuing, Lord READING said that

pealed to him with peculiar magic. He
believed that they were the authentic
seat of King SolomoN's Mines, in spite
of the rival claims of Africa put for-
ward by Sir RIDER HAGGARD.
The Prince, who acknowledged the
honour influent Melanesian, was under-
stood to say that he had only done his
duty, that he was speechless with grati-
tude and that he would always regard
Lord READING as a brother. A recherché
vegetarian luncheon was then served,
after which Lord RotherMERE pre-
sented each member of the choir with
a cheque for ten thousand pounds, and
Mr. SMILLIE invited them to give evi-
dence before the Coal Commission.
The Prince and party were anxious
to proceed by special train to London,
where rooms had been engaged for
them at the Grand Palestine Hotel,
but, on leaving the Town Hall, were
surrounded by the crowd, which had
now swelled to nearly a million and
fought for the privilege of escorting the
visitors to the station with such des-
perate enthusiasm that at a late hour
on Saturday night no traces of Prince
Ongtong or any of his choir could be
discovered. This is all the more to be
regretted as arrangements had been
made for a competition between the
Solomon Islanders and the Czecho-
Slovakian singers, at which Lord
AsKw[TH had undertaken to adjudi-
cate. All hope however of tracing the
missing party has not yet been given
up, and a wireless message received at:

N. Y. D.
TRENCH-Foot, shell-shock and the
other well-known by-products of war
on the Western Front always got the
bulk of medical notice, while our rarer
Macedonian efforts remained neglected.
My friend McTurtle has nervous pros-
tration, with violent paroxysms at the
mention of leave or demobilization, and
him as “N. Y. D., or Not Yet Diagnosed
(malignant).”
McTurtle is a Staff-officer. A famous
the medical profession can only classify |
towards Athens and McTurtle sitting
wakeful amongst four snoring infantry-
men. He thought piously of the time
when the Staff should reach such a
pitch of organization that it would be
needless—nay, impossible—for infantry
to continue to exist. Towards dawn
he fell into a doze, and when he waked
it was light. He lowered what had
been the window and looked out.
McTurtle hates heights, and in his
cloistered Salonica life he had never
realised that the trains of Greece ran
about like mice upon a cornice. Four
rations thoughtfully provided for such
a contingency.
In due course McTurtle found him-
self on the front seat of a motor lorry
breasting the spurs of Mt. Parnassus.
The dizziness of his path was invisible
to him, for in a Grecian summer you
can see nothing out of motor vehicles
but dust.
But when the lorry reached the sum-
mit of the pass the sea-breeze from the
Gulf of Corinth cleared the air and he
saw for the first time the peaks on one
side and the gulfs on the other, with
Atlantic liner dumped him at
Salonica in 1915, and when
the first infantrymen panted
through the town in search of
non-existent billets McTurtle
was to be seen in the window of
a villa, giving bird-seed to his
canary. At Salonica it is not
considered good form to ask
openly what a Staff-officer's job
is, but he allowed friends to
gather that he had an indirect
connection with that fine old re-
giment, the Macedonian Labour
Corps.
After some time (about three
decorations and a mention in des.
patches, as McTurtle measured
time) the overland leave route
was opened, and the far-reaching
shadow of war plunged suddenly
across McTurtle's unlikely thres-
hold. He was called upon, like
many another harmless Staff-
officer, to give up his simple
comforts and to face hardship
and suffering for a scrap of
paper (authorising him to travel
to Manchester). At first Mc-
Turtle was content to let the
younger men of the Base make
a stand against the aggression
of the front line. Being the
only support of an aged Colonel
and no mere youth, he left it to
the reckless A.P.M.'s, the dash-

“Fine view, Sir," remarked

McTurtle gulped assent.
“Bit dangerous, 'o course,”
continued the driver chattily.
“There was a steam roller went

“Blimey, you've got a touch
coming on now, 'aven't you?”
At Itea, on the Gulf of Cor-
inth, the party was ordered to
return owing to a German offen-
sive in France. McTurtle went
back under chloroform. A week
later it made another attempt,
but was stopped by the Austrian
offensive in Italy. McTurtle
went back under morphia. At
the third attempt it got through,
2/\
ing Camp Commandants and the care-
free dare-devil Field-Cashiers to repel
the infantry and gunners. But his con-
science was uneasy, and indeed his
apparent lack of proper feeling was
commented upon by others. Once an
A.D.C. handed him a whito feather in
the Rue Venizelos.
At length it became obvious that the
Base was losing ground. The infantry
and gunners, outnumbering the Staff
by at least two to one, were gaining
positions on each leave-party. The
issue was trembling in the balance, and
McTurtle answered the call. With set
lips he sought the nearest orderly-room
sergeant.
Before a week was out the night saw
a train creeping through the gloom
hundred precipitous feet yawned be-
neath his horrified eyes, and at his
first involuntary gasp the teeth he
owed to art and not to nature leſt him
and swooped like a hawk upon a dis-
tant flock of sheep. The shepherd, a
simple rustic unfamiliar with modern
dentistry, endeavoured to sell them
subsequently to a Y.M.C.A. archaeolo-
gist as genuine antiques.
At that moment the train stopped.
McTurtle thought that his loss had
been noticed, but as he made his way
to the kit-truck for some more teeth he
discovered that a landslide barred the
way. The train backed cautiously for ten
minutes and stopped again. Another
landslide. The leave-party remained
stationary for thirty hours, eating the
but without McTurtle. ,
His nerve is gone, and he is marooned
at Salonica. He cannot face the over-
land route, and he cannot get home all
the way by sea just yet. In spite of all
his endeavours he cannot become a
naturalised Greek and stay there, be-
cause of linguistic difficulties.
But what he wants to know is, why
can't the medical authorities recognise
“leave-shock” as a disease and send
him home by hospital ship 2

SPREAD OF THE
‘DAZZLE” CULT.
LABOUR NOTES.
A THREAT was recently made by the
representatives of the miners that in-
dustrial action would be taken unless
the Government at once withdrew all
troops from Russia and abandoned con-
scription. There has been, it appears,
an unfortunate misunderstanding as to
the exact meaning of the term “indus-
trial action.” On Sunday a meeting of
protest against the miners' proposal
was held under the auspices of The
United Brotherhood of Worshipful
Lead-Swingers and Affiliated Trades.
Violent attacks were made by several
speakers upon the Miners' leaders, and
serious disruption in the Labour World
seemed imminent. But when it was
authoritatively explained that “indus-
trial action,” instead of meaning work,
as was supposed, was a euphemistic
term for striking, harmony reigned
once more. It was, however, unanim-
ously resolved that in future the expres-
sion “industrial inaction" be always
used in such connection, as “action ”
was a word repugnant to all right-
thinking Lead-Swingers, and, anyhow,
calculated in such a context to give rise
to confusion of thought.
× :: ::
A Trades Union has recently been
formed to further the interests and
raise the status of all who are in receipt
of Government unemployment pay. It
is hoped eventually to obtain a charter,
and thus give professional standing to
those employed in receiving such pay.
In the meantime, however, the Union is
working on orthodox labour lines, and
arrangements are practically completed
for calling a national strike of un-
employed to compel the Authorities to
increase the amount of the grant by
one hundred per cent. In the event of
a strike each member of the Union
will formally week by week refuse to
accept his or her money, and it is
believed that the Government will
quickly be brought to its knees. No
special steps are to be taken against
traitors to the cause who accept work.
The social ostracism thereby incurred
is felt to be a sufficient deterrent.
A regrettable impasse has been
reached in the dispute between The
Amalgamated Society of Trades Union
Leaders and the Trades Unions. Mr.
Blogg, speaking for the Leaders' society,
stated, on leaving the Conference last
night, that the outlook was black. Un-
less the rank and file of the Unions
were prepared to meet the Leaders'
demands a strike was certain. He
shrank from imagining what was likely
to happen if the Trades Unions were
left leaderless. The responsibility, how-
ever, did not rest with the Leaders.
They had made every possible con-
cession. A four-hours' day and a salary
of one thousand pounds per annum was
the minimum which would be con-
sidered. -
Comrade Snooks informed our re-
presentative that he was conducting
negotiations on behalf of the employers,
that is to say the ordinary members of
the Trades Unions. He stated with a
full sense of responsibility that if
the Leaders went on strike all the
resources of the Unions would be em-
ployed against them. On the whole
the Leaders had good berths—easy
work and high pay. Their demands
were becoming absolutely unreasonable
and must be opposed. Their methods
of enforcing their demands too were
to be deprecated. Only the preceding
evening one of the Trades Union
Leaders had become abusive and broken
one of his (Comrade Snooks') windows.
That sort of thing was disgusting, and
in the interests of decency and order
must be put down. In case of need
police protection would be applied for.
A Theme for Sir Henry Newbolt.
“When HAwKER came swooping from the
West.”

A GREAT budget of correspondence from all parts of the
country has reached Mr. Punch concerning the suggestions
put forward by famous golfers with the view of modifying
the predominant influence exercised by putting in golf. A
c:isis is rapidly being reached and Government intervention
may be invoked any day. -
Mr. Ludwig Shyster, of the North Boreland Golf Club,
suggests that the tin in the hole should be highly magne-
tized and the ball coated with a metallic substance so that
it might be attracted into the hole. Golf, he contends, is
a recreation, and the true aim of golf legislation should be

should be our aim. The principle of self-determination
should in his opinion be conceded to all properly constituted

Lord BIRKENHEAD is all for maintaining the status quo
in regard to holes and greens, but takes up a strong attitude
on the improvement of the water-supply. In this respect
golf-architecture has hitherto been sadly to seek. There

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Mr. Standfast (Hodder AND SToUGHToN) is the third
book of the super-spy trilogy that Colonel John BUCHAN
has given us, as a kind of supplement to his more official
record of the War. We have the same hero, Hannay, as in
Greenmantle and The Thirty-Nine Steps, the same group
of associates, reinforced for purposes of love-interest by a
young and attractive female, and the same arch-Hun, now
identified as the Graf von Schwabing. Also the affair pur-
sues much the same hide-and-seek course that gave the
former adventures their deserved popularity. I entirely
decline even to sketch the manifold vicissitudes of Hannay
(now a General), tracking and being tracked, captive and
captor, ranging the habitable and non-habitable globe,
always (with a fine disregard for the requirements of book-
making) convinced that the next chapter will be the last.
Three criticisms I cannot avoid. To begin with, Colonel
BUCHAN is really becoming too lavish with his coincidences.
Secondly, I found it odd that the spy-hunters, after employ-
ing so many ruses and so much camouflage that one might
say they almost refused to recognise their own reflections
in a mirror, should proceed to the opposite extreme and
arrange all their plans, with engaging frankness, over the
telephone. Finally, the tale, though full of admirable dis-
connected moments, does not, carry one along sufficiently
quickly. General Hannay was, I thought, too apt to
interpolate lengthy reminiscences of active service, just
when I wanted to get on with the matter in hand. Pace in
such affairs is everything, and my complaint is that, though
the hunt had yielded some capital sport, its end found me
with my pulse rather disappointingly calm.
As was to be expected, one of the signs of the times in
literature, not of one country but of all, is a grim change in
its attitude towards war. The era of pomp and circum-
stance, as of genial make-believe, is gone by ; more and
more are our writers beginning to give us militarism stripped
of romance, a grisly but (I suppose) useful picture. I have
nowhere found it more horrible than in a story called The
Secret Battle (METHUEN), written by Mr. A. P. HERBERT,
whose initials are familiar to Punch readers under work of
a lighter texture. This is an intimate study, inspired
throughout by a cold fury of purpose that can be felt on
every page, of the destruction of a young man's spirit in
the insensate machinery of modern war. There is no other
plot, no side issues, no relief. From the introduction of
Harry Penrose, fresh from Oxford, embarking like a gallant
gentleman upon the adventure of arms, to the tragedy that
blotted him out of a scheme that had misused and ruined .
him, the record moves with a dreadful singleness of intent. |
Sometimes, one at least hopes, the shadows may have been
artificially darkened. It seems even to-day hardly credible
that events should conspire to such futility of error. But
as a story with a purpose, not, in spite of the publisher's
description, a novel, The Secret Battle certainly deserves the
epithet “striking.” It is a blow from the shoulder.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The worst of quotations is that either their staleness is
tedious or their unfamiliarity irritates. Mr. S. G. TALLEN-
TYRE has at least one, generally of the latter sort, and
oftener half-a-dozen, on every page of Love Laughs Last
(BLAckwood), or, at any rate, that is one's first impression
of the book; while the second is that the number of charac-
ters is not much less. It follows that in trying to identify
all the persons to whom he may or may not have been
introduced in the previous pages, and all the phrases in
inverted commas he has certainly seen somewhere else
sometime, the truly diligent reader will be kept faithfully
at his task—a pleasant one possibly, but just a thought too
much like hard work to be quite entertaining in a novel.
Apart from all this and an occasional obscure sentence
there is nothing much to grumble at in a story that tells
how David, the sailor, unlearned in the ways of ladies,
became engaged for insufficient reasons to one Theo, only
to fall promptly in love with another, certainly much nicer,
called Nancy; and how still a third, Sally, with various other
finds “the beaks much easier to get on with,” perhaps
shows that Mr. LUNN does not intend those of Hornborough
as wholly typical of the most abused race in fiction. For
the rest, the boy characters of the book are presented with
a quiet realism very refreshing after some recent “sensa-
tional revelations.” Mr. LUNN's boys, alike in their speech
and outlook, are admirably observed; indeed the persons
of the tale struck me throughout as being better than its
rather out-of-date happenings.
My landlady assures me that His Daughter (CoLLINs) is
a “lovely story,” and I think it only right that Mr.
GouverNEUR MoRRIs should have the benefit of her criti-
cism, since my own is distinctly less favourable. Mr. MoRBIs
showed signs at one time of being able to write a first-class
novel of aïventure, but he abandoned this field for a more
lucrative appeal to the Great American Bosom, whose
taste, if I may say so without endangering the League of
Nations, is more in harmony with my landlady's than with
people, intent on rescuing
him from his dilemma,
made a most unscrupulous
and indeed most improbable
conspiracy against number
one, who was unpopular.
One can't help feeling that
they were all, including the
author, a bit hard on Theo,
whosephilanthropicnotions
were really too good for the
amount of sense allotted her
to work them out with.
Most of the rest of them
would have nothing to do
with raising the masses,
but, after the comfortable
fashion of early nineteenth-
century days, were content
to let well alone at eight
shillings a week. Perhaps it
was this restful attitude that
decided the publishers to
claim for this volume the dis-
tinctive quality of “charm.”

about boys as about masters, the real hero being not
Maurice Leigh (with whose adventures school-novelists of
an earlier day would solely have concerned themselves),
the pleasantly undistinguished lad who enters Hornborough
in the first chapter and leaves it in the last, but Quirk, the
young and energetic master, whose efforts to vitalize the
very dry bones of Hornborough education hardly meet the
success that they deserve. Concerning this I am bound to
add that I found some difficulty in accepting Mr. LUNN's
picture as quite fair to an average public school in the early
twentieth century. That its authorities should have been
so violently perturbed by a proposal to teach SHAKSPEARE
histrionically, or by the spectacle of boys enjoying modern
poetry, surely supposes conditions almost incredibly archaic.
This, however, does nothing to detract from the admirably-
drawn figure of Quirk himself, bursting with energy,
enthusiasm and intolerance, overcoming passive resist-
ance on the part of the boys, only to be shipwrecked
upon the cast-iron prejudice of the staff. That his apoth-
eosis should have been translation to Rugby, where he
an era of comparative con-
tinence has really set in. At this juncture we part with
him—I without a pang; my landlady, I well know, with a
sigh for his lost irresistibility.
Barry Dunbar, the heroic padre of Mr. RALPH CoNNor's
story, The Sky Pilot of No Man's Land (Hodden AND
Stoughton), hailed from Canada and went to France with
the Canadians. Endowed with superb physical beauty and
considerable musical gifts he started, you might think, with
fortune in his favour. But at the outset he was a tactless
young man and had a good deal to learn before he was in
any way competent to teach. Mr. RALPH CoNNor has de-
scribed with skill and great sincerity the horrors of the
War in the earlier days; but for me he has spoilt both his
story and the effect of it by his extreme sentimentality. He
is persistently concerned to raise a lump in my throat. I
readily believe that he was actuated by the highest motive
in trying to show us how responsive the Canadians were
when their spiritual needs were attended to by a man of
courage and understanding. But I dislike an excess of
emotional spasms, and in these Mr. CoNNor has indulged so
freely that his book can only be for other tastes than mine.

TO ROBERT OF THE FORCE.

That you are fashioned not as other men

But come of more than human kin,
Immune, or practically so, from sin.

The aspect of a tower that never totters;

Drawn either from the oven or the barrel;

And it was you who almost fell from grace,
Striking, like Lucifer, against authority,
Leaving your Heaven for another place
Not mentioned by your ten-to-one majority,
And doomed, to your surprise and pain,
Never, like Lucifer, to rise again.
But you were wise, my Robert, wise in time;
And I, who set you far above humanity, -
High-pedestalled upon my lofty rhyme,

EMBARRAssMENT AND THE LAwYER.
Watson is a young barrister who is feeling rather pleased
with himself. I confess that he has deserved it. -
The situation was as follows. Before the War he had
had no briefs, but had always had a conscience. A hope.
less state of affairs. Then he went to the War and shed
his conscience somewhere in the Balkans. So far so good.
But, when he was demobilised and began to take stock of
what had been happening at home in the meanwhile, he
found to his horror that a conscience had again been thrust
upon him by the General Council of the Bar. -
Such was the situation he had to face, and he has won
through. - -
How, you ask, did the G.C.B. play this trick on him 2
It happened in this way. Having nothing better to do dur.
ing Watson's absence and at a critical moment of the War,
these idle elderly well-fed lawyers solemnly deliberated upon
the following fantastic problem:—
“What is the duty of counsel who is deſending a prisoner
on a plea of Not Guilty when the prisoner confesses to
counsel that he did commit the offence charged 2"
With a cynical disregard of their own past these sophists
propounded the following answer:—
“If the confession has been made before the proceedings
have been commenced it is most undesirable that an advocate
to whom the confession has been made should undertake
the defence, as he would most certainly be seriously em-
barrassed in the conduct of the case, and no harm can be
done to the accused by requesting him to retain another
advocate.”
• The new Watson was unable to agree with this doctrine,
so far as it concerned himself. Nevertheless he had no choice
but to accept it.
::: ::: :k :: sk -k -:
The legal conscience thus gratuitously thrust upon him
was soon to undergo its first ordeal. An acquaintance of his,
in a moment of absent-mindedness, murdered somebody,
and asked Watson to persuade the inevitable jury that he
hadn't. The said acquaintance explained to Watson that he
simply did it when he wasn't thinking.
Watson was in a hole. Obviously this was a case to
which the embarrassment prescribed by the General Council
of the Bar was applicable. This legal embarrassment, which,
strictly speaking, ought now to be his, would not, how-
ever, have worried him in the least had it not been for
another consideration. Suppose, after Watson had triumph-
antly got his client acquitted, it got about that the “inno-
cent” had confessed his crime to counsel beforehand? |
That would mean an end to Watson's professional career.
One does not thus slight the edicts of the mighty with
impunity.
Watson was too proud to ask his client to keep the deadly
secret, or to apply the famous wriggle of Hippolytus: “My
tongue hath sworn, but my heart remains unsworn.”
Nevertheless Watson gave his mind to the problem. In
the end he decided on the following line of defence : “Not
Guilty,” and in the alternative “Guilty under justifiable cir- |
cumstances, without malice aforethought but with intent to
benefit the person murdered.” - -
Happily the General Council of the Bar has not yet ||
assigned any moral embarrassment to a counsel who pleads ||
“Not Guilty,” and in the alternative, “Guilty.” Watson |
therefore reasoned that if the jury returned a verdict of |
“Not Guilty,” his client's alternative confession could be
written off as an obvious mistake; on the other hand, if
he were found “Guilty,” the fact of confession would be
an ethical asset towards securing for him a lenient view of
the case. * - - - -
As I said, Watson behaved well. He proved to his own
and the jury's satisfaction (1) that his client did not com-
mit the murder; (2) that alternatively he did commit the
murder, but that he did so for the good of everybody con-
cerned; and (3) that in either case he never meant to do it.
In the event the prisoner was acquitted without a stain
upon his character or upon his advocate's.
Watson is now well established as the last hope of
abandoned causes. He is a specialist in defence, and
criminals of every shade throng to him. When a new one
swims into his ken Watson meets him on the threshold
and says, “Don’t speak a word. Read this;” and he puts
into his hand a printed slip. The slip reads:—
“Conditions of Advocacy.
“(1) If you put your case into my hands it ceases at
once and from that moment to be any concern of your
own, You are not entitled, for instance, to express any
opinion as to whether you committed the alleged crime
or not. That is my affair exclusively. -
“ (2) If howeverthere is anything which lies so heavily
on your conscience that it must out sooner or later, let it
be later. I am open to receive confessions at any time
after proceedings have begun.
“If you accept these conditions, good; if not, go."
Watson says they always accept them, so he never
worries about the General Council of the Bar.

IN the heart of the Forêt de Roumare
there is a spot called Rond du Chêne
à Leu, where eight paths meet. Why
they choose to meet there, unless it is
for company, one can't imagine. The
fact that there is not an estaminet with-

a military objective. Therefore, having
been decoyed thither by a plausible
guide-book, it was with surprise that I
beheld an ancient representative of the
British Army smoking his pipe with
the air of having been in possession for
centuries.
“Bit lonely here,” I said.
“Rumble's Moor on a wet Friday's

chain on a sign-post for a whole year

“Tha-at ud be afore we brought our

“What do you mean?”
“Ratty Beslow, my owd colleague
an' sparring pardner. It's 'im you weer
talking of, ain't it?”
“It wasn't ; but I'm interested in
him,” I said, sitting down on a pile of
logs. “How did he get to hospital?”
“Through a mistake in Nacheral

fa-ace o' the moon, which I judged to
be Ratty.
“‘Ratty's after altitude records,'

“The next night, feeling mightylonely,

HINTS ON SELECTING AN AEROPLANE.
As all the world will soon be in the
air a few words of advice on choosing
an aerial steed may be of assistance to
intending fliers who have so far had no
experience as owners of winged craft.
The first thing is to locate the where-
abouts of the best park, for one speaks
of a park of aeroplanes just as one
speaks of a school of whales, a grove of
wombats or a suite of leeches. Having
arrived (wearing, if you are wise, a full-
grown cheek cap, with the back to the
front and the peak protecting the nape
of the neck from the bites of savage
vendors), take a deep breath and look
round you knowingly.
By the way, what are you—peer,
profiteer, or plain pater-familias looking
for a family air-bus? It is impossible
to advise you how to select a plane
without knowing whether you want
one for long-distance journeys (with
non-starting attachment), for stunting,
or merely for gadding about and drop-
ping in on your friends. There is a
sad story afloat of a man who bought
an air-bus the other day for world-
touring and only discovered the insuffi-
ciency of cupboards and the want of a
bathroom after starting on his maiden
trip to Patagonia (where the nuts drop
off).
Let us suppose that you are one of
the majority of heavier-than-air per-
sons who will shortly be wanting a
good steady machine to rise to any
ordinary occasion.
Well, then, look round you carefully.
Observe the demeanour of the machines
that are trotted out (if such a term may
be used) for your inspection. The flick
of a tail, the purr of an engine or the
slope of a wing may give the observant
a clue as to the disposition of an aerial
Pegasus.
But however reassuring a prelimin-
ary canter may be (to borrow another
horsey simile) insist on a thorough
personal inspection of all parts of the
machine. Test the musical capacity of
the wire entanglement, screw and un-
screw the turnbuckles till the seller
cries for mercy, and run your hands
well over the body (the aeroplane's, of
course) to make quite sure that it will
support the weight of yourself, of your
family and of your parasites—remem-
bering in this connection that Aunt
Louisa kicks the beam at 15.7. Make
sure also that the body will not part com-
pany with the rest of the box of tricks
at one of those awkward corners in the
sky. Also, if you have time, it might
be well to glance at the engine, the
petrol tank and the feed-pipe, as experts
consider these of importance.
Having satisfied yourself that all
these things are as they should be in
the best of all possible aeroplanes, that
the joy-stick works as smoothly as a
beer-pull, and that the under-carriage
has the necessary wheels, axles and
other things that under-carriages are
licensed to carry, little remains but to
pay for the machine and make a nose-
dive for home.
A longer and more detailed article
on “How to Choose a Stunter,” by the
Bishop of Solder and Man, with which
is incorporated “A Few Hints on Bank.
ing for Beginners,” by Sir John BRAD-
BURY, will appear in next week's issue.

HUMOUR'S LABOUR LOST.
Lochtermachty, N.B.
May 29th, 1919.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-My father and I
have fallen out over the question of
your literary judgment and sense of
humour. If I weren't a filial daughter
I'd say that he's a —; but I am, so
I won't call him names.
The fact is that, before he became a
professional Padre, he didn't know that
such things as senses of humour existed.
All that mattered in his life were Latin
and Greek and Hebrew and the other
pursuits of the classical scholar. How-
ever, during his wanderings with the
Army he has somehow managed to
acquire what he calls “an appreciation
of the laughable.” And that is the cause
of our divided house. .
This morning at breakfast, while he
was reading out the account of the pro-
ceedings of the General Assemblies, he
came upon the interesting statement—
volunteered by an eminent Edinburgh
divine—that all the ministers of the
Kirk have lost a stone in weight during
the War, and that this works out at a
loss of five tons of ministerial flesh to
the United Free Church of Scotland.
Then, after he had tested the accuracy
of the statistics, which he found quite
incorrect, and I had meditated upon
the bulk of matter encircled by the
parental Sam Browne, we were both
seized with an idea, and said “Punch / "
at the same instant.
It took us some time to get rid of the
accumulation of marmalade, margarine
and bacon fat which we amassed in
our attempts to link fingers across the
table; but about 10.30 or so we got
settled down to work on your behalf.
Until lunch-time we were fully occu-
pied in giving each other ideas and
then explaining why they wouldn't
work. After lunch the Padre retired to
his study to work out, he said, a satire
—after ARIstoph ANEs—which would
afford him an opportunity of introduc-
ing the Archbishop of CANTERBURY's
speech, and making some whimsical
allusions to the legend of the strayed
lamb come back to tell his lean Scotch
brethren of the green meadows and
luscious feeding to be had across the
Borders.
My own ambitions were slighter. I
would do a conversation perhaps be-
tween the shades of Johnson and his
Bozzy, or a Limerick, or even just an
original witty remark, or, failing all of
these, I would select an “apt quota-
tion.” About tea-time I retired to the
garden with a notebook, a pencil and a
book of quotations. By 6.30 I had a
list of one hundred and two, and was
wavering over the final choice of a
parody on “Some hae meat wha canna
eat,” and an adaptation of “Be sooople,
Davie, in things immaterial,” when my
parent came out to the lawn, flushed
and excited, with his last three hairs
triumphantly erect, and brandished a
document in my face.
It was an ode, Mr. Punch—an ode
five (foolscap) pages long, written in
Greek' -
I gave him best at once, and then
very gently suggested that his composi-
tion might not in its present unmiti-
gated form be quite suited to your
tastes and requirements.
I shall spare you the details of the
ensuing controversy, but I want you to
know that I have spared you much
else, and in so doing have forfeited not
only my father's affection but a pro-
jected advance on my next quarter-but-
three's dress allowance.
I hope you need no further proof of
my devotion. Yours, etc.,
A DAUGHTER of THE MANse.
P.S.—I was forgetting to say that
you will find the bit about the ministers
near the bottom of the third column of
the tenth page of Thursday's Scotsman.
Perhaps you can think of a funny
treatment yourself.
SONGS OF SIMLA.
III.--THE FURRIER.
Akbar the furrier squats on the floor
Sucking an Eastern pipe,
Thumbing the lakhs that he's made of
'Ore,
Laki which creep to the long-dreamed
CrOre
In a ledger of Western type.
And all around him the wild beasts
sway,
Cured of their mortal ills—
Flying squirrels from Sikkim way,
Silver foxes that used to play
Up on the Kashmir hills.
On the shelf of a cupboard a polecat
lies
Laughing between his paws,
And there 's more than a hint of
amused surprise
In the gape of the lynx, in the marten's
eyes,
In the poise of the grey wolf's claws.
And, should you enter old Akbar's lair
And hear what he wants for his skins,
You will know why the little red squir-
rels stare,
Why the Bengal tiger gasps for air
And the gaunt snow-leopard grins.
— J. M. S.
The Telephone Girl's motto: Nulla
linea sine die —“Number engaged;
ring again and again, please.”
ALAS! POOR PANTHER.
I went to the Derby fully intending
to back the favourite—The Panther.
But the cross-currents immediately
set in—as they always do.
I began by making the mistake of
reading the forecasts of all the experts
—the gallant Captains and Majors, the
Men on the Course, the Men on the
Heath, the Men on the Spot—all of
whom, although they mostly favoured
The Panther, had serious views as to
dangerous rivals, supported by what
looked like uncontrovertible arguments.
I also had an early evening paper
with a summary of forecasts, none of
which (as it was to turn out) mentioned
the winner at all.
I was even so foolish as to glance
at some of the advertisements of the
wizards who are so ready to put the
benefit of their knowledge at the service
of the public and make fortunes for
others , rather (apparently) than for
themselves, all of whom hinted at
some mysterious long-priced outsider
whose miraculous qualities of speed
were a secret. But of course I was too
late to profit by these; they merely
unsettled me. -
Not content with this I was forced
to overhear the conversation of others
in our compartment, each of whom
fancied a separate animal, arguing with
reasons that could not be gainsaid.
In this way I learned that The
Panther would win in a canter and
would be badly beaten; that he was a
stranger to the Epsom course; that he
was ready for anything; that he liked
soft going; that he was no good except
when he could hear his hoofs rattle;
that his jockey was not strong enough;
that his jockey was ideal; that he was
sounder than any horse had ever been,
and that trouble was brewing.
All this naturally left me shaken as to
my first decision. Was I wise, I asked
myself, to trust all my eggs (forgive,
Sir ALEC BLACK, the poorness of this
metaphor) to one doubtful basket?
Having admitted an element of
doubt I was the prey of every sus-
picion and began to consider the other
candidates. All Alone headed the list.
I liked the name, because it suggested
the corollary: the rest nowhere. Also
it belonged to a lady—to the only lady
owner, in fact — and lady - owners
were said (by a man with a red beard
opposite me who smoked cigarettes so
short that I was certain it was made
of dyed asbestos) to be in luck this
season. “Always follow the luck,” he
added. But then, on the other hand,
what could be more lucky than Colonel
BUCHAN, author of Mr. Standfast and
an excellent History of the War, into

whose lap so many good things fall 2
Why not back a horse named after
him 2 Besides, was not Buchan third
favourite 2
I was making a note of Buchan's
claims, when a man with a Thermos
flask lashed to his side began to praise
Dominion. Dominion, it seems, was
third in the Two Thousand Guineas—
only just behind Buchan, who was just
behind The Panther. Many people
thought The Panther unduly lucky that
day. A very different course, too, at
Newmarket from that at Epsom. Obvi-
ously Dominion must be remembered.
Moreover he was being greatly fancied
and some of the best judges looked to
him to win the Blue Riband for Lord
GLANELY. The fact that Lord GLANELY
drew his own horse in the Baltic Sweep
was not to be sneezed at either, said
some one. That's an omen if there
ever was one! And it knocked out
Lord GLANELY's other horse, Grand
Parade.
“Well, here's a tip,” cried a man with
a frock-coat and a straw hat. “Blest if
I've got a single coin left—nothing but
aper money. That's good enough for
me. I shall back Paper Money.”
The carriage agreed that that was
his duty. “Of course you must,” they
said. “When everyone disagrees in
the way that the experts do, you might
as well take a tip like that as anything.”
Paper Money had therefore to be added
also to my list of possibles.
“Besides,” said another man, “DoN-
oGHUE rides him; our leading jockey,
you know.” I had forgotten to look at
the jockeys' names. How absurd . Of
course one must back DoNogHUE.
But just then, “Give me WHALLEy,”
said the man with the asbestos beard,
and, as WHALLEY was riding Bay of
Naples, I had to consider him too.
Naples was a jolly place and I had had
a lot of fun there. Hadn't I better
make that my tip 2
But, on the other hand, what about
Tangiers? I had had fun there too,
and more than one fellow-passenger
had darkly hinted that this was a much
better animal than public form pro-
claimed. Looking for particulars, I
found that he once “ran Galloper Light
to a head; ” which had a promising
sound. He was trained at Lambourné
too, and I like Lambourne. There is a
good inn there and it is a fine walk to
White Horse Hill.
“Well,” said another man, who had
been borrowing matches from his neigh-
bour ever since Victoria, “I always had
a feeling for a Marcovil colt. Marcovil
is a good sire. I've had some very
special information about Milton, the
Marcovil colt, to-day.”
MILTON –one of my favourite poets,
and also one of Mr. Asquith's, as he
said in that lecture last week. Yes,
but is Mr. AsquitH exactly lucky just
now? Perhaps not. And did not
MILTON write Paradise Lost 2 True.
But, on the other hand, he wrote Para-
dise Regained. You see how difficult
tip-hunting can bel
And so it went on and I emerged
from the Epsom Downs station in a
maze of indecision, in which one fact
and one only shone with crystal clear-
ness, and that was that whatever won
the race The Panther had no better
chance, even though it had been made
favourite, than any other.
“Besides,” as one of the two men
who sat on my knees had said, “What's
a favourite anyway? Wery often a horse
is made a favourite by the bookies, in
conjunction with the Press, just so as
everyone will back it. No, no favour-
ites for me. Give me a likely outsider
at good odds. Look what you have
to put on The Panther to win any-
thing.”
In the result I backed—well, I am
not going to tell you; but they “also
ran.” - -
The moral of this story—if it has
one—is either don't bet at all, or, if you
do bet, draw the horse from a hat at
random, and, having drawn it, stick
to it. No one, as the failure of The
Panther proves, can possibly know more
than you.

TECHNICAL TERMS.
WHEN Ernest asked me to take a run in his car I took
advantage of the invitation because there are times when I
think that life is less joyful without a car and that one day
I shall slip out and buy one. I should love to grip the
wheel and sweep the countryside and listen to the soft purr
of the engine. So we started sweeping the countryside,
Ernest and I; but we had not swept very much of it before
the soft purr developed a kind of cough and the car stopped.
Ernest coaxed and petted her. He tried kindness, while
I helped him with sarcasm. He tried hauteur and then
a little bad temper.
Eventually he decided to send for the local motor
engineer, and it was when this gentleman arrived with
his mate that I decided that motoring was not for me and
that I should have to fall back on fretwork or tame mice
for my recreation. -
“Here, Bill,” said Overalls-in-Chief, “just hold up the
Ding-dong.”
His mate did as instructed and up went the Ding-dong.
“Now hand me the Doo-dal,” he went on ; “and while I
tune up the old Jig-jig you get the Pipety-pip and clean
it out. - -
“Now get the Tick-tick and just give me a tap here
with the Ooh-jah, while I give the Thing-a-me-tight a
couple for his nob.

the other Jigger sort of gave the half-seas-over to the
Thing-a-me-bob and missed the Rum-ti-tum. Simple, ain't
it, Guv'nor ?”
“Yes,” I answered, “quite simple.”
But I have decided to give up all idea of buying a car. I
should never learn the language.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 2nd.-The Lords sel-
dom sit die Lunae, and were perhaps
feeling what humbler folk call “rather
Mondayish" at being summoned from
their week-end pleasaunces to put
the Local Government (Ireland) Bill
through its final stages. Anyhow
they developed some eleventh-hour
criticisms. The sad case of the Belfast
Water Commissioners attracted Lord
STUART of Wortley. There are fif-
teen of them—one each for the existing
wards. But under the Bill Belfast is
to be divided into ten wards; and fif-
teen into ten won't go, even in Ireland.
Lord PEEL considered that while Lord
STUART's arithmetic was impeccable
his fears were exaggerated. If Belfast
drinks its whiskey neat it will not be
for want of Water Commissioners.
In the Commons Members were dis-
appointed to learn from Sir AUCKLAND
GEDDEs that he had no idea of the time
when railway-fares would be reduced
to the amount printed on the tickets.
Nor were they much consoled by his
promise to consider the suggestion that
as the fare cannot be brought down to
the ticket the ticket shall be brought
up to the fare. We should not lightly
part with our few reminders of the
cheap dead days that are no more. In
fact it would be a salutary thing if
other tradesmen imitated the “com-
mercial candour" of the railways and
ticketed their goods with the pre-war
value in addition to the present charge.
There is a juvenile impulsiveness
about Sir HENRY CRAIK which reminds
one of “the boy who wouldn't grow
up,” and may account for his keen
interest in Kensington Gardens. Dis-
satisfied with an assurance of the FIRST
CoMMissionER of WoRKs that he was
doing his best to get the War Office to
clear away their hutments he burst
out, “Could he not attempt to use
some disciplinary action against the
obstinacy, the stupidity, the slackness,
the carelessness of those who are re-
sponsible?” Swept away by this spate
of sibilants Sir ALFRED Mond essayed
no further answer.
After less than an hour's debate the
House gave the CHANCELLCR of THE
ExchEQUER power to borrow a trifle of
two hundred and fifty millions, to
square this year's account, plus an un-
defined sum to enable him to fund
the floating debt, now amounting to
close on two thousand millions. Even
Sir FREDERICK BANBURY had no serious
objection to raise, his chief anxiety
being that everyone, and not merely
the plutocratic holders of Treasury
Bills, should be permitted to subscribe
to the new loan. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
assured him that it was a case of “Let
'em all come.”

more enfeebled than ever, and unless
she devolves a large part of her duties
upon subordinate assemblies her end
is near. But I noticed that, although
Ireland was expressly excepted from
their resolution, most of them talked of
little else, and I fancy that but for
Dublin we should not have heard much
of devolution.
As a statesman His Grace of CAN-
TERBURY has hitherto enjoyed the re-
putation of being “safe" rather than
dashing. . But that is evidently a mis-
take, for in introducing the Bill which
is to enable the Church to free itself
from some of the trammels imposed
upon it by the State he begged his
hearers not to be afraid of “brave
adventurous legislation.” His appeal
was quite lost upon Lord HALDANE,
who was shocked by the terrible possi-
bilities of the measure, and warned the
PRIMATE that if the Bill became law
he would have signed the death-warrant
of the Establishment. Coming from a
Presbyterian who helped to disestablish
the Church in Wales, this showed the
heights of altruism to which a real
philosopher may rise.
Colonel WEDGwood was shocked to
learn that in the occupied territories
Germans had to take off their hats
when addressing British officers. But
it would be a mistake to assume that
his concern was due to any tenderness
for our foes. On the contrary, it was
exhibited out of regard for the feel-
ings of British officers. Mr. CHURCHILL
regretted the inconvenience, but pointed
out that it had always been the prac-
tice—even in Belgium—for an Army
of Occupation to exact certain acts of
respect from the inhabitants.
Mr. KELLAway, who announced last
week with such pride that “the Gov-
ernment have struck oil,” was now able
to state that the oil had reached a
height of 2,400 feet and was still rising
steadily. There is some talk of inviting
the successful engineers to put down
bores at Westminster.

fancy that a good many of them settled
their difficulty to-day by betaking them-
selves to a fourth place, not in the pre-
cincts of the Palace of Westminster.
There was anything but a Grand
Parade on the green benches, and the
faithful few who were present put a
good many questions “on behalf of my
honourable friend.” The Front Benches
were well manned, however, and Mr.
LoNG had quite a busy time explaining
to Commander BELLAIRs why the Ad-
miralty thought it inadvisable at this
date to hold courts-martial in regard to
the Naval losses of 1914. The House
was more interested to hear that the
Peace celebrations will include a Naval
procession through London, and that

PROGRESS OF THE COMMISSION.
The Literary section of the Nation-
alisation Commission met last Friday.
Before evidence was taken the Chair-
man, Mr. ROBERT WILLIAMS, said that
as their Report must be delivered in less
than a week the Commission had de-
cided not to summon Lord MORLEY,
Lord ROSEBERY or Mr. Thomas HARDY,
but hoped in the few days still available
to hear the evidence of Sir THOMAS
Hall CAINE, Lady WARWICK, Mrs.
BARCLAY, Mr. SPACKMAN and Mr.
SMILLIE.
Mr. EDWARD MARSA read an interest-
ing Report on the State Remuneration
of Poets. He was of opinion that
poets, if they could be shown to be of
the authentic Georgian brand, ought to
be secured a reasonable salary quite
irrespective of the views which they
expressed. They must never be ex-
pected to glorify or approve of the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, but
should be perfectly free to criticise or
attack him. No attempt should be
made to impose any metrical constraint
on their verse.
But he thought it de-
sirable tlrat for the purpose of bringing
them to the notice of the public a State

CoLoner, WEDGwood. How do you
expect a workman earning only three
pounds a week to afford seven shillings
for every novel that he buys?—Person-
ally I should like to see the cost reduced,
but I understand that if the price of
novels were fixed at one shilling it
would involve the State in an expendi-

of novels, which has fallen during the

[JUNE 11, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A ROYAL INTERVIEW.
“SoMEoNE to see you, Miss.”
Thus Mary at about nine o'clock on
an April evening at the door of my tiny
sitting-room.
There was a strange little quiver in
her voice.
Mary is so extremely well trained,
and so accustomed, moreover, to queer
visitors at the flat, that I looked up in
surprise. -
“Yes?” I said. “Is it a lady ?”
Mary did not reply immediately; she
seemed half-dazed.
“Is it a lady ?" I repeated a little
sharply. My usually imperturbable
parlourmaid appeared to have taken
leave of her senses.
“She said she was a queen, Miss,”
she gasped.
At that moment the visitor, evidently
grown tired of waiting, calmly floated
in through the half-open door and
settled down gracefully in the centre of
a large gold cushion lying on the end
of the Chesterfield.
Fortunately I grasped the situation
at once.
“Thank you, Mary,” I said, with
what I now feel to have been most
commendable coolness in the entirely
unprecedented circumstances; “I will
ring if I want tea later.”
When the door had closed upon the
still gasping Mary I turned apologeti-
cally to my visitor.
“I’m so sorry, your Majesty,” I said.
“You see, my maid was not unnatur-
ally a little surprised—”
“It's quite all right,” said the Fairy
Queen graciously; “I thought you
wouldn't mind my coming in.”
“Of course not,” I said; “I am only
too delighted. Won't you come nearer
the fire 2"
She looked down at the cushion on
which she was sitting, then she looked
up at me and smiled.
“I don't like to leave it,” she said ;
“it’s so pretty.” And she stroked the
soft gold stuff with her tiny hand.
“Yes,” I said; “and your lovely frock
goes with it so beautifully. But how
would this be 2"
I stooped, gently lifted the cushion
with its delicate burden and put it
down on the floor in front of the fire.
“There—how is that ?”
“That's delightful,” said the Fairy
Queen. “I’m so glad you like my
frock,” she went on. “Paris, of course.
That is to say, the idea came from
there. My own people did the actual
making. After all, no one can touch
the French when it comes to real chic.
Don't you think so?”
I acquiesced. Oh, yes, Paris was
certainly the best.
“But I didn't come here to discuss
clothes,” said my visitor. She made a
quick movement and leaned suddenly
forward on the cushion, her delicate
golden head supported on her slender
hand. “Do you know the Editor of
Punch 2" she asked abruptly.
I hesitated. “I can't exactly say
that I know him,” I said.
The Fairy Queen looked very dis-
appointed.
“Oh, dear, then I'm afraid it's no good.
I thought you'd be sure to know him.”
“But although I don't know him
personally I am in communication
with him,” I said. “Perhaps— ”
She brightened up a little.
“I suppose you could write,” she
said ; “though of course it would be
far better to see him.”
“It's about that cover,” she went
on. I looked at her blankly.
“The cover of Punch, you know.”
Vague pictures of Mr. Punch sur-
rounded by little dancing figures, an
easel, Toby, a lion—surely there was
a lion somewhere—flitted across my
mind. What on earth had the cover of
Punch got to do with the Fairy Queen?
I went over to the little table where
lay the latest copy, and came back with
it in my hand and knelt down on the
floor near the cushion.
The Fairy Queen came close to me
and peered over the edge of the paper.
“Look at the fairies,” she said,
pointing with a tiny indignant finger.
“Look at them. They're most dread-
fully old-fashioned. Nobody in fairy-
land looks in the least like that now.”
I looked. Certainly the little figures
had rather an early-Victorian air about
them.
“Of course we should never dream
of being tremendously fashionable or
anything of that kind. I would not
for one moment think of allowing any
of my court-ladies to cut their hair
short, for instance, or to wear one of
those foolish hobble skirts; but nobody,
nobody could accuse us of being dowdy.
Now tell me, have you ever seen one of
us looking like that, or like that ?”
“But are you quite sure,” I said, not
without hesitation, for she was by way
of being rather an autocratic and im-
perious little person and I was the least
little bit afraid of her—“are you quite
sure that they are fairies?”
“Of course they are,” she replied
quickly. “What else could they be 2
Naturally Mr. Punch would have fairies
all round him. He loves us. You have
no idea how much we have in common.”
I didn't reply at once. I was en-
gaged in staring at the familiar design.
“They haven't any wings,” I said,
still rather doubtfully, “except this
one at the bottom.”
; :
But the Fairy Queen was very decided
indeed. “All fairies don't have wings,”
she said; “and with regard to that par-
ticular one at the bottom,” she glanced
a little superciliously at the buxom lady
with the trumpet, “as a matter of
fact, she isn't a fairy at all. I don't
quite know what she is, an angel per-
haps, but not a fairy, certainly not a
fairy. But the others are, of course."
She glanced at me a little defiantly
with her bright eyes. - “Surely, my
dear, I ought to know a fairy when I
see one. At the time when these were
done they were perfectly all right; they
only want bringing up to date, like the
pictures inside, that 's all. Now you
will see whether you can do anything,
won't you?” -
It was difficult to refuse, but I didn't
feel very hopeful.
“I’ll try,” I said. “I’ll write to
the Editor; but I'm afraid it's not
very likely that he will do anything in
the matter. You see the cover's been
like that for years and years. Almost
ever since Punch began. It's—well,
it's part of the Punch tradition. We
all love it. Nobody would like to see
it altered; it wouldn't seem the same
thing.”
The Fairy Queen was busy with her
cloak and didn't pay much attention to
what I was saying,
“Won't you stay a little longer and
have some tea or something?” I begged.
She shook her head.
“A chocolate 2''
She smiled. “I can't resist a choco-
late,” she said. She took a very little
one and nibbled at it daintily, flitting
about the room meanwhile and chatter-
ing away in the friendliest fashion in
her tiny high voice.
“I must go,” she said at last. “I
have enjoyed it so much. May I come
again some day? I should love to
come again.” . . .
I went out with her into the little
lobby and down the stairs, and stood
at the hall door to watch her go.
“Now don't forget,” were her last
words as she floated out into the night.
“Tell him, tell him exactly what we
really look like.”
“I can't,” I called after her desper-
ately; “I can't.”
But she had already disappeared in
the soft haze. I went slowly up the
stairs and back to my quiet room and
the dying fire.
“I can't,” I said again.

THE MURMANSK MOSQUITO.
My particular interest having been
aroused by descriptions recently pub-
lished in the English Press of the
Murmansk mosquito, I made a point,
on my arrival in North Russia with
the Relief Force, of collecting further
data from officers whose experience
entitles them to speak with authority
upon the habits of the local fauna.
From them I have gathered some
curious information which should in-
terest even those whose enthusiasm for
the phenomena of natural history is
normally but languid, and cannot fail to
intrigue not only the entomologist but
also the big game hunter, who would
find it well worth his while to observe
As evidence of the determination of
their attacks, veterans of this front
have pointed out to me, in the walls of
local buildings, massive timbers which
have been scarred and splintered by
the teeth and claws of these monsters,
emboldened by hunger and incensed
by resistance. -
The peculiar ferocity of the mosquito
of these high latitudes is, of course, ac-
counted for by the brevity of its actual
life. Immured throughout the pro-
longed winter within its icy sarcopha-
gus, it is not released before the middle
of June, while the premature severity of
August rapidly lowers its vitality. Such
is its offensive spirit during the first
relaxation of wintry rigour that it is
dangerous in the extreme for anyone
gun. It is proposed to detail certain
anti-aircraft batteries to deal with high-
flying swarms, while a young friend
of my own, who was with a special
company of the R.E. in France, is pre-
pared to design a haversack projector
for issue to all ranks. But against this
it is urged by those familiar with North
Russian towns in summer that nothing
of such a nature can materially damage
the moral of the local mosquito.
Thrilling stories are told of escapes
from these dangerous brutes. A senior
officer of notoriously full habit of body,
having attracted the attention of several
immerse specimens, was by them sur-
rounded in his office, and rescued only
just in time by the gallant efforts of an
allied fatigue party which the besieged

of this sagacious and
formidable insect.
Judging from the
evidence at my com-
mand the true Mur-
mansk mosquito is
considerably larger
and fiercer than the
Archangel variety,
owing no doubt to the
genial influence of the
Gulf Stream. Both
types are however
sufficiently ferocious,
and, save when ren-
dered comatose by ex-
cess of nutrition, will
attack human beings
without provocation.
The female of the
species, if disturbed
while accompanied by
her young, will invari-

THAT audacious paraphrase of the Book of Job, The
Undying Fire (CASSELL), seems to me to be marred by a
fundamentally false note. I am sure that Mr. WELLs is as
serious about his new God in the Heart of Man as he was
about the Invisible King—I’ve no sort of intention of
sneering—but I cannot credit him with belief in the
Adversary, who by arrangement with the Almighty (as set
forth in a discreetly flippant prologue with something of
the flavour of those irreverent yarns invented and retailed
by Italian ecclesiastics about Dominiddio) visits Job Huss,
the headmaster of Woldingstanton, with the plagues of his
desperate trial. However I take it that the author was
anxious that his parody should be as complete in form as
possible, and, being rather impressed by the insouciance,
not to say insolence, of the Satan of the original, seized his
chance of bizarre characterisation and “celestial badinage”
and let consistency go hang for the time. Certainly the
theological disquisitions of Mr. WELLs are remarkable not
for their formal logic, but for their provocative quality
and the very real eloquence of detached passages of the
rambling argument. In particular, taking up again the
thread of Joan and Peter, he gives such a survey of the
Scope and glories of a new education that is to salve the
world's wounds as would move the heart of a jelly-fish.
Mr. WELLs has his own methods of justifying the ways of
God to man. He may be discursive, impatient, rash, per-
haps a little shallow, but he has an undying fire of his
own. He is certainly not dull. And therefore orthodox
divines and pedagogues may perhaps have a real grievance
against him. But I can't imagine any serious-minded man
in a serious time reading this book and not getting hope
and courage from it.
Victory Over Blindness (HopDER AND StoughtoN) is a
book whose title gives you at once the key to its contents
and to the spirit that animates them. It is the record by
Sir ARTHUR PEARSoN of one of the most finely successful
enterprises that the War has called forth. Everyone
to-day has at least a vague idea of the work carried on at
St. Dunstan's, “the biggest individual business,” Sir ARTHUR
terms it, “that I have ever conducted.” A study of these
pages will transform that vague idea into wonder and
admiration. Big the business might well be called, since
it is nothing less than the bringing back, almost to normal
life, of men apparently condemned to an existence of helpless
inactivity and dependence. Few things will strike you
more forcibly in this book than its practical common-sense.
That and an unsentimental optimism seem to be the
dominant notes of all Sir ARTHUR's effort. Without doubt
the success of this has been beyond measure helped by
the fact that the originator was himself a sharer in the
adversity that it was designed to lessen. Two chapters
especially in the book, called “Learning to be Blind,”
a brief manual of practical suggestions by one whom experi-
ence has rendered expert, supply a clue to the difference
between the work at St. Dunstan's and the best-intentioned
efforts of outside sympathy. Victory Over Blindness is a
proud and rewarding motto; this little volume will show
how thoroughly it has been earned.

She was once roused to the
action of destroying the manu-

though, as a reviewer, I may
applaud this achievement on
general grounds, it provided no

Small Brother (to rejected lover). “BUT, John, DiDN'T You TELL HER You'd PLAYE” For Essex?"
THE POET.
IN a distant country, at a remote
epoch, was born of humble parents a
poet. “Born "advisedly, since the poet
is always born, not made. Even before
he could write he composed little poems,
which he would recite aloud. The simple
pleasures of the poor, among whom he
grew up—intoxication, pugilism, funeral
merry-makings—furnished the themes
of his verse.
Upon reaching man's estate he adopted
the calling of night-watchman, an oc-
cupation which provided him at once
with a livelihood and ample opportuni-
ties for meditation. It is to this period
that the “Nocturnes” belong.
Now it happened that the poet's work
reached the eye of the Prince, who,
anxious to encourage genius, appointed
him to some minor place about Court
and endowed it with a pension. More-
over, to complete his happiness he gave
him in marriage a beautiful and accom-
plished maiden, for whom the poet had
long cherished an ardent but hopeless
passion. So, as by enchantment, the
course of the poet's existence was
changed. He no longer waked while
others slept. On the contrary he seldom
left his couch until a late hour in the
morning, and when at last he rose it
was often to pass the rest of the day in
a Turkish bath.
Yet in spite of altered circumstances
he still remained a poet, for the poet is
born, not made, or unmade. The tenor
of his poetry however was changed.
Instead of the rude and vigorous sub-
jects which formerly engaged his lyre
he would now employ his art in verse of
the daintiest, to celebrate flowers, ladies'
eyebrows and similar trivialities.
This style however was not altogether
to the taste of the munificent Prince.
He had expected something stronger,
something more in the grand manner.
So he consulted a Wise Man, an adept
in the ways of poets, one greatly in
demand as a writer of biographical pre-
faces to poetical reprints.
The Wise Man heard him to the end
and replied as follows: “Sire, you have
been ill-advised. Who ever heard of
a happy poet? Poetry and prosperity
are incompatible. Instead of trying to
make your protégé joyful you should
have heaped sorrow upon him. It is
well known that sorrow ennobles a
man and enlarges his emotional experi.
ence. “Poets learn in suffering what
they teach in song' sang one of them
who knew.
“However it is not too late. When
next he seeks your Presence, indicate
to him with that tact which is the
birthright of princes that he no longer
enjoys your favour. At the same time
stop his pension and allow him to taste
once more the life from which your
bounty removed him. Could you con-
trive that he loses the affection of his
wife, and that he falls into a consump-
tion, so much the better. In addition,
if it please your Highness, I will arrange
that all his work is unfavourably noticed
in the Press and that calumnies con-
cerning his private life are circulated
in the personal paragraph columns.”
“Thanks very much,” said the Prince,
and dismissed the Wise Man with a
handsome fee.
A few days later, when the poet pre-
sented himself at Court, the monarch
rose from his throne, took a short
run and kicked him in a vulnerable
part. Breathless the poet was borne
by lackeys from the royal presence,
wherein he never again showed himself.
At the next meeting of the Council the
Prince annulled his pension by a stroke
of the pen. Thus the poet was thrust
back into the cold world.
Now began a period for him of intense
unhappiness. Having lost his old busi-

ness connection he could no longer
obtain employment in his original vo-
cation. He had therefore no alterna-
tive to avert starvation but to follow
the precarious calling of a cab-runner.
These events, it will be recalled, hap-
pened in a bygone age, before the motor
superseded the horse. Often, after a
weary trail half across the town behind
a luggage-laden cab, only to find that the
family kept a man-servant, he would
return to the cellar that was now his
home, penniless and exhausted.
Long hours spent over the washtub,
to eke out their scanty earnings, had
rendered his wife—once the “Fay” of
the “Love Songs”—both muscular and
short-tempered. On such occasions she
would lay hands on the poet and thrash
him till he wept. But throughout all
he remained a poet, for the poet is born
not made. Every tear in falling turned
to a sonnet. His sorrows were trans-
muted into poems—poems now suffused
with the concentrated emotion of the
human race. . -
Nevertheless each one as it appeared
was brutally slated in the organs con-
trolled by the literary adviser to the
Crown and himself belittled and ridi-
culed. When, as luck would have it,
his wife eloped with a wrestler, a flood
of melody poured from his soul which,
connoisseurs have assured us, ranks
high amongst the lyrical masterpieces
of the world. These werses will be
found amongst the collection known as
“Swan Songs,” published posthum-
ously, for, not long after, the poet un-
fortunately developed phthisis and died.
But though he was thus cut off in
early manhood his name will live for
ever. It is borne by a square in the
boarding-house quarter of the capital
and by a cravat which, though, alas,
no longer in the fashion, is still worn
every Sunday by countless artisans.
His poems too have achieved im-
mortality. Showily bound they make
a favourite school prize and have given
entertainment to generations of cul-
tured refined persons, who have never
paused in their reading to give a thought
to the author of their enjoyment, the
sagacious Prince to whose action they
owe their emotional treat. His Royal
Highness's reward was his own aesthetic
satisfaction. “By Heaven, this is more
like,” he rapturously exclaimed as he
laid down the last volume of the col-
lected works; “this verse has got some
stuff in it.” And on the occasion of
his next birthday he conferred the
Companionship of a Household Order
upon the poet's publisher.

soreness.”—Daily Sketch.

THE MUD LARKS.
“Gurr finny,” says T. Atkins, and
there seems no doubt about the well-
known War being over at last. Home-
keeping folk, who imagine it ended
when the whistle blew at the eleventh
hour of November 11th, are wide, very
wide, of the mark. We have experi-
enced some of its direst horrors since
then. Why, at one time (and not so
long ago) we were without the bare
necessities of life itself.
I have seen hardy old soldiers, banded
like zebras with wound-stripes and
field-service chevrons, offering to barter
a perfectly good horse for a packet of
Ruby Queen cigarettes, or swap a
battery of Howitzers for a flagon of
Scotch methylated. Then came the
Great Downfall. Nabobs, who for years
had been purring about back areas in
with sledge-hammers to test whether
they be really duds or no.
Although a very courageous man, I
do not linger in their whereabouts unless
I have to. I don't follow their line of
thought. One of them unearthed a
MILLs bomb the other day. It gave off
blue smoke and fizzed prettily. When
last seen he was holding it to the ear of
a chum, who was smiling entrancedly,
as a child smiles at the croon of a
conch-shell.
By the way, whilst we are on the
subject, who is this MILLs? The
illustrated papers have shown us THE
MAN who won THE war, the thousand-
and-one sole and only inventors of
Tinribs the Tank; their prattle-pages
are crammed daily with portraits of
war-worn flag-sellers, heroic O.B.E.'s,
and so on; but what of our other bene-
factors, the names of whom are far more
British material they have not already
pinched. Yesterday he came upon a
fatigue party of Gauls staggering down
a by-way under the shell of an Arm-
strong hut. He whooped and gave
chase. The Gauls, sighting the A.P.M.
brassard, promptly dumped the hut and
dived through a wire fence. Sherlock
hitched his horse to a post and followed
afoot, snorting fire and brimstone. They
led him at a smart trot over four acres
of boggy plough, through a brambly
plantation, two prickly hedges and a
richly-perfumed drain and went to
ground inextricably in some mine build-
ings. He returned, blown, battered and
baffled, to the starting-point, to find
that some third party had in the mean-
time removed the Armstrong hut—also
his horse.

regularities, such as running the wrong
way or dry. Here, on the fringe of the
old battle-grounds, only the merest
handful of us remain, deserted by the
field armies, apparently forgotten by
the management. -
It has happened before. Bob, our
Camp Commandant, swears that a
battalion of his regiment, while garri-
soning some ocean isle, got mislaid for
years and years, and they would have
been there to this day, chatting to the
crabs and watering the palm-trees with
their tears, if some junior subaltern
had not sent his birthday-book to
KITCHENER with the request that the
Field-Marshal would inscribe some
verses therein.

good for theirs. He lives, he and his
cat, deep in the château woods in a
tiny semi-subterranean cabin he has
constructed of odds and ends of tin and
tar-paper. He was supposed to have
been demobilised ages ago, but we can-
not get him off the premises.
Bob goes and interviews him on the
subject about three times a day—all to
no avail. “'Tain't a bit o' use you
comin'an' flappin' them there paperses
at me, Mister” (all officers, irrespective
of rank, are “Mister” to Violet), says
he to Bob; “you know very well I
aren't no scholard an' I won't sign
nothin' I can't read, even if I could
sign, which I can't, bein’ no scholard;
so there's the end of it, as I've told
you scores of times before, with all due
respect, of course, as the sayin' is.”
He doesn't want to go home and he
won't go home, he says. His wife
beats him “somethink crool,” he says;
in fact he never knew what real peace
meant until war broke out. Further-
more she has been putting on a lot of
muscle of late and demobilisation means
certain death. He is going to stay
where he is. What with the ginger
cat's poaching proclivities and the bully
beef he has buried in the plantation he
can hold out almost indefinitely, he says;
so there is no cause for us to be anxious
on his behalf. When we come back
for the next war we shall find him on
the old stand, ready to resume busi-
ness, he says, and for his part the next
war can't break out any too soon.
The remainder of Bob's time, as I
said before, is occupied in trying to
square his establishment returns. Some
time ago he discovered that he was a
water-cart short. This was serious,
very. A water-cart is a large and ex-
pensive item, and as far as he could
see it would end in his having to make
good the loss out of his own pocket,
which at that moment contained ten
centimes and a corkscrew.
However he was determined he would
see what a little applied cunning would
do first. He locked himself into his
office and took thought. After an hour's
violent mental disturbance he penned a
letter to the authorities, saying that his
establishment was complete in all de-
tails, with the exception of one water-
bottle. As, however, he had come by
several superfluous knives, spoons and
forks considerably exceeding the water-
bottle in value, might they be taken in
exchange and the account squared 2
The Government would be greatly the
gainer thereby.
Four days later he was notified that
the transaction was approved. After
waiting till he was reasonably certain
that the correspondence was safely lost,
burnt or consigned to impenetrable
archives, he sent the following wire:—
“Reference my R.L.217, dated April
1st, for ‘bottle 'read “cart.'"

THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS;
or, THE FIGHT AGAINST REACTION.
MY DEAR KNoTT,--It has occurred to me that since the
closing of our little V.A.D. depôt there is a good deal of
energy in Filby without a suitable outlet, and I am writing
to you on the matter as I feel sure you will have some
helpful suggestion to make.
Of course a great deal of this energy might be profitably
expended on the ever-increasing spiritual needs of the parish,
but I feel that if some society of a secular character were
got up just now it would be helpful, especially to the
female portion of our community. * .
Miss Timlin has suggested a Philatelic Society, and I
shall be pleased to hear your views on her proposal.
Believe me, Yours ever sincerely,
THEoDore BLAND.
DEAR VicAR,--I have your letter and quite agree as to
the advisability of starting some society for working off the
latent energy which has accumulated since the demise of
the War and the consequent closing down of War activi-
ties. I do not however fancy Philately as a safety-valve.
1 suppose one could stand up to stick stamps in a book,
and would get a certain amount of physical exercise in going
about swapping duds and duplicates, but generally speaking
it is a sedentary occupation and, to my mind, a selfish one.
As you ask for a suggestion from me, I propose an
Archaeological Society. The pursuit of Archaeology has this
advantage: it connotes digging, an aptitude for which has
been distinctly fostered here by the allotment habit.
As for our objective, without going further than Filby
there is the alleged tunnel leading from the ruins of the
nunnery to no one knows where. It would be interesting
to know whether the thirteenth-century Lord of Filby had
a private way (on the score of feudalities) to the Ursuline
convent, or whether the good nuns had a back-way to the
Old Swan for the conveyance of mead, sack and such other
strong waters as the times and licensing laws afforded.
But perhaps the tunnel, like most things, is controlled, and
a mandamus (which, I take it, is a kind of ecclesiastical
coupon) would be required before we could touch it.
Of course there are a mound and the foundations of an
old wall in my paddock which the Society are welcome to
tackle. Don't you think they would do to begin on ?
Yours sincerely, Anchip ALD C. KNott.
MY DEAR KNott, Many thanks for your valuable help.
I think you may expect quite a good turn up of members
on Tuesday. I have always thought that the tumulus in
your field might yield some interesting archaeological find.
The land and a former mansion were part of the Convent
demesne, as you probably know. I am sorry that I shall
not be present as I have to attend the Bishop's Conference
at Braychester, which is expected to last a week or two.
Wishing you all success and with kind regards to yourself
and Mrs. Knott, - -
I am, Yours ever sincerely, THEODoRE BLAND.
MY DEAR WICAR,--Thanks for yours. I am very sorry
you have been called away at such a time. -
The first meeting was so successful that a second was
fixed for Wednesday. But enthusiasm seemed to flag on
Wednesday evening, as nothing of interest had been
discovered.
A few die-hards agreed to put in some hours' digging on
Thursday, when Colonel Stacey and Mrs. Cottingham each
dug up a Roman bronze coin (both denarii, I fancy) from
the mound. This of course acted as a great stimulant, and
we had a bumper meeting on Friday. Stacey, I under-
stand, intends to read a paper, at the first indoor meeting
of the society, on the Roman occupation of Filby-in-the-
Wold. The mound is now levelled, and the wall founda-
tions have all been dug up and carted away; but the latter
yielded nothing of interest.
Hoping that the Conference is going as you would wish,
I am, Yours sincerely, ARCHIBALD C. KNott.
P.S.—Couldn't you touch up the Bishop on the subject
of the Convent tube?
DEAR WICAR,-We have had an archaeological strike.
The mound is levelled, the wall foundations have disap-
peared, and so have the diggers. I am afraid the Society
are now awaiting your return to give them a lead. My
grounds, alas, have produced nothing beyond the two denarii.
Yours sincerely, ARCHIBALD C. KNoTT.
[E.ctract.]
DEAR Boy, Your mother and I are delighted that you
will be demobbed in about a week from now . . . By the
way you will be glad to hear that we can start making that
second tennis-court in the paddock as soon as you get back.
I have had the remains of what was known as Knott's
Folly in your great-grandfather's day removed, at a total
cost of two denarii (which had been lying in a drawer in my
dressing-room for years); not so bad, considering the pre-
sent cost of labour. But of this more anon.
Your affectionate FATHER,
A CRICKET BARGAIN.
(Before the match.)
WE meet as foes, my James, this summer weather,
But sterner summers saw us twain in league ;
Shoulder to shoulder have we stood together
On Q.M.S. fatigue.
So, when (ninth wicket down) to-day I enter
Upon my tenure of the crease and gaze
Nervously at you, having taken centre,
Remember bygone days.
Abate your skill, so shall my nerves grow firmer,
Till driving seems the easiest of jobs,
And passers-by shall pause and haply murmur,
“Golly, can that be Hobițs?”
Do this for me, and you'll discover later
How fame awaits the generous and good;
A few long hops shall win a glory greater
Than ever break-back could.
If for a ball or two you let me smite you,
Running amok with dashing bat and bold,
My Muse shall have instructions to requite you
Even an hundredfold.
You shall she hymn in strains that do not ſalter,
Proclaim of you for all who run to read:—
“He sacrificed his length on friendship's altar;
He was a pal indeed.”
FOR THE CHILDREN.
At this season, when their own children are already
counting the days that lie between them and their holidays,
Mr. Punch appeals to his kind readers not to forget the
greater needs of the children in our elementary schools.
The cost of sending them away to the sea or countryside
for fresh air and change of scene is constantly increasing
and the Children's Country Holidays Fund cannot keep
up its good work without generous help. There can be no
better way of making a Peace-offering than by helping to
build up the health and strength of the new generation.
Mr. Punch begs that liberal gifts may be sent to the Secre.
tary of the Fund at 18, Buckingham Street, Strand, W.C.2.

Doubt[Ess you have often heard
Of the thrush, that gladsome bird,
Who will warble any day,
Be it cold or wet or gray.
I suppose her mother taught her
That the worms are fond of water,
So that neither sleet nor slush
Bridles that eupeptic thrush.
Such a one was Johnny Carr
(Sub-Lieutenant R.N.R.).
I have never caught him yet
Out of sorts when it was wet ;
He will hum when tempests howl,
Whistle midst the thunder's growl,
And I've seen him sing for joy,
Clinging to a punctured buoy,
While his gallant T.B.D.
Sank beside him in the sea.
No one knows exactly when or
Why he came to call it tenor,
But the fact remains he sang
With a subtle nasal twang
Just because he liked to do so
(He was Carr, but not CARUso),
And with such a force of lung
That, whatever tune he sung,
It was like a projectile
With a range of twenty mile.

On that memorable day,
Flitting like a restless ghost
Somewhere off the Danish coast,
His destroyer, all agog,
Butted through the clinging fog,
When for just a space the gray
Mists of morning rolled away.
Ah! but how their pulses beat
When they saw the High Seas Fleet
Nosing noiseless as a diet m
Barely half-a-mile abeam :
Then the filmy mists anew
Blotted everything from view.
John, astounded at the sight,
Sang aloud with all his might.
But the German, seeing nought,
Only hearing what he thought
Must be twelve-inch guns at least
Firing at him from the Last,
Felt that it was time to hook it,
Saw his chance and boldly took it.
Northward fast he sailed once more
Till he heard the Lion roar,
And before he could retreat he
Found himself engaged with BEATTY,
Who, as you already know,
Led him on to JELLICoE.
There I leave him, for, you see,
All the rest is history.

WHEN the deadly sky-rover
Came frequently over
And London was darkened at night,
Girls powdered their noses
(Or so one supposes)
As lamp-posts were painted with

But now when full moons
Bring no bombs or maroons,
I ask is it proper or right?
Amanda's complexion
Will challenge inspection—
'Tis healthy and rosy and fine;
But she says that if powder
Were never allowed her
Her nose would infallibly shine.
Did Victorian Flossie
Or Gladys, when glossy
Of nose, to such methods incline 2
No, they patiently scrubbed it,
Rough-towelled and rubbed it
Until it was brought into line.
We have long been acquainted
With ladies who painted
To mimic a juvenile mien;
But I'd ban sans compassion
The powdering fashion
When practised by sweet seven-
teen ;
And I wish that wise mothers
And sensible brothers
Would let their abhorrence be seen.
I'm only “a father,”
Old-fashioned and rather
Deficient in stiffness of spine,
So, feeling unequal
To facing the sequel,
My name I'm unwilling to sign;
For the call for more powder
Grows stronger and louder

And any restriction
Of puffs or nose-friction
Would end in a general “shine.”

inclines to the view that Sir ERIC

position for quite a number of weeks,
will succeed Mr. FISHER. Some experts
however hold that the PREMIER has a
magnificent opportunity for displaying
his imagination by the choice of Mr.

recent astounding allegation of General
WILsoN that the War could not have

The chief objection to Mr. WELLs, how-

because he is not already in office; and
this drawback also operates in the case
of Mr. SMILLIE and Mr. BottomLEY.
In this context it is to be noted that
Lord READING (so at least we under-

is much disappointed that the claims
of Mr. T. P. O'Connor to the post of

not been conciliated by this strange

PLAYING THE 18TH-LAST Round of THE DAY.
“You Food, CADDIE How can I PLAY FROM THAT LIE witH A wooden CLUB?”
“SoBRY, SIR.
I've JUST CLEANED THE IRONs.”
THE ROOFS OF THE MIGHTY.
AT the meeting held recently in the
hall of the Worshipſul Company of
Hatters in Tile Street, the Chair was
taken jointly (as in the old monarchical
days at Brentford) by the Bishop of
LINcoLN and Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT, and
among the company were the SPEAKER,
Lord RIBBLEs DALE, Sir SQUIRE BAN-
CROFT, Mr. WINston CHURCHILL and
Mr. EUGENE Corri. -
The two Chairmen, speaking almost
in unison, stated that the meeting had
been convened in order that the views
of the enlightened might be gathered re-
garding the proposed revival of the tall
hat or topper. A recrudescence of this
form of covering for the hair (or other-
wise) was threatened under the name
of the Victory Derby, and a paragraph
in The Times announced that “so re-
markable has been the revival in the
silk-hat trade that old men who had
gone into retirement in the Denton and
Stockport districts are being asked to
come back and give what productive
energy they possess.” What the meet-
ing desired to ascertain was the views
as to this revival that were held by
those empowered to offer opinions.
Lord RIBBLESDALE said that there
was no doubt that a tall hat was the
most becoming headgear for a gentle-
man. But a certain regard for idiosyn-
cracies was important. No gentleman
should take without scrutiny what the
hatter offered. Hats were individual
things, and as the character changed
and developed so should the hat. The
hat that suited one at forty might be a
sad anachronism at fifty. He himself
had endeavoured not only to make
his life correspond to his hats, but
his hats correspond to his life. (Loud
applause.) As the Master of the Buck.
hounds he wore, as any visitor to
the National Gallery at the present
moment might see, at the head of the
staircase on the left, a tall hat that
was slightly lower than that which he
wore to-day, now that he had re-
liquished that responsible and romantic
post. He urged his hearers to en-
courage the silk hat revival.
Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT concurred with
the illustrious nobleman who had just
spoken. The choice of a hat should be
the subject of the most earnest thought,
even of prayer. (Cheers.) Not only.
the shape but the colour. There were
hats that were black and hats that were
white. (Shouts of “Hurrah!”) There
were even white hats with black trim-
ming. (Sensation.) The older he grew
the more convinced he was that an
Englishman's hat was his castle.
Miss DAISY ASHFord, author of The
Young Visiters, said that she was all in
favour of the top hat. No one who had
read her famous novel could doubt that.
In the society of Mr. Salteena and his
friends to wear a tall hat was always
the idear.
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL said that
none of the speakers had mentioned
the most essential desideratum of a
hat, and that was that it should be too
small. Whether it began by being too
small, or became in time too small,
depended upon the wearer; but there
was something smug and cowardly
about a hat that fitted. It suggested
failure.
Mr. H. B. IRVING said that he was
an impenitent advocate of the soft or
Southern hat. It was the duty of a
hat to afford not only covering for the
head but shelter for the eyes, and no
topper did this. A hat should have a
flexible brim, which neither topper nor
bowler possessed. It was absurd to
wear a hat which could not sustain
damage without showing it. Let there
be a revival in the silk-hat industry by
all means, but there must be no im-

position of any one kind of hat on the
public. The individual must be allowed
perfect freedom to wear what he liked.
(Hear, hear!) He personally hoped
never to be seen either in a pith helmet
or a Tam-o'-shanter, but if the whim
took him to wear either—or indeed
both—he claimed the right to do so.
(Loud cheers.) Meanwhile he should
adhere to his soft hat.
Mr. MASKELYNE, who followed, urged
upon the company the desirability of
the silk-hat mode. If tall hats, he
said, went out of fashion, what would
become of conjurers ? Rabbits could
be satisfactorily extracted only from
tall hats. (Prolonged cheering.) An
omelette made in a sombrero was
unthinkable. (Renewed cheering.)
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT said that all
this talk about toppers was pernicious
nonsense. The topper had become
obsolete and should not be disinterred.
The only honest form of hat for an
honest straightforward man was a
white bowler. A white bowler and a
blue serge suit made as stylish and
effective a garb as anyone needed.
Soft hats no doubt were comfortable,
but they were also slovenly. Moreover
they were not practical. At a horse
sale, for example, you could not rattle
them. As for the plea that tall hats
were of value to conjurers, he had no
use for such arguments. Conjurers
dealt in illusion and all illusion was
retrograde. (Oh! Oh!) - *
The Bishop of LINCOLN said that he
felt bound to dissociate himself from
his partner's remarks. He himself
looked upon a silk hat as an essential.
(A voice, “With rigging?”) Yes, Sir,
with rigging. But that was not wh
he advocated it. He advocated it be-
cause it was the proper coping-stone
of a gentleman.
The SPEAKER, after eulogising the
white tall hat, added that although he
was glad that they had Sir SQUIRE BAN-
CROFT with them (Hear, hear) he was
bound to remark that not infrequently
of late he had seen that illustrious
histrion wearing in the streets of Lon-
don a cloth cap more suitable to the
golf-links or the Highlands. For the
devotee of the white hat of a blameless
life thus to descend gave him pain. So.

he contended, should not trifle with its
top-storey. (Cheers.)
... Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT, rising again,
expressed regret that his cloth cap ||
should have caused any distress. He
wore it, he was bound to admit, for
convenience (Oh!) and comfort (Sensa-
tion). But he would not offend again.
(Loud cheers.) - - -
At this point the meeting adjourned,
but doubtless, taking a hint from the
Coal inquiry, it will often be resumed
during the coming year.
“I Zingari will play a Household Cavalry
team at Windsor on Saturday, June 21st.

wards.”—Local Paper.
Apart from the interest this paragraph
will excite in the historians of the
Army, the Turf, and the Cricket-field, it
shows that HENRY VIII. must have
been a more indulgent father than is
generally suspected.

AT THE PLAY.
“L’AIGLON.”
IN a note given away with the pro-
gramme Mr. Louis N. PARKER describes
L'Aiglon as “the Hamlet of the nine-
teenth century.” Certainly they had in
common the habits of introspection and
indecision; but the egoism of Hamlet
was at least tempered by a knowledge of
the world; he was a student; he had tra-
velled and seen men and things outside
the bounds of Elsinore; and he was
capable of throwing off some quotable
generalities out of his stock of philo-
sophy. On the other hand the Eaglet,
mewed in his Austrian cage, knew
nothing of life at large, and had small
chance of learning anything beyond
the bowdlerised history which his
tutors and warders thought good to
have him stuffed with. -
Somehow he had contrived surrep-
titiously to pick up the dates and
leading facts of his father's campaigns
(making a speciality of the Battle of
Wagram), but the vague ambitions
which they inspired only helped his lit-
tle mind to prey upon itself. It was
not “the times” (as with Hamlet) but
his own nose that he found to be “out
of joint.”
The appeal of Hamlet is to the intel-
ligence; that of L'Aiglon, so obviously
pathetic in his own eyes, is rather to
the heart. Indeed the intelligence of
the audience is here often in trouble;
for a certain acquaintance with history
is required and both actors and stage-
management offer little aid to the aver-
| age ignorance. While the more obvious
and melodramatic situations—such as
the death of L'Aiglon or the business
of the sentry—are treated at great
leisure, it is assumed that all historical
allusions, however necessary to an
understanding of the situation, will be
as tedious to the audience as to the
players, and they are rushed through—
as in the mirror scene—at a pace that
baffles our halting pursuit.
If any male character lends itself to
interpretation by a woman, it is such
a character as L'Aiglon, who, for all
his spasms of martial ardour, was half
feminine. And to this side of him, and
not this side alone, Miss MARIE Löhr
did justice in a performance of which
her high spirit had not underrated the
difficulties. But it is a long and exigent
part, and there were times in the play
when her physical strength was over-
taxed. It would have taken the voice
of a strongish basso to drown the roar
of a whole battlefield of ghostly war-
riors, with a military band thrown in.
I am not sure that Miss LöHR quite
realised for us the Duke of Reichstadt's
personality. I should not care to have
the task myself, for a good many com-
plicated elements were mixed in his
nature. As Mr. Louis PARKER reminds
you, a French father supplied him with
ambition and love of action, an Austrian
grandfather with hesitancy, and Spanish
ancestors with fatalism, a very trying
combination for even the original Eaglet
to handle—a mere boy who had never
so much as heard of President WILSON's
League of Nations. So it was excusable
if Miss LöHR failed to make us com-
pletely realise a personality which was
almost certainly too much for the com-
prehension of its actual owner.
But she was always an intriguing
figure. Perhaps, indeed—for the ap-
parel does not always proclaim the
man, and the Eaglet was no Hamlet in
THE LITTLE EAGLE TRIES TO FILY.
MISS MARIE LöHR.
the matter of his clothes—her rather
striking costumes were a source of too
much distraction.
In a very large cast, whose identities
were here and there a little shadowy,
the interest was so distributed that
nobody except Miss LöHR had very
much chance. But Mr. FISHER WHITE
made a touching picture of the weak
old Austrian Emperor, torn between
love of his grandchild and fear of Met-
ternich. Mettermich himself, in the
person of Mr. HENRY WIBART, seemed
hardly sinister enough for the part he
had to play in keeping the Eaglet under
the talons of the “two-headed fowl.”
But it is perhaps difficult to look really
sinister in the full official uniform of a
Chancellor.
Mr. LYN HARDING, as Flambeau,
veteran of NAPOLEON's Army, intro-
duced a faint suggestion of badly-
needed humour, and relieved the general
atmosphere of Court artificiality by a
touch of nature which almost recon-
ciled us to the improbable burst of
eloquence that Rosta ND, with his reck.
less prodigality, assigned to this rough
soldier.
Miss LETTICE FAIRFAx gave a pleas.
ant air of irresponsibility to the shallow
Maria Louisa, and made her bear very
lightly her cross of widowhood (with
bar). The briefest possible vision of
Miss BETTY FAIRE as Fanny Elssler
made me want to see much more of
her; but Mr. Louis PARKER had been
Napoleonically ruthless with the text.
His translation sounded well, though
the delivery of it sometimes left me
doubtful as to what was prose and what
was verse. As for his production of
the play, it showed the old skill of a
Past-Master of Pageantry.
Altogether Miss MARIE LöHR has
been justified of her courage. In a
happy little speech, from which we
learnt that every one of the voices (off)
in the Wagram scene was a demobilised
voice from the fighting fronts, she told
us that her revival of L'Aiglon was
intended as a tribute to Art after all
these years of War. We were not, I
think, meant to take this as a reflection
upon the part played by the British
Theatre in sustaining the nation's soul
during the War. Anyhow, I for one
shall read into her words just a brave
promise—not, I hope, too sanguine—of
what we may expect from the new
birth of the Arts of Peace. O. S.
ANOTHER PENDING INDEMNITY.
IT has been said that the man who
for his daily shave resorts habitually to
a barber has already become a subject
for a drastic moral operation. That may
or may not be so, but having chambers
in Ryder Street and Alphonse residing
within the precincts of St. James's, I
would rather have been carved morally
into mincemeat than have robbed such
an artist of his self-expression. . .
That is how I felt about it in 1914
and in many preceding years, during
which, under the magic spell of Al-
honse, the razor ſell upon my cheek
like thistledown. Even to be lathered
by him was an alluring form of hypno-
sis. Alphonse was a Hokusai of barbers,
but he was also a true son of France;
and there" were Alsace and Lorraine
and the arrogance of 1870 still to be
accounted for. So Alphonse went, and
in his place reigned Ferdinand.
Ferdinand, what there was of him,
was a good fellow. He was an old fire-
eater. He had lost a leg in Algeria
and an eye somewhere else, and he
could not comprehend why such trivial
matters should disqualify a man for
killing pigs. He was, as I have said, a

good fellow, but his methods of using
a razor were mediaeval. However we
were not long for one another, and, as
| the R.N.V.R. tolerate such things, I
grew a beard, an equable, regulation
torpedo beard.
Omitting several super-emotional life-
times, let us speak of a certain day not
very remote when I stood, bereft of all
sea power, at the top of St. James's
Street, considering what was the very
| best worst thing to do to a body which
was bored with the reaction that follows
four years' strife upon the narrow seas.
I fingered my beard meditatively. Yes,
after all there was Alphonse. I had al-
most forgotten him. I turned my steps
towards his exclusive retreat. I entered
in, and behold ! there as of yore, clothed
in his samite raiment, stood the incom-
parable Alphonse. He had returned.
Yet in appearance he was not quite the
Alphonse of old. There was something
less resilient about him, something
more enduring had crept into his per-
sonality; his elasticity had somehow
turned to bronze. He was slightly grey.
Nevertheless he greeted me with a
Gallic warmth that gave refreshment
to my jaded spirit. -
“But M'sieu would be shaved . . . .
Yes, a beard was permissible in time
of War, but in Peace—pouf! it was
barbaric.”
I allowed myself to be robed and
tucked comfortably into the chair. Al-
phonse busied himself with the instru-
ments of his profession.
“Five years ago it was another world,
M'sieu,” he said, churning a wooden
bowl to mountains of lather. “It is
never again the same. The Marne .
Verdun .
mits I would like to tell him of those
years.”
I nodded and he advanced upon me
with the brush. He spoke of the retreat
to Paris and the strategy of Jorfire
which so nearly overthrew three Prus-
sian armies. He brandished his razor
and swept the Boches back over the
Marne, he swept them through Senlis,
he swept them across the Aisne. His
intensity was inspiring. The smoulder-
ing fires of bygone battles leapt into
his eyes. But it was not the mesmeric
shave of 1914. He apologised humbly
and applied small pieces of plaster.
The next morning we fought a sway-
ing battle in front of Rheims, and for
... Soissons. If M'sieu per-
some few following mornings we skir-
mished about painlessly in the same
vicinity. Then came a sanguinary ex-
cursion to Flanders which nearly put
me into blue overalls. -
A few weeks of trench warfare gave
me some respite and allowed my worst
wounds to heal.
Then came the epic of Verdun. At
least it was to have come, but at the
last moment I lost my nerve.
To hear the story of that heroic de-
fence from the lips of one who was
concerned so intimately with it is one
of my greatest desires. But I am a
coward. I cannot face the extravaganza
that Alphonse would improvise, neither
dare I approach him for a mere hair-
cut and so confess to having deserted
his other form of artistry.
Yesterday I purchased a safety-razor

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ART IN THE ARCTIC.
To know that you can't draw and
to be told so by your friends are two
very different things. Honnell can't
draw, but hates his inseparable Swan
to tell him so. Honnell's sketches have
hitherto been criticised only by people
who also wanted their drawing flat-
tered. Swan learned bluntness on the
Yukon. So they are an odd pair to be
chumming now in the Arctic circle.
They are so friendly that they will
tramp together for half a day and
exchange scarcely so much as a grunt
of conversation.
Swan, of course, feels quite at home
in North Russia and smiles at the people
who call it cold and its distances big.
Honnell has lived in Edinburgh, so
doesn't notice the temperature, though
he misses the tramway system. Both
can say about six words—the same—
in Russian, and both have bought a
pair of moccasins—Swan because he
likes them, and Honnell because he
would like to.
Recently they set off together from
Kola on the Murman Coast to try to
find a village from which jolly little
Laplanders and Laplanderesses come
sliding and skidding to market behind
their stout-hearted reindeer. They left
all their picturesque Arctic gear behind
them except their moccasins, Swan
being one of those trying people who
don't care how they look, if only they
“mush " - along fast enough. Their
provisions consisted of a tin of bully
and four edible tiles or army biscuits,
with some margarine in a Y.M.C.A.
envelope. ... "
The story they told on their return—
for they did return and in good time
for dinner—was mostly Honnell's, but
I must admit that Swan could not be
got to refute it. As they approached
the village—some huts on a white hill-
side above a frozen lake—a represen-
tative of the dog-colony came to meet
them, waving his tail with an anti-
clockwise circular motion impossible to
the dog of temperate zones. Having
inspected them he escorted them on
their way in a perfectly civilised and
even courteous manner. - -
So far from being resisted, their
entry was ignored save by the little
fur-capped boys, who collected at their
heels as if they had formed the van-
guard of a circus, and the little brightly-
kerchiefed girls, who bolted for cover.
All the adult male inhabitants, fiercely-
bearded little men like trolls done up
in reindeer-skin from top to toe, ap-
peared to be engrossed in the manufac-
ture of sleighs, although the village
was already littered and cluttered up
with them; and all the ladies were
indoors sewing reindeer-skin into trou-
sers or making tea.
Having exchanged a noise like
“Sdrastetye'' (which in these parts
seems to mean “Bon jour") with every-
body they saw, our two friends sat on
a log and rested, while Honnell set
about sketching, as he calls it, the prim.
itive wooden church. The little boys,
of course, formed a sort of pyramid
on his shoulders to watch. Whether
because his fingers were cold and so
not completely under his control, or
because the vibrations of the human
pyramid communicated to his pencil
some lucky jerks, the marks Honnell
committed to (or on) his note-book
were such as supplied the simple chil-
dren of the snow with a clue as to his
intentions, and he was intensely grati-
fied to hear one say to another, “Tzer-
hoff"—knowing that noise to signify
“church" in the local tongue.
Swan, perceiving the moral damage
likely to be done to his friend by this
flattering incident, sought to puncture
Honnell's unhealthy pride by saying,
“Plaho?” (or “bad”) as a suggestion to
the critics; but this only caused them
to say repeatedly and with emphasis,
“Dobra !”—which was one of Honnell's
six words and means “good.”
Thus the mischief was done. Hon-
nell returned to his billet a man changed
and as it were possessed. To hear him
talk now one would suppose culture
had fled from the Temperate to the
Arctic zone. Of the Lapps' habits and
their houses he knows nothing, cares
nothing; all his enthusiasm is reserved
for the honesty and the innate artistic
perception of their children. So seri-
ously has he been affected by this un-
aided and impartial recognition of the
subject of his drawing that some of
us wonder if he will not settle down
amongst those who alone understand
and appreciate him. Returning home,
what can he hope to be 2 At best a
hero of the Relief Force. But in his
Lapp village he could imagine himself

A Noise arose of earnest men
Reſusing imitation duck;
It was a dreadſul moment when
The Beetroot-eaters struck,
And all around untasted stood
Rations of Mr. Kilo's favourite food.
For some forsook the sacred rules
And pulled, despite their master's
word,
Ham sandwiches from reticules;
On every side one heard
The sharp staccato lettuce-crunch
Merged in the howls of carnivores at
lunch.
And one conspirator leaped up
Amid the clash of tinkling spoons
And poured into a protose cup
His helping of stewed prunes;
And, blood-red presager of doom,
Half a tomato hissed across the room.
And angry “Pshaws'
tuts"
Proceeded from that concourse dense,
And “Nuts,” they wailed, “we want
more nuts—
More nuts at less expense !”
Till Mr. Ambrose Kilo came
And hushed the berserk banqueters to

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A Book of little novels, or long-shorts, from the pen of
Mr. Robert HICHENs, will be welcomed with pleasure by a
very large public. Snake-Bite (CAssell) contains a half-
dozen various tales, all but one of which are eminently
characteristic of their author. It sounds unkind to add
that this one is for artistry the best of the bunch; but I
mean no more than that Mr. HICHENs has here done very
well a slight and delicate sketch of a style not generally
associated with his work. In the name-piece his admirers
will find themselves on more familiar ground—none other
| indeed than that well-known desert in which they have en-
joyed such delicious thrills in the same company already.
When Mr. HICHENs' characters get the sand in their eyes
almost anything may be expected of them. Here he has
given us a new version of the ancient scheme of two men
and a woman, complicated in this instance by a cobra; the
problem being, whether a doctor should cure his wife's
lover of a snake-bite. More original is the longest-story in
the collection, one called “The Lost Faith,” an affair of
mental healing and love and crime too complex for com-
pression. It is admirably told. It leads up to a situation
as novel as it is dramatic—the confession of a young
famatic, who believes in a lady-healer so implicitly that
he puts typhoid germs into the drink of a celebrated general
in order to provide her with an impressive subject. As a
sensation this wants some beating; though it failed to
shake my own preference for the other story, which you
will observe I have purposely left unnamed. You will, I
hope, enjoy finding it for yourself.
Heritage (CoLLINs) gives me much the same impression
reader's path.
that one obtains from the spectacle of a man wire-walking
in a sack or painting pictures with his toes—attempting, in
short, any task under conditions of the greatest possible
handicap. That certainly is what Miss W. S.Ackville-
WEST has been at pains to impose upon herself. With a
straightforward, simple and interesting tale and some con-
siderable gifts for reproducing character, she has deliberately
sacrificed these advantages by telling her story in the most
roundabout and awkward manner imaginable. The theme
is the influence of heredity, as shown in the working out of
a strain of Spanish blood in a Sussex peasant stock, the
victims of this inconvenient blend being Ruth and the
young cousin whom half-unwillingly she marries, with de-
vastating results. Ruth, as I say, was attracted to West-
macott with only part of her being; the better (or at least
less Spanish) elements in her were employed in making soft
eyes at two other men, one of whom, Malory, is supposed
to relate portions of the affair to the quite superfluous out-
sider who puts them down. This vivd-voce recital is sub-
sequently rounded off by Malory, in what is surely the least
credible of all the unlikely letters in fiction, nearly a
hundred printed pages of it. So you see the obstacles that
Miss SACKVILLE-WEST has placed in her own and her
That, despite them all, the interest and
passion of this first novel do get home is an encouraging
omen for her success when she has learnt a greater sim-
plicity of attack. -
Wings of the Morning (HopDER AND SToughton) might
have been a most recommendable book, for it is in essen-
tials a pleasant story of a great artist who for the crime of
his hot-headed youth suffered imprisonment in the United
States, and, having “covered his tracks,” came home, fell
in love with his delightful sister's delightful step-daughter

and, after much suffering for them both, told his history
and won his lady. But unfortunately the inessentials—
and among these I have the temerity to include the great
European War, or, at any rate, very much that is here told
of it—are so harrowing that they do not accord with the
pleasant story to which they are tacked on. I would not
ask to be spared the knowledge of anything faced by other
people while I sat immune at home, but there are many
incidents which cannot with decency or dignity be served
up in fiction to add a thrill to the enjoyment of an hour's
light reading. Miss JoAN SUTHERLAND would have done
well to have left detail to more serious exponents, and to
have discarded entirely one scene of bestial cruelty which
has no real bearing on her tale. Never in a novel—and
seldom in historical accounts of fighting—have I been asked
to wallow in so much gore. It is all the more regrettable
because when Miss SUTHERLAND uses her imagination on
less horrible subjects she is much more successful.
Mr. ARTHUR TURBERVILLE has taken almost over-elabo-
an optimist not to make it clear that the blackest bore-
dom has a silver lining; and I had never any real fear
that her nice young couple were becoming more than
quite temporarily estranged. Still, things went so far that
Sophia left the cottage where she and Arthur and a coo-
ing dove had proposed to live the idyllic life of happiness-
ever-after, and betook herself to the mansion of the local
villain ; while Arthur cut the throat of the dove (there my
sympathies were with him entirely) and relapsed into
nervous breakdown. But Denyer, being only a BUCKRose
villain, which is a very mild variety, packed Sophia home
again; Arthur, after the usual crisis, recovered; and the
symbolic dove was the only inmate of the cottage for
whom the little rift remained unhappily permanent. So
there you are ; with the gentlest short sermon to wind up,
and a blessing to all concerned. Perhaps I have read
stories more briskly entertaining from Mrs. BUCKRose's
flowing pen; one feels that her intent here was not solely
laughter. But as a smiling homily, preaching much the
same moral that Sir ARTHUR PINERo once treated more

scores of homes.
Whenever I finish a book
by Mr. S. P. B. MAIs I am
left with the feeling that
he has only to enlarge his
horizon to write something
worth reading and remem-
bering. If The Education
of a Philanderer (GRANT
RICHARDs) had been written
by an unknown man I
should have welcomed it
as work of great promise.
But the trouble with Mr.,
MAIS is that he seems to
find it perilously easy to
write about young school-
masters who fall in and
fighting types, and of bring-
ing these by the same discipline to a readier appreciation of
the intellectual and idealist position, is well enough worked
out. The character-drawing impressed me less favourably.
The author, I should say, finds it rather difficult to under-
stand the ordinary good or indifferent fellow with his quali-
ties and their defects. I doubt the possibility of such a snake
in the grass as Lieutenant Seymour carrying on without
getting kicked. Nor do I think that that simple soldier-man,
Fortescue, V.C., would have so tamely accepted Dugdale's
betrayal to the woman they both loved of the fact that he
had just seen his rival putting a dubious young lady into a
cab in Regent Street at midnight. There is a good deal of
thoughtful work in this novel, which should be interesting to
amateur students of the psychology of war and men of war.
The latest of Mrs. J. E. BUCKRose's genial little come-
dies about a comfortable world is concerned with war-
weddings, their cause, and some hints for their successful
conduct. She calls it Marriage While You Wait (HopDER
AND SToUGHToN), and illustrates her theme with the case
of a young man and maiden, who dashed, like so many
others, into matrimony in the breathless haste of short
leave, and came dangerously near repenting at leisure.
Only near, of course; Mrs. BUCKRosB is too confirmed
out of love with facility and
who are financially at their wits' end. Rupert Blundell,
the philanderer described here, is a clear and clever pic-
ture of a young man who loved where he listed, and listed
quite a lot. As far as he goes he can be visualized per-
fectly both at Oxford and as a schoolmaster. But he does
not go far enough; and he belongs to a type of which one
can easily tire. Mr. MAIs is not so callow as he once was
in his judgment of people mentally distasteful to him, but
he still needs a wider outlook on life and a wider knowledge,
and I sincerely hope that he will take steps to remove the
limitations which at present prevent him from giving entire
satisfaction to his admirers.

[Being a Republican's apology for the recent anti-British agitation
in the States.]
OH, never let it mar the mutual love,
That now unites us eye to eye,
If, superficially, we seem to shove
º Our fingers in your Irish pie— -
An action which, if you should so behave,
Would make old Monroe wriggle in his grave.
How loath we are by nature to intrude
In things outside our own concern
Is witnessed by the European feud
In which we lately took a turn;
Ere WILsoN's mind was fixed to see you through it,
For years he wondered if he ought to do it.
And, when for Ireland's good we intervene
In matters patently remote,
You must not count our loyalty less keen—
We simply want the Irish vote;
'Tis an election stunt, this lion-baiting,
Designed for local Kelts who need placating.
So, when our Yankee delegates rehearse
Their tale of Erin's bitter woe,
Of crimes, almost too bad to quote in Erse,
Committed by the Saxon foe,
Please understand why our apparent bias is
In favour of these nimble Ananiases.
And also why, for Ireland's dear, dear sake
(Meaning of course “Ourselves Alone”),
A lot of us would gladly let her take
Our WILsoN for her very own,
To worship, like a god inside a tin fame,

GOING TO THE BANK.
SHE thought she had got a bargain. It was only marked
“20/-,” and would have been double the price at any of
the West-end places. So she whipped out her Japanese
note-case, paid for it, and carried it off like a whirlwind
lest the shopman should find he had made a mistake.
But it was she who had made a mistake, and she broke
the news to me at breakfast on the following morning.
Two of her one-pound notes (or, to be exact, my one-
pound notes) must have stuck together. She had paid the
West-end price after all. - -
Then, instead of blaming her own carelessness, as I
should have done, what must she do but attack Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE 2
“It's all his fault, this horrid dirty paper-money . . .
Spreading infection wherever it goes' " - - * *
It devolved upon me to defend the Government, which I
did with some heat, drawing forth another one-pound note
casually, as though I were made of them, and flourishing
it in my hand. -
“And anyway,” I argued, “Mr. LLoyd GEORGE is not to
blame. The note does not bear his signature, but that of
Sir John BRADBURY. And a fine bold signature it is—why,
it's dirt-cheap for the lesson in handwriting alone.”
She did not appreciate that, because hers is a small
scrabbed writing. But I continued mercilessly—
“I bet he doesn't bite his lips when he's signing his name.”
“Extremely bad writing, I should call it,” she retorted.
“Look, you cannot tell where the 'u' ends and the 'r'
begins.”
“But aside from that,” I resumed (I was very proud of
this expression, having picked it up from President WILsoN).
—“aside from that, turn the note over, feast your eyes on
the picture of the Houses of Parliament. It too is thrown
in for nothing. This at least ought to appeal to you, with
your enthusiasm for Gothic architecture.”
If looks could annihilate, that would have been my last
boiled egg. -
“You think yourself very clever,” she said, “and you are
supposed to understand all about money matters. Surely
you know of a bank where I can take these wretched
notes and get gold instead, the good old English gold that
was worth its face-value all the world over ?”
I did not know she could be so eloquent. I rose and
went to the window. It was a noble morning.
“Yes,” I said after a little reflection, “put on your best
hat and collect your paper-money. But try and pack it all
into the kit-bag if you possibly can.” (She winced a little.)
“I know a bank where you will be able to get all the gold
you want . . .”

Shoulder to shoulder we fought the good fight for the
motor-bus.
“Two to the Bank,” I gasped.
But it was at Charing Cross station I made her descend.
She looked extraordinarily mystified, and I explained that
the Bank's country branches are the only ones where gold
is still to be had. -

She and an empty milk-can and I were all that got out
at the little station in the hills. However, a cuckoo intro-
duced himself boldly by name. He seemed so near he might
have been in the booking-office. But the booking-office
was deserted.
“There can't possibly be a bank in this out-of-the-
world place,” she protested.
“Patience,” I replied, leading her down a steep path
between high thick hedges to a small gateway. Through
this we went, and I heard her draw in her breath.
From our feet, as it seemed, up to the blue sky itself,
one golden glowing bank of buttercups and cowslips . . .

moonday sun. . . "
“There,” I crowed, “you will be able to get all the gold
you want. Did I not say, ‘I know a bank’?”
She did a curious thing. She put her arms round my neck
and kissed me. - -
“Dear old Mr. Sententious,” said she, “did you think
you could take me in 2 I knew my Midsummer Night's
Dream by heart while you were still discovering “THE-

I must admit that her voice was not unpleasing.

A TANGLED TRIANGLE.
The Pâtisserie Delarue et Salon de
Consommations is situated just on the
edge of Europe. Being a place of ex-
treme military importance I dare not
indicate its position with greater ex-
actitude, but may go so far as to say
that it can be found by stepping off the
boat, crossing the bridge and then in-
quiring of the Military Police. Its im-
portance is due to the quality of its
crème éclairs, which attract the gilded
Staff in such large numbers that the
interior is usually suffused like an
Eastern sunset with a rich glow of red
tabs and gilt braid. Within its walls
junior subalterns, now, alas, a rapidly
diminishing species, dally with insidious
ices until their immature moustaches
are pendulous with lemon-flavoured
icicles and their hair is whitened with
sugared rime.
There it was that Frederick dis-
covered Percival feebly and mournfully
pecking at a vanilla ice.
“Greeting, old Spartan,” said he.
“Training for the Murman coast 2"
“Would that I were !” replied Per-
cival. “I’m refrigerating my sorrows.
I've tried to drown them, but they
float; so I'm by way of freezing them
under.”
“Poor Perce | " murmured Frederick.
“I suppose it's Cox again 2"
“Au contraire, I'm his sorrow. My
present trouble is that I've got to find
a wife.”
“Nothin'easier, old thing. Your photo
in the illustrated papers, with appro-
priate letterpress— ”
“You misunderstand me,” interrupted
Percival. “It's someone else's wife I've
got to find. Ecoutez. Teddy Roker has
got permission for his wife to visit him
out here. He's expecting her by this
afternoon's boat and has got a billet
fixed up all right, but he's been sud-
denly rushed away on a court-martial
case, so he's asked me to meet her,
and I've never seen her before.”
“But didn't he give you the specifi-
cations—kind of descriptive return ?”
“That's just it!” groaned Percival.
“He was only married last leave, and
his description goes like a Shakspearean
sonnet. I gather that I've got to look
out for a combination of Titania, GLADYs
Cooper and HELEN OF TRoy. I tried
to nail him down to externals, but he
only went off into another rhapsody.
“‘What does she wear?' I asked.
“‘Wear?' said he dreamily. “Oh!
beautifully Graped garments, nebulous
as summer clouds and filmy as gossa-
mer webs. Nothing really definite.'
“‘That sounds probable enough, as
the present fashions go,'” said I.
“Seems to me,” said Frederick,
“that this is a case to refer to higher
authority. The sleuth-hound instinct
of one Frederick is indicated. Having
absorbed the available, data I will e'en
amble round myself to assist you.”
“There speaks my stout-hearted
haricot ' " said Percival. “But be care-
ful. Teddy won't like it if he gets the
wrong wife. He made a point of that.
So in case we miss each other your in:
structions are briefly these: you will
meet what you honestly think to be
Mrs. Roker outside the Customs House,
explain Teddy's absence, take her to his
rooms at 10 bis, Rue Dufay, make her
comfortable and report to me here at
6.15.”
Punctually at 6.15 they met again
in the Pâtisserie Delarue. Both were
radiant...
“'Tis done!” said Percival proudly;
“and without the assistance of the
puissant Frederick. At 5.0 o'clock I
was outside the Customs House and

eye. Mrs. Roker, I believe? ' said I.
She confessed right away, so I rattled
her off in a cab to 10 bis, Rue Dufay,
and left her there nibblin' biscuits and
drinkin' tea as happy as a flapper."
“Percival,” replied Frederick slowly,
"for sheer imbecility you have sur-
passed yourself. I inyself met Mrs.
Roker outside the Customs House
at 5.30, being detained en route. I took
her to 10 bis, Rue Duſay, where at the
present moment she is partaking of
coffee and chocolate caramels. Shortly,
no doubt, she will discover the spurious
female that you have decoyed thither
and the First Act of a triangle draina
will be rung up."
“By Jazz," exclaimed Percival, “ I'd
stake my gratuity on the genuineness
of my Mrs. Roker. She knows Teddy's
favourite breakfast food."
“No," said Frederick decidedly,
“mine is the only authentic article.
All others are imitations. She knows
dearest Edward's size in gloves."
“Well, we can't both be right.”
“Did Teddy say anything about ex-
pecting two wives ? " asked Frederick
hopefully.

was becoming offensively hostile that
I succeeded in producing a five-pound

to count out the change, and on leaving
the window I found four policemen

THE DEUCE DON'T YOU DRIVE ON THE PROPER SIDE OF THE ROAD 2"
wild dash for the moving - staircase,
shedding Bradburys en route like a
paper-chase.
As I rushed past the ticket-puncher
she made a vicious lunge at my out-
stretched hand with an enormous pair
of pincers, missing the ticket and part-
ially amputating my thumb.
As I have always expected to do, but
have never yet done, I missed my
footing at the top of the escalator, and
my desire to outstrip my enemies was
realised beyond my wildest hopes as
I crashed, by a series of petrifying
somersaults, down the entire flight, to
be belched forth like a sausage from a
machine at the bottom.
Tattered, torn and in unspeakable
agony I picked myself up and found
my steering-gear so damaged that I
could only move sideways, crab-fashion,
and in this manner I crawled on to the
platform just as a train was beginning
its exit.
I make a leap for it. The gates crash
to Am I inside them or out 2 Neither.
I am pinned there with the first half of
my body struggling inside the car while
the second half protrudes over the fast-
receding platform.
I remember how in my agony it
flashed across my mind that I would
never again slay a wasp with my fork.
I must have been pulled into the car
just in time to stop the tunnel (which
is a dreadfully close fit) from bisecting
me, for the next thing I remember was
being dropped into a corner seat and
severely admonished by the guard for
getting into the train whilst it was in
motion.
I was now a quivering and shape-
less mass; nobody pitied me, nobody
helped me, so loathsome a spectacle
did I present.
Of course the train passed my sta-
tion, and at the next I was thrown out
like a mail-bag, to be trodden on by
massed formations of travellers fighting
to enter and leave the car by the same
door at the same time.
When the multitudes had dispersed
and I was alone, by superhuman efforts
I contrived to wriggle on my stomach
to the foot of the ascending stairway,
but not having sufficient strength to
wriggle off on arrival at the top, my
long - dreaded horror of being sucked
under the barrier, where moving stair-
ways disappear, was realised.
By now immune to pain, I regarded
the next process (akin to being passed
through a mangle) as child's play. To
my amazement, after a few minutes
amongst giant cog-wheels, I again found
the light on the down-going staircase,
which precipitated me to the spot from
which I had started. -
Having thrice performed this revo-
lution, by which time I was as flat as
a pancake, I was eventually scraped
off by a porter and upbraided for joy-
riding.
Finding that these rebukes left me
unmoved, for I was practically lifeless,
certainly boneless, and, to their horror,
ticketless, they folded me up and put
me in a drawer pending the arrival of
the police.
I was still there when the dream
mercifully stopped.

PEAcocks sweep the fairies' rooms;
They use their folded tails for brooms;
But fairy dust is brighter far
Than any mortal colours are;
And all about their tails it clings
In strange designs of rounds and rings;
And that is why they strut about
And proudly spread their feathers out.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 25, 1919.
CROSS COUNTRY.
A CoMMANDER in the Senior Service
is the man who gets things done; and
long experience has formulated for him
a golden rule: “If you want to get
things done you must see them done.”
This laudable maxim applies in a lesser
degree to all his subordinates, right
down to the newly-joined boy, who
can't very well help seeing some things
done, unless he makes a habit of work-
ing with his eyes shut—a practice which
does not appeal particularly to I’.O.'s.
The Commander of His Majesty's
Battleship Ermyntrude is far from
being an exception to the rule; he is a
martyr to it. So are his officers. In
their enthusiasm they have let the rule
run riot. You will soon see that for
yourself.
The idea germinated in the practical
head of the gunner. It pushed its way
into the upper air under the plain cap
of the A.P. It budded under the
(slighted tilted) head-dress of Number
One, and blossomed forth into a full-
blown project under the gilded oak-
leaves that thatch the Bloke.
He said, “The ship's company will
run across country.”
The ship's company girded up its
loins and awaited further orders.
The course was decided upon. It
ran from the signalling station on the
south of the island straight to the
town on the north. There was no
possibility of making a mistake, because
you could see the semaphore from any-
where, and you would know when you
got to the town because the road
stopped there. The various divisions
of the ship were to compete against
each other. If you came in first you
were to be given a ticket numbered
“one"; if second, a ticket numbered
“two,” and so on; and the division
which had the smallest total of pips
at the end would be the winner.
At 8.15 the ship's pinnace landed the
gunner on the town jetty at the north
end of the island. He had come to
deal with the competitors when they
arrived at the winning-post. He had
brought with him the bo'sun and the
carpenter, his own mate, the bo'sun's
mate and the carpenter's mate, four
P.O.'s, the sergeant of Marines, a few
leading stokers and half-a-dozen hands;
fifty fathoms of hawser-laid four-inch
white rope; six stout stakes (ash);
bags, canvas, twelve (one to collect the
tickets earned by each division); and
one thousand eight hundred tickets,
numbered from one to one thousand
eight hundred. (There were only six
hundred and fifty runners, but it is well
to be on the safe side.) - -
He dug his stakes into the ground in
a V-shaped formation just beyond the
place where the road ended and almost
opposite the first cottage. Further
north he posted his canvas bags, which
he fixed at a convenient height above
the ground by depending them from the
necks of his subordinates. He then
rigged his rope around the stakes in
such a way that the runners, entering
the wide end of the V, would be shep-
herded one by one through a narrow
aperture at the bottom, thus avoiding
all suspicion of overcrowding in giving
out the tickets. He explained his plan
of campaign to his party and took up
his post at the foot of the V.
Scarcely had he done so when the
A.P. appeared upon the scene. He had
brought with him a few friends—a
couple of subs, two or three senior
snotties and the Captain's secretary, a
brace of stewards with the luncheon
baskets, and the cutter's crew, who
carried between them two large trellis-
work screens which the carpenter had
knocked up for him.
He passed the time of day with the
gunner, marched fifty yards further
down towards the starting-point and
had his screens deposited in the middle
of the road, in such a way that several
could enter one end of the enclosure
they formed, but only one at a time
could go out at the other; this, he ex-
plained, would enable the men to pass
the winning-post in single file. He then
lit a cigarette and took his stand at
the narrow end, producing from his
pocket seven hundred and fifty neatred
tickets (numbered from one to seven
hundred and fifty) which the chief
writer had made out for him the night
before.
At 8.45 Number One arrived. To help
him he had brought a couple of watch-
keepers, a surgeon, three engineers,
a naval instructor and the captain of
Marines. He only paused to borrow,
one side of the gunner's V and all but
forty of the A.P.'s tickets, and passed
on down the road. . . When he had
reached a suitable point about a hundred
yards south of the A.P. he had the
purloined rope stretched slantwise, in
such a way that the only means of
passing it was a little passage a yard
wide between the rope and the ditch
on the right of the road. A little
nearer still to the starting-point he had
a large placard erected with the words
“Keep to the Right" painted on it.
Punctually at 9.0 the Commander
arrived with a piece of string and the
P.M.O. They took up their stand one
on each side of the road opposite the
placard. The Bloke produced a small
gold pencil, but, as he had forgotten to
bring any paper, he commandeered the
placard and began feverishly to write
down all the numbers he could think of
from one to six hundred and fifty.
You are no doubt anxiously awaiting
the arrival of the Owner at 9.15. Well,
I'm afraid I must disappoint you. Still,
although he did not come in person,
yet he made his presence felt, as every
good skipper should. At 9.15, as the
ship's company were lining up for the
start by the semaphore, he made the
signal from the ship:-

diately." = -

“I’M TOLD SHE'S ALWAYS WRITING TO HER DRESSMAKER ABOUT NEW FROCKS.”
“I SUPPOSE SHE ENCLOSED A STAMPED AND ADDRESSED ENVELOPE FOR THAT ONE.”
A CRUSADER.
ONE hears sometimes of pure altru-
ists, but on analysing their purity an
alloy is perceptible. Although their
work is for others, an element of per-
sonal gratification is present.
Personal gratification or self-indulg-
ence is of course inevitable, as it can
even enter into grief and pain; but
now and then it is reduced to a mini-
mum: as, I hold, in the latest activities
for her fellow-creatures in which my
friend Mrs. Delta has embarked.
During the War Mrs. Delta was in-
defatigable (I am not often sure of my
words, but I use this without a tremor
of misgiving) in promoting charities
and collecting money to sustain them.
At no time of day was it safe to meet
her, for you had to stand and deliver.
There were no privations due to the
War which she was not out to mollify
or remove, and her ingenuity in dis-
covering worthy objects was uncanny.
As, however,War was raging and most
people are, underneath, kinder than not,
she escaped very severe criticism and
amassed some good round sums. And,
since all her various Funds had com-
mittees and meetings and minutes, Mrs.
Delta, although that may have been
only the least among her motives, was
the recipient of certain expressions of
gratitude. Organised charity cannot
elude votes of thanks.
But that Mrs. Delta likes work for
work's sake, apart altogether from
honeyed praises, is now beyond question,
for the campaign she has just inau-
gurated is unlikely to yield them.
“You must,” she said to me yes-
terday, “give me something for my
new scheme.”
“I hope I shall have enough strength
of mind not to ; but what is it?”
“You have noticed in what a dread-
ful state so many of the shop windows
in London now are 2 ” she asked.
“The iniquitous prices of the goods?”
“Oh, no; I didn't mean that. I mean
the dropped letters. Where they have
glass letters stuck on, you know, and
some have gone. Surely you must have
noticed 2’’
“Yes, of course,” I replied; “but
I thought the shop-keepers were too
lazy or careless to bother. The War
has increased carelessness, you know.”
“No, it isn’t that,” she said. “The
poor fellows are so understaffed and
overworked that they can't find time.
My idea is to raise a fund so that it can
be done for them. My heart aches.
Only this morning I saw a barber's
with ASH AND RUSH UP on it; and a
confectioner's "-she referred to her
notebook—“ with ICE REAMs, and an
undertaker's with PINKING on E ER.E.”
“What is pinking?” I asked. “I
always wanted to know.”
“And,” she continued, again con-
sulting her book, “a tobacconist's with
BEST olDEN vrBGIN , and a dentist's
with PA LEss ExTRACTION. Something
really must be done. Don't you agree?”
I murmured that there were other
abuses that were possibly more in need
of immediate redress, but Mrs. Delta
again turned to her book.
“And a dairyman with FAMILIES

The means of rescue came to me in
the shape of a vast monster on wheels,

I said, and ran.

What bilge, you say, good reader?
My very dear old bean,
Think of the state of Prices,
Think of the slump in Trade,
Turn to the Paris Crisis,
Ponder the cost of ices
And buns and gingerade.
New War-loans shriek for money;
All work is at an end;
It seems extremely funny
There's any cash to spend;
Yet still the tide of laces,
The foam of fluff and silk
Comes round in cardboard cases
To lots of people's places
As punctual as the milk.
While, sworn to get revenge in,
And waiting at the door,
That grim three-handed engine
Prepares to strike once more,
Who built these gowns we mutely
Admire on lawn and lea?
Who bought them (think acutely),
With England absolutely
As broke as she can be 2
Therefore I say the fabric
Was wrought of faery woof,
Not made in walls of drab brick
Nor won with mortal oof;
Delicate, dream-like, pretty
As sunshine after rain,
Worn by Miss Hodgson (“Kitty")—
It seems a dreadful pity
She spilled the iced champagne.
Therefore I say that, toiling
With wild white roses' bloom—
No printers' vats a-boiling
Nor labour of the loom—
With fern and foxglove chalice
On tiny feet or wings
Titania's elves made sallies,
And that's how Lady Alice
Had on those lovely things.

WHY DRAG IN MERS. SIDDONS 2
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Nothing annoys
me more than the assumption that wit,
learning, fancy, etc., were the monopoly
of the past. For example, a correspond-
ent of one of our leading dailies has
been trotting out Mrs. SIDDONs' use of
blank verse in familiar conversation,
and quoting from LockHART:-
“John Kemble's most familiar table-
talk often flowed into blank verse; and
so indeed did his sister's [Mrs. Sid-
dons']. Scott (who was a capital
mimic) often repeated her tragic ex-
clamation to a foot-boy during a dinner
at Ashestiel—
‘You’ve brought me water, boy, I asked for
beer l'
Another time, dining with a Provost of
Edinburgh, she ejaculated, in answer
to her host's apology for his pièce de
résistance—
‘Beef cannot be too salt for me, my lord.’”
This is all very well, but just as
good blank verse is commonly used by
eminent men and women to-day; in-
deed some of them excel in impromptu
rhymes. Thus in Mr. HARold WEST-
MoRELAND's interesting volume, Eaves-
droppings, there is this charming story
of the first meeting of Madame CLARA
BUTT and Miss CARRIE TUBB. They
were introduced at a garden-party at
Fulham, and Mr. WESTMORELAND over-
heard the memorable quatrain in which
Madame CLARA BUTT greeted her sister-
artist:—
“In our names we're alike
- But in minstrelsy—ah no!
For I'm a contralto
And you're a soprano."
To the same veracious chronicler I
am indebted for a specimen of the im-
promptus which Lord READING fre-
quently throws off, to the delight of his
friends. Mr. WESTMoRELAND was hav-
ing a pair of boots tried on at a famous
Jermyn Street bootmaker's when Lord
READING was undergoing a similar
ordeal, and electrified the courteous
assistant by observing:—
“The right-foot boot to me seems rather
tight;
The left, per contra, feels exactly right.”
But perhaps the finest exponent of
the art is a famous General, whose
obiter dicta in verse are innumerable. I
have only space to quote one, spoken
to a soldier with whom he had shaken
hands:—
“You are the proudest man in France,
Or at any rate in Flanders,
For you've shaken hands, in a great ad-
vance,
With the greatest of Corps Commanders.”
Surely in the light of these examples,
which might be indefinitely multiplied,
there is no need for the present to fear
comparison with the past in the sphere
of conversational verse?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE CINDERELLA MAN.”
THE importation of theatrical sweet-
stuff from America is of course a grow-
ing industry. The latest consignment,
The Cinderella Man, first arrived in
this country in the form of a novel, and
the difficulty it offered was that the
struggling hero, Anthony Quintard,
whose fate depended, in the absence of
common-sense, on his winning a ten
thousand dollar prize for an opera
libretto, seemed to me, from samples of
his work exhibited, to be an unlikely
competitor. But I must say that when
at the play I saw our Mr. NAREs in
his garret sucking at his pipe in that
masterful manner and modifying what
might so easily have been a
too sticky situation with a
charmingly light touch, I be-
gan to think better of An-
thony's chances and therefore
necessarily of Mr. Edward
CHILDS CARPENTER’s general
idea. For the author obvi-
ously may claim the credit of
this reading, even if I harbour
an obstinate private suspicion
that it was only by a very
deliberate and steadfast de-
termination on the part of
Mr. NAREs as hero and Mr.
Holy(AN CLARK as match-
maker that this particular
reading prevailed.
Mr. CARPENTER doesn't be-
lieve in mystifications. He
explains everything with the
completest candour in his
first Act, from which you
gather that a millionaire's
daughter, returning from
Paris to the immense stuffy New York
mansion, is desperately lonely, and has
also cut herself free from an unsatisfac-
tory affair of the heart; that a young
poet, a friend of the millionaire's senti-
mental lawyer, is also lonely, living like
Cinderella (isn't this wrong?) in an attic
next-door, proud as poor; that another
friend of the millionaire has offered a
prize for a libretto. Having thus put
the rabbit, the bird-cage and the flower-
pot into the hat in front of you he pro-
ceeds in a leisurely manner to take
them out again.
The young millionairess, posing as a
poor “companion,” wisits the starveling
poet vid the snow-covered roof and the
attic window, bringing food, stoves,
coverlets, wool to mend his socks and
ideas to mend his opera. Naturally
here were opportunities of unlimited
business, during which Marjorie (Miss
RENEE KELLY) looked perfectly sweet,
as I heard more than one ardent young
lady declare to approving lieutenants.
Miss KELLY has indeed all the air of
a heroine of honeyed romance. In par-
ticular she played one episode, the
trying over of a new song, in a winningly
natural manner. I found the way in
which she flapped her eyelids a subject
of puzzled study. I have not observed
that maidens in real life indulge in
these calisthenics. This is perhaps as
well; they are evidently very deadly.
Within a fortnight of their being
brought into action poet Quintard is in
the Kamerad stage. Not Anne Whit-
field herself exhibits more explicitly the
urgency of the life force, the will to wed.
Mr. Owen NAREs, who has a following
more than sufficient to justify his recent
assumption of management, gave a

limits imposed by the piece, a distin-
guished performance as the proud and
hungry poet. An extreme naturalness
of pose and intonation, without over-
stresses or affectations, characterised
this agreeable study. Mr. HolmAN
CLARK, that finished actor in the bland
manner, very adroitly, as I have hinted,
settled the mood of the piece and made
the good appear the better line and the
ordinary line good. Mr. SYDNEY WALEN-
TINE had a Valentine part ready made.
It would take more than an indisposition,
which he pluckily ignored, to put him
off his stroke. Mr. ToM REYNoLDs was
effective as a maudlin serving-man who
had once butled a real gentleman and
could never forget it. Miss ANNIE
ESMOND gave a depressingly clever ren-
dering of a quite unbelievably appalling
landlady.
Altogether a pleasant wholesome
evening's entertainment. Young men
and maidens of our day needn't hesitate
to take their parents.
“ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGONs.”
There is much more of the substance
of wit and truth in Mr. EDEN PHILL-
Potts’ “Devon comedy” at the Kings-
way. The St. George of the title is not
the Cappadocian, but that somewhat
irreverent Father in God, St. George
Loftus, Bishop of Exeter; the dragons
are two quite unsuitable suitors for the
hands of Monica and Eva (daughters of
his dull old friend, Lord Sampford),
who don't believe in class distinctions.
Monica's young man is the son of a
yeoman farmer, personable, certainly, on
horseback and of a blood older than the
Sampfords', but an essential resilient,
and altogether impossible when play-
ing the concertina or after mixing his
drinks (or both). Eva's fol-
lower is a brilliant raw young
man from Glasgow, recently
ordained, with professional
ambitions as pronounced as
his accent.
The parents try the now
exploded method of direct op-
position. St. George's weap-
ons are smooth words and a
heart chokefull of guile.
Does his god-daughter Monica
want to elope with her yeo-
man 2. By all means let love
have his sacred way. But
his lordship will contrive in
the rôle of a strayed and
bogged fisherman to be at
Stonelands Farm before the
young couple arrive en route
for London and the registry-
office, and he will see to it
that Monica learns what the
daily life of a working farmer
is like, and what the beer (or
bad champagne for festal occasions)
and rabbit pie in the kitchen; with
sudden frank explanations as to the im-
minence of the crisis in the interesting
condition of Snowdrop the Alderney;
what, too, is the Stonelands' notion of
music and the dance, with Teddy's
braying concertina and cousin Unity's
quavering treble and the ragged bass
and candid speech of old Caunter, the
head man . . . So much for Monica.
And Eva thinks she wants to tie
herself to this crude Glaswegian.
Well, here it will be best to insinuate
to the young man how unfortunate it
is that the vacant chaplaincy to the
Bishop of Exeter is designed for a celi-
bate, and to the young woman that to
marry so brilliant (and ingenuous) a
youth is to hang a millstone round
his neck. For, after all, muses the
prelate, revealing dreadful depths of
low cunning and perfidy, it's easier to
change a chaplain than a husband.
A thoroughly amusing affair. Of

missed a diverting piece of fun and have
been saddled with a solemn problem-
play unsuited to the (alleged) gaiety
of the hour.
The general level of the playing was
high, and, after a somewhat nervous
opening (and perhaps just a few affec-
tations of the fourth-wall school), the
piece swung into a pleasant rhythm.

Teddy Copplestone had perhaps the
most difficult task, a part that by no
means played itself, but needed a sus-
tained skill, duly forthcoming. But I
think the performance that pleased me
most was that of Miss EvelyN WALSH
HALL, a name new to me, in the small
part of Unity Copplestone, played with
a directness and sincerity which was
quite distinguished.
Let me add that the flapping of eye-
lids (to which I have referred in my
remarks on The Cinderella Man) is here
also a feature. One member of the cast
(of my own sex, too) gave a display of
virtuosity in this genre which was tech-
nically superb.
Two insignificant details of manage-
ment caused me some amusement. The
solemn clang of a gong presaging doom
as dire as CEDIPUs's (and incidentally
inaudible to cigarette smokers in the
foyer) gives notice of the resumption of
the play, while at the end of the Acts
the curtain flutters up and down at a
feverish pace as if the idea was to get
in as many “calls” as possible before
the applause stops. Are we as guileless
as all that, I wonder? And, anyway,
no such manoeuvre was necessary. The
applause was hearty, the laughter
spontaneous, and anybody who cares
for plays made and played with brains
should go and see this engaging piece.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Jinny the Carrier (HEINEMANN) was, as Mr. ZANGwill
lets us know in a felicitous epistle-dedicatory to an evidently
charming lady, designed as a “bland” and leisurely book,
free from any trace of war's horrors or modern perplexities,
the sort you could read comfortably with a sore throat on
you. I think if I had not been in such rude health I might
have managed the five hundred and eighty odd close-set
pages without getting just a little tired of his worthy Essex
peasants of the time of the great Hyde Park Exhibition.
Jimmy herself is a perfect darling, of real wit and character,
and her business as the local carrier gives a plausible
machinery for the introduction of an enormous number, a
truly Dickensian profusion, of subsidiary characters. Jinny
indeed is above criticism, but the trouble with many, indeed
with most, of the others, seemed to me to be their exaggerated
It is much harder, I am afraid, to be a good Bengali than
a good Englishman. Nikhil, the Rajah of Sir RAEINDRA-
NATH TAGoRE's The Home and the World (MACMILLAN),
persists in treating Sandip Babu (a convinced Nietzchean in
philosophy and a Nationalist of the most inflammable type)
as an honoured guest of his household, in spite of the fact
that he differs from the fellow profoundly on every conceiv-
able topic and is well aware, moreover, that Sandip is
rapidly winning the heart of his Rani, Bimala. Nikhil, you
see, considers that “all imposition of force is weakness,”
and that “only the weak dare not be just.” Most West-
erners, I think, would have kicked therhapsodical and rather
plausible agitator out-of-doors and felt all the better for it
from the boot-toe upwards. The real truth is that the
story, which is written in the form of a triple autobiography
(Nikhil, Sandip and Bimala all taking a hand at telling it
in turn) is an exposition of two views of Suadeshi, or what
may be called the Sinn Fein movement in India. Nikhil is
sprightliness of speech,
just a little too clever to - - −-

To me the real pleasure
of the book comes from
the author's craftsmanlike
use of words and the hu-
mour and imagination of
his descriptions and asides.

candid beyond the custom
of my trade I must confess
to an uncomfortable im-

The latter first deifies his
wº- country (Bande Mataram,
or “Hail, Mother!" is the
Nationalist motto) and
then identifies Bim a la
with the object of his
worship, which seems a
very convenient theory.
As for Bimala, she wavers
| between the two. The
ºffl|romantic interest of the
book (which is, by the
way, a translation) breaks
down rather badly when it
becomes clear that Sandip
is not really a big enough
man to make a complete
conquest of the Rani; but
from every other point of
view it is supremely inter-
esting. And if Nikhil
might perhaps have been
improved by a little less
force of character and
more of shoe-leather, Bi-
her own standard. Its publishers (who may be prejudiced)
consider The Avalanche as “a brilliant and engaging study
of mystery and romance;” me it impressed as a melo-
drama dependent on one long-heralded sensation, which
proves on tardy arrival an affair of disappointment. I
suppose I must be careful not to give away the mystery,
such as it is. Price Rugler was anxious to discover why
his attractive wife assumed a worried look when money
was mentioned and fainted on being told that she was not
to wear the family ruby at a particular masque. All this
happened (you may not be astonished to hear) in San
Francisco, amongst that luxurious, idle, over-moneyed
society whose manners Mrs. ATHERTON knows and describes
so well. Price had already found out, with the assistance
of a not too brilliant detective, that his wife's mother derived
her income from a gambling saloon; the remaining problem
was how to link up this knowledge with the odd behaviour
of Mrs. Price. Perhaps you see it already. She had
been— No, I said I wouldn't, and I won't. Of course
the discovery couldn't be called cheerful, though it was
fortunately made in time to prevent any great harm. But
it was nothing like an avalanche.
mala, at any rate, is a delightful personage.
Even “KATHARINE TYNAN” must sometimes fall below
her own standard, and The Man from Australia (CoLLINs),
though written with considerable grace and charm, is too
thin in plot to be altogether satisfactory. John Darling, a
youngish man of wealth and an extremely liberal disposition,
came from Australia to visit his connexions in the West
of Ireland and—if opportunities occurred—to help them.
Opportunities did offer themselves in abundance. The
Adairs in their various ways were ripe for a benefactor of
the Darling type to appear, and John soon got busy. In
the course of his activities—for it would have been unkind
(and very dull) to bring him all the way from Australia to
Ireland just to serve as a travelling relief-fund—he is made
to fall in love with one of the Adair girls. And that's almost
the whole story. One may always trust Mrs. HINKson
to get her atmosphere right; but she is not so happy in her
attempt to contrast the preternaturally unselfish Darling
(who, like an earlier Mr. Darling, would have been content
to live in a kennel) with the inordinately self-indulgent
father of the Adairs.

THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS.
“I Assume,” said the Cynic, “that you are sufficiently sanguine to rejoice in the prospects of Peace.”
“I derive a certain satisfaction from those prospects,” replied Mr. Punch on a note of reserve.
“But you ought to be jazzing for joy, like the other fools in their Paradise of nigger minstrelsy."
“My years excuse me from choric exercises,” said the Sage. “And, anyhow, it doesn't take me that way.”
“Then you are not in the movement. You are not in touch with the spiritual pulse of our throbbing Metro-
polis; you take no active part in the New Life that is springing from the seed of England's sacrifices. True,
your years, as you say, are against you, however well you wear them: it is to the young that we look first for signs
of the great Regeneration. And in particular we look to those who are to be the mothers of that future race
which should reap the full harvest of our blood and tears.
“And what do we find?” continued the Cynic. “We find a contempt for the old virtues of simplicity
and reticence; we find the distinction of sex wiped out, and with it all reverence and sense of mystery. Nature is a
back number with them; they must for ever be plastering their noses with powder—not just privily, as used to
be the better way of faded charmers, but shamelessly in public places. In dress they barely keep within the
bounds of decency prescribed by the police. They make their own advances, rounding up and capturing their
‘boys' for partners, lest the haunts of jazzery should be closed against them. And in this competition for their
favours the good modest fellows who only a little while ago were fighting our battles for us are now giving
themselves the airs of spoilt beauties. What do you make of all this in your scheme of Renaissance?”
“I admit much of what you say,” said Mr. Punch, “but I ascribe it, in part at least, to a natural re-
action from the strain and horror of War.”
“‘Reaction’l” snorted the Cynic. “A very comfortable word. But what were the sufferings from which
they are ‘reacting’” The loss, you will say, of the flower of our chivalry in battle? Well, one would think
that might have steadied them. Is this what our manhood died for—to make a British carnival?”
“I don't pretend to understand that side of it,” said the Sage, “but I know that during the War we respected
the silence of their grief; and I know that nature must choose its own way of recovering from a loss and reassert-
ing its claim to happiness. Remember, too, that War must always have its demoralising features, however splendid
the cause for which you are fighting. ‘Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,” says the soldier in his
brief intervals of release. And some of us at home went more than half-way to meet him, imitating an attitude
excusable in him but not in us. And that attitude is bound to survive for a little time the causes that induced

it. . But you must not forget that many of the type which you are now attacking did noble work in the War;
and they will do it again.”
“That may be,” said the Cynic; “but is it necessary to have an orgy of Carmagnole in between 2"
“I think perhaps it is like the case of a crew or a team going out of training. They permit themselves a
certain relaxation before they start training for the next contest. But I think too that there is something to be said
for your reference to the Carmagmole. We are passing through a phase of Revolution, very natural after a great
upheaval. The sense of freedom—the very thing for which we have been fighting—is apt to turn the heads of
the young and thoughtless. There is a spirit of rebellion in the air, which at its worst takes the form of Bol-
shevism, but here is seen in a relatively harmless shape as a general revolt against social restriction, a general passion
for what is known as “a good time.” In any case it is only a passing phase. Already there are signs of a reaction
from this reaction; of a return to the decency of other days. They tell me, for a slight but significant indica-
tion, that the waltz is coming back; that we may even look to see a revival of the minuet and pavane.”
“Then it is just a question of a cycle of vogues? We are to be swayed by recurring gusts of fashion, and
not inspired by a fixed ideal.”
“Fashion counts with us, of course, for we are human and some of us are feminine. There was a fashion
of patriotism as there is now a fashion of something that might easily be mistaken for its opposite. But the
range of its influence is largely confined to a rather negligible element in London, the most provincial of capitals.
The Press—and notably the Photographic Press—gives it a prominence out of all relation to its importance.
The great majority are untouched by it. They talk little and they advertise less. But in a thousand quiet ways
they are setting themselves to make good.”
“To make good money, you mean. Our world seems made up of profiteers and of those who would be
profiteers but can't, and so abuse those who can. Can you name to me a period when there was a wilder rush for
wealth, or a more blatant display of luxury 2 Sometimes I wish the War back; England was at her best when
the call for sacrifice came home to her. But now—we hear great talk of Reconstruction, but I am reminded
rather of the Restoration.” - -
“My friend,” said the Sage, “I shall believe that this too is only a temporary phase. Memory is not our
strong, point, but you can perhaps throw back your mind to a year ago and recall how near we came to the
ruin of our hopes. Victory took us by surprise; and we were less prepared for Peace at that moment than we
ever had been for War. And, just as in the first days of the fighting we went astray, running after the cry,
‘Business-as-usual,' so to-day we are making as bad a mistake when we run after “Pleasure-as-usual'—or rather
more than, usual. But we soon revised that early error, and we shan't waste much time about revising this.
For though we lacked imagination then, and still lack it, we have the gift, perhaps even more useful if less
showy, of common sense. And when common sense is found in natures that are honest and hearts that are
clean it may make mistakes, but not for long.
“No, I am an optimist, and an incorrigible old fool, if you like, but I am certain that the spirit which
won the War is not going to fail us at this second call. Perhaps we have only been waiting for the actual con-
summation of Peace to settle down to our new and greater task.
